Ar6wD9Oeaa	everyone has pretty much said the same thing i wanted to say.     I have been there done that at 6 months old with my first. big mistake. And i felt like a jerk when i had to make him cry it out at night too. I would cry to in the other room b/c i felt so bad. But now he's going to be 3 next month and he's doing fine and he sleeps in his big boy bed all by himself. When my son was 19 months old, we had another babby  and from the get go we never let her sleep in the bed with us. she would sleep in our room in a bassinette till she was  6 months then we put her in a crib till she was a year old. and at a year she went into a toddler bed and everything has been so much easier with the second one.    SO don't beat yourself up too mcuh. It happens. and you learn from your mistakes and thats what counts.|`|vcNvEIOwaa	they have soother 'dummys'??.....thats so sad.......cio mehtod is just nuts.....go get your son....he obviously is scared and has no idea why you don't want to hold him...there is nothing wrong with soothing him yourself without the use of a 'dummy'.|`|vsuXCMqzaa	Go by your instincts. If it feels wrong, do something else.    He may just need extra comfort right now, going through a phase or maybe fighting bit of bug.    There's nothing wrong with stopping for now and starting up again later. He may just need mommy right now.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	The cry it out method should not be used for over 2 hours.  That's far too long to allow him to cry even if you are checking on him randomly.  He obviously just isn't sleepy yet.  He could be going through a growth spurt or is teething and he's simply miserable.  The fact that this is all fairly new makes me assume that its just a phase.  Get him up out of bed, try a nice warm soothing bath, a warm bottle, some quiet reading or music.... he needs to relax and calm down before he'll even consider going to sleep.  Letting him lay there and cry for over two full hours is just too long.  Its time to try something else.|`|EMKuBql8aa	It's ok, you are doing the right thing.     You are NOT damaging him, don't worry, you don't remember things when you were 1, and neither will your son.     Just stay calm and breathe, the first time is the hardest. People have done this for years, take a step outside and breathe for a moment if you feel flustered. Just remember, this too shall pass.|`|rFtKFp03aa	He is not too young.. I did cry it out from 6 weeks old.. although we never had big crying fits because he was use to self soothing...    I found its easier not to go in.. they just get worked up if you go in and try to comfort them...     You are not damaging him either.. he is fine..    Just keep trying.. after a week he should be fine.. and the crying times should go down in number of minutes..     but don't backslide once.. it ruins everything.. if you do cio you are doing cio ...     Ready BABY WISE = the best book ever!!! :) best wishes|`|nYI8eB0Baa	Yeah 2 hours of crying is just cruel..I don't believe in the CIO method..babies do not understand why you do not want to hold them and soothe them.|`|Ctgc429laa	he will be fine.  by tomorrow morning, he wont even remember this happened.   good luck, mommy!|`|jQhjIc6gaa	ok listen it normal for a baby to want that but the reason its so dramatic is because u babied him ALOT when he was younger.also let him cry and dont go in and check on him until he is done crying cuz if u go in well hes awake hell cry even more u have to let him learn how to handle his emotions and it is proven if u dont let them cry now then when hes older he will keep his emotions bottled up.wich could lead to him doing really bad things.just let him cry it'll help.trust me.|`|ZRNlwu5laa	It is going to be hard to try the CIO method with what you have already created. He has had a year of you soothing him and now you expect him to sooth himself. These habit that have been created are going to be very hard to break. You will need to come up with other ways to help your child learn to self sooth and help fall asleep since he has become dependent on you for this. Soft music on a timer, stick to a bed time routine everynight same time (bath, story, bed), they have these light up things that go on the side of the crib that play cartoon displayso n the wall to music for 10 minutes this might help get him to fall asleep, rub his back for the first couple minutes while in bed to get him to relax and get sleepy before walking out. There are a ton of things to try. Good Luck!    *Edit*  I do support cry it out as it does work. It is going to take a little time but each night will get easier.|`|1F7eYuNWaa	This age is prime teething time, so he might not be ABLE to sleep well right now.  This might explain why he wouldn't even settle in your arms.  Don't feel bad about having him come cuddle with you, you are the only thing that comforts him.  Soon enough, he will grow out of this stage, grow up, and you'll be the one wanting to cuddle!  Don't get too frustrated, even though I know you are sleep deprived.  This too shall pass.|`|57Hb92rGaa	You caused this behaviour. Now you have to stop it. Obviously if your child is so distressed he will not go to sleep. But what you must do is establish a routine. Let your child know when it's time for bed e.g. Reading a quiet story, soothing relaxing music in his room or a warm bath. When you have done this you must put your child in his cot and leave him. If your child cries then go into his room and replace his soother but never speak to him and come back out again. If your child is not in any danger and can't hurt himself then he will be fine. It is hard and it won't be easy but it will be worth it in the end. It may take a while it won't happen over night but it will work.Your not damaging him as he won't remember. Don't feel bad. Think of yourself as being a positive parent.|`|iTXnHiwTaa	CIO bothers EVERY mommmy. It's instinctual to go to baby when he cries. I just don't see around CIO though - it'll happen in some shape or form sooner or later. It's not like baby will turn 2 and say "ok now I'll go to sleep on my own..." (ok well maybe some really easy temperment babies) and you have to look at sleep as being as essential as good food. Maybe stay in a chair in his room while he's crying? Then he won't be as scared... just keep in mind that you're just teaching him a new way to go to bed. Right now, go get him and play quietly for 20 min or so and try again to rock to sleep. I think maybe he's overtired - maybe thats why he's crying for a long time.  If you want to try again, stay in the room and put him down while he's wide awake playing with toys... then as he starts to cry just ty to reassure him with your voice. Just start say 20 min before he usually gets tired so that he doesn't become overtired. Good luck.
tfTQ6Cuuaa	Tell her the truth. Tell her you know it was a bad decision but you have learned from your mistakes and want to take responsibility for your actions. You can tell her the truth and ask her not to tell anyone...but things have a way of coming out. You should also inform both potential dads. It's important that they know they will need to submit to a paternity test once the baby is born. You can do one during pregnancy but it's very risky to the baby so it's best to wait til after and hopefully they are mature about it.    Good luck.|`|jn34aSgHaa	wow thats alot to tell your mom. i think that you should be honest and tell her the posibility that the baby could be two men the reason for that is if the baby is not the one that you say you might cause that person a lot of harm so be honest and you will see that it will be way better plus i am pretty sure that you would want your child to know who her or his father is as for your mom i know that she will be pissed and tell you all sorts of things but at the end she is still your mother and she will understand. good luck|`|clipc9yJaa	tell the whole truth if u are responsible enough to have sex then you now have tp own up to ALL the consciquences! Good luck|`|AsICkz9naa	If you had unprotected sex with both lads, then there is every chance that it's one or the other. Tell her the truth. You can get a paternity test done when the baby is born to see who the father is.|`|QZfpGWPIaa	I'd come clean. It's the right thing to do and eventually she may find out so it's best to just get it over with now. Besides, she may be able to help.|`|GkhNUHofaa	def. tell her the whole story...someday after your baby is born you might want to do a paternity test or something..not to mention its not fair to stick the guy w the responsibility of fatherhood when you dont even know 100% that it is his...good luck!|`|AP1MtPN5aa	once you fess up to the pregnancy you might as well spill it all.. or try figuring it out with the woman at the clinic..unless you had sex with them only days apart.. if its weeks or even a month apart you can figure out usually who daddy is.. but id fess it all.. better off having one uncomfortable convo than have the 2nd part hangin on your  shoulders and what if she hears it somewhere else?? good luck hun!!|`|SDvNNYcaaa	whoa whoa.  your mom will most likely get mad at you for being 1. a **** and 2. and idiot.    and what if your not even preggo?    what will you ever do?!     i bet youll GET PREGNANT.|`|2Nznp6BSaa	Yes, I would tell your mom that you are pregnant and there is two guys that could be the father. Also, after the baby is born ( if your decision is to keep the baby) go to a doctor that specializes in genes and DNA and have him/her to test the two guys and the baby.  Good Luck!|`|l7FOtgbkaa	it is good that you are going to tell your mom and i would tell her the whole truth. when it comes down to it, you should tell both guys there is a possibility that another person can be the father.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Tell your mom that there could be two guys    Better telling her everything, then finding out later  If you are wrong, she will fine out    Just be honesty and tell her every thing|`|cj7sSPZEaa	You do not want to lie to your parents.  Trust me when I tell you that they will be way more upset when they find out that you lied to them than they will be if you come straight out in the beginning and tell them.  You are going to have to get a DNA test after the baby is born.|`|KwJDWvB3aa	tell her about both.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	tell your mom the whole truth.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hi just be honest with her because if she finds out from someone else or you let it slip at any point by accident she will flip and yes she may be upset if you do tell her but she will come round quicker and you will need all the support you can get. good luck and congrats.|`|PLK1p8cUaa	Be honest from the beginning.  Good luck.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	No, be honest. You will need and appreciate her support.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	lol to guys cant be the father...i hope ur not pregnant if u think that can happen|`|5b73ZOhkaa	Well tell the truth...because if you lie the truth will eventually come out!|`|QRHufyHiaa	be honest and hope that she helps and supports you.|`|AA12150577	I would tell her better to tell the truth then end up benign wrong.  and then have to tell her the truth later she would be upset that you did not tell her the truth and good luck

qGQCLFinaa	I LOVE IT A LOT!!!!!! My son's name is Kaden,  we didn't find out the gender while i was pregnant with him, so we had Kaden for a boy & Kaidyn for a girl, If he were a girl i would have called her Kaidy (i thought that was cute)  Kaighdyn (it's kind of long but a lil more feminine)  Kaihdan  Kaydyn  Kaydin    You can switch it up a lot, with a c, y, i, e or a on the     We also have a friend who's little girl's name is Kaydence.    For a boy I would use Kaden, Caden, Kaidan, Caiden, or something else a lil more masculine looking, i don't think it's just a boys name, i think spelling it different can me if more feminine  i looked it up online there is no definition for the name, it's too new i guess.... unless i'm not finding the right sites.... good luck!    UGGH!! some people are absolutely RUDE. "a young mommy trying to be different" screw whoever said that! my fiance picked it out! that really pissed me off. that's stereotype if i ever heard one.|`|jtEk35keaa	I think it's a boys name|`|AA11955868	If you had spelled it Caden I'd think more masculine on paper, and if you went Kayden or Kaden I feel like I'd think more feminine.    But really, they don't pull me either direction when I hear it out loud. It kind of sounds like Aiden, but then starting with kay is girlish. I think you've found yourself a bona fide unisex name!    That's just my opinion though.    Kayden  Kaiden  Kadyn  Kadin  Kaydin    Caiden  Cayden  Cadyn  Cadin  Caydin      Kaioduiyn (who doesn't love unique spellings :P )|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	boy's 100%/there are 100 ways to spell it! kaden,kaiden,kadon,kaidon,kayden,,kaedon...|`|XZ8zBBpbaa	It's usually a boys name.

You may feel nausea or queasiness. Some women vomit. ("Morning sickness" can happen any time of day -- it may help to eat small meals throughout the day, snack on crackers or toast, or drink juice or lemonade.)   Your breasts swell and may be tender.   Your nipples and the area around the nipples (areola) get darker and broader.   You have to urinate more often.   You feel tired.   You may become constipated and have heartburn (Tums may help).   You may have headaches.   You experience mood swings -- feel angry, sad, or happy for no reason|`|iSyGrJliaa	how should i know|`|SDvNNYcaaa	your eggo is definitely PREGGO!  that boyfriend of yours lied.  all his little soldiers did just what they wanted.  good luck with that baby now.|`|vTnUklJ6aa	okay calm down you poop a purple crap eachday it is getting closer to you having the baby|`|3706xE4Qaa	It is possible but very low probability.

Yes, ejaculate sometimes comes out during sex as a lubricant and therefore you could be pregnant. What you've mentioned sounds like you're nervous about being pregnant and anything out of the ordinary is making you more paranoid.    The only definitive proof is taking an actual pregnancy test. Most of these will not work until you are due to have your period.|`|jQUIvoKgaa	Even though he did not "finish", there is what is called precum. So throughout intercourse, sperm could have possibly fertilized your egg. But if all else fails, you need to take a pregnancy test, because the scariest part of this whole thing is the "what if factor". I hope everything turns out okay.|`|KlNGOW3aaa	Believe me,seminal fluid only takes a minuscule amount to have sperm in it that can get you pregnant.Most guys never know that any has even come out at the time.  Never take the word of anyone else for the outcome of your very life.Men(and women,for that matter) have been known to lie through their teeth just to get or continue getting sex.The symptoms you mentioned are a few of the most common ones for pregnancy.  Your breasts also can become very tender and almost "translucent"...showing light blue veins through your skin.  You didn't mention your age,but you sound kind of young.  Didn't you see the movie Juno?  If you're young and in this predicament ,(not knowing) then I'd highly recommend the movie.It kind of tells it like it is for young girls finding themselves "in trouble"   Good Luck,and God bless you.............
TE7foNwMaa	I wouldn't go with Olivia... it is definitely more popular than Stella. Olivia is number 6 on the popularity list for 2008, actually.     As for Stella Mackenzie, I definitely love it much more. Stella isn't in the top 100, and "Stella Mackenzie" flows so well! I love it. Stella is gorgeous...     But really, don't collapse on a name that you love just because it's "popular". It may be your only chance to ever use it.   So if popularity of a name is something that concerns you, I would definitely go with Stella. But if Olivia is really your love, don't waver just because of outside influences.    Even if you still have a hard time deciding, you can always wait until the baby is born. Who knows, it might be a boy... or, I'm sure you'll know whether she's a Stella or an Olivia once you see her. :)    Good luck!    -- Amy|`|VHHis05Naa	Stella Jane!|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Olivia Jane!|`|0TGpz08paa	I really love the name Stella Mackenzie. Stella isn't too popular which is good and it is such a pretty and feminine name and I love it. And it flows well with Mackenzie.  Congrats !|`|KwJDWvB3aa	i pretty much never hear the name Olivia...i loveee that name..so i would go with Olivia Jane..    whenever i hear the name Stella i think..lether..(if you watch project runway you know what i mean) that name bugs me.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I think Olivia Mackenzie would be the cutest =) Congrats on your pregnany.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Stella Mackenzie is just fine.  I'm personally not fond of Olivia.|`|D7MIgF96aa	olivia jane is a beautiful name   its sounds really nice,its like it rolls off your tongue  stella mackenzie  doesnt really fit and i think olivia jane is an adorable name|`|4fhizRp7aa	both girl names are too common. How about:  brianna Alex  brittany Alice  Megan Bri  Jaimee Sue  Pam Toriellie  ellie Colbie  Colbie Jane  Vanessa Jo|`|bzkSIJYnaa	Olivia Jane is my favorite combination out of the two. I do think Olivia is waaay too popular right now.    However, I love love the name Stella more than I like Olivia, I just really, really STRONGLY dislike Mackenzie. Stella is gorgeous, pick something feminine and classy to go with it. Stella Jane would be pretty!    One thing I love about Stella, aside from the fact that it's absolutely beautiful,  is  that it stands out among the Isabella's, Gabriella's, Bella's, and Ella's, but at the same time, it blends in nicely.     good luck :)|`|djuRlggeaa	I think you should do Mackenzie Jane!|`|CxRJwJsraa	Stella and Jane are the only ones that I like. Though I prefer Jane as a first name.  I can handle Olivia or Mackenzie as middle names.   So, I guess that means I prefer Stella Mackenzie.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	yes/no.I'd choose mackenzie jane myself.|`|SVyBjDguaa	I like Olivia Jane better =]  Although I'm not a huge fan of Olivia it's still a pretty and cute name and it flows well with Jane.    For Stella Mackenzie I don't like either name, sorry. I find Stella better than Mackenzie though. =]|`|pbfkYJ2daa	i like olivia jane!|`|E9JVLZw6aa	Olivia is beautiful and not common|`|qGQCLFinaa	I like Olivia Jane, I don't hear it much, so it's not too common for me.......|`|BpNSm6sDaa	Stella mackenzie is pretty but olivia jane is unique|`|KlQO9CYgaa	Olivia was  5 for 2008, according to babycenter.com but I honestly like it better than Stella. I think Jane sounds a bit plain but I also like it better than Mackenzie.  Good luck.|`|UIa6R91naa	In my opinion, I LOVE the name Stella Mackenzie. I DO think Olivia is too popular now, I know about 6 Olivia's. I f you think Mackenzie is too common sounding, maybe you could do Kenzie or something like that.|`|nStTaNPwaa	Olivia Jane is nice but keep in mind that the name will be shortened probably when she goes to school....to probably Liz or something like that...|`|jtEk35keaa	Olivia Jane|`|a3w2GMLQaa	i love olivia jane! it's classic, i don't think it's too popular. stella mackenzie sounds too much like a fad.      congratulations : )|`|BxZKFJDHaa	Honestly I would prefer Olivia. But in MY opinion, which shouldn't count too much to you, you should name her, Alison or Alice. That's my opinion though. and congratulations on the new born!|`|MoaIQPvCaa	Olivia Jane|`|04bc2c48d79f30c010ba500a390cb62daa	Stella Mackenzie just rolls off the tongue. Olivia is quite nice, but Jane is plain.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	Olivia is very popular.     Stella is adorable. Mackenzie is pretty common sounding.     What about:    Stella Midori  Stella Noemi  Stella Annabel  Stella Bryony  Stella Corinne  Stella Evadne  Stella Grace  Stella Ivy  Stella Suzette  Stella Violet|`|9FOHmjN3aa	Stella Mackenzie!  Olivia is too common, in my opinion.  Stella is beautiful and classic!  If you think Mackenzie is too common, go with Kinsey or Kinsley!  Stella Kinsley is really cute! : )|`|7adzqyGgaa	i like Jane Mckensi
4CMQuJgOaa	cheerios snack mix  raisins  rice cakes (my kids love apple cinnamon)  granola bars  nutrigran bars  fruit cups   sugar free jello or pudding cups  yogurt  rice crispie treats-melt some butter and bag of marshmellows take off heat and add 6 cups rice crispies...mix well and put in greased pan press with wax paper and cut into squares  If you do not want to make them...they sell them at the grocery store|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Rice Crispie Squares  Cookies  Homemade Gronala Bars  Muffins  Pop Corn  Trail mix|`|FVSRAn2Maa	I found a great website called www.snacksfortoddlers.com. It has some great ideas.|`|LSYTl1kYaa	Cheesy Fingers - toast bread,sprinkle cheese on it and broil until cheese is melted, cut into lengths of 3(or so depending on the size you want!)    Tortilla Roll Ups - Use a large tortilla and spread with cream cheese. Add lunch meat, shredded cheese and thinly sliced tomatoes. Roll it up using the cream cheese as "glue". Slice into 1-2 inch rolls.    Little Hula Pizzas- Use half an english muffin and spread some ketchup over it. Top with chopped ham, sliced pineapple and grated mozzarella cheese. Broil until the cheese melts.    Cubed cheese  cheerios (even get the frosted ones for a change in taste)  any fruit or veggies sliced up, you could even freeze them.    Graham goodies- which is where you pick your childs favorite yogurt and spread it on graham crackers it sounds odd, but kids love it!    little squares of deli meat.  nutrigrain bars     hope you get some ideas from this as well as what others answer with!! good luck!:)|`|gSteSrogaa	My 3 year old loves the funniest things for snacks: olives being on of her favorite! bananas, lettuce, cheese, crackers, peanut butter on celery (my 3 year old actually likes it without the peanut butter).     A couple of super easy recipies my kids love (so easy I actually memorized):    peanut butter cookies:  1 C peanut better  1 C suger  1 egg  mix. roll into balls and press with fork. Bake at 350 for 10-12 minutes.    cornbread cassarole:  1 box cornbread  1 can creamed corn  1 can corn  1 stick butter  mix. pour into cake pan. bake at 350 for 45 minutes   (my son the picky eater loves this one)
ooUZXe7laa	I know exactly how you feel. When my daughter was a month old, all she wanted was to be held. It was so exhausting because in order to get her to take a nap, I had to walk her around the house and bounce her in my arms and "shoosh" her to sleep only to get her to sleep for 30 minutes and then it would start all over again. My mom told me this phrase that stuck with me ever since then though;     "Cleaning and cooking can wait 'till tomorrow  For babies grow up, as we've learned to our sorrow.  So quiet down cobwebs, dust go to sleep,  I'm rocking my baby, and babies don't keep."    It hit me then and there. Yes, I would be exhausted, but she was only going to be that small for so long and I should try to hold her as much as possible. There were going to be times that I needed my "me" time, which is not being selfish whatsoever. Everyone deserves it. Even new mommies :)|`|JsqMSU9Haa	babies need downtime.  as long as you are playing with her, cuddling, showing love, taking care of her basic needs throughout the day you are doing a great job!  moms need downtime too :)|`|yhpR2gNiaa	Don't feel bad. You need to take care of yourself in order to be able to take care your baby. If you don't take care of your needs you could get sick and then it would really hard for you to take care of your baby.  Good Luck with your baby.|`|GomZ9oYHaa	Look if babe is well fed and dry let her cry and dont get that guilt feeling. Dont hold her all the time she has to get use to not being held . Let her cry... no use in u running to her every second. Selfish ...? Heck no. She will get use to you not being there every min. Let her cry.Yes change you whole attitude. YOu have a life and let little one get use to her's as well. Quit holding her so much ..|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	no u have stuff to do u baby is well loved and carred for|`|cv0foxlTaa	I carried babe as much as possible, too, but definitely used the infant seat and swing when I needed my hands free for chores, making supper, showering, etc.  You have to or you'd get nothing done.  Don't feel guilty about it - you only have two hands.    Another option would also be a baby carrier... that way you could hold baby to your chest but have your arms free.  Mine is a Snuggli and cost about $30.|`|rFtKFp03aa	NO!! you need to give the baby floor time even at this young age.. its good for them..     as she gets older around 6 weeks you will be asked to give her tummy time on the floor..     there is nothing wrong with not holding your kid 24 / 7|`|PFO1jxZGaa	No its not bad. She does not need to be held all day long. If she is happy and content laying in her bed or swing etc, let her be, otherwise she will be so used to you carrying her that that is all you will be doing. Of course you need to carry her around when she is upset and interact with her when she is happy but non-stop carrying is no good foe her either.    I've had three babies and although I did carry and hold them a lot it was never non stop because I did need to get other things done too and they were happy to hang out by themselves for a while|`|EHY3FnAmaa	No. Your doing just a fine job. Every parent needs a chill moment|`|YJNql5Mgaa	No, I think it's fine.  Everyone needs a break. :)  Don't feel bad at all!|`|zIXReHyTaa	No, I used to have a battery operated swing for both my kids and do things like the ironing.  It is impracticable and unsafe sometimes to have a baby in your arms when doing housework.  As long as you don't go over 20 mins (unless baby falls asleep), don't leave her crying in it and keep her in the same room as you it is fine.  A musical swing that rocks gently is designed to give you a break and that hot cup of tea will be safely out of reach ;)|`|731jNq3uaa	You may be getting the baby into a bad habit.  Let it sleep in its own bed when asleep, otherwise it will want to held 24/7. Give it time on the floor on a rug when awake, then you'll have time to do stuff.|`|fp3KY1MJaa	No your not being selfish at all. You need some chill time and time to do things. She will be fine in her swing, you are still there.  You do however need to understand that now that you had her it is alot of resposibility, and not much fun, it will get easier as she gets older and you both learn to understand and accept eachother.|`|ZRNlwu5laa	It actually is not good to carry a baby all the time. It is not bad at all that you set the baby down. If you hold him and carry him around all the time now then he is going to learn this and it will be upsetting to him eventually when there isn't someone there to carry him like you do! It is best to let them be on their own some (in a swing, crib, playmat on the floor, etc.) It teaches them to entertain themselves some. And it is also good for them to look at the things above them. So its ok to carry him and cuddle him some, just don't do it 24/7!
Yz1pzloSaa	Yeah, I think it's more boyish but that probably has to do with how I only know boy Cameron's. I'm just used to it on boys.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Maybe that I know as many females as males, but I think Cameron could go either way    Cameron is the only way I would name for a boy  I like Camryn or Kamryn for a girl.  Most girls I know have a spelling like this, some are named Cameron|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Yes i do think its more of a boy name.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I know both sexes use it but I always thought it more masculine.|`|EMKuBql8aa	My wife is named Kammrin and is an extremely feminine looking women, nothing masculine about her, lol.     It's just personal taste.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Yes. The only person I ever knew named cameron was a male.|`|iZDsMCghaa	I like it better for a boy but also think its equally appropriate for both sexes.|`|v202XHZNaa	Cameron is a lot more common for males, but I also know many females with that name as well. It can work either way! It's a great name.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	yes it is a male name|`|yCyw4RlQaa	Kamryn is a girls name i love the name for a girl not so much for a boy|`|6FPpkmi6aa	Well Cameron is a name for both but it works more for a man. I think it is better for a male, because it does sound more masuline. And if a girl had that name, they would have to use a nickname for her cause that sound funny to call a girl Cameron.    In my opinion Cameron is better off suited for a man than a girl. So if your baby is a girl, let's hope you have another name in store for it.  :)    *~That's what I think~!|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Absolutely it is masculine. You are right to think so. It is horrible for a girl.|`|AA11955868	I've actually met both male and female cameron's so it's really hard to say at this point. I think cameron diaz comes to mind first, so maybe I'm slightly more for it being female? But I don't know. I imagine it depends on the age group. You should poll younger children, 5-7 range. All of us have probably met camerons and have been spoiled for your questions :P|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	I know a little Cameron and her nick name is Cammie but that name can def go either way and be cute for both genders.|`|fF8s19Yraa	I think it's better for a male.|`|WoeA75yoaa	Well I think of Cameron Diaz when I hear it. But I like it for both.|`|IClknOd5aa	i think it is cool for both|`|jtEk35keaa	I think it's better for a boy.|`|8a4c030a7a44cd4edebe25c4141c6ddaaa	I think its better for a boy...but then again I have a little cousin thats named Cameron, so I always think of him when I hear that name!|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	yes.|`|BpNSm6sDaa	i think its ok on either but when i hear cameron i usally think its a|`|pERzRTxlaa	No I think it's a cuter name for a girl.|`|z7lg0l7xaa	I think of a guy when Cameron comes up. then again the first Cameron I knew was a guy. haha|`|AZy4fAaHaa	NO MAYBE|`|qPmqsug9aa	ya
ctNNzYW6aa	I was 105 lbs when I conceived, and weighed 165 when I delivered.   After 3 months of breastfeeding, I had dropped to 120 lbs. without any effort. After weaning it took me nearly eight more months to shed the rest of the weight.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	I tried to lose my baby weight but it keeps on finding me...lol...just keep up the exercising and breastfeed, that uses a lot of calories|`|4YIUxSlYaa	6 hours.  It was labour.  I was lighter that before after giving birth.|`|NI8D46J0aa	Well, my oldest is 10, so...12 years? I just can't seem to lose any of it. But, you sound like you are on the right track. You will probably lose it if you keep up the exercise. I hear nursing helps, too. Good luck!|`|POSGHgzuaa	By the time I went back to work at 3 months, I was wearing my pre-pregnancy clothes.  I didn't do much other than walk and breastfeed.

vdjOo1BKaa	yes! twins! name one of em bert!|`|p0prrzf2aa	your probably not pregnant. it's very unlikely|`|fTHE2OoQaa	most likly not|`|vXTlqHoKaa	I don't understand.  Why do you think you are pregnant?  You used a condom and you had your period.  Do you have some reason for suspecting you are pregnant?|`|GdSzrtmAaa	Not sure!!!!!!!!!|`|QRHufyHiaa	There is always a possibility but you are least likely to get pregnant while you are on your period. especially if you used a condom. i wouldn't stress it. good luck though|`|clipc9yJaa	Take a test!!|`|AA12150577	i say no change at all. you was on your period and you used a condom there no way you got prego|`|QZfpGWPIaa	I don't know. There is that possibility. You should get tested just to be safe. i don't think you are pregnant, but it's still a possibility.|`|5b73ZOhkaa	It seem like a noo! but just wait that's the best answer!|`|SxxXBC4vaa	ok so 1) it is extremely hard to get pregnant on ur period!! 2) nothing except not having sex is 100 % and u used a condom which are like 98 % effective.. my guess is ur NOT pregnant.. relax!|`|DZxtwUnFaa	Listen okay if he wore a condom then great your prob not prego but if it broke thats a different story. GO GET A TEST IMMEDIATELY! You could you know then decide what to do, and if you are young you NEED TO TELL YOUR PARENTS. They will find out eventually.
kv8ZFPP1aa	you can try, but there won't be any evidence so they really won't be able to do anything.|`|p0prrzf2aa	im not sure if it's not too late.  try though !as long as you know the guys name  who did it.|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	It's not to late at all. Go to the cops and tell them everything.  Just tell them you were to afraid to come forward about it before. But it will be a long trial. It's going to cause a lot of stress.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	its never too late if you know who did it!|`|Q412OM5gaa	No, it's never too late. You really should press charges. He could do this again, to other girls.    P.S. Your engaged at 16?!|`|KwJDWvB3aa	you can try..they might not be able to do anything but they also might....your fiance? your only 16..|`|85V6cHe4aa	No it isn't too late to report the crime he commited against you and even if you dont know his name you can still report it.    The problem you may have is that to prosecute him the police will need evidence and they may decide not to go ahead with a prosecution if there is none,for example DNA wont be there now.    However i think reporting this is important,firstly you will be doing something to offload the burden you must be carrying and secondly the report will be filed so it could help someone else if he has done it again or does in the future.    He may even admit it but sadly most dont,i hope you get some good support to help you get over this.|`|jn34aSgHaa	it is never to late. you need to go to the police or your parents so that they can catch who ever did that to you.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	At this point, there would be no physical evidence.  You could (and should) press charges, but its going to be your word against his.  Hopefully there are witnesses or some kind of other evidence to nail this guy to the floor.  Perhaps there are even other victims that would come forward.|`|zHRWklEWaa	No you typically have around 5 years to prosecute a rape.|`|7RUqEJzLaa	It's never to late. You should tell. I'm sorry for what happened  You're engaged at 16?|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	That depends on your locale.    If you are in the U.S., there is something called the 'Statute of Limitations'.    Again, presuming you are in the U.S., you should have gone to the hospital and, had a rape test done on you.  There they would have given you a battery of tests.|`|i2yM0T9Paa	If you know who it is, than no. But if you don't know who did it, yes it is because all evidence is gone.|`|4uI0dF0zaa	Of course it is just tell people you were scared and didnt know what to do.|`|K1kZlWY8aa	It's never too late. Tell the police about it, and you said you know the guy, so they should definitely be able to do something about it!|`|4rzigJnBaa	Its never too late hun!|`|Tv6mKW1xaa	I think there is a limit to it. I think if you are raped you have 10 months to tell for them to do something about it but because you didnt go right after they have no proof that he raped you cause his dna such as pubic hair is no longer on you and either is his sperm!  I think it may be 2 late and it may start drama!|`|qPmqsug9aa	I dont think so. If you know who the person is and all his info. just go down and let them know. He just cant get away with it. All I can tell you is to listen to your fiance! He's there to support you and it will make it easiar for you!
Ps5rsLyeaa	Well if a guy likes your friend you know he is not serious about you.. You need to be with someone that is with you for you and not anyone else!. It does not matter how your friend looks if the guy liked you then he would not like your friend... If your in high school alot of boys can be immature and not really want to be committed at that moment... its better off trying to find a serious relationship when your in college but that does not mean stop dating it just means well guys are more mature when they have grown up a little.    and if your friend started liking the guy she is not your friend and you should not trust her!!|`|KHipZhWoaa	don't let your next guy meet your friend|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	like a guy in private and  dont let her know about him|`|NJv2zKxnaa	Maybe you give off the vibe of 'just want to be friends'...since you joke around a lot?
BvOepMNVaa	I have been shy all my life and when i got to college, i realized no one really cares what you say or do. just be yourself. everyone will love you.|`|VLr3jrutaa	sounds stupid but drama classes really help with you confidence building|`|BKHyUgs5aa	start by talking online.  maybe suggest hanging out.   I did this with my bf.   I told him I was shy before hand and to try to bare with me cause after a little while I wouldnt be.   it worked.   Just take small steps and remember we're all human.   we all have flaws.|`|ameJkDgpaa	For your over all problem all i can say is just go for it and try the best you can.For the boy problem i think you should try to talk to him with some of your close friends around. If you have a friend with you you would probably be able too open up more.Anyways, i wish you the best of luck and hope everything works out. I used to be real shy too and i know how you feel. Don't worry everything will get easier :)|`|SYcH3TCRaa	just start talking more and saying things that every one can hear thats what i did
bzkSIJYnaa	Hi Noelle!   I was just thinking the same thing! I absolutely love this section, and it's annoying to have to sift through the troll questions and find the serious questions.     It's absolutely amazing how many people claim to be having twins each day on here, let alone the triplets and quadruplets, etc. I mean, I'm sure there are SOME having twins, but most people seem to be lying.    Also, I think that people should just STOP answering the Slappy-type "is _____ a  good name for a babby boy?". And maybe they will go away!!!    It's quite frustrating    [edit] it's also quite frustrating that you are getting rude answers! If  they don't like this question, they should answer|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	As you can see I am asking fewer and fewer questions, it is because this section is not what it used to be. So many people don't READ the question before answering it, and a lot of the questions don't make sense. So I will be on less and less also.|`|EXBMxFCKaa	No, I love this section, I find it interesting because the answerer's are some of the most intelligent. This section is laid back and I like that about it, no heated debates or strong feelings (at least, not that are overly controversial)|`|yH39NEXSaa	The only troll I like is Slappy but all the other ones can beat it. The ones I hate are the questions like "I'm having quadruplets! What do you think of these names?" I mean honestly, what are the odds of naturally conceiving  quadruplets?|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	Lately I've had trouble finding questions to answer, but more because of questions that are a bit boring (eg "Should I call my baby girl Kate or Emma?") than because they are troll ones.    I think the crazy multiple birth ones are actually dying down, or maybe I've just stopped noticing them!    The troll questions are definitely proliferating at the moment, but I just sort of zone them out now, unless I can think of a witty reply (which is almost never).|`|S3vYMNzFaa	Yes, it's so annoying.    Today was my day off.  But I was so bored with Y!A.  "Should I name my babby Hornblast, it means "loved one" in my culture?"  It's annoying, and I can't believe these people are so persistent - there's really nothing better they could be doing?  Meanwhile, two of the last few questions I've asked have been deleted.      I'm getting a little disheartened with the whole thing.        ETA:  I'm with Pretty Mama - it's not just the trollish q's it's also that there aren't as many fun questions to answer lately.  They ARE getting repetitive and boring.      I prefer questions that shine a light on a little-known name (like the recent one about Oisn), or ask about trends (female names from masculine names), and that sort of thing.  Thinking questions!   Not "do you prefer Clara or Kelsey," and the super-vague "what should I name my baby?"|`|eSDkTvqYaa	sometimes|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	yes and i also hate the ones like " am i pregnant" take a fu*ken test gosh|`|lnZjIhDCaa	sometimes|`|4YIUxSlYaa	Stupid questions like the one you just asked?  Yes, they bore me.|`|wfgFXrRtaa	Yeah, I just answered `should i name my kid abstinence`!!!!! I mean is the person joking or are they like retarded?|`|nfLyS1toaa	yeah i just saw one that said "should i name my child abstinence."|`|FvYqKZSMaa	At times it does ignore me.But every once in a while I do find it funny,very little though.But yes I do agree with you.This used to be an enjoying section.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	No, I sometimes need a laugh in this all-too-serious world.  The babby name users that I know don't report, BTW.|`|sy0hiGspaa	I agree. I also am sick of when I actually ask a serious question, and people diss the name with out saying what is wrong.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I agree that some of the questions are really out there.  I like it better when they ask you to vote on 2 or more names to try and narrow down their decision.  Or ask to find a middle name.  I try to pick and choose what I'll answer/|`|CMuL7XpKaa	I Like games but not people saying "I'm having 32,524,235,2342 uplets i need names!"|`|DHwPgw9iaa	Yeah, they're annoying. The section is probably meant to discuss names semi-seriously. Not that every poster has to have children or even be pregnant, but it's for people who are actually interested in it. If you want to know what people would name their octuplets if they had them, then ask:    "Hypothectically, if you had octuplets, what would you name them?"    NOT    "Oh my gosh I'm having 8 babies tomorrow! Need help!"    I definitely see your frustration.|`|1e214dda0bb6a3cf454196f01665db75aa	its definitely getting more ridiculous every day with all the dumb baby name games and stuff. now i stick to adolescents to read about all the 14 year old girls getting "preggers" or "preggo" and trying to tell their parents about it. it amuses me. ok well have a good day :)|`|SVyBjDguaa	No not really, they are questions about baby names. But no offense but these questions bother me.  =]|`|djuRlggeaa	no, im not tired of them. Would you like to answer my latest question called "I need help with putting a podcast onto my iPod...?" please do.
acj9mB9Paa	I was one of those women who was on Y!A whilst trying to conceive and *gasp*  I NEVER asked if I could be pregnant!!  If I wanted to know, I WENT AND BOUGHT A TEST!!!  Now, when the test kept coming up negative and I was still feeling funky I DID ask what else it could be (turned out I was pregnant, but wouldn't show up on a test).  I guess there is a lot of freakin' poor people who can't afford to go to the dollar store and buy a $1 pregnancy test, but somehow can afford internet service monthly!!  Hmmmm, priorities people!!|`|L0873cdDaa	I know! It's like, just take the freaking test stupid!|`|7AYnWg3paa	YES IT IS annoying....BUT its not just teenagers asking this ....its many women that are TTC that ask this also(althoug they ask every month)...sometimes its just for a spark of hope though...and then sometimes the person is trying for a baby and people assume they are dum teens....because  the obvious answer is" take a test, we dont know" but all ages of all situations even adults suprisingly ask this obvious question.    I JUST IGNORE THEM NOW|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Most of the time it's because they don't know what a PREGNANCY TEST is, but other times they just wonder if it's a possibility.  Some women really aren't sure how things work.  Some girls do want to get pregnant at a young age because they have no idea what it is really like to have a baby.  There are 12 year olds on here that claim that they want a baby!  Those girls are the ones looking for attention and those girls are stupid and in for a rude awakening.  Just ignore those questions.|`|6avKnzkoaa	Not every woman that asks if they are pregnant on Y!A are teenagers. Some are just trying to conceive and trying to get some reassurance about their chances etc.     If it really bothers you, I would suggest that you just ignore those questions. Being angry at those who ask won't solve anything. They won't stop asking just because of you.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	It is very annoying.|`|PQjPq6Ddaa	Well, first off the symptoms stated on MOST websites are not experienced at all in pregnancy, and some that are experienced are not listed.... Another reason could be that some teens do not have a parent to talk to about being pregnant, and no one to ask about their experiences, and they may just be scared... To some of them strangers are the only people that will not judge them, or even if they do get judged by strangers (God should be the only one to judge) then at least they do not have to face that person all the time day after day...  Although there are some teenagers that cannot afford birthcontrol, some states do not offer it for free)  Another aspect, PREGNANCY CAN OCCUR EVEN IF YOU ARE ON BIRTHCONTROL i became pregnant with my twin girls, while i was on BC|`|TDOfjYGBaa	It's really fricken annoying because it's every other question on here and HOW THE HECK do we know if you're pregnant or not do we look like god? Every answer has got to be the same. "You could be pregnant. Go to your doctor" and no you don't have to read them for them to be really annoying. i don't read them but i would like i better selection of questions to look through..other than  "He came in me. My period is late. Am i pregnant"  "He pulled out. i'm 12 and i think i'm pregnant PLEASE HELP!"    omg stop. ask a doctor.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	I think it is for attention. I also don't understand it either.|`|M0ZDvXrAaa	Because men or afraid too|`|TexOmGk3aa	They're not stupid. They know that a lot of women on here have had experience and are just looking for the opinion of an experienced woman.  Maybe they can't talk to their mom about it and need someone similar to them to give them information or advice. Be a little nicer and try putting yourself in their place. Plus, not all of these women are teenagers.  They  may have already looked up the symptoms/signs but onlly have a few and wonder if only having a couple or having other things could still mean they're pregnant. Don't be so cold.|`|35hviVqFaa	Idk, i mean how can we know if you're prego and it's there fault, but they act like it's not they're fault.|`|clipc9yJaa	Wat do u care if they bother u dont read them!|`|qkmsixWXaa	Yeah, personally i think it's ignorant because you know the consequences at that exact moment. I don't think it's an attention thing, I think they're just scared and a little stupid for not looking up the symptoms themselves.|`|nzGdMWbZaa	First of all not everyone who asks a question in this forum about pregnancy is a teenager. When women asks these questions they are trying to get advise from people who have already gone through it or going through it. Its like moral support.
PLK1p8cUaa	Personally I waited three years before getting pregnant again after my C/S (for breech) just because but my doctor had told me we only had to wait three months.  I delivered vaginally the last two of my children without problems.  My doctor encourages VBAC deliveries on all his C/S patients unless there is truly a medical reason that they cannot for the safety of themselves or the baby.  I would not have had it any other way.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	My 2nd baby was also born by section but this one was planned and much easier and nicer...planned are so much better than emergency...my eldest was 3 years when I had my 2nd...I was traumatized and waited...I dd not want to try for a vbac...my pelvis is freakishly small and I have BIG babies..|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Contrary to a previous post you should not get pregnant right after a c-section.  It was major abdominal surgery and the internal scar needs time to heal otherwise your uterus can grow into the scar and you can have major problems with your pregnancy.  Many Dr.'s will not allow you to have a VBAC now, not because it is not safe, but because their malpractice insurance wont allow it.  They will tell you of the risk of uterine rupture, but what they will not tell you (and many Dr.'s do not know because it is not widely taught in medical school) is that the medication they give you to kill pain and induce labor is what causes uterine rupture, so if you have a natural (non medicated), vaginal birth your chances of a uterine rupture are almost none.  However, finding a hospital that will do a VBAC is next to impossible.  I would suggest finding a midwife who is willing.  It will be much less invasive and much more likely to follow your wishes rather that a Dr. who is programed with his protocol.  BTW...  I waited 3 years between my c-section and my next child (divorce remarriage gap) and I had an un-medicated, vaginal birth.  He was 10lbs 3 oz and perfect.  I had no problems.  I was going to have him at home but at 8cm my husband decided we should go to the hospital, after getting there and having that experience, we won't do that again, home birthing for us from here on out.|`|GalBwrwOaa	i had my second child two years after and all is well everything went smoothly and had another csection|`|dSOnm08uaa	my sister in laws daughter was 3 mths old when she fell with her second one both were c section she had no problems what so ever but did get told off from her doc.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	My has had 4 c-sections.    First April 1983 (twins)  Second July 1985  Third April 1987  Fourth April 1988    The doctor advised against trying natural birth because of the scar (up and down, rather than across) because the stomach muscles were cut during surgery.  She had twins first and they weren't coming out correctly, so it was an emergency c-section.    Good Luck.  Everyone is different.|`|4L5hp6rYaa	my baby was 7 months old when i fell with my next after c section.  I desperately wanted a vbac but it didn't work out that way.  The second c section was much easier than the first though...either way all you really want is a healthy baby...but it is kinda disappointing|`|258e111d9f41b74795cfc21f74849106aa	My son was like 20 months when I found out that I was pregnant, again. I will be having a C-section in May. I have tried finding a doc that will specializes in VBACs, but no one in my area does them. I really have no choice but to have another C-section unless  I want to travel. I have heard from some people that the 2nd one is just like the 1st. I have heard from others that it was either harder or easier. I don't know what to expect.|`|skSzDIlwaa	my son is 6months old and i am 8weeks pregnant. it doesn't matter on what you get a natural or a c sections. it depends on the mother previous birth. if you got a c section and the cut was down instead of side you will always have to have a c section but side ways you can do natural. you can get pregnant right after birth also. but good luck|`|pR4nLjyRaa	My son is 22 months old.  I got pregnant again when he was 15 months old but miscarried.  Got pregnant again when he was 17 months old and miscarried again.  Now I'm 6 weeks pregnant.  I plan on having another csection.
AA11955868	I love Nadia, my best friend has that name. Not super pumped on Marian though. Marian doesn't really sound foreign either if that's what you were looking for. Sounds like Marion to me giving me the 50's feeling. Also I heard that it flows a little better if you break up the number of syllables in first/middle names. And Nadia and Marian both have three. Something the think about if that interests you.     I unfortunately don't have any helpful suggestions other than that, sorry.|`|UIa6R91naa	Nadia is a BEAUTIFUL name, but in my opinion. Marian seems like a name for an older woman.|`|eKaGmMzTaa	It is foreign but not unpronounceable. It is very pretty though :)    Here are some other names that you may consider    Anita Marianne  Natalia Marian  Lena Natalie    But I think Nadia is gorgeous?|`|XzV4bUeFaa	It's Russian sounding, but I like it.  Nadia Marian is very nice and not too out there.  I think just about everyone knows how to pronounce it.|`|3EXmT91Haa	I think u should make use a name like nadia and something more american-NOT Britney or ashley but maybe something like reilly-unique and beautiful.|`|4ZQxAvE2aa	I think that the name Nadia is pretty but I don't know about the middle name Marian.|`|lnZjIhDCaa	I love Nadia but I'm not too in love with Marian.|`|IClknOd5aa	it is beautiful, and does sound foreign, but not so foreign that Americans will find it strange, or couldn't pronounce it.     u did good!!!

Take care hun|`|egAIuHQxaa	It is very possible I am 23 and my sister is 24. We are 10 months and 5 days apart. Which means for 2 months we are the same age.

bmoCpcdraa	13 all my children waited till 18 to date dont let people tell you how to live|`|p0prrzf2aa	don't listen to any of them. you can kiss whoever at any time you won't. you don't NEED a boyfriend. you won't die without 1 either|`|Yz1pzloSaa	Don't listen to people. I just turned 15 and haven't had my first kiss. You'll get it when you get it, and guys can be so immature at 13, anyway. It would be a good idea to wait until you and your to-be-boyfriend are older, because relationships always go smoother the more mature you both are. Don't rush it. Wouldn't you rather kiss someone you REALLY like and not just any old boy?    Don't give in to peer pressure.    ;)|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	there is always a quiet guy every girl overlooks. your job is to find him and here is were he might be: art class, chess club, tennis team, swim team, golf team, a drafting student, a history buff. home ec, wood working class, ((my high school had a vocational school) student - auto repair, electrician, electronics, nursing..) ski club, math or science major. the guy is bill gates smart and not real in with party crowd or social gatherings. now go find him and when you do keep it to yourself because if you give the other girls a clue to how great he is they being the competitive holes they are will try to steal him away from you. understand?|`|852b64707eee9567246c31b995f4a087aa	Where's the fire? You seem to be all lights and sirens rushing toward the first steps toward intimacy.    Give yourself enough time to do this the RIGHT way.    It doesn't matter what other people say. Some people will say or do anything to make you as miserable as they are.    And rushing into kissing just so you can have something to gossip about with your friends isn't appropriate.    The people who are telling you that you are behind the times are dead wrong.    There is no calendar date that says 'must be kissed' or you are a loser!    The most important thing for you right now is to focus on your school work and develop friends from both sexes so that you can learn what it means to be a real person not just a set of rotating lips from boy to boy.|`|3OL7vVLuaa	You probably should post this in "dating & relationships" -- but.... to answer your question.... there is no "set time" to do ANYTHING. Just get that out of your head or you will always feel under pressure and pressure is the very worst reason to give into anything! A lot of times, the people pressuring you haven't done it either -- they just like to bug other people.   It would be sooooooooooooooo much better to have your first kiss must older and have it be w/ someone you're actually in a loving relationship with than it would be to do it now, just to "get it over with" with some guy you hardly know or like -- that's definitely not the thing to do!! There will always be pressure... pressure to have a boyfriend, have your first kiss, have sex, get married, have kids, and there is no law that says you have to have any of those things! Do things when the time is right. When YOUR time is right. When God's time is right - when he brings a special person into your life -- that's when it will be right "FOR YOU." Be strong and don't let other people push you into anything -- it won't make any difference to them, but you could get really hurt and you don't deserve that :-) Trust me. Everything will be okay :-)|`|d9WUbMBmaa	Grow up. I was sixteen when I had my first kiss. Stop worrying and putting a time limit on it. It'll happen when it'll happen.

U will kiss when u are ready.|`|HWtG9dkzaa	I was 17 when I had my first kiss, so I think you need to stop worrying and getting worked up over the fact you've not had you're first kiss or bf yet.|`|iNufkBtJaa	my first lip lock was at 16 as was my 1st bf.  im 21 now, and when i was younger i was like popular... i just wasnt interested in getting a bf right away.   so dont feel pressured.  it will happen when it happens.   my first bf is actually the guy that im currently engaged to, so im happy i waited to kiss someone i actually liked|`|WwrCYF1kaa	Stop worrying about something so inconsequential.    13 - the age when you have your first kiss? What absolute Bull.    13 is far to young to feel left on the shelf.|`|BSKJdZK3aa	im 14 i didnt have my first kiss but only because i was playing hard to get with 4 girls i rgret that i did that    maybe if you were more into video games cars and short skirts then maybe you would have had a bf by now|`|zBpnFhQ3aa	Your 13. Your young. I'm 17. I'm still fairly young. I just got my first boyfriend. Trust me it's really no rush.  Your first kiss, I think it should mean something, though no one seems to care anymore...it's just something we do. Something now only perceived as something physical for pure enjoyment. Have you ever noticed that? How strange is that?  Peer pressure. It's quite hilarious actually. People say it's the worst thing in the world, but if people just didn't care so much what others think, there would be no such thing and everyone would be a bazillion times happier.  Never give in to peer pressure.  If they jumped off a cliff would you?  If they all decided to go beat up a helpless person for no reason would you?  Just to feel accepted?  Your first kiss doesn't have to be like that either you know. You don't have to do what everyone else wants.  Let these kinda things mean something.|`|o40QqoQGaa	This is why there are so many people who are having sex at such a young age, is because people dont feel cool if they arent hanging on a guy, or kissing somebody by the time they are 13.    Definitely dont worry about it, live life how you want to, and dont worry about what other people think!|`|fachCP0Oaa	That's okay, there's no rush.|`|NRVyHZNoaa	dont rush it. it's better if you wait for the right guy and the right time. i had my first kiss at 14 during spin-the-bottle and it was pretty icky.. so its not worth it to waste your first kiss like i did. that being said, im 16 and i still havent had a boyfriend, nor have i had a real kiss. don't worry. if you really want to find a guy, try extracurriculars to find one, but you really dont NEED a boyfriend.|`|p4XrCUTAaa	go out and try  to find a man like on myspace and if they live were u live meet up with them. and i have the same problem.|`|4x3vThR9aa	Hey, don't feel pressured to start a relationship when you're not ready! Even if you ARE ready, don't force yourself to go out with a guy you obviously don't like. That's not a good idea. I'm 14 and I probably won't have my first kiss for a while and that's ok! Don't kiss someone just because everyone else has. You'll regret having your first kiss with the wrong person.|`|EpJS1pjPaa	Honestly, there's more to life than dating at this age. You've got heaps of things to concentrate on like studying and spending time with family and friends. Don't feel pressured into kissing a guy just because everyone else around you are skanks. You should feel proud that you have been able to resist such things . I'm 14 and a girl and I haven't even gone out with a guy yet, let alone kissed one! It's not worth the heart break, so many girls get heartbroken once they're dumped. I know it feels like your missing out but u aint!|`|AA11468869	I do not know why,but I can't believe that you are 13|`|WBpanY8Kaa	You are only 13 years old you have plenty of time to have a first kiss.  Do other things like study.  I personally feel having a boyfriend is to young.
quM6eMT6aa	i suggest you take a trip to the doctor thats the only way to be sure if your pregnant or not hope this helps good luck|`|AA11185897	Hello, DOCTOR, can I schedule an appointment?|`|pUnjP0Jyaa	first off dont come on yahoo answers asking am i pregnant or not like we kno imean you dont even kno so how and the hell can we kno wen we dont even kno you;lol and  the fact that you want to be so bad is more than likely the reason your period is late imean stop stressing over the whole situation go to a doctor a take another test sometime in feb. if your oeriod still hasnt come but first stop stressin over the situation or your period wont ever come and that wont neccesarily make you pregnant just so you know!
tO7lBnMfaa	In my state Il you can't watch more than 3 children without a license. But other than that there is no way of making you follow strict guidelines. so far I have not seen anything allowing you to watch that many children and be license exempt. Since the license is free and your wife is familiar with the daycare setting becoming licensed will be in her best interest. Not only are parents more comfortable with sending their kids to a licensed daycare but she may qualify for federal /state grants and reimbursement programs.     As far as being a business the answer is yes. She is being paid to provide a service. For tax purposes she would be considered a sole proprietor I believe. I would call the IRS ( irs.gov for contact info)  They were very willing to help me.    $80 a week is very very cheap. At least here it would be the going rate is between 25-30 a day per child. DO some research and call both home daycare and daycare centers for price ranges if you want to be competitive go for the low end of the spectrum but not under. The people on Craigs list probably aren't providing daycare settings, they are more babysitters and believe me there is a difference.    Bottom line is doing research type in your state + DCFS and go to the Childcare/Daycare section here you will find licensing standards how to become license exempt and tons of other resources.|`|EMKuBql8aa	It depends on the state and sometimes even the county/city you live in. You need to google all this and call around to make sure it is all legal.     Good Luck.
Jo2DfRzaaa	lol    your the funniest troll i've seen today.  good work.|`|UUpsa35Daa	It's where they pump warm water into your bowels to flush out excess feces. It feels very uncomfortable from what i've heard but isn't painful. The best thing you can do while it's going on is to just relax as much as possible.|`|qgimQqhmaa	its like to clean out your system basically... through your butt. haha never had it done.. but i guess it could be a good idea.. kinda like a detox... ask your doctor?|`|01Mu3wUeaa	You will not have to wear a diaper.You will just probably have some diarrhea for a little bit.    Is basically a tube attached to a bag...the bag is filled with only water or can be filled with water and herbs...the tube will be inserted into your anus and will allow the solution to flow in.You will hold it in until you can no longer and will need to release it in the toilet.    It really is no big deal.I had to do one since I was doing a water birth and didn't want feces bobbing around in the water! lol|`|XgHKUJoYaa	Ah yes, the enema.  I used to take those.  Basically, you stick a small tube into your anus and you flush water or a prepared fluid into the anus and into the colon.  Fill up as much as you can, then sit on a toilet and let it all out.  Massage your abdomen very thoroughly to get all of the liquid out.  If you get all the liquid out, you wont need to wear a diaper.  However, if you're unsure, at least be close to the toilet.      I used to sit on the toilet about 30 minutes after mine while trying to push out any water that might be stuck in my colon with rigorous massage.      The most difficult part for me was inserting the plastic fitting comfortably into the anus.  Even though its small, I found it to be very painful.  The trick that I found was to put a little of the tip in, and let some of the liquid inside.  If the liquid is warm, you'll feel your insides completely relax, allowing the rest of the tip to slide right in.  But make sure the liquid isn't hot, because it really hurts(the anus is very sensitive).      Good luck, and since its a nurse doing this for you, I'm sure you'll be fine.|`|547Ln6rNaa	Good lord you're not going to wear a diaper! it's an enema, you put the water in, then you sit on the toilet until it all comes out.     Oh wait....you just made this ID and you joined on 28th and have asked six questions and you've made them private already....are you a real person or a perv trying to get us all to talk about sht and stuff? I do so hate to offer real advice to creepy diaper people.

KeevlZnTaa	Most medications are not safe to give to a child 2 and under without doctors approval. I think you should just keep him hydrated, use water, pedialyte, water(stay away from sugary juices, and milk).     You can try the BRATs diet, which works well for diarrhea. BRATs is Bananas, Rice, Apples/apple sause, and toast. All these foods are high in fiber which helps regulate bowel movement. Stay away from high sugar foods, and dairy, which can cause diarrhea.    If the diarrhea persist for too long, it would be a good idea to take you child to the doctor.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Keep him hydrated, Pedipops would be good, as would Gatorade, Pedialyte, any sports drink without caffeine and/or guarana.   No Pepto Bismol until his is 12, it has salicylates in it (you know, aspirin?).   Over the counter?   Water, clear soups, broth, and sports drinks - if he is at all acting lethargic or overly tired, his eyes sink in their eye sockets or his gums get pale - take him to the ER, he's dehydrated.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Don't give your child anything to stop the diarrhea unless the doctor suggests it.    Sounds like he might have a touch of the stomach bug.Keep him hydrated with a electrolyte drink (like pedialyte) and he should be fine.Perhaps you should call the doctors and ask.      **Be sure you wash your hands after every diaper change if he still wears them.|`|n3IoftMFaa	You want to keep him hydrated. It is NOT safe to give him anti diarheals. The poop needs to come out - it is infected with his illness and you don't want it hanging around in there. make sure he is peeing - light yellow or clear is great - dark yellow is more worrisome.|`|SBKQkprMaa	That happened to my daughter at about the same age and the dr. told me to give her PRO-BIOTIC yogurt. It was a life saver, really helped. Diarrhea was so bad - and I didn't want to give meds either. You can find it is where the regular yogurt it. not sure if Activa yogart is pro-biotic but you'll be able to find it.|`|AA11259545	No need for an OTC med.  You can just give your son foods high in complex carbs such as bananas, oatmeal, and rice etc.|`|M38SbH39aa	Have you tried Pedialyte?  It comes in a bottle as well I think in frozen popsicles.  I gave this to my 13 month daughter and it stopped her diarrhea immediately.  I think kids like it because there are many flavors such as mixed berry and apple, etc.
43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	My daughter had it at 8 months old and I was exclusively breastfeeding.  She was better by a week as long as you give the meds and neb treatments as recommended.  She has since been diagnosed with asthma and wheezing sometimes when sick, not often but sometimes.  She is now 18 months old and has been sick since RSV a total of maybe 3 times which were just minor colds thats all.  Be prepared to keep the neb because usually once RSV has hit, whenever the baby gets sick again she will wheeze and need to use it.  All you can do it cuddle her, try to occupy her and make sure to give her the treatments, they are so important.  I hope she gets better real soon.|`|6Zdfx7QOaa	My 5 month old was diagnosed with RSV last week. It is heart breaking to watch them be so sick. We didn't have the breathing treatments but the dr. did prescribe anti inflammatory steroids for her lungs, and antibiotics for her ear infection. Watch for signs of respiratory distress - turning blue, rapid breathing, and the chest sinking in when trying to breathe.    Keep the head elevated, a cool mist humidifier will help, suction the nose frequently, make sure to keep her hydrated, and extra extra cuddles. Use tylenol or motrin to control fever and pain.     Probably you will get sick too. It's very very contagious so try to keep her away from others and out of crowded places like the grocery store and church.|`|ZRNlwu5laa	My daughter has childhood asthma and has since 3 months. She has had RSV a few times. We also have a nebulizer and use it three times a day everyday throughout the winter. My daughter hated it when younger but its used to it now. You have to watch their breathing patterns and make sure that they are getting enough oxygen. Our daughter was admitted to ICU for a week when she has RSV as it turned into pneumonia. All I can say is get your self fully educated on it. Prop her head to help breath, suction her a lot, and control her fever and DO NOT OVER DO IT ON Pedialite if you use it. It can have the reverse effect and dehydrate giving diharea if they have too much. (we learned this one the hard way) Talk with your pediatrician or advice nurse. When my daughter got it she was sick for about 2 weeks. Good Luck!     Prop up your child's head to make it easier to breathe and sleep.   Suction your babys nose if he or she can't breathe well enough to eat or sleep.   Control fever with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Never give aspirin to someone younger than age 20, because it can cause Reyes syndrome.   When a person with RSV is otherwise healthy, symptoms usually get better in a week or two.     RSV can be serious when the symptoms are very bad or when it leads to other problems, like pneumonia. Certain people are more likely to have problems with RSV:    Babies younger than 6 months, especially those born early (prematurely)   People with immune system problems   People with heart or lung problems   Adults older than 65   These people sometimes need treatment in a hospital. So its important to watch the symptoms and call your doctor if they get worse.    Can you prevent RSV infection?  Its very hard to keep from catching RSV, just like its hard to keep from catching a cold. But you can lower the chances by practicing good health habits. Wash your hands often, and teach your child to do the same. See that your child gets all the vaccines your doctor recommends.     Medicines to prevent RSV may be given to babies and children who are more likely to have problems with the infection. Sometimes these medicines don't prevent RSV, but they may keep symptoms from getting serious.
SEzIkGNiaa	You can't get a job legally until the age of 16.  But in the meantime, consider the following:    Babysitting  Lawn mowing/care  Dog walking  Cleaning houses  Bake sales  Paper Route
AA11962461	Great to know that he is doing fine!|`|IkkYOehSaa	this one thing you HAVE to call your doctor about. At that small only a doctor can say how much medication a baby can have.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	I asked my doc this same question when my baby was 4 weeks old.  She said to make sure they are infant drops, and to only give 0.4 on the syringe dropper.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	It should have instructions on the bottle.|`|vsuXCMqzaa	Check the weight range on the bottle or ask your pediatrician what dosage to give.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I have dosages for down to 5lbs BUT for kids under 3 months you really should talk to a doctor first.  If they said to use it just use the dosage on the site below, you have to know what strength you are using.      http://askdrsears.com/html/8/t089101.asp|`|K4zsztkRaa	Um it's a lot safer than the circumciison you just put him through.      -Connor|`|qsjGSXaRaa	Call your pediatrician.|`|jn34aSgHaa	call your babys doctor because the amount you must give the baby it depends on the weight be honestly my son was also had a circumcision but i didnt give him anything he was just fine  are you putting a lot of vasline? if you are not then do so and remember to put the vasline so it dosent stick to the diaper.|`|507c5070ad881726f855f0538514580aaa	the bottle should hve what ages are able to use it|`|qgimQqhmaa	NO!  They are still too young.. but i would still ask your pediatrician.. and if your 3 wk old is needing tylenol i would take it to a doctor asap.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	you need to call your pediatrician or the hospital where they did it|`|60c23c4e75582a183b256dc1695d7638aa	Here is a website that breaks it down all the way to 12lbs. A good idea is to print this out and tape it inside the door to the cabinet you store your medicine in. That way it's there when you need it.    For future reference, always go by the weight on the bottle, not the age! Not all babies weigh the same at a certain age, so that's why you use the weight. Your doctor will also tell you that.|`|SkCnQHceaa	no. they dont need it for pain. Just make sure his little man part is covered with petroleum jelly so it doesnt stick to the diaper. It will be much better in a few days.|`|DLDweOcYaa	Usually you can't give anything to a child until they are 1 month old and up.|`|3ShtRhIEaa	omg No    the medicine is too strong for their stomache
AA10844779	You could get a blood test done to be completely sure, 99% is still not 100%. If you only took one home pregnancy test, you could also try another one to see if you get the same result. Since you have a really regular cycle, it's either a false alarm or you're pregnant.     Did you go for a holiday lately? They do say a change of climate can affect your cycle, maybe that's why?     I hope you are pregnant or get pregnant soon, fingers crossed for you!|`|6avKnzkoaa	You can either wait a little bit longer, so when your period ends, if it doesn't come to check again. Or go in for a blood test at the doctors.  False negatives do occur. Best of luck!!|`|acj9mB9Paa	My pregnancy tests did not show positive until 20 days after I ovulated (that would be 40 days from the first day of my last period for me as I have 33 day cycles and that would make me 7 days late!  I was not using a cheap pregnancy test either, it was an answers early results test!    Stress comes in many forms, travel, schedule change, a sleepless night or two, a new activity or even worrying about TTC.  I took us eight years to have our first and it took us three months to conceive this one.  Don't give up and if you feel you could use some extra pointers on when your fertile time is, read "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" by Toni Weshler.  It helped us a LOT!!  Good luck and baby dust!!    OH, also try testing with your FIRST morning urine!!|`|9hrJfhIIaa	False negatives occur - wait a couple more days and retest - I had my faint positive a week after my missed period.    Good luck!|`|FMQbI5V9aa	Most ob-gyns say call when you have a missed period they can do a blood test and a urine test. I had this scary blood lady named Valentina do all my blood test during my pregnancy.|`|036UU02Caa	Periods can change if anything drastic in your life happens. Stress anything. Best thing to do is wait a week, if no period, get REGULAR first response. Not digital. They've been known to screw up results. Good luck.
UXRwYHrMaa	I can really understand where you are coming from and I'm sympathetic. I know it comes from a place of you really wanting to be involved with this (hypothetical at this point) baby. But one thing to realize is that when the day of birth comes SHE'S the one who is doing all the hard work. She is the one who may be in pain or scared and the comfort of being near her family may be of the utmost importance to her to cope with the experience.     If it is important for your family to be there, and it is so close that you would think about driving your pregnant wife to a hospital in another state, that just begs the question: why can't your family just drive from LA to meet you? They'd be driving the same road you propose to take your wife on, only they wouldnt be pregnant while roadtripping.    Plus it will be a lot easier to do your OB care with a practice and a hospital near to home. you have a lot of visits before the big day.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I think you guys need to learn how to talk things out and agree before you decide to have a kid period.    This child is going to be both you and your future wifes kid..if you cannot decide on where to have it, how will you decide on how to raise it?      Good luck.|`|DPegPYRPaa	Sorry to say this, but she will be carrying that baby for 9 months, with or without you.. She should have the choice of hospital etc.|`|2tOT1MmFaa	I just gave birth three months ago, so this is from experience. I think you are being selfish.  She will develop a relationship with her doctor during the numerous prenatal visits and that is a huge part of making pregnancy, but especially the delivery easier!  To be upset that she doesn't want travel, even from Phoenix to LA is ridiculous!!  Pregnancy is difficult and your reasons are silly!  Because you were born there?  Really.  As far as your family is concerned...it is their job to come to you.  You don't drag a pregnant woman almost 400 miles to give birth, which by the way is not just right there.  Dr's typically restrict any travel during the third trimester anyway!     Again, pregnancy can be difficult, uncomfortable, among other things.  Basically, you dont have a good argument.  It is her choice!!  Even if it ends up being Texas.
PW3hcVZiaa	One word: DOCUMENTATION!  Teachers have to cover their butts these days, because of crazy parents- you can't easily record phone calls, but emails can be printed and saved.  It is also easier to answer emails instead of trying to call a parent and playing phone tag.  So, yes, it is a GOOD idea for that teacher to prefer email.|`|irLnPW4aaa	Not at all.  Remember, the teacher probably doesn't have a phone in the classroom (in the schools in my area, the phones are in the teachers lounge and the office, NOT in the classroom) and the teacher doesn't need interruptions during the school day while she is working with her students.  And she probably doesn't want people calling her at home (you wouldn't call your doctor or the bank manager at home, would you?).      With email, she can answer you as soon as she gets a free moment.  And it is less confrontational.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	Not at all.  The teacher is busy during the day with her students.  She may check her voice mail once a day.  If I have a problem or a question I usually e-mail her before we leave in the morning, this way she can read it before school.  Or I can e-mail her during the day & she can answer when school's out.      I like this way better because then we both are able to handle it at the time that works for us.  I can never talk on the phone anyway, my kids always bug me at that time for reason.      If there is ever a bigger issue then we can always set up an appointment to talk in person.      Oh, and they even have their own class websites now.  It has spelling words, Blogs, pictures, or whatever.  Our school also has a thing where you can look at your child's grades in each class and look to see how much money they have on their lunch count.  They even put assignments up on the websites too.|`|UUpsa35Daa	Not at all, a lot of teachers are too busy to sit on the phone for X amount of minutes. Between looking after kids, lesson plans, looking over work...they have a lot going on. It's more convienent for them if the can just type an email while they're already at their computer.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	no, i think its reasonable; however, if it was something urgent, i would call anyway.|`|85V6cHe4aa	A lot of my childrens teachers seem to like this means of contact now,in fact one of my daughters school's even has a special account for that purpose and its used to contact a teacher for any general query about school lfe.    I would find it strange if i was refused a phone call if i felt it was needed but as long as it's an option email is really easy and no sitting by the phone waiting for a call from a busy teacher is great-just check inbox when you're ready :)|`|86oPkfzOaa	No, why would it be? Some teachers are very busy, and you might call at the wrong time. With e-mails, you send them the e-mail and he can answer whenever he wants.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Nothing wrong with that at all. I'm sure you could still call if it were more urgent.|`|EMKuBql8aa	No, some people just don't want the phone ringing all the time.|`|yKzl64gtaa	no thats how all my kids schools are.  everything is done through a computer|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Nope. It is far easier to read 30 emails throughout the day than to answer 30 phone calls while teaching. It allows the teacher to not deal with the disruption of phone calls during class and dismissal times and keeps him up to date on any concerns you have. I think it is an excellent idea and our own district uses it as well.|`|kWBXSjHXaa	Well usually they wont give there cell numbers and if you call the school it could be  huge hold up and its rather better then getting 10 emails then 10 phone calls|`|fdnbXfvfaa	He may not have to listen to it ring all the time  Parents could stay on the phone for ages, and he might not have the time  Some people don't feel comfortable talking on the phone. It is very common|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Not strange at all.  Fact is, teachers usually can't answer phones in the middle of class (IF the classroom is even equipped with phones,) so that forces us to make phone calls during our lunch break (only 20-30 minutes to begin with,) during an extracurricular break (the only time we have to prep,) or at the end of the day (usually filled with workshops, meetings, or our own doctors, etc. appointments.)    We can check emails in the classroom, while the children are doing independent work....and get back to you asap.  Now if he said he REFUSES to take phone calls...that'd be a different story.
6avKnzkoaa	Every woman will carry and look differently when pregnant. There are no "too big" or "too small". Sometimes it can be all because of the size of the baby, or how the baby is positioned or just the mother's built and body size. As long as the doctor isn't concerned you should be okay. =]|`|p0prrzf2aa	i like your profile btw      but i think you look great!|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	You cant really see your belly in the picture, but Im sure if your doctor isnt worried then you are fine.

8bUKN0vNaa	In australia they are generally called trolley mates.  You can find them on the australian ebay site by doing a search for trolley mate.    Here is one ....    http://cgi.ebay.com.au/TROLLEY-MATE-shop...    They are such a fantastic thing to take shopping and can be thrown in the wash.  Perfect!|`|pUkijtHtaa	I think they are just called "trolley covers" - do a Google search on that term and it brings up quite a few.    Personally, I don't see the point of them. I don't think there has ever been a reported case of illness due to trolley germs - it just seems a bit over the top to carry around a great big padded cover for the 30 minutes they spent in a shopping trolley. And even if they lick it / bite it, what harm can it do?

Vincent Thomas McCarthy ~ 6 (I'm not a big fan of the name Thomas, but it definitely flows much better here.)    Benjamin Vincent McCarthy ~ 4 (I don't care for Banjamin. I love Ben though. Bennett is on my favorites list with the nickname Ben.)    Robert Thomas McCarthy ~ 3 (Honestly, it sounds way to blah for me. I don't care to much for Robert. Well, I guess Robert itself isn't what I dislike so much. I don't like the nicknames from it: Bob, Bobby, Bert. Robbie is ok though.

I don't really like Vincent, so I didn't choose the names that had the first name Vincent.|`|N5EhfDX2aa	Vincent Sebastian McCarthy 6/10 Sebastian to me is not masculine and strong enough for a boy  Vincent Thomas McCarthy 9.5/10 Vincent is a great strong name, thats interesting because of its V, it sounds great and looks good written down. It is a good name to grow up with; suitable for baby and adult alike. Thomas is great name simple yet effective middle name; you cannot go wrong.   Benjamin Vincent McCarthy 8/10 Benjamin is a lovely name softer than the others you've chosen]and you must keep in mind that he will most likely be called Ben which in my opinion is not a strong name   Robert Thomas McCarthy 9/10 Robert is a wonderful name, strong and masculine, might be shortened to Rob, Robbie which are great nicknames    Good luck and congratulations =] I think you should call him Vincent Thomas or Robert Thomas. Hope I helped!|`|OnDIrxNEaa	I like them all except for Benjamin, but Vincent Thomas is my absolute favorite.|`|ZF7S7EUPaa	robert tomas

c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	This is just in response to BabyPhat -- before you point any fingers at people about being able to spell, maybe you should check out your own writing.  It's YOU'RE and RECENT (not resent).    As for the real question at hand - you're best off seeing a doctor at this point.  Only he or she will be able to give you good answers.|`|eemmWU0Haa	Before you say anymore...and that I understood UM learn how to spell. wow your married Gee the Hubby must be proud!?|`|KXPyWB5maa	HI. My advice  honey is to go to the doctors. It is a good idea to hae a pre conception check up before you even start to try. Please don't stress. Periods can be irregular as to sometimes pregnancy tests can come back negative when you are pregnant if you test to early.  PLease go to the doctor!!!!!
PLK1p8cUaa	Best chance of an accurate result is 5-7 days after a missed period and that is with your morning urine since it has the highest concentration of hormones.  You can do an early test but they are not always 100%.  Good luck.    P.E. I took one the day of, the day after and three days later all were negative.  I waited 7 days and it was positive.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	A test will be accurate on the first day of your missed period- so take one tonight.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	either go take one now or wait!! but you can take one as soon as you miss your period.     mornings are best...as soon as you wake up and pee because of the hormones.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	I would say today.|`|nzGdMWbZaa	I would wait for about a week or so after your missed period to take a test so this way if your period is late it will show up.  Also take the test with your early morning urine. I am sending baby dust your way:)|`|acj9mB9Paa	You can take a test right now|`|skSzDIlwaa	you can take a test the day of the miss period or the day after.|`|yqQBcjDmaa	Some say a week after.  However, if you missed it today there is a good chance it will be accurate today.  Good luck!|`|AsICkz9naa	The best time to take a test is in the morning when your urine is at it's most concentrated. You can take a test from the first day of your missed period.|`|QRHufyHiaa	some you can take 5 days before your missed period. i would wait a few days just to get more accurate results.|`|pUnjP0Jyaa	lol i kno how it feels the day is almost over and ihavent started mines though im scared to test cus iont want it to say no and its yes or vice versa so im waiting til 5days and if its not here by than illl test i suggest you do that too cus we still have a couple of more days left in this mo.

gZplqgodaa	"The more people you love the more you cause trouble."  That not true because I heard it from this girl nikki4758, when you love someone you would have to come out with it some day because it might breakaway soon when he gets a gf. Its hard to tell a guy you love him when hes your closest friend in the WHOLE world. Sometimes you'll be nervous. Let it down low not high because if you do that he maybe think your kidding. Who knows he may love you back! the whole point is tell him and flirt with him. If he says no don't start crying and whining, who going to fix it?    Don't let your friends beat him up if he says no, maybe you'll find a way better guy who likes you the same! Just to love sarcasim, You can use tools to break ice.|`|Ujb6P4gMaa	Just start to talk to him about like dating or something like that.|`|KHipZhWoaa	cleavage always works for us|`|CiIxyXBbaa	Lick his face.    Edit: Slap his face.|`|1Hyrx5gMaa	To show flirting you should make it obvoius of course to make it noticeable. Then maybe later do something that doesn't occur with your game, next if he notice it, tell hime how you feel.

vOTcVMsdaa	As a mother of a son, I really wouldn't want to know. There are some things a mother just needs to be ignorant about. If you got like HIV then yes, she should know. But if you're perfectly fine then leave it be. She doesn't need to know.|`|p0prrzf2aa	sure|`|yIdwMPsoaa	no dont . its not something they should know!!|`|8V39PymEaa	yes you should|`|DIEih5asaa	No, you'll only make her jealous.|`|VLr3jrutaa	i think you should tell your mum cause then you know you can talk to her about anything. been a boy she should take it ok and more then likely very impressed at how mature you are in telling her. But i would leave out the std part and instead tell her you used a condom.  i would like my son to tell me when he does.|`|yKzl64gtaa	if you really feel that you need to, then yes of course.|`|LdzTP5VXaa	Yes you should, for sure she has words of wisdom to share with you. lol|`|FTs2py0kaa	tell,,, don't tell...........wear a rubber......so it doesn't happen again..................aids still kills.herpes is no picnic|`|HeN3GT8aaa	sure why not, but you should pratice saying it first.|`|Elaimr9qaa	NO.|`|i2yM0T9Paa	Yes.|`|gZplqgodaa	Yes, let it down low and maybe she'll understand. Many men are sexually active but I would be very careful, use a condom.|`|cUs60ETLaa	uhm, that's completly up to you. it depends on the type of relationship that you have with herr.   quite honestly if your all cured & better then what's the reason to tell her?     quite frankly i WOULD NEVER have told my Mother..     that's your bussiness!     Not hers.
547Ln6rNaa	A staple in the wrist is unlikely to cause a lot of damage, and there are more then one nerve in the hand so he should be able to feel something, when he is not looking, pinch his finger, bet he squeals.    Wash it with soap and water and if you have it, put on some antiseptic cream, and distract him with something else to do. It's probably not an injury that requires any further treatment then that.    I presume if he was screaming uncontrollably and bleeding all over the place you'd have already called an ambulance, you sound sensible enough. Sounds like a minor flesh wound to me.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Your brother would most likely be screaming in agony if any real damage were done. Best to clean his wound and try to get in contact with your parents.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	is he bleeding? he can't feel anything where?  call your parents or your aunt or something?  if its bad, call 911|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Calm down. No need to panic and call 911 yet. call the local clinic and describe what happened and how he is doing. He may have pinched a nerve. It may also be something simple like swelling or shock causing the loss of feeling.|`|FTW82Wumaa	Call 911 and then try to get ahold of your parents. If you can't, call your aunt, uncle, grandparent, neighbor, anyone close to your family or a relative who can help you out.|`|hThW3ioKaa	I would not call 911 unless it is a REAL emergency! That is expensive and for emergencies only! Don't take those services away from people who REALLY need them!     I would first try to walk over to a neighbor's house and see if you could ask another adult for help, since your parents are not answering the phone. Keep trying to call them until you get a response, as they would surely want to know about this ASAP. However, I do not think an ambulance is needed.|`|6JgKGDK1aa	calll ur parents|`|yYOh0DUjaa	You can't call your parents?  Call the clinic near you and they will ask questions so you can describe it. They will tell you what to do.|`|7STihXONaa	walk over to a nxt door neighbor and ask for hlp|`|cz9dogpvaa	don't call 911 just take the staple out|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	u need to get the staple out and if he can't feel anything he probably hit a nerve or something and u need to call a near by clinic and they can probably help u
C55pji5Qaa	I had menstrual like cramps around when implantation would have been. I did not have implantation bleeding. I did bleed a lot around 7 weeks though. I don't think implantation bleeding is the norm.
iZDsMCghaa	Whats done is done. I commend her for standing up and trying to be responsible but she needs you more than ever now. She's a kid, she was being the usual careless teen and what she thought would never happened, did. So, Its okay for you to be angry,hurt or anything you else you feel but do your best to be as calm as you can, at least in her presence. You can let her know your feeling disappointed but also let her know you will get through it together.    If this were my child (and yes,I am a mother), I would be upset(of course) but I would keep her in school and take care of the baby while she finished school so at the day would come where she would be capable of supporting themselves on f her her own. When school was out, she would be to do her homework and take most care of her little one and nights out would be to a minimum just as with parents of any age but we would get through it and Id do my best to guide her to outside resources.|`|wOIHg0nYaa	Well obviously there is a reason for ur daughters to be doing this. They could have self-esteem issues and may think that the guy really likes them, so she wants him to stay with her, so she uses sex to make this happen. Or, it could be that the guy is forcing this, or maybe they think they love each other but don't realize they're making a big mistake. I mean, I'm going to be honest.... I'm only 14, but I'm still a virgin and I'm just trying to think of rational explanations for ur daughters, especially since I'm around their age. But trust me, hitting them, slapping them, or sending them away won't do any good. They'll just rebel more!! Try talkin it out in a calm way (i know that's hard) but it will show them that u care and want to help them.. I really hope this helped! ^_^|`|htNI5FEaaa	Fact: being too strict will just make them WANT to rebel against you.    As for your daughters; both of them are pregnant.  You have a responsibility as their mother to nurture them, especially through this confusing time of their life.    Parents can't 100% prevent their children from engaging in sexual behavior (even if they think they can).  Prior to this incident, you should have educated them about "safe" sex, and perhaps monitored them a little more efficiently.    As of now, I would let them BOTH know that you are there for them 100%.  Tell them that you don't agree with neither one of their decisions; however, you're happy that everything is in the open now.  I wouldn't encourage abortion, and I would respect the fact that they both want to keep the babies.  You need to just give them all the information you can about pregnancy, and make sure they're safe.    Clearly, they're both going through an immensely difficult time.  For all you know, your 14 year old daughter could be in a competition with your 13  year old, and this is her way of seeking attention.  Put them both in counseling (even yourself - it'll do you good).    Best of luck, and stay strong!!!|`|Mkj1w7n8aa	kill them|`|eDnWMm3maa	Getting mad won't make the problem go away. What's done is done. Like it or not, you're going to be a grandparent. The best you can do is be supportive of her decision. I'm not saying you should let her think her irresponsibility was fine, because it wasn't.. but freaking out on her for it won't solve anything. I know that well adjusted happy healthy smart teenagers DO get pregnant sometimes. But two in one house? Where are they learning to be this way?|`|tOx475R0aa	where do u live?|`|3DIImnDEaa	Just talk to her. My sister got pregnant when she was 13. And i think it was because she wanted to feel loved. There is not a whole lot you can do now (besides have an abortion, which i don't believe in) You can just talk to her, and help her with any questions she may have. She needs a mom more now than ever.|`|64d7116e9576cea4e490b98f53879fa8aa	Love them, that would be the best help. If you punish them or abuse them it will make things very worse.|`|nZPX4ykPaa	You have to remain calm the deed is already done. Is she keeping it?  If so try to help her out but let her know life will never be the same and that now the baby is always first. That she won't be able to do the things she use to do. Let her know her actions were not very responsible.|`|kWBXSjHXaa	First off how the hell is the parenting your doing youhave 2 children under 15 who are fvcking pregnat seriously???  Well i think you should ground them TILL THERE 18 its the mistake and the guy wasnt protected so its There fault AND MOSTLY YOUR! fault. SERIOUSLY?|`|nLXfeQbpaa	I would take her to therapy immediately.   Girls like that have a traumatic experience with a male adult; she wouldn't just do something like that out of no where.  She probably doesn't feel loved enough or she feels alone, thats why she turned to sex.   Don't ship her off, don't make her feel bad, believe me, she feels bad enough. I know its hard but ask her, nicely, what she wants you to do. How can you help? I would definitely make her go see a child psychiatrist|`|ff2144b1a80426ad4335c3e5633a290caa	I think beating them or sending them away isn't the right thing to do at all.   I think maybe you should just sit them down and talk to them, and ask how they expect to raise these babies. Tell them that you're not going to pay for them, so they have to get a job.   If they were responsible enough to get pregnant then they should be responsible enough to get a job too.   Other than that, tell them the only thing you'll be giving their children is grandmotherly love, and the only thing they'll be getting from you is advice and motherly love.   This is what I would do, simply because I don't believe in 'sending away' your children or beating them.

LOL    Anyway here is my opinions and questions. Feel free to email me the answers as I am very much interested in your parenting techniques.     Did you ever give them the sex talk? not like boys and girls like each other and wish for babies.. Like the whole penis and reactions, and diseases, and vaginas, stds, birth controls, locations of planned parenthoods, free clinics, doctors being confidential and wont even tell parents when kids get birth control and plan b, how sex on periods still gets you pregnant, how dry humping can also cause pregnancy though the chance is low, etc. You need to be thorough and ask them if they have any questions.  And how its ok to talk about these things.. Bring up the last time you had sex, bring up your first times, your mistakes, how can they learn from yours with out you telling them yours first? (Not saying you made any but its true) The School DOES NOT teach this in depth sex ed. They teach abstinence which drives the teen pregnancy rates up. They need to be taught these things. I think an open line of communication even if its awkward and embarrassing for EITHER of you will help so much. Talk about how many sexual partners you have had, so they will be more open with you.. Just talking. If they think they are old enough to have sex they need to be old enough to taught the consequences of their actions along with proper sexual education practices on your part.  SO I am not sure if you ever had this discussion with them, but I bet you feel like you should have.. They need to know Condoms and Birth Control is FREE and being lazy, uneducated, poor, or stupid is not an excuse. SO I am sorry you have to go through this. but GOOD Luck being a grandma!! And You will get through this.|`|nzHtrczVaa	http://www.livescience.com/health/070424...      Kids with religious parents are better behaved and adjusted than other children, according to a new study that is the first to look at the effects of religion on young child development.  The conflict that arises when parents regularly argue over their faith at home, however, has the opposite effect.  John Bartkowski, a Mississippi State University sociologist and his colleagues asked the parents and teachers of more than 16,000 kids, most of them first-graders, to rate how much self control they believed the kids had, how often they exhibited poor or unhappy behavior and how well they respected and worked with their peers.  The researchers compared these scores to how frequently the childrens parents said they attended worship services, talked about religion with their child and argued abut religion in the home.  The kids whose parents regularly attended religious servicesespecially when both parents did so frequentlyand talked with their kids about religion were rated by both parents and teachers as having better self-control, social skills and approaches to learning than kids with non-religious parents.  But when parents argued frequently about religion, the children were more likely to have problems. Religion can hurt if faith is a source of conflict or tension in the family, Bartkowski noted.  Why so good?  Bartkowski thinks religion can be good for kids for three reasons. First, religious networks provide social support to parents, he said, and this can improve their parenting skills. Children who are brought into such networks and hear parental messages reinforced by other adults may also take more to heart the messages that they get in the home, he said.  Secondly, the types of values and norms that circulate in religious congregations tend to be self-sacrificing and pro-family, Bartkowski told LiveScience. These could be very, very important in shaping how parents relate to their kids, and then how children develop in response, he said.|`|04bc2c48d79f30c010ba500a390cb62daa	I have a feeling YOU will taking care of the kids.Good luck w/ that.

Also for school reputaitons. If they are determined on keeping the kids then I suggest training them as best you can and making sure they both take their tests and everything. Is adoption an option for their future kids? Find out who the father is by d and a test. Take away both of their cell phones. Ground them until at least both babies are born. They should be homeschooled to avoid torment and other issues.|`|ZLLTSCJzaa	I don't know if you've seen "The Secret Life Of The American Teenager", but if you haven't, you might want to try watching it. It might be helpful.    In that situation, I would suggest you stay calm because she's probably just as scared as you are, and she told you because she was looking for guidance. Many teenagers get pregnant, and the last thing they need is someone to yell at them for what they can't change.    If you're very much against her having the baby, talk to her about getting an abortion, or about having the child and putting it up for adoption. You should talk to her about safe sex, if she's already had it, there's a good chance she isn't going to stop. Put her on birth control after the baby is born.. Or if you choose the other method.    You don't need to yell at her, but you should talk to her and explain that you're there for her, tell her that you're going to be there for her and help her through it.    She's 14 years old, she's probably mortified. Just stay calm.|`|ze7HgH19aa	WOW. Get them to seriously consider adoption and try to get them to finish high school.

Grounding them or hitting them isnt going ot do anything they are still children and they are going to have babies.  They are no where near emotionally capable of caring for a baby at that age and going to need alot of help from you.  Support them and show them that you love them even tho they made a huge mistake and just be there to help them through this very difficult time for them.  A  good thing to do was put them on birth control as soon as you thought they were sexually active would have been a good idea.  You cant stop them from having sex but you could have possibly prevent a pregnancy but its too late for that now all you can do is support them and help them as much as you possibly can.  My sister had a baby at 15 and she turned out just fine but she had alot of support from the family when she got pregnant|`|O34ts37maa	ummm take them to a clinic and get them tested for STD's  its not your fault  remember that  your kids are just retarded  hold you anger back and hit a pillow  gppd thing you did not hit tham  good doggy|`|t03zPR4Saa	you should support them you don't know how hard it is to have an bad mom  my mom sold me and treated me like trash and tried to use me for money i was a good child and was treated like trash You should support her and see if she wants to to keep them make her get a job remember to be a grandma not a mom to them and love the they might have felt like they needed to find love somewhere else|`|EGaEZ06Iaa	wow im really sorry u have to deal with this... i think that u should talk to both of them about adoption.. since they have their whole life ahead of them.. but i think that u should let them go through the whole thing and then let them decide... u could check out the show The Secret Life Of The American Teenager .... it may help     really Truly sorry|`|X88lyKHoaa	darn|`|AKFtOVeQaa	You can't punish her at this time.

I am 14, i don't have a child or anything, and i am not sexually active yet, but i would be pretty embarrassed to tell my parents that i am sexually active and pregnant, so you should be quite thankful the girls haven't ran away and gave birth behind your back. Plus, its quite hard not to become sexually active nowadays, as there is a lot of influences in films, tv and music and a lot of peer pressure from friends.   I think you should support them, i mean, when you became a parent, you were expected Support them what ever they did, right? If my mum abandoned me if i pregnant i would never ever talk to her ever again, disown her and just make sure she has nothing to do with mine or baby's life, she left me in my time of need and i would never forgive someone from doing that, and don't really want to lose your children-no matter what they have done.  Support the =)|`|UUpsa35Daa	I understand you're upset...but violence is never the answer.    Sit down and have a talk with her, ground her...restrict her. But talk with her, don't just go off on a violent rampage.|`|UspK4SQBaa	So both of your children are pregnant?    Honestly, I'm having trouble believing your story, but if it;s true, I think you should allow their grandparents or someone a little more qualified to care for them.|`|rRceaE4Maa	Um..Uh...Wow! Have you ever watched "Secret Life of the American Teenager"? That may help! A lot! I have no idea what to say! I'm 14 and I'm not even thinking about that stuff..so wow! But they are probably terrified! At least I hope they are! Maybe you should call planned parenthood! Just love them, they probably need it right now! Don't listen to all those ppl who say your a bad mother.....everyone makes mistakes...including your daughters. Here are some words of wisdom to help you ( my favorite)    Never let the fear of striking out  keep you from playing the game    You guys are just gonna be going through some bad times. You'll get through it ! Good luck and I really hope I helped! :)    Okay, P.S, sry I just read your additional details. Even though they are excited now, they could be hiding their feelings and I really don't think they will be excited still in a couple months, so ya.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Here's the great thing, they're both minors which means you can force them to do pretty much whatever you want them too. Of course they think it's funny now, but they won't in a few months. So, if abortion is out of the question (although I'd give it some thought) it's time make them pay for their mistakes, it's time to simulate motherhood. Which means you make them act like the mothers of newborns. Wake them up 3 times a night with a screaming alarm clock and don;t let them go back to sleep until you think the baby would have stopped crying. Start making them do 2 loads of laundry a day and cooking meals and everything else. Don't let them out of the house whatsoever, they have kids now, and since they don;t work they can;t afford a baby sitter. Yeah, it's going to be a pain for you but with any luck it'll be enough to show them they don't want to be parents right now.    Then once you give the kids up for adoption send them to an all girls super strict boarding school. At least then you don't have to worry about them coming home preggers again.|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	you have your hands full|`|FcNOkHquaa	Take them to alabama or wherever that hospital is where you can drop your kids off, if she's pregnant she went too far....i wouldn't know what to do...    /m|`|pVUhlg4iaa	get my belt|`|AA12223669	I would let them both have the children - although they're underage, they're closer to being 18 than they are to their birthdates. If this is the life they've chosen for themselves (without knowing better) allow them to see what they've gotten themselves into.    These babies will help them grow up much faster and stop making such stupid decisions. But if you take their children away from them, they'll hate you forever and probably won't ever forgive you.|`|UH67GysTaa	That is horrible. I don't know I would make them go away and learn their lesson. They will understand you love them but try to talk them into putting it for adoption there are many couples world wide who would love a child and 13 and 14 year olds are not them. Im sorry good luck =]|`|Y6TDCkaYaa	well i think you havnt done a very good job of raising your kids. I bet you yelled at them a lot. which isnt the way.and yelling at them probably isnt the way to fix it either. try making them pay rent at their own house if they want to feel like adults and when they see how impossible that is then they might come back to your care.    it was on George Lopez so yeah
KvvpePBNaa	There is possibly 2 things I can think of. The first is that he is not well, is he pulling his legs up with a pain, is he running a temp or could ge possibly teething? If you think it may be any of these you could try a little panadol & keep an eye on him. Or it may be the start of night terrors. My kids had them when they were little. It's not actually a nightmare as they seem awake but they are actually still asleep & very inconsolable. Finally when I worked it out I found not picking them up worked best, just rub their back & a gentle pat to let him know you are there. I also found that putting a Tshirt in the cot that I had been wearing that had my scent on gave us less night terrors. Just remember he may seem awake but actually isn't & by lifting him up will wake him up properly & he will have no idea what is going on. Good Luck!|`|EMKuBql8aa	Could be teething or he is getting sick.     It should pass in a couple days if it is just teething.|`|1F7eYuNWaa	My guess would be teething pains.  It really seems to hurt them while they are sleeping.  When they are up and playing they don't notice it as much.
MoaIQPvCaa	I am afraid that the name is a little long and complicated for most Americans. If you would use Shaquandra instead of Shaquanzia, that would actually shorten the name by one syllable.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	No way....no one will be able to say it, for instance if they called her to the office in school the person would mess it up like Shakwanzeea Ojanay or something. Plus she won't be able to spell it herself.|`|5c5e9767db0aa6f5bac57f3e406b4092aa	she'll have a hard time spelling her name in first grade. maybe something simpler|`|AA10405438	Way too difficult to spell and pronounce.  But if you like it, go for it.|`|2TDBlBbNaa	I think it will bring her a lot of inconveniences later on, and that it will take her a while to remember to how to write it as well.|`|AOkucu5haa	I think you're kidding...|`|AA10166553	Thats a name?|`|RlKGif3raa	I think she'll have a hard time finding a good job. Real talk dont take it personal you asked.|`|3ShtRhIEaa	keep the unique style of the name by making ur own like haelin (heyylynn) or tae ko (tayy  coe)|`|j4ZUfDBjaa	LOL. You wish for the baby girl to grow up to be a stripper, right?|`|3e6432db7575d4f57df25665d3a6be20aa	It's pretty|`|7adzqyGgaa	OMG that name is whats up! i love it! its to pretty!
vGxipYJnaa	It would hurt a bit, yes.    It's very time consuming - you have to visit a clinic many times a week to get injections for at least a month before harvesting any eggs. You can't have sex during that time either.     There is a small risk you could become infertile - and there are other risks, too. You need to be very well informed before making this decision.|`|UH67GysTaa	there are risks. going on www.webmd.com|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Its a medical procedure.  As with all medical procedures, there are risks.  If its something you are seriously considering, talk to your gynecologist about it first.  There are certain requirements that you'd have to meet before you could start the whole process.    **You mean infertile?  Yes, there is a small chance that you could become infertile because of the procedure.  The procedure is also uncomfortable.  Not painful exactly, just uncomfortable.  Like someone else said, its also a lot of work.  You don't just walk in and they take a few eggs, there is a lot of "prep work".  You have to get hormone injections, lots of lab work, lots of exams..... its worth it though if its something you really want to do.|`|M952ut9Zaa	It is very safe dude.|`|o503YPrqaa	I don't think there are any severe consequences.. I might want to do that .. but I don't want my face all over the world! IM ugly! haha! I think there is a small risk like any procedure.. Im sure the risk is worth the action. You are doing something nice, helping other families who cant have babies have babies, and you are also getting paid quite nicely.
CxRJwJsraa	Halima- I said this instantly as hah-LEE-muh, and thought it looked Arabic.    Halimah- for some reason that H takes aways the Arabic feel to me, and also makes me want to say it as hah-LY-muh or ha-lee-MAH    Haleema- This does make the pronunciaiton more obvious, but feels like a creative spelling. It also visually reminds me of the word Harlem.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	I like the original spelling.|`|9FOHmjN3aa	I like it the way it is!|`|tyqN6qBUaa	I like Halima the best out of those three.|`|gijJtZTWaa	I think she should keep it!|`|OnDIrxNEaa	Halima is pretty.|`|UIa6R91naa	i like it the way it is.|`|AOkucu5haa	I like the original spelling.|`|j4ZUfDBjaa	Well, which spelling is legit? IMO, unless a name doesn't have any official spelling, a person is supposed to spell it the traditional way.
wKJrZhj3aa	YAY!! Congrats on ur daughters big 1 year celebration coming up. My baby is turning one in MAY and we are already planning. Actually, I am also going with a "princess" theme. Its just to cute to pass up dressing her in a princess dress!!!   Well you have to consider when the party will be. Are there any nice parks by you?  Or you could find a rec center to have it at. That would make the decorating easier. I would skip the games. If most of the kids are 1-2 years old, I dont think they are gonna have the attention span or interest to sit around and wait to take turns. I've decided not to have them. I think we are going to do hotdogs and hamburgers as the main dishes with lots of salads, ie, fruit and such for sides. With so many younger kids, it seems easier and more practical.   HAVE FUN!!!!!!|`|70AGy17eaa	you could have it at your own house if its big enough for the games I think you should skip
vsuXCMqzaa	Go by your instincts and what your baby is telling you. My baby was 3 months old and waking up every hour to eat at night and wanting to eat every 1 to 2 hours during the day. At first I thought she was just increasing my milk suppy as I breastfed but when my milk came in HUGE and she was still eating a ton I decided she needed a bit of extra. After I gave her her first cereal feeding by spoon, she was so happy!    So just go by instincts and what your baby is telling you and you'll be fine.|`|eDnWMm3maa	No solids before six months.    Honestly though, I never bothered with rice cereal. It's just empty carbs. The first food he had was mashed avocado and he loved it. Brain food!|`|gJrHBtp1aa	Brady started at 4 months, Lavina at 6. It all depends when the baby is ready.|`|jn34aSgHaa	i gave my son baby cereal since he was 2 months and a half. but it really depends on the appetite of the baby and what you want to do. plus he was 10 lbs when he was born so he was a really big baby|`|E047GSKdaa	3 months.  My childs doc asked about sleeping habits.  I told her my baby could not sleep more than 4 hours at a time.  She said try rice before bed to fill his tummy.  It worked!  A lot of her opinions are a little different than the "experts".  She says a lot of "experts" are men that never raised a baby 24/7.  Sometimes Old Wives Tales are right.|`|BUI9HnH1aa	my son was 16 weeks .  i didn't put it in his bottle as he was fine taking it of the spoon . He loved it! every single bit of it went in his mouth , i don't think he wanted to waste a drop , lol.   I gave him pureed apple after about 6 days on cereal as he hadn't done a poo yet ( i didn't want him to get to constipated)|`|olF9Hl6saa	My son was a very big baby and seemed to never have enough to eat. I began giving him rice cereal at 2 months at night before putting him to bed.|`|qgimQqhmaa	i tried it first at 3 months... but he wasnt ready...i would say try between 4-6 months.|`|DLDweOcYaa	4 months old|`|ZRNlwu5laa	4 months and the only reason was because my daughter had reflux and needed it. Other wise I would have waited until 6 months.|`|4iXL4C6paa	4 months|`|4Dc44BC5aa	About 3.5 months, just check with the Dr first.|`|SkCnQHceaa	My son never liked cereal or any baby food. He never liked any of the textures. we went straight to solids like Kix and Cheerioes and cooked carrots at 6 months exactly.|`|701FO16zaa	4.5 mths with my first becaue he obviously wasnt getting enough from his milk.. ask the doctor if you are concerned I asked mine and all babies are diferent. only start them on very little, mixed with breastmilk or formula|`|Ka52nbhNaa	We started at just a week shy of 5 months - our twins were born low birth weight at 37 weeks and were not quite ready to start earlier.|`|42Ttd1UAaa	4.5 mths|`|27aea472b3667b064c6f98d70ac05c5caa	I started when both of my babies were no longer satisfied with just milk. My son was 4 months and my daughter was 6 months. The very best answer will come from your baby, he/she will have a way of telling you that it's time for cereal. Just don't put it in a bottle.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	a week bfore 4 months   he showed ll the signs that he was ready so i went for it|`|8kaDm2D8aa	4 months, but then it constipated her, so i stopped.  then at 5 months i just started baby food, no cereal.|`|cv0foxlTaa	At 5.5 months.|`|n3IoftMFaa	Never. I started solids at   6 months, honestly.
X9JSlC6Iaa	At a OBGYN not a regular doctor. Before that did she use protection?   Tell her to take a test at home before going to the obgyn.|`|Lftu0e4Daa	Ok well nobody can tell you what the chances are of her being pregnant without a little more information. For instance was is protected or unprotected, did she use a condom and if she did, did she check to see if the condom broke? Is she on birth control and if she is did she stick to it or skip a day? Has she been taking medication that could render the birth control useless? When did she have sex, was it right before her period or right after her period? How long is her cycle and is it normally on time? If you know all of these then you can calculate her ovulation date (the time that she is most likely to get pregnant). So when you can figure all of that out, post it and then I'll get back to you. As far as getting tested from like a real doctor, im not sure what you mean by that. im sure that what you are trying to say is a blood test. You can go to a clinic for that.|`|zHRWklEWaa	I don't know what her chances of being pregnant are without knowing her cycle, however she can get tested at any doctor, clinic, or just buy a pregnancy test at a drug store.|`|AA11468869	family doctors can check it,too.
IxG2SMlEaa	Hey there. It all depends on how long your cycle is and if thats the time you were ovulating. It's best to have sex before, during, and after ovulation to cover enough time. But u may pregnant still given u had unprotected sex...Good luck and baby dust to u!|`|2nfMSDiPaa	Hey hun wait until you miss your period!!  Baby dust to you!!Good luck!!may God bless you with a child!    Take care|`|36TU9oMwaa	If you have a 28 day cycle, then you should be most fertile around the 30th. So get offline and go show your boyfriend some love :) You should have sex tonight, tomorrow, and friday.    Have fun, Good Luck and Baby Dust|`|lhn1wNoeaa	yes its too early to test.. wait till you missed your periods..
WcvsBgLuaa	That could be implantion bleeding.  So yes, maybe.
RLbN2Ujhaa	I was breastfeeding, and very thin so I think I never had enough estrogen to start my period while I was nursing, but my history is as follows:   1 nursed to 15 months, got my first AF 1 month after weaning   2 nursed to 24 months, got my first AF 2 months after weaning   3 nursed to 24 months, got my first AF when she was 20 months old (strangely, 4 months before I weaned that one! she didn't nurse all night long like 1&2 so that was probably it)|`|qYbFMRcUaa	about 6 weeks.|`|ghUExPxgaa	mine started about 2 1/2 months after having baby. I stopped breast feeding at 4 1/2 weeks as we wanted to start trying for another baby and i wanted to get my period. If you breast feed for longer, you probably wont get your period for longer. It took approx 3-4 weeks after stopping feeding to get my period|`|tDuMsa1daa	I had my period approx 6-8 weeks after giving birth to both of my children.  My 1st one, I thought I was hemorrhaging!!|`|YJNql5Mgaa	Well, I got onto regular birth control pills since I *couldn't* breastfeed (medical, thank you BF Nazis) and got it about 2 months after she was born.
KXPyWB5maa	Sounds correct. As generally you ovulate and if the egg is not fertilised your period would start aproximately 14 days after which would mean a 26 day cycle. However if you are trying to conceive dont rely on dates go with base temp monitoring and cervical mucus (indicators of ovulation) as you dont always ovulate at the same time.  Good luck|`|PKHZNS1Paa	sounds about right!
4YqL4iCcaa	You are right...fixing her pb sandwitches everyday is not a good thing. Give her whatever you made for yourself and your husband. She will not starve herself, make sure there is food provided for her at breakfast lunch and dinner (duh). If you give in she will grow up to be a picky eater...and nobody likes that!     Good Luck and remember that she will eventually eat. Also, do not let her up from the table until she has taken three bites, maybe she will realize that the food is not so bad afterall and will eat.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	My daughter isnt at that stage yet. But I remember when I was little and if we didnt eat what my mom gave us we didnt get anything else and when we woke up hungry she would reheat what we had for dinner and that is what we had to eat. She always told us that she wasnt going to spend all day in the kitchen fixing what each of us kids wanted. So we got what she fixed or we got nothing. The same rule is going to apply for my daughter. Me and my husband are planning on having more kids and I figured it would be easier if I set that rule as well as my mother did. I would keep doing what you are doing it is going to be hard but she will get the picture that your not going to give in. My mom always thought it was some kind of power struggle. Good Luck!|`|lYE34CVTaa	Always provide the food and if she doesn't want to eat then ok. Like she said above, children won't let them selves starve. If she gets hungry she will eat.|`|J4AyTTZ3aa	Here is a great article on fussy eaters.  http://www.parentingaustralia.com.au/con...    It sounds like you have the right idea though!|`|qaseVWMJaa	my son is 4 also he is very picky eater.all my son would eat is soup.i talked to the doc she said as long as hes eating something dont worry.  shell eventually eat.as long as shes eating. peanut butter is protein.she'll be ok                          keep us updated|`|WKgDpBR5aa	ok  set the plate in front of her  and eat ur dinner  when ur done if she hasnt finished or atean anything  throw hers away and send her to do something  she normalley does after dinner  she can and will go a night without eating  once she gets hungry enough she will eat|`|49We7buoaa	My son use to do this to me all the time, I'd always give in and make the PB sandwhich for his sake I didn't want him to be hungry, but after a few days I started giving him a choice I'd say ok you can eat what mommy made for dinner or you can go to bed with nothing to eat He soon chose what I made for dinner.    Good Luck :-)
hR1EVzjIaa	Hop on a plane and get yourself to New York...it is dang cold...we can take a road-trip to Ellie's and Syds....you will cool off right quick!|`|7SKVCPcSaa	as little clothes as possible. and if you don't want to take them outside.. fill the bath tub up with cool water and let them splash around in that.|`|nfzQkvqraa	Put them in a cool bath.  Let them pretend they're at the beach.  If they get involved enough I'm sure they'll start splashing and then you'll get wet too.|`|5EOLbVzQaa	where the heck are you living? it is cold here in Oklahoma!|`|28HLij60aa	You could pop the kids in a bath of cool water to help them cool off a little...in the meantime, don't give the kids any drinks with sugar in them as the sugar can dehydrate them. (Fizzy or soft drinks, etc.)     Can you not take them anywhere thats going to be cool (my mum used to take me to the local shopping mall when it was really hot out as it was air conditioned in there.)     We used to just spend a little time in there in the soft play section where it was a lovely steady temperature and wasn't boring for us all.|`|382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	Yeah, I feel your pain, phew!  Do what I do, give the kids a spray bottle of water each, and let them spray the heck out of each other. Keeps them amused, and cool. Bonus!|`|IxP2IMbcaa	Throw them in the bathtub.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	splash your face with cold water and sit infront of a fan      or for a long term fix  drink hot chocolate  (sounds mad but just listen)  it will temporarly raise your body temperature so that once the hot choc cools inside you  you will notice a drop in temperate. even though your only returning to the temp you are now youl feel cooler    other than that cold showers  ice drinks   splash cold water and stand infront of the open freezer|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Keep the blinds closed  Fans  Cold Clothes|`|1BddUQxIaa	gurl...i envy you! i'm stuck here in ohio...literally! it is like living in an never ending shaking snow globe. last week was below zero, now it's 20 degrees farenheit. all i've been doing is shoveling.|`|W8UZebRWaa	Yes move here, it's freezing with a foot of snow.  You could strip the babbys down and feed them ice. Or you could give them lots of cold medicine, they won't notice they are hot when they are asleep.|`|rAkWoweOaa	If you don't mind me asking, where are you! lol!! Definitely over seas! Anyways, joking aside, you can put regular rubbing alcohol in a tub of cool water and it will cool you off in a jiffy.|`|snUDfcfgaa	I am truly sorry for your hots.
aJLx0nhNaa	I would answer you but I can't hear you because my 7 month old is shrieking at the top of his voice with glee. ;) Yeah, totally, ear-splittingly normal.|`|3klIx1Egaa	my 3 1/2 month old son does the same, hurts the ears sometimes, but yes its normal.|`|0viZhxi6aa	Yep. Just wait til he starts talking back in about 5 years! LOL But seriously my son does the same thing. He loves it when we do it back.|`|iTXnHiwTaa	My daughter does it after I've laid her in her bed to sleep. She screeches like a cat!!  It comes from the back of her throat - I'm like "ouch, stop that, doesn't that hurt?" She hasn't gotten hoarse - yet. Its cute and funny though, they've learned something new and keep doing it! lol|`|6Zdfx7QOaa	I have a 5 1/2 month old too!! She loves to squeal, particularly in the morning as my wake up call. It is so cute.|`|mvHs43Ldaa	Absolutely, my 7 month old does it all the time, not that he has lost his voice from it yet but pretty close. I've also talked to Plunket about it and they say it's normal too :) He has gone in stages too, it started with squealing then changed to noises like Dada, mumma, bubba, but now it's back to the squealing, I think it's so amusing :)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	LOL  yeah, probably normal, he's finding out what kind of noises he can make; my gal comes up with new ones all the time; last week it was growling; this week it is clicking her tongue from the roof of her mouth....:)
kKD0m7qUaa	If your friend is sexually active - then it is possible she is pregnant.  The only way to find out is to take a home pregnancy test or go to the doctors to have a test done.    Her symptoms seem very vague to me?  She had her period last week, but is now spotting.  This can be for various reasons.  She really needs to go see a doctor.  There are many symptoms of pregnancy that be be related to something else.  A home pregnancy test will confirm this.    As for the birth control pills.  No your parent does not have to be present to get birth control pills from the doctor.  Doctors do not tell parents that the child consulted them for birth control.  That is how it is here in NY.  I cannot say how it is in other states.  Now if you use your parents insurance plan then they may find out this way.    You dont need a parents signature at Planned Parenthood at pretty much any age and they're really good about maintaining privacy.  They also give free condoms :-)    Good luck|`|ywXXwhgdaa	You dont have to have your parent with you when you go to the doctor, I went when I was 17 and your parents dont have to find out unless you tell them.|`|mtQVAilpaa	Yeah it definitely to early to tell if shes pregnant, its best to wait for a miss period, but you can google your nearest health department to get tested and get on the pill. I went when i was 17 and they gave me a year supply with no promblem.|`|afSqgYBZaa	Your friend might just have gastroenteritis (a nasty flu bug going around right now). MOST pregnant women do not get a period and then spotting. Have her take a home pregnancy test or go see the doctor.    As for the question about birth control pills, I don't know if policy varies from office to office, but I didn't need parental consent and my parents never found out.|`|AA11763588	Most symptoms will not start to show till between weeks 4 - 6. Perhaps she is just sick, it seems to early if she just got off her period to be having any symptoms.    As for the BC question, I don't know. I didn't start having sex till I was 18 and went to Planned Parenthood to get mine.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	She's probably just sick with a stomach virus.  If she had her period last week, then its highly likely that she's NOT pregnant.  If she has sex now though, then it is likely that she could get pregnant since she's near ovulation.  From last month though?  No, she's probably not pregnant.    If she goes to her family doctor, then obviously the parents would find out when they got the insurance bill.  The doctor can't legally call and tell them though.  If she wants to anonymously get on birth control without the consent of her parents, then she needs to go to a clinic of some sort.  Planned parenthood or your local health department.|`|LXK8ktGOaa	ok she could be .... get a test and no she can go to the doctors on her own  and they are not allowed by law to tell her parents anything she says not to ... also they can give her a blood test there and tell her for free ... my friend went n now shes 8 months lmao so look into it... and you can still get spotting when your prego  goodluck lol she would have had to have had sex after her period ... your very fertile after your period ...new egg drops|`|FA710vETaa	it sounds like she is..... but she should get a test to know for sure    and you can go to planned parent hood and get it for free and your parents never have to know about it...ever!|`|FfeKzUycaa	It doesn't mean she's pregnant, but it does mean she needs to use protection for many reasons.  A baby will be the least of her worries.  Make sure you ladies take care of yourself out there.  Don't ruin the rest of your life for one night of pleasure.  Get the pills, but use protection because the pills won't protect you from diseases.|`|4KdC9gwLaa	1. If she's already pregnant, birth control pills won't kill the baby.   2. She might be, but you would need a PT to find out.   Best of luck, and congrats to hear your friend is expecting!  That must be exciting news! ^-^|`|cIROBuszaa	It will show in the insurance bill.   She could be pregnant.

This will be his/her name FOREVER. It will be his/her name at 20, 30, 50, 90. So make it some thing good that other people will also accommodate to. Nothing unusual, or difficult to spell, or pronounce.|`|uj1A73ZGaa	I like Sophie but not Lee for a middle name. Liam Shaun is very nice.

8aXDhia7aa	I certainly know what you mean about being too tired.  Before we were trying, we were about the once a fortnight mark simply because we just didn't have any energy when we got home from work.  So when we decided to start trying we knew it would be exhausting.  I'll admit we were lucky and that it didn't take us long, so I can't pretend I know how hard it is after 8 or more months. The first month we went hell for leather every night from about a week after my AF until a few days before I expected it.  Just in case...  No luck and I had no EWCM.  This month I charted my temps and that, mixed with an abundance of EWCM (which I put down to increased drinking of water and taking pregnacare vitamins), we basically did nothing until around the right time (I had a week of EWCM and we tried every day for a few days before that and a few days after it stopped).  It was difficult and my hubby was almost begging NOT to have sex   Any chance you could do it in the morning or do you get straight up for work?  Saturday mornings are always the best time for us, after we've had a bit of a lie in and aren't so tired.  Good luck!!!!|`|hlq3Eo0haa	it took me 4 yrs to fall pregnant, try not having sex for 14 days after u start your period and that also means he is not allowed to masturbate, then go for it. . good luck it is very saddening but fingers crossed that u have a baby in your arms next year or maybe for christmas|`|GeQs0nvYaa	The thing that I've heard most of all, is really to quit thinking about it so much. I know it's really hard when you HAVE to do it, rather than just doing with when the mood is right, but it can be fun. If you start thinking about it in more of the sense of connecting with your partner, and "love-making" (if you will) and not so much "baby-making" it might be easier (it was for me). Everyone is different and I know how hard it can be to conceive, and keep the mood up, but if you stress about it, it seems like it's less likely to happen. Try to make it romantic and really intimate. Light some candles, put on some music or lingerie or do whatever gets you going. Hopefully your husband is supportive and will get into it too. Hope this helps and best of luck to you!|`|RPszYGXkaa	Well generally, to help with "overdoing it" lol, we start trying around day 10 of my cycle and continue every other day, for a few days after I get a positive OPK.  Anything other than that is just for fun!    Baby dust!|`|yCR6qg0baa	Every day? You don't have to have sex that much. It only takes ONE sperm to get pregnant. And sperm can live inside your body for 3-5 days. It's important for you to know when you're ovulating. You can use OPK's, chart your BBT, or even chart your cervical mucus (CM). You don't need to have sex so much... esp. after you ovulate b/c you can't get pregnant again until your next cycle.     As for keeping it from getting stale, don't think of it as "baby making". Just spend time with your husband. I mean, what is the difference between thinking "Oh, I'm doing this to make a baby" or actually enjoying it? You can get pregnant with either mindset. But with one, you'll actually enjoy it =) The average married couple has sex 3 times a week-- that's plenty. Leave the science out of it. It will happen when it's meant to happen.|`|la8W09sFaa	during your ovulation you need to let him build of sperm for a few days before and have sex everyother day until your cervical mucus is gone. for the rest of the month just have fun. baby dancing is supposed to be fun, but can be stresful when u r doing it for the purpose of reproducing. just relax, your time will come. baby dust 2 u !!!|`|AA11185897	1. Have sex & masturbate less often - the more times you ejaculate, the less dense your semen will be. Maintain a gap of 3 days between two consecutive ejaculations.    ok, I was doing some research myself last week and found this helpful information. There are many places that say the same thing here is one of them   http://ezinearticles.com/?10-Ways-You-Ca...|`|6QfQVuPuaa	three ladies says it all!!
UUpsa35Daa	It depends on the reasoning. I think it's ridiculous for parents to get anyone under 15 a phone just so they can have a phone. And even then, all the phone HAS to do is call people. Maybe text. They don't need internet or mp3 players on there. If they want those on there, then they can pay for it all themselves.    But if they have a real reason then i can understand it. My mom got me a cell phone in 5th grade because i was having a lot of health problems that could've gone from bad to worse really easily. My mom worked out of state and the school wouldn't let me call long distance should anything happen. So she gave me the phone and told me to only use it in case of emergency. It was off most of the time and the only time i had it out of my back pack was to charge it at night. It was a simple nokia phone the could call and text...that was it.    Now at 17, i do have a blackberry and did have a razr and am still under my mom's contract since i can't sign one quite yet but i've been paying my entire bill since i was 15 years old. I got the blackberry because it's just easier to keep track of everything when you're always on the run and have a hectic schedule. It was my choice to get so of course, i'm paying for it and everything that goes with it.    I volunteered to pay my bill but i think if teens were forced to pay theirs, they would have a whole other opinion about what kind of phones they "need".|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	YES! I know a 7 year old with a cell phone why would any 7 year old need a cell phone??? I was 15 when I got mine and my mom thought it would be unfair for her to get me one without getting my sisters one. They were 8 and 13. Its so dumb that they have them. All my sisters would do is run the bill up. Now we have to have unlimited everything because my sisters can't shut up. Then my mom yells at me wondering why her bill is 350 dollars a month and I pay 50 dollars of it. Which is how much it costs to have me on it.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	My aunt and uncle bought prepaid ones for their kids - 7 and 12.  they can't buy their own groceries but can afford mins for their kids phones, but i digress.  the point  - they actually text the kids to come eat instead of talking.  really?  i think that is silly.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Mine will have one as soon as they go to friends houses without me...so at around 9 or 10...that is when most kids are able to go to the corner shop alone with friends..and they may need the phone tocontact me.|`|awXx7N2baa	it is ridiculous and some have texting .. but some kids have to have them cause there parents are never home which make sence. I got one at the end of 5th grade ..|`|rAkWoweOaa	Most definitely!! My stepdaughter has had one forever. My hubby just bought her a bb storm, now our bill is $220 a mo. Crazy right?!|`|AA11828439	Poor parenting!|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	well I'm one of those parents who you would think is CRAZY.  My kids have cell phones, which they don't take to school or use very often.  There is a "home" for the phones at our house and usually during the week they phones don't leave their "home".  The phones are in this "home" every night too, so the kids really have no access unless we know. ALSO, we have the phones set so that calls made or received must be part of the contact list, and we set up the contact list ourselves, so no chatting with strangers or "unapproved" peeps. The kids are too busy with school, extra curricular etc. but if I drop them off somewhere, and they have that phone, I feel A WHOLE LOT BETTER knowing I can call them or text them and get an immediate update.  What did parents do before cell phones??????????????|`|GWRP3vLQaa	It depends on how young the kids are and what the phone is being used for.     If the child is just using the phone for texting and blabbing with friends, they don't need one.     If the phone is being used to stay in contact with his/her parents it's okay.    If the child is old enough to drive or be out on his/her own I'd want him/her to have a phone in case he/she got in a jam and needed to call me.|`|aa596673c4a4b7827a51695b15eb9ae8aa	I work in an elementary school and I'd say over half of the kids have cell phones.  Most moms/dads/guardians tell the kids to keep them in their backpacks they are for emergencies or pick up after school etc.  Most keep them in their pockets and they play games on them like at lunch etc.  I really don't see the need but most parents must.|`|EPaYoJaiaa	I completely agree. This is how technology starts to ruin humanity. When we were all that age we didn't need cell phones. If we went out and needed to use a phone we used a home phone or a pay phone...those are still around I've seen them. It limits their actual interaction with each other and does absolutely nothing to teach them real responsibility (obviously a 9 year old can't be paying for her own phone she can't get a job for another 7 years) A cell phone is a privilege not a right, they should get it when they're 16 and can pay for it themselves (meaning they have a job)|`|838VJJGvaa	Yeah 9 is way too young.  I'm 15 and when I was nine cell phones weren't even cool.  They were huge and expensive.  I didn't get my first one until 6th grade.  It was a really cheap one too and I only used it to call my mom after practice.  My cell phone doesn't even work and I still have the same one since sixth grade.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Yup.  I don't understand it.  I'm 25 years old and still don't have the 'need' for a cell phone.  What's a necessity to one person isn't the same for everyone else though I guess.  I just can't imagine what a 9 year old girl would be out doing, alone, that she'd need a cell phone to call home.  Shouldn't a 9 year old child still be directly supervised by their parents?!  Its not like their driving and need a phone in case they get a flat.  They aren't running off to the mall by themselves.  lol  I just don't understand it.|`|yYOh0DUjaa	Well, I think that you should have a cell phone for emergencies only when you are young. Something inexpensive with no texting or anything. When you reach 13, then I think it is okay to have a cell phone to talk to people and text if you are paying for it.|`|5NsgLFPRaa	OMG yes!  It's waste of money lol  like who the **** are they going to call?  Mommy or Daddy?  it's so annoying!  I am 16 turning 17 and I still haven't had a cellphone before    I think they're so overrated these days, especially TEXTING|`|GTwVNeHraa	Oh yeah I've seen 3rd graders with cell phones.|`|1o820L3Daa	yeah I do, they cant even get there head around how much those phone calls they make cost, and no way can they pay for the call.s I don't think they should have a phone at all till high school, even a bit later about 15...Here in australia there is a phone available for kids, and the parents program the phone, it has only 3 numbers that can be called and that's it. Its just for children's safety and parents piece of mind. Ill get one for my daughter when shes a bit older so she can contact me. Its also prepaid so there are no bills. So no nasty surprises!|`|U9pnPXnpaa	Yes, people are microwaving their kids brains at a younger and younger age these days.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Yes. I go to a school for kindergarteners - seniors in high school. I am 17 and still don't have a cell phone and my car wouldn't start so I needed to call my mother and I asked somone from my class if I could use his cell and this second grader walked by with a cell and said "Be back in a sec mom." Then she gave me the cell. Hmm...|`|pPUzkbtGaa	im 15 and i have one, but thats only b/c i have a lot of sports after school and my parents need to pick me up and know where i am.|`|zrBzRYI8aa	I got my first cell phone the middle of my 5th grade year.    I know my 8 and 10 year old cousins have cell phones. They both have blackberrys cause when my aunt signed up they where only $50.00. The only reason that they have cell phones is cause it was cheaper for them all to have cell phones then for them to have a house phone.|`|1bf2f9586d3ad537a73d55b79612e926aa	Funny you asked this question, my 3 yr old just found a old cell phone with out sim card and I told her she could play with it well... The police just left my house seems she knows how to dial 911. So I now know 3 is too young for a cell phone.|`|o503YPrqaa	Yeah I think its a necessity... Safety.  What if something happens. There is GPS tracking on the phone so I can find them if they are lost or kidnapped. If their ride or friends bail i can come get them, if something happens in class like an accident like wet pants or poop or periods, I can get them.  If school lets out early and I don't know I could come get them. Instead of making them wait in the "office" and be the 60th person to use the phone.  Also, I could text them through out the day to chat, or check up on their location through the GPS, also send them pictures or them send me pics of them and their friends.  So many reasons why I will want my children to have phones early on. I am 21. I pay for my 16 year old sisters phone... Because its that important. I know most of the time its chatting with their friends and being annoying with their phones.. but that one chance they are in danger or need help or something.. and they don't have a phone.. Shat out of luck.  Oh and phones are not that expensive. I mean yeah 200$ but depending on your carrier and sales.. you can pay less. I can get a black berry storm for 100$. OH and the whole blah blah about not being able to pay for it themselves... My mom paid for mine until I was 18 and got a job.. after that my boyfriend and I got on a family plan and he pays for it.. 200$ a month for him me and our sister. Its a little expensive but comes with navigation, and unlimited texting which we need. we all txt alot! and I think its a good price..    MY Mom who is 56, who has had a cell phone since they came out in the size of bricks, thinks grade school kids should have cell phones as soon as they fully understand how to use them properly. like just the ones to call mom and dad with a gps tracker, but once they can txt and call then they can get a regular one. Thats her saying that! I think so too... Come on if you can't afford a cell phone for your kids, then thats fine. but if you can, what's stopping you? my 9 year old niece got one for xmas it was a hand me down because her 14 year old sister got a new iphone.  I don't think anything is wrong with that..|`|AKFtOVeQaa	My seven-year-old daughter has a Palm Centro, $299.  But I told her she must keep it until the end of this year, since she got it on Christmas.  She is "popular" at school, and she is ALWAYS texting or calling  her friends/boyfriends.  I don't think it's ridiculous, because it's just like a house phone, only "cooler".  Kids, just like teenagers, have friends, boyfriends, & family that they need to talk to, and sometimes house phones are being used,  (Well, not in my household. No one uses it anymore:)  or they want to text.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	It depends.  The little girl I daycare for is 9, her mother is a single mother and dad lives in another town.  The cell phone is a way for her to communicate with her dad and her half brothers and sisters without paying for long distance at my house.  She also uses it to call her mom when she gets off the bus in case she wants to go to a friends house or her aunts house instead of coming to mine.  My son is 8 and will not have a cell phone because he comes off the bus straight home and is never anywhere that we are not or that there is not a phone he can use.  If I had to work and couldn't be home then I might consider giving him one so he could get in touch with his father or I whenever he wanted....but for now its not going to happen, no matter how many times he asks-which is usually once a week!    My husband and I don't carry cell phones either.|`|tg30Jgclaa	Children beg their parents for everything these days! Cell Phones, Video Games, TV's, ipod's!!!!!! Its crazy! I have seen sooo many children texting these days! I saw a 2nd grader with an i pod with her name on the back!|`|jdRKZe18aa	You aren't alone - I too think it is sometimes ridiculous, although a part of me thinks it CAN BE a safeguard for kids too but in reality it's just a peer pressure socially expected thing to help our kids feel cool and part of the 'crowd' and appease them, enable them and pacify them...  BUT they sure are convenient, handy and I don't know what I did either before without them.    So it's a catch 22 actually - but I understand what you're saying and tend to AGREE with some exceptions.....  Gotta draw the line SOMEWHERE and age 9 is just TOO young in my opinion.  I didn't let mine get one til middle school, which was 7th grade... how old was that, I don't remember now!! HA LOL|`|aLAmvX5Naa	It is hard to judge because we didn't have the option to have a cell phone in high school. 11 years ago it was unheard of, almost no student had one. You paid so much more for so few minutes, it was silly for a kid to have one.    Our parents had black and white tv. Why aren't you happy with black and white tv? Why do we as a society need these 72 inch flat screen HD tvs? What is wrong with a simple 20 in one?     So yes, it seems silly to me for someone under the driving age to own one, but if I was a 13 year old today I'd probably want one.
C156l7vWaa	Breakfast: Fruit, oatmeal/cream of wheat, yogurt, whole wheat toast  Lunch: you need to eat lunch, have like a sandwich, pasta, etc  Dinner: Make sure you eat enough at dinner and make sure you get enough protein. Personally, I'm for vegetarianism so eat things like peanut butter, beans, tofu, legumes, eggs (if your not vegan), and nuts  Snacks: make sure they are healthy, unless its dessert, then just eat it sparingly, I personally have a weakness for chocolate, but hey just a human here lol    and hun don't let ppl call you fat, if your happy with your body size then your fine. If you feel you need to drop a few pounds then eat right and excersice well. Don't resort to eating disorders cuz they are unhealthy, frowned upon, and disgusting!|`|603cd7a91cd40305c99285dd017c8fe3aa	sounds like you need to eat more. dont let people call you fat if you still want somthing to eat eat more just go for a run 1st its better to run b4 you eat like in the morning b4 you eat anything because you haven eatin anything yet so u burn fat faster..    hope that helped|`|KwJDWvB3aa	for breakfast eat a banana and oatmeal and for lunch have a sandwich then have a snack like say an apple or something and for dinner have salad and corn or maybe beans and rice (brown rise is healthy) and its bad to eat before bed.
jn34aSgHaa	well i have tried everything also i and i have found that the really cheap brands usually hold great i buy costco brand . huggies are the worst and they are the most expensive.|`|w7FSmSTnaa	i swear by pampers i have never had a problem.|`|olF9Hl6saa	I used Pampers swaddlers when my son was very small.. and then changed to Huggies. I had the same problem, and Huggies were the only brand that didn't leak. Have you tried Luvs? They didn't work for my son, but I know others who swear by that brand.|`|SkCnQHceaa	I cant say that ive had your problem, but I have recently switched to the walmart white cloud supreme ones. They are much cheaper and still work good for us. DONT get the parents choice ones. I thought they felt horrible. like paper. Maybe you should consider switching to cloth diapers??|`|nTJ8bKJnaa	Any diaper will leak if it is not put on properly or you leave it on too long. Some do hold a bit more than others, and generics are as good as most brand names. Have you tried "overnights"?|`|073dfe1742ff65dfffbab08391ba6332aa	If you have the money up front (though it will be wayyyy cheaper over all) ... go for the high end cloth diapers like the new Bum Genius 3.0. or other similar pocket diapers. They are the only thing that works for us overnight. When our daughter was small we had some luck with Pampers Swaddlers (never with Huggies) but now she's a real super soaker and the pocket diapers with microfiber inserts are the way to go.|`|C5asEoAbaa	try luvs they hold my son all night long he rarely has any leaks|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	I really love the Costco brand.  Its worth a try.  And also I really liked LUVS, most people complain about them but they worked great for my son.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	huggies natural fit work well on my 5 1/2 month, but the other huggies, and pampers all leak.    The girls I nanny for had no problems with the White Cloud brand diaper and the Dribottoms brands, both at walmart    otherwise, try luvs.|`|rAkWoweOaa	I've tried every one you can imagine. None are better than the others. They have all leaked. If you find one that is leak proof please post.|`|4KXA5oVtaa	I've been through the same thing!  However, I found that by trying the 'specialty' types in different brands helps.  For instance, I tried huggies and found they leaked for me, but the pampers swaddlers just 'wrapped' around my son better.  Pampers also makes the natural fit which have also worked well for me.  I tried luvs and they worked well while my son was awake, however, through the night he'd pee through them.  Hope this helps!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I use Parent's Choice, they don't leak pee unless you really let them get too full.  But I have to warn you that the filling slumps down weirdly so to some people it looks like the baby is poopy when really they aren't.    You could also get some cloth diaper covers (not rubber pants, nice ones like wool, fleece, cotton, etc) and put those over.  You can get really cute ones.|`|r52rfBkeaa	I've tried most out there on the market but I personally prefer the Walmart brand White Cloud.  I thought the Target brand worked best when my son was in his blow-out stage, but when it came to gallons of pee, the Walmart worked better.  I've been buying them ever since he was 3 months old and he's 15 months now!
aJLx0nhNaa	Take the piss out of her.  Tell her, quite seriously, that you're sure this baby is ruined already but you're determined to get it right with the next one!  Maybe she'll get the hint and shut up.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	I think we all compare sometimes, esp. when theyre the same age range. I cant help but sometimes compare my niece (brother's daughter) with my sil to my baby girl who is 3 months younger. To me it's innocent. It may be with her too. Just tell her next time she asks, "all babies are different and develop at their own pace, just like children and adults, no one is the same."    edit---oh i missed a pertinent detail, sorry. about the pretty baby thing? wow, that was incredibly rude and isnensitive of her. maybe for some reason she's insecure and jealous of you? so shes doing that to make herself feel better. I would have said to her if she ahd said that to me; "really? wow thats funny. People tell me all the time how beautiful she is when I take her out."|`|EMKuBql8aa	When she asks what your baby does, don't answer her. Just say, "she is progressing fine, but tell me about your baby, I wanna hear all about her?"     The whole pretty baby thing would have pissed me off though, you're being too nice. I would have a nice, long talk with her and say you will no longer go out with her or have phone conversations if she one more time implies that you have an ugly baby. Stand firm on that one.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	don't answer her.  if she asks when your baby did something, say "it doesnt matter' and stick with that.  if she pushes it, say something outrageous like she just got her drivers license, she did the grocery shopping, whatever - just be consistent and not answer her truthfully - she'll have no choice but to stop.      keep in mind its mothers like that that are damaging to their little ones - who cares if strangers say a baby is cute?  its the inside of a person that matters more anyway.  come to think of it, next time she compares how pretty the babies are, remind her that you hope the child gets her kindness from her father's side.  lol.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	Maybe she is honestly curious of when/what her baby ought to be doing since it is her first one..............why not buy her a good book for first time moms with developmental milestones.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Just say to her "I'm sorry but saying things like that in front of a child is insensitive, it won't be long until she understands what you are saying, so I simply can't allow it"    (Its perfectly true babies understand an awful lot by 12 months)|`|YJNql5Mgaa	My cousin does that too!  and always tries to squeeze in how much better her baby is than mine. It's obnoxious!!!!!!    As much as I hate it, I just ignore it and change the subject.|`|pF3VmiqUaa	That is so annoying!!  I would just simply ignore her.  It is her first baby and she is just beginning to experience the excitement of being a first time mother.  More likely than not, what she is doing/saying to you will be done to her later down the line as well.  =]|`|POSGHgzuaa	Just tell her that you're glad she's enjoying being a mom, you've enjoyed it for X years.

It is cute and unique!    good luck! |`|Y0dpiPozaa	I love the name Locklan, however I would spell it Lachlyn and make it a girl name :)    Out of your choices, I like Dani Michelle best for a girl, and Lachlan Richard for a boy.    I'm not a big fan of the name Hunter (I know a few dogs named Hunter) but it's a personal choice and if you like it it's your choice. You have your reasons for choosing it! :)|`|OnDIrxNEaa	Not too fond of Georgia Ann, but I love your other choices.  Nice job!!  Dani is especially beautiful, but I like it as Dani Michele.  Lachlan's awesome  :)|`|vai6VUTdaa	hunter sounds like a hillbilly|`|Sy1R6caeaa	I LOVE them all except for Lachlan, I might like it but I can't figure out how to pronounce it.|`|vqYldLFyaa	I like them all..They are very well thought out and placed together:)    *Konnor's Mommy:)  *Great Job!!|`|cTBtFitZaa	i luv ann but not a real big fan of georgia  i absolutely ? dani michelle  and i like Hunter Richard and Lachlan Mitchell better|`|52b425b42ee78f32298ff055306b1a99aa	i really like them...especially dani michelle. but i don't really like lachlan. i'm all for wierd/different names, but i think that one is just a little too out of the box. people will have a hard time saying his name when reading it. i know a kid like that with a really wierd name like that and he said it's fun for a bit but after a while it gets really annoying.
kBp9IzQqaa	Don't say anything you wouldn't say to somebody's face.    I am so sorry you had to deal with all that crap!    -Tempe|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	Wow, that is pretty heavy.  A self-help book for molested children.  I think I will go drink now...|`|603cd7a91cd40305c99285dd017c8fe3aa	the best why to tell a story is always start from the begging and never leave nothing out. a story that comes from the hart thats real is always better then someone that has read about and think they know what they are taking about. you should have no problem i wish u luck|`|Gq0t3ERIaa	You're not alone. 1 in 4 women have been molested as children, 1 in 7 for men.  You might not be able to mention the name of who did this to you, unless this "person" was convicted of molesting you...   I'm also sorry that happened to you.|`|eKaGmMzTaa	Im really sorry you went through this. What I would do, is start organizing your thoughts into paper. Then begining writing, even if your not getting anywhere. just put your thoughts onto paper. Soon a story will form. You have two ways of going with this. You can do a complete non-fiction book or a fiction based on your life.     Just make sure you don't get graphic about anything. Just maybe talk about that you were once molested but like dont talk much about the actual part adn just talk about how it effected your life. I think it could definitely change the way other girls feel and it can help them knowing that there is another person out there but she made it through.     As the publishing part, I recomend , you write the rough book. And just type or write little parts a day. Maybe one or two. And soon you will have a rough copy. Go online and search for publishing companies, and they will most likely have their address and email. send in your copy, maybe through email and a hard copy. Send it to several because you may be turned down by one, but another one will publish it. So just don't give up. Good luck and I hope I helped?|`|9KsxYINMaa	Okay -   Don't mention the guys name.  Don't get into graphic details about the molesting bit.  Don't write it as if you want them to feel sorry for you, or as if your complaining, but more as an autobiography.    Im so sorry you had to deal with that, its horrible. I really am truly sorry.    write out your ideas and a story will form.  then write a draft and send it in to a publisher.  if they say no try another publisher, J.K. Rowling was told by a publisher that Harry Potter would NEVER sell.    boy they were wrong.    i wish you the best of luck, xxx
EtCRnDJMaa	ha ha!      wait until you have your own!!!    In a way, what other reason do we need to give if there isn't one, other than because i said so      your mom does love you though|`|POHWTDPRaa	Why do kids 'always' need an explanation for why they aren't allowed to do something? You asked, you got an answer and that's the end of it.    You will do the same thing to your kids because as the adult, the person in charge, it will be your right to decide what is or isn't allowed from minute to minute and not be questioned about it.|`|AkFag8tNaa	I agree somewhat. In order for you to understand her rationale, she needs to provide you with a reason. However, sometimes no is just no and should be left at that. As parents, we struggle with picking our battles and often, there are many.|`|rAkWoweOaa	When you are a mom, you will understand. Until then you can't do whatever it is simply because she is your mom, and she said so!|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Until you are out on your own and paying your own way in life, your mom has the last word. Moms don't have to explain things to your satisfaction because that just leads to arguments, because you don't really want a freaking reason, you want what you want.     After you are all grown up some of those "reasons" you will figure out for yourself.|`|a1fq8ZHBaa	Lol, your lucky   I guess just have a problem with what you are doing and she fells as the parental figure she knows whats best for you.      But for me i get a long *** lecture on why i cant do what i wanted to do and each lecture is about 45 min.ZzZzZzZzZzZ BBBOORRIINNG!!!!!!|`|xOiafJpoaa	well, because, they know better than to roll out a list of all the reasons why what your doing is wrong because, chances are, you wont really care or undersatnd her reasons. Youll undersatnd when your older, thats also something moms always say!|`|irLnPW4aaa	Because she is the Mom, and sometimes she doesn't need to explain WHY to you.   Sometimes I tell my kids they can't do something, and there are reasons that are just too complicated, too adult or to personal for me to want to explain to them.  Maybe your Mom feels the same way in some situations.|`|04bc2c48d79f30c010ba500a390cb62daa	1) She is jealous and wants to go and do something fun too, but can't.  2) sometimes she may feel it is not safe or doesn't trust the person u will be with.  3) maybe she wants to spend time w/ you but doesn't have a way to tell u.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	She wants what's best for you and seeing as how she is her mother "Because I said so." seems like a pretty darn good reason to me.|`|547Ln6rNaa	Because if we explain why you can't do it, you'll spend the next hour attempting to deconstruct our argument when the simple fact is, we said no and we have our reasons and we don't want to argue about it because it won't change how we feel.    D: Mom can I make a volcano?  Mom: Not today love.  D: but moooooooooooooom!!  Mom: NO D, you can't.  D: Why not?  Mom: Because I said so and I am the mommy.    Alternate ending:    Mom: Because it'll make a mess  D: I can clean it up....  Mom: But you'll be in my way.  D: I'll do it over here.  Mom: But you have no concept of what "I'm busy" means, you think that you can actually build a working volcano on your own, in quiet, without asking me to help every twenty seconds, but you can't, and I know you can't, so before you actually make me say that out loud "YOU CANT DO IT", and make you feel bad, or make me say it and have you attempt to prove me wrong, and show me that you really can do it - but find out you can't - then feel bad and also have dented your confidence, and *still* be angry at me now for not helping as well......lets just leave it at "No" and the reason being "Because I said so".     We'll make a volcano tomorrow when I am not in the middle of making a cake with steaks under the grill and stuff in the oven.      See how much easier it was the first time around?  I have a fridge magnet that says "Because I'm the mom, that's why."|`|xp4mhkqgaa	Mums don't always do that.  If I tell my son he's not allowed to do something, I explain why he can't do it.      I agree with you, parents who say 'Because I said so', don't give their child an explanation, which I think they deserve.      I've felt like saying it tons of times, and it's difficult not to, when he's not doing as he's told, and winding me up.  But I know that it won't solve anything, and I believe that in order for my son to grow up knowing how to respect people, I need to set a good example and show him the respect that I expect him to show me, and everyone else.|`|09YH28Fuaa	I know man my mom doesn't say that though...she is not american she has different ways of saying that.    haha    well when people are saying "when you are older you will understand" is well because when u are a mom and have kids then u will get it is probably what they mean!      OLIVES!!!!!!!!!!!|`|3ERKIfqIaa	lol...i even have a picture of it hanging in the kitchen as a reminder...sorry son...."I'M THE MOMMY, THAT'S WHY!!|`|dnjmYR6Faa	Well in my opinion, as my mother never actually did this to me, but i am looking after my sister who is 16 years old.. You sound like you are a teenager also? I often tell my sister that she cannot do things "because i said so." but only when i feel there is a reason that she would not understand. When she wants to go to an open house party, and my reasons for saying no is because there will not be a chaperon, there will be over 50 Drunken teenage boys, and many possibility's of reasons why my sister would not end up coming home, and these are reasons that she would not listen two, therefor it is A lot simpler to not give a reason.   Your mother is only doing this to you to protect you. I no it may not seem like it, but just give her a little bit of a brake in a few years you will learn to appreciate it.

AA11763588	Your prenatal vitamins will do that to you.
Bu6eSZSlaa	Schedule? I know how u feel, it feels like your body is just ready to collapse under you but not right now my dear, she's only six days old. You won't be able to get a newborn on a schedule not for a couple mths atleast. My little one is 5 mths & i'm still trying to get her on a schedule....|`|n6XYYyoLaa	not easy to put a nb on a schedule, she may have nights and days mixed which u can work on, but beyond that they kinda make their own schedule, as she gets older it will become much more  predictable....|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	When you say it works out better for your 'family,' do you mean you and the baby? Or you and what other relatives think you should do? Don't worry .. I'm not criticizing ... but some people come on here and are very worried about what extended family says or thinks they should do regarding nursing.     It's only been six days ... you could still try to get her latched. Did you have a lactation consultant in the hospital? Pumping is good, too, but can diminish your milk supply because it's not the same as having the baby latched on. And while I never exclusively pumped, I've heard lots of women say it's hard work. (not that nursing isn't) She probably likes the bottle better because it's immediate letdown that she doesn't get right away from the breast. If you do decide to go back to breastfeeding, then she might have nipple confusion or get frustrated because of this.     As far as a schedule, really it's a little early to do that. I started around probably 12 weeks with my first; with my second I think we just fell into it because of what I was doing with my older child. It's normal for them to have their days and nights mixed up at this stage; I'm not sure how to work that out except maybe keep her awake longer during the day. Although for some that might make it harder since they get overtired.|`|xDBZVswtaa	sorry to tell u but u r going to have to wait for a schedule..that's what newborns do they are up no matter what the time..they have no sense of day or night yet.i know its tough but it will change soon..good luck and congrats|`|r52rfBkeaa	To put my kiddo on a schedule, I turned on all the lights or open all the blinds and either a TV or radio during the day when he would nap.  When I wanted him to go to sleep "at night," (since bedtimes vary), I would turn off all the lights, close the blinds, the TV or radio would be only loud enough for my hubby and I to hear and we would shut his bedroom door to keep out noise.  We opened it only a crack when we went to bed since we didn't have a baby monitor.  This worked like a charm and slept through the night (10pm - 5am) at 6 weeks!|`|pOsnTnimaa	congratulations on the safe arrival of your baby    omg i just wrote a really long answer and then i went to click preview and it all went and said that yahoo was experiencing technical difficulties. how annoying.    ok im just gona say this as briefly as i can .    my baby is now 4 and a half months old.    I was in the exact same situation as you.    I expressed for a month, used nipple shields for another month and eventually my baby took the breast .    When my baby didnt latch i told myself the same thing that you are telling yourself, that it worked out better for my family but deep down i was soo sad and felf rejected and i just wanted my baby to take her milk directly from me.    I offered her the breast every time before her bottle and every time before i put on nipple shield.    I would really advise to use the nipple shields if you decide that you want yor baby to feed directly from the breast.    by the way breastfed babies should be demand fed, just feed her when shes hungry whether its every  1 ,2 3, or 4 hours.    its very very hard to express milk so often for your baby and feed your baby and sterilise etc . its a lot of hard work.    i know how you feel when you said that you feel good because she drinks more from the bottle, i felt the same and my baby was the same.    anyway well done on whatever way you decide to feed her whether expressed or directly from the breast, congrats and well done on giving your baby the best start in life with breast milk.|`|1F7eYuNWaa	We all go through this, so hang in there!  Don't stress yourself out trying to keep to a schedule, just go with the (baby's) flow.  Enjoy it!  And keep trying the latch on, if only because direct nursing is more efficient than having to pump every time.  I know it is uncomfortable but there will come a day when it feels fine.  Try squeezing your breast into a "sandwich" and feeding it into the baby's mouth horizontally.  Otherwise it is like trying to latch on to a big round balloon - no go.  Babies have to learn the latch.  Wishing you luck and patience!|`|jgDlkSiWaa	I would recommend getting baby to try to latch on. It's a learning experience for both of you. I would recommend giving it 6 weeks before you quit.   I tried to do the pumping and it was a huge pain in the butt. You have to live your life around a pump. You can't be gone any longer than 2-3 unless you haul the pump with you. (Then to sit in the car or somewhere and pump for 20 minutes sucks!!)   You can try to put a newborn on a schedule and you will end up frustrated.  I would wait at least 3-4 months before trying.   Please contact the LC at the hospital or the LLL. Nursing is so much easier than pumping.   I know it's a lot of work and i know you are very tired, but it will get better! I promise!   Congrats on the new baby!|`|nYtG6js2aa	Baby is 6 days old and requires feeding every 3-4 hours. I'm sure you are aware breast milk is much more easly & smoothly absorbed into a baby's system which means she will probably wake every 3 hours (compared to artifical feed (formula) which congeals (heavy) in the stomach keeping baby asleep longer).     'Sleeping all day awake all night'   As she is only 6 days old she knows no difference between night and day except;  All baby's are different and some sleep longer after a bath while others do not. Perhaps switching bath times might help.
N072Uv3Taa	My son is about to be 7. He struggled in school, but not because of his learning ability (he makes all As), but because of his hyper-activity. After years of talking with the doctor, I decided that it was for the better of HIM to help him settle a bit during school. He is now on Focalin. He only takes it to help him at school. He doesn't take it on the weekends or holidays.  Think of it this way...  I wear glasses to help me focus, just as he takes medicine to help him focus.  The best thing to do is find someone in the medical field (physician or pychologist, or psychiatrist) that you trust. They see many children and can advise you on what to do. You don't have to take their advice, but the knowlege they share will give you insight to make the best decision for your son.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	Have you taken him to the doctor? That's the best way to go, just talk to the doctor and they can diagnose whether your child may have ADHD, or he is consuming too much sugar, or whatever else the problem may be. After your kid is diagnosed, the doctor will know what to do to help him.|`|bmoCpcdraa	talk to your childs doctor they do have certain foods thet make it worse put him in an active class after school like a sport or karatte class or something put him in boysscout or big brother progam|`|SpTCJfm3aa	Hi Im 13 and i take something just like you described its adderall but the generic version which makes it ware off faster but i dont recommend getting your child started on a drug like this at his age I started it when i was in 6th grade I have server ADHD and this really helps me if not i wouldnt be writing this right now. there are other alternitives like cutting out the foods that make children hyper the best type off thing you could ovoid is artifical food coloring this is known to make kids super hyper. but starting a 5 year old on such a strong drug as adderall is not a great idea he could easily get addicted.|`|g5JeSJbNaa	i would recommend taking all surgar out of his diet and it worked for  us good luck|`|JsqMSU9Haa	look at his diet. get rid of most if not all of the sugar and processed foods - i GUARANTEE you will see a positive change.  secondly make sure he's getting enough sleep - should be about 10-12 hours.. is he getting that?  and lastly, try to have to him concentrate on things like legos or coloring or building with blocks - quiet activites that he can sit and play. sit with him if necessary and if he loses interest quick, try to refocus him (build the tallest building and crash it down, draw the best alien and spaceship, etc.)  good luck.
VUss5AfAaa	did you know baby's dream about you as well of how you look or feel.  its normal to dream about your unborn baby.  and if your not then you know its ok as well. pregnancys are diffrent.  maybe its because you already expirienced what a baby feels like and brings joy to you!.    good luck.|`|GsKIZZPwaa	u dream bout ur baby?awww|`|7SKVCPcSaa	not dreaming about your baby doesn't signify anything about the health of the baby. so i wouldn't stress about anything until you have to. i'm sure your baby is just fine.|`|fbe8face4c64fd238c4d4c3fd28046a7aa	I feel that your baby will be fine. Don't stress over it. Just eat good stuff and sing to your unborn baby. All will be fine. You will be in my prayers tonight.|`|9O3prIUpaa	That's probably exactly what it means.  There's a theory that dreams reflect our deepest fears and desires.  If you're not dreaming about your baby, it could mean a number of things, but I think that , more than likely, it means you're not so afraid.|`|0KAxlpqEaa	idk|`|S6iJSXseaa	what are you talking about|`|HhY4Oul2aa	aww thats so cute and my grandma has dreamed about a baby crying and in her dream ,and she just found out that i had unprotected sex with bf the day after period and i may be pregnant and i also had a miscarriage dureing the summer and i was devestated that i lost my baby, even if i am young
deIzFnV8aa	It sounds like you have a ton of toys for your daughter!!! (I am getting 'overstimulated" just reading about it!)  Her favorite toy at this age is probably you!!      I have a 3 1/2 month daughter, and we spend a lot of time making faces at each other, watching the 'baby in the mirror" (a crib mirror can be good for this, or just the one in your bathroom), reading stories (board books and soft books that crinkle) and singing songs, or splashing together in the "big girl bathtub". She loves to be held sitting while she tries to grab her blocks or rattles (and try and eat them, of course).  She also enjoys batting at the toys in her play gym, which your daughter is just growing into.   In a month or so she will be able to grab at things much better and be much more independent about playing with loose toys.    We also do a "mommy and baby fitness" DVD together, which my daughter enjoys a lot.  You don't have to buy the DVD - just sit her on your tummy and blow on her face while you do situps, or do leg lifts where she can watch your feet go up and down.  Make funny noises while you stretch, or use baby (carefully!) as a barbell. Fun for baby and good for mommy's postpartum toning!      Also, here is  a great website for game ideas:  http://www.babycentre.co.uk/baby/develop...    Babies don't seem to mind repeating activities fairly often, so don't worry if you don't have something new every day; she will just enjoy being with you some of the time, and playing in her gym when you need a break.|`|HAe5jKwqaa	Activity masts are great.  anything w/ a mirror and colorful objects a newborn will love.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	The only things I had for my daughter was a activity mat, swing, and a couple rattle toys. I didnt want to get her to much because I thought she would get overwhelmed. I also read books to her everynight. Plus when they turn 6 months there are a ton of toys that you can get for her that she will enjoy. My daughter is 11 1/2 months and we got most of her toys at 6 to 9 months.

Edit:  I'm sure they have them, but I think that both sides need to be represented.  My kids are formula fed and happy (breastfeeding was not an option).|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	i wouldn't buy it, but i think other people might.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Probably not.    No one but me feeds my baby.    But I know some moms that have put similar things on their babies because they birth in the kinds of hospitals where they circ without asking, give formula and pacifiers without asking, and take babies away from their moms.  Frankly I think separating mom and baby is a human rights violation, but that's just me.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	uptight breast feeders would   i breast fed for four months and feel i did a good job and m  proud of my self for how long i did it and that i tried   but its still offensive|`|7SKVCPcSaa	oh hell yes i would buy that!! i love it!! and i'm going to be breast feeding for the first year!|`|JsEd4H0raa	I would deff say that people who breastfeed and don't give their children formula would.|`|W8UZebRWaa	If people put their kids in onesies that say "Daddy's little squirt" or "I ate my twin" or my favorite " I tore my mommy a new one" I'm sure!|`|3oJL2Go3aa	That would be a good one for women who breastfeed only.. I would buy it for my next baby. That is if the breastfeeding goes better than it did with my first baby. I ended up having to breastfeed and top her off with formula because that little girl ate a lot and I wasnt getting enough milk in to keep her satisfied. Plus she was born with teeth and tore me up so I had to stop until I healed.. But anyways I think it would be a good onesie|`|PW3hcVZiaa	Sure, but be sure there was one available that said "Formula is not rat poison" for sale, too!|`|37PpYx8oaa	Sure, for every product there's a group of people who will not buy it.  However, in my opinion that shirt would come off as negative.  Perhaps you could change it to the positive: "breast fed baby" or something like that?|`|0viZhxi6aa	My lactational consultant gave my son a shirt that says "I Eat At Moms" and I think it's adorable. But I don't look down on formula fed babies or their moms, and this shirt seems a bit insulting.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	I think its pretty rude to formula feeding mothers. Also  its not funny to me.

ozO2fI61aa	You should tell him he has the right to know, and please do not have an abortion if you don't want the baby give him / her to adoption! don't kill him/her talk to your parent I'm sure they love you and they will understand you.|`|p0prrzf2aa	i thought you were 15?      troll|`|VgpwPxkdaa	well did you tell your parents?

Adoption is another situation that is hard to determine if your situations is not known because you don't want to put your child and worse situation and I know you would want to have some part in your child's life being that your gonna carry it for 9mths. My sister is 14 and her daughter is was born in july of this year and at first we didn't know what to do but with a good support system from both ends its possible just sit down and really think about what you are about to do and everybody that your about to affect in the process and if you believe in a higher power you better pray. and what did you know about a boyfriend at 11 a 3 year relationship how old is he|`|L0873cdDaa	You should give the baby up for adoption, its not its fault you made a bad decision and had sex too young.|`|7ZsvzIP7aa	How come you were 15 and using a different account when you posted this question in the adolescent section?|`|pUnjP0Jyaa	please dont say it over the pc or on the telephone you guys need to be face to face when you tell him about your situation awl your so young but iwisht he best for the 3of you and dont forget to tell your parents and his iont kno how any of them will take it since your so youg but like isaid ihope all goes well sweetheart!|`|j4Mjc4Ecaa	first, tell him in person.  The baby is his, he has a right to know in person.  Secondly, dont have an abortion...put the baby up for adoption!

If you value life don;t ever think about abortion. It will haunt you forever. If your parents will help to raise the baby keep it if not just give it to adoption. Watch Juno the movie. a lot of people would like to adopt the baby and sometimes will pay for your medical expenses or other. Regarding your bf just tell him personally. don;t email, txt or even tell him on the phone. This is very important matter.|`|i2yM0T9Paa	Aww (:    WHOSE A TROLL?  YOU ARE!    Get a life. You used this same lame story in the adolescent section. But you were 15 than and you used another account.|`|WcvsBgLuaa	First off, you shouldn't get an abortion.  If anything, put the baby up for adoption.  There are alot of couples out there who can't get pregnant but would love to have a child.  They would love and care for the baby.  Plus, it may be hard for you, but there is no reason to kill this innocent baby.  When you give birth, you may fall in love with the baby .. You probably will .. And at that point you may want to keep the baby, even if it means getting support from family.  You can get on many different programs to help you pay for the baby.  As for telling the father- Try telling him to his face.  If he wants to keep the baby, you should respect that and have the baby then give him full custody.  As you said, you made an adult decision and you should act as an adult about the situation .. So really think about your options.|`|ucnl64zvaa	first of all, go see your doctor. it could jut be a pregnancy scare, things like that happen when you're young and you have sex. even though you did take three tests, still go to your doctor.   once you're positive that you are pregnant, confront him in person. but be confident, its your decision wether or not you have the baby. it is your body and he can't tell you what to do with it.|`|ll5T9EiKaa	YOU SHOULD TELL HIM IN A LONELY PLACE AND YOU CAN FIRST GET HIM TO GET COMPLETELY CALMED DOWN FIRST|`|WkD9oAUiaa	first off you shouldn't be having sex at 14! secondly i strongly disagree with abortions. why should you hate someone for wanting to keep their child? anyways, you should tell him in person. no computer, text or whatever. and you should just come out and say it, im pregnant. its that simple! i understand your scared and all but like you said, you make an adult decision and now you have to act like one. instead of abortion dont you think you should consider adoption? at least you could give an innocent child the life they were ment to have. don't take it out on the child. the child did nothing wrong. i understand your only 14 and you don't know what to do. just please consider adoption before abortion. good luck and i hope it all works out.|`|K49s25Rraa	I agree that he has a right to know. This baby was created from the two of you. The best thing to do is meet with him in person.    You did make an adult decision and now you need to take an adult responsibility. I am not suggesting that you raise your baby, but you do hold the life of this baby in your hands. Your baby has a heart beat and it's fingers and toes are already forming. There are many people who would love to adopt your baby.    God has formed this precious being and you have the responsibility to protect it even at your young age.    Please think what would have happened if your mother had decided she was going to abort you.    You have a scary road ahead, but please do the right thing.     I will adopt your baby and pay for everything, but please don't kill your baby.    Your baby is fearfully and wonderfully made.    If you abort your baby not only will the baby be dead, but you will be tortured with it for the rest of your life.    You made a big mistake, but please don't make an even bigger one. It's one thing to create a baby unintentionally, but it's another thing to deliberatley take his or her life from her.    I will pray that God gives you strenghth. Please go to abort73.com and see what they will do to your baby.    Amber
CxRJwJsraa	Ava Christine- Ava is rather popular, but I still think she's a lovely name. I tend to dislike her when she's paired with something REALLY trendy, but Christine is sweet and lends some extra old-fashioned charm to the modern Ava.  gorgeous choice.    Johannah Grace- I like Johannah (though I prefer it spelled Johanna). I'm not a big fan of Grace, especially as a middle name. But since it's a family name it doesn't bother me as bad. This is a nice choice, but I still like the feel of Ava Christine better, even though I like that Johanna is not nearly as popular as Ava.    Anna Joy- I like Joy, and Anna is alright. However the name feels a bit expected. Basically it just doesn't wow me at all. But, it's a perfectly acceptable name.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	anna joy has always been a fave of mine! ava christine would be second. then johannah grace. they are all wonderful as is!|`|dnGJ5JLgaa	I like Johannah Grace best.  It has a nice ring to it and is very pretty!      Anna Joy just seems like it is together when you say it aloud.      Ava Christine I doesn't ring my bell for some reason but Johannah Grace is very pretty!    good luck!  |`|o40QqoQGaa	I like those, but it sounds like it came straight from a bible.     I really like the name Berkley Lynne|`|OnDIrxNEaa	Ava Christine gets my vote!|`|ODMCAcPDaa	I like Ava Christine best but for me, all the names are way too bland to truly enjoy.|`|igFvprvsaa	Johannah Grace sounds really nice :)|`|4293cf50016bde6c1a79ccb90dbe6c96aa	I like the first one best, but they are all beautiful!

I think it's great that they are using family names.|`|1m9cWAEhaa	anna joy is the most happy sounding :]|`|x0INaVNqaa	I love all three names. They are all really pretty. I like how they are all names that can be cute for a little girl, yet professional for an adult.   I do have to say though, I think the spelling Joanna is prettier than Johannah. Other than that, all the names are beautiful.   I would probably use Johannah Grace (spelled Joanna), then Anna Joy, then Ava Christine. Just personal preference though.|`|7adzqyGgaa	i like Ava Joy|`|mvKbfkhGaa	I like Ava Grace together....you don't hear Ava everyday and it's a really really gorgeous name!
YJNql5Mgaa	A swing! Oh man.     Or meals, or loads of diapers/wipes.  haha :-D|`|wURg3jBcaa	Make a meal after baby is born and deliver it.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Gift cards are always nice.  They really come in handy when you have a baby because you need so many supplies.  The people I worked with gave me a gift card to Target when I had my son and it was great because it let me buy something I really wanted (a storage unit for the baby's room) that wasn't really something I would have registered for.    It's acceptable to do it before the baby is born (in the case of a woman going on maternity leave, her last day is traditional) or after.  You could go to baby's r us and Target and put their names into the registry and see if they are registered anywhere and buy a gift and have it shipped to the house.|`|JsEd4H0raa	Throw a baby shower!|`|JsqMSU9Haa	you can all chip in for a baby gift - an outfit and some diapers would be much appreciated.  before or after the baby is born is appropriate.  you can put some congratulations balloons on his chair for his return.  maybe make a meal or two for them to throw in the freezer now, so when the baby is here they can have a quick hot meal - that is much appreciated as well.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	having meals delivered to thier home is always nice the first weeks.    or you could throw a diaper shower or a daddy shower (getting i love my daddy bibs and onesies, a 'daddy diaper bag')|`|9p9DDRSnaa	Put together a care package...things they will need but probably havent thought about.....  infant tylenol  infant motrin  gas relief drops  little noses (nose spray)  that booger sucker thing (can't remember what it is called, looks kinda like a turkey baster..lol)  diaper rash cream  lotion  shampoo  soap  first aid kit  clippers and file  brush and comb  These are all things I wish someone would have told me I would need (given somethings I was prepared for, but others I was clueless)  Hope it helps!|`|jn34aSgHaa	i think that if you really want to do something try getting her giftcards or money to buy milk and diapers because that is really needed. i spent $300 us dollars every week on formula alone.|`|GSOLv83Waa	You could have a baby shower for him. Find out if they are registered, and pitch in a get a gift from the registry. Make a gift basket of blankets, diapers, and wipes.. There are many things you can do for him before hand.|`|Ug5twRBDaa	oh my gosh, my co-workers totally surprised me by all chipping in & buying the car seat/stroller combo set for me. throw a baby shower for them!|`|deIzFnV8aa	I wish I had gotten less cute pink clothes and more diapers!  But bringing over meals is also a great idea!  We found that everyone forgot about the new baby after a few weeks, but that was when my husband went back to work and I could have really used help with dinner.  What about giving her a book of "coupons" redeemable for a dinner whenever she wants to use them?  If you got a group of people together, it is likely someone could cover whatever night your friend needed help. You could also include coupons for running an errand or helping with a chore - it was hard to get out those first week, but we still needed groceries, laundry, etc.  And if you go to help out, stay a few minutes to chat - new moms often miss adult conversation, or even just someone who can talk back!
Ug5twRBDaa	My baby has slept from 9:30-10pm to 5:30-7:30am since 2.5 months old. He is now 4 months old. Try feeding him right before bed. You may also want to play with him a lot during the day doing tummy time...(it'll make him more tired).|`|3klIx1Egaa	my sons 3 1/2 months old, and since the age of 1 1/2 months he has gone to bed at 11, and gets up anywhere between 9:30/10 the next day. no night feedings.|`|ddP3klT3aa	When my son was 3 months he went to bed around 11 and slept until 5am.

lcxyOS7uaa	There is a slight possibility, and it would be a good idea for her to get Plan B, since sperm can travel. It is probably not likely she is preggers, but a baby costs way more than $50.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	Probably not pregnant, but you can never be sure.  Those little guys are nothing, if not determined.  Clear or not, any of the fluids can contain millions of sperm.  If any of it made it into the vagina, it is possible.  If she is stressing, have her go get plan B.  If only for her piece of mind.|`|AA11785285	Just a little question????    Do any of you guys get any sex ed in middle school or hs?   I know we have had 8 years of a prez who didn't believe in teaching you guy anything ,but did any of your teachers tell you about it anyway??????????????????    If his erected penis was anywere near her moist vaginal area, she risks pregnancy.    But why?    BC is free at Planned Parenthood... just google them + your city, and all the numbers are there.  Any African woman would stand in line a week for free bc pills, and all your friend has to do is walk in, have a chat, and they hand them to her for FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.|`|gli7SbBoaa	If she was wearing panties I doubt she is but if she's freaking out then tell her to get Plan B.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I doubt that she would be pregnant, but then again if he wasn't wearing a condom there IS a slight chance that she could be. She could take the morning after pill "Plan B." There are side effects though.|`|PLK1p8cUaa	They are playing with fire.  She can prevent the sperm from getting in her by him wearing a condom or not having sex.  Tell her the clear fluid also contains sperm.  If they are going to play around they need to be responsible and use two forms of protection.  And yulk to you for knowing your brothers business.|`|WcvsBgLuaa	Probably not pregnant.  Prevent the sperm getting in her?? - DON'T GET INTIMATE!!|`|zvjMQo0Haa	if she didn't actually have sex she couldnt be pregnant.....you've got to have sex.|`|FA710vETaa	the ONLY way to get pregnant is if it got inside of her...if it didn't she is in the clear and if they were having sex with out protection then precum is just as good as cummmm to get the job done!!!|`|zH80yyDQaa	I highly doubt it.|`|4D1VEKW5aa	Not unless it soaked her panties, if it did theres a possibility she could get pregnant but not likely.|`|AsICkz9naa	Well she could get pregnant. She could get the emergency birth control pill as long as she takes it within 72 hours after the sexual encounter.|`|IvU7WH8baa	her chances are most likely she cat get prego but if he did finish by her vagina it is still possible she can get prego. go to a clinic and ask for a plan b it should be free and what this does is thickens the tissue in side of the vagina so the sperm cant swim though if u cant go to the Client get 4 birth control bills it equals the amount of birth control to the plan b. take 2 of the birth control bills at once than 2 more 2 hours later. this is not abortion it stops the sperm before it even gets to the egg. so it wont get fertilized  this will work trust me. but she cant have sex for at least one whole month cuz the hormones in the bills will make her chances of getting prego higher for at least one whole month. well good like and dont kill the boy lol

8kaDm2D8aa	they told me my daughter was gonna be close to 9lbs, she weighed 7lbs 8oz.  they tried to induce me twice, neither worked, it was horrible, read up on the drugs & the side effects before you agree to it cuz they can be bad.  wait, he will come when he is ready.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Wait it out and don't get induced. My son measured large and I wasn't dilated either. He was born at 38wks, my water broke, and he was a normal 7lbs 11oz. I ended up induced after my water broke and will never allow myself to be induced again. A c-section is 6-20 times more dangerous for mom than a vaginal birth so attempting vaginal is always best. Induction on a first time mom has a 46% c-section rate so be prepared for that.    Tearing is no big deal and way easier than a c-section to recover from. My mom has been through both. I tore a tiny bit and was completely back to normal by my 6wk exam and was pain free by 2wks.    Anyway wait it out and if a c-section needs to be done than at least you tried vaginally first which is safest for both mom and baby.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	This is a tough call.  I was induced (because of my water breaking prematurely) and ended up with a c-section. I have a friend who was induced at 41 weeks and ended up giving birth to her baby naturally!  No drugs!  Which is what she really wanted.    So, while it is possible that going down this path will lead to further intervention, it's not a certainty.    It is totally your choice, obviously and I suspect you are at "risk" of having a c-section eventually regardless.  (Which I was terrified of, but after having one, I have to say it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.)    But if I were in this position I would wait one more week, to 40 weeks until inducing.  That's just me.  Give the kid a chance to get out on his own, you know?  And then I would go with the induction if labor hadn't started and hope for the best.|`|VJQaZHmLaa	c section,i know its sounds scary but its safe for mom and baby my mom had a c section with my brother and it was done with in half an hour he was 4 kilos,the other choices sound to complicated,for me for example inducing then doing c  section if it doesnt work just go c section get it done with safetly you will have chances in the furtur to give birth and have the experience but atm saftey for you both comes first|`|JsEd4H0raa	I would get induced. Try to have in naturally. because healing from a c-section takes a LONG while. You can't do much and are in a lot of pain.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	Ultrasound weights are incredibly innacurate. I personally faced the same issue, but with my doctor going out of town if i waited too long. I got the induction. I really with i hadn't. The pitocin make my blood pressure spike, and I ended up with pain meds, which i really didn't want.    Bigger babies actually hurt less, because of the pressure.    All of my research says that tears heal better than cuts.    Faced with the fame situation again, I'd wait it out. And make sure my doctor isn't going out of town near my delivery.|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	I think you should get induced but do not get a c-section unless you have to.  I have had four big babies/four c-sections. I was induced with my first son four days after my due date. I was in labor for twelve hours until they decided to do a c-section. The doctors made it seem as if I had a choice but I dont think I ever had a choice with my first son. I would have never have chosen to be in labor for twelve hours and then had a c-section afterwards. With my second, third, and fourth son the doctors were honest from the beginning and I knew I had no choices and I had to have c-sections.|`|701FO16zaa	my son was 10 pounds 5 ounces and he was born at 38.5 wks. My waters had to be broken because I was dialated and contracting but the dr said I had very tough membranes. Do what you feel is right for you and your baby.|`|oRBi01sbaa	Because of your husband's birth size, you may very well have a bigger baby.  I was 9 pounds and both of my sons were 10 and 10 1/2.  My first they induced on my due date because they didn't want to go any further.  Induction was not bad, but long (30 hrs of labor) and I had an episiotomy.  I ended up having an epideral and that was wonderful (but you said you didn't want drugs...)  Second son, I had a C-Section and I must say, MUCH easier recovery.  Whatever you decide, there's nothing to be scared of and once you hold that healthy, beautiful baby, you won't even remember what it took to get him there.  Good luck!|`|AA10850845	Calm down :)    I had gestational diabetes so it was protocol to induce at 39 weeks.  At 38 weeks, my ultrasound showed she was well over 11 lbs, they were guessing a 13 lb baby @ 39 weeks.  They also told me I should have a c-section because of the risk of shoulder dystocia and I have a pelvic tilt.  I said "ok".  I trusted Dr.'s at that time.    Luckily my water broke on it's own at 38 weeks.  I had a c-section since that was the "plan".  She was 9 lbs 10 oz (big, but could have been born vaginally) and much smaller then they told me she would be.    I did not get to hold her or see her for 45 minutes until after she was born.  I was so doped up.  Recovery was hard, they even told me I should not pick my own daughter up since she was almost the 10 lb lifting limit after a section.  My milk was late to come in since I did not allow my body to have her naturally and let those hormones kick in and I ended up being told (and believing) I needed to give her formula.  Thus began the slope to my failure at breastfeeding.    Ahh, c-sections are a wonderful thing for Momma's who need them.  They have saved many a babies life.  And it was painful, the key is to get up and moving ASAP, and the pain wont be as bad.  IF you decide to have one....    Because please remember...    This is your decision.  Don't feed into the Dr.'s and listen to your heart.  Big babies are born all the time vaginally.  You can do it :)|`|deIzFnV8aa	Well, I had a very easy labor despite being induced, so I think it can go either way.  The baby was monitored the whole time, so I felt it was pretty safe despite the drugs. I am surprised they would induce so early, though.  8 1/2 lbs isnt' really all the big.  However, this is a case when the opinoin of yourself, your husband, and your doctory (esp!) matters most.  Just be aware that recovery from a c-section is much longer.  You will need help to nurse and take care of the baby for at least a few months, and it will be much longer before you can tote laundry and such.  Also, I hear they give you a lot of drugs afterwards (according to someone I knew who had a c-section last month).  So if you are concerned about drugs, you might want to talk to your doctor about that.|`|0NRAdYTsaa	I would wait and let him decide when HE is ready to come out. An episiotomy isn't as bad as it sounds. I tore naturally (from her big noggin) and got 8 stitches. I'd much rather have that then have my stomach stitched up and not be able to bend or lay down comfortably.     Either way, if things don't go as planned, you will have to get a c-section. try naturally first... your body knows what it's doing.|`|5WcoAznyaa	I was induced on my due date and I resent every minute of it. My MD pushed me into doing it because he too thought that I was going to have a big baby (by the way my son was only 7lbs 6 oz). Wish that I would have gone into natural labor. I was only 20%effaced and 1cm dilated at the start of it all. The first stage was the cervadil and that only changed my cervix 10% in 12 hours. Then came the pitocin. My contractions were out of this world (my doseage was upped by 6 every 30 mins). I thought that my colon was going to come out! After 6 hours of that I finally got my epidural and 4 hours after that I went in for a c-section (he hadn't dropped down at all.....hence the fact that I think he was taken too early). After a c-section you don't really get to bond with your baby. Once out you get to see him/her it's off to the nursery and you're left on a table being stitched up and put back together. Plus you can't just jump up and pick up your crying baby for like the first few days. Not trying to be rude but if someone would have explained a little more to me about the process of and induction and c-section I would have said no and waited to see when the little one was going to do. MD's are great, but sometimes can misjudge situations (like my son being a "10 lb baby"). Hope this helps.|`|QvmHjhdsaa	I have had two c-sections and will be having my 3rd on 2/10. I unfortunately do not have a choice in the matter as no matter how long I labor (nearly 2 weeks with  1) I dont dialate. That being said there are definite risks to having c-sections. Infection, too much bleeding, uterine scarring forcing additional c-sections and possible placental issues. With my 1st I ended up having a major infection after the baby was born. Had to spend an extra 3 days in the hospital. With my 2nd I had some crazy internal bleeding and had to have blood transfusions fo rectify my blood pressure etc. This one coming up already is going to be a problem due to where the placenta is located. The dr is going to have to cut through it which has high risks of heavy bleeding and possible hysterectomy. SOOOO dont decide on a c-section thinking it will be easier on you! I dont regret any of my pregnancies or how I have to deliver and recovery isnt so bad as long as you get up and moving as soon as you can. That is the key. The more you sit and try to be still because you hurt the longer you will hurt. Best to get up within 12 hours and start walking around the room. Yeah it hurts but it could be worse.    My dr's have always ended up estimating the baby's weight higher than what they ended up actually weighing. Remember they are just making their best educated guess. If I were faced with this choice I would do a lot of research and weigh all the risks of each of your choices..|`|6mib1nANaa	I think you should wait and let nature do what it was meant to do! I say this with experience. My first baby was 8.8  and all was well with him. But my last baby I was induced because I was just misrible pregnant. Everything went wrong and I had to have a C section. I would never recommend a C section to anyone in my life. The worst thing in the world. I feel that if I had just let her come on her own thing would have been ok.  So, no C section unless you or the baby are in danger and don't induce cause it could cause complications. Thats my opinion due to experience.
3oJL2Go3aa	I would talk with a school consolor about this. My sister did the same thing.. The consolor told my mom that not to let her see that it bothers you. Act like you could care less. About the whole sneaking out of her room. My mom just let her do it and when my sister came in late at night and wanted to sleep in, my mom got her up for school anyways. It stopped. We learned never to lie to my mom about our homework because if she found out from the teacher that we werent doing it. She would sit with us until it all was done. She would also call the teacher and find out what our homework was. Then if we had to read a book she would make us read outloud to her and we would have to read the whole thing. We would get a break between chapters and that was to get a drink or go to the bathroom. We didnt get to go outside and play because she would make sure that we did our homework the whole day. I did that once and I learned not to do it again.. But I would talk to a school consolor or social worker. Maybe they can give you advice about how to do things at home and maybe they can talk with your daughter when she is at school.. Good Luck and Hang in there!|`|WL1Tmx8Eaa	try not to cry in front of her. When you are taking away privileges use the same attitude that she has;nonchalant.That ALWAYS bothers me. As you go make the punishments more severe using the same attitude. No matter how much it hurts you HAVE to teach her because as she gets older it will just get worse.|`|2jMmJzqRaa	im 13 i did the same thing to my mom i let people in my house a few times while she was gone one day she cought me and she took away my tv the outside my phone and my computerr for about a month but ofcousre she was really mad but it helped i actully got scared of her she kept yelling at me and all i had to do is read a book and the only way i could get out of my room is too go to the restroom and get something to eat or drink you may not be that stricked but it worked on me i know not to do it again.      hope i helped(:|`|9ydJQr5zaa	Crying in front of a child is not good! It is only showing the child that you are weak and they have control over the situation. Therapist? Are you saying you cannot handle it yourself? She has control over you? The only thing to do is to spank her. If this spanking would have started earlier she would not be acting like this. Search about spanking and how good it is. Research about implements such as paddle, belt, hand, so on. Explain to her what she has done wrong and what you expect after the spanking. You will see how effective spanking can really be.|`|RsTm8uUlaa	That's what most kids do these days. I do the same except for the sneaking out part. I think she'll grow out of it. And like the first person said, take away privileges.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	You don't say how old she is or how long this has been going on. Sounds like you are hoping that she will stop because it is hurting you. It isn't about you. She needs consistent discipline. If she isn't doing her homework on her own, you need to make her do it in your presence.    She needs to lose ALL of her priviliges until she can earn them back one by one. This will be a lot of work to enforce.     You can't just throw up your hands and turn her over to a therapist. You need to be her parent and expect more from her. And let her know when she gets it right. Good luck.|`|bfjs9wSLaa	No, this is a teenager.  I am a teenager myself, and let me tell you-  we just want you to trust us, and let us make our own mistakes  we know what we are doing (most of the time) and we really wish that you would let us make our own mistakes.    and crying in front of her just makes her believe that she has more power  let her get in trouble  she deserves it for being so horrible.    you have to teach her a lesson|`|V1MptCMiaa	Take away her phone and computer and TV and take the lock of her door.  Literally take them out of her possession, don't just tell her she can't use them.  Also, to keep her from sneaking out, get an alarm system that'll go off it she opens the window. And yes, I think therapy will help.  Good luck.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Keep in touch with school, and get her assignment schedules. That way U know what is going on -- so she can't lie to U -- U already know! Then when she does lie, just smile and sweetly and say something like "I think U might want to work on such & such, because I believe it might be due on this date" You do not owe her an explanation of how U knew. Just keep that part to yourself.   Next do not get rattled by her lies. Just brush them off as unimportant for a while, and watch those lies loose their importance.  As for enforcing rules, do the best U can without getting too ruffled. Make it clear which privileges go out the window if her chores are not done in a reasonable fashion. And when things get really bad, close your eyes and try to imagine what a cute baby she once was. Haha.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	She doesn't need a therapist! She needs discipline! Come on Mom, you can do it!  Start by taking away privileges! Cell phone, computer, tv and so on. Then things like going out with friends, ie grounding.  It seems like you are just letting her get away with it.  No point crying in front of her, to make it stop, it is obviously not working.  Start doing something about it!|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Start taking away privileges. Like t.v. and cell phone. If it gets to the point where she has only a bed in her room then she might need therapy.|`|rA4F2J6Iaa	make the consequences for lying and sneaking out more severe. get sensors on windows take away cell phone..limit privileges.    make there be consequences for her actions...good lesson for life.|`|TemZzSuCaa	As a teenager there was countless number of times I've lied to my mom. They used to NEVER let me do anything! I couldn't go outside either and I never understood why. She hasn't realized yet what kind of people are in the world and what they'll do to her if they take her away. But sometimes as a parent you have to give your daughter some kind of freedom. If she wants to go outside, let her, give her a cell phone and call her when you get worried. You can't keep her locked up forever because (as a teen) whatever you tell her not to do, she'll do it anyways! Maybe she's not interested in reading either so she lies to get out of it, she knows it means alot to you so she lies to avoid hurting your feelings. There's always reasons behind everything. Sit down and talk to her. I hope this works for you and your daughter.
AA11763588	Most symptoms start showing between 4 and 6 weeks. The hormones in your body need to get high enough for any of them to show.    1st symptom really is missing your period.|`|85V6cHe4aa	A pregnancy will not be definitely detected until two weeks after conception-there are tests that say they can detect it earlier but if you read the pack it says the earlier yo test the less % of pregnancies will be detected so if you test a bit early and its negative you will need to wait and test again if you don't get your period.    Symptoms vary greatly,some women get them as  soon as implantation occurs which is 7-10 days after conception but some get them a bit later,some have none.|`|pVUhlg4iaa	like a week idk take a preg test|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i got symptoms at 6 weeks. you can tell as soon as you miss your period if you take a test.|`|ozO2fI61aa	For a better result you can take the test after four weeks!|`|kb8xHjCFaa	Realistically... it's probably 6 weeks plus but people swear they got them before... you can test after 14 days and be pretty sure, though!

I was very irritated and snapped a few times and threw a cup and broke it.  Then I cried when I heard a song I can usually sing.  And when I looked at a picture of my Papa(Grandpa) who passed away when I was 3, I cried, and I can usually handle myself.  I felt like I was goin to start my period, but I didn't.  My little boobs started getting bigger.  Ate more.  Missed my period, took a test, and I'm prego!|`|yqQBcjDmaa	Typically you can find out at 4 weeks.  (Around the time of your missed period, if you have a 28 day cycle).  Some people get symptoms right away, some don't get them at all.  Everyone is different.|`|j4Mjc4Ecaa	about 2 weeks before your first missed period...good luck :]|`|W5iqfxUsaa	9 day past ovulation at the soones for a hpt. and you may get soon symptoms soon after implantation..|`|NsRcqEQSaa	well there are pregnancy tests where they can detect pregnancy 1 week before a missed period.  first responce early detection|`|vqYldLFyaa	Well for every women it is a different process...I got very sick and had to go to the hospital they told me it was just the flu or a virus...Sent me home with some medicines and I was already 4 days late but my periods weren't always on track adn i took meds for that too as I have PCOS ots cysts on my ovaries. Well I didn't take any of the medicine and day 6 of being late rolled around and I just knew in my heart it was something else..My boyfriend suggested a HPT...Well I took 3 and they all came out positive:)..I am now 30 weeks pregnant with my son Konnor:) I would at least wait until a missed period at least 2 days into it because it could be just that its late and needs more time:)...  *Good luck and Congratulations if one is in order:)  *Konnor's Mommy:)|`|EaJ1TYqraa	usually on the 4th week of your last period.    i started getting symptoms 2 weeks after my missed period.|`|SpTCJfm3aa	3 days before your missing period is the earliest with a home pregnancy test but after 4 days of the sexual intercourse you can go get a blood test taken at your doctors office because the sperm can still get you pregnant within 3 days and that is the most accurate and fastest way to find out.    as for the symptoms everyone gets them at different times some people have no symptoms but that is rare.    I hope this helped!:)

0Sv8PiH9aa	They all are pretty much one type, murder.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	There are surgical abortions and chemical abortions.  Chemical abortions have to be done very early in the pregnancy.  The woman is given a pill that helps to expel the contents of the uterus.   Surgical abortins:   Suction Aspiration  This is the most common method of abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. General or local anaesthesia is given to the mother and her cervix is quickly dilated. A suction curette (hollow tube with a knife-edged tip) is inserted into the womb. This instrument is then connected to a vacuum machine by a transparent tube. The vacuum suction, 29 times more powerful than a household vacuum cleaner, tears the fetus and placenta into small pieces which are sucked through the tube into a bottle and discarded.  Dilation and Curettage (D&C)  This method is similar to the suction method with the added insertion of a hook shaped knife (curette) which cuts the baby into pieces. The pieces are scraped out through the cervix and discarded [Note: This abortion method should not be confused with a therapeutic D&C done for reasons other than pregancy.]  Dilation and Evacuation (D&E)  This method is used up to 18 weeks' gestation. Instead of the loop-shaped knife used in D&C abortions, a pair of forceps is inserted into the womb to grasp part of the fetus. The teeth of the forceps twist and tear the bones of the unborn child. This process is repeated until the fetus is totally dismembered and removed. Usually the spine must be snapped and the skull crushed in order to remove them.    Salt Poisoning (Saline Injection):  Used after 16 weeks (four months) when enough fluid has accumulated. A long needle injects a strong salt solution through the mother's abdomen into the baby's sac. The baby swallows this fluid and is poisoned by it. It also acts as a corrosive, burning off the outer layer of skin. It normally takes somewhat over an hour for the baby to die from this. Within 24 hours, labor will usually set in and the mother will give birth to a dead or dying baby. (There have been many cases of these babies being born alive. They are usually left unattended to die. However, a few have survived and later been adopted.)   Prostaglandin Chemical Abortion  This form of abortion uses chemicals developed by the Upjohn Pharmaceutical Co. which cause the uterus to contract intensely, pushing out the developing baby. The contractions are more violent than normal, natural contractions, so the unborn baby is frequently killed by them -- some have even been decapitated. Many, however, have also been born alive.    Hysterotomy or Caesarean Section   Used mainly in the last three months of pregnancy, the womb is entered by surgery through the wall of the abdomen. The technique is similar to a Caesarean delivery, except that the umbilical cord is usually cut while the baby is still in the womb, thus cutting off his oxygen supply and causing him to suffocate. Sometimes the baby is removed alive and simply left in a corner to die of neglect or exposure.    Partial-Birth Abortion  Five steps to a partial birth abortion:    Guided by ultrasound, the abortionist grabs the baby's legs with forceps.      The baby's leg is pulled out into the birth canal.       The abortionist delivers the baby's entire body, except for the head.      The abortionist jams scissors into the baby's skull. The scissors are then opened to enlarge the skull.      The scissors are removed and a suction catheter is inserted. The child's brains are sucked out, causing the skull to collapse. The dead baby is then removed.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i'm not trying to be rude, but you would be better off googling this yourself. you're just going to get a bunch of really negative answers on here and none of them are going to help you at all.    none of the women here are ok with abortion and they will let you know about it.    just google around for what you're looking for.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Why are you posting this in the pregnancy section?

That along with witch doctors is all African woman have, and she has her first baby at age 13 or 14, followed by 13 more pregnancies, and in her life 9 live births before she dies too soon at about age 45...(33 in Zimbabwe).  She as well used the "pull out and pray" method....and you are using this one too????? wunnerful, hon, just wunnerful.   These two methods will work for you about as well as they work for her.    Are you pregnant?   Is the sky blue?    And if you got lucky and dodged the bullet (or as we say, the one "swimmer") google Planned Parenthood  + your city and all the numbers will be there... bc is free if you are under 18.....FREE.  Any rural African woman would stand in line 24/7 for free pills!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|fbe8face4c64fd238c4d4c3fd28046a7aa	I would take a test or see the doc or go to planned parenthood. Don't stress, it is mostly a waiting game now.|`|irHF6CBPaa	What do you need help with? If you think you are pregnant get a test we can't detect if you are pregnant If you have unprotected sex then there is a big chance you might end up pregnant|`|RLbN2Ujhaa	Pulling it is only 20% effective as a form of birth control. That means if you do it 5 times, one of the times you are likely to get pregnant. Not so good if you're trying to avoid parenthood. Those "menstrual calendars" assume that you have a 28 day cycle and ovulate on day 14. What is your typical cycle length? You need to go by YOUR history. You are getting into the window of taking a test. You're like on day 31, which is not that late for most women's cycles. Buy a bunch at the dollar store; if you don't use them this month you can use them next month, unless you find a reliable source of birth control.|`|SpTCJfm3aa	heres the thing if any sperm landed on your leg or anything it can still get  you pregnant sperm can live up to 3 days so be careful stay calm and go to the doctor to get a blood test to see if your pregnant its the most accurate way to find out|`|pUnjP0Jyaa	obviously you think your pregant sice your q said   PREGNANT?!?!?! Helllllp?  but anyways umm ithink regardless off what ithink or anyone else on here thinks you cna only be for sure if you take a test so yeaa how bou you do that!|`|oRBi01sbaa	It doesn't matter how quickly he finished or if he pulled out.  Sperm can fertilize an egg even before full ejaculation.  If you were due on the 24th (of January?)  I would immediately take a home pregnancy test.  You will have your answer within minutes.|`|vqYldLFyaa	The time it took for him to "finish" doesn't matter...The pull out method is not safe adn i don't care who says it is..There is a thing called pre ***..Its there long before he actually finishes so if he was inside of you THEN pulled out then that means that the pre *** was in you and thats actually were most the sperm is. I would wait a day or so and if you don't start take a pregnancy test..And to be on the safe side if it's negative go to your dr and tell them you want a blood test done..that will tell you for sure before the HPT will..  *Good Luck and Congratulations if one is in order:)  *Konnor's Mommy:)|`|WkD9oAUiaa	ummmmm, i hate to break it to you but you may be preggo. there is sperm in the pre ejaculant, the pull out method does not work. don't trust this again. Use a condom all the time!
4CMQuJgOaa	we have a play area for toddlers at our mall i make a trip of it, lunch and then play for a bit...then home for a nap    my son will not sit for a movie, or the library he is too active LOL    edit : you may want to check with your town and see if they offer anything for toddlers|`|nfzQkvqraa	I don't know anything about your area, but I take my kids to the library, the museum, the movies, the local sports complex, the science center, the YMCA.  Good luck finding some fun places!|`|AMuVbIwnaa	My daughter and I go ice skating. We found an indoor rink and it is a blast. Talk about a workout!    You could also go to the aquarium, museums, etc. I don't know if anything like that is close by. We live in a major city so we have lots of options that are easy to get to.
afSqgYBZaa	WOW! I am going through the same thing right now.    I am currently about 5 weeks and 5 days; I went into the ER last Friday because I started spotting. The doc looked at my cervix and said everything looked fine (it was still closed), they tested my blood HCG levels and they were normal, and I went for an ultrasound that showed the sac. So by all apearances, I was fine and the pregnancy was still there.     When I got home I bled even more; it became what the doctor called "heavy spotting" (it looked more like a period to me) and on Sunday I started to pass small clots. I had just a little cramping, nothing severe. Today, the bleeding is starting to taper off, no more clots and no more red - just a pinkish brown discharge.     I went for more blood work on Monday to see if the hormones are rising - they should keep rising if I am pregnant still - but I won't get the results until Friday (my doc was booked solid). I REALLY want this baby so I am keeping my fingers crossed and praying the little baby is still in there and growing. My areolas are still getting bigger and I am getting more bumps on them - so if my breasts are still changing I can still have hope that the baby lives!    If you need some support, feel free to send me a message!|`|AA11763588	Bleeding that heavy can be one of two things:    1. A miscarriage, you need to head to the ER or your DR's office.    2. Your hormones are out of whack and your uterus is shedding a bit.    Either way you should go to the hospital and have it checked, better to be safe than sorry.|`|A9CB5m1faa	I've miscarried twice and know exactly what you're going through. Go to your dr and explain what happened. They might just have you go to the emergency. Sounds like you've miscarried already especially since you're so early on in your pregnancy. Good luck!|`|nzGdMWbZaa	Go to the Emergency immediately.
mbHOvWxKaa	SHES A SLUT WHAT CAN YOU DO|`|KwJDWvB3aa	take away all her underwear.    im not one to normaly do stuff like that but if she wont listen to you then do that for a while till she agrees to stop and if she dose it again you do it again and so on..|`|Inc78M0Raa	Next time she does, embarrass her.  She will eventually quit because nobody wants to be embarrassed.|`|LLAdQwCpaa	just sit down and tell her that she is 16 and she should know better than to do that. ask her to leave the house or go hang out with her friends if she is going to act inappropriately like she is.|`|14pjwQPLaa	Have you discussed with her how uncomfortable it makes you?  How "guys can't help being guys"?  Maybe you can get your friends to back you up on the embarrassment -- like, when she walks in, make a face and say, "Geez, cover up, why don't you?"  She needs to respect your rules on this one -- you might "love her to death", but some tough love is needed, here.  Tell her that the next time she walks out in her underwear, SHE'S the one that's going to be embarrassed, when you toss her back in her room, and tell her to stay there unless she can come out properly dressed.|`|XXw7DUDRaa	pants her. that outta teach her a lesson.|`|754b5669f7d51e2b7739ea88b243aea1aa	Look you need to talk to her seriously, little girls end up getting raped like that, you may think of them as your freind but do you really know them. She is looking for attention that she doesnt really want. Your too old to let her get away with stuff llike that. Put your foot down and make sure your tone is firm and u mean buisness, also explain to her that guys dont respect girls who do things like that.|`|603cd7a91cd40305c99285dd017c8fe3aa	she likes to be the center of attention! the best thing i think is to have your friends tell her they feel uncomfortable with her being a young teenager walking around in fount of them in her underwear.
K5AeQuSNaa	Try a salad with balsamic vinegar in the dressing.  There is nothing scientific to back it up, but all the women in the office here swear by it.  And sex.  That seems to help too.|`|85V6cHe4aa	Ewwww been ages since i heard the castor oil one yuck! To be honest every midwife i ever had told me never to do it and i have 6 children so i have seen a few midwives lol....it will probably just make you very sick and generally upset your stomach,i was told it probably wouldn't work and if it did i'd be handling labor and a bad stomach.    Sex and walking are great ideas,they may or may not work but they certainly wont do any harm-just save some energy for labor and i know the end is hard going but babies tend to only budge when they are ready.    Have you asked about a cervical sweep? not very comfy but by stretching open your cervix a bit and 'sweeping' around it can prompt labour.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	castor oil, i've heard, doesn't actually help. just gives you the runs. the sex and walking do help though. but you need to be having really hard sex.|`|3klIx1Egaa	ive never heard a doctor say to use castor oil, due to the fact is causes diarrhoea, and can dehydrate you.. SEX and walking work.|`|AA11612508	honestly, its time to move furniture around, vaccum under couches, stuff like that. DONT use castor oil, you will have the runs all day, if not for two days. yuck.    and who would want to be going into labor with the runs.   think about it. If youve never had a child before, you cant hold your runs in if you have a contraction. Contractions take over your body.  So yuck, think about what you are asking.  "should i intentionally get the runs, before i go to the hospital"|`|4xDDR7c3aa	well he can strip your cervix. I dont know why any doctor would tell you to medically induce yourself at home with a powerful laxitive. I wouldnt do it if I were you. It cant be healthy for you or the baby.|`|llTceWOjaa	I used castor oil with my second baby and it worked. Mix it with orange juice and mix it very very good it's really gross tasting.|`|RLbN2Ujhaa	a DOCTOR told you to try castor oil?!?!? Even most midwives tell you not to do that. It gives you painful diarrhea cramps and can also cause the baby to pass meconium before birth. Walking and sex, OK. But if you're body or baby isn't ready, you'll only end up sorry you forced the situation along unnaturally. You can wait until everything is ripe and have a nice, normal labor. Or you can force your body to try something it knows is wrong and end up with every medical intervention in the book and go down a longer, painful road. So many doctors induce for the dumbest reasons. Maybe your doctor is not convinced of your date and doesn't want to put your baby in the NICU .|`|zvjMQo0Haa	sex.....walking....and nipple stimulation can cause the uterus to contract as well which would bring on labor....also, holding your pee can cause you to start having contractions....but I wouldn't advise that one.  try eating spicy foods!

i27Kmimlaa	I like spike for a male dog, its a strong name but it really depends on what kind of dog it is also. For a female missy is cute.|`|tyqN6qBUaa	My fiance and I were playing with a puppy at the animal shelter yesterday, and he kept calling her Missy, and I didn't like that, but I did come up with Misty. I think Misty is adorable for a female dog, and Rombo is less common for dogs than Spike, but I've never come up with many male dog names since I can't have a male dog.|`|lnZjIhDCaa	Milo sounds good for a boy dog, and Missy for a girl. I don't like Spike and Rombo.
7rCeCVl2aa	Heck yes! Take every second of sleep you can get! =) I always tried to nape when my baby took a nap too.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	yes! it is absolutely ok, and you may find she sleeps longer with you next to her....just take precautions if u think u might fall into a deep sleep; as long as you are sleeping light, all should be great! gl, hth|`|wURg3jBcaa	I do.  I put the boppy up around my waist while I'm reclined, then I cradle my daughter in my arms.  My maternal instincts keep her safe- but I'm never am able to sleep to soundly when she's in my arms.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Sure.  Are you both getting good sleep during this time?  Is she safe from accidental suffocation from pillows and covers?  Go for it.  You both need your sleep!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	'When baby sleeps, you sleep.' This was always the advice I got! Do you have a swing? That might encourage her to sleep longer. As long as you know she's fed and everything and is safe somewhere (crib, swing, playpen, etc) you can snooze even if she wakes up, as long as she's content while awake. Get as much rest as you can!|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	If you mean if its okay for you to get some shut eye while the baby is napping then yes, every chance you can get even if it's just 10 mins try to relax while the baby is down. If you're talking about having the baby sleep on the bed with you then it's up to you, me personally would put the baby in the crib just because I fear rolling over on them|`|JsqMSU9Haa	in the same bed or just at the same time?  i'd put her in her crib and yes, take naps too.|`|vdIZU4ePaa	the second that baby passes out for a short nap, place her in a playpen in the room and crash on the sofa! If you don't get enough sleep you will go insane lol. Trust me. As long as you are close enough you can hear her then by all means sleep!|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	Yes. nap with your baby. cuddle her and love doing it. you can't 'spoil' a baby before 12 weeks, and even then, it's good for you to have bonding time with her even through napping. After 12 weeks, just try to make sure one nap a day... no matte how long... is in her crib.|`|VJQaZHmLaa	be very careful my mum had a friend that slept with her child and woke up to find the baby had died during the sleep  she had rolled onto the baby during her sleep this is such a tragedy she cannot live with herself,dont want to scare you or upset you just be aware because accidents happen and its to late when its happened|`|JsEd4H0raa	if she sleeps in a crib or bassinet or pack in play. I would say yes. if she doesn't I would say NO|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Most moms nap with their babies at least occasionally, otherwise we'd die.    If you don't want to nap with her try putting her in a wrap, sling, or mei tei.    Or use a pillow/boppy and you can type while she sleeps in your lap or while you watch TV.|`|mvHs43Ldaa	Absolutely, it's probably best that you do. My boy did exactly the same thing and all I could do was sleep during the day when he did even if it wasn't for long. Hang in there, it does get better :)|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	I've been taken naps with my baby this past week-she's been waking up frequently at night and it's been seriously disrupting my sleep!    I put her in the crib next to my bed, and I sleep on the bed.  She tends to sleep for longer periods of time when I'm sleeping with her.
j9ta5ulqaa	I used the free version online..it worked great! The only thing is you need to pay 19.95 if you want your state e-filed. It was easy and simple. I bought the CD at Wal-mart last year...this was just the same except the state.  I was very happy with it. Of course my taxes were very simple. Hope this helps.
tkkYIdIvaa	I guess you could change it. It's up to you. Reading at four is marvelous! I would want my son's school to be not that pushy but still pushy. He's only one so I'll have to wait.|`|D8x0w6FMaa	Sounds fine to me. I think children need to find their own way not be pushed into things. Full-time school for a 4yo seems intense already!|`|kOBoy6wpaa	my son is 19months and for the last 2years (since i was preg) i have been looking at schools in my country even wiling to move to get a good school looking into home-schooling also.... willing to put all my time and effort into getting my son into the best school available. i really hope you get right school for your daughter what type of school you pick will determine what grades and even college your child will go to...     good luck|`|AKFtOVeQaa	I have all my kids that are under the age of seven, homeschooled.  It wasn;t my choice, it was theirs.  They really don't do much, and as long as they make something out of  their lives, I'm happy:)|`|cAtWxJG1aa	I would run away from a school like that.    Academics are important to me.  Pressuring kids to race to academic levels when they're barely old enough to tie their shoes is a different matter, though.  Younger kids learn best through play, and nobody benefits when a kid is burnt out by second or third grade.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	I am all for good academics. But I think pushing children into learning everything too fast and too young can cause them to hate school. I wouldn't change schools because your daughter likes art at age 4. When she is 8 and likes sports will it be another change? And when she is 10 and prefers history? And when she is 12 and likes science? Children's interests change way too fast to change schools based on that.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I think that in many cases it can teach a child to resent learning rather than embrace it.  I think that this would be the best age for you to make the transition.  The older she is the harder it will be on her.  It sounds like your doing the right thing for your family and daughter.  Good luck!
04bc2c48d79f30c010ba500a390cb62daa	You can ask the mom, but u know she won't let him out. Here are some options:  1Don't let her know about the dance and have him sneak out.  2get the mom drunk so she will pass out and she would never know.  3.get your dad, uncle, etc to ask her out and then drag the friend out.  4. Ask her to go also so she can watch him.  5. just bring pizza over and chill w/ all of them.|`|DkVofG9paa	unfortunately.. there's nothing you can do.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Sure...here's my advice...mind your own business and let his mom raise him the way she fits.  There certainly is no reason to worry about him because his mother has rules...weather you agree with them or not.
aYF1RkEqaa	I think good parents do love all of their children - just each one a little differently.  I have 2 grown children.  Sometimes I would think that one was my favorite, and sometimes I would think that the other was my favorite.  Really, I just loved them both differently because they were different people.  For example, one of my children was really clever and funny, and the other child was more serious and would have interesting discussions with me.  Depending upon my mood, I would end up enjoying one child's company over the other one at times.  Perhaps I was in a quiet mood and wasn't wanting to have a crazy, silly child "bothering" me, but my other child would sit quietly with me and just chat.  Then I would feel that I maybe enjoyed being with that child more.  However, if I was in a silly mood, then I would gravitate toward spending more time with the first child.    A great book that describes this parent-child relationship is "I Love You the Purplest" by Barbara M. Joosse.  Here is a link to it.  It's a really cute book.   http://www.amazon.com/Love-You-Purplest-...|`|aLAmvX5Naa	This is my biggest fear. I was an only child and I want a second child but I worry I might not love that child as much. I would love him/her dearly, but I love my first born so much. I think its hard for me to understand loving all children equally since I grew up as an only child.|`|44OH7Si6aa	I think all parents have a favorite, but part of being a good parent is keeping them from knowing that. I favor my daughter. My son is the eldest and he has always been very independent but my daughter is a mama's girl and has to be around me constantly. Sometimes I feel badly about it but I try to treat them equally and make sure they each receive the attention they want.   Not just parents, grandparents have favorites too only i think they are even more obvious about it|`|zx8cVDqIaa	Ouch|`|nea3jIooaa	nope there's alwayz one that stands out|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Each child is different. Some children are more lovable than others. Even if they are all your own, U just can't interact with every kid the same. Do not feel guilty, but as the second one grows older she may have some redeeming qualities. Just be sure U treat them equal as possible on the surface. My mother-in-law used to drive me crazy because she was always telling me I favored the second born over the first. I loved them both, but they were different personalities, and so I reacted differently to each one at different stages in their growing up. Do the best U can, and do not feel guilty. As long as U try hard to be fair in daily treatment and basic care, no one should fault U. U can also question yourself from time to time to see if U can feel better about this later. Good luck.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	In my family, my mother made it clear that my brother could do no wrong.    The rest of us were held to a ridiculous standard.    I avoided this by having one child.  No bickering.|`|hIdzQoquaa	No they don't. They say they do but there's always a favourite and a reject.|`|XoAwzQ5Yaa	I know my parents did. Even thought mom pretends she doesn't have a favorite (she would tell both of us she loved us equally, just in a different way), we all know its my brother. I haven't spoken to my dad in 9 years. Trust me, if you like one kid over the other, the kids will know. At least I get to pick out their nursing homes...  I only have one child of my own, so I know she's my favorite.|`|dZxjXHA2aa	While they are your children, they are still people.  It makes sense that parents might have more of a bond or common traits with one than the other.  The thing to remember is while all parents may favor one child over another, the BEST parents never let it show!!!|`|REZesQpLaa	Well i guess you can be closer to one but it does sound pretty bad. Try to act like they are all equal. (at least)|`|VrR9ojRRaa	You know, I always wondered this also.    Do my parents love me and my brother equally? I dont know, I think its a different love.    Maybe thats what you have? A different love for each outlining their different qualities.|`|ixJSutYuaa	I have a different relationship with each of my children but I don't love one more. It's probably normal to feel that way sometimes but if you always feel that way,you need to talk to someone.|`|547Ln6rNaa	This was a brave thing to say and to ask, and what you wanted was other peoples opinions on how they feel about their children, not a bunch of people trying to make you feel like you don't love one of your kids, like one is in her princess bed and the other is in a cardboard box behind the cooker....I'm glad the opinions improved as the thread went along.    I only have one child and I love him forever, I really don't know that I could love another even close to the way I love him. He's different and special....    But, I have two labradors, and the comment a few above me about you love them both but you are closer with one then the other might be the correct answer. I love dog A so much, she's funny and cuddly and loving and calm - but I love dog B and she loves me back, she's attached to my foot usually, she even comes to the bathroom with me, I really have a bond with her.     Now, here's the thing - because she pays more attention to me, I am inclined to feel more love towards her. Everything wants to be loved, and her loving me makes me love her back. Pure survival trait.   This might be how it is with the girls, because the older one can actually interact well and show you she loves you, maybe you just feel closer?        Oh one more thing....if you're sure there is one....don't ever, ever tell the favourite. My mum did that to me when I was 29 -  I hate her for it.|`|myEwHgI1aa	Some people are bound to misinterpret this question, and say you don't love your daughter, or say other mean things that just aren't so.   Actually, I completely understand where you are coming from. I have two (going on three) little boys. My older child has a lot of needs, and it takes a lot out of me. My younger child, he has his days, but generally, he is an all around easier child. I do tend to enjoy one more than the other-but I love both of them, and I take good care of both of them. Being a mother ( especially without help) is hard work, and I too, fall into the thoughts of "am I a bad mom". We have to remember what we do for our children though, and realize how much we do love them, and care for them day in and day out. Just think of some of the ups and downs you have already had with your children, and things you are teaching them, and you will see how much of a good mom you really are.|`|ndEZOuuDaa	yes, but each has a diffrent kind of love    return??http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|C1d7VL5xaa	OMG, thats honestly awful.  i mean i guess you can't help it but wow.   don't ever admit that...even to people you do not know.|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	I think loving them equally is impossible, they are different people and always will be. They do things different, talk different, dress, different, act different so why should you love them the same. loving them individually is better anyway. You love them for who they are, not for being your kids.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	That's really sad. I only have one son and I have no idea what a second would bring to me. Try to love your second please?|`|Czpfs8RLaa	you just need time to bond with her try not to think about it though just know that you do love her and try really hard not to treat them differently that could hurt the younger ones self esteem.|`|jERevyR8aa	sounds like you are an awful mom.  why did you decide to have a second child then?|`|66527f564cb254f9e419f49c964e40e5aa	There's closeness and there's love. Love is equal, but closeness isn't.|`|oGoIxiQ0aa	I only have one child but i definitely agree with you. I felt that my mom favored my brother and I hated her for it, but when i became a parent i understood that you love each child differently and you always favor the one you are closest to. That's why I'm not having any more kids.....one is enough for me.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	some kids are just easier to love. i love all my children but yes, my youngest has always been fairly easy going, funny and considerate. that is easy to love. i love the others too but sometimes the whining, arguing, and attitude make it a bit more difficult. that's all. just try not to show it though!|`|kSZx9cY5aa	I love all my kids equally, but I have different relationships with them.  My oldest is my 15yo daughter and because she was an only child for so long, and because we travelled a lot (husbands work) we experienced a lot, and she's also our only girl, and I am closer to her than my other children. We have a really strong bond, and I guess she is the 'favourite'.  My little boys are 5 and 2.5 and because they are still so young I have a different relationship with them. I'm very close to them as well (especially my youngest, he is such a mommy's boy, whereas our other son worships his daddy), and I love all my kids equally. I just have different relationships with them.     I can understand that you feel guilty, but as long as you do love them both, I think it will be fine. And as long as you don't you don't give your oldest special treatment or make your youngest feel unloved it shouldn't be a big deal. Maybe when your youngest is older you will become closer to her!  You are NOT an awful mom.  =)|`|JyQIR20waa	i think it sounds kinda mean but its not really bad. wats prbly goin on is dat you've obviously known yur older daughter longer and you've done more things together unlike yur 1 yr old. nd im sure everything will change. whats important is that yu love her. i actually think my mother likes my younger sister better.|`|fgMurwHSaa	I understand why you are close to the older one,and this will probably change over time.She's hard to communicate with and hard to handle,being a single mother just makes it worse.  I would not say that I have a "favorite child", but there are times that I appreciate one much more than the other:my twins are polar opposites and when one is setting the table and the other is watching TV, I feel a little "closer" to her,but she has her moments and is NOT by any means, my favorite.I love them in different ways and for different reasons too.  I think that many people have similar feelings to me.|`|N81wQAyOaa	i have 3 kids   and 1 grand baby and 1 on the way i can honestly say with all of my heart ilove my kids and my grand baby all with everything within my being they are all my life remember this the child never asked to be here    we brought them here they have unconditional love for us they depend on us for everything  i consider them a blessing from god and i could not ever imagine me loving 1 as much as the other i love them all the same even my grandbaby   your 1 year old is going to be demanding until she can learn to do things on her on just like the older 1 i was a single mother with 2 girls one was very independant and the other was a moma,s baby u just learn to love them for who they are it will get better just remember this if its 1 thing that you can count on every morning you wake up is her love for you so i think its only right you give that same unconditional love back to her because thats a mother love ..........as she gets older you will see its a matter of her growing her on indepence and with no father around she only has you to do for her so hang in there and think about it your kids will always be there with uncondition love for you our job is to give it back to them...... god bless you|`|Gqs6H0Z0aa	It is okay. I do love my kids equally, but not the same. They are two different people so I do have things about each one that just reminds me how much I love them and things about them that I don't like so much, my oldest is sweet and kind and easy going, I love that about him. My youngest is sassy and spunky and cute as can be. It is okay to feel differently about them. However, it is also okay to reach out to someone you trust to talk to about it.|`|UAhHDV8Raa	the younger one is just probably a lot of work for you right now. since you are a single mom, you have to do all of that work on your own. you aren't an awful mom, you just sound like you are under a lot of stress. maybe you should spend some time alone with your youngest so your full attention will be with her for some time.|`|AyPOc8WNaa	Every kid is so different and that requires different kinds of love.    Your love of your mate is different than the love of kids or other family or a friend.    And then add in that your 2 1/2 year old is really starting to develop his or hers personalities.    Give the young one time and realize it's ok to love them differently (just don't tell them that)|`|qNmUKWDCaa	You are not alone. Trust me, this will come and go, depending on the age and the stage of your children. 2 1/2 is a great age to feel close to your child since they are now able to communicate, they are somewhat independent (potty trained, etc), and yet they are still cute.     A baby is always tough, but especially if the baby is not the first because her neediness is constantly compared to the older child.     We know you love your children. So don't feel guilty. Just make sure they know it, and you will find, in time, your feelings will change. Then, when their teens, your feelings might change back again. (=|`|4YDli7Lzaa	I think parents all love their kids equally, they just might not like them the same.    For example, my parents love me and my brother the same, however I am pretty sure they like him better because i am lazy and make their lives harder, where he is the smart one who actually helps out and stuff.    You LOVE them the same you just LIKE your eldest one better...|`|nqBZoodWaa	At least you are truthful i know of alot of ppl that say i love my children equally!! BUT i see it in there eyes when little monica does everything wrong and Chelsey does not!! i know they like chelsey more its obious!!!!, um.... srry about that..... akward!! lol|`|T4zxS0hIaa	yes i have the same problem i think it is normal and over time your feelings will change. my first is more intune to me and we seem to understand eachother more... i know this sounds weird but its true my wife says that it is awful but i just can't get over my first daughter, i guess it because she was my first. but like i said i think it will wear off in the future, hopefully.... hope this helps
DSSio06daa	Over do by 10 days, sorry!  I can recall the signs like it was yesterday, I have two kids, both grown, but here is what happened to me, I started cleaning and folding and making beds....it was almost manic because I am not a neat nick,,,and the biggest of all was my appetite became insatiable, I could not stop eating, it was really strange but no matter how much I ate, I wanted more...  that is my story, I will watch this, I bet there are going to be some fun answers, hey good luck to you, they all come out sooner or later.    I hope your child will make your world as wonderful as mine did and still do to this day.|`|bec62dace9d0d98bb1a3ab830e23d22aaa	38 weeks but i was induced.|`|ddP3klT3aa	I was also induced. 41 weeks 3 days. Didn't experience contractions prior.|`|6eIBIOwoaa	I was overdue with both of mine...and I know, walking, sex, etc doesnt always help!!! Good luck!|`|aBziQhx2aa	My first baby was exactly 2 weeks early. The day before I had a crazy urge to clean house and reorganize the kitchen.|`|4Dc44BC5aa	I was induced two weeks passed my due date... I was 1 1/2 cem dilate for 3 weeks....     good luck|`|5UcdeeX8aa	41 & 2 days|`|jOBBlJnvaa	I was induced at 39 weeks. I kept looking for signs and nothing was really happening. Turns out the baby was posterior and probably wouldnt have come for quite a while.|`|701FO16zaa	I was 38.5wks with my 1st. I went into labour on mothers day and he was born 2 days later! The only symptom I had was really bad back pain in my lower back the morning of mothers day and contractions started that night|`|0NRAdYTsaa	I had mine at 39 weeks. Exactly 1 week before her due date. You will feel a lot of "needing to nest" Preparing the nursery, organizing baby cloths and bath tubs and car seats, being motherly and VERY clean. It lasted for a couple days. 2 or 3 max. Went into labor, and it's so messy. It is normal for mothers to have their first baby LATER than their due date.|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	I had my son five days before his due date. There were no signs right up until I started having contractions. I didn't really believe it was happening for hours, either. I think it was, like, six hours before I even told my husband I was in labor because it was so unreal.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	I was induced. I was 41 weeks, 4 days..   Fetal distress.   I had no clue.|`|3klIx1Egaa	41 weeks 3 days, 2 days before being induced (yay)  and i didnt really have any signs besides not being able to get comfortable anywhere. and extremely irritable|`|jgDlkSiWaa	I was 9 days before my due date. I had no signs anything was coming.
iPeiGJpYaa	Well really you are 3 weeks 6 days pregnant. From having your period January 29th. Wow you got a positive result really early, I got my first positive result at 3 weeks 4 days pregnant.<br>  Congrats wishing you a happy nine months<br>  BTW your due date is November 5th 2009 haha never even notices your name|`|6GaHOtH3aa	She told you that you're 4 weeks, because it's counted from the 1-st day of your LMP. I'm 5 weeks pregnant today and my LMP was January 22.  So you due date will be November 4, but your doctor will tell you everything more precise later. Good luck hon!|`|xjjJ3M7kaa	Your four weeks along since you had sex. thats how long you've been pregnant,<br>  <br>  seriously!|`|hoX7hoINaa	Count from the first day of your LMP. Thats how they measure, and the gestational age is actually 2 weeks less than that. But they dont base it off of that.|`|kT7GVOosaa	at this point you should assume four weeks from when you talked to her. they will tell you the exact weeks and days after you have an ultrasound
b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	No, you're not going to hurt anything. But you might at least want to try making it with the leanest beef you can. I've never heard of the singles - do you add your own meat to it? <br>  <br>  Other than that, you might not want to eat it *every night* simply because of the fat content and sodium. But I doubt it will do any harm - pregnant women have been known to eat MUCH worse than that! (i.e. pica behaviors, where they eat things like dirt and ashes, for heavens sake!) <br>  <br>  Who told you not to eat junk food? Maybe not every single day for every meal, but overall I think you'll be fine! :D|`|JT4OSUPeaa	I ate Hamburger Helper when I was pregnant. Whoever told you that you cant eat junk food is full of crap. Your pregnant, you can't eat healthy all the time. Sometimes you just have to satisfy your cravings. Just make sure it's cooked properly.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	well, you CAN help it !  you are the one in control here.<br>  <br>  Why not skip all the additives and preservatives and just boil some water and make some pasta and sauce !|`|T8zPA3FJaa	With my first I ate 2-6 cheeseburgers from Hungry Jacks (Burger King in America), everyday for 2 weeks, bad for my weight, but baby came out healthy.|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	The only thing I would watch out for is the sodium content. Most prepackaged foods like that are very high in sodium. Drink lots of water and you should be fine. <br>  <br>  Bon appetite!|`|hwRdT156aa	i love love love hamburger helper and i eat it; there's nothing wrong with it.|`|RzYePezkaa	It is fine to eat it as long as it is thoroughly cooked or heated and the cans are not dented.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	it's okay to eat hamburger helper!|`|YuVSDBkzaa	Nothing wrong with hamburger helper. I had it the other day. What you need to watch out for is eating a lot of fried foods. You want to watch your weight! I soo regret gaining all the weight I did from my last pregnancy. I never quite lost it all.

They are meant to be above 20|`|AA10405438	Take your iron, keep you and the baby healthy!  I took my iron at night and with food, that helped.|`|AYLRIMZJaa	I would say to do what the doctor told you to do.  He went to school for a very long time to learn to properly diagnose and treat people.  Most of the people on yahoo answers cannot say the same thing.    I'm not sure what iron levels are supposed to be, but again, I would follow doctors orders.  Especially when it comes to a baby's health.|`|5UcdeeX8aa	I take 3 a day. My level is 10, but let me tell you girl take 3 a day now because after you have the baby you will be exhausted and the iron helps.|`|O6G8mdZLaa	I am 32 wks, and my doc said that my iron levels are low too. She said it was 10.7 and they like them to be around 12.  I don't think 30 is low if they are measuring the same way. I am having trouble w/ taking the extra iron though, makes me sick.

Wish i had your problem because i have very curly hair also and i hate it...lol. But i would think that your hair should go back to normal it just may take a while.|`|gGW7K9U5aa	I've heard that after pregnancy, your body does weird things. But I never heard of hair becomming straight. Give it some time, maybe the curls will come back..not sure.   About the losing hair, thats completely normal. Im still losing some hair, my baby is 8 months old now. But I remember for the first couple months, I didnt know how I still had a head of hair..lol!|`|i8NOVfm0aa	i dont know how your hair follicles would of changed like that i've never heard of anything like that. i would say be happy with it lol when your daughter is older you will be happy you dont have to use a straightner! haha|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	Don't you like it straight? I guess it might get curly eventually since it has been that way your whole life. Enjoy the difference before your hair gets back to normal.    I like my postpartum hair, my hair is longer. I don't know if it is because I wore braids during my pregnancy (braids make your hair grow) or because I was pregnant, or both all I know is it is noticeably longer and I like it.
iRc3xhubaa	Some babies will meaure above or below the average, but you doctoe should have those healthy ranges.<br>  <br>  Also, if you ovulated late, it would have proably only have been a few days late.|`|oiJITSNZaa	Your doctor should know. If he doesn't then I would definitely go somewhere else because I would not trust someone who doesn't know every in and out about that little jr growing inside of me!|`|ETL9hDIBaa	I have never heard of all fetus' being the same size till 8wks, however doesn't mean it isn't correct.  <br>  <br>  As for the ovulation question, having a 28day cycle does not mean you will always ovulate on day 14.  Its even possible to ovulate at a different date each cycle with the same cycle length.  The later you ovulate though the shorter your luteal phase is and in turn makes liklihood of miscarrying higher.|`|uzscewygaa	1. yes-not all babies are the same size;<br>  2. yes-the fact that you have normal 28 day cycle leads to a thought that you probably will ovulate on the 14th day, but that is not for sure

Get her a pregnancy test  2. If it is positive, help her tell her parents and get her to a doctor.|`|rpU209Xfaa	get her to take a pregnancy test...  if it says positive get her to a doctor a.s.a.p...  if she wants to keep it she needs to be put on vitamins...  if not a abortion is a choice..  being 13 and pregnant would be very hard...  but adoption is still a choice...  but get her to take a pregnancy test...  just go to wal-mart or somewheres and get one...  just don't wait to long or she could hurt herself...    oh and here is some signs of pregnancy:     10. Tender, swollen breasts  One of the early signs of pregnancy is sensitive, sore breasts caused by increasing levels of hormones. The soreness may feel like an exaggerated version of how your breasts feel before your period. Your discomfort should diminish significantly after the first trimester, as your body adjusts to the hormonal changes.    9. Fatigue  Feeling tired all of a sudden? No, make that exhausted. No one knows for sure what causes early pregnancy fatigue, but it's possible that rapidly increasing levels of the hormone progesterone are contributing to your sleepiness.    You should start to feel more energetic once you hit your second trimester, although fatigue usually returns late in pregnancy when you're carrying around a lot more weight and some of the common discomforts of pregnancy make it more difficult to get a good night's sleep.    8. Implantation bleeding  Some women have a small amount of vaginal bleeding around 11 or 12 days after conception (close to the time you might notice a missed period). The bleeding may be caused by the fertilized egg burrowing into the blood-rich lining of your uterus  a process that starts just six days after fertilization  but no one knows for sure.    The bleeding is very light (appearing as red spotting or pink or reddish-brown staining) and lasts only a day or two. (Let your practitioner know if you notice any bleeding or spotting, particularly if it's accompanied by pain, since this can be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy.)    7. Nausea or vomiting  If you're like most women, morning sickness won't hit until about a month after conception. (A lucky few escape it altogether.) But some women do start to feel queasy a bit earlier. And not just in the morning, either  pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting can be a problem morning, noon, or night.    About half of women with nausea feel complete relief by the beginning of the second trimester. For most others it takes another month or so for the queasiness to ease up.    6. Increased sensitivity to odors  If you're newly pregnant, it's not uncommon to feel repelled by the smell of a bologna sandwich or cup of coffee and for certain aromas to trigger your gag reflex. Though no one knows for sure, this may be a side effect of rapidly increasing amounts of estrogen in your system. You may also find that certain foods you used to enjoy are suddenly completely repulsive to you.    5. Abdominal bloating  Hormonal changes in early pregnancy may leave you feeling bloated, similar to the feeling some women have just before their period arrives. That's why your clothes may feel snugger than usual at the waistline, even early on when your uterus is still quite small.    4. Frequent urination  Shortly after you become pregnant, you may find yourself hurrying to the bathroom all the time. Why? Mostly because during pregnancy the amount of blood and other fluids in your body increases, which leads to extra fluid being processed by your kidneys and ending up in your bladder.    This symptom may start as early as six weeks into your first trimester and continue or worsen as your pregnancy progresses and your growing baby exerts more pressure on your bladder.    3. A missed period  If you're usually pretty regular and your period doesn't arrive on time, you'll probably take a pregnancy test long before you notice any of the above symptoms. But if you're not regular or you're not keeping track of your cycle, nausea and breast tenderness and extra trips to the bathroom may signal pregnancy before you realize you didn't get your period.    2. Your basal body temperature stays high  If you've been charting your basal body temperature and you see that your temperature has stayed elevated for 18 days in a row, you're probably pregnant.    And finally...    1. The proof: A positive home pregnancy test  In spite of what you might read on the box, many home pregnancy tests are not sensitive enough to detect most pregnancies until about a week after a missed period. So if you decide to take one earlier than that and get a negative result, try again in a few days.
eemmWU0Haa	no it shouldn't take that long for your fertility to come back since you only took one shot!|`|eV7rtxmuaa	On average after your last depo shot it will take 14 months to fall pregnant. I fell pregnant 13 months after my last shot.

That child would kill themselves by the time they hit puberty from all the name calling.|`|vqYldLFyaa	Umm..I do not wish at all to disrespect you or the name but you need to think about that name and think about how other people would take it...Sound it out then say it..I mean seriously...I love unique and out there names but honestly I would never name my child "Dyll Doe" because of the way it has to be pronouced..Please for the sake of the child think about this name before you actually name it that..    *Good Luck and i really do hope you think about it  *Konnor's Mommy:)|`|drzN1kkuaa	no, its too...odd;     sounds like dildoe.    shed be made fun of for that|`|tSWyflpjaa	Give all the explanations and excuses you want but if you name your child that, don't be surprised if she is made fun of and tormented. I hope this was a joke and not a serious question... *sigh*|`|o40QqoQGaa	NO!! DONT DO THAT TO YOUR POOR CHILD! IMAGINE IF YOU HAD THAT NAME, AND HOW TRAGIC IT WOULD BE! DONT BE RIDICULOUS!  IF I WERE THAT BABY, AS SOON AS I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO TALK, I WOULD ***** YOU OUT FOR GIVING ME THAT NAME!     GROW UP! STOP BEING OBSESSED WITH DILDOS!|`|IoTanO1gaa	almost as much as the name Puppyporn.  no, really, that's a real name... vietnamese family... sweet little girl, but c'mon.. why do that to a child.  you are very selfish.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Hilarious. Not really.    Now what the heck is a babby? I've heard of a baby, but never a babby. But it figures that someone with such a sophisticated sense of humor would also be such a spelling whiz.
Ka52nbhNaa	I cradle them, holding them tightly so they are on their side with their face is towards my chest, give them their binky, walk around the house or rock them.  They may struggle and cry a bit, but they usually give in and go to sleep relatively quickly.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Turn on white noise and rock with him until he passes out. If he is over tired he will normally cry while we rock but eventually passes out which is what needs to happen.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Turn off the lights, take him into bed with me.  Put a the fan on for white noise.  Rock and whisper to him.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I normally give them a bath and then rock them until they fall asleep.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	rock him|`|9kPPmazoaa	My daughter goes through this every night. Every night and sometimes during the day before napping... she'll start fighting sleep. She'll do anything to stay awake, making noises, rubbing her face and her hair.She just starts getting really hyper, and will just keep wiggling and wiggling to keep herself awake. I think its so cute. Because if she stops wiggling for just a second her eyes will close. Then she'll start wiggling all over again, to wake herself back up. She goes through this same charade a few times before finally dosing off. Sometimes she'll cry alittle as well (more like a light whine, or whimper), What I normally do is lay her on my chest. And let her get all her energy out... moving around and such. If she's crying I'll either pat her back or lightly rock her. If she gets super upset I'll get up and walk around with her for a few minutes. Normally, she gives up fighting sleep and will eventually dose off within a few minutes, and without shedding a tear.|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	i swaddle him, then rock him constantly and he eventually calms down and falls asleep.|`|PymLdXM8aa	i usually just snuggle my daughter tightly. The pressure seems to help relax her. Also sit in a dim or dark room, then since she couldn't see anything she would calm down and fall asleep. GL :)    Oh and by the way i dont know how old your baby is but my daughter is 7.5 mths, and the older they get the harder it is so it is definitley good to find something that works early :)|`|iTXnHiwTaa	It's soooo HARD when that happens. Its always different... a lot depends how much steam I've got left too! Sometimes I'll swaddle and just keep rocking... other times, I take her out of the room and let her quietly play in dim lighting, keep voice soft and try again in 20 min.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	we strap the baby in the stroller and go out for some fresh air. A nice cup of timmies for me, and fresh air for baby works very well as a solution to your problem|`|qKnE08Rxaa	I nurse & rock my baby to sleep. People say don't rock the baby to sleep but if rocking works, I'd go for it!|`|gJrHBtp1aa	You might be in for a bit of crying, but I always gave my son a bath, a nice lotion massage then sit in a low light room and rock until he falls asleep. I always shush which helps. But he's only been extremely overtired once from missing naps and it took about 2 hours to get him to fall asleep, then a really rough night tossing and turning.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Get them more tired!|`|aT7HgLJnaa	If all else fails we bundle him up and put him in the car seat and go for a drive...often times we don't even have to go further than a block or two before he's asleep...sometimes further but he always falls asleep.|`|1F7eYuNWaa	Sing lullabies or play a lullaby CD.  Hold and rock.  Nurse.  Go for a drive.  Turn on a fan for white noise.  Boy, have I been there!|`|41PcwvlLaa	I use the kitchen fan as white noise and rock her to sleep. Usually she is out in 5 minutes.|`|nYtG6js2aa	Dim the lights, and securely hold him close to your skin, gently rocking and stroking him.   At the same time let him hear your voice by humming softly. He will eventually fall asleep exhausted from crying.
AMuVbIwnaa	My daughter is 5 and she prefers to brush her teeth by herself and dress herself before bed. I check to make sure things are done properly and then I read a few books to her. She still wants me to sing to her as well.     Sometimes I can tell that she has gathered books to read after I tuck her in. It's funny - she doesn't realize that we can hear her feet moving while we are sitting downstairs.|`|1XAUxQlDaa	My son is 17 months and has just started putting himself to bed. And my daughter started putting herself to sleep around 20months.|`|2Hhbz16maa	Around 16 months. I tell her it's bed time and she get in on her own.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	My friend's daughter was like 3...all us gals would be over and they'd say "Cayliegh, time for bed" and she'd cry but would go up all on her own.|`|HyknHVV5aa	19? hahah No matter what, when told to do something it's a struggle. So, take it as a blessing your 4 year old will put herself to bed!!!|`|4KXA5oVtaa	It's different for everyone.  We put my son on a routine from the day we brought him home from the hospital.  At 9PM he's in bed regardless of when his naps were, whats going on, ext.  Each time we put him to bed we would say, "It's time to go night, night."  At around 16 months he figured out that 'night, night' meant he was going to go to bed.  Since around 18 months when he gets tired between 8 and 9 he says "Go night, night." And we know he wants to go to bed.  Weather we put him to bed or not, he marches himself back to his room and gets into bed.  I think each child just makes their own decision on when to be independent on different subjects. :)|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Thats a day im looking forward too haha|`|uj1A73ZGaa	My girls have started putting them selves to sleep from the time they were very little.     I have breastfeed all three of my girls and I would feed them before bed time and put them in bed and they would always fall asleep by them self.    They are 2yrs and 2months and they all fall asleep by them self's|`|NBsULHytaa	3 years old|`|r9gBoBLCaa	I nanny:  Tyler, 9. Alexis, 7. Sophia, 5. Noah, Grace & Ryan, 3.  I have only been doing it for a year, but Noah takes himself off to bed, as does Sophia. I can't say the same for the others.
5dRvtaGgaa	I'm so sorry you're going through this and you have my heart right now.  Unfortunately, no one can make the decision for you except you.  Think long and hard about what you really want to do.  Don't let anyone make you feel bad or guilty about the decision you make....it's YOUR life.  Consider the pros and cons and make up your own mind.  Bless you.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	Ok, first, that test is not that accurate.  It said that 2 of my nieces would be born with Down's, and it was wrong both times.  And if the child does actually have Down's syndrome, would you love them any less?  If it matters that much to you to find out, then do so.  But if you aren't going to have the pregnancy terminated either way, what difference does it make?  The baby will be they way it is going to be whether you find out now or not.|`|AA11785285	First, no baby is gods gift... it is you and your husband, and an egg and a sperm meeting.    That said, errors are made... not every egg was ever meant to be a human, not every sperm meant to be a human, and not every pregnancy, as you have found out leads to an APGAR 10 baby (google the term)    In your place, I would not want a Down's child.  I want a perfect baby.  And I would have no problem trying again if I were carrying one.      It is a decision only you can make, hon.  But being a parent ought to be a 2 decade commitment, not one that goes on for your entire life.  And as the mother of a Down's child, you or someone will be a caregiver until it dies.|`|4YCsXqMDaa	my mom had the blood test done and it said that i had down syndrome. she went and got the amniosystesis and it ended up saying that i didnt have down syndrome. and once i was born it was very obvious that i am not down syndrome.      even tho the results came back positive that your baby can have down syndrome, doesnt mean that they will.    that test has a very HIGH false reading.      they can give you an in-depth ultrasound to check and see if the baby has downsyndrome, if they notice anything that looks like the baby has down syndrome, then go get the amnio because its a 100% yes or no.      good luck and i know your worried.      stay strong.|`|UXRwYHrMaa	Yes, what you are calling "mongoloid defect" is typically called Downs Syndrome in the US. If your doctor told you that your chances of having a Down's Syndrome baby have gone to 1 out of 40 cases, that is a fairly strong positive test result. The base rates for a mother who is 28 years old are about 1: 350. But the blood test has a fairly high false positive rate (some estimates a false positive of 20% of cases)    If you know for certain that you would not abort the child even if they do have Downs, which was how my husband and I felt, then I would encourage you to think about NOT having amnio. The amnio results are much more accurate, but also not 100%. nothing is 100%. Amnio is an invasive procedure, and although it is rare, some perfectly healthy babies die from complications from the amnio.     So if you would keep this baby one way or another, then why not decide to accept that the baby has Downs Syndrome, and begin preparing for that. Then whether the baby has Downs or not, you will will be prepared and the baby will be a blessing.    Downs affects both physical appearance and cognitive functioning. but children can be affected to varying degrees. Most children and adults with Downs that I have known are socially warm and loving people who are able to hold a job and live independently (with assistance) and otherwise function in society.     I'm sure there is a good wikipedia in your language on the topic, and likely also some support groups in your area or online. I'm including some cites for you to look at below.    National Downs Syndrome Society: http://www.ndss.org/  Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndro...  French Down Syndrome Support Group: http://www.fait21.org|`|3DZDT4VIaa	im not sure about your question but the test i think is also referred to as a CUBS test. it is optional to check your chances of the baby having downs. if if was to come back and say you have a 1 in 200 chance etc the baby has it that would be classed as high, if there is a high CHANCE the baby has it you would have the option to terminate the pregnancy, but if you chose not to you could spend many months worrying if youre baby has it or not, i dont think they can give you a definite answer but there is some tell tale signs that a scan can detect also. i had a m/c myself prior to my current pregnancy and i declined the test. if my baby has it i will have to deal with it i just feel blessed to have the chance of having a baby good luck xx|`|4D1VEKW5aa	No i dont know what mongolian defect is but Down Syndrome is Trisomy 21 defect. I think that if you dont want to possibly cause a miscarriage then you shouldnt do a amniocentesis. Those other tests just tell you the risks, they dont mean anything. My daughter has down syndrome.
lTkYWiy5aa	I think you have to consider yourself pregnant but remember that even when pregnant you have to live your life. Miscarriages before 12 weeks are due mostly to genetic abnormalities with the fetus and not to what some people consider strenuous activity (I have heard of a woman avoiding lifting a gallon of milk because she was concerned if she might be pregnant). Lots of patience to you in this endeavor.    Good luck and baby dust!!!|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	I always assume I'm pregnant.  I take prenatal vitamins, watch what I eat, how much I lift, etc.  It's way better to be safe than sorry, and I'd rather that little fetus get hooked into my uterus nice and snug than risk a miscarriage.|`|ss48BEk5aa	I never drink after ovulation, lol. I do all my boozing (if any) right after I get aunt flow. You never know! And better safe than sorry! Think of the future child! haha|`|RPszYGXkaa	I try to act pregnant, take my vitamins, don't drink, don't take any meds, etc.  But it is really hard, the two week wait is agonizing.  I don't have too much time to obsess, as I have a toddler, but when she is napping or sleeping...that is when my mind starts racing.  I admire women who have a "que sera sera" attitude, but the suspense drives me nuts!  Baby dust!
hDz2Qe7xaa	I am so happy for you that you have an awesome life. I just have one piece of advice- Don't take anything for granted. Enjoy your life and appreciate how fortunate you are.  People say that the teenage years are the best part of your life, so enjoy them and have fun! ;)|`|r0ISrLc1aa	haha i feeel like you are exaggerating things just a bit|`|4c5726b963122e60694b7e3e59161e71aa	It sounds okay, your pretty, your bf looks ok....  New york rocks!... (new yorkers rule!) But something is missing.|`|5IN0AjxOaa	Somebodys stuck on themself.  If you had alife,  you certainly wouldn't be "bragging' about it on random sites.  Hello?

This section is mainly full of depressed, confused teenagers who havn't the slightest clue where their life is going or if they'll enjoy it once they get there.  It's nice that your happy but it's kind of shitty that you come around here saying these things. Put it in a blog on myspace or something.|`|o3rTWrWPaa	it sounds pretty good. :)|`|tSWyflpjaa	Umm... if you have a good life and know it, why do you have to ask strangers?|`|hfkyWMCyaa	I think you are full of crap.    Are you really that desperate for attention?|`|DhvkQG8saa	sounds good|`|Lkg6iAwlaa	GO STEELERS!!!!!!|`|uVE3JcnVaa	ummmm YEAHHHH!!!!|`|uwVQnby5aa	i think your dad trys to buy your love since your moms not here and he doesnt have time since hes a lawyer  and thats why you have soo much stuff and you and  you try to get him to love you more by getting good grades and trying to be perfect and you and your "boyfriend" dont love each other youve only known him a month
lU8e0VQFaa	POA should be fine as long as it spells out everything that your allowed to do, like if she wants her ears pierced, that your allowed to sign for that, or to get her in school or to the Dr's etc. A guardianship would still probably be better, that way if something that you hadn't planned of pops up there aren't any legal barriers to you helping her.     You could probably hire a lawyer on the cheap to help with the paper work and filing.|`|W8UZebRWaa	I know this doesn't answer your question but while my husband was deployed I was his POA. During our briefings they said I could do whatever I wanted in his name only. When I tried cashing a check in his name the bank refused. POA gives you the right to do everything however I learned the hard way that the places don't have to honor it.  I took it to our Senator and that's what he told me.|`|9kos1a8Jaa	You would need your boyfriend to agree to a POA.    The difference between the two:  POA - Give a person power to do anything that you would do with respect to ... well everything    Guardianship - Is a Probate court matter. You must prove that you are the biological or legal gaurdian. A court can grant gaurdianship based on both biological parents written agreement, with no contest of the child's maternal grandparents, aunts, and uncles and the same for the paternal immedaite family. Quite a lengthy court process. If both parents are willing to authorize you to be their child's legal gaurdian, then you already won round one! If the court grants you gaurdian of the minor child, you are legally responsible for this child 100%    Hope this helped!      GOOD LUCK!
slzx5202aa	Hi hun, first of all relax, lot's of women get gestational diabetes during pregnancy and everything is absolutely fine! My mum had gestational diabetes when she was pregnant with me, and my sister had it with her two pregnancies. You just have to watch what you eat. Your doctor will probably give you a diet plan and ask you to keep an eye on your blood sugar. If you readings are high they may want you to inject yourself with insulin which is what my sister had to do. My sister was induced with her pregnancies because women with gestational diabetes tend to grow big babies, so she was induced both times at 37 weeks. When you have your baby they will check your blood sugar levels and baby's too.. my sister's bsl went back to normal as soon as she gave birth. Everything will be fine.     Here is a really informative website about gestational diabetes.     http://www.diabetesdietsupport.com/gesta...|`|0Sv8PiH9aa	I don't have it so I can't give you a personal experience, I am sorry about that. But what I can tell you is that this is very common and your doctor will keep a close eye on you. You need to eat very healthy and watch your sugars. They will monitor your blood pressure and if anything looks wrong they can help prevent anything happening to your baby. Tons of people have gestational diabetes and have very healthy babies. Just do what your doctor tells you to :)|`|afSqgYBZaa	My sister had GD with her first son - he is a very active and healthy 2 and a half year old today!    Just keep a balanced diet, follow your doctor/dietitians orders and keep track of your blood sugar levels after every meal and I am sure you will be fine!    Remember: healthy and balanced diet with minimal sugar will do you and your baby much good!    God bless you and your little one!|`|AA12046874	You won't lose your baby to this as long as you go to the doctor regularly. Just tell them your concerns, ask them what you need to do. I know you have to be careful what you eat/drink. I think you can only drink water and you have to stay away from things that have a lot of sugar. Gestational Diabetes isn't uncommon at all. My mom had it and all that will happen is your baby will be big lol.|`|AsICkz9naa	Gestational diabetes happens to lots of women. If you follow the guidelines given to you by your doctor or midwife, then you and your baby will be absolutely fine.
b2hH8tPAaa	its not hard.    you either dont eat, you work out alot, you throw up what you eat, or you are just naturally skinny.|`|FmgAfeWuaa	so they can wear the small clothes  and because they think its part of the style    and scene is dead and emo doesnt exist  and hello scene people wear dark clothes  too not just colorful    the colorful ones are mostly popcore    you people all need to get a life    all this crap was like so 2006|`|wDNTZODxaa	Most of them just don't eat and drink water which is zero calories so pretty much day by day they get thinner. I know its gross.. rite?|`|GuS4alrGaa	I'm considered "emo". I'm extremely skinny, yet I weigh 105 lbs.   I eat when im hungry and have snacks very often, and I drink a crap load of soda and what not.

It's a stereotype.|`|85c7b5c821a7ba39949a3307cf876e59aa	since there is a lot of pain attached to the culture, they usually have eating disorders, they work out alot, or they just are skinny =]|`|VDWzEw3aaa	i cut off my stomach.    rawr.    eff off scene h8rs.
tkkYIdIvaa	Somone told me that my middle name C'bell pronouced see-bell was stupid. Never did they say they didn't like my son's name. But when I was talking about a daughter named Sawyer they couldn't let it drop.    By the way I love Jordyn and Aaliyah Mae and Harli-lynn those names are awesome!|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	I'm expecting my first baby and we have decided on the name Kaylyn Noel. In my area, its unheard of. We looked it up on the ss index and the name Kaylin was in the 400s in the past 7 years.    Some people have said that don't like the name Kaylyn. I don't care, its not their baby and its not like my baby can be made fun of.    The reason behind the spelling 'kaylyn' is because my middle name is Lyn. I also like "ys" lol.     My cousin has 3 children and her children's names are:  Da'Michael Mcdaniel( we call him michael lol)  La'Daisha Salmone( we call her day day though or daisha)  Lakevonna Nikyla Ali( we just call her ali though)    and people always give her weird looks because what she named her children.    I like your children's names though, even the spelling. People should keep their rude comments to themselves if they can't find nothing nice to say lol.|`|YvNOfM2xaa	Gosh! How could someone say that?!   It is very rude to complain about other peoples child(ren)'s name!  Of course they gave the name for a reason and I couldn't imagine saying " Oh I Don't like that name! Change it! How could you name her that! " ect....  Of course if the parent names a kid Apple I would be thinking "Wow" but I still wouldn't say anything!  Some people are just rude!  Btw I love the names your children have! Don't feel bad!  They are beautiful and unique!    Good luck and hope no1 ever says that again!|`|3ERKIfqIaa	Yes...when i was pregnant...i didn't know what i was having so i picked out a boy and a girl name and NO ONE liked them they always told me how ugly they were...for the girl i had Angela Danielle and for the boy i had Elijah Noel....everyone snarled their nose...I didn't care and still don't...I love my Elijah Noel....and his name and they do now too...but now i am soo glad i didn't have a girl...lol...i haven't had a girl yet but i got her name and NO ONE likes it either...hahaaaaa...Mikiah Joelle.......don't care...they get over it|`|oRBi01sbaa	No one has ever said that to me, however, my boys are Daniel and Benjamin.  I think your children's names are beautiful and unique.|`|mxUSASXnaa	My name is Harly Morgan and I think it's an amazing name. Don't worry about whatever other people say. I think their names are gorgeous. Those people are just jeolous that they didn't have that name, and that couldn't have even come up with those names if they tried. I don't think anybody should ever say that they think names are ugly or terrible when they asked what they were. I can't beleive how rude people are nowadays. Have fun with your little ones and know that their names are unique and special and beautiful. I think that your birth name is the only one that will ever fit you just right.|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	Yep, we heard it at the hospital the day she was born!  I called a friend of my mother's that we are very close to, to tell her that the baby had been born.  She asked me how big she was, what time she was born etc. and then she said "What is her name?"  I said "Larkyn" and her reply was "WHAT"  I repeated it and she said "Oh" in a very disappointed way (she wanted me to name her Peggy!).      Quite often we hear "Where did you get a name like that?"  or "Why did you choose that name?".  Some people just have nothing better to do than to judge everything about other people.    Don't let it get to you.  My mom's friend now says she loves that name but it took her some time to get used to it.  She knows that this little girl is very different so she fits her different name.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Well, we live in a society where people often think they can say anything that pops into their head. It is a bad reflection on their upbringing and self-control.     It seems that a lot of young couples are making up names that are unusual, and personally I don't care for it. But it is the parents perrogative to name their children whatever they want, so I NEVER fault them for it.    I guess if someone said that to me, I would give them a long serious gaze and then simply walk away. It might shock them into realizing that they have overstepped their boundaries.|`|bfjs9wSLaa	No, but it happened to my 3 month old neice at walmart.  they asked what the name was, and i told them "caylee marie jessica lynette" and i am not the mother, my older sister is, and my sister and twin sis (we are 17) just walked away with jessica  but, i WENT OFF!  i screamed, and was like "don't you have any f'n manners? you BEEP u don't BEEP'in know what the BEEP manners are right u lil' BEEP."  just go off  they do NOT have a right to say that.|`|PTP8ptDbaa	well they have said it to my sister! her kids names aren't that bad  the boy's is  Jeremiah  the girl's is Anna Lucia   but you're kids names might be a little too unique i don't mean to offend you. i am just saying that some people do not like those names i am not like them!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I have had people tell me, thats wrong, when I say my daughters name.  It happens a lot, and I am like..How could I be wrong about my child's name.  They will ask what her name is, and I will say Annaleas (I pronounce it AnnaLees  and they will say, Oh you mean Annalise  And I am like..no Annaleas  And the say, actually I believe it is pronounced Annalise.  And I say, I think I know what I named my child.  Haha|`|dPULl5hjaa	No one YET has said they don't like my teens names:  Sarah Ann  Aaron John    And I don't really care!

I have a daughter named Jordyn as well. Many people have complained about it and even the spelling of it.    Don't you love it when people tell you Jordyn is a boy's name?|`|45nSn7Rcaa	No one ever said that to me about my kids names, but I've sure thought it about some other peoples names...thing is I have the good grace and manners I was raised with to not say anything.  We all have our opiniions of something about someoen and we can talk about them in the privacy of our own homes...but if we say something to the person than we are completely out of line and rude...tell those people to their faces that they are being rude and you are sure thier parents did not raise them to be rude and would be ashamed to hear them speak like that to someone.....I would.|`|hThW3ioKaa	No one has ever complained about my kids' names but they are fairly normal names- Julian, Gabrielle, and Nathan.     But I really only answered this question because I wanted to tell you that I love the names you chose for your children and I think they are beautiful!!!!   :)|`|547Ln6rNaa	No, but they never spell it right and there are only two spellings and the other one is the less common one!      Incidentally, people should not be telling you they do not like your children's names unless the question, very specifically is: Do you like my children's names?    Any other comments on them is just bad manners.
hwRdT156aa	27 wks = 6 months 3 wks.<br>  <br>  28 wks = 7 months.<br>  <br>  32 wks = 8 months.<br>   <br>  36 wks = 9 months.<br>  <br>  40 wks = baby should almost be here!!|`|QSodlfMraa	6 months<br>  28 weeks you will be in your 7 months.<br>  3rd trimester|`|NPmRmnG6aa	You are seven months and at your third trimester. <br>  <br>  This link tells you what week is what month.<br>  <a href="http://www.baby2see.com/pregnancylength.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.baby2see.com/pregnancylength....</a>|`|LFXTpqfdaa	In regular calendar months you are 6 & 1/4 months out of 9. All you have to do is divide your # weeks by 4.33 because there are 4.33 weeks in the average month. <br>  <br>  Some people put only 4 weeks in a month, but don't listen to them. That would mean that we are pregnant for 10 months since 4x10=40. Who wants to be pregnant for 10 months, lol?|`|iPeiGJpYaa	technically speaking you are in your 7th month until the 28th then it is the 8th month, there is really 10 months in a pregnancy, I think it is confusing. Like I am in my 12th week and that is the beginning of my forth month even though I wont be in my forth month until my 16 week confusing huh?|`|hoX7hoINaa	I always counted from the beginning. MY LMP was 06/19/08 so on the 19th of each month I considered myself another month along. so you'd be about 6-61/2 months. At 28 weeks you're considered in the last trimester.|`|C8E3fe3xaa	You will be in month 7 next week. Congrats! :)|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	You are in your sixth month, going on seventh month. From 28-31 weeks you are seven months, from 32-35 weeks you are eight months, and from 36-40 you are nine months.|`|4GwTDea1aa	You are 6 months and your 28th weeks will the 1st weeks of yor 7th month!<br>  Congratualations|`|lnk5Sh7Kaa	6 months and 3 weeks is 27 weeks. The third trimester typically begins the 29th week.|`|SmWuSrHYaa	almost 7 months I think
SbfGrnFaaa	its called "life"|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	Have you  broken any mirrors?  I had the same problem at your age.  I coulda sworn I had seven years of doom.|`|4c5726b963122e60694b7e3e59161e71aa	no such thing as karma.... Unless you pick at other people the you should expet it But i think your just nerves when you see a guy. I am the same way... One guy came to me and said where it the bathroom ( note this was at my job) i looked at my co-worker and said where is the bathroom lol.  she told him. i kinda smile and said i don't go to the mens room often lol.  just play it off. Tell him  you were thinking of something.
5kKkENvwaa	4 days late really isn't a big deal, sometimes when your stressed it can be delayed but if you have taken a couple of tests then i highly doubt your pregnant..sometimes it just happens, ive always known or had a feeling when i was pregnant and taken the tests early because im an impatient person lol, and every time i was pregnant i often know when my breast hurt.|`|64OsCr8laa	i took a test 4 days before my period to shout my mom up ( i was coming home to take care of my sick sister she wanted to make sure i was not) i kept telling her its not gonna show yet and there is no way im pregnant we were not planning it until after i got these cyst taken care of <br>  <br>  well any way i was surprised to get a postive 4 days before and now in 6 weeks with bad cramps and horrible morning sickness|`|MQ83HGD5aa	I was 3 weeks late before I tested. I had just come off birth control so I wasn't sure if it was that or if I was actually pregnant!|`|JT4OSUPeaa	I took a test when my period was 2 days late and the HPT + was very positive. It'll be ok, just think positive and wait until Friday.|`|hoX7hoINaa	My cycles range from 28-33 days. Once I hit 35 days I tested and it was positive with First Response and Clear Blue Digital.
CSOIZLhkaa	I tested yesterday (8days before my period) & i got a positive & I used the first response ones too :) not just one but two of them, & they both says yes!!|`|FSPAKELyaa	with my second baby we started trying on the 12 of January and i took a positvie test on the 22nd January :)  Only prob with that is when you find out so early you have a long long wai!|`|afSqgYBZaa	Wow, your hormones must be off the chart!    I tested positive 3 days after missed period.|`|ei6dMFYGaa	Everyone is different maybe you just havfe a lot of the hormone or it is multiple embyos/.|`|wKJrZhj3aa	I tested pretty early. About 8 or 9 days before my period was due. My boobs just hurt so much and I was already throwing up, and my friend swore up and down that i must be pregnant. she was right. :)|`|3zg7oBA5aa	Maybe you're going to have twins? :)    in any case, good luck with your pregnancy and a safe delivery mama!|`|eN5xA6RKaa	you could be further along than you are. my friend tested way before her peroid was due and got a positive. when she went to the doctor she found out she was over a month and a half pregnant already.she got a false period the month before, so she didnt test then and didnt think she was pregnant, then she started feeling symptoms so she took one like a week and a half before her period was due..so thats like 10 days..that could be whats up, or you might just have a very high amount of hormones in yoru body, or it could be more than one baby, because more hormones are given off when your pregnant with multiples. congrats.|`|znlpUd9Taa	How long is your cycle?      Just wondering because the tests have nothing to do with when your period is but rather when you ovulate.  Some women (maybe you) ovulate earlier in their cycle than others (ovulation on average occurs 14 days after the first day of your last period) therefore the egg would implant and then secrete enough hCG for the test to detect earlier than in other women.    Usually a test will be accurate 12-14 days after ovulation occurs, which if you have a 35 day cycle, ovulating on day 14, then a test would work on day 26-28, which would be 7-9 days before your period.    I found out 2 days before my period.  I have/had a 29 day cycle and I ovulated on the 14-15th day.
50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	it is not weird, it is actually very common|`|u1uECuFNaa	I want twins.  I have four kids. No twins. I always wanted twins.   One baby is hard.  I think we look upon it as cute. Matching outfits. Double the pleasure. Double the fun. LOL  Twice the diapers, twice the feedings, twice the crying.   Twice the hugs. Double the love.|`|1m9cWAEhaa	its not weird i want to have twins too but it doesnt run in my family so i probably wont get them :[|`|AA10405438	It's okay.  I always wanted twins and was never blessed with them.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	im 31 weeks with twins....and let me tell you...even though i already love my kids dearly, it has not been an easy pregnancy! i had morning sickness so badly for two or more months in the beginning...i lost 15 pounds! now, being 31 weeks i am so uncomfortable and in so much pain. i can't wait till its over and they are here. it wlll be hard yes, but i cant wait.    its not bad that you want twins, but thats just an experience from someone carrying twins. :o)|`|nJcCSvv4aa	Nope! That's not weird at all! I'm engaged, and when my fiance and I decide to have kids, I hope we have identical twins! And there's no need to feel awkward. Don't stress it! Being a parent will be fun, twins or not! I guarantee it! Don't worry, it will all turn out well. But twins are more rare than just one. So I would make sure I wasn't wishing to hard, but I hope you get twins! :-)    Good Luck, And All The Best For You And Your Soon To Be Baby   -Katy|`|iKPSOMiSaa	no, i always wanted twins. i had one though that is like two in one and he's full of energy. i think twins are great|`|eemmWU0Haa	Im a twin....I would love to have twins as well, there so cute!|`|a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	That's not that weird. I wouldn't mind having twins either and they run in my family, but I will be happy with at least one. Good luck!|`|GObmVQk3aa	Nope. Of course not. :) That's great, actually. Although it is a little harder.|`|UXRwYHrMaa	I sort of wanted them for a while too, but you can't control it, so in the end we'll all just have to be happy with what we get. I think it is perfectly nice for you to enjoy wanting and thinking about different things for your pregnancy.|`|ufTjv25Jaa	Lol i'm only 13 so I don't know anything about pregnancy and raising a child, but one day when I have children I would LOVE to have twins. Always dreamt about having twins lol.   I've also always wanted to BE a twin :P|`|Ka52nbhNaa	I didn't go into it wanting twins . . . but was blessed with twins - they are 5 months old.  Sure it was tough on some days during the pregnancy and I am sure that we will have tough days ahead in parenthood . . . but I would not have it any different.
cAtWxJG1aa	our pediatrician recommended honey, and it works great on our kids    though obviously if it's a severe cough, there are other symptoms, or your child is having trouble breathing then you need to find a way to get to the doctor or hospital.|`|dZxjXHA2aa	If you have Vicks vapor rub an odd but super effective cough beater is rubbing it on the soles of his/her feet then covering with socks!  Also try: hot milk or tea with honey|`|egAIuHQxaa	Honey and Lemon    Orange Juice|`|2uDlTBuUaa	Honey and lemon is good.  Have you tried having her sit in the bathroom with the shower on so them steam loosens her cough?  I do this for my daughter because she gets chronic coughs from her asthma, it seems to help.
3WWHWsHOaa	I'd smack him upside the head and tell him its a little late now. He probably should have made that clear before the pregnancy.|`|S3WeYrVgaa	Tell them too late.  And if they are not accepting of the ones on the way then get out.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Tell them that they're just going to have to deal with it or leave.|`|frpCK0utaa	I'd make it very clear he better get used to the idea of three kids, as i didnt do this all by myself.|`|547Ln6rNaa	He's just having a panic that everything will be different and it will upset the balance of his happy home life.    Just tell him it's going to be ok.     Twins will be amazing! I wish I could have twins.|`|g5JeSJbNaa	you need to follow your heart only you can make the right  decision but i would tell him that he needs to take responsibility for his actions that  either he accepts all 3 children or none|`|14pjwQPLaa	Assuming he was my husband, I'd say,"Tough cookies.  Twins is what we're gonna have, get used to it."    If he was just my male ho, I'd figure that I was going to get ditched and I'd feel really, really stupid right about now.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	see ya!|`|jdRKZe18aa	I'd say "here's your hat & coat buddy, what's your hurry"|`|UUpsa35Daa	I would tell him he could get lost.    If he doesn't want to love all of them than he wouldn't be worth my time or love nor my kid's time or love.|`|V1MptCMiaa	Tell him too bad, it's three kids or you're leaving and he'll have zero kids.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Something is really out of whack on this one. Was there any reason given? Do they want a paternity test? No one in their right mind would say they only wanted half of their children. On a shopping trip maybe -- haha, I had my husband pull that one. But not for keeps.  U have some BIG issues going on here. Find out what is going on deep down inside of the mate's head.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I would kick him in the nuts and say, well you should have thought of that before you didn't wear a condom|`|GWRP3vLQaa	If he said that to me, he'd be sleep with air from now till doomsday.
hl5WdXnbaa	Definitely not under 14.. I know some people think there kids can "handle it" But many kids would never tell there parents they had a problem with the movie, that something they saw bothered them. They want to seem grown up and mature so they will just keep it in.   I am a social worker by profession and work with many children's counsellors . They see many kids who have been very upset after watching "saw"( and others like it) movies that they do not sleep well and now it is affecting their health. Or kids who have developed bed wetting issues. ... and even have become depressed. The parents never had a clue that it was because of a movie the child has watched. We forget that kids process things different than adults.. the lines between what is real and what is fake is not so defined for them.      There is enough evil in this world, our kids will see it soon enough. What ever happened to letting kids be kids and not exposing them to such real adult issues? I do not wrap my kids in cotton..but I am not going to knowingly expose them to something that could hurt them.|`|T4zxS0hIaa	i'm with army wife|`|R8w9mth1aa	Depends how bad the movie is. Sexual stuff, not so bad, but violence can provoke many bad things|`|48RjJrxnaa	It's tacky and a poor judgment in parenting.|`|9ydJQr5zaa	That's very irresponsible of the parent, rated R movies have sex, violence, and other thing children should not be watching. I am not saying they shouldn't know about, but that doesn't mean they should watch or hear any of those things. Movies may sometimes set a bad example or influence children to do things they shouldn't. For 13 year old they have PG13 and for younger PG and G for a reason.|`|o503YPrqaa	OK I went to see The Unborn... I saw a couple who brought in 2 4 year olds and an Infant. Thought it was PG-13 ( i thought it was R) It scared the **** out of me. Thats poor parenting in my mind. But R rated films depend on the child. I take my 16 year old sister to R movies. Thats fine. My mom took me to R rated movies around 13 or 14. I love movies. I love all kinds of movies.. I think it depends on the childs maturity. My nephew watched The Shining at age 8 on TV and thought his dad was gonna hurt his mom... That was on TV not HBO but basic cable..  SO if you have a problem with your kids seeing R movies dont show them and turn the channel. I will probably take my kids to see R movies when they are mature enough to see them. Depending on the film too. Too much horror maybe not that even scares me! But i dont wanna take my kids to be their "buddy" i take them to let them watch a movie they want to see. if they dont wanna go they dont have to.. im not forcing them.. I know some children who are more mature and show interest in films that are rated R , and some are not. IT depends.. I mean you cant judge, its a movie.. Unless the child is being physically, mentally or emotionally abused I don't think a movie would do that. UNLESS its a horror and a small child .but come on ask your kid what they want to see.. if they want to see an R film and they are mature enough then fine.. Whatever.. its strictly a person to person basis. and SHOULD not include everyone its generalizing. I think there are some adults who are too immature to see certain films..|`|bNvChlo9aa	It's not appropriate for a child to see an R rated movie before they are a teeanger at least. I have watched some R rated movies with my thirteen-year-old though as she is very mature for her age (we saw Chicago and Pretty Woman and The Rocky Horror Show because the first and last have good music and she enjoyed them).|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I really like rules and order and I trust the rating board to properly rate our movies and tv shows. I don't care what the "other kids" are doing, I don't want my child to see R rated movies and MA tv shows while they are under age.    I also grew up this way. I never saw ANY of the horror movies as a kid. My friends couldn't believe this. We didn't even have basic cable until I was 16. I never felt like I was missing out. At any given moment there is always a wide range of movies to see at the theaters. Kids don't need to see adult movies.|`|GfCjZJbXaa	I have always acted more mature all my life.Im only 13 now and people mistake me for 17.When Jacka** 2 came out I asked my dad to take me.He said yes because he knew that I could handle it.In the movie there was nudity and he made me cover my eyes.I dont think that parents should take a child to an r rated movie just cuz the parents wants to see it.However it is not abuse at all.Abuse is neglecting,hitting and telling and saying unnecesary things.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	depends on what it is R for. if it is R for violence or war scenes, something like that...i think its okay once the parent believes the child is mature enough to see it. if its for sexual reasons then i dont think a parent should take a child period, even if theyre 16.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	Saving Private Ryan is a rated R movie.  I wanted to see at 17.  My parents let me see it.  Thats not abuse thats a modified history lesson.    I still don't see an issue with a 13 or 14 or 15 year old seeing that movie.  Its still rated R.    Abuse is a strong word to throw around.  Its a movie.  Its not something done to the child.  Abuse is if you tape a child to a chair and make them watch Chucky.  That is abuse with a movie.  A rated R movie is not abuse.  Its a movie.|`|838VJJGvaa	It depends on the age and maturity of the child.|`|UUpsa35Daa	Okay really, people need to stop throwing around the word abuse. It is not, and has never been, abuse to take your child to a movie. Taking them to an R rated movie at a young age is irresponsible and kind of stupid but it's certainly not abuse. That is a legal term and "adults" should be mature enough to use it as such.    And the fact that you feel the need to put quotes around parents just because you don't agree with their parenting techniques is bull. If someone doesn't agree with how you raise your kids does that make you any less of a parent? No it does not and i have an incredibly strong feeling that you would find that highly offensive.    I agree with you that taking kids to R rated movies is in poor taste but i disagree with how you went about complaining about it and making it known.|`|EMKuBql8aa	I kinda agree. There is enough violence/sex in this worl without parents throwing it in their face.     My parents used to bring me to the local drive in and it had 2 movies playing, one after the other. They always choose the first one to be kid friendly, then the second movie, we all were to go on our truck bed and go to sleep on an air mattress they threw back there, lol.|`|14pjwQPLaa	Depends on what the R is for. If it's for extreme violence or graphic sexual conduct, then no. If it's just for language, then hey, they hear worse at school.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I think saying its abuse is really taking it a step to far.  Some kids can handle movies better then others.  I mean, I wouldn't take my kid to see Passion of the Christ, but I am sure a 16 year old could handle Scary Movie or like the Matrix|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Depends on the individual movie. Obviously a parent should not take a child to see a movie like "Crank" wether the child is 5 or 15. But some documentaries and War stories are rated R for content that is not offensive or even graphic.|`|Gqs6H0Z0aa	I don't really consider it abuse, but more of an ignorant, irresponsible decision. But, it would depend on the movie and the age of the child. It happens, there are more important parenting issues to worry about.|`|83526d824d95bdede455e1f500079e1daa	I don't agree with you, really. My kids are really young, so I don't have this issue yet, but I think that it depends on the movie. And the maturity of the kid. I certainly wouldn't bring my kid to see a scary movie, because that's awful. Or a movie about the Holocost. But, Sex and The City? I dont' think I'd mind if someone brought their 12 year old to that. Sure, it's mature content, but it isn't something they haven't heard before, and if there's a dialogue between child and parent about the subjects in the movie, then I dont' think it's an issue. But like I said, there are many rated R movies that this opinion doesnt' apply to-scary ones, or ones with horrific subject matter are another story. But to generalize and say that all parents that bring their kids to R movies are abusive is a little much!|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	stay out of it
AVePRVWKaa	I will also be 38 weeks on saturday, and I have heard of this method, but I don't think  I will be trying it, because what I have heard is that it can cause you to contract (eventually) and the contractions will be really strong and hard, but will not cause and dilation.  <br>  I will admit that with my last son, I tried pumping to jump start labor  and stopped because it was too painful and wasn't doing anything.

bTlhBX3daa	Your midwife is correct. The baby still has LOTS of room to move around at this point, so just because you aren't feeling him/her, doesn't mean he/she isn't moving around. Before 20 to 22 weeks, movements are typically sporadic. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and Congratulations.|`|GxYtTjUbaa	I'm in my second pregnancy waitin to feel my baby move but yes thts completely normal|`|JraarTEIaa	IM 16 WEEKS AND A FEW DAYS and started feeling my baby move SUNDAY, but i still dont feel movement everyday. i think we are okay--- this is my 3rd baby. congrats. i love when they start moving, i can relax.|`|7k3489qHaa	like u im 17w and 3 days and ive been feeling some movements but havent been for a while so i wouldnt worry just yet. when u get to 20-22 weeks u shud feel it more frequent then.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	my sister is having her 4th pregnancy, she did miscarry one, but its still her 4th, she has been feeling the baby move since 12 weeks, and she only felt it for 1 week then didn't feel anything until 17 weeks, she says it moves everyday now but not enough to keep her awake at night "yet"<br>  <br>  i am almost 16 weeks and had lots of flutters on saturday but didn't feel anything until today, i guess its all normal, i got worried so got out my fetal doppler and found a very strong heartbeat and realised i was stressing over nothing, dont worry if you dont feel the movements, it will be moving you just cant feel it all of the time yet|`|DXLfbKUBaa	because its your second baby you are probably more aware of the sensation of your baby moving, if you are worried im sure if you pop back to see your midwife she will sound you for babies heartbeat, Good Luck
hhCOeMoVaa	hi well anything that you ea your baby eats too and also the sensation that you feel might not happen to the baby because the baby only takes the nutrians from your body so they can grow stronger.....i hope this was some help can you help me with my questions if you can please|`|aKiynqA6aa	unborn babies don't taste food, the nutrition they need goes from mom through the umbilical cord directly into the baby's stomach.  i've heard spicy foods might make the mother uncomfortable, i've heard that it can induce labor, but i eat spicy foods all the time and i've never had any problems.

MIUzgwsTaa	I say anycolor that is light,  Looking at your photo I can tell that will really bring your face features out some, and also the lip ring which im really digging!  Colors to avoid:  Gray! (that's a little too much)  Brown (almost every girl have some of those)  Dark Blue(so noticable)  Red(SO demonic looking)    I really think like a honey looking color is cute for you|`|KfxTNNP5aa	Whats the deal with the scribbling and the black dot?|`|ameJkDgpaa	i think a bluish-grayish color would be good|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i think gray|`|yIdwMPsoaa	Green.|`|LTWlBSFNaa	blue|`|tt6SzpTFaa	Crystal blue would be fierce on you :) Especially with that hair color.  Question..why is there a black dot over your nose and a scribble in the corner??|`|hnKRu0jwaa	i THINK GREEN. I HAVE BLK HAIR ALSO AND MY EYES ARE GREEN IT'S REAL HOTT.|`|5j0NgLDmaa	How about a teal-turqoise color|`|C156l7vWaa	are you asking about colored contacts? I think turquoise would be a cool color on you|`|5OsSGCdAaa	i would say green...just cause u rarely see a girl that has black hair and green eyes...|`|ufTjv25Jaa	I would say a birhgt-ish green, but your eyes are fine the way they are :)    BTW, why is your nose blurred out?|`|kVZoeh9paa	Green or like a green-blue :P|`|DhvkQG8saa	blue green|`|r0ISrLc1aa	i think blue would look really good with your hair|`|bhf03ppxaa	a navy blue or bright blue or green
SA1y0lm1aa	your not preg.... and the more you stress the latter you period can be.... your cycle is just off can be caused by stress exercise you name it ..... if its been a month and the test said no then you are not.... so no more stress..... the test shows you are preg as soon as yo u have missed your period even before some times....|`|qxqGbiELaa	I would say call yor doctor and get a blood test.... quick and easy and no more questions.  if you don't have a doctor try planned parenthood or another resource, but if you are pregnant, now is the time to find out!  Early prenatal care is very important!|`|9mtlEO59aa	Maybe you should go to the doctor and have a blood pregnancy test. They are more accurate.|`|xjjJ3M7kaa	Wait for a week and then take a test again.<br>  <br>  Or go to your doctor.|`|w1RjGzUOaa	you could try another home test as if you are pregnant it will be more visible on the test stick now but i would recommend going to see your doctor and asking for a blood test as this would be a lot more reliable, my last period was 23rd jan 09 and ive done 3 tests at home that are very faint positives so had blood test done at doctors and ive just got a positive result back, good luck hope you get the results that you want.|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	Go to the doctor and get a blood test done.|`|RzYePezkaa	Get a blood test done or test with first morning urine try a different test while it is possible to get a false negative always better to follow up with your doctor sometimes stress or a change in diet can throw your period off but your best bet is to see your doctor.
zbjaBgyEaa	I'm a Natalie - So naturally I'm quite biased towards it.  I love seeing it on people's lists.  It means other people love the name as much as my parents did.  I think it's nice.    I also really love Lucy (so sweet - it's simple and refreshing) and Carolyn (one of my top favourites as well).    Rosalind is lovely.  It's very elegant and classy, but also has the potential to be really cute, through nicknames like Rose or Rosa.    Eliza is lovely as well.    The only name I dislike is Harper.  Well, I don't dislike it.  I just like in on the other gender.  It's on my boy's list, actually.|`|VHHis05Naa	Eliza--love  Lucy--love  Rosalind--like  Harper--dislike  Carolena--Carolina is better  Valerie--blah  Natalie--ok  Carolyn--ick  Riva--meh|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Eliza-ehh its ok but i wouldnt name my baby that  Lucy- Its a classic i think its cute  Rosalind- Sorry sounds like a maid in a hotels name  Harper- Didnt even know this was a name but yuck  Valerie- Not a fan of   Natalie- Simply beautiful  Carolyn- Cant stand   Riva- sorry not a fan|`|aS8TjALBaa	Eliza - No  Lucy - yes  Rosalind - no  Harper - no maybe middle if mom's maiden name  Carolena - no but what Caroline  Valerie - no  Natalie -no  Carolyn - yes  Riva - no|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	My daughter is Natalie - so I looooooooove that one.  LOL    Eliza is a nice spin off of Elizabeth.  I like it.  Lucy is cute and simple, but classic.  Roaslind - not thrilled with this spelling.  I prefer Rosalyn  Harper is a surname in my opinion.  Carolena - this is cute.  I love Carolena, but you will likely have to tell people how to pronounce her name.  Valerie is good.  You don't hear it often at all!    Carolyn - this is cute, but I prefer Caroline.  Riva - I'm not sure how to pronounce this one.  Ree-vah?  Ry-vah?  I think it may cause more confusion than it's worth.|`|n1mwxljzaa	i like Harper, Valerie, and Natalie|`|7adzqyGgaa	i like Eliza, and  Riva|`|94to8aeMaa	Lucy or Eliza i love those names lovely. but u should always think what they would be shortend to like by the childs friends like..

Especially after I read "To Kill a Mockingbird" back in high school. I think it's cute, and modern, without going over the top. I like Harper Lynn is precious.

s4LWmcTjaa	Yes.  I live in the state of Texas.  And for the record, I don't believe abortion is the answer.  Please consider life for your baby.    Here are the facts on the age and parental consent:  http://www.alamowomensclinic.com/abortio...    But I beg of you to consider life.  Nothing is so bad that an abortion will fix it.  Two traumas don't heal a person.  I will pray for you.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Depends on the state, I'd call your local Planned Parenthood for help, they don't judge, they just want to do what's best for you.|`|5EOLbVzQaa	yes they have to sign consent forms your not an adult yet...so sad another kid killing a baby cause she couldn't keep her legs closed.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	In my state any child under 16 needs parental consent. As far as I am aware in Texas it is not required.|`|547Ln6rNaa	The question wasn't "Do you agree with abortion?" it was "Does a parent have to be present in order for a minor to get an abortion?".    Try to stay on topic here. When it's a 20 or 30 year old women who should know better, go on and have a go, but this is a kid, a fifteen year old child, if you spoke to her like that in the street you could be charged with abusing a minor, especially be careful making sexual comments, whether she is pregnant or not she is still a child.    I don't know the answer honey but as adults and mothers, we should be sticking up for you.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	You need the parental consent of at least one parent in Texas, so yes they would have to be there to sign the consent forms.|`|nfzQkvqraa	not in my state.    EDIT:  Thanks for the thumbs down,  I appreciate it.  IN the state of Texas you must notify at least one parent/guardian before having an abortion if under the age of 17|`|OUsYmvgSaa	theres a simplayer solution dont get knocked up at 15      enjoy hell|`|qLkMSEBwaa	Killing an innocent baby because the 15 year old can't take responsibility for her actions.  There are many women who can't have kids and would give that innocent baby a good loving home..But, the question shows, this person is not even woman enough to own up to this to her parents if they don't want them knowing!!!!!!    Abortion is the ultimate child abuse!!!!!!!!!  Just because it's legal doesn't make it right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Murder is still murder in or out of the womb!!!!!!!!!!!!!    I would speak to anyone like this and I can't be charged with crap!!!!!!!!  Truth is truth like it or not.  She is woman enough get pregnant, she needs to be woman enough to face up to what shes done!!!!!!!  Her parents have a right to know what she is about to do!!!!!!!  If you don't agree with that, then you must be one of the many who don't care!!!!!!
9kos1a8Jaa	No it does not cost a lot of money. And you you do not need an money sucking attorney to do this for you. Just go to your local court house and request a 'Petition for Name Change' package. You will receive instructions on how to change the minor's last name, you will be asked the reason(s) for the name change, and will obtain a hearing date. You may need to notify the paternal father regarding the hearing, just in case he contested it...which by the way you described, he would not care. In this case, if he does not contest it, or show up to the hearing, the court will grant the name change (on most cases).    My suggestion, you DO NOT need an attorney to respresent you. This process is easier than you think.  If you live in California, I may be able to provide you with help or information, just send an email to creativebliss3@yahoo.com -- In the title of the Email enter: NEED LEGAL FORMS so I can identify you and your case.|`|T4zxS0hIaa	yes it will cost alot of money my step father adopted me when i was 14 and it was costly but an attorney will be able to answer and take care all of this for you! but remember if you take all his rights you won't be able to get help from him... ever... hope all this helps|`|dPULl5hjaa	Yes, it will cost money.  Contact an attorney asap.|`|ixJSutYuaa	It requires a court order. The judge will decide if it is in the best interest of the child. In your case I see no reason why it wouldn't be. The father is signing over his rights so he can't object to the name change. The link I put in the Whats your source box has forms you will need.|`|D8x0w6FMaa	Depends where you live it can be anywhere from $100-500. Just go to the courthouse after the rights are signed over and inquire about it. You don't need a lawyer you just fill out the change of name forms and submit them then you will have to pay court fees and have a court date where it is officially changed.

Looking for something "new" other than his typical toys?    Try painting.    A good book to get is the "Ultimate Kid's Concoctions" it has lots of great stuff made out of things around the house: like body paint for the bath, edible clay (made out of powdered sugar), slime, silly putty, etc... It's good for the tactile kid.    Singing songs and making up silly dances for the songs, or teach him the moves for "Itsy Bitsy Spider"     Tell him stories and act them out..."A bear goes up a tree...climb climb climb" and make the motions of climbing...have him mimic you. "We got to swim to get away from the bear" and swim..." We have to run from the bear" and run in place, etc...    Hide a toy and have him find it.|`|ofCRTXw9aa	- Coloring  - Movie night (Let him pick movie & let him help you make popcorn)  - Crafts (if you are ok with getting it all set up, and cleaned up)  - Just play a little game with him, ask him what he wants to play & do it! :]|`|23MPcnNqaa	Stickers, coloring book, drawing, tic tac toe  You can play I-Spy  (i spy with my eye, something ^color of something in room^ and the other person has to guess)  a kid's movie    Good luck and have fun!!|`|esMo9Z4Eaa	make a fort and eat pop corn and color in it then take a nap  and maybe make cookies
M5E3mDBJaa	I used a conception date calculator with the hypothetical due date of July 7th, 2009.  This is what it came up with based on a 28 day cycle.    First Day of Last Menstrual Period:September 30, 2008    Probable Date of Ovulation: October 14, 2008    Possible Dates of Conception: October 10 to October 18, 2008    Due Date: July 7, 2009 (40 weeks)|`|4U9y2pLBaa	You would want to try around the middle of october for the baby to be born in the first 2 weeks of july.|`|HcxaErXkaa	late october or november!|`|w4zjmhxoaa	My son was due 7/7, he was born on July 1 and was conceived in mid october|`|gGW7K9U5aa	I conceived my baby September 15th, and her due date was June 21st.   So if you wanted your baby to be born the beginning of July or the end of June, then youd want to conceive the baby anywhere from the end of September to the beginning of October.   A good website that you can put the date of your last period to see when your most fertile is parents.com  They also have babymaking forums so you can talk to other that are trying to conceive as well.|`|0qGBq4Nxaa	the end of october to the first week in november would put u close to a july baby|`|jgDlkSiWaa	My LMP was early Oct and I was due July 14th (had her on the 5th.

Wednesday 7th October 2009 - First day of your cycle  Sunday 18th October 2009 - A little bit fertile  Monday 19th October 2009 - Fertile  Tuesday 20th October 2009 - VERY fertile  Wednesday 21st October 2009 - Time to ovulate  Saturday 31st October 2009 - A home pregnancy test may work now.  Tuesday 3rd November 2009 - End of cycle  Friday 6th November 2009 - No period? Maybe you're pregnant!

ETL9hDIBaa	As the others have stated, it varies from person to person.  You have no real reason to worry at this point though.  I'm sure you are aware of the statistic that states it could take up to a year after bc of most kinds to be completely out of your system to become pregnant.  My husband and I have been ttc for over a year now without any luck.  My doctor is requesting that I go back on bc for a little while to regulate my cycle and I am super bummed about that.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck with ttc and baby dust to you.|`|822da6b7b24693d516953606bfb56517aa	its different for every person<br>  if i were you, i would talk to your doc|`|ylg9ejceaa	Every body is different. I was on the DEPO shot for 3 years and decided to switch to the pill. I was told it generally takes 12 months for the DEPO to really wear off and pregnancy to occur. I was given a year supply of pills and they told me to start the new packs after my first period. Needless to say.. my period never came and I got preg the first month after my shot was due. With my second son I only missed 2 pills and got pregnant. It varies per person though. I think as soon as you are off you have a chance of becoming preg.|`|uzscewygaa	well, I don't know. But I was on another pill for about 3 yrs, and I've been off of it like 5 months already,and still nothing. But I read a lot of articles about it, and they all say that up to a year for young woman ( under 35) is normal. It really depends on the person. You know some girls just need to have sex to get pregnant.<br>  good luck|`|oiJITSNZaa	It varies from person to person. There is no right answer. It has happened anywhere from the month after to 3+ years. It depends on the person and how their system is set up!

A couple years of up all night and a few thousand diapers later  that mistake he thought he made covers up the refrigerator  oh yeah..........he loves that little girl.  Momma's waiting to tuck her in  as she stumbles up those stairs  she smiles back at him dragging that teddy bear  sleep tight, blue eyes and bouncing curls  He smiles  there goes my life  there goes my future my everything  i love you, daddy goodnight  there goes my life  She had that honda loaded down  with abercrombie clothes and 15 pairs of shoes and his american express  he checked the oil and slammed the hood, said your good to go  she hugged the both and headed off to the west coast  He cried  there goes my life  there goes my future, my everything  i love you  baby good-bye  There goes my life...............  there goes my life.....................  baby good-bye      Theres also - i loved her first by heartland. that one makes me cry|`|dPULl5hjaa	Butterfly Kisses - Bob Carlisle    There's two things I know for sure:  She was sent here from heaven and she's  daddy's little girl.  As I drop to my knees by her bed at night  She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes and  I thank god for all the joy in my life  Oh, but most of all  For butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer;  sticking little white flowers all up in her  hair; "Walk beside the pony, Daddy, it's my first ride."  "I know the cake looks funny, Daddy, but I sure tried."  In all that I've done wrong I know I must  have done something right to deserve a hug  every morning and butterfly kisses at night.    Sweet 16 today  She's looking like her mama a little more everyday  One part woman, the other part girl.  To perfume and make-up from ribbons and curls  Trying her wings out in a great big world.    But I remember  Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer; sticking  little white flowers all up in her hair.  "You know how much I love you, Daddy, But if you  don't mind I'm only gonna kiss you on the cheek this time."  With all that I've done wrong I must have done  something right to deserve her love every morning  and butterfly kisses at night.    All the precious time  Like the wind, the years go by.  Precious butterfly.  Spread your wings and fly.    She'll change her name today.  She'll make a promise and I'll give her away.  Standing in the bride-room just staring at her.  She asked me what I'm thinking and I said "I'm not  sure-I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl."  She leaned over...gave me butterfly kisses with her mama there,  Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair  "Walk my down the aisle, Daddy-it's just about time."  "Does my wedding gown look pretty, Daddy? Daddy, don't cry!"    Oh, with all that I've done wrong I must have  done something right.  To deserve your love every morning and butterfly  kisses-I couldn't ask God for more, man this is what love is.    I know I gotta let her go, but I'll always remember  every hug in the morning and butterfly kisses.|`|rA4F2J6Iaa	there's a nice Kenney Chesney song...

Alabama I Love You Enough To Let You Go lyrics   I've rehearsed this day a thousand times   I've played this scene out in my mind   You spread your wings, you need to fly   It breaks my heart to say goodbye   These arms of mine wanna pull you close   But I love you enough to let you go   My mind goes back to memories   Of pony rides upon my knee   First day of school, your brand new bike   And football games on Friday nights   And through the years I've watched you grow   And I love you enough to let you go   Don't look back when you drive away   I don't wanna change your mind   I know in all your eighteen years   You've never seen your daddy cry   So many things I wanna say   You'll meet new friends, you'll be okay   I'll pray for you out on your own   But don't forget your way back home   And though I may not let it show   I love you enough to let you go   Don't look back when you drive away   I don't wanna change your mind   I know in all your eighteen years   You've never seen your daddy cry   These arms of mine wanna pull you close   But I love you enough to let you go|`|hIhg7Oh7aa	Tim mcgraw my little girl|`|cz9dogpvaa	butterfly kisses
AA11763588	Yes it's normal. Your uterus and ligaments have to stretch to make room for the baby, this will happen though out your entire pregnancy. Drink plenty of water!|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	very common to have cramps and/or spotting. if it lasts more than 24 hours, call your doctor.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Normal, I had it too in early pregnancy, some women have it through most of their pregnancy.

Baby had one around wrist and ankle and a sticker on their back., and they wrote on one of their feet too. Very hard to loose them these days!|`|PymLdXM8aa	I agree with the first answer. As soon as the baby is born the put there bands on with their name and number so its highly unlikely. Although i am sure back in the day it probably happened alot! Personally i only get to see my daughter for about 30 seconds after my c section and there would be no way in hell someone could have handed me the wrong baby because i would have noticed in a heartbeat.|`|i8NOVfm0aa	the hospital i went to they had a scanner on her bassinet that they rolled her around in and a bracelet on her ankle and my husband and i each had one so for the hospital i went to i would say never! lol good question!|`|WlU3NFu6aa	not anymore. I has happened in the past but now days they bracelet the babies and parents and make sure they match. our hospital checked each time they brought her to us and when we left|`|aJLx0nhNaa	At the hospital where I delivered every baby had two wristbands attached with their mother's name and a number.  Me and my husband each had a wristband with the same name and number.  Each time the baby was taken from us, or returned to us, we had to read the number off our wrist band to the nurse and she read his to us and then showed it to us.    I really don't think it happens very often.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I knew an OB nurse in the hospital where I used to work that accidentally did this. Probably a long time ago, before tags and security measures and all that. She said she handed the baby to the mother to nurse, and the mom looked at the child and said, "This isn't my baby."     Since it has happened before, and really not that long ago, that they do a lot of things to ensure it doesn't happen, like don't have too many babies in one area as they're prepping them, etc. At our hospital they have tags and the nurse must read aloud the number to you each time, regardless of whether she knows it's your baby or not, and you have to read it back to her.|`|bfjs9wSLaa	FACT: happens to 22 newborns a day    analyze that however you want :)|`|EHY3FnAmaa	It may have happened in the past but now the babies wear matching bracelets to both of there parents.  And also the baby stays in your room|`|mx3gFmIKaa	My kids went to NICU and I worried about this.  I marked them myself with a permanent market in an inconspicuous spot.  IDK.  My thing is bracelets come off all the time.  I think it happens.
RPszYGXkaa	Sounds like you are expecting.  First Response is one of the most sensitive tests, and to have two positives....I would call the Dr so you can get your bloodwork done and your 1st appt!!    Best wishes and congrats!  A line is a line!!!|`|vKEYa8aeaa	a line is a line, you are pregnant. take another test if you are skeptical =]|`|RrPjG9x9aa	a faint line is still a line!  if you need to confirm, take another tomorrow with your first morning urine (when the hormone concentration is higher).  Congrats!|`|lCwjDDcoaa	you can do what i did and take 3 tests haha but then i went to the Dr to confirm. They did a pee test it said no, but my 3 said yes. So i asked them to do a blood test. and Then 9 months later, I had my little girl!!|`|AA10629038	My second line was so faint you could barly see it but it was a positive. A line is a line faint or dark.|`|1WRB7RPNaa	i had the same thing and i was barley past 3 weeks :)|`|bPZGSd8Raa	Its best to test about a week after your missed period and in the morning. So try again like on friday or saturday. The tests are about 98% correct most of the time.|`|ywXXwhgdaa	tests are 99% accurate, even though the second line is faint it is very posible you are pregnant. you should go to the doctor and get a blood test.
PLgNsOF9aa	You ovulate a couple weeks before you have your period so you had already ovulated and it just takes about 12-36 hours for the egg to get thru you so it was already gone. I think it was just your period.|`|0NRAdYTsaa	You can have your full blown "regular" period for up to 5 months of pregnancy. It sounds like my periods do, but mine are irregular and they tend to do that sometimes. It depends on amount of activity and diet. It's normal for being "not normal". Also, activity levels and diet can move your period around a little bit. Especially certain kinds of activity........|`|3oJL2Go3aa	I never had implantation bleeding. I do know that my period before I started skipping was really weird. I went heavy at the beginning like normal and then it slowed down the next day which was normal.. Then I started spotting. I have had my period since I was 11 and I have never spotted. My period also lasted for 8 days. My periods usually last for 3 to 5 days. It could be your body cleansing itself for when the baby gets in there. All you really can do is wait until your next period to see if you are or not. That is what I had to do. But I absolutely had no idea that I was pregnant. Me and my husband used protection and there was one time that the condom slipped but that had happened before and I didnt think anything of it. I was also living in a new state and I thought it was the stress of moving to a new place.|`|kZL1FSanaa	i think its bleeding
VdnAH78Xaa	Hey i was induced with my baby girl 4 months ago with pitocin. i basically went in at 5am they hooked me up to the contraction machine and the baby heart beat monitor. then gave me the pitocin. doctor broke my water at 10am. i could move around and go to the bathroom. FINALLY around like 3 the contractions got a little painful so i got an epidural. after that i was slept and woke up at 640 had my girl at 654! <br>  i tried all that and this food Eggplant Parmesean(delicious) but it didnt work lol<br>   good luck!|`|ob7jTC5Caa	I was induced with my son almost 6 years ago.<br>  You're able to get up and use the bathroom on your own, but they keep you connected to all the monitors and IV's so they won't let you walk through your contractions at all. You can stand and sway, but I had to fight to make them let me do that!<br>  I will say that I have never gone into labor naturally, but the contractions were extremely intense and were ever 30 seconds to a minute with no break in between. They just kept coming. It wasn't the most pleasant experience, not that child birth is supposed to be, but I didn't like the pitocin.  I was trying to stay away from it with this pregnancy, but I'm already almost a week over due so they're inducing me tomorrow!  This time around I'm already dilated past 3 and 70 % effaced so I'm hoping it goes a little more smooth.<br>  I tried everything.<br>  Sex<br>  Acupressure<br>  pineapple<br>  walking miles and miles<br>  spicy food<br>  nipple stimulation<br>  castor oil (my doctor recommended trying it)<br>  <br>  Nothing put me into labor.
olKKT2LTaa	I tried all the natural ways to enduce labour and none worked for me. I was induced at 40+10 and had 2 pessaries and the oxcytocin drip. If you are already 2cm then chances are you will only need 1-2 pessaries to get things started and it shouldn't make the contractions any worse. They might just begin quicker and get stronger faster. I had 2 pessaries (inserted into vagina a bit like a smear, uncomfortable but not particularly painful) but my cervix wasn't having any of it. My waters were broken at 2-3cm and I was put on the drip. The drip is quite intense and makes the contractions come on quickly and regularly. If you've been through labour before, then you know what to expect...it's just a lot quicker than a natural labour. I hope this is not too scary. I'm trying to be honest. Try not to worry as it's just a way to get the labour going and isn't as bad as we're led to believe. I was actually shocked at how many other women were being induced at the same time. And everyone reacts differently. I was very slow and had mild contractions for two days before the drip. Another woman had her baby after 1 pessary and about 3 hours! Good luck.
vDlaRuJ0aa	Um you gonna tell your guardian rite? they'll be able to help, or try a diffrent brand for the test. Idk you mite be, or your just really stressed, that some times stops the period from coming. idk whadda think?
FmgAfeWuaa	all boys act immature trust me  and thats why girls should always believe  a boy when they say they love you    i had tech with all these boys and i was the only  girl in it since it was a woodcutting class  and all the boys talked about was masturbating  and sex and dirty things    some sat next to me and said it was wrong  but most of the boys sat at the other table  to talk about disgusting things|`|vNi14C7uaa	Because most of them are. I deal with the same problem everyday. Today has been my 2nd day in a row or getting in trouble for kicking them, but when they aggravate you, you have to show them whose boss.|`|ameJkDgpaa	Well because it is a fact that boys are younger than girls mentally.|`|BslieR3daa	boys will be boys  most of them just think about girls and sex  they always use us.........and play us out like fools  and some girl acts stupid and fight over them when they dont care about them  we jus gotta live with it|`|8PchhhIIaa	well some of what they say is not true but some say that they have done it and well i kind of believe them but i think they are immature cuz they are just dreaming and a re immature for example their age counts like dogs ages every seven yeard they are just one year old|`|T9mMMIYAaa	Well because there pestrion and hormone levels are high.  And there not reciving anything so they have too talk as if they did and most of the time if someone else has done something they talk about it alot because they wish it was them! : )|`|aOCfLAJJaa	I don't say ANY of that, and I'm 13. I've NEVER done ANY of that either.    Edit: My "friends (or assholes)" do that though, and it doesn't look or sound in the slightest way cool.|`|tt6SzpTFaa	They just haven't grown out of it yet.   They think it's funny.    I'm right there with ya sista. 8th grade guys are pretty perverted sometimes..but then again, sometimes it really is funny.    "Is that Windex on your pants? Cause I can see myself in them."|`|14pjwQPLaa	Because they ARE immature.  All talk, very little action -- lots of dreaming out loud!|`|fQxSClHKaa	9 times out of 10 they're saying it to sound cool around their friends.  and they act immature because they are immature. they're 13.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Because they are simply boys still. Girls tend to mature faster. I am sure most 13yr old boys are just trying to be "cool" by talking about sex and what not. Dont pay them any mind.|`|NhBi8q80aa	They do it at 15 and 43 as well.    Get used to it hunny.
3cea97f9abc80ff593bdb3828a3f1adfaa	They say first morning urine is best, but also consider the test you are using. It depends on the brand but what you really need to look for is its sensitivity level or mIU/hCG, so check the box. The lower the number the more sensitive it is. So if it says 20 mIU/hCG is very sensitive, so it is more likely to be accurate, if it's like 50-100, not as accurate. So 20 is the lowest/best. The ones I used from the dollar store worked fine called New Choice at 25 mIU.    Check out this comparison chart to see how sensitive your test is (or you can check on the box for the mlU/hCG):  http://www.babyhopes.com/pages.php?pagei...    Good luck!!!|`|lTkYWiy5aa	If it's been 3-4 weeks since conception it should not matter what time of day you test.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Yes it is possible, first morning urine has higher levels of HCG so if you arent far along then it could make a difference.|`|AA11612508	yes wait until the first pee of the morning. that contains the most amount of the hormone  so just check again tomorrow morning.|`|AAbGMKo5aa	Naa thats not true with my 1st pregnancy I got a bfp at 6:00 pm :/|`|PLgNsOF9aa	You do not need to wait until your morning pee if you just do not drink very much at all for about 4 hours and hold ur peeing and let it build up the hormone strength in ur urine. Then it will be the same thing as morning pee.  It can be negative if u take it during the day and your urine is diluted by 4 glasses of tea or pop or something. Check the sensitivity of ur test. the best are 20 sensitive to the hormone.|`|6eIBIOwoaa	You should pee in the morning, but it should be positive regardless.
dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	Make sure she has a hat and socks on. If she has a body suit that would be better than just a jacket. Keep her close to you or other family members. Avoid being near windows or any place there could be a drafts. Snuggle up in blankets together.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	How about a blanket?  Keep her close to your skin as well.|`|HuhqPNTzaa	there is this thing called fire...|`|AA10405438	Use layers and keep her between you and your partner to sleep.|`|MKRemZkuaa	i would have to say go into the middle of the house and block and way for cold air to get in. like windows and bottoms of doors. if you are both in there the room will be warmer. if there is a room without windows that would be ideal. then just cover up. your bodies together would provide enough heat to stay warm.|`|gmaCvh00aa	Bundle up and keep her close to you for body heat.    I know it's an inconvience, and I did read that people across the country are having power problems tonight.    Just remember, until 100 years ago our ancestors had no fancy central heating, and they survived.|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	Bring her to australia its 44 degrees celcuis here! (115 ferenheit) lol then she wont be cold!!    Failing that dress her in layers and lots of blankets!! Put her in bed with you, give her warm milk. She will be fine|`|YvNOfM2xaa	Get a ton of blankets and pillows!   Give her nice warm PJs and socks that are thick. Read to her for a little.   Sing lulubyes.   Soon she'll be fast asleep!  Also you can sleep in her bed with her for her body heat.  Have her wear her gloves and mittens if it's really cold!|`|KbUJQQlmaa	Use your body heat......hug her and get a blanket if you can
SJ9lOnCOaa	I'm not overdue, but I feel like I am (baby's birth weight is expected to be 9.5-10lbs) <br>  <br>  I'm SO miserable. I can't wait to see my toes again!!!<br>  <br>  I'm so incredibly swollen, my back aches and my feet hurt. I live on the toilet feeling like I'm going to pee a gallon but peeing only a minimal amount. I have horrible heartburn and nausea all day long! Stretch marks JUST started showing up, I thought I was in the clear but nope.... they aren't noticeable unless you look up close, but damn those magnifying mirrors...they're there, GGRRR!! My moodiness is at an all time high these last few weeks, I'm like a roller coaster!! <br>  <br>  relief is finally insight for me though..luckily..

LDiBjNf5aa	What were five times within the last week? Sounds like it could be a crucial detail to your question.<br>  <br>  Edit: Okay, if its been within the last week, then it is definitely too early to tell. Wait until your period is late. Or, even better, wait until you've completely missed it. That way, a pregnancy test is far more likely to be accurate, especially if you use it with your first pee of the day.<br>  <br>  I think what the doctor was saying was that the cause of your missed period this past month was not due to pregnancy, as you tested negative.|`|w1jyHMRbaa	Your hCG levels aren't high enough...you prob wouldn't even really be pregnant yet (the fetus hasn't implanted into the uterus its prob still on the way to the uterus) give it a few more weeks then test again. Good Luck!!|`|JBenOf9Daa	can still be possible blood test is a definite way to find out.  you are missing cycle how about haveing them and be pregnant
tjGFRs1Kaa	I like Seth Daniel and Savannah Lynn|`|a2DW1Bqgaa	Seth Daniel- Franklin reminds me of that turtle or the old guy Benji  Savannah Lynn is beautiful, it flows better and I love the name Lynn- opens up nickname territory|`|kwMA5I1iaa	Any of those combos are great! I love 'em!|`|AeukK3Inaa	Seth Daniel and Savannah Lynn are great!|`|lsYRmKvZaa	Seth Franklin seems more unique.  I don't know a lot of kids who have Franklin in their name  + it's cute!    & I like Savannah Paiton .. once again it's unique.  + I love the name Paiton.    :D|`|HovbbVEsaa	Seth Daniel    I don't like the name Savannah...how about Alicia, Gabriella, Isabella, Alexandra, Christina or something?|`|yZwQKPJ4aa	pooooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmpoooooooooopo...|`|MlxxdRH8aa	for a girl i like Evangeline..and call her eva. a boy Toby|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I like Savannah Lynn.     Not a big fan of Seth, but that could be because I went to school with a really smelly mean kid named Seth.
AA11763588	5 days after you miss your period will give you the most accurate results because you are letting the hormones build up in your system.|`|AA10405438	Get a test in a weeka and you will know.|`|eemmWU0Haa	Now or even better take a pee in the morning and then test just to be sure..Good Luck|`|yqQBcjDmaa	It should be accurate in the morning, as you will then be 2 days late.|`|JsshzKM9aa	Now! :)|`|j9ta5ulqaa	Take one as soon as you get one. You can use the first morning urine but it shouldn't matter. Good Luck!
bTlhBX3daa	I have no idea if it really induces labor. I can say that at 18 weeks it is totally safe to do, however, your boyfriend could possibly get a mouthful of Colostrum. Many women start excreting Colostrum early in their pregnancy. I started leaking at about 18 weeks. It is not all the time, and USUALLY just a couple drops.|`|AHHAGxlCaa	he may get a mouthful of milk if he keeps doing it lol,<br>  <br>  but I don't think its unsafe|`|nfLyS1toaa	tell him to stop while your pregnant, it can make you have preterm labor.|`|pDGVTLoFaa	No not at all in fact it is a very good idea to have your breasts stimulated if you are thinking of breast feeding. x|`|m0DgqEcjaa	No, its ok to do!<br>  <br>  He will just get a taste of colostrum
zmlUjx5Taa	Its a gorgeous name, and its a very creative spelling.<br>  Did you no that mattison means in Hawaiian "wonderful."<br>  Your daughter will certaintly be a creative, orginal individual like her mother!<br>  Some nicknames you could have are (a relative of mine has the name madison.):<br>  - maddie<br>  - mads<br>  - mattie<br>  etc.!|`|5616c80b8725434c1b3b133e190c4284aa	I like it...got for it|`|XaemCMTpaa	I like it a lot.Really pretty.|`|GZn5VNlSaa	Too forced! Gosh just use the traditional spelling!|`|W0nd3qF3aa	cute!
1ezYfkX7aa	What a nice way to get attention.....@@|`|t9Nw86Plaa	No, it's probably nothing serious. Your gyno will help you work out what it is, and treat it if necessary, but at your age it's probably just normal menstrual irregularities. Your period will become more regular as you get older. If it doesn't, go back to your gyno and she may prescribe the pill (which is how a lot of women control their periods) or something else.|`|z4glZ2lbaa	That's strange just go to a doctor you never know what you have :/|`|VQCsOpIbaa	Call your ob/gyn and ask them if you need to move the appointment up. I think this is a common thing and not something to be overly concerned about, but I am not a doctor. Best wishes.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	Well the attention grabber got me in here. But I thought you were a troll and I was going to point that out. Ever since I have become a mother it feels like I am a protector among all children. There are things on tv I can watch because it makes me sick to my stomach or cry.. But I didnt like the attention grabber it is sick! As far as your question yes I have had that before. It could be a hormone imbalance. I wouldnt worry about moving your doctors appointment. I would just wait until the 11th. Good Luck!|`|AA10405438	Attention grabber???????
arlh28JTaa	My cycle is normally very light for 1-2 days then heavier flow and it almost stops for a day before starting back up for the last few days. I thought that I started my period, so I didn't think much of until it was the end of the week and I was left wondering when my normal period was gonna happen. Then after sore breasts, fatigue and strange smell/taste aversions I thought that I could've been pregnant?<br>  <br>  Sure enough, I took a test and a faint double line showed up. I took it again a few days later and the line was darker. What I thought was the start of my period was actually implantation bleeding. <br>  <br>  I would recommend taking a test to be sure.|`|3996c86c61103007ffe22b481f70f0bcaa	A short period is nothing to worry about, but you need to understand that it is very common for women to experience vaginal bleeding that they MISTAKE for a period.  You should take a pregnancy test, because it is possible that you did not have a period at all.
AA11763588	You could be, sounds like some symptoms are there. Take the test first thing in the morning with your first morning pee.    It doesn't really matter how much you paid for the test, they all are made pretty much the same.|`|eemmWU0Haa	So am I...Having alot of clear discharge but Im not late in my period Im due to start my period on the 2nd and I started having very lite cramps! & one speck of Brown only once when I wiped today!
FkGh0LuWaa	I had the same problem with my son.  I told him that when he would go number two we would change the water colors,  After he went I would let him flush then I would put a few drops of food coloring in and then leave it in the bowl until he was ready to go again.  It worked very well.|`|AA11210211	The only thing I can say is wait until he is ready,don't get stressed out and yell or anything that will only make him not want to,be patient he will do it on his own time:)I never thought my son would be ready but he has been going on the potty for about a week and a half now and he is 3 1/2|`|gJrHBtp1aa	He's probably not ready. If you push it he will resist even more. He'll let you know when he's ready. My daughter refused to go until she was 3.5. Once she was ready we made a game out of going to the potty, we set the microwave timer for 20 mins, every time it went off we sang and danced our way to the potty. She loved it.|`|KAwHCSW4aa	Tell him for every time he goes pee on the potty, he gets an M&M or a hershey kiss. if he goes poop, give him 2.
ODMCAcPDaa	Stellanna, Stellannah  Stellane  Stellaney, Stellani  Estella      I hope that helps!|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	I know a little girl who's almost seven and her name is just Stella.  Why not use that?|`|LdoCKo4Qaa	Combine the two and name her Estella.|`|aS8TjALBaa	Estelle "Stella" Grace|`|AT6PbAQ2aa	How come I'm the only guy answering this question? Am I gay? Kidding, Kidding. Anyway, how about you ditch the name stella, and or stelle, and go with something completely new and 21st century, like Cyan Moon, or Magenta Skye, or Flip those Magenta Moon, or Cyan Skye. In photography Cyan is one of the primary colors it is the color blue, and magenta is like a red, so when you say Cyan Moon, it's like saying "blue moon", the name Magenta Sky is "Red Sky"       So what do you think? Come on you, you can do it. Do it! Do it! Do it!|`|7adzqyGgaa	STELLA!!!! ESTELLE SOUNDS LIKE A GRANDMA LOL|`|75HzIpSraa	I like just Stella too|`|1881f384f0ce54be24309e52cd72d1beaa	I think Stella is more modern than Estelle.

I see a little girl with it, not an old lady. However, there's also Estelline.|`|qXq0nmBzaa	Stella means "star" as does Estelle.    Danica is Slavic for "morning star"  Astra is star in Greek  Ayelet is the Hebrew term for the morning star (gazelle of dawn)  Dara means "star" in Khmer  Hokulani means "star of heaven" in Hawaiian  Lyra is a constellation  Seren is Welsh for star  Sitara is Hindi for star  Tara is Sanskrit for star  Twyla (possibly a Cajun pronunciation of French toile "star")  Vega is a star in the Lyra constellation    You have lots of pretty names to choose from!

1m3iQnWJaa	WebMd.com says May 26th was her date of conception :)|`|u1uECuFNaa	May 2008.   But...Who really knows?  is the doctor right?  On a given month, I have sex more than 8 times. (if nothing interferes.) I barely recall my last cycle.   How could I help with someone else's?  Doctor's guess off the LMP. And then on the size of the baby during an ultrasound.|`|JsshzKM9aa	Yep, sometime in may!|`|3klIx1Egaa	around may 19th|`|eemmWU0Haa	when was her last period...she doesn't know when she got pregnant?...damn people wake up and use protection or something!|`|5OsSGCdAaa	go to babycenter.com  go to the due date calculator and it will give u the dates that she could of got pregnant..|`|20B91lm3aa	about may 29th was the 1st week.|`|ei6dMFYGaa	a week or so after mothers day!|`|AsICkz9naa	It would have been in may of last year, about the second week
E0gm0mRBaa	my 8 week old did that the other day but i think it was the fact she was drinking and straining for a poo at the same time.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	ither she is eating to much or has reflux   talk to ur doc about reflux   50% of all babies have it   my son does and this is what the DOCTOR told me to do     sit up rite after feeds for 20 min   burp well and often   sleep on an incline   dont move aroud to m uch after eating   make sure she dosent get to worked up   and thicken bottle with cereal    but talk to ur ped. 1st|`|QOvUS6xVaa	heck no and it must be very painful for her since its painful for us.   prop her up while you feed her until she sees her dr|`|jn34aSgHaa	no that means that you might be feeding her to much but you need to see a doctor because she could have some sort of deviation in her septum. good luck|`|3klIx1Egaa	ive never heard of it.. are you sure its just not mucus still cleaning from her air passages after birth?|`|AwvWBROlaa	it is not normal. seems like you night be feeding her more than she needs. try feeding her less in sitting position. dont feed her laying down if you are|`|x4PIT0fRaa	it depends most of the time its just cuz she ether needs to be burped or when you feed her prop her up so it does not happen again. but you might want to ask the baby's physician or children's doctor someone with experience|`|30C0oZl8aa	it happens at times nothing to worry about unless it becomes a chronic problem.  Try holding baby more upright when u feed her, this should help.
4CMQuJgOaa	Like you said he is so young this party is for your family to celebrate he will not remember it, do something at home pizza and cake. Make sure to get a "smash" cake or cupcake for him to play in...    take lots of pictures!!|`|0qP8gLpyaa	I followed the motto of keep it simple.  For my son's first last year we had a railroad party.  The cake was a train and we did burgers on the grill and just set out trays of different condiments and toppings, some fruit salad, a pasta salad and some chips with a couple coolers of drinks.    The whole party included just the grandparents and very close family. Inluding ourselves there were 12 people.   We kept the party 2 hours and had everyone write in his birthday book for his first birthday and we did cake/icecream.  The little ones that were there just ran and played in the yard since it was a pretty day and warm.  He opened his presents and helped say bye bye with a wave and handing each person a favor (a wooden train engine with his name and first birthday on them, balloons for the kids and also a bandana, rail hat and whistle for the kids).  Everyone had fun and it was simple and enjoyable with minimal mess and hassle.      This year he'll be 2 and we're inviting his playgroup and family so there will be considerably more people there.  We're having a firetruck theme this year at my little guys request.  Hopefully the weather will cooperate so that the kids can be outside again to play.|`|HyknHVV5aa	Because he is so young like you said, the best thing to do is just to have other kids their like cousins, have him the center of the room to open all his presents and have all the adults be super cheesy when he opens the gifts "OH WOW!!! HOW FUN!!!! LOOK AT THAT!!!! YAYYYYY!!!", then put the baby in their highchair, everyone sing, and give him a cake (take off his shirt and pants, just in a diaper - a tip from experience) and let the baby go nuts with the cake, slapping it, mushing it everywhere, eating it, etc. Then just let all the little kids play with the toys. That's probably the best you can do for such a young age!
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    If your vagina is sore and you had a little blood, it maybe that you vagina is a little bit inflamed.  A cut will take a few days to heal, maybe a bit longer as its very moist up there.  Try taking it easy and give it time to heal, you don't want to irritate it more than it is, cause it can become very sore, and if its a cut you won't want it to become infected.    Best of luck xxx|`|04bc2c48d79f30c010ba500a390cb62daa	Are u sure which hole has the discharge?  LOL.. U typed fingered. lol
HclKftzAaa	if they actually succeed in killing themselves, unless there is a medical team really really close, the baby has no chance.    There was a story recently of a woman who was legally dead, but her body was being kept alive by machines, and they gave her steroids and removed the baby from her at 27 (?) weeks. So, she gave birth when she was dead, but that's a little different.    If you were about 30 weeks along, and the ambos got there in time, they might be able to perform a c/s and revive the baby. you never know.|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Ummm I think you answered your own STUPID question. Do you think if you were 21 weeks & died would your baby survive....|`|cj7sSPZEaa	A baby can not survive at 21 weeks.  A baby is not viable until 23 weeks or more into the pregnancy, so yes- if the mother dies at 21 weeks gestation, the baby would die as well.|`|AA10405438	When you die the baby will die.  You are it's life line and without you there is no baby.  Please think long and hard about this.|`|BUI9HnH1aa	more then likely yes  if the mother was further along in the pregnancy and they may be a chance to save the baby . But some one would have to be doing cpr to the mother so the baby is still getting oxygen.   The was something on the news the other week how a baby girl was born 2 days after her mother had died , the mother was brain dead but on life support|`|jNgh3e3Faa	TO? You mean from..  Anyway, if you die the baby dies within a couple of minutes depending on how you die and how far along the pregnancy is.  Don't you watch television?    If you are thinking of doing something, please talk to someone.   It does not relate to you??  I never asked this question and I am depressed...|`|g5JeSJbNaa	is this a sick joke of course the baby will die it has nowhere to get food or oxygen from|`|eemmWU0Haa	well congratulations to you & the @$$-hole!  Well technically when you die everything in you dies!|`|20B91lm3aa	you die = baby die|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Usually.  It's possible for the baby to be removed from the womb and still be found if the mother is found quickly but at 21 weeks there's like hardly any chance of survival|`|ei6dMFYGaa	baby dies w/ mother!
nzGdMWbZaa	See you Dr. and talk to your mom.|`|AA10405438	Yep, you could be pregnant.  See a doctor to know for sure.|`|JsshzKM9aa	Yeah you very well could be. Go to the doctor, blood tests are more accurate anyways.     :)|`|5OsSGCdAaa	yea ... u need to  go to a doctor...it sounds like ur pregnant..|`|GObmVQk3aa	Yes, you can be, so I'd go see a Doctor.|`|2RInFX4Qaa	Ok, I'm 18 been through this situation before too. Take a pregnancy test if it comes out negative then go to a clinic. You're lucky since you are 17 and might be able to go to a free clinic or talk to your school nurse about it, trust me people will help you.|`|XAuor0S8aa	oh man.  ask your mom.|`|20B91lm3aa	yeah you can. thats how i was born.  you should go to a clinic to make sure.|`|0BXNl2MZaa	Get an abortion.|`|GoFEvz2laa	There are many things that can affect the onset of your period. Stress is one of them. Hormonal changes, health conditions, and even the presence of other menstruating women can affect the timing of your period. Also, you can skip a month or be irregular.    Pregnancy tests rely upon the presence of substances your body makes only when you are pregnant. If you are pregnant, these substances are excreted in the urine. When you are first pregnant, your body makes less of these substances. More is produced as the pregnancy continues.    The tests are designed to be sensitive to exquisitely small concentrations of these substances. Still, even if you use the test correctly, there is a small chance of a pregnancy not being detected. This is called a "false negative." In the US, the Food & Drug Administration regulates the makers of these types of tests, so the brand should not matter as long as the expiration date has not passed and the package has been stored according to the manufacturer's recommendations.    You may wish to test your urine again after waiting a few days. If it is still negative and your period has not started, you may want to visit your doctor, especially if your period has been quite regular in the past. In any case, if you are pregnant or suspect you are pregnant, please visit a doctor to get good pre-natal care.|`|l7FOtgbkaa	i would go to the doctor because i know someone that went five months before she found out she was pregnant and she spent a lot of money on tests that came up negative.|`|QRaRbstAaa	I am having the same problems as you right now, the best thing i can tell you to do is not to be  afraid to tell your mom, because moms are there for you in times of need and no matter what you need help on and for example this, she may be a little upset with you but your mom will always love you and be there for and help you out in any way that you need help, and besides who knows she could be mad at you for nothing.

K5AeQuSNaa	Not pregnant.  And missed/irregular periods are not uncommon.  If you had your period, and have not had sex since then, you can't be pregnant.|`|UXoTCL98aa	sorry kinda confusing are you wondering if you can still be pregnant from the 17th of Dec. when u had unprotected sex. If so no ur not pregnant. If you had a regular period on the 22nd and it lasted that long and had neg. preg test then no.  If you got ur reg. period then theres no way still can be.   did u have unprotected sex since then and are wondering where ur period is now? if so u may be it might be too early to tell if you are. BUT this is only if you have had unprotected sex again since after you period on the 22nd. The lotiony discharge might be bc ur ovulating and ur period is on its way soon.     Dont freak out stress can make ur period come late. There is NO way ur pregnant from the 17th of Dec. if your period came regulary as u said and u received neg. results.|`|0BXNl2MZaa	Get moar birth control pills.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	If you haven't had sex since the 17th of december and you got your period on the 22nd of december then you're not pregnant.
C55pji5Qaa	Yes,they should be fine.I had felt them constantly from 18 weeks to 20 weeks and then at 21 weeks I did not feel baby B for a few days.I called the doc and she told me to come in.She said this early they are still very small and it is not unusual for them to have days or a few days that you do not feel them.That does not mean they are not moving.When I went it we saw an anterior placenta and she was facing inwards so I could not feel her movements. Even at almost 34 weeks their are times I do not feel them.But during my ultrasounds and NST's it shows that they are moving and I just don't feel them.Try not to worry but it never hurts to call your Doc.|`|v3WJbXMpaa	most likely. there's only so much room in there. they're likely going to get more cramped for space. if you're worried though, id call my doc. thats what they're there for!
b1q6Oyp9aa	i doubt it since you had heavy bleeding.Usually you have slight bleeding to no bleeding at all. but you can never know for sure unless you take a pregnancy test.
EtCRnDJMaa	She is "in the moment" and doesn't want to talk.  It's kind of like if I can't see him, then I don't miss him.  Does he get upset or sad?  I really do understand.  My husband is in Afghanistan & when he calls they don't want to talk to him.  We have 3 girls- Olivia, 8.5,  Kallie is 6.5, and Amelia is 4.  They do miss him & love him so much too.  Right now when he calls he says "tell Amelia I said hi", so I do, and Amelia says " I already know, you keep telling me this".  It is so funny!  Last night we did this and she took my arm and said "my mommy"  so, i guess in her own way she's talking to him.  I also think that my older girls don't talk because they really do miss him and they are scared to talk.  So they avoid it all together.  He's been gone for almost 4 years now.      When they were your daughter age I couldn't get the phone away from them.  Sometimes when he would call I would let them have the phone so they could listen & he could listen to them babble.....she would end up hanging up on him.  oops!  there goes that phone call.      I also showed them his picture.  This way they knew who was on the other end!    My husband does understand they love him & miss him, but it's still hard for him.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Can she say dada/daddy, love and you? If so try to teach her to say love you daddy. Or teach her to kiss the phone.|`|W8UZebRWaa	I wouldn't make her miss him at all.  My husband was in Iraq from when my son was 6 months to 19months.  I lied and told him "the baby misses you" to make him feel good. My son really didn't remember him even though I showed pictures, video and webcam.  I would just say "Oh she misses you soooo much, she keeps saying dada dada" etc.  More of a white lie to make him feel good|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	What? She's fourteen months. If he hasn't been in her life and she doesn't know him very well,she won't really be able to miss him. It just doesn't work that way. You can't create feelings.|`|Luf6j8P1aa	well have things slow down so she realizes that daddy is gone, then she might start thinking "daddy isnt here" then she will miss him    jus try not to be so busy|`|OgQOVsxPaa	I don't know why you want to do this? x|`|UFXmnMBhaa	first of all your daughter is still in the stage where the only things she knows is what is in front of her.  She may understand that it is her father on the phone but she is not going to miss him at 14 months.|`|9ydJQr5zaa	There is no reason in making her miss him. Yet I do understand what you are trying to say, but he should just know that she loves him, she is just too busy having fun or doing things that do not let her focus. If he doesn't then try explaining.|`|YEXNq2Yjaa	I have 4 children 4-11. At 14 months, her brain isn't developed in a way to understand or communicate "I miss Daddy". She might at some point ask "Where's Daddy?" depending on how developed her vocabulary is that's about all you can expect from a 14 month old. It's only a weekend, not a month. Why would want to encourage her to miss him? Tell him that you miss him and that you and (daughter's name) can't wait to see him again. If she's not feeling anxious and terribly upset about not seeing dad for one weekend, it means you're doing your job well. You don't want a kid who's a total wreck if she isn't with her parents every second of every day.
yTcQS31Yaa	I too am on clomid and my progesterone was 9.2 which means i ovulated but its still low so my doctor put me on crinone progesterone days 17 until 10 weeks. I will be starting it in 2 days so I am hoping it works. I know my answer didnt answer your question but I will update you in 2 weeks to see if it worked.
vrn1Dhulaa	My mother-in-law had 5 beautiful babies via C-section (I might be a little biased, lol), and had absolutely no complications with any of them. She had her tubes tied after the 5th, only becaseu she wanted to be done have children. I don't know if there truly is a limit?|`|FSPAKELyaa	I have had 2 sections, and am having a third in about 6 weeks. I heard that you can have 5, but i wouldnt go there, 3 is plenty for me.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	There is no limit of how many you can have. . . if you get pregnant you need to deliver one way or another, and they will do the section.    It is not recommended that a woman has more than 3 pregnancies delivered by a c-section and they will strongly urge women to refrain from becoming pregnant again because the risk of placenta accreta / increta / percreta is greater when there is more scar tissue. Accreta is when the placental grows into the uterine lining instead of just attaching to it, increta is when it grows into the deep muscle layers of the uterus, and percreta is when it penetrates through the uterus and can attach and grown on internal organs like your bladder or bowel. This is a huge complication which usually requires a complete hysterectomy at delivery. There is also increased risk for uterine rupture at the scar site, but that risk is not as great as the percreta risks.    Not sure why I received thumbs down on this. . . I am well versed in AWHONN safe practice recommendations and the rationales behind them. Keep in mind those are just recommendations, and again, they will do however many sections they have to.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	I honestly have no idea.  I'm going to go look now.  Very interesting questions!|`|4KXA5oVtaa	I actually had the same question you did a few months ago as I am pregnant with my second child and want four children all together.  (I had a c-section with my first and have a scheduled c-section for my current pregnancy.)  My doctor told me that there really isn't a 'maximum', it really just depends on the mother's health and how well your body handles each surgery.  My sister had 4 c-sections before the doctor told her she probably should have anymore.  If anything, discuss it with your doctor, as I said, everyone is different.  Good luck!|`|ACyrJQHOaa	hi, every doctor is different but in most case's they will let you have 5 c sections depending on if your body has healed from them before well. I had my first c section 11 months ago now and im due to have my second c section on the 17th of april. I would speak to your doctor about this, just to check. I cant have natural births either because my pelvis is to small and it has to be 9.5cms across for a baby to fit through. Good luck and congrats on your children.|`|NI8D46J0aa	My mother in law has had 8 c sections.  She had them in a span of 10 years, too.  The doctors kept telling her to stop, but she said she wasn't done. (she is very religious) Every time they went in there, they were surprised that it wasn't too bad.  I wouldn't recommend that, though. :)    Edit:     I was pretty lucky. My 1st was a c section, but then I had 3 vbacs, now with the 5th I keep having a feeling I will need another c section, not sure why.
vpL67nETaa	The best thing you can do is BREASTFEED her!  Keep her immunities up.    Tell hubby to rest up and get better.    I know it's different since you and your hubby are married and live together, but my boyfriend got a really bad cold when Joel was only a month old, but I thought that it was important for Joel to see his daddy and for them to bond, and I didn't want to tell him he couldn't see his kid, so I let him hold him and cuddle him and see him.    2 and a hald weeks later, Joel is still sick :( and I feel bad, because if I hadn't let daddy hold him, he wouldn't be sick right now.    If you can, try and take control and handle all the baby work right now. If you need help, you may need to enlist your mother in law.      Keep feeling her forehead and monitering her. Take her temperature if you notice warmth or a change in behavior.  If it's elevated, and she's acting differently, call your doctor.    Any sickness in a one year old is no cake-walk, and needs to be addressed!    Hope kaylinn is ok!  It sucks having a sick baby :(|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Well, keep the baby away from the sick folks, as it seems you're doing.  Your husband will be fine.  I'd worry about yourself more, frankly.  You don't want to catch the flu and pass it on to your little one.    Edited: If you think your baby has the flu, take her to the doctor.  Probably she'll be fine but in infants that small they like to be really careful when they get sick.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	If you're nursing continue to do so. If you're bottle feeding at all (even with  breastmilk) be sure to sterilize everything, then put it someplace it won't get breathed on. If she does catch it, it'll be hard on you, but chances are she will be ok. It'll be harder if you catch it. So be sure to do lots of handwashing. I always put my fiance on the couch o rin the spare room when he is sick, just to be sure.|`|JyvG8dFcaa	make sure you get your rest...you just had a baby...your husband will be ok...good luck|`|74pfB2Bnaa	Keep baby away from daddy and breastfeed! Your breast milk is the best protection you can offer to your baby. It contains some immune protection for her. Nevertheless, daddy shouldn't be touching her, until he is over the flu, and you also should avoid hanging out with him too much (unless you are vaccinated.)  If she gets ill. Seek out your pediatrician immediately.

M5E3mDBJaa	NEVER put hydrogen peroxide, polysporin or rubbing alcohol on piercings.  If it's infected it should respond to saline solution soaks(sea salt and distilled water is best).  Saturate a cotton ball and gently press it to the affected area for 5 minutes twice a day.  It should clear up in no time.    I did this when I had my belly button pierced back when I was 18 - It healed beautifully.|`|jOBBlJnvaa	I would try getting some earings that are made with at 14K gold.

And peroxide and rubbing alcohol actually aren't recommended because they are too harsh on the skin.  I imagine that's even more of an issue for newborns.

You obviously have no hymen left.  End of story.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	It broke, when you first had sex.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	you're ridiculously skanky, sorry.  "oh my god. i've had a lot of sex. so much sex. i'm def not a virgin"  shut the **** up.  **** we get it. what difference does it make whether its broken or not?  do you honestly want to bleed while having sex? do it when your on your period, jerkwad.|`|xRd6Nxdvaa	yes its gone if you have had sex.  proven fact!|`|Zf3mUGvYaa	You are still a virgin honey. I can tell you are  very smart and great with grammar its so great you never bled from haing sex|`|1cAaxPjSaa	Well, considering that you've had sex many times, I has to be broken.  It might have broken from athletic activity too.|`|zHRWklEWaa	It probally broke before you had sex. You could have easily broken it with a tampon and not noticed the blood as you would have had your period.|`|3bQaEVmTaa	well its broken too much sex girlii hey how wud i kno im a virgin
HUsv9VU9aa	You sure do act 15 that's for sure. Now that you and your girlfriend are expecting a baby a lot of things will change. One thing for sure is to step up and act like an adult because this child will be watching both of you and babies are very smart. Stay in school and be there for your baby. I hope you both have support from your parents and hers to watch the baby. You got a tough road ahead of you. Good luck!|`|oXIYHsDaaa	first off we don't use text message short hand here, no one will take you seriously, <br>  second if you are Alejandro XD you need to be in your own account because no one will take you seriously if you ask a fathering question from a girls account, <br>  You look like a troll but I'll answer just in case. <br>  Since you are worried about it, that's a good sign it means you understand the enormity of the situation and the importance of being a good father. If you feel you had a good dad, talk to him, if not talk to another father you know that you think is doing or has done a good job. There are free parenting programs around for young parents too so check into what's available in your area.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	learn how to spell|`|rlDDTtAoaa	The best way to know how to be a parent is to watch those fathers in your life. If you happen not to have any good role models, maybe look into parenting classes. Maybe do that anyway. A lot of times they may be free or low cost. Good luck :)|`|jLYTKr33aa	I doubt it.<br>  When you do have children, though, get them some Hooked On Phonics materials.

They do it in the womb all the time too, so it's a habit more than anything. Get a video, you'll miss these cute things when they're gone.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	He surely did! My hubby and I both loved it when he did it.|`|Grmsgziaaa	Yeah, she even smiles and giggles and rolls eyes. She would look for the umbilical cord and try to suck on it, it made me kinda sad LOL. I guess I felt bad she was out in a wierd world.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	My son does it to. It's the cutest thing!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	My son still does it and he's almost three =))    I think its a common reflex, but it is cute|`|i8NOVfm0aa	nursing/sucking is a way they comfort themselves. he could be dreaming about eating lol it is veryyy cute my daughter is 13 months and still does it!|`|I1wwpx69aa	yes, both my babies have done it, i'm guessing it's the kinda dreams babies have (: ...or maybe just a natural reflex|`|uj1A73ZGaa	yes the twins still do it. Harli does it a lot because her thumb will just fall out of her mouth and she must think its still in her mouth. Aali does it when her paci falls out of her mouth.  its so cute|`|4vpK2qFYaa	My sweetheart, Skye is a newborn, Had her yyesterday, I don't know if she did or not, But my mother said i did  -Skye is here|`|LbkLg4RFaa	It's so cute.

I checked on him napping the other day and he was doing it again at 14.5 months.|`|aMpMFLo3aa	My daughter does the same thing. I think it's cute.|`|dlTdrokfaa	lol aww yeah! it's adorable. like they're drinking|`|oZdIsSSEaa	Videotape this!

Very funny to watch.|`|AA10847511	Its completely normal. During his time in your uterus all he did was suckle its basically second nature to him...it is adorable tho! Both my kids did it, my daughter sucks her thumb to this day  and she's eight!|`|39qec43kaa	It is cute when they do this.  Does your baby use a nuke?  My son does this after his nuke falls out of his mouth while asleep, he is thinking it is still in his mouth.|`|957f5fd635d1ebc7b016c62c2339fa54aa	yeah, isn't it cute and funny! my almost 7 month old still does it. I love it!|`|jgp0FUzNaa	My son has done this since day one.  Isn't it adorable!  He's almost 7 months and still does it.  I like the advice to video tape it.  Good idea.|`|POSGHgzuaa	My son did that all the time!  I was nursing him, and so his dad said that he was dreaming about me.|`|RntKwODQaa	every baby does this and so do baby animals, because sucking is a reflex to them.  its very cute when they do and it very normal
701FO16zaa	could be ligament pains. However, I had similar pains about 29 wks and went to dr and they said I had an urinary tract infection. If you are really concerned go to the drs to get checked out|`|Y3Y45d4oaa	Yes im pretty sure its just round ligament pain. Around 18 weeks is when i started getting that pain. it goes away though.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	yes sounds like ligament pain to me..im almost 34 weks and still have them..i think it gets worse the farther along i get.....it feels like a real bad charlie horse or something ripping inside.....sucks...|`|6avKnzkoaa	It's most likely round ligament pains.

However, if you're concerned regardless, just make a phone call to your doctor and they'll be more than willing to help you out. =] Best of luck!!!|`|W1p6LetFaa	That is exactly how I would describe my round ligament pain!

0ZkafLxSaa	What makes you think you were molested?  Is there a picture in your head of it happening?  Do you know who did this to you?  Are you feeling that your mother is protecting someone?  <br>  I just want to get an understanding.  <br>  I too was in a similar situation when I was about 10-11.  My uncle by marriage molested me and I know it happened.  When I told my mother after it happened she said that it may have been a dream and that maybe I was seeing things.  So I questioned myself..I still kind of do..was it a dream?  It did'nt seem to far fetched to be a dream so I just kind of always believed it. <br>   <br>  But here we are almost 16 yrs later and my uncle just got caught cheating on my aunt and the worst thing about it is that the girl that he cheated on her with accused him of rape.  When it came out I talked to my mother and brought up the story I had told her when I was little and she kind of changed the subject..not in a mean way..more like an uncomfortable one.  I think its hard for parents to hear that.  And I think in this case its a struggle for my mother because this is her sisters husband.  They have 3 children together And have been together almost 20 yrs.  How do you deal with that?  And what if it came out that it was a dream??  I know what it put on me as a child..but I got passed it and did'nt let it become an excuse for my actions..I don't ever bring it up, I don't feel the need to, it was a serious thing to me back then but now it seems so minimal that it has nothing to do with who I am.  <br>  <br>  So to answer your question I would have to ask you a question.  By telling your parents this now what will it change in the future??  Will this be something that will help you feel more comfortable that it's out there?  And do you feel almost that you are going to be relieved to have clarification?  This is ulitmately your decision and I know its hard..but if they are already acting not too concerned with your feelings then I feel like this may only make things worse with your mother.  I think you need someone to confide in, someone to give you support and I dont think your mom is going to be that person.  But I could be wrong.  All you can do is pray about it and see where it leads you..Good Luck..|`|oFVjzgT9aa	Hi, my mom always favored my older brother when I was growing up, and I had very strong resentment towards my parents as a teenager. I confronted my parents on may occasions over the years, and all though they did accept some things as true, most they denied. I recently confronted my bro about malestation and he ran to my parents and told them, denying everything. My parents are still mad at ME for opening the pandora box and not just leaving it in the past.....They don't want to know because they have difficult time dealing with the knoweledge and feel responsible, which they were absolutely not. <br>  What I learned about my parents and being a parent myself..............<br>  - Parents are like anyone else. Noone teaches you about child upbringing and you do make allot of mistakes on the way, which do affect your children. <br>  - People have difficult time accepting their mistakes and often they just don't see what you do. <br>  - You need to come to terms within yourself as to what happened to you and how it has shaped you as a person. <br>  - You need to forgive your parents for not being the "model" parents you wish they were. <br>  - One day you will be a parent, and believe you me you will not be able to be a 100% available to your children when they need/want you. <br>  <br>  Life is a complicated thing. Just because one becomes a parent, doesn't mean that the other parts of that person die automaticaly and you just sacrifice yourself completely for the sake of the child. Actually that is an unhealthy thing to do. <br>  It is good that you would like to talk to your parents, but throwing accusations of how they didn't give you enough won't get you far. No matter how much you think they didn't give you, they gave you what they could. Fed you, clothed you, educated you.................believe me, it's not easy being a parent! <br>  I suggest you share with your parets your feelings. Tell them that you feel sad and would like their help sorting out through your emotions. Tell them that you feel second best to your brother and would like their help in understanding your parents choices and reasurance that they love you. This way you are opening a door for them to come to you, instead of putting them in a line of gun fire, because they will certainly run. Tell them that you are greatful for everything they have done for you and do think what it is you need them to do in order to comphort you and reassure you of their love, as believe you me, they love you very much. Maybe not the way you want them to, but love you they do never the less. It is hurful and painful for every parent when a child comes and says "you were a bad parent, and didn't do a, b, c"<br>  Remember, just because you are a parent, doesn't mean you know what the right way is. <br>  Good luck|`|TXddP0uxaa	I had some very similar issues in my past with my mother.  Many times I've thought about confronting her, but in the end I decided it wasn't worth the effort.  <br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you are still chasing after the love and affection they have withheld from you through your childhood.  Let it go.  This isn't your fault, and in the end, confronting them is only going to make you feel more hurt and angry.  Seek therapy to move past all of this, and realize that your parents don't deserve you.|`|5VXm2Cc8aa	ive been in the same boat by i was in foster home i told my parents they didnt care my case manager thought i was lying and that stayed with me for a long time i was 12 at the time now im 27 i still visit those days but to be honest it seems like your mother knew or is in denial and my sugg that helped me i prayed to god i gave god that burden so i can move and it worked|`|bO2rzfISaa	Just like yesterday, I think you are totally wasting your time trying to make your parents accept responsibility when they're clearly incompetent. Sometimes you just have to accept that your parents will never be what you need. You don't just want to confront her, you want her to accept responsibility. You've already experienced her inability to do so. Your time would be better spent in therapy, working on YOUR ability to accept the reality of your life.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Well, aren't you hostile. Here's the thing. I'm at peace in my life. Are you?|`|q9BItD25aa	If you were 13 years old and someone molested you, you should be able to remember who it was.<br>  Go to a councilor yourself if no one agrees to go with you. This is something you need to straighten out so you can get on with your life.
vuLLbSVfaa	I like Scarlett Kathryn and Lucas Stuart Kenneth. Both seem to have the most significant meaning to you, and are cute. Go with your gut, and pick the names you think are best!

Orqw7IvLaa	your babe is still teething and so cold teething rings, bongela from the supermarket or sm33 are gels to sooth her. My son I use to put a cold piece of apple in a clean man hankie and tie it there securely.Let him chew knowing he couldn't choke. never leave her unsupervised with it. People and children grind there teeth when they have worms is the other thing so if you have a cat or dog that may be the reason. The other thing is sometimes it is a habit they grow out of and I guess positive reinforcement when she is not grinding her teeth and ignoring her when she does would be the best way to go Good luck Jenn|`|ed45267264b8e14db51a0d554e40d2a3aa	Maybe she want to smile with you, is it bad if she grinding her teeths? I don't see anything wrong with it?|`|QXSFpMzDaa	My daughter used to do the same thing around that age.  I asked her pediatrician about it and she said that most babies do grind and that usually they will grow out of it.  I would talk to her doctor at her next appointment but there really isn't much you can do yet.|`|JyvG8dFcaa	have you tried a pacifier?  call your doctors office and ask them...they should be able to tell you over the phone.|`|4vpK2qFYaa	Give her a teathing ring,  Sorry that answer sucked, Im overwhelmed  I am 17 and had a baby yesterday|`|ibWLdXlJaa	There's nothing you can do. I still do it and I have to wear a mouth guard at night for it.
1XAUxQlDaa	You can always get a second opinion even though I know you said she's been seeing her doctor since she was born. Just to be on the safe side. I know the preemies do tend to have problems sometimes further down the road. Sometimes a little slower paced than other. My son who is almost 2yrs was also born 6weeks early and is great and excelling in everything else but speech. But slowly he is getting there. I had to get a 2nd opinion just for me. My daughter is the same way. She was 8 weeks early...is now 2.5 yrs. She was a little slow around age 1 with the walking. But we just did little exercises to build leg strength and with our help as parents she started walking at 14 months. It just takes some time. Don't worry too much. But I would take her in to see if there can be some tests run and also if you can, seek a 2nd opinion. It wouldn't hurt.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	I don't want to alarm you but from the American Academy of Pediatrics book "Caring for your child from birth to age 5" children that are not walking by 18 months need to be screened for delays because something is not right. Most children are walking at or closer to their first birthday give or take a month, but 18 months is when red flags start to go up and they look for delays and problems that could be prohibiting walking.    The fact she's cruising holding onto things is a step in the right direction. Preemie or not I think by now she would have caught up a little to be closer to where more of her peers are.  If the doctors your using are not giving you a satisfactory answer than you need to find someone else and get a second opinion and look at things.|`|U5A8JQ1paa	please take her to the doctor ASAP she could have cp|`|jtiVL9PUaa	Doctors know best; take her to her pediatrician.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Have you tried her in a jolly jumper to strenghen her legs? Those things are great.    EDIT: if shes doing all those things hun i think everything is ok. every child is different. my daughter is nearly 6 months and is showing no signs of sitting by herself... but i know allot of babies that are sitting at 6 months. it makes you feel like your doing something wrong but your not xx
jsef2pnMaa	To all the people saying no a rape vicitm shouldnt get an abortion, you are very IGNORANT.  If a young woman was raped, her life is already close to being ruined, she can recover from that, but not with an unwanted baby.  Im 17, I have LIFE PLANS, Im going to go travelling, go to uni. Why would it be right for that to be taken away by being forced to have a baby.  No only will relationships, love life be ruined, it would end many chances at a successful life.  A young woman who is raped IS entitled to an abortion, WHY should they be forced to have a baby and give up their life for some sickos sexual pleasure?|`|z5K3d8alaa	abortion isnt good at all it isnt the babies fault!!|`|aOCfLAJJaa	No, regardless if she was raped, it is still something called, oh I don't know, MURDER!     No one is entitled to murder a baby that never gets a chance!|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i think that all rape victims should be offered an abortion. but at the same time, if the rape victim does what she is supposed to do and goes to the ER, she will be given a plan b pill [she doesnt HAVE to take it but she is given it] and a rape kit.|`|afSqgYBZaa	It is however you feel honey, you are the one who has to make that decision. DO NOT  let anyone tell you what to do, just follow your heart.    I had an abortion once when I was 20 years old, I did it for many good reasons. I do regret it to this day however. I found out shortly after the abortion that my mom's co-worker was waiting to adopt a baby for years because she could not have her own. If I could go back in time, I would have kept the pregnancy and given her the gift of that child.     But I cannot stress enough that the person who is pregnant needs to make that choice!! Thirteen is very young but sometimes these things happen!|`|r39EDGhPaa	Anyone is entitled to an abortion.    I don't think there needs to be justification for it.    Anyone who says it's only okay if the girl is raped, is giving the impression that they don't care about the fetus, just about punishing women for having sex lives.  How pathetic.|`|LTWlBSFNaa	i think its ok and alot of people dont but that is y i think it is ok if u get raped or r young and stupid|`|2OYyljWEaa	Yes, I think its ok in the circumstance.    The baby would have probably had a horrible life anyway and live in misery.|`|EMKuBql8aa	I think this is a loaded question and depends on the girl, her beliefs and what she feels is right. There is no right or wrong to this question.    If this happened to you, I suggest counseling so you later do not regret any decision you make.|`|TXnSKiGIaa	Isn't there a pill or something for that?|`|xVMtfuWPaa	no she should not have an abortion. who knows... she could be killing someone who could become very important.|`|e43hjVI6aa	Everything happens for a reason. Abortion is still murder.|`|wRckyuh6aa	Yes I think it a few casses it id fine. Eg. If the baby endangers the mothers life.    Or yea if she got raped.     But I don't like it that teens go and get prego and then just get an abortion.|`|oP8krEBiaa	everyone is entitled to an abortion. it depends on what you think....|`|LSkeAPBIaa	Me and my dad were talking about this earlier. I think abortion is murder if your just some skank who is not responsible enough to protect yourself. Say  your grown with a husband and children. You get pregnant again but having this baby will kill you, leaving behind a husband and kids. In a case like that I can understand abortion. I have never been raped so I can't really say. Some women may not emotionally carry/have their attackers baby. That too I can understand. I only believe in abortion under extreme circumstances.|`|Sq0aYctzaa	No, it's never okay. I know, I'm outnumbered, but I still think that even if a 13 year old girl was raped, that's not the baby's fault, and once it is born, she can just give it up for adoption. Someone will always want the baby. So no, I don't think that abortion is ever okay.    Just my opinion.|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	Yes of course but a lot of people think that is it wrong.    Legally yes she is allowed. It would be up to her and her parents to weather she got one or not, and i would hope she would have the help of a social worker in the process.|`|nZRZvsszaa	Coming from a pro-lifer....  I think abortion is OK in these cases;  Rape (incest included). And if either the mother or child will die.|`|NhBi8q80aa	I think rape is the sorriest excuse for an abortion EVER.  I'm pro-choice, I think a woman should have a right to her own body (though I would never have an abortion myself).   But the "What if you were raped?" Thing has gotten WAY out of hand.     People use it as an excuse now.  "Mommy! Daddy! I got raped under the boardwalk (which is obviously a lie) Can we go to the clinic?!"|`|wDNTZODxaa	I think in all cases your doing the same thing no matter what happened your still killing a baby. Maybe it wasn't your fault you got pregnant, but honestly you might have been able to stop it sometimes you can't but still. There is something called adoption if the mother doesn't want to keep the baby. I think in the end your stilling killing a baby. Maybe god put that baby in your life for a reason even if it was a mistake.|`|q6VreHgSaa	yes. any women who honestly does not feel ready of prepared to have a baby is entitled to have an abortion. if the women does not think that the child she is bringing into the world would not have the best possible life, then ans abortion is ok. and to any men who say abortion is wrong, go through getting pregnant and telling family and friends(especially if you are young) that you are having a baby. its the women's body. you have the right to do with it what you wish|`|XwrjRj52aa	Abortion is always okay, if a woman has sex knowing that having an abortion is a possibility if she gets pregnant, then she should not be forced to have a baby. If the resources are available and could help a lot of people, it should be a person's choice to use them. People who say a woman has no right to chose are ridiculous.|`|AA11762804	Yes, she has the right to get an abortion, but i dont believe in it, in the case of rape It is not the child's fault how it was conceived. Personally i think abortion is sick unless the pregnancy threats the mother life or the child is diagnosed with a TERMINAL disease (now i said terminal, i did not say that every child diagnosed with a disability should be aborted, I said terminal, if a child is diagnosed with a DEADLY disease and the child will only know suffering and pain for its very short life) but i will not criticize with a woman who chooses an abortion becuase of rape, i do and will criticize a person who chooses abortion cause they are not ready to be parents or they dont want to be pregnant, or they break up with their b/f and now want to kill the baby so they dont have to be reminded of that|`|hVVALFAPaa	No.      You are only ENTITLED to food, clothing, shelter, and medical attention.|`|XSdZBCJPaa	Well here is my opinion and I don't mean any offense to anyone else with other beliefs.    ABORTION DOESN'T "NOT MAKE YOU A MOTHER"...  IT MAKES YOU A MOTHER OF A DEAD BABY.    =(    I can understand if you are pregnant and you are very, very young and you are just not capable of being a mother...that doesn't mean to abort the child...please first consider other options. I mean, you can have the baby and then put it up for adoption. And don't forget to tell your parents (if you haven't already) that you are pregnant. It can be really, super, duper hard but it will help you a lot more. If you haven't, you can go to Google and search for like, phone numbers of pregnancy organizations that you can call and tell them your situation. They can find a home for you(if you've been kicked out of your house) and feed you and help you deliver the child. Sometimes even for free. And last, but totally not least...you can ask GOD to help you in the decisions that you make for that baby. Please choose wisely. Well, hope I helped!!! =D          ~Nikki =D|`|DkT8znckaa	I am totally pro-choice. It makes me really upset to see people say "There is always adoption." Not everyone gets adopted just like that, lots of adopted kids are confused about who their real parents are, and are often angry and sad. (Not all of them, but a lot of adopted kids have behavioral and emotional issues) and foster care sucks. I know I'll get thumbs down, but in some ways I think more people need to get abortions. If you are on crack or some other drugs and you are going to screw up your baby, you should just get it aborted. If there is no hope for your child, why go through carrying it just for it to have a horrible life? If you don't want the kid, or you can't take care of it you are totally entitled to an abortion. I think that every woman is entitled to it. Nobody should be forced to have a child that is going to cause them grief (such as having a child conceived from rape) or forced to have a child for any other reason. I think abortion is always okay if you want to do it. I could not imagine knowing that my biological mother couldn't take care of me or didn't want me. I couldn't live knowing I was adopted. It would eat at me all the time wondering why I wasn't good enough for my actual parents for some reason. I already have that feeling a bit with my biological parents. I'm not against adoption or anything. It's a great thing, but life isn't perfect. I know kids as young as two and three that have unfit biological parents, and you can just see the pain in their eyes.... I know it sounds corny, but it's really sad. That's a bad example, I'm not saying they'd be better off dead, and I wrote way more than I needed to, but I think abortion is always okay if that's what you want to do. It's your choice, and it's probably what is best for the kid if you really don't want it. Nobody deserves to know they were unwanted.|`|1cAaxPjSaa	YES! Females deserve the right to choose!!!
gGW7K9U5aa	They usually start to teeth around this time. My daughter started to show signs of teething when she was bout 3 months old. Shes 8 months now and still no teeth! So yes, your baby is probably teething, but it could take a couple months for the teeth to pop through.  For the time being, baby oragel works wonders! Also, if you get a cold washcloth and let the baby chew on it, that really works good too.  :)|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	2 months|`|unlpwEDMaa	My son was 3 months old when his first TWO teeth came in!

nDcSY8UQaa	children don't understand the concept of forced child support so I doubt that will make any difference on how she feels about him, the fact that he wont be around till shes 19 will.  probably should have thought of that before you had a child with him and demanded child support. looks as your both at fault and shes the innocent party, too bad her parents put money before her happiness|`|2ydF6OTAaa	What a jackass!

Anthony- This is nice.  Asher- LOVE this!!  Atticus- this feel very hip, but i like it.  Ben- I LOVE Ben. He's so sweet and friendly. Personally, I prefer it as a nic for Benjamin or Benaiah.

(if you are interested in fuller versions of names that can use Ella as a nickname - here is a start http://www.behindthename.com/php/search.... ) I have a feeling that in 30 years, this name will be as dated as Heather, Jennifer and Jessica names are today...|`|DHwPgw9iaa	I like Ella better.

aYF1RkEqaa	Well, the "terrible 2's" do actually start before a child hits 2 years.  However, I think something else may be going on here.  You just had a new baby enter this little guy's life, and it sounds like he may be missing your attention.  Even if you think you are giving him tons of attention, he sees you spending time with the new baby and wants that attention for himself.  He seems happy to get even the negative attention - how he laughs when he spills drinks or laughs when you discipline him.    Try to "set him up" to behave.  Try to catch him behaving and reward him by saying nice things to him "Good Job" or "You're so quiet today!" or by giving hugs, etc.  Also, try to teach him to put his cup on a certain table or coaster when he is done drinking - and praise him like crazy when he does it.  If he spills, don't make a big deal of it.  Just take the cup away and say "Oh, you spilled - all done".  Try not to "reward" him with any negative attention.  Also, the problem of hitting and biting can be helped with playing with dolls and the baby.  Practice touching nicely or gently - teaching him the words "nice" and "gentle" and exaggerating gentle touching.  Also, don't demonstrate hitting by hitting him.  He will learn to hit by seeing you hit him.  At this age, positive reinforcement is really the way to go.  He is too young to understand time out yet.|`|PrxlHUT5aa	oh :o) he just wants attention I bet... the mere mention of the word purposely means Mommy look at me I'm doing something!  so he is neither affected nor remorseful even when you spank him...he'd just laugh it off...he got the attention he wants afterall... the 4wk old probably is getting all the attention? maybe?     try including him in your activities with the younger sib... he can help you change his sister's nappies or shake shake that formula in the bottle... anything really!  as long as HE IS INCLUDED.  try positive reinforcement instead of scolding him when he's being "bad", catch him when he is being good :o)  you might see some changes in his behavior.    if you must seek help to take over the younger one first so you can have one on one quality bonding time with him, please do so.  make sure that he is not left out and not building up resentment coz he isn't getting his fair share of attention.  it will most probably keep the order in your home and help you in keeping your sanity in tact :o)|`|XwjL8PZCaa	yep that is about the exact time it started with my son he was a perfect angel until 18 months then I was like holy cow what happened? where is my sweet boy he is now 2 1/2 and worse then ever lol it is just a phase I have learned time out works amazingly with my son and I swear by it!~ He never hit but he used to bite and would not listen he of course does not do that anymore now he just throws tantrums if he does not get his was, we also had to tap the hands and it seemed to work but spanking did not he thought a pat on the butt was hilarious! you really are just going to have to kind of let him outgrow this stage or find a punishement that works I did time out with my son at 18 months and it took a few weeks for it to catch on but man I am so happy I stuck with it b/c like I said I swear by it once he goes to time out for somthing he won't do it again!|`|1XAUxQlDaa	I have been picking at my brain for the longest time to see if I can think of anything. But I am coming up to a dead end on it. It seems like you've tried everything. With my daughter, we used to take all the toys out of her room and make her lay in bed. Which is like time out. It works. But we also started giving her a little spanking. We were against spanking at first but she just wasnt listening. And we really didnt know what else to do. The time will pass though. My daughter is 2.5 and is far done with that stage. I guess just keep up with the time outs...be consistent with it.

d050e7668d4bfe61cb7d812a9535c0f2aa	How exciting, congratulations! With my first pregnancy I was 107 as well, only 5 feet tall. I noticed my clothes started not to fit at about 16 weeks and a definite "bump" by 4 1/2 months! So, you don't have too much longer. Enjoy your clothes while you can, and remember to wear looser pants as soon as your old clothes get tight, constricting clothes are not good for the baby. Good luck!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey,    Frame matters aswel. But every one reacts and shows differently, in pregnancy.    I started showing at 16 weeks : a bit rounder.  20 weeks for me : i was showing already.  23 weeks : obvious : 23 week Photo http://photos4.hi5.com/0056/877/071/p1r6...  25 weeks : no hiding ;) 25 week photo : http://photos1.hi5.com/0067/677/716/5jKY...    Average ladies will recieve their bump First pregnancy : 16 weeks to 24 weeks.      god Bless x it will come soon for you as you are smaller as wel. & Then the first kicks come along ;) x|`|xGedX2rIaa	i started to show ready early about 10 weeks, when i was 3 months i looked 6 but . . . . . i got to about 6 months and i just stayed the same, didnt get any bigger.|`|V8wUAVdyaa	about 26 weeks for me|`|pWDYcBA7aa	I started to show when I was about 25 weeks...|`|AuVtUjVAaa	everybody is different and are going to show at different times. I didn't start to show until 20 weeks|`|PwhrTNZraa	I'm 14w3d and I have a bump, but this is also not my first pregnancy so it's common that I could/would start to show a little sooner.  I've lost about 12lbs because of no appetite, so I'm sporting a bit of a bump and still wearing my regular clothes though!  I believe with my first pregnancy I didn't start to show until around 17-18weeks.|`|y1wlDK1taa	Congrats on the pregnancy! I just delivered my 2nd baby, but before I told my family and friends, I wasn't showing. Then I broke the news to everyone, I was about 5 months, and then I started to show. Everyone is different, but I'm sure you'll be seeing your baby bump soon.|`|UxwjpsKQaa	i was 110lbs before i was & knew i was pregnant, i found out at 3 months along. I was starting to get a baby bump then so thats what made me do a hpt. Now that im 23 weeks pregnant i'm huge everyone that sees me always say i look like im going to pop any day, even my doc says i'm really big for the week i'm on|`|w18BspcNaa	With my first pregnancy I was sometimes able to see a bump when lying flat on my back during the 4th month. The bump became visible while I was standing sometime during the 5th month. The biggest thrill for me was the first time I actually felt the baby move at around 17 weeks.|`|m7vMT6Loaa	well when i was in health class in the 6th grade, u usually start seeing ur stomach getting larger around about 6 months. Your Baby just might be a boy, because boy babies normally weigh more than girls in pregnancy. Or u could be having twins. Sometimes if ur stomach gets large ahead of time, that means double-trouble. THE TWINS!!! Hope I Helped!! PS: I payed CLOSE attention To my Health teacher in the 6th grade.... So, Basically, I know This $hit.|`|GBijP0Ddaa	i'm 5feet 2 and started out with 108 pounds, very petite.  this is my third and all of them i started showing near the end of my fifth month.  if you want you can im at yeanelle2000@yahoo.com and ill give you my link to my myspace so you can see how tiny am, i keep pics months by month|`|KMtd5gr0aa	i was about 4 months|`|vfq04nc1aa	Hi when i first got pregnant i was 92 pounds. I'm quite skinny and petite.  Im now 14 weeks pregnant and have only gained about 2 pounds but i definetly look pregnant.  This is my first pregnancy too and i do love having a little bump but i cant wait for it to become bigger. I think it will be a beautiful thing. My Finance cant wait for me to get bigger too.  My bump at the moment is poking out quite a bit.  I also heard that the smaller you are then you will show earlier in your pregnancy. But yes i guess everyone is different!  Anyway...Congrats on your pregnancy!!!

I can't think of anything my kids could do that would cause me not to celebrate their birthdays and try my best to give them a great day. (Punishment is for another day. Besides, rewards for good behavior work better anyway).    Sounds like you have a good attitude though. Spoil yourself and way you can think of and since you can't control the actions of others take your positive outlook and write a short letter to those who mean a lot to you. And maybe even to your mom and dad for what they "have" done that you appreciated.  My birthday's tomorrow and I'm going try to have fun with my kids.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY, have a good one no matter what.  JackieC
8PtNJEy5aa	You should have the doctor check for polycystic ovarian syndrome....the depo shot can also cause infertility but I had heavy painful periods and constant pelvic pain and was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome it can be diagnosed by testing your hormone levels and sometimes it won't show on an ultrasound but you could also have endometriosis it can sometimes be missed if you don't have a transvaginal ultrasound|`|HclKftzAaa	has she specifically looked for fibroids, cysts, and endometriosis? This are common causes of menstrual pain.    If you are in that much pain, then NO, everything is NOT fine. Periods are not SUPPOSED to hurt (which most women don't realize).    I would find a proper obgyn/fertility doc, and get them to investigate. There is definitely something going on, so you need more investigation. I would imagine a laparoscopy is in order so that they can check if your period blood is going back up your tubes and into your abdomen.    Good luck. :D
G9ywiLqvaa	both my sons were diagnosed with adhd.  my 5 year old is the hyper kind, my 7 year old is the overemotional with a bit of learning disability kind.  naturally, the doctor recommended meds for both --but we just took that as a suggestion. :)   instead, i researched like the devil was in me and found this great school with a holistic sped program covering therapy and tutorials.  my sons go to the school's regular classes for most of the subjects but they get pull outs for their individual programs.    the therapy is fantastic because it involves the whole family.  in fact, since starting on it, our family has never bonded more solidly.    there are parents support group meetings happening quarterly in the school, too, so i know my kids are really in good hands.  and yes --my kids are happy.  they can play, have friends, and be normal kids.  that's the most important thing.  i hope you can find such school in your area.    sure, meds work faster than old-fashioned therapy.  but i'm pretty sure we've made the right choice.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	My son has ADHD. We also stopped the meds because of the side effects. Truthfully he is doing much better without them.    My son is very hyper. I started walking him to school instead of driving. This seemed to burn off some energy before school and gave him a calm mental state so it was easier to concentrate on school work. If he can't sit and do his homework we will take him outside to play basketball or ride his bike around the block a few times. We also do a physical activity in the evening so that he can tire out and sleep better. We also changed his diet. I went to see a nutritionist and she suggested removing artificial colors and preservatives from his diet. She said some studies have shown that food additives will produce ADHD like symptoms. We now eat nothing that has a shelf life longer than a few days. No frozen dinners, koolaid, twinkies, lunch meat, chips, and the like. School lunches are full of these things so we bring a lunch everyday.    His change in diet and activities has proven a huge change in him. He sleeps better, he doesn't fidget, he can complete his school work and he doesn't have emotional outburst.|`|l1RgWnUpaa	let him run free....he's going to fail at life anyways|`|TK03jZTuaa	OK. 2 things that I can think of that might help.  firstly, flaxseed oil (also called linseed oil). If he takes two dessertspoons a day, this will help him to concentrate better at school, I guarantee it. THis has the fish oils in it and is natural. It worked wonders for my 2 ADHD kids.    Secondly, if you think there are also behavioral issues, try the Total Transformation program. This guy really understands ADHD kids and the behaviors that thye exhibit and the course is tremandous and will help you heaps. Just my opinion. Hope it helps. I wish you luck.
bmoCpcdraa	so your mom cares for you do you pay her rent since your 19 she wants whats best for you show some respect towards her fellings or move out|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Wow what a ***** you not your mom. Move out if you don't like what your mom tells you. You're old enough too and if you can't then listen to your mom. But my best answer to you is GROW UP! I thought you were about 13 while reading this till you said you're 19.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Listen to you mom...she has years of experience with being a "judge of character" and you don't.  I don't think your mom should have to wait for the girl to do something wrong to decide she doesn't like her....I honesty have found that when i get a bad vibe from someone, they eventually do something horrible.    If you dont want to have to listen to her, move out.|`|6QEiuz7Naa	Your 19.  You can do anything you want (:|`|I1tnVvVGaa	you're 19. your mom can't pick your friends for you! i'm 23 and married, and my mother STILL thinks she can do the same thing. just ignore her. she'll get over it.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	if your 19 you shouldn't be even asking your mom to go places  move out and get your own place and u can do whatever u want|`|cd37yLuZaa	its your choice, u are old enough to make ur own desicions|`|kb8xHjCFaa	You have to remind her that it's not fair to judge people she doesn't know and that she's already said yes...|`|lWy5M1x9aa	Just confront her with the fact...it is out of line for the parent of a 19 year old to STILL be trying to be that controlling.|`|CNSGz12zaa	If you live under her roof she has the right to tell you who you can go out with so move and then you can do what you want.|`|Po2UqfvWaa	i don't understand what the issues is. i could see if you were mentally challenged that you would need to ask to go out at 19 to a movie. by reading this, i see you're clearly not. so i guess until you're ready to grow you'll need to follow your mommy's rules and not have a voice and continue to be afraid. good luck|`|kW371HVMaa	just be like mom shes my friend if she goes in the wrong path its not like im going to follow what shes doing! Im 19 mom you taught me alot.shes a really nice girl and u dont even know her mom so you cant judge i will invite her over to hang out and you will see how nice she is!    BTW (when i say "goes in the wrong path" i ment like drugs,smoking,drinking etc.)|`|9FDAYDheaa	That's a difficult situation.  chances are that she knows your friend is gay.  maybe she heard you talking about it on the pnone or saw it on your friends info on facebook    If it were me I say screw you and hang out with who I wanted gay or not.  but i'm not you and you probably wouldn't do that.    maybe tell your mom that you are 19 and can make your own choices and it makes no sense not to hang out with someone because your mom gets a bad vibe    ask her how it would make her feel if you said that you got a bad vibe about one of her friends and disliked her friend and wouldn't let her see her.    try to be calm and explain your point of view but also listen too your mother's point.|`|rLXNwqbFaa	your old enough to decide who to hang with|`|1R5MEDDVaa	fake cry and beg|`|R8w9mth1aa	Tell Mama I do what I want! 19 years old, do your thing!|`|rkjQpGNWaa	MOVE OUT.lol ur 19 get an apartment dumbshit. jk jk jk.but seriously just go out with her anyway|`|o503YPrqaa	Why does it matter that she is gay? are your parents religious or homophobic.. thats lame.

Your mom shouldn't decide anything you do. You pick who you want to be friends with because you know truly who is a good person.|`|PflKM0QUaa	why are you asking your mom if you can go out if your 19? its your choice who you're friends on... just stand up to your mom and tell her that she is also your friend and if she loves and trust your judgement than she would back off and let you be an adult|`|CEP9Xng0aa	tell her you feel your friend is a good person. that you will still take her opinion under consideration but you know your friend and enjoy spending time with them. maybe even mention that your friend is gay if you feel it is a good situtuation to; so you could judge her reaction and try to talk about it. be honest, calm, respective and act like an adult and hopefully your mum will respect you|`|Jb6xUVfGaa	my mom is the ssssssaaame way. im 18. It sucks. try talking with her and write down reasons why she should trust you and just be mature and adult like when you guys are talking and let her know that your trying to be serious just hear you out.|`|Mdv5lv8haa	i had the same problem when i was 18 and live at home...im 19 now...but my mom did not like my cousin at alllllll....she hated her...and for no reason....it was like if she didnt like my aunt she didnt like my cousind and me and my sister would suffer,cuz all i hung out with was my siser and cusin. an everytine i asked my mom to go somewhere id have to hear all this junk about my cousin....just like the saaaaaaame stuff everytime...always saying she was a bad influence and a hoe andwhat not...but none of i was true she didnt even have a reason to believe what shewas saying. and the fact that she was mixed so my mom sweared she gets favored and thinks shes a certan way......but it got soooooo anooying. me and my sster woud just say where going somewhere else but be with my cousin...and sometims just figure how much fun we have is worth my mom complaining lol....so if i where you just act like her opinion on your frend doesnt faze you like you could care less what she thinks about her and keep hangin out. just think eventually youll move out and not have to deal wit it. but until then jut igore it. misery likes company....if shes mad about you goin out shes gonna try to get to you and make you mad...hope i helped and good luck|`|bf7711519184031a4029ec03ac2717bfaa	do what i do... dont let your mom know that your going to hang out with this friend... when she asks who you're going to be with just respond "some friends" when she asks who, mention the name of the others... IF she askes if there will be anyone else say "not as far as i know..." that way you're not lying... you're just not telling the truth.    she shouldnt be telling you who to hang with or what to do. she should seriously let you live your life... and if it turns out your friend is bad then you will decide the right thing to do then...

But i dont really care for it.  As the first person said, http://www.watch-movies.net is a website that allows you to watch full movies for free, i think its illegal though. If you cant seem to find the movie on that website, go to your local wal-mart and ask them if they have it.   Good Luck.|`|7fJsXVE6aa	www.watch-movies.net    They have so many movies to choose from!!

SnVwHG3iaa	Well i'm sure you should know this, your spelling and grammar is very good for a child who doesn't know how a baby is made.  It's called having sex, when the man inserts his erect penis into the woman's vagina.  When the man ejaculates the sperm lead through the cervix into the uterus and up to the fallopian tubes where an egg (if the woman is ovulating) will be waiting for the sperm to fertilize.  Once this happens it will travel down into the uterus, this takes around 6-10 days and attaches to the lining of the womb.  It starts growing and 40 weeks later a baby os born.    xx
kv8ZFPP1aa	it's not only white women who make false rape accusations!! women of every color do and it's not fair to the women that have really been raped.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Well, I think your somewhat correct, I think that false claims of rape just to get some money come from white women majorly (It's not racist because I said WOMEN, I never said "ALL").|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i was very interested in your question until you threw in white women.        you are ignorant. i stopped reading at white women, waste of time|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	I have no idea why..... It makes me sick to think somone would do that!    Im white, i know your not being racist i believe its a majority of white women too|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	its not about race any more its about financial class  *rich girls are usually white girls*    These are reasons for false accusations:    -they want attention  -want to get back at the guy and dont see how serious the guy's life will be damaged or dont care  -they regret their sexual action and take it out on the guy or any guy|`|q6VreHgSaa	people; men, women, whites, blacks, asians.... who lie about something as serious as rape, have a serious problem. They want/need attention. maybe they don't have a happy life and they think one day they will get raped. im not trying to defend the people that lie, im just saying that the root of their problem is way deeper then just getting a kick out of lying.|`|AA11762804	actually, race has nothing to do with it, there are just as many black woman as there are white who lie about being raped. It has absolutely nothing to do with the color of a persons skin. It all comes down to the situation your in and the type of person you are.|`|gs253Tlvaa	Basically, I don't believe in rape.  Doesn't make sense.    I mean, a guy could go to prison for like, the rest of his life  There might be a few crazy dudes who think that's an acceptable risk, if they're raping their favorite movies star, or pop singer.  But 20 years to life for raping some girl in his neighborhood?  I don't think so.   By far, the majority of women who "cry rape" just want attention, and they WISH they were so irresistable that some guy--any guy--would find them desirable enought to commit a felony for.

The bacteria will multiply on their own, so you don't have to feed him a whole carton.  Just do it a couple of times a day.    If you don't want it to be a food, ask his doctor about a probiotic capsule.  (Like yogurt in a pill!)  I don't know if they make them for kids or not.  Some company also makes probiotic straws, so the child can drink the beverage of their choice through the straw.  Fun!
RPszYGXkaa	I guess anything is possible, but typically they are 12-14, sometimes 16.  Are you charting your BBT?  If so and you are experiencing a long luteal phase with high temps, then you may want to take a home preg. test soon!      Our luteal phases generally don't alter much (maybe on day or so).
f2ae56134c701bec40583a856d15ba10aa	Depends on the side...  Left lower side could be trapped gas. It can be very painful. You'd be surprised at the number of people that end up in the ER complaining of abdominal pain and it's gas and/or constipation.    Right side could be appendicitis. Or a another viral or bacterial infection. Or any number of things that could clear up on their own.    If the pain is significant and isn't helped by over the counter pain meds you should consult your doctor.  Also, if it is at all possible you are very early in a pregnancy it could be an ectopic pregnancy. Are you having any shoulder pain, as well?  Best of luck|`|fPJTZwoUaa	agree with chad    - etopic pregnany  - indegiestion  - pulled muscle|`|EMKuBql8aa	Appendicitis is a big one.|`|IxG2SMlEaa	A bacterial infection yes but a yeast infection no. Yeast infection does not come with pain. Are you certain its on one side. And what type of pain is it. If its severe it can come from ur appendictics.|`|5UcdeeX8aa	right side is your appendix.|`|ansbaQxqaa	If you experience sharp pain, you may have stones in your galdbladder or kidneys. This is due to extreme weight loss for example. My sister experienced this one day she had pain on one side of her abdomen then as the days went by the pain grew stronger and stronger. Then she went to the doctor and she had to have surgery to have her galbladder removed she had seven small stones.  Go to the doctor!!
9IFF0vIoaa	Ask her more open ended questions.<br>  <br>  Or you could start answering all her questions with "I don't know."<br>  <br>  Mom, can I got to a friend's house?  "I don't know."<br>  Will you lend me some money?  "I don't know."<br>  What are you making for dinner?  "I don't know."|`|H2IqzG12aa	She's just pulling your chain.  When she says this, just tell her to try again.  You're worried about HER getting mad at YOU?  You're the mom, here.  Demand a straight answer or it's time for time out.<br>  <br>  (I was tempted to mention Mark Twain's story about being asked a question, which he was gratified to be able promptly and confidently, "And I did.  I said that I didn't know."  But that wouldn't have been helpful.)|`|IU54cQhsaa	She's 11 ... I'm pretty sure that no matter what you do there are going to be times where she is super mad at you. I know that my mom did things when I was 11 until about 15 where I was super mad at her. Now I look back and laugh because the things I was mad about were so ridiculous. <br>  <br>  Personally I think the "I don't know thing" is a serious issue even though it sounds innocent. She is getting to that age where she is going to pull back from you and be exploring new things at the same time.  I know that the close relationship that I had with my mother helped me through my teen and tween years enormously. I learned things from her versus most of my friends who (unfortunatly) learned things through each other. <br>  <br>  I would just have the discussion about it and let her get mad at you. She'll get over it and hopefully (as long as it's done in a friendly matter) she'll feel comfortable talking to you about things.|`|IHm8A3qKaa	Well, you need to work out at both ends. Chances are, your daughter wants you to back off a bit and is trying to irritate you or end the conversation with "I don't know." First, you need to stop asking her as many questions as you do now. If she stills says, "I don't know", try asking her about it when she's in a good mood.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Nah, that's a myth.    Eat to hunger, and drink to thirst.  To loose weight make healthier choices and things that keep you full longer (like veggies) and exercise.  (You might need to give up skittles *lol*)    Weight Watcher's has programs for nursing moms, and they are one of the few programs that show long term results.    http://www.kellymom.com/newman/12more_bf...  2. A breastfeeding mother has to eat more in order to make enough milk.    Not true! Women on even very low calorie diets usually make enough milk, at least until the mother's calorie intake becomes critically low for a prolonged period of time. Generally, the baby will get what he needs. Some women worry that if they eat poorly for a few days this also will affect their milk. There is no need for concern. Such variations will not affect milk supply or quality. It is commonly said that women need to eat 500 extra calories a day in order to breastfeed. This is not true. Some women do eat more when they breastfeed, but others do not, and some even eat less, without any harm done to the mother or baby or the milk supply. The mother should eat a balanced diet dictated by her appetite. Rules about eating just make breastfeeding unnecessarily complicated.    http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/mom/mo...  Yes! Nursing mothers can lose weight safely if they follow some basic guidelines.  Six guidelines for safe dieting during lactation     Wait until your baby is two months old before dieting  It's best not to do anything consciously to lose weight until after the second month. This gives your body enough time to successfully establish a healthy milk supply that is less likely to be adversely affected if your caloric intake is restricted. Breastfeeding your baby, on average, burns 200-500 calories per day (above what you needed to maintain your pre-pregnancy weight) -- so keep in mind that even without a weight loss program you are burning extra calories.     Breastfeed without restriction  Research tells us that both more frequent breastfeeding and breastfeeding longer than six months increases maternal weight loss.     Eat at least 1500-1800 calories per day  While nursing, you should not consume less than 1500-1800 calories per day, and most women should stay at the high end of this range. Some mothers will require much more than this, but studies show that going below this number may put supply at risk.     Keep weight loss at less than 1.5 pounds per week  Most moms can safely lose up to 1.5 pounds per week or 6 pounds per month after the second month and not affect milk supply or baby's well being. One study has suggested that short-term weight loss of 2.2 pounds (1 kg) per week is not a problem (in this study, moms dieted for 11 days).     Decrease the calories gradually  A sudden drop in calories can reduce milk supply. Some moms notice this during an illness, although dehydration and/or medication use could also be a factor in reduced milk supply when mom is sick. It has been hypothesized that a sudden calorie decrease can cause mom's body to go into "starvation mode" and cut nonessential resources such as milk production.     Avoid quick-fix solutions  Liquid diets, low-carb diets, fad diets, weight loss medication, etc. are not recommended while breastfeeding.    http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/mom/mo...  According to Katherine A. Dettwyler, Ph.D., breastfeeding researcher and anthropologist, women throughout the world make ample amounts of quality milk while eating diets composed almost entirely of rice (or millet or sorghum) with a tiny amount of vegetables and occasional meat.    Are healthy eating habits recommended for mom? Absolutely! You will be healthier and feel better if you eat well. It is best for anyone to eat a variety of foods, in close to their naturally-occurring state, but this is not necessary for providing quality milk or for maintaining milk supply. Although it is certainly not recommended, a breastfeeding mother could live on a diet of junk food  mom would not thrive on that diet, but her milk would still meet her baby's needs.     What IS needed for maintaining an ample supply of milk?    The main thing needed to maintain an ample milk supply is simple --  The more often and effectively your baby nurses, the more milk you will have.    http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news.p...  He said there was a common misconception that malnutrition greatly reduced the amount of milk a mother produced when studies had shown that the amount produced depended on how often and how effective the baby sucked on the breast.    "If a mother temporarily produces less milk than the amount the infant needs, the infant will respond by sucking more vigorously, more frequently or longer at each feeding," he added.    In such situations, he urged mothers who are under-nourished to address their nutritional status rather than ignoring it.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	you dont need to eat extra calories, just eat when you are hungry.|`|68c6B8dRaa	No, no. You may find you don't need to eat much more at all.    "A breastfeeding mother has to eat more in order to make enough milk. Not true!

I still eat piggishly with a 17mo nursling, and need to eat frequently.    edit: ;-)|`|i8NOVfm0aa	hahha skittles arnt to bad dont worry! just lay off the carbs and yes you still need extra calories! i gained almost 100 pounds with a 7 pound girl! and i am less now then before i got pregnant. you will lose it dont worry!|`|fgMurwHSaa	I think that you should-it'll give the baby the nutrients that it needs.I know what you mean about twins-I was HUGE before mine were born...and thats not a good feeling!You burn what you gain pretty fast after the baby is born,so I wouldn't worry about it.And do you mind me asking-boy or girl?
vJEatJFPaa	Livi gets a bath every other night...We usually tickle and make her laugh while dressing her in her pjs, give her a bottle/rock her, and off to bed she goes! :)|`|i8NOVfm0aa	i think it is good to have a routine like that. maybe as she gets older she will start to say it back to you, i think its cute. i think i should start doing it lol|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	I give my two and three year old a snack, put on their jammies, brush their teeth and read a couple stories.  A favorite bedtime story here is goodnight moon too!!!|`|sMukgX7Xaa	I do with my son. I tell him "Good night sleep tight and to get some sleep. Mommy loves you and will see you in the morning baby boy" I usually lay beside him or rock him until he falls asleep. With my youngest I feed her then lay her down and kiss her forehead and tell her the same thing except at the end it's "mommy's princess".|`|uj1A73ZGaa	that's a good routine you have.     Our routine is that the girls get a bath before bed and than we put our two year old to bed. We read three books that she chooses and than say good night and give her kisses and tuck her in.    Our twins get a bath after our two year old goes to bed. Than we put their pj's on and I breast feed them and put them in their cribs and they sleep til about 5:30am.|`|ef42ST45aa	My son is almost 10 months. Just about every night it goes like this: I nurse him and read him a story while doing so-or I sing him a song, we brush our teeth, I change his diaper, my husband kisses him and tickles him a little bit and says goodnight, then I kiss him and tell him I love him and say good night, then lay him down on his back. He IMMEDIATELY flips over and tucks his arms and legs under him and reaches back for his blanket and pulls it up over him. I hand him his stuffed frog and he pulls it up under him and then we turn off the lights and I shut the door.|`|sHKrDChwaa	I usually feed my little girl her last bottle of the night, we play and snuggle until she's ready for bed. Then I lay down with her until she falls asleep. After that she's moved to her bed and gets a kiss on her cheek.|`|aLQV54bcaa	Yes. =)  I carry my 6 month old son into his room and give him his pacifier (his "bedtime" signal).  I give him a big hug and we sway for a few minutes while I tell him that he's going to have sweet dreams and what we'll do tomorrow.  I lay him down, cover him up, and give him a kiss on the cheek.  I put the crib rail up, stroke his hair once more and tell him I love him and goodnight.    Wow...just teared up a bit!  They grow so fast!!|`|JyvG8dFcaa	sounds like your are making wonderful memories for you and your baby...great routine...|`|POSGHgzuaa	It's really useful to have a routine, but OK to miss part of it now and then.  Having a routine means that you can replicate if you're away from home, but skipping part of it every once in a while means your baby won't be totally dependent on every step of it in order to fall asleep.    We like to take a bath (about half the time), read a few bedtime books (all the time), and sing lullabies before putting my son in his crib.|`|jgp0FUzNaa	Kyler has a bath every night, followed by some snuggles and maybe a story.  He drinks his bottle and then is tucked in to bed.  He likes to play with a couple of stuffies and his FP rainforest crib toy for a few minutes.  He's given lots of kisses and I always wish him a good night's sleep.  I part with "see you in the morning."  It's wishful thinking.  I keep hoping...but not yet!  We'll get to a time when he sleeps for longer than 4 hours at a time.|`|iTXnHiwTaa	Drink last bottle while listening/singing to lullaby music CD, then kiss and snuggle, change diapers, put in sleep sac, turn off lights, low white noise machine, hold and kiss for 5-10 min then lay in crib drowsy - extra kiss and say "night night baby."

Don't forget to also decide for yourself; what name do YOU think would sound nice with Willem?  Lawrence or Matthew go nicely with Willem. For an overall evenness of sound, it is best to match names with the same number of syllables, or something that will sound rhythmic. Duncan dips a little lower than Willem in sound and pronunciation, therefore I'd recommend the first two (Lawrence and Matthew) as a better choice.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	lawrence sounds best to me.|`|TYRRjIv4aa	I like both Willem Lawrence and Willem Matthew.

I am not sure that the ratings matter anyway.  You seem too real to go to a lot of high schools so you should go somewhere you can be happy.    Thank you and good day.|`|G9ywiLqvaa	well if your mom's ok with the idea, and so are you, and you have friends there who can vouch for the school's performance --then it's a win-win situation!  go for it!    a student needs to be happy and motivated to learn after all.    just make sure the move will be worth your while.  you can't move every time something ticks you off, you know.  so move with a positive disposition and show your mom you've made the right choice. good luck!|`|YQrKQ5PAaa	The people will be the same no matter what school you go to.

I had 2 coworkers whom I was very close to & they fell out with each otr but I stll talked & made jokes with both of them whether they were in eye or ear shot of each otr. The problem was with them not me therefore I felt no need to stop talk to either one, you should do the same.

He probably doesn't mean to hurt your feelings he just wants to make sure that you've got all your education completed and done so you won't have to delay it any longer etc. Sit him down and have a talk to him about your feelings. Best of luck|`|66jX06Onaa	You need to agree on this. Take some time to talk - like a quiet evening out together. You need to find out what he's thinking and explore ideas. Be open and willing to listen. Then take some time to think about it, and make another date to go out and discuss it further.    There are no perfect answers -  you and your husband need to make this decision together.|`|KqdhWG1maa	You might have to find some other guy to do it!  could be exciting, think about it.|`|sMukgX7Xaa	Yes, my husband changed his mind after 2 months and then when I finally agreed to wait...I found out two weeks later I was already preg. Talk to him and tell him that you really want this baby and that you don't want to wait. Tell him that by the time you graduate your son will be nine and that's just far apart to have kids.|`|UqvGKax1aa	Your husband is probably trying to look out for you. Finish your PhD then try for baby  2. you shouldn't have a baby or try to get him to have one unless he is totally on board.|`|Y3Y45d4oaa	l0l im sorry but i do have to laugh at this because my husband said the same thing! he said this was our last month trying till i finished school, and we got pregnant! im now 30 weeks along with a healthy baby girl, so maybe it will turn out for you to =]   its true when you stop trying it happens.   but if it doesnt happen like that for you then i would suggest sitting him down and explaining to him that you can do it, (school & a baby) and that you dont want such a huge gap between the ages of your kids.|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	Did you sit down with him and ask him why he feels this way?    It sounds like maybe he wants to do something else too and a baby might hinder what he wants?    Tell him you don't want your oldest to be 9 when you have another baby.  Ask him why he is having cold feet?    Pray about it before talking to him.|`|KMtd5gr0aa	Rude!! U cant just change your mind on something like that... Who does he think he is? ''Oh by the way honey JUST KIDDING i dont want a baby anymore'' Thats just nuts!|`|804cb911d4cc8bd5e313f515a2485812aa	tell him if he want sex he'll have to take his chances.|`|pjgMW6qaaa	Its not about how desperately *YOU* want a baby..  Both of you have to feel the same way about having a baby...  Maybe he will change his mind and decide not to wait 5 yrs but less.    Hope things work out for the best.    God bless|`|Y1Lb5f4Eaa	Oh honey. I'm sorry. I would sit down and talk to your husband. If this came out of no where, then it's possible that there's something else bothering him. It's hard, but it takes two people to make a baby so you're going to have to get him to see your point of view if you want to get what you want.|`|UxwjpsKQaa	artificial insemination.. just get him to ejaculate in a cup for you lol|`|420b566c6be46c8a14fa93ca8490e7afaa	I think the best thing is to sit down and ask your husband exactly why he doesn't want a baby now.  There could be something else bothering him.  Talk to him about why you want one and decide which decision is best for you guys.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	wait.  Both partners should be on the same level when it comes to making/having another baby.  Maybe in another year or two he'll want to again instead of waiting five years.|`|TcZlpXtKaa	u got a lot of time... why rush into things quickly, studies will take a lot of energy and time so a baby|`|urrmckQBaa	Maybe its the pressure of trying is too much for him and with no results he might feel like he is failing you. Talk to him and tell him you dont want to stop trying, its dificult for a woman to just 'stop trying' as we have alot of emotional needs to fulfill but men dont understand. If you go along with his needs you might regret it and eventually that regret might turn into resentment.    I use the word might as i do not know you but i know i have been in a similar situation and eventually stopped trying THEN fell pregnant.    Trying for a baby becomes somewhat of a chore i think especially for men, if you just went with the flow it would take the pressure off both of you.    good luck :)|`|AA11762804	I had the same problem. I cut him off from sex and he caved after a few months, also moping around and acting all sad helped too, tell him your to depressed to have sex. Men can only last so long without it|`|RQvldWeOaa	Well I have a different take on this when some have said to just wait. Let's say you go to get your Phd. and then you try to have a baby. What are you going to do after you get your Phd.? Are you going to go to work and put your baby into daycare and also have baby  2 9 years apart from the oldest child? If you don't have any finacial crisis now and can afford to stay home with baby  2 and then go back to school when they are in school you will be able to spend more time with child  1 as well as  2. If you get pregnant now you may be better off staying at home with  1 and then when baby  2 arrives you will still be home so when the first is in early years of school you can watch him/her off and be able to still be there for  2 as much as you were there for  1 then going to school, then having baby  2, putting baby in daycare while you work to support both rather than waiting till baby  2 goes off to school. It will only be about 5 more years before you even go back to school when baby  2 starts going to school if you plan to stay home with him/her. Good luck and I know both couples should want to have a baby or more kids but given your situation you have to think of why you would be going back to school in the first place. Would you want to have a baby which may keep you from going back to work (pregnancy sickness or may not want to work at that time, plus the time it may take till that baby is in school full time and you won't be able to give the baby your full attention if you had the baby before you went off to school? Think about it. Try to arrange a list of positives and negatives of having another baby. If some outweigh the other then see how much of an inconvenience it may be if you do have a baby and plan to go to work after your degree. I personally don't want daycare rasing my kids so I'd wait till baby   2 is in school and I can take classes while both kids are in school. You can be in school in five years from now with both kids and I've read that a woman's fertility decreases as she gets older and if you will be over 40 the chances of birth defects increase. If you truly can't afford a baby now and then you go get your Phd. go to work and then decide to have a baby after you work for awhile (could be more than 5 years if you plan to use your degree) then you may not be able to give your kids your full attention if you need someone else to take care of them. Unfortunately both my in-laws passed away after my last was 7 but the first was when she was 3 and she does remember bits of grandma but if I hadn't had the 3rd till later my kids and I wouldn't be in school together now. I can be with them at night and get them off to school in the morning. Why start over with another baby after you graduate if you plan to use your degree? Not only that but say you have a baby after your degree and stay home? You may not remember as many details or be as alert with the education cause you hadn't done anything but stay home with baby  2 till that baby is in school. I would rather work after I get my degree when I can not start all over again with a new baby. Good luck with your decision.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Maybe he is afraid you won't finish college if you have another baby. Why is this so important to him? You need to iron this out with him. It takes two and you need him to be on board with any plans you make about having another baby.|`|fPJTZwoUaa	r u pregnant yet ?  - maybe hes worried about the financial side of things and the difficulties with raising another child with a reduced income   if ur really ken to have another one sit down and talk to him  about it ad   maybe he has some valid points against  having another baby at the moment|`|F8iyUqJBaa	You need to talk with him and tell how you feel and that this isn't a switch you can turn on and off like that.  You both need to get on the same page.  I would be really upset if my husband tried that with me.
H1ubEdiTaa	It got us twins. Good Luck.|`|7ZPNSIspaa	me and my hubby are a success story :) I'm on metformin and was placed on clomid and now we're 15 weeks preggers. I asked my doctors about the twins and she told me that the rate isn't as high as you think but the chances are increased. Unfortunately and thankfully we're blessed with the one :) Good luck tho hun! :)|`|8d53e7c5fa87616efe133d0d8b8b5691aa	one of my good friends took both and now has a healthy baby girl. she only took them for three cycles and was able to get pregnant.before taking them she was not ovulating at all. Hope this helps and good luck.
AA12243380	Well, there are several ways!    One way is random, identical twins are random (although some studies suggest that there is a protein in the sperm that encourages a zygote to split)     One way is when hyperovulation is part of your genetic makeup thus causing you to drop two eggs every so often.  (This is how I got my twins!)    Another way is to take fertility drugs    Another way is to have in vitro fertilization|`|y56BkEcMaa	I heard if you eat sweet potatoes it will make you release more eggs, or you can always take fertility treatments|`|SZ9Cm5f2aa	It's either genetic or because the egg breaks into two and forms two babies. That's what I learned in health class so yeah.|`|TyhJBoxwaa	Well mostly its genetic. Some people get it out of luck.|`|RrPjG9x9aa	luck.  there's no way to "ensure" you get twins.  it's something that happens every once in a rare while by nature.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	you pray|`|Ka52nbhNaa	Approximately 3% of all births are multiple births.  Identical twins are random when the egg splits into two . . . fraternal twins occur when the woman releases more than one egg for fertilization.  This can occur randomly, it may have a genetic link if there is a history of fraternal twins on the mother's side of the family.    Being overweight and/or over 35 also shows a higher risk for twins.  Then there are fertility medications and treatments which may cause you to release more eggs or have more eggs transferred back in an IVF cycle.  Even if you do release multiple eggs or go through fertility treatments there are no guarantees that you will have a successful birth of one child let alone twins.    Best wishes!|`|E0gm0mRBaa	usually it's genetics or through IVF|`|i8NOVfm0aa	my brother and his wife are having indentical twin boys which i am told are the most rare type. and they have no clue how. it runs in the family but  not for identical twin boys
114h8jqKaa	yes it feels like you cant hold it. it may continue for a little bit. you can usually tell becuase the feeling like youre peeing cant be stopped by yourself|`|QM6wiVtVaa	No, it feels like you're leaking, or like a very heavy menstrual flow.|`|xyI7PRuhaa	you may feel like you need to pee after you water breaks b/c the baby is lower and pressing on your bladder.
HclKftzAaa	you should be sure to drink plenty of water while you're pregnant. Get used to it now, because in the third trimester, if you get dehydrated, you will start to retain water and you feet will blow up like balloons! So no comfy.    Also, juice has a lot of sugar in it. your body needs to get it's energy from more nutritious sources than juice.    You skin my be drying out simply from the hormones your body is producing. Try some moisturizer, or some Dove soap. :)    Gratz!|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Start drinking more water...you need to.A lot of juice is not healthy.    You can even try drinking a glass of an electrolyte drink everyday.There is a brand of electrolyte water called "smart water".|`|7WcfzvPvaa	When I was pregnant, I got dehydrated very often, to the point that I ended up in the hospital.  I don't know why your forehad is pealing, but I do suggest that you drink plenty of water.  If you don't, you could go into labor.

QveBSjFSaa	i don't know about any programs in your area, but you can ask the judge to stipulate that you both go to parenting classes.  Judge ordered this in my Husband and his ex's case, because the mother was alienating their daughter so obviously and horrifically against her father.  Consequently, my Husband and I went to the parenting classes.  His daughter's mother did not.  And the alienation continues to this day, 8 years later.  Good luck.
2nfMSDiPaa	Try taking prenacare prenatal vitamins!I been ttc august 2007 no luck so far...But I only been taking pregnacare the last 3 months!!  Im not giving up hope...here are some foods that contain Folic acid    Leafy green vegetables are a good source of folate. And manufacturers are now required by the FDA to add folic acid to enriched cereal grain products such as flour, pasta, and rice. So replace the regular cereals with these and add a bowl of fresh salad to your daily diet. Other sources of Folic acid include, chicken liver, beef liver, lentils, wheat germ, spears, asparagus, papaya, broccoli, cantaloupe, eggs, canned salmon.    .Millions of baby dust to you...Good-luck!!|`|Boubyng3aa	I know where you are coming from, my husband and i have been ttc for over 19 months now, and no luck. For about the first year or so i did not go to the dr, we kept thinking that I would get pregnant even though my periods were not regular. So finally after about a year or so, i went to the dr and found out that i have pcos, my hormone levels, and thyriod levels were very low, and i also have insulin resistance. Had i not went to the dr, i would not have known this and could not have gotten help. I am getting ready to start my first cycle of clomid, so hopefully that will help me conceive. We also tried everything and nothing helped, had i went to the dr sooner and found out what was wrong, i would most likely have already gotten pregnant. If i were you, i would go to the dr and get checked out, i am not saying that you have pcos, but you could have low hormone levels or anything. Something as simple as meds could fix whats wrong and you could conceive. I would give anything if i had went to the dr sooner. Best of luck and tons of baby dust.
aYF1RkEqaa	I'm sorry - Am I totally missing something?    Your daughter was in gym class and wanted to work on Math?  So, if she was in math class and wanted to play basketball, would that be okay?  I think she should be participating in the class that she is in at the moment - I think the teacher had every right to tell her to participate in the class.  Also, I can't believe that you think it is okay for your daughter to talk back to a teacher.  Shouldn't your daughter have any respect for authority or for the rules of the school?|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Your daughter is at fault here, not doing what she was supposed to have been doing in a given class.  If it's true that the teacher spoke out of turn to her, that's obviously not good. However, given another chance to do the right thing, your daughter still defied the teacher.    Just a point about being a supply teacher -- I was one for years, and it's REALLY REALLY hard! Way harder than being a regular teacher in so many ways. Even if you have been at a particular school or with a particular class before, you can't remember specificities about each child (unless it's particularly noted by the teacher you are subbing for), even names, for gosh' sake. You don't know the quirks and foibles of the students, etc. It's just tough. You try to get the lesson plans done as outlined... as well as you can. Sometimes it's just getting through the day - you weren't there the day before for continuity's sake, and you may not be there the next day, to follow up.    I think at 13, your daughter should have been handling this a lot better than she did.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	I think your daughter has already handled the problem well. If the principal does not see fit to punish your daughter then I don't think you need to involve yourself in it. I think it's great that you still think your daughter needs to be polite to authority figures regardless of their fitness to be authority figures. I would call the principal and see that the supply teacher has been handled. Nothing gets the principal moving like a call from the parent!|`|lcxyOS7uaa	The teacher should not have talked to her like that, but at the same time it really wasn't appropriate for her to ask to study for a math test in gym. For now, I would just speak to your daughter and tell her that if she needed more time to study, she should have done it at home, etc. and I would drop it with the teacher for now, and only bring it up if it happens again, because both your daughter and the teacher were wrong in some way.|`|kW371HVMaa	Dont punish your daughter!  Talk to the supply teacher OR the principal.|`|2ydF6OTAaa	While your daughter SHOULD have been participating in P.E. she should not have had to do so the entire hour(I mean lets face it, everyone is not a sports fan, PE should be one of the so called classes that you DO get a little free time in) but, at the same time, I understand that she wanted to study for the test. I think she handled the situation pretty well w/o cussing him out. He's a dick. If anyone should be blamed it should be the coach(assuming that you did not leave out any details).|`|6QEiuz7Naa	She did the right thing   (:|`|fdnbXfvfaa	No, do not punish your daughter.  Complain about the teacher|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	It's good that your daughter stood up for herself. I'd send in a written complaint over the teacher, and leave it at that for the time being.|`|XUwtAWzkaa	Absolutely not, do not get on to your child.. go straight to the administration building and file a complaint about that man.. he obviously dosent lack understanding of child's needs.|`|o503YPrqaa	No what is punishing your daughter for trying to get ahead by studying and being right in the first place? lol. Your daughter is in the right, and the principal agreed. I think you should lodge a complaint with the principal about the teachers behavior.. Its inappropriate and I know its gym but they can not FORCE anyone to do anything against their will. I have asthma and had to deal with teachers trying to force me to do things.. That ended poorly on their part.|`|ixJSutYuaa	I'm probably going to be unpopular here but I'm sure you want our honest opinions if you took time to post this. If it was gym class she was supposed to be playing ball. I respect that she wanted to study but if every student decided what they wanted to do during each class,nothing would ever get done. She shouldn't think it is ok to refuse to do what she is supposed to do in class just because she would rather do something else.|`|8552a4e84a403e597110d3e39aa0659eaa	Congratulate your daughter for standing up for herself. Then go talk to the principal about this teacher. If there really is a history of verbal abuse, the principal needs to be made aware that if any further confrontations happen between your children and the teacher, that you expect there to be a full investigation and that abuse of position/power is not tolerable. Also, tell your children to not allow themselves to be alone with this teacher. Always make sure there is a witness around if possible-or carry a micro tape recorder.|`|547Ln6rNaa	She was in gym class and she should have been doing gym, not doing whatever she wanted to do. The teacher is not your problem, that's up to the school, your daughter not doing as she's told is your problem and I would make sure she knows she should be doing what the teachers ask of her. I think you're right to be considering punishing her, albeit mildly, you need to address that.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	Nope I don't think you should punish your daughter. Maybe you could speak to her about how she shouldn't have been rude (even though I don't blame her) but I wouldn't punish her.   I teach, and to be honest I see a lot of teachers who just shouldn't be teaching.     My 15yo daughter attends the same school I teach at, and she's had problems like this too. She had a sub teacher for her english class once (the woman teaching basically subs full time, and is married to a full time teacher, who was my daughters home room teacher at the time). My daughter and her friend had finished their work, and were talking, the sub started in on them, and apparently refused to believe they had finished with their work, then call my daughter a b*tch. My daughter and her friend just got up and left the room, and ended up almost being suspended, and had to buy the woman a present, which I thought was complete bull to be honest. The sub basically dislikes my daughter, because she is friends with her daughter (her 'least favourite') and has a history of having problems with students.    On the other hand though, your daughter should have participated in gym. It's a bit unfair for only her to be allowed to study for other subjects while everyone else has to play ball. My daughter hates school sport, and has gotten me to write notes saying "Julietta cannot participate in sport today, as she has her school pictures and does not want to mess up her hair"-seriously.   The teacher WAS rude though, and if the problem stops after the VP speaks to her then I would leave it. If the problem continues I would contact the principal and tell her you are unhappy with this teachers methods and the way she treats your kids.  In the meantime remind your daughter to be polite so the teacher has no reason to snap at her.  Good luck :)|`|jtiVL9PUaa	Your daughter wasn't rude. she did the right thing. Don't punish her... no one should be treated like an idiot she did the right thing.|`|R8w9mth1aa	Go to the principals office and speak with them. That teacher is not treating her right.|`|qNmUKWDCaa	I'd do a little of both. You can talk to your daughter about the incident, and about being rude. You are on her side, but let her know--kindly--that that kind of behavior hurts people too, just like what he said to her hurt her feelings. The focus probably shouldn't be her behavior though. Let her know you are proud of her for talking to the principal and choosing to do her homework in the office. Talk to her about solutions. Let her be in on what you do. Let her know you think it might be a good idea to talk to the principal as well.|`|TYjtVu2iaa	The teacher didn't handle the problem well, but I know that when I was in school, i wasn't allowed to work on other work from other classes while I was in my current class.  I got in trouble for that all the time.      I'd go to the principal's office and tell the principal that you didn't like the way the situation was handled and perhaps call the teacher in as well.
DPegPYRPaa	You go down and talk to the principal and tell him is he has a teacher employed there with anger issues you do NOT want him/her around your children.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	leave your daughter alone..it wasn't rude to speak up and speak her mind...the words were NOT rude.  YOU need to speak to the school board and your school's principal. I've never heard of a 'supply' teacher, but clearly he is a problem that needs to be taken out of school.|`|i4ceTwqLaa	Tell the principal that you want a face-to-face with the supply teacher. Then, give him a piece of your mind.    Obviously, you already realize your daughter did nothing to deserve being sent to the principal's office.     As for kids disrespecting adults: Adults need to earn respect too. Smart kids can recognize the difference between adults abusing their authority, and adults deserving of respect. That's a very good thing...remember, people like criminals play on naive children who blindly respect adults regardless of their behaviour. Your daughter is both wise and independent. Good for her.|`|1WRB7RPNaa	She did nothing wrong|`|f3n2zXG2aa	Listen to the daughter's side of this, ask her what she thinks you should do.  If she is making good grades, let her make decisions like this for now.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Well, your daughter did disobey the teacher by ignoring the teacher and not doing the appropriate subject for the time, so she should be punished for that.You cannot go outside and play kick ball when you are in history class.    I don't think it deserves major punishment...just enough to get a point across.    I would also call the school and complain about the supply teacher because he was rude and should have more respect when dealing with students instead of insulting them.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	I'm not sure what a supply teacher is. It sounds like you may be meaning SUBSTITUTE?  If this is the case then you need to file a complaint with the building principal AND the superintendent office. If they get enough complaints about a sub then the district will suddenly "forget" to call her from their sub list if they have need of one. Sounds to me like this teacher shouldn't be working around kids at all in any capacity.     The problem I can see though is that your daughter was doing work for a different class during class.  That was inappropriate.  Study hall or home is the place to do that kind of thing, not during a gym class or other class.  You wouldn't do algebra after all in the middle of history class. This is no different. Good student or not that was inappropriate, however it does not excuse the rudeness from the teacher in how she handled it.  Most teachers would have just made her sit out and given her a 0 for the day in class OR at worst a detention for doing that with the back talk, but to pester the school administration with this is just irresponsible, stupid and ridiculous that a sub (or any other teacher) can't control the kids or her classroom  situations that they are assigned.    Bottom line is, it's a poor reflection on this teacher, but your daughter isn't completely innocent either.  The teacher however is more at fault than your daughter.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Even though your daughter was right, she does need to know not to be rude to adults. Lightly punish her or have a long talk, your choice.    Stay on top of this teacher and if nothing changes, report her to the district. Good Luck.|`|nEq9pHoLaa	I don't think you should punish her. maybe talk to her a little. if she listens and next time something happens like that I think you should talk to the teacher next time he says anything cuz that's not very big. :) it won't affect her grades or anything since its only one time. maybe study a bit with your daughter at home a little more. i think that the teacher was rude so you shouldn't ground her or anything.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	I wouldn't punish your daughter, but I would talk to her about her behavior. If the teacher tells her to play then she needs to do it, gym class is not the place to study for a math test.  Give her strategies for dealing with teachers or people in charge who are making her do things she doesn't want to do.  As for the teacher I would discuss his behavior with the principal and ask what is being done about the teacher.|`|GocoTwtvaa	You should problem talk to the principle about this and tell them if their not going to fire this teacher my child will be in the office at gym or change schools.  And no you shouldn't punish your daughter studying is her thing maybe she really wanted to get a good grade instead of playing a game.  There should not be a teacher like this at her school.If my daughter was talked like that i would so go to the princeple and complain about her!    Good Luck|`|HRvPoQzKaa	It was rude for the teacher. But your daughter should study more at home and math class.    Gym class counts as a credit. You have to be there and do what the teacher has planned for. Gym class is just like any other academic class.    Talk to your daughter. Also, talk to the supply teacher and tell him that you don't approve him talking to your daughter like that.|`|3OL7vVLuaa	Well, the teacher does seem like a bit of a jerk.... but think about it if it wasn't the gym (I'm guessing that's what a "supply" teacher is). If she was in math class and the teacher said get out your math book and she just blew him off and said "I'm going to work on history now" -- the teacher couldn't really just say, "well, okay -- if you insist!" haha -- I mean -- math class is math, history is history and gym is gym. Trust me -- I would probably feel the same way she did -- but I think you sort of have to let her know -- she can't just ignore the teacher. I mean -- in life you can't just do what you want -- so when she gets out into the real world, she's got to know that at your job you can't just tell your boss -- I don't want to waste my time on these stupid reports, I'd rather do my taxes now" haha -- I would probably tell her -- just try to get through it -- the guy is obviously rude and uncaring -- but tell try to just do what she has to do in the class to get through it and look forward to the day when she's out of there!! Maybe give her some kind of reward for a certain grade in there or at least something for just making an effort to do better in there and making an effort to deal w/ a difficult person -- which is always good practice, because the world is full of difficult people, haha|`|FiUprYsvaa	I don't think she should be punished at all.     It sounds like this teacher was completely out of line and went completely overboard.     Plus, based on what she said I don't see where she said anything to him. It seems like she just stared at him and the shrugged when he continued to yell at her. I don't see that as being rude.     I am behind your daughter 100%, her math test is way more important than playing ball in gym.       But like I said I wouldn't punish her at all.   And I would file a complaint with the school.|`|fa95a107c51b407e83a3e95fe81a0e10aa	Your daughter was disrespectful and some punishment would seem to be in order, but it shouldn't be too severe.  He wasn't :nice to her either.  I would talk to the principal about this teacher.  Your daughter w:as doing math in another class.  That isn't what she should have been doing in the first place.  She was in the wrong but so was the teacher.|`|2AH1EjGAaa	Complain at the next pt meeting. The school has to take your opinion into consideration.|`|ITd8dGc8aa	lay it easy on your daughter....tell her it is wrong to talk back to a teacher...and since it was gym she should have been playing ball....not working on math...|`|LD7ifwvXaa	It might be sending the wrong signal to punish your daughter if you've had issues with this particular teacher before. While it's important for your kids to have a respect for adults, it's also important for them to eventually realize that adults can be wrong sometimes. You might just want to talk to her about being respectful, or if you do decide to punish her, keep it light. She wasn't actually in the wrong here.|`|fiJwqH8Paa	well i think your daughter should have played...but he/she  talked to her rudly...since there was many incidents with your son too DONT PUNISH YOUR DAUGHTER she stood up for what she belives in ...and thats what we all should do... GOOD FOR HER!! the teqcher is not a good influence at all ...definitley talk to someone who is above him/her.|`|WCJtZKaqaa	My opinion is that you should tell your daughter that she was wrong for being sassy to a teacher but you shouldn't punish her. You should go and have a conference with the teacher if she is there at the school.|`|Jwnk4LPgaa	No don't punish your daughter, although you should have a talk with her that she shouldn't talk to teacher like that. As for the teacher, yes you need to do something about it.    From my experience with bullies, school systems are crap they don't care what is happened they just care if they get paid. If you want to actually to be done about this you will need to do it seriously not just "please fire the teacher." My brother was bullied in school (he was actually picked up off the ground and hurled into the cement and was hurt really bad) and the school wouldn't do anything about it. I myself have also been bullied, not physically but emotionally. I was harassed and targeted by the girls and after 4 years of this going on the school still hasn't done anything about it. To get it to stop he had to take the district to court. I am not saying not to try. Bring it up at the next PTA meeting and if nothing is done talk to the principal, if it is still going on talk to the district and if STILL nothing happens then you need to take it really seriously    Hope i helped :)|`|Zrz9KHISaa	well i am also 13 and no i would not punish my daughter i would sit her down and talk to her about it and encourage her not to back talk a teacher and if the problem continues with THIS teacher then if at all possible i would look into transferring my children because this is VERY STRESSFUL on a young teen girl but if she starts to also get in trouble with other teachers i would think that it was my child not the teacher so if she starts to get in trouble with the others please don't be one of those parents who think their kids do no wrong!! well good luck,Jess|`|26991c1ba20b717681957ed25b316eacaa	Honestly, the girl is 13 years old, she's going to develop a little attitude even if she has been "perfect" all these years it happens and sometimes it is just a phase, testing authorities boundaries. I don't think that you should "punish" your daughter. I would ask her the real reason wouldn't want to go and play ball in the gym (which to me sounds like she was being immature).  She may be having trouble getting along with classmates and doesn't want to any associate any more with her classmates than required.  Most kids don't want to study extra unless there is something else going on. I admire her devotion to her studies but she really could use exercise during her school day. Maybe she is having weight issues or maybe doesn't want to change into gym clothes (if she does that at her school)  and she feels uncomfortable doing that? Maybe she needs a sports bra? There could be a multitude of reasons and personally I don't feel that she would rather study math.     Instead of punishing her, talk to her. Be honest and open and try not to get upset if there is a dilemma too big for you to "handle".  If this sort of thing happens again, I'd ask for a meeting with your school psychologist or guidance counselor there could be personal issues that she would rather tell someone other than a parent.
IVSqQQzlaa	It's very very important while breastfeeding to maintain proper nutrition and to take in enough calories each and every day for your baby's health.  Diet shakes are a bad idea, especially since you've only been breastfeeding 2 weeks.  Try to eat lots of fruits and vegetables and lean meats and avoid high fat or high sugar foods with empty calories.  Also, drink lots of water.  This will benefit both you and your baby.    Exercise in conjunction with a clean diet and the extra calories burned from breastfeeding will do the trick.  Since you just gave birth such a short time ago start with regular walks and increase the length and speed as you gain stamina.  Add in some upper body free weights when you feel up to it so that you tone and burn more calories.    And don't worry about losing weight so early.  No one expects a mother who just gave birth 2 weeks ago to be slim!  You'll be back to your pre-pregnany weight before you know it. :)    Good luck!!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I don't think slim fast is a good idea while breastfeeding.  It's not really that good for you any time.  Most of the women I've known who breast fed for a while lost quite a lot of weight naturally from just breastfeeding.  It burns calories like mad.  I'd recommend a balanced, healthy diet and give it a few months.  You may not have to try very hard.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	breast feed on demand, with no pacifiers or bottles as subs, and walk everyday for 1/2 hr to an hour.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	how about strapping your child into a stroller and hitting the pavement, the pushing of the stroller helps strengthen your abs again and helps raise your blood rate, thus making you loose weight.|`|i8NOVfm0aa	just wait! you will lose the weight trust me your body burns soooo many calories while breast feeding. DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF and dont drink slimfast because it can actually make you gain weight, if anything go on a high fiber but low card diet. serioulsy dont take slim fast that stuff is crap and doesnt work any way i weighed 190 when i had my daughter and 3 months later i was back to 130 and now she is 13 months, still nursing and i weigh 110.. 10 lbs less then my orginal pre pregnany weight. and that is with me eating everything i see lol|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Weight Watcher's has programs for nursing moms, and they are one of the few programs that show long term results.    But no dieting for at least 6 weeks -breastfeeding or not.  That's not to say you shouldn't make healthy food choices, but you should eat to hunger.    http://www.kellymom.com/newman/12more_bf...  2. A breastfeeding mother has to eat more in order to make enough milk.    Not true! Women on even very low calorie diets usually make enough milk, at least until the mother's calorie intake becomes critically low for a prolonged period of time. Generally, the baby will get what he needs. Some women worry that if they eat poorly for a few days this also will affect their milk. There is no need for concern. Such variations will not affect milk supply or quality. It is commonly said that women need to eat 500 extra calories a day in order to breastfeed. This is not true. Some women do eat more when they breastfeed, but others do not, and some even eat less, without any harm done to the mother or baby or the milk supply. The mother should eat a balanced diet dictated by her appetite. Rules about eating just make breastfeeding unnecessarily complicated.    http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/mom/mo...  Yes! Nursing mothers can lose weight safely if they follow some basic guidelines.  Six guidelines for safe dieting during lactation     Wait until your baby is two months old before dieting  It's best not to do anything consciously to lose weight until after the second month. This gives your body enough time to successfully establish a healthy milk supply that is less likely to be adversely affected if your caloric intake is restricted. Breastfeeding your baby, on average, burns 200-500 calories per day (above what you needed to maintain your pre-pregnancy weight) -- so keep in mind that even without a weight loss program you are burning extra calories.     Breastfeed without restriction  Research tells us that both more frequent breastfeeding and breastfeeding longer than six months increases maternal weight loss.     Eat at least 1500-1800 calories per day  While nursing, you should not consume less than 1500-1800 calories per day, and most women should stay at the high end of this range. Some mothers will require much more than this, but studies show that going below this number may put supply at risk.     Keep weight loss at less than 1.5 pounds per week  Most moms can safely lose up to 1.5 pounds per week or 6 pounds per month after the second month and not affect milk supply or baby's well being. One study has suggested that short-term weight loss of 2.2 pounds (1 kg) per week is not a problem (in this study, moms dieted for 11 days).     Decrease the calories gradually  A sudden drop in calories can reduce milk supply. Some moms notice this during an illness, although dehydration and/or medication use could also be a factor in reduced milk supply when mom is sick. It has been hypothesized that a sudden calorie decrease can cause mom's body to go into "starvation mode" and cut nonessential resources such as milk production.     Avoid quick-fix solutions  Liquid diets, low-carb diets, fad diets, weight loss medication, etc. are not recommended while breastfeeding.    http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/mom/mo...  According to Katherine A. Dettwyler, Ph.D., breastfeeding researcher and anthropologist, women throughout the world make ample amounts of quality milk while eating diets composed almost entirely of rice (or millet or sorghum) with a tiny amount of vegetables and occasional meat.    Are healthy eating habits recommended for mom? Absolutely! You will be healthier and feel better if you eat well. It is best for anyone to eat a variety of foods, in close to their naturally-occurring state, but this is not necessary for providing quality milk or for maintaining milk supply. Although it is certainly not recommended, a breastfeeding mother could live on a diet of junk food  mom would not thrive on that diet, but her milk would still meet her baby's needs.     What IS needed for maintaining an ample supply of milk?    The main thing needed to maintain an ample milk supply is simple --  The more often and effectively your baby nurses, the more milk you will have.    http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news.p...  He said there was a common misconception that malnutrition greatly reduced the amount of milk a mother produced when studies had shown that the amount produced depended on how often and how effective the baby sucked on the breast.    "If a mother temporarily produces less milk than the amount the infant needs, the infant will respond by sucking more vigorously, more frequently or longer at each feeding," he added.    In such situations, he urged mothers who are under-nourished to address their nutritional status rather than ignoring it.|`|jgDlkSiWaa	I would wait on losing the weight. I would focus on nursing and getting enough rest.   Remember it took you 9 months to put it on, it may take 9 to get it off.   Slim fast does not have the nutrition you need while nursing a baby.   Try eating healthy smaller meals and walking.|`|AA12243380	I'd just make sure you eat a nice, healthy, balanced diet and exercise with your baby.    Slim fast and diets like that NEVER work long-term because being healthy is a lifestyle, not a short-term diet.  If you change the way you cook, eat, and move you will lose weight.    Good luck to you.|`|AwvWBROlaa	nope. my doctor said no diet shake is 100 percent safe while breastfeeding. Its getting cold so its probably a bad idea to take her out to stroller running. try yoga while your baby naps. yoga is no joke! it takes up a lot of strength for just few minutes doing it.   good luck!!|`|1F7eYuNWaa	Please don't worry about it right now!  You must eat a healthy diet in order to give your baby healthful breast milk.  Give yourself a few months.  Nursing will naturally help - typically a nursing mother needs an extra 500 calories a day to maintain weight, so if you eat normally, barring the extra 500 (which you don't have time for anyway 'cause you are so busy) pounds will drop.  Trust me, throw away your pre-pregnant jeans right now and start over.  Even when you get back to your normal weight, your body shape will have subtle changes and your jeans won't fit right (though more structured pants may be fine).  Then you will beat yourself up about not fitting your jeans even though you look fabulous to everyone else.  Good excuse to go shopping, no?|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	is slimfast safe  ? NO   there arent enough nutrients in there for both of you.    at 2 weeks, you shouldnt be thinking about this.    i agree , just eat healthy and drinks LOTS of water. and go for a 30 minute walk daily :)    Breastfeeding burns lots of calories so you will loose naturally. not sure if you knew that !|`|nYtG6js2aa	Breastfeeding uses a lot of calories and Slimfast should only be used for supplemental nutrition in addition to your normal diet.  Woman burn most fat during breastfeeding, in addition, baby will take 500 calories from your body daily.  Loosing weight fast, with slimfast as a replacement meal = less  calories which will result in muscle loss and water weight loss and cause your metabolic rate to slow down.   Calories needed for BF = 1800 - 2200 which also accounts for physical activity.   By just eating three good meals per day and you will still loose weight without even trying.
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    They advise you to take folic acid, so from the day you fall pregnant your baby is getting the nutrients it needs.  They advise this to all woman ttc, as some people only start taking it when they have found out they are pregnant around 4/5, and the baby needs alot of good source of nutrients when its first attached to the lining of the womb.    This bleeding you experiencing could possibly be implantation bleeding, which happens around 6-10 days past ovulation.  Many woman experience it, light blood on and off over a few days with slight cramps.  If AF doesn't show up 2nd Feb then you will be able to take a pregnancy test.  Hope you get the results you want.  Best of luck xxx
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    Aww sounds like implantation bleeding :)  It's a bit too early to be testing just yet as the hcg levels will just be starting to double and rise.    The best time to test is when you miss the first day of your next period as results are more accurate and the hcg levels maybe high enough for a test to detect.  In my first pregnancy it took my body 5 weeks to produce high enough hcg levels for a test to detect, it just depends on how quick your body produces them.    Maybe when you go for your check up get them to do a urine test or a blood test? Blood tests are more accurate and detect low levels of hcg if a urine test can't pick them up. You will have the results back in a few days.    Best of luck and i hope you get the results you want  xx|`|gwuTKiNXaa	I would just wait to your annual that is only a week away. right now it is too early to test so it won't show anything|`|h5OYD8TIaa	Yes possibly!  BUT WAIT TO TAKE IT  It is more accurate when you actually miss your period.    So wait to take a test!    Mine didn't turn positive till 7 days after missed period.
547Ln6rNaa	Wait a sec - how old is the child? just as long as she isn't a tiny baby, you're safe taking your queues from her, a five or six year old can tell you if they need something, a baby will rapidly dehydrate and can become seriously ill. An older child will eat and drink when ready but should be encouraged to drink - food isn't really an issue unless the child is diabetic etc     Now, what's the cause? just a bug? sure? feeling sick too? why isn't she eating? is it to self-limit the bowel problem or does something hurt? Simple bug - appendix - poisoning - think "horses" but don't forget zebras exist.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	I have heard that apple juice works!|`|tHM6TjtIaa	Popsicles, jello, and pedialyte.

HqOkC2YHaa	Are you talking about drool or spit up?    If it's drool there's nothing you can do about it, and if it's spit up it's either acid reflux or your baby ate too much or you didn't burp the baby after feeding.     At 2 months they push any liquids that come from the body out of the body whereas when they get older they tend to just swallow it back down|`|i8NOVfm0aa	Does she spit up (throw up) or is it just saliva. if its just saliva thats normal she could be teething very early. if its spit up i would call the doctor|`|v6Ehreizaa	idk my 2-month old does it too.

Bw1h5xAcaa	It's rare for a woman's body to return to 100% normal after breastfeeding, but some genetically blessed women notice little difference.    Personally, I was a C cup before, a DDD during, and after they went to a saggy DD. VERY saggy by the time I was done nursing 3 children. And since they were still so much bigger, I started suffering from back pain. I decided to have a breast reduction. . . insurance considered it a medical necessity because of the size and the chronic pain and it was covered. Best decision I ever made. A reduction of large saggy breasts is just as good as having implants, I'm telling you. My girls look like they did when I was 15!|`|5UcdeeX8aa	They will stay like that for the most part.|`|Aj0t6ad2aa	i hope so. i m still nursing so i am interested ti see what kind of answers you get    good luck|`|yuAI037Iaa	I only breastfed my children for a few months due to different medical reasons each time.  After my first child i found my breast very empty and sagging looking.  I tell my man they look sad.  :)  I hated them but after 8 years of dealing with them i have accepted that it was a small price to pay for my 4 beautiful children.  Mine have never looked the way they did before i was pregnant.  I have talked to several doctors about them who have all said the same thing, the only thing that will fix them is implants and that wouldn't be me so i refuse.  Both of my sisters have the same problems as me.  They may come back, but chances are they wont.  On the up side if you have another baby you will have 9 months of great breasts only to be gone again after you stop breast feeding.  One of the few sacrifices of being a woman.    to anyone who reads:  Not every woman who breast feeds has this problem.  Don't let it stop you from breastfeeding.  My sister didn't breast feed and hers did the same thing.
xxfVwFhPaa	That's a punishment that differs from state to state, and sometimes varies by counties within a state as well.

It's hard to say what's going on with your body without knowing what your cycles are like normally.

HclKftzAaa	it was an attention grabber. made me lol.    Most likely a hormone imbalance. Probably nothing to worry about. Many women will have irregularities at some point in their lives.

Lnt4u4q6aa	dont let her pressure you...is my first bit of advice.     she, being a mother should understand that if you are still breastfeeding, the baby cant stay away from you !    probably in another month or two he may be using asippy cup enough to stop nursing.....but try to keep it between you and the baby's father.    Can your x visit at your place with the baby for a few hours? that way when he needs to eat, you can feed him....|`|QOvUS6xVaa	i would wait until he is not breastfeeding anymore, this is not a situation where he has to be left so they can wait|`|i8NOVfm0aa	i dont know how things are between you and your babies father, but maybe you could just stick around. Does he want him to stay over night because that is out of the question. and your son is probally nursing like 5-9 times a day and if you cant get him to take a bottle then its out of the question you cant just put him on formula when he is gone because he wont take it any way...|`|y56BkEcMaa	well if he wont take a bottle than there gonna have to wait untill he can, tell them too bad. You have to do whats best for him, not what they want you to do.|`|D8x0w6FMaa	I disagree with the best answer you picked last time around 3 times a week for 2 hours at a time at your house and no overnights until age 2 or 3?! That's a little outrageous. My step-daughter wasn't breastfed but we started having her overnight at 14 months old. Before that we had her every tuesday and thursday 8am-9pm. Since you are breastfeeding it's a little different. I would say once your son starts taking a bottle well then there is no problem with him staying the night. It is better for him to get used to it when he is young and doesn't know the difference then to go from seeing his dad for only 6 hours a week to staying over for the weekend. You have to remember you are the one with the reluctance not your son. Sometimes you just have to do things. It was the same way with my fiance's ex she had no problem with him having her just didn't want her to stay the night. I think every parent is like that when their baby stays the night away at a new place for the first, second, and sometimes even third time. I know when my son stayed with his Grandma for the first time I was freaking out. What if she didn't hear him cry or couldn't get him back to sleep when he woke up just what IF! Maybe you can start off slow. The first time just from say 6pm to noon the next day then after you do that for a bit then go to 6pm to 6pm or something different then try two nights or whatever you want. We would have totally agreed to do this with my stepdaughters mom but she is the my way or no way type. In the end in came back to bite her because not only did she have to let her stay it was for the whole weekend and it started on a Halloween. She had no time to prepare or get herself ready at all. Court was Tuesday she didn't show found out Wednesday night about the new visitation and Friday afternoon we got her. If she would have compromised things would have been better for her. But that is just my experience. As for breastfeeding I breastfed and sometimes you just have to offer the bottle and eventually if that is the only choice they will take it. Good luck
bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Your dad will need to talk to his insurance co. when you're about 5-6 months or so and let them know about needing to put the baby on the insurance.   That is if you're under 18. If you're over 18 you will need your own and add the baby onto that.|`|aES89pvwaa	See if u qualify for medicaid
lTkYWiy5aa	It depends what is causing the irregularity. Some people are just irregular, which means it might take longer to get pregnant. Some people have medical conditions that cause them to have irregular periods, which means they have a lot of difficulty getting pregnant.

My friends have done it and it's perfectly filling and hassle free|`|Ipw8hlEuaa	bagels,muffins, maybe poptarts will be ok  pizza is cheap with few people there|`|Tx8JHmDvaa	french toast and bacon is really really good for breakfast if you're willing to make it.|`|ZRsk0cAIaa	it's good you're planning ahead. what i've found is that if there is an am pick up time, say 10am the girls generally do not bother eating. they just wake minutes before their rides arrive and stumble to the car all groggy skipping anything i've set out for them. needless to say i no longer "go all out". your ideas are good. keep it simple and buy things that your family can enjoy for the week if they don't get eaten that morning. Have fun!|`|66jX06Onaa	The girls that would come over here for sleepovers loved having homemade pancakes with milk to drink and cut up apples.     Bagels, muffins, juice and milk are fine though! Figure mini muffins and mini bagels though - they will get a kick out of the mini stuff!|`|bhf03ppxaa	make pancakes for breakfast or get some toaster strudels. for dinner order a pizza  EDIT: it don't see ware it says "no pizza"
9ydJQr5zaa	That's probably the problem, maybe if you would spank this situation would not happen. Anyways, try grounding her, taking things away is not a good punishment, neither is grounding. Since the only thing they are learning is how to do it again and how the parent is not going to do anything else. Taking things away may be a bit of trouble sometimes, since you never know how attach a child may be to a certain object, not a good idea. The best thing to do in your case and the not believing is to ground. By the way if one of your reasons for not spanking is because you consider it abuse (Not saying you do). Spanking is not abuse what so ever. Spanking may only become abuse if the parent goes too far and leaves bruises or does it repeatedly without a reason, or the reason is not something that spanking can be used for. Other than that spanking is done for discipline, teaching the child to respect the parent and to not do it again. As long as you explain and tell the child how much you love her.|`|GfCjZJbXaa	You sound like you did a great thing.She obviously needs a punishment.I would say talk to her and explain why you are grounding her for however long you like.Id give about 2 weeks.Tell her she will have more chores and must go to sleep earlier.Good luck|`|6QEiuz7Naa	Take the cellphone away, and don't let her see that freako anymore!  (:|`|LQQAQDkIaa	Take the cell phone away from her. Tell her you will consider returning it when her psycho friend apologizes to you.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Take away her cell phone and ground her for a long long time. And do not allow her to go to the movies with her friends alone anymore until she is 15 because that is a trust she has to earn, it is not a privilege. And a cell phone is also a privlidge and if she let her friend abuse it by speaking to you that way, well, she obviously can't handle it.|`|rRceaE4Maa	Okayyyy...well Hi! I'm 14, but would never ever consider doing anything like that,  butI know ppl who would! So, you have to think, what was she really doing! And yea, most ppl think there children are sweet, perfect angels, and they couldn't imagine them doing anything like that ( by that I mean with a boy....), but if she is already kissing her boyfriend in front of you...well....idk! Take her phone away...ground her....and no more little movie dates till she is older! 13 is a little young, not that I'm criticizing your judgement. Good luck and Hope I helped!!!|`|bmoCpcdraa	well i let my children date or go out at age 18 now if you allow her to be unsupervised at 13 you should be a grandparent soon yes she can do lots with no supervission i bet you were a teenager once ground her dont be her friend be a parent|`|5EOLbVzQaa	since you wont do the obvious your wasting your time cause she already knows she will do what she wants!      your daughter doesnt do chores either! no wonder you cant control her... she is a spoilt brat!|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Take away the cell phone, MP3 or what ever she spends with. Take away the car keys and refuse to drive her anywhere until she shapes up.|`|AA12243380	I'd ground her.    That is completely unacceptable for her to:    A:  Disobey you  B: Kiss her boyfriend in front of you, totally disrespectful for a 13 year old child to do!  C:  NOT apologize for the psycho b- comment.  Totally rude and inappropriate.  D:  Slam the door  E:  Lie to you... if she hadn't wanted to go she wouldn't have gone.  That's bullcrap.  She should have called you from her phone and told you to pick her up right away if her friends were abandoning her like that.  F:  Be so damn disrespectful to you!!!!!!!!    OMG!    I'm angry on your behalf mom!  I think that she needs to be grounded for 2 weeks with no phone, internet, or other privileges that she loves and I think that she needs to earn back the privilege of going out with friends through proving that she is mature and not a "follower" because if she doesn't even have the guts to stand up to her friends and do the right thing then she obviously isn't responsible enough to be trusted.    I am a hardass I guess.  lol    Man, I am soooooooooooooooooo not looking forward to the teenage years.  Noooooo!|`|nfzQkvqraa	I have no idea how I would react to that as a parent.  I can say that I did similar things to my parents as a young teen, and I turned out fine.  It is very disrespectful.  I'm not sure what would make me more angry.  Her letting someone else answer her phone and call you names, or her leaving where she was supposed to be.      I guess I would probably ground her from the group that was with her that evening.  I would sit down and explain to her how it made you feel.  I would probably ban movies for a bit and tell her that she had to earn your trust back.  Saying all that, (and not that I'm in any way defending her actions)  I still remember how hard it was to deal  with peer pressure.  Being a teenager can be really difficult.  I think it has something to do with the chemicals in their brains going crazy.  Try to put yourself in her shoes, and then figure out a way to put her in yours so that you can understand each other better.  Good luck!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Cell Phone would be gone and she would be grounded.|`|tHM6TjtIaa	Talk with her, set guides lines, and consequences. Do not tolerate this behavior and do not allow it to slide. Explain that what she did was irresponsible and is not allowed, she has a cell phone and is perfectly capable of calling you to inform you of any changes in plans.     I would take her cell phone away for one week along with her privileges of going out, for that week I would work on communicating with her. Making sure she is educated in situations with boys as you said she "kissed her boyfriend goodnight" which for me would not be acceptable for a 13 year old girl to be doing. However every parent has different expectations. I would make sure she is able to protect herself and make responsible decisions because if you are allowing her to be alone with boys she needs to know what to do if something goes to far that she is not comfortable with.     Each child is so different and the levels of discipline needed vary so I really think the biggest key is communicating with her and following through with your punishments.|`|1seJ59WVaa	Hello,  I think you should keep her on close watch, honestly it isn't her fault her friend disrespected you, maybe not let her hang out with him anymore because there is a chance she might pick up on that behavior.   I believe her when she says she didn't have anything to do with the mall, she is 13 and has a new boyfriend and will most likely do whatever she wants her to do ( its very sad, but veryyy true)  If this was the boyfriend who disrespected you, you really need to take control and reevaluate their relationship, like i said before, she will pick up on that attitude.  Good Luck, its hard raising a teenager, just wait until shes 16 and can drive herself anywhere!!|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	No dates - no cell phone for two weeks.  If you won't spank her, then take away her privileges - but don't back down.  Two weeks with no dates and no cell phone.  Period.|`|gkN6CmUHaa	take away privalliges example tv or mobile|`|omqS0q5Naa	If that was my daughter she wouldn't be going anywhere for a while.Also who ever she told you dragged her down there she wouldn't be allowed around them for a while not because they did but because she said they did.|`|o503YPrqaa	Ask her why her boyfriend or friend answered her phone, Tell her that you would take her and her friends to the mall if they wanted to during the day, but they didn't have to be such jerks about it, I dont like taking phones away because of emergencies... its tough. maybe talking to her about it. And if her friends are forcing her to do things.. maybe she needs new friends.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	I would ground her and take away things like computer use and allowance. I would also consider taking away her cell phone.   Explain to her that what she did was really serious. Not only did she not meet you when she said she would, left the designated meeting place, was walking around the streets at 11pm, one of her friends was incredibly rude to you, but she also broke you trust. Now you can't trust her to go places with her friends.   It doesn't matter if she was "dragged into it". Tell her that if she's old enough to date, to go out with her friends, and to see movies at night, then she's old enough to control and be responsible for her own actions, no matter what her friends say.  It doesn't sound like she has very nice friends.  Whatever you choose as a punishment, say being grounded, with no computer or cell phonprivilegeses for 3 weeks, then STICK TO IT. Even if she acts like a perfect angel. She needs to know that you are the boss, and that being allowed out with friends means she has to be responsible.     Good luck|`|H1ubEdiTaa	blah,blah,blah, stop trying to be a friend, you know what you need to do. Be the parent set rules and enforce those rules. if your rules are broken there are consequences.
AA11763588	Wait a few days and take another test.    Keep in mind that stress can delay a period. So can a change in diet and weight loss or gain.|`|qiYjhM4Gaa	it doesn't sound like you're pregnant it's probably your body changing.. i've had my period for quite some time now and it's still not normal, just recently i went thru a pregnancy scare cuz my periods were usually 28 days (4 weeks) and the last 2 months they've been 5 weeks for some odd reason. it can be caused my alot of different things so i wouldn't sweat it too much :)|`|eEzgtCKbaa	First of all, go to a clinic and get tested for STD's and/or infections.  You might not be pregnant, but you could have gotten something from your partner.      Second, if you have any respect for your own body and personal health don't ever have unprotected sex again unless you're in a very serious relationship and trying to get pregnant.  (Not to mention know your partner is clean)  That was extremely irresponsible and indicates you are too immature to be sexually active.

Wjdpm4xNaa	Usually from Iron in the diet.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	If the baby is formula-fed, it's from the iron.  I'm not sure about breast-fed babies.|`|lHyEpL9Eaa	Yes, mostly in newborns. It depends on what you fed the child.|`|y56BkEcMaa	Green poop can be a sign of a stomach bug, bug more times than not, its diet|`|i8NOVfm0aa	depending on how old they are and how they are fed (formula, or breast milk. solid food) sometimes its normal.|`|jcPqZhQ7aa	If you are breastfeeding your baby, breast-milk has two parts. Initially your breast milk is thin and watery which contains vitamins and carbohydrates and other minerals essential for your baby and the second part is the hind milk which is thick and rich in fats. If baby drinks only the fore-milk which happens if your producing more milk than your baby drinks, then your baby must be getting full with the fore milk and that causes the green stools. Nothing to panic.    With formula fed babies it is because of the iron and the poop will always be green if fed formula with iron.    hope this helps.|`|hnWGdPy0aa	it depends on what u eat

Bu6eSZSlaa	It's call Tongue Thrusting and is as normal as normal goes. I started to feed my 5 mth old cereal with a spoon a few days ago & she did the same thing. The reason they do it is because they are so used to sucking bottle/boob that they are unfamiliar with a spoon. No worries as time goes by she'll master the spoon feeding|`|68c6B8dRaa	"Signs that indicate baby is developmentally ready for solids include:    Baby can sit up well without support.  Baby has lost the tongue-thrust reflex and does not automatically push solids out of his mouth with his tongue.  Baby is ready and willing to chew.  Baby is developing a pincer grasp, where he picks up food or other objects between thumb and forefinger. Using the fingers and scraping the food into the palm of the hand (palmar grasp) does not substitute for pincer grasp development.  Baby is eager to participate in mealtime and may try to grab food and put it in his mouth."    http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	yea they do that|`|AwvWBROlaa	it is VERY normal. They are use to sucking more than eating. is she pushing the food out with her tongue? it is normal and she will eventually grow out of it on her own.|`|wKJrZhj3aa	It is normal and healthy for this reflex action to take place. Your baby has a natural response to push out anything that comes near her mouth. I think its a safety thing. As she get used to eating from the spoon more often it will start to go away. My daughter gets spoon fed and still eats from a bottle as well. This reflex has gotten better, but it is still there. Just give it some time. :) If you are still a bit worried, just ask your pediatrician. :)|`|i8NOVfm0aa	show her how to eat  have your wife feed you and just open your mouth and show your baby and make it seem fun... nothing is wrong with her. some babies are not ready for baby food until they are over a year. if she is growing good and not losing weight she is fine!|`|1F7eYuNWaa	Yes, this is a normal reflex that every baby does.  She is not ready.  When the reflex goes away, she is ready.  Should be any day now.  Be patient.
q6WDfSNdaa	It is normal for a baby to push her tongue out. If you leave the spoon in her mouth for a few seconds she naturally might suck on it a little and the food goes down the hatch! It worked with my 7 month old, otherwise waiting another couple of weeks might be the answer.|`|aYF1RkEqaa	This is a totally normal reflex action.  Her mouth is trained that whenever it feels something on the lips, to get ready to suck on it, so the tongue starts to get into position to suck.  Some parents, especially those with their first baby, are eager to feed their new baby.  However, babies really do get all the nutrition that they need from their formula or breastmilk.  Formula or breastmilk should be their main source of nutrition (and can be the only source) until they are a year old.  Any food that you give your daughter until a year old is just for practice and to slowly introduce her to tastes and textures.  If her tongue reflex is still present, feedings are just going to be frustrating for all of you, so I would just try every now and then until her reflex goes away - probably within the next month or so.  My daughter didn't start feeding properly until about 8 or 9 months.

0JBXD87uaa	For one thing, the hymen does not reveal weather or not she has had sex. The hymen can be broken with heavy activity, or even simple sports like bike riding. Some girls are even born without hymens.    Just make sure she knows what to do and say if someone asks her for sex. You can only do so much.|`|YU471WSsaa	why worry ur head..if ur daughter is part of you..let her be....and do what ur grand mothers did to show she was a virgin,use the piegon egg.on her wedding night....and if u ask me how i know i learnt it from an egyptian....and its not nice to alienate your children from your self... a parent is there to protect and advise..and forgive..never to threat or be vendictive..|`|AA11589437	If you are indeed a parent, and not a preoccupied husband-to-be, what you should think to ease your mind in all aspects, virginity is teh least among them, is this:  you have raised your children the best you can, giving them your values the best you could. That's all a parent can do for their kids. All you can do now is trust your kids and realise that they will make their own choices, live with the consequences, but if they make different choices than what you want them to it is their own right. At some point people form their own personalities.  Oh, and another thing: if you are so desperate and worried about something like that, it is very likely that what you fear will come true. Because you will have brought about the opposite result by oppressing your child. Cool down!|`|KGppArcfaa	Theres no way to tell for sure if a girl is a virgin. As previously stated the hymen can be broken easily from bike riding, horse back riding etc.    How about you treat your daughter with respect and believe her and not threaten to disown her?    You should love your child unconditionally. How do you think she feels with you saying these things to her? Why dont you believe in your own daughters morals?|`|AA10898750	listen im not a doctor but go to web md and search hymen this thin skin can and does break all the time from gymnastic activities and horse back riding and so on its fragile and lots of women and girls are taught by their mothers how to fake the hymen the purity of your daughter is in her basic character as a person and not a piece of skin if you have done your part to tell her the right way to follow her religion and to respect herself then she will be pure till marriage but children dont react to threats well it makes them rebel and become decietful so be kind to your children they are your blood and look up some info and ask a good doctor I'm sure there are religious doctors at the local hospital of each religion good luck|`|vI0WnAiOaa	get over yourself and learn to trust your daughter instead of being an over protective and controlling person. also dont condem the non muslim boys as the muslim boys probably want to do the same thing. does a muslim boy have to be a virgin to when marring or is it just a girl thing and if so that is so much double standards.   you cannot disown a child just cause they do something wrong - its called unconditional love for children no matter what.|`|LQ04emc3aa	kid, we all know muslims care about there virginities,   but seriously  lay off, give her some trust man|`|rcf96hb9aa	Technically, there is no way for a girl's virginity to be checked. Some girls are born without hymens, so there is no way! If you ask me, you are invading your daughter's privacy and loosing her trust. IT should be her decision whether or not to have sex, and by threatening her, she probably wants to more now (take it from another teenager!).|`|9ttS7helaa	Im not sure if theres a way to find out if shes a virgin im pretty sure that since shes 16 she really wouldnt do anything to cover so you can still go to a gynocologist and ask them to check her but, i dont recomend that you leave her in the streats with "no mother" becasue she betrayed you, i understand that shes not allowed to have sex but that shouldnt mean that she could end up motherless. every 16 year old makes mistakes and NEEDS theyr parents to keep them from making more mistakes. maybe you should tell her that she can trust you with the truth and let her know that its very wrong to have sex before marrige but dont push her away from you by threating her that she would be able to lose you, because she needs you, especially at her age.|`|g2MKwVCWaa	I think it depends a lot on parents the way they raise and educate their children about their culture and the awareness of their religion since their childhood.     Secondly its the environment to blame for rights and wrongs where the child grows and gets education. For example if your daughter is properly educated and now she is in the class room of her college and next to her a boy and a girl are kissing and having fun, its going to affect her willingly or unwillingly.     Finally the sign of  virgin or not does not mean that its the result of having sex, it may happen by having exercise, running, riding and cycling.    A question like this to post in details is also not proper because she is your daughter, so please respect your family values and do not hurt your family members confidence like this.
Zrz9KHISaa	well every body at my old school i think hated me then i switched schools and found out it wasn't me it was them because at my new school i am rather popular so every thing will be ok i promise|`|Jwnk4LPgaa	It's the same with me at my school. Not because i am annoying but because i am fat. I have been overweight all my all my life. Another reason is the friends i chose. When i was in the 3rd grade, Some girls came to me and started being my friend. If i would have known them better i would have told the brats so go away but i was so desperate for a friend that i started haning out with them. The only way i can describe the friends i chose are juvenile deliquents. I wasnt as bad as them, but people thought i was because i hung out with people like that. Over a time period of 3 years i was bullied by these girls but like i said i was so desperate for i friend i just let it happen. Then finally i got tired of it and stopped haning out with then entirly. Even though i stopped haning out with them or talking to them or anything people still though i was like them, and i was completly friendless for 2 years. I was completly misserable, i always walked around sulking and lonley, I was never out of my house and i was lonley. I didnt go to sporting events because i didnt have any friends who knew when the games were, i never went outside because i had no reason to. I wasn't the kind of person anyone would want to be friends with. Then this year a girl moved into my town and i now have a best friend. She doesn't care how i was before just how i am now and i really respect her for that. I am smilieng a lot more now and people are not finding it so bad to be around me.    I AM NOT telling this story  to make people feel bad for me, I am telling it hopefully that people will learn from it and choose good friends. Everyone deserves a friend.    If you are wondering whatever happened to my old "friends", one of them has been to jail twice, one of them has been once, and the other two are pretty much gauranteed to be mothers before they graduate from high school.|`|uo8xxuACaa	You are not anoying at all.maybe you do not know how to fiend a friend.
PZH2zBzYaa	a condom is 100% blocks the sperm|`|aJLx0nhNaa	A condom *is* birth control, though notoriously unreliable.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Most condoms are not put on correctly.   You should have another form of birth control if you have sex.  You are not ready for kids.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Condoms are not 100% effective at preventing pregnancy and neither is birth control.  Your safest bet if you are trying not to get pregnant is to use birth control AND condoms AND spermicide.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	gee there is a spell check ya know...anyhow you should be on birth control and using condoms. Birth control is more effective and you should be worried about std's as well, not just pregnancy.|`|2esGKO2Caa	Condoms break they are not 100% fool proof if you are going to have sex and are able to take the pill it is still the most effective.|`|fPJTZwoUaa	as long as it fits doesnt come off  doesnt break is not out of date and   doesnt have any little holes in it - then it should be better than nothing at all|`|xde0uuuBaa	yeah just make sure the condom is on properly and doesn't break.|`|FuqdMHfMaa	yes.  but condoms tend to break and then you are screwed, because your originally protected sex has all of a sudden become unprotected.|`|XUwtAWzkaa	Morning after pills, then you don't have to worry about either.|`|LsE1RS0vaa	condoms are a form of birth control. it's 99.9% effective if used right|`|xfZWmPJPaa	play a little safer, use a condom plus get him to pull out..just to make sure! lol   :)|`|Nytn8HB8aa	Question: Can you have sex without any birth control except the use of a condom and not get pregnant?    Answer: Condoms, on their best day, are still faulty. You can expect about a 95-98% success rate per condom use, if a condom is used correctly.     However, if the production of the condom was poor, the sizing isn't correct, or perhaps he's just a little too rough and the condom breaks, that success rate will go down.     So yeah, condoms will sure as heck help, but it's never going to be 100%|`|lz4nK3ibaa	You need to clarify what you mean by birth control. A condom IS a form of birth control and there are many other different methods of birth control. I'm assuming you mean the pill?     I'm on medication and this interferes with the chemicals active in the birth control pill. My only reliable choice is to use a condom and over years of being sexually active I've never been pregnant.     Condoms are roughly 85% accurate assuming you use them according to the directions. This reliability can also be increased if using spermicide along with them. But its important to note NO birth control is 100% accurate and the pill DOES NOT prevent STD's like HIV, or Chlamydia.      If you're not sure about all this sorta stuff you should really be consulting a doctor, if you find a good one, they'll be happy to take you through it all.|`|BzQp8qUXaa	just dont use the condoms from the 99 cents store..... if you do use 4 cuz thats how i was born.     :D|`|94kNwMPdaa	first of all you cant even spell. let alone should you be having sex    second of all condoms are birth control    third of all they are only around 80-90% effective.    fourth of all no matter how many types of birth control you use you can still get pregnant. the only 100% effective way not to get pregnant is ABSTINENCE!!!|`|3WyKt2bYaa	yeah, JUST make sure that the condom doesnt break !, and also dont be dumb and use 2 condoms, that thing doesnt work, what will happen is that the rubbers witll ruv against each other and break faster or easly, just go for a good trusted brand, not a cheap one|`|0vFLqqxSaa	well I guess since condoms has been around around much longer than other types of birth control so I guess it works|`|6pToGVZNaa	a condom is very reliable it his i think around 90-97% reliable. it all depends if you put it on right|`|euTbzGO9aa	A condom can never guarantee 100% protection against pregnancy or STDs. Some condoms do not have or may contain low levels of spermicide. They might bust or tear. It is just a preventative measure.|`|BaDm2DsPaa	if the condom does not break then the missus should not get pregnant... just don't store the condom in you wallet or pocket or it will heat up and fall apart
AA11763588	You ovulate 10 - 14 days from the day you start your period. Sperm can hang out waiting on an egg for 72 hours.    So based on that, you would have ovulated between 1/22 - 1/26. You have a chance to be pregnant.    I'd wait till your period is late, and take it the next morning, with your first pee.    Good luck.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Of course it's possible. . .     Wait until you miss your next period to get the most accurate result and the best chance at getting a positive if you are pregnant. It's definitely too early now.|`|TYjtVu2iaa	wait until your next period is due, then test.|`|5q9xcYAuaa	Yes. With a normal 28 day cycle the 26th would be around the time you would ovulate so either date could add up to be the day you conceived. Wait until your next period would be due, most HPT won't show until after you've actually missed your period :) Good luck!|`|rC0rjufaaa	yes u might have cuz after ur period in 10 to 12 days u could get pregnant and also befor it in 10 to 12 days. but if u have sex after its finished in a week u wont. or in 3 to 4 days. so i think u might have. and u should go test as soon as u can. i hope i helped.|`|135595fc2caf33898d4407d277fc9683aa	too soon to tell.  wait until you are supposed to have it and then test

Now, I suggest you go to your doctor immediately. Since there is Doctor-Patient confidentiality, he isn't allowed to tell your parents if you don't want him to. Ask if he can interpret what is going on with you, and what he can do to help you.   As for your parents, I suggest you tell them now before anything gets any worse or surprising. If you were to tell them that you "might be pregnant," the only thing they can be mad at you about is you fooling around with that guy, and they should get over that. Now, if you tell them after you find out you're pregnant, they would be furious that first, you didn't ask for there help, you fooled around with the guy, and you not telling them in the first place. They won't hate you, they'll just be stressed for awhile.   You're in a very delicate situation, where a lot of people can be hurt, but at the same time can be more connected. I doubt that you are actually pregnant, but the things I posted above are for the safety of yourself. So, please, trust me on that.|`|kUm4fIbIaa	He would have to have it in when he was done. I would say you are NOT pregnant and not to stress b/c that would make you late. Just take a few deep breathes and relax you should be just fine.|`|OWuQPq2zaa	There is a very slim chance you are pregnant by the sounds of what yous done. You could be experiencing your period being late because you are stressing about it and worrying about it coming late. Also you need to ask yourself does your period always come on time? The pains too can be a sign that your period is coming or the bleeding may be an irregular period which some girls go through in their lifes. You are a young girl too and sometimes in life girls cycles may change a little because of their bodies changing. If you are to take a pregnancy test then I would advice you to wait at least 5 days until your period is late so the test can pick up the most HCG in your urine. If you are still worried talk to your mum and go to the doctors to find a solution to your problem. Good luck!

PpU08olJaa	You will still have the baby either way, but I personally believe that it is crucial that all women labor with a doula. I hired one for the last half of my pregnancy and it has been amazing. I can call her and ask her anything with 100% comfort and shes going to the birth with my husband and I to make sure I am comfortable and that everything runs smoothly. I've been kind of upset the past week, worried about the end being in sight, and she has called me everyday to make sure I am alright.  Basically, my experience is similar for many women who hire doulas, that is the standard of care. Not only is it great laboring support, but your rates for c-section, episiotomy, forceps/vaccum, and pitocin go WAY down...they are cut in half!     You can find a doula who works for free or on a sliding scale, which is what we did since we are experiencing some financial trouble. Usually their fee ranges from $200-$700 for your whole pregnancy. Meaning they have two prenatal appointments where they come to your house, they are with you when you start labor, you can all them ANYTIME day or night, they will go with you to your OB apts, and they come once or twice after the baby is born to make sure everything is sound.     Please trust me that it is a worthwhile investment, my doula has been awesome!     Good luck with the birth, you'll do AMAZING!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	You don't have to have another person there- it is really just for support.  It may be hard for you to go through it alone, but not impossible.  If you have a family member that you are close to ask them to be there with you, but if there isn't a close family member then it will be ok to not have anyone there.  The doctors and nurses will be there to support you and help you.    Good luck!|`|9P26sacKaa	Vitally important?  No, it's not.  However, numerous studies have shown that having a support person present (even in addition to your husband, if he were going to be there), makes a real difference in outcomes, both physically and emotionally.  C-section rates are lowered by 50% by having a doula present.  Medication isn't needed as much, bonding between mom and baby is better, breastfeeding goes better (if you're breastfeeding), labor is shorter, and complicated deliveries are less likely.  Not to mention that you'll feel better about your birth.    I highly recommend you look into Operation Special Delivery.  This is a service offered free of charge to military families who have financial need and for whom the husband is away on deployment around the time of the due date.  A doula is provided free of charge.  If you can afford to hire a doula without using the free service, it's encouraged that you do that instead of going with the free one.    If you did have a friend or family member who could go with you as a support person, this would be helpful as well.    Here is a list of links on doulas and OSD.  You can probably find information on the benefits of having a doula (labor coach) with you on these pages.  OSD might work out perfectly for you.  I hope it does!  http://www.operationspecialdelivery.com/  http://www.cappa.net/  http://www.dona.org/|`|5UcdeeX8aa	No you don't have to have one, but if you really want someone to be there with you then consider hiring a doula.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	It's not vitally important but it's very nice to have.  My parents hung out with me while my hubby was at work before I got to the pushing stage and it was nice to have them for that and then my husband through the pushing part (although he abandoned me for a few minutes when I was scared to push because  though I was going to  2)).    You can tell your doctor your situation and if you're okay with being induced you can schedule that.    You're probably going to need at least someone that can take you to the hospital and take you home.|`|KMtd5gr0aa	Well no U dont have to. My husband was always in there but he didnt coach me LOL! The nurses always ended up doing.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	well you have 3 months to plan it...how close to your due date is your husband coming home? i ask because if its like a week or so maybe they will induce you so he can be at the birth.....same with your family.... if its close enough to your due date ask your docs explain to them your husband is home for x amount of time,is it possible?..........also check and see if there are any doulas in your area....they are very supportive and will be a big help thru labor.....and you could depend on her to be there.....goodluck to you. to answer your ?..no you dont HAVE to have one but it would help having someone to be ther to support you thru this time.....

ggfE4rlvaa	Well, as a woman who's currently dealing with a deadbeat and trying to move out of state, I'll be honest with you here. I'm in MN so the laws are different mind you. If you're involved with the child, (or at least trying to be) and are paying child support w/o being told by the state to, then you can file for custody, and she would not be allowed to move as it would interfere with your custody rights. She has to have good reasoning as to why you're an unfit father, and keeping your child from you out of spite, isn't good reasoning. Just do all that you can to be a good father, and the state will see that and hopefully give you custody, if not full at least partial. Even if you have only visitation she can't move away. I'm glad to hear there are guys out there who are genuinely trying to take care of their children on more than just a financial aspect. Best of luck to you and your court battle, that little girl needs her daddy! If you have any conversations with her mother, try and record them, or get a witness to verify that she has no good reasoning for keeping the child from you. In the end the child will resent her anyways for keeping you from her, that may not happen for another 15 years, but it will. So, just do everything by the book as much as you can, and continue trying to see her and support her!|`|01Mu3wUeaa	You need to go to court ASAP.Like...tomorrow if you can.    Go to court and file for joint/shared custody.It depends on the situation and state but she might not be allowed to take the little girl away to another state.    Right now, she can so get the ball rolling on this.    Good luck.|`|g6wcZI1Laa	Go ahead and contact your DSS (department of social services) you do have the right to visit your child if she does move to FL. however, more than likely you will have to travel to see her until she gets to the age of being able to travel without an adult. when she reaches the age of 16 - she will be able to make the decision on which parent she prefers to live with. Hope it helps.|`|vnJG8UYJaa	It is hard to say whether the courts would allow you to restrict her moving to Florida if she can come up with a good reason to move.  Hopefully, you have been full involved with the baby since her birth and you are not just jumping in because you are splitting with the gf.  You can expect to get some visitation during the week and every other weekend and some time in the summer.    My advice to you is remember that you have to put the babies needs first in this situation and not make her a pawn in a disagreement with your ex.  Consult a lawyer to protect the babies rights, the right to have a loving father in her life and the right to financial support from both of you.  I would assume that you have already had DNA testing done to prove that she is yours and your name is on the birth certificate.  These things will help you to get a court hearing quicker.  I would ask the attorney about the possibility of getting a court order that would prevent her from moving until you have the court hearing for visitation.    Good luck.|`|0td65n04aa	You need to get a lawyer and file for joint custody right away.  That may allow you to block her move out of state.  I don't know what state you are in, but in PA you can block her move through the court unless she can prove that it would cause great hardship to stay in the same state.  I think there are similar laws in other states.  As far as the child support, that is usually a separate case and independent of custody.  You can file for custody even if she hasn't sued you for child support.  You definitely need to find a lawyer right away though.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	In most states, if she has just cause as to why she is moving to Florida...better environment and ability to care for the child...she can move, but of course if they see it's just out of spite they can deny/delay it. (check your state laws on moving a child out of state)    File for custody/visitation whatever your choie will be...if u can afford it...get a lawyer and take action so u have the law on your side.|`|rk2oiTsgaa	i THINK THAT WELL THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO, A SOLUTION WOULD BE TO MOVE THE BABY IN WITH YOU BUT I DOUBT THET'LL GIVE YOU CUSTODY UNLESS THE MOMS NOT COMING THROUGH ALL THE WAY LIKE SHE'S SUPPOSED 2
EMPVvJcDaa	I have worked in Childcare for a few years now and have potty trained many children. The main trick to it is consistency and praise. You will want to take him to the bathroom about every 45 minutes or so and have him sit there for a couple of minutes. I learned that if you sit in there with the child and encourage them then they are more willing to go. Once the child does you should praise him. Get super excited and tell him how proud you are of him.      You could also try a sticker chart or buy his favorite character of underwear. You could hang these underwear on the wall in the bathroom or just show them to him and tell him he can pick a pair after he is dry for a certian amount of time.    Another thing that you could do is put a pair of underwear on the inside of his diaper or pull up. When he has an accident he can feel the wetness and it will make him uncomfortable.     Good Luck and keep your head up,  just remember that it takes time!!!!|`|wCJdbMakaa	give him a prize when he goes in the pot.  (it worked with my parents)|`|euTbzGO9aa	I used to work in childcare...way too many kids to pottytrain! The main thing is consistency. Taking him about every 30min. until he kinda gets the swing of things. Also, keep in mind that boys do take longer to potty train. So he may not quite pick it up until closer to 2 1/2 yrs. I know that rewarding children for that is divided 50/50. I personally think it is an effective measure. They know if they do it right, they will be rewarded (something little like 1 M&M or piece of candy) or something they don't get a whole lot of.|`|1XAUxQlDaa	Now, I know that girls and boys are different to potty train but this might help a little. I potty trained my daughter in a week. Last week to be exact and she's out of diapers/pull ups. And goes on a big potty(toilet) now.    What I did was the first time I put her on the potty we sat there until she went. i would keep her in the bathroom. I would let her get up and walk a little and then sit down again until she went. Then when she went, I would give her a treat. The 2nd time around was much easier. She kind of knew what we were going to do. And I was asking her about every 15 to 30 mins. You don't want to wait too long cause then he'll go in the diaper. Anyway, the 2nd time we did the same thing. She kinda knew what we were doing but it still took time. By the 3rd and 4th time she knew what we were doing and made herself go potty. I usually tell her "lets say bye bye to the peepee" and i put it in the big toilet. Close the seat and Let her flush it. It really has worked. The first 2 times she used the potty it took her 30mins to go pee. But by the 4th and 5th it was down to about 10 mins. And now a week later, she comes to me and tells me she has to go. And its less than a minute and she's done. It just takes consistency. I promise you, it will work. This is the 2nd time around trying to potty train my daughter. She is 2.5 now. First time she was 2yrs. He will get it. Takes time. I suggest, if he doesn't seem to quite get it. Give him a few months...even a few weeks if you want. Then introduce it again. You dont want to force him and make him scared.

Ok well if your period is on time then you can use the calender method to calculate when your ovulation occurs and then it will tell you what days you should have sex and how many times. Here is a website that is very informative with calculating your ovulation. And just to make things clear I am 17 with no kids so I dont know how effective this website will be to you but it should give you a good idea and a little help.    http://babymed.com/Tools/Fertility/Calen...|`|k5qYCP00aa	I hope your not another teen thats gonna regret this later.|`|wqFIC8c2aa	How old are you???????|`|ad5ycXvvaa	COME ON  WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GAIN.by  HAVING A BABY.

I want a baby, but don't get me wrong, i'm probably not as young as you, but still, i started reading about pregnancy online and stuff, and BOY was i sadly mistaken. The 8lb child just doesn't appear, he has to come out of a tiny place. And apparently, it hurts like hell, not to mention it's hell for 5-8 hours of labor, and you have to get an epidural. When i saw that, i was like, "eff that" there's no way in hell i was getting a painful shot in my spine.      Think before you react, it's not as easy as it looks.  and babies aren't so cute at 3a on a cold morning.
ZRsk0cAIaa	your "friends" are idiots. sorry to tell you this but i hope you are smarter than they are. find some kids who have it together to hang out with. talk to your mom about what's going on in your group.|`|58eHufb3aa	Honestly just talk to her about it.  That's all i can really say.  She aint doing it tht often, so...|`|AtTxzYXbaa	You didn't loose a friend. She still talks to you. Now she is hanging out with other people besides you and like you said, you feel left out.    I hope you don't decide to smoke weed just because someone else is doing it.|`|3mnYzbPVaa	Hi,    In the future, try not to use real names on the internet. It helps identify you which can cause you social troubles as well as legal issues if you make unfounded accusations. I'm not saying this is the case here, but it was an issue when I was finishing up middle school.    Back to the point.     With regards to the weed situation - do what you want, irrespective of what your friends are doing. Weed, if it were legal, is not for everyone. Those who decide to do it could face legal issues including large fines as well as issues in college admittance and job procurement in the future. I've definitely been tested in the past. Even if you don't get caught, it's an expensive habit and wastes time you could be doing something productive. If smoked, it may carry a higher risk for lung cancer. It also tends to correlate with a number of anxiety and mood disorders -- though please remember that causality has not been determined. Correlation is not causation, and that's an important distinction.    I have a lot of friends who have smoked pot. It's not my choice, and I have never been ostracized by any of my friends. That said, I also respect their decision to smoke and have not reported them to any authorities because I would argue that if tobacco products and alcohol are legal, marijuana is similar in many regards with regards to benefits and risks.    You don't have to lose them just because you don't do everything they do. It's like anything else. You don't have to watch Gilmore Girls because Natasha and Lindsay do. Focus on what will make you happy in the long run.    And as a note, if the behavior does concern you, talk it over with Natasha. If she ever engages in risky behavior (ie, decides to start doing drugs that are likely to end in death, starts having sex with lots of strangers and without protection, stops doing things that made her happy when she wasn't smoking), then you need to immediately involve someone else.|`|z5K3d8alaa	well if u dnt want to be left out then smoke too i does hurt doingt one time and probaly ur goin o like and probly u wont.... and take eye drops with u!good luck|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	well my best friend used to smoke pot   so i started to smoke with her and did a bunch of other drugs before i turned 14     i stopped becuas ei met my now bf and he was on probatin and it was a bet then i got preganat and my life changed     my friend still smokes but alot more it has escladed she is not the smae is not as pretty (to me ne way)    shes a totally doffrent person   then my best friend who i used to love     but dont get high it ruined my life   and im only 16 and have a much better life now   its not worth the drama and if ur friend is going to be stupid   try and talk to her and if she does not listen dont hang with her as much and find other friends   u dont need that in ur life trust me|`|1WRB7RPNaa	OMg! you so are not a loser! if i were your mother i would be sooo proud of you for not wanting to do what everyone else is doing! i know at times you may feel left out but one day they will get caught and be in a ton of trouble and you wont. i wouldn't do anything like tell on them but your smart enough to make your own decisions :)|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Not 'I think'.  You are.    Tell her parents.|`|GGH0HVdvaa	Listen, just because they decide to be stupid and do drugs doesn't mean you need to do drugs either.    I know how you feel. I've lost friends to drugs too. Well not completely lost, usually is just goes that we stop talking and only every now and then do we bump into each other and maybe chat for a little bit. But honestly, these things happen. There is no shortage of people in the world who don't do drugs. It may be time to find some new friends who aren't such a disappointment.|`|4f9vyUEoaa	Talk to her about it and see if she'll listen and if she doesn't then don't hang around her and get new friends.|`|JdFgf575aa	Tell the guidence consouler.|`|FmgAfeWuaa	this is why you dont go to private schools  and dont let weed break up a friendship  its not there to do so, you arent a loser  if you dont do it and weed doesnt make you a loser  if you do do it    just go with the flow  but it doesnt mean you have to do weed    i smoke weed once inawhile, even sometimes  with my bros dad(my half bro)    and im 15 and it hasnt effected my life  at all it only makes me get freaked if  my mom finds out im doing it  im not addicted to it at all and weed is the farthest  i will go     if you even do drugs dont go over weed  i have friends that are addicted to acid and heroin  and life isnt going so well to them, when i look  at them i see them dieing they use  to look so healthy and happy but that surely has changed    i lost friends to drugs by them dieing my friend just od on heroin and died this summer he was only 18 for less than 4 months, if you havent started dont  it will be good for you    trust me you can be happy without drugs    and weed isnt as bad as those commercials  make it sound even our health teachers told us that    and your friend will be the same but sometimes more  chill, happy, and hungry dont freak, everything will be fine    one of my friends is a major pot head but in all honors classes still pulling a's even know that sucks to all the kids not making such high marks who stay away from drugs    pot heads arent all baked idiots    sometimes i wish i never smoked at all but sometimes i cant stop thinking about it, weed hasnt been bad to me but it makes me want to try other drugs and im actually an intelligent person but weed can hide that side of you

qNaEadD2aa	The emergency contraceptive pill is full of hormones, so it often throws a woman off track on her normal cycle, and can sometimes take a few months for the cycle to return to normal.    If she has any major concerns, I would suggest that she talks to her doctor.    Unfortunately, only your friend knows her cycle properly and I am not a doctor, so I cannot tell her if this is normal for her specific cycle..|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Eight days? She might want to see her doctor about that. I know it does cause you to get a period right away,but that's a long period. And make sure she's eating iron rich foods,don't want her to get anemic.
se3RwEWyaa	On day three he is looking for your estrogen levels for your follicular phase of the cycle (to make sure your follicles are maturing) and the levels of hormones are in harmony. Then day 21 he is looking for progesterone levels to confirm ovulation and that you can sustain pregnancy, if you do conceive. Progesterone nutures the uterine lining and prepares it for implantation of a fertilized egg.  Good luck, God Bless....BABY DUST!!!!|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	On day 3 they are checking your FSH level which helps determine your egg reserve.  On day 21 they are checking your progesterone level to hopefully confirm that you did ovulate that cycle.   This gives them a good idea if the hormone side of things is working correctly.    Best wishes!|`|f8699694a914d97de1475e396e85f0b8aa	i got those tests done...day 3 for some hormone levels like tsh testosterone   and day 21 for ovulation prediction|`|rwuoIksyaa	When my sister was pregnant they tested her once for all the std and so on tests that they run and then the next time they tested her blood was to do a glucose test to see if she had high blood sugar.|`|637a5c03a75067bb2597c847507db47eaa	E2 (estrogen), Progesterone, FSH (folical stimulating hormone) and LH lutenzing hormone. All need to be a desirable levels to conceive, or maintain a pregnancy.
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    In my first pregnancy it took my body 5 weeks to show a positive test 4 me, my doctor told me that my body took a little longer to produce high hcg levels for a test to detect.  Maybe the medication is affecting your cycles, did you talk to your doctor about the side affects from it?    I would advise making an appointment with the doctor for a blood test, they are more accurate and they will be able to tell you if the medication if affecting your cycles.    Best of luck xx|`|kUCVLuTPaa	the medicine probably delayed your period
Jo2DfRzaaa	Absolutely thats a great idea!  all day might be a long time for him (you know your son better than me) if thats the case, maybe break the day in half - wears it before lunch and wears them after lunch and then he earns 2 stickers in a day.  something like that, then switch to full days.  i remember doing something like that with my daughter when we were trying to keep her potty trained.  either way, good luck!  hopefully he'll get used to it sooner rather than later.    EDIT - thanks.  I'm trying it out.  i'm not sure how comfy i am knowing the weirdos on this site so well see if it lasts.  plus i need a pic reminder - i've gained like 15 lbs since that photo was taken and its getting on my last nerve.  time to lose it and need motivation!|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	I think it's a good idea.  I agree with "stay@homemomma" that it might be along time, shortening the time with maybe a reward after lunch (even a cookie or a lollipop or a fun game - something he likes) and then another small one at bedtime.  You could gradually phase out one and lengthen the time.    I started wearing glasses just before I turned 2 and I always took them off and gave them to the dog (so my mom says).  I had a babysitter that I really loved and I got very close with her husband.  He always told me that I couldn't be his girl and wouldn't play with me until I put the glasses on - it worked.      I wore my glasses all week, can I go to play place?|`|28WJwHf4aa	If he is wearing them already with no issues, I wouldn't tie in a sticker chart.    If he starts not wanting to wear them, then you may want to move on to a sticker chart as a way to entice him to wear them.|`|PJYrLxZHaa	I think it's a great idea. Rewarding kids always goes a long way, and I think a sticker chart would be perfect for his age.     This site- http://www.encourageandpraise.com/ has sticker and reward charts that you can print out, for free.     Good luck!!!|`|AqvEHHsTaa	sounds like a great idea.  I also can suggest a ticket system.  I did that with my daughters when they were potty training.  We put a star on the chart and then they got tickets to hold in a special place.  I got a roll of tickets (like fair/raffle tickets) at Office Depot and there is like 1000 for about $6.  It seemed to give them something tangible to hold onto along with the star chart that they could go up and admire.  Good luck!|`|xlcKBMw7aa	I think its a really great idea, my sister was about 2 or 3 when she got her first pair of glasses and it was kinda hard on her...I think that if my mom had actually done something to reward her it would have helped a lot...she wears them all the time now (she's 15 now)|`|TQW5E6olaa	I think that's a great idea. Something to entice him to wear them all day. What will the something special be?|`|UUpsa35Daa	A reward system like that is great for little kids, it really motivates them and gives them something to work for.    I've seen multiple parents do it for their kids and it's worked out wonderfully.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	That sounds like a good idea.|`|iF92Q2f3aa	Little kids mostly love stickers, so why not?    Only you say he wears his glasses ok anyway; maybe you should reserve the sticker chart idea for motivating him to do something he has trouble with, if it comes up. Otherwise they can get a bit blas about stickers.

aZwaCKgdaa	Cons: 1) cost; 2) there are no guarantees that the sample will be good enough to use if it is ever needed; 3) for many conditions that it can treat, doctors may not use the child's own cord blood because it could contain a genetic defect that caused the problem it is treating; 4) it can only be used for children (generally the samples are too small to provide enough stem cells for an adult).    With all those cons, I banked my third child's cord blood on the recommendation of my daughter's oncologist and my OB/GYN.  My middle daughter is a cancer patient and we could potentially use the stem cells for her.  I have been told that it is really only recommended to bank the cord blood if you already have a child who currently has a condition that has been successfully treated in the past with cord blood.  For this population, there are programs that make banking the cord blood free.|`|yB5go5wbaa	It's expensive.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	it's very expensive and about 1 -100 shot you will ever need it.

And there is no scientifical proof that it will actually work.

I dare to be different too! ;)|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	The only con I know of is that it is expensive.|`|POSGHgzuaa	The only con is that it's expensive.

kSZx9cY5aa	I agree with you.  While I don't think kids should admire Paris' behaviour, I don't think everyone should be so adament on putting her down.  I have a 15yo and she says she admires the fact that Paris Hilton doesn't let people get her down, that she doesn't care what people say about her, and that she is smart enough to be succesful. Sure she's an heiress, but she has found ways to make her OWN money.    Look at all the kids that admire Miley Cyrus. Most pre-teens and teens, don't care about Paris Hilton and don't admire her anyway. But so many of them worship Miley Cyrus/Hannah Montanna. There have been plenty of nude and suggestive pics taken of Miley Cyrus, and she's dating a 25yo (I think). The character she plays on her show, is rude, a horrible friend, and a liar. She's also only 16, at least Paris is an adult!    You make a lot of good points.|`|muOxoDGOaa	You make some really awesome points there. The same thing goes with Miley Cyrus as well. People just don't understand celebrities. Not EVERYONE is perfect. The paparazzi just want their money.|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	So you're saying you would definitely encourage your daughter to look up to Paris as a role model
cEXzXkqnaa	when they say "pick your battles" they are more talking about letting the little things slide...NOT like hitting...more like if she wants to rub potatoes in her hair...oh just let her...she's gonna get a bath anyways...that kinda thing...|`|OMyC0IJVaa	I pick and choose my battles with my kids but it is never about things like hitting. The important ones always have a consequence. The ones I choose on are what I want them to wear vs what they want to wear, occasionally having a junky breakfast, things like that. Kids need to feel they have some control over their lives but it needs to be appropriate for the age and situation.|`|V1Zje2KYaa	One ought to be consistent about rules, but willing to evaluate severity on an individual basis.  If you turn everything into a fight, your children will learn not to take you very seriously, whereas if you only put your foot down when it's important they will respect your judgment a bit more.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	no picking and choosing ur battles means not freaking out over the little things|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Yes you should fight every battle.  It shows the child, you are consistent in your rules.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	yes spare the rod and spoil the child|`|hl5WdXnbaa	Just to back up what everyone else has said... picking your battles does not apply to the big things like hitting, being disrespectful...ect ect.. It applies to the little things a child may do ...and if you were to fight every battle both you and your child would be very unhappy.|`|am63G2ytaa	yeah u have to discipline ur kids even tho u dont want them to be angry u just have to make sure that the rules r inforced and wether u like it or not thatis your job as a parent.|`|AqvEHHsTaa	there comes a time when you must allow them to fight their own battles (within reason of course).  This means that while you have instructed them time and again not to hit, sometimes it just doesn't stick in certain situations.  i.e. When they are older (like 3/4) and upset about something and lash out on their big sister and the big sister pops them back, they get upset and hit back and so it starts,  When this happens, I let them go at it because the little one will learn definately that it is not ok to hit.  The older one knows already and was only hitting in defense.  I'm not sure if I am explaining it right but it really does make a difference because they actually see and FEEL the hurt that comes with hitting and it is a long time usually, if ever, they do it again.  I'm not a mom who just lets them beat the crap out of each other but I let them prove my point.  Hitting is not good and you will get hurt.  Usually after this, I rarely have to say, "no hitting".|`|OaxXT5nzaa	Sometimes kids do stuff for attention.  If you ignore it, they may stop.  However, if danger is involved or violence that is definitly a battle you would fight.  A child can also be overwhelmed by the rules and subtelties of social situations.  You would not correct a two year old for something you would correct a ten year old for.  Rome wasn't built in a day and you can't train a child in a day.  You choose behaviors that you feel are most important to teach and go with those.  Too much at once will just make the kid confused.|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	Well, the idea is to pick the things that are important, like hitting, and then discipline every time. You're right, it's completely ineffective to only enforce your rules some of the time. But if you disciplined every little thing, you'd never have time to do anything else.|`|VygBNA0Waa	you are right you should always follow through   but sometimes you are constantly on the children's back and you start to feel insane and the children don't stop so i usually get to the point that i need a break so i will go out side and pretend i can t here them four five minutes|`|s4LWmcTjaa	To a point I agree.  But really, are you going to harp on your kid because he wants to pull his PB&J apart and eat the bread with the jelly on it first?  Are you going to nit pick him when his clothes don't match when he dresses himself?  Are you going to get on to your child when she is pulling the clothes out of your dresser if it keeps her happy for a few minutes and no one is being hurt by it?  And are you going to get on to your kid if she chooses not to finish all her broccoli if she has at least tried it?    The answer for me is NO.      For direct disobedience, violent actions or disrespect, none of those things will be battles I choose to let go.     Use some sense please.  You should know what "pick your battles" means if you are a parent.    EDIT:  Perfect example.  My toddler is getting his drinking straws out and using them to line his place mat on the floor right now.  I could choose to get mad at him and put him in time out or I can choose to let it go because he's not hurting anyone or anything.  He's having a good time.  I'm choosing to let that go.  No harm, no battle.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	'Picking your battles' is not about letting the rules slide, it's about deciding where rules are needed & where they aren't.      Hitting - that's a battle to fight.  Deciding what to wear - not something to fight about, as long as it's decent    Trying to control everything will lead to one battle after another after another & no learning how to think for themselves|`|POHWTDPRaa	It isn't about being lazy. If people get on their kids for every rule they break and every single other thing they do wrong they will be yelling at them constantly. Besides that saying applies more to things that aren't rules and just happen to pop up - 'Can I have ice cream for breakfast?' Yeah, why not? If you make it clear that it's only going to be allowed that one time, there isn't any harm in it.|`|UUpsa35Daa	Not making your kids follow the rules you make time to set and explain is being lazy, yes.    But that's not what parents usually mean when they say "pick and choose your battles". Say your 16 year old daughter goes out one weekend with a group of friends to the movies. She gets back at a reasonable time, spends the rest of the weekend with her family, does good in school the next week and then Saturday night roles around and she wants to go out with her friends again to a supervised party. Now maybe you're thinking "well she went out last weekend so she can just stay home this weekend" but you know that will upset her and cause a fight and you think, well...there are worse things that she could be doing...2 weekends in a row with friends isn't so bad. And you let her go.    That's picking and choosing your battles.|`|iF92Q2f3aa	This is about having consistent and meaningful rules that reflect parental values.     The phrase "pick your battles" means don't get into a big confrontation with your child over things that don't matter.    In the example you give, you're right, you should be consistent. And yes, not following through on something important (like the No Hitting rule) seems lazy to me.  You don't have to fight a pitched battle over everything, though; you just need to be firm, fair and predictable, so that the kids grow up knowing the rules.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	no   if the parents are on and on at the kids over every tiny thing   the kids stop paying attention    picking and choosing battles doesnt mean tell them off for hitting once and then not telling them off another time they hit    it means tell them off for hitting but say if they left cookies unwraped or somthing like that dont have a go at them just wrap them up or mention it to them but not in a yelling way    so thats being consistant  your allways teling off for hitting but little things youl let slide so that wen they do something really bad the telling off will have more of an effect on them  because youknow if there allways being told off what would seperate punching someone from leaving cookies open to a child|`|oem5yEUDaa	You are correct sir!
6t27NOQTaa	soap water scrubbing and time is probably the simplest    also you may try alcohol - the rubbing kind rather than the drinking kind|`|Gr0UGqZiaa	Rubbing alcohol should help.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Try nail polish remover on your hands, but I wouldn't suggest that on your lips....|`|H6LxeWZfaa	just simply washing with warm water and soap.  it'll take a little while, but most should come off.    im in cooking class and i alllways get  food coloring on my hands, and it usually washes off easily.  goodluck!

xCZ5S2ONaa	pee on a pregnancy tester >.> if it says your preg. then you are >.> obviously if not its just in your head >.>|`|NC9FV8bLaa	There's always a chance you could be, but I would wait a few days and see if these "cramps" bring something on.|`|QlzFoBS3aa	Yes, 31 years ago same thing happened to me, he will be 30 next week.|`|SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    Yes there is a chance you can be pregnant, because you had sex around ovulation.  Have you tried taking a pregnancy test as this will show your results as you are nearly a week late for your period.  For a more accurate result have a blood test done at the doctors, you will get the results back within a few days.    The cramping maybe where the uterus is now starting to grow.  Also i don't want to worry you but my best friend found out she had PCOS because she didn't get periods and had cramps like she was going to come on, so it would be best to see the doctor.  Best of luck and i hope you get the results you want.  xx
eemmWU0Haa	anything is possible wait til you miss your period then  take a test.  good Luck.  Jenny xoxox|`|6avKnzkoaa	Pregnancy is possible anytime you have sex.   Protected sex will lower your chances though. However protection isn't 100% effective either.  Those symptoms may well be just PMS symptoms or false alarms. I'm not sure when your next period is due, but take a pregnancy test when it's supposed to be due.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	Yes pregnancy is possible and yes those are all early pregnancy symptoms.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	doubt it but you can test..have you missed period yet?...wait until you miss your period...|`|KMtd5gr0aa	Yes always possible..

rHufcHwHaa	8 weeks is really early to have a diabetes test, I think.  I am scheduled for mine at 25 weeks, and everyone I know has had it between 24 and 30 weeks.  To answer your question though, my cousin had a miscarriage last June, and is carrying her baby just fine now! Many couples who experience miscarriage are able to have babies later.  My grandma had 2 miscarriages, and then gave birth to identical twin girls a few years later.|`|u1uECuFNaa	I wish you luck and send you prayers...  My daughter was born 8-8-98.

Just one thing though. Its a little early to do GD testing, if it came back high this early in pregnancy theres a chance you had undiagnosed diabetes before pregnancy. Typical time to test for GD is around 28 weeks unless you had it before(Like me I was tested at 16.5weeks this time).|`|Fx77zYhWaa	You already did that test?  I thought they didn't do it until the 2nd trimester.    I had a healthy pregnancy immediately following a very early miscarriage.

rHufcHwHaa	I wouldn't.  My brother was like this for years with my mom and dad.  They had a healthy relationship and my other brother and I were just fine, but my out-of-control brother would bring everyone to tears at least once a week.  Nothing worked--punishments, loss of privileges, etc.      However, to everyone outside of our house, he was so charming.  EVERYONE loved him and couldn't understand why all of us were "so horrible."  Nobody can possibly understand what he was like, because he doesn't want them to see how bad he can be.  Stand up for what you did--you have to keep your daughter and yourselves in mind.  If he's happier elsewhere and you're happier without him in the house, that's what you should do.  Maybe he'll come around when he grows up a little bit and things will work out.  That's what happened in my family.  Good luck!|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	You were right to do that.  He needs to learn a lesson.|`|f682f057ec5a1c3b735eccb94711bf8eaa	Wow. I'm not touching this one with a 10 foot pole, but I will say this: even if you don't like your parents, still respect them for all that they have done for you ( with the exception of abusive or horrible parents).   I would give an actual yes/no answer, but I don't know you or all the facts. Hope everything gets straightened out for you guys.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Do not feel guilty!  Anyone saying you gave up on him needs to zip it!  If he won't pay his own phone bill or car insurance because he is being a lazy beeeeeeeeeeep. Then let those things be cut off.  You shouldn't have to put up with an abusive child. You brought him into the world, and if you supplied him with a safe and loving home then he should respect you|`|QvF8dR7Taa	no,but him being your son you will nomatter how obnoxus he is and you will worry about him,but he needs to learn his parents and family is the closest thing to himself he will ever have till he has his own kids,just pray he dosent do some stupid things and get into more trouble than he can get out of after a resonable length of time|`|xBW4saqgaa	you should not worry yourself. you have done the right thing and moreover dont care what the world speaks. they might take care of him now but the people who really love him are his parents thats you. so dont worry. he need to learn. take care and god bless.|`|waUHzOlXaa	I DONT BELIEVE YOU SHOULD...HE'S LEGALLY YOUR PROBLEM UP TO 18,NOT BECAUSE UR A MOTHER DOES IT MEAN U SHOULD HAVE TO TAKE ALL HIS CRAP & AS A MAN HE SHOULD PAY HIS OWN BILLS!

GOOD LUCK!=]|`|D73dRFyzaa	Yes You Should Feel Guilty|`|1uyhFsFsaa	no don't you dare feel guilty, just sit back and wait for that other family member to come to you when they realise what he is really like and they get the same treatment. he might be all sweetness and light with them for the moment as he is probably getting all the attention " oh what a poor little boy that his parents can do that to him " you just wait til that wears off. mark my words they will feel very guilty at what they have done by judging you.   you can't let your whole family suffer at the hands of a nasty teenager some just turn bad whatever you do and you don't have to accept it.   if the shoe had been on the other foot and it was you being abusive he would have been taken away from you because social services say a child doesn't have to put up with a life like that, so why should you unfortunately though parents don't get the same help offered as a child you have to do it yourself then bigoted people that know nothing of the situation make unfair judgments against you.  you hold your head high and wait for them to see the truth it always comes out in the end
ACtpwL7maa	I have the same thing it started yesterday... I keep thinking my period started but its just that stuff cuz there is just so much of it...my best friend just found out she is pregnant a couple days ago and she said she had/has that same stuff. She said it is sticky. I agree I wish our spit turned blue or something as soon as we become pregnant so we knew, the wondering gets old after awhile!|`|DWvnIYTEaa	Well it works both ways... after ovulation cm goes back to white sticky cm, however in early pregnancy Ive heard that women can have it to. So yes it is an early sign of pregnancy. Dont you just wish that our bodies would just give one clear sign instead of everything meaning either PMS or pregnancy... argh. LOL ;)|`|sk46uigvaa	that happens to me up until AF
p0prrzf2aa	weird. take another test and see wat it does.|`|9zMC6EBtaa	Probably just a malfunctioned test, get another one and see if it gives you a more accurate result.|`|DWvnIYTEaa	Hmm... Thats a tough one. Could have been a faulty test. You're best bet to eliminate all doubt is retest in the morning. Good luck.|`|uDdEq7ePaa	This happened to me once. It turned out that I wasn't pregnant.    I think you have a dodgy test. I would retest.
EMKuBql8aa	I think the mom should talk to the daughter about what she wants. She is 15 and is old enough to give a say on if she should see him or not. If the mom says no and the daughter finds out later, then she will hold resentment to it. Play neutral no matter how you feel about the situation.|`|AqvEHHsTaa	get as much child support that she can but not allow the father to see the child.  Why upset the child and create an emotional event for her when he obviously doesn't care one whit about her.|`|3ERKIfqIaa	This is a difficult one because i deal with a very similar problem also..My son is only 10 and has met his biological father twice in his life only once that he remembers. If his father were to ever come around, which would shock the mess out of me, i would leave it up to my son to decide..I would talk to him and let him know he is wanting to see him and I don't want him to get his hopes up that he will see him more then just this once because chances are that's not going to happen he hasn't been around in the past..She is definitely old enough to understand and make that choice...but you have to let her know what is going on so that she knows You did your part, all You could to try to make things work....but He is the one that continues to fail time after time.....and about the child support...HAAHAAAAAAAAAAAA.... dont we WISH!!!! if you ever learn to draw blood from a turnip let me know PLEASE!!!!!!|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Hell yea, he helped to create that child & then up & left the mother to fend for herself while he was around enjoying life, pay up brother.    If it was me I and my daughter bet your bottom dollar I would be right there with both of them, you're not going to fill my daughter's head with lies & make yourself look innocent in her eyes.
EFlX4GYOaa	but the initials are wrong  RMM    Try   Victor Rabbit Mudvayne Maddog     VRMM|`|173vsiacaa	haha. awesome.   note that dweezil and apple have well-known parents, so the nature of their family background is probably what contributes most to having 'every advantage in life,' not so much their names    so by naming your son that, he may just have a pretty bad school life, hence overruling your purpose of him to 'have every advantage in life'    maybe you should pick one which isn't so radically different and animal-related|`|D75iQvl1aa	I don't think so. For a boy's first name I would pick something like James or Patrick. For their middle name I would pick something like Henry ...well.. something simple. When people name their children after something that isn't a real name it gets really annoying. Many children are named after cars like Mercedes or Acura or something weird like Diamond or Precious, and it gives them NO advantage for when they get older and their business cards say Rabbit Mudvayne Maddog. It would be more appreciated by the child later in their life to have a name such as Patrick Henry .....  At least in my opinion! :)|`|BOr7glxAaa	Your poor kid! If you want to be original, go with something from a Redwall book. Good names, and most people wouldn't think to name their child that. Some examples are Mathias, Mattimeo, and Martin.|`|3XaREbrQaa	wow....this has to be a joke. thats horrible and you know it.|`|Elxuvon8aa	NO|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	Frig yes.|`|sPl34hzWaa	would one of those advantages include being made fun of for his whole life?
s4LWmcTjaa	LOL, no you aren't the only one.  My house doesn't look like a pig sty, but it is lived in.  It's somewhat cluttered most of the day with kids' toys on the floor and sippy cups here and there.      Don't feel badly.  As long as your house is sanitary (as in you don't have mold growing everywhere and you are over all clean), then you're good.|`|u1uECuFNaa	A 1 year old can do a little. He will follow you.   My house is always messy.   I have 4.      He is certainly cute.   :)|`|PlmT4lHXaa	Pick a handful of toys that hes really interested in right now for him to play with and keep those in a bin, then put the rest away in storage. A 1 year old is amused by so many things, so I don't think he'll be too bummed if you limit the toys. Try to keep them in only one or two rooms so you are aren't scrambling around tying to put them away at the end of the day. Get a BIG toy-bin for easy cleanup, rather than trying to stuff them into boxes or shelves. Make a limit of 2-3 toys out at a time, then make sure those are put away before you get out other ones- then everything isn't left to pile up.    Good luck!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Ya....I have toys everywhere. My son's 3 though so I've been on him to put things away. My house isn't *dirty* but it's really cluttery. We live in a small apartment with almost NO storage space.|`|1r05fktRaa	take a  Parenting class|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	You mean it's not supposed to look like this?!  I thought everyone had an obstacle course of cars, Lego, naked dolls, balls and dump trucks in the middle of their dining room.  I look at it as saving money - I don't need a gym membership!    I try to get the kids to do it but... I usually pick up at naptime and then again at bedtime.  I only do it in between if it gets really out of control.    We just look for the illusion of clean.  I figure I'll have a spotless house when they are all gone to college.|`|EMKuBql8aa	I have a 2 1/2 year old and a 13 month old and they wreck havoc on the house. I think it's normal, I hope it's normal, lol.|`|28WJwHf4aa	Completely normal! :-)    You can try to limit the toys to one room by blocking off areas.     Or to help with the amount of toys, do a rotation. Get 7 bins/tubs (or more if you have too many toys), and put an array of toys in each, including books and puzzles. Each day take one tub out. Then the only clean up you have is that one tub. This also helps with preventing over-stimulation and boredom, and seeing a toy after a week of not having it can be exciting for a little kid.|`|rymbwVKXaa	I went through the same thing. I ended up just picking up after the boys went to bed, or if it was something messy like play do I would do it right away. I did pick up when I was expecting company but it just gets too time consuming when there is more kids than you.|`|PhkLLwVbaa	I felt just like you kind of like a failure as a house wife my child is 2 and he does pick up after himself before he goes to bed but my house looks like a big tornado went through it there mostly scattered between the living room and the dinning room but it is normal its just something us when have to go through i'm sure in another year from now my son will stop needing all of his toys out everywhere but I don't want to be one of those over bearing parents that make there kid put a toy up before getting another one don't wear your self out i did for about 6 months after my son turned two its not worth it just pick up after your son is down for the night if someone doesn't like tell them if they cant understand that you now have a mobile toddler running around then they don't need to come over.|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	I started teaching my son around 1 year that he had to pick up, too, and now he puts away his toys with a minimum of help. When the mess gets out of hand, I make him put a few toys away before he takes out another one. It sounds like you're dealing fine with the astounding amount of mess a toddler can create, but he's a good age to start learning that any toy he takes out has to be put away.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I have 18 mos old, 3 and 5 year olds... yeah... I vacuum my living room at least twice a day because all the crumbs they drag around, there is toys around, kitchen floor is sticky, and there is clothes around the house because someone decided to change their wardrobe the 3rd time today...   As soon as I am done cleaning the house and turn around they have started to make a mess out of the living room or their room again...   And they do pick up after themselves, help cleaning and take their dirty clothes to the hamper but with 3 small kids its just never ending.. and we dont live in a museum, they are allowed to live in this house and with that comes some disorder.   I try to keep it clean but it is cluttered. Maybe in a few years I'll have my nice organized house with no cheerios on the floor and socks under the couch...|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	Nope I gave up a long time ago. One thing you can do to help the situation is put away some of the toys and rotate them every couple of weeks so he thinks he's getting something new. Then there's not as much to drag out.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Want to borrow my four for a day? lol    Of course the house is always a little cluttered. I learned early to keep a toy basket or container near the places where my kids play. I also learned early to show them how to place toys in these containers. It makes a quick pick up easier on all of us.     Another trick is to pack away some toys that he's not playing with, when you get them back out (after they've forgotten about them) it's like having new toys!
be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	Not always.    I had a missed miscarriage last summer at 10 weeks, the baby died at 6 weeks but its placenta was still attached and producing hormones. I did spot the day I found out I miscarried. I had a dnc the next day.|`|rymbwVKXaa	I had a miscarriage and didn't even know until I went to the dr. My dr even gave me a week after the appt to see if my body would do everything on its own but never did. I never cramped or bled.|`|eemmWU0Haa	well with my 2 resent miscarriages I had cramps and alot alot of blood and major craps worst then period cramps and I had a very hi fever and the chills all at once and black n blue chunks, its was nasty and the smell it was awful, gross!|`|e39a79f6daf722c960330aea2db67b78aa	The answer is that anything can happen. You can have bleeding and pain, you can have bleeding and no pain, you can have no bleeding and pain.. or, you can have nothing and not know at all until your next doctor's appointment when they find out that something's not right.|`|KMtd5gr0aa	I didnt know! It just all happened like SUPER fast one morning... And yes people miscarry b4 they even know their pregnant and think its a period. Seems odd but it happens alot! And yes my miscarry was painfull with tons of bleeding.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	It depends on how soon it happens.  Early on it can be mistaken for a period.  I had one 2 days after I got a positive pregnancy test and if I hadn't have taken that test I would've thought it was my period.  For me it was less cramps than I'd have if it was actually my period.  Some women have bad cramps and clots.  Some even have to have D & C.|`|k1l2jhr7aa	From my experiance, I cramped really really bad and then started bleeding.. I think that is kinda the way it always goes but I could be wrong as everyone is different. Good luck

My sister and I are the same size/weight and we were due with our babies one day apart. FUnny thing is when we went out no one EVER asked her when she was due or even knew she was expecting and from 4 months along they could tell I was expecting.. Your tummy is CUTE!!

Congrats on your pregnancy, you are goregous.|`|DWvnIYTEaa	Awwww! Really cute. I cant wait for my own belly
RHhiyesYaa	i don't know but i don't think so. 1)because u had sex on the first day of your period and it's almost impossible to ovulate at that time. 2) it's still too early to feel all these symptoms if you were pregnant. but there is always a chance. test next week if your period doesn't show, or go to the doctor for a blood test.
68c6B8dRaa	We bought a convertible car seat and it stays in the car. I feel bad when I see a tiny baby being toted around in some ugly plastic casing instead of in a parents' arms.    I have a 17mo and have never used a stroller. It is totally doable, and, I feel, much nicer and more convenient. Look into Ergo carriers and Maya Wrap slings -- both excellent, comfy to wear, durable. I have used it around the house. When baby was younger many of her naps were in the sling, too.|`|M5E3mDBJaa	I bought a travel system for outings and it's the best thing ever.  The baby goes from car to stroller without being disturbed, and they are easy to push and maneuver.  Also, slings are great, but not that practical if you plan to be out all day.  The baby needs stimulation and may not like being confined and want to see his/her surroundings after the first few months.  My car seat is an infant carrier, and I have no regrets.  I can get my kids into and out of the car with ease.  It gets a little heavy as they get older, but all in all, i'm very happy with my purchase.  If you want something light to go with your carrier, you can get a snap-n-go type stroller.    http://images.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=ht...|`|t1fx6kXcaa	I tried a sling but my son screamed when I tried to put him in it. I tried three times before my nerves got the better of me and I gave up. I know a lot of mother swear by them but I didn't like it. I also supported him with one hand so for me, it wasn't convenient either. I ended up just carrying my son for the first 4 months and than I used a pram (stroller). Mainly the pram was just for carrying the baby bag, groceries etc and I still ended up carrying my son. Prams are valuable for older babies and toddlers though. My son wanted to sit up in the pram instead of being carried from the age of 9 months. He was much happier sitting up in the pram and reading or taking everything in. He would have hated being in a sling. From the age of 12 months when he was running around, I again used the pram to carry everything in it and he would alternate between running along side me and sitting in the pram. We used the pram up until about 20 months but only used it when he was going to have a nap whilst out shopping etc. Now at 22 months, he doesn't use it and I'm going to sell it.|`|5f6XnInEaa	I have both.    I use the sling for shopping trips when I am on my own, as I need to push a trolley, and having a pram at the same time just wouldn't work.  Plus, it was great for around the house to get things done.  Greatest invention ever!    But, for big days out, I have a pram.   It's a very lightweight Child Care captiva...great for long trips, and folds up to a quarter of the size of a car boot, even though it is suitable for newborns.    we have a convertible car seat, but not a carrier one, just one that converts into a toddler seat once he is bigger.    To sum it up...I'd get both.    You can buy prams that practically fold up to nothing these days.|`|POSGHgzuaa	We bought a) a wrap, b) a carrier, c) an infant carseat and a universal stroller frame (not one of the travel ensembles), and d) a stroller.  We used the wrap (Moby) for when he was small and used it around the house as well as out.  We used the carrier (Ergo) when he was more interested in seeing what was around him - from about 9 months.  We used the carseat and stroller frame so that we could tote him around without having to wake him up.  If he had been in a convertible seat, we'd have to wake him to put him in a stroller.  We kept him in the infant seat until just past his first birthday.  You can't really use that to carry the baby around, though.  It gets too heavy really fast!  We used the stroller occasionally before he was 1 - mostly when we forgot to bring the stroller frame.     Frankly, though wearing the baby is wonderful, there are times when you want your hands free, and a stroller is a good option.  But the stroller frame is great to keep from disturbing sleep!|`|f401ea307e44f234284f4730f9d3f181aa	For my first two, I bought the infant car seat and reversible car seat and used both a stroller and sling. Now on my third. money wise we only bought the reversible car seat and only use the sling with her. We still have a stroller (sit and stand) for the two ol der when their legs get tired. I wish what we did with this one, we would have done with the other two.  I have the maya wrap, and do put baby in it around the house. Now I want the beco carrier, for back carrying (can't make the sling work right on my back with the older one).|`|TqOdbhNAaa	If you have the money, I would recommend getting an infant carseat and a carseat stroller base.  The stroller base is just a frame that you pop the carseat on.  It was so awesome and convenient b/c we would just pop the carseat out of the car and onto the stroller when necessary.  We put the baby in the carseat and were able to carry her from the house to the car without any problems.  You can also put the carseat on top of shopping carts.      I suggest this only if you don't mind spending the money because you'll have to eventually get a real stroller and a convertible carseat.  We used the infant stuff until our daughter was 5 months old.  It was pretty awesome for when she was newborn and sleeping more often.|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	The sling was the best invention ever. I made my own after finding a store-bought one uncomfortable and not adjustable enough. I didn't use it much around the house, but my son ALWAYS rode in it during errands. When he was newborn I could snuggle him against my front, when he got older he liked to ride cross-legged, facing out, and when he was a toddler I shifted him around and he rode on my back. He nursed in the sling. It was comfortable. I could take it off and fold it in my purse. I almost never used strollers.    You can make your own sling with 3 yards of fabric (you can trim the end if it's too long) and two 3 inch steel rings (from any hardware store). Pass one end of the fabric through both rings, fold it over, and sew it in place. Hem the other end. You fasten the sling by passing the loose end through both rings, then coming back through just one.   Good luck!    http://theslingstation.com/maya-wrap.htm...|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Well, we live in a city and don't have a car, so while I do have a car seat, I rarely use it.  I use the stroller a lot.  I have a couple of baby carriers but when my son was tiny I was recovering from a c-section and found using them too uncomfortable.  Now that he's huge I only use them for short trips.  My husband carries him in the carrier a LOT though.  One of the one's that we have converts to a backpack, but we're not quite ready to not be able to see him yet...    My stroller is a convertible stroller that flips from being a pram that faces you to a stroller that faces out.  So we've been able to use it from the beginning.  When he was a newborn he could lie flat.  Now that's he's more interested in the world he can sit up and face out.  There are times when it's a drag (especially when it snows and people only shovel a 6 inch wide swathe of their sidewalk) but I've gotten used to it.  I couldn't survive in the city without my stroller!|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	Honestly I would go w/the stroller.  Because it has room for the diaper bag etc.  A sling is also good to have but if I were too choose one it would be a stroller.  We did have a travel system.  We did have an infant car seat and it was really heavy to carry around...and my son grew out of it when he was 4 months old.  So we ended up buying a convertible seat anyway.

vzDmaWqaaa	CALL THE DOCTOR    If there is a comfusion with medication at any age epecially babies call the doctor and ask what should be done immediately upon realization of the mixup.  don't take the chance.  It will probably be fine but releave yourself by making absolutely sure.|`|u0qU6DzZaa	Actually your baby will be fine. Possibly a stomach ache, but other then that it will be just fine. If you call poison control they will reassure you.    My daughter drank an ENTIRE bottle of that liquid ibuprofen when she was 11 months old. I called poison control and they said she would be fine. They helped settle my heart down.     Bottom line, baby is fine...feed some bread or crackers to absorb some of it to avoid to much absorption    1-800-222-1222. Poison Control.....have bottle of medicine ready and good luck....=)|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	You need to call your pediatrician, certain antibiotics can be toxic to the kidneys!  Augmentin is usually a 1/2 teaspoon for a baby, and 1.4ml sounds like a weird dosage, are you sure that's the right amount?|`|K5TrkUhCaa	I looked up the information for you and from what I read I think you should most definitely contact the baby's doctor and if you can't get ahold of the doctor then you should take the baby in to the ER. It's always better to be safe rather than sorry, especially when dealing with the well being of an infant or child. Here is the overdose warning for Augmentin:    OVERDOSE: If overdose is suspected, contact your local poison control center or emergency room immediately. US residents can call the US national poison hotline at 1-800-222-1222. Canadian residents should call their local poison control center directly. Symptoms of overdose may include: severe stomach/abdominal pain, severe vomiting, persistent diarrhea, a severe decrease in the amount of urine, or seizures.|`|XHFj2IVhaa	Why are you wasting time on here when you should be calling the doctor, pharmacist, or poison control center?  It may not be a big deal, but you'd better hurry up and make that call, before something happens..!|`|iHlRHGHcaa	Thats over 3 times what the baby was supposed to take. I can't believe you'd take the time to type all that out online instead of taking your baby to the ER or calling poison control.
HyknHVV5aa	Well I guess every parent is different, but the recommend amount of time to breast feed is only for the first 6 months, and then max until the child is closer to 1.  So yes, breast feeding 2 and 3 years old is a little extreme...|`|avx7bLnKaa	its her business how long she chooses to nurse..... i understand it made you uncomfortable and perhaps she should have told the child to wait but you can't judge her....|`|r9gBoBLCaa	I think they are too old, but each to their own.  I think once your kids can drink a sippy cup, they don't need your boobs no more!|`|ZrIl3PwLaa	I am not going to judge any mother for nursing, BF is something every family must decide on their own that includes when to start when to stop. I personally only nursed my daughter until she was 15 months old and even then towards the end I knew she was to old and it was uncomfortable for me. But if this is what she wants to do then that is her right. If you feel uncomfortable with her doing so at your home in front of you perhaps ask her to cover up as she would with a newborn so you don't see her breast or just talk to her and tell her if possible could she not do so where your son could see it. Or just don't have her over for Long play dates    good luck!!!|`|rIzx4OEWaa	Nope I agree with you.|`|DlEwI1XPaa	she's tooo attached to her children---it hurts her that they will stop breast-feedng----common sense--i am smart|`|AMuVbIwnaa	Everyone parents differently.

I guess anything which seems unusual to us, may make us uncomfortable.    I find it difficult when I see a 4 year old with a dummy for example, or a bottle full of juice, or sweets given to a very young child. But as someone else said, others might think the same of me!!! They probably think I'm cruel to limit my daughters dummy time :)|`|4VrKKOwnaa	its strange watch this youtube video, it tells the story of a women who breast feeds her kids at 8|`|68c6B8dRaa	Most major health organizations recommend nursing for a MINIMUM of two years. It's hardly aberrant.     It is also, even in the second and third years of life, a valuable source of nutrition and protection from illness.|`|66jX06Onaa	It's a bit unusual, but I've heard of people still nursing their toddlers. It becomes more of a security thing for the child.     I wouldn't care for it, but some moms still like this type of bonding.|`|EMKuBql8aa	People say breastfeeding until 2 is a good thing. My wife only did it for a year.     Just say nothing and look elsewhere, not much else you can do in a situation like that, lol. I agree that it would be uncomfortable.
irLnPW4aaa	I got some from Wal-Mart and others from Target.

Some of them have matching cups, silverware and bowls as well to go with the trays.      I got my son the farm animal design for his valentines day bag I put together for him. It was $3.99.

7VJcd5YLaa	My older daughter lost her first tooth at 6, became loose when she'd just turned five - she was terrified to wiggle it - once she saw an older kid with missing teeth, she really started wiggling it.  She has lost 8 so far - she's nearly 8 now - and she normally just shows me one day that her tooth is loose - and within a week it is out.    My younger daughter has a tooth that is barely loose now - she is 5.  None lost yet.    I don't know if this is true or not - I heard somewhere that the age that the kids get their baby teeth (early or late) will determine the ages that they loose their teeth - if they were an early teether - loose teeth earlier.  My older daughter was a late teether, and a friend of ours has a little boy the same age - hea was early - he has only lost two teeth - so that probably is not completely true.    One way to tell that loose teeth are coming (besides x-rays at the dentist) is most kids start to have larger gaps between their baby teeth in the months right before it is happening.  (I say most kids - my younger daughter does not - her baby teeth are crowded - I see massive braces in her future.)    A trick that we use - get some orajel (teething gel) and put it on the gum before you pull it - it helps with the slight discomfort - but really helps with the anxiety.|`|86pkE9jOaa	My daughter just lost a tooth 3days ago she's 4 turning 5 next week.|`|3w5hiIIEaa	I was six and a half.|`|KLxoWHRZaa	I didn't married and I don't have any child!  but myself lost my first tooth between six and seven.|`|VsGsMhpSaa	i was 4 and a half|`|3Psi4kBxaa	First boy at age 6  Second boy age 7  Third boy age 5 1/2   Fourth boy age 6|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	My daughter was 3yo (she got her fist tooth when she was 6 weeks so it was expected she would lose them early)  and my son had just turned 5yo.

1XAUxQlDaa	You can start transitioning her by introducing the bed to her. I moved my son at 15 months to a toddler bed. Did the same with my daughter who is now 2.5yrs. There's no harm in it. Get a night light and a baby gate for the door and you're set. I didn't even transition my son. We bought the bed and that night he slept in it. And he did great. First 2 nights were a little rough but nothing horrible. I think if you're still hesitant you can introduce it to her. Let her play with it. Teach her how to get on and off. They learn that really fast. If she falls asleep in her crib at nap time move her to the bed. Let her get familiar with it. Try and nap her in it at nap time. And I think by the time your new addition comes she'll be ready. I know how it feels though, kind of sad cause she's going to be in her own bed. I was the same way. But, I just had to do it. I didn't want my son to hurt himself in a crib being that old. It takes consistency with the transition. She will understand what its for once you show her and explain it to her. It takes a lot of repetitive explanation but it works and she will feel more comfortable with it.|`|NI8D46J0aa	My 1st 3 were in a toddler bed at 18 months. They all kept getting stuck ion the slats. My 19 m/o hasn't done that yet, but we do have a bed for her in the same room. She jumps in it for nap time sometimes. Anyways, a lot of people think a toddler bed is a waste, but it is smaller and will use the same mattress as the crib, so she may feel more comfortable.  15 months is still really little, but I bet at 20 months or so she will be ready to switch. We bought one of those LED nightlight that stick to the wall so she won't get out of bed and pull it out. Good luck. I hope it works out for you.|`|HyknHVV5aa	I had this EXACT problem! What worked for my 18 month old was we bought her a big girl bed, pushed it against the wall and put in a safety bed rail. It creates the illusion and safety of the crib since the child is against the wall and with the rail, plus its safe so they don't roll off the bed. We then made the room appealing by putting her favorite toys on the bed and putting in a "cool" nightlight and glow in the dark stars on the roof. By the bed being against the wall, with the rail, plus the cool stars on the roof she was interested and after the first few nights was totally into the big girl bed! But keep the crib stored in the other room so she knows is there, but don't cave and let her sleep in it - and plus that way when the baby is born the crib doesn't just appear and the baby 'stole' it from her.    And we read this book to her for a couple weeks before we brought the big girl bed out, she loved it, and it made her more interested, she kept saying "like book!". http://www.amazon.com/Own-Big-Anna-Gross...|`|avx7bLnKaa	we were in the same situation.... we just did it one day when he was 18 months|`|cUxdsuamaa	Get you youngest a bassinet . She can spend up to 4 months in it.|`|QXSFpMzDaa	You know I'm not sure that moving her out her crib just because you are having another baby is the right reason.  My daughter is almost 2 and is no where near ready.  You need to ask yourself two  questions:    1.  If she wakes up at night is she capable of finding her way to your room without being scared?     2.  If she woke up would you trust her to be safe and not hurt herself.    I know at 2 my daughter is certainly not able to.....I don't know when just not yet.|`|xGedX2rIaa	i think its a good idea to introduce then bed in now. Just set up the toddler bed next to the crib. Leave it set up for a couple of weeks and just let her get useto it, play on it. when you put her down in the crib  tuck one of her toys into the bed. Start her off slowly, maybe just naps during the day time so when she walkes up she  knows where she is.  Or if she falls asleep in the cot move her into the bed.      or you can do it cold turkey, it might be a bad couple of days, but she will soon learn that this is now where she sleeps.    Oh i also forgot get a night light and a baby gate for her beedroom door so if she gets up during the nighth she cant hurt herself
2G8lOPN8aa	Yes, it sounds like it could be broken.  You won't rest until you take him in for an x-ray to check it out.      When my oldes was nearly 2, we were at a children's store where they had a music video playing on a television on top of a dais...and he was listening to the music--swaying back and forth, and he lost his footing and fell down the stairs backwards... He cried for a few moments and seemed fine...I saw no swelling...and it didn't seem to bother him--he kept using the arm.  I called the pediatrician and they said if it swelled up or if he seemed in pain the next day to bring him in... but he seemed fine... but a few days later he fell and put his hand down to break his fall and he cried in obvious pain... there was no swelling.    I brought him in for xrays anyway and full expected them to come out and tell me he was fine and that I was just an over protective mom--but he DID have a buckle fracture.  He was casted and he had to wear it for about 2 weeks.      My daugher was running through our front yard when whe was 5 and she tripped and fell on her arm... it really pained her terribly...so of course I took her in. The orthapedist could not be sure if it was broken or not based on the xrays--but given the location and consistency of her pain--he recommended a cast.  It wasn't until she had it off 3 weeks later and had the follow up xray that showed knew bone that he was able to say for sure that she did indeed sustain a hairline fracture.      So I say for sure get it checked out... I never had a broken bone in my 40 years...but my two older kids have managed to have them pretty early on in life...|`|gGW7K9U5aa	Id take him to either an urgent care facility or the ER. It might just be sprained, but better safe than sorry.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	You mean sprained??    You need to take him to the urgent care right now.  He is in some kind of pain and needs medical attention.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Take him to the hospital either way! They can figure it out and help him feel better.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Take him in, he might have a hairline fracture. Better to be safe then sorry cause not treating a broken bone can cause serious problems with how his arm develops.     Good Luck.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	take him to the ER before he injures it more.    and unless you have safety gates on the bed, it's not safe for a frisky 1 year old.|`|avx7bLnKaa	just take him to the ER or a pediatric urgent care|`|uD7zgtcfaa	TAKE HIM TO A DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY!

Good luck.|`|9FbcLKsfaa	Take him to the er just to be safe.|`|5JB1fHz9aa	He could have popped it out of the socket.  My little sister did that when she was well under a year (not exactly sure how she did it) but every time someone touched her arm she would cry so my mom and step dad took her to the ER and the doctor just popped it back in.|`|aT7HgLJnaa	Take him to the ER. they'll be able to tell you if its broken, sprained or whatever but with a fall like that and it hurting him like you say it is he really ought to have a doctor look at it.

One of the names I really like that's similar is Laura Elisabeth.    Finley Isabel: I don't think it flows as well as it could but I love your spelling of Isabel, it's really pretty and less common than "Isabelle" I also like the spelling, Isobel. I'd try Finley Grace instead :)    Corrina Grace: This name is so cute, my best friend and I were combining our names into one to make one for our sim girl and we came up with this one. (except we spelled it with a K because my friend's name started with K) Grace balances it out since one name is modern and the others old-fashioned. I like it.    Connor Joseph: I love the name Connor, it's so cute and Irish sounding, one of my favorite boy's names ever is Connor Michael, you and I have very similar taste.    James Kale: I love James, it's really masculine and solid, I don't really like Kale all together but I can see where you're coming from will spelling. I think Kail, or Cale would be fine too.    Ethan Clark: This name is cute, I think Clark kind of sounds like the last name in the combo but it's fine all the same. My nephew's name is Ethan Kent :)    Vote on my name list??    http://www.babynames.com/namelist/968520...|`|UDSn7k6Oaa	For a girl I like to mix and match the names so I think it should be Isabella Grace.|`|XKEHtvg8aa	They r all really good names! but Finley is a little werid. probably becasue i am pronouncing it wrong.. its unique though...|`|HHzJmBaRaa	James Kale is kinda cute. Ive actually seen people spell it as "Cale".|`|n91Wf2jeaa	Finley in a girl  I like Kail but not so much james.  So I'm going to say Ethan.|`|N5EhfDX2aa	LEAH ELIZABETH i dont like it because the sound of leah and elizabeth has to many similarities. it doesnt flow.  FINLEY ISABEL Cute name. Love the F you dont usually see F's. and it has a girly suffix -ley and i love how youve used Isabel as a middle name as apposed to a first name and as apposed to the common Isabella.  CORRINA GRACE Dont like Corrina, what about Cassia? Grace is too common why not make it Gracelyn?    CONNOR JOSEPH Its okay. Connor is way too common and Joseph is an excellent name. What about Joseph Conroy?  JAMES KALE Great.I agree with the spelling though. What about Kael or Kail? I like James Kael; it looks exotic.  ETHAN CLARK I dont like this much only because of someone i know called Ethan and my countries previous prime minister was clark and i ant like her! What about Eidan said like Aidan? Eidan Clive     My two favourites would be Finley Isabel and James James Kael     Good Luck!|`|3iGoYk0Saa	girls    1  3  2    Boys  3  2  1 Ethan Clark is a wonderful name!!!

You didn't, but in case you consider it, I would not do Isabel as a first name since bell names are so popular. It was nice of you to give her a unique first and a common middle.    I love Kale as middle for a guy. I don't know about James on it's own, it flows well with Kale though.     I vote  1 = finley isabel  2 Corrina Grace  Boy....I like Kale . The rest are basic, sturdy guys names that you won't do wrong naming your child.|`|ayBzdRK7aa	ummm i'm not big on the name finley or corrina.

Corrina Grace- I like, it sounds feminine, but Corrina isn't too common, so it balances the too common Grace.    Connor Joseph is again, kind of blah.    James Kale is ok. You could spell it Cale, Cail, Cayle, Kail, or Kayle..though the Y makes it look feminine to me.    Ethan Clark is my favorite of the choices!

PrxlHUT5aa	lol kids... nobody can ever define them... he probably isn't tired anymore... and 9hours of sleep at night is enough for him... can you ask him to snuggle with you in bed for the next, say 30-45 mins so you can catch on some snooze... that's what I do when my daughter wakes up a tad early for my preference... might work for you... maybe :o)|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	My best guess would be he's going through a growth spurt and perhaps is waking up hungry.  He may also be teething, can you see any molars coming through?|`|PLgNsOF9aa	Has he gotten in all his teeth he will be getting for a while? All the fronts and one yr molars? If not he may be getting them and then they sometimes wake up early and cant go back to sleep like usual.   Does he want a drink first thing? Try putting a sippy cup in his bed and when he wakes up he may take it and fall back to sleep. If not then there is nothing you can do. My toddler went thru all sorts of different waking schedules. Sometimes i used to get to sleep till nearly 9 then it went back to 6 for the longest time and then now its currently at 7:30 but a couple weeks ago he was waking up at 8:00. So one never knows but jsut wait he'll be waking up later soon.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	i know how you feel babe... guess its part of our job description haha|`|oNzCYGFHaa	the book I reference for the sleep problems we encounter says to ignore the behavior until his regular wake up time.  So that means get a gate on his door and don't answer to him until the 7 oclock time.  It also says that you can get a digital clock and tell him when it say 7 0 0 he can get up, although I think he maybe a little young for that.  Thats a tough one, hope it works out for you!!|`|f3JUERf5aa	How long has your son been in a toddler bed?  Could it be the new found joy of when he wakes up he knows he can find you to get up and play with him?  I won't take my 15 month old out of the crib yet because she wakes up from time to time in the middle of the night and will play for a few minutes then go back to sleep.  We don't rush in there at the first sounds of her waking up, we wait until she starts to get aggravated or cries..  Is he used to you checking on him when he wakes up?  Maybe he thinks you are supposed to be there when he wake up...|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Get up at 5:15 and go in his room and see if something is going on in there that is waking him up. I made a huge mistake when I got my apartment here with a bus stop right out side my son's window (mine too) so when the buses start in the morning, their breaks and the *pshhpshh* sound they make when they leave wake him up......every single morning. And if that doesn't do it. The lady upstairs takes a shower at like 6am and it wakes him up too because the pipes that go down to the sewage are behind his closet........find out what is waking him up (if anything). If nothing is waking him up, then make him lay there until it's time to get up and hopefully he will get used to it.    Good Luck :
AA10978023	It is true. While many women with low hcg hormone will go on to have perfectly normal babies, and a low hcg level in early pregnancy is perfectly healthy, some women with chronically low hcg levels will go on to miscarry. Hcg is required to support a developing pregnancy, and ongoing inadequate levels of hcg can cause an embryo to be miscarried. However, how much hcg is required to maintain a pregnancy is different for every woman, so not all women will miscarry but it is more likely.|`|kUCVLuTPaa	no..just because you dont produce alot of the "pregnant" hormones doesn't mean you will miscarry

74pfB2Bnaa	My baby had always blankets, that is she had crocheted receiving blankets, which are easy to breath through and do not pose a suffocation hazard. I do not allow her any other yet. She is ten months old.   Once my daughter was able to sit, at six moths, I allowed her to have some toys in her bed. Sometimes she falls asleep holding her little doll, which is very sweet.|`|83j1ThU7aa	my son is 4 months i been givng him a blanket in his bed cause even though we have the heater on in our room it sometimes gets cold. what you do is put the blanket from chest down or tuck it under and let the arms out he still sometimes pulls the blanket up and plays with it but he makes alot of noise so i always check up on him..|`|QdP4UKxyaa	my daughter is 10 wks and I put a blanket in her bed that she sleeps on and I kinda loosely wrap her in it...she kickes it off mostly|`|A4tmVI4Jaa	Many babies who die from SIDS or suffocation are found on their stomach with their faces covered by soft bedding such as blankets and pillows. For this reason, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that you keep blankets out of your baby's crib until he's at least 12 months old. After this age, the statistical likelihood of dying from SIDS plummets. The risk of suffocation also goes down because most 12-month-olds are able to roll over and have the dexterity to move blankets away from their face.    If you do decide to use a blanket, choose a thin one and tuck it firmly around both sides and one end of the crib mattress. Place your baby under the blanket so his feet and lower half are covered, but his upper chest and head are exposed (tuck the blanket under his arms, across his nipples).|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I've always used a blanket with my son. He's 8 months old and he has a snuggle bear that he sleeps with. I keep the blanket tucked in and its never posed a problem.|`|4vpK2qFYaa	I had her yesterday but i will give her a blanket at 9 or 10 months|`|waUHzOlXaa	I THINK U SHOULD DECIDE THAT,IF YOUR BABY ISN'T READY && CANT TAKE OFF A BLANKET OUT OF HIS/HER FACE THEN HE/SHE IS NOT READY YET! GOOD LUCK! =]|`|JsqMSU9Haa	I'm on the more conservative side - I do it after a year.  I use those sleep blankets until then so there's no issue of being cold.  And when I use a blanket, it's not a thick, large one. :)|`|jgp0FUzNaa	My son has had a blanket since he was born.  He's always wrapped up in it, so it can't cover his face.  He's wrapped from about his nipples and down.  He's just started to figure out how to roll over while he's wrapped.  He's a smart cookie!|`|mrVA6Hbsaa	At Consumer Reports, weve long been advocates of not putting a blanket or anything cushy, including stuffed animals, a sleep positioner, or crib bumpers or pillows, in a babys crib. Soft items in the crib are a suffocation hazard. It doesnt sound cozy, but with cribs, Bare is best.     Still, Ive gotten questions from some parents wondering about how long that advice applies. After your babys first birthday, for example, the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome drops. Can you put a blanket in the crib then?     The answer is still no. Here's what Laura Reno, vice president of public affairs for First Candle/SIDS Alliance said, when asked whether it was safe to put a blanket in a crib after a child turns a year old. "We would never recommend putting a blanket in a crib. Save the blankets for when a child moves into a toddler bed. Use wearable blankets, sleep sacks, sleepers, or anything along those lines just to keep them warm without having to put loose blankets in there."    Of course, your child can still have a traditional, fluffy baby blanket before he moves to a toddler bed. (Thats a move youll want to make as soon as he can climb out of the crib.) Just keep it out of the crib. A baby blanket makes a nice play mat or exercise pad for tummy time under your watchful supervision, and theres nothing like it when you two want to curl up in the glider with a good baby book (or two or three) before nap and bedtime.    When shopping for a wearable blanket with lots of leg room for stretching and kicking--which goes over a regular sleeper and diaper--look for a flame-resistant fabric, such as polyester. You can buy as many as four, and buy more as needed. Wearable blankets also come in swaddle form for infants, as an alternative to receiving blankets. They retail for about $15 to $20.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	my dd will sleep in sleepsacks until i can't find one to fit her, LOL; i even have scoped out the ones with leg holes for mobile toddlers...i think most suggest two in their toddler bed, but i am paranoid and i figure she will stay warmer  anyway if she can't kick it off in the night....even after that, if it  is cold, i would probably dress her really warm so she could have a light blanket.....scared of the thicker ones....i know i am paranoid, motherhood has done that to me....|`|ed45267264b8e14db51a0d554e40d2a3aa	When my son was born he came everything was fine.|`|qBl9ShJBaa	i gave my son who is 9 month old a blanket when he was 2 months old.|`|QXSFpMzDaa	I distinctively remember my daughter starting to have a blanket at around 7mths when she was in the hospital due to surgery.  I would definitely not give a baby a blanket until they start turning over|`|gGW7K9U5aa	My daughter is 8 months old and I started to give her a blanket about 2 weeks ago. She does good with it. When I lay her down, I make sure the blanket it from the top of her belly and no further up. Shes done good with it. Its usually kicked off her by morning though.

If there is no bleeding you're good to go:)  Good Luck!|`|mBeGdFO2aa	slight cramping is normal :)  I asked my dr when I had them around 12 weeks along.  He said not to worry unless there was also bleeding or they were really painful.
0qP8gLpyaa	call the school and ask if there is a time you could meet with the teacher and find out what's going on.  Transferring isn't the answer because there is no guarantee that another school in district would be any better or worse than where she is now.    If it is a problem somehow involving your child find out if she is doing something to contribute to it. Even at 6 that kind of thing is possible where something is being done by the child who is the appeared victim that causes some of it- but not always. Usually talking with the teacher will clue you in on what's going on.    Talk to her and give her some strategies to help when this kind of thing happens and what she can do.  Giving her a plan of action to follow may help her confidence a little more when things like this happen. It's unfortunate when kids bully, tease and pick on each other. They can be so cute and yet so mean all at the same time whether or not they realize what they are doing.  I guess that's why they say kids are brutally honest.. they are!|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	I used to get upset at being "it" in tag, my crayon broke, someone stole my idea. Hell, I remember crying when kids wouldn't share their frigging dunkaroo's with me. It goes day by day, especially at that age. I'm sure your daughter has some friends- she can't be socially inept at 6 years old and if there was a huge problem you would be contacted by the school. If you're THAT concerned, call to speak with the teacher about your issues but otherwise, I wouldn't worry about it. It's just part of growing up. Definately don't transfer her if it's not necessary! I'm sure she'll be just fine.|`|h6STaCmNaa	I think that she should either switch schools or have a talk with some of the kids parents and also have a talk with the teacher cause she should do something about it!!! If you dont want to do any of these things then try on show and tell day ( if they have it) have her bring in something really cool that ALL the kids will be interested in, like an animal or awesome toy!!!|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	When my son was 6 he told me he was being bullied by a kid at school, my son was a green belt in Tae Kwon Do and I told him that if he was getting hurt and asked the kid to stop and the kid didn't then he was allowed to "stop" the kid from hurting him.  The problem, my son was telling me a story, it wasn't happening.  He wasn't trying to lie, he just needed a bit of attention and didn't' understand how awful I was feeling about it.    If you are concerned you need to contact the teacher, she can tell you if your daughter is really having social problems or if she is just has a good imagination.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Talk to the teacher and find out exactly what is going on.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	You need to ask for a meeting with her teacher.   That way the teacher can fill you in on all the right details, of whats going on.  Depending how long this has been going on, it may be able to be solved quickly.  Otherwise, sometimes she may have to transfer, that usually will no have to happen.  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher Canada )
jgDlkSiWaa	She could be teething.   She could be sick.  What she is doing is self limiting.    I would start getting concerned about dehydration.   Is she running a fever? Vomiting? Diarrhea?   I would contact the dr if you can't get any more liquids in her.     We had the same issue with the flu a few days ago.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Is she really fussy?  Is she running a fever?  Is she showing signs of teething?  If she's really eaten that little I would probably take her to the doctor.  Could be nothing serious, but you don't want her to get dehydrated.|`|gGW7K9U5aa	Thats not normal. I would definitely call the pedi and tell them whats going on.|`|avx7bLnKaa	well you said she's eatten an oz here and there and if she is peeing she should be okay to take to the dr in the morning to get checked out... if worried go to ER or pediatric urgent care|`|cEXzXkqnaa	Some babies go through spurts of eating and sleeping...as long as she is in good spirits, don't worry about it...   Dr.s usually say, try to thing about their diet weekly instead of daily...as long as she has had a few reallllllly good days in a week, she should be fine!!|`|LDYAGJCxaa	It sounds like she's coming down with something.  My babies did that when they had a sore throat or ear infection.  Try giving her some infant Tylenol,  wait about half an hour for it to kick in and then try to feed her again.  I would take her in to see the Dr. tomorrow.  If they don't see you right away and if she's still not eating, then go to an urgent care facility or the ER.  You don't want her to go to long without eating.  Hope that helps and hope she feels better!  :)|`|7bce4e9a8a758bb2099c48e935a0b458aa	My daughter just went through this phase and when I went to the ER, they told me that she was teething and to give her pedialite (sp?) to keep her hydrated. If she doesn't eat any more tonight I would take her to the dr just to make sure that she doesn't have a virus. But it just sounds like her teeth are about to come in to me.|`|AA12339815	This is not normal i think you should take her to your local doctor to get her check over because something could be wrong if she is not eating or sleeping. Here are some tips  after you bath your baby get some baby oil and rub her tummy and back to relaxe her then maybe give her some warm water she might have wind in her tummy
TqWXXZ34aa	NO there is nothing wrong with it. However if would sterilize the massage be4 use. Or put something over the massage part like Saran wrap.  You chapped there from the massage. I would suggest using lotion or KYjellie.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	No serious health effects.|`|QKGuNLb4aa	umm well i dont think that there would be any developmental delays but you could get a fungus..... so make sure its clean b4 you use it
H6LxeWZfaa	yes!  as long as you're exercizing while using it.  im a verrry athletic girl and i take a protein shake everyday after i get home from practice or get done working out.  it helps rebuild damaged muscle, while means help you tone easier and keep in shape.  it doesnt make you bulk up or anything, only if youre taking like 10 full scoop shakes a day.  good choice for staying healthy!|`|PlmT4lHXaa	I think those things have to legally state if they can be harmful to persons under the age of 18.. so read the bottle.|`|MigBOiUPaa	if you read the lable it will probably say do not take if u arer under 18 years of age or something like tht. if not then ask ur doctor.|`|Gr0UGqZiaa	yes|`|c55O7jqXaa	Well if you do try it do only half the dosage. Dont take the adult strength.|`|9acXPi8gaa	Ask your mom or doctor about it. (Don't trust what people say on Y!A, who knows if they're correct?) Do you really need protein supplements?
e39a79f6daf722c960330aea2db67b78aa	The correct diagnosis of gender by ultrasound at 20 weeks is VERY accurate, somewhere around 95%. But, don't go in all gung-ho.. sometimes baby doesn't cooperate and won't show off. As long as the parts are visible, when the tech says "I don't see anything to indicate that it's a boy.", then you can be very confident that it's a girl.|`|rl1IITqRaa	My boy was a very obvious boy at 19 weeks. As long as they can get the baby in the right position they will most likely be able to tell. Drink some caffeine 30 mins before, my doc recommended that to me, I did it, and he was movin alllllll over the place so eventually they caught him with his legs open. haha.    Congrats on ur baby!!!!|`|dvoelIXIaa	Yes if they get a good shot at the baby's part. :) And well of course if your baby cooperates|`|fMnzjULCaa	Yes, I found out mine at 18 weeks & I'm due the same day as you. Mine is a boy. It's soooo exciting to find out!|`|k0QRfQ00aa	Yeah sometimes if the baby isn't positioning where there is no view. I was told  to drink a lot of water before the u/s. A full bladder raises the baby out of the hip area making it easier for the u/s tech to see  the baby clearer. Congrats.|`|rymbwVKXaa	yes as long as the baby cooperates.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Yes.  Unless your baby's being difficult they can tell.|`|ZTYRpAvyaa	They sure can.  We just found out ours last Thursday and my wife is due June 10.  Good luck!
k0QRfQ00aa	Apparently his daughter is going through a phase of not being the only child anymore as well. Kids are so preceptive when it comes to us adults they know when we don't know. It isn't too much that you ask him to take her for a while just explain your needs to him and I am sure he will do just that because he loves you and you obviously need the rest. Get well soon!!|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	No that's not being mean, what you're asking is quite reasonable & daddy needs to be a bit more involve in matters at hand. I would have cussed his butt out to. He's not very understanding is he, gosh man you have swelling & back pain & you still have to toggle with the housework & his toddler while he spends his time with a snowmobile, not fair. If he's not going to spend time with her why have her over....ohh rite so you can look after her, selfish if you ask me|`|8THz1sp9aa	I don't think you are asking too much at all. You are busy taking care of a child inside of you and that really does wear us out!! I wouldn't have yelled at him, but maybe asked him nicely to talk. I would tell him your sorry, and the truth about what's going on and how you really need a moments peace. Everyone can take so much before they snap, I sure hope he understands. Good luck.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Absolutely not! You need to relax! Asking him to take care of his kid is not too much at all, it;s not right for him to expect you to do everything while you're pregnant. Tell him to get off his *** and do something to help YOU!|`|15UZwW2laa	No he needs to get a grip.  I think he also needs to help you with the cooking and cleaning too.  My husband is a head chef at a very ritzy restaurant and cooks all day and I'm a stay at home mom.  He still helps me with the cooking and cleaning.|`|DutTBV3caa	not at all! you're working and running the household while he sits out in the garage. the LEAST he could do is watch his daughter! its good for you to spend time with her, of course, but like i said, you're doing more then you should when he does very little. dont feel bad at all for needing time to relax.|`|1whTwTbDaa	No...you are not asking too much...HE IS! He knows that his daughter is not your responsibility, its his visit. Your doing enough by having his second child...that's all you could be expected to do right now. He needs to spend time with his daughter, get a job, and stop playing with toys! He sounds extremely childish!|`|CDmGlLXCaa	no job and all he cares about is a snowmobile race..great pick|`|xlcKBMw7aa	heck no you're not asking too much....she's not your kid (not that you don't love her, but the love you have for your own is different) and he should realize that she needs him....stupid snowmobile race? GROW UP|`|rl1IITqRaa	NO! You aren't asking too much. He's being inconsiderate. You need rest. I woulda yelled too. He needs to let you rest. Go yell at him again!!!!|`|2ea0131ea655753572f33b84f26cdfffaa	Guys get into a groove. They get comfortable.  If they can get away with it, they will (and they'll go through some great lengths to get away with things.)  So it is SO normal for guys to shirk responsibility because most guys are raised knowing that the mother/wife does EVERYTHING.  So you need to lay down some ground rules.  No, it isn't too much to ask, but yes,it is easier said than done.      I know it sounds bad, but you have to train him. That little girl is HIS daughter first and foremost so he can grow up, stop playing in the garage and preparing for his little game and take some grown-up daddy responsibility.|`|u7ALmspMaa	I dont think you are, at all!  I mean, there are ways and ways of saying the things, yelling is not always the best solution, but man, does it feel goooood!!  Besides, you are in a very sensitive period right now, with the hormones wars, and he should pay attention to you, to your pain, your feelings and cook and clean!! And of course take care of the little girl, specially if shes having a rough time accepting you, he should try to make it smooth between you guys, good luck!

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Cut sample spots out of the wall anywhere there was mold, in the bathroom, and under each window.  You may find mold in the walls.  Particularly consider its environmental if you or your husband is tired or more sick.    Also consider that there is something in the ducts or furnace    Can you afford to properly insulate the house?|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	I agree that there is probably more mold that is hiding behind the walls or somewhere.  A cold house does not make one sick but mold, even if he isn't allergic to it, can make babies and children quite sick.     My cousin moved into a house about a year ago and ever since her two kids have had all kinds of breathing problems.  Ends up that when a new roof was put on years before they moved in they did not put one thing on that makes the water run away from the house so it was actually running back into through the walls and insulation and created a nasty mold problem.  They had no idea.    If you don't feel right taking samples of the wall yourself than you need to get a qualified inspector to look at it.    Good luck.|`|XHFj2IVhaa	Have you considered that there might be mold in the house, or that he doesn't have a cold, but allergies? Maybe you should try an antihistamine... And have the house tested for mold...|`|MtKqi5VBaa	I'm so sorry your little boy is sick. My daughter didn't get sick until she was 10 months old and it was such a nightmare for the both of us.    As for the house, that's a tough one. I'm wondering would he have been getting this sick in your old residence? I mean, if this is something that's going to happen every winter, then maybe you should consider doing something with the heating, and worst case scenario, move again? Besides, space heaters eat up so much power and can be dangerous.|`|iTXnHiwTaa	Get an air purifier! Its not the cold that makes him sick, its viruses floating around. Also, get a humidifier for his little nose. A warm air one will also warm up his room a little (just be sure to keep out of his reach). I got a two in one combo for my twins - they were waking up with boogies all the time b/c the electric heat/furnace dries out nasal passages... which all makes him more vulnerable to catch a cold. Another plus? The gentle hum helps lull him  to sleep and keep him asleep. We wound up getting one for our bedroom too and I've been waking up feeling so much better. They can get pricey but I SWEAR its made such a difference. (My husband usually gets sick a lot too but not this year - we live in Canada - it's cold a lot!) hope this helps!|`|3Hm5eJfVaa	Cold weather or a cold house does NOT make one sick.  The common cold is caused by a virus. More than 200 different viruses are known to cause the common cold. Just because you cleaned the house and cleaned the mold doesn't mean the mold is gone. Because you said there was mold present makes me think their is still mold in the house. i know first hand that mold can make you very sick. Especially young children.   Broad classes of reactions to allergenic, pathogenic, or toxic mold, allergens, and other indoor gases or particles  Allergic Reactions - rhinitis, sinusitis, asthma, skin problems, other   Pathogenic - Produce Infections   Mold Smell Illnesses - headaches, vomiting, nausea, blocked noses, and asthmatic [MVOC's--DF]   Toxic Illnesses - produced by mycotoxins:  Respiratory Illnesses -   Digestive Tract Illnesses - liver diseases: fibrosis and necrosis; vomiting, diarrhea, intestinal bleeding   Reproductive Illnesses - infertility, variations in reproductive and hormonal cycle   Highly Serious Illnesses - Cancer, Tuberculosi, Lupus, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), Chronic Fatigue Disorder (CFS), ,  I wouldn't take any chances. If i were you I would hire a proffesional to come and inspect your home. If your child has seen a doctor sevral times and is not responding to treatment something is wrong. And add to that the fact that colds are caught because of a viruis not cold air.|`|bWu4p5OBaa	My SIL had the same thing, it ended up being mold behind the walls. Get an inspector to check it out...    She moved and her kids got better...    I'm sorry that this has put a damper on your new move to your new house.    Hope all gets better!|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Just the cold wont make you sick.  Only contact with germs, and viruses can get you sick.  And even then he won't keep getting sick from the same thing.  Do you take him out in public a lot?  Are other children going near him, or do you have other children?  Could your husband possibly be bringing home germs?  All this would make a difference, but your house just being cold would not make him sick.  Being in the cold you'll get a runny nose, but it's not actually being sick, if you get what I mean.|`|M5E3mDBJaa	Have you thought about getting some more space heaters, turning up the thermostat or having your furnace inspected/replaced?      If the house being really cold is what is causing him to be sick, the logical remedy would be - make it warmer.|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	It's just that time of year and it happens. I thought breastfeeding and keeping my baby out of daycare would magically make her immune to everything but I was wrong.  She has been sick for weeks, first congestion, fever, rashes, ear infection, now diarrhea.  Having a sick baby is the worst.  The only benefit is that they are super cuddly!|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Get heavier curtains to block the windows and use towels or blankets to block the bottom of the doors to help keep the cold out. Do this in your room to with the heater. Block off any part of the house you don't use to help keep the heat centralized. My son is sick right now to so I know the feeling. Hope it gets warmer soon!

But everyone is different just hope and pray... This is my second month of taking my first round and I get the heartburn upset stomach and diarrhea, but only a few out of the 5 days... There isn't much else that I have had to change or to do.... IT pretty much does everything itself.... Just have fun making that baby....    TO CUT DOWN ON THE SIDE EFFECTS TAKE YOUR CLOMID RIGHT BEFORE GOING TO BED WITH A FULL GLASS OF WATER..... :D     The only thing I will warn you about is that the clomid can make your cervical mucus acidic and it will kill the sperm try taking robitussin the recommended dosage and drinking a full glass of water after taking the robitussin... Start this 5 das before ovulation and it will be in your systom and be there before and after ovulation....  AND DRINK LOTS OF WATER IT HELPS THE PH OF YOUR CERVICAL MUCUS      HOPE THAT HELPS GOOD LUCK....HOPE YOU GET PREGNANT
jX5ooZdnaa	Yes, anytime you switch birth control methods or even just switch from one brand to another you can become pregnant. Now with that being said, it's unlikely that you will just from when you said you did it due to the fact you were not likely ovulating.

aES89pvwaa	Very well could be I was having those same cramps.. thought I was about to start my period and my boobs started to hurt and went out and got a test came up positive!|`|WaM9vafqaa	did you ever think that it is not a good move to have sex if you did not want to get preggo think about it this is the way we humans have offspring next time before you do it think do you want kids if not keep your legs closed and take a cold shower alone you people think i will just have sex it will be okay if he puts it in a little bit get a life and pay attention in biology class|`|JsshzKM9aa	You wouldn't get cramping this early.|`|6N9eV8IGaa	what the hell does "a little bit" mean? i think it would take longer then a week for signs|`|n91Wf2jeaa	This happened to me and my girlfriend twice even a little bit puts you at risk, both times she freaked out and both times she was not pregnant. best thing is to wait and stay calm stress can cause your cycle to be late' and after two weeks take a test.|`|3HNP3BoKaa	It could be. I'm 5 weeks pregnant at the moment. And I started getting little cramps (not like period cramps) a few days before my period was due. Which I thought was my period coming on. After 3 days of waiting for my period I took a test and it came up positive! I'd wait until your period is due, then after a few days if it still hasnt come, then I'd take a test. If you're still unsure, go to the doctors for a blood test.
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    These symptoms your having sound exactly the same as that i had early on in my first pregnancy.  I had a yellowish discharge which was kind of thick, but odorless.  Had exactly the same with the breasts very sore and heavy    I really do feel that you will get a bfp friday, bearing in mind, it depends on how long your body takes to produce high hcg levels, my body took 5 weeks until i found i was pregnant, doctors just said my body took a little longer than others.    Good luck and hope you get the results you want xxx|`|ihBFGugIaa	Sounds like someone is pregnant to me.......... I wish you luck.|`|IxG2SMlEaa	Yes this could be it. Given that your cycle is late and u had sex prior. keep in mind hoping that this is it could be causing a delay for AF. This happened to me last month where I had a thick discharge first yellow in color and then brown. But come to find out it was AF coming. But good luck and baby dust to u!!!|`|DWvnIYTEaa	there is definitely a chance! Either it be PMS symptoms and maybe you are just late due to stress or whatever, or it could be BABYTIME. YAY! If you're already late,really you could test tomorrow AM. Im never patient enough to wait. :) Good luck and tons of baby dust
JudkC72Aaa	"He point to letters and numbers and say them."  The apple doesn't fall from the tree, huh?|`|Gr7My8FTaa	no but he will learn in preschool even though i never went|`|AFi5kTiEaa	sounds like he has a speech delay.  He probably will talk on his own but if you want to speed along the process, which in my opinion you should. he will be going to preschool soon, if not already and if you get him some speech therepy they will teach him how to speek more.|`|JmNs0Hgbaa	albert einstein said his FIRST word when he was three.  your son might be a gifted genius too, you know..|`|GHHMfGD0aa	Your son is fine. By the age of three children should not be putting together 4-5 word sentences. However, he should be able to say a few things, like,  i want drink, i need potty, etc. Another thing is language skills are dependent on how much you talk. Perhaps, if you talk to him more, he will speak more. All in all, he should be fine. Have him watch cartoons that are targeted for language skills and talk as much as you can.|`|heqVgZhsaa	Funny you should ask that... I had my sis thinking the same about her 3 yo! My neighbour also said that she was worried that her little boy rarely speaks. To be honest I think it is totally normal. I have four children and they all progressed differently... My eldest would just say one word until she was over three (over and over again!), she is 16 now and all is fine with her. Two of them would gabble on  from about 2 and a half making no sense at all... I think they were trying to talk like their elder sister :) The littlest one didn't really say anything unless she had something 'important' to say. They now range from 16 right down to 9 years old and have all developed into chatterboxes! Im sure your little boy is fine, He will talk when he is ready and will probably drive you nuts!
dvoelIXIaa	She will have your guys baby. If the baby does not come out a week after its due date they induce the labor. So you have a huge time span. No worries she will have the baby in that time frame.|`|cWP73qEsaa	ok to be honest due dates aren't all that accurate. take me for instance i was due november 27 and i had the baby november 8th! 3 weeks early. and my other 2 kids were one week early and 2 weeks early. also she can go into post term which is more than 40 weeks it all depends on what the baby wants not the doctor. unless your doctor knows if they are going to induce labor on a certain date ( not recommended before the 37 week period. or if she is a cesarean section for sure those are the only ways to know exactly.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	The due date is just an educated guess. She could be a week early or a week late. Depends on when the baby is ready to arrive.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Sounds pretty accurate.|`|eemmWU0Haa	Only 5 % of woman have there babies on there due date so I'd say its slim...My twin sister had her baby 4 days b4 her due date!|`|ebCzRLw7aa	They will NOT let her get on a air plane in the last 3 months of her pregnancy.|`|mBeGdFO2aa	I had the same thing happen to me.  My original due date was Jan23, now it's Feb2 bases on my 21 week ultrasound.  What my dr said was because the baby was uniformally approx 10 days smaller than normal he was going to change the due date....plus add the fact that I became pregnant while on the pill, that can change your ovulation timing.  And Jan23 has come and gone and still no baby....I'm thinking it'll be my new due date, maybe even later!!!    So basically I would go with what your doctor says, they'll have the best educated guess, although that's still all it is :)|`|AuVtUjVAaa	the due date is an estimate. She could deliver 2 weeks before or 2 weeks after her due|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Not very accurate.  There's a lot of variety in size of a fetuses at that time.  There's no telling when you wife will deliver.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	No fever, no sinus pain, no really unwell signs, no gut feeling something is wrong -no doctor.  And I live in a country with free health care.    Are you breastfeeding?  Put a bunch of breastmilk up her nose before you suction and it will loosen things, reduce inflammation, and kill bacteria, viruses, and fungi.  Put a drop or two in each ear 2-4 times a day to help prevent ear infections.    Immune boosting foods like vitamin C, garlic, ginger, etc if possible.  As much fluid as possible (spoon feeding liquids may be more effective, including breastmilk.  Still nurse as much as she wants but extra fluids thin mucous which should make her feel better).    http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/T081000...  3. The common cold virus can cause green nasal secretions and a junky sounding cough. Decades ago it was commonly felt that a green nose, productive cough or a rattling chest meant there was a bacterial infection. This belief led to a severe over-use of antibiotics, which in turn has allowed the bacteria that cause ear infections, sinus infections and pneumonia to become tougher and more resistant to antibiotics. Now we know that green or junky does not necessarily mean a bacterial infection. Viruses can also cause this.     [...]    6. The common cold can take two courses:        * First scenario. Your child starts off with a clear runny nose for a few days, and then she begins coughing slightly. Over the next few days the nose turns from clear, to white, to yellow, then to green. She can't breathe through her nose. The cough worsens and starts to wake her up at night. About 5 to 7 days into the illness her cough begins to sound junky, you hear some rattling in her chest, and she gets a fever. She may complain of sore throat, headache and stomach ache at this time. The fever lasts for 3 to 5 days yet is seldom higher than 102o. The fever then goes away, but the green nose and junky cough continue. Between 5-7 days the nose starts to seem less thick and green, but the junky cough continues. Over the next week, the nose clears up more, the cough improves slightly, but she still has episodes of junky cough off and on. After about three weeks into the illness the cough quiets down and eventually goes away by four weeks.        * Second scenario. Out of nowhere your child is hit with a high fever, bad cough, headache, sore throat, and runny or stuffy nose. She may have some vomiting or diarrhea, and her sleeping and eating patterns will be poor. The fever, cough, green nose, night waking and poor appetite continue for 3 to 5 days, then the fever stops. The coughing and green nose continues. Slowly, over a period of 2 weeks the nose begins to clear, the coughing lessens, the appetite returns, and she begins to sleep better at night. After 3 or 4 weeks total, the cough is gone and everything is back to normal.        * While these scenarios sound worse and may last longer than many colds, they are well within the boundaries of what can be expected during the course of the common cold virus. By understanding what should be expected from the common cold, you can decide more accurately when to take your child to the doctor, and when to stay home and ride it out. It may be tough to ride it out through the above worst-case cold scenarios. However, if your child is generally acting well when the fever is down, does not have fever lasting more than 5 days (5 complete 24-hour periods), does not have respiratory distress (such as shortness of breath, moderate to severe wheezing, rapid breathing, or chest pains), and overall seems to be okay, then you don't always need to see a doctor. We will discuss later what signs to watch for that warrant a trip to the doctor.          Dr. Sears Suggests: When cold symptoms worsen after 5 days or do not improve after 10 days consider your child may have a sinus infection and should be examined by a doctor.        * The main point of these two scenarios is to help parents understand that antibiotics are not necessary for most common colds and coughs. I do recommend you see your doctor if your child has a fever over 103 degrees for 3 or more days. He may not need antibiotics yet for his green nose and junky cough, but your doctor will decide if antibiotics are necessary after examining your child to see if a bacterial infection is present.|`|EMKuBql8aa	I would chill, we all get sick sometimes, even babies, lol.    Just watch for ear tugging, besides that, she is eating, peeing ok...stay home and save yourself the money.|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	if it's been going on for over a week, i'd probably call and ask to speak with the doctor. explain everything and he/she will give you advice. they may want to see her, but if it does end up being an infection the longer you wait, the more her treatment may cost.|`|XHFj2IVhaa	I wouldn't take the chances on my children not being properly cared for, especially at 9 months old with green snot. Green snot can indicate infection at any age, and there needn't always be fever present with it.     I know it's hard when you don't have insurance. Maybe you can work out a payment plan with the doctor's office. I think it would be worth it to bring her..|`|9tNr1RMfaa	A runny nose is usually pretty minor, sometimes my son has them for weeks at a time. With that being said, green snot sounds like there might be an infection present. I know that my son's pediatrician has an after hours line, and if I leave my number someone will call me back within thirty minutes. Maybe you should try calling your son's doctor. My son's ped is pretty good about telling me whether or not I should bring him in.    ETA: If you are not able to take him to the doctor because you can't afford it, you might consider applying for Children's Medicaid or Chip. My son had it for the first six months of his life (but they are eligible for up to five years) and it was a godsend.|`|vzDmaWqaaa	Green Means infection in adults and little ones.     Also no time is a bad time to call the expert.  Call the nurses at the Doctor's office and explain the situation and ask if its something that the doctor should see or if you should let it play out for a while.  They will tell you what needs attention|`|0iGBBVlGaa	I would just wait.  More than likely if you take her to the doctor and she does have a cold they will tell you to let her fight it off on her own to help build up her immune system.  That is what they told me when I took my son when he was about that age.
gGW7K9U5aa	Sounds to me you have the flu. Yuck! Just keep doing what your doing, eat small and easy food like toast and chicken noodle soup. Basically, just keep washing your hands and try not to breath on your baby. That will help minimize the chances of him catching it. Hope you feel better soon!|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	There's a major stomach bug going around where I live. 24 hour thing.  I was throwing up and had a fever too.  Now my husband has it.  I just hope my baby doesn't get it (she had diarrhea but no vomit or fever).  You just have to wait it out and drink lots of fluids.
rdGQMSyjaa	I voted. Wow! Nice names! I'll rate them on a scale of 1-10 (1=hate,10=love) and comment.    Clara Rosemund Lenning ~ 8 (I love Clara! It's one of my favorites girls names. Rosemund isn't my taste, but it's not bad at all.)    Clara Anneliese Lenning ~ 5 (I'm not big on Anneliese. How do you pronounce it? Anna-leeze-uh? Anna-leese? Ah-na-leeze-uh? Anna-;eeze-uh? I never know how to pronounce this name when I see it. I don't like it much, but it's not bad and it does look nice.)    Eliza Joy Lenning ~ 7 (I'm not really into Eliza, but it's not bad. I like Joy.)    Eleanora Ruth Lenning (Nora) ~ 3 (It's not bad. I don't like how the ending of Eleanora and the beginning or Ruth flow into each other though. It's a bit hard to say. I love Nora as the nickname. Eleanor and Nora are both on my list also!)    Elearnor Ruth Lenning (Nora) ~ 5 (Again, I don't like how the names flow into each other. I find that quite unatractive in a name actually. But I do like Eleanor better than Eleanora. Again, Nora is a great nickname.)    Adelaine Ruth Lenning ~ 2.5 (I don't like this one too much. I know it's ad-a-lane, but it reminds me of that TV comerical that says "ad a line for only 9.99!" lol. Sorry. I don't really care for it. Plus I think it could get mistaken for Adelaide if people don't really take the time to see each letter.)    Ava Christine Lenning ~ 4 (It flows ok. I don't like the name Ava though. Christine is pretty.)    Laura Elisabeth Lenning ~ 9.5 (Wow! You have my top 2 favorite girls names on your list! Laura and Clara. I'm not a fan of Elisabeth, but it sounds nice here. Flows great too! I love it.)    Magdalene Ivy Lenning ~ 2 (I don't like either name.)    Jennifer Anna Lenning (Jen or Jenna) ~ 6 (Flows good. Jennifer is ok. I love Anna. It's on my list too. I like the nicnames pretty well.)    Alexis Faith Lenning ~ 1.5 (I don't like either name.)    Charlotte Adele Lenning ~ 4 (It's ok-ish. I'm not really sure how I feel about it.)    Clara Madeleine Lenning ~ 9 (Sounds reeally nice. If you're going for the pronunciation "Mad-uh-lyn" though, I'd spell it Madalyn or Madelyn. When I see Madeleine I want to say "Mad-uh-line". However, if you are pronouncing it "Mad-uh-line" then Iike it ok. However you pronounce it, it flows great.)    Nathaniel Grant Lenning (Nate) ~ 4(I like Nathaniel. It's on my list. I don't like the nickname Nate at all though. I don't like Grant either. How about Nathan as the nickname insetad of Nate? Just an idea.)    Jude Isaiah Lenning ~ 4 (Saying Jude Isaiah together reminds me of "Judas" a bit. Jude is ok. I like Isaiah. It's on my list. I think Isaiah Jude Lenning would flow better.)    Jude Killian Lenning ~ 2 (I dont' like it.)    Liam Connor Lenning ~ 4 (It flows ok. I don't like Liam at all though. I love Connor. Again, its on my list.)    Connor Michael Lenning ~ 8 (It's ok. It flows well. I love Connor. I'm not a big fan of Michael though, but it doesn't sound bad.)    Weston Jude Lenning ~ 7 (I love Weston. It's on my list. I'm not sure if I like the sound of it with Jude though.)    Elijah Graham Lenning ~ 2 (I dont' care too much for it. However, I do like Eli which can be a nickname for Elijah. It does flow well.)    I have to give you a star. You've got sooo many great names here! And a lot of them are on my list too: Clar, Joy, Eleanor, Laura, Nathaniel, Isaiah, Connor, and Weston! Good luck! =)|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Alexis Faith and liam connor.|`|ThqAACl7aa	Laura Elisabeth Lenning   the 'l' sound is great|`|9jsmmCi3aa	I voted and there are some really cute names on the list, good luck|`|t6GTjcLZaa	I voted!|`|OGoleU7Laa	they were all very good names my favorite was Eliza Joy Lenning and for the boy i liked Liam Connor Lenning. hope i helped|`|coqbBCh9aa	im sorry but i hate the first name because of its middle name. Rosemund sounds a little wierd no offense, so i personally didn't like it. I didnt like the name Elijah, and Isaiah, and Ruth. I think you should make a name which is unique , some name that is nawt common, but sounds really nice/ pretty!    GOOD LUCK:D:D:D|`|HHzJmBaRaa	Ava Christine Lenning. I like that. It's unusual and pretty. ^_^|`|kAcoETg3aa	I very much liked Clara Anneliese for the girl's name. It's a beautiful name for a girl.  And Connor Michael would be a good name for a boy.

I really love Clara, Alexis, and Weston. But I think I would choose "Ellie" as a nickname for Eleanor(a). The names are all very classic/Victorian sounding. Like they're family names. Not sure if they are, but that's kinda what they sound like. I like Elisabeth too!|`|pbfkYJ2daa	i love laura elisabeth! it's my favorite :]  alexis faith and connor michael are cute too!|`|k2y36hPkaa	I really like the name Weston Jude.|`|6y2rZGEKaa	Pretty good!

One of my favorite girls names is also Alexis but I  really like Alexis Grace    Laura Elisabeth--I like how laura sounds with lenning (both with the L)    Ava Christine-- Ava is a unique name and sounds really pretty with christine    Jennifer Anna- is just one of those common kind of names that sounds good with any last name    For your boys names I like:  Liam Connor--I didnt like Liam at first but it really grew on me when my sister was pregnant and we were looking at baby names. it was one of the boys names that she really like (but she ended up having a girl(Mackenzie Kelly))    Connor Michael--I dont really know why i like this name but I think it has a nice ring to it.     I really like how you are using a unique name and not what everyone else is naming their kids. but not too unique like movie stars do.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Clara Madeline for a girl and Liam Connor for a boy.  Good luck hun!|`|9mSIQA2Baa	Voted!
wlAmUQe3aa	My 9 month old has also started to bite sometimes (he's still breastfed too so it's been very trying for me!)    I thnk some of his biting is just him getting used to having teeth or is him trying to work out how things feel (e.g. he likes biting the dining table just now). If I suspect he's teething or exploring, I give him something suitable to bite as many times as it takes before he stops biting whatever he shouldn't be.    If he bites me (he's only ever bitten me...) I will say "no biting" in a firm tone of voice and either place him somewhere on his own (e.g. on the floor away from his toys) and don't look at him for 1 minute. Once the minute is up we go back to whatever we were doing. I don't think he really understands the no part but he has come to learn that biting = no interaction with mummy.    He's also started giving kisses/trying to blow raspberries on people's faces and unfortunately his teeth get in the way sometimes. When this happens we tell him "gently" or if we are sure he meant it "no biting". If he kisses without teeth we make a big fuss about "nice kisses"    Have a word with your day care provider - your son won't be the first (or last) baby they've looked after who bites and they may have some advice.    I have heard of some people suggesting that you bite back. I believe 9 months is too little to understand the action of him biting and the retaliation of being bitten by someone he trusts and from his point of view, you're just being nasty & it could damage your bond of trust. Once they are older and understand more about other people's feelings, there are better ways of discouraging behaviour you don't want than to bite.|`|vzDmaWqaaa	My little girl did the same thing.  its hard to deal with.  Your have to be firm and constant.  Decide to do something about and keep up.  they notice if you dont follow through.  With my little girl she would bite toes ( yuck! ) so my husband came home one day with nasty sweaty feet and put them up not realizing that she would look at them as a snack.  She bit his toes and never did it again.  Maybe you should make whatever your little one is biting taste bad and reinforce that with a sturn NO!  Also when all else fails gently bite him back.  I know it sounds barbaric but how would you know if getting bit hurt if you had never been bitten.  Once they understand they don't want to hurt mommy.
6eaWRGaqaa	I actually like you hair! You look really pretty, but you seem like the type of person who wears their hair back in a ponytail a lot! I'd go back to the hairdresser and ask for some layers. You need A LOT more volume!    Talk to your hairdresser and tell her that you are not happy with the result, they may have a correction policy and will die it back for you, for free.    -Catherine|`|PlmT4lHXaa	I actually like the color. Maybe get some lowlights and a little more texture, like bangs or layers or something if you want to spice it up.    Your stylist might have some tips if you give her an idea of what kind of look you want.    You are a very lovely girl by the way, so I doubt anyone's going to say you are ugly.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	Is your hair wet in that picture?  If so, it'll probably look better when it dries and gets more volume.   And if it isn't wet, it needs volume. You can curl it slightly to make it wavy and full.    The color doesn't look that bad.|`|awXx7N2baa	i think you would look better with some brown in there and get it cut shoulder length and some bangs would look way cute|`|MigBOiUPaa	its not tht bad it just needs some volume in it and maybe u could add some curls to it. and if u still dont like it then u could always dye it a dfrnt color.    good luck!!|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	do something with the eyebrows to make the eyes stand out more    lay off the glossy stuff for your lips because its going to make ur face seem brighter so there will be more contrast between the face and the hair making the hair more noticeable     no offence but something that make your face look less pale because the color of your hair will stand out more when against white rather than a pinkish color or a little tan    dont cut yourself so short though    Edit: yes more volume is a great idea if the volume in the picture is not right from a shower|`|sk46uigvaa	Your hair will look great f you wore foundation.    The red tone in your skin doesn't look great with blonde hair most girls have to ear makeup with it!. Tips are-    a)wear a suitable foundation    b)pluck eyebrows to bring out eyes    c)blow dry hair to Style    here are some tutorials http://uk.youtube.com/results?search_typ...  http://uk.youtube.com/results?search_typ...  http://uk.youtube.com/results?search_typ...|`|chfILbonaa	you could wear more makeup and btw i think your pretty (im not gay) and well you look nice the way you are if i were you get some layers in your hair|`|3Oiwh3Ivaa	Your not ugly at all. I think if you pluck your eyebrows or even get them  waxed you will feel a whole lot better about yourself. Eyebrows make a difference. As far as your hair goes maybe get some soft caramel highlights.|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	1. your not ugly.  2. tweeze your eyebrows up a littler to make them look more defined and that will help.  3. maybe take a little bit of hair where you would have bangs and twist it up and poof it back with a  bobby pin and then have it fall to the back of your head.    the color looks great. I dont think it looks bad at all. If i could pull that color off I totally would. Now i just stick to my natural color... i haven't died my ahir in years|`|6pEDLnrzaa	if your hair is wet wait and curl it, but if you want to detract from the colour get bangs, then pluck your eyebrows, because your not ugly, then die them the same colour|`|c55O7jqXaa	It isn't so much the color as to your hair looks very thin and flat. Maybe a more flatering haircut would help. I personally think the color is fine, but just the style of hair you have going on.  Thick eyebrows are back in style so please leave them alone. Once you start fooling with your eyebrows you have to keep up with them and it is a pain in the butt.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	I actually think that the color looks very nice on you. I don't think you should do anything with the color of it, but I think if you got it styled it would look fantastic. I think that you would look good with layers in it and have the ends slightly curled out.|`|2c7c08556cdc459f7b2028cb74b1ce6faa	your not ugly, and by the way your eyes are really pretty. And for your hair the color isn't bad, but maybe get some natural shade of highlights. that would be cute. And you could get bangs, and cut your hair and put some layers in it. That would look really good [:|`|RYNquyTFaa	i agree with everyone else..  get some SIDE bangs  pluck/wax your eyebrows  some more volume try teasing it   the color is good maybe with some light and dark browns mixed in|`|KDVaGxbHaa	Actually it's fine, and your not ugly. You should probably talk to someone about your low self esteem, though. Hope this this helps!

Try a garage sale, ebay for the name brand items or larger groups and even try Craigslist in florida CL is pretty great at getting rid of things.    good luck!!|`|9b36cd20c83580627b271744d6046be0aa	I like Craigslist.com. You can advertise for your area and people can come pick it up so you don't have to pay for shipping. Or wait until summer and have a garage sale, lots of people look for baby clothes at garage sales. My daughter is 12 months old and I bought practically all of her clothes at garage sales. Or just give them to Goodwill and you can claim it on your taxes as a donation-just remember to keep your receipt for next year's taxes.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	I'm in Akron and we have stores call "Once Upon A Child" here...they rock. Not only can you sell them your kid's old clothes, but you can trade them in for clothes that will fit her now. I don't think I have bought clothes for my son EVER. When he's out grown his winter wardrobe I trade them in for a summer one. They're all over the place. Maybe they have one up there in Cleveland.     Good Luck~
GwX4gN8kaa	Well I'm a natural worry wart but I would think that by the time a child is old enough to take a bath by themselves they are probably ready to take showers by then anyhow.     My daughter is seven and has mostly been taking showers for a couple of years now. Honestly though if she were to take a bath today I'd still check on her once in awhile and make sure she was okay. I mean adults can drown with no warning so I'm not taking any chances with my child.     Not to mention every child is different in maturity level which I think makes a huge difference in what's safe or not.|`|qGQCLFinaa	My son is almost 4. we always leave the door open & i stay upstairs so i can hear him good & see him if i peek in real quick, usually he just sits there & plays with his toys, or we have finger paints for the tub as well as bath crayons so he's usually creating some masterpiece!  He's been doing this for about a year, but he's always been very cautious, he doesn't like to go under the water & he shuts it off when he thinks it's high enough (which i don't even think is enough)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i guess it varies from baby to baby , or kid as it may be....it will be a long time before i am comfy letting mine bath alone, and even then i would probably insist on a shower with a fast drain! paranoid mom here...LOL|`|gGW7K9U5aa	I havent gotten to that situation yet, my son is 3 years old and we still sit in the bathroom with him. Probably about 5 years old. Although, I can remember when I didnt want my parents in the bathroom with me, I believe I was about 5-6 years old. Its really up to the kid and how responsible they are for their age.|`|7PXFXcKfaa	i agree with mommyman - about 5,6,or 7 years old sounds good. but even then i would be in and out of the room checking them!     remember a child can drown in an inch of water in less than a minute!|`|XOtOMncwaa	My sons one, so I still stay in there with him... but my cousin is 6, so when she's in the tub I allow her to bathe herself, I still wash her hair, but she is allowed to play in there by herself, I just leave the door open so I can hear her. It was so funny one time I said "Autumn" and she said "Yeah" and I said "okay" and she said "why do you keep calling my name" and I said "I'm just making sure your okay" so about 5 minutes later she said "hillary" and I said "yeah" and she said "okay I'm just making sure your not dead" it was really cute, I still laugh about it.|`|aT7HgLJnaa	6 probably...and i remember my mom would keep checking in on me to make sure i was okay until i was nearly 9...|`|eYuIsNk1aa	11 because  all it takes is 30 sec for them to aspirate water into their lungs|`|701FO16zaa	not until you are confident that they are confident in the water. My son is almost 5 and and has been in swimming lessons since he was 3mths, but I still stay in the bathroom with him. A child can drown in an inch of water...|`|AA12339815	I have a little boy he is 12 now and when he was young i put him in the bath on his own with me watching around  14mths of age
TYRRjIv4aa	I think its cute and original, but i would use Sadie Brianne just because the middle name looks like Brian. :)|`|AA12339815	i do love the name alot if i had a girl i would call her nikita because i love that name alot|`|kbshCDTbaa	Don't like it...|`|gbAZKiLyaa	I like only if Briann is pronounced Breanne.    Sadie is cute and I like Sadie Breanne, but Sadie Briann sounds a little off to me.|`|sPl34hzWaa	i like briann i dont like sadie|`|3iGoYk0Saa	i like both names individually but not together.|`|i2RSpZ6caa	I love Sadie. I prefer Brianne with the 'e' at the end.|`|AA11138222	I think Sadie sounds like a dog's name :( Briann is pretty though|`|bT4npA7Jaa	I love it, but I like the spelling Brianne better, because without the e, it looks like Brian. Also it would look and flow better if you used the formal and longer version of Sadie and just used that as a nickname. So overall, I'd go with Mercedes Brianne. It is really cute and you could still call her Sadie for short.|`|i4nwHekGaa	That sounds like a preppy high skool girl|`|U1h6Dntjaa	Sadie is cute - but in a few years it will be passe.  Briann is awful.|`|wIGuhAZXaa	don't care for it sorry|`|ODMCAcPDaa	I like it.  Is it pronounced Bry-in (like the boys name)?  I like that way better than Brianne.|`|jswhfzg8aa	Hi, I think It's a nice name! You don't really hear of that name anymore  Goodluck with everything   ;0)|`|lSvcX175aa	i like it!|`|ZrIl3PwLaa	I am thinking you are talking about for your son??? If so NO WAY    Sadie wouldn't be a total downer for a girl but for a boy no way!!!!|`|wrdPBLq0aa	I don''t like it!|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I think it's adorable, Sadie is a very cute name, and Briann is a very cute name too, esp. as a middle name. One of the reasons I love the name Briann is cuz of Jamie Lynn Spears daughter Maddie havin that for her middle name, :D.    Hope this helps, :D.|`|AA10794304	i dont really like that name|`|e17025d63b591426b1c43c2197cd3fc8aa	Sadie is nice. Briann is ugly.|`|9mSIQA2Baa	Eh it's okay.|`|P8x2ydKxaa	NO
weadibPeaa	you have no concept of money, you'll have to live at home with your parents and thats gonna suck. good luck getting a minimum wage job if you're lucky since you're barely even legally allowed to work|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	It is also illegal at your age.|`|tMuUh6YGaa	it is probably because it was on your mind for a while. find someway to get yourself not wanting a child, or distracting yourself someway else, like start and a big picture, or help a friend with her problems. Having a child at 14 will be a terrible idea.|`|QYatiayzaa	Woah.  This is Kind of weird.  The same exact thing is happening with me.  I'm fourteen, and I keep having dreams that I'm pregnant.  And it's exciting.  But I know it's not true, not that I don't wish it was.|`|eemmWU0Haa	I got pregnant on the pill I was also 14 years old.:D|`|AA11762804	its not illegal by the way, you can have a child at any age. your feeling this way because of your maternal instinct is kicking in the feeling that you want a baby will go away and then it will come back and it will go away again, ect.... maybe talk to a councilor or therapist.    I used to have dreams i was pregnant and it was a fantastic feeling, but i was glad that they were only dreams, kids are hard work. Idk the things we dream about always seem better then if they were to happen in real life, not that having a baby is not great, but it can be sooooooo stressfull|`|dvoelIXIaa	Your right it is amazing to hold a child that is yours. But you are still too young to be having babies. Live your life and enjoy it. You will soon grow up and have a beautiful family. But as of right now stay focused and in school. It will do you good later on down the road. I promise.|`|PflKM0QUaa	your way too young. im 21 and am not ready. you cant provide for qa child right now. how can a child be yours when you cant even provide shelter, food, clothes on your own. you have your whole life ahead of you. finish school and get married first.
8eee24bd02326603be44e37c10b3b6daaa	Of course it will...Your body is adjusting to not being pregnant anymore.Everything is going back into place...If your a new mom, anxiety is a part of it ,you have a new little life to take care of now.You are going to be just fine. Is this your first child?If your not breast feeding the medication that you are taking will help you alot,.best advise is to take it at the same time everyday and do not miss a dose.And please give it time to adjust to your system. I truely hope my advise help's you....I really do not think that you need to see a psychiatrist,,take care Rita|`|aJLx0nhNaa	It will absolutely get better.  See the doctor.  And remember that you deserve to feel good during this time, you deserve to sleep well and enjoy your baby.  So if they prescribe you something, take it.  This won't last forever, and your baby is fine, but you deserve to feel better.|`|qBl9ShJBaa	it is going to take time,the sadness and tears or sort of a part of the end of ur pregnancy.if u have a partner ask him to under stand and give u time because that's all that's going to help.|`|QXSFpMzDaa	You should be proud of yourself for recognizing that you need serious help and getting it.  So many woman don't and it hurts more than just them.  You are an amazing woman and mother for taking care of yourself and your child!  Your baby will say thank you one day.  Good luck honey.  I do know what you are going through.|`|Q9qno7EVaa	Yes this will get better, I never had it myself but did feel quite blue for the first few weeks after my baby was born, my dr was a bit concerned that I might get depression because it went on a bit longer then normal, but I am just an emotional sort of person. I think the quicker you get help the better and also ask people close to you for help and support. If anyone offers to do anything for you or the baby accept it and say thank you don't try to do it all alone, I think that it takes 2 people to make a baby then we must not be meant to do it on our own, sometimes the father's are no help but that's where friends and families come in play. I hope you have a good support network. Good luck, I'm sure you'll be feeling better before you know it.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	yes it will get better - believe it or not the hardest part is over, recognizing it.  for some women it takes sooo long to realize that post partum is really what's going on.  you have that on your side. the dr will probably give you some meds, temporarily.  it can take up to a week for you to feel better, but every day will get easier and then before you know you realize you are feeling more like yourself.  if you can, ask for help with your baby in the meanwhile.  if you fear for either one of your safety, act immediately, do not wait!  good luck.  it will get better.|`|74pfB2Bnaa	Yes, it will get better. Just be diligent in taking all the medicine the doctor prescribes and put an effort into thinking positive thoughts.   Sit down every morning or when baby naps and think of five things you are grateful for, that helps a lot.|`|83j1ThU7aa	ya it took me at least until my son was a month maybe lil more (about when my body was scheduled to his every 2 hours up and crying and eating ) before it went away. it just seemed like i was doing everything at once, the baby, the house, the cooking & cleaning.. i had help dont get me wrong.. plus with the depression i kept telling myself i wasnt good enough i wanted to be and do all i can. it was crazy n i only told one person i was depressed. i would just cry sometimes even when he was asleep which felt like no reason at all .. so trust me it will get better maybe i wasnt as deep a level you were but it takes time..
G4a8Yfjeaa	do you have witnesses? If you do bring them out. Do you know the kid that told him? Do you know his parents are have a way of finding out? Well If the answer to all these is yes, go up to the kid and beg him nicely to tell the truth. If he refuses, rat him out to his parents and have them force him to spit out the truth.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	I wouldn't want him back if he couldn't trust me and took someone else's word for it. Move on,|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	go up to him, give him the hardest slap he has felt in his life, and say...    "thats for not trusting me!!!!!!!"    after that it should be twice as easy to get over him and its better to not get back with him because he either doesn't trust you or already wanted to break up with you and what the guy told him was his ticket out|`|98v2W0gGaa	are you serious?   you cheated on him.|`|gX40pgLyaa	He probably likes you so much he doesnt want to get hurt if that really was true.  Or you should just forget about him because if he really loved you he would believe you|`|HpWCjBv6aa	If he's going to refuse to believe what you're saying, then he's not worth it.  If he's going to tell you he hates you over something SOME KID (not bff, not friend, but some kid) told him, when he probably wouldn't have been involved in the situation to begin with, he's not worth it.    Try your best to move on.  He sounds like an immature little butthole.|`|RYNquyTFaa	if he doesnt trust you then forget about him especialy if he beleives other people over you alot of people get jealous of what they dont got and try to ruin it so yeah people will be sayin this and that outta jealousy maybe especialy if yall go to school together  if he doesnt beleive you then it will never work get someone better im sure hes missing out

Basically your not feeling like yourself|`|eemmWU0Haa	Ive always gotten headaches and major break outs on my face and major gas and my boobs hurt|`|dvoelIXIaa	Well my breast started to get really sore and your discharge will get heavier when you are pregnant.    Some people say that if you are pregnant babies will be more attached to you and they will pay attention to you.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	If it's two weeks before your period then you can check to see if you're ovulating in order to get pregnant.  Some women get implantation bleeding between the time they conceive and when their period was due.  That's just really light spotting but not all women get that.|`|UxwjpsKQaa	i never got any pregnancy symptoms until i was about 3 months along|`|5k0FKWTSaa	Two weeks before your expected period is too early for pregnancy symptoms.(presuming your periods are regular. If your periods are not regular, then you wouldn't really know when your expected period will be!). Ovulation (& therefore, hopefully Conception) typically occurs 2 weeks before your expected period, no matter how long your period cycles are.      Therefore, around this time, you'll be conceiving, and should have no pregnancy symptoms at all... Pregnancy symptoms will usually manifest itself once the conceptus has implanted itself into the wall of your womb, and that will occur 10 days after conception. Thus, the earliest signs of any symptoms will be approx 4 days before your expected period. And the most sensitive preg test will only turn positive after implantation.    Hope this clears things up for you.|`|SnyDa8Claa	2 weeks before you period is when you usually ovulate.  I really didn't have any symptoms. Although I was trying, it was surprise that it happened. But when I took the test, I knew what the result would be, in my heart. I just somehow knew.

If not, then she isn't somebody you would want to be with.|`|GdELhKMYaa	its bothering you so you might as well think of a way to tell her. maybe one day just write her a note or sumthin and tell her. that always makes it easier for me when im scared to ask or tell somebody somthin|`|Bs8sllD9aa	Just come out with it. Grow a few and tell her|`|AA10025824	It's bothering you, so the sooner you do it the better and easier it will be. And if she finds out whatever it is it may damage your friendship by you not being the one who told her.
8U5jnXBVaa	Hmmm... this is hard, but from an outside observer who is emotionally disconnected from the situation, it is an easy choice.     First of all, you need to emotionally detach yourself and look at the logistics assuming you were to take in this child.    - Do you guys have enough income to support this child?   - Does the child have any mental/physical complications that would prevent you from being able to take care of the child? (would it be better off being supported by the state?)   (Note the time is right to change parents as he is very young...)   - ect..    Secondly,   - Assuming your husband wants to take care of the child no matter what, is he willing to lose you if you say differently? are you willing to lose him over this?   - What do you want vs. what are you willing to do?       It is easy for me to say..."Yes" because it is what I would consider as the best choice to the betterment of your soul, the human race, and this young child's future. You either throw him out on the street at age 3 and most likely, he will grow up in an orphanage, bounce from house to house, pick up drugs at a young age, get a bad education and follow in his mother's footsteps...and possibly worse...such as become a criminal tha may end up hurting someone. You have the oppurtunity to swallow the pride and expectations that you have/had and realize that you a human being first. You are you and the choices you make define your life story. Forget God, forget my opinion, forget your expectation and understand that you are a human and we are all humans of this world. I think when you realize that perspective, you will make the right choice. ALSO...I do not know the details (do you have a family already? income? can you support a child? is there anyone else to take care of him? ect...) so the answer may be no.     The point is, are you willing to sacrifice the expectations you have had for yourself to take care of a child in need?     (I couldn't help but get interested and check your profile...you quoted Martin Luther King, Jr.     "i have decided to stick with love. hate is too great a burden to bear."    -martin luther king jr.    After reading that quote, I think you know what the right choice is. Understand that you HAVE A CHOICE. You are not a bad person for saying No, but you are most definitely a good person for saying yes.)     If you do choose to take him in, YOU MUST NEVER NEVER NEVER REGET IT. You must love him unconditionally, take care of him until you die, and support him with all of the resources and options within your grasp. He will be your child and no one else's.     Best of luck.|`|LwoOdSycaa	me and my boyfriend have been together since we were sixteen. we are now 19 almost 20. during our relationship i have found out he has 2 kids. one who is almost 4 and one who is almost 3. by 2 diff girls of course. we just recently had a baby girl who did not make it. she passed away when she was 2 days old. her name was nevaeh. anyways... when i found out he had 2 other kids i was devastated. finding out i was pregnant actually helped us out alot although it was a couple years after i found out about the other kids. he gets custody of both of his sons if anything were to happen to the mothers. i say welcome them with open arms if you can afford it and if you are good with children. and you guys are going to be getting married so why not? they are his kids and one day will be his pride and joy and one of the only things in life that will make him smile through anything. he has already missed out on 3 years so he might as well jump right in take responsibility and make up for those 3 years by raising them with his future wife and giving those kids the best life they deserve. its going to take some thinking. but in a situation like this it all depends on if you two are capable of raising these kids the right way.|`|sP25taiHaa	wow that sucks   you should accept that he has a child if you really love him  yesss i know it sucks but theres not much you can do at this point but just to be there for him also you never know the kid could be really adorable or somethin    well best of luck|`|fwRjU7Gpaa	your bf said your great with kids then you could take care of those babies.lukas and stella has nothing to do with what your bf and the girl did before.    yes you may feel betrayed or shocked but maybe your bf feels the same because he also just found out about the baby.and what about lukas and stellas feelings.now that their mother is gone and no one wants them????    have a heart.you know their families situation.do you think your bf wants them to grow up with the girls family?none of them want the kids.its up to you...you are the one to make a decision if you want the twins to be with drug addicts or to be loved by your bf the father of lukas and stella and you to be the mother(if you wants them to come with you)    every child have the right to be with their parents and now that his mother died then that will be your bf and now you.    go girl i know you van take care of those babies.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Children come first before anyone else.Just remember that.If you cannot accept it then perhaps you two are not destined for each other.    Good luck.|`|EMKuBql8aa	He's the dad, he needs to take responsibility. That's my opinion. You need to stay Swiss on the whole thing. You don't want to influence him either way and later have him resent you for it. Just stay in the middle promising to support him in whatever he decides.     It's going to be hard for the kid, he just lost everything he knows.|`|o36YrSWRaa	This could be a blessing in disguise. Someone has got to take care of the child and maybe by becoming the child's guardians you will become a family rather than a couple.  On the other hand, I would recommend being completely sure that you are going to go through with the marriage before getting into something so serious.|`|B0bqRhgnaa	Well you do love him and you guys are engaged.Is that a comitement you are willing to make?If i was you i would do it because if my husnad came to me and told me the same story I would do it that's his child,even though you guys were split up and it's by another girl but that's not the childs fault.once you get to know the child and u will start getting close to the child it will be fine.

I was volunteering and I felt sick in the morning and didn't want to go but once I got there I felt fine, but then when I got home I felt sick again.

It sounds like you are really lacking in iron which tends to happen a lot in pg therefore making you tired etc. Growing a baby is hard work. I would suggest going to your health shop and getting something and a few days time you will feel heaps better. I had the same problem and it went after that.
OaxXT5nzaa	The only real way to know is to go to the doctor.  However, you could miss a period due to stress, sickness, weight loss, etc.  Either way, with all those symptoms, sounds like you need to see a doctor.|`|3rlgYhNBaa	It could be that you are stressed and worried, but I would wait a week or two and if things don't get better I'd go see a doctor.|`|myYTYCcJaa	Take a pregnancy test again.

Ar6wD9Oeaa	wow! to answer your question - iot is doubtful to get pregnant at this point b/c you are so close to your period, but you dont know exactly when you ovulated to say that you should definetly get your period that day.    BC and antibiotics dont mix well. I would call the dr tomorrow and run it by them.  Also, i would pick up a copy of "taking charge of your fertility" by toni weschler. It's a great book that teachers you all about your body and its cycle and what to expect during the month (changes in fluids and so on). I dont like the name of the book b/c it definetly insinuiates that it's about  getting pregnant when infact you can use it in two ways : A. to get pregnant or to prevent pregnancy. Either way... you learn a wealth of information about your own body and may never need birthcontrol again!
WqkFJ2Pgaa	I think it's wonderful that you want to tandem nurse. I wish I'd had the opportunity. Unfortunately, your husband has some issues that need to be dealt with. Don't let him bully you into weaning before you and your daughter are ready unless it's a major issue, and really affecting your relationship. One thing that worked for a friend was to sit down with her husband and set a date by which their daughter would be completely weaned (like, in three months, or by her birthday, or whatever).|`|hGmq5IuZaa	tell him to SHOVE IT. He sounds like a complete abusive jerk. Nurse as long as the baby wants to|`|gx4s68s8aa	I don't see anything wrong with nursing a 18 month old.  She is still very young.  If you don't mind it and she is fine with it then go ahead.  Likely she is recognizing that a change is going to happen and she wants more comfort from you by breast feeding. I think weaning her now or soon might be an added stress on both of you.  Stress neither of you need right now.     Tell your husband that in many, many parts of the world most children are still breast feeding at 2 years old.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	I have heard it`s recommended that your child is breastfed up to 2 years old, but personally I think it`s wrong. As soon as my baby starts to eat solid food, off the boob. Whether it`s 4 months or 8 months. I just think it`s better for the baby and myself because some women do use breastfeeding as a bonding mechanism and use it more for themselves than their child. It doesn`t mean I won`t continue to pump, but no nursing past 8 months.    LOVE THE THUMBS DOWN for my diverse parenting skills. Sorry I don't need my child at my tit to feel good about myself and our relationship...|`|HyknHVV5aa	I agree with your husband, I think you should stop breast feeding, not because it's 'disgusting' as he says, but more because the child is almost 2. The recommended age to stop is 6 months, but most women go longer then that. But the fact your child is almost 2 years old, you should ween her now.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	The average worldwide is actually 3 years.  That seems a long time in the Western world because the average here is about 6 months to a year.  Anything after that and people start thinking things are wrong.    I suggest taking your husband to your daughters next doctors appointment and discuss it with your doctor.  That way you can both hear what the doctor thinks about breastfeeding at 18 months.|`|avx7bLnKaa	american drs recommend for 1 yr but the world health organization recommends for 2 yrs.....    tell your husband to stuff it....... i'd tell my hubby the same thing....    18 months is still so young... my 1st son weaned at 8 months...sadly... but he is 23 months now and it still astounds me how young he still is.... i always thought 2 yr olds were "older" until i actually had one.... meaning some women may think nursing a baby older than 1 yr weird but it really isn't when you actually have a child that age...    good luck, you are doing good.....      my son got really lovey with me my last month or so of my pregnacy as well.... its like they know something is up|`|89b9b79c918cf6555bea31d3d7be7d94aa	I quit breastfeeding at my daughter at 18 months, but even now at 21 months she still latches on every chance she gets, mostly at night when im sleeping, i don't get milk any more or at least nothing that will satisfy her, but she is comforted by my breast and i don't see anything wrong with it, my friend has a 19 month old son and she is 12 weeks pregnant and still breastfeeds at night. disgusting is not a way to describe it, does your husband think that an 18 month old still using a bottle or pacifier as disgusting? its the same thing, and as long as you are able to deal with it and you enjoying nursing her as much as she likes it then keep it up, eventually she and even your new baby will grow out of the nursing phase, so there is no need to rush a good thing to an end. there is a video on youtube about a mother that breastfed her first daughter till she was 5 and still breastfed her second daughter till the age of 8, now this i do find to be a bit odd, but still wouldn't describe it as disgusting, everyone does what works for them, and no one should judge even your husband, if anything he should support you for being able to give his children the best natural source of nutriment and comfort.       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxv6R9fUO...|`|cUxdsuamaa	You should start thinking of the health of the one your pregnant with. Your taking away vitamins and minerals from your new baby . When your 18 month old is old enough to eat all she needs.|`|rpzHSaI9aa	I agree with your hubby, if I saw a child that was old enough to walk and talk drinking from mommy's boob I would be disgusted.    Also you mentioned that your pregnant. I am no doctor but does breastfeeding now affect the pregnancy. What about when baby comes, are you going to make sure your daughter is off the boob by then....|`|e39a79f6daf722c960330aea2db67b78aa	I actually think that your daughter has started to nurse more because she knows that she's going to have to be sharing soon. While I agree with your husband (somewhat) I don't agree with his methods. You should wean your 18 month old before your baby comes, otherwise you're going to be contending with a newborn that you HAVE to feed when she wants it and an 18 month old that wants it as well.. and could freak out that you 'have to feed the baby'.     I don't think it's gross to be nursing an 18 month old, I think it's commendable that you could do it that long when so many people don't and won't.. but I do think that you're going to be in for a rough ride if she's not weaned by the time your new one is born.. especially if she's showing signs of jealousy already... which she is by wanting to nurse more.|`|dfBjPB1laa	Well, your husband is entitled to his opinion, and you to yours.  I've never breastfed, so I can't say much in that area, however I do know people who still breastfed their children at 18 months old.    I don't think this is something you and your husnad are going to come to an agreement on.  I think that you both should give a little.  Maybe he could stop with the rude comments and you could try and avoid breastfeeding in front of him?    You might want to talk to a doctor and have your doctor explain that it is still perfectly normal and that there isn't anything wrong with it.    At 32 weeks I'm not sure that I would stop.  Soon there is going to be a brand new baby breastfeeding and your daughter might feel... like she's being cast aside so your baby can breastfeed.  I think it might create jealousy.      You might want to start to encourage her to drink from a sippy cup doing the day and not breastfeed her every couple of hours and during the night.  At 18 months there is no reason she should be up for multiple feeding.  If she wakes give her a drink of water and back to bed.  I would still breastfeed her maybe in the morning, before nap, and before bed.  That seems good for an 18 month old, who, I imagine, is getting nutrition from other drinks and food.|`|24P6A0oaaa	well... a lot of child don't self wean and if they do it probably wont be for a while. my boyfriend felt the same, I stopped my son at 21 months... they are older and honestly, they really don't need it, kind of like the binky. I also stopped because I was pregnant because I don't want him to want it when the other baby has it. You are pretty far but have you considered stopping? like so your new baby has the boob only? its up to you but I find it easier to wean one.   I don't find it disgusting until they are maybe 2 1/2 and up. and I think all men feel that way

s4LWmcTjaa	Your 14 year old does not need a cell phone.  Take it away and don't give it back until she can pay for it herself.    With an ungrateful attitude like that, she doesn't deserve one either.    EDIT- Well I can see your daughter quickly became 13 years old and you describe a totally different situation here:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    Can we say troll?    EDIT 2- Ok so she will get her phone back in a month and she will still not have to pay for it?  Then why are you asking???      For the record your daughter is a spoiled, selfish girl.  Be prepared for it to only get worse.  She will be a very self centered, selfish, ungrateful person.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Really? You bought her a $350 cell phone, she threw it out the window, and you got her another one?    Your daughter is a tyrant. Good luck with that.|`|NysFTExhaa	Tell her since she threw it out the window, she needs to pay you back for that one and can't have the new one until she shows she can be responsible and respectful.|`|vGtM2F5Caa	wow!  IM 14 and i would NEVER do that!  you shouldn't have bought her a new one!!!  she should appreciate what you buy for her|`|P544Sbmqaa	Well, you can do what you want, but if you give her the phone back without making her pay for it, all you are doing is showing her that the behavior is acceptable.  I wonder how long after getting it back it will take her to do the same thing again.  You have a spoiled brat on your hands.  Had that been my child, she would not have had a second chance on that one, and if she did, she would be paying every single cent herself.|`|HyknHVV5aa	Well, if you are willing to give her her phone back, and still pay for it, she has just learnt that no matter how rude her behavior there are no consequences.     Either give her a new cell phone at the end of the month, but it is the bottom of the line cheapest cell phone there is, and tell her if she respects this phone and keeps it in good shape for 6 months she can get a new $350 dollar phone then.     If you don't want to do that, the LEAST you should do is have her pay $350 for the new phone, either by doing work for you outside of regular chores, or work for neighbors like mowing lawns or something.    She should be more respectful then to throw a perfectly good phone out the window and waste money like that, and by handing her another perfectly good phone is teaching her absolutely nothing.|`|zHRWklEWaa	Typically when you through something out the window, you don't have it anymore. Don't give her another phone, give her change for a pay phone. nobody needs to spend $700 dollars on phones in one day.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I certainly wouldn't be giving her that phone! If she wants a new one, she can pay for it herself|`|EMKuBql8aa	I say give her a calling card and tell her to use a payphone.    Or better yet, 2 quarters and tell her to use her feet to call someone.     Do not give it to her, that would be enabling the behavior.|`|frpCK0utaa	Little ungrateful brat doesnt need a cell phone, and you shouldnt have allowed her to have one in the first place. Much less getting another one after she threw another phone out the damn car window.    disciplinary action:No cell phone. Ever. tell her she can have one when her but gets a job and starts paying the bill herself. Then maybe she'll stop chucking them out windows.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	Are you crazy?   First you say..  "On the way back home, I started telling her she'd have to show more respect to keep the phone."  Then you say  "My husband had to go buy a new one, (Another $350)"    I have a 15yo and I am no bothered about swearing if it slips out accidentally, etc, but your 14yo called you a b*tch, right after you bought her a cell phone and that is disgusting.    You told her she's have to start showing more respect if she wanted to keep the phone, but after she calls you a b*tch and throws the phone out the window (both of those things aren't just disrespectful, they are incredibly horrible and throwing things out the window of a moving car is illegal) and then buy her a new one!    You're husband needs to take the new phone back to the store now. Your daughter needs to pay you back $350 for the phone she threw out a window. She needs to be grounded, she needs to stop swearing at you, she needs to have computer, mp3, tv privileges taken away until she learns to stop acting like such a spoiled brat.    And you need to start acting like a mother not letting your daughter skip around acting like a disrespectful brat.|`|n8k1rjXqaa	y did u get her a dare and isn'tt 14 to young anyway u should  not give text cause if ur overprotective  she would be with a guy trust me texting is the best way to hook up  and u should take it away or sell bak if u have worinty|`|9erSLvYMaa	If I had done that I not only wouldn't have gotten the phone back, I wouldn't have ever gotten a phone again. oh, and I'd probably lose my allowance until I paid it back. Along with loss of privileges for who knows how long.    Oh yeah, and calling my mom a b*****...that would have gotten me smacked. And probably a week's grounding. And grounding at my house meant no electronics and you don't come out of your room except to eat, shower, go to school, etc.    But enough about me. The issue here is that your daughter doesn't see any consequences in the destruction of property. It's no wonder she's like that if your reaction to this sort of thing is normal. She knows that if she breaks something you'll just replace it without anything bad happening to her. The fact that she did this in response to a simple short speech is even worse (either she has serious anger management issues or she's not used to being disciplined at all). What you should do is not give her back the phone at all. Go return it, there's no reason you should be the one getting punished for her bad behavior. If she wants that phone back she can buy it herself, maybe  then she'll be more responsible with it.
TXKKOa1Jaa	GOOD THING she broke up with him! I am sooo sorry this had to happen to you!|`|64OsCr8laa	thats gross i would tell your husband first and you to need to figure out a way to break it to your daughter thats so sad and she will be heart broken but it has to be done.  you and your husband both need to tell her though    good luck|`|skSzDIlwaa	you have to tell your husband and your daughter the truth. they need to know what has happen to you.|`|XWPAjxsGaa	wow. i only thought something like this would happen in movies..  hes not right for your daughter if hes doing that to you!!!  Tell your daughter and husband what has happened and im sure she would change her mind in him once you tell her that he rubbed up against you.
5tp4c1TEaa	huh?|`|SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    Can't say i remember because me and my partner were having regular sex every other day, when i fell pregnant.  You can't determine the sex of the baby by conceiving certain days, i know people say you can, but the sex of the baby is determined by the males sperm and it just depends what sperm reaches the egg.  Boy sperm are very fast swimmers but die early.  Girl sperm are slow swimmers but they live longer then boy sperm.    People say having sex a few days before ovulation your be more likely to have a girl, having sex on ovulation your most likely to have a boy, im not sure how true this is.    I ended up having a little boy, but sadly stillborn.  Best of luck x

Y1Lb5f4Eaa	That's such an interesting question. I had to think about it for a while. They wouldn't be twins, they'd be double first cousins. But it's interesting to think about. Identical twins have the same DNA, but it's expressed in different ways. So... to answer your question... lol.... they would have very similar DNA, but it wouldn't necessarily be expressed in the same way.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	They will be genetically biological siblings, not identical.   With 46 chromosomes, dividing into 23 in each gamete (one from each parent), and cross-over events on 22 of those sets, there are an almost infinite number of possibilities for such children - much the same as any couple having multiple children, each quite biologically unique (even identical twins, which often have epigenetic uniqueness).|`|6avKnzkoaa	No DNA is the same. They might look similar however it all depends on genetics ultimately.|`|W1p6LetFaa	No.  Each individual egg and sperm have their own genetic makeup, even if they come from twins.  The combination of egg and sperm will never be the same unless they literally came from the exact same egg and sperm that splits into two (identical twins).|`|LSkeAPBIaa	... Huh. If two sets of identical two a have kids they may look alike but they wouldn't be twins with each other..|`|JsshzKM9aa	That'd be cool, but no.|`|d08rkYlpaa	no, their children would not be twins, but they would stand a very good chance of looking a lot alike. The odds of any one characteristic they might have, like eye color, nose shape, ears, etc., being the same is between 17 percent and 25 percent, if I remember my Mendelian rules correctly.|`|eemmWU0Haa	I saw this on Maury once..   2 twin sisters met two twin brothers and both got married at the same time and tried for a baby at same time one got pregnant but it was just 1 baby the other it didn't work..|`|AA11762804	well they could meet twin brothers or they could both do the same guy, but they would not look exacly alike|`|Jf3DIPcNaa	no because each baby would get half it's genes from each parent and the combinations of dominant and recessive genes would never come up the same. However, if given DNA tests, you would not be able to tell which woman was the mom of which baby and the same with the dads.   I actually saw a talk show once where there were twin brothers and they honestly couldn't tell who the father was because they had the same DNA.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	They'd be double first cousins and I think they'd have the same DNA but they're not technically twins.

ibWLdXlJaa	We use Pampers Baby Dry. We never had any problems with Pampers whatsoever.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i use swaddlers and they are super; they go to a size 2/3 and then they go to cruisers....you can find that size at sam's club or babies r us for sure, don't know about other places, probably diapers.com too; if you haven't ordered from there i have a code for ten bucks off your first purchase, if you want it email me....and they ship free anything over 49 dollars; and if i am not mistaken, they are a little cheaper on the swaddlers than i have found them in the stores.....|`|gGW7K9U5aa	Ive always use Huggies and havent had a problem with them. Maybe try the Supreme diapers they make and see if that helps at all.|`|jgDlkSiWaa	We use pampers. Never had a problem at night.   Have you tried the Huggies overnights?|`|b4fYwZeraa	Had the same issue with Huggies. Switched to Luvs. They're less expensive and never had any more leaks.|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	pampers cruisers have the same mesh inside as the swaddlers, but have more elastic around the legs. the swaddlers only go up to size 2-3, so depending on the weight of your baby, they may not fit anymore. i too loved swaddlers and i've tried pampers baby dry but cruisers are great!  you can also find the cruisers with ultra absorbancy at BJ's Wholesale Clubs, but we really only need that extra protection at night. we use huggies overnights for bedtime and those too are great. i find that where i live, they've been hard to find in size 3. not sure if they're getting rid of the size 3s, but i've had luck finding them at grocery stores or drug stores. bring your coupons!|`|POSGHgzuaa	I don't think that size matters - if a brand isn't a good fit at size 2, it probably won't fit your kid at size 4.  However, we tried and really didn't like the regular Huggies for my son, but we will *only* use the Huggies Overnites for nighttime.  They are the best!  We use Pampers Cruisers and Seventh Generation during the day.
Fc7j3T3naa	If you've already missed your period, why not take a pregnancy test?|`|W1p6LetFaa	I'm assuming you're asking if you may be pregnant?  These certainly sound like pregnancy symptoms to me, so I suggest testing as soon as possible!  Good luck to you!|`|MsipL0Mzaa	take a test...|`|ndqjst7taa	It sounds like your pregnant. Go buy HMP test and see if you are or go see your doctor|`|phAqOpzZaa	your pregnant!|`|NsTEWUMVaa	Have you done a pregnancy test? If not, you should - this sounds like classic early pregnancy, including the light cramping and spotting around the time your period would have been due (this is called implantation bleeding and many women get it when the embryo implants in the wall of the uterus).    If the pregnancy test is negative, I'd consult a doctor to explore other reasons for your delayed period, cramping and bleeding.|`|45Mb4GKkaa	You should take a test.  If it's negative, call your doctor about why you haven't gotten your period.
28WJwHf4aa	Time to invest in a lock...and apparently curtains since he can see you through the window?!    And while you're at it, have the sex talk.|`|xxSGhywoaa	I think it is still normal all children mature and age differently.   I would sit down with him and ask him if he has a girl at school he likes.  Just sit down and chat it up with him like he wants to but do tell him that you need your mommy time.|`|KaAXJJo8aa	wow... ummm... sit him down and talk to him? tell him you wont tolerate that behavior.|`|NoZAofgOaa	um idk cuz why would he get "curious" with his mother?|`|EMKuBql8aa	It's time to have the sex talk with him if you haven't already. My guess is that this started a few years ago, lol.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	It's possible that he is getting curious, but it's also possible that he just wants to feel close to you.  Don't push him away out of fear, but you might want to talk to him.  Would you rather have him learning from you or from his friends that don't know anything and are stupid enough these days to try to start having sex without knowing what it's all about or the consequences of it.  If you want him to learn, be his teacher.  If that's not what he's doing then perhaps he just wants you to spend more time with him.|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	Well judging by your avatar picture I would say yes he is. He is trying to sneak a peak at your ta ta's. This is usually the time they start to get interested. Maybe you should tell him you understand he is going through a hormonal thing right now, but you need your privacy and is not cool for him to try to look at you. You need to have "the talk" with him. Discuss how to be safe, and how to treat a girl and what sex is all about. And most importantly try to make it as something you do only when you are with someone special. Try not to encourage him to do it, but let him know it is normal. Maybe you should get him some magazines so he can relive himself that way instead of trying to look at you.|`|G4wEL4qoaa	Let him handle it himself.  Most parents don't have any talks with their kids really anymore, that's what the internet and TV are for.  Seriously, no one I know has ever mentioned talking to their parents about it, and I know I haven't, so best just to ignore it.|`|9qiLZp50aa	If he is 14, shouldn't he already have learned about that in health class at school?|`|kCTGf3qfaa	Your...son?  That's not normal..  I'd ask a doctor or something.  It's strange he's sexually interested in his mother..|`|b7HFB7H6aa	Yep. Normal curiosity. Don't embarrass him & get some curtains.|`|TY1eE6knaa	it sounds like he's starting to get a little curious, but i'm not so sure it's normal for him to be trying to glimpse at you. Have you had the sex  talk with him? if not, it might be that time. you can also talk to his school nurse or maybe psychologist to see what they suggest. best of luck to you!|`|LsE1RS0vaa	he may be sexually curious but i don't think he is like looking at your body or anything. he may just need someone to talk to. but you should bring it up with him and talk about these things. but he is at that age where he thinks about these things so now is pretty much the right time for the talk.|`|hfNXDCPQaa	That's not normal. I would be concerned if he was looking at me and I was his mother. That's gross. Talk to him about it is all you can do I guess.|`|ytl2PONXaa	Say what?!?    You boy is weird.|`|pPiAcYspaa	lol|`|ClcJKevdaa	wow, nasty............ tell him to quit|`|kK8JAMvUaa	he needs a girlfriend! haha.

You need to take him to the therapist. It has been proven that when boys do that, it is the start of a rapest if they don't get help. Maybe a playboy would help. actually it would help alot.|`|RExqAUGTaa	haha, jesus. I don't knonw what to say other than that's definately not normal.|`|nqBZoodWaa	14! and he wont look!!! bull crap, watch out for that boy!!|`|r9gBoBLCaa	He is fourteen! No this is not normal. He would be curious, actually he should be more than curious. Tell him that he is invading your privacy and it's wrong! God, when I was 12 my guy friends were watching porn, not their moms!|`|tDCvGWYeaa	well it sounds like he is getting curious.      The best thing that I could tell you (What my mother did for me) is just to tell him that if he ever had any questions about sex or anything that you will always answer.  My mother telling me that let me know that I wasn't going to get in trouble if i asked or if i was curious. I grew up without a father so i can connect this with your situation.  Just let him know that you are there for him in that area.  And if he doesn't understand right away, he will later on, guaranteed|`|wQcYAmY5aa	Are you a hot mom?

If he is looking at his mom its called incest which is wrong. You should tell him that females don't like to be watched while taking showers because only perverts do that? and ask your son is he a pervert?|`|HresywF6aa	Alright this is what your going to do. Slap the piss out of him next time he disobeys you when you tell him to leave. Then he will second guess every time he goes to sneak a peak. You also should bother him about not have a girlfriend and such.|`|n8k1rjXqaa	u should not handle it he can do it himself if u think u raised him good enough to handle himself if a girl wants to have sex with him i guess he knows to say no thats his problem but lol serious question for yahoo answers
AA11961672	actually you might be  having sex with your current partner too often. Having sex everyday lowers his sperm count...Also make sure he is wearing boxers not briefs (it's better for his swimmers)  and try getting ovulation kits, that way you can find out when you ovulate so you will know the best days to have sex.

hlOawARXaa	You can get pregnant while you are on your period, before it, after it; most people think you can only get pregnant when you are ovulating but thats not true, you are just more likely to get pregnant then. Consider yourself lucky you didn't get pregnant this time, just be more careful next time.    Edit: you had sex during your last period...ok, yes there is a large chance you could be pregnant, especially since he came in you 3 times    Edit Again: Since I have received an email about saying you have a large chance of getting pregnant, I'm going to explain myself a lil bit. If you had said you had sex w/o a condom, or you said I had sex but I wasnt ovulating, or I had sex but he pulled out before he came, I would have still said you had a large chance of being pregnant, because it only takes one time to get pregnant, pre-*** can get you pregnant. If you had said I had sex but we used a condom or I was on birthcontrol I would have said there is always a chance but most likely you arent because you took the proper precautions to protect yourself. Sperm can live inside you for up to 7 days, thats another reason I said there is a chance you could get pregnant. I hope this maybe clears things up a little bit, I'm not trying to scare you I'm just telling you how I view it.|`|u1uECuFNaa	You can get pregnant anytime.    ANd yes, during your period.   Oddly enough I am watching I DID NOT KNOW I WAS PREGNANT and that was one of the questions they asked. Too bad there is no reward, huh?  You can also bleed during your pregnancy. Not a period but blood like one.   Scary, huh?|`|kCTGf3qfaa	Yes.  You can.|`|KMtd5gr0aa	I was always told no... but my sister swears she did. so anythings possible|`|Fx77zYhWaa	If you got your period then you're not pregnant but you can get pregnant from sex you had while you're on your period.  If you have a week long period and have sex towards the end of it and have a short cycle the sperm can live long enough in you for you to ovulate and fertilize the egg.  Having sex on the 2nd day is pretty safe though.|`|5k0FKWTSaa	If your cycles are regular, and this is indeed your period, then NO you will not get pregnant if you had unprotected sex on the 2nd day of your period.     You should however, use at least condoms, to prevent sexually transmitted disease! And that's just good practice. Prevention is better than cure, and believe me, the longterm implications/complications from STDs on a woman's life can be devastating. I've seen enough heartbreaks and manky pelvic organs to fully appreciate the consequences.    Condoms are not just to prevent pregnancies.     This is sound advice. If you are old enough to have sex, then you are old enough to make your own decisions on whether you would like to protect yourself.    p/s: MEDICAL STUDENT,... I think you should go read your OB&GYN text books properly. What kind of witchcraft are you spouting! Shame on you!|`|dvoelIXIaa	You can get pregnant anytime. Even if you are on your period. And even if you are not.|`|lm0nlP04aa	You can get pregnant anytime, even during your period.  Ovulation can occur early or late, sometimes you can ovulate twice in one month.  The act of sex can bring on ovulation in some women.  Also men constantly emit a small amount of sperm during sex, not just with ejaculation.  So always use protection.|`|rM7BrLtjaa	you can get pregnant anytime depending onr your situation however during your period is highly unlikely especially if it was on the second day. at that point there is no where for the sperm to live also it can only live so long before it dies. if you have a fairly regular and healthy cycle then the sperm will die well before you ovulate. my suggestion is to not worry you are probably not plus... stress can make your period late also try drinking lots of herbal teas with cinnamon. cinnamon can help your period  if it is late, or even if you have bad cramps. I suggest  the Market Spice original (cinnamon orange) or the Good Earth "Sweet and Spicy". no more than 3 cups a day though. good luck!
UXoTCL98aa	gosh ur story sounds just like mine. I came off the pill on the 31st of Dec. and bled ( but from what im told it wasnt a period its just withdrawel bleeding from stopping the pill) from the 3rd til the 5th.  ive also taken home preg tests since then and theyve said neg. but still no period. some people have told me that i may be testing to early since after stopping bc ur period will more than likely come later than it usually does.  so i still have hope that i may be pregnant and am going to retest in another week and go get a blood test done also to make sure.   Im gonna follow ur question to see what others tell u bc ur story is similar to mine.|`|SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    Yes there is a chance that you can be pregnant, don't be too disappointed if you are not because some woman's bodies can take a few months to ovulate again after coming off the pill.  In my first pregnancy my body took 5 weeks to produce hcg levels for a urine test to detect, it just depends on how your body is.    Thing i would advise is going to the doctors and having a blood test done to be more accurate.  Best of luck xx
5k0FKWTSaa	If you think that that's the cause of your abdo pain, then yes... stop the pill and get another kind as soon as possible. However, you'd be at risk of falling pregnant, so use other forms of contraception such as condoms until you've taken the new BC pill for 7 days.|`|AA12316174	No take some painkillers it can take your Body up to 3 packs to fully adjust so cramping and spotting in between is normal|`|Fx77zYhWaa	No, unless the pain is bad I'd wait.  It might go away and it's possible it's not related to the pill you're taking now.
SDHmVDlNaa	Don't worry just yet.  I bled all through my pregnancies and the blood was much more than that and I have four children now.  My doctor told me that you may sometimes have a little spot of blood at the time of your period even during pregnancy. It is just a hormonal dip and means nothing.  Or you may have been exercising strenuously or something and torn a blood vessel. Not to worry yet.  Go lie down and try to stay calm and maybe call the doctor in the morning and see if they can get you in to be checked tomorrow.  As long as there is no cramping going on you are okay.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    if you were constipated could be from that. or had any trouble going to the toilet. it could be cervix irritation . if sex occured.    if not. I had bleedin at 16 weeks - Spotting. light light period. i went to the E.r and they did blood tests. two times i went in.  And they put me on bed rest for 1.5 weeks. Strict bed rest. They told me it meant Threatned mis.c that i could or i may not. But to drink lots of fluids and keep calm and in bed.. Only to toilet and shower. otherwise always bed rest. no work or anything    of course you have every right to be concerned. AS long as its not heavy or cramping alongside. you are okay.  Since you have had 2 misc, you are at high risk. i would go to the doctors and speak to them to make sure.  But everything will be fine.

Around half of all pregnant women have a little bleeding in the early months of pregnancy. Although some of these women may later suffer a miscarriage, the majority carry on to have normal and straightforward pregnancies. Some women bleed for a few days around the time of their expected periods, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy. This bleeding is usually much lighter than a normal period, but may be accompanied by discomfort - sometimes even pain - and a heavy, dragging feeling. The medical term for this sort of bleeding is 'decidual' bleeding. The 'decidua' is the innermost lining of the uterus, the part lost during each menstrual period. Experts think that this bleeding is from that part of the decidua that is not yet covered by the developing embryo and placenta. Very early bleeding may be 'implantation' bleeding rather than decidual bleeding. Implantation bleeding happens about two weeks after conception, when the fertilised egg reaches the uterus and embeds in the soft lining. Special cells surrounding the egg burrow deep into the lining, almost like a seed putting out tiny roots. This is the start of the placenta. Some women loose a little blood when this takes place. Implantation bleeding rarely lasts for more than a day.     It seems like at some point every woman has heard that their sister's friend's cousin had a period while they were pregnant. Or "oh I bled throughout my pregnancy and didn't know I was pregnant because it was my period!" This is a myth. Women often confuse any vaginal bleeding as their period because that is what they are used to happening. You did not experience a period; you experienced vaginal bleeding! This is a common a common occurrance and a wide misconception.       You cannot have a period while you are pregnant because both of these functions cannot happen at the same time. If you were pregnant and began menstruating, inevitably you would lose the pregnancy or have a miscarriage. Although you can't be pregnant and have a period at the same time, you can, in fact, experience vaginal bleeding and continue to be pregnant. These are two very different terms: vaginal bleeding and menstruation (period), but it is usually vaginal bleeding that women confuse as their periods.     Bleeding early in pregnancy, as in the first trimester, is scary, but luckily it usually doesn't signal a problem. It is also rather common among women. There are a few common causes of first-trimester bleeding, none of which is an indication of trouble.       1. Normal implantation of the pregnancy into the uterine wall. This bleeding, which sometimes also occurs when a fertilized egg (embryo) attaches itself to the wall of the uterus (generally two to five days after conception), is brief and light and only lasting a couple of days. Implantation normally occurs around five to ten days after conception.     2. Hormonal changes when the period would have otherwise occurred. This type of bleeding is also usually very light, but it can sometimes seem like an actual period. Many women report that they do actually bleed regularly during the early portion of their pregnancy, none of which is a true menstrual period, and this is usually the culprit for that. It is often referred as early pregnancy bleeding and is caused by hormonal changes in the body due to the pregnancy. This is also rather common among women and, again, can appear to be a menstrual period. It's not though.     3. It could be a subchorionic bleed. This is when a small blood clot forms at the edge of the placenta. It usually stops on its own and isn't normally an emergency. But your doctor will want to monitor this with ultrasound to be sure that the clot has resolved itself.     4. Decidual bleeding. This is period-like bleeding (but not your period) when your hormones may get out of whack. It will cause you to loose parts of the lining along the uterine wall. This is especially common in the very early stages of pregnancy because the lining hasn't had a chance to completely attach to the placenta. Although a scary thought, it is not generally considered to be a health risk to neither mother or baby.       5. Getting pregnant while on the pill. This is often associated with bleeding during a pregnancy and can be confused with a menstrual period. Many women will have several bleeding episodes before they realize something isn't right. This will cause the woman to be unable to accurately tell her doctor when her last real menstrual cycle because of the confusion, and an ultrasound will be required to determine an estimated due date.       Often the real case can't be pinpointed, but the bleeding stops spontaneously and in the situations above, the pregnancy continues just fine. As a precaution though, any bleeding should be reported to your practitioner so that he or she can evaluate it. Record whether it is intermittent or persistent, when|`|Cdkd4oQ7aa	Don't freak out. Stress can do really bad things to your body and your health. Stay calm, and tell yourself not to go crazy until you get real answers.  But you should call your OBGYN. You don't want to play around with this sh*t!! Your health and your baby's health are number 1!!!! As an EMT, I would say that that amount of blood does not sound excessive. But my motto is "better safe than sorry." Better to "waste" the hour to go in and get checked out, than to assume that a tiny amount is nothing, and have complications later. Even just calling and running it by your doc couldn't hurt. He/she may say, "don't worry about it," or he/she may say "come in right away."|`|bm1rsts7aa	Well go to the doctor but it's probably just a little spotting.|`|W2F1T3HSaa	Idk.I have never been pregnant so i wouldnt know.|`|8D6COFfhaa	you could have scratched your butt and it starting bleeding|`|sTGX3Puzaa	hun....im sorry to say this but you might be havin a miscarriage|`|sdYoRJnUaa	maybe your baby is kicking to hard|`|j49IqTdiaa	spotting is perfectly normal during the first 16 weeks of pregnancy|`|TrauHaubaa	your fine. :)|`|E46glB9Kaa	CHECK  may be ectopic pregnancy. not sure.. but must go to doctor.. don't want to scare you but i read somehwere that ectopic pregnancy is liek that... go to the doctor|`|1drXUvLiaa	Hopefully not a miscarriage... :(|`|dvoelIXIaa	Well I would call a doctor to tell him/her what is going on.

KeevlZnTaa	There is such a thing as salt poisoning, or Hypernatraemia. However, I think that quite a bit of salt has to be ingested for this to occur. It could have been that he is not used to so much salt being on his food, and it caused an upset stomach, and vomiting. It is also possible that he just had a short lived virus, I work with children and see kids that get sick suddenly and it only last half a day or so.|`|dBaCusz6aa	yes.

He will continue to accrue the child support debt, PLUS interest.  The sad fact is, though, if he's unemployable or chooses to work under the table, he will NEVER pay back his support debt and staying in jail and continuing to accrue the debt will just mean more he's expected to pay back.  He'll never have a license to drive, as long as he's behind, and he'll never get another tax return, if he tries to file one!      I am in the same situation with four young children to support.  I have stopped counting on him to support my children a long time ago.  There is not much you can do, because the state considers jail the last resort for men who simply will not pay.  It is really sad that he's figured out how to utilize the system to his best advantage: free support, room and board AND insurance... while you and your child are struggling!  I can only say that there will be an ultimate judgment for men like him and he will have eternal consequences for it!  The only other recourse we might have is if EVERYONE protested the laws by contacting our law makers and suggesting something which doesn't feed off the government, like forcing them into slave labor until their debt is paid off.  But, then again..... well, you know where this discussion could be headed!    Meanwhile, you will have to find a way to support yourself.  It's that simple.  Take good care and good luck.

Many Blessings,  R|`|VygBNA0Waa	dont worry about the stupid man no more  if the child asks why is daddy in jail say because he has to by law look after you darl and he is not doing it so they put him in jail so he could learn to look after his child|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I heard that if it gets bad enough for the man to be in jail for not paying child support that when they get out, it's sort of a clean slate and he doesn't have to pay anything because he served time. You might want to look into that.......I could be wrong though.|`|f3n2zXG2aa	The guy has mental problems, let him stay in there.  The child does not need a Dad like that out on the streets.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	But the important detail to remember is, he doesn't pay for anything in jail.|`|mRvZq0VZaa	Get a job|`|28WJwHf4aa	Leave this loser behind and move on with your life.    Your child is better off not having a father at all than have someone like him as a 'role model'.
rHufcHwHaa	yep, completely normal.  My doc said it'll come and go til 28 weeks.  I'm 24 weeks now and I feel my daughter most days, but not every day.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Yes, it's normal. I'm 16 weeks and sometimes I don't feel it.  If you go to babiesRus you can buy this doplar machine for like $20, I don't know how good the quality is but if it will ease your mind to hear the heart beat it might be worth it. When youre further along and actually feeling kicks and you don't feel them for a while, I would worry but not right now.  Good Luck :)|`|KMtd5gr0aa	Very  much so normal... Ur baby isnt going to move 24/7|`|vZwJyqc6aa	Yes very normal. I have felt my first 'flutters' the past few days but didn't feel them today. It is completely normal.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	i'm 13 weeks and 1 day and i felt my first flutter last night, it felt like a muscle spasm or a flick from the inside. crazy feeling huh!? i knew it was my baby :)    and mine stopped as well, today i applied gentle pressure to my abdominal area where i felt my baby move last night, and i felt a little poke.    baby is still small so we wont feel them every other minute...especially me, i'm three weeks behind you!|`|15UZwW2laa	I'm 19 weeks and I'm going through the same thing.  The other day I felt the baby moving all day long and then the next day I only felt it move a few times.  It's normal.|`|rl1IITqRaa	Don't be too worried! I felt flutters at 16 weeks...some days I'd feel it constantly..other days, nothing at all. I didn't feel him constantly until 22 weeks. It's normal =)|`|dvoelIXIaa	Yes it is normal. When you move around a lot you can't feel your baby all the time. And at 16 weeks you can't feel EVERY little movement you little one makes. They aren't that strong|`|e39a79f6daf722c960330aea2db67b78aa	Don't worry about a thing!! It's absoloutley and completely normal. First of all, with your first baby, you shouldn't be feeling anything yet anyways, so you're lucky that you felt the 'quickening' at all. That you don't feel it anymore now can be contributed to many different things.. all very normal. Change in fetal position, change in growth, the growing uterus allowing the baby more room and less chance of banging into your tummy. Lots of things. I wouldn't be worried.|`|5k0FKWTSaa	If you are slim, and had babies before, you may feel flutterings as early as 15-16 weeks. First time mothers may not feel flutterings till 18-22 weeks! ( I didn't feel mine till 21 weeks with my first baby) However, you are not expected to feel regular fetal movements until 28 weeks gestation.     So, yes, it's NORMAL for you not to feel the flutterings everyday. Don't panic. The risk of a miscarriage is lower now that you're in your second trimester (past 12 weeks).    Just enjoy the flutterings when it occurs! :)    p/s: I wouldn't advise buying a Doppler - In the hands of someone who doesn't know how to use it properly (And I do not mean switching the machine on. Your midwife/ OBGYN will know how to look for and identify your baby's heartbeat and know how to differentiate it from anything that's not fetal heartbeats -  such as the swishing from your own blood vessels or from the blood flow through the umbillical cord. Can you honestly tell me that you would know what to look for and be 100% certain it is your baby's hearbeat and not something else) it can be a source for more anxiety.
SjYbkWdQaa	no your fine|`|u7ALmspMaa	There is always the possibility, even if you have your period, but with all those things happening (period,he out, birth pills) I would say its highly unlikely that you are. Hope this is the result you were looking for, because I really think its very difficult in this case..  good luck anyway!|`|dvoelIXIaa	There is always a chance that you are pregnant when you are on or off birth control.     But because you are on birth control, you do have a slimmer chance. And the fact that you got your period, you should be okay.     But there are those women who still get there periods when they are pregnant. So I would just take a test to be sure.|`|rtCLJHlLaa	Yes. You can get pregnant while on the pill. It doesn't always work. My mother was actually a birth control baby and so was my best friend. You still need to use protection.
mBeGdFO2aa	yes, that's normal.  Talk to your doctor about it at your next appointment, but it's normal :)|`|K2jT1z5jaa	yes it is very normal as more blood is being passed through the body. And hormonal changes are occuring.So yes normal.  Try drinking more water. Hopefully help. if not. Try standing up. A bit slower.    God Bless x|`|8THz1sp9aa	yes, it's common to get dizzy & very clumsy when you are pregnant. just make sure you get up slowly, and be careful. congrats by the way! :]|`|yNXIxcsYaa	Yes, it's common, but make sure you mention it to your doctor the next time you go in and see them.  I nearly fainted three times during my pregnancy - it was NOT fun!|`|e39a79f6daf722c960330aea2db67b78aa	You can expect that this is a problem that will persist throughout your entire pregnancy. Congratulations!! lol     It is very normal to feel light headed.. you're having ALOT of your bloodflow diverted to your uterus to assist in making the baby, as well as to help your growing uterus. So.. with all that blood being diverted from your brain to your belly.. you're going to feel light headed.|`|5UcdeeX8aa	You need to start drinking more water. It is common but it's usually caused from being dehydrated. Your body is working overtime to give your baby what it needs to grow, so if you're not getting enough sleep at night that can be a problem. The 3 things most important right now for you is water, sleep and vitamins.|`|dvoelIXIaa	Yes that is very normal. Just take your time getting up and moving around. And you will be fine|`|rtCLJHlLaa	I've never been light headed but I do get very bad headaches.

4n94YsUJaa	I'm TTC for  2 and I've read that it is harder to conceive while you are overweight.  It interferes with the ovulation process. If you pursue a healthier weight for you it might be beneficial to you and the baby.|`|596ddaee42df0ec8a6b9d7b4242c6338aa	No complications, no problems.  5'6" and 250 pounds.|`|eemmWU0Haa	Damn your tall, Im only 5ft1:S|`|KMtd5gr0aa	U'll be ok.

There maybe some issues with conceiving if you're not having a regular period and there are lots of problems that could come along with you being pregnant to you and your baby.  You can have a healthy pregnancy and healthy baby but you're at risk for gestational diabetes, pre-term labor, high blood pressure, etc.|`|5UcdeeX8aa	Pregnancy is the only time we actually get to feel good about being fat. I wouldn't worry too much. You might be overweight but for your height you are like the same as my Mom and she had 8 kids just fine.|`|qNaEadD2aa	There can be plenty of problems including gestational diabetes and more difficulties in labour etc... I too am over weight (currently 98kg and 22 weeks pregnant with baby number 1 and im only 5'3) and so far my pregnancy has been ok.    Some hospitals wont deliver your baby if you are over a certain weight or if your BMI is too high.. check it out.    I would suggest you speak to your doctor.|`|uERNKwOYaa	i'm 5'4" and was 170 pounds (so about 45 pounds overweight) when i got pregnant. i've had no complications or anything. =)
scdOdaTKaa	With irregular periods like that it's really hard to say or give advice. But if you bded everyday then you certainly covered your ovulation time=)  If I were you I would just wait a week take another test, and keep doing that until you get a BFP or your AF.  Meanwhile take your prenatal vitamins and keep baby dancing!  Good luck and lots of baby dust!
heC9aQ18aa	I like both Declan and Anderson but I think the best of the two is Anderson David Wright. That is the best name ever. I hope you pick that one. My son was going to have David as a middle name too. It's a family name. Anyway, I would go with Anderson David but Declan is fine too. Michael is way too common. Good luck choosing the right name for your baby. It's no easy task.|`|YvNOfM2xaa	Oh they are both beautiful.  Maybe you could make it Dlyan David Wright?

Its a nice name and if you named him Anderson, most people would probably call him "Andy".|`|uT3QJslxaa	Declan is a very rare male first name and a very rare surname (source: 1990 U.S. Census). You should really go for it. It will be unique and and a very nice name also.|`|49fd9dd81cd8edeb86be5ea81f7c8b7daa	I like both names, I like Declan more as a first name but the second choice really stands out to me. The complete name Anderson David Wright is so stunningly strong, intelligent. I already have a complete picture of this character as an honest and charming man. I can't really picture a fat little chubby cheeked baby with it but you can find some nick names.|`|8EOsR96eaa	Anderson David Write|`|u1uECuFNaa	hmmm  Shortened...I like Andy.   Er...Anderson David Wright.|`|AA11138222	Declan is GREAT! I don't think it's weird. I've heard it more than once lately, it's a nice Irish name.

Also, there is a little boy at my nephews preschool, and his name is Chase Anderson, like first and middle names. I thought that was the cutest name I had ever heard in my life. I thought maybe since you liked Anderson, maybe you'd like the flowyness of Chase with it or another one-syllabled name sounds good with it too. Like Ty Anderson, Owen Anderson (2 syll) Wes Anderson, Paul Anderson, and things like that. I hope I helped & good luck!|`|NBf5q2f5aa	declan sooo cute|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	Anderson|`|SF5WnQFQaa	I like David Anderson Wright better than Anderson David Wright|`|DekGIOImaa	I really like Anderson...it's different and it has a nice ring to it.|`|Fg06DgT1aa	Declan Michael Wright      Have a nice life time.|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	Declan Michael Wright, because Anderson is a last name not a first name!

2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	Are you doing the cross legged cradle/ kangaroo type carry? I don't have that particular sling, but I do use a sling. If he doesn't feel particularly supported try scooching  his bottom down a bit so his neck is still withing the top of the sling. You can also put a towel or something behind him to make him feel "tighter"    http://www.snugglez.co.nz/sling_cradle_c...|`|IVSqQQzlaa	I have one that is exactly the same just another brand.  I've only used it once myself because I find it kills my back.  My baby's father used it a few times with no problems when our son was 2 months old.  My son was sleeping at the time.  We didn't have any problems with him slipping down.  How old is your baby?  My son is 3 months and a bit now.  We tried him in it again last week and now he wants to sit up all the time so it didn't work very well.  I don't think it's made for any kind of sitting position but I could be wrong (that's based on the pictures on the box).    EDIT:  I just read some of the reviews on the Amazon website which see to suggest you can do a hip carry with this sling.  Does anyone know how you do it with this type? I'm having a hard time figuring it out and there was no picture on the box showing that way??    EDIT  2:   I just got mine out and was trying to figure it out but my baby's in bed so I'll have to wait until tomorrow  to try it out properly.  I bought mine in Mexico (at Walmart) so the instructions were in Spanish and I threw them out (but there wasn't a picture showing the hip carry).  I hope you figure it out and if you do please post again!  I would love to see a picture for this sling showing how it's done.|`|cUfOnldzaa	I use a wrap, and it's very secure.

ibWLdXlJaa	He'll do it when he's ready. My son has been trying for a bit now. He will roll himself over and push up but he's kinda chunky so he is having problems getting his knees up and going lol. Definitely encourage/praise him when he tries but I don't know what else you could do to help him so i'll be checking back for tips myself!|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	Once your son has the upper body strength to get to a mini push up, and then up and rocking on hands and knees (or elbows and knees). It won't take much. You can encourage it by pacing a toy just out of arms reach... or you can just let him go on his own. You can praise him and smile and say yay when he gets ready for it, but even if you don't he'll still end up moving.|`|c3d9621b66bbf4d52837a662d4822489aa	The signs are getting up on his knees and bobbing back and forth without moving his knees from that spot. At that point, start putting things he really wants in front of him..just outta his reach. Believe it or not..a dang plastic Huggies diaper bag got my daughter moving! But, that is about all the encouragement you want to give him. You will know the signs when you see it...it's the cutest thing when they wanna go..but just can't..haha.|`|TkSY2ZUfaa	He doesn't need help, just put him down on the carpet regularly and he'll crawl if he wants to..|`|vIKrnvx4aa	I was told to encourage my son.  We bought him one of those balls that rolls on its own and plays music - our son started scooting in two days (he was already trying to get up on his knees), but wanting something is a real motivator.  In two months, my son has learned to pull himself across the floor, then crawl, and now he can pull himself up.  So, my experience says encourage him.|`|78c2d087dcd8cfdc713abe3185e0b093aa	It is  a learned behavior, but I believe encouragement does wonders. I got down on the floor with my son and crawled around in front of him. He would study my every move, and soon he was chasing me down the hallway, under the kitchen table, around furniture, etc. First he'll learn to get up on all fours. Then after he builds strength from that, he'll start to rock back and forth. At this point I started also moving his hand forward, then his opposite knee, hand, knee, just to help him get the concept. Then one day he'll be able to crawl a few "steps" then probably fall, and it will be a very "choppy" crawl for awhile, but in no time he'll be a pro.
cyb10kteaa	hey you asked me why I lost my baby at 5 mos. It was because I got a tear in the amniotic sac and the fluid leaked out slowly over the course of 3 weeks. It was the saddest thing and the dr. said it was a fluke situation. nothing was wrong with either one of us after they did some tests. Hope all goes well with you.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Definitely. If she gave your baby's gender on the basis of seeing 3 lines (the labia) then the chances of having a girl are pretty high :) congrays!|`|DutTBV3caa	i'd trust you're doctor for now. they do that for a living so they know what they're talking about. if you're unsure about it have then check again next time. it wont hurt them to check a few times lol    congrats :)|`|15UZwW2laa	With my son it was very apparent that he was a boy!  I would think that it was a girl for you...boys are just to obvious.|`|5cd7d92999d5de22f8d5e5597eb9e350aa	I suggest you wait a bit longer and try and find out at a later day, Im 38 wks and the first time I asked at 4 mnths my doctor said boy,but he was only 70% sure cause the legs were crossed and the baby was in the breached position ,then i got sick and went see a specialist and he said it was a girl, then a week ago my original doctor said boy and that he was 100% sure,so i suggest you wait until the baby is much further along.|`|XzbRZCPUaa	i wouldn't go painting the room pink just yet . 16 weeks is a little early the best time is around 20  wait until the next ultrasound   good luck
78c2d087dcd8cfdc713abe3185e0b093aa	At first I had an Evenflo double electric pump...it was junk.  I ended up paying about $300 for a Medela Pump in Style Advanced and I LOVE IT. I work full time and exclusively give my son breastmilk. He's never had an ounce of formula. I pump 3 times a day at work and with this pump it only takes about 6-7 minutes pumping both sides at the same time.  It was worth every penny. I also pump once at night before going to bed with an older model medela pump that was given to me and even that one is better than  the Evenflo. My son is now 10 months old and I've been doing this since he was 3 months.  The Medela Pump in Style Advanced has a "let down" mode that has about two minutes of shorter bursts of sucking to promote the let down and stimulate milk supply. I've never used a manual pump but they look kind of awkward to use. You can find Medela pumps on ebay for cheaper, even used ones and you can just purchase new "horns" (the part that actually touches the breast) for relatively cheap. So if you are planning to pump long term...it's worth the investment to buy a better model. Good luck!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	It all depends how often you plan to pump?    Are you going back to work? How old will the baby be?  How many hours a week?|`|xGedX2rIaa	you can hire hospial grade ones at the chemist for not much at all, there electric so its nice and fast. but if you want a hand held avent is good.|`|ddP3klT3aa	Electric is much better. I would start with a manual one first just in case breast feeding doesn't work out. Avent manual pump works for a lot of people. Worked for me. But it does take forever..any manual pump will.|`|EMKuBql8aa	My wife used Medela Swing, she loved it.    She tried a manual but her hands got tired, so she ended up buying the Medela Swing.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	Hi Congrats on your new baby coming and for choosing to breastfeed...I have been breastfeeding my 14 month old since birth and I work part time...I use the MEdela Double Electric Pump...it is a really good pump and it is easy to use and especially good if you are planning on going back to work...I can pump both breasts at the same time in about 10-15 mins total and be done...|`|AA11403695	i never tried the manual. but the electric is easiest.  It does all the work.  I think mine is a medela.  It's really old maybe 10 years old been through 4 children and is still working great.|`|XHFj2IVhaa	A warning - go easy with it until your breasts "toughen up".. Don't use it above medium or you'll risk painful damage to breast tissue..|`|wUWvO5r6aa	I am not a big breast women but not small I am a 36b and I didn't like the electric breast pumps at ALL. I bought one that was average in price and hated it I end up using the manual one I love it. But one think is that you do get tired of pumping.
s4LWmcTjaa	Yes I do.    To me it's acceptable if the child is being willfully and knowingly defiant or disrespectful.    I personally don't spank anymore due to my own temper issues, but I am not against it if others use it responsibly and in the proper context.    I say it's acceptable to use until your child is mature enough to act like a responsible person.    Really I don't care if a parent spanks or not.  As long as the discipline structure in the home works and is effective, then do what works for your kids.  For us, my husband is the one that spanks.  He's a responsible disciplinarian that I trust.  Me?  I tend to have a temper so I stick with time outs, stern looks and a stern tone of voice.  So far, so good for us.|`|7AYnWg3paa	YES when they dont listen the first 2 times.....3 strikes and ure out..its not okay when ure doing it sadistically as a bully and not as discipline|`|UUpsa35Daa	Personally, i won't spank or swat when i have children due to my past with abuse...i just wouldn't feel right doing it.    But, i do fully respect the parents who can safely and responsibly spank their kids. One open handed spank on a clothed bottom is okay i think...it's enough to get the point across that what was done is unacceptable.    As far as ages... I think a 2 fingered hand "knock" can be started at one. Just slightly bumping their hand saying "no, that's an owie" or something.    Actually spanking i think can be started around 4, 3 at the earliest but even that's a little iffy for me. And i don't think it should go past 8 years old.|`|sxecXFgraa	I think it is OK to spank your child.  Timeouts don't work for every child in every situation and neither does taking something away for a period of time.  Spanking was never my first choice of punishment but my kids knew it was there for me to use.  I haven't had to spank either of my kids for awhile now, they're almost 7 and 10.  I believe my 10 yr old is to old for them, but if she crosses the line, I might change my mind.    I should add that I've never been called to the daycare or school because my kids have hit another child and/or their teacher.  Also, I have a great relationship with my kids, they don't fear me but they do respect me and other people.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Absolutely not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|0SeDvhJ9aa	Yes.    Its okay to spank them when they misbehave, epecially when its willful disobediance or something very serious or dangerous.  They should not be spanked when it is something minor, accidental, or obviously if they are well behaved.    I am for it as long as they deserve it.    If the kid is younger than 4 it seems like they could be seriously injured from even a light swat, so I don't think thats a good idea.  By the time they get to about 12 they should know better and spanking should not be an issue.  However if a teenager persists in acting like a little kid they should probably be treated like one.|`|28WJwHf4aa	It really depends on the child. Some children respond better to a swat; some are fine with time-outs.    And it should be just a swat. No bare bottoms. No objects, just hands. No marks left. Just a swift little swat to get their attention. Anything above that can be seen as abuse.    Ages...I would say 3-7, maybe older, maybe younger. Again, it really depends on the child.|`|E2UXN7J1aa	I think smacking their hand when they are a toddler and telling them no is perfectly acceptable. I really am not for spanking, but that is just me. I'm not going to say that it is horrible and child abuse, because I did get spanked when I was younger and it was for my own good. If they do something serious well that maybe a spanking is something to consider, but frankly after the age of 10 that is just inappropriate.|`|NxNrZksXaa	i think it is okay... just like the bible said, "spare the rod, spoil the child".. i was raised up with spankings and so were my aunts, mom, and cousins. you wouldn't dare catch us biting, hiting, scratching, or cussin out our parents or grandparents like some of these ppl's children on Y!A do. it is ok to swat/spank them when they need discipline. simple as that.|`|c3d9621b66bbf4d52837a662d4822489aa	-I am for it  -I am against it when it isn't used as a last resort  -There is no "right" age I guess, I think it is just when they no longer listen to the firm "No"s or getting themselves into danger|`|chfILbonaa	Depends on the kid im 14 and well i have problems menally because my bio mom abused me adn my brother when we where uder 6 months of age and my other dad (adopted when i was 2) spankse me when i was 6-12 i was completely terrified of him sometimes i threatned to call police and well i culdnt really get away from him but now my parents are divrced other than that i still see him but he wont try it because my mom would beat the sh1t out of him|`|10YksH8caa	when a child repeatedly disobeys, you need to spank, I started slapping the hand when my kids started walking when they were starting to go into things, but now, they are 2.5 and 4 and I mainly slap my 2.5 year olds hand, and spank my 4 year old on the bottom, children need discipline, and I do not spank out of anger, I tell them why|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	I don't have a problem with parents who spank responsibly, but I couldn't bring myself to spank my son. We use the naughty corner effectively. The babysitter does something she calls "bipping on the mouth," which means she taps the kids mouths with her hand. I don't think she's done it to my son, only her own, but I'm okay with it. It gets their attention without hurting them. I would consider it appropriate from about 2 years to whenever it stops working.|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	Swat, yes, but spank, absolutely not.  "Spanking" is more like repeated hits rather than just one light swat to get their attention, and some people even find it necessary to use objects, which I think is really wrong!  I think a swat is okay just to get a young child's attention.  It just gets their attention but doesn't really hurt them.  If you're hitting them repeatedly with an object, the intent is obviously to cause physical pain, which I don't think is right.  And a swat should only be between the ages of  about 2 and 5-6.  Before 2 they aren't old enough to understand why they're being hit, and past 5 or 6 it's really pointless because other methods would be much more effective.  Older kids would probably much rather get a swat that's over and done with than have privileges taken away or be grounded!|`|VygBNA0Waa	i smack my child from the first time they walk until 5yrs old  this is what i do and it works well  i count  1 warning stop doing that   2 stand over the top and in a loud voice say 2  3 say 3 at the same time i say 3 hit on bum  now he is 7 and all i have to say is 1                   2 and he does what i ask because next one is a smack i havent need to smack him now for 2yrs|`|cUxdsuamaa	There is too many children out of control ,because of nutcases preventing parents from disciplining there children. I heard of parents have there kids tookin away for being to loud.|`|BrJGHetsaa	Yes, I think it's Okay to spank your child...    It's Ok when they are disrespectful...Disobey...or when they are mean or harmful to other children...I also spanked if they threw tantrums...(Very Important)...also in certain cases if they are doing something that could cause themselves serious harm (Sticking a fork in a light socket)    It's not Ok to spank if they make honest mistakes...Spilling a glass of milk...coloring on the walls...or not doing weel with homework...etc...Show them responsibilities in this case and build trust that they can make mistakes and come to you to resolve them (important later in life when they are teenagers...) Get a towel and clean it up...etc...Teaches them problem solving also....    Why Am I for it...Most importantly it teaches consequences that bad behavior will result in punishment...Later as they grow older they will understand that robbing a bank will land you time in jail...this is it's own deterent...If your not convinced Just watch nanny 911 or Super nanny...Time outs or reasoning with a child teaches the child ...I can do anything...and receive no consequences for my actions....this will manifest itself as they grow older ...Like the stuent in Virgina...If I don't get what I want...I'll throw a tantrum...only this time...I'm not going to stomp my feet ...I'l just get a gun and shoot...or have my way with a girl...etc...Think of Lord of the Flies....Kids need direction, guidance, and disipline in their life...If they don't get it...they will make up their own rules...With this said....    Some rules...    Don't spank your kids out of frustration...    NEVER hit your child...Slap or punch or with an object...    and never in the face, head or extremities...    When I spanked my children...It was 1 or 2 (No more than 2) with the flat of my hand on the butt...and not with excessive force...should be unconfortable but not leave lasting marks....    When Spanked...it was always followed up by an explanation on why they where spanked...why it was wrong...and what would happen if they did it again...Heart to heart...Also, once over...they were given a hug...and explained that I still loved them...unconditionally....    My final thought or advice...DO NOT try to be your childs best friend...you need to be their parent...This does not mean a strct house...or a stern relationship....I have fun with my children...we laugh...we play...they can joke...learn from mistakes...mentor them....teach them respect....values...life...and love....but I'm still their Father...and a parent...they have enough friends giving them bad advice...they don't need another....There is an advertisment...which shows a teenaged girl...resenting her parents for giving her a curfue, going through her room....asking her questions etc...Then thanks her parents...because she doesn't need a friend but a parent...    When to start spanking...2 3 years old when they can understand what you are saying to them....

I am for it; it's not child abuse. It's more appropriate for ages 2-8 when they're too young to know reason and all they can understand is that "mommy/daddy said no and they mean it". They can't really understand what or why, but they will when they're older. A 15 year old may just not listen to reason, and a good spanking can get them to listen up more than a grounding. Of course- you (legally) can't leave a mark for more than 24hours, but there needs to be some measure of pain to get their attention and it must be radically different between a 2 year old and a 15 year old (implements,   of swats, etc.)

The fact that they keep on reproducing gets tiresome and old.      The older kids get stuck with too many of the responsibilities that the parents should be doing and to me it seems like they are having more kids for the publicity.      It's time for them to stop.  At her age (she's nearing 43), she puts herself at risk for complications, birth defects for the baby and risking her own life.  And it would not be good to leave all 18 of your kids with no mother.      Bottom line, as others have said before:  The vagina is not a clown car!  I know that sounds so crass, but it's true.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Yes, but mostly for the freak factor. It's just so strange to see sooo many kids in one family, they aren't very interesting otherwise.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	Only twice, but never again. Those people are a bunch of Jesus-freak idiots who don't seem to understand that having 18 kids is ridiculous. The older kids end up doing all the work, because the parents are too busy popping out babies. They aren't even allowed to watch TV or kiss their girlfriends\boyfriends and be normal people. I think these parents are seriously flawed. If I was one of their kids I'd run away from home.|`|W8UZebRWaa	I watched the wedding special.  They are too weird for me.

I used to think that they were horrible people to actually having that many kids but since I started watching it I can now understand them a little better. I still dont think its a great ( or even good) idea to 'leave it up to God' to decide the size of your family but at least they are doing it on their own with no government help which cant be said for some other families.. I think they just have gone to a little extreme.. I think they and their kids are nice people but also the kids are missing out on being kids because they are used as surrogate parents for the younger ones.. I hope they all grow up without much issues :)   Jon and Kate I cant stand..she is so b*tchy it pisses me off|`|zeV5cCalaa	ive seen it once or twice  its so boring  the woman is like a chicken keeps laying eggs    ugghh|`|10YksH8caa	yeah, I like it|`|WwafMKN4aa	yes i watch it! i missed it last night because of an ice storm that went through!! and our dtv is still out today!! i dunno when i will get to watch the new one!|`|chfILbonaa	Yea im 14 i watch that jon and kate plus 8 and all those family shows including little people big world i love family shows and i usually learn quite a bit about kids and parenting in fact i wish i had a big family it would take alot of work but it would be worth it
7vVt5oN2aa	I started to feed my son rice cereal at 4 months and my doctor told me to stop.  They need the fatty acids they get from breast milk and formula.  Now that he has reached 6 months, I've re-introduced cereal as well as carrots and bananas.  I've heard that acidy fruits like apples and oranges should be left until they are a little older.  The acid will increase their diaper rash.|`|mjlhZAVxaa	No.  Listen and go by what the pedi says.  He or she will most likely tell you to wait until 4-6 months of age.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	People of our parents and grandparents generation fed their babies solids earlier than is generally recommended now.  Now the recommendation is to wait at least until 4 months and preferably 6 months.  Talk to your pediatrician.|`|XHFj2IVhaa	Lots of things were different when our parents raised us. Child-rearing seems the most different of all..!    It's not recommended to start out so young on anything other than cereal because the risk of food allergies supposedly is raised by a too-early introduction to solids...    As such, rice is the standard, until at least 4 - 6 months, if i remember correctly...    Heed your pediatrician, who's knowledge is more up-to-date than your family's...    Oh, and stand-tough against family who believe they know what's best for your baby...|`|ddP3klT3aa	Don't do any thing until you get the ok from his doctor. If the doctor says no, then no. Your parents are not always right. The doctor knows best. 4-6 months is the starting point. You start with rice cereal. And you never give them fruits before vegetables because they won't eat vegetables when you try (fruit is sweet). Listen to his doctor, not your family. Also, when you start solids, you give them the same thing for 4 days to make sure they are not allergic. Give him cereal for 4 days and see how he handles it. Then give him oatmeal. If you try two different, new things in one day, and he has a reaction, you won't know what caused it.|`|5f6XnInEaa	It's really up to you...but I'd really like to state that they have those guidelines in place for a reason, and that is your babies tummy may just not be ready for solids so young.    Medical science and research has changed a lot since your Grandparents had children...and the research has proved that introducing solids between the recommended months of 4 and 6 moths are better for your child's health.    Talk to your doctor..remember...there is no rush for solids, and they do not help a baby sleep better, or fill them up for longer!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	My mom smokes, all her siblings smoke, my step dad smokes, should I smoke?  I mean come on it will make my baby smaller, and its good for you, helps you loose weight, enhances effect on the pituitary-adrenal response to stress -or at least that's what docs said in the 50s.    Should I start smoking?    Doing something because "its what everyone else is doing" is the dumbest reason ever.  It kills smokers, and let the nazis kill the Jews.    Do your research, check your heart, your mind, your gut, and do what you think is right for YOUR CHILD.    http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/fit3.asp  If you start a food too early, he is much more likely to become allergic to it. This can result in damage to the intestines, weight loss, blood in the stool, and malnutrition. You might argue, "Well, my kids started solid foods at three weeks, and they turned out just fine." The truth is, very few adults have perfectly working digestive tracts. Just look at all the commercials for heartburn remedies and stool softeners... "ever feel gassy and bloated after a meal?"    http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/fit18.asp  No, you should wait until he is six months old, unless he is not gaining weight and your doctor advises you to start earlier. This subject keeps coming up, and the answer is still the same: the current recommendations (I didnt make these up) are to wait until six months before starting solids. Starting foods too early can result in digestive or allergy problems later in life. We have learned that the old guidelines of 4 months are just too soon, and I am willing to bet that in ten years we will be recommending later than 6 months. But for now, the six month guideline seems reasonable. Click  here, or here, to read previous FAQ's on starting solids or learn more by reading our Starting Solid Foods article.    http://www.askdrsears.com/html/3/t032000...  WHY WAIT? 6 REASONS    Gone are the days when pressured mothers stuffed globs of cereal into the tight mouths of reluctant six-week-olds. Nowadays parents feed their baby on the timetable that is developmentally and nutritionally correct -- as determined by their baby. Don't be in a rush to start solids. Here are some good reasons for waiting.    1. Baby's intestines need to mature. The intestines are the body's filtering system, screening out potentially harmful substances and letting in healthy nutrients. In the early months, this filtering system is immature. Between four and seven months a baby's intestinal lining goes through a developmental growth spurt called closure, meaning the intestinal lining becomes more selective about what to let through. To prevent potentially-allergenic foods from entering the bloodstream, the maturing intestines secrete IgA , a protein immunoglobulin that acts like a protective paint, coating the intestines and preventing the passage of harmful allergens. In the early months, infant IgA production is low (although there is lots of IgA in human milk), and it is easier for potentially-allergenic food molecules to enter the baby's system. Once food molecules are in the blood, the immune system may produce antibodies to that food, creating a food allergy . By six to seven months of age the intestines are more mature and able to filter out more of the offending allergens. This is why it's particularly important to delay solids if there is a family history of food allergy, and especially to delay the introduction of foods to which other family members are allergic.    2. Young babies have a tongue-thrust reflex . In the first four months the tongue thrust reflex protects the infant against choking. When any unusual substance is placed on the tongue, it automatically protrudes outward rather than back. Between four and six months this reflex gradually diminishes, giving the glob of cereal a fighting chance of making it from the tongue to the tummy. Not only is the mouth-end of baby's digestive tract not ready for early solids, neither is the lower end.    3. Baby's swallowing mechanism is immature. Another reason not to rush solids is that the tongue and the swallowing mechanisms may not yet be ready to work together. Give a spoonful of food to an infant less than four months, and she will move it around randomly in her mouth, pushing some of it back into the pharynx where it is swallowed, some of it into the large spaces between the cheeks and gums, and some forward between the lips and out onto her chin. Between four and six months of age, most infants develop the ability to move the food from the front of the mouth to the back instead of letting it wallow around in the mouth and get spit out. Prior to four months of age, a baby's swallowing mechanism is designed to work with sucking, but not with chewing.    4. Baby needs to be able to sit up. In the early months, babies associate feeding with cuddling. Feeding is an intimate interaction, and babies often associate the feeding ritual with falling asleep in arms or at the breast. The change fr|`|Zt0LkpEqaa	It all depends on the individual child, parents and doctors.  My nephew (I am a full time care-taker) started on rice cereal and oatmeal about 2.5 months old.  With the doctor's blessing we started feeding stage 1 veggies, fruits, and meats at age 3 months. Just before 4 months he started eating stage 2 baby foods.  Now he is five months old, eats 3 food meals a d ay and at least 32oz of formula and 8oz of water and fruit juce mix.    Now, I know this is not normal for his age as he is just 5 months old, but his doctor say that is fine because he is not over weight and he is very active.  I have cared for and know many babies who have started eating foods at 3 months and they are perfect fine.  Some babies do not take to food so early.   I would check with your doctor first for sure, but starting with rice ceareal and moving to oatmeal and then to veggies then fruits at about 3 months or shortly after should not be a problem.  Just make sure the baby is getting enough formula and water.  Constipation is a lot more common when they are eating "solids".   Just take your doctors advice and start slowly with the foods.  Don't force her to eat but, don't stop her if she likes it.

As far as having to change to please these people, absolutely NOT. Nobody should have to change for anyone, just think if that person doesnt accept you for who you are just because of how you look then you do not want to be with them. Thats why i refuse to get a boob job just because i have a small chest. A person's appearance is going to change with age, thats inevitable, and if a person likes you primarily for how you look now and then your appearance changes, what do you think that they are going to do??
Jo2DfRzaaa	I didn't start with my daughter until she was about 2.  My son is 17 mos and i have yet to need it for him.  As soon as what I'm doing now for him stops working, then I will start using time outs with him.|`|28WJwHf4aa	18 mos. old is a good age to start.    I do one warning before I put the child in time-out, except for when it is something physical (hitting, spitting, pushing)...that's an automatic time-out. Make sure you are explaining, briefly, why the child is going into time-out. One minute for every year of age. When the time is up, explain again, give hugs, and then continue on with your day.    A timer may work better for older children. Make sure you follow through consistently. And if the child gets up, start the time over. The ideal time-out spot is out of sight of the activity, as this drives kids absolutely insane and makes time-outs not fun. It can be a mat, chair, or bottom step of the stairs. I don't recommend holding them in your lap.|`|HyknHVV5aa	12 months, you can start with taking away toys or putting him on a chair facing the corner after doing obvious bad things!|`|10YksH8caa	they don't work|`|hl5WdXnbaa	some wheres between 18 months to 2 years I started with my son and it worked great.|`|AA11459214	We started at 14 months.

Hope this helps :)|`|VygBNA0Waa	don't bother just smack it hurts you more than the child and guaranteed to work|`|49f06b796d54e170c36a6cf4fc463182aa	I  worked at a daycare in the infant toddler rooms for five years and I have three children of my own. We started the time outs in the toddler room so at the age of fifteen months. We always tried redirection first because it is proven to work better at this age. But when they continued to do what they were not supposed to we would have them sit for a minute or two depending on how old they were. Of course taking things away is different. If a toddler is hitting with a toy or using it in another dangerous or innapropriate manor then it should be taken away immediatly.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	We introduced them at around 12-13 months old, but I think it may have been too early.  Our son really understood time outs when he was closer to 18 months old.      I'd say you can start at around 18 months old.  1 minute on a mat or in the corner can go a long way.    We won't be introducing it to our daughter until she's 18 months old.  Until then, redirection and a stern tone of voice is the best way to handle unwanted behavior.

I always know when I need to eat, because I always start to feel sick. When I was 5 weeks - 7 weeks I couldn't keep anything down I had terrible morning sickness and had to LOA from work. I would eat small meals, make sure you eat a lot of fruits, blueberries really helped ease my stomach, but acidic fruits made it worse. Everyone is different though so experiment and find out what your baby wants and doesn't want. Congrats and good luck! :)|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Yes...I was eating 5 small meals a day. I lived with a thermos of ice water by my side and it helped, but I would never wait too long to eat because the sickness would show up.|`|rymbwVKXaa	its very normal. try to eat like meat and cheese or fruit and cheese. something small when you get hungary. Eat crackers or something before you get out of bed too. that always helps.|`|fC1HUgAAaa	Yes that's exactly what you should be doing. Constantly have a handful of healthy snacks nearby in case you start to feel hungry. As long as you keep something in your stomach you can usually keep the nausea at bay. Also avoid anything extra greasy or spicy, it will just irritate your tummy more. Bland foods are best. Don't worry in a few weeks (usually) it goes away on its own. I was really sick with my first until about 14 weeks. With this one, I was only sick until 12 weeks. Feel better! :)|`|ce437eacba23b245ed5c4ee833f7b13daa	Small meals through out the day are best.  I'm having my third baby and all of them I've had horrible morning sickness.  If I don't eat when I'm first hungry, puke, eat to much.. puke, eat the wrong food..puke.  Keep crackers with you all the time they help battle it.  BUt about five small meals a day can be a great help too.  Most times the sickness wears off in the second trimester, so keep your head up for now.|`|PfLg9B6aaa	Im the same way.  Im 12 weeks tomorrow and I love eating but Ive realized if I eat dry cheerios throughout the day I don't throw them up which before I used to throw everything up but I eat them in the morning and through out the day with my other food.  That seems to be the one thing my baby doesn't mind me eating.  If I do have big meals I just nibble on them and I won't go so fast even though Im starving.  When I feel like im starving and I don't eat I start dry heaving and everything so that's why i carry my cheerios everywhere lol.  In the morning right when I wake up I pop some in my mouth and good for awhile till I eat again.    Congrats!!|`|SnyDa8Claa	Yes, smaller meals are better. If you need to eat (and with pregnant women, eating is a right now kind of thing), I recommend trail mix, raisins, cheese, a cup of yogurt.. anything with a bit of protein and carbs.. it helps curb the gnosh. And will help with the tummy upset.    Now this works with most people... you just need to figure out when eating is good for you|`|Dr2wwH3jaa	im 28 weeks and i had the same problem. i just ate alot of fruit and crackers with cheese my boyfriend makes me 6 small meals every day mostly of friut chick cheese and crackers. it may get boring but you will be happy your not throwing up.|`|0VUZacRTaa	I never had it quite that bad, but I did get that. I just ate frequently and in small portions. Just remember, your running out of room in there.|`|oaF2kaXAaa	I have felt that way, the first FOUR months! It was terrible. I felt like I was feeding the bottomless pit. I ended up having to take some vitamin B6... and yes the small meals helps... its just hard to measure "small". There were days when all I could eat was rice krispys cereal. Hang in there! Its all worth it in the end.|`|qgGwZbogaa	I had horrible morning noon and night sickness with 2 of my 4. I had to eat small meals and only when I was hungry. Don't force yourself to eat just because it is a certain meal time. Listen to your body and eat when you are hungry, small portions and things that appeal to you.|`|hWc65sEtaa	Try eating something small every 2 hours.  Just try to stay away from spicy or fried foods, that will make you feel worse.|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	Yep!  Exactly how I felt with both of my pregnancies.  What helped me was to graze all day.  I would always carry crackers and when I would start to feel it come on I would nibble on the crackers.  Try different crackers too that helps.  Mine passed once I hit the second trimester both times.  Hope you feel better soon!  Oh, ginger snaps help too.
KDVaGxbHaa	For event planning: Your Mom is right. No college is needed for this job. (Just because they offer formal education in it doesn't make it necessary - go work for an even planner for awhile and your good.)    For Physical Therapy: It depends on the country you live in. In the United States you need to either have a major in physical therapy or complete a certain number of credits on the undergraduate level in Physical therapy, and then enter a doctoral program in physical therapy. (Masters' degree's for Physical Therapists are no longer the standard- you must now earn a special doctorate in your field.)|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	There are programs/majors in something called Hospitality and Restaurant Management.  From these you'll learn pretty much what you need about food/catering, facility rental, even booking entertainment.  Another good choice would just be Business.  You may start off on your own and need these skills to work with your clients, do your accounting, etc.    A good way to get into event planning is to volunteer for non-profits.  They often hold things like Galas and large fundraising events and can always use people to help with invites, registration, etc.  These often have wealthy donors, who through lavish weddings for their kids.|`|kdZcHLETaa	You HAVE to have a physical threrapy degree to practice in some states. That said, if you want to do event planning, you should think about psychology just to be able to deal with people! Haha, best of luck|`|ddP3klT3aa	I would try physical therapy. The way the economy is, not many people will be hiring event planners. I am not sure there is a degree for that. Maybe business.|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	university of central florida has an event management major
xayYdIfHaa	My daughter was stillborn at 23w.  She was unplanned, but we were so excited for her, our first pregnancy.. we had even started the nursery. I lost her September 22, 2008 and I've never been through such hell in my life. Deep depression, constant crying, suicidal thoughts, etc.     I still seem to be on the roller coaster of emotions. One day I'm ok, and then the next (like today) I just want to cry and cry. I feel like I have a massive hole in my heart and nothing is ever going to fill that hole.     I see people every day who are terrible parents, and so many unwanted children. I just can't comprehend why it happened to us. We're young, healthy and the stillbirth was, according to the doctor, caused by a freak infection.     I blame myself, and go over in my head constantly if I could have done anything differently. I don't think I could have.    Some day's I'll blame God, and wonder why he's so spiteful. At the end of the day, I know I cant change what happened. I've just resigned myself to the fact that I probably won't have that baby in my arms any time soon, and that the nursery we started for our daughter will continue to sit there, half finished and collecting dust.    I wish you luck though, and I hope you heal emotionally faster than what I have been. Lots of hugs.|`|CcIwNRejaa	Yes, I found out I was pregnant on November 28th and we was so excited of course (this was our 1st pregnancy)! :) ...but then we found out on New Year's Eve that the baby had stopped growing and our first pregnancy would result in a miscarriage. I was an emotional train wreck at first, but the more I talked about it, the more I was reassured that everything happens for a reason..even if it's hard to see the reason sometimes. A good friend gave me an entire different view on our situation, because she told me that I was lucky b/c at least I now know that I am able to get pregnant. That little angel will always have a place in my heart and I just believe that I AM so lucky to have my own little guardian angel up there!!! :) My husband and I are going to try again soon! We are blessed! =)|`|uwGz5UFwaa	i was very upset! i had a miscarriage & the doctor couldn't get me in for a DNC until almost 2 weeks after the miscarriage! so that was the worst thing i had ever went through!|`|23572dac0aeb0ed10bc697a86e8e2dd5aa	Yes, I have...  I was only 3 weeks. I didn't know I was pregnant. I was so busy that I didn't even notice that I hadn't had my Time of the Month. I went to the Dentist on December 31st. When I got home, I attempted to self medicate and took a Hydrocodone (codeine.) I felt so horrible! I was so nauseous. All I could do was lay in bed for the rest of the day and all night. The next morning I had the worst period of my life. Cramping and even my vagina hurt. Heavy, Heavy bleeding! I usually have a light period for 3-days. I bled for 8 days and had major clotting on the 3rd day. I was so scared because I didn't know that I was pregnant. I'm almost 30 and I've never been pregnant! well I guess I can't say that anymore. It's been 29 days and now my face is breaking out... I never get acne. I'm hoping I don't go through depression. I've only told one person so far and this feels really good to write this down.    Thanks for asking this question.|`|scdOdaTKaa	I'm not positive I'm having one but I suspect.  I never had my AF in December I had odd spotting but no AF.  Now in January my AF came 3 days late adn it is the most painful thing I've ever felt, with HEAVY bleeding and lots of clots , sorry TMI.  I had odd cramping all through January, now this, so my doctor thinks I"m having an early miscarriage.  It's hard because we are trying to conceive, but I also knew it was common in young women trying for the first time.  My mother had 4 miscarriages, once grandma had 3 stillborns, and my other grandma had miscarriages. So They had all three talked to me and given me advice trying to prepair me.     I pray about it a lot and I know God will bless me with a healthy pregnancy when He is ready. Be strong and take your prenatal vitamins and just keep trying, it will happen.    Good luck and lots of baby dust!|`|j9ta5ulqaa	I have to admit my miscarriage was the worst pain emotionally ever. Mine was different..I have my tubes tied, so this was a true miracle. I was happily remarried and my husband has no children of his own. This was a true miracle. I lost our baby at 15 weeks. I think I lost my mind for about 6 months. I was so depressed and sad. I still feel sad. I feel empty, plus I find myself desperate for a baby..we are looking into tubal reversal but it is expensive..so my life sure changed in the loss of our baby.|`|eemmWU0Haa	Its the worst thing that can ever happen to a woman whether it be 4 weeks or 12-14 weeks pregnant, it still hurts no matter what even after you pass the blood and cramps you still think of it every day I know I do.    Ive had many miscarriages it hurts no matter what and the pain is always there emotionally and physically.      we are still trying and Im never going to give up hope cos my dream is to be a mother not matter what & I want alot of kids!|`|49f06b796d54e170c36a6cf4fc463182aa	I have had two miscarriages.  One with my first pregnancy.  I was only seventeen with that one.  I was twelve weeks along.  I bled really heavy and it hurt really bad like the worst period ever.  I was terrified, upset, and had lots of feelings quickly moving through my heart.  I went on the toilet because there was lots of pressure down there and I thought I had to have a bm.  Then out came this tiny little perfectly formed baby.  It was really red and in a sack like thing of jello consistancy.  I could see it was a baby though.  I flushed the toilet because I did not know what else to do.  Two years later I had my first daughter at nineteen.  Then a couple years later with my husband I got pregnant again.  I was eight weeks with this miscarriage so it was not so bad.  I bled really heavy and was in lots of pain.  All I passed this time were clots.  I mourned the first one more because I saw it was a baby.  Miscarriages are really hard.  Often women go through the whole mourning process like people do with death.  Over the years the pain faided as I had my children who are here now.  I only think of them.|`|uDdEq7ePaa	I had an early miscarriage last Thursday.    I had only just found out that I was pregnant, but I felt angry. It felt unfair, to be taken away from me just as I found out it was there, even though I understand that these things happen.    Physically it was more painful than a period. I cramped constantly for 24 hours, then on and off for a couple of days after that.
zLVZyfwUaa	Eat healthy and get plenty of fluids.  There is nothing much more you can do.  I started leaking colostrum at 35 weeks, nothing major.  The key is during the first few days after the baby is born to nurse them frequently on the colostrum.  It will help you stimulate your milk production more.  And about 2 to 3 days later your milk will come in hard!  Trust me your breasts will be so hard you will think they are made of concrete.  This can make it difficult for the baby to latch so pump or hand express a little first.|`|QY10Hmq7aa	You dont get your milk until 2 to 3 days after the baby is born. You have collostrum before you get the milk.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Your breastmilk comes in about two days after your baby is born. It's probably different for everyone. The removal of the placenta is what gets it started, so there's nothing you can do to boost supply before the baby is born; nor is it helpful to worry about it. There are things you can do to counteract low supply, and foods or medications that you can avoid to make sure it doesn't go down (lots of caffeine, decongestants, etc). Try not to worry - your body knows what to do!     http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/milkpr...|`|IVSqQQzlaa	Your milk will come in within 3 or 4 days after your baby is born.  Almost everyone can breastfeed so don't worry.  I would recommend you read as much as you can about breastfeeding before your baby is born so you are prepared as much as you can be.  Also, stock up on some nipple cream because you will no doubt need it for the first couple of weeks.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	when you start breast feeding you will have the colostrum first for the first few days, after that your milk will come in. Be sure to drink plenty of water while nursing, this will help with the milk production. eat healthy foods while nursing and stay away from fatty foods. Just remember what ever you eat, your baby will be eating too. So if he/she becomes really gassy, it may of been whatever you had eaten earlier in the day. I found this out, so pizza was not allowed after my first son was born. I had eaten some pizza for lunch and by dinner time, after I nursed him, he was so gassy, he put my dad to shame. The tomato sauce did it to him.|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	I suggest learning all you can about it ahead of time.  I was the same way with my son.  Taking classes & reading about it helped me to feel more ready when he arrived.  After he was born he began to nurse (those first few days it is not milk but, a nutrient rich liquid I can't remember the name of that gives your baby a great start in life) and then after 2 or 3 days my milk came in.      As long as you don't give up I am sure you will be fine.  There are things that can go wrong and make you want to quit, but if you know ahead of time that things can arise then you can be prepared for them and already know how to solve the problems.      It is such a natural and beautiful thing.  Try not to stress it.  Your baby and your body will know what to do when the time comes.  Good Luck!|`|avx7bLnKaa	your milk comes in 2-5 days after the birth before that is colostrum  read all you can on breastfeeding now  http://llli.org [click resources then answer pages]  http://kellymom.com  http://breastfeeding.com  http://mother-2-mother.com  http://askdrsears.com    the first week is a killer and the first 4-6 weeks will tire you out and are stressful but after that breastfeeding is worth it|`|JUzN4wCtaa	well breast milk comes way before the baby comes like almost the first or second month!!|`|3ay0KVVDaa	I have nuresed 3 babies and am pregnant with my 4rth.

That is what the baby needs even though it's just a few tbsps every 2 hours.

VygBNA0Waa	stop feeding him junk food so he doesn't carry on like that and don't spank him in the shop what works better is you count how many smacks he gets and tell him you are going to get x amount of smacks when you get to the car   don't take him shopping any more   no i wouldn't let him go and every time he starts crying about why he cant go tell him because the way you carried on at the shops its your own fault you want me to be nice to you but you were not nice to me at the shops thats why your not going|`|457db30f68586ffe5e0ebc94a4dba769aa	Of course not.  I also wouldn't have let him out of the stroller after the first incident.    And obviously the spanking doesn't work for him as a method of discipline, so perhaps taking away privileges will be something he responds to better.  I'm not an anti-spanker (though I don't spank my own kids), but you have to figure out a method of discipline that works on your particular child...clearly, spanking isn't it, or he wouldn't have had the 2nd incident in the mall.|`|hdmASWiSaa	I think your son needs to learn that all of his negative actions have consequences.  He may start screaming again, but stand firm!  Don't let him go to his friend's house and remind him that if he behaves like that again, he will get punished again.  He'll eventually learn that everything has a consequence.    Best of Luck!|`|UYYe3NfZaa	he is old enough to understand that bad behavior upsets you.  you should not let him go, tell him why.  make sure that he understands that if he had behaved he would be able to go, but since he didn't he is not going.  Make it crystal clear.  do not give in, if you do you will only make things worse.  he will know he can get away with anything with you.  i know its hard, but stand firm on that.|`|0rlGbOhqaa	I can empathize with you, not sympathize, but empathize. I'm in your boat and sometimes I feel like I'm sinking. I have 7 children so this parenting thing is old news to me....or so I thought. I have a 5 year old that is out of control and cries about everything. Can I have ice cream? No. Crying crying crying. Can I go outside? No. Cry cry cry. It's frustrating. I saw his behavior as different when he was very young. So, ask yourself if he was "different" somehow from your others. Have you talked to your doctor about it? I finally gave into my dislike of psychiatrists and took him in. Only to be told he is ODD (oppositional defiant disorder) and ADHD. So then the meds followed. All of which made the crying worse because they affected his central nervous system. They then put him on a blood pressure medication but that just ruined his quality of life even if it made our lives with him better. So we got a second opinion. He was then diagnosed with Aspergers. He was put back on adderal with 2 mood stabilizing drugs to control the central nervous system. Doesn't work. They put him on the Feingold diet and he got extremely worse. Got him on the waiting list at a very well known pediatric neurology center only to be told that they weren't ruling out Aspergers but that they didn't see it. They are neurologists that specialize in autism so they'd know best. So they are sending us to have extreme specialist (not just and everyday ENT or optometrist) check vision and hearing because they said that the slightest defect can set a child off. The are also doing chromosone DNA testing to actually look to see if there is a defect in any of his chromosones that are causing this. If it's something they can give us an answer to then maybe we can get the right treatments and behaviorists to work with us. Knowing if there is an underlying problem would answer my question if I should or shouldn't let him go to his friends house. If it's just a behavioral issue, then absolutely not, but if there is something wrong that is making his brain process information wrong then I would have to know exactly what is right or wrong as far as making my disciplinary decisions. I have an Asperger's son. He's 13. High functioning. Goes to a Catholic school with the rest but he was always the "odd duck out". He'd do things that even I'd ask, "Why are you doing that? Stop it! Are you autistic?" Imagine now how horrid I felt after weeks and weeks of testing at a neurobehavioral center to hear the team say, "He has Aspergers." He was in the 4th grade when we found out. Don't end up suffering from the guilt that I do because I made stupid decisions in disciplining my Aspergers son because I was ignorant as to his "problem". Looks like I was the one with the problem. I'm not saying to put your child on drugs, I'm saying go down every avenue because a doctor might find something that is attacking your child's central nervous system and causing the problem, or maybe he was exposed to lead, or whatever. Just find out before you drive yourself crazy trying to find a solution to the behavior problems or before you ruin your relationship with needless spankings....or worse yet....spank him in a mall or bathroom where a social worker is washing their hands. A social worker could snatch your family up so quick. They are more abusive than any parent out there who spanks their child.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I dont understand your discipline.  You use the harshest forms at the drop of a hat at the mall - when you are likely frustrated.  Then when things are calmed down, you cave on effective punishments.    I would have caught him, picked him up, gathered everyone and left the mall.  Then talked about the consequences and enforced them at home.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	Absolutely NO.  Children that are this disrespectful and disobedient in public don't need to go off to friends and things they want to do when they can't behave at home for you.    At his age he is old enough to understand that if told he can't go because his behavior towards you in the mall was horrible, disrespectful and wrong and that he's going to miss out on some things he wants to do for awhile until he can learn to behave more appropriately.|`|awXx7N2baa	i wouldnt because .. he need to no not to do that.

Next time you're in public I wouldn't even let him let go of your hand until you have it drilled into his head that that behavior is NOT acceptable|`|HyknHVV5aa	NO!!!!! NO NO NO NO!!!!! No way! He will think he can act like a monster and it's ok because there will be no consequences. You should ground him, take way all his privileges, and a definite no to going to his friends. Tell him if he was better behaved in the mall he wouldn't be grounded and be able to go to his friends, but since he wasn't tell him to enjoy his room.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Tell him no because of how he behaved the day before. Tell him, "all of your actions have consequences." Stand firm, letting him go will be enabling the behavior.|`|NxNrZksXaa	no i would not let him go because his behavior at the mall was unacceptable. and instead of him only doing it once, he did it twice.|`|LqhMdB5Kaa	tell that brat he needs to start thinking about other people and teach him some lessons

The ones where you can't get anything done! It is slippery but as someone said use a washcloth to help keep your grip. He loves it. He likes his baths more though so we do those every chance we get. :)|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I know lots of moms that do it.    We've done it, it doesn't work for us.    And to the first answer, unless you heat sterilize the tub, never kiss the baby, touch the baby, or let the baby on the floor you share germs.  Christ people.|`|ddP3klT3aa	No. I wouldn't. You will just share germs with him. He needs his own bath in his own bathtub.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	babies are very slippery when they get wet...and besides a bath is suppose to be relaxing for your baby not a matter of getting it done fast..|`|a14b96b25b5bf9293d533f13874f2a6aaa	No. It would be too easy to slip and fall or to lose your grip on a slippery baby and drop her. Best to let your baby have her own bath in her own little bathtub. It makes them feel safe and secure (and is a lot safer) for them to have their own tub while so little.|`|XHFj2IVhaa	It's very safe and effective, too. Ignore the inexperienced here whom are afraid to be overly practical.    I often bathed with both my children, as i found it easier on both of us - me, for straining reasons, and them, cause they liked the proximity and were less afraid...|`|LbkLg4RFaa	It's fine.  Have a good grip on your baby.  Have everything ready.  Just be sure to check the water temperature before hopping in.  Also if you are worried about yourself slipping while holding her you can buy non slip rubber bath mats for the bottom of the shower.      My niece had showers with my SIL or Brother since about 2 - 3 weeks old and then the other would be ready to dry her.  She loved it.|`|rymbwVKXaa	How old is the baby? I have done it with all my kids. I never had any problems, I wouldn't recommend it until they can hold there head up or sit up on there own. I always sat them in the bath tub with toys. They also make child seats for this.|`|ctNNzYW6aa	If it's just you and the baby, the answer is NO NO and NO!  Since you have help, then I reluctantly say maybe, but only if your boyfriend is standing fully dressed outside of the shower holding a dry towel..  I tried when my daughter was about 5 months old and ended up showering sitting down because nobody told me how dang slippery babies are!!|`|YTOrDW3haa	yes it is safe and no you dont transfer germs! haha! but it is a great bonding experience. i have a 5 month old and she loves it! just makes suren you have a firm grip and i found that if you have a washcloth (one of yours, not the babies) in one of the hands that you are holding him/her with then it is easier to keep hold. but definately make sure that nobody suddenly flushes the toilet!|`|vzDmaWqaaa	It may be faster but it is alot more dangerous.  you are trying to hold, bathe, watch, balance, and everything else while a slippery baby grabs at everything and wiggles.  Your chances of injury are much higher than if you just watch him play in the tub.  Also tub time is good for babies.  It helps them get used to the water for confortable learning to swim later in life.  It is a new fun experience for them.  my little girl lives for bath time.
MSb3gi3Caa	i get paid around $40 - 50 depending how long|`|UspK4SQBaa	That would depend on the babysitter's experience and training, and what would be involved for the night.  Usually, the babysitter sets the rate, but if he doesn't, ask around with other parents to find out what they pay.  Depending on where you live, 8-10 dollars an hour is usually good, so for an eight to twelve hour job, you could expect to pay around 100 dollars, but some sitters may discount that by a quarter or half.  Keep in mind that this is more than one child, and the 3 year-old will be more of a handful.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	I would probably charge the family 50-75 dollars. How many hours is it exactly and what will the babysitter have to do? I'm a babysitter and get $7 an hour while watching two kids in the evening. If I had to watch them overnight it wouldn't be much of a big deal because everyone would be sleeping. I wouldn't charge a crazy amount to just go and sleep at their house, just to have someone there.     Will the babysitter have to put them to bed and wake them up in the morning or are they just going to come to your house and chill?|`|DekGIOImaa	My daughter gets $10.00 an hour. If it's overnight, I would say more like $12-$15/hour.|`|V4nP6jAMaa	well if you want them to come back..  and since its an over nighter  id give them between 20 or 30$  depending on how good they baby sat.  Good Luck : )|`|YIiFWlXsaa	Since it is overnight, and it probably is a hassle for the babysitter $10 per hour.  Also, because of the age of the kids it will be a hard job.|`|HyknHVV5aa	Depends on the age and qualifications of the sitter:    Ages 14 - 18 with no CPR C/First Aid: $6 an hour   Ages 14 - 18 with CPR C/ First Aid: $8 an hour  Over 18 with no CPR C/First Aid: $7 an hour  Over 18 with CPR C/First Aid: $9 an hour|`|vbwnLB8Gaa	$7/ an hour.|`|0oOquvruaa	prolly like 50-75|`|4gkepThIaa	maybe $15 a day|`|E2UXN7J1aa	For overnight I would say no more than 6 dollars an hour for both children. 3 an hour for each child isn't that bad at all in my area. Now if you were talking during the day than I would probably say 5 for each.|`|ddP3klT3aa	You will probably be paying at least $15 an hour.|`|RQc8fbjbaa	50.00|`|10YksH8caa	60 dollars|`|r6Jz4IEuaa	25-30 dollars per hour.    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|o503YPrqaa	Over night? well either 8-10 hours.. 15-20$ per hour.. which would be 120-200$ sounds good to me.    Depends on state. I live in California I get paid 10$ an hour at my retail job. 8.50 is minimum wage in CA.. so the 7$p/h answer is not nearly enough for a good standard of over night child care.|`|PJelxn5Xaa	It really depends on your income. I am a nanny, and any overtime I do I get $20 an hour but my boss is also a brain surgeon. In this economy we can't all afford to hand out money like nothing. I would say 150-250 especially since 3 year olds can be difficult to get to sleep, and they usually wake in the night. Be considerate of your sitter because im sure she will be in for a night.|`|aRcUmCKYaa	Add the two ages together, subtract 2 from that and pay that amount of money to the babysitter for every hour she/he babysits|`|lcmw4mWlaa	$10 an hour is good for the baby sitter but not for you.  $ 7 cash is like $ 8.25 before taxes so that would be the min|`|pStUmM52aa	7$ a hour|`|87KMkWLuaa	15-20|`|r9gBoBLCaa	it depends what you mean by overnight, is she coming over late leaving early? coming over in the morning, sleeping over, staying until late the next night?|`|zWgqQpE3aa	200$ for a night?! seriously? That's kinda ridiculous considering the kids will be sleeping the majority of the time. 3 year olds, and def  7 year olds, should be just fine sleeping through the night. I'd go with about $30, since all they will prolly end up doing is sleeping on your couch.
jzdDF3Ljaa	It wouldnt suck so bad if you went to a normal school :(  College might be better :)|`|kdZcHLETaa	Here's the thing, your teenage years are supposed to be a waste. Honestly, I know it sounds cliche but if your reach your peak at 17, that's pretty sad. High school, for most people who turn out to matter at all, is where you start to discover yourself.  That said, I don't think most people, boys especially, start to reach any sort of maturity until they have AT LEAST hit their college years, if not their mid- twenties.       Personaly speaking, I was in some of the same situations you find yourself; I didn't really have any guy friends, I was kind of a geek and a bookworm, I didn't smoke or drink and I NEVER went to parties.  And them I went to college, I grew up and now I have lots of friends, I get invited to lots of parties and I drink socially but I'm not an alcoholic.       I see a lot of the girls that were really "cool" in high school and they have babies at 22, have dropped out of school, gotten fat or do nothing but drink their money away.      You are probably doing better for yourself in the long run by NOT being the typical popular high school ****** :-)|`|qiVE00ecaa	Sucks for you, be more outgoing in college and make those the years where you say "those were good times".  You will start fresh, so just talk to more people and go to a fun school that has abroad programs and such.  Maybe you should start following a college sport.|`|2jBtScVcaa	umm i didn't actually read that because it was very long but i seen the word weed so i would have to guess yes you did waste your teen age years...|`|LNnRSLdtaa	just ask your closest friend if theres anything happening this weekend  im in the same situation (the not going out alot part, i do have guy friends)  after going out with your friends a few times youl know people and when your drunk youl just talk to randomers and then youl know even more people|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	I'd say you haven't wasted anything; quite the opposite. I think most people would kill for the educational/socioeconomic background you have.     Be thankful that you are alive, have a great education, have a good circle of friends, and a great foundation for college and future success.    Your life is just beginning. Good luck!|`|e1cf5a783f548627eba8be4d2c8409caaa	Um....     Well, in my opinion, since I'm sort of the same way (I'm not into the whole SDR&R thing), I don't think you are.  I still do everything normal kids do; I still have fun, but I manage to stay clean.    If you're so miserable, then get out.  Get some different friends who make you feel like you belong.       Don't try drink and drugs at a party, if you plan on ever trying.  You don't know how you're going to react to any of it, and how wonderful would that be to have a horrible reaction at a party in front of everyone. Lol.    I think college should be something you should look forward to.  College is co-ed and you will meet girls, who will invite you to parties where you will meet people.      You sound smart.  I honestly don't know why you want to dumb yourself down.      For a lot of people, the "good times" were their college years.|`|CAOisulkaa	yep, find a black girl and get urself back together.|`|AOgK773Eaa	You gotta get out dog|`|595BQdO8aa	The only thing u should live for is for God! He loves u more than anyone! except Jesus as your savior and give everything to God and then ull actually have a meaning in life and something to live for!  its never too late!|`|p9mB8Z2Kaa	K    Well the thing about not dating we whatever isn't all that great    As for the weed and smoking and drinking and stuff, why do you think you are wasting your teenage years by not doing that. Why do you want to try that????? That so nasty. You still have a lit of life to live dude.     And just for the record I would never date a guy that did drugs or something. There's just no way. And I doubt that most girls would either. Doing drugs is the wasteful things you do. If you had ever tried drugs, you'd be easing the rest of your life.    You still have a life. You seem to have a good education and with that you will have a good life and make good money. But by doing weed or something you'll just screw up your future and live a short life.|`|D8gFfDwuaa	You haven't wasted your life if you enjoyed it.    I admire u 4 not drinking and smoking and would lose all of my admiration towards u if u decided 2 try it. I haven't smoked nor drank.     2 b honest with u, I would have no clue where 2 buy weed.    Also, I would ask if u could go 2 one of the parties. go 2 one, if u don't like it don't go 2 another one. Plus, i would ask Ur parent/guardian if u can go to just a regular public school.    And go hang out w/ your "friends" instead of being a loner.    Good Luck!|`|3AZNSUS6aa	It depends on  how you look at it. Some would  say you've wasted it, others would die to  have what you have and I'm sure  some of those people will look back  and also think they wasted it too on drugs and alcohol.  If you really think there's something you can take away from drugs and alcohol, and it won't take away from YOU, then I suppose go ahead, I'm  not going to stop  you.   However, I personally think you are really mature for not wasting your life on that crap. Either way, do  what you want.  And the whole girlfriend thing, well, I know a lot of  people 17+ who've never had a girlfriend. Doesn't mean your a loser. If you really want girl friends, then  just talk to  them. I know it's a lot easier  said than done, but we're not going to hurt you lol.. Try to  talk to your friends girl friends. But anyway, you really shouldn't be jealous of your friends "hookups" because when you get older and find a girl you really want to  be with, she will respect you for not being a man-wh*re.     And the whole "these are the best years of your life" is a complete lie. Whether your a stoner or  a straight A student. It's a tough time, and not easy for anyone. But it's really YOUR choice on  how you perceive it. Truth be told, your going to spend a lot of your life alone, and not  just you, everyone is. Might as well enjoy your own company and love the person  you will be with most.     Well, that's all  I have to say. Good luck|`|PhkLLwVbaa	I understand that by not doing these things you feel like you have missed out i'm 19 I smoked pot once I was in junior high nothing great nothing special I would lie about it because I dont know you. I had my first drink my junior year and the only place I drank was at my best friend jessica's and it would just be her, her mom, and maybe two other people never been to a wild and crazy party I pretty much spent my high school years like you just hangin out with friends and I havent gone through college yet but I dont feel like I missed out on anything. Who says you have to do those things to have experienced life look at it this way by you not drinking you havent made a bad judgment call like drinking and driving or having sex with some girl you didnt even know. I do think you should try to meet a girl maybe try to have a friend of yours gf hook you up with a friend of hers. Drinking does not make anything better most people do it because they like the taste and because they want to fit in and the people that smoke pot all the time do it because there use to it after doing it that once I never did it again because I saw no reason it did nothing for me. All that should matter to you in life is reaching your goals, finding someone to care about and making a great life for yourself not omg i'm not doing what everyone else is doing do you know how many of those people have had to wake up and and say to themselves omg what have I done or who have I done. You have to look at the positive its not all that people make it out to be.|`|H90uflbFaa	damnn, just get out off highschool and go onto colllege. and even if you did waste your "teenage years" theres nothing you can do about it.|`|4KRSUhXLaa	Yeah..... don't even try weed.|`|6lSbmXunaa	Awww no you seriously haven't.  Please please don't smoke weed.  The people that smoke weed are the ones that have wasted their teenage years.  My cousin (who I used to be very close to) picked up weed this past year and that's all he does is smoke it.  I mean, the boy used to have hobbies, play guitar and football, and have girlfriends.  And now what does he have? A bowl and some weed.  That sounds like so much fun, doesn't it?  He can't even laugh without wheezing and he looks like a mess.  Bottom line- don't smoke weed.    High school relationships rarely last, so you haven't missed out on anything- just heartbreak and tears.  Don't get yourself down because you don't have a girlfriend. Seriously, relationships are fun for like the first week and then they just take extra work.|`|VygBNA0Waa	you talk to girls the same way you talk to boys you just dont fart or burb in the faces|`|NoLt3X5faa	Well theres nothing you can do about your past. if you could go back in time that would be great but you cant. so just stop dreading on the past and next weekend push yourself to go to a party and meet some girls. again dont dread on the past, it wont get you anywhere|`|lcmw4mWlaa	Sometimes you have to experience sadness to appreciate the goodtimes|`|wb8WwWMNaa	I know exactly what you're going through.  I was in the same position except I'm a female.  I personally can't say it was a waste, life is what you make of it, and you shouldn't live it based on your "friends" standards but your own.|`|AA11140814	Tell your parents a cleaner version of what you just told the world here. And do everything short of curse them for ruining your life. they will think about it and apologize for being such assholes.  High school (to me) is the most important part of your life socially. Because of your social setbacks, you will have a late start in life. I suggest you grow some balls get a job and move out of your parents house ASAP. Do what you want to do. Live your own life and make mistakes so you can learn from them.|`|Rmx39jjxaa	I never drank or did any drugs during my teenage years. I didn't even date. I worked on my education where I could take care of myself in the future. I felt that I could worry about dating then. As for dope and booze, what a waste of time! There is so much more productive things a person can do.    You didn't waste your teenage years because you didn't do the illegal things your friends did. Your friends wasted their years by doing those stupid things.    And don't worry about the fact that you haven't dated yet. Another reason I didn't is because there's so much drama with teenage/high school relationships.    Just worry about making something of yourself.    FURTHER NOTE:  I'm sure you know what doing weed and drinking alcohol can/will do to you. So I'm sure you can understand why there are people that are telling you not to do either one. You may notice, however, that all of those people are getting voted down (me included). Think about that. That means there are probably a vast majority of people on this site that does one, the other, or both. If you read very many people's questions and/or answers, you might see what the consequences of doing either one is, since some people's questions and answers are just ridiculous, don't make any sense, or are just plain disgusting. (In other words, it kills brain cells that are used for logical, intelligent, and sensible thinking.) Food for thought.|`|ldAJ3Et8aa	Don't listen to Amber D she's an ignorant *****. I'm a junior and I have hardly any friends at the high school I go to because it's private and they're all very elitist and cliquey and @ssholes. I've smoked before but only with my brother and his friends and one time that I had a party at my dad's house and it was a cast party for a play so of course people wanted a place to smoke and drink. I drink pretty rarely but when I go visit my brother and go to a party or something. I've never had a girlfriend partially because I also go to an all guys school but also because I'm kinda ugly and not suitable for being a boyfriend. Smoking weed is something you should only do if you want to, and not because it's inherently cool or any dumb **** like that but because it makes you happy. Ive been through a lot of hard **** in my life and weed helps me relax and be happy through all of it. I unfortunately cannot help you with friends or girlfriends because of what I said though. But smoking and drinking will not necessarily make you popular and liked because I do both and people know and still don't invite me to hang out or anything. All I can say is pick a college where people are nice and accepting, and usually have a public-school background because others don't and smoke and drink if you want to, but its your choice man, good luck.|`|6pEDLnrzaa	no you haven't wasted it, they did. don't smoke weed my sister got in trouble for that, she didn't go to jail but is on probation. and just try and meet a girl somewhere just because other people are doing stupid *** **** doesn't mean you have to, wait until you get to collage|`|6W6B26sgaa	I'm a sophomore in college and I almost had the exact same situation as you other than the fact that I did smoke some weed (not a lot though, probably three times at most) and it was a co-ed school, but it was private and very boring. I wasn't part of the drinking/smoking up crowd either. Sometimes I worry that I wasted my high school career but then I think about it this way: Yes, some people say it's supposed to be the best time of your life but I find that much more depressing than "wasting your teenage years"...I would MUCH rather have "the best time of my life" in college or afterwards...    Now, I decided on attending a public university that was known as a party school, but I still find myself not going out and partying all the time. The fact that I was in such a tight private school has given me good study habits...I still party every now and then, but it's made me more thankful for my crappy high school because now college is twenty times better.    I think you're down on yourself because you're down on the routine your high school has put you through through four years. You might think your college will be a "no drinking" college, but you might be surprised. Don't try to predict your college experience because you'll be walking in with a worrisome attitude! It'll be a lot better than you think, I promise you that much.    I was in one relationship in high school, it was NOT worth it. I tried everything to fit in, it wasn't worth it. You'll find yourself in college, especially because you'll hopefully be out of your obviously stuffy high school.    And don't feel down about prom...I went to prom three times, once as a sophomore (we stayed for an hour and I asked my mom to come pick me up because it was so lame...so was my date that invited me...), once as a junior (stayed for thirty minutes), once as a senior (stayed for thirty minutes). Prom is overrated. ;-)    You'll have a better time soon, I promise, you'll be thrilled by the new experience of college and luckily you'll be stunned by the freedom and all of the new people to meet...Boys AND girls to meet.    Good luck, don't feel down! I wrote way too much, sorry for babbling.|`|E1d9MVKWaa	I'm pretty sure there's drinking at just about every college. You definitely do not need alcohol and/or weed to have fun though.   The first step you might need to take is to put yourself into a situation where you'll be hanging out with people around your age. I mean the thought of the awkwardness might be terrifying at first but you'll soon learn how to be functional in a social setting. Chance are, all you need is practice.   You should really go to these events your talking about as well. You could get to know people you've never thought about before. You could meet girls. You could even have more fun then you thought possible. Don't rely on other people though. It's your job to make your life interesting and fun.    College is your chance to almost completely start over. You can be whoever you want. If what you want is to be more socially involved, then DO IT! Join clubs and other groups that will improve your chance of meeting people. Freshman in college are all looking to make friends for the next 4, or more, years of their life. You couldn't ask for a better opportunity.    Please remember it's not too late to change.|`|WL1cX9rTaa	I have not heard of a college with no drinking, so once you get there you will problably do everything you said you didnt do above. its a good thing you havent smoked weed. its not cool and its a waste of money and time. im also in 12 grade im actually a father to my almost 8 month old daughter. before my girl got pregnant i was drinking and smoking and it was all good. but now i see my friends still doing it. none of my homies still go to school and there life is based on selling and smoking weed. i guess its cool in moderation as long as its not jeperdizing your job relationship or school.|`|bTMdpMW9aa	Yeah you kinda did but just make your life exciting during college years. Go live a little but it'll be harder since it's college and there's more people around so it'll be harder to make friends.|`|ba450548ec13ce7a3711c94421c92d4aaa	You're worrying too much. If you're writing from the US then don't worry about the drinking, you're not "supposed to" until you're 21 anyway. No drinking at college? Um, no. Even if you go to a quite college, like I did, people will still go out. In fact, one year when I was doing my undergrad, 4 freshmen ended up in the hospital with alcohol poisoning. One student, separate from the 4, actually died of alcohol poisoning, and this was at a small school in Ohio.     If getting drunk and high is really what you want then really there's no stopping you, you sound bright enough to be creative. The thing is, you also sound down because you don't have a girlfriend and somehow you think partying and girls go hand in hand. You're actually wrong. Girls don't like drunk drug addicts, unless they themselves are drug addicts. I speak from experience, I've dumped so many guys over the drink/drug crap. I don't drink, unless it's a few cocktail when out, and I've never tried a drug and I'm 29. I think I deserve someone who isn't in a drug induced haze all day or doesn't stress me out when we go out because I'm afraid he'll OD on Ice or whatever.    I say, don't stress. I know you've heard this a million times and you don't care, but you're only 17, give yourself a chance to have a life, you're barely an adult. You don't want to sit around for the rest of your life thinking about how great your teen years were. How about your 20's? Or your 30's when you finally have your own (nice) place and enough money of your own to throw around? There are so many drunk/drug guys out there that honestly, women really have to look for the good ones so you're lucky, man! As far as prom goes, just ask someone, like family friend or whatever, she'll be glad to go.|`|K2o7xcstaa	Yeah.. I'm sorry I think you have. That kind of sucks for you. I'm sorry I'm only 14 and I've already smoked pot and drank before. And my town is pretty as most people might call "conservative." It's not to late though, you should go to prom. It's not to late to turn the last bit of time of your teenages years around good luck!!!! Don't get out of hand though.|`|AA11559211	dude you have an essay complex   teen years suck for all  twenties arent great ether  hope for your thirties|`|gPvhZDI7aa	awww no, u should get out more tho with the girl thing....so u can get a wife or girlfreid of wahtever. im 15 and never kissed a guy and im perfectly hot haha and iv never smoked cuz it kills brain cells. i have been offered tho. just be like, man im so bored and this weeked i have nothing to do so ill be bored AGAIN. then be like "what are u guys doing?" and they will tell u then be like "that sounds fun" someone will probablly offer u|`|523884241d6f93ac642819a1b6d3f6e9aa	i was just like you in highschool. I was a very shy guy and didn't make any friends .i only had acquantences. You know, talk to the person in class, outside class and didn't exchange phone numbers with people. If i ever called anyone it had to do with something that related to homework or something. i didn't experience anything in highschool, i didn't go to parties, i didn't have a girlfriend, i barely knew any girls other than acquantences.     For me college was different. Because one acquantence that i knew in highschool went to the same college as i did and we became good freinds in college. Real friends. He was popular in highschool and he knows a lot of people in college so i met people through him, i went to fraternity parties, i even went to a sex party (that was crazy). I don't know what it's going to be like for you but just make sure you don't make the same mistakes you did in highschool with college. Go out and enjoy college. There's more to college than good grades. Join a club, that's what i did, i met people and made good friends through college extra curriculums. It also helped me further my interest in my career and helped me meet a lot of important people with connections that helped me settle.|`|sXj0ALXXaa	No, you have not wasted your teenage years. Many people, including myself, have gone through high school and now the beginning of college without every drinking, smoking, or anything like that. I've been around some boys in my high school, but I've never dated, either. And although I'd like to find "the one" to be with, I'm okay with not knowing whoever that is at this exact moment. Because if I rush into a relationship "to experiment," I'm cheapening whatever I could have later when I truly think that I've found that someone.    Teen years are not supposed to be all about partying. Neither are college years. They never were until very recently in the past century or so. People were kids, then they grew up to be adults. There was no in between, and it appears most of them got along just fine.    Just do your best to find some good friends. Friends  you feel comfortable around. Friends who don't make you feel like you've wasted your life by not doing what they do. There are so many people in this world.     Go to your college, have a good time that you are comfortable with, and that way, when you finally do find a girl, it will be someone you can actually be true with, and not a fake.|`|qPaQNoC8aa	Hell yeah you have... You shoukd go out, and about the Senior week you should go you are going to have fun is you do... Stop wasting you high school experience, if you have one|`|0JBXD87uaa	It's not a waste if you learned anything from it. So what if you didn't get into most of the stupid crap teens do, that's a good thing. If you had screwed up and gotten a police record, you could have messed up your entire future. School should be about learning and making friends, not drinking, smoking, and sex. When you get to college there will be tons of people doing the same things. If you don't actually learn and act like a party whore, you will likely flunk out. The teachers don't have to teach you in college, they get paid weather you go or not.|`|u2kJE70Paa	So, you're feeling left out it seems. Let me be the one to save your life/mind. If you try weed or get involved in it in any way, you're hurting yourself. Sure, everyone else is doing it, but that shows how pathetic and week you are to giving into things, and people will see this, trying to take advantage of you. You should put yourself forward in the way that you are more social with females,and not forward to peer pressures. Look up what weed can do to you. Make you feel good? maybe..but in the end..look what you're doing to yourself and how week of a person you have become.Socialize with girls and come out of your shell. You have time, but make fun in it.|`|S6LXYLjYaa	i would personally not get into the weed.   That ruins you and you will most likely regret it.   Though having a few drinks everyonce in a while won't kill you.   In thirty years will you even stay friends with your high school buddies anyways. I know what you mean by the "good times" but is getting into weed and alcohol just to fit in really having a good time. My boyfriend was into that his sophomore year. And when we talk about looking back at our times through high school he always tells me that he is happy i didn't get into the weed. And he is very proud that i stayed strong because if he could've gone back he wouldn't have started with the weed.... try to get to know girls. when your buddies have their girls around, ask them if they have any cute friends.     All in all,   Don't do weed. (girls may like that you don't smoke it)  Have fun with your friends at parties even if you don't get totally wasted. start with a few drinks.   Ask your friends on advice about the girls and see if their "girls" have any single friends.   I'm 18 an year old girl who can speak up for a lot of girls and say "get involved, but don't change yourself to pick up a girl that may only last for a couple weeks, or months. You have to be YOU for the rest of your life"|`|gbX2aTu0aa	I think college will your "those were good times," in high school your not a kid and your not an adult. I think it's kinda good that you didn't because you have nothing to regret! Now start over in college and be who you want to be! Good luck! =]|`|1nMeOUnbaa	Don't try weed, no matter what you hear it's bad for you and it won't help the situation. I don't think you have wasted your life. I'm almost 17 and I've never had a boyfriend and pretty much all of my friends have...so your not the only one. That probaly doesn't help much but things will get better, especially in college.|`|dLLyi07Xaa	I'm a senior in high school also, But I'm a girl. I'm in the same boat as you and sometimes i wonder if i have wasted my time but you haven't! DO NOT change who you are! It'a good thing you haven't smoked or drank. The people who are doing so are the ones who live for high school and are burnouts and nothing right after. Trust me, it will pay off in the end!

AA10280194	Baby's eye color usually sets in about 6 - 10 months but can sometimes take up to a year.  I've put a link below for an eye color calculator.  It's fun!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My son's eyes are still a bit of a mystery color at 7 months, though we think they are going to be light brown.  They were dark blue at birth, turned almost black, then gray, then greeny brown, and then the color they are now.  So it could be a while.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	With my son it took a couple of weeks. They started out black and then turned blue. My nephew however is almost 7 yrs old and his are just now turning green.|`|XBTzRVuBaa	The Docs usually say by a year. But my daughters still seem to be changing and she is 14 months. Mine didn't settle on brown until I believe I was 3 or so.|`|gyoylefvaa	After 6 months,|`|lFxlYx9zaa	grey means that she will have hasel eyes, and they change color all the time.|`|u0qU6DzZaa	You honestly will not know until the child is around 2. They change even after that, but I would say by 18months to 2 years.     May sound weird to you now, but you shall see...LOL.
4y1R8DoWaa	Try a new hobby, go on a trip, find some good books to read, take a class, or try a new job before you have any more children.  If you start again now, you will have the chance of having a child with a disability and you won't be free until you are almost 60 years old.  Think about it...... do you want to have a teenager when you're in your fifties??|`|qgGwZbogaa	Only you can answer that question for yourself. You might be experiencing some empty nest syndrome. Spend sometime with the babies at the nursery at your church (if you attend one) or get yourself a puppy something that still needs your love and affection and willingly returns it without too much dependence like another child would bring.     Good Luck to you :)|`|bT4npA7Jaa	My mother didn't have my little sister until she was 35 or 36, so you are definately not too old. And I think it would be a great time to have another baby. That is, if it won't affect your life and job and relationships you already have. I think it's really cute when you see a baby in the arms of their teenage brother or sister. I'm 15, and my mother is 44, and she had a miscarriage last summer and me and my older sister (who already has a baby) and my little sister were so happy, and I think it would have been really fun for us. And on the plus side, you'd never need to call a stranger to babysit. (:|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Y exactly would u NEED another one?  Is it just that u want another one because u are lonely...maybe purchase a dog or pick up a hobby...a baby is not the substitute for loneliness.|`|Pdex43zgaa	Yes. I'd say have another one. Or, at least have fun trying.|`|0VUZacRTaa	no one can answer that for you. That is completely up to you and your partner. Your old enough and if you have other kids obviously financially stable enough.|`|CVA86LY6aa	I've heard of this happening b4. Pre empty nest syndrome. You also have to remember, the older a woman is when she gets pregnant and delivers a baby, the more complications can occur. Ultimately the choice is yours & your husband. Good Luck
OkR3hrzZaa	I wouldn't give it to him/her. They want you to stay away from things that are a common allergy. Peanuts and shell fish and such. I wouldn't do it. They are still a baby and cant properly digest food like that. Not to mention I doubt he or she will even like it. I would just hold off and give him or her some eggs or some mashed potatoes or some noodles. Its all in time that you will be able to explore new foods with your child. You have quite a while to do so. Enjoy them being a baby while you can!|`|c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	I wouldn't feed it to my child. Sushi grade fish is SUPPOSED to meet certain standards of freshness, but in reality it is sortof "eat at your own risk" I wouldn't feed my child any undercooked meat whether it be fish, pork, beef, or chicken. That being said, many people confuse california rolls with real sushi. California rolls are the rice and cooked fish things that are wrapped in seaweed paper. I would think those would be perfectly fine. Real sushi is pieces of raw fish though, and I wouldn't advise it.|`|1pNt9892aa	While it is advisable to avoid raw-fish sushi, you can feed your toddler many others of the various forms of sushi. Here is one parent's adventures of preparing sushi with their toddler: http://foodietots.com/2008/10/24/cooking... I would start your child with simple sushi and work from there. Try sushi made from veggies, such as the avacado sushi the parent in the link tries. There are also many types of sushi made from cooked fish. If at all possible, try to avoid shellfish until your child is a bit older, I would recommend age three. I personally have shellfish allergies and as such, my son has a higher probability to be allergic to shell fish as well. So we will also be holding off on shell-fish based sushi. Here are some more ideas for sushi for toddlers, however, like I said before, I would cut out shellfish and cook other forms of fish: http://food-4tots.blogspot.com/2008/11/s... Some americans also make chicken sushi which can be interesting, and maybe easier on a 16 month old's palate. My son loves cooked salmon and loves cooked salmon sushi. Try some things out, your toddler will let you know what he or she likes.    Edit: Fox_Maple - Actually, sushi technically refers to the rice. Sashimi is the word for raw fish that is consumed alone! Many people outside of Japan confuse these two because the word "sashimi" is not widely known while many people know the word "sushi."|`|zH80yyDQaa	I wouldn't advise it.|`|8WOzftFuaa	probably not|`|x2YuF1pxaa	No.  If the sushi is contaminated he/she would get sick.|`|7hfXMvNpaa	it depends there are some sushi rolls that have cooked fish and then there are some that have raw meat i wouldn't give the child the ones that have raw meat but i don't think that the ones with cooked meat would be bad.|`|jsef2pnMaa	Of course they can.  Its very healthy, and easy to eat.  If they like it, let them eat it.  I think you should give him chicken or tuna or veg ones though, not raw fish, which is what I think many people are assuming you are talking about.  Its a lot better than cheeseburgers and fries anyway.  If only kids ate sushi instead of fast food these days!|`|0qP8gLpyaa	NO!      First off, all food that is given to infants, toddlers and young children needs to be completely and thoroughly cooked. Sushi is eaten raw. It could make them seriously ill.|`|DD5CMWfkaa	I wouldn't feed sushi to a 16 month old. Seems slightly dangerous.|`|NxNrZksXaa	i don't think a 16 month old should eat sushi. if it were me i wouldn't let him/her eat it.
kVBDpAMTaa	I haven't tried this myself but I read up about it and found some information for you since I saw you had no answers. =)    Hoku - This point can be found on the top of your hand in the webbing between your thumb and index finger. Press on an angle underneath the bone that connects with the index finger. To stimulate contractions, rub the point. This point can be used for pain relief with steady pressure during contractions.    Spleen 6 - On the inside of the ankle, trace up four of mother's finger widths above the ankle bone. Rub for about 1 minute.    Bladder 32 - This point is halfway between the dimple in the buttocks and the spine. You can find it by tracing up one of the mother's finger width's above the top of the buttocks crease. You should feel a small depression where the point lies.    Tips on Finding Pressure Points    Pressure points are naturally sensitive and feel to the mother like you are touching a bruise. Try the spot several times with varying pressure to find it. If your labor partner or doula is using the points, the mother can provide feedback when they have reached the right place since it will be more sensitive. If it is especially painful, ease up a bit on the pressure.    Adjoining Valley (LI4)    This point affects the large intestine, which surrounds a portion of your uterus. It is one of the best points for labor inducement. Located in the webbing between your thumb and your forefinger, you will absolutely know when youve found the spot  it will be tender. You need to press firmly here, however. This is also a great point to use when youre in the delivery room to ease the discomfort of labor.    Shoulder Well (GB21)    This point is where your shoulder muscle is highest, approximately four finger-widths from your shoulder joint toward your neck. The point should be the most tender of all of the points along the shoulder. You can also teach this point to your partner and ask him to use it on you while youre in the delivery room to reduce your labor pains.    Big and High (BL60)    This point helps the baby to descend toward the pelvis. It is located between the ankle bone and the Achilles tendon on the back of your foot just above the heel.    Three Yin Crossing (SP6)    This point helps to ripen the cervix and strengthen weak contractions. It is located four finger-widths above the ankle next to the bone on the inside of the leg. If you find a spot that is more tender than the surrounding areas, you have found the correct point.    You can also try applying pressure to the roof of your mouth with your tongue. This is a little known acupressure point that you can easy stimulate while youre doing any of your day-to-day tasks.      Hope this helps!
WlU3NFu6aa	I think we are missing a few extra words here|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Yes, No, Maybe So?
AA11763588	It's possible. You have to keep in mind that some pregnancy symptoms are the same as the ones you'd get when you are about to start your period.    I'd suggest not bringing it up to her just yet. Wait 5 days after her missed period then try a test.    Good luck!!|`|2ea0131ea655753572f33b84f26cdfffaa	Don't start getting your hopes up yet.  I'm just cautioning you.  It is common (especially among women who have not already had children) to have the occasional fluke in their menstrual cycle and bloating and nausea are early indicators, but not THIS early.      I will admit, when i concieved, before I found out I was pregnant I had tenderness in my breasts, more so than usually associated with my oncoming menstrual period) but I kept telling myself that I just knew my period was coming any day because of the breast pain.      My husband and I tried to have a baby for 6 years before we concieved (Celestial was born 4 months before our 7th wedding annaversary) and we have had countless false alarms.  Many things can account for this, stress, anticipation (did you know, through the power of suggestion, a woman who has convinced herself she is pregnant can actually stop menstrating and start lactating?! It's true! The mind is a wonderous thing!)    Now, I'm not saying she's NOT pregnant. I'm just saying, don't start looking for early warning signs.  They are not reliable enough to rest your hopes upon.  In fact, when we were first married, I was over 10 days late for my period! I was certain I was pregnant! But I was not.    My advice to you both is to stop thinking about it so much.  Take it easy, relax, and start enjoying each other.  You can keep trying to time your coupling based on her basal body temerature (which is an average of 1/10th of a degree higher than average during ovulation) and just wait until she's missed.  If you're so eager to know, keep a supply of pregnancy tests in your medicine cabinet so when she's several days late, she can take one.  But jumping at any "early warning sign" will only serve to raise and then dash your hopes.|`|5UcdeeX8aa	You know you should buy her a test and some prenatal vitamins. A lot of women spot during the time they would normally menstruate during pregnancy- just the body's habit. Even if she isn't pregnant go ahead and tell her she should start taking prenatals. It'll help you conceive and not only that when she does get pregnant it prevents neural tube defects and will make her less tired during the beginning months.|`|SnyDa8Claa	Okay, just so you know 4 months isn't an especially long time to try. It takes some perfectly healthy people up to a year to conceive. Hopefully for you guys this isn't the case.    Secondly, she needs to take the pressure of herself. I found that once I took the "if it happens, it happens" attitude, it did.    Now to answer your question.. it is quite possible she is pregnant. It could be implantation bleeding, or as I had bleeding the week my period was due with no cramps (I too have terrible cramps, they double me over).    Let her decide to take the test. Sometimes you have to let the person do things at their own pace. The worst thing that can happen is that you find out you are expecting next month.    Good luck. I really hope it happens for you guys soon.|`|5k0FKWTSaa	I'm afraid doing a pregnancy test will be the most definitive way of telling if she's pregnant. Most of the pregnancy symptoms are non-specific and can occur in non-pregnant ladies as well.    I would wait a couple more days before taking the preg test to reduce the risk of false negatives (sometimes if the pregnancy hormone levels are still low, it might not show up on the test). The longer you leave it, the higher the levels will be and the quicker it will turn blue/positive.(If she's pregnant)    GOOD LUCK.    And remember, approx 75-80% of couples will fall pregnant after trying for 1 year. If your wife is younger than 35 yr old, then your doctor will not be interested to see you guys regarding fertility checks until you've tried for 1 year. (Unless there's preexisting fertility problems, like reversal of sterilisation etc)
TJpQZju2aa	When my babies got too big for the baby tub or the sink, but too little to be in the tub alone, I would just get in the big tub or the shower with them.  It provides a real opportunity for bonding and isn't as hard on your back|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	Try a bath seat.

When she grew out of her baby tub we searched around for a new option and found a toddler size tub. Its been great so far. Its a good size and has plenty of room for my one year old.   There's a molded seat area and an area for her to lay in too if needed.  Unfortunately she still splashes everywhere, but I just bought a vinyl tablecloth to go under the tub to she can splash away and have fun.    Here's a link to the tub.  Good luck!  http://www.bonnybabies.com/eurobath.htm|`|XHFj2IVhaa	My mother used to bath us kids in the sink when we were younger.     When mine were younger, i often ended up in the tub with them, as it just seemed so much easier. It doesn't mean you have to be stripped-down naked in there with them, just standing in there. Or, clean out your sink real good and use it, instead..    Or, buy a bigger baby bath...|`|UDSn7k6Oaa	I think 11 months old is young enough to bathe in the sink. Or you could take one of those kiddie pools -- you know the plastic ones -- and bathe it in there. Good luck!|`|pStUmM52aa	sink
IVSqQQzlaa	If you go definitely make sure your son is wearing ear plugs.|`|1r05fktRaa	you can|`|HyknHVV5aa	I don't think you should go.

They are always he the weekend of his birthday! He has been going since his 3rd b-day and he is now 9. Just remember to get some good earplugs and make sure understands that he can not take them out. If you are worried about a truck coming out of the arena into the stands then just buy the 'nose bleed" section tickets!|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	My husband took our three year old son to the monster truck show in the cities a few weeks ago.

What I'm saying is you never know what will happen where.  As long as they have stadium seating I don't see a problem..  I would be a little worried if the seats were on the ground level but aside from that I've been and they've been very fun...  There is always a chance of something happening somewhere so why rule out all the fun...|`|iyk9o7UJaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! DON'T DO IT|`|l31zUisLaa	Hello, the kid is 3..... not 13 or 23    your child will not know what's going on or where he is and because of the fact that it is loud he may start crying..... do you want to leave in the middle of the show?|`|JDgHyMrUaa	i heard on the news that a toddler got injured in one of those shows..i don't remember how but something hit him..
qgGwZbogaa	There are no foods that directly cause miscarriage. The cause of miscarriage is usually unpredictable and unknown.     Your friend should however avoid raw fish sushi or any type and unpasteurized cheeses or uncultured cheeses. As well as meat not cooked properly and the usual drills that apply to everyone.    Good Luck to your friend babies are wonderful creatures!|`|SnyDa8Claa	There are no foods that cause miscarriage. Miscarriage occurs when the fetus fails to develop properly.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	I don't know of any food correlations.  Miscarriages happen for a number of reasons, most are no fault of the mother.    There are a number of food/drink no-no's which her doctor has likely already filled her in on (such as alcohol).|`|xOvPuyfHaa	Miscarriages can't be avoided, but if you are thinking of things you want to do to try to give a "low risk" during her pregnancy. don't eat sushi or drink a lot of caffeine or high trans fat foods.     :]  I hope I helped.  You can google it if you would like to look for yourself.|`|AA11763588	Miscarriages can not be stopped, they mostly occur because of genetics. Certain chromosomes did not meet up properly.
P544Sbmqaa	If your kids dont hate you at least occasionally, you are not being a good parent.  I understand it hurts your feelings, but you cant let him see that it does.  He probably just said it out of frustration, but if he sees it upsets you, he will start saying it out of manipulation.  Tell him that he can hate you all he wants, but that is not the way to get whatever he wants, and whatever you do, DONT give in to whatever his tantrum was about.|`|AA10691319	it must be the age, my five year old has said that to myself and his mother before but its usually when hes had a long day and we make him go to bed instead of stay up and play.  id say more than likely in when morning comes he wont remember saying it and be back to normal.|`|D1KuofYPaa	he doesn't mean it, he's just throwing the word around.|`|vYt7LWTvaa	My daughter says it to me.

Next time he says that you can do one of these options:  1) say "I'm sorry you feel that way, but I love you!" and continue on like it doesn't bother you but don't let him do whatever the issue is  or  2) tell him that he is being rude and hurtful and it is unacceptable to speak to his mother like that and give him a 10 minute time out at the kitchen table with his head down - no talking, no moving.|`|8p7uLYD4aa	I am a Father of a 10 month old and have a 4 1/2 year old stepson that tells me and his Mother about once a week that he hates us after being put in time out. The first time he said it, it was hurtful, I love him as my own. I responded with "that's OK, you can hate me all you want and I'll always love you anyways" These days we pretty much just ignore him, or say "oh well, when you're ready to act like a big boy you can come out" I've considered saying "no you can't have dessert because I hate you" just to show him how it feels, but I know how it feels from my own Mother so have never crossed that line. We have also started the 3 strikes rule and the key seems to be consistency and never giving in. We still deal with tantrums, but aren't feeling the guilt like we used to.|`|28WJwHf4aa	And what did you say in return? And do?     He's not old enough to fully understand the meaning behind the word, so don't take it personal. Don't let it slide either.

He was climbing on the washing line, and i said "GET DOWN." He didn't. So I said if he didn't get down, he would not get dessert. He didnt get down, and when dessert came, with none for him, he hated me.    Oh and hahah the 5y/o Sophia and I were playing one day when she just said "I hate you Rory." I said "Soph, that's not nice at all. Why!" and she said "I don't know." and giggled. I told her off, but yeah.|`|49f06b796d54e170c36a6cf4fc463182aa	My son loves to do this when I tell him he can not have something, and at other times for no appearant reason because he has mental health issues.  It really hurts my heart when he does this.  Sometimes I think our children study us and learn what hurts us the most.  Then when they do not get what they want or for other reasons they tell us these things to make us feel bad for some reason.  When ever he tells me that I say the same thing you did... that I love him very much.  I tell him I always love him even when his body does not nice things.  I tell him that I will love him forever and that it makes me sad when he says those things.|`|02ouBqEdaa	well i am 13 and i tell my parents that all the time but do not mean it Just let it slid this time and next time put the kid in timeout

If you injure yourself while you are still healing it's going to make your recovery time much worse.     I was just taking long walks with my daughter about 3 weeks after my c section nothing more than that. Once you get cleared... go all out! It only took me 6 weeks to get back into shape once I started working out for real.
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    I had the same problem in my first pregnancy, i worked out that i must of been around 8 weeks in my first dating scan, when in fact they said my baby measured 5 weeks.  I didn't understand how as me and my partner were on a break around the time they were saying i conceived and i never slept with anyone else.  When i went for my 12 week scan they only changed my due date by 1 day, so i didn't have a clue what was going on.  When it came to my 20 week scan my baby had grown alot and was now measuring what i said in the first place, but they wouldn't change my due date.    Sadly i lost my baby at 34 weeks, he was stillborn and he came out 4lbs 4 and half oz's and 49 cm long.  My midwife who delivered him said he looked like he only had a few more weeks left, he also had my partners looks.    So i was right and the ultrasound people are wrong. See what happens in the 20 week scan they might notice a difference.   Have you heard the heartbeat? As they say they can't normally hear this until your 14 weeks pregnant.  Also do you have a bump? People usually start showing around 16 weeks with their first babies.  At 13 weeks i had no bump, but it started gradually showing around 16 weeks and by 20 weeks i was massive lol.    Best of luck and congratulations xx
piI1aWOdaa	ita guesstimate anyway..but the earlier the can the more accurat ethe date..just remember most 1st babies on average are born 10 days post due date anyway|`|sw2R5A9iaa	if your OB is unable to address your concerns, seek a 2nd opinion.|`|JDgHyMrUaa	well i had many due dates and finally they measure my baby and they told me august 5 and i had him the 3rd.. so i will go with what the doc tells you..|`|qgGwZbogaa	Calculating a due date is never an exact science only an estimate. OB's can be off by as many as 4 weeks. They depend on the days of your cycle but if you have an irregular cycle or ovulated early or late it can change all of those factors. As long as your baby is tracking visually by ultrasound with development they will adjust your due date accordingly. If you or your husband happen to be tall or carry traits of that nature you baby can just be a big baby.    Good Luck to you! I hope this helps|`|lm0nlP04aa	when they do the ultrasounds it really isn't an exact science when they are measuring and predicting dates.  They pretty much are giving an educated "guess".  That is why the dates can change.  The farther along you go and as you have an ultra sound again, they can always change the date again.  So don't fret.  Relax.  They are only human and can make mistakes of predicting.  As long as your baby is healthy that is what is important.

Everyone loves newborns you will probably get many friends and family members willing to come by and keep you company or take watch over the little one while you try to cry it out in the bathtub. Knowing that others are there to help will help you get over the depression faster.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	You need to talk to a doctor.  In some women this goes away on its own and in some it does not.  You are not in the best position to judge how you are feeling.    Of course you love your son!  Your baby will be fine.  But you deserve to enjoy this time, and not struggle as much.    So talk to your doctor -- just your regular OB/GYN.  You can even mention it to your baby's pediatrician if that's the next doctor you see.  They will take you very seriously and help you to take steps to address the problem.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Call for an appointment with your doctor tomorrow. There is a lot they can do for you but if you don't call they can't help you.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	get someone to come over and help you out with your new baby if you don't have a husband or boyfriend there....if your feelings don"t change in a few days I would call your DR...it could be PPD|`|gyoylefvaa	You need to talk to a doctor. In some women this goes away on its own and in some it does not. You are not in the best position to judge how you are feeling and remember your husband is your support too.    Of course you love your son! Your baby will be fine. But you deserve to enjoy this time, and not struggle as much. Take a day off ask a family member to help you with your baby.    So talk to your doctor -- just your regular OB/GYN. You can even mention it to your baby's pediatrician if that's the next doctor you see. They will take you very seriously and help you to take steps to address the problem.    Good Luck! I'm a mommy too.    It's hard but they are precious.|`|2MKvrydWaa	My doctor told me that every women during pregnancy or after having thier baby will go through the baby blues and it is perfectly normal and it does'nt last very long.but sometimes it can become alittle more serious and that is what u call postpartum depression.if u talk 2 ur doc about it they may say u have it and that they can put u on pills.many women go through it and it can be very serious so it's good to get help at the first signs.not saying u have it or anythin b/c that is the docs job but it's safe to be on the safe side.hope i helped and congrats on the baby:-)|`|spyFRmu4aa	It is definiatly post pardom.  I have 2 children 12 and 10 and I had the same feelings but horrible thoughts.  If someone can help you out and help take care of your son for a little while just to break up the crazieness try that and if it gets worse I would tell your doctor and he could probably give you something temporary.      Good Luck it gets better.
