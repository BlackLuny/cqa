d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Andrew Sullivan, a gay Christian, who admitted he has no reason to believe what he does when debating Sam Harris, is not the best source to quote.<br>  <br>  An uninformed populous has no ability to actually make the decisions necessary for democracy to work. That includes law. In the US, "national security" has been used to circumvent governmental transparency - by both major parties - and there are more laws published each year than anyone could possibly read. That means the democracy left is little more than a front.

NMpbLtuTaa	Totalitarianists can't dominate to the degree they would like while Rush Limbaugh is talking freely.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  This looks like what Obama and the Democrats are attempting to do:<br>  <br>  "Totalitarianism (or totalitarian rule) is a concept used to describe political systems whereby a state regulates nearly every aspect of public and private life. Totalitarian regimes or movements maintain themselves in political power by means of an official all-embracing ideology and propaganda disseminated through the state-controlled mass media, a single party that controls the state, personality cults, control over the economy, regulation and restriction of free discussion and criticism, the use of mass surveillance, and widespread use of terror tactics."<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitaria...</a>|`|ksOW8Y4Aaa	Wow, you're missing the forest for the trees.

N3OB7M8maa	The Dow has dropped by the largest margin under Obama than any other president in the last 90 years. The Dow is down about 3000 points since election day. <br>  <br>  My 401K and my wife's IRA have both been depleted by about 30% since Obama was elected.|`|TQCSwCpQaa	Huh?  What's your question?
i7oHTo9haa	Yes.  His ideas are causing quite a commotion and nobody has alot of confidence, hence the Dow drops further because of lack of confidence or support for his LAME ideas.|`|IsGo50kqaa	It was climbing slowly (after a two-year drop including the oil speculation bubble burst) until he got into office, then leveled off until he let out a few of his biggest zingers - then, as you noticed, it dropped like a rock.  <br>  <br>  Look at it this way, both parties believe in big government.  Even during the Reagan presidency, government spending increased (although, towards the end, while spending did not increase, the economy was booming due to across the board tax cuts and less government interference in business).  However, Republicans tend to spend on things that help everybody and the technical industries where the USA has an edge via national defense whereas Democrats tend to throw money down the drain by giving it to special interest groups to spend willy nilly on social programs with little return or benefit except to a few.  <br>  <br>  Investors understand that the increased taxes hit mainly investment monies, savings, and industry which means the economy will slow and they will lose money instead of gaining so they bail.  Really, Carter tried the Keynesian ideas that Obama so loves and it nearly destroyed the US economy so they have a pretty clear picture of what to expect from using such failed ideas.|`|81Iglngeaa	its silly how liberals dont see that obama talking down the economy doesnt make wall street drop everyday.

Illegal aliens can lie to anyone to get a job, why not Obama?  The nomination of an illegal for a president is also not a crime, just violation of ethics, if the Dems and Libs have any; they would not defend Clinton for his TV lie: “I DID NOT HAVE A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT WOMAN!<br>  Go to www.obamacrimes.com and see the frustration of the lawyers with this case.  No precedent yet!  <br>  Until Obama lies to the judge or the FBI or to the investigating detective/policemen he can not be charge with breaking the law.  If Obama, and only he under oath, not his staff or the party of Dems, or any city or state employee, presents the documents establishing his qualification for the presidency, and WITH his (direct) knowledge that it was false, than, and only than, he may be breaking the law.  Obama knows this, (the Clintons, the FBI, the Kenyans, and others know this and will use it in time to black mail him,  think why are Clintonites in Obama’s cabinet?) he, Obama, knows more, he knows that no private person or organization can charge him with braking the law, it has to be the DA.  BUT FIRST HE HAS TO BRAK THE LAW!  He is not stupid, just the masses, the mob, the Libs the LYNCH MOB IS IGNORANT.<br>  He, Obama, must declare under penalty of perjury that he is a U.S. citizen, if he does that, he still is free, and considered an innocent, because the DA must prove behind a reasonable doubt that he, OBAMA committed the perjury.  Than the like O.J.s jury will set him free.  Any questions?<br>  Our freedom has created this dilemma, therefore, protect the freedom for all, for Obama and for me, and ask the question why Obama is not defending such freedom for all.  Why is he taking only advantage of our freedom, LIKE THE TERRORISTS DID?   He, Obama, with his actions, disgrace the USA in front of the entire World? <br>  If this part of the constitution is change, that is OK with me, maybe Arnold can run next, but our constitution should not be bluntly disregard!<br>  <br>  JUST see THE PRESS VIDEO, AND see HOW FRUSTRATED THE LADY LAWER IS: she knows the STALIN, HITLER, CASTRO, and SCHAVES SOCIALISTIC FREEDOM.  IN THE NAME OF THE MASSES WE, THE LYCH MOB, TAKE YOUR LIBERTY! <br>  <br>  More and more people are aware of the fact that Obama does not meet the constitutional ‘qualifications’ and that this is the biggest ‘Hoax’ perpetrated on the citizens of the United States in 230 years.<br>  <br>  <br>   Philip J. Berg, Esq. Efforts to Expose Obama not being “qualified” to be President.<br>  “I am proceeding for the 305 + million people in ‘our’ U.S.A., for ‘our’ forefathers and for the thousands and thousands that have died defending our Constitution with the legal fight to prove that Obama is not constitutionally qualified to be President.” <br>  <br>  <br>  Philip J.

He hopes to turn this country into a socialist/communist regime. At the rate he is spending our money, he will bankrupt this country, and we will all be totally dependent on government for housing, food, clothing, healthcare, and the taxes that will be redistributed will come from those who were fortunate enough to be successful in their businesses.<br>  <br>  My daughter-in-law has a small business with five employees. Her gross business income is approximately $500,000. When Obama raises her taxes, she will have to lay off at least one of her employees. So much for helping the small businesses.|`|CpTQagJOaa	I agree Americans should be top priority...will never happen though with Obama in office.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	Anyone who expects anything but lies from a politician is living in a fantasy world.Does not make a difference who or what party.Even if an honest person got elected,they would have to become what the rest are or they would be stoned to death to keep them from exposing the rest.

oB8TysC5aa	Yes I drink to much at home. I would go to Pubs but they are now all to violent and it is not safe to walk home during the hours of darkness.<br>  <br>  And I need the drink to drown out all the stupid and ridiculous ideas coming out from both Central and Local Government departments on a now hourly basis|`|MGOFjVnVaa	i am strictly opposed to government regulations how private<br>  individuals should live. of course there is a thin line between<br>  use and abuse of tobacco, alcohol, painkillers, energy drinks<br>  and so on. government should stay out of this as much as possible<br>  and intervene if criminality is involved.<br>  actually it is absurd to forbid smoking because of health dangers<br>  but not outlawing cars and industrial pollution, both of which<br>  are a lot more dangerous to our health than tobacco. of course<br>  one could restrict smoking to specially assigned rooms only,<br>  but to forbid it even in open air is just ridiculous.<br>  drinking is quite a different matter, one should not drink regularly,<br>  but basically alcohol is there to enjoy and nothing to be<br>  addicted to. alcohol may lead to excesses to family tragedies<br>  to people dying from drunken drivers and so on. seen this way<br>  alcohol is a lot more dangerous than tobacco.<br>  you should not foget the dangers of overeating - i almost suspect<br>  that your country's government will cook up legal action about<br>  that, too.<br>  <br>  basically the government is taking away a lot of personal<br>  freedom by intervening.<br>  <br>  the fact remains, that everybody should be very careful not<br>  to get addicted to anything.<br>  <br>  if you drink daily - you drink too much. try to stay without<br>  alcohl for a week. if this is a problem for you then you are<br>  addicted already.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	No.  I don't drink alcohol.<br>  <br>  The government stopped smoking in pubs because it was affecting the health of the people who worked 8 hour shifts breathing in second hand smoke.  <br>  <br>  They are increasing the price of drink in supermarkets as it is driving pubs out of business and also is causing a rise in anti social behaviour.  <br>  <br>  So if you want anyone to blame for this, blame the chavs standing drinking on the street corners on a Friday and Saturday night.<br>  <br>  Edit: Pubs like Wetherspoons are thriving.  It's pubs that aren't chains that are doing badly.  Why?  Because they are being priced out of the equation.  Can a small family run pub  compete with the prices that a Wetherspoons, Jumpin' jacks or a Yates offer?  No i don't think so, this is more effective in closing pubs than a smoking ban.|`|gYThMID8aa	Actually it's the Scottish parliament who are seeking to increase the prices but it wont make people drink any less.<br>  Personally I don't drink but even if beer was ￡20 a pint people would still drink if they have the need to.<br>  Dope heads pay that much for an illegal drugs fix so an alcoholic would still find the money to drink even if it means turning to crime to get the money ( and it probably would! )<br>  Result; We have an even bigger drugs/alcohol/crime problem.|`|0waBXFsSaa	I never do anything quietly.  The government can't be ar*ed to sort out the sum yobs that binge booze or those that do it from loneliness by providing proper policing and punishment for one and social outreach for the other ( they would probably get it the wrong way round if they tried.)  Just law abiding people being hit again as the soft option.<br>  <br>  Police are being armed with more tasers, the troops will soon be called back.  It ain't terrorists Brown's B*ggerups fear - its US!|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Well, I'm a non-smoker (like 75% of the population) and I actually visit pubs a lot more since the smoking ban came in.|`|49ab98a398999572255d3e22857a03faaa	No, I wish, lol.

I did have a small G&T last night, but that is unusual. If we go out I am the designated driver, so I can't drink then either. I think it is this government who is driving the country to drink.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	You couldn't smoke in a lot of places when they banned it in pubs. I didn't see anyone complaining about not having the freedom to walk around the supermarket smoking. Millions of taxpayers money goes every year to treating people with health problems related to second hand smoke. You having to take a few steps outside for a few minutes if you don't have control of your addiction isn't a big deal compared to that. It's pretty sad if your addiction actually stops you going out.<br>  <br>  They raised taxes in alcohol at supermarkets so pubs wouldn't go out of business so people could keep their jobs. If you NEED to get drunk at home, accept that because of the state of the economy, you're going to need to pay a little more. I don't really think your need to get drunk cheaply is more important than the economy. <br>  <br>  But of course, they should just let everyone live as they please right? Screw the economy and other people's health if it has any small effect on people's every day lives.|`|xU7AaQOdaa	They will be banning the social use of Cannabis next!!!<br>  <br>  In response to one answer, how do those Bar Staff who looked forward to working in a "Smoke Free" environment feel now, when the Pub they used to work in has closed down due to lack of Customers, brought about largely by the smoking ban?

94618fa9aff7c44a9bbefcc52d8a7de7aa	Somewhere around 2010 or 2011 when the states falls completely apart without warning.

3hAPLJ4Iaa	You have to remember the primary motivation behind FOX and Limbaugh.  The Soundbite.<br>  The thought that they want to be accurate with any stories involving Mr. Jindal or Mr. Obama is only secondary to these people.  Here is a list of what they want to accomplish:<br>  <br>  -Both FOX (but especially Limbaugh) have a simple, burning personal hatred towards our president to such an degree that they simply can't resist the opportunity to show disrespect to him whenever they can, no matter how childish that makes them look.<br>  <br>  -Bobby JIndal is the current rising star in the Rebublican Party, he is obviously very smart, very sharp, and very Republican.  And he obviously has a bigger plans for himself within the party, and FOX and Rush realizes this and is willing to make him look good, even it means ignoring his given name to make him appear "more American."<br>  <br>  -And for the most part, it really drives FOX (and especally Rush Limbaugh) absolutely nuts knowing that the Republican party is currently on the outs with the American public.  It really sticks in their side that it is the Democrats turn to have the power, and that the Republican party is not as important that it once was.  <br>  <br>  -Their primary goal is to get the Republican party back into power, by whatever means necessary, and, it just so happens, that we have a president who is an individual of color.  This is currently popular with the American public.  Now they will start backing an individual of color to counteract Obama, and Bobby Jindal fits the bill nicely.  <br>  <br>  -They Probably don't even like Bobby Jindal personally (I have always felt that Rush Limbaugh is a bigot, but does not have the stones to admit it in public) but FOX and Limbaugh both feel that Jindal is the means to the end, and they will use him.  And if they have the chance to disrespect the President at the same time, they will take it.  <br>  <br>  After all, they are really only interested in ratings, which translates into money, and with that in mind, they won't bother themselves with something quite so nobel as the public good.|`|kvRhnn7daa	Because FOX are a bunch of retards who listen to the head guy whose the biggest retard of them all, whos ultra-right wing and doesn't have the slightest bit of respect for his own President, that's why.<br>  <br>  Understand this: I know the media, and there's always the big CEO who controls everyone under his command - makes sure that his views are shared, never mind the whole "meant to be unbiased rule".<br>  <br>  Fox are well known to be a bunch of jackasses anyway.|`|c88d6a4b2e8a26ac9bd239980605f6f8aa	Probably because Fox and Rush Limbaugh don't like Barack Hussein Obama and they do like Piyush "Bobby" Jindal. <br>  <br>  I don't like Barack Hussein Obama.|`|55ac50ec591a2bbc757c20a9ce8c4322aa	hussein sounds like a terrorist, piyush doesnt|`|NMpbLtuTaa	I thought the liberal complaint was that some conservatives were calling President Obama, "Barry". Why should they be surprised if they are calling Governor Jindal, "Bobby"?|`|aGcRB3pyaa	Obviously because Jindal is a Republican, and is ok by them.
A2itL7i6aa	your arrogance amazes me. America will always prevail and do whats right ?/!! ok so iraq and vietnam was right?|`|ds5Vt2Evaa	The US has offended Russia in several ways over the last 20 years, primarily by breaking several treaties in ways that threaten Russia's security. The best three examples I can remember off the top of my head are a unilateral withdrawl from arms-control treaties that were signed with the Soviet Union in the early 90s, the acceptance of Russia's close neighbours into NATO despite having promised not to do so, and having US military bases in nearby countries that have an active missle shield component. The second is a factor because Russia is not part of NATO and NATO was originally a military defence bloc intended primarily against the Soviet Union (it is still seen partly as being anti-Russian). The third is a factor because Russian-American relations still have elements of detente to them, and the close presence of US military bases with technology that makes some parts of the Russian military less effective is threatening to them.<br>  <br>  In sum, Russia feels threatened by America's breaking of treaties, military blocs that move ever closer to their borders but will never include them, and American deployment of systems that nullify parts of their military.|`|AA11337952	This is just a my own personal opinion, but I think this arose at least partially from Putin's re-delegation of power between the Russian President and the Russian Prime Minister. He was no longer able to run for President due to the term restrictions in the country, but before his term ended, he transferred a lot of power that the president had to the prime minister. Then, when a new president was elected, he became prime minister.<br>  <br>  The U.S. pointed it out, and it almost went to World Court, but the issue died before it got there. The United States thinks Putin has grown attached to power, and is trying to keep as much of it as he can for himself. It's speculated that the current Russian President is little more than a puppet of Putin.
j3XhuCC3aa	he was hanged till death in a Ambala jail on  November 15, 1949.|`|cWuumdy7aa	Following his assassination of Gandhi, he was put on trial beginning May 27, 1948. During the trial, he did not defend any charge and openly admitted that he killed Gandhi. On November 8, 1949 Godse was sentenced to death for the murder of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Godse's legal team was savaged by critics for not introducing considerable evidence that their client was mentally unbalanced and/or manipulated by others. Among those calling for commutation of the death sentence for the defendants were Jawaharlal Nehru, as well as Gandhi's two sons who felt that the two men on trial were pawns of RSS higher-ups, and in any case, executing their father's killers would dishonor his memory and legacy which included a staunch opposition to the death penalty. Godse was hanged at Ambala Jail on November 15, 1949, along with Narayan Apte, the other conspirator. Savarkar was also charged with conspiracy in the assassination of Gandhi, but was acquitted and subsequently released. Godse stipulated that his ashes were not to be deposited in a body of water according to Hindu dictates, but rather were to be held in storage until they could be deposited in The Sindhu after Pakistan had been reunited with India. For years, his brother kept Godse's ashes over his fireplace and held an annual salute to "the hero martyrs" on the anniversary of the assassination.Gopal Vinayak Godse  was the brother of Nathuram Godse and one of the conspirators in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi on January 30, 1948. He was the last one to survive and lived his last days in Pune, Maharashtra, India.Godse was released from prison in October 1964, but was re-arrested a month later under the Defense of India Act and kept in prison for over a year. He was finally released at the end of 1965. He has written two books Gandhi hatya ani mee (Gandhi's Assassination and Me) Panchavanna Kotinche Bali (The sacrifice of fifty-five crores).he died in november 2005|`|PzSI7EPEaa	He died a proud man.

Maurice Cooper was the KING of his house, which ran on the basic idea of "Don't do as I do--do what I TELL YOU to do!!"  As Queen of the Cooper home, Rebbecca probably endured a lot of misery behind closed doors.  Expect a book deal from her later on this year.<br>  <br>  The media camera never lies. Through it--I see a stunned, amazed Rebbecca Cooper, who probably experienced sudden relief and elation that the misery she endured now was over---and having the $$$$ flood in surely eases the grief.  Put it this way: Rebecca's going out for doing what she got to--for her kids and herself; the gold digger persona does fit here.<br>  <br>  As for Maurice's father: He holds the atypical urban street view of family death---where deeply committed spirituality kicks in with the thought of "God has called Maurice home, for he's done what God intended him to do"; which likely was put dear ol' dad up into a lifetime of ease and comfort, paid for by Cooper's million$.<br>  <br>  As you can see, there IS akin merit to how Cooper's wife and father view his death: Money gonna make it all right and better.<br>  <br>  But do expect soon to see Maurice's dad and wife battle it out in court over Maurice's estate; both have scrambled to get lawyers---and the fight IS on the way, so stay tuned.
oXvas8vTaa	Care if I proofread this a little bit? By the way, this is really good but you might want to advert yourself from posting unpublished writings on the internet because anyone can steal them.<br>  <br>  Here goes! (Regardless if I changed words or even switched them, everything is correct; I'm a grammar junkie.)<br>  <br>  Ok, let's change terminology to civil union, as it is less controversial and best describes what we are fighting for. I oppose the government having the authority to legislate person social decisions, and I also oppose discrimination. Those who are against "Civil Union" are acting purely out of prejudice and bigotry to deny the benefits of state-sanctioned monogamy based on the gender of the persons involved. It's gender-based discrimination, plain and simple. When you look at all of the arguments against the civil union, only the completely religious ones are even rational. We don't forbit people who are old or young or that are infertle from getting married, so it's not about procreation. And, though the religious arguments against are true as far as they go, our constitution forbids the government from acting based on religious ground. If the only reason for something is of religious purpose, it cannot be enacted as law. The only question is how long it's going to take people to realize that prejiduce, hatred, and bigotry are inherently worse than any experession of love could ever be. Domestic partnership is still legal in California; the churches need to stop wasting their money into Prop 8. If they want to ban gay marriage from the churches, let them. But we need to stop churches from corrupting out laws. The Declaration of Independence and the Contstitution have phrases like, "All men are created equal," and "Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." Why not let me have my happiness if it doesn't interfere with yours?|`|tguEmxVyaa	Not very good.

Nukes  in enemy hands if they can get the nuke they can find a way to deliver it.  When we fight by national borders we neutralize them and ally up with more moderate Muslim nations to not get taken over and able to deal with their hostile incoming.
