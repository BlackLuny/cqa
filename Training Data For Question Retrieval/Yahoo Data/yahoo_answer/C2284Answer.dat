a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I'm am a 5th grade teacher at an elementary in Maryland. Hope my replies hope and I am sorry the other teacher made it difficult for you to complete your report.    1. In many factors, I do think that obesity does hinder the social relationships that the child has with other students. Especially at an elementary level, while the children are learning new things, it's best to make each child feel like they fit in.    2. I have found that some of the children that came from minority groups do find it more difficult to learn. This all depends on the parents taking the time to work with the children and their development-cognitive and social- outside of the school to ensure that the child does get a well-rounded education.    3. All children and their learning styles are different. I've noticed that some children do well in the beginning and then excel toward the end. On the other hand, the children have a difficult time learning from the beginning.     4. I think making games out of the learning process and what the teacher is teaching makes things go a lot smoother. Reading straight from the text book of course makes the children less involved personally. I think having the children think for themselves by breaking them off into social groups or having them answer questions helps with social development and strengthens reading comprehension.    5. Each child is different. Many positive teachers of course expect success at the end of each term. I, personally, do make sure that every child is doing their best-and makes sure that if not, they receive the help they deserve.    6.Since I teach a higher grade level, I really don't deal with the outbursts that a kindergarten teacher would.    7.I am and have always been available for a student to talk with me.  I think the relationship between a student/teacher always becomes strengthened when they realize that you are not just there to teach them mundane drills.    8.I think social acceptance is the biggest thing in this age group. Groups/social cliques start forming for girls and sometimes in boys.

Like someone on campus selling drugs or a terrorist threat.

And it shows how people think!  hopefully i gave you a sort of a idea.

Dh0JX2Onaa	The Vice-President does what the President assigns him to do and takes over when the President is not available. That means in most cases...nothing./|`|34VXCyvVaa	Nothing, unless the president gets arrested for drugs or something and booted out of school.|`|be5NSs0Maa	it really depends on the school you're going to, and the people that are running for president, reps, etc.     mostly, you step up in the president's absence when they are unable to say, attend a meeting, or is gone for the day. otherwise, in schools that aren't tight with their rules or procedures, then you may go a whole year without needing to step up for anything.     student council should be a collaboration, and it is most of the time if the president seeks everyone's input, but it would be a good idea to be the main support for your president's plans, and be active regardless of the prospects. it's important that you keep positive and attentive if you are elected, because that's what leadership is about!     good v-ps won't just be another limb in the group, they'll actively seek to get everyone to participate, be the back-up for the president.    very fun position!
6QIpltVyaa	for your first question, some school have honor classes and some don't. You have to find out 1st if they do and 2nd are these  the classes you want to be put in? the work load will be more difficult and advanced. SO ask around and make sure you have a copy of your  grades so you can show the teachers. Teachers are very busy sometimes so they may not have time to think about honor classes so i recommend you try to go up to the teacher. be assertive , and ask :)    for your second. question AP means advance placement. it is usually given in high school, which this time it is your choice in whatever subject you are interested in and if the high school is offering it. The class goes very fast and alot of information is thrown at you. The class is not treated as a regular high school class, the teacher teaches you on a college level. you will have to take an exam at the end of the semester which includes some written and some multiple choice answers on everything you learned for the past 5months. the test is ranged from 1-5 points if you get a 4 or 5 this class will  be credited into your file as a passed college course, so when you enter college you will not have to take the class and it will save you money, and also it will look good on your high school  transcript.
AXiKJDV9aa	You don't say what your sophomore year grades were.  But with a current 4.0 GPA (provided that is unweighted - if it is weighted then it much more iffy) they would need to be pretty bad for you not to get in.  I would say don't worry - you will be fine.    However with grades like that why not consider some other schools like Cal-tech and Harvey Mudd as well:  http://www.caltech.edu/  http://www.hmc.edu/    By far the most important advice I can give anyone about getting into a good college is don't pin your hopes on any particular one such as USC.    Thanks  Bill

9ZDCN4pAaa	The first is correct. I think for the most part conjunctions (and, but & or) wouldn't have a comma before them, unless perhaps if the first and second halves of the sentence were independent clauses.    I.e. I hate eating broccoli and other green veggies.    "I hate eating broccoli" = independent clause.  "other green veggies." = dependent clause.  No comma.    I didn't want to go to school, but I went anyway.    "I didn't want to go to school" = independent clause  "I went anyway." = independent clause  Comma|`|ig0miCndaa	first one is right|`|AA11703652	the first

To mitigate that concern I would do it at a hard science school.  IMHO Caltech and MIT are the two best schools in the world - but they are also hard science schools.

bf5cDEyZaa	The medical symbol is called caduceus.    Serpents are symbolic, they are connected with poison and medicine. The snake's venom is associated with the chemicals of plants and fungi that have the power to either heal, poison or provide expanded consciousness (and even the elixir of life and immortality) through divine intoxication. Because of its herbal knowledge, the snake was often considered one of the wisest animals, being (close to the) divine.     Serpents are also connected with renewal or regeneration. This trait is connected with the practice of snakes of shedding their old skin and growing a new one.    Good luck with your assignment!    PS: short herald's staff entwined by two serpents in the form of a double helix - that just a description of the shape of the symbol, it does not represent DNA. When the symbol was designed, DNA was not yet known.|`|ZddXPpF1aa	They are thought to represent the double helix of DNA. Check wikipedia ..Caduceus..that is what the emblem is called. Good luck|`|ZdIaVkIcaa	The caduceus is typically depicted as a short herald's staff entwined by two serpents in the form of a double helix, and sometimes is surmounted by wings. This staff first was borne by Iris, the messenger of Hera. It also was called the wand of Hermes when he superseded Iris in much later myths.    Check out the link below for more info.
AA10636233	The tassel ran about $5 when you order the cap and gown. Just have a classmate purchase an additional one for you that you pay for.

Talk about a total waste, i wore it once and then stuffed it in the back of my closet, I have not seen it in about 14 years! The tassel either. If you wear a tassel in a different color, I promise you will definitely be noticed, and if it is H.S. then they probably won't let you walk with the wrong color.|`|Dh0JX2Onaa	See if you can just obtain the correct color tassel for graduation./|`|6JXrlnYsaa	The cap and gown are fine.

I ask because when I graduated from Uni many years ago there were different color tassels and they meant different things.|`|PN5wdj9Daa	Old cap and gown is fine but you should splurge for the new tassel.

If there are no other job opportunities for you out there, working for your parents is not a bad option.  If you have opportunity to better yourself financially, you should take advantage of it.  You cannot feel guilty about trying to better your situation.  Your parents should have an understanding of your position  and should be happy for you if you can do better in life.  Perhaps you can still help out occasionally in the family business, but don't feel guilty whichever route you follow.

a8BL5vCMaa	Greg - Hello  Congrats on senior year. Takes me back. Which school is better 4 U depends on what U want and can U afford 2 do it. Whats Ur career goal & what sort of place do U want 2 attend. There are college and career guides that can help you. Its not just about which school is the best. Yahoo has groups that address career and school concerns. For egg sample my 1st college was commuting distance from parents so my frosh year was classes and work part time near by. It was probably the smallest University in MA but was fine. Then my idea was go some place bigger w/ more diversity. Social life was better but it was stressful.
AXiKJDV9aa	HS is irrelevant as far as getting in medical school is concerned.  The issue is preparing you to do well at college so you can get into medical school.  Doing challenging subjects such as AP calculus at HS will best prepare you for that.  Also college is not the best place to do well in a subject like calculus if you have not been exposed to it before.  And yes, most medical schools require calculus and calculus based physics for entrance, so you need it.  They also require english, biology, chemistry and biochemistry.    Thanks  Bill|`|p3JGYWrBaa	You should be concern your college gpa yes but not with your high school. Its commitment!

r1mmYhBQaa	The last IQ test I took placed me at a 140.  I usually range between 135-145 depending on the particular test. :)|`|yYr412Vbaa	i was too much for them, u know how the scales can only go so high?  i just got a paper mailed to me, it read: wicked smart.|`|PN5wdj9Daa	I have tested anywhere from 116 to 141 depending on the test, the time of day and who inside might have been playing around! I'm not smart enough for Mensa and too smart for my own good. I am disabled and live on a low fixed income so some people would question the quality of my life.  I have learned with St. Paul to be content in whatever state I am.  So what is this for?  If you are doing this for experimental psych then it is an unofficial sampling and cannot be verified and is a poor way to begin a paper, hypothesis or theory.  If you want to do this right, get permission to set something up at a local grocery store and/or shopping mall and explain what you are trying to prove, or demonstrate by this sample.  Then you have properly informed participants and a better sample.  Of course you will have to take into consideration the variables that might occur in your setting too.  The socio-economic level of the neighborhood, the time of day, is there a predominate gender.  I have a theory: If the standard adult IQ SD is 16 or 15 and the average is 100 or anywhere from 84 to 116; then people w IQ's below 84 should be expected to have similar qualities of life to those w IQ's above 116.  And the more SD's from the mean, more abnormal that person's quality of life might be.  Why do we expect developmentally delayed children to not do well and give them all sorts of special help but higher IQ children are expected to do very well in life without much help.  What are the socialization factors to be considered?  If 2/3 of the population scores @ 84 to 116 then what should we expect from the other 1/3 or more to the point, 1/2 of 1/3?|`|AA10636233	124 on the test i just took here ===> http://www.highiqsociety.org/iq_tests/ !

Thanks  Bill|`|YTYjzGAXaa	Nope, I am 4/4 with my colleges.|`|fIEP46xIaa	I personally have not (at least yet), but I know people who have been rejected. To make it simple: none of them tried to appeal a decision. While as unfortunate as it is, colleges deny people because they are looking for something different than what that particular applicant has to offer (ie: higher grades, more extracurriculars/community involvement, higher test scores, etc). There really is no reason why the admission officers would change their minds. With that said, it is important to apply to multiple schools: a few fall-back schools, a dream school or two, and maybe some in between schools to ensure admission at least somewhere. If the school you got denied from was a dream school, your best bet is to go to another school you are accepted to and to work really hard to maintain top grades and then transfer in.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	Well, yeah, many people, myself included, have been denied admission to schools we might have liked to attend.

The amount of body paragraphs your paper contains depends on the amount of factors you are going to identify. Explain the factor, the cause of the factor, and site an example of where that factor played out its cause/effect relationship.     An example would be my explanation of animals having emotions:    Animals can be seen to have emotions like humans (the factor) because their reactions are functions of the circumstance and not held to a single consistently delivered response (the effect). This phenomenon is due to the presence of brain development that relays varying responses to given stimulation (cause). I am reminded of this when my dog gives me a confused look for yelling at the TV during sporting events (cause/effect relationship example).    I don't really know if it is proven fact that animals have emotions but I thought the example was funny and illustrates the idea.    Lastly, close off your paper with a conclusion that DOES NOT SAY "In conclusion"! Use something more original and before you close your statement maybe you could present some of the reasons for the stalling to make the apparently needed change in policy.     Hope that helps and good luck!  :-)|`|SftnuLk8aa	A good paper starts with a good thesis. What are you trying to tell your reader? What information do you think is useful? It's a good idea to brain storm before actually writing your paper. Write down major points to help you start. Talk about how factory workers were affected prior to, during and after the implementation of labor unions. Talk about what labor unions were and what their aims were. Remember, you'll want to tie each paragraph with transition sentences, things that make your entire paper flow well. You don't want to jump from one idea to another without giving the reader some way to transition into another aspect of your paper.
awShhMvfaa	It sounds like you have a case of "senior-itis".  You've checked yourself out of school because the end is in sight and you're simply preparing yourself for the next big step.  I went through this as well.  I did great in 10th and 11th grade and once I got to the last 6-8 months, it got REALLY hard to keep going.  I lost interest in school and focused more on what I wanted to do for my career, college, and life in general.      Just keep on pushing and keep in mind that all of your hard work that you've done over the past years will be all for nothing.  Also remember that if you are looking to go to college, bad results in your last year speak a whole lot louder than good results in the years prior.|`|FmYkUfIDaa	Hi Sarah,  Most parents have high expectations for their children and become unhappy when they perceive that their children are not making the effort to do well at school.    By your own admission, you are not working hard and even say 'In fact hardly anywork'! Meaning you are not working.    What if you came home from school, you find your home is in a mess, no meal prepared and your Mom says, "I worked really hard last year and because of that I have now decided to do  hardly any work."    What motivates your Mom and Dad to work?  Answer: They like to behave responsibly, they show their love for their family by doing their best constantly.     Do they expect someone else to motivate them? Absolutely not!    You are not going to school to please your Mom or Dad. You attend school to learn everything that is 'on-offer' so that you will acquire wisdom, knowledge and learning that will provide you with a wonderful foundation for whatever career you choose to follow.    At a Job Interview if you make the kind of excuses you have made in your letter (above) the only type of work you will secure will be lowly paid and every day will be *prescribed for you.    Example: * Prescribed = Your whole day will be timetabled so your supervisor will know what it is you should be doing every hour of the day.    You won't have the freedom to make decisions for yourself as to how you do your work.     At school, do you see the Principal coming into your classrom every few minutes telling your teacher what she must do? Of course not - because she put the effort in to learn enough so that she might select a job she would love to do.    Everything you do in school is an investment in your future, don't mess it up. Do it for you and you will feel very proud of yourself.|`|NYZ8ebD6aa	Family and Friends should be supporting you more, its more motivation when its actually people around you showing you support!

6DFhlt4daa	Idioms: rule of thumb     A rough and useful principle or method, based on experience rather than precisely accurate measures. For example, His work with the youth group is largely by rule of thumb. This expression alludes to making rough estimates of measurements by using one's thumb. [Second half of 1600s]     Rule of thumb refers to shortcuts to solutions to new problems that resemble problems previously solved by experienced workers.     A useful principle having wide application but not intended to be strictly accurate or reliable in every situation.    A rule of thumb is a principle with broad application that is not intended to be strictly accurate or reliable for every situation. It is an easily learned and easily applied procedure for approximately calculating or recalling some value, or for making some determination. Compare this to heuristic, a similar concept used in mathematical discourse, psychology and computer science, particularly in algorithm design.    Origin of the phrase  The earliest citation comes from Sir William Hopes The Compleat Fencing-Master, second edition, 1692, page 157: "What he doth, he doth by rule of thumb, and not by art."[1][2] The term is thought to originate with wood workers who used the length of their thumbs rather than rulers for measuring things, cementing its modern use as an inaccurate, but reliable and convenient standard.[3]    (more......)    http://www.answers.com/Rule%20of%20thumb    1 : a method based on experience and common sense  2 : a general principle that is roughly correct     http://www.wordcentral.com/cgi-bin/stude...    1. a general or approximate principle, procedure, or rule based on experience or practice, as opposed to a specific, scientific calculation or estimate.  2. a rough, practical method of procedure.    http://dictionary.infoplease.com/rule-of...    An old English law declared that a man could not beat his wife with a stick any larger than the diameter of his thumb.    Comment from Lance: When brewing beer, the temperature at which the yeast is added is important. Too cold and the yeast won't work, too hot and it'll die. Before the days of thermometers, a brewer would determine temperature by simply sticking his thumb into the mixture.    Another possibility: As an artist, I always thought that this saying applied to the act of using one's thumb as a judge of scale. You literally use your thumb to act as a ruler to determine the scale of an object in your painting.    Peter wrote: the French word for an inch (puce) is the same as for a thumb. I wonder if the thumb was used as a rough reckoner for inches? Just a thought.    Anthony wrote: this has nothing to do with painting, nor is it anything to do with wife beating, which is just plain old down home American stupidity. It was used by bakers in judging flour, the flour being rubbed between thumb and fingers.     http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~genepo...    http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-rul1...|`|oKvyaIPSaa	That of which there is the most consensus.|`|LEO8nRzkaa	Go watch "Boondock Saints".|`|t7O3Erpvaa	Meaning    A means of estimation made according to a rough and ready practical rule, not based on science or exact measurement.    Origin    This has been said to derive from the belief that English law allowed a man to beat his wife with a stick so long as it is was no thicker than his thumb. In 1782 Judge Sir Francis Buller is reported as having made this legal ruling.|`|uZDFVXF3aa	Don't know where I heard this, but Rule of Thumb originated many, many years ago when it was legal for a husband to beat his wife -- but only with a stick or switch no bigger around than his thumb.

uC75y83Taa	"I'm sorry for disturbing you, but I have to ask you a question."    "I apologize for disturbing you, but I have to ask you a question."    "This news is going to disturb you."    Those are all correct.  It's one of those complicated English words! :)|`|Bx7F9jscaa	"to disturb" is an infinitive, which is incorrect in this case. It would be more correct to say "I'm sorry that I disturbed you."|`|5eoO6qosaa	I'm sorry to disturb you.

You cannot apologize for something you have not yet done.  "To disturb you" suggests one has yet to be disturbed, such as "I will turn the TV down in order not to disturb you."|`|AA12308238	As it reads now, it's as though the person to whom  you are apologizing finds apologies disturbing and you are deliberately trying to disturb the person by apologizing. Like, if you found my singing annoying and I was purposely trying to annoy you, I would tell you that "I sing to disturb you."    The problem lies in combining "apologize" with the infinitive "to disturb". What you should say is, "I am sorry to disturb you" or "I apologize for disturbing you."|`|69GgJhnWaa	The correct way to say it would be I apologize for disturbing you, I apologize for the disturbance or I apologize for interrupting.  Mainly, apologize is not in the correct tense for the sentence you're attempting to create or you're using the wrong adverb (I think? Basically, the incorrect grammar is due to apologize or the to) after apologize, depending on which sentence option you choose.
jQjhIJzHaa	f'(x)=x^3    Integrating gives you f(x)=(1/4)*x^4+C.    We have to find the constant of integration, C.    A tangent line has two important properties.  1. It shares the tangent point with the function, f(x)  2. At the tangent point its slope is equal to the derivative of the function.      We know that the tangent line is y=-x  This means that it has a slope of -1    At the tangent point the slope of the tangent line is equal to the derivative.  So we get  f'(x)=x^3  -1=x^3  or x=-1    Substituting it into the equation of the tangent line, we get  and y=+1    So the tangent point is (-1,1)    Our function  f(x)=(1/4)*x^4+C passes through the tangent point as well.  So we substitute the co-ordinates of the tangent point (-1,1) into what we know of f(x).    f(-1)=1=(1/4)*(-1)^4+C  1=1/4+C  C=3/4    So our function is  f(x)=(1/4)*x^4+3/4

I don't know if it's common in the US, but in Canada most universities either have no such requirements, or require that you take a few arts electives (usually about 4). At my university (University of Waterloo) for example, a physics major is only required to take physics, math, and 2 chemistry or other science courses. They also have to write an "English Proficiency Exam" if they didn't get 80% (A) in their Grade 12 English course in the first few weeks of class. If they fail that they have to take 1 English course, but that's it.

If you go to the school I recommend, Cal-tech, then you will do virtually nothing but math and physics if you wish - they have very little humanities requirements:  http://www.caltech.edu/    Caltech is a bit of a loner in that regard - most other schools will make you take the rubbish you suggest.

It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do.    It is more important than appearance, gifted-ness or skill. It will make or break a company . . . a church . . . a home.     The remarkable thing is, we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day.    We cannot change our past. We can not change the fact that people act in a certain way. We can not change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude.

If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.    To find what you seek in the road of life,  the best proverb of all is that which says:  "Leave no stone unturned."    Do we not all agree to call rapid thought and noble impulse by the name of inspiration?    If you can imagine it, you can achieve it; if you can dream it, you can become it.    If you would create something,  you must be something.    Every artist was first an amateur.    No great man ever complains of want of opportunities.    Men do less than they ought,  unless they do all they can.    Let thy words be few.      Happy are those who dream dreams and are ready to pay the price to make them come true.    The power of imagination makes us infinite.    First say to yourself what you would be;  and then do what you have to do.

But remember this takes some time, dedication, patience and regular practice and anyone can benefit. How less or more confidence build in you totally depends on yourself.  Confidence to do a work generally means strong feeling from the inner part of your heart and mind that you can do that work easily and you do not even think of any failure or unsuccess while doing that work. If you've confidence, then you can do anything easily than you thought before doing that work or any action. What I think is thinking that you can do what you are doing or going to do, having positive looking to that action, well planning, start and believing that you are confident to do what you are going to do is 50% of that work already done. This concept is quite unbelievable and unacceptable for the beginners but it is true for who have done.   Do not make unnecessary comparison with others. Understand the fact that this world is very much diverse in different aspects and you are different and unique from others in thousands of ways. So why to be worried thinking for example that you couldn't become pilot as your close competitor friend? You may have ability to draw good picture, sing very well and many more. What would be situation of this world if everyone of this world worried thinking one doesn't have the ability, quality or thing that the others have? Rather try to find out what special ability or quality you have that other don't and follow and work accordingly.  We all are given many special qualities by God. Only our defect is either inability or careless to find those qualities. One fact that we have to keep in mind is why some of our ancestors or those people who lived in past history were scientists, others doctors, singers and many more? Why did they all not become only scientists, or doctors or singers? Because they had different qualities, abilities of their own. So be a person of your own.    Even a very good runner who used to be always first in past can not become first if s/he have thinking that s/he will not be winner.This simple thinking weakens his muscle and whole body, inner power, confidence and finally results turns same one thought before in the beginning. In such case your belief about what you are doing and who you are play as much role as your skills, your way of doing that work. Positive thinking that you will win and should win makes you confident to do that work.    Everyone needs to have good self confidence. This is something that a lot of people do not have enough of. So let's look at ways of building your self confidence if you are in this situation.    You can work at being able to feel good when you want. You may have to boost your self confidence at times, so that you can feel good about the way that you look and feel.    These boosters should be good things that help you feel good about certain things in your life. You may want to think of memories from past times that make you feel good inside. These may help you feel better when you are feeling down.    You may also want to talk to some friends or see some family members that are special to you. Any time that you make time to see some of the smiling faces that make you feel good, it will build up your self confidence and get you back on track. You may want to do these things as often as you can so that you are building your self confidence  If you are feeling a little bit self conscious, you may want to find ways to make yourself feel better. It is very important that you are taking care of your mental state so that you are feeling the way that you need to be. You will want to feel comfortable with yourself in order to do well in life.    It is too easy to let your self confidence go and you will want to make sure that you are getting it back, or building it up. Don't let this slide.    You want to do what is necessary so that you are able to be happy, healthy and have high self esteem. When you are building up your self confidence, you will be taking a lot of pressure off of your mind and body so that you are able to feel your best all the time. Things will bother you a lot less. So work on your self confidence, and move ahead!|`|uC75y83Taa	Walk tall, be pleasant, you be the first to say "hi" to people, and be kind.

be5NSs0Maa	This is a good book! ...if you can keep track of the plot...    1) Aunt Alexandra, like many people of this time, were concerned a lot with the family's image. It seems her sole purpose for being there is to teach Jem and Scout how to behave in ways that would make others think they were well-mannered and disciplined. She often becomes frustrated because they both see little use in trying to please other people, for sake of their "image."    2) Jem yelled out that the telephone was ringing to break up the tension cause by the group's conversation. Tom Robinson's life was in question, something Jem didn't understand from what he overheard. As far as them jumping and trying to scatter, they actually more or less laughed while they were walking away. This is possibly due to them realizing that they were getting themselves riled up. When Atticus got closer to them, they all hurdled together, as if to keep something secretive, and that's when Jem "screamed" out. They were startled.    Hope this clears something up.... :)

According to the dictionary in my hands, a compound word is "a word composed of two or more words joined with a hyphen or written in solid form, as 'fly-by-night' or 'shoestring'."    So I guess it all depends on how the word is written; I've seen it written acceptably as "point-blank", "pointblank", AND "point blank"... so in the way you've written it in your question, the answer is--again, according to this particular dictionary, anyway--definitely yes!    Hope you won the bet. :)

Usually what killed me in high school wasnt the classes themselves, but the extracurriculars. I did theater, and i was at school till 9 many nights, then had to do my homework. So perhaps you just want to do one band, then again if thats what comes easy to you, then keep the bands and change something else. I feel like that would have been an ok schedule for me. But it just depends.

4A2IxqI6aa	Yes.  It's not a sentence, but it's a well-formed noun phrase.    Edit: There seems to be some confusion about whether "electric" is being used correctly.  It is.    As others suggest, you could use the adjective "electrical" as a modifier.  You could also use the noun "electricity" as a modifier.    Neither of these are more correct than using the noun "electric" as a modifier to "needs."  "Electric needs" are your needs for electrics, or things that are electric.    It could be pointed out that this use of the word "electric" tends to be more British than American.|`|AA10418744	yes, it's correct. it is a phrase not a sentence. electric is describing what kind of need. Need is a noun and electric is an adjective. When you want to buy your electric needs, you should go to the electronics section of a department store. You can find there all your electric needs.|`|bEGrmfJhaa	all your electrical needs|`|5c6671e8f478958f34681c2f7e863dc2aa	or "all your electrical needs" would work as well.|`|AA12308238	No, it should be "all your electricity needs".

AA10023710	A PhD is what you'd do if you wanted to do research and become an academic - a professor. A DBA is a newer degree, and it will not qualify you to become a professor. It's designed for people who want to study doctoral-level business concepts, but apply their knowledge to their corporate working lives, not to academia.     There are few-to-no reputable online PhD business or DBA programs. In fact, to my knowledge, there are *no* reputable online PhD programs in business. If your goal is academia, an online PhD would not get you a job.     I think I remember a few low residency DBA programs. My memory is not clear on the particular programs, but I think Case Western U offers one, as does, maybe, Thunderbird? U Manchester, in the UK, certainly has one. There are also part-time DBA programs, such as the one at Harvard. You may have to dig a bit to find ones that fit your lifestyle.

I thought - what a great idea to stop the problems before they become something much worse. However, the sad truth is that most people don't get to a psychologist on a regular basis (enough to really make an impact) until they are an adult. So most psychologists interested in child psychology ended up focusing on family psychology so that they will continue to make money and reach a broader group.  I was told it would be very hard to make a living on child psychology alone and to try becoming a school counselor if that was my only passion as you will always deal with children there.  Still not great pay though.     To become a practicing psychologist of any kind you have to get your bachelors at the very least, and some times your masters in psychology. So course suggestions won't be helpful to you.  You should contact Colleges in your areas for College course outlines so you know exactly what classes have to be taken to proceed with your goal.      Good Luck to you!

But there must be a mistake somewhere. It's just not possible to multiply a 3 digit number and a 2 digit number and get a 3 digit number. Look at it this way. The smallest 3 digit number is 100. The smallest 2 digit number is 10. 100 x 10 = 1,000. 1,000 is a 4 digit number and that's the smallest possible product of a 3 digit number and a 2 digit number. So my best guess is your teacher wrote the problem incorrectly.

d35359baf6d78a22be5f24f3f6e0fab7aa	People experimented with plastics based on natural polymers for centuries. In the nineteenth century they discovered plastics based on chemically modified natural polymers: Charles Goodyear discovered vulcanization of rubber (1839) and Alexander Parkes, English inventor (18131890) created the earliest form of plastic in 1855. He mixed pyroxylin, a partially nitrated form of cellulose (cellulose is the major component of plant cell walls), with alcohol and camphor. This produced a hard but flexible transparent material, which he called "Parkesine." The first plastic based on a synthetic polymer was made from phenol and formaldehyde, with the first viable and cheap synthesis methods invented by Leo Hendrik Baekeland in 1909, the product being known as Bakelite. Subsequently poly(vinyl chloride), polystyrene, polyethylene (polyethene), polypropylene (polypropene), polyamides (nylons), polyesters, acrylics, silicones, polyurethanes were amongst the many varieties of plastics developed and have great commercial success.|`|Fnp2MIycaa	The first truly synthetic plastic was invented by Leo Baekeland - a Belgium chemist living in New York.

A notable scientist and engineer, he is often referred to as the Missile Man of India for his work and is considered a leading progressive, mentor, innovator and visionary in India.    Kalam observes strict personal discipline, practicing vegetarianism, teetotalism and celibacy. Kalam is a scholar of Tirukkural; in most of his speeches, he quotes at least one kural. Kalam has written several inspirational books, most notably his autobiography Wings of Fire, aimed at motivating Indian youth. Another of his books, Guiding Souls: Dialogues on the Purpose of Life reveals his spiritual side. It has been reported that there is considerable demand in South Korea for translated versions of books authored by him.[4].Abdul Kalam and Sujatha in St.Joseph's College photo|`|AA12395591	Abul Pakir Jainulbadeen Abdul Kalam ( born October 15, 1931, Tamil Nadu, India, usually referred to as Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam ^) is the current President of India. A notable scientist and engineer, he is often referred to as the Missile Man of India for his work and is considered a leading progressive, mentor, innovator and visionary in India.Honors  Kalam has received honorary doctorates from thirty universities[2], as well as recipient of India's three highest civilian honours in order: the Padma Bhushan in 1981; the Padma Vibhushan in 1990; and the Bharat Ratna in 1997.    Kalam is the first President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna before being elected to the highest office. He is also the first scientist and first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan. He also has the distinction of being the third apolitical figure in the republic's history, to become President of India.[3]      Political views  Kalam's probable views on certain issues have been espoused by him in his book "India 2020" where he strongly advocates an action plan to develop India into a knowledge superpower and into a developed nation by the year 2020. Kalam is credited with the view that India ought to take a more assertive stance in international relations; he regards his work on India's nuclear weapons program as a way to assert India's place as a future superpower.    Kalam continues to take an active interest in other developments in the field of science and technology as well. He has proposed a research programme for developing bio-implants. He is a supporter of Open source software over proprietary solutions and believes that the use of open source software on a large scale will bring more people the benefits of information technology.    Kalam's belief in the power of science to resolve society's problems and his views of these problems as a result of inefficient distribution of resources is modernistic. He also sees science and technology as ideology-free areas and emphasizes the cultivation of scientific temper and entrepreneurial drive. In this, he finds a lot of support among India's new business leaders like the founders of Infosys and Wipro, (leading Indian IT corporations) who began their careers as technology professionals much in the same way Kalam did.       The President loves interacting with children. Here he is seen on the left talking with the exam toppers of La Martiniere Lucknow, picture taken by Ujjwal Krishna, who also went to meet Kalam with the other LMC 2005 toppers  Personal life  Kalam observes strict personal discipline, practicing vegetarianism, teetotalism and celibacy. Kalam is a scholar of Tirukkural; in most of his speeches, he quotes at least one kural. Kalam has written several inspirational books, most notably his autobiography Wings of Fire, aimed at motivating Indian youth.

If you're having problems with losing your place (that happens to me), make a mark every 3 digits or so.    On the other hand, it'd be really easy to write Javascript to do this, then you could save that on your computer, and count digits without having to be connected to the internet (and it'd give you a chance to learn something new).|`|AA10121464	http://ostermiller.org/calc/calculator.h...

You can then split 12 into 4 x 3 under the square root sign.  You can take the square root of 4 and bring that 2 out, multiply it to the other 2 and you get 4.  So your answer is 4/(pretend again) 3

MAZQhOMjaa	I think this refers to people realising their own ability to be able to lift themselves up out of trouble and recognising their own strength.  Too often people place blame on others without seeing how much power they themselves have.

You can also find exam questions and exemplars (http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/ncea/index.html) for the sake of preparation.    Be warned, mid-term and mock exams are often easy in comparison to actual exams.    But if you study and revise and practice, practice, practice, you'll be fine.

ORonhAuvaa	In reality, you would never have gotten into the situation at all if you had not been absent so much, so you have to take responsibility for what happened.     Personally, as a teacher, I would try to keep my students apprised of where they stand, but you also have to realize, many teachers see between 150-200 kids each day. That is a bookkeeping nightmare and very difficult to do. Meanwhile, when you are getting homework and classwork from 175 kids each day, you have one kid who is trying to make up missed work. It can be impossible. Better to keep yourself out of that situation and then you won't have anyone to be mad at.     What bothers me is that you have been holding on to this for two years. Let it go and get on with your life. When you are thirty, this will be but a blip on the radar screen of life.

NaCl: Na (Sodium) has 1 atom Cl (Chlorine) has 1 atom so the total is 2    Note when there are numbers following it tells you how many atoms there are, if there aren't any numbers following the element then it just has 1.

Qvx5iG9uaa	First, you want to think about why your parents would say no, then come up with solutions. Here are some examples:    Parent: I work all day, and so does your Dad. We don't have time to teach you at home.  You: I'm old enough now that I don't really need you to teach me 1 on 1. I can work by myself while you're at work and can even grade my own work once you get home so you just need to supervise the grading for half an hour.     Parent: Home-schooling is expensive. We don't have that kind of extra money.  You: I found a good curriculum on sale on Ebay (or other site) so it isn't too expensive. Besides, you'd be saving money by not paying for school lunches, field trips, and stuff.    Parent: What about your friends? You would miss them and end up being isolated.  You: I can still hang out with my friends after school like I do now. Its not like we get to spend a lot of time together at school anyway except for the lunch hour.    Parent: I don't really want you at home alone for so long every day without supervision. (They are thinking- OMG the trouble she can get into!)  You: I'm going to be busy with my schoolwork and my friends will be in school. I won't have anyone over during school hours, and can even go to the library (take the bus) during the day sometimes if you want. Your rules about friends over after school would be the same as now.    Here are some tips for you about curriculum:    If your family is Christian, check out Alpha Omega. It is a curriculum that needs minimal to no input from parents if you are able to work independently. Each subject comes with 10 workbooks for the year and can easily be done in half a year. The average cost for each subject is $50. for the year. For math I recommend ALEKS. This is an online program that tracks your progress and explains everything.    Good luck!|`|1SnI86BIaa	i also want to add the you most likely dont have ADD    and the 'sleeping problem', thats from stress cause you hate school so much|`|r18PoGJiaa	I highly doubt you have ADD. You are just a normal teen who despises school. You are not alone.   I pulled my daughter out this semester because of some serious problems going on in her school and after repeated attempts of going to the School Board about it, nothing was being done to rectify it. She is doing so much better I should say.  Have you spoken to your parents about this? Let them know if this is a good option for you. You have to also take in consideration that both your parents work a 9-5 job and it may be something that theycan't understandably handle.   Another thing to think about. Cost  Are you wanting to actually home school or just take online courses through a charter school? There is a difference.  Charter schools usually don't cost anything (that is what my daughter is doing now) and then you have home schooling sites where you actually have to buy your own curriculum  which can actually cost a fortune. (on my budget anyway)  Sit down with your parents. Tell them that school just isn't working out with you and you want to be home schooled the rest of this semester.   It would be a good idea before doing so that you research some home schooling sites, and show them what you found.   Hope everything works out :)|`|AA10817491	I have ADD and I am home schooled. I've done both.  if you have ADD be put on something to help you concentrate.

I watched dvds last year and I liked that and I have friends who do online and they like that.|`|rTLp1ZGQaa	Maybe you should have a meeting with your parents, counselor, or principle.  N tell them what you said here.  You could probably get a tutor, if your school has those kinds of things.  Like a teacher coming to your house for like 2 and a half hours, twice each week, or something like that.   On the other days they don't come, you do your homework that they gave you.   And you could ask for more work if you think its not enough to keep you busy.  I hate hate hate school too and I would usually never go but now I have a tutor.  She comes here on Tuesday and Thursday, 12:00-2:30pm.  And my grades are fine. I think.  Maybe that'll work for you too.  Good luck.|`|4Dn7JRFWaa	talk to your parents and tell them how you feel, You need to see a Dr if you think you  do have that|`|8OTgqw28aa	Hello, I wanted to tell you that your parents will say no and on the bright side look im in year 8 and am forced to study i hate it but i still do imagine when you do your HSE and get a really high mark you will get a really good job and alot of money so you can buy a ferrari a porch a massive house in hollywood and yeah put some confidence in yourself and when you look for a wife she will want a well educated husband eg a garbage man or a cleaner she will not want that sort of man but a doctor or a lawyer or engineer or anything like that you will be really wanted by many girls i hope this helped you please let me know if it didnt (chris_f_100@hotmail.com)|`|oZ39bLSkaa	The best thing you can do is have a good attitude when you speak to your parents. Like the previous poster mentioned, you need to address the concerns your parents are likely to have. Why do you hate school so much? Can anything else be done about your issue?    Beware that you are quite young to be home alone doing your school work. It may start off okay but it will be a long difficult road to do it alone. You will need accountability and encouragement. You would definitely have to have something of that sort set up for you wither witha  tutor or your parents.    I trust your parents have your best interest in mind. If after voicing all your concerns(I assume there is a specific reason you have missed 6 days of school this month), your parents still think school is your best option, try to make the best of it. By all means ask them to help you resolve the issue of why you hate school so much. Also talk to your teachers, get them on your side. Most teachers are willing to go the extra mile with a  student who shows genuine interest and effort in her studies.    All the best as you sort this out.

"we all have our own idiosyncratic gestures"; "Michelangelo's highly idiosyncratic style of painting"    Idiosyncrasy defined the way physicians conceived diseases in the nineteenth century. They considered each disease as a unique condition, related to each patient. This understanding began to change in the 1870s, when discoveries made by researchers in Europe permitted the advent of a 'scientific medicine', a precursor to the Evidence-Based Medicine that is the standard of practice today.|`|wppCSDHNaa	something related to some langauge which i dont know.|`|biFCKGAcaa	Idiosyncrasy, from Greek ?, idiosunkrasia, "a peculiar temperament", "habit of body" (idios "one's own" and syn-krasis "mixture") is defined as an individualizing quality or characteristic of a person or group, and is often used to express eccentricity or peculiarity. The term can also be applied to symbols. Idiosyncratic symbols mean one thing for a particular person, as a blade could mean war, but to someone else, it could symbolize a surgery. By the same principle, linguists state that words are not only arbitrary, but also largely idiosyncratic signs.    Etymology of the word IDIOSYNCRATIC -  First attested in 1604, in modern sense since 1665, from Old French idiosyncrasie     So,idiosyncrasy (plural idiosyncrasies) or IDIOSYNCRATIC INDIVIDUAL mean -     A persons with -  -A way of behaving or thinking that is characteristic of a person. or   -A language or behaviour that is particular to an individual or group.   (medicine) A peculiar individual reaction to a generally innocuous substance or factor. or   -A peculiarity that serves to distinguish or identify.

During the summer when it is nice and warm you can plant, water, fertilize, all that stuff without too much difficulty as long as you give everything attention..... FALL time is the time to graft, prune, plow and spread mulch, etc. etc. and catch up on all those annoying weeds you didn't get to during the warmer months....

This is what tells plants when to bloom.  There are two types of plants: short-day and long-day.  Short-day plants, like poinsettas, flower later in the year when nights grow longer (fewer hours of daylight) while long-day plants, flower when nights grow shorter (spring and early summer).  It's actually the length of the night, not the day, that tells plants to flower.  Long-day will not flower if the recieve more than a certain amount of darkness each day.  You can trick them into flowering by flashing a light in the middle of the night to interupt the period of darkness.  (Insted of 10h, they get 5 and 5)  Florists often do this if they want a flower to bloom out of season.  Short-day plants are the opposite and need a certain amount of uninterupted darkness each day to bloom.

j6jQ4Cq1aa	umm.. lets see. U have to start with a thesis statement and you have to capture the audience by adding a quote or two to ur essay so that it may seem like you're connecting the past
wipJ9OE7aa	I think that some of the best majors to consider right now are:    Education- there is always going to be a need to teachers, and if you teach in a low income area, your loans could be forgiven based on the amount of time you spend teaching in particular areas. There's also a high need for special education teachers.     Social Work- as long as there's social service agencies, there's going to be a need for social workers. They work and advocate on behalf of children, the elderly. There's so many other areas that this field could lead to - such as counseling, school psychology, the administrative aspect, etc.,    Health Care Industry- There is a high need for nurses.    I also think that hospitality is decent- but in specific areas, not all around.    I strongely suggest that you look in the employment section of your newspaper and see what's high in demand, just to get an idea of what's hot.|`|6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	First off, "green jobs" is just gibberish political positioning so ignore that.  Good majors:    - Engineering (any).  Engineers in all fields are always needed and it's all high paying.  Even if you are layed off, you can find a great new job in quick time as you have a real specialized skill that most of the rest of the unemployed population does not.    - Nursing.  Health care isn't seeing any less demand, and supply of nurses hasn't kept pace.  High paying, easy 50k right out of college (any college, not just elite ones) with no experience.    - Other allied health majors.  This includes physical therapists, social workers, hygienists, med techs, etc.  Guaranteed to be hired anywhere.    - Accounting.  Accounting is the best position in the business trades.  One of the few business areas where zero experience still gets you a job even right now 45k/year with super strong career ladder potential; in 10 years of experience you have a real capacity to be making twice that easily.  Accountants always needed; increased bureaucracy for the future ensures that even more accountants will be needed.    - Education (secondary and primary).  Many diss this field as low paying but actually it pays quite well when you consider benefits and hours worked (9 month schedule), plus no fear of ever losing your job unless you totally screw up.    - Computer Science/ IT - takes some talent but if you got what it takes you can have a rewarding career in these areas.  Tech jobs are always available everywhere and at anytime.
uE38Phx4aa	hey!  i'm doing a bachelor of communication and cultural studies and media and information and its supposed to be a 'full time' course and yet i only have 14 contact hours  im wondering how much hw i should expect to be getting if thats all im doing at uni but i think i'll still have time easy to handle a job (or 2 in my situation).  But if you're unsure, do a week or two at uni before getting a job and see how the work load is, then apply as u feel suitable.  best of luck and have fun if your course! :)|`|AA12074269	It depends on your course - there is usually a limit to the time you can take to finish a subject and for a Bachelors its often a little under double the full time - for instance - if full time is 4 years - you can take 7 years part time to finish the degree. This depends on the university.   Full time is 75% or more course load. This usually gives you the student discount card for public transport etc. Any less than 75% and you loose this in many states. The number of hours/days you need to attend depends on the subjects - some subjects have 3-4 contact hours a week other 10-12. A 50% course load will generally be 2 subjects a semester-so it will depend on what you choose.|`|ITnQEUQTaa	A full time load is 4 units but sometimes you can do only 3 and still be considered full time.    Part-time is doing 1 or 2 units per semester.|`|576a5e5060bb09bd6c667591037775e8aa	Depends on the course but normally 25 or less hours as long as you are enrolled in the minimum units for the semester.  I would ring the faculty and ask them what is considered part time the office staff in most faculties are normally helpful.|`|7Oc1bLnGaa	You won't need to study as much with the bachelor that you've chosen.  Probably at Uni about 25 hours per week and a further 15 hours outside of Uni.  Get a call centre role that is flexible and stays open from very early to late - that's how I got through Uni.|`|AA10745645	3 or 4 units is full time, 1 or 2 units is part time which is usually equivelant to 3 or 6 hours per week.|`|eb571cf769ed215aab1d1d63d662877baa	Congrats on a uni spot. That's fun yet heavy course. I don't envy you. Lots of burn the 'midnight oil' days for you & your study buddies. In reality most students do their reports etc during the weekends & no contact times. Holidays - no such thing till after the Nov. exams. You can do summer school to fast track or catch up on some units.I recall dicussion sector scores big marks if done well. Sorry they'll be very limitted time to go clubbing much less hold down a part time job. Yes on paper it be 40 hour week for full time studest at 3-4 units per semester. Realirty double that to fit all your set 'homework' excluding 'study' time. Work it out with centerlink & your family on what best covers your daily socioeconomic needs. The faster you get a degree the sooner you'd be employed in your chosen profession. Maybe a pay as you learn mode be a better soluion for you.The only reliable industry for such a mode be in the aarm forces or the govt eg customs.    Technically depends on each class per unit. For example I had 3 hour seminars per unit per week. I did 3-4 units per semester.  Others had lectures & tutorials those can range from hour to whatever the session needs. Online units up to you. Best tip be very organized - work, rest & play.     Control the mess in your room/study zone. I put all books,notes etc in a 40 odd liter no lid plastic box. I used 1 box per unit (color coordinated). In your line of study get a reliable PC. You'd need to look up & use lots of business e- journals. On av for 1st years 10 papers per assignment. Proper referencing  (in text & out text) & write ups for each report, assignment & project goes a long way(eg. no 'I' in your paperwork - abide by the handbook rules - see learning adviser ).BTW endnote is more valuable for post-grad & above students.Do use the faculty learning adviser. S/he can sort out most faults in your work.Go from a c grade to an A or A to A+ grade if you make the right adjustments for layout etc.    Good luck.|`|k7lfgW8Taa	anything less than 18cp is considered part time.

The use of computers for the production of mailing lists has caused the comma to fall into disuse in addresses.

While these can be reinserted when printed, most IT take the easy road of leaving them out.|`|hQEpKwtPaa	no|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	no|`|zeZtFbGjaa	Depends, a comma after a number is the old way, but rarely used now because most letters are typed or mail merged|`|7i6qj4OXaa	It used to be the way in the past.  I am in my sixties.  However, the typed letter has influenced the style now and a comma used to be used even in typed letters.  The style then changed to 'open punctuation' and typed letters these days are usually produced without any punctuation in the address and no indentations for paragraphs.  I think it is just a matter of choice now.|`|YZpHkztAaa	no|`|H03IxOBTaa	Not really no !|`|AA11220909	NO - the equipment the Royal Mail use can not tell the difference between a comma and the number 1.

sOZoonICaa	When i was at school i was one of those children that liked to be the centre of attention but that was a different case in one teachers class mr marlow he would tell us that if we didn't want to learn then he didn't want us in his class and would send us out it was our choice which was fun for about 2 lessons but became very boring as sitting on your own isn't  fun this teacher had the respect he should have had from all of his students as he was very upfront and didn't allow any student to disrupt his class before we were even seated.|`|qu2jJXsWaa	The best way to get the attention of the class is to shout loud if they don't listen to the first verbal warning and if they don't obey this then send them outside and tell them that there behavior is not except able but if this doesn't work then send them to remove (detention or they have to sit at the front of the class never at the back they will get more distracted for e.g throwing stuff or talking to people).If a kid is good reward them with a credit or a star or another reward or you can start a reward system this is very good to make sure children try there best and they do there best to get rewards.or oder silence in each lesson and keep them in at break if this doesn't work.

89ZS7Exgaa	You described this as a "make it or break it year." Given that, it seems that it would be rather risky to change horses during this stage of the race given what is at stake and given the scenario you described. So, based on what you said, I don't think you are being selfish at all for wanting to stay at your old school. However, keep in mind that we can't always have what we want...nonetheless I hope you are able to make your own choice in this situation and that you make the right choice...with your parents' guidance, of course. -Rich|`|eIIbMOusaa	No you're not.    You know what you want, and you want to accomplish that.  That's good, knowing which choice will be more suitable for you.  You know you will do better in your old school, so be it!  You go to school to learn, then pass exams,etc, then move to a higher level. If you can't pass exams, what are you learning?    Hope you will be alright :D|`|0ZxYrtv0aa	I don't think you're being selfish. Just explain to your parents that at such a crucial time of your schooling you think it would be beneficial to go back to your old school.     I'm sure that if you explain yourself they'll want the best for you.    Good luck! :)|`|OB2a2BZdaa	no ur not being selfish and if u think that going back will help then try and persuade ur rents that it will b the best thing 4 u and ur education.|`|FP4Ati8uaa	no i dont think you're being selfish. if you feel more comfortable at your old school I reckon you should go back. How long have you been at your new school? Maybe you're not used to it yet. Give it sometime and if you still think you don't like your new school then go back. Can I ask you something? Did you know anyone at your new school before you started there? Do you have any friends there now? I'm in high school myself and changing schools soon. Please send me an email if you can. Thanks heaps|`|zMZm3fBAaa	you have spent a long time in this new school and tried to like it but it hasn't worked. try to go back to your old school because education is really important and you don't want to work in McDonald's for the rest of your life.

Try this site out, it is PRETTY good, but not perfect, you just have to click on which format you are using and enter the info.    http://citationmachine.net/|`|AA12151161	Hope the following helps:    http://teenlink.nypl.org/bibliography.ht...    Suggest you bookmark it.|`|RcHO6d3Eaa	Depends what subject you're writing in and what referencing style you're using, but generally you need to let people know where to look (ie the URL) and when you looked at it, so something like:    [The organisation or author], [the title of the report or table or whatever you're using], [Full URL] Accessed [the date you accessed it]    You also need to make a reference to it from the text, and that depends on what you're citing it for -- An example would be: "42% of footballers are left-handed (Fifa, 2009)..."     Then the reference in your reference list:  Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), Report on Handedness of Footballers, January 2009. www......, Accessed: 31 January, 2009.    (note: I made all that up, it's just an example). Not sure why I wrote all that, I'm sure it's all available from one of the links people gave you above.     Generally, though, make sure that the information is available so that the person reading your work knows what you looked at -- it's really annoying to have to search for the reference to something, and you probably don't want to annoy the person reading your work too much.    Right, you're using MLA:    Author/editor, initials (If Known). Title date of publication (if available) full address of site (Date of access).     e.g.:  Smith, G. Evaluating Information Sources. 2000. http://www.northampton.ac.uk/lrs/evalcon... (9 Dec 2002)    The Accessed date is the date on which you viewed or downloaded the document.  It may be subject to changes or updating and this allows for this possibility.  Keeping a record of the document as you used it (if permissible) is recommended.    Often organisations put information on the Internet without citing a specific author.  In these cases ascribe authorship to the smallest identifiable organisational unit

cMZEmpp0aa	The one most like the real test is the official College Board guide (I think they still make the "10 Real SATs" books). I don't know that it's the hardest, but if you want the most accurate idea of what the test will really be like, I wouldn't bother using the books by other companies. I tried using a non-College Board book to study for an AP test once and it was terrible because the questions turned out to be nothing like the questions on the actual AP exam. On the other hand, the "10 Real SATs" book is exactly what it sounds like -- a collection of actual SATs that have really been given to real SAT takers in the past 10-15 years or so. I suggest getting that book or whatever the College Board is using in its place these days. Glance through it a bit, but don't worry about diving into it right away. See what kinds of math and English you need for the exam and spend some time studying. Then start working through the tests, preferably while timing yourself just as you would be timed in the actual exam. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper and check them at the end of the test. The book should have some kind of formula for you to calculate your approximate score if you had been taking the test for real (I always found these to be a pretty accurate indicator of my score when I actually took the test -- my real score always fell somewhere between my lowest and highest scores on the practice tests). Them make sure you take the time to review the questions you got wrong before doing the next practice test.

shVgCizBaa	These links might help you------------------------- There are "two sorts of truth," Niels Bohr wrote, "trivialities, where opposites are obviously absurd, and profound truths, recognized by the fact that the opposite is also a profound truth."(1) Are Neo Rauchs pictures of Germany trivially or profoundly true? Is Rauch a true dialectician, "living with live opposites," or is he indulging in nihilistic absurdity? Does he picture the German Geist of Yesterday or the German Geist of Today? Does he represent or misrepresent Germany? Rauchs works are allegories of German history, but is their ironical pessimism its whole story? These questions haunt Neo Rauchs art, enriching its significance.http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/feature...  The opposite of a fact is falsehood, but the opposite of one profound truth may very well be another profound truth. There are trivial truths and the great truths. The opposite of a trivial truth is plainly false. The opposite of a great truth is also true.     The opposite of a correct statement is a false statement. But the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth.     The opposite of a fact is falsehood, but the opposite of one profound truth may very well be another profound truth."

The truthfullness of opposites in the abstract might be a corollary of this kind of thinking.

Yesterday we covered the dog eaters from the World's Fair, but today we'll go back before the fair, to 1876. That's when, according to the 1937 History of Cheltenham and St. James Parish penned by the Rev. P.J. O'Connor, the area got its name "from squatters who built shacks in the neighborhood of Graham and West Park after they were evicted from Forest Park." And that's the extent of what this extensive volume on the area had to say about Dogtown. But we've unearthed yet another source for the name Dogtown, which goes back to the 1890s.

It is obvious that plants (or animals) accidentally or deliberately imported by people from faraway places are not native, but it is more difficult to determine whether plants in a general region or state are native to a particular site.    There are many definitions for native plants that differ in minor ways. We here adopt and discuss the definition recently developed for the Native Plant Conservation Initiative: A native plant species is one "that occurs naturally in a particular region, state, ecosystem, and habitat without direct or indirect human actions" (Federal Native Plant Conservation Committee, 1994). Most native plants have been in the same area for centuries or longer. However, natural spread and dispersal of species (without human intervention) continues to occur, occasionally leading to an expansion of a species' natural geographical range.    not so sure what is the native plants there,though..
AA11376316	Here you go:    Pfeifer  Teal Pfeifer  Professor Rashad  English 102  April 13, 2003  Devastating Beauty  Collarbones, hipbones, cheekbone--so many bones. She looks at the camera with  sunken eyes, smiling, acting beautiful. Her dress is Versace, or Gucci, or Dior, and it is  revealing, revealing every bone and joint in her thin, thin body. She looks fragile and  beautiful, as if I could snap her in two. I look at her and feel the soft cushion of flesh that  surrounds my own joints, my own shoulders and hips that are broad, my own ribs  surrounded by skin and muscle and fat. I am not nearly as fragile or graceful or thin. I  look away and wonder what kind of self-discipline it takes to become beautiful like the  model in my magazine.  By age seventeen a young woman has seen an average of 250,000 ads featuring a  severely underweight woman whose body type is, for the most part, unattainable by any  means, including extreme ones such as anorexia, bulimia, and drug use, according to  Allison LaVoie (par. 4). The media promote clothing, cigarettes, fragrances, and even  food with images like these. In a culture that has become increasingly visual, the images  put out for public consumption feature women that are a smaller size than ever before. In  1950, the White Rock Mineral Water girl was 5???4?? tall and weighed 140 pounds; now she  is 5???10?? tall and weighs only 110 pounds, signifying the growing deviation between the  weight of models and that of the normal female population (Pipher 184).  Source: Andrea A. Lunsford (Bedford/St. Martin???s, 2004)  1  Page 2  Pfeifer  This media phenomenon has had a major effect on the female population as a  whole, both young and old. Five to ten million women in America today suffer from an  eating disorder related to poor self-image, and yet advertisements continue to prey on  insecurities fueled by a woman???s desire to be thin. Current estimates reveal that 80  percent of women are dissatisfied with their appearance and 45 percent of those are on a  diet on any given day (??Statistics??). Yet even the most stringent dieting will generally  fail to create the paper-thin body so valued in the media, and continuing efforts to do so  can lead to serious psychological problems such as depression.  While many young women express dissatisfaction with their bodies, they are not  the only victims of the emaciated images so frequently presented to them. Young girls  are equally affected by these images, if not more so. Eighty percent of girls under age ten  have already been on a diet and expressed the desire to be thinner and more beautiful  (Slim Hopes). Thus from a young age, beauty is equated with a specific size. The  message girls get is an insidious one: in order to be your best self, you should wear size 0  or 1. The pressure only grows more intense as girls grow up. According to results from  the Kaiser Family Foundation Survey ??Reflections of Girls in the Media,?? 16 percent of  ten- to seventeen-year-old girls reported that they had dieted or exercised to look like a  TV character. Yet two-thirds of teenage girls acknowledged that these thin characters  were not an accurate reflection of ??real life?? (qtd. in Dittrich, ??Children?? pars. 2-3).  It is tragic to see so much of the American population obsessed with weight and  reaching an ideal that is, for the most part, ultimately unattainable. Equally troubling is  the role magazines play in feeding this obsession. When a researcher asked female  students from Stanford University to flip through several magazines containing images of  glamorized, super-thin models, 68 percent of the women felt significantly worse about  Source: Andrea A. Lunsford (Bedford/St. Martin???s, 2004)  2  Page 3  Pfeifer  themselves after viewing the magazine models (qtd. in Dittrich, ??Media?? par. 16).  Another study showed that looking at  models on a long-term basis leads to  stress, depression, guilt, and lowered  self-worth (qtd. in Dittrich, ??Media??  par. 19). As Naomi Wolf points out in  The Beauty Myth, thinking obsessively  about fat and dieting has actually been  shown to change thought patterns and  brain chemistry.  How do we reject images that are so  harmful to the women and young girls  who view them (such as those  appearing in magazines like the one in  Fig. 1)? Legislation regarding what can be printed and distributed is not an option  because of First Amendment rights. Equally untenable is the idea of appealing to the  industries that hire emaciated models. As long as the beauty and clothing industries are  making a profit from the physically insecure girls and women who view their ads, nothing  will change.  What, however, might happen if those females stopped buying the magazines that  print such destructive images? A boycott is the most effective way to rid the print  medium of emaciated models and eliminate the harmful effects they cause. If women  stopped buying magazines that target them with such harmful advertising, magazines  would be forced to change the kinds of ads they print. Such a boycott would send a clear  Source: Andrea A. Lunsford (Bedford/St. Martin???s, 2004)  3  Fig. 1. Young woman reading magazine.  Personal photograph. This magazine???s cover  exemplifies the sexy, thin stereotype.  Page 4  Pfeifer  message: women and girls reject the victimization that takes place every time they look at  a skeletally thin model and then feel worse about themselves. Consumers can ultimately  control what is put on the market: If we don???t buy, funding for such ads will dry up fast.  In the past, boycotts ha
AA11452268	Because animals in that area existed in abundance, and there were no natural predators other than man, of which they had a natural fear. Men did not need to overhunt the megafauna in Africa as they did in North America. Moreover, since men had arrived only recently in America, megafauna on the American continent had no fear of them and were much easier to hunt as a result.    Another theory says that the megafauna of America were driven to extinction by climate change. Apparently the climate change during the Late Pleistocene that may have driven North American animals to extinction was not as severe in Africa.    A newer theory states that disease that spread through America but not Africa was to blame, but the offending microbes, if they indeed existed, have yet to be isolated or identified.

AA11376316	As we come to the vertebrates, we begin to find real efficiencies with the closed system. Fish possess one of the simplest types of true heart. A fish's heart is a two-chambered organ composed of one atrium and one ventricle. The heart has muscular walls and a valve between its chambers. Blood is pumped from the heart to the gills, where it receives oxygen and gets rid of carbon dioxide. Blood then moves on to the organs of the body, where nutrients, gases, and wastes are exchanged. However, there is no division of the circulation between the respiratory organs and the rest of the body. That is, the blood travels in a circuit which takes blood from heart to gills to organs and back to the heart to start its circuitous journey again.    Frogs have a three-chambered heart, consisting of two atria and a single ventricle. Blood leaving the ventricle passes into a forked aorta, where the blood has an equal opportunity to travel through a circuit of vessels leading to the lungs or a circuit leading to the other organs. Blood returning to the heart from the lungs passes into one atrium, while blood returning from the rest of the body passes into the other. Both atria empty into the single ventricle. While this makes sure that some blood always passes to the lungs and then back to the heart, the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the single ventricle means the organs are not getting blood saturated with oxygen. Still, for a cold-blooded creature like the frog, the system works well. Humans and all other mammals, as well as birds, have a four-chambered heart with two atria and two ventricles. Deoxygenated and oxygenated blood are not mixed. The four chambers ensure efficient and rapid movement of highly oxygenated blood to the organs of the body. This has helped in thermal regulation and in rapid, sustained muscle movements.|`|AA12287991	ha, damn.. he nailed everything..

If you sponsor someone, like shopping at a store, you patronise them, and offer your patronage. Again, no mocking.    However, if you treat someone condescendingly, that is, if you treat them with contempt and act in a manner that assumes superiority over them, you are acting patronisingly. You patronise someone when you treat them in this way and it has nothing to do with shopping. It's not truly mockery, but it is somewhat similar.    If I ask my brother to do something for me and he says "Oh, yes of course I'd be pleased to do it, I can't wait." in a tone which expresses sarcasm with an expression on his face that says he hates me, I feel patronised because he is saying that he's happy to do something that he clearly does not want to do.     At university, I felt patronised when I asked my lecturer a question and all she did was nod at me and thank me for my contribution to class, but she never addressed the issue I raised.    I hope that helps!|`|AA11452268	There are a couple of definitions, each with very different meanings.    The first means simply to frequent an establishment; to become a patron of it. Hence, if you go to a locally owned restaurant a lot, you are said to be patronizing it. Likewise, contributions of money to an artist is a type of patronizing. Someone who contributes money to the local symphony or museum is said to be a "patron of the arts".    The second means to act in a condescending manner to someone. This is indeed something like mocking, but it is not always easy to detect because sometimes it is done in an indirect way that the person being mocked may not pick up on. For example, if a student asks a professor, "Do we have to know this for the test?" and the professor responds, "Oh my heavens, no. You're already much to overloaded with classword for me to expect you to learn anything new!", the professor is mocking the student. However, his tone of voice could vary from extremely sarcastic (which would make this easy to identify as mockery) or with no hint of sarcasm whatsoever. If there is little or no sarcasm detectable, that's patronizing.

Here's a good article on metabolism:  http://www.scienceclarified.com/Ma-Mu/Me...  Fingerprinting is a way of identifying people.  DNA fingerprinting is a way of identifying people by comparing the DNA inside our cells.  It's just called fingerprinting because it's another way of identifying people.  It has nothing to do with fingers.  Genetic mutations:  there is a famous study of a species of white moth.  During the Industrial Revolution, the air became heavily polluted.  The trees the moths landed on became black with soot, and the white moths were easy to see, so their predators were eating them into extinction.  Some moths mutated, though, and became darker.  The darker moths survived.  That's the essence of natural selection.

AND thay can be either perfect (or not)  AND they are either simple or continuous.    This makes 3 x 2 x 2 = 12    Starting with the present tenses:  I walk - present simple  I am walking - present continuous  I have walked - present perfect simple  I have been walking - present perfect continuous    Then the past tenses  I walked - simple past  I was walking - past continuous  I had walked - past perfect simple  I had been walking - past perfect continuous    Then the future tenses  I will walk - simple future  I will be walking - future continuous  I will have walked - future perfect simple  I will have been walking - future perfect continuous    Tenses in English are also complicated by use of various auxiliary verbs such as do/did in question forms and negatives.  E.g. Did you go?  Yes, I went.  etc.    This makes the English verb system one of the most complex in the all the Indo European languages.    The only tenses with significant morphology in the root words are the simple past and past participles    Any good English dictionary will have a list of these in the format:    do - did - done  have - had - had etc|`|2580bf4d123ace8ac5646a768a8ed159aa	...in what language?|`|e65dd8923503e6aef047ecd6772680a6aa	im bored so..  run ran will run  walk walked will walk  do did will do  ride rode will ride  sit sat will sit  swim swam will swim  jog jogged will jog  kick kicked will kick  slap slapped will slap  punch punched will punch  shop shopped will shop  spit spat will spit  comb combed will comb  pick picked will pick  lie lain will lie  shut had shut will shut  watch watched will watch  type typed will type  click clicked will click  ask asked will ask  raise raised will rise    yeah and im not bored enough to contine on:)

AA10239987	yes, the child should be registered at the embassy. I think you need to get an affidavit from the father, father's proof of citizenship and child's birth certificate.     Its going to be extremely hard for the embassy to acknowledge the citizenship of the child with the father's assistance.    You may need to go though the Filipino court system to establish paternity. Once you done this, you can then take that documentation to the embassy to plead your case.    Unfortunately, children receive citizenship because the American parent really wants the children to have it. It is going to be a hard route to do otherwise.    I would to go to an Filipino lawyer that practices in both the USA and the Philippines for advise.    Another thing -- don't delay-- citizenship will be harder to get once the child is older than 18 years old.|`|AA11417042	I could be totally wrong, but I know the military really frowns on child abandonment, contact the base, his Commanding Officer and the matter should be addressed|`|AA11621532	Sweety, if he signed the papers, in America, that is all it takes.

5873826b2cf5e16f4c5e1bdddbae9426aa	I've taken them twice (once for my MA and then again for my PhD to try and get a higher score -- which I did in one part and not in the other).  I think the general test is difficult.  I was an English major so only took one math class so I did horribly on the math section, but since I wanted in to both an MA and PhD program in English the math wasn't really looked at (which is good!).  However, I got in to both an MA and a PhD program with pretty low scores in the other section (my writing was really high but the analytical wasn't great).      Standardized tests are sort of a joke, sadly they're still largely required.  If you can find somewhere to take the written test do that!  The computerized test is much harder because as you answer questions correctly you start to get harder questions.  When you get one wrong you get an easier one but still, the written test is just a set of questions that can't get harder or easier.      I suggest going to a library and looking at GRE books.  If you're taking a subject test make sure you get a subject book too.  The books are good because they give you hints on taking the test and really let you know how it's set up.  They also give you ways to answer questions you don't know or aren't sure of and give you lessons to get you up to speed (like in math).  However, if you get a book make sure you buy it plenty early and really make it a habit to work in the book.  I bought books both times and would be dedicated for a week or so and then get off track and not work from the book for a month or so).  Cramming it all in just before the exam doesn't help nearly as much.  Also remember that the test costs money, and it's a lot so it's best to really be as prepared as possible when you go in to take it.    Good luck!|`|ff67059279cd73a6cea6a5e01a25db91aa	They're hard, but take them online where ever the testing center is, you'll get your grade back a lot faster.  Study!

Functional resumes are ordered by the skills learned.     Remember to always keep your resume organized in some way, it has to make sense to the employer. Get some on to read it over for you.     Another tips would be to avoid using the same words over again. use a thesorus and find an alternate word.     Use action words (See website listings).    Stay consistant. If you are writing in 3rd person, keep it that way. Also make sure to keep using the same tense of the words. (Present tense or past tense)    Keep it simple.

O que pensabas que seria muy dificl y ahi haces bromas a cerca de algun maestro que no era tan duro con los alumnos.    2.- Despues te pones seria y hablas del futuro, de lo que viene, de ser exitoso, con la ayuda de tus compa?eros y nombras algunos y si puedes tambien haz alguna bromilla,    3.- Despues de tus padres (y de los de tus compa?eros ) y el esfuerzo que hicieron para llevarte a esa universidad y del esfuerzo de tus maestros por mantenerlos atentos y aprendiendo y ya sabes... otra broma.. jaja.    4.- por ultimo expresa tu deseo por no perder contacto con todos y ayudarse unos a otros en el mundo real.    5.- Agradece a todo mundo y ya....      etc

38abb4e3e12a5b63af682efe0e25e80daa	HERE ARE THE EFFECTS OF DEFORESTATION:    "Deforestation does not appear to modify the global average of precipitation, but it changes precipitation patterns and distributions by affecting the amount of both sensible heat and that released into the atmosphere when water vapor condenses, called latent heat," .    "Associated changes in air pressure distribution shift the typical global circulation patterns, sending storm systems off their typical paths." And, because of the Amazon's location, any sort of weather hiccup from the area could signal serious changes for the rest of the world like droughts and severe storms.    Clearly, land-cover changes in tropical regions carry potentially significant consequences on water resources, wildfire frequency, agriculture and related activities at various remote locations.    And while greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants receive considerable attention, this study shows that land-cover change is another important parameter that needs to be considered in climate policies, especially since deforestation rates in tropical Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America have remained constant or have increased over the past two decades.    Land-cover change, depending on its nature, can either mitigate or exacerbate greenhouse warming.|`|a61de7cc8b179a012c9661ea5d1f9414aa	Deforestation affects the air cycle in a big way.  The physical cutting down of trees causes pollution and releases global warming pollution.  The forests are one of the best defenses against air pollution and global warming. In fact, our greatest forests, like the Amazon, are often called the lungs of the earth, because they produce oxygen for us and they absorb the carbon dioxide that is the worst global warming culprit.  When you cut the forests down, youre getting rid of one of the best protections that our air has, since the forests also help moderate weather.

dafcd44681f3dc0e3483efe1eb66c833aa	The first 5 are already in standard notation.  Do you need to convert those to scientific notation?  For standard to scientific notation, you need the coefficient to be between 1 and 10.  Practically, this means "moving" the decimal point left or right as needed, and the number of positions it moved is the exponent, e.g.    1234500 = 1.2345 * 10^6  (the coefficient 1.2345 is between 1 and 10, and I needed to move the decimal point 6 places up to get the coefficient.    Other examples:  314.159 = 3.14159 * 10^2  0.000123 = 1.23 * 10^(-4) (I needed to move the decimal 4 places _down_ to get the coefficient 1.23)    For the next five, to convert from scientific to standard notation, just expand the 10^x term and do the multiplication, e.g.    123.45 * 10^4 = 123.45 * 10000 = 1234500    Heck, you can plug them in to your calculator and get answers faster than the time it took you to type questions here.

I think you might be interested in reading about the theory of multiple intelligences, there is even a test you can take to see which type of intelligence you have.

Each person has a unique set of talents and abilities. If we have a talent for something, it seems like we can do it so easily and naturally.

We don't all do it the same way.    ;-D And luckily for us I might add, or life would really be boring!    PS Hi utopiadominator! In another question you asked about where to get books online.

Some have natural talents for certain skills or natural understandings of certain concepts.  Others must work, study, or practice exceptionally hard.      Those who truly become masters of their field, sport, or ability--those who make history--have BOTH.  They are born with an internal propensity to grow in a given area.  They discover that area and it is fostered by those around them.  They work hard and become the very best, brightest, strongest, and so forth.    Unfortunately (in both cases) there are people who never discover or hone their special gift.  It is never fostered or developed.  They still have an internal propensity, but it does not grow.  There are also some who have very little internal talent, skill or propensity, but they have a desire--passion for learning or developing despite their lack of aptitude.  They gut it out, spend hours, days, weeks studying or practicing...only to become only GOOD but never truly great.      I hope whatever your special gift is...you find it, foster it, nurture it and become the very best!
a86e0e37187de8b33293316ed0300f0daa	I've had bad roommates for the past 2 years now.  Well the first one was in the dorm.  He never took showers.  Wore clothes that were loose and his butt-crach always showed.  That was the first thing I saw of him ever when I had come into the room while he was bending over while sitting in a chair.  What an introduction my friend! What an introduction! I would open the window and blinds as the stench was plain disgusting, but he always closed them when i was out.  He left his dirty laundry like that in the middle of the room and i wonder if he ever washed them as they were still there after 2 weeks.  One could easily see where his section ended and mine started as his had sort of a black film on.  Ugh.  When I talk to him about it, he said he understood but apparently, it just entered in one ear and left through the other.  When I talked about moving out, he asked me to pay him so that he moves out.  Well one day I just picked up my stuff and moved out.    That other roommate was better in one way but worse on the other.  He showered, so that's cool; BUT he had a darn attitude and was inconsiderate.  He would turn the tv on for nothing, even when i was sleeping.  The sound and light from the tv can be annoying while one sleeps.  He spent all his time on the phone, sometimes not even talking.  He would take the phone and get in bed.  He would fall asleep and never talk, but the phone stayed with him such that I hardly ever got to use whenever I needed it.  When one day I was watching a good movie on tv and he wanted to go to sleep, he was like 'hey man! you make as if you're the only one living in this room!'  I was left flabbergasted.  Thank God the semester ended and I could move out before I blew up.    The second year, moved off campus and got assigned this guy as housemate.  He claimed to be black but had white skin.  Talked, walked, acted, thought and did everything like a girl but claimed to be a man.  He condemned me for pre-marital sex while he himself had a son.  No, he wasn't married or anything.  He left the tv on 24/7(sometimes both the one in the living room and in his room while he wasn't watching either) and the electricity bill was outrageous.  Never told me anything in my face but instead wrote little notes on the fridge.  Annoying, plain annoying.

8289c3dbcba3d07878ec633e5ab62897aa	The best way to do this is to use logarithms.    1. Apply ln to all of them.    a ln x = b ln y = c ln xy    2.  we can split up the ln xy  ln xy = lnx + ln y so we have    a ln x = b ln y = c (ln x + ln y)    3.  we can solve for ln x using the equation    ln x = (b/a) ln y    4.   We plug that back into the equation, solving for b    b ln y = c( [(b/a) ln y] + ln y)    Now we can pull out ln y    b ln y = c ((b/a) + 1) ln y    Divide by ln y    b = c ((b/a) + 1)    Simplify    b = c ( (b + a)/a)  b = c(b + a)/a    multiply by a on both sides    ***ab = c(b+a)    You can also solve this by substituting ln y = (a/b) ln x. The solution path will be the same except you will solve for a in part 4.  The answer comes out as ab = c(b+a) either way.|`|66221c2d8373e09903ba49b95a9a9105aa	42|`|AA12150870	x^a=y^b    therefore x=y^(b/a)  (^a will become sq.rt when it goes to the other side)    sub the value of x in (xy)^c    ={y^(b/a)*y}^c    equate this with y^b.    then y^(b/a)*y}^c=y^b           y^(bc/a)*y^c=y^b            y^(bc/a  + c)=y^b  [equating the sum of powers]                  bc/a  + c =b                   (bc+ac)/a  =b                    bc+ac = ba                    c(a+b)=ab.
83a57f889a3115fd5c3093c82e955709aa	hmm, I think the problem with this is that Australia's "Outback" isn't a clearly defined region.     If "Outback" is used specifically to mean Australia's desert interior, then I guess you could say it's all in one biome - namely, desert.    But yeh, it could also be used in a more general way to mean anywhere remote from the inhabited coastal areas. In that case, it could also include parts of the forest (Mediterranean scrub) and savanna biomes.     So, sorry I can't be more definite, but I think it kinda depends on the definitions!

Il part habituellement de Montral, au printemps ou  l'automne, pour une priode de plusieurs mois, dans des canots chargs de pacotille qu'il change contre des fourrures. Sous le rgime des congs de traite, on distingue les voyageurs, qui sont engags par contrat par des marchands pourvus de permis, des coureurs de bois associs le plus souvent  des hors-la-loi, faute d'avoir obtenu un permis des autorits.      la dfinition de wikipdia    Un coureur des bois ou coureur de bois tait, comme le voyageur, directement impliqu dans la traite des fourrures avec les Amrindiens. Les coureur des bois opraient durant le XVIIe sicle en Amrique du Nord coloniale.  l'oppos du voyageur, il ne possdait pas de permis de traite mis par le roi de France.    Durant le XVIIe sicle, le commerce de la fourrure tait trs lucratif pour la Nouvelle-France. La comptition tait froce et beaucoup de colons s'aventuraient des territoires coloniss autour de Montral vers l'Ouest et le Nord pour tablir des liens amicaux avec les Amrindiens avec qui faire du commerce. Les coureurs des bois n'taient pas per?us trs favorablement par les autorits de Montral et les officiels royaux. Ils n'apprciaient pas les personnes quittant les zones de dveloppement de l'agriculture pour chercher leur fortune dans le ngoce. Les autorits fran?aises prfraient que le transport des fourrures soit gr par les Amrindiens plut?t que par des commer?ants indpendants et non rguls qui rapportaient tant de fourrures que le march tait satur. Le trafic de fourrures sapait aussi le r?le de Montral comme point central du commerce de la fourrure  o les ngociants changeaient les peaux de castor contre des biens de commerce comme des vtements, des armes  feu ou des pots en cuivre pour la cuisine. Certains de ces ngociants clandestins posaient aussi des problmes en changeant de l'alcool contre des fourrures.  Quelques ordonnances royaux et dits furent officialiss afin de rguler la course des bois. Entre 1674 et 1690 environ, il tait formellement interdit de commercer dans les bois sous peine d'amende pour une premire offense et de condamnation aux galres pour une seconde offense. Entre 1690 et 1701, puis  partir de 1729 jusqu' la fin du rgime fran?ais, un systme de cong de traite fut instaur dans le but de rduire le nombre de coureurs des bois engags dans la traite, mais aussi pour en tenir un registre officiel. Toutefois, ces congs de traite taient vendus par le gouvernement colonial et achets en bloc par les marchands, commer?ants et membres de la classe dirigeante ayant des intrts dans la traite des pelleteries qui les redistribuaient parmi leurs "collaborateurs" sans les tenir au registre. Cette lgitimation cra la seconde gnration de coureurs des bois : les voyageurs.  Parmi les coureurs des bois connus : tienne Br?l, Louis Joliet, Mdard des Groseilliers and Pierre-Esprit Radisson, Jean Nicolet, Guillaume Couture, Jacques de Noyon et La Vrendrye.|`|f03bf48c2c512422895ca481c2f4421caa	c'est quelqu'un qui court que dans les bois ? , lolllllll|`|a85288984df08682355089f4d2130426aa	Oui des trapeurs en gros.

AA11397626	I came back from my 27 months in Peace Corps this past December. I was very much welcomed for my teaching, and I made friends that I will never forget -- both among my fellow volunteers, and among the people of Tanzania.     What Peace Corps requires is that you have a skill you can use in volunteering. What have you done with your life so far? Do you know anything about health? Anything about agriculture, carpentry, or another skill with your hands?  Do you have experience in teaching, or a degree in science or math?  A degree is usually required for science and math teaching, but not for teaching English and not for environmental and health volunteers -- but it helps.  Their only requirement (to be considered) is 18 years of age or older.    Peace Corps will not pay for your student loans -- they don't have the money that our military has.  What they will do is defer.  Deferrment means that you will not be required to make any payments on your loans until you return from your service; this can be to your benefit if you have money in a savings account which will gain interest.  The interest on the loans does not increase, etc...  basically the loans pause in all their activity while you are gone.    It is most definitely an experience worth having! It gave me two years' experience in teaching, with ESL experience that helped me to get a job teaching at a good private school. Beyond the gain back at home, I was able to show some of my family the country (a visit from home) and I was able to make a difference in the lives of many students and a large number of friends from every country in the world. If you have the freedom to spend two years away from the States, you should definitely volunteer!     The Peace Corps is for US citizens only and is therefore more careful with its volunteers than many organizations. As a fellow volunteer stated, the organization is perfect for someone who has never left the country before. There are many weeks of training, and the volunteers are assigned "homestay families" who are also coached in the safety and teaching of their volunteer. Some of our volunteers who had experience outside the country found their extra care tiresome, but it does mean that the volunteers are safe.    Peace Corps does not have an active program in any country that is volitile, and if an area becomes volitile they will evacuate the volunteers. There are drills and plans to follow for each volunteer so that they know their role in such a situation.     With the Peace Corps, there are contacts in every town and the people in your village have all necessary contact information with headquarters should they be needed. They also provide free medical care at the headquarters. If there is any danger by terrorists or civil unrest, they will bring you to headquarters and, if necessary, help you all to evacuate.       The "food allowance" is about the same as your "Host Country National" counterparts, housing is provided, and they give you language training and a "counterpart" or helpful local resident to help orient you.  The "food allowance" depends on the country you are assigned to, but it is usually about $150 - $300 a month -- more than enough to buy your food in a country where basic groceries cost about $50 a month!     You really should look into it and see if you would like to join; it is most definitely an experience worth having. You can contact me also, if you have questions. You have plenty of time to research it.    And yes, the volunteers made a tangible difference in their communities and the ones nearby. There are environmental volunteers (digging wells, teaching agriculture, teaching sanitation), health volunteers (teaching both in schools and in communities, including HIV/AIDS education), and education volunteers (teaching primarily in schools, science and math subjects).     If you have other questions, let me know! If you have experience with the Spanish language, there is a very good chance that they would accept you for the Western Hemisphere assignments, and there are many more environmental needs there. Depending on what your abilities are with other areas, fluency in Spanish alone can be a useful qualification.  Fluency in French can be a benefit in gaining an assignment  in Western Africa.  Just FYI!|`|133a6c4d4a8fa13db870f71425b25a1aaa	When I was accepted 12 years ago, they wanted a bachlor's degree in anything. They also helped to defer student loan payments and a percentage of your overall loan.  I would highly encourage the experience, wherever they send you, it will be worth while. I spent 2 years in China, not through the Peace Corps since the program was set up just after I returned to the States, but living overseas is a priceless experience! Enjoy!|`|d30a94bc4ac68f4f16d97a51dc44af71aa	hi|`|9b2344637d9e97dd424becec118e4234aa	95% of PCV's have a college degree. The other 5% are very, very good at something - farming, small engine repair, selling native crafts to rich American tourists - that  a host country wants to learn about.    They defer student loans, sometimes. It depends on who you got it from. When you come back you have to pay it off.
c6cb24e5c39a1dd827420b63f871e3a0aa	I suggest considering what you might want to do career-wise if you earned an MA or MFA and couldn't immediately earn a real living through writing and teaching college.    Try message boards for writers and instructors/academics and learn more about the degrees, what it takes to earn them, and what people do once they have them.
7def98dad33cd5ea29c6601cd162a9d8aa	I don't see how this would be effective in any way. If you were to spell things by the way they sound you would have many MANY variations of just one word. There are people from one end of the country that say it one way and others who say it another way. Some people put more of an emphasis on one sound in a word than other people do. For example I am from the Midwest and when I hear people from Boston talk (no offense to anyone) and they say beer or bear I have to ask twice to be certain what they said because with their accent they both sound the same to me. I simply believe people need to not be lazy and learn the rules of the English language and spellings.

AA11397626	I don't know about the technical college, but you can always visit the Peace Corps website to find out information and apply.      I came back from my 27 months in Peace Corps this past December. I was very much welcomed for my teaching, and I made friends that I will never forget -- both among my fellow volunteers, and among the people of Tanzania.     What Peace Corps requires is that you have a skill you can use in volunteering. What have you done with your life so far? Do you know anything about health? Anything about agriculture, carpentry, or another skill with your hands?  Do you have experience in teaching, or a degree in science or math?      It is most definitely an experience worth having! It gave me two years' experience in teaching, with ESL experience that helped me to get a job teaching at a good private school. Beyond the gain back at home, I was able to show some of my family the country (a visit from home) and I was able to make a difference in the lives of many students and a large number of friends from every country in the world. If you have the freedom to spend two years away from the States, you should definitely volunteer!     The Peace Corps is for US citizens only and is therefore more careful with its volunteers than many organizations. As a fellow volunteer stated, the organization is perfect for someone who has never left the country before. There are many weeks of training, and the volunteers are assigned "homestay families" who are also coached in the safety and teaching of their volunteer. Some of our volunteers who had experience outside the country found their extra care tiresome, but it does mean that the volunteers are safe.    Peace Corps does not have an active program in any country that is volitile, and if an area becomes volitile they will evacuate the volunteers. There are drills and plans to follow for each volunteer so that they know their role in such a situation.     That said, you may also want to check in the VSO or Volunteer Services Organization. If you join Peace Corps, you may choose a region of the world -- such as South America or Sub-Saharan Africa.     With the Peace Corps, there are contacts in every town and the people in your village have all necessary contact information with headquarters should they be needed. They also provide free medical care at the headquarters. If there is any danger by terrorists or civil unrest, they will bring you to headquarters and, if necessary, help you all to evacuate.       The "food allowance" is about the same as your "Host Country National" counterparts, housing is provided, and they give you language training and a "counterpart" or helpful local resident to help orient you.  The "food allowance" depends on the country you are assigned to, but it is usually about $150 - $300 a month -- more than enough to buy your food in a country where basic groceries cost about $50 a month!     You really should look into it and see if you would like to join; it is most definitely an experience worth having. You can contact me also, if you have questions. You have plenty of time to research it.    And yes, the volunteers made a tangible difference in their communities and the ones nearby. There are environmental volunteers (digging wells, teaching agriculture, teaching sanitation), health volunteers (teaching both in schools and in communities, including HIV/AIDS education), and education volunteers (teaching primarily in schools, science and math subjects).     There are also NGO's (Non-Governmental Organizations) in many countries, which can give you a long-term or even a permanent position.   They work with more specific issues, such as AIDS education, literacy in general, or religious education.      Try looking into things!  You have Americorps, Peace Corps, VSO, Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, Caretakers of the Environment, and NGO's. Most of these will give a (small) food allowance for your help.     If you have other questions, let me know! If you have experience with the Spanish language, there is a very good chance that they would accept you for the Western Hemisphere assignments, and there are many more environmental needs there. Depending on what your abilities are with other areas, fluency in Spanish alone can be a useful qualification.  Fluency in French can be a benefit in gaining an assignment  in Western Africa.  Just FYI!|`|e21c4f8cbf82990cfe523838ebd4e857aa	The Peace Corps isn't a study abroad program. It is an employment office, more or less. You apply for a job with them. If a developing country has asked to hire someone with your skills (Civil Engineering with an emphasis on water supplies, for instance), you get an invitation.    They take about one applicant out of 10.    Most large college placement offices will have a brochure or two, and they send recruiters to some colleges, but, as Weilder said, your best bet is the web site.

Negative integers are all the opposites of these whole numbers: -1, -2, -3, -4, -5,  . We do not consider zero to be a positive or negative number. For each positive integer, there is a negative integer, and these integers are called opposites. For example, -3 is the opposite of 3, -21 is the opposite of 21, and 8 is the opposite of -8.

You can also say that these are 0, together with the signed numbers that are whole.  Meaning, all signed decimal numbers and fractions greater or less than whole numbers or radical numbers that do not have exact roots are not integers.  -1/2, +7/3, +.35, -.333..., -sqrt of 5 are not integers though they are signed nos.

The key word here is orgasm because you can have sex but if you fail to orgasm you may have even more tension and frustration than you did before having sex.    Oxytocin is released in the brain during orgasm in both sexes and reduces tension and anxiety.|`|AA12244965	Yea, sex releases tension by increasing the blood flow and then thus, giving a hormone release after achieving orgasm. It's simliar to how exercising releases tension if you do it long enough to the point that certain hormone releases and everything is chill.|`|AA12204818	I do know it does release stress, exercise releases stress and sex is a form of exercising.

Many things do not have opposites but may have things that appear to be.    Like a chair.  What is the opposite? To stand?  Well, one is a noun, one is a verb.  OK, so lets say Chair - Couch.  Well, both are sitting instruments covered usually in a cloth material.  But a chair seats 1 and a couch many.  However, "many" is not the opposite of 1, -1 would be.  So, the opposite of chair would be a dinner party of 6 with 5 chairs! Someone gets stuck with a -1 chair.    Lets move away from furniture.  Over/under I can accept.  "lets dig under the fence instead of climbing over it."  But, lets take through ( In one side and out the opposite).  You can't use "around" to oppose through, it is a different directional motion.  The opposite of through would be more like withdraw, to pull back from.  But can you really say "lets not go through the tunnel, we can just withdraw"?|`|93547223966eba1e7e7205989a0e6ac4aa	oppasent????

I believe that my performance and expertise was much better the longer that I worked...that holds true for most of the staff.....but, I saw many nurses lose interest and become grouchy and impatient..

AA12359885	http://www.sparknotes.com/chemistry/      Introduction and Summary     Before moving into the study of any science, it is important to understand the basis of scientific study: recording and presenting scientific data. In order for one scientist to understand the results of a different scientist's experiments, there must be a standardized system through which the data can be shared and understood.       This SparkNote will discuss a number of important concepts associated with recording scientific data and presenting experimental results. Specifically, this SparkNote will discuss the concepts of units, significant figures, and scientific notation. Units allow scientists to standardize measurements of scientific data, while the rules for expressing significant figures ensure that data is presented honestly and accurately. Scientific notation provides a more convenient method of writing otherwise cumbersome large and small numbers.      http://www.sparknotes.com/chemistry/fund...      http://www.sparknotes.com/      Kevin, Liverpool, England.|`|AA11082420	You didn't list what book you are using.

AA11127477	In the early days of the United States, the Constitutional Convention was trying to figure out how to distribute representatives for Congress.  There were two main plans    The Virginia Plan - The number of representatives is determined by the population of the state.  This favored states like Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts who had large populations.    The New Jersey Plan - The number of representatives for each state would be equal regardless of population.  The smaller states wanted this plan so the larger states couldn't overrun Congress.    Connecticut Compromise - Developed into a bicameral legislature.  The Senate would have two representatives from each state regardless of size.  The House of Representatives representation would be based on the population of the state.  This system is still in use today.|`|82f01eb1519c0efa6241fa3b95ff45bcaa	i know the answer!!! ok i 4got. i had US history this yr. hey let me go look it up hold on!    ok great compromise: agreement reached during the constitutional convention that created the american system of government.    new hersey plan- plan of gov't that the  constitutional convention considered    ah that probably didnt help sorry

Os idiomas dos sames ("lap?es") s?o associados ao ramo fins, tanto como algumas lnguas minoritrias ao longo do rio Volga no noroeste da Rssia, o maior sendo o mordvino que talvez possa contar com at um milh?o de falantes.     O finlands  uma lngua sonora, ao estilo do italiano. Tem oito vogais, que muitas vezes aparecem prolongadas ou formando ditongos. Muitas palavras internacionais, parecidas na maioria dos idiomas, possui em finlands um trmino etimologicamente nacional: "telefone"  "puhelin", "computador" diz-se "tietokone", "servidor" "palvelin" e "disquette"  "levyke".      um idioma expressivo, rico em derivativos, declina??es, conjuga??es. H quinze casos para os substantivos e adjetivos. "gua" por exemplo, se diz "vesi", mas o peixe "na gua" estar "vedess?", quem desce "para a gua" para banhar estar indo "veteen" e quem bebe "gua" est tomando "vett?".     As palavras s?o compridas mas levam muita informa??o e n?o  preciso usar um grande nmero delas: numa situa??o onde um brasileiro dir "desculpe-nos por n?o termos escrito" em cinco palavras o finlands pode dizer "anteeksi kirjoittamattomuutemme" em duas s.     O nome da Finlandia em finlands  "Suomi". Na poca medieval o nome denominava s a provncia no sudoeste do pas hoje denominada "Finlandia prpria" (Varsinais-Suomi) ou "Regi?o de Turku". "Finland" foi o nome usado pelos suecos, e a partir da lngua sueca foi introduzido em latim e na maioria dos demais idiomas. O nome "Suomi", que devia ter tido uma origem pr-histrica, apareceu em escrito pela primeira vez no ano 1211. Derivados de "Suomi" est?o sendo usados pelos idiomas finicos mais aproximados e pelas lnguas blticas (Ltvia e Lituania). O sentido original do nome n?o  conhecido. Portanto uma teoria sugere que "Suomi" possivelmente tem sua origem numa palavra que significaria pas "pantanoso".|`|AA10349376	the vikings!|`|3ef51330186f522835d3d64d62a553d6aa	A lngua finlandesa  um idioma da familia de lnguas urlicas do grupo fino-permiano, ao qual tambm pertencem o hngaro e o estoniano.    O finlands tem a caracterstica de n?o pertencer ao tronco indo-europeu, como a maior parte das lnguas europias. Pertencente ao tronco uraliano e ao ramo fino-permiano, assim como o estoniano e o livnio, tem morfologia do tipo aglutinante, e o acento t?nico recai sempre sobre a primeira slaba da palavra. O sistema de declina??o conta com um complexo sistema de quinze casos, a saber:    nominativo, caso do sujeito;   genitivo, caso do adjunto adnominal de posse;   acusativo, caso do objeto direto;   essivo, caso do adjunto adnominal de estado;   partitivo, caso do adjunto adnominal de parte (responde  pergunta: "do qu?");   translativo, caso do adjunto adverbial de mudan?a de estado;   inessivo, caso do adjunto adverbial de lugar;   elativo, caso do adjunto adverbial de sada de um lugar;   ilativo, caso do adjunto adverbial de entrada de um lugar;   adessivo, caso do adjunto adverbial de lugar externo;   ablativo, caso do adjunto adverbial de sada de lugar externo;   alativo, caso do adjunto adverbial de entrada em um lugar externo;   abessivo, caso do adjunto adnominal/adverbial de ausncia;   comitativo, caso do adjunto adverbial de companhia;   instrutivo, caso do adjunto adverbial de instrumento.     O nmero - singular ou plural -  determinado pelas diferentes termina??es em cada declina??o. N?o existem gneros, nem artigos. Como em finlands a fun??o sinttica  determinada pelas declina??es (que se distinguem pela termina??o de cada palavra, como em latim), a ordem das palavras indica a forma definida ou indefinida. Por exemplo, para se dizer "a flor est sobre a mesa", diz-se, em finlands: kukka on p?yd?ll?, ao passo que p?ydall? on kukka se traduz por "h uma flor sobre a mesa".|`|289ee84bf07ad4ee51110351b0c5e54aaa	Em diversos cantos do mundo h pessoas que se entusiasmaram pela lngua finlandesa.

c6099bb220bb7c22e9ac2b9fa95b8bb4aa	Read books to your toddler. Read alphabet books, counting books, books with different colors, storybooks or any book that they like. Read a variety of books to your toddler. Try to read to them several times a day.    Show your child his name in print. You can make a sign for their room or cards for friends and family with his name on it. Start showing him his name in print.    Play rhyming games with your preschooler. You can make up silly poems and have your child come up with the word that rhymes. Try giving them a list of three words and picking out the two that rhyme.    Take your child on trips to the library. Encourage them to pick out books they like. The library is an exciting place for a child. Let them have fun and learn how to use the library. Continue reading to them every day. Try to read for thirty minutes a day.    Start introducing him to different numbers and letters. Show him the letter and tell him what sound it makes. See if he can find other words that make the same sound. Use magazines and books to see if he can spot the letter or number on the page. If you are driving see if he can find the letter or number on billboards.    You might like to try this activity, too...    The Moveable Alphabet  Age 4 and onwards (some children will do this earlier) Use after children know most of the short letter sounds.    Purpose: To prepare for spelling, writing and reading.    Material: A large box with spaces for letters of the alphabet plus a few extra boxes for the vowel "y." The boxes contain several copies of the lower case letters cut out from stiff, thin, cardboard or plastic reinforce paper. Consonants are red and vowels are blue. These letter bars are a good substitute.     Presentation:  Floor activity- spread a large rug for the work area. You open the moveable alphabet box and show the letters to the child. You make sure that the child knows where the letters are in the box. Ask to find various letters, such as, "Can you show me "b"? and so on. After the child has a grasp of where the letters are you begin by saying, now we will make _______. For example, the word "bat."  Ask, "What letters do you hear when I say "bat"? Usually, it will be "b".  The child finds it and puts it on the mat.  Ask, "what other sounds do you hear?" Usually, it will be "t".  The child finds it and puts it next to the b  Next say, "There is a sound between the b and t.  " S-l-o-w-l-y clearly enunciate the word, b-a-t for the child.   The child will hear the vowel if he or she listens carefully.  Continue to make words with your child until the exercise is mastered.  Eventually, your child will be able to work alone.  Note: Make sure you use letters that your child knows. Also, continue to work on the phonetic sounds of the alphabet.      Use any of these 3 lettered phonetic words.|`|25b211d667282ba4139fd3676d251630aa	This may sound a little extravagant to you but I believe in inputting information at a young age, via sleep.

Its takes a child 7  years (k-6)  of school to comprehend the process of simple mathematics.  I believe that something is not right there.

What you were trying to do is divide the numerator and denominator by 2 which will not give you x/x-4. Instead it would give you (x/2-1)/(x/2-4) since you have to divide 2 into both terms inside the parenthesis. The rule to remember is that when you are trying to reduce to simpler terms the number you are dividing by has to be divided into each term in the numerator and denominator. The terms are separated by a plus sign or a minus sign. That is how you separate one term from another. If the problem was 2x/8x you could reduce the fraction by dividing the term in the numerator and term in the denominator by 2 and you would get x/4x and that would be the simplest term. Hope this isn't too confusing but that's how it actually works. Good luck!

cca82fc927dd5ec4332216e148a255a1aa	A Human's Red blood cells (RBCs) have a set of Antigens on them. The two especially important antigens called A and B. A person has either one or both or neither on the RBCs.   A person with Blood Group A is so because he has antigen A. Antigen B makes a person's Blood group B. If a person has both antigens, he is group AB and if he has neither, the blood group is O.  Antibodies against these two Antigens are found in the blood Plasma. Antibody or Anti A acts against antigen A. The other Anti B acts against antigen B. The antibodies in a human's blood plasma are always the opposite of the antigens on the RBCs. For example, Blood Groups A, B, AB and O have Antigens A, B, A&B and None respectively. The respective Antibodies are Anti B, Anti A, None and Anti A & Anti B.  During Transfusions Blood Matching has to be done. For example if a person of blood group A is given blood from a donor with blood group B, his anti B Antibodies will stick to the B Antigens on the imported red blood cells entering his body. This makes the donated red cells stick together or Agglutinate, which can be fatal. So it is very important in blood transfusion that only that blood group is infused whose red cell do not carry an Antigen which be attacked by his own Antibodies. Group O blood has neither A and B Antigens, so this blood can be given to anyone. Hence persons of blood group O are also called Universal Donors. Group AB blood has neither Anti A nor Anti B Antibodies, so any blood can be transfused into it. hence persons with blood group AB are also called Universal Recipients.       ****There is also a compatability chart at this website if you would like to look at it****|`|60fbc59cd9cb3a6b4c2ea1875eb1b0afaa	Great care is taken in cross-matching to ensure that the recipient's immune system will not attack the donor blood. In addition to the familiar human blood types (A, B, AB and O) and Rh factor (positive or negative) classifications, other minor red cell antigens are known to play a role in compatibility. These other types can become increasingly important in people who receive many blood transfusions, as their bodies develop increasing resistance to blood from other people via a process of alloimmunization...    and more
AA12244965	My guess is bleach would be a more appropriate disinfectant for an acidophilc bacteria. Acidopilics are at the higher end of the PH scale, while bleach is at the other end. I guess that would even it out and wipe out the bacteria b/c bleach is a decolorizer to acidophilics, meaning, it more likley ruins it cells......and rather alcohol would enhance the cell color if doing a dye of the bacteria.   I guess to test it you would just lay down the bacteria, heat fix it, add a dye, sit and dry, add the bleach, rinse it off, add alcohol and let it sit, rinse, add another dye, sit and dry adn examine it. The remainder bacteria left over would be the ones the bleach did not kill and the alcohol would have enhanced the cells to grab the die at the ending procedure. so, whatever you see, is what didn't dye.  and you could compare against another slide of using alcohol and dye but skipping the bleach.|`|a3f8edc3c0847f5d6095a82340824ea9aa	bleach. because acidophilic bacteria like acid(hence the name). and i believe that alcohol is acidic.

dc910a3fae005cb567ee76ebeac19611aa	I am only deducting from the wording of the phrase: Dialectical may refer to two contradictory states like input and output, life and death, fuel and waste . . .    When dialectical is applied to technology, it might mean a totally different perspective for technology !    Up to now, our so called technological advances only worry about the product to market, and not so much about the side effects that could be harmful or at least, wasteful.    Dialectical Technology might be a new paradigm shift that designs technology so waste from one process can be fuel for another ?
b8033bf8d408fe319ec07b82e0011ba6aa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytellin...          CHAPTER IV  CHAPTER IV: ABSTRACTING, SUMMARISING AND  PRECIS WRITING  1) ABSTRACTING  2) SUMMARISING  3) PRECIS WRITING  Abstracting, Summarising and Prcis Writing  1. Abstraction is a short account, e.g., the main points of a peace of writing, a book,  speech, etc.  There are two possible types of abstractions:  1. One types is picking out pieces of relevant information from an irrelevant mass.  If, for instance, you look at Airlines or a Railways Timetable and pick up only  the information about flights to one particular destination, you are abstracting.  The timetable will obviously contain other information, but you do not need  that. On another occasion you might abstract other information, such as  flights/Rail to some other destination or at some other day.  2. The second type is writing a short statement of what information, standpoint,  attitudes, conclusions, etc., are contained in a particular book, article, etc.  Let us look at first type of abstraction in some details from the following example:  Here is a body of a letter published in a newsletter:  Sir  May I request the Railway Authorities through these columns that they should at least run  a link express between Hyderabad and Wadi to connect with the Chennai-Mumbai Mail  (Train No. 9 and 10) at Wadi.  There is a huge rush of passengers for the evening Mumbai Express, and since the  Railways are not able to put on new services, although they have promised to do so, they  should at least introduce a link express leaving Hyderabad at about 10.30 a.m. and  reaching Wadi in four hours to connect with train No. 10 which leaves Wadi at 15.05.  On the return journey this link express could bring back coaches from train No. 9, leaving  Wadi at about 15.30 and reaching Hyderabad by 19.30 hours.  By introducing a link express of 6-7 coaches, the Railways could provide some relief to  the traveling public who has to go to Bombay and return to Hyderabad.  I hope the Railways will consider introducing such a link express and transferring some  extra load on to the Bombay-Madras Mail. This would be possible since some of the  coaches for Cochin, previously hauled by the Mail Train, have been diverted to the  Cochin Janata Express, which is now a daily service. Some room could therefore be  provided on Mail for passengers from Hyderabad.  Suppose a railway official decides that this letter deserves an answer. He sends it to  another official, with this memorandum  1. Please see attached letter.  2. Writer wants:  A. Morning links express Hyerabad-Wadi to connect with Bombay-Madras  Mails 9 to 10.  B. Return afternoon express.  C. Writer suggests extra space is available on 9 and 10 since Cochin coaches  are now taken by daily Cochin Janata Expres.  3. Shall I draft a reply?  In the above official deliberations, point 2 forms the abstract of the letter.  2. Summarizing is the selection and writing down of all important information in  the original source in a shortened form.  Abstracting and summarizing are closely connected: both involve selecting important  information and discarding the unimportant. But there are differences between the two:  (a) Abstraction is the selection of information for a single purpose. It ignores  information that may be equally as important but for other purposes.  (b) Summary is the much less severe shortening of a passage/section/chapter,  often- though not necessarily  to about 25% of the original length.  Type  Reader Purpose Length  Abstraction Self or others To record  information on one  topic / aspect etc., of  some materials  Short  Summary Others To transmit all the Often about 25% but  main points of the  original material  depends on proportion  of unimportant material  in the original  Steps for Summarising:  1. Read the passage carefully to:  a) Understand its organizational plan.  b) To cull out important aspects of argument.  c) To understand the relation among various points made. (This is what we  were doing while analyzing the passages in Unit III)  2. If we are aware of the plan of the writing, it is easier to select the important parts.  3. Cut out on elaborations and examples  4. Condense the matter through techniques such as one word substitutions,  replacement of idiomatic expressions with simple/single expressions, and conversion of  narration (Direct-Indirect Speech)  Example: Read the following passage:  All the mineral oil we use comes from under the ground, from where it has to be brought  to the surface by drilling. Various methods have been developed for deciding where oil  might be, and for the wells to exploit the oil if it is found. We say if, not when,  because no one can be certain  nine out of ten drillings are failures. Pumping the oil out  is not very often necessary, since the oil is usually under pressure beneath the surface and  this pressure forces it up in the wells.  In the crude form in which it comes up to the top of the well, it is not very useful. IT has  to be refined, which means that various liquids in the oil have to be separated from each  other. These liquids  usually called fractions  are separated by being heated and then  being allowed to cool off. The heat makes the oil evaporate, and as the vapour cools  down again, different fractions liquefy at different temperatures. In this way petrol,  kerosene, lubricants and many other products are obtained.  The lighter fractions are usually used for fuels. Of these, the ligh|`|9851231d36fe294ff83aa2ba3d0d8faaaa	ww.babylon dictionary.com

It was thus far more libertarian and related to strains of anarchism. It also put more of an emphasis on the evils of global capitalism. Many prominent Neo-Marxists such as Marcuse were sociologists and psychologists. It was bound up with the student movements of the 1960s. Neo-Marxism comes under the broader heading of New Left thinking. Neo-Marxism is also used frequently to describe the opposition to inequalities experienced by Lesser Developed Countries in the New Economic International Order. In a sociological sense, neo-Marxism adds Max Weber's broader understanding of social inequality, such as status and power, to Marxist philosophy.    Strains of neo-Marxism include: Hegelian-Marxism, Critical Theory, Analytical Marxism, and French Structural Marxism (closely related to structuralism).|`|5351d7013c3a793e7bc1f628b0746c5caa	Neo-Marxism was a 20th century school that harkened back to the early writings of Marx before the influence of Engels which focused on dialectical idealism rather than dialectical materialism, and thus rejected the economic determinism of early Marx, focusing instead on a non-physical, psychological revolution.

The  celebrities we watch reinforce this concept.  We define ourselves by our possessions, leading us to spend every penny we can. A person who lacks self-esteem is more prone to this behavior, often finding him/herself in such deep debt that bankruptcy is the only solution. Easy credit is also a factor, as it is hard for some people to make the connection between what they get with the credit card and the bill that arrives in the mail a month later. They know it logically, but emotionally it is unrelated. People shop to try to solve problems in their lives, much the same was as people take drugs.|`|90cb23b56a6d3889441d40eb0ae20161aa	We spend to satisfy a need that we all have.  There is a little empty spot in all of us and by spending money on something that we are attracted to it seems to fill that empty void that we feel at least for a short time.  After we bring our new purchase home it doesnot take long for  us to start looking for something else.   God created the emptiness so that we might turn and look for Him to fill us and not things.

a7995b2ff22b8da47a2a62069b416578aa	I normally don't copy things for answers, but this seemed the easiest way to have you see what a hornbook is.  Perhaps this is how the actors would study their lines, you could make one, printing one act of the play on it.   It could be an interesting project.  Good luck.        hornbook  primer of a kind in use from the 15th to the 18th cent. On one side of a sheet of parchment or paper the matter to be learned was written or printed; over the sheet, for its protection, a transparent sheet of horn was placed; and the two were fastened to a thin board, which usually projected to form a handle, perforated so that the hornbook might be attached to a girdle. The matter printed or written included the alphabet in capitals and small letters and other material, varying in different hornbooks, such as numerals and the Lord's Prayer. Sometimes the base and handle were made of metal, stone, or ivory and had letters carved or cast on them.    See A. W. Tuer, History of the Hornbook (2 vol., 1896, repr. 1968).|`|AA11102769	It first may help you to know what a horn book is, see below. Im not sure how it relates to Romeo & Juliet, unless you are making a hornbook of the story itself.  I guess you could use a wooden paddle or thick cardboard cut to look like it, paper, glue, and a plastic sheet protector or even thin wax paper will probably work for the "horn"  __________________________  It may not look like one, but a hornbook is really a book. Paper was pretty expensive once and hornbooks were made so children could learn to read without using a lot of paper. A hornbook was usually a small, wooden paddle with just one sheet of paper glued to it. But because that paper was so expensive, parents and teachers wanted to protect it. So they covered the paper with a very thin piece of cow's horn. The piece of cow's horn was so thin, you could see right through it. That's why these odd books were called "hornbooks."|`|e4b32e33b8c5f290f2ac40c695f487f2aa	historically, a horn book was a single page 'book' created with parchment or paper, sometimes, with basic things like the alphabet, the numbers, things like that, used to teach young children in school  but i might be wrong, because i have no idea how that relates to Romeo and Juliet
AA11308339	I think instead of listing which characters are dynamic or static, you should pick 1 static and 1 dynamic character and explain briefly why they were for example...     In the play the "Crucible" we saw both static and dynamic characters. Some characters remained the same throughout the play while others had great changes.  Abigail Williams, the unofficial leader of the group of girls, is a static character because throughout the story she keeps denying any witchcraft and claims she and the girls were just dancing. Hale is a dynamic character who sees it as his duty to seek out the witches, and to 'save their souls'. Hale, after seeing the horrors of the witch trials and watching the loss of both civil and human rights, has a conversion of heart and speaks out against them telling Judge Danforth that they are morally wrong.|`|2b2bd026601e1338ec05bdbafcce441eaa	You should do your own howework, Im not sure about the answer    Justin|`|AA12322906	"In the play the "Crucible" we saw both static and dynamic characters. Some characters remained the same throughout the play while others had great changes. Among some of the static characters were Abigail Williams, Rebecca Nurse, and Reverend Parris. Some of the dynamic characters were Reverend Hale, John Proctor, and Elizabeth Proctor."    The second sentence is redundant because it simply restates your first sentence.     I would use the introduction to explain the following:    (1) State the name of the play and the playwright (i.e. Arthur Miller) and when the play was written in 1 sentence.  (2) Summarize in 1 or 2 sentences what the play is about.  (3) In one sentence state your thesis, i.e. purpose for this essay or paper.    By exploring the static and dynamic qualities displayed amongst characters in the Crucible (since its a play, can't recall whether to underline or use quotes), the reader will come to understand the importance of the .... insert your own idea .....     There you go an example something to work with.    Hope that helps get you thinking more critically.|`|23956275c2f25cc899c0d61d092b38e3aa	At the beginning of the paragraph, use a catch phrase or whatever itz called ,explain it and then write the rest of the pargraph.|`|51e15a40a62db9f2e165d0a6a8359b6baa	You might approach the topic this way: Don't TELL us which characters are static or dynamic, but rather SHOW us. Ever heard the phrase, "The more things change, the more they stay the same"? Your answers are correct, but answer the question with this (and use your own words): Abigail Williams, Rebecca Nurse and Rev. Parris represent the unchanging, uncompromising rigidity of Puritan thought and belief; but it is this rigidity that is uncommon when compared to the 'anything goes' attitude of the 'witch hunts' of the 1950's. (This is, by the way, what the play is about: the Communist 'Red Scare' of Sen. Joseph McCarthy) This is how they are dynamic. Rev. Hale, John and Elizabeth Proctor undergo profound shifts of thought during the events of the story, but perhaps, one could argue, this is their nature; to constantly change. This is how they stay the same, we would expect nothing less of them. If they stopped being overly dramatic and emotional during the course of the story, the audience would notice uncharacteristic halt and not believe these players in the story... (take it from there) Good Luck!

That is -5 = -4 - 1, -4 = -3 -1, etc.  So,     second coordinate = (first coordinate - 1)^3.  Therefore,    y = f(x) = (x - 1)^3    These types of problems require you to look for a pattern that connects the first coordinate with the second coordinate.  Ask yourself the question, what can I do to the first coordinate to obtain the second coordinate.  Do I add something, substract something, mult by something, raise something to a power or even a combination of these operations.  Your problem required a subtraction (1) and a raising to a power (3).  Good luck.

Having this disorder is nothing to sneeze at. Perhaps suggest to your parents that you do a trial period with the Ritalin, or whatever the doctor agrees to.     Then, turn off the TV. Then set small goals for yourself. For example, I'll work on my homework 30 minutes, then take a 10 minute break - and the another 30, on and on, until the work is done. Or your goals can be getting so many steps of your homework done, then take a break. The breaks are rewards for yourself. But you need to use self-discipline to do it. Just remember you are doing this for yourself|`|AA10568066	Get more sleep.|`|ec2bd412405fc32c1451cf07731a6e42aa	Don't say, "Okay, tomorrow I'll do this." Instead, say, "Right now I'll do this."    If you don't want to do it now, why do you think you'll want to do it tomorrow? Just do it and get it out of the way. That's what I do.    Also, shut off the tv. Maybe even go to the library, where you know you can't be tempted by entertainment.    Consider moving to lower level classes, too. You might be in classes that are too difficult for you.    Also, create a schedule for yourself. Allow at least 2 hours for homework and studying. Also allow 2 hours of relaxation/tv time.|`|7271178194fe268f4d082e0f8576afa4aa	This phenomenon is pretty common but it went away when I stopped smoking....Make sure you are eating breakfast every morning.  Taking a multivitamin is a pretty good idea too.  Are you sleeping  6-8 hours each night?  As for the homework, if you have the opportunity to schedule study hall as your last class, you can get most of it done there.
