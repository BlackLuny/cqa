XOWf6JGQaa	Join the military, there is absolutly no reason to be living with your parents right now i mean come on im 17 years old and on my own. There are many options so you can find a job you like and most of the branches let you pick your job before you sign the contract. Basic training is very easy especially in the navy and the air force. I jopined the Navy in October 08 and am very happy with my decision. It would give you time to grow up a little and after you get out you can use your GI bill to finish college if you want. hope this helps.|`|ql7pD8Hhaa	Yes make money here:<br>  <a href="http://survivetherecession.media.officelive.com/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://survivetherecession.media.officel...</a>|`|0lCnu1g2aa	Finish the degree.

But the bulk of the extra cash should go directly to the credit cards.  Paying the minmum due or near it is going to prolong the payoff substantially.  The interest rate you're paying on those credit cards is way more than what you would make in a savings account.|`|zLoyo24Taa	Pay off the credit cards, your paying a lot in interest.

You want to put money in a savings account that is earning .025 and owe credit cards charging you 9 to 18% that is fiscal stupidity.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	Whatever you do, do not ever close up those accounts.<br>  Legth of credit history is a big part of your credit rating.<br>  <br>  Since you cut up your credit cards, now you don't have anything to fall back on if you lose your job or if an emergency happened.<br>  If you would have kept them intact, you could have paid them off without having savings.<br>  <br>  Now, since you can use credit, you need to save in case an emergency happens.<br>  I like to see everyone with at least 3 months salary.<br>  A car could break down, a medical thing might come up, a loss of job could happen.<br>  <br>  If you could have paid those cards off you would see your score skyrocket.<br>  /
AA10572056	COGS includes the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company. This amount includes the materials cost used in creating the goods along with the direct labor costs used to produce the good. It excludes indirect expenses such as distribution costs and sales force costs. COGS appears on the income statement and can be deducted from revenue to calculate a company's gross margin.  <br>  <br>  Basically, take everything it costs to make the product(say $50) and subtract it from what you sold the item for ($100), COGS = $50.  Now you need to subtract the costs of the sales, distribution, insurance, vehicles, rent, packaging, etc. and then you can tell if you are making a living (different from making a profit)|`|5K0eYC35aa	idk but i learned about that last year and didnt get it .

The bank did not come up with the asking price of $350 the occupants did, but the bank MUST approve the offer.

The only thing you can do is to co-sign for him and you put your car up for collateral.  But be warned.  Another term for co-signing is co-buying.

If you were unable to pay what you owe by the instalments agreed or ordered, then they could go back to court and ask the court to order the sale of the property.<br>  <br>  Also if you were made bankrupt, the Trustee in Bankruptcy could require the sale of the property to pay your debts.|`|zI2KS0HOaa	As Lisa says, by not paying your property taxes.  But there are also other ways of acquiring liens on your property, such as when workman do a job for you on your house and you do not pay your bills.<br>  <br>  Pay your bills (to contractors and to the government) and you should be fine.
AA11284831	Comparing your refund to someone else's is like comparing chainsaws and tennis balls.  You can't compare the two.  Every taxpayer's tax return is unique.  <br>  <br>  If someone else had exactly the same  income as you did and received a refund of $1,000 vs your $450, they simply had about $10 more per week withheld from their pay than you did.  That would equate to your claiming 1 allowance and their claiming 0.  In the end, you BOTH received EXACTLY the same amount of money; you just got yours every payday while they had to wait up to a year for theirs.|`|RgSe8u1gaa	It could be a lot of things.  The first thing that comes to mind is you do not have any deductions.  Do they own their home?  The interest is a deduction.  Children or other dependents?  All these things reduce the amount of tax you owe.  Therefore, when the IRS says, you are X (Single, married, head of household), you make X, your tax will be Y.  When you take in to consideration things like a house and dependents..it reduces Y.  A single mother with a house and a kid will pay less tax than a Married couple with no house and kid.|`|ybSs3BiKaa	It depends on deduction dependents etc. and how much you have taken outta your check last year|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Comparing yourself to others is futile.

bf420b0aeac394f3c7221fd12f9c7ebbaa	I did notice that McCain wasn't talking about Social Security privatization during his campaign.|`|zI2KS0HOaa	Despite the recent market drop, if my Social Security contributions had been invested in the S&P 500 index every payday, instead of being handed to the government, I would be MUCH better off.  (And the market will recover, while the government will still be... the government.)<br>  <br>  I have run the numbers -- based on the SS statement they send me from the government.  You might want to do the same thing as an experiment.  If you have been contributing for more than 10 years, and particularly if you make more than the median salary, you will probably find the same thing is true for you.|`|ODGWM7vUaa	Nope, you're right its the same Wall Street. <br>  <br>  The thing is that back in the early 2000's our government and the private sector thought the biggest problem facing our nation was an unfunded Social Security. (Man how things have changed) and many experts believed that the private sector could provided that service more efficiently.<br>  <br>  It seems we are not going to hear any proposal about S.S reform in a while.|`|d46b9fd80ce5d074ba7fa3ce9e65d025aa	Remember, though, that our Social Security funds HAD been invested in stocks, then you would have a situation where a hugh flood of money is chasing after a finite number of stocks.<br>  <br>  When that happens, prices rise.  So the DOW would have hit 20,000, not 14,000 before this particular bubble burst.  And since one of the biggest things going on is people exiting the market in droves, with the SS being STUCK in the market, the bubble might not be bursting today if we had done what Pres. Bush thought to do.<br>  <br>  THAT BEING SAID......  You don't get something for nothing;  As the boomers retire, THEN the money would leave the stock market, driving prices down.  This would produce a bear market, which, as more boomers retired, would just get worse and worse.  Of course, this could still happen, due to all those 401(k) accounts (or 201(k), as I call them, soon to be a 101(k).)<br>  <br>  The Bush plan was flawed from the beginning, due to basic economics.

The Republicans spent the trust fund to give the rich huge tax breaks by counting the trust fund as current revenues. <br>  <br>  Very soon those excess contributions start to decline as the boomers retire. There will soon be less money for them to steal. That is the first crisis that occurs even before the government has to pay back all the money they borrowed from the trust fund. <br>  <br>  The general budget is where the problem is and that starts to happen in the next few years.

LOL<br>  <br>  I think the flipping houses shows are going to be on the back burner if they ever come back, as the market just isn't like it was when these shows were produced.  Now, the shows are geared towards bus tours that show foreclosed homes, owners who are facing foreclosure so they get 10k to fix up their place to see if they can sell or refi etc.  <br>  <br>  I am sure with his bigger than life personality and ego, he is still driving something!

AHCelSY1aa	You can report exactly what you just wrote.  You didn't quit your job.  it was sold to new owners and they required a drivers license to keep your job.  You lost the job through no fault of your own since it obviously was not a requirement under the old ownership.  The same happened to my niece who lives out in Cali.

This is quite common in sororities and fraternities at colleges.<br>  I personally have never heard of hazing in a workplace, however. You may not wish to continue working at wherever it is because your 'manager' appears to be turning a blind eye to inappropriate activity. Better yet, sue them if you feel you were treated inappropriately - and then move on to a new job.

fMBREYmNaa	I get my life insurance from sbliusa, there pretty good|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Get level term insurance policies.  That gives you the most "bang for the buck."  Whole life insurance is a lousy idea.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Yes.  Get Term life only.  <br>  <br>  Life insurance should be thought of as income replacement if someone dies.  Don't let them sell you any other type like Whole Life or Variable Life.  Insurance products typically make horrible investment vehicles.<br>  <br>  For the difference you'd pay in premiums, you could invest that extra monthly amount in an investment vehicle of your choice at far more favorable terms.<br>  <br>  As for where to shop, there are lots of web sites that will shop around for you for a policy.  Places like insurance.com or einsurance.com, etc.  Just google "Life Insurance" and you'll probably get many hits.|`|U7nj9Kg4aa	You need to contact an insurance broker who has access to both whole life and term life.<br>  <br>  It's impossible for anyone to give you an absolute answer without knowing the reasons for why you are buying it.  And all these "Buy term only" people clearly don't understand why there are the 2 different types of insurance...they are for 2 distinct purposes.  For all you "Buy Term only and invest the rest" folks:  With the down turn in the markets right now, how is that plan working out for the 60-70 year olds out there who now have no insurance and their investments are worth 50-75% less than they planned?  Short answer:  It's not working!  That's why that strategey isn't all it's cracked up to be!  Good for some, but not a once size fits all.<br>  <br>  If you are looking at protecting a short term need that will eventually go away (IE: a mortgage, putting the kids through school, etc), term is what you need.<br>  <br>  If you are looking at protecting a long term need that will not go away (IE: estate taxes/fees, funeral expenses, etc), whole life is what you need.  And regarding the cost, at your age it won't be much at all.<br>  <br>  Get unbiased advice from a broker who can go over the pro's and cons of both with your for your situation.|`|zI2KS0HOaa	The short version:  Buy term life, shop around, and don't buy more (or less) than you need.<br>  <br>  There are calculators, and a wealth of other information, at places like SmartMoney:<br>  <a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/personal-finance/insurance/" rel="nofollow">http://www.smartmoney.com/personal-finan...</a><br>  <br>  Start here:<br>  <a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/personal-finance/insurance/which-life-insurance-is-best-16975/" rel="nofollow">http://www.smartmoney.com/personal-finan...</a><br>  <br>  With the 'how much to get' calculator here:<br>  <a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/personal-finance/insurance/how-much-life-insurance-do-you-need-12949/" rel="nofollow">http://www.smartmoney.com/personal-finan...</a>|`|G9rUYQqJaa	I suggest looking into supplemental life insurance through your employer.  You can usually get decent amount at a low cost.  For example my wife pays $6 a month for $100K and I pay $5 a month for $100K.   Its more than enough given we don't have kids.<br>  <br>  Life insurance costs continue to go down, do I'd wait until you are pregnant or are planning to soon.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise its a waste given your odds of passing, your age and the fact you have no kids.  <br>  <br>  Cost of life insurance doesn't really start to go up until your mid 30s.  Plus a 30 year term...you'll be 52 when it expires.|`|cTA9kWWfaa	You need to sit down with someone. I work for New York Life and we have over 26 Life insurance products so we CUSTOMIZE every policy. There is no one single answer like these term people think. And for investing the difference, what savings vehicle is producing 5% return AFTER taxes? O wait, its my whole life insurance policy. If you are in California let me know and I can help you out, otherwise call a local New York Life office and someone will help you out.|`|pRibsCSXaa	The key is to sit with someone who is licensed to explain all of the different products that are available to you.  Life insurance can be one of the most important things you ever buy.  Why listen to people not licensed to even discuss your options?  There's a reason you need to have a life insurance license.<br>  <br>  Anyone that tells you one type is better than another, without knowing anything about is worthless.  Find an adviser who you can trust.  There's too much misinformation out there to trust wannabes.|`|xb255X0faa	Before my wife and I had kids we had a house and didn't really have any life insurance.  We decided that if something should happen to either of us we wouldn't want to stay in the house and we had enough savings and equity to just sell the house.  We both worked and could survive on our incomes.  <br>  <br>  If either of you want to keep the house then you should have enough life insurance to pay off the mortgage and provide any supplemental income necessary to live on above your individual incomes.  <br>  <br>  If you are both relatively healthy I would find a 20 or 30 year term life quote on an online quote engine like zanderins.com, insure.com or accuquote.com.  If either of you have any questionable professions or health history you should probably find yourselves a high powered agent in your area that can quote multiple companies and knows how to find the best rates given your health history.  Just be sure you go with an AM Best "A" or better rated company.|`|uRqlSq6caa	Get term life.  Any of the cash value are rip offs.

It also builds a guaranteed cash value which will equal the face amount of the policy at age 100. So if you have coverage of $100,000 and you are still alive at age 100, the insurance company will void your life insurance policy and pay you $100,000.<br>  <br>  Premiums remain level and there are 3 ways you can pay your premiums. The most common way is called "Straight Life" or "Continuous Premium Whole Life." This is where you premiums continuously until you die or when you reach age 100.<br>  <br>  The second way is called "Limited Pay." This is where you pay a higher amount of premiums than Straight Life for a certain amount of time. Examples of this are "20-Pay Life" or "Life Paid at 60." With "20-Pay Life" you pay your premiums for 20 years. "Life paid at 60" means you pay your premiums until you reach 60 years old. The shorter the payment period, the higher the premiums and vice versa.<br>  <br>  The third way is called "Single Premium Whole Life." This is where you pay one lump of premium and never have to pay it again.<br>  <br>  As I mentioned earlier, Whole life insurance builds cash value. You can borrow it anytime and use it for any purpose. The question is "what is this borrowing part all about?" Isn't the savings suppose to be your money? The answer is no. The premiums you pay belongs to the insurance company.<br>  <br>  If you want to take money out from your life insurance, you have to borrow it. The insurance company will charge you a loan interest of anywhere between 5-8%. But in the first 2 years of the policy, no cash value is accumulated. So there's nothing you can borrow during that time. After the first 2 years, you are guaranteed an interest rate between 1-3%. When you borrow money from the cash value, your death benefit is reduced by the amount you borrowed, but the premiums remain the same. Interest charged on the amount you borrowed does not go back into your cash value. It goes directly to the insurance company.<br>  <br>  If you die someday, the insurance company keeps your cash value and pays the death benefit only.<br>  <br>  If someday, you decide you want to cancel your whole life policy, you will get most of your cash value. When you cancel your life policy, the insurance company may charge you a surrender charge on your cash value. If you borrowed money from your cash value, it is important that you pay this loan back before canceling the policy. Failure to do so will result in income tax on the loan amount.<br>  <br>  In summary, here are the pros and cons of whole life insurance:<br>  PROS<br>  1) You are guaranteed coverage until you die or reach age 100, whichever is first.<br>  2) Premiums remain level.<br>  3) It builds cash value.<br>  <br>  CONS<br>  1) It builds cash value, which makes this type of life policy very expensive.<br>  2) Cash value grows at a low rate of return<br>  3) If you want to use the cash value, you have to borrow it and pay loan interest of 5-8%<br>  4) If you die, the insurance company keeps your cash value.<br>  <br>  Term insurance is designed to provide death protection for a definite and limited period of time such as One Year Term, Five Year Term, 30 year Term, or Term to 65. If the insured dies during the term, the policy matures and the insurance company pays the face amount of the policy to the beneficiary. If the insured doesn't die during the term, the policy expires.<br>  <br>  The second most important characteristic of Term insurance is that it is pure insurance. You pay premiums only for the coverage. Since there are no forced savings or cash value attached to Term insurance, it is designed to provide the greatest possible protection for the lowest possible cost. Therefore, the two key points to remember about Term insurance are that if offers (1) protection only for a (2) a specified period of time.<br>  <br>  One of the most widely marketed forms of Term insurance is Annually Renewable Term (ART). The insurance company grants the insured the right to renew the policy each year to a stated date or age. The cost to renew the policy goes up each year because the rates are based on the insured's attained or current age.<br>  <br>  The increasing in premiums can present a real problem for the insuring public. One Term product that provides a partial solution to the rising costs is Level Premium Term. With a policy of l0ng duration, the payment may be leveled out over the life of the policy to create Level Premium Term. The cost of Level Premium Term is calculated by price of the early years by the price of the later years. So in the beginning, you are making an overpayment of what the actual cost of insurance is. But in the later years, you are making an underpayment of what the actual cost of the insurance is. Why? Because the cost to insure someone is young is low compare to the cost of insuring someone who is old.<br>  <br>  Term insurance, then, in any of its many forms, is the most affordable protection available for thw premium

5N3odm3Qaa	First you should understand that to practice psychology, one must go to graduate school after college and get a PhD or PsyD (both take four years). To earn your PhD you will have to compose a dissertation that can easily exceed 150 pages (of your own research). If you want to go into psychiatry, you'll need four years of medical school, four years of residency, and several more if you plan to go into a specialized field like psychoanalysis. Both types of graduate schooling are expensive, with an average total cost exceeding $200,000 right now (and increasing by about 3% every year).<br>  <br>  In high school there is very little you can do to be prepared for a psychology major. What you'll learn in the psych classes won't really do much, if anything at all. Sure, it looks good on your college applications, but when you get to college you'll take an intro course and that's where you will establish your foundation. <br>  <br>  As far as which fields earn the most and which do not -- it doesn't matter. If you don't like it, you won't do it. Trust me, you can't force yourself to go through the hell it takes to get these degrees if you don't like what you're doing. "Interesting" is way too subjective to define for you. What I find engrossing might be the most boring stuff on the planet to someone else. For example: I feel that dermatology would be the most boring field of medicine for my tastes. Meanwhile, thousands of medical students clamor for those coveted residencies every year. There's something out there for everyone.<br>  <br>  The general trend is that private practice will net you the largest income (all things relative) and working with kids has the lowest income potential. I have heard that industrial/organizational psychology pays the best but it is absolutely the driest, most boring field of psych on the planet. Psychologists trained in psychoanalysis (several years of training beyond grad school) can command larger incomes. <br>  <br>  Bottom line: very few (if any) psychologists will ever earn anywhere near $200,000. A reasonably well-credentialed PhD with at least 10 years of experience can command $120,000-150,000 with a private practice in a good area. What you'll earn in East Nowhere, TN is not what you would earn in Philadelphia or Boston. Teaching at a university is also a good way to earn some money when you're new and the jobs for which you are qualified would pay considerably less (about $40,000).<br>  <br>  Never go into a health care field for the money. In the end, it is NOT worth the time, expense, and stress. If you don't genuinely love what you're doing, forget the whole thing and find something else.|`|l5Q8lq35aa	Psychology takes a LONG time. Since a psychologist/psychiatrist<br>  is a type of doctor, you'll need a Ph.D., which required 8 yrs. + in<br>  school. Plus, it's not in high demand for the future, and it won't<br>  get you a job if you're in an emergency. Maybe look into become a<br>  different type of doctor if that's what you're into. My sister is<br>  a pharmacist, and it only took her 2 years after university. She LOVES<br>  her job and is glad she went through all of that dreadful medical school.

020c8b995f845d51e6a78d1ec529d405aa	If you wash your hair, brush your teeth, wash your clothes etc there is no way you won't use the 35 base points needed each month.  You do NOT sell any products by the way.  You can be a preferred customer and just use the products or you can do it as a business.  If you do it as a business all you are looking to do is to sign people up who would like to use the products and you sign them up so they order the products themself.  No selling, no inventory, no delivery no nothing.  The people order their own products each month.  If you are serious about it as a business you do want to try to get people who would also like to build a business but again no selling just signing people up.  The cost is only $29 to join and a yearly fee of $12.  The products are awesome.  You will be so much healthier and get sick very little once you make the switch.

So far I've gotten a check cut every 15th of the month since I've been in.  I've been doing it for 3 months and LOVE IT!  I just didn't want you to get confused about selling because that's not how it works.  You shouldn't be afraid of your monthly order.  You go to the store anyhow and buy products for your house that are toxic, so why not buy them from yourself and stop polluting your household and have them delivered right to your door.

They can use it to see how responsible you are and they in turn relate it to how responsible you may be on the job.  In addition, they sometimes use your driving record to determine how responsible you are.  Some employers are required to use credit reports because of the type of company they are.  For example, if you are applying for a stock brokerage firm or a bank, they may deny you employment if they see if you have financial problems.  They simply don't want to risk having their assets possibly stolen or fraudulent transactions occurring so you can pay your own debt.  Unfortunately, if you are a honest person, your credit report can ultimately harm you when applying for a job because they base everything on what they see on the report and not who you really are.

8ruwONI2aa	I know it's overwhelming right now to have to worry about finances when you should be focusing on your physical and emotional recovery.  The great news is that you live in a country where you can get the best and most reliable health care.  You didn't have to worry that the doctor wasn't qualified, that the procedure wasn't safe, that the needles might be dirty.  You had peace of mind that you'd be taken care of--and you were.  And now you must pay for it.  Thank goodness your insurance will cover much of the cost.  Even if it takes years to pay off, those are years you will be alive and healthy, living without infection, and moving on with your life.  That is more than most women in the world and in history can say after having a miscarriage.|`|LHwNDmV4aa	I've been in the same boat with medical bills. Set up a payment plan with the hospital.

I dont know how you are paying your bills currently but the first step that I would take is to sit down and write out how much you spend in a month.  Make a list of everything that you spend money on in a month.  then from that list see if there are things that you might be able to cut down on or cut out completely.  Also using other money saving techniques such as coupons and money saving recipes etc.  Now this will not give you a immediate supply of cash to buy a house so you may want to consider a loan or perhaps your best bet would be to get a job because if you are making it ok now without a job if you had a job you should be able to save more money faster.

A new agent usually gets a split of 60/40 until they make 75,000 for the office. We just started doing this. After they have made 75,000 for the office they go to a 90/10 split.  We do not charge any fee's for the agent to buy or sell property. I have worked in another office and the splits are very similar to ours for new agents.

8ruwONI2aa	The absolute most important thing for you to do is make sure you are saving enough for you and your husband in retirement.  The best gift you can give your kids is not having to take care of you in your old age.  They will not appreciate that you paid for college when they have to spend their entire adult lives paying for your health care and housing costs!  <br>  <br>  1.  Make sure you pay enough for good health, disability, and life insurance.  <br>  <br>  2.  Make sure you save 10-15% of your income in tax advantaged retirement accounts.  <br>  <br>  3.  Make sure you have 6 months expenses in cash set aside.<br>  <br>  4.  Make sure you own your own home and are on track to pay it off by the time you retire.  <br>  <br>  5.  THEN start setting aside money for each child for college.  Use a 529 plan or a Roth IRA (with a Roth you can use the money for tuition penalty/tax free, but if your kids get scholarships/grants you can also keep the money for retirement or other expenses).|`|AA12337032	put like 50 dollars away for each kid a month|`|A3BfneIxaa	I opened an account with www.upromise.com and I have saved over $600 in two years without changing my purchasing habits.

The money is an outgrowth of normal purchases I would have made anyhow.<br>  <br>  Just for reference I got the Upromise credit card issued by Citibank last year and pay it off monthly.

Reinforce the importance of academics and school.  Make sure they work hard in high school, get good grades, and take AP or IB courses which may count as college credit but cost a fraction.  There are thousands of scholarships out there that they should be applying for when they reach high school, all you have to do is look and talk to the guidance counselors.  I know they aren't in high school yet or even close for your 4 year old but its never to early to think about it.|`|UryACfe6aa	Save every penny that they're given as gifts.

8ruwONI2aa	You IRA funds should never be in a CD unless you are already in retirement!!  And even then only a small portion of your IRA should be in cash (CDs).  Besides, right now even savings accounts and money markets are outperforming CDs.  CDs aren't even keeping up with inflation!  You will LOSE purchasing power (money) if you "invest" in CDs right now!<br>  <br>  Your IRA should consist of a broad diversification of US and international stocks.  You may also have a small portion in bonds if you are within 10-15 years of retirement.  <br>  <br>  Credit unions and banks are not usually good places to have an IRA because they have few investment options and charge high annual fees, commissions, and investment fees.  Don't let your bank/credit union sell you an IRA.  I'm a banker; I know how this works.  I would never have my investments at a bank (even the one I work for which I love and respect).<br>  <br>  You should have your IRA at a reputable investment firm that offers a wide range of high quality, low cost investment options.  That sounds like a gimmick, but it's not.  Vanguard and Fidelity are the low-cost leaders of retirement investing--and their funds are consistently top rated.  Put your money there, buy a cheap index fund or target retirement fund, and rest easy.|`|AA10229700	No Risks at all and very little room for growth once inflation is factored in if you don't need this money for 7 or more years you would be much better putting that IRA into a index fund like the S & P 500 and if it was in the stock market this is not the best time to move this money as the market has been down several % in the last week but remeber the market has always out proformed every other investment instrument in history|`|AA11600282	Liz is right.  I also am a banker and have the same feelings.  If you aren't retired there is no sense in having those funds in a CD.  Liz made very good points that don't need to be repeated.|`|TV7Q7hmBaa	My funds are in Treasury Notes.  The principal is secure, the interest checks are regularly deposited, and, to offset a lower interest rate(which may go up) this interest money is State tax free.  I had money in a well reputed mutual fund, and lost exactly one third of it, before I sold out.  Lesson learned.  When you deal with a brokerage firm ,there is a fee both to buy and to sell.  You can buy your own treasury Notes without this charge, over the phone.  Strongly advise caution with your funds, as the stock market is tricky, just check the last week's reports.   Best wishes.

You don't know how nice it is to be able to pick up and go on a 3 day vacation without answering to anyone or hoping you have enough vacation time at your job! Second advantage is the tax write-offs! You can write off dining out, mileage and a whole slew of other expenses the average joe paycheck to paycheck, working for the man person can't! Third benefit is at the end of the day the money is all yours! You're not working your butt off for a company and seeing a fraction of a percentage of that money coming back to you in your paycheck! Fourth, you can actually make a whole lot more money than what you are now!

Both what forwards and may not forward your business.<br>  <br>  3) You work for your vision, not someone elses.<br>  <br>  4) You are detached from the 9 to 5 mindset that many employees have.

It is really up to you the outlook you have day by day if you are working for someone else or if you are an entrepreneur.|`|e57e143dde9c3b103adfbd856ad6581caa	Good answers so far. Here's mine.<br>  <br>  You are controlling your own destiny.<br>  <br>  You get flexibility to be able to do the non work related things in life, especially good if you have a family.<br>  <br>  You have something to show for yourself once all is said and done. Not too many people will be able to list starting and maintaining a successful business as things they accomplished in their lifetimes, this can even be passed to your children.<br>  <br>  Some individuals and companies like to do business with small business. They don't like to support the "big guys" as money spent at a small business is more likely to stay in the community rather than shipped off to the corporate office in some other state.

3e2b9ea096850acd915f2d955601a470aa	Antes q nada debes saber que cada comienzo de a?o se hace un presupuesto del gasto que se va a realizar por parte del gobierno federal para el sosten del pais, en base a dicho presupuesto y gastos previstos, como salud, escuelas, servicios, etc, se planea de dónde se va a obtener ese dinero para realizar todos los planes que se ha fijado. Y por ello se genera una ley llamada ley de ingresos de la federación con el a?o al cual corresponda, 2006 o 2007, etc.<br>  En dicha ley se estipula el presupuesto del gobierno y su plan para recaudarlo.<br>  El gobierno, tiene una secretaría llamada de Hacienda y Crédito Público, misma que le auxilia a la recaudación de impuestos, ya sea persiguiendo a los contribuyente q si pagan para verificar  que en efecto han pagado bien, o a los contribuyentes que no pagan y evitan pagar a toda costa, porque no quieren entrar en la legalidad. Debes saber que no todos en méxico pagan impuestos, se les conoce como evasores fiscales, a pesar de que nuestra constitución de los estados unidos mexicanos asi lo contemple. Sin embargo el gobierno federal ya está trabajando en ellos para que todos contribuyamos al gasto público. <br>  <br>  Existen diferentes tipos de impuestos, cada uno es diferente y se paga por diferentes motivos y por diferentes sujetos, en mexico se divide en personas morales (empresas) y personas físicas (sujetos q no son empresas y que obtienen ingresos por alguna activida que la ley contemple que por ella se tenga q pagar impuesto). <br>  El ciudadano necesita estar dentro del supuesto de la norma para poder aplicarla y pagar conforme a ésta. Casi todo el peso del pago de las contribuciones recae sobre los trabajadores asalariados, quienen pagan Impuesto Sobre la Renta , (impuesto que se paga por el ingreso que obtienen por el producto de su trabajo), así también pagan una cuota del seguro social (una institucion se asistencia de salud pública, que para tener acceso a esta hay que pagar una cuota) Estos impuestos son descontados del salario del trabajador de manera proporcional a cuanto gane, si gana menos paga menos impuesto, si gana más paga más impuesto, esto es descontado por el patrón o empleador y éste lo debe de entregar al gobierno federal para que este lo gaste o distribuya conforme lo tiene planeado.<br>  Los trabajadores asalariados o bajo nómina se les conoce como contribuyentes cautivos, pues ya se tienen fiscalizados y no pueden eludir su responsabilidad de pagar los impuestos que les correspondan. <br>  Las empresas también pagan una buena parte de los impuestos, por los ingresos que obtengan por sus actividades, estas pagan un 28% sobre el total de sus ingresos, habiendole restado unas cantidades llamadas deducciones que la misma ley permite en ciertos casos, es decir asi como uno obtiene ingresos tambien uno gasta y esto lo considera la ley y lo permite deducir o restar de esa formal. La tasa del 28% que te comento cada a?o va disminuyendo un punto. Sin embargo la cultura mexicana es muy tramposa, y hacen que las empresas tengan pérdidas financieras, para no pagar impuestos, o crean muchas empresas y juegan a realizar operaciones entre estas para que generen mas gastos q impuestos y asi no tengan ganancia sobre la cual pagar.<br>  Hay otro impuesto que lo pagan tanto personas morales como fisicas, asi tambien las no contribuyentes que es el IVA, mismo que se paga por la realizacion de determinadas actividades q la ley contempla, y que regularmente es el que se paga por cuando nos prestan un servicio y somos nosotros los ultimos consumidores de dicho servicio, cuando nos venden alimentos,  somos los últimos consumidores, etc. Ejemplo es muy parecido al tax que se paga en EUA, pero aqui es a la tasa del 15%.<br>  <br>  Es muy complicado explicar como funciona la recaudación en méxico, en unas cuantas lineas, es un tema muy interesante y muy amplio, con esto espero haberte orientado un poco, si no, pues ya te amplie más tus dudas, jejeje<br>  <br>  buen dia<br>  saludos|`|b1b27487ed5a0da589d24e3602d5129faa	Fácil, cobrándole a todos los clientes cautivos principalmente a los trabajadores, pues los ricos no pagan impuestos todo lo deducen de gastos de sus empresas, pero si cobraran un solo impuesto todos pagaríamos impuestos pero de acuerdo a lo que consumimos, y por nuestro poder adquisitivo.por lo tanto pagaria más el que más tiene.|`|63a714b605099f7e13144b8c73a4b992aa	Hola<br>  <br>  Para empezar, tenemos diferentes tipo de impuestos, tales como: el Impuesto al Valor Agregado (IVA), el Impuesto Sobre la Renta (ISR), el impuesto al Activo (IMPAC), etc, etc. Algunos son directos y otros son indirectos; los directos son los que pagan las empresas o las personas, directamente al fisco (hacienda), y los indirectos son aquellos que se retienen a terceras personas por medio de las empresas.<br>  <br>  Por ejemplo: el ISR que es un impuesto directo, se calcula con base a los ingresos o ventas y se paga directamente al fisco; no asì el IVA, el cual fuciona de otra forma. Existe un IVA que se paga al momento de hacer una compra (IVA acreditable) y existe otro IVA que se cobra al momento de hacer una venta (IVA trasladado), a groso modo, este impuesto se paga sacando la diferencia entre el IVA trasladado y el IVA acreditable, y ese es el que se le paga al fisco.<br>  <br>  Por otro lado, el RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyente) es una clave de identificación ante las autoridades fiscales. Dicha clave esta compuesta por las iniciales del nombre de una persona o de una empresa, su fecha de nacimiento, en el caso de las personas, y su fecha de inicio de operaciones en el caso de las empresas; asi como una homoclave que asigna la autoridad fiscal. Esta clave es de gran ayuda para el fisco, ya que con ella, va elaborando un expediente de todas y cada una de tus operaciones, tanto de compras, ventas, pago de impuestos, asì como el cumplimiento o incumplimiento de los mismos.<br>  <br>  Espero haber alcarado un poco tu pregunta. <br>  <br>  Saludos|`|9ad9182b45a087265e34a9b44f315a41aa	RFC es como el gobierno te ficha para poder cobrarte,  para poder hacerte auditorías y luego de salir limpias pedirte un apoyo a la causa. También es para hacerte conservar  comida para las termitas por algunos a?o. Te recomiendo que leas los prontuarios fiscales vigentes, es decir del presente a?o, de los a?os anteriores, dependiendo de los ejercicios fiscales que necesites examinar, etc. ahí mismo te da mucha información, además de acercarte a la oficina mas cercana de recaudación fiscal donde te darán toda la información que necesites para obtener tu RFC y como darte de alta, baja, etc.

They can probably set you up with a plan to give you an average rate of return when you set up your IRA.  You can put the money contributed in your ROTH IRA in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETF and watch it grow tax free.  You probably want to ask the broker for a plan to get 8% or higher return rate.|`|1261f754a1783085c7edd6698a407369aa	www.scottrade.com- $500- no fees- call your local Scottrade office and see what the account rep says|`|853da5b561b23a6e2afdfd44db69ce87aa	Many discount brokerages and banks will allow an opending deposit of $50 or less.

It can vary widely, though.  <br>  <br>  Also, many companies will waive or lower that minimum if you enter into an automatic investment plan (like if you sign up to have $50 added to the account each month).  <br>  <br>  I highly recommend Vanguard, but they have a $3000 minimum initial investment.  I think that drops to $1000 if you sign up for automatic investments.
OqCIl735aa	Virginia Chick,<br>  Remember back in the 1990s when a lot of people either retired early or became wealthy? It was relatively simple. With stock prices going up, up, up, I knew a lot of people who simply invested part of their paychecks. They ended up with several hundred thousand dollars in profits from their constantly rising stocks. <br>  <br>  I knew others who had already amassed several hundred thousand by the time the stock boom came along. They were millionaires by the time the 1990s ended. <br>  <br>  Ah yes, those were the days. Today it's a lot harder. Stocks don't seem to do much any more. You have to invest in risky emerging countries to see much return. And that chance can evaporate overnight taking your money with it. <br>  <br>  When the stock market won't bring you any return, most people turn to real estate. But housing prices have peaked in most cities, meaning you can't just buy a house and sit on it for several years to earn a fat nest egg. <br>  <br>  So does that mean we have to give up on ever getting ahead and just learn to be satisfied living the average life our jobs can provide? <br>  <br>  Not necessarily. These days you have to think differently to get ahead. For example, you've noticed how manufacturing and jobs are heading out of North America to foreign countries. That's bad news for many workers, but it's GREAT news for some segments of the Foreign Exchange Market. <br>  <br>  You see, when we buy products from China, or Japan ships products to England, all kinds of currency has to change hands and be converted. There is BIG money in that process. <br>  <br>  FOREX, the foreign exchange market, handles 2 TRILLION in transactions EVERY DAY. That's far more money than what Wall Street handles. Just about anybody can jump in and pull out quite a profit for themselves by participating in the FOREX process. <br>  <br>  Does all this sound a bit new to you? Most North Americans have heard very little about FOREX. They've got BILLIONS of dollars sitting in savings accounts and low yield investments that could make them a LOT more money in the Foreign Exchange Industry. <br>  <br>  Check out more info at: <a href="http://www.yourforexinvestor.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourforexinvestor.com</a><br>  <br>  Subscribe to the group and be a part of an emerging trend that will create countless millionaires in the years to come. <br>  <br>  To Your Success!!<br>  Brandon Wells<br>  877-773-5345|`|8d6ae5a42dddca82be705f10f6b74e58aa	Google Google Google Google<br>  <br>  I predict a 99.9%, repeating of course, probablility that it will go up next week.|`|JUpxtVwVaa	I WANT TO JOIN DISNEY'S STOCK.<br>  because i don't think any child anywhere will get tired of disney. <br>  whooooooooo!

While I exclude myself from applying, perhaps you might like a suggestion for an interesting and satisfying social experiment. <br>  <br>  Set up a company in which the shareholders are actually the stakeholders in the business and the community it operates in. For example, profits are split between the employees and community. This may not equate to straight cash in pocket for employees but could include the building of quality low cost housing to help them get on the propertyladder. If the company grows large enough this could include community housing for the elderly and disabled as well as opening it up to others with price based on income to attract a diverse community rather than the 'ghetto' mentality of public housing. Expand this to include daycare, schooling and healthcare. Can you use what you were given to create, if not a better world,  a self sustaining better corner of the world? I am trying a similar concept with a business in Romania and the sense of being adopted into a community and becoming a part of something so much larger than yourself is truly humbling as you see individual lives transformed and the community develop a collective sense of pride and ownership. If a trust retains a share then as the money is replenished you can repeat in other communities that need regeneration.|`|9apfigLWaa	I am a single mom of two boys (15 and 10) I amdesperately in need of financial assistance and have no where to turn. <br>  <br>  I recently applied for a loan, and to make a long story short, I was scammed and now have outstanding checks for which I can not cover.

I work with senior citizens in the 707 area as patient coordinator many of them really do need help and care but with the cost of healthcare nowadays very few of them can afford such care especially goverment doesn't have any programs for seniors to get medicare pay for it. Many of our old folks end up being on a nursing home which nobody wants to go because of they loose their independence, less attention and care provided, and most of them feel like that's the end of their lives.<br>  If i were chosen to get this grant, we would be able to provide a decent # hours of care to hire caregivers to seniors and help them out with their daily activities. <br>  In my opinion i think that seniors do need more help than homeless adults that are able to work, make money and feed themselves...unlike seniors , frail, weak, helpless..that's where our heart should be helping.

You really want to stop using your credit cards and pay them off in full.  Some of the big finance advisors have articles on this (i.e., Suze Orman) and how to pay off the cards with what you earn.  You can also call the credit card companies and ask for a lower interest rate - frequently they will grant you one if you have an account in good standing - and that will lower the amount of money you ultimately pay back.

That's not going to help you learn to be a productive, responsible adult!  It's just going to cost money you don't have.  <br>  <br>  You need to educate yourself and not be so negative.  Everyone has skills and talents; you just haven't developed yours yet apparently.

About writing a paper..well, taking English will help you with that. You also said you get distracted easily, well I think you should realize that when people rely on you that means they need you. You shouldn't pressure yourself so much because it is your life, you are too hard on yourself. Also, do some research on interview questions. Then you will have the perfect answers. Also smile a lot. My boyfriend and I applied for the same job and I think he got it because he smiled. Next time they ask why do you want to work here, say because you like the work environment and you think you will gain personal growth from working there. Most likely they will ask you that question in person. Our first interviews are always the most sucky ones. BUT they are a lesson learned, for you to be more prepared next time. Also, to be more professional I suggest wearing a suit, have good posture, do not fidget, do not talk of personal matters, and don't forget...smile. :)|`|2f0ffe3a168ac69666e7cda5796852aaaa	If you are having problems focusing, concentrating, continuing conversations, you need to see a Doctor.

Paying extra for American-made products simply doesn't make sense.  Only two options to this problem.  Apply extra tax to foreign products or make U.S. more competitive.  The first option is anti-free trade and will hurt us more in the long term because other countries will retaliate with their own taxes for American-made products.  Second option is to make ourselves more competitive.  Improve education, create a more valuable work force that will produce better products that other countries want.  Then let the free market take care of itself.  Don't give up on capitalism just because other countries are catching up, we're still the strongest economic power in the world.

You regularly work 16-20 hour days and often sleep at the office.  You work weekends, even Sundays usually just to keep up.  You get paid well, but many people get burned out after their 1-2 year stint and change industries entirely--even though they've already made it through the tough part of "paying their dues"!

UryACfe6aa	Leave your 401k alone.  Yes, you may be young but no reason to go backwards in your retirement savings.  Besides, what you borrow from your 401k has to be paid back.<br>  <br>  ROTH Iras, on the other hand, let you take out what you contributed tax and penalty free if you've held them 5 years (not sure on the exact year limit).<br>  <br>  There are many state and federal programs to help first time home buyers.  Check at your local bank or mortgage company or google your state.<br>  <br>  I know that my credit union offered a  "first time buyer" deal too.  <br>  <br>  If you can't fund both the house and the 401k at the same time then reduce your contributions to the 401k for a while until your salary goes up.  Try to put in at least to the company match limit.<br>  <br>  <br>  Warning: 401(k) loans are hazardous to your wealth <br>  Borrowing from your 401(k) plan should be your last solution, not your first, when you need a loan fast. Here's a look at the pros and cons. <br>  By Ginger Applegarth <br>  <br>  It sounds so simple. You need some quick cash because of a financial emergency and you decide to borrow from your 401(k) retirement plan. After all, it's your money and the interest and principal you pay goes back into your account. But as with most financial issues, it's not as simple as it sounds.<br>  <br>  In fact, for most people, borrowing from a 401(k) is not the best solution.<br>  <br>  The rules:<br>  If your 401(k) plan allows loans (most do), you can borrow up to 50% of your vested account balance or $50,000, whichever is less. You usually have a maximum of five years to repay the loan, unless you are borrowing for a first home, which allows a longer payback.<br>  <br>  Before we get into the pros and cons, one caveat up front: If you've got a financial emergency, and your only choice is between borrowing from your 401(k) plan or pulling the money out in a hardship withdrawal before you're age 59 1/2, it's a no-brainer. By all means, borrow the money. That's because there is no penalty on borrowing, but there is a 10% penalty on early distributions.<br>  <br>  Now, let's go through the pros and cons of borrowing from your 401(k).<br>  <br>  The pros:<br>  There is no credit check. You don't have to apply for the loan, and you can make plans knowing that you will get the loan.<br>  There is a low interest rate. You pay the rate set by the plan, usually a couple of percentage points above the prime rate.<br>  It provides a great return. If your money market account is earning 3% and you pay yourself back at 6% or 7%, it looks like a good deal.<br>  The interest is tax-sheltered. You don't have to pay taxes on the interest until retirement, when you take money out of the plan.<br>  It's convenient. Some plans only require you to make a phone call, while others require a short loan form.<br>  <br>  The cons:<br>  About that credit check: Of course there isn't one. You're not borrowing anything. You're spending your own money.<br>  You're losing interest. The net effect is that you have less money to invest and to earn interest. The money you borrow -- or take out -- of your retirement plan no longer appreciates in value from interest, dividends and/or capital gains in conjunction with the rest of your investment portfolio. Remember that you aren't really borrowing. All you are doing is using money from one account, such as your checking or savings account, to repay the money you borrowed from your 401(k). And when you take money out of that checking or savings account, that money loses interest, too.<br>  It's not tax-sheltered money anymore. Whether you repay the 401(k) loan out of your salary or from a bank account, those payments are all made back into the 401(k) with after-tax dollars. So, let's say your monthly interest payment is $300 and you're in the 28% tax bracket. You'll have to make $416 in gross earnings to make the $300 payment. Then, when you retire and take withdrawals, you pay taxes yet again.<br>  Unless you repay the loan, it is considered a premature distribution. You would owe federal and state income taxes as well as that 10% penalty if you are under age 59 1/2.<br>  The loan isn't tax deductible. It's considered a consumer loan, so there is no tax advantage.<br>  It affects your psychology toward retirement saving. If possible, your retirement money should sit untouched until you retire. It's too easy to get in the habit of dipping into your 401(k) instead of saving for things you need along the way. Keep your 401(k) in a loan free zone.<br>  <br>  The bottom line:<br>  It's better for most people to take out a home-equity loan if they're homeowners. In most cases (unless you're borrowing more than the value of the home), you can deduct the interest on your taxes.<br>  <br>  Another option is to use money currently sitting in a low-interest rate savings account or money market fund.|`|UuVwBOKKaa	I'm afraid you were given bad information.  If you are taking money out of your 401(k), it will be a loan.  You will have to repay it or you will have to pay the 10% fee plus the taxes.<br>  <br>  From the IRS:<br>  <br>  5.3 Pensions and Annuities: Distributions, Early Withdrawals, 10% Additional Tax<br>  <br>  Can I withdraw funds penalty free from my 401(k) plan to purchase my first home?<br>  <br>  If you are under the age of 59 1/2, you cannot withdraw funds from your 401(k) plan to purchase your first home without being subject to a 10 percent additional tax on early distributions from qualified retirement plans. However, depending on the rules for your 401(k) plan, you may be able to borrow money from your 401(k) plan to purchase your first home. Your plan administrator should have written information about your particular plan that explains when you can borrow funds from your 401(k) plan as well as other plan rules.|`|hEnfVh0kaa	If you borrow from 401(k), you will pay yourself back with interest. If you started your 401(k) last year, you probably don't have that much money in it. And if you have difficult time paying morgage and 401(k) at the same time, why would you want to do this? Keep on putting some money in 401(k), and save some money for the house to buy later. People think they are rich, when they have just 20 to 30K in the bank. It really is nothing with current economy, and current housing prices.|`|8ruwONI2aa	I think you mean you started an IRA, not a 401k.  <br>  <br>  You can't just open a 401k; they are offered through your employer--and you usually are only eligible for one if you are a full-time employee.  Plus, the rule you are citing about using the funds for a first home tax/penalty free is true of IRAs.  So since you say you are a young student, you likely do not have a 401k.  You probably opened an IRA.<br>  <br>  Here's the deal with IRAs:<br>  <br>  1.  Using an IRA to save for your first home is a good idea because you can save for your home and not pay taxes on your gains along the way (although it's even better to use it to actually save for retirement).  <br>  <br>  2.  There are two types of IRA--Roth and Traditional.  You should have a Roth because of your age and low tax bracket.  You don't need the tax decuction a Traditional IRA offers.  So I hope you opened a Roth; if not, you really should roll it over into one.  <br>  <br>  3.  You can take your Roth IRA contributions out tax and penalty free anytime--because you already paid income taxes on the money before it went in (unlike a 401k or Traditional IRA).  You can take out your contributions AND the earnings on them tax and penalty free for your first home, to pay for college tuition, if you get disabled, or in case of other special circumstances.  <br>  <br>  As far as home buying goes, you can expect to pay 3-5% of the value of the home in closing costs.  You will pay a lot for property taxes and insurance, too (and HOA dues); get quotes on that before you start looking for a house--you might have to lower your price range because of those other high monthly costs.  <br>  <br>  Do not buy unless you can afford a 30 year fixed rate mortgage.  Don't get sucked into an ARM or some other variable rate mortgage!  You should not let your housing costs (mortgage, insurance, taxes, HOA, utilities) exceed 40% of your income!!  Trust me, you will want to have money to spend on other things--whether it's saving for retirement, vacations, going out, or buying that new pair of shoes.  Don't be a slave to your mortgage!

If you plan on selling it in the near future I would recommend the equity line It is flexible and only requires interest payments.

Otherwise the advantages vary depending on what you are going to do with the money or why you are refinancing.  <br>  <br>  Like if you have a really high interest rate or an ARM or an interest only loan, it might be better to refinance and get a fixed rate while they're low.  But it might not be a good idea to refinance to pull money out of your house to take a trip to Jamaica.  It all depends.

1267c581ab73c6ba3300d6a53dd52d88aa	I am in mortgages and I can tell you the difference between equity and value; it's very simple, don't worry.<br>  The value is the total worth of the house based on either what it can acceptably-to-lenders appraise for if it is being refinanced OR what someone is willing to pay for it if it is being sold off.<br>  If you are keeping the house, you or the court will probably want an appraisal done to understand the home's value or value to the local market.<br>  Once you know the value, Equity = the Value minus anything owed on the home in the form of liens or judgements legally attached to the property address. For example, if your home is worth (Value) $200,000 but you owe a mortgage balance of $100,000 and there is a state tax lien on it from 2001 for $10,000; the Equity remaining equals $200,000 - $100,000 - $10,000 = $90,000. $90,000 would be the equity or "profit" left in the house that would probably need to be "split" somehow if that's the court's determination. Some people then don't have $45,000 laying around to buy out their spouse's half-equity in the home and that might then lead to selling the house and splitting the remaining profit with the spouse or refinancing the home and taking cash-out of $45,000 to payoff the spouse. The spouse who is keeping the house and refinancing it to payoff the other spouse needs to keep in mind whether they have the credit score, mortgage payment history, and/or income to qualify for the new, larger loan without the income of the former spouse.<br>  I Hope this helps. Randy Alessio, eMortgage, 1-800-793-9633.|`|8ruwONI2aa	What you're entitled to in divorce varies greatly from state to state.  And sometimes it doesn't go by the book because you can bargain for things in mediation or with your attorneys and write it up however you want (you get the house, I get the retirement account, etc.).  <br>  <br>  If you bought the house then you might only owe your husband part of the equity IF he significantly contributed to the mortgage payments over the years.   <br>  <br>  But in general, if you and your husband agree to split the equity built during the marriage, you would take your home equity at the time of marriage (appraisal value minus your mortgage amount) and subtract that from the home equity today (same equation).  The house has probably risen in value and hopefully you've paid down the mortgage some as well.

f5b51dcf21b64b372f773659713a3d9eaa	Well, the short answer is it doesn't really work that way.  The world of production and cinematography doesn't have "placement" like many other fields.   Cinematography is a highly competitive environment with too many people (often many with talent) and too few jobs.  Networking, a good reel, a good rep, and ultimately a good agent will get you jobs.   Your friend would do well to get out there and start knocking on doors and looking for the work.   Having trouble (hence your message)......get used to it.  That's what it's like pretty much forever.   There are many successful DP's (I'm talking big feature films) that still have to sit by the phone at times and lament the lack of work.  <br>  <br>  Having a killer reel, poeple who trust you and being able to deliver good work on schedule will, in the end, make work happen.   Good luck to your friend.   Sadly, the odds are against him. <br>  <br>  BTW, simply looking for production companies in the B-to-B pages in St. Louis would probably be far more productive than asking Yahoo groups.   My $.02.

What you need to do is make inquiries at certain times about whether or not you got the job. <br>  <br>  Sending a "thank you" for a job interview smacks of sucking face. It appears sincere when really it's phony. As someone who has interviewed, it doens't impress me. I've never had someone send me one but if it did, I'd find it rather silly. OTOH, someone calling me to check if I made a hiring decision wins big points!! First, it's best to ask when the hiring decision will be made (if they don't tell you up front in the interview.) Wait until the time passes plus a week or two and then call the interviewer. This impresses the interviewer that you really want that job and you're still available! Plus, the interviewer will feel obliged to keep you updated (no, they won't get annoyed!) If a decision is still not made, for whatever reason, ask for the next date. Repeat the procedure again. If it's the thrid time, then politely let them know where you can be reached and forget about them. <br>  <br>  That's how you get the job!<br>  <br>  -- Liam

Buy some nice microphones and monitors.  I have a similiar setup in my house, though it's not commercial--It's just for my use.

W03mbbSFaa	Section 8 is doing their part by terminating the contract and abating (stopping) payment to the landlord.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't pay anymore if the house is in fact that bad off and not due to any of your negligence.  The next step for the landlord since you haven't paid is to serve you an eviction notice for non payment since you are still living there.<br>  <br>  If he does go all the way with the eviction, through court then you will have to appear and state your case.  The court may say however that you should have paid your share of the rent to the court until they could establish a hearing with the landlord to find out what is going on with the lack of repairs.<br>  <br>  If you feel the house is unsafe, then I would move in with a relative or friend as Section 8 suggests and just move on.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|8f712f9d7be6528b8b494aa34d614efdaa	don't pay that landlord anything more. <br>  you can be the best tenant ever but some times you just run into landlords that don't care or are super crabby.

But I wouldn't worry about paying your old one...exspecially b/c of all the problems that he/she refused to fix.

3154a24819d8871b63a572882e45a79aaa	The first problem I have is I don't know if you're the landlord or the tenant, and whether this involves a current dispute of at least some sort (thou I suspect it does).<br>  <br>  Then there exists the issue of responsibility, because the landlord being responsible for anything that belongs to him or her still doesn't mean the landlord has to pay for it or even do anything about it, it just means they have to make a decision in regards to it.<br>  <br>  To answer the question, regular wear and tear, no.<br>  Any wear and tear is an even bigger no!<br>  <br>  The landlord may be responsible for repairs / replacing certain equipments once they no longer work, but it depends if such equipment is part of the agreement or was merely provided as a bonus because there it was and well the tenants use it but now it's broken, oh well.<br>  <br>  Take a washer / dryer set for instance, assume it is included in the agreement of the rental:<br>  The landlord is responsible for keeping the machines in working order, but the landlord doesn't have to run out every single time a little scratch gets in the paint either.<br>  Matter of fact, it could have a sizeable dent in it, so long it works, no big deal.  Yup, it might even leak a little, whatever, so long it's not a major problem, also here is where the landlord's responsibility lies in that the landlord may decide that the problem isn't big enough for concern.<br>  <br>  Once it stops working, if the equipment is part of the agreement, then the landlord is first responsible in determining what caused it, and next responsible for getting it back in working order... That is to say, even if the tenant broke it, it is still the landlord's ultimate responsibility even if the tenant has to pay for it, the tenant may be given the option to seek their own repair or replacement but ultimately it is the landlord's baby, regardless of who is held financially responsible.<br>  <br>  So regardless of ultimate responsibility, either landlord OR tenant may be held financially responsible, depending on circumstances, but yes, the landlord is all responsible lol.|`|AA10143423	yes your land lord is resposible for all repairs, there is such a situation and allowances for normal wear and tear. if your land lord fails to make repairs make sure you request the repairs in writing. and after 72 hours they are not addressed you can hire them to  be repaired and deduct the cost from your rent payment.|`|3e6005367b4b74194eb216362861ba0caa	Be more specific.

UuVwBOKKaa	The Sharpe ratio is excess return divided by the standard deviation of returns.<br>  <br>  Simply, it is how much excess return you get for each additional unit of risk that you assume.|`|AA11263885	The Sharpe ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted performance of an investment asset, or a trading strategy. Since its revision by the original author made in 1994, it is defined as:is the asset return, Rf is the return on a benchmark asset, such as the risk free rate of return, E[R ? Rf] is the expected value of the excess of the asset return over the benchmark return, and \sigma=\sqrt{Var[R-R_f]} is the standard deviation of the excess return.Note, if Rf is a constant risk free return throughout the period, \sqrt{Var[R-R_f]}=\sqrt{Var[R]}. Sharpe′s 1994 revision acknowledged that the risk free rate changes with time, prior to this revision the definition was S = \frac{E[R]-R_f}{\sigma} assuming a constant Rf.<br>  <br>  The Sharpe ratio is used to characterize how well the return of an asset compensates the investor for the risk taken. When comparing two assets each with the expected return E[R] against the same benchmark with return Rf, the asset with the higher Sharpe ratio gives more return for the same risk. Investors are often advised to pick investments with high Sharpe ratios.<br>  <br>  Sharpe ratios, along with Treynor ratios and Jensen's alphas, are often used to rank the performance of portfolio or mutual fund managers.<br>  <br>  This ratio was developed by William Forsyth Sharpe. Sharpe originally called it the "reward-to-variability" ratio before it began being called the Sharpe Ratio by later academics and financial professionals. Recently, the (original) Sharpe ratio has often been challenged with regard to its appropriateness as a fund performance measure during evaluation periods of declining markets.

Start at the beginning and end at the end...sounds silly, but often times when we are in an interview we get nervous and may begin jumping around our story which can cause confusion! Think back to previous jobs and things about them that you want this person to hear. That time when you had to take care of a sticky situation, or how you were able to resolve an irate customer's problem. This will really highlight your skills and if done right will surely impress your interviewer! Remember that being a bank manager isnt just about knowing about bank stuff, its about how you are going to manage your employees. Highlight your personal, organizational and leadership skills by telling about how you headed up an event or fundraiser. Speak clearly and keep and eye on the interviewer...if they are taking a lot of notes, slow down or pause briefly to let them catch up. Its also okay to think about the question for a few secconds before you start answering...just think quetley and dont sit there and say "hmmmm...i dont know, let me think.." And if you have to start off the answer with, "i probably souldnt be telling you this, but.." Keep it to yourself! You wouldnt believe what ive heard in the past!!<br>  Good luck to you! Hope you get the job!!

It also sounds as if you walked out the door on Tuesday without informing your supervisor. Whatever the reason, BEFORE you walk out the door, make sure it is OK with your supervisor.  You should also arrange changes to your schedule before you make the changes.  The schedules are set up so management knows who is working when.  Working off schedule without permission can be non payable time in some states.  This ensures you show up when you are supposed to and do not show up on your time off.  It is like the lunch and break laws.  You have to leave your place of work or it is not a break.  <br>  <br>  You may want to explain to your manager what happened.

AA11402685	First of all if you don't hear from them, then you need to call them. You should keep bugging them until you get a response, whether it be positive or negative. Then you would know. You need to put on your resume under job experience the years that you devoted to being a stay at home mom. Example:  2003-2007 Stay at home Mom/Domestic Engineer. Then you can explain all the jobs you had to do as a stay at home mom. The big misconception is that people perceive stay at home Moms as being lazy. Well, that is far from the truth as you already know. There are many jobs you performed. Accountant, Cook, Health Provider, Maid and so on if you get the drift. Just having that on your resume will spark interest in them to ask. And by all means put that detailed job information down. I am a stay at home Mom and have been for almost 6 years. Not exactly by choice (injury), but regardless, I have many jobs I perform everyday. Good luck...|`|c2105f0bf69fa52f1d7968301b6a545faa	Did you do any volunteer work in that time?

The minute you give them your credit card and personal information you have now opened your computer to unwanted cookies on your hard drive, annoying pop-up windows and if you are on a PC you open your computer to viruses that can wipe you out.<br>  <br>  A lot of work to collect the "reward payments" that payout is not worth the effort over time. You will need to sign up for many types of offers, most of which require you to use a credit card. You start a week trial service with varies types of businesses or services, such as, an Internet service provider, book club, credit monitoring service, etc. to get your reward. If you don't cancel the trial, you end up being charged for the service and each service has different rules about how and when you can cancel. Very cumbersome!<br>  <br>  Since you will need to sign up for at least a dozen offers before you get to $100 in rewards, it's very easy to forget what you have signed up for, or the problems you will have canceling in time to to be charged the full amount. The Cash Create recruiters you see here over exaggerate how much money you can earn because once you've done the high-dollar trials ($8-10 each), you are left with small rewards of a dollar or two. The survey business is not an efficient way to make money and you are more than likely to loose money in the end.

That would be me.  I just couldn't conform to what most people call the "rules" where you get your education, then go to work for someone when and where they say, have to ask for time off every time I wanted to take my kids on vacation or go see their school play, etc.  <br>  I too took the personality quiz and it said that I should be working in a laboratory of some kind.  Perhaps I would have been good at it, but I also would have lost my mind because I would have felt trapped like those little lab mice.<br>  So then I had to look at what my interests and strengths were.  I have always been good at helping people solve problems, and always interested in health.  So I started a home business in the health and wellness industry because I had found a product that I truly saw results with and it came with medical validation. <br>  It gave me the opportunity to work from home, I can talk to people all I want because I work face to face, online and on the telephone.  I really don't have a routine, I make it up as I go along and I feel that I now have the perfect job.  I get paid very well for what I do and will never go into the workforce again.

I am a stay at home mom and looked into several businesses to start a home based Most importantly is that even though I went to school and had a degree, I wanted something that I could spend my time working to make myself money rather than working for someone else.  I checked into several home based business and decided on Mary Kay for several reasons. <Low start up costs, you have HALF of everything that you sell, there are no territories and no quotas so you can do one party a year or one party a day (you choice). There are two ways to make money immediately after becoming a consultant (1) selling the product (2) recruiting (you earn 4-13% commission). <br>  <br>  Mary Kay is and has been the #1 brand of skin care and color cosmetics since 1993 and is 100% guaranteed even after the product is used which makes your customers VERY happy. Customer base is larger because everyone washes their faces and a majority of women wear at least a minimal amount of make-up and this is one business that has products for men. <br>  <br>  The company has been around forever and has a great reputation (as long as you don't push your customers) so the product sells itself and a huge difference than other products is that with Mary Kay everyone goes home and washes the products down the drain which gives you the opportunity to have very loyal customers who will re-order from you frequently.

In order to become a CPA, which is kind of like the course you took..you'd have to be certified and that just means taking more courses and passing their test.  However, with your experience in a bank you should have no problem getting another job and then take those classes and move up.  Don't let anyone tell you that ridiculous muck again :)|`|92d06862014a283d706c0f96b3038582aa	The fact that you studied English at university will have no bearing on your career prospects.<br>  <br>  The big accountancy firms such as KPMG and Deloitte employ graduate trainees each year from a wide background of degree subjects not just accountancy.<br>  <br>  This is because they are much more interested in the quality of your qualifications (ie. your degree class) as opposed to what you have studied and they are also interested in the sort of person that you are.<br>  <br>  My advice to you is to work hard at studying for your ACCA exams as it will be worth it in the long run. Being an ACCA qualified chartered accountant really does open doors!

With the merger, Pennzoil was de-merged with the namesake Pennzoil company remaining in oil exploration and production and Pennzoil Quaker State merging into a new lubrication company.  Post merger, a "old" Pennzoil shareholder would have 1 share of Pennzoil and 1 share of Pennzoil-Quaker State. Pennzoil changed their name to Pennzoil Energy & Production or PennzEnergy for short.  In 1999, PennzEnergy was sold to Devon Energy for $14/share. In 2002, Pennzoil-Quaker State was bought by Shell for US$22/share. <br>  <br>  So in total, you should get about $36/share cash.

How do you weed through them all? Most people that want a quick reward will fall for the schemes and then will get ripped off. But people that realize that if you work hard at what you are doing, have the right frame of mind about what they are doing and have the right tools to get the job done, then you will be successful. Aligning yourself with positive people, successful people who has done what it is that you are trying to do, educating yourself about the business and having the proper mindset are keys to success, I believe.

The Federal Reserve establishes overnight base exchange rates between banks on currency transfers.  <br>  <br>  If you want to exchange foreign currency call your local bank and ask them to do it for you.  If they won't ask them if they can send it out for exchange.
XuoxVRCMaa	I think they are right on target as far as green-tech being a huge area.  It has to be over the next 20-30 years.  Oil is going to get more expensive (and likely limited supply at SOME point), and many of the heretofore externalized costs of oil-tech (carbon pollution is an example) are going to start showing up in earnest.  <br>  <br>  Where the money will be made...that's the tough call.  100x returns will be found in a few places--but that's anybody's guess.  I think a good place for good returns are with companies like GE--which has for 200 years "brought good things to life."
IgcG4UMIaa	Undoubtedly, the boom is going to give a stiff challenge to the existing chain retailers. As rightly said, about 97% of this industry is still unorganised. <br>  <br>  The so called giants - Reliance and Wallmart & Bharti - will enjoy economies of scale in all there operations from procuring to distributing the goods and it results in reduction of cost of the commodities that are sold.<br>  <br>  The price difference of commodities between the existing chain retailers and the reliance would be atleast around 2 to 3 Rs per unit. This will surely affect the business of the existing chain stores like spencers daily, subhiksha etc..,<br>  <br>  Further, Reliance is air-lifting the vegetables and flowers fresh from the farmers and so we can see green - fresh vegetables in their shelfs.<br>  <br>  Coming to the effect of these giants on kirana (mom and pop) stores:- two factors stands tall between kirana stores and these giants. <br>  they are, the credit sales given by kirana stores,the strong interpersonal relationship between these stores and the customers and the proximity of such stores to the buyers.<br>  <br>  Since Reliance and other chain retailers can not give credit sales and cannot maintain a good interpersonal relationship they can't wipe out kirana stores. Further, it is not possible for them to reach every knook and corner of the country.<br>  <br>  As a conclusion, these retail giants are going to affect the existing retail chain stores adversely but, they can't wipe out the mom and pop stores for atleast next 20 years or so....|`|5hyJ1ddvaa	Retail boom in India will not affect the existing retailers much,because i would not prefer to drive on petrol to a cty square to shop for my general needs when there is a shop next to my house,which gives personalised service.|`|c230dbf43b86f0713bd6916a158ff730aa	Your questions apparently projects a gloomy picture... but the picture is not as gloomy as it seems.. I would like to clear that ORganised reltail(malls etc) is only 3 pcent while Unorganised(shops etc) is 97 %... so the retail boom may not jolt the small and medium shopkeepers immediately.. moreover all this retail shopping cult is an urban phenomena rather than been a gradual over all landscape of india.... However the picture is not fascinating in the long run... as these people (walmarts, reliance) have deper pockets so they can eventually vaipe out the small ones... But the retail boom in FArm sector is mucu more Farmer friendly than of anybody else... and net benefits are in the favour of Farming communities only..... hope that answers... chabaj@rediffmail.com

I have chosen a product in the health and wellness field, because I truly believe in it's results and feel that I can sell it to other people.  I feel that people need this product, so I just tell them why.  If you are marketing a product you  don't really believe in, it will come across to the customer, so even if yours is the best product in the world, but it hasn't done anything for you, you will have a difficult time selling it.<br>  Once you have found the product you want to market, the rest is easy. You enroll with that company, have your website in place and really learn the business from the people who have been successful at it.  Be sure to check the compensation plan first, as many of them are outdated.

Pilzer discusses five markets/industries in which some of these next 10 million millionaires will emerge and the Team is and has been capitalizing upon all five.<br>  <br>  ***       Where Internet technology meets product distribution there is e-commerce, which is central to the Team’s business model.  <br>  ***       And with the Internet and a home-based business, there is no need for massive overhead expenditures and operating capital for brick and mortar buildings, inventory, personnel, equipment, etc.  <br>  ***       With the Team’s focus on the exclusive wellness industry products through the DOT1-STEP program, we have a niche in a market reported to be presently at $300 billion on its way to a trillion.  <br>  ***       One of the key factors in business success is the ability to expand and teach others.  Pilzer calls it bridging the technology gap through intellectual distribution.  The Team’s intellectual distribution system is not only empowering to those seeking to capitalize on the 5 areas Pilzer identifies, but also provides the leverage with which to expand at whatever rate we can get this information into other people’s hands.<br>  <br>  But the biggest factor allowing an individual like you and me to take advantage of ALL these otherwise unreachable growing trends, is the Team’s masterful systemization of achieving success through a system.  The Team's business model allows to put a check mark next to each of these millionaire producing trends.  Orrin Woodward’s development of a system that leverages information and activity with specific focused results based upon the win-win principles of franchising provides a level playing field for anyone with drive, determination, and dedication to capitalize on these wealth creating trends.

vRuk8WLaaa	One reason a landlord may object to a home-based business is if it would involve customers coming to your rental to conduct business (liability insurance issues, neighbors may complain, parking/zoning restrictions, delivery trucks). This problem may not apply if you start a mail-order or online home business or one where you would go elsewhere to do business (carpet cleaning would be one example). These businesses would transfer well to your new home. However, the best way to find out for sure is to ask your landlord.<br>  Best wishes in your quest and I hope that you too can start Living your Dreams!

As long as you are willing to learn, you can get ahead.<br>  I have a home business in health and wellness marketing only one product, but what a product!  It seems everyone knows people who have health issues these days, so I decided to start marketing this product after it proved itself to me, in that my health dramatically improved.  I just started sharing my story with people and started to really learn about what the product can do, and it really delivered.  This is something you can start and build while you are still employed.  You might be surprised at how quickly it will not only meet, but surpass your current income, then you have the freedom to work from home, better hours and no commuting.

That's what I can think of.<br>  Don't quit your job until you know your business takes off and you have enough money to actually quit your job.<br>  Most of the time you will have to work more hours on your business than your 9-5 job. Having your own business gives you a lot of stress and headache.<br>  And you have to understand that you may go out of business to or it may not work so you will have to keep on trying.

AA11327039	Just in case the first major fails you, go for a completely different second major.  <br>  <br>  It's kind of like going to college on  a football scholarship and majoring in education.  Yeah, you want to play for The Bears when you graduate but maybe teaching in Chicago will work if the bears don't draft you.|`|JTKCPNnjaa	Two related majors is a great option. Not only will it look good for future employers, it will give you more opportunities as you expand your career.<br>  The point that will really make the dual majors work for you is to keep them fresh. If you become employed as an engineer, make sure to keep working with statistics so that you can honestly put that on your resume as a skill. Just having the degree means little if you don't show real-world applications of it.|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	What do you want to do when you graduate? I think that if your main objective is to get into engineering, particularly aerospace as a specialty, then I suggest you go into something more pertinent, like business or statistics or even physics. It just depends on what you want to do. Now if you go into a different field where its more general, then a major doesn't matter as much as the education/diploma.|`|8ruwONI2aa	In previous generations, the whole point of college/university was to go study the liberal arts like history, english, languages, etc.  Educated were people who knew about those things.  If you wanted to be a doctor, lawyer, or business-person, you went to graduate school after you had that good base education.  <br>  <br>  Now, college has become more of a trade school where you study to be a particular thing.  Students feel pressured to major in something that will get them the most money quickest--and it's hard to argue against that.  But you can have the best of both worlds.      <br>  <br>  If you value being well-rounded (regardless of what your future employers think), stick with your History studies.  Liberal arts like History teach you to think critically, understand the big picture, and solve problems.I majored in Finance, and I stood out from the crowd with my Philosophy and Psychology minors.  I have a great job now, but I'm glad I studied those things because of how they helped me develop intellectually.  <br>  <br>  If you really feel like you need a statistics minor for an edge, you can get that in addition to the history major.  Go to summer school or stay an extra semester.  A great option is to combine study abroad with your history major--you can get tons of great history credits in almost any study abroad program.|`|AA10953750	no it's not.<br>  <br>  this is like someone who has a degree and fix houses in the side.

8ruwONI2aa	1.  Fidelity is a good choice.  I also like Vanguard very much.  I've had a Roth IRA there for years, as well as several other accounts.  Both firms have good low cost funds with good track records.  <br>  <br>  2.  Go with an index fund, or a fund that is made up of several index funds.  LIfe cycle retirement funds are great, and Vanguard and Fidelity have good ones.  They automatically allocate your money between stocks, bonds, international, etc.  Index funds are the cheapest to buy/maintian AND they perform better historically.<br>  <br>  3.  In an IRA (or Roth IRA) you can take the principal out with no penalty for several reasons: buying your first home, paying for school tuition for yourself or family, disability, etc.  You will not have to pay taxes either, as you pay taxes on the money before you invest it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

2dc006a42562a30df7d3cddb9f97474aaa	What is a dooman?
Sp9nt33uaa	No. Pension assets are asset protected.  IRAs are also asset protected in 26 states. If you commit to a debt reduction process, keep the agreement--you'll want to keep your credit in as good of shape as possible for future opportunities.|`|8ruwONI2aa	No they cannot.  Even if you file bankruptcy, your retirement assets are federally protected (as well as your primary residence in some states).|`|e50da9289684c28e7622531124b50f86aa	They can't go after those things.  Good idea trying to pay off your debt though...You may be able to borrow against the pension plan to do your debt reduction.
ebf70d85001653699afe356f26787c19aa	No you don't need any permission from RBI,, But your address proof must be matched on the time of verification by pay pal ,, if they found it wrong they gonna freeze your account.. & it take 30 days to get money transfer... So best option is Westorn union money transfer
c11b95bd9d08a09cb6eb59cb13f16597aa	I'll give you three ranges-food and beverage, $8 hour, Best Buy, other broad line retailers (Longs, Rite-Aid) $12 hour, Home Depot, $14 plus. Part of the difference is replacing employees-a place like Home Depot can't consistently turn people over beyond cashier level and maintain business-they have corporate accounts, etc.|`|AA11665896	Not sure about the rest but at home depot in the state of california most supervisors start around 13 -14 depending on experience it grows from there with a median around 17-18 but the max amount a supervisor at Home Depot can make is $25, hope it helps.
zbjgfUkbaa	The HDFC bank requirement is that your Average Quarterly Balance (AQB) should be minumum 5000/. This is calculated at the end of each financial quarter by dividing the Sum of Daily Closing Balance for the quarter by the Number of days in the Qtr. That is you add the balance in your account each day of the quarter and then divide the sum by the number of days in the quarter (90-92 days depending on the qtr).<br>  <br>  So it is ok if your balance falls below the minimum (5000/-) for a few days as long as on other days your balance is much higher so as to make the AQB (as calculated above) greater than 5000/-<br>  <br>  See: <a href="http://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/accounts/regularcc_acc_fees.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/account...</a><br>  (Although the above link is for their current account, the method of AQB calculation should be the same for the savings account also)|`|ebf70d85001653699afe356f26787c19aa	As per there rule yu should Maintain minimum Rs 5000 balance per day... Suppose you withdraw that also and your account Balance is Rs 0/- than second Day you musthave balance of 10,000 So your Average of 5000 is maintained ... So its good to Deposit Rs 5000/- & Till Rs 5000/- assume that you got Rs o /- Balance.
zkWibb3Raa	Yes.  Their current rate is 5.36% which is one of the best in the country.  I've had an account there since September and experienced no problems.  Its also easy to transfer money in and out.  I've also got an ING Direct account and they provide good service but the extra .75% from Amtrust Direct can make a huge difference over time.|`|AA11603761	I've never heard of them.  I use ING Direct and have been thrilled with them.|`|8ruwONI2aa	As long as you are getting 4-5% interest on your savings (and no annual or monthly fees or service charges) then you are good.  If not, try EmigrantDirect.com, Vanguard, or ING.
aE4hyVehaa	It depends why you are unhappy with them. TXU still owns the power lines, it's just the electricity generation that's provided by another company.<br>  <br>  So basically, if you're getting intermittent service disruptions in your area changing providers will not change this. If you're unhappy with the rates, just about any company with better rates will work.|`|8ruwONI2aa	I use Green Mountain Energy and I LOVE it.  It's 100% renewable energy.  You can even specify if you want wind only generated energy (it costs more than solar+wind+water generated energy, but apparently it's even better for the environment).   www.greenmountainenergy.com.  <br>  <br>  Their rates are supposed to be better, but I don't know because I have no comparison to base it off of.  It's easy to switch.  Just sign up online.  <br>  <br>  Green Mountain sends you your bills and everything, but technically if your provider is TXU, then TXU will still supply you the electricity through your existing TXU box.  Green Mountain monitors the consumption of all their customers, and each month they supply TXU with however much electricity you is used by their customers.  It's 100% renewable energy.  <br>  <br>  So you aren't charged TXU rates and they have nothing to do with you except that their lines are already set up so it's way easier to just supply TXU directly with the renewable energy instead of to each customer individually.

You should also consider what you are good at, what you like, what kind of people you like to be around (if you like people at all), and how long you'll have to be in school to be educated for a particular job.  <br>  <br>  If you are good at science, you may be able to make it through all the biology and chemistry required to become a doctor.  Lawyers have to be excellent readers and writers.  <br>  <br>  Some doctors and lawyers make a lot, others don't make that much more that people with a simple college degree.  It depends on how talented you are and what you decide to do with your degree.  But neither of them has very much of a life outside work.  You might consider the lifestyle you'd be choosing to lead.|`|AA11573543	both professions require more than 4 years of college, high payin job means nothin, it matter if ur interest in that field.|`|1kahJhVJaa	This kind of concerns me. I know that I wouldn't want a doctor that wasn't sure that's what he wanted to do and only did it for the money. Do you not feel a pull towards either one just because the work part of it interests you?  Not to mention it will take years after schooling to make any profit, because you will owe sooooo much for student loans etc.|`|aEZ5Nc7Laa	I'm an attorney and I will tell you that pay is not a reason to be either a lawyer or a doctor.  Both are very high stress jobs that require intense schooling and monetary satisfaction is not the ultimate ends.  I would advise you to figure out what you would like to do if money were not the ultimate goal and use that as your starting point for your career search. <br>  <br>  I think generally, doctors earn more, but the profession also requires more schooling.  For information on attorney salaries see <a href="http://www.nalp.org/content/index.php?pid=147." rel="nofollow">http://www.nalp.org/content/index.php?pi...</a>  In 2005, the median salary for first-year associates ranged from $67,500 in firms of 2-25 attorneys to $125,000 in firms of more than 500 lawyers, with a first-year median for all participating firms of $100,000.

2O1GQelkaa	There's one in the UK - <a href="http://www.zopa.com/ZopaWeb/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zopa.com/ZopaWeb/</a><br>  <br>  However, if you're thinking of borrowing/lending money, I'd have long hard think about it before using this site...<br>  <br>  If you're a lender, you have a very high risk that the person you're lending to has a bad credit rating (why else would they be trying these kinds of sites to access money, rather than going to a bank, etc. which is cheaper), and they might default on their loan with no guarantee of anything to you. The site gives you no guarantee of it either - they're only interested in signing up as many people as possible so they can take their cut.<br>  <br>  If you're a borrower, you should probably think about what you're doing wrong with your finances that you have to resort to this kind of thing (some of the interest rates are extremely high, and you could get a much better deal elsewhere).

93b942e36a4d3ec10311e003407e2041aa	Like so many questions in this forum, this one is answered with the typical, "it depends."  Brokerage firms and banks are completely different animals.  Handling money is about the only thing they have in common.<br>  <br>  A bank is a place to hold your money.  It is a mayonnaise jar with a little added security and some interest.  If you are saving for the long term and trying to grow your money, the bank is not where you want it.  Granted, some if not most brag about their full service, offering brokerage services, insurance, and financial planning; but the truth is that bankers are not financial people.  They don't grasp the concepts of optimizing money.  I've been on both sides of the fence and can speak from experience.<br>  <br>  See a financial advisor to decide how best to handle your money.  Your best option is to ask relatives or friends whose opinion you respect who they use.  Many do financial planning at no cost to you.|`|8ruwONI2aa	The important thing is to have your money allocated properly between stocks, bonds, and cash.  You can do this through almost any bank or investment firm or brokerage.<br>  <br>  If you need cash (and everyone needs at least some cash for emergencies) then that money needs to be somewhere earning at least 4-5% interest.  You can do that with a bank savings account at a bank like ING Direct or EmigrantDirect, or you can do it through a money market account at an investment firm like Vanguard or Fidelity.  <br>  <br>  If you want to invest in stocks, you can do it through a brokerage firm like Scottrade where you can buy and sell ETFs and stocks for $7 a trade--or you can do it through Vanguard or Fidelity by purchasing low cost index funds and mutual funds.  <br>  <br>  Just make sure you're paying the lowest fees/commissions and making the highest interest, no matter where you go for your banking/investment needs.

Are you committed to working at it or are you looking for a "free ride," a lottery ticket.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, it takes the ability to grow a business that has a system in place that will allow you to have the time to exit that business and start another. With this ability, the potential to grow multiple, money making businesses is endless. This is a theory made prominent by Robert Kiyosaki, the author of THE CASHFLOW QUADRANT.

Even if you have bad credit, there are companies that will refinance you which will allow you to keep your home.

Or you can try the Housing Counseling Agency, I believe it is through HUD and they can also help you. You can also file Chapter 13 bankruptcy and this will stop it too, but it will really affect your credit. Good Luck to you

Buy stuff that you NEED not stuff that you WANT.|`|VG4gKiggaa	The most important thing to ANY person to get the most out of your money is to have a plan & stick to it (for money, that means a BUDGET).<br>  Here are some other general tips from a former dirt-poor college student:<br>  <br>  (1) You can always eat better, cheaper & healthier if you cook rather than eat out.<br>  <br>  (2) Pay essentials first: food, rent, utilities & gas. Then you at least are surviving to fight another day.<br>  <br>  (3) Live on less than you make - no matter how much or little that is.<br>  <br>  (4) Save for emergencies (by doing #3).<br>  <br>  (5) NEVER NEVER NEVER borrow money. You cannot afford to pay even 1 cent of interest if you are already scraping by. My granny was a widow who raised 4 children during the late 60s-80s & has never made more than $25k in a yr, but she is debt free, owns a beautifully maintained paid for all brick home & a nice late model car. She has long-term car insurance, too. She sometimes worked 4 jobs, but she has no regrets.<br>  <br>  (6) Don't give in to guilt. Lots of single mommies (like my sis) buy their kids stuff b/c they feel guilty that there is no daddy & mommy has to work all the time. Your kids will respect you more if you know how to say "no" & you can afford to feed yourself when you get old instead of having to mooch off of them.<br>  <br>  Need more advice? We follow Dave Ramsey...|`|82fec6c34daa8f6b574180a7589ec9b1aa	make sure you are claiming single and the right number or dependents (you plus the # of kids).<br>  <br>  Buy Generic brand foods.  They are JUST AS GOOD as name brand but cost less.<br>  <br>  Talk to your electric and water company about budget billing.  They average out how much you use each month and that is what you pay and every year it is re-figured so if you start to use less, then you start to pay less.  In the spring and fall you usually end up paying more because the AC and heater aren't going but the summer and winter make up for it.<br>  <br>  Use all the natural light you possibly can.  Open the windows on nice days and nights so the ac/heater doesn't have to be on.  Unplug unused appliances (TV's can be unplugged at night...that is 8 hours of used energy when they aren't on).  Wash clothes in cold water (forget the warm and hot water...use cold, they still get clean and the water heater doesn't have to be used).<br>  <br>  Create a budget for yourself and stick to it.<br>  <br>  Tell yourself and your kids "no."  It is an easy word to say but a hard word to stand by.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|8ruwONI2aa	First I would make sure I'm taking out the proper deductions before I even get my paycheck.  Make sure you are getting great health insurance and making adequate 401k contributions (10%).  [You don't want your kids to have to fund your retirement, so save for yourself first!  They can take out loans to pay for college].  You also need life insurance so your children have something to fall back on if something happens to you.  Also make sure you aren't having too much tax withheld (if you get a refund every year, you need to raise your exclusions; fill out the W2 form again from your HR dept).  <br>  <br>  As for what you do with your net pay, I would contribute 10% of it to a money market account earning at least 5% interest right now.  If you have credit card debt, use the 10% to pay it down first, then create the account.  This money can be used for unexpected or irregular expenses for you and the kids.  When the account swells to be bigger than what you need for your annual irregular expenses, you can use the money for bigger expenses like a new car and/or a downpayment on a house. <br>  <br>  Spend only what is leftover after all these things are done!  If you can't afford to put most of this into practice, then you are living beyond your means.   Cut expenses and start saving!|`|f6b10f99ba79172b9fe7eac1cbbb600caa	Childcare is a huge expense, so try to have a relative or friend watch the child while you work (or if you find a job that offers free childcare, take advantage of it).  Buy your kid's clothing and toys at a thrift store or at garage sales. Watch all unnecessary spending (morning coffee, eating out, etc...).<br>  <br>  Try to find some way of generating income while you are at home in the evenings or during the weekends.

If $850 is just for the mortgage, your total housing cost could almost double once you add insurance and property taxes.  Not to mention HOA fees, higher utility costs, etc.  <br>  <br>  You should calculate the max you can spend on housing each month.  Then subtract the typical property tax for the size and location of the home you are considering.  Then subtract likely utility costs (overestimate).  Then subtract average insurance rates.  Then you are left with what you can spend on a loan and association/HOA dues (if any).  <br>  <br>  The internet has many calculators that can help you target a mortgage and price range once you know the range of all these other variables.|`|Yi8cenPHaa	15 year rates are around 5.75% right now, so if you qualified, you could spend around $102,000.  At 7%, it's around $94,000.  HOWEVER, that's using a principal and interest payment of $850/month (not including taxes and insurance).  Depending on what state you're in, you can estimate anywhere from $100/month to $350/month for taxes and insurance.<br>  <br>  FYI:  Mortgage calculators are available on the web - just google it.

Y9M02Xf1aa	Psychology is an academic and applied discipline involving the scientific study of mental processes and behavior. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including problems of individuals' daily lives and the treatment of mental illness.<br>  <br>  Psychology differs from the other social sciences — anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology — in seeking to explain the mental processes and behavior of individuals. Psychology differs from biology and neuroscience in that it is primarily concerned with the interaction of mental processes and behavior on a systemic level, as opposed to studying the biological or neural processes themselves. In contrast, the subfield of neuropsychology studies the actual neural processes and how they relate to the mental effects they subjectively produce. Biological psychology is the scientific study of the biological bases of behavior and mental states.<br>  <br>  It takes a good deal of schooling, at least a college degree. With the degree, you can really go into a lot of professions with another graduate degree tacked on. Lawyers always look good with a psychology degree. The range of salaries vary from 50k to 300k.|`|4f0cd81d2ec75d84539080d16c5944b7aa	psychology -  is the Scientific discipline that studies mental processes and behaviour in humans and other animals. Literally meaning "the study of the mind," psychology focuses on both individual and group behaviour. Clinical psychology is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders. Other specialized fields of psychology include child psychology, educational psychology, sports psychology, social psychology, and comparative psychology. The issues studied by psychologists cover a wide spectrum, including learning, cognition, intelligence, motivation, emotion, perception, personality, and the extent to which individual differences are shaped by genetics or environment. The methods used in psychological research include observation, interviews, psychological testing, laboratory experimentation, and statistical analysis.-

de5ce543f28e9c821efffe5890f6e70faa	I'm a stay at home dad to 3 small kids.  A couple years ago I got into real estate investing and have 3 properties now.  I'm not a guru, and I certainly won't be appearing on late-night t.v. with just 3 houses, but I've done it.  Here's what you need to do:<br>  <br>  1. Join your local real estate investor's group.  Don't know where one is?  check this site:  <a href="http://nationalreia.com/" rel="nofollow">http://nationalreia.com/</a>  This is where you'll meet people that have bargain properties.  Seek out the "wholesalers".  Just ask around.  If there is not a club in your area, call the "I Buy Houses" signs.  They should have properties for sale.<br>  <br>  2. Find a "Hard Money" lender.  The rates are high, but they can get you 100% of the cash if the deal is right.  You will then need to find a bank that will refinance with "no seasoning".  The hard money lender should know of some and need to get you pre-approved for the refi before making the loan.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.<br>  <br>  3. Close on a property in a good neighborhood and stick with 2 or 3 bedroom houses.  1 bedrooms are hard to rent as most people that would need these go with apartments and 4 bedrooms are too.  These people most likely have bought a house.<br>  <br>  Unless you are going to offer low income housing, or rentals in historic neighborhoods that need revitalizing, I don't know that you can get government money.<br>  <br>  My first deal was a house I found through my club that was valued at $51,500 and was for sale from a wholesaler for $26,200.  It cost me $32,000 with hard money fees, but I re-fied a week later and cashed out at 80% of value which was $42,000.  When all was said and done, I bought a house with no money out of pocket and cashed out about $9,000.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|itN3eKsbaa	I have wasted much money in grant programs and real estate courses. This is what I learned: the government will not give you grants to invest in real estate for personal use. I studied various "gurus" for 3 years and learned a great deal, but most importantly, I learned that their courses were too expensive for the average person. As such, I recently created a step-by-step guide for average people like ourselves to begin investing in real estate without credit and "no-money" down. Visit www.get-that-deed.com. It is only $7 because some people cannot afford the expensive boot camps and courses. These methods work because I used them...|`|8ruwONI2aa	Investing in real estate requires lots of knowledge, education, and experience.  That doesn't mean you necessarily need a college degree in real estate finance, but you need to have done lots of research.  You also need to be willing to take a certain amount of risk.  To qualify for a mortgage you must either put some money down or generate a high enough income where the bank doesn't care. <br>  <br>  I can't help but be very offended by your idea of getting a government grant.  You don't feel like saving money or even borrowing it, so you want other people's tax dollars to go to you so you can play/gamble in the real estate market.  Government grants should go to those who truly need it.

8ruwONI2aa	The whole point of college is to take different classes and figure out what you like, what you're good at, and what career is right for you.  Almost no one knows what their major is going to be before sophomore year!  And even after that they often change it.  <br>  <br>  I advocate getting at least a minor in business/finance no matter what, since everything revolves around business in America, and everyone needs that basis of knowledge, in my opinion.  Even if you want to be a journalist or psychologist or engineer or computer technician (all potentially very high paying jobs), a double major in business/finance will always benefit you.  <br>  <br>  Especially if you don't know what you want to do, that degree will open up the most doors for you in a plethera of industries.  <br>  The majority of companies who recruit on college campuses are looking for business grads (whether finance, accounting, marketing, or management).  <br>  <br>  By the way, if bio and chem aren't your strong points, cross medicine off your list.  Also, you don't have to be a good speaker to be a lawyer, but you do have to be a great writer/reader.  There are lots of types of law and lawyers, and not all involve closing arguments in a courtroom.  <br>  <br>  PS-the average starting salary for a finance grad (undergrad) is just over $45,000.  I graduated in 2006 with a finance degree, and my starting salary plus bonuses were $50,000 at a regional bank--and my salary will obviously only climb.  So don't listen to your friends.  <br>  <br>  Do what you love; only then will you be dedicated enough to make big bucks.|`|85193b27ca2885373746d30d27b98cd6aa	What job could you enjoy doing and get excited about?

An amatuer can quickly underestimate costs for building AND flipping. <br>  <br>  It varies to build a house-- check yoru local classifieds and then go visit the model homes of those that advertise "houses on your lot from $35 a sq ft!" <br>  <br>  You pick a neighborhood based on the fact that the house you are flipping is the WORST house, or atleast at the bottom. YOu always want the rest of the houses to look better than the one you're buying-- so when you flip it, it fits in and the buyer pays more. NEVER buy in a junked out neighborhood becuase the house itself is an easy flip- the buyers will not like the area.|`|AA10074148	There are several things you need to know when buying foreclosures and flipping properties.<br>  <br>  Flipping is easier than building,though after you have been in the business for a few years you might consider it as it is a progression.<br>  <br>  First of all you  should go to the nearest book store, purchase several books on buying, fixing and flipping properties. There are several that you might be interested in.<br>  <br>  You will also want to find out if your state is a non-judicial or judicial foreclosure state. This will assist you in making offers as well time frames in which you  have to work in when purchasing a foreclosed property.<br>  <br>  Once, or, while you are doing this you should buy one of the TV guru's distressed property programs. These programs will give you some legal forms you might use when writing an offer to purchase a property. You will also find several scripts to use in taking to your potential clients.  The also give you tips and a formula on how to figure if you have a property that you can make money from before buying. <br>  <br>  If you are without funds to accomplish this business, you will have to find some investors that will assist you. You will have to make a deal with them about a certain percentage of the profits made from the sale of the property. You will have to advertise in your local newspaper for these type individuals to assist you in buying and flipping.<br>  <br>  <br>  Normally this is 50/50 however it could be more or less depending on how your relationship is with the investor.<br>  <br>  Now to purchase a foreclosed property depends on what phase the foreclosure is in.<br>  <br>  #1 Pre-foreclose- the owner is still in the home, he has been notified that he is in foreclosure. Now  he has to come current or the foreclosure will continue. <br>  <br>  You can make an offer to the owner at this point, give him something in his hand to purchase his equity. Now you will also want to see if there is any repairs that need to be done on the property. If there is you need to know the cost of this repair. You will need to know how many months he is behind in his mortgage payments as well as any fees that the lender has incurred in trying to collect the mortgage payment. Now add these together to include what you had to give the homeowner. Also you must include how much you will need to hold the property, I mean making the mortgage, paying the insurance and taxes while you repair the house for sale.<br>  <br>  Now find out the balance of the mortgage add this to the above figure. Now you need a method of finding out the current value of the property. All this information will tell you if you have a deal or not. <br>  <br>  #2 The other way to purchase a foreclosure is when the property goes to sale. At this point you must have all cash and you must be able to prove that you have whatever the minimum bid is in cash, cashier’s check or money orders. If you have no proof you will not be allowed to bid.<br>  <br>  #3 One last way is after the sale. If no one bid and get the property at the foreclosure sale, you may find out what bank owns the property, write an offer as well as a check as a deposit not to be cashed until the offer has been accepted. You might also inform them as to how and when you plan to come up with the remainder of the sales price. I have know some lenders to accept offers this way before the property is turned over to a real estate broker to sell.<br>   <br>  <br>  Now you have to determine how you are gonna market yourself to get. <br>  <br>  #1  You can purchase a pre-foreclosure list from a list broker (Join the crowd most do this and mail letters to the person that is in foreclosure) <br>  <br>  #2  You can advertise in your local paper that you are in the business of purchasing foreclosures.<br>  <br>  #3 You can do a direct mail to people in your city stating that you are now in the foreclosure business. <br>  <br>  #4 You can do the research at the county recorders office yourself (time consuming and tedious-but workable. You should get enough leads for a least one days work.)<br>  <br>  #5 You can select an area of your city that you want to work and target your that area with your energy.  You can walk the area pass out flyers that you are now in the business of buying property distressed, divorced and foreclosures as well as probate property.<br>  <br>  Pass out these flyers for at least 2-3 months after which you should go to a newsletter of some sort while still explaining that you purchase properties.<br>  <br>  After passing out the flyers for 2-3 months you should follow that up with a newsletter to the same area. Check with the post office and inquire about a bulk mailing stamp. This is a more economical way of mailing business matter.<br>  <br>  You will want to form a professional team to assist you in your new career field, which should be composed of but not limited to an attorney, cpa, tax preparer, notary public, title rep, real estate agent and others that you feel will make you successful. <br>  <br>  They should pass out your business card to their clients that need your services and you should pass out their cards to your clients that need their services <br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"|`|8ruwONI2aa	If you are trying to make money you should not build a home ever--unless you are actually an experienced builder for a living.  Building is the most expensive way to buy/own a home, generally.<br>  <br>  But you shouldn't assume you can easily flip a house either.  What makes you think you can get someone else to pay more than you did?  "Flipping" is when you buy a house and immediately sell it for more than you paid--which is hard to do because it's expensive to buy/sell a home.  You have to pay closing costs, commissions, etc.  <br>  <br>  The best/easiest way to make money through real estate is simply to own a home and live in it.  You borrow only a fraction of the cost (80% or less is best), but you make money off the appreciation of the whole house.  So each month your loan amount goes down as you pay your mortgage, but simultaneously the value of the house goes up with the market!  So your home equity grows unbelievably fast.  Then when you sell eventually, you should have lots more money than you invested/put down.  But this takes time--years.  <br>  <br>  Better yet when you decide to move you can rent out the house instead of sell it.  Then your home equity continues to grow AND you get a monthly "paycheck" from the tenant.  This is also hard to do, but can be easier if you've already built up equity in the home.  <br>  <br>  You should have enough in cash to cover 6 months of living expenses (including the mortgage) before you buy a home.  Utility costs, taxes, and maintenance will be more than you expect, not to mention closing costs.  And once you move in, if you lose your job, you can't just move or downsize like if you're renting an apartment.  You still have to pay the mortgage.  So have a cash cushion before you begin.|`|951483cfb9daff8f4880ea125371effbaa	Right now the market is not that good. If you plan to flip make sure you can afford 3-6 months payments. Since the shows have started on TV everyone is trying to flip houses. Think about watching for the ones that are getting repossessed from those first timers and sell them.<br>   That depends on what you plan to build or the repairs that need to be done. Not enough info to answer.<br>   Call a builder and ask what the cost of building is in your area.<br>   Look at it and think about your grandmother living there.
8ruwONI2aa	Fees are the most important thing--and you want to go through a company that has a good variety of investment choices that has a good reputation.  The best thing for the long term is a low cost index fund (or funds).  It's boring, but it gets you the highest return on average, year in and year out.  A target retirement fund is a great option too, if one is available.<br>  <br>  I have an IRA with Vanguard, and I really love the company.  The fee is only $10/year (and it drops to nothing once you have a certain amount of money...I think $10,000).  And most of their funds are top rated funds.  Low costs and high returns on average.  <br>  <br>  Fidelity is a good choice too.  Banks are usually not a good chioce as they have high fees and few investment options.|`|dP07lZcNaa	You need to know which IRA is best for you by its tax status.  You should consult with a financial advisor to see if they get you ira funded with good mutual bonds that meet your specific needs, the intrest rate on the IRA and account maintenance fees.

8ruwONI2aa	Most job advertisements--no matter what city you're in--are sales pitches.  Going on monster.com or other career sights will lead you to most of these types of jobs.  <br>  <br>  You should apply/inquire directly with a company you want to work with, whether they have a listed job opening or not.  The best jobs are not usually listed; companies recruit on campuses or fill postions from within or through connections.  Drop by and leave your resume; call HR and ask about job openings, etc.  People love that kind of drive, especially in Texas/the South.  Or go through a head hunter or recruiter or career center at a university.

Best to shop for the best bank and then upon the 'rollover window' write a letter of your complaints and move the $$.|`|8ruwONI2aa	Banks are generally a terrible place to have an IRA.  They charge high fees, and they don't have good service or investment advice because their main business is not investing--it's banking.  <br>  <br>  The IRA is just an account--the CD is the investment you have within that account.  You can move your IRA to another firm/bank/brokerage anytime you want.  But it gets complicated since you own illiquid investments (the CD), and I'm not sure if your new firm (whichever you choose) can hold a bank CD from your bank...<br>  <br>  What you should do is first decide where you want your IRA to be now.  I highly recommend Vanguard.  They have a great mix of mutual funds, index funds, bonds, money markets, etc.  Plus great target retirement fund.  Low cost, consistently top rated.  Fidelity is good too.  Wherever you pick, talk to that customer service center and tell them what you want to do.  They will take care of the rollover and advise you best about how to handle the CD.<br>  <br>  By the way, you shouldn't have CDs in IRAs unless you are already in retirement!  You should have a mix of stocks and bonds--mostly stocks (including international ones) if you are more than 5 years from retirement.

It's been tried and proven successful by thousands of people every day.  Get on there and have a look at the want it now for some ideas of what people would like but isn't on there yet.<br>  <br>  I'd also recommend setting up another couple of MSI's so that you have extra income coming from other places as well.  For example since you'd be spending a bit of time online with eBay I'd look at signing up for a "Pay to surf" site like AGLOCO.  They pay you for the time you spend on the net and it's 100% free to sign up.<br>  <br>  The other option if you have the appropriate skills is freelancing.  This can be writing, web design, graphic design or some other talent that you can be paid to do.  There's alot of sites online that will facilitae the freelance......... i.e. the people who want a job done will list their job on the site and then you can answer them and tell them how much it would cost them for you to do it.  There's a fair few sites like that out there but check out elance to see what i mean.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you out............<br>  <br>  Cheers, ToNy!<br>  "Success.Trail"|`|Q3LWNJjTaa	This is an excellent money making at home business with just a couple hours a week involved you can be up and running..

8ruwONI2aa	In banking, many people have made their business by starting small community banks--and then selling them to the big banks who are always looking to expand.  Also, Presidents of banks and top executives often are compensated over $1MM/yr if you include salary and bonuses.  But many bankers make hundreds of thousands a year just by being good at their sales job.  Commercial lenders are the key profit centers at banks, and they are paid on commission (plus generous salaries).  <br>  <br>  In finance in general, the above info also rings true.  Top executives make millions just in salary, and any good sales person ("wealth manager" "stockbroker" or "VP") can earn hundreds of thousands a year by being good at their job and getting good clients with big portfolios.  <br>  <br>  People who start their own companies like hedge funds and private equity firms also stand to make millions, if their companies succeed (i.e. if they are good salespeople and can convince lots of rich investors to fork over their money).

GCYhSQdAaa	Dan,<br>  If you own your home or any piece of property you should be entitled to a deduction. There are also other deductions you may be entitled to. However, without  sufficient earned income you can't; because you can't deduct taxes you have not paid. If you have sufficient income the deduction will be based on taxes incurred for that tax year offset by any deductions you can claim.<br>  <br>  Continue contributions however. at age 591/2 you'll be able to withdraw without penalties. You'll likely be a a lower tax bracket so you won't have to pay as much in taxes.<br>  <br>  As far as record keeping? Keep ALL documents regardless of deduction status.<br>  Most importantly, get with a qualifed tax advisor.|`|8ruwONI2aa	The record-keeping responsibility lies largely in the hands of your investment company.  You need only to keep the annual 1099 and any other tax forms they send you (you may also want to keep quarterly statements just in case you ever want to refer to them).  <br>  <br>  When you withdraw the money you don't have to calculate the tax treatment your self.  Again, your investment company will have all that recorded, and you'll get a summary in the form of your annual tax form from them.  They'll know what percentage of your withdrawal is taxable or not.  They'll either withhold the tax and pay it for you, or you'll just plug in the numbers from their forms into your annual tax return.<br>  <br>  Though I've never heard of an IRA with deductable and nondeductable contributions allowed...
4Lqp4tgOaa	It is a preliminary discussion to analyse a few points:<br>  1. The effectiveness of communication skills, <br>  2. How well is one in expressing self, <br>  3. How well can one impress over the telephone, (which is very essential in today's scenario). <br>  4. Confidence, aptitude, and willingness to learn of the candidate. <br>  5. Certain experienced HR personnel can identify the energy level the employee might carry.<br>  <br>  The HR who calls you will introduce themselves and their company before jumping into questions. So, listen patiently and carefully. If you do not understand what they say, it is very good to ask them to repeat it (make it politely like, "I think I could not hear what you just said, can you please repeat that for me").<br>  <br>  In order to analyse and validate these, normally the following questions are asked:<br>  1. Tell me about yourself: They expect to know about experience, education, career objectives. Make it short and sweet, and upto the mark. (Should not exceed 1 minute, so, practise)<br>  2. If an experienced person, what is the current roles and responsibilities: They expect you not to tell all the stories. They expect you to explain the key responsibilities, and also do mention couple of your valuable contributions and achievements during the present role<br>  3. Reason for looking for a new job: Be modest enough not to say anything wrong about the present employer. Normally accepted answers are "Growth in career path", "Looking for new challenging roles", etc.<br>  <br>  TIPS:<br>  <br>  1. Always rehearse for the interview, be prepared (as to what answers might lead to what questions, etc.) Try few mock calls with your bum-chum, who can give candid feedback. (It worked for me very well!)<br>  <br>  2. If you are in an inconvenient situation to talk, plainly ask them to call them back (again politeness is the key. "I am in the middle of an important assignment, may I request you to please call me back at ----- Hours"). Make sure you are free at the said time (+/- 1 hour, as you cannot expect them to call back in the exact minute you mentioned).<br>  <br>  3. Smile when you pick the phone, the listener can feel the energy and happiness.<br>  <br>  4. Be polite, but not very sugar-coated. Being too modest is considered as an evil weakness.<br>  <br>  5. Be confident and do not rephrase the words. If they did not listen, just repeat what you said exactly.

These are what every true wholesalers and distributors will ask from you to set up an account. If they don't ask for it, that means they are just selling at retail prices and tricking you into thinking they are wholesale. Megagoods.com for example is one of them. There are quite a few wholesalers and distributors. My 3 personal favorites are D & H, Ingram Micro, and Tech Data. The electronics biz is a tough one due to all the competition and supply/demand. If your expecting to find products for half price, forget it. The distributors and wholesalers prices for electronics are usually 20 - 25% less then retail, unless of course you buy in very large quantities.

If you didn't hurt anyone, you could work in a doctor's office getting patients ready to see the doctor. If you can type, you can transcribe medical notes dictated by doctors, you also could use your medical knowledge to code visits for insurance or other sources. Depending on the bad choices, if you can demonstrate rehabilitation, some nursing boards may give you another chance.

One is referred to as "the traditional IRA"  and the other is called a "Roth IRA"  Both have advantages and disadvantages depending on the individual.  The Roth's advantages are:<br>  1.  You can take out your contribution at any time.<br>  2.  The earnings are not taxable when they are qualified distributions.<br>  3.  A Roth is available for people that do not qualify for a traditional<br>  4.

Even if you do you very best, others might just so easily take the credit and say that they somehow have a part in all of your hard work. They can just be standing near you and just by doing so, have a reason to take some credit.<br>  <br>  What are you going to do about it?

To clarify corporate relationships, however, you need to understand the company's history.<br>  <br>  Amway was founded in 1959.  In 1999, Amway's founders launched Quixtar Inc. in North America, providing a second business opportunity for independent business owners (IBOs).  Within three years, Quixtar superceded Amway in the U.S. and Canada, with more than 90 percent of IBOs making the switch.  So, in 2002, the Amway business brand was discontinued in the U.S. and Canada.  It remains the primary business brand for Alticor (our parent company) everywhere else in the world. <br>  <br>  In 2006, Quixtar's sales were $1.118 billion, and global sales for Alticor (mostly from its Amway businesses around the world) were $6.3 billion.  Amway China is the largest affililate, with Quixtar and Amway Japan right behind.<br>  <br>  Financial status for the Alticor companies is very strong. You can check out Dunn & Bradstreet credit rankings for the companies to verify.<br>  <br>  For disclosure's sake, I manage PR for Quixtar.|`|R8uP6qYIaa	Amway continues to change the name. I don't believe they have ever been bankrupt but MLM's are no longer solid business plans. If  you want to know what a solid business plan for owning your own business is let me know.

8ruwONI2aa	I was a psych major for 2 years before I changed to business (because I didn't want to get my masters and ph.d., and I had the same concerns that you do about not being marketable without them).  However, depending on where you live you should be able to get a decent job as a counselor (like in a school perhaps) or maybe even as a social worker.  Obviously it's EASIER to get these jobs with a masters, but it's not always required.  <br>  <br>  Also, you can just start a career unrelated to your major.  Apply for any general job in sales or marketing--you can spin your psych degree as a plus in the job interview since you can argue you know how to read people, etc.  Or you can look into being a writer or something...there are LOTS of my friends that graduated with liberal arts degrees who are doing everything from event planning to working in HR to working in recruiting for big, stable companies (law firms, financial companies, etc.).  <br>  <br>  Also, if you can, it would make you stand out even more to have an additional major/minor in another field--like business, computer science or economics.  Go to summer school and load up on extra classes next year--or even postpone graduation by a semester.  It might really be worth it to broaden your horizen if you don't want to go to grad school.  At least take a few specific extra classes that you can put on your resume to stand out, based on whatever kind of job you hope to get (journalism, management, marketing, advertising classes, etc.).  <br>  <br>  Congrats on your degree!!|`|e1a4e7b12a17c7a6e79c9582948d0f3daa	with what u'll be getting u'll be able to get a good job trust me on this one|`|nHay6BO3aa	get the masters.

The way this works is that for five years, or until you turn age 59 1/2 (whichever is longer), you take annual cash withdrawals based on your life expectancy, as predicted by the IRS.

They charge 5-10 bucks if you withdraw more than its limit.  <br>  <br>  3 important things to ask the bank are..<br>  <br>  Fees and services charges on the account ?<br>  Minimum balance requirements ?<br>  Interest rate paid on your balance ?<br>  <br>  No, you can't lose money from a FDIC insured money market account.  Fees will reduce earnings.<br>  <br>  2. It depends when the bank wants to change it.  (anytime)<br>  <br>  3. It depends on the bank but they want to keep your money as long as they can make money from it.  Some banks will charge you a lot of fees to keep your money in a money market account.<br>  <br>  4.  Open one up if you want access to your money.<br>  <br>  If you don't need access to your $ 5,000 you can benefit from other accounts.  It depends on wether you want a risky investment or a conservative one.<br>  <br>  CDs are FDIC insured, given at a fixed term and are currently averaging higher interest rates than bonds.  You can easily find one averaging (5% - 6%).<br>  <br>  Bonds are not FDIC insured and currently giving low rates. ( 3%-4%)<br>  <br>  Stocks, ETFs, mutual funds are riskier and promise higher returns.|`|itN3eKsbaa	There is no such thing as "investing" in a money market account. That is a fancy way of saying  "savings account". If you are afraid to lose money, place it in ING Direct and let it sit for 5 years. Or, you can take a little bit, invest in your education of finances and then really invest in some assets. Mutual funds/money market accounts will charge you to "hold" your money. Why pay someone to hold your money when you can hold it yourself.<br>  <br>  Invest in your education of finances and make your money grow yourself.<br>  <br>  "If you work hard on your job, you will earn a living.

AA11689215	I don't understand.<br>  <br>  You got a line of credit through Washington Mutual.<br>  It was placed into your checking account (with another bank).<br>  The hold cleared after 7 days.<br>  Washington Mutual took the money back because you used it.<br>  <br>  Regardless of the amount that you wrote the check for, it was YOUR money to use as you pleased!  How would they know what or how much you wrote the check for?  Once the money hits your account and clears, they are out of it.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, your current bank does not have to provide protection against this.  Washington Mutual is completely at fault...it's good that you read the fine print.|`|6UUsFFnOaa	OMG, I HATE WASHINGTON MUTUAL. They are literally doing the same crap to me. It sickening, there excuse to me was "they can only be held responsible for computer errors". What about human errors i.e. people who promise and say yes to things and then it turns out to be untrue! in return you get hit with these overdraft fees.  i feel so bad about how they screwed you, i only got screwed out of 200 bucks. I hate them and I would never recommend them to ANYONE! Get a lawyer who specializes in bank/finances, write letters and keep calling to demand repirations, that the only way you can get this overturned.|`|8ruwONI2aa	OK, I understand what happened.  I do not understand why Washington Mutual pulled the money back out of the account.  You need to get clarification on what a "double hold" is and exactly why they object to you depositing the full $6,000.  Ask for them to read to you in the contract/fine print where it says you can't do this.  If they can't explain it so you understand, then tell them you are going to speak to an attorney.  Demand to speak to a manager before you launch into any of this though, or you'll just have to repeat your story.    <br>  <br>  Depending on how much your overdraft fees are, it may be worth it to talk to an attorney.  Not that you should bother pressing charges--it's just that one or two phone calls from a lawyer might get the company to rebate your fees/overdrafts or issue you a letter of apology.  It should only cost you a couple hundred bucks for 1 hour of work on the attorney's part (or $0 for a free consultation).<br>  <br>  In any event, you should go back to your bank and ask to talk to the bank manager.  Give him/her your story--be sure and tell how you asked at the bank prior to depositing the check and how you were told it was a "great deal."  Most banks will refund your overdraft fees, or at least half of them when they were made by an honest mistake--and especially if they were made as a result of some huge misunderstanding like this.  <br>  <br>  If your bank won't refund your charges (not that they are responsible or requried to but simply out of good customer service) then tell the manager you are closing your account and moving your business.  And do it!  You deserve better treatment from your bank.  Trust me, I work at one, and we rebate fees all the time for way less meaningful reasons than this.|`|ff57485c529efb292598e3a8e29e99daaa	That is crazy!  Re-read your loan documents from them and search for the fine print.  When you open a line of credit, you can usually draw out the whole amount if need be.<br>  <br>  Also, once it was in your account, they shouldn't have pulled it out.  Sounds real wierd to me.  I would hold Wa-Mutual in account for all fees.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

I save money in addition to my Roth IRA and 401(k).  I have about 25% of my non-retirement money in mutual funds, most of the rest in CD's, and my emergency fund in an ING savings account.  In addition to adding to those savings out of my paycheck, I never spend the interest and dividends those savings earn.<br>  <br>  I like to live a simple life and I don't want the headaches or risks of being a landlord or a business owner; so I keep my finances pretty simple -- cash and mutual funds (a mix of stocks and bonds).<br>  <br>  My goal is to retire in 10 years; so I'm saving all I can now.
oBQcc3kjaa	I work for staples and when I first applied I just waited for a call. I know they recieve plenty of applications and everybody has to go through the online process.

I know somebody that works for them and it appears to be a great opportunity, with a good company.<br>  <br>  If you are not desperate for a job toiday, you can hang around by the phone and wait for a call from Staples. However, if you are serious abut finding work, you should have a couple of dozen of applications placed in different places. It's kind of like fishing. If you have one line in the water, you may catch one fish an hour. but, if you have a dozen lines in the water, you may catch a fish every five minutes. In other words, more applications in play translate to more opportunities to land a job.<br>  <br>  I have been in your place and I know that waiting around for an employer to call can be frustrating. I suggest you expand your vision a bit. Why not conduct a 24 hour job hunting campaign whre you visit as many job sites as possible and ask the boss "Do you have an opening for immediate placement?" If they say no, don't bother with an application. If you could hit about 20 places with this approach you would probably have a job before the day was over.<br>  <br>  This is all dependent on your approach, however. Don't be rude or brash. Try to appear professional and not desperate. You have a valuable commodity--yourself, your skills, etc., that employers need. It's just a matter of finding that employer that needs somebody now.|`|AA12164734	If they wanted you, they would have called.|`|f8696b7ec6c8cc24127fae5664640642aa	You should call them within a week to ask if they received your application and if it is under review.  If you do not hear back within another week you can call back again, and ask specifically if there are still positions available and if so tell them you put in an application for review and were expecting a call back. (possibly it got stuck at the bottom of the pile)   If the position has been filled they usually keep your application for 90 days and you can call back during this time to see if they are hiring again and remind them of your application when it comes around to hire people again.

A lot of people are getting screwed like you, but whether other people of the middle class want to evaluate the situation, or not (wiseolguy does not) is his/her choice. <br>  <br>  Ever since America has opened its labor markets to people of other countries (mainly China, India, and anyone who can walk across our borders) the middle class has been getting screwed. It began in the late 1990's with Bill Clinton in office, and has been running rampant ever since.<br>  <br>  What America needs to fix this "problem" is more "Protectionist" leaders to make policies that do not favor "Free Trade," and unlimited foreign labor. When the country gets tired enough of having people like your boss, and most members of the media telling them that the cost of living is not going up, wages are going up (we saw the bonuses on Wall Street and the bonuses the CEOs receive), and that the Middle Class is not going to be left out of this equation the problem will most likely be solved.|`|8d6ae5a42dddca82be705f10f6b74e58aa	Post 911....<br>  <br>  U.S. is gaining confidence and investing in the market.<br>  <br>  After 911 when Bush declared war on Iraq, everyone pulled their money out and the DOW plunged from 12k to 8k.<br>  <br>  The market is good because Democrats are taking over Congress and Bush is leaving in 1 year.

But I think it can be good to offer a monetary reward for straight A's on a report card, for example.  <br>  <br>  I think families should talk openly about money and saving.  It's ok to explain to your kids about why you can't buy certain things this month or how you are saving for long term goals like college/retirement.  I also think it's good to encourage your kids to give or tithe.

Your answer is "absolutely not."  If you sell something, just be sure to ship it in a way that you can track the package.  For example, if you ship FedEx or UPS you will automatically get a tracking number.  If you ship via USPS be sure to pay for "delivery confirmation."  It costs an additional 0.75 cents or even "signature required" which is $2.10.  This helps protect you from the recipient claiming that they never got anything.  But back to your question, no you do not need to enclose a packing or shipping list or any sort of invoice.  Ebay does NOT require it.  I never send anything other than the product itself.  In almost every case the recipient will see what it is as soon as they open it.  If you have any other questions email me.  I'd be happy to assist a fellow eBay'er.

Su solvencia se explica xq en vez de quedarse los 10$ que pagamos. se quedan 5, y los otros 5 los reparten entre las personas de los 5niveles x encima tuya.<br>  Ponen el ejemplo de que afilies solo a 5directos, y te dan 5$; cada uno afilia a otros 5, ya te dan 25$, luego 125$, 625$ y 3125$. Te parecerá imposible, pero conozco gente que está en 2a?os que llevan están ganado 2000$ al mes! Y aunque no llegues a esa cantidad, aunque solo sean 50$, a nadie le viene mal un dinero extra cada mes.<br>  Además, como incentivo, dan bonus de 100$ por cada 5personas que metas en una semana!<br>  La forma de pago es x tajeta de credito, solo das ese no, no el de la cuenta bancaria, por lo que es totalmente seguro.<br>  Te pueden pagar x checkmail, transferencia bancaria o x paypal (lo más recomendable).<br>  La primera semana es gratuita, y te puedes dar de baja si no te convence.<br>  Si te interesa o tienes alguna duda contactame:<br>  danielamoralesaguilar@hotmail....<br>  danielamoralesaguilar@yahoo.es|`|MDzgKXh3aa	Esto es serio.

They should have sent you a paper stating when they did that to you.   I got one sent to me the next day.   Maybe it's time for you to switch banks and make sure you are able to trust the client that you are working with before you take their payment(s).   I hope this helps you; and don't beat yourself up over it.   It happens to everyone at some point in time.  If you still have that person's information, you should take them to a claims court, so that you are able to get the payment you asked for in the first place.|`|AA12271055	Could you take your income tax check to a different bank and open a new account maybe?? That would be about the only thing I would know to do, unless you can go over the Teller and talk with the Bank President and hopefully get it straightened out.  Since you didn't CASH the bad check, or take any money out on it, I don't know why they are locking you for that long?  I had someone send me a check fo $3,500. one time~internet scam~and I knew it HAD to be a fraud thing, but the check looked so good, even the bank thought it was good and they said they would cash it for me, but if it ended up being bad, I would be responsible for paying it back.  I threw it away~~after taking it to police. They never could do anything about it..it was from overseas, but those scam people are GOOD! They might be waiting to see if they can find and prosecute the people who gave it to you, IF it was a local check maybe, but I still don't understand them locking you, unless they thought maybe you were in on it:(<br>  Best of Luck!|`|cHz1yQz0aa	Calm down. If you are innocent, you have nothing to worry about. Better make sure they do things right. Stand up for yourself in a civil manner.<br>  How you got a counterfeit check is anyone's guess, but if I were you, I would tell the bank exactly where you got the check from.<br>  Since you're the one who deposited it, then it is up to you to track down how the check came into YOUR hands.|`|8d6ae5a42dddca82be705f10f6b74e58aa	Get a lawyer and sue the person that issued you that check.<br>  <br>  It's illegal to make bad checks.  The person that made that counterfeit check can go to jail.|`|3aguvhqcaa	First of all who gave you that check that was counterfit?  You have to be very careful when you deposit checks that come in the mail, as I assume that is where you got that check.  Just so that you know no one will send you a check just for nothing.  If the bank is keeping your account for a 90 days hold it's for one of two reasons, it's happened before, or the amount was hight  over 1k and they are trying to find out if you are part of that or not.  Usually banks do this to cover themselves and there is really nothing you can do but cooperate with what they ask, if they need more information regarding this issue.  <br>  <br>  It's really not worth to cry as what you need are solutions.  Every bank is different so my advise to you at this point is go to the bank and ask to speak to a manager or supervisor.  Explain everything to them and if you have been with the bank for many years make sure you bring that up, and ask for an explanation on why they are holding your account for 3 months let them know how incovenient it is for you, and tell them that you want to stay with them but if they are not understanding then you will have to change banks.  There are many banks and each one wants to keep the customers and give the best customer service so you have your rights too!<br>  <br>  Good luck and remember don't cry over things that you no control over instead find solutions, and let this be a lesson to you not to deposit everything you get!  There are alot of scammers out there!  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

Half of that or less should get you a decent apartment and cover utilities anywhere in TN (less if you get a roommate).

naL774iBaa	Liquid assets are assets that are cash or near cash.  Near cash is something, for example a certificate of deposit, that can be converted into cash in a short period of time.<br>  <br>  Net worth is assets less liabilities.  Assets is what you have and liabilites is what you owe.<br>  <br>  You can lose a lot of sleep over this type of project.  Here are a couple of rules of thumbs that might make it go easier.  Be conservative on the value of assets.  For example, don't think you house is worth 2 times the last sale in your neighborhood.   Conversely, be liberal on your liabilities.  Include that $ 100 you borrowed from your no-good-cousin- you-are-still-mad-at 20 years ago.  If spend a few hours thinking about it and applying my rules of thumbs, yourretirement fund will be happy.|`|8ruwONI2aa	Liquid assets include cash and marketable securities (stocks and bonds that trade in the marketplace).  Cars, houses, boats, jewelry, art and furniture are not liquid assets (but they are assets that can be listed on a net worth statement).  <br>  <br>  Your net worth is all of your assets minus all of your debts.  Add up all your bank acounts and investments, your car and house and any significant furniture/jewlry/art (put current value not what you paid for them) and then subtract your credit card debt, mortgage, and any other loans or debts.  That's your net worth--it is possible for net worth to be negative by the way.|`|SFRlYaJ5aa	investopedia.com

IXAHsQ35aa	The best business available is the one that starts with a look at yourself first.<br>  <br>  There are lots of tremendous opportunities available.  And there are others that aren't quite as outstanding.  And there are some illegal scams being marketed, too.  That's reality.<br>  <br>  First, think about what you are passionate about and what you enjoy.  Is there a business model that fills that need?  You will be much more successful if you meld your passion with your business.<br>  <br>  Then, and this is crucial, analyze any business using these four "non-negotiables":<br>  <br>  1.  Who will mentor me?  Make sure that you have a proven mentor to guide you.  You are under no obligation to sign up with anyone and if you find an opportunity that is a good fit for you, interview potential sponsors.  Find one that is already successful and ask the tough questions about what they are going to do for you, what their track record of success is,  and what specific tools they will provide you with to help you succeed.<br>  <br>  2.  How old is the company?  Under 10% of online or home based businesses make it through the first year.  The last thing you want to do is work hard towards your dreams and have the company disappear.  It happens daily.  A good benchmark is 5 years of proven success.  Ask for third-party verification (business journals that have written about them, etc.)<br>  <br>  <br>  3.  What type of pay plan?  There are dozens of pay plans available and the vast majority of them are designed so that a few people at the top make all the money and no one else does.  If you're not sure how to judge a pay plan, find someone skilled and have them give you an honest opinion.  <br>  <br>  4.  Is it a real consumable product?  Can you hold it in your hands, drink it, eat it, burn it, or use it in your car.  If not, then you are never going to generate true residual income.  You'll just be looking for new customers every month.  The key to long term income is residual use of a real product so you get paid month after month.<br>  <br>  I am an experienced business coach with decades of successful business building and would certainly be happy to provide you with any other information you need.

Read the SBA Financing page to learn about criteria needed for borrowing <br>  <br>  It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.<br>  <br>  Nonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) <a href="http://www.cfda.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfda.gov</a> and Grants.gov <a href="http://www.grants.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.grants.gov</a> - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants.

8d7e00d2b24077f8d4f725cfd1bab01faa	To improve your credit report and score, you need to pay your debts on time. Credit card debts should be kept at the lowest possible. If for some reason you can't pay the full amount in due date, pay at least the minimum. I'm not encouraging you to do that but sometimes when you are short of funds, it is better to pay the minimum than not to pay at all or skip a payment. If you have too many credit cards, personal line of credit, the credit bureaus will see that as a negative sign. Major purchases like car financing should always be paid on time.<br>  You mentioned about bills like daycare, utilities, I don't think that will have a positive impact on your credit score. The three credit bureaus are looking at information provided by business firms such as bank(s), credit card(s), line of credit, major purchases. Your ability to pay your debts is seriously considered too. These are the things that you should focus on managing it well. If you do that, you will no doubt earn excellent credit score and that is something to be proud of.|`|2ARgi1rdaa	You cannot report them to any credit agency.

8ruwONI2aa	The widow is responsible for credit cards and other debts (car, other loans)--regardless of whether or not her name is on the account, and even regardless of whether or not she knew about those bills.  She might dispute certain debts that were only in the husbands name if they are large enough to be worth fighting--that can be a long, expensive legal process and is only an option in some states.<br>  <br>  As for the hospital bills, I don't know much about that.  I would assume that the husband's estate and/or the spouse are liable for those charges as well.  <br>  <br>  In either situation, creditors are usually very responsive and willing to work out a payment plan or even forgive some of the debt.  They know that if the debtor declares bankruptcy instead, they will likely get nothing.|`|AA10173862	I'm not sure about the hospital bills (I'm sure if libel they will negotiate a payment plan $25.00 a month) but if the credit cards were in both names, she will be responsible.

Your credit score is lowered when your available balance is over 50% of your total credit line.<br>  <br>  Finally, if you have bad or no credit and have no credit cards try to obtain two credit cards and make sure all of your monthly payments are made on time.  This will help increase your credit score.  If you cannot be approved for a unsecured credit card, obtain a secured credit card.<br>  <br>  Repairing your credit and improving your credit score is a slow process that takes time.  Just be patient and follow these steps and you should be on the road to better credit!|`|q9uybA31aa	If you can, go to a site and get a secured credit card (bank of america, orchard bank) or a store department card (Target, Walmart, ect) and just pay off the balance every month.

It never hurts to try doing that as not all the time companies respond back in time and the bad things are taken off. the only thing is that at anytime the company can add those back and you shouldn't really have the bureaus research "eroneous" inquiries... but hey a lot of people do it so do what you feel you need to do.|`|8d6ae5a42dddca82be705f10f6b74e58aa	You don't need credit to buy a house.<br>  <br>  Real Estate agents are greedy.

But with the rents included into your income. You should qualify! As long as the value is not over inflated! You need to contact a local commercial real estate loan officer! You can go to a broker or the local banks! But if your credit is so/so, I would go to the broker! The banks usually only deal with investor with some exsperience.  Well good luck!

f9a39482114c5f9844fc5040ac337bd4aa	DEFINITION: Companies that develop, own, manage, and/or operate lodging facilities, including motels and full-service hotels. <br>  <br>  In general, hotels offer two major types of services: (a) accommodation and (b) dining services. Based on the quality and extent of services provided, location, bedroom, front office/reception, food and beverage, general facilities (service and staff), and special facilities (i.e., business center, limousine services and airport transfers), hotels are further classified as Deluxe, First Class, Standard, and Economy. Hotel guests can expect a room with private bath, telephone, radio, and television, in addition to such customer services such as laundry, valet, cleaning and pressing. Aside from the services mentioned, hotels have other facilities: function rooms, ballrooms, health spas, coffee shops, dining rooms, cocktail lounges or night clubs, gift shops or newsstand-tobacco counters, and business centers for social occasions, health buffs, and business conferences. <br>  <br>  Customers of the industry include the domestic household, foreign visitors and institutional buyers. Research shows that the domestic household’s selection of hotels and other lodging facilities are affected mainly by three factors: 1) competitive pricing; 2) availability of services and facilities for children; and 3) type and extent of free services (i.e., free local calls, continental breakfast, etc.).

8ruwONI2aa	You need to understand the HELOC terms fully.  The HELOC rate is probably adjustable, meaning it could go up at any time (it may even be set up to automatically rise after 3 months, 6 months, or a year).  Understand the fees as well.  If the HELOC is set to rise, then it may not be worth it to transfer the debt; fees will outweigh potential interest savings.<br>  <br>  Even so, 6.75% is much lower than 10%.  If the HELOC is fixed for a period of time and you're trying to pay off your second mortgage within a few years, you can transfer the debt to the HELOC and pay it off even faster.  <br>  <br>  But if you'll be tempted to use the HELOC for other things (or if you're planning to) then just leave the second mortgage alone.  If you mix it up in your HELOC with other purchases, nothing will get paid down; you may wake up in 5 years with even more debt than you have today!
99IozY8Paa	Aspettativa in Dizionario dei termini sindacali e del lavoro (edit Coop 2002)<br>  <br>  Consiste nella possibilità, concessa al dipendente, di assentarsi dal lavoro per periodi di tempo più o meno lunghi e per motivi ben precisi. Di norma l’aspettativa comporta la sospensione dell’attività lavorativa e della retribuzione (v.), con una sorta di ?congelamento? del rapporto di lavoro, che riprende immediatamente quando vengono meno i motivi della richiesta di aspettativa. L’aspettativa senza assegni può essere concessa al dipendente che ne faccia espressa richiesta, previo parere favorevole espresso dall’azienda. Durante il periodo di aspettativa senza assegni non maturano le ferie (v.), nè la tredicesima mensilità; tale periodo, inoltre, non è computato ai fini della progressione in carriera, del trattamento di quiescenza e di previdenza. In alcuni casi ad esempio quando nel pubblico impiego un lavoratore viene assegnato da un’amministrazione a un’altra il periodo di aspettativa, per la durata dell’incarico, è utile ai fini del trattamento di quiescenza, di previdenza, e dell’anzianità di servizio, I contratti collettivi di lavoro (v. Ccnl) indicano, settore per settore, la durata massima dell’aspettativa e le motivazioni per cui è possibile richiederla: tra le più comuni, quelle per motivi di famiglia, di studio, per passaggio ad altre amministrazioni pubbliche, per ricongiungimento con il coniuge all’estero. L’aspettativa chiesta per malattia, ad esempio, è riconosciuta utile ai fini previdenziali. <br>  <br>  Diverso è il discorso per le aspettative richieste dai lavoratori che vengono chiamati a svolgere funzioni politiche, elettive o cariche sindacali provinciali e nazionali. In questo caso si ricade nella disciplina dello Statuto dei diritti dei lavoratori (v.), che stabilisce, oltre al ?congelamento? del rapporto di lavoro, il pagamento della retribuzione dalla struttura in cui si opera, mentre i contributi previdenziali diventano figurativi e cioè sono pagati dal sistema pensionistico e dalla collettività. In altri casi, invece, il lavoratore può usufruire del distacco, in cui il trattamento economico rimane a carico del datore di lavoro. <br>  <br>  Inoltre consultando il CCNL METALMECCANICO CONFAPI<br>  Approvazione testo definitivo:<br>  <br>  L’aspettativa per l’attività di volontariato, lavori di cura e studio può essere richiesta con un’anzianità aziendale di 7 anni (prima erano richiesti 10 anni), mentre per la cura dei bambini fino a 7 anni di età l’anzianità aziendale richiesta è di 4 anni.<br>  <br>  Quindi secondo il mio punto di vista difficilmente potrebbe esserti concessa l'aspettativa per il motivo da te descritto.|`|c7668e4798e4631b147c14b44c97f47eaa	Detta succinta succinta: non è che tu puoi metterti in aspettativa ma è il tuo datore di lavoro che te lo concede. Se non è d'accordo non puoi farci nulla, non è un tuo diritto ottenerla, ma solo una richiesta.

9HVXl03waa	In order to trade options at Scottrade you will need to submit an application to be approved for option trading. The application process does not have a set minimum income level or liquid asset amount, instead it involves a risk assessment of your particular situation. However, there is a minimum of $500.00 required to open a Scottrade account (if you do not already have one). <br>  <br>  For additional information you can call 1-800-619-7283, or locate your local Scottrade branch office by going to: <a href="http://www.scottrade.com/online_brokerage_firm_locator/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.scottrade.com/online_brokerag...</a><br>  <br>  Scottrade<br>  www.Scottrade.com<br>  1-800-619-7283|`|8ruwONI2aa	I have a Scottrade account, and last year I called and told them I wanted to be able to trade options, so they marked that on my account.  You have to have a margin account to trade options (if your account isn't on margin they can easily convert it; just call and ask).  That just means you can invest more money than you have in your account.  I'm not sure the level to which you can leverage yourself, but the account won't let you exceed it.  <br>  <br>  Obviously you need to be able to cover it if your investments lose money--last year I bought more than $8,000 worth of stocks that didn't immediately make a return.  I didn't want to sell at a loss or continue to pay the 10% interest on the margin, so I had to transfer an additional $8000 into my Scottrade account from savings. <br>  <br>  They didn't mention any requirements or minimum liquidity to get a margin account or be able to trade options.  Your income has nothing to do with it--they didn't ask me anything about myself (I'm 23 and a recent college grad--needless to say my income is not extremelly high).  I haven't traded any yet, but I know I'm able to.|`|QD5J19QTaa	I initially tried to open an options account with Scottrade which proved to be difficult and the reps didn't really understand options trading.

8ruwONI2aa	First of all, I would choose Vanguard for your investing needs.  They have great funds, all of which are no-load and are consistently rated at the top in the industry.  They also have the lowest expense ratios in the industry and a great reputation.  <br>  <br>  Next, which type of fund to choose?  That depends on when you need this money.  <br>  <br>  1.  If you don't have any emergency savings or if you need this money in 1-2 years, open the VG Prime Money Market fund ($3000 minimum).  You'll earn 5.22% (as of May) on your money and have easy access to it.  Once it swells large enough you can transfer money from it to other Vanguard funds.<br>  <br>  2.  If you need this money in 3-5 years for, say, the downpayment on a house, I'd go with the Vanguard total bond market index.  <br>  <br>  3.  If this is long term money, open the LifeStrategy growth fund for instant perfect allocation.  It's one fund that gives you 50% in the total market index, 15% in the total international index, and 10% in the total bond market index.  The rest is in the Strategic Allocation fund which is actively managed--it can go from all bonds to all stocks (it's been all stocks for years) based on the market.  They also have LifeStrategy conservative growth and moderate growth funds if you want more bonds in there.  The sooner you might need the money, the more conservative you should go.<br>  <br>  ***If you don't have a Roth IRA, open one and put $4000 in there for 2007.  Pick a target retirement date fund (just like the LifeStrategy but it gets more conservative as the years pass).***

i7GdZTLbaa	You have some hurdles to overcome and some relationships to mend but it can be done.  Even if this one doesn't go to you it will have paved the way or shut the door for future opportunities.  One way or the other you will know after this process.<br>  <br>  I'm going to tackle your issues one by one but not in the order you presented them here.<br>  <br>  1)  Supervising is leading people and not often confrontational but it does happen.  You need to be ready for it but depending on how you build relationships there may not be a need to be confrontational very often.  That being said you need to show the selection committee/people/person that you are interested, that you realize it will be demanding and very different from what you are currently doing in your job now.  Think of yourself as the creative rule enforcer - training is showing people how to do things and being a supervisor means that you aren't and/or don't want to be a proactive, responsible, deadline meeting follower any more.  Your description is typical of all of us who started out as employees vs. managers, supervisors, VP's etc.  You're wanting to shift your responsibilities and the normal ways of doing things and this is great. <br>  <br>  2)  ask yourself - really dig deep here - why you want to be become a supervisor.  (increase in responsibilities, learn new things, become a leader, contribute to the company in a different way)...  These are some ideas but the key to this is why you want to become a supervisor - what is really motivating this change.  Deadlines are important and at times crucial but you have to work with your staff meet them - you won't be the hands on person on that end in quite the same as a supervisor but the buck stops with you.<br>  <br>  3)  Everyone has aspects of jobs they hate and performance review is very much one that I detest but it is vital to a successful business venture such as yours.  You have to be honest with your employees - it is the only way to build trust (trust runs both ways - from them and from you and you must earn it).  <br>  <br>  5)  Personality issues are the toughest to overcome.  You really need to look at your strengths and weaknesses and see if this particular job is the right one for you.  When you become a supervisor you will need to check your temper at the door and not bring it to work or home after work.  The people you work with deserve better and so do the ones you love.  This will be your hardest change and the hardest thing to sell to others.  <br>  <br>  I'm wondering if your temper issue is related to how insecure you might be feeling in certain situations - whatever they are for you.  If so, then you need to figure out new ways of handling both your temper and your insecurities.  Not easy but do-able.<br>  <br>  6)  I keep wondering why you need to keep a poker face in the midst of crisis?  If the situation is stressful a neutral face doesn't build confidence but a reflective, thoughtful, and knowledgeable face does.  <br>  <br>  7)  Now for something really important - no one ever comes to their first supervisory position with previous experience but they do come with life experiences that show leadership potential.  For example, if you are just out of college (I don't think you are but I had to choose an age here)  and you were head of the homecoming parade for the homecoming weekend (football).  This shows a willingness to and opportunity for leading others toward a common goal.  So think outside the box of the job in this area.  I bet you have something to build on (past and near present and present times if you can).  And act confidence (insecurity may still be rampant but you act confident in yourself and your abilities and be able to talk about them).  <br>  <br>  Good luck and hope this helps.|`|84978RbJaa	It is good that you know your weaknesses and strengths, even leaders are human.  When you lead a team, you must have integrity, sense of responsibility, passion, vision and peopleskill.  <br>  <br>  If you know what it takes to influence people, you will become aware of what you should not do.   Be mindful to not be aggressive but assertive.     Since you know what your weaknesses are, which is your temper, then work on improving that.   Learn to detach, dont get personal - dont allow ppl the chance to see you losing control.<br>  <br>  Think positively about people, see their strengths, this will force you to focus on positive things.   Often times, we lose our temper because we focus on the negatives.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.   I have been there.

27fbb3f88f6c18b121049b5f27b91921aa	5S stands for Sort, Straighten, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain, as translated into English.<br>  <br>  5S's basic philosophy is "A place for everything and everything in its place."<br>  <br>  Basically, you would take an office and go through every item in the office. Put them into three piles: Always use, Might use, and Never use. <br>  <br>  If it's in the "Never use" pile, remove it. It's taking up space that can be used for things that you actually value. In Lean manufacturing, which uses 5S, this sort of thing is called "Muda" or waste. <br>  <br>  Muda is also found when an employee can't find a tool that they need to use. The time spent searching is muda. So 5S is used to put everything in the best place it can be, and then marking that spot for the tool to be returned to after use.<br>  <br>  You will need to go through the "Might use" pile next. You will need to get the input of everyone that uses the office (you don't want to throw away something someone uses) especially if you want to engender employee buy-in.<br>  <br>  After you've Srted the "Might use" pile into either "Use" or "Never use" you are ready to start agreeing on the layout of the office. Again, get employee input. They are closest to the work and have the best perspective on where they need the tools to be. "Tools" is as defined by your specific situation (I'm in manufacturing). Adapt as necessary.<br>  <br>  Then, label and mark a spot for each tool. That's the Straighten and Standardize part. A place for everything.<br>  <br>  You want your employees to return everything to its exact spot so the next employee will be able to easily find it when they need it. This is the Sustain. <br>  <br>  It's also about keeping everything neat and orderly in the office as well.... Shine. Shine can be used anywhere, really. Keep it clean!<br>  <br>  That's it in a nutshell. There's a lot more to it... I'd do some internet research, if I were you.... Good Luck!|`|dc60e510fafacfa459193c01186bd6e0aa	i dont know what the"5S′s Japanese technique" is

EoLrGMjwaa	0% rates are usually introductory offers.  For example, they will say 0% for all purchases for the first year, or so.  After that, those rates can be anything, but the cheapest cards are usually about 10%.  Most are 12.99 or higher.  If you want to finance a car, almost all of the time the best way is to finance it with a regular auto loan.  Most people do it like that because it’s the cheapest way to finance a car.  This is because auto loans are fixed interest, and credit cards are revolving credit accounts.  The difference is in how the loans are amortized.  There is a lot of information online about amortization and how it works, so you can look that up, but the bottom line is that a loan made with a credit card at 9.9% will cost you thousands and thousands of dollars more than at 15% regular car loan.  But, if you are going to pay that car off within a year, or during the 0% introductory period, the credit card can be a good bet. <br>  <br>  By the way, after you pay on time for one or two credit cards you will get offers with the 0%.  And you will never stop getting them for the rest of your life.  Those credit card guys will find you, and pound you with offers forever!!!

Interest rates don't matter as long as you always pay the card off each month.  The problem I have with your question is that it seems you WANT to charge things and keep a balance, and that's the last thing an 18 year old should do.  You can certainly have a card, but it should be for emergencies and small stuff you can pay off each month and have a ZERO balance.  Please don't make the mistake that 80% of young people do and ruin your early financial life with credit card debt!!!|`|Ja2jgHQLaa	There is no such thing as a 0% loan. It might be same as cash for a few years, which means if you pay off the whole loan by the end of those few years, then no interest builds, but if you don't pay it off, all that interest that accrued over those few years all the sudden is there.

f9a39482114c5f9844fc5040ac337bd4aa	In the absence of context or clues, my advice is to say it is a current liability. It's a liability if it's a deferred commission revenue and it's a liabililty if it's a deferred commission expense. The difference is that it it's a deferred comm. rev., you reverse it to revenue when the commission is earned and if it's deferred comm. exp. you reduce it by paying it off so your entry in future would be a cash entry. It's probably commission expense that you owe your sales agents who've gotten sales for you but perhaps due to certain conditions not met yet, you haven't paid out the commission but you'd have to in future. But that's all for the future. For now, the answer must be a liability.|`|m7KHEvVXaa	It would only become a Deferred Commission Revenue if the company is engaged in a marketing or brokerage business. Then it would be classified as an asset.<br>  <br>  If the nature of the business is not given, generally it should be Deferred Commission Expense, which is usually the case.<br>  And this is classified as a liability.

Therefore, the annual amortization of the bond is 19,792.75 (395,855/20).<br>  <br>  <br>  The annual interest expense on the bond is 1,560,000 (20,000,000*7.8%).<br>  <br>  The amortization of discount increases interest expense, therefore, the total annual interest expense is 1,579,792.75 (1,560,000 + 19,792,.75).<br>  <br>  Under the straight line method, the annual interest expense is equal for each year.

h5VmlzcFaa	A few suggestions:  <br>  <br>  If you can get your hands on any income tax returns, that should give you a good chunk of what you are looking for.  If you or your parent company gets audited on a regular basis, get your hands on the audit files.  They certainly would have taken a look at that.  Also, if you have regular audits, call the CPA firm and see if they can provide you with any schedules they've received or find the schedules that were provided to them.<br>  <br>  Look back if you can on your asset accounts in G/L and see what info you can dig up (hopefully you use an accounting package with a G/L module that contains history).  <br>  <br>  Do you have a PO system?  Maybe you can start to piece some of the puzzle together with PO history reports (that were coded to asset accounts).<br>  <br>  If the transferred assets are on your books, there must be some documentation on the transaction(s) that moved them down from the parent company, or if it was something like an inter-company transaction, maybe they have some source documents available. <br>  <br>  Take any of that information and contact vendors for source documentation.  Once you get it pieced together, tag them and start fresh.<br>  <br>  If none of that gets you anywhere, sounds like maybe a revaluation might be in order.  Start from scratch.<br>  <br>  My two cents.
f9a39482114c5f9844fc5040ac337bd4aa	It probably starts with you placing an order for some goods. When the goods arrive, you need to pass a journal entry in the purchases journal to record the purchase of merchandise inventory. This will find its way subsequently into the general ledger (GL). In the course of business, you'd need to make payments to other vendors and employees. These entries will be in the cash book and subsequently into the GL. When you make a sale, you need to pass journal entries too. These will be in the sales journal which will again find their way into the GL. When your customers pay you, these are again cash book entries, again ending up in the GL. From the GL you extract your trial balance, then pass adjusting journal entries, then you'll have your adjusted TB from which you can prepare your income statement and balance sheet. This is as brief as I can make it.|`|m7KHEvVXaa	Accounting cycle is the whole accounting process of recording, classifying, analyzing, presenting and interpreting data.<br>  <br>  Recording is called journalizing, because in this phase you make an entry to a journal, on a per transaction basis.<br>  <br>  Classifying is called posting, because in this phase you post to the ledger, per account, all the transactions you have recorded in your journal.<br>  <br>  And then you extract the balances of your ledger accounts and come up with a trial balance. You are now in the analyzing phase. You make necessary adjustments to your trial balance.<br>  <br>  From the adjusted trial balance you can now present the datas in an income statement and a balance sheet.<br>  <br>  In the interpretation phase, you make use of ratios like current ratio, debt to equity ratio, etc. to determine the liquidity, solvency, profitability, etc. of the company. This is to help decision makers.<br>  <br>  That's it.

If you read the details of how the analysts do there ratings that should tell you what they expect to see and how they came to that conclusion.<br>  <br>  Just remember no one raises or lowers the price of a stock.  That is illegal.  The price must be determined by the free market.  It's a supply and demand scenario.  People buy because they think they are buying at a good price vs. the value or growth potential of the company.  So the more stock that is bought the higher the price goes.  The more it is sold the lower the price goes.<br>  <br>  Not very clear I know.  Hope that helps.

It is about you just as much as them!<br>  <br>  I find with that mind set your confidence grows, look at it as buying a new car, you want to know as much about it before you commit.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps?<br>  <br>  Simon<br>  <br>  my site: <a href="http://www.diamond4jobs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.diamond4jobs.com</a>|`|ueOW2mjLaa	No problem dear, I have had same feelings several times.

There are differences from country to country, as their laws differ, but the general idea is the same.<br>  <br>  Typically, European countries are somewhat different from the US: in the US, the same formal legal structure is often used for both private and public corporate businesses of wildly varying sizes, while in Europe there's a form that's intended for larger publicly-traded corporations. My understanding is that the S.p.A. form fits the large public corporation, but I'm not certain of all the details.

So, until your parents stop claiming you, if they are currently, then you must claim 0.  As for living out on your own, I really am not sure about that one.  <br>  <br>  Just remember, the more you claim, the less taxes they take out of your paycheck and the more likely you are to have to pay in at the end of the year when you do taxes.  <br>  |`|wFzizI2faa	the only thing on there that would apply to you is dependence.

In any case, you would pay tax on the amount rolled over.  Assuming you still work for the employer the 401(k) is with, you probably can't roll the 401(k) into ANY IRA.

Then im thinking of packing in my day job and doing this full time.<br>  <br>  For more information, please e-mail me.|`|qJrC4qLXaa	You are probably receiving a lot of information about possible work from home jobs. I have been in your shoes and have spent many hours online researching and trying to find the right one.  The one thing that I ended up figuring out is that there are no true work from home "jobs."  In a work from home job you usually start out working for a company and then for whatever reason, sometimes, the company will let you take your job home; thus work from home job.  I would never pay a company to work from home.<br>  <br>  However, there are many work from home “opportunities.”  These opportunities provide you with the vehicle to work from home and build your own business.  The difficult or frustrating part about finding the right opportunity is that there are many offers that are not legitimate, but scams.  Theses scams make it difficult for the companies that truly offer a legitimate opportunity to work from home.  Usually, work from home opportunities have a small investment to start your own business.  These are okay as long as they are around $100, anything much more than that and I would stay away.  Also if they require a monthly overhead to run the business it should include things like your websites, training, back office system, and support.  Remember any business that you start and want to continue will always have start up costs and monthly expenses, if it doesn't then it is probably not a legit business.     <br>  <br>  I am a stay at home mother of 2 (ages 4 and 2).  My husband works 6 days a week and I do not have much help in the area of child care for my children.  On my journey to finding the right work from home opportunity I tried everything from selling vitamins, lotions and many other product based companies.  I also looked into processing information online.  What I realized with all these companies is that I usually put more money back into my business and ended up with lots of product I really did not need.  I also was very skeptical of some of those online work from home websites that really never got to the point of what I would be doing to earn income.<br>  <br>  Finally, I was given information on a legitimate work from home company.  At first I was very skeptical and paid no attention to the information.  Then one day my mother needed to have some dental work done but had no insurance.  I remembered that I had some information on discount dental plans.  Once I researched the information I had been given, I realized that I could provide my mother with a way to pay less for her procedure and earn an income for signing her onto the discount dental plan.  I have been with the company since and am on the fast track toward building a residual income.<br>  <br>  I work 15 hours a week (give or take a few) for a National Discount Medical Benefits Company.  The company has been in business for over 16 years and is continuing to expand!  We have been featured on "60 minutes", "The New York Times", "Wall Street Journal", "Time Magazine", and "American Medical Review" as one of the most reputable, legitimate home based companies.  We are members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Dental Plans and the owner of the company sits on the board of The Consumer Health Alliance, which we are also a part of their membership.<br>  <br>  Our company addresses the number one problem in US, which is that 70% of Americans can't afford or can't get health insurance for whatever reason.  We are an alternative for people who are suffering with their health because of this issue.  Now to work for our company you don't have to know everything there is to know about Health Care.  Our company will train you on how to communicate our services to those who need it.  We have over 2 million members that use our plans and save money on their health care. <br>  <br>  When you work for the company you are able to set your own hours and build a residual income while you work.  Because we get paid month after month, year after year for the work we do our income is always increasing and we get paid even when we don’t work.  The company also does not enforce a monthly quota, which was important to me.  I wanted to have the flexibility to work when I wanted and how much I wanted.   Of course the more you put into your business the more income you will receive. <br>  <br>  Some of the benefits we offer are 401k, direct deposit, life insurance and a family benefit package for your entire household.  The next best thing is there is no cold calling, telemarketing, stocking of inventory, collecting of payments, and no home parties!  This was very important to me as I had the child care issue to deal with and wanted to be able to stay home and work without having to leave my house. <br>  <br>  Another great thing about our company is that we all work together to as a team.  We are not out to compete with our fellow representatives.  Whenever I need advice my team is there to help me to be a success.  This was also very important as I was new to the business and wanted the team support you get working a 9-5 job without having to work the 9-5 job.   I have also made many friends along the way and still have the interaction with adults while taking care of my children at home.<br>  <br>  I guess I could go on and on about what we do and how we get paid, but the best thing for you to do is research the company for yourself and determine if it is right for you.  <br>  <br>  Check us out at www.AHomeBusinessThatPays.com.|`|xybKEBTvaa	Online tutoring has taken off lately:|`|zuPd5hu1aa	Check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bragzpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bragzpress.com</a><br>  <br>  They offer hundreds of custom personalized products at resale prices.

My fiancee' and I went through a similar situation working at Sonics. We finally decided that we deserved more and went for it. Now I work full time in Human Resources, but now with a 1 year old son, I still wanted to work from home. I came across a great company a few years ago but didn't jump into it right away due to the "scam" stigma that comes with home-based opportunities. But after years of keeping up with the company, I finally decided to give it a try, and I haven't looked back! I currently average anywhere from $300 - $500/month working an hour a day. Very part time! Now my goal is to reach $1000/month by the end of this year, but with the new breakthroughs the company has coming up, I will be beyond that! All I do is share with others how they can save money on their health or dental care costs, or how they can too make money from home. I was trained how to "market", so that prospectives come to me, I love it! If you want more info, go to www.dailychecksathome.com and listen to the story of Janie Jones. She reached 6 figures after being with the company for 3 years! That gives you an idea of both sides of the coin. After you review the recording/video on the site, contact me via Answers and we will see what you and I can come up with!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Trhonda|`|99c4bdb96fbbce2446cc584a907512caaa	I work from home with Work At Home United!<br>  I have worked many jobs online,so far this is <br>  the best!

Which means that I am qualified to work as a CNA as well as a PCT in the hospitals doing phlebotomy, ECG's, Monitor Tech, Catheter Insertion among a lot of other things. I was able to get into a good hospital and my pay is almost $16 hourly here in Jacksonville ,FL. Be sure to chose a facility that has 5 star standards because they can afford to pay you a whole lot more and it looks really good on your resume to have worked for that facility. By the way, I have only been certified about a month now. I am actually going to go ahead and work my way to an RN. Good luck you, I hope this helps! And the state test was a wiz because my school actually did a 2 day refresher before we tested and it definitely helped. Plus check with your state's board of nursing. You may be able to obtain sample CNA tests online just so you can see what you're up against. The biggest thing is making sure you get the skills portion down packed.  The written portion is pretty much common sense. You'll be ok!

Thus, it can simply "disappear" via writeoffs and what not. |`|z4EmXdE1aa	I've been wondering this about our economy... If ours is down where is it up?  Because in theory the use of money is very similar to the creation and destruction of matter and I feel like I'm about to answer both of our questions.<br>  <br>  Here is the answer to your question though:<br>  The reason banks have lost money on bad mortgages and in part the reason the mortgages are bad to begin with is that the money just isn't there.  For instance, the lack of regulation on the mortgage market allowed things like this to happen:  A family with a combined yearly income of $60,000 have been allowed to take out a $500,000 loan on a house that requires a payment of $50,000 a year (very simple example, don't hold me on the realistic-ness of it).  You might say oh, well they'll have $10,000 left over, but after paying for utilities, food, school, clothes, cars, ect. there is just no way they are able to make the payments they are supposed to.  So the problem is, the money hasn't gone anywhere because since this is a problem largely with the credit market (also: cars, student loans, ect.) and the lenders perpetuity to give out these unstable loans means that individuals made financial commitments that they couldn't meet.  That coupled with the devaluing of houses due to foreclosures and lack of demand (obviously among other things) have made the loners ability to seize the collateral almost worthless (say for instance the family from above was unable to pay anymore, they only had paid $80,000 and now the house is only worth $320,000 so the bank gave out $500,000 in credit but only ends up collecting $400,000 thus putting them $100,000 in the hole) multiply this several times and you are in a huge mess.<br>  <br>  Again this is a very basic explanation but is a rough explanation of what's happening.

Once you find job advertisements, apply to them and contact the company to tell them what your plans are and what you are looking for.  Hopefully you will succeed in finding something that will bring you to Canada.  I want to wish you the best of luck and hope your dream to move to Canada comes true.  Raymonde (Canadian)

Daq9gituaa	Based on the info you provided your earnings for one year would be about $11,700. Assuming you cannot be claimed as a dependent by your parents and you are single, the following is a breakdown of your weekly pay check and claiming one withholding allowance on your W-4:<br>  <br>  Weekly Gross Pay -  $225.00 <br>  Federal Withholding -  $10.67 <br>  Social Security -  $13.95 <br>  Medicare -  $3.26 <br>  Maryland -  $6.16 <br>  Net Pay -  $190.96<br>  <br>  If you were to work 52 weeks at the same pay scale in 2008, then you would pay taxes on $2750 and you would have a tax liability of $271.00. From the example above, you would have an overpayment of $283.84 for the year. If you were to claim 2 withholding allowances on your W-4 then you would owe about $66.00 when you filed your taxes. That would allow you to have more of your paycheck in you pocket each week but when filing you would have to pay about $66.00<br>  <br>  The results will be a bit different for tax year 2009 as the standard deduction and exemption amounts will increase which will reduce your tax liability a bit. <br>  |`|AA10469473	If you are not their dependent, your federal income tax liability for the year will be around $275.  If you are their dependent, around $625.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	Married? Single? Children? Own your own home? Have any big medical expenses? Interest or dividends from investments? Educational expenses? All of these things can make a big difference in the amount of taxes you'll need to pay.<br>  <br>  You'll have taxes withheld from your paycheck all year long. At the end of the year you'll fill out your tax return and submit it. When you do that, you'll calculate everything you owe, subtract everything that's been withheld, and find out whether you'll be getting a refund or whether you have to pay more to the IRS.<br>  <br>  With such a low income (and especially if you're single and not a homeowner) you'll probably get back everything you have withheld during the year -- which won't be that much to begin with.<br>  |`|02fbb4641d7549de08946f8490ae69bfaa	I assume that you are employed and receiving wages.<br>  <br>  If you were not a full-time student in 2008, or you paid for over half of your own support, you will claim your own exemption.  Your taxable income is about $1,050.  You will owe about $105 in income tax.  Any additional amount withheld from your pay will be refunded to you.<br>  <br>  If you were a full-time student in 2008 and you did not pay for over half of your own support, then you will not claim yourself.  Your taxable income is about $4,550.  You will owe about $455 in tax.<br>  <br>  You will owe small amounts to the State of Maryland in either case.|`|6d1c56bb07d8433546ab2691bb56e09baa	I don't know the exact percentage you are paying in taxes but I believe it's somewhere around 20-25%.  It might differ from state to state for state taxes but federal everyone pays one set percent but I am not really sure.  I know I make the same amount as you and sure pay a lot each week out of my paycheck.  Those that make quite a bit more, unfairly pay a lot less taxes than we do.  |`|SZ5NZ9uaaa	The tax would be very small.  The main tax you would pay is 7.65% social security tax.

AA12065007	That's not the reason.<br>  <br>  Say you have $100,000.00 in available credit on credit cards but no balances. Some lenders (not all) will add that amount to your potential debt should you run out and max them all out and if you did that and based on your income could not make the payments on the loan you asked for they may either decline your application or offer a smaller amount.|`|x6UJe8jkaa	Having a credit card for any amount is the same as being approved for a loan for that amount so if you have credit cards totaling $20k limit and your credit score says you're only good to loan $50k to then you can only borrow another $30k in a conventional loan. |`|U7nj9Kg4aa	When you take out a loan, banks use a calculation called a Total Debt Service Ratio (TDSR).  When they calculate that they need to include the total amount of credit available to the person at the time of application.<br>  <br>  IF you have 5 credit cards with no balances, it's not a big deal normally, but if you have this loan, as well as 5 credit cards that are maxed out becuase you fall on hard times?  That's a lot of payments that you might not be able to make.  It's really to make sure the applicant doesn't get in over thier head and claim bankruptcy, and the bank is out of their money as well.  IT's to protect both the lender and the applicant.<br>  <br>  If you have multiple credit cards why not cancel a few?  There's really not a lot of point to having that much available credit.  If you cancel afew you might be able to get the few that are left to have a larger limit if you really need the cash that bad.|`|6d1c56bb07d8433546ab2691bb56e09baa	It sure can!  Banks dont really like to give out loans to people who have other loans or even credit cards that amount to more than they make in a year or month.  So, if you make say, $60,000 per year and have a $20,000 loan and say 4 credit cards, your chances of getting a large loan may be less.|`|a2646c11cee413f85dabf33002b34080aa	That is very true...getting a loan in general all depends on your credit rating. How much is on the credit cards, late payments, school loans, car loans, etc. All these things affect someones ability to get a loan. |`|AA10008319	Exactly. There's a potential for too much outstanding debt with the debt to income ratio.|`|WcHddltkaa	It comes down to the person's credit rating and the ability to repay.

Being the Manager, if no petty cash in place or rules, maybe you can put some in place.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Generally, no.  However:<br>  <br>  1. If you are a paid employee, then you might be able to argue that it is an employee business expense.  <br>  2. If the organization or club is a charity, you could donate the items to the charity for the charity to give to the youth.  If you designate specific youth, then you are not eligible for a deduction.  The deduction applies only if the charity decides which youth receive the items.|`|SZ5NZ9uaaa	You can only deduct them if you donate to the organization, not if you give them directly from yourself to the recipients.

Also understand who’s your market (example: there isn’t to many men buying lipstick, well I guess that would depend where your from), how large is it, is your product a need or want.

The cost of living is high but the salaries are high too.  I believe it's slightly higher than Winnipeg, which explains why so many people are moving to Alberta.  Strange that you cannot find a salary scale to compare to on the Internet.  Try Google and type in Alberta Salary scales and see what you find.  I wish you good luck.  By the way, I have been to Winnipeg a few times.  I lived in Thompson for a couple years just for the experience.  Two years was enough for me though.  Good luck.
R4v7Xvynaa	What types of homes will qualify for the tax credit?<br>  Any home that will be used as a principal residence will qualify for the credit. This includes single-family detached homes, attached homes like townhouses and condominiums, manufactured homes (also known as mobile homes) and houseboats. The definition of principal residence is identical to the one used to determine whether you may qualify for the $250,000 / $500,000 capital gain tax exclusion for principal residences.<br>  <br>  Who is eligible to claim the tax credit?<br>  First-time home buyers purchasing any kind of home—new or resale—are eligible for the tax credit. To qualify for the tax credit, a home purchase must occur on or after January 1, 2009 and before December 1, 2009. For the purposes of the tax credit, the purchase date is the date when closing occurs and the title to the property transfers to the home owner.<br>  <br>  <br>  What is the definition of a first-time home buyer?<br>  The law defines "first-time home buyer" as a buyer who has not owned a principal residence during the three-year period prior to the purchase. For married taxpayers, the law tests the homeownership history of both the home buyer and his/her spouse.<br>  <br>  For example, if you have not owned a home in the past three years but your spouse has owned a principal residence, neither you nor your spouse qualifies for the first-time home buyer tax credit. However, unmarried joint purchasers may allocate the credit amount to any buyer who qualifies as a first-time buyer, such as may occur if a parent jointly purchases a home with a son or daughter. Ownership of a vacation home or rental property not used as a principal residence does not disqualify a buyer as a first-time home buyer.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.federalhousingtaxcredit.com/2009/faq.php#10" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalhousingtaxcredit.com/2...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  This is a great website, it will answer many of your questions.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  I am talking about the $8000 tax credit that was just passed, that is what this website refers too, not the $7500 that has to be paid back.|`|O71xlcG3aa	Let me tell you what I just found out from my CPA.  There IS a $7500 tax credit for house bought after April 9th BUT you have to pay it back a percentage at a time starting two years from the tax period that you claim it.  So really it isn't a tax credit!|`|VpjQpAOYaa	Married couples do qualify, but if you make more than $150,000 combined, you will have a reduced benefit.<br>  <br>  If you have not owned a home in the past 3 years, you will qualify as a FTHB.<br>  <br>  This has nothing to do with which mortgage company you use.<br>  <br>  The first poster is referring to the $7,500 tax credit, which is basically an interest free loan.

0lCnu1g2aa	I got fired/resigned for refusing to commit medicare fraud!! I was told my assessments did not accurately reflect the patients condition by the bean counter QI nurse who has never seen the patient!!!!!!!!! That place refused to believe that 85 year old people can dress and bathe themselves without help!!!!!   I hated that job, and they did not like the fact I had to take off for surgery 2.5 months after I started there, and ended up taking 3 weeks off, not 2 as originally planned. Came back and worked 4 days before I parted ways with them, I also told them how I felt about the way they treat thier employess and run the business. <br>  <br>  Bottom line is you DID do the right thing, and the boss did not. I would say file for unemployment, even if they dont give it to you. You get the chance to tell what happened to the state and they have to answer back to them, well at least in MO.  I would start applying to every job you may be qualified for and call them after a few days with your application. It helps keep your name in the head of the person doing the hiring.  When asked why you left/ were  fired, tell them about what happened. I would respect somebody for doing the right thing.|`|hR87A418aa	CALL UR LOCAL NEWS CHANNEL n telling what happen im sure they will love to hear ur story n put it on the news and even ask ur x boss why he fired u for doing the right thing...

I guess cause I had an attitude that someone would steal from me, maybe that's why I was let go.
