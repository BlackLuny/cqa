And why was the Song of Solomon added to the Bible?  The whole book is basically about attraction between two lovers.  God is not just about taking away all of our fun, in fact, if you get close to him, and really study,  living a Christian life is very fun and exciting and you never really know what God is up to, you just know whatever it is, you won't be left in the dark.

If a creature reproduces asexually then its offspring have a lower chance of adding or passing on any beneficial genes, and beneficial changes to an entire population take longer.

Okay, I am seriously starting to wonder if people who ask evolution questions even think before they post.|`|Kbry7CnOaa	It shows that we have evolved up from bacteria, which are a form of plants.     Some plants, e.g. kiwi fruit, marijuana and papaya need both a male and female plant in order to reproduce. In similar fashion it is bacteria which evolved this ability that became animals and therefore humans.    It is the evolution of sex approx. 1 billion years ago which allowed both plants (which have both male and female parts) and animals to diversify far more quickly . Some animals such as worms etc are asexual, but for most it is an evolutionary advantage to have one gender to rear their offspring and another to protect the family.    ED: No both male and female would have to have evolved at the same time, because a species evolves as one. That's not to say it couldn't happen, but a species would get to far if it were all male or all female.     Early on, some of the species animals evolved from would have become been the bearers  of offspring and other wouldn't have been. Everything else which make a male male and a female female would have fallen into place after that.|`|SZTm6mwmaa	What a great question Matthew .

Sexual reproduction evolved very early in life on this planet. Plants reproduce asexually, but that is because they have both male and female organs. Only single celled organisms reproduce without a "gender" and then that is by splitting themselves into perfect copies of themselves. Evolution means just that, not making a copy of something else but changing what you had from the original and for that you need more than one source, hence sexual reproduction.

God made Women so that Man had a companion, and for the procreation of children.|`|faceb0da83e7b433b86d3ae6836703f3aa	God evolved Adam out of red dirt. And then let him go look at the animals who all were male & female. Then Adam was lonely.    So? God put the man to sleep & took out of his side a rib and evolved a helper for him. And she was a she.    So the man saw this woman & said, "A man shall leave his parents & cling to his wife & they two shall be one flesh.'     And thus they both really evolved from the same source, a pile of red dust. But the woman evolved from the man.    In the beginning God created the heavens & the earth & the Holy Spirit hovered over the waters like a big bird. And thus, the egg came first. The eggs birthed & they grew into fish, etc... And their babies were male & female. Some were both male & female.    But some of them evolved into birds. And the waters brought forth birds that evolved to the land. And so other egg bearers evolved to land, like lizards & amphibians. And some of thes birds kept growing & so did some of the amphibians. Since no one died.    And also, the earth then brought forth beast, from the dirt. And I would guess they started out female and had boys & girls. Maybe God evolved both male & female animals from the earth.    But man came later from a pile of dirt. And God formed the dirt & breath life into man who became a living soul. But he was a lonely soul. So?   God said, "Let us make man in our Image.". In in the image of God (Elohim) God made He them, man & woman.|`|eDYXQxA9aa	Because we evolved from a species that required sex in order to reproduce. Pretty obvious really.

a8kAassWaa	How does God's sovereignty work together with free will?"    : It is impossible for us to fully understand the dynamics of a holy God molding and shaping the will of man. Scripture is clear that God knows the future (Matthew 6:8; Psalm 139:1-4) and has total sovereign control over all things (Colossians 1:16-17; Daniel 4:35). The Bible also says that we must choose God or be eternally separated from Him. We are held responsible for our actions (Romans 3:19; 6:23; 9:19-21). How these facts work together is impossible for a finite mind to comprehend (Romans 11:33-36).    People can take one of two extremes in regard to this question. Some emphasize the sovereignty of God to the point that human beings are little more than robots simply doing what they have been sovereignly programmed to do. Others emphasize free will to the point of God not having complete control and/or knowledge of all things. Neither of these positions is biblical. The truth is that God does not violate our wills by choosing us and redeeming us. Rather, He changes our hearts so that our wills choose Him. We love Him because He first loved us (1 John 4:19), and You did not choose me, but I chose you (John 15:16).     What are we to do then? First, we are to trust in the Lord, knowing that He is in control (Proverbs 3:5-6). Gods sovereignty is supposed to be a comfort to us, not an issue to be concerned about or debate over. Second, we are to live our lives making wise decisions in accordance with Gods Word (2 Timothy 3:16-17; James 1:5). There will be no excuses before God for why we chose to disobey Him. We will have no one to blame but ourselves for our sin. Last but not least, we are to worship the Lord, praising Him that He is so wonderful, infinite, powerful, full of grace and mercyand sovereign.|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	Same way you give your kid a choice on something but you know how he will decide anyway.

Obviously, man as god created him was not perfect.  He couldn't have been and have chosen incorrectly.|`|Mnm35sjNaa	Darwin's natural selection tells us that our greatest attribute (intelligence) is necessarily evolved to do what it does: make choices.  Whether or not free will is God-given, evolved or an illusion is not really the issue.  We do, in fact, make choices.  The real question is: In a deterministic universe, ruled by causality, can free will also exist?    There's no proof for ANY answer.  I, personally, believe that free will coexists with determinism.  I believe living beings can't be viewed in the same light as inanimate objects (stars, planet, atoms, comets, chairs, rocks, etc.)  The free will we have is limited in as much as our options are limited.  We are not gods and are confined to physical laws.    The field of neuroscience has made large strides recently but the free will versus determinism controversy is nowhere closer to resolution.  Determinism and compatibilism have both garnered supporting evidence (though determinism seems to have the edge for now).  Google "CEMI theory" for more information about a leading theory that supports compatibilism.    For argument's sake, I'll assume there is a God who gave us free will.  If he did, then he can no longer intervene in human affairs: that would be usurping our free will.  That means that God CAN'T be a personal God who meddles in our affairs (answer prayers, perform miracles, slay enemies, wipe out cities, etc.).  Once he gave us free will, he switched from personal God to cosmic God . . . from meddler to observer.    But if God did NOT give us free will, we are simply puppets dancing to God's tune.  We would have no morality, responsibility or accountability.    Christian apologists have tried, for hundreds of years, to explain away this logical conundrum.  But they can't (without resorting to circular logic).  If you insist on a supernatural creator, then God either gave us free will or he didn't.  If he didn't, he judges and punishes us for lives we had no control over.  If he did, then all his interventions described in the bible contradict the free will he supposedly gave us.    The question of free will cuts to the core of scriptural legitimacy and reveals the lies that dogma is intended to cover up.|`|AA12045679	God knows what your going to do becuase he knows your heart.

eO2rnf7yaa	I'm Roman Catholic,  and I can't imagine why anyone would preach or advocate hatred of "non-catholic Christians".   That is profoundly contrary to Roman Catholicism, and I suspect anyone preaching it was trying to make Catholics look bad.  In any case, such rubbish is profoundly contrary to Roman Catholicism.  Hatred is a sin.    The word "Pope" is not in the Bible.  Neither is the word "Trinity".    That doesn't matter though, because the false doctrine of "Sola Scriptura" is not in The Bible either.  The Catholic Church assembled the Bible.  It is a Church document.  The Church does not defy the Bible, but The Church is not limited to The Bible.   Sacred Tradition has been an important part of Christianity since the beginning of Christianity.  If you disagree with the Catholic Church, try reading the Catechism of The Catholic Church.  If you are sure we are wrong, you might be able to better prove we are wrong if you first learn what we really believe and teach.    One thing all honest Christians preach is Peace.  Thus I extend to you what Christ gave to me for free - Peace be with you.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	The pope doesn't dress like a king.    The pope doesn't act like he's invincible.

GO!|`|AA10034051	The word Pope is another word for "father' . The Pope is the Bishop of Rome. You have heard of bishops havent you? They are in the bible      The position of Pope was established by Christ and the office has been maintained in an apostolic manner since the time of Christ.    Jesus asked his disciples "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?" The disciples then offered various answers - "Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets." But the question that Jesus then asked was crucial: "But who do you say that I am?"         The answer provided by Simon Peter set in motion the formation of the Catholic Church by Jesus. "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God." With this answer, Jesus established the Catholic Church with Simon Peter designated the first Pope.        "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah. For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly Father. And so I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."    Around or about 45 AD, Peter went to Rome and from there lead the Catholic Church. As of today, there have been 266 Popes in direct succession to Peter.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	OK, you got us.

Protestants are in the bible though, they were killed by God for rebelling or protesting against the Divinely instituted authority of Moses. One thing our Lord tells us is that "a divided house cannot stand." Sounds like the Protestant house, which began with the Heretic John Hus and now numbers in the tens of thousands. Hus was burned at the stake and is aptly now burning in Hell. Which is worse? The same punishment was meted out by Almighty God against the Protestant Core in Moses' time. Read it, it's in the Catholic Bible, a book written by men, inspired by God, who were members of the Catholic Church. Not the modern Roman Protestant Church of today but the Roman Catholic Church.    Outside of the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church, founded by Jesus Christ, born of the Blessed Virgin Mary, true God and true Man, there is absolutely no salvation.|`|AA11440601	The word Pope was coined much later but the role or job of Pope is clearly indicated in the Bible.    John 21:15-17 states:     When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Feed my lambs."     He then said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Tend my sheep."     He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter was distressed that he had said to him a third time, "Do you love me?" and he said to him, "Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you." (Jesus) said to him, "Feed my sheep.     Matthew 16:17-19 states:    Jesus said to him in reply, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah. For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly Father. And so I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."     The Catholic Church believes the Lord made Simon alone, whom he named Peter, the "rock" of his Church. He gave him the keys of his Church and instituted him shepherd of the whole flock.    The Pope is the senior pastor of 1.1 billion Catholic Christians, the direct successor of Simon Peter.    The Popes main roles include teaching, sanctifying, and governing.    For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 880-882: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...    + Many "Christian" words are not found in the Bible:    ? Adventist  ? Anglican  ? Beatitude  ? Catholic  ? Christmas  ? Easter  ? Congregational  ? Creed  ? Epiphany  ? Eucharist  ? Hell  ? Incarnation  ? Lutheran  ? Martyr  ? Mennonite  ? Methodist  ? Orthodox  ?

Banned From The Bible II  Part 1 of 12: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i57BB0IG...    The Seven Deadly Sins  http://www.history.com/genericContent.do...    I challenge all of you to actually learn about your religion The History of it Read the actual book from cover to cover and not let some guy in a dress and silly hat tell you what it Really Means.    Why hide from reality? Do facts frighten you THAT MUCH that you are wiling to hide your head in the sand forever?    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *    Did you know that the common description of hell being a Fiery Pit where you are consumed by flames and the air reeks of brimstone (Sulfur) has nothing at all to do with the Bible?    That the whole common perception of what Hell is based on nothing more then a Fiction Writers account of the Fiery Pits of the 9 levels of hell in 1320 AD?    Dantes Devine Comedies?    Before Dante wrote his series of books on what hell is There was no biblically approved description of what hell would be like and what the punishments would be?    Did you know that there are really 8 Deadly Sins? That the list was changed 200+ years after it was written?     That the original 8 are nothing like the Official 7? That the sins are not in the bible At all    The Original 8 were written by a Christian monk from Constantinople who traveled to Egypt to live alone in a cave and wrote up his list of thoughts that most tormented him in 375 AD? That the list was to be followed by Monks ONLY? That no one paid him any heed until over 200 years later?    The actual, original list of Thoughts consisted of:  Pride  Gluttony  Lust  Sloth  Greed  Anger  Vain Glory  Sadness    Yeah Sadness So all of us diagnosed with Depression are really just being lead astray by the devil Yeah    The idea that Lust is bad wasnt even considered until the 4th Century Bishop Epithanious decided to denounce the Gnostic Cult known as Carpocrations (Pronounced Car-Po-Crate-shions) in 325 ad? They used ALL 60+ books of the Christian Bible as their guide and it is said in the Book of Mary that Jesus said that there is no such thing as sin     The Bishop wanted to gain a foothold of power in the area so he described the Gnostic Cult as starting their worship by disrobing and that the worship ended with a sex act between priest and priestess and ordered that all Gnostic books be burned and that the cult be banned?     It wasnt until 200+ years later, after the fall of the Roman Empire, when the dark ages took hold in 590 AD and the Official church wanted iron fisted control over Official Christianity that the list was written by the Reformer Pope Gregory The Great?     (Who also decided that Holy Men could not marry Not because Chastity was good but because he didnt want a priests family to be able to inherit Church Property and to consolidate the Churchs base of power? Before it was decided that priests couldnt merry They had wives and kids and could have sex)    Though found no where in the bible This guy wrote them up and published them and they became part of the Christian Doctrine.     The Official 7 Sins written by the Reformer Pope Gregory The Great:  Lust  Envy  Gluttony   Sloth   Greed   Anger   Pride    Did you also know that just THINKING about these sins means that you have actually committed the act? And that by committing the act, you are sentenced to hell?     Do you even know what the Seven Heavenly Virtues are? What they stand for?  Chastity  Liberality  Kindness  Patience  Humility  Abstinence  Diligence    Does ANYONE that believes this stuff actually do their research and understand their own deluded belief structure?    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *|`|yMqWvG8naa	/facepalm    Your bible is full of scientific inacuracies.  Even if "God" wanted to slowly reveal science to us, don't you think he would have gotten some things right back then?    It's not like people have become any more able to understand complex ideas since the bible was written, so why treat us like we are?      Why tell people that it happened like it did in Genesis when it was evolution?  Why tell people that bats are birds when they're not?  Why tell people that the earth is flat when it's not?  Why tell people that the earth doesn't move when it does? Why tell us that the moon creates light when it doesn't?    It's not like evolution is a particularly complex idea.  You could explain it to a three year old and they'd basically get it, so why claim that it didn't happen, only to later reveal that it's the truth?

U24VtSlZaa	"forgiveness" and "punishment" are each independent of the other.  A person can end up with both, either, or neither.  God's forgiveness does not necessarily carry over into our criminal justice system.    1.  What is or should be God's role?    God is God, only God can decide what God's role is or should be.   I have observed that God as a rule does not regularly intervene in the criminal courts.  2.  How should we communicate God's message in such a situation?   God decided not to intervene in the drowning, why would she expect him to save her life?  3.  Should the girl have been put to death?  Having been found guilty and sentenced by a jury of her peers in a jurisdiction where capital punishment is legal, yes.|`|HsbDGCY6aa	where did this story come from?|`|K91tfiLCaa	they need to do way instain mother> who kill thier babbys. becuse these babby cant frigth back?|`|DHCwLBuwaa	It doesn't matter whether or not he should have stopped her execution.

GrKiEDb1aa	GONG.  Wrong answer. Guess where Abram's decedents were slaves for 400 years....EGYPT.  Your biblical ignorance is glaring.  Do you ENJOY looking foolish?  Great job of it.     Blacks were not slaves in America for 400 years.  The 13th Amendment officially ended slavery in the U.S. in 1865.  Do the math...1865 - 400 years means slavery would have had to start in 1400 on this continent. Actually, the first slaves were brought to this continent around 1620.   Your ignorance of American history is worse than your biblical ignorance.  And not ALL Americans had slaves.  YOU'RE tripping on some real bad illicit drugs 'homie'.    Thanks again for the big laugh and for making yourself look like a complete jackass.  You're always good for a big guffaw!

I wonder what the punishment will be...or has it occurred and will continue.    I read the girl below me. And I just found out Jews were really slaves in Egypt for 400 years. And I'm pretty sure that's what the bible was talking about. Since the Jews are very important in the bible. And Israel (were most jews are) is the land of God    If you continue reading it will talk about Egypt. So this is definitely the Jewish ensaved in the Egypt nation.|`|MyV9qm99aa	Training day..    Why are you bringing up African (american?-there was no Americas mentioned.But slavery  meant something different.

But southerners in the 1800s used slavery as an act, because it says it in the bible. Slavery is meant by friendship and a master is not meant to treat his slave as a pile of crud.

The laws about slavery are to PROTECT the "slaves" from oppression. They had no protection whatsoever before the advent of Revelation at Mt. Sinai.    Why aren't there any laws in the Bible about running red lights? How about smoking restrictions in public places. We have those laws on the books now because those things are HAPPENING in the world as we know it!    The laws found in the Hebrew Bible are MAXIMUM penalties and were seldom if ever used. However, the protections found in the Bible were enforced for everyone -- from the slave to the king. No one had special privileges, and EVERYONE was held ACCOUNTABLE for his own actions!         Most of the so-called slaves in the Bible were indentured servants, NOT slaves. There is a verse in the Bible that says people will serve for 6 years and on the 7th year, they would be freed.      Just because the Bible does mention slavery, doesn't automatically mean that it is saying it's okay. History books mention slavery. Does this mean ALL history books are endorsing it? Of course not.|`|0jmVA50Jaa	Slaves was sad no matter where.   What you read in the Holy Bible relates to the Slavery of the Choosen People-   The Jewish People.    But it compares to Slaves all over the world.   China had slaves, Rome treated their Slaves brutally.   It was not only the Whites that owned Slaves.   Why do you always tell a story and then at the ending point that finger at the White?       We got your message, but I suggest you go back and read the wonderful Holy Bible again.|`|NsFaPI9waa	God understands that people buy other people and, quite obviously, is comfortable with the concept.    If God were to exist, and if he were playing any role whatsoever on our planet, he would eliminate this connection between himself and slavery. There is no way that a loving God would allow himself to be perceived as condoning and encouraging slavery like this.     What does your common sense now tell you about a Bible that supports slavery in both the Old and the New Testaments? Given the fact that the Bible clearly condones slavery, your common sense should be telling you that God is imaginary.|`|2liwk8yKaa	Well seeing that slavery was an accepted thing not only in the US but elsewhere a couple of hundred years ago it could mean any Nation.|`|WYo59zLOaa	Nope! I bet Jesus had slaves too.|`|KifasiMraa	Read a bit more. Those verses are talking about the Jewish slavery in Egypt, where they were slaves for hundreds of years. But slavery was very prominent in the ancient world. Just because it made you think about slavery in America doesn't mean that's what the writer intended. That's the thing about bible verses, they're just vague enough that anyone can read them and apply them to multiple situations. It doesn't mean that writer was referencing the exact thing you're thinking about.|`|qvycijbOaa	Hmmm, around the time the old testament was written and possibly even the new one, it was seen as acceptable to own or be a slave to another man. I'm sure Jesus mentions something about how to treat 'your slaves' but I'm not too sure so don't quote me on it bredrin.    Edit:  Lol Rob T you're a hater, we all know slavery continued WAY after it was "abolished" you really think the government could back there sanctions to ban slavery? What would they do in the 18th century? Kill a white man because he owns a slave? Perhaps throw him in jail? The abolishment of slavery wasn't backed with authority for a long time.

The Scriptures foretell events that would take place during the time of the conclusion of the system of things. (Matthew 24:3) The Bible also speaks of changes in the attitudes and actions of people living in the last days.2 Timothy 3:1.    World events combined with the behavior and traits of people prove that we are living in the last days and that Gods Kingdom will soon bring everlasting blessings to those who love God. We begin by examining three features that Jesus said would mark the last days.    A Beginning of Pangs of Distress    Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, said Jesus, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another. He added: All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress. (Matthew 24:7, 8) Let us examine these things individually.    Vast numbers of people were slain in wars and ethnic disputes during the past century. Three times as many people fell victim to war in [the 20th] century as in all the wars from the first century AD to 1899, states a scholarly report from the Worldwatch Institute. In his book HumanityA Moral History of the Twentieth Century, Jonathan Glover writes: An estimate for the period from 1900 until 1989 is that war killed 86 million people. . . . Death in twentieth-century war has been on a scale which is hard to grasp. Any averaging out of the numbers of deaths is artificial, since about two-thirds (58 million) were killed in the two world wars. But, if these deaths had been spread evenly over the period, war would have killed around 2,500 people every day, that is over 100 people an hour, round the clock, for ninety years. Can you imagine the grief and pain this must have caused the millions of relatives and friends of those who lost their lives?    Despite the fact that the world produces plenty of food, the features characterizing the last days include food shortages. Researchers say that over the past 30 years, food production has outpaced population increase. Nevertheless, food shortages prevail in large areas of the world because many people do not have sufficient land to grow food or enough money to buy food. In developing countries, some 1.2 billion people subsist on a dollar (U.S.) a day or less. Of these, about 780 million suffer chronic hunger. According to the World Health Organization, annually malnutrition plays a major role in the deaths of over five million children.    What can be said about the foretold earthquakes? According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the number of earthquakes powerful enough to destroy buildings has averaged 17 a year since 1990 alone. On average, earthquakes strong enough to cause almost total destruction of buildings have occurred once each year. Earthquakes have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives in the last 100 years, states another source. One reason for this is that since 1914 many large population centers have developed in earthquake zones.    Other Significant Developments    There will be . . . in one place after another pestilences, said Jesus. (Luke 21:11) Medical science today is more advanced than ever before. Still, both old and new diseases continue to ravage mankind. A U.S. National Intelligence Council document states: Twenty well-known diseasesincluding tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and cholerahave reemerged or spread geographically since 1973, often in more virulent and drug-resistant forms. At least 30 previously unknown disease agents have been identified since 1973, including HIV, Ebola, hepatitis C, and Nipah virus, for which no cures are available. According to a Red Cross report of June 28, 2000, during the preceding year, the number of people who died from infectious diseases was about 160 times greater than the number who died in natural disasters.    The increasing of lawlessness is another noteworthy feature of the last days. (Matthew 24:12) In most places around the earth today, people do not leave their homes unlocked or feel safe on the street at night. And what about the pollution of the air, the water, and the land that we see taking place, often because of illegal practices? This too is in fulfillment of what the Bible foretold. The book of Revelation speaks of Gods appointed time to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.Revelation 11:18.    What the People of the Last Days Are Like    Please open your Bible to 2 Timothy 3:1-5 and read it. The apostle Paul writes: In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. He then goes on to list 20 personality traits that would characterize ungodly people. Have you observed some of these characteristics in those living in your community? Consider what has been said in recent times about the people of today.    Lovers of themselves. (2 Timothy 3:2) [People are] insistent on doing their own thing as never before.

Only the willfully blind cannot see we are practically right up to the start of the Great Tribulation.    http://www.watchtower.org/e/20060915/art...|`|Of0H9i4Vaa	Yes, we are part of the last Generation for the Bible says, Gods Kingdom Comes to Power in the Midst of Its Enemies...The Gentile times have ended.. Self rule has failed...we've tried Satan's way .    FOR thousands of years men of faith have lived in eager expectation of the day when Gods kingdom would begin its rule. They have felt keenly the need for God to take a direct hand in earths affairs. Does this mean that God has not been King during the centuries past? No, for Jehovah has always been the Supreme Ruler of the universe. (Jeremiah 10:10) But here at the earth his rulership has been challenged. And, as we have already seen, for sound reasons and with a loving purpose in view, God has allowed human governments under the influence of Satan to rule for a fixed period of time.     Jehovah promised, however, that at the end of that time he would take direct action against all rebels and opposers of his rule. And he would bring the earth and its inhabitants completely under his rule again. How? By the Kingdom, a new heavenly government under his Son Christ Jesus. So the coming of that kingdom to power means that great changes are near at hand. It means that Jehovah God has given to his Son rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him.Daniel 7:13, 14.     That event has already taken place in heaven. Kingdom authority has already been given to Jehovahs Son. Does that sound strange to you? It might, especially in view of the terrible conditions afflicting mankind. But, really, it is because of these very conditions that we can be certain that this is true.|`|G9VBTg47aa	http://video.google.co.uk/videosearch?q=... Reality check.

(Matthew 24:7; Revelation 6:4) Writer Ernest Hemingway called World War?I the most colossal, murderous, mismanaged butchery that has ever taken place on earth. According to the book The World in the Crucible1914-1919, this was a new scope of war, the first total war in the experience of mankind. Its duration, intensity, and scale exceeded anything previously known or generally expected. Then came World War?II, which proved much more destructive than World War?I. The twentieth century, says professor of history Hugh Thomas, has been dominated by the machine gun, the tank, the B-52, the nuclear bomb and, finally, the missile. It has been marked by wars more bloody and destructive than those of any other age. True, much was said about disarmament after the Cold War ended. Still, one report estimates that after proposed reductions some 10,000 to 20,000 nuclear warheads will remainmore than 900 times the firepower used during World War?II.  There will be food shortages. (Matthew 24:7; Revelation 6:5, 6,?8) Since 1914 there have been at least 20 major famines. Afflicted areas include Bangladesh, Burundi, Cambodia, China, Ethiopia, Greece, India, Nigeria, Russia, Rwanda, Somalia, and Sudan. But famine is not always caused by a lack of food. The worlds food supply over recent decades has grown faster than its population, concluded a group of agricultural scientists and economists. But because at least 800 million people remain in deep poverty, .?.?. they are unable to purchase enough of the abundance to lift them out of chronic malnutrition. Political meddling is involved in other cases. Dr.?Abdelgalil Elmekki of the University of Toronto cites two examples in which thousands starved while their countries were exporting massive amounts of food. The governments seemed far more concerned with raising foreign currency to finance their wars than with feeding their citizens. Dr.?Elmekkis conclusion? Famine is often a matter of distribution and government policy.  Pestilences. (Luke 21:11; Revelation 6:8) The Spanish influenza of 1918-19 claimed at least 21 million lives. The world had never in history been ravaged by a killer that slew so many human beings so quickly, writes A.?A.?Hoehling in The Great Epidemic. Today, pestilences rage on. Each year, cancer kills five million people, diarrheal diseases claim the lives of more than three million infants and children, and tuberculosis slays three million. Respiratory infections, mainly pneumonia, annually kill 3.5 million youngsters under five years of age. And a staggering 2.5 billionhalf the worlds populationsuffer from sicknesses that stem from insufficient or contaminated water and poor sanitation. AIDS looms as a further reminder that man, despite his significant medical accomplishments, is incapable of eradicating pestilences.  Disobedient to parents. (2?Timothy 3:2) Present-day parents, teachers, and others have firsthand evidence that many children are disrespectful and disobedient. Some of these youngsters are either reacting to or imitating their parents misbehavior. Increasing numbers of children are losing faith inand rebelling againstschool, the law, religion, and their parents. As a trend, says one veteran schoolteacher, they seem to have very little respect for anything.   Having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power. (2?Timothy 3:5) The Bible has the power to change lives for the better. (Ephesians 4:22-24) Yet, many today use their religion as a screen behind which they carry on unrighteous activities that displease God. Lying, stealing, and sexual misconduct are often condoned by religious leaders. Many religions preach love but support warfare.   Ruining the earth. (Revelation 11:18) More than 1,600 scientists, including 104 Nobel laureates, from around the world endorsed a warning, issued by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), that stated: Human beings and the natural world are on a collision course. .?.?. No more than a few decades remain before the chance to avert the threats will be lost. The report said that mans life-threatening practices may so alter the world that it will be unable to sustain life in the manner that we know.   This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth. (Matthew 24:14) Jesus foretold that the good news of the Kingdom would be preached earth wide, for a witness to all the nations. With divine help and blessing, millions of Jehovahs Witnesses are devoting billions of hours to this preaching and disciple-making work. (Matthew 28:19,?20) Yes, the Witnesses realize that they would be bloodguilty if they did not declare the good news. (Ezekiel 3:18,?19) But they are delighted that each year thousands gratefully respond to the Kingdom message and take their stand as true Christians, that is, as Witnesses of Jehovah. It is an inestimable privilege|`|q9C46Wuqaa	According to the Bible the big signs of Judgment days have not even arrived yet.|`|dMeVhu0iaa	Wake up and be a realistic thinker, snap out of it, you are wasting your life on this nonsense.

I'm not american so maybe I'm missing something, but I find it totally ridiculous to avoid dating someone that could make you happy just because of skin or religon or anything else.    I have american friends black and white and I find some of their attitudes towards this kind of thing shameful.     Those black women who complain about white women stealing "their" men ought to be ashamed of themselves.

AA10842205	Depends on how long you have been together.
AA11440601	Yes.    + Purgatory +     The concept of purgation is hinted at in the Bible. Here are a few of places:    "But if someone's work is burned up, that one will suffer loss; the person will be saved, but only as through fire." (1 Cor 3:15)    "So that the genuineness of your faith, more precious than gold that is perishable even though tested by fire, may prove to be for praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ." (1 Pet 1:7)    But the souls of the just are in the hand of God, and no torment shall touch them. They seemed, in the view of the foolish, to be dead; and their passing away was thought an affliction and their going forth from us, utter destruction. But they are in peace. For if before men, indeed, they be punished, yet is their hope full of immortality; Chastised a little, they shall be greatly blessed, because God tried them and found them worthy of himself. As gold in the furnace, he proved them, and as sacrificial offerings he took them to himself. (Wisdom 3:1-6)    Are you perfect now? Most people would say no.    Will you be perfect in heaven? Most people believe yes.    Purgatory (or purgation) is the process of God's love changing our imperfect selves into perfect beings.     Depending on the amount of change needed by different people, this can be an easy or slightly harder process.     Everyone in purgatory is on his or her way to heaven.     I do not think Mother Teresa of Calcutta had a very hard time of it.    For more information see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 1030: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...      + Sources of Doctrine +     The Catholic Church does not only use Holy Scripture for the basis of doctrine. The early Catholic church existed before and during the time that the New Testament was written (by Catholics).    Catholics also believe that the Holy Spirit was guiding the early church (and is guiding the church today) to make the correct choices about things like  - The Holy Trinity (which is also only hinted at in the Bible)  - Going to church on Sunday instead of Saturday (which is actually directly against one of the ten commandments)  - Which books to include in the New Testament?  - How do our imperfect selves on earth get to be perfect in heaven?    This second source of doctrine is called Apostolic Tradition.    For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 1030: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...    + With love in Christ.|`|E71jweytaa	you can, it is considered a truth of the church, but tot he best of my knowledge you wont be excommunicated for it or anything|`|3r252UIRaa	I'm not Catholic, but I know alot about Catholicism, so I'll answer.    You can attend, but if you wanted to actually become a Catholic, you would HAVE to believe Purgatory, because it's one of the dogmas of Catholicism. In addition, if you wanted to become a Catholic, you would have to take a year long course. It's hard to become one.    Edit: If you think Purgatory is unbiblical, then you're going to think all their other doctrines are unbiblical too. They consider tradition more important than the Bible.|`|um9W8Dy8aa	Purgatory is logical and consistent with biblical holiness  Check out the Catechism of the Catholic Church|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	People attend church all the time, regardless of the denomination, who don't believe what it teaches.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	This is the answer you've been waiting for.    John Henry Newman was a great Bible scholar and student of Church History. He started out an opponent of Catholicism and Purgatory was one of his targets....    Sermon 25. The Intermediate State  http://www.newmanreader.org/works/paroch...    http://www.newmanreader.org/works/develo...    Yes, he converted to Catholicism and it was his research that did it.     Here is an exhaustive article on Purgatory from the Catholic Encyclopedia  http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12575a.h...    There is great mercy in the doctrine of Purgatory. IF one went to Hell that was not fit yet for Heaven, who would make it ? The hideous sinner on his deathbed takes Purgatory as a palliative against despair.|`|yQNit56Qaa	1) Can you attend a Catholic church and not believe in Purgatory?    Yes.  Believe it or not, as people are walking into church there is not a person standing at a security station asking each person, "Do you swear that you believe in Purgatory?"  Horribly lax of them, I know, but they let non-Purgatory believers in without even attempting to stem the tide.      2) Through personal experience of reading the Bible, I've found that the doctrine of Purgatory to be very unbiblical.     I'm surprised.  I would think that this one passage alone identifies something similar to Purgatory must exist (v 18-forward)  http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.p...    Here we have a "place" in which the dead are conscious and have not yet obtained salvation but are still *able* to obtain salvation.  Then there's the whole "baptism for the dead" thing.  Although I'm not Roman Catholic, clearly salvation is not *necessarily* determined at the moment of death, and clearly the efforts of the living *do* have an effect on the salvation of the dead (v 29)  http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.p...      However, I believe that when you *become* a Roman Catholic, you are expected to avow that you believe in all of the doctrines taught by the church, which would include Purgatory.  SO, if you have some sound reason for rejecting that doctrine, you cannot become Roman Catholic without giving up your integrity.    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews. com|`|239f0ef98b65c819dacad5a9908c975aaa	You can attend. But it is a belief of the Church and to be a Catholic in full communion with the Catholic Church you must believe it.    You obviously have not been reading it correctly, because, contrary to Protestant belief, there is plenty of scripture to support the belief of purgatory.|`|4FuQSq69aa	They don't ask you at the door what your beliefs are.  I am agnostic and I have been too church.|`|QlB3VXWraa	Catholic doctrine is full of superstition. They believe in demonic possession & exorcisms. They believe that evil people can put curses on you and praying to certain saints might lift curses. They believe that the communion ceremony is not merely a commoration of the Last Supper. Catholics believe the wafer is actually, physically God.    Catholic doctrine is a moving target. A couple years ago they did away with "Limbo" which had been taught for hundreds of years. They accept evolution now but this is the church that arrested Gallileo for studying astronomy. They used to persecute people for translating the bible. The current pope just reinstated some bishops that the former pope excommunicated. The Catholic church is all over the map. And don't get me started on the thousands of child sexual abuse cases committed by their own priests. As an ex-Catholic I know a few things about the church and I'd recommend leaving it alone.    As for Purgatory, it implies that Jesus didn't really did for your sins. Some of them still need to be punished.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	You can visit the Catholic Church but you cannot be Catholic. All Catholics must believe in Purgatory. Your attitude should not be that you are right and the Church is wrong. Purgatory is real and there is biblical basis for it.    Decree (Council of Trent) concerning Purgatory in 1564:    Since the Catholic Church, instructed by the Holy Ghost, has, following the sacred writings and the ancient tradition of the Fathers, taught in sacred councils and very recently in this ecumenical council that there is a purgatory, and that the souls there detained are aided by the suffrages of the faithful and chiefly by the acceptable sacrifice of the altar, the holy council commands the bishops that they strive diligently to the end that the sound doctrine of purgatory, transmitted by the Fathers and sacred councils, be believed and maintained by the faithful of Christ, and be everywhere taught and preached.    2 Maccabees is the most direct support for Purgatory, but since the Protestant reformers deemed that book uninspired, it is not in your Bible. But it was in the Bible at the time of Christ. But there are other biblical references for it.     What most non-Catholics have a problem with is how the Church understands Scripture. Since the Church came before the Bible and even before the New Testament was written, the way in which the Church approaches and interprets Scripture is much different than non-Catholics.     The Church doesn't read the Bible and then define truth. Truth has always been and was handed to us by the Apostles. That Truth can be supported by Scripture always, but it didn't start in Scripture, it started with Christ.     So if a Catholic doesn't agree with a Church teaching, the way to approach it is to ask God to enlighten us. Pray for understanding, realizing that you most likely do not know better than 2000 years of teaching, studying, and discussion. Understand also, that the Church is led by the Holy Spirit. Just as the Holy Spirit kept the authors of the Bible from erring, so he keeps the Church from erring in matters of faith and morals. We know, for instance, that the early Christians believed in Purgatory and held masses for the dead...this was before the Bible was cannonized. Purgaotry was believed in by the early Christians but it was necessary to define it as a doctrine in 1564 because it came into question.     The things the Catholic Church believes, the dogma, has always been and is unchanged. Nothing new has ever been introduced, only clarified and defined.     http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2005/05...  http://purgatoryisreal.blogspot.com/  http://www.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-...  http://www.scripturecatholic.com/purgato...|`|h5q89E3Haa	PURGATORY:    1Peter 3:  18    For Christ also suffered 5 for sins once, the righteous for the sake of the unrighteous, that he might lead you to God. Put to death in the flesh, he was brought to life in the spirit.  19    In it he also went to preach to the spirits in prison,    The Prison is Purgatory.    1Peter 4:6    For this is why the gospel was preached even to the dead that, though condemned in the flesh in human estimation, they might live in the spirit in the estimation of God.    Why Preach to the Dead if they are not in a place to hear it? That place is Purgatory.    Matthew 12:32    And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.    If there was not Purgatory why would you need forgiveness in "the age to come"?    Purgatory is a very real and biblical place.    Everything about the Catholic Church is biblical. You must believe all she offers or none.     "No one can serve 2 masters" ---Jesus    Peace be with you.|`|MMImKRAgaa	if you cant believe the doctrine why would you attend, though I myself believe there is truth in each if you sift it through, and not all truth in any|`|AA11796124	A State After Death of Suffering and Forgiveness  Matt. 5:26,18:34; Luke 12:58-59  Jesus teaches us, Come to terms with your opponent or you will be handed over to the judge and thrown into prison. You will not get out until you have paid the last penny. The word opponent (antidiko) is likely a reference to the devil (see the same word for devil in 1 Pet. 5:8) who is an accuser against man (c.f. Job 1.6-12; Zech. 3.1; Rev. 12.10), and God is the judge. If we have not adequately dealt with satan and sin in this life, we will be held in a temporary state called a prison, and we wont get out until we have satisfied our entire debt to God. This prison is purgatory where we will not get out until the last penny is paid.    Matt. 5:48 - Jesus says, "be perfect, even as your heavenly Father is perfect." We are only made perfect through purification, and in Catholic teaching, this purification, if not completed on earth, is continued in a transitional state we call purgatory.     Matt. 12:32  Jesus says, And anyone who says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but no one who speaks against the Holy Spirit will be forgiven either in this world or in the next. Jesus thus clearly provides that there is forgiveness after death. The phrase in the next (from the Greek en to mellonti) generally refers to the afterlife (see, for example, Mark 10.30; Luke 18.30; 20.34-35; Eph. 1.21 for similar language). Forgiveness is not necessary in heaven, and there is no forgiveness in hell. This proves that there is another state after death, and the Church for 2,000 years has called this state purgatory.     Luke 12:47-48 - when the Master comes (at the end of time), some will receive light or heavy beatings but will live. This state is not heaven or hell, because in heaven there are no beatings, and in hell we will no longer live with the Master.     Luke 16:19-31 - in this story, we see that the dead rich man is suffering but still feels compassion for his brothers and wants to warn them of his place of suffering. But there is no suffering in heaven or compassion in hell because compassion is a grace from God and those in hell are deprived from God's graces for all eternity. So where is the rich man? He is in purgatory.     1 Cor. 15:29-30 - Paul mentions people being baptized on behalf of the dead, in the context of atoning for their sins (people are baptized on the deads behalf so the dead can be raised). These people cannot be in heaven because they are still with sin, but they also cannot be in hell because their sins can no longer be atoned for. They are in purgatory. These verses directly correspond to 2 Macc. 12:44-45 which also shows specific prayers for the dead, so that they may be forgiven of their sin.     Phil. 2:10 - every knee bends to Jesus, in heaven, on earth, and "under the earth" which is the realm of the righteous dead, or purgatory.     2 Tim. 1:16-18 - Onesiphorus is dead but Paul asks for mercy on him on that day. Pauls use of that day demonstrates its eschatological usage (see, for example, Rom. 2.5,16; 1 Cor. 1.8; 3.13; 5.5; 2 Cor. 1.14; Phil. 1.6,10; 2.16; 1 Thess. 5.2,4,5,8; 2 Thess. 2.2,3; 2 Tim. 4.8). Of course, there is no need for mercy in heaven, and there is no mercy given in hell. Where is Onesiphorus? He is in purgatory.     Heb. 12:14 - without holiness no one will see the Lord. We need final sanctification to attain true holiness before God, and this process occurs during our lives and, if not completed during our lives, in the transitional state of purgatory.     Heb. 12:23 - the spirits of just men who died in godliness are "made" perfect. They do not necessarily arrive perfect. They are made perfect after their death. But those in heaven are already perfect, and those in hell can no longer be made perfect. These spirits are in purgatory.     1 Peter 3:19; 4:6 - Jesus preached to the spirits in the "prison." These are the righteous souls being purified for the beatific vision.     Rev. 21:4 - God shall wipe away their tears, and there will be no mourning or pain, but only after the coming of the new heaven and the passing away of the current heaven and earth. Note the elimination of tears and pain only occurs at the end of time. But there is no morning or pain in heaven, and God will not wipe away their tears in hell. These are the souls experiencing purgatory.     Rev. 21:27 - nothing unclean shall enter heaven. The word unclean comes from the Greek word koinon which refers to a spiritual corruption. Even the propensity to sin is spiritually corrupt, or considered unclean, and must be purified before entering heaven. It is amazing how many Protestants do not want to believe in purgatory. Purgatory exists because of the mercy of God. If there were no purgatory, this would also likely mean no salvation for most people. God is merciful indeed.     Luke 23:43  many Protestants argue that, because Jesus sent the good thief right to heaven, there can be no purg|`|zefFTf8Aaa	yes, anyone can go.  you just can not receive the Eucharist.  read this verse.  2Macc 12:44-46

God Bless|`|rgovWVP4aa	i hav e not heard of her but i have heard of president monson of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints who is a true prophet  and i kn ow that god uses people in different areas to warn and guide people on earth , each prophet has a different calling to do on earth ie moses lead the children of israel out of egypt, john the baptist was here solely to baptise jesus christ yes he did other things but he was the only one with true authority to baptise jesus christ, jesus christ not only preached and performed miracles but has made an atonement with god enabling us all to live with god again he has also overcome the bands of death making it possible for all mankind to overcome death .Joseph smith the first true prophet of this final dispensation ,and the first president of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints restored the gospel on earth and bought forth the book of mormon , and president monson speaks of unity and love in the family and its welfare , all prophets are called of god as god knows our hearts strength and weakness's and will guide us all, and if chooses someone like vassula to help in gods work then it is up to god to chose , but we must pray to make sure that person chosen is chosen of god , and not the devil who will use people to try and lead us away from the truth by mixing truth with lies to confuse us and so there for leading us by false deception away from the truth and god and down into the pits of hell where he dwells in misserey|`|e1c82fd56e9a3f4047bc62eb3da287d2aa	I think prophets are an everyday occurrence in a REAL church that is active in Christ|`|KmnbjZIdaa	I have a copy of her book, but I have not really read it yet.

So, in short, I'd say NASA.|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	It has been my experience that science usually comes around, in time, to PROVING what was wrtten in the Bible, thousands of years ago.    Right now, science is offering a new theory, the Big Bang theory of creation. They will come back around to the truth, in time.    Think about it . . . from the universe right down to a single living cell, everything is in perfect balance and order. A big explosion does not create such perfect order, it creates chaos. One does not use dynamite to creat ea home but to destroy it    Only God can create such order, so now science wants to  partially admit this talking about divine intervention in  evolution . . . a new term  meaning guided selection during intervention.

Would you use it to understand how to set up a mail merge in Microsoft Word?  So, don't use it as a cosmology text book either, that would be equally stupid.|`|pxwqB9Zyaa	The bible is NOT a science book.  It is about morals and belief and theology and ethics and history.      The reason people get confused, and there is a culture war, is that some people think and believe that it is "True" with a capital "T" because it was literally written by God.    Did God write in Engish for you and in ancient Hebrew for the early Jews?  All written evidence shows that the Old Testement was written roughly 3000 yrs ago based on spoken stories that went back maybe 4 or 5,000 yr.  The New Testement was not collected into a "Bible" until about 350 AD by the Christian Bishops at the instrution of the Roman Emperor who had made Christianity the official Roman State Religion.    It makes no sense to try to compare scientific theory and ideas with religious ideas.  They do not match in any way.|`|kb2q03jvaa	both, God gave man the ability to discover how He conducted his work. they just think that since they found out that He didn't do it. i don't understand that...

You really have had some rough times. I don't necessarily believe in bad luck or good luck. I do believe that God gives us trials. He gives them to us to see how we'll react to them and if we can grow and develop with them. Basically that which doesn't break us makes us stronger, more or less.        I can't say if your cycle of bad fortune/trials will end soon. But you can always go to God in prayer and pray for him to help you lift the load and that you're having a hard time handling it. That's about the only advice I can give. Not sure if it will help or not, but it's better than nothing.|`|Tq7rABv5aa	maybe you should try praying.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	ok, but first you have to go do something nice for a stranger, then the curse will be lifted.|`|IDDBdU6saa	It's not a curse, it's a cross you'll have to carry.|`|7cLYgf2raa	You should look first at your words. Jesus said that out of the negative deposit in a man's heart, negative things come to pass, and out of the good deposit in a mna's heart, good things come to pass, for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.      Second check if you have any bitterness or strife or unforgiveness. Thes are things that bring the curse full bore. The bible says that the curse causeless shall not come.That eliminates luck. Luck is never in the believers vocabulary. God is not mocked, for whatsoever any man sows, that is what he reaps.     So, do some soul searching and find the root of your problem. The word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intentoins of the heart. That is an excellent place to start, the written word.|`|ChmwmQfWaa	Give ur life to Jesus and  he'd take care of the rest. He says in Jeremiah 29:11 dat "d thoughts i hav toward u are thoughts of good and not of evil to give u an expected end". Ur future and life would be secure with him.    U can start by repenting of ur sins by asking for forgiveness from God and asking him to come into ur life and cleanse u of ur sins i.e. be born again(Isaiah 1:18). Talk to him in prayer. He's ur heavenly Father and is willing to listen to u. If u'd like to give ur life to him and be born again, pls say this prayer:  Lord Jesus Christ,  I'm sorry for d things I've done wrong in my life. I ask for ur forgiveness and now turn from everything which I know is wrong. Thank u for dying on d cross for me to set me free from my sins. Pls come into my life and fill me with ur Holy Spirit and be with me forever.  Thank u Lord Jesus,  Amen  How do u feel now?  Spend time reading the word of God and thereby u can build a personal relationship with God. Trust me ur life would change drastically. U can email me on :lola_taurus4lf@yahoo.co.uk if u'd like to know more, and u cud also let me know how things go for u from henceforth  God Bless|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	There is no such thing as a curse.

sGojEWOxaa	I think that you may misunderstand what is being said.  First of all, what we are saying is that "asking Jesus to come into my heart" is not biblical.  Second, I understand the scripture that this little "sinners prayer" is being taken from it is found here:<br>  Romans 10:8-10 (King James Version)<br>  <br>   8But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; <br>  <br>   9That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. <br>  <br>   10For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.<br>  <br>  And I believe that this is part of our salvation, but it does not end there.<br>  Once you "asked Jesus to come into your heart" you are not automatically saved.  There is more to "being saved" than that.<br>  You must take the WHOLE word of God, not just one or two scriptures.<br>  <br>  It says in the Word of God that there were some that had ONLY believed and this is what they were told:<br>  Acts 19:1-3 (King James Version)<br>  <br>  Acts 19<br>   1And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples, <br>  <br>   2He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. <br>  <br>   3And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.<br>  <br>  The bible does not say that these people were bad, but it does say that there was more that needed to happen once that had believed.<br>  When they heard about what else they needed to do, they did it..<br>  <br>   4Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. <br>  <br>   5When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. <br>  <br>   6And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.<br>  <br>  All that we are saying is that there is more, and I am not saying that I am perfect, nor am I saying that "I have arrived", I'm saying there is more, there are greater things... don't limit God.  I am trying myself not to limit Him, I know that I will never learn everything that there is to learn about Him.  I want to read His word from start to finish over and over again, because there is always something new, something I didn't see before.  I just want to seek out my own soul's salvation with fear and trembling, just as the Word of God tells us to.<br>  Philippians 2:12<br>  Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.<br>  <br>  I want to find that straight and narrow path, the one that FEW find...<br>  Matthew 7:14<br>  Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.|`|A01w1dHqaa	We give him our fears and any other illusions...he takes them and shows us truth.<br>  <br>  I don't spend much time reading other people's interpretations.

The key fact that people neglect is that a Dominant only has as much control as the submissive gives to them.  Absolute trust is required, because the submissive is trusting their Dominant enough to place their safety in the Dom's hands.  They need to trust enough that the gift they've given won't be abused.    I submit to my Dominant happily, and I trust him to not take advantage of that, to not hurt me, and to keep me safe.  In return he is loving, supportive and respectful of me, just as I am to him.  In our relationship, it works perfectly, and we're both happy with this arrangement.

It is not the flavor of the month..there are levels of understanding that take most people active in the community their whole lives to get...     there is a big misconception that it is about sex and pain.

eO2rnf7yaa	Jesus was fully human and fully divine. People did not know that at first (sadly, a lot of people still don't know that).  In the quote to which you refer,  Jesus was making it clear to people that Jesus was acting in accordance with the Will of God.   It was necessary for Him to refer to His Father,  because most people did not yet know that Jesus is God.  The quote you cited can also be taken to mean that Jesus was acting according to the Will that existed before the incarnation of Jesus Christ.  The incarnation occurred in time and space, so yes there was a "time before" His incarnation.|`|pw4Cb45Kaa	"Him that sent me" is God.  God sent Jesus to us to make a new covenant with everyone that believed; and through Jesus only can one come to be with God.

So if they all rose Jesus from the dead (he only rose from the dead once) then they all must be the same thing.|`|KhJwOurLaa	Yes. He did say they are of one purpose, According to the Gospel of John. He also asked why we call him good when only the Father is good.|`|IDDBdU6saa	Of course He's God.  I guess you never read the line- "I am in the Father and the Father is in Me"|`|lh8Tn02Naa	Well, we're not going to get very far if we try and establish the facts using the Fourth Gospel, are we?  Historical reliability pretty well zilch.    Let's try something more authentic.  Mark 10:18, in response to the man usually referred to as the Rich Young Ruler, records Jesus as saying     Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.    This is likely to be a true saying, because it obviously embarrassed Matthew, who altered it to "Why do you ask me about what is good?".  In other words, Matthew is wanting to deflect attention away from what in Mark is a clear denial that Jesus possesses an essential divine attribute.    Truth is that while there is a greater emphasis on Jesus' divinity in Matthew and Luke than in Mark, whose Gospel is earlier and much more historically reliable, it's only in John that we get an unmistakable claim to "be God":    Jesus said to them, Very truly, I tell you, before Abraham was, I am.    This as I say cannot be trusted as a statement that Jesus will actually have made.  But even in John's Gospel, there are other verses, including the one you quote, where Jesus distinguishes himself from God.      So basically you're correct.|`|DDYIrSKOaa	Jesus said I am the Father are One|`|im0OsH78aa	No, He didn't. Thanks.    Keep reading.|`|Hz2L59BCaa	Yeah he said he wasn't a god, so what, you wanna make something of it?  Oh hell never mind --    Anyway Jesus was a wacko too, but did he claim to be a wacko?

He said that He is the I AM  John 8:58|`|akwVAZcEaa	No.    If you do the 'will' of your parents or friends, it simply means you are putting their desires or needs ahead of your own.  In the instance you refer to, Jesus was in the form of an ordinary man who COULD HAVE used any supernatural powers at His disposal but chose to obey God's will ahead of His own.   God's will, of course, was that Jesus sacrifice His own precious life so that sinners might be saved.|`|znt2s3sMaa	If you really study the verse, Jesus is NOT saying here that He is not God.   He is saying that He came to do the will of the One who sent Him.  Big difference.    When God sent Jesus to earth, he became fully human, so that He can understand what we go through here on earth, and so He can understand our temptations, fears, and emotions.    He is back in Heaven now, at one with God.|`|0fd6c9cd983b835b83ca7be549d67540aa	He also said "I and the Father are one" and "before abraham was,  I am"

He wanted to make sure the man knew what it means when he said He is good    The word Tirnity is not in the Bible, but the concept is in the several places in the Bible|`|9BeUbORtaa	If you've read the Gospels, you'll know that Jesus was very big on rhetorical questions, to get his opponents to condemn themselves out of their own mouths. The gist of this question - which seems rather barbed - is "who do you say that I am? You say I'm good, but only God is good."     I think Jesus implies exactly the opposite of what you think he is saying.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"

There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|um9W8Dy8aa	In that text Christ does not deny that He is God  The Trinity is biblical|`|D9lMg7A2aa	He implies nothing.

Matthew 28:19 Therefore, as you go, disciple people in all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit,    If the Son and Holy Spirit are not important... not divine... why should we be Baptized in their name as well?|`|BKPnG6HKaa	No you're wrong.

Is It Clearly a Bible Teaching?      IF THE Trinity were true, it should be clearly and consistently presented in the Bible. Why? Because, as the apostles affirmed, the Bible is God's revelation of himself to mankind. And since we need to know God to worship him acceptably, the Bible should be clear in telling us just who he is.    First-century believers accepted the Scriptures as the authentic revelation of God. It was the basis for their beliefs, the final authority. For example, when the apostle Paul preached to people in the city of Beroea, "they received the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily as to whether these things were so."Acts 17:10, 11.    What did prominent men of God at that time use as their authority? Acts 17:2, 3 tells us: "According to Paul's custom . . . he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, explaining and proving by references [from the Scriptures]."    Jesus himself set the example in using the Scriptures as the basis for his teaching, repeatedly saying: "It is written." "He interpreted to them things pertaining to himself in all the Scriptures."Matthew 4:4, 7; Luke 24:27.    Thus Jesus, Paul, and first-century believers used the Scriptures as the foundation for their teaching. They knew that "all Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work."2 Timothy 3:16, 17; see also 1 Corinthians 4:6; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:20, 21.    Since the Bible can 'set things straight,' it should clearly reveal information about a matter as fundamental as the Trinity is claimed to be. But do theologians and historians themselves say that it is clearly a Bible teaching?    "Trinity" in the Bible?        A PROTESTANT publication states: "The word Trinity is not found in the Bible . . . It did not find a place formally in the theology of the church till the 4th century." (The Illustrated Bible Dictionary) And a Catholic authority says that the Trinity "is not . . . directly and immediately [the] word of God."New Catholic Encyclopedia.    The Catholic Encyclopedia also comments: "In Scripture there is as yet no single term by which the Three Divine Persons are denoted together. The word  [tri'as] (of which the Latin trinitas is a translation) is first found in Theophilus of Antioch about A. D. 180. . . . Shortly afterwards it appears in its Latin form of trinitas in Tertullian."    However, this is no proof in itself that Tertullian taught the Trinity. The Catholic work TrinitasA Theological Encyclopedia of the Holy Trinity, for example, notes that some of Tertullian's words were later used by others to describe the Trinity. Then it cautions: "But hasty conclusions cannot be drawn from usage, for he does not apply the words to Trinitarian theology."    Testimony of the Hebrew Scriptures        WHILE the word "Trinity" is not found in the Bible, is at least the idea of the Trinity taught clearly in it? For instance, what do the Hebrew Scriptures ("Old Testament") reveal?    The Encyclopedia of Religion admits: "Theologians today are in agreement that the Hebrew Bible does not contain a doctrine of the Trinity." And the New Catholic Encyclopedia also says: "The doctrine of the Holy Trinity is not taught in the O[ld] T[estament]."    Similarly, in his book The Triune God, Jesuit Edmund Fortman admits: "The Old Testament . . . tells us nothing explicitly or by necessary implication of a Triune God who is Father, Son and Holy Spirit. . . . There is no evidence that any sacred writer even suspected the existence of a [Trinity] within the Godhead. . . . Even to see in [the "Old Testament"] suggestions or foreshadowings or 'veiled signs' of the trinity of persons, is to go beyond the words and intent of the sacred writers."Italics ours.    An examination of the Hebrew Scriptures themselves will bear out these comments. Thus, there is no clear teaching of a Trinity in the first 39 books of the Bible that make up the true canon of the inspired Hebrew Scriptures.    Testimony of the Greek Scriptures        WELL, then, do the Christian Greek Scriptures ("New Testament") speak clearly of a Trinity?    The Encyclopedia of Religion says: "Theologians agree that the New Testament also does not contain an explicit doctrine of the Trinity."    Jesuit Fortman states: "The New Testament writers . . . give us no formal or formulated doctrine of the Trinity, no explicit teaching that in one God there are three co-equal divine persons. . . . Nowhere do we find any trinitarian doctrine of three distinct subjects of divine life and activity in the same Godhead."    The New Encyclop?dia Britannica observes: "Neither the word Trinity nor the explicit doctrine appears in the New Testament."    Bernhard Lohse says in A Short History of Christian Doctrine: "As far|`|6Bddw25Taa	Jesus question: why callest though me good? was a rhetorical question. He was highlighting for his listeners that no one can be good without or outside of God, that only God embodies the pure and true nature or abolute being of Goodness.  Jesus makes clear reference to himself as the Chosen One, and the intercessor and Of God.  People knew Jesus as being a very "good" person or example. Thus, he was highlighting for them the only logical conclusion that he is God incarnate, because only God can be Good.  So, he was establishing his divinity while simultaneously highlighting humanity's need and dependence on God (since we can't be good outside of God).  It further enhances his position as God by denouncing idols, false prophets, or community leaders that claim an authority that Jesus stated only belonged to God.  The pharisees challenged Jesus authority. Jesus was conradicting his critics by stating that the term Rabbi (meaning good teacher) only belonged to God, and that to give humans the rights of God (Goodness, power, authority, truth claims, etc) was idoltry or simply false.  So, all in all - Jesus uses many rhetorical methods that aren't always literal (rhetorical questions, euphemisms, poetry, sayings, citing scripture, prophecy, comparison, etc - none of which can be taken simply literally but have to be understood in context).  Hope that helps.  This is a historical account.  What people believe or don't believe is a different issue, but it is important to be historically accurate, no matter what side people take.|`|NsHV4O8oaa	there are loads of books and works that show that the trinity is not in the Bible  in fact, it is widely acknowledged that it was about 400 years after the death of Jesus that the trinity became part of 'christianity'  the council of Nicaea agreed that Jesus was God (although he never claims to be) and some years later this developed into the trinity  there's loads of stuff in the Bible that could easily disprove the trinity and maybe one or two that can be taken either way, but don't in themselves prove anything (they will kid themselves though :) )    jesus is said to be the firstborn of all creation, trinitarians will say that means he is priveleged, although if you didn't have a preconceived idea of the trinity, you wouldn't have thought that. the same word is used in other instances and it means firstborn as in the first one born.    jesus didn't know the day of God's judgement which is odd if he was God. but of course! he was in a human form. still, the Holy Spirit should have known, don't you think?    the controversial John 1:1 - the word was with God and the Word was God  although there are quite a few translations which read "the Word was a God" or "the word was divine" or "of a divine nature"    jesus said he was in union with God. but jesus also said his followers were in union with him    it seems to me that if God and Jesus are mentioned together, they are the same. but if Jesus said his followers are in union with him it is so plainly obvious they can't be the same person, no one thinks that, because that would be wrong.    its interesting that many other religions beforehand had trinities so maybe when the state religion became christianity, to help the other non believers in, they pinched a bit of their religion and tacked it on to christianity.  it most definately is not in the Bible    edit* that one where he's described as mighty god - there are also places where the devil is called a god, and Judas was called a devil - but its so obvious that the devil is not god, and Judas was not the devil, no one gives it a second thought - but Jesus and God are different for some reason....|`|HIEtvdEKaa	jesus told the jews,your lord is one.Jesus said that because he wanted to point that the human real lord or God is one person only or a single entity , a supreme being.God mentioned in the bible that , Compared to God,human being are like maggots and the son of man is like a worm.Is that not clear enough for them ?If you asks the priest,who is this son of man ?they will says it was jesus.We human are full of faeces ,in our stomach,our ears,between our teeth,bowel,under our toe nails,inside our noses,inside our eyes and if we didnt take our shower today,we will feel uneasy.Somebody said in the bible that they saw divinity in jesus,probably they are unaware of the holy spirit presence in Jesus,which was put inside jesus to strengthen his soul.God cannot enter his creation because it is an unholy and dirty  place because God is the most holiness and it is ungodly of him to enter into maggots or a worm.Look down at a worm or maggot,would you like to have sex with them,YUCKS!!! God is up there playing with his remote control,well something like that but God only knows how to control everything without entering his creation.The moon rotates and the earth rotates also,the whole universe is rotating on their axles governed by God alone.If we can think about remote control and God is the supreme being,cant he come up with something better?He is GOD!!.Anyway they are not following Jesus because jesus circumcised,didnt eat pork,said your God is one but Pope says it is ok not to circumcised,eating pork is ok,God is three person.Who is the God's messenger?Jesus or pope paul?They says if you follow jesus,you will enter heaven but are they following jesus or pope paul?Thank you for reading this.I love you.|`|sfEnnsljaa	Matthew 3:16:     16And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:    Matthew 3:17:   And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased    They are seperate. why would jesus say that he is his son and is well pleased of himself? and could see his own spirit come down like a dove? people who believe in trinity still dont get it. jesus is gods son.

Some of those children have been shot and killed while they slept in their own beds.    I think gang members should join the military instead.     Good luck on your project!

jXvHYVq4aa	If you're really gay, it doesn't need "expressing" does it? It's just part you, isn't it?    Unless you're talking about sexual experience. And if that's what you are really talking about, then just remember to always play safe.    Nothing, nobody and no experience is worth dying over and I'm sure you know what I mean (hint HIV).    Otherwise, connect with your local (if you have one) gay, lesbian, bi, trans center and just get out there. You can't meet anyone in your living room.|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	You don't have to, just be yourself|`|9Jddf0nyaa	you dont have to be like anyone else be yourself not be a follower|`|hyYWX82Eaa	Do you mean as in coming out? If that's it, there are a lot of good answers in the resolved questions (Heh, we get that one a lot) If you mean just in your day to day life...just be you. That's not really helpful advice, but there is no one set way to express gayness. It's just how you are, so just be that way. If you can, maybe look up some groups or clubs in your city.     Good luck |`|RSv2E2KNaa	Try develop your own way.|`|AA12006309	What do you mean by "expressing" it?  You don't need to be a rainbow coloured fairy to be out.  I have a small transgender symbol pendant and a rainbow pin on my bag.  That's about it.  It's not something I hide, but it's not something I throw in people's faces either.    Figure out how much you want people to know about you at first glance and go from there.  Jewelry, buttons on your bag or jacket, posts on your Facebook or Myspace are fine ways of expressing your gay pride.  There's no rule that says you have to express it at all.  Just go with your own personal comfort level. Good luck.|`|iwNYcerfaa	First of all, you need to accept yourself for being gay. Many problems with gay/lesbian people is the fact that they can't accept it. Either you're gay or you're not gay. It's up for you to decide that. Many people especially those whom haven't come out do not want to "come out" because they feel they will never be accepted into society because of who or what they are. The fact of the matter is, NOONE gay, straight, bi, lesbian, transexual, hermaphodite,black,white,yellow, green or brown will NEVER be accepted for whom they are. That is how the world turns. I hate to put it this way but whether you "come out" or not about being gay you will always be judged. ALWAYS.     The easiest way of expressing your life style, is to just be YOU. and only YOU. Don't give a damn what others think of you. You know who you are and you are the only person that will ever know.|`|utMcsTlUaa	When you are gay, you don't need to come out and be like "HEY Y'ALL, RAINBOW PRIDE." Because who you are is not that, who you are is how you behave now. Gayness does not make up etirely who you are. I don't know if I'm making any sense, but just basically, be yourself. You don't have to prove to anybody that you're gay, or flaunt being gay, because you are so much more than just gay. Just be yourself.    As far as coming out goes, you just need to sit down and talk to people about it if you feel they should or need to know. Don't try and make them figure it out subliminally, just let them know if the topic arises, flat out. Don't confuse people or make them unsure, that will only widen a gap between you.|`|H4bOkSTaaa	I am a lesbian who considers myself to be neither butch or fem i have sides of each so expression doesn't come easy for me either i feel like i don't have to       really you have to ask your self do just want to be apart of another stereotype    just keep being your natural self the gay power always comes from somewhere or someone     some people have certain influences around them make gay friends you reflect the company you keep

But He has given me gifts and a command to use them in His name.    Time grows short and there is much still to do.  I work to spread the Gospel so that those who do not know my Lord can meet Him.  For He loves each and every person and wants them all to be with Him.  I love my Lord more than life, itself.  I will do everything I can to honor His name and do His will.  And when my task is done, He will summon me to be with Him, and that will be a great day for me.

She'll eventually have to accept your lifestyle if she expects to have any kind of decent relationship with you, so the ball is in her court. Just wait and see how she plays it.......|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	As a parent, I can't think of ANYTHING that would make me turn on my kids (now 22 and 25) like this.  As far as I know, both my kids are straight...but if they weren't, it wouldn't concern me in the least.  What WOULD concern me though was how they were going to be treated by OTHER people...and maybe your mom 'flipping out' is her way of exhibiting this fear.  But, I can only imagine how bad it feels to be judged so negatively by someone you love and depend on for such a large part of your identity...and I'm sorry.     The best you can do is be who you are.  Your mom loves you...she's just been thrown for a loop is all.  When she sees that your 'lifestyle' hasn't really changed who you are at your core, she'll come around...she'll HAVE to, if she values her relationship with you.  But don't YOU change to please someone else.  It's far easier to deal with someone else disliking who and what you are, than it is for YOU to dislike what and who you ARE...you absolutely will not recover from that.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	go lesbo!|`|aXYiOskmaa	wow, i'm real sorry you have to go through this. i think all you can do for now is let her cool down and come to grips with this. she obviously wasn't even close to expecting this so it will take some time.  perhaps find a book for parents in this situation and give it to her.|`|b7TueUUPaa	try this: "mom, this is really a  blessing in disguise.. you won't have to worry about teenage pregnancy."    lmao. i'm so fkn funny!! hhaahha|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Don't say anything right now. People who are flipping aren't good listeners.    If necessary, leave.    She needs to calm down.    It may be a while before she's able to accept this; she my never accept it. It's not under your control.    But it's only after she calms down that you have any chnce of educating her (there are SO bisexual people -- maybe arm yourself with things she can read when calmer).    Talk to PFLAG -- Parents & Friends of Lesbians and Gays -- many of those parents went through what your mom is now, such as initial shock and rejection.|`|AA11788494	That is one reason I don't have kids.

They were actually more vicious to me than anyone else I told was, which I thought was kind of ironic.  ...but later on I realised that they were just afraid for me, that people would think I was a freak, etc, etc, and judge me because of my orientation.  You need to give her time to process the info. Remember, she's not a modern teen or young adult, she grew up in a different era than we did, where people were being killed for liking the same gender.  Not much you can do, really...  I resented them for a long time, I still do, but I will say that eventually the storm will end.|`|5ajPMlrqaa	Tell her that it's not her fault, your sexuality.

I say give her time.  Is there a book you could buy for her that is aimed at parents of bisexual children?  You could also ask her why she is upset.  Tell her that you aren't doing it to hurt her... it's just that the girlfriend feels right.  Ask her if she would like to meet the girl.  Assure her that you are handling everything in a mature manner and would do nothing to draw attention to yourself or to your family.

Showing up is for the family.  As for how to dress, jeans are fine if that's all you have.  Just make sure they're not dirty, or ripped.  Wear a shirt with a collar.  Don't worry too much about it.  Truthfully, no one is going to notice.  I've been to wakes where people showed up in dirty work clothes...and even then, it was understood that the person took the time out of their day to show up right after work.

hmTVcteoaa	If you're a native English speaker its because Slavic languages are less closely related to English.  <br>  <br>  English is closely related to German because of the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes who settled in England, and related to Latin (and its descendants) because of England's settlement by the Romans and the Normans). <br>  <br>  The Slavs never immigrated en masse to England; at least not when the language was at its formative stage.  That is why they had little influence on the language and, therefore, to a native English speaker Slavic languages are more difficult to learn.<br>  <br>  EDIT: As Scott L. just said Asian languages are even harder to learn than Slavic languages.  This is because English has even less in common with Asian languages than it does with Slavic languages.  <br>  <br>  It all goes back to the origin of languages.  The closer the common ancestral language is to English, the easier it will be for a native English speaker to learn that language.|`|631d898eda9d1327e73c3f692a061adcaa	Haha. try some of the asian ones.

I wont go to Denver until the Breed Laws are taken out.|`|hHjPFxEdaa	Every one I've ever seen does this, they run around when they're all excited so fast their back legs almost catch up to their front. Also, they all love to play tug but they're so strong they almost yank your arm out of the socket and they never want to stop.|`|3hYUNHphaa	i have been around pit-bulls all my life, and mine have all exuded those behaviors, except the blanket thing, my dogs hate covers, clothes, etc.    another thing, is that almost all pit-bulls are nothing more than big babies, especially mine! they love to roll over on their bellies for a belly rub, and they get so jealous when one dog is getting more attention than them.
EmOc9wzPaa	I agree, Valentines should be everyday if your in a relationship. But I'm getting my boo ( or trying to) a Affliction shirt or Black label shirt... or maybe some jeans... depends on the money... I plan on giving my girls something too. Most of them are single :(|`|t1WOxnI8aa	Nothing. I don't give material things that can be lost or replaced in exchange for the words I love you. Every day should be Valentines day.
cpOtr6Thaa	Yes, Jesus did say love one another and it means everyone.  There are Christians that fail to love homosexuals, but there are others that succeed.  This doesn't mean we agree with/condone the lifestyle.  There are occasions when speaking up for what we believe is necessary, but some people go too far. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry to those on the receiving end of their hatred.|`|mNMp8J3qaa	No Jesus loves everyone, even gays however they are sent to Hell because of sin.|`|AA11008046	Jesus qualified the satement "as I have loved you" and was referring to the relationship of Believers to each other.<br>  For the second  part of your question Jesus in the same chapter continued by teaching the Relationship of a Believer and the world with this quote "..If the world hates you, know that it hated me before it hated you.."  "..He who hates Me (Jesus) hates my Father (God) also.." "..and He (God) will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they (worldly people) do not believe in Me (Jesus)<br>  When Jesus taught to "Love one another even as I have loved you." that was talking about one believer to another.  When he continued with the world will hate you but know that they hated Me before they did you.." He is tellin Christians they WILL be hated and mistreated by other people but not to be upset nor surprised.  The (world) hated Jesus also.<br>  That says nothing about loving gays or any body except other christian brothers and sisters.  However, Jesus also taught to be kind to everyone or as the Bible says it "not to revile" anyone and Jesus also said he loved the sinner but not the sin.  God quoted before Jesus was even born the Homosexuality was sin.  So then we cannot dislike or hate the gay person; it is their sinful gay action that the Christian dislikes and is supported by God the Father.<br>  There isn't any place in the Bible (Gods Word) that asks the christian to like, put up with, or turn a blind eye to sin.  On the other hand God has always instructed us to follow in His footsteps so to speak so that being so, we cannot hate any body; we just are instructed to speak out against sin in whatever form we come across it.  Let me add, that sin I mention here is what the Bible calls sin and not some other version of my own as to what is sin and what is not.<br>  Trust & Pray this helps you understand the passage you quote.|`|sPDOMTTjaa	The entire Bible is not made up of this one verse that you quote. Just because you don't agree with someones gay lifestyle doesn't mean that you don't love them or that you hate them. My mom is gay; I love her, but what she is doing is wrong. Will my mom go to Hell? I don't know, That's up to God, not me. You are to love them, just not what they're doing. <br>  <br>  Also, the Bible does not say-'Love ye one another and do anything that you want to do. It doesn't matter how many sins you commit or which way you live, if you love one another that's all that counts'; no, see it doesn't say that.

The New Testament was complete by AD 95, some sixty years or so after Jesus’ death.  There is not a single classical literary work in the world that maintains as many extant copies so closely transcribed from the original as does the New Testament.  This would obviously include such notable authors and their respective works as: Caesar, Livy, Plato, Thucydides, Herodotus, Horace, Sophocles, Lucretius, Catullus, Euripedes, Demosthenes, Aristotle, Aristophanes and Homer (lliad).  (See McDowell New Evidence that Demands a Verdict.)<br>  <br>  Note: To reject resources simply because one does not wish to believe in an account (without empirical evidence to the contrary) is to enter into the logical fallacy of genetic.<br>  <br>  <br>  EXTRA-CANONICAL WRITINGS (to name but a few):<br>  <br>  <br>  The following extra-canonical sources affirm the historicity of Jesus of Nazareth:<br>  <br>  <br>  Flavius Josephus:  This 1st century Jewish historian and Pharisee wrote: "Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure.  He drew over to him both many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles.  He was the Christ, and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principle men among us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for he appeared to them alive the third day; as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him." (Antiquities.xviii.33).<br>  <br>  <br>  Thallus the Samaritan: This 1st century historian affirmed the reality of Christ and the fact that darkness consumed the land upon His death (cf. Mark 15.33), attributing the incident to naturalistic causes (e.g., a solar eclipse).  Julius Africanus later exclaimed how unreasonable this theory seemed in light of the natural evidence for "divine" manipulation: the season in which Christ died, the season of the Paschal "full moon."  In other words, it was "Supernatural" for a full moon and a solar eclipse to occur simultaneously.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cornelius Tacitus: This Roman historian and Governor to Asia (AD 112) alluded to the<br>  <br>  death of Christ and the presence of Christians in Rome (Annals XV.44).<br>  <br>  <br>  Lucian of Samosata: This 2nd century satirist and author wrote repeatedly and scornfully of Christ and the Christians (see, The Passing Peregrinus, section 25, and Alexander the False Prophet, section 29).<br>  <br>  <br>  Suetonlus (AD 120): This Roman historian, a court official under Hadrian (and annalist of the Imperial House), recorded incidents relating to Christ and his followers (see, Life of Claudius 25.4, and Lives of the Caesars, 26.2).<br>  <br>  <br>  Plinius Secundus (AD 112): As the Governor of Bithynia, he wrote extensively on the government's attempt to annihilate Christians.  In a letter to Trajan, he appeared bewildered by the fact that Christians refused to bow down to either the bust of Trajan or to curse Christ even when threatened with death (Epistles X.96).<br>  <br>  <br>  Tertulllan (AD 197): This jurist-theologian of Carthage defended Christianity in front of the Roman authorities in Africa.  In his re-capitalization of an exchange between Tiberius and Pontius Pilate he confirmed Tiberius's (Caesar's) recognition of the "Divinity" of Jesus (see Apology, V.2).<br>  <br>  <br>  Phlegon: This 1st century historian wrote about Christ's death and was quoted by Africanus as saying, that "during the time of Tiberius Caesar an eclipse of the sun occurred [Supernaturally, see "Thallus" above] during the full moon."  This account further substantiates|`|m3YC7Jcyaa	According to the left wing, that he read the Torah and confirmed it.<br>  I don't see any evidence that Jesus ever read or wrote anything.|`|LHHNs4Voaa	like, how literate are you <br>  <br>  I notice in every question you ask you have to use the word like in the wrong context|`|AA11203798	as jesus's double my maidens do everything for me OK?|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Article 4. Whether Christ should have committed His doctrine to writing?<br>  <br>  Objection 1. It would seem that Christ should have committed His doctrine to writing. For the purpose of writing is to hand down doctrine to posterity. Now Christ's doctrine was destined to endure for ever, according to Luke 21:33: "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away." Therefore it seems that Christ should have committed His doctrine to writing.<br>  <br>  Objection 2. Further, the Old Law was a foreshadowing of Christ, according to Hebrews 10:1: "The Law has [Vulgate: 'having'] a shadow of the good things to come." Now the Old Law was put into writing by God, according to Exodus 24:12: "I will give thee" two "tables of stone and the law, and the commandments which I have written." Therefore it seems that Christ also should have put His doctrine into writing.<br>  <br>  Objection 3. Further, to Christ, who came to enlighten them that sit in darkness (Luke 1:79), it belonged to remove occasions of error, and to open out the road to faith. Now He would have done this by putting His teaching into writing: for Augustine says (De Consensu Evang. i) that "some there are who wonder why our Lord wrote nothing, so that we have to believe what others have written about Him. Especially do those pagans ask this question who dare not blame or blaspheme Christ, and who ascribe to Him most excellent, but merely human, wisdom. These say that the disciples made out the Master to be more than He really was when they said that He was the Son of God and the Word of God, by whom all things were made." And farther on he adds: "It seems as though they were prepared to believe whatever He might have written of Himself, but not what others at their discretion published about Him." Therefore it seems that Christ should have Himself committed His doctrine to writing.<br>  <br>  On the contrary, No books written by Him were to be found in the canon of Scripture.<br>  <br>  I answer that, It was fitting that Christ should not commit His doctrine to writing. First, on account of His dignity: for the more excellent the teacher, the more excellent should be his manner of teaching. Consequently it was fitting that Christ, as the most excellent of teachers, should adopt that manner of teaching whereby His doctrine is imprinted on the hearts of His hearers; wherefore it is written (Matthew 7:29) that "He was teaching them as one having power." And so it was that among the Gentiles, Pythagoras and Socrates, who were teachers of great excellence, were unwilling to write anything. For writings are ordained, as to an end, unto the imprinting of doctrine in the hearts of the hearers.<br>  <br>  Secondly, on account of the excellence of Christ's doctrine, which cannot be expressed in writing; according to John 21:25: "There are also many other things which Jesus did: which, if they were written everyone, the world itself, I think, would not be able to contain the books that should be written." Which Augustine explains by saying: "We are not to believe that in respect of space the world could not contain them . . . but that by the capacity of the readers they could not be comprehended." And if Christ had committed His doctrine to writing, men would have had no deeper thought of His doctrine than that which appears on the surface of the writing.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, that His doctrine might reach all in an orderly manner: Himself teaching His disciples immediately, and they subsequently teaching others, by preaching and writing: whereas if He Himself had written, His doctrine would have reached all immediately.<br>  <br>  Hence it is said of Wisdom (Proverbs 9:3) that "she hath sent her maids to invite to the tower." It is to be observed, however, that, as Augustine says (De Consensu Evang. i), some of the Gentiles thought that Christ wrote certain books treating of the magic art whereby He worked miracles: which art is condemned by the Christian learning. "And yet they who claim to have read those books of Christ do none of those things which they marvel at His doing according to those same books. Moreover, it is by a Divine judgment that they err so far as to assert that these books were, as it were, entitled as letters to Peter and Paul, for that they found them in several places depicted in company with Christ. No wonder that the inventors were deceived by the painters: for as long as Christ lived in the mortal flesh with His disciples, Paul was no disciple of His."<br>  <br>  Reply to Objection 1. As Augustine says in the same book: "Christ is the head of all His disciples who are members of His body. Consequently, when they put into writing what He showed forth and said to them, by no means must we say that He wrote nothing: since His members put forth that which they knew under His dictation. For at His command they, being His hands, as it were, wrote whatever He wished us to read concerning His deeds and words."<br>  <br>  Reply to Objection 2. Since the old Law was given under the form of sensible signs, th

Qu1nTLz4aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Human Rights Watch defines "honor killings" as follows:<br>  <br>  Honor crimes are acts of violence, usually murder, committed by male family members against female family members, who are held to have brought dishonor upon the family. A woman can be targeted by (individuals within) her family for a variety of reasons, including: refusing to enter into an arranged marriage, being the victim of a sexual assault, seeking a divorce—even from an abusive husband—or (allegedly) committing adultery. The mere perception that a woman has behaved in a way that "dishonors" her family is sufficient to trigger an attack on her life.[1]|`|AH1LuqZMaa	Honor killing and Murder is forbidden in Islam, just because it happens has nothing to do with the religion.|`|5AbCtkWFaa	As far as I know, yes.

1NtwIeLyaa	The word "spiritual" doesn't necessarily mean Christian.  I don't consider myself either.

I don't really put a whole lot of stock into the rituals that go on during church service.  I think some are important but some are not necessary.  I look at it like this: If I was on a desert island by myself where there's no church, how would I convene with God?  And that's what I've tried to achieve, an ability to speak to God through my heart and from the depths of my soul, whether I am at church or driving in my car or doing yoga, whatever.|`|9YMLsk7Taa	Last night at Bible study we were asked to pray for someone else other than who we usually pray for. While i was kneeling in prayer i realized i was crying. This happens to me when people are getting baptized, giving testimonies, or when i'm singing or praising God! I use to never cry and now i do at the drop of a hat! So to answer the Q. i think this happens cause we are in awe of God. Who He is and what He has done for us. It is a most sincere form of worship as it does come from the heart!

I suspect you are restricting praise and worship to music / song, however. Yet there can be times of feeling deep love during private prayer, or reading the Bible, or when serving others. Sometimes it is when Christians are grief-stricken, or guilt-stricken and repentant, that the Lord breaks through to them with a powerful sense of His love, acceptance and forgiveness. But let's stick to music, if that is your question.<br>  <br>  Soul singer Irene Stevenson said, "Real religion is something beautiful that happens in church when folks don't allow things to get in between themselves and the worship of God." She believes that people in church today rely too much on instrumental accompaniment, which can get in the way of real worship. Everything depends on our hearts during worship. God knows what our hearts are like. We can deceive ourselves into thinking a spiritual 'experience' (i.e. emotional feeling) is proof of spirituality, when it need not be anything of the sort. Being born of God is a moment in time when the Holy Spirit brings that person to new life in Christ. There need not be any emotional feelings present at that time. If we go by our emotions as indicators of spirituality, our faith will be all over the place; up one moment, down the other. That isn't faith!|`|8ycAi8Huaa	Sorry I dont believe in God I cant believe in some thing that I cant see.

Every human being who has faith in God talks to God, God doesn't talk to them.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	I don't know what they think, but I know that their "entrancement" is an act or demonstration.|`|RyhluHk3aa	First of all, one of the things that God calls Christians to have is a sober mind. Getting carried away in outward expressions of anything, including your feelings toward the Lord, is not being sober minded.<br>  I spent 2 years in Pentecostalism, before learning how to "rightly divide the word of truth". I saw people with their screaming, casting themselves on the floor, running, dancing a jig, and other expressions. Although the Lord Jesus was speaking to Israel in the 4 Gospels, all scripture is good for reproof, doctrine, etc., as the apostle Paul teaches in 2 Tim. The Lord Jesus said to pray and do your alms in private, and the Father who sees in private, shall reward you openly. He taught to not be as the heathen, doing these things to be seen of men, for that IS their reward.<br>  <br>  Being spiritual means to allow your mind and your heart to worship and desire the things of God. Your flesh is always going to lust after things of the flesh. That is why we are a part of the circumcision that is NOT made by hands, within the Body of Christ. Circumcision is the "cutting away of the flesh". When we believe in the finished work of Christ on the cross, we receive the circumcision not made by hands, in that Christ cuts away our flesh; i.e., we are no longer judged on what we do (in our flesh), but rather on our faith in Him.<br>  <br>  Knowing these things IS the reason that the apostle Paul teaches us in 2 Tim. 2:15, to "Study to show yourselves approved unto God; a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."<br>  <br>  A person can NOT be lazy and lax, where Bible study is concerned, if he or she intends to follow the Lord. Thinking that a pastor, or Sunday school teacher studies the word enough for both you and themselves is foolish, for where they err, you also follow that error.<br>  <br>  I would highly recommend to anyone wishing to do the will of the Father, to study the Bible with an organization, or individuals that study God's word, rightly divided, such as:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bereanbiblesociety.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.bereanbiblesociety.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.rightdivision.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.rightdivision.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.graceteacher.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.graceteacher.com</a><br>  <br>  Also, for anyone caught up in the lies that are religion in the churches of today that do not teach the grace of God, I would highly recommend (for the poster of this question, especialy) that you get a book titled "The PLOT" by Bob Enyart. It is the result of 25 years of studying God's word, rightly divided; and it will teach you the difference between the Law and Grace, and how to rightly divide the word of truth.<br>  <br>  Rightly dividing the word of truth, and understanding what the difference between circumcision and uncircumcision is, spiritually, is the key to understanding scriptures, and allowing the scriptures to correctly interpret themselves.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I can see by your responses to answers in your "additional details", that you believe that we are to obey the commandments. What then, do you do with the scriptures that teach us that Christ nailed the Law to His cross, taking it out of the way?? If you seek to be justified by the commandments, then you are fallen from grace. It appears that you do not fully understand what the Lord accomplished on the cross. Paul writes that he fears for those that seek to be put back "under the yoke of bondage" to the Law. If you seek to "obey" Jesus, in what He said in the 4 Gospels, then you are saying that His grace is not sufficient for you, and you would rather follow the Law.

I dunno if you are old enough to remember the hoopla over the JonBenet Ramsey case.  Every tiny detail about how she was killed was released and people salivated over it.

I'm just upset about it, because they talked about the little boy for like two minutes, like they just wanted to get him out of the way and get back to the little Anthony girl.

iH7ZB5Soaa	All the Powerful Maker is infinitely close to beings, they are infinitely distant from him. Furthermore, despite His infinite might and glory, attaching importance to them, He also sets in order the most insignificant and lowly matters, and does not deny them the beauty of His art. Thus, the perfect order within absolute ease observed in beings testifies to the existence of this Qur’anic truth. The following comparison demonstrates its meaning and wisdom. For example, And God’s is the highest similitude, the duties the sun displays through the dominical command and Divine subjugation, which is like a dense mirror to the Divine Name of Light among the All-Glorious Maker’s Most Beautiful Names, brings this truth closer to the understanding. It is as follows:<br>  Although through its elevatedness, the sun is infinitely close to all transparent and shining things, indeed, is closer to them than their own selves, and although it has an effect on them in numerous ways like through its manifestation, its image, and power of disposal, those transparent objects are thousands of years distant from it, they can in no way have an effect on it, they cannot claim to be close to it. Also, the sun’s being as though present and seeing in all transparent particles, and wherever its light enters even, is understood through the sun’s reflection and its image being apparent in accordance with the particles’ capacities and colours. Furthermore, the sun’s comprehensiveness and penetration increase to the vast extent of its luminosity. It is because of the greatness of its luminosity that the tiniest things cannot hide or escape from it. This means that through the mystery of luminosity its immense vastness does not exclude even insignificant and tiny things; on the contrary, it takes them within the sphere of its comprehension.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	If God was near,  If His Spirit was within people, then people wouldn't need religion.<br>  <br>  So obviously Muhammad had to make Islam necessary.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I got a thumbs up...likely because someone misunderstood me.  <br>  <br>  Muhammad made God out to be an aloof, far-off judge...one who does not become one with His creation.

While it is true (Christians) -- support Isreal as a Nation, because the God of our bible tells us that in turn we shall be blessed as a nation.

We see Islam as a pseudo-Christian heresy that was invented by a miss-lead man.  <br>  <br>  A Muslin is going to hell for rejecting the divinity of Jesus, just like a Jew, a Hindu, or a JW.

e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	Whichever one you like the best.  My favorite is the Jerusalem Bible.  It has clear, understandable English, and lots of cool footnotes.<br>  <br>  But remember too that most protestants use a shortened version of the Bible, that doesn't contain the apocrypha.  So if you get one of those, you won't have access to:<br>  <br>  1 Esdras<br>  2 Esdras<br>  Tobit <br>  Judith <br>  Esther 10:4-16:24<br>  Wisdom <br>  Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) <br>  Baruch and the Epistle of Jeremy <br>  Daniel 3: 24 - 90 and Daniel 13 - 14<br>  1 Maccabees <br>  2 Maccabees<br>  <br>  I don't think the Church requires you to have a Bible with the apocrypha, but they're some pretty interesting writing, so I'd suggest it.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Catholics are not compelled to buy a bible.<br>  <br>  I would ignore the person who said turn to religion, and instead concentrate on tackling these issues you say are giving you a bad time.|`|yQNit56Qaa	<a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...</a><br>  <br>  As for free - you're probably going to get a New American Bible if you are in the U.S.<br>  <br>  Jim|`|ulwXFrrJaa	lol<br>  <br>  because different denominations have different books in the Bible.

Too many errors..... and it is from a King and not inspired, it's like getting a bible commissioned by Bill Clinton<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|4GiIXWUXaa	Well, any version that is Standard will be sufficient.<br>  <br>  KJV is old school but if you like that kind of lingo, go for it.<br>  Other than that, the NIV is acceptable. It is a modern translation of the KJV.<br>  <br>  There is also the NKJV, the RSV, NRSV, ASB, NASB, ASV, ESV, NLT, CJB, LB, AB (Amplified Bible) The Message and the Interlinear. Et cetera.<br>  <br>  The Amplified and The Message are paraphrased. I wouldn't suggest those for a New Reader.  The Living Bible and the Complete Jewish Bible are good for study purposes as is the Interlinear and some others.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to go with the NIV (New International Version) or the NRSV (New Revised Standard Version) or the NKJV (New King James Version).<br>  <br>  These Bibles aformentioned all say the exact same thing. They are not "new versions" in the sense of changing Text Content and Inference, but simply a rephrasing of that which is written into more modern English.<br>  <br>  i.e., Psalm 27:1 <br>  KJV: The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? <br>  NKJV: The Lord is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid? <br>  NIV: The Lord is my light and my salvation-- whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life-- of whom shall I be afraid? <br>  NRSV: The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? <br>  <br>  The only "translation" that is not valid is the NWT used by Jehovah's Witnesses. (But you cannot buy those;) All other translations are acceptable and can be purchased anywhere. IF you look online there are plenty of places that offer free Bibles, or Bibles for only a few dollars.<br>  <br>  I would suggest checking out this website, you can sample versions of the Bible to see which one (version) you think you would enjoy the most. <br>  <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Psalms+27%3A1§ion=0&version=niv&new=1&showtools=1&oq=&NavBook=ps&NavGo=27&NavCurrentChapter=27" rel="nofollow">http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBi...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps. xoxo ?<br>  <br>  *edit* The Douay-Rheims, Darby Translation, Webster Bible, Latin Vulgate, Weymouth NT are not acceptable as a 1st Bible. The Reason Being is that they are older translations and are better for one who studies the word in depth and is already aquainted with Scripture.<br>  Jon M is right, Protestants do not Include the Apocrypha because it was not part of the original Hebrew Canon and there are inconsistencies within the text of those books in conjunction to Scripture.  You can read the Apocrypha simply to read it, but we reject it as Divine Scripture. So it will not be listed in any of the Versions I have listed, which are all considered Valid Translations of the Bible.|`|38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	The "generic" kind of Bible would probably be a King James with the Apocrypha, but the archaic language can be a bit of a turn off. I prefer the New American Bible (Catholic edition) for its ease of reading. Make sure it *is* the Catholic edition which contains the books removed by the Protestants.<br>  <br>  If you want a free Catholic Bible, I suggest calling your nearest Catholic Church and seeing if they can help you. Many times they have Bibles at little or no cost to you. You can also Google "Free online Bibles," and download a version to your computer.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Just thought of something. If there are any thrift stores near you, check their book section. I've gotten everything from the beautiful leather-bound NAB that's my current favorite to a large copy of the St. Joseph edition of the Bible and never paid more than $3 for any of them.<br>  <br>  It's the luck of the draw as to whether you'll find a Catholic edition, but resale and thrift stores usually have Bibles. If you've got a St. Vincent DePaul thrift store in your town, check there first.|`|GdXOjRNmaa	Catholics adhere to the Jerusalem Bible.

The parts of me I left on the farm will invade the next city and take over America as best I can.<br>  <br>       I will boat to china and there rural area will be easy prey and then all of Europe will fall and soon the world will be mine and if al gore is right, global warming will finish the cities and no cold Antarctica will be left for any safe haven to the humans, even if not, I will use there nuclear weapons against them and then I will have no opposition, for the animals of the forest will fall because the woods are my turf alone.<br>  <br>       Then I will study myself, breed my genes using human technologies and I will be the ultimate life form. Then I can adapt and live on the other planets and wait for outsiders to enter my solar system. I will utilize the human’s machines to make an unstoppable battle front out of the solar system.<br>  <br>       I will use the human technologies and build many hundreds of comets out of the asteroid belt that can support my life form and can send back to my base. The planets will not expect it I study and research the planet before I experiment and consume the population. I shall take over the top races of the planets and the rest will be my followers and slaves. Any one who opposes shall be executed, rebels and there associates are shamed and have no rights to live.<br>  <br>       Rebel factions and planets oppose me, they try but the human nuclear weapons make them cower in fear.

Cause alot of stuff goes down in pregnancy, and it would suck if you were like, in the womb for 5 months and then died, or if you were a still birth.|`|NsHV4O8oaa	i remember seeing this question before about this the lie in genesis when the serpent said "you will not die"  and this person asked 'does anyone realise that this is still a lie?'  basically that when you die, you don't really have a choice what you want to do next - its not like getting a new job - you're dead!  we don't have souls|`|7cLYgf2raa	At conception you are completely at the blessing or the curse of your parents. If your mother chooses through selfishness you would be too much, then you will be killed. If the mother chooses to call you a blessing, you will live.      At conception you become a living spirirt. You entered eternity right then.You have a soul, made up of your mind, will, and emotions. They are a blank slate. Ready to be programmed by your parents and the environment they choose to raise  you in.Now, if you pick up a lot of junk from them,and you accept Jesus as Lord, you may have to have your  soul renewed to the way God thinks by reading and confessing the word of God.It will come a day when you make all your decisions and you will be accountable fro everyone of them.
3e6a7b1f3e03a56ef0cc271441e2531daa	Most people operate on first impressions.  If you don't dress like a deviant then people won't treat you like one.  Your appearance, demeanor and attitude will go a long way to determining what people think of you.    I am sure that there are plenty of transsexuals who pass as a female and have not problems with society.  However, if a transsexual girl, looks like a guy, sounds like a guy, walks like a guy, acts like a guy and wears sexy women's clothes - well, he will be treated like a pervert.|`|lPPgMKibaa	no, trans just means you were in the wrong body.|`|xEI2sXKMaa	i think alot of them are deviant because that's what it takes to get sexually accepted.    maybe in the far future people will open there minds?    (im not a TG person, just doesn't bother me)|`|W11nQzVPaa	Transgender? Perhaps so as many people are misinformed and generally ignorant. The shemales in porn add fuel to the fire by listing themselves as transsexuals wherein folks get the wrong idea about transwomen. Education on this is still in its' infancy and society will not correct its errors all too easily. I still remember all black people being classed as the "Bogey man"! Such nonsense but it held for many generations and look what it took to change that. Diversity is changing but oh so slowly.  Sharon|`|BTpNkxoeaa	No.  Transsexuality is all about gender identity, not sexual kinks or libido.  There certainly are trans folks who go around flaunting their sexuality, but there are many times more trans folks who strive to live normal lives and don't let their sexual desires rule them.    You shouldn't let what you see on craigslist personals or porn affect what being trans is really about.  A lot of people on craigslist post their explicit personal ads as a way to gain some form of approval from somebody , which in a lot of ways is tragic.  Many more are prostitutes.  Porn in general is hyperexaggerated at best and often pure fantasy to fuel people's sexual kinks.  The portrayal of trans people in porn is no exception.  The "shemale" porn stars are a far cry from a true transsexual because their male parts are still fully functional, which is all but impossible if they're on hormone replacement therapy.    I suggest maybe attending a transgender support group if you're not doing so already.  You'll find a lot of everyday trans people there and maybe make some good friends out of it.

How heavy it is to have to get in the habit of dealing with it.  The best I came up with was to keep my eyes straight ahead on walkways, ignoring h*ll out of offenders.

It's dicey though, considering the fact that they don't, to the best of my knowledge, utilize any form of technology. Of course, I could be wrong. It's happened in the past, and I'm sure that at some point in time, it could happen again in the future. Good luck with that, though, sounds like it might come to be a very special relationship.

KEAfTavqaa	Do what ever makes you happy, but a lot of times parents know what is right for their kids! To be honest I wouldn't want my son to have long highlighted hair. I really don't want to offend you, but that is girly. I don't know where you live, but I live in LA where everyone get the famous Hollywood Highlights. I also work at a hair salon. We only have guys with short blonde hair getting their hair highlighted to look more sun kissed and it looks natural. But if it makes you happy then do what you want with your self, because it makes YOU happy. Another thing I have to agree with your parents. If you want a professional job you have to look professional. Professional jobs will not hire you if you have long hair and you're a guy. Yeah I know its sad. But if you are working in a professional place then you are representing that certain someone or some company and you don't want people to laugh at you. Sorry for telling you all this, but its better to know the truth and do something about it.|`|16EYP0Xiaa	waaaaaaaaaah|`|G5Huk19Xaa	be yourself. if you follow what everybody else wants for you, instead of what you want, then youre going to be miserable like this forever. if you are a nice, respectful, and are willing to work, im am positive you will get a job. dont worry, just dont give up.<br>  uniqueness = amazingness.

Others will love your style while others will hate it!<br>  Then there's always the "in-between" people, they'll probably agree with you and go with your style, since they aren't really on either side.<br>  <br>  This is really all there is too it. About work, though... You might get judged, but probably only if it actually makes a difference.<br>  It's all about your personality anyway, so if you're nice you'll get them to like you and the chances are they'll hire you whetever you're gay or from another country or religion.|`|GDMO3xV7aa	if youre not pissin at least one person off, youre not doing something right.<br>  <br>  youre complainin that not everyone loves you? well why should they, people have their own opinions and views through life. confidence and bravery is what stops you from cracking under the pressure and always believing in yourself, although of course we all have moments of weakness.<br>  <br>  of course you can be an individual, but if you go around wearing clown shoes and constantly singing then of course thats the kind of behaviour people are gonna ***** about, since it likely annoys or aggrevates them (that said, if you did that i would definitely laugh at first) people arent scared of whats new in another person, they simply want someone that they feel happy and secure around. so stop whining, since thats how youre coming across, and try to figure out how you can sort out your problem.
iLFYj6Qgaa	I don't think you'll find any belly dancing in Latin America. You will find salsa, mambo, cha cha cha, merengue, zouk and many other dances though. For example in Cuba and the Dominican Republic (amongst others). In Brazil, there's also the samba, think of the Carnival in Rio De Janeiro.|`|Le53Bggxaa	Its too broad.<br>  <br>  I'm Dominican American and we don't belly dance.

XKJ64REuaa	I am also a mixed kid who has pondered over this question in the past.  <br>  I think the reason why you have to pick one race, and only one race, is so somebody out there can classify you into a certain category and make qualitative comparisons based on race.  These generalizations could be considered stereotypes, don't you think?  The individual is being disregarded and is being considered on a more generalized category. <br>  Well, how do you choose which square to check?  I usually make it my advantage by checking the box which could be more beneficial for me.  For example, the SAT's.  I checked the Asian box instead of the Caucasian box so that I would qualify for more scholarships.  Some things in life just aren't fair so when it's not, make it your advantage rather than being upset about it.  Just be confident in who you are and don't allow a questionnaire to alter your mood.|`|7d2e1c957453fc8d4829969618e83382aa	Thank you!!!!<br>  <br>  Most places are finally getting boxes for "biracial" or "multiracial" instead of checking the "other" box all the freakin' time. After all, what box does Barack Obama check? He's biracial!<br>  <br>  I get annoyed when people assume black/white, too. I'm black/white/Native, my one best friend is black/Indian/Native, and my other best friend is black/Latina.

These people more often than not have issues with themselves and tend to lean towards being self righteous, illogical, boastful and self centered.

If she doesn't get the hint, the first or second time, a nice curt 'okay goodnight' and walk away should do.<br>  More than likely, if that's just how she is, she won't pick up on your cues no matter what you try.

I had a coworker who would do that.  She'd assume she knew the rest of your thought and would interrupt and head off in the direction of her own thought when really none of it had anything to do with what you were trying to say.  It's so frustrating and annoying!  <br>  <br>  I'm guessing it's a sign of insecurity, like people who blurt out what's coming next at the movies.  They want whoever they're with (and clearly the whole theatre) to know they were smart or clever enough to figure it out.  Well, everyone else knew, too, but we just want to watch the movie unfold without the commentary.<br>  <br>  I just started calmly interrupting back, "No, that's not what I was going to say.  Let me finish..."  Or in the case of changing the subject to one of her own, say, "That's interesting, but back to what I was saying..."  After a few times it calmed the behavior a little, but not entirely.  You can't fix everyone.|`|216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	Just tell her.

One of the reasons I accepted Christ as my savior is that I desired the love and joy I saw in Christians. <br>  <br>  "The whole duty of man is to love God and enjoy Him forever."|`|Qu1nTLz4aa	Hedonism doesn't have a bible. It's a philosophy, not a religion. Put simply, it's about seeking pleasure. <br>  <br>  Read the Wikipedia article. It's short and informative.|`|08ae3d05d7e2c113fc49e08dbdcfa338aa	Hedonists hmmmm I have to say that it is an interesting way of life but it seems to me that one would get bored with instant gratification all the time.

Hopefully you haven't left too many people in your life hurt also.|`|AA11521494	Hedonism is not a religion, it is a philosophy of enjoying as you please.  I relate totally to it as a Satanist - the big Satanist argument with god is that we should be allowed to enjoy all that life has to offer (within reason!) and god tries to stop that.  Now I come to think about it, I'm a hedonist with Satan thrown in.<br>  <br>  I wrote a review of the Satanic Bible last night, oddly enough - in summary, what it says in terms of ethics is pretty much hedonist, but it is wrong with regard to Satan as Anton LaVey believed He didn't exist.  Of course if you want to believe that, fine.|`|rg2qMxT5aa	If you read the bible,<br>  Jesus said<br>  He that loses his life for my sake shall find it<br>  <br>  yes there are lots to do in this world<br>  but nothing really matters in the end<br>  unless you have a meaningful relationship<br>  with Christ.<br>  ps- going to church isnt the main thing,<br>  Jesus said the Kingdom of God is found within,<br>  Luke 17:21|`|UinOWcMUaa	Hedonism is a type of philosophy for that the pleasure is an ultimate importance and the most important pursuit for the man. The name derives from the Greek word for "delight" (?δονισμ?? hēdonismos from ?δον? hēdonē "pleasure", a cognate of English sweet + suffix ισμ?? ismos "ism").<br>  <br>  Contents [hide]<br>  1 Basic concepts <br>  2 Predecessors <br>  3 Egoism <br>  <br>  Basic concepts<br>  The basic idea behind hedonistic thought is that pleasure is the only thing that is good for a person; indeed: the only good. This is often used as a justification for evaluating actions in terms of how much pleasure and how little pain (i.e. suffering) they produce. In very simple terms, a hedonist strives to maximize this net pleasure (pleasure minus pain). The nineteenth-century British philosophers John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham defended the ethical theory of utilitarianism, according to which we should perform whichever action is best for everyone. Conjoining hedonism, as a view as to what is good for people, to utilitarianism has the result that all action should be directed toward achieving the greatest amount of happiness for everyone. Though consistent in their pursuit of happiness, Bentham and Mill’s versions of hedonism differ. There are two somewhat basic schools of thought on hedonism:[1]<br>  <br>  <br>  Christianity (from the word Xριστ?? "Christ") is a monotheistic religion[1] centered on the life and teachings of Jesus as presented in the New Testament.[2]<br>  <br>  Adherents of Christianity, known as Christians,[3] believe that Jesus is the only begotten[4][5] Son of God and the Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Hebrew Bible (the part of scripture common to Christianity and Judaism). Christian theology claims that Jesus Christ is a teacher, the model of a virtuous life, the revealer of God, as well as an incarnation of God, and most importantly the savior of humanity who suffered, died, and was resurrected to bring about salvation from sin.[6] Christians maintain that Jesus ascended into heaven, and most denominations teach that Jesus will return to judge the living and the dead, granting everlasting life to his followers. Christians call the message of Jesus Christ the Gospel ("good news") and hence label the earliest written accounts of his ministry as gospels.<br>  <br>  <br>  Christianity is a realtionship with God -- Hedonist  is a realtionship with self pleasure...|`|6354f9b17eeb910a803f8ef20a4505afaa	The view of a Hedonist would be that "pleasure is more important than anything."  Do you truly believe this?<br>  <br>  I'm glad to hear that you are finally reading the Holy Bible.  God created us and He left us an instruction book, the Holy Bible.  I prefer King James Bible because I don't like the copyrights on a Bible.<br>  <br>  Faith comes by hearing and hearing the Word of God.  You are doing right by reading God's Word.  I think starting with the Book of John in the New Testament is a good first gospel to read.  Matthew, Mark, Luke and John are considered the 4 gospels of the Bible.  God says that His Word the Bible cannot be broken and all will be fulfilled that is written in it.<br>  <br>  To me, the greatest proof of God's word being truth is the Jews.  God said in the latter days that He would regather His people that He had scattered throughout the earth.  He said He'd make them a nation in one day, bring them back on wings of eagles and they'd speak their original language.  In 1948 the UN made Israel a nation in one day, they flew back on airplanes and regardless of what nation they come from and what language they are speaking, all citizens of Israel must learn Hebrew the National Language.  Amazing.  Greater even than this is the fulfillment of Scripture that Jesus fulfilled.  These fulfillments of prophesy are beyond all odds.  Only God could inspire the Holy Bible.  The Bible has never been wrong.  Today it has better news than the new media and its news is more accurate.<br>  <br>  Have a blessed afternoon and keep reading the Word of God. Remember one thing that you and I cannot be good enough to earn Salvation, because our Salvation is a free gift from God so no man can boast.  We all work out our Salvation with fear and trembling trying not to sin against Almighty God.  Not because of God, because believing in Him means our sins are forgiven, but we do not want to sin against God.  I've gotten to where I hate sin, because my sin took Christ to the Cross. Now, when God looks upon me He sees Jesus and I'm forgiven.   The Holy Spirit convicts me of sin and gradually removes sin from me.  It is a process that we go through, but what the Holy Spirit starts in us He is more than able to finish. The only righteousness in any of us is Christ Jesus.  Thank you Jesus!

yOK32PM9aa	Trying to do the right thing, and asking for help in doing it, is probably one of the smartest ways to live - so well done. My advice is to keep trying to be nice to people - it is a skill, and takes time to learn.  Try to forgive those who are nasty to you,without letting them harm you again - but don't try to get your own back. That way, you cut your losses and don't risk being seen as a nasty vengeful person, even though most of us have those feelings. You just have to learn through trial and error, as everyone is different.  Good luck!|`|ee65f538f085527a78cd622269657a19aa	I was a little confused by what you wrote.  You mention how you can communicate better with people, yet you talk about turning your back to people who are horrible to you.  I'm not sure what you want.  If you just want to be a better communicator, then listen to their conversations more then talking and show interest.   If you're just trying to deal with horrible people, I would say don't.  If someone is a real jerk, then cut them out of your life and move on. No one needs people like that.|`|ZUfZis1jaa	Write what you want to say on your forehead.  Like..."I think you are hot".

EmOnt7FIaa	You are afraid to be yourself, so you attempt to disguise your personality for the acceptance of others. I'm not trying to hurt your feelings but it's actually that simple. I think you should try to raise your self confidence a little bit. Just relax and go with the flow and if they don't approve of you, than let it be, because if they are negative than they have no business being in your life anyways. For the record, you were probably better off asking this in the Adolescent/Psychology or Friends Category.     Hope that helps|`|6Ow34Lokaa	As a child I spoke only Scots Gaelic and French Canadien.

Some people say I don't have accent. Some people notice it|`|GPznIhzMaa	I do the same thing! When I'm speaking to someone with a heavy New York accent, my New York accent comes out. Or if I'm speaking to someone with a thick Chinese accent, I let my Chinese accent slip out. At one of my old jobs, a British customer came up and asked me for a box, when I answered him, I heard myself speaking with a British accent! (I seriously did not do it intentionally.) But when I'm speaking to someone with no accent, I have no accent either.     It's not a problem at all. It's just an adaptability skill. If you want make your speech more consistent, just be mindful of your speech when you're in conversations.
slAhtXtKaa	No, it's always tough.|`|KEAfTavqaa	Yes it is much harder. 15 years ago things were so much simpler. I wouldn't know by experience because I was 2 years old, But my parents told me that it was much easier then, than now. They say it is much harder to get a job and maintain it. The music is more provocative now. Especially the music videos. Shows on TV keep getting more disgusting by the day. Take family guy for example. They talk about sex, drugs, alcohol, prostitution..etc. And KIDS watch this!!!! What are little kids suppose to learn from TV? They are funny shows I admit, but they should only be available after 12am so little kids wont watch it. The media is corrupting the innocence of little kids. It makes me really sad.|`|AU3mZG1zaa	Yes, absolutely! I think that mainly its because of the technology and the expectations by people have changed since everything is supposed to be done in a cooler way. Also, before parents had more control over their kids than now, kids and teenagers now trust their peers more than thier parents or relatives and who knows when your friends will ditch you because they would find other "cooler" people than you. I wish I was born 30 years ago, so I could have lived in a better environment|`|kQA7SbY9aa	No. Growing up is growing up...something that we all go through. But each era brings with it different influences (new technologies, political events, economic situations, music, movies, etc.). I do think that kids today seem to want to skip over their childhood and get into situations that they shouldn't be experiencing until they're much older.|`|e3bbea72940dc8ddb89cf1c33bdc265aaa	No - Its always been tough<br>  <br>  When I left school there was High unemployment and high interest rates and negative equity all round.<br>  <br>  When my dad left school he struggled and saved for everything. Everything he had was paid for outright without Credit cards, if he couldnt afford it he couldnt get it<br>  <br>  We have more possession, opportunities and comfort than ever before recession or not|`|d3A83djHaa	Not more difficult, but there are different challenges.  It will always be hard to grow up.|`|rifjjQ2laa	That depends on what part of the we are talking about.|`|ky3pQS4jaa	I think that it is all relevant. <br>     Today we have a lot more technology which gives us access to all kinds information. For example technology today has allowed us  to find more cures to disease, build safer cars, communicate with anyone easily around the world, and a lot more.<br>    However I think today we are faced with other challenges that were not as difficult to overcome 15 years ago. For example:Global warming has become more of an issue. Today we are responsible to live a little greener. Global warming is just one example of the  issues that might add more stress to our, already - faced paced lifestyles.   <br>   I believe it is all relevant that today we have more power and understanding about our world then we did 15 years ago; that this means we must take greater care of everything we do.<br>   15 years ago wasn't quite as convenient as today, nothing was laid out on the internet like a silver platter easy-to-use. And as whole important global issues were not addressed like they are today.|`|6UBSUzUIaa	Completely! People today don't have the direction or the guidance from the parents to not act like idiots. Not to mention the technological advances to constantly be in contact with someone. People need to go back to the old school and slow down. No one has human interaction anymore so therefore no intimacy. It's really sad. :(<br>  <br>  I wish I could go back 15 years ago. I miss my childhood. Born in '84.|`|YyiESOpFaa	yes, because now-a-days, it seems that everything is harder. our economy sucks, so it's harder to get a job and others are being laid off. also, I think that there is a lot more peer pressure.|`|G5Huk19Xaa	i think its difficult growing up at any time. there are ups and downs to any time period. and people have been raised differently, so they deal accordingly.|`|zsMQyHuZaa	everthing is so high.people say how the music has changed.gas prices vary.it's crazy .|`|15Uz3lO2aa	yes, because of the recession, mainly.
zz6phb8Oaa	The best way you can help your friend is to be there for her.... try to encourage her to get physiological help.... Unfortunately there isn't anything else you can do....She will leave him when she's had enough, when she's ready.... If she leaves him before she's ready she'll just end up going back... and she probably thinks she can change him... which isn't gonna happen, He has to want to change for that to happen. I can say that because I was in an abusive relationship for 8 years...  Finally when I'd had enough I walked away.....

There are broadly three uses for tarot cards.<br>  <br>  The earliest and intended use for tarot is for playing card games. The fifth suit of picture cards took as its theme a Christian triumph procession, hence the cards' early name of trionfi, meaning triumphs and from which we get our word trump. It was the invention of tarot that marked the invention of trumps in card games. Anyway, trivia aside, these games are still played throughout continental Europe today, though the cards used will vary with the games played. Most countries use a French suited tarot pack (the French Jeu de Tarot and the Austrian Tarock), while Italy, Sicily and Switzerland still use the old Italian designs.<br>  <br>  The second and to English speakers the more familiar use is for divination or fortune telling. This has it's origins in late 18th century France when Parisian occultist Antoine Court de Gebelin published a belief that the cards were Egyptian in origin (a discredited belief, even among most occultists). Until the early 20th century, the Marseilles pattern, sticking mostly to the Italian designs, was used for divination. However, with the publication of a pack known as the Rider-Waite-Smith (or RWS), this changed. The new pack illustrated all of the pip cards with images corresponding to their meaning in fortune telling and most modern occult tarots are still based upon these designs and interpretations. I don't believe that fortune telling is possible but if I had to make a suggestion, this would be it.<br>  <br>  The third use is related to the occultist theories but has been gaining in popularity, particularly I think, over the last 10 years or so. Basically, this consists of seeing the cards as representing a set of spiritual beliefs and in that context using their images for meditation. This is not as controversial as divination and, given that the cards have a Christian origin, it shouldn't offend the more conservative religious folk. For this purpose, the right choice can only be the pack that best suits your beliefs and perception of the world.<br>  <br>  If you are looking to try the games, I would suggest these sites for the rules and some pack reviews:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tarocchino.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tarocchino.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pagat.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pagat.com</a><br>  <br>  and to buy packs, I would suggest if you are in the States:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tarobearslair.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tarobearslair.com</a><br>  <br>  or in Europe:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.playingcardsales.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.playingcardsales.com</a><br>  <br>  If you are interested in divination or meditative use, then take a look at the reviews at this site, which also has links to stores where you can buy them:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aeclectic.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.aeclectic.net</a>|`|eb71d539c6860290e80bdaa4253a2f87aa	The "International Icon Tarot" is the best beginner's tarot deck I have come across. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/international-icon/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/int...</a>|`|ouXrNitMaa	Tarot Cards for Dummies ?<br>  I'd say check the interweb thingy.|`|6755d6124814f8a889ed9508dc8b6638aa	The best set for you is the one that seems to draw you to them...the ones you like the most...the ones you feel most comfortable with.

It generally believed to have arisen when a publicity stunt by the Carpenters' Guild of Ancient Israel got out of hand. God has no affiliation with this organization and when he found out his son Jesus had helped the Carpenters he gave him a good spanking. By then however it was too late as the Italians had gotten hold of it and begun to take the joke seriously. Interestingly enough, nobody questions the worshiping of a zombie. <br>  <br>  Christianity is one of the most common forms of the disease Religion. Symptoms of the virus include starving yourself until you pray to your food, having delusions that a superhuman being created the entire ******* universe, smiling like an asshole, giving away money to money depositories (churches) to make even bigger depositories, feelings of guilt, semen back-up, no apparent attraction to the opposite sex, no sense of humor, and AIDS. <br>  <br>  In summary, Christianity can be defined as the belief that a cosmic Jewish zombie can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him that you accept him as your master, so he can remove an evil force from your soul that is present in humanity because a rib-woman was convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree.

FGcwxZz0aa	This is the oficial Church teaching from the CCC:    The Catechism of the Catholic Church states: "The teaching of the Church affirms the existence of hell and its eternity. Immediately after death the souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin descend into hell, where they suffer the punishments of hell, eternal fire. The chief punishment of hell is eternal separation from God, in whom alone man can possess the life and happiness for which he was created and for which he longs" (CCC 1035).       In Christ  Fr.

He did not change any doctrine.  A link to the complete text of those audiences is below.    Benedict XVI is a brilliant theologian and also a wise and compassionate pastor, two traits one doesn't often find in a single bishop.  His faith, teaching, and pastoral care are all grounded in a profound love for Christ and His Church.  We were blessed to have John Paul II, and are equally blessed to have Benedict.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	No.     No one knows exactly what hell will be like. But is has always been thought that the greatest pain will be separation from God. Humanity has never been truly separated from God. Not believing in Him does not truly separate you, but once the time has ended and God withdraws himself from those who chose to reject him, they will find out.     But a pope defining, and clarifying things is not the same as changing doctrine or dogma. No pope has ever changed dogma or doctrine, they have only been clarified.     I do like Benedicit. I think he is a wonderful pope and defender of the faith.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	That I don't know but John Henry Newman the brilliant Catholic convert often pointed out that the teaching of Hell is essentially that it is the torment of knowing you are eternally separated and it is your fault.

So, just in your average daily life, almost everything is a compromise (heck, I'd love to each fried chicken and chocolate sundaes all the time but my body can't handle it anymore so I have to watch what I eat, another compromise).  It just goes on and on.  In the US, you're "free" to be yourself...as long as it doesn't interfere with everyone.  You have "free speech" except you can't say racial slurs and other denigrating things for which you can get arrested.

8yaYafBAaa	For people who say that God can do anything or yes he did, for us, You must have the lowest Idea about God. Do you forget that No one has the right to be invoked, supplicated, prayed to, or shown any act of worship, but God alone.  God alone is the Almighty, the Creator, the Sovereign, and the Sustainer of everything in the whole universe. He manages all affairs. He stands in need of none of His creatures, and all His creatures depend on Him for all that they need. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, and the All-Knowing. In a perfect manner, His knowledge encompasses all things, the open and the secret, and the public and the private. He knows what has happened, what will happen, and how it will happen. No affair occurs in the whole world except by His will. Whatever He wills is, and whatever He does not will is not and will never be. His will is above the will of all the creatures. He has power over all things, and He is able to do everything. He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, and the Most Beneficent.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	NO, but Jesus is True God and True Man.

It sounds like they have sin to overcome, and maybe the fact that they have not overcome it, it is making them overzealous and judgmental of others.

His prayers would be full of tears and terror.

There are plenty of hypocrites in this world, but it isn't my job to ferret them out and hold them up for judgment.  That would make me one of them.
5OucqEzFaa	Psalm 145:3 gives us an insight: 'Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; his greatness no-one can fathom.'    Mere mortals are incapable of grasping the holiness, the sovereignty, the power and the majesty of God Almighty. Yes, we can learn about God by reading his holy word, by prayer and meditation, but we will never be able to fully comprehend his glory in this life.    This scripture in Isaiah reminds us of how puny we are and is a warning not to attempt to second guess God.  Whenever I read or hear about men applying their reason and their logic to interpretation of God's holy word, I am reminded of this scripture.    There are some people who think they can restrict God, Christ Jesus and the Holy Spirit to their own human concepts and who have even gone so far as to change scripture to fit in with their theology. They prefer to believe the word of men rather than accept what God says.|`|EFdNYdNhaa	It means GOD SEES THE BIG PICTURE from the perspective of Eternity and INFINITE UNDERSTANDING.

He's more intelligent than us and will always be that way. But that doesn't mean that we aren't smart.Every one of us is a smart human being, we're just influenced by the people around us that make us choose badly. Nobody is a failure, the things that influence them make them one, or the events that happened in the past. God has love for everybody no matter what they have done or what they think they are, whereas most people hate others or have anger towards them. God forgives when most people do not. Likewise, people have a very hard time forgiving than others. God sees murder as the same as lying. As you can see his thoughts and ways are different. He created us, you would think that He is much different than us. Some people treat God as a human figure but He is not set up that way.He is an all-power figure. But, Jesus is a man and he did miracles THROUGH God. When people are reading scriptures they can get different things out of it than others, depending on their situation and what they are going through. I hope this helped. Let me know if you need any other help with scriptures.|`|6Q4xh4F1aa	I think He is saying that although He made humans in His image, we are short sighted and not as perceptive as He is.

Man best efforts were to go to the moon,computers that can't do what a virus can.    God loves all people and wants all to receive salvation and be with Him.

It's just that we don't do it as perfectly as He does nor to the degree that He does.    I strongly disagree with those who say that these verses mean that "Gods thoughts and wisdom FAR exceed anything we could even imagine or have ever seen or thought of" or similar expressions. Given the context of the entire 55th chapter of Isaiah, one can clearly see that God is OFFERING greater wisdom to us if we come to Him (well, at least that was His offer to the Israelites)! These two verses are His way of saying "You know good and well I'm wiser than you people!" He is saying that He will make us wiser if we listen to Him.     He is God, a supernatural being; we are human, only a physical "replica" of what God is. God is Love; we express and feel love. We're more like God than people give us credit for. He's just better!|`|VxTKNbJRaa	Isaiah 55:  8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.  9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.    Humans are not able to comprehend the totality of God Almighty.  All of God's thoughts and ways are beyond our comprehension. God through the Holy Spirit communicates to us in a way we can understand.    These verses apply to all of the bible.

Your premise would be correct IF you were to define truth and unity. I suspect you have a completely different meaning than I do. I have no interest in the link, but if you mean that truth=your truth about God, then you are welcome to unify with yourself. My truth does not include most of the things that the Christians on this site take for granted.     Unity is not strictlly necessary. What we DO need is to behave like brothers and sisters, ADULT brothers and sisters. We need to respect each other's differences and similarities.    When I bless water for the OCL communion rite, (not Christian in form) the words used say a lot:    I bless this water in the name of All The Powers That Now Exist (meaning whatever names for Deity you wish to acknowledge), that it might draw us together in our common goals and wash away the harm caused by our differences.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Impossible.|`|AA11002471	Not possible.|`|AA12288361	NO!!! Ecumenism is not the way to unite mankind.    GOD bless|`|93aY6WzAaa	No. Because without Truth there is no love to bring about unity.|`|QVO9b0a8aa	Unity without truth?    Well yeah. Just look at the church. All the people in a community go to the same church, even though it's preaching nonsense.|`|01b75bbcd20c3e82e1a4500548e5dd11aa	Would you join with me and those who believe as I do, would you follow our truth for the sake of unity?    Or must it only be YOUR truth that everyone must follow.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I 'm not clicking on that lest my initial good opinion of your question evaporate .    Truth is the best source of unity, I think. But that means that the best APPROACH is seeking truth, and that is what is lacking. Y!A questioners tend to ask questions with a mean, even disrespectful, tone, almost never say 'thanks' or 'didn't think of that' or 'good point'.     How are we going to get better if we don't follow the basic rules of enquiry     1) Let the plaintiff make his case and the defendant his case.   2) Give citations when making claims  3) Go to the horse's mouth. When discussing Catholicism, go to the catechism or the Catholic Encyclopedia   4) Probably the biggest  : Allow that what you don't know may still yet be true.  How many posts about the existence of God just plain say, well, I don't see it so it can't be so.      My favorite quote on the topic :  There are not more than 100 people in the world who truly hate the Catholic Church, but there are millions who hate what they perceive to be the Catholic Church.  Bishop Sheen|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Impossible!  (Jesus IS The Truth!)  |`|315e05cc268b43fe093093a9e96280b8aa	Unity without Jesus' truth is not possible, no.|`|799756bd4c88f2ce87a508802ca1e9cdaa	Oh yes it is possible as it will happen to all the people who worship the AntiChrist in the tribulation.
3uwYVJ8caa	Most are definitely a joke.  Alot of youth group leaders are wolves in sheeps clothing and parents are oblivious to it. I don't think Jesus was in a "youth group". At the age of twelve He was teaching in the temple. I think this is to be an example for us and demonstrates that twelve year old young men should have enough knowledge at this age to teach. But our culture dismisses the teen years as a time to "just have fun" and further hinders their spiritual growth and maturity by saying "they're just kids". Most twelve year olds I know can't even say the books of the Bible. Parents need to be the ones teaching their children, but instead most depend on the church to do it. It's NOT THE CHURCH'S JOB, it's the PARENTS' JOB! I teach Sunday School classes for 2 and 3 year olds and I bet they know more than the average teenager! And it's not because of what I do in class, it is what the parents are doing at home the other 6 days of the week. Sunday School is just a SUPPLEMENT. Also, I do not see anywhere in scripture where there is exclusive age segregation among the church. This is a relatively new thing and limited to the American culture.(look up the Sunday School Movement for a history about how this came into existence) I'm not talking about having specific classes/activities geared toward certain needs and ages, I'm talking about this attitude that the youth is "too cool" to be around elders and there is an extreme gap between relationships of the young and aged.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	I think they are just good pick up places.|`|tManvxfQaa	Most just like the rest of the churches are just social gatherings    They go to church they listen and play music some you can hear a pin drop in some its so loud you cant even think much less pray and others just go feel some goose bumps and jump around and do all sorts of things , then when its all over they go out for pizza and or to watch the game..etc etc etc...    Very Few have the Spirit of God among them , much less in them...  its sad......but its the truth    I can remember when going to church they went all day and some way into the next day and when they sought God they stayed until God moved among them and in them....that is a rare event now days in most churches....if anyone sermon lasts more then 30 minutes people complain and wont go back.....

True, many of the youths today NON-CHRISTIAN and CHRISTIAN face many obstacles and pitfalls...

Exd 32:33 And the lord said unto Moses, whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I BLOT out of my book.     Num 5:23 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall BLOT [them] out with the bitter water:     Deu 9:14 Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and BLOT out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.     Deu 29:20 The lord will not spare him, but then the anger of the lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the lord shall BLOT out his name from under heaven.

When someone comes to the LORD, their name is entered into the Book of Life. However, when one backslides it can be erased.

PoxcQk5Gaa	One of the greatest obstacles to true Christianity is false Christianity. The "Christian" left gives geunine Christianity a black mark because it is almost entirely pagan but just sprinkles a little superficial Jesus on top. They are hedonistic and on the side of humanism.  They care nothing for the truth and despise what the scriptures actually declare about life and living.  There can be no such thing as a politically or socially liberal Christian--it is a complete oxymoron, and I sincerely wish they would remove the name "Christian" from their profile and proclaim their paganism openly because that's where they belong--in the pagan world doing pagan things with pagan people.

Honestly, it's not worth learning a language for somebody, mainly because if you buy books or take language courses on a language, than it is more than likely take you a long time to learn those languages (especially if it's at school, School Language Programs last 4-5 years in my state), and many relationships don't last that long so you would probably be just wasting your time.

One thing that the husband and wife do have to do is recite Koranic verses (usually in front of an Imam) to solemnize the marriage covenant.    I actually went to a wedding once where the Jewish husband converted to Islam minutes before taking the wedding vows with his Bangladeshi-American bride.  That aspect of it is really fast.    But the cultural aspects of the wedding can vary, with the tux-and-gown combination in Western cultures, Indian-type weddings, lavish Indonesian weddings, or simple Gulf Arab weddings where the husband and wife don't even see each other on the wedding night and the tribal sheiks sign marriage documents on behalf of the newlyweds.

GtazNrplaa	Hii Tara.  I really don't think you can blame religion for child abuse unless it is inscribed into the law of that particular religion. I think it is one of those human instincts and traits which is carried forward from one generation to another. Most of it all derives from tribal and kinship traditions in the first place. Why are people so evil against each other is another. Is it what is learnt through early childhood when exposed to this awful human behaviour from adults.

The bible was written from a culture that saw children (and women) as property.  The bible mentions parent-child relationships in the 10 commandments, but only as to "children respect your parents" and nothing about how parents are to behave to the children.  The bible also gives advice about how to sell your daughter into sexual slavery and says that disobedient sons should be stoned to death at the city gates.    I agree with you that it's terrible and sad.|`|GkH5NoFyaa	It is the structure of the religion. All religions that I know of teach their members, or "followers" to listen to everything the leaders tell them, obey what they tell them to do. Unfortunately when the leaders of various religions become wealthy, as most religious leaders do, the money and being surrounded by "yes" people, the leaders begin to believe that they can do anything they want. And then they do, including abusing children (why must they always abuse them if they love them?), get caught, and cry on the camera begging forgiveness.

Don't listen to that guy who says the Jewish worship the devil. He's a Jew hater. And his arguments are baseless.|`|AA11640108	God.  You know, ????  Yaweh
g8jHYetnaa	It is the way people interpret the Bible.  Some people pick and choose what they like in the Bible and ignore the stuff they don't like.  This is why there is separation between Christians and they tend to disagree|`|RGe6Et0Xaa	1) I know that Evangelicals and fundamentalists just assume that all Christians are entirely dependent on the Bible as the sole revelation of God to man, but that is actually the minority opinion. Most Christians rely on far more than just the Bible, and place a greater emphasis on ecclesiastical tradition. Most educated Christians, Christian scholars, and Christian seminaries do not advocate the infallibility of Scripture in the first place.    2) The Bible is silent on many issues that were not particularly relevant to ancient authors. Early Christians knew whether you were once saved always saved, and saw no need to write the "answer" to that question in the Bible. It has only become relevant since the Baptists started using the phrase "once saved always saved" a few decades ago.|`|Wng05H8uaa	I think because even though we all read the Bible we all have our own opinions and experiences that shape our opinions.

But did you miss this one :      Climate change has a firm grip  Researchers say that even if nations can get carbon dioxide levels under control, it would take 1,000 years or longer for the climate changes already triggered to be reversed.  By Thomas H. Maugh II  January 27, 2009  Even if by some miracle the nations of the world could bring carbon dioxide levels back to those of the pre-industrial era, it would still take 1,000 years or longer for the climate changes already triggered to be reversed, scientists said Monday.    The gas already here and the heat that has been absorbed by the ocean will exert their effects for centuries, according to an analysis published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.    =================    So what are you asking us to do ?

8cde047a2197080a0f253d0aeebe83d1aa	If you're male and you like female feet, you're usually straight.  How on earth would it make a male gay to like feet of the opposite sex?  Do you know what "gay" means?  I'm guessing no, so I'll tell you.  It means you like the same sex.  No matter what part of the female you like, she's still the opposite sex.    It may be possible, however, to be male, like women and not men, and yet like male feet.  If that sounds confusing, that's because it is.  But sure enough, questions do pop up on here from men who like male feet yet swear they like women and not men.  So the answer would be "it depends."  Well, more accurately, the answer would be that a foot fetish doesn't necessarily have anything to do with your sexual orientation.  But more often than not, straight men will like female feet, and gay men will like male feet.    Also, there are three letters in the words "are" and "you."  Please get it right next time.

I don't know what is working or if it is a combination, but I don't ever discount anything.  You can't underestimate the power of a person's outlook and this man feels he can do anything with God and the rest of us who are praying for him.  So, it's fine if that study says it doesn't work.  It probably doesn't in some cases.

This person asked why prayer doesn't work; I backed up my claims with *The Bible*.    You on the other hand you completely ignore the Bible, Moses and the prophets, all miracles that occur these days, every single type of argument for God, yet you are still on the leap of faith that God doesn't exist.    ----edit----    "And yet jesus said all prayers will be heard and answered. Interesting isn't it? More biblical contradiction? Perhaps."    Are you serious? You're taking pieces of the Bible and criticizing it, without looking at it as a whole. Anyone can pick out bits and pieces of something, but can be wrong.

He will tell you that He raised Jesus from the dead and if you confess him as Lord, you will be reborn.But if you have unbelief in your heart, as soon asa he left you would challenge everything he said and no faith would come from it.       But if you believe without seeing, then you have to believe IN THE HEART and that is far more sure than seeing with these eyes.Now you believe with your spirit man, and nothing can ever take that away from you.Or you can be like Thomas, and call Jesus a liar . Jesus had already told all those fellas that after three days he would be raisewd from the dead. But Thomas didn't believe Jesus . When Jesus came and told him to touch his wounds, he called Thomas FAITHLESS, no faith at all.I choose not to be called faithless by Jesus.

Your question only thinly masks that you think  1) Jesus was not True God and True Man, and  2) That you somehow think everyone who lived at Jesus' time was out of the ordinary, not real people !!    Here is my attitude about that :  But a voice came from the cloud above: "This is my Son, the Beloved. Listen to him." (Mt 17:5; Mk 9:7)  St John of the Cross said that God was more or less saying: "If I have already told you all things in my Word, my Son, and if I have no other word, what answer or revelation can I now make that would surpass this? Fasten your eyes on him alone because in him I have spoken and revealed all and in him you will discover even more than you ask for and desire  I have already spoken, answered, manifested, and revealed to you by giving him to you as a brother, companion, master, ransom, and reward ...If I spoke before [through priests and prophets in the Old Testament] it was to promise Christ ... [But if people asked God to speak to them now or ask for visions] they would offend my beloved Son deeply because they would be obliging him to become incarnate and undergo his life and death again.  You will not find anything to ask or desire of me through revelations and visions.  Behold him well, for in him you will uncover all of these already made and given, and many more  My Apostle proclaimed this in writing to the Colossians: In the Son of God are hidden all the treasures of the wisdom and knowledge of God (Col 2:3)."     St John of the Cross concludes: "Anyone wanting to get something in a supernatural way would, as it were, be accusing God of not having given us in his Son all that is required. (The Ascent of Mt Carmel, Bk 2, ch. 22.)|`|tl2pMkOcaa	Christians will try to tell you that God "has already done it" via, BIBLE, Holy Spirit, or Jesus...    But you know, as well as I do that THAT is just a bunch of MALARKEY!    If God wanted people to be "saved" - if our "loving" father really,l really cared for our eternal souls -     if victory over SATAN were truly complete....    If Hell is truly the outcome for non-believers...    God could manifest Himself in a real way (Moses, Abraham, Paul, Joseph Smith, Mohammad, etc, etc...) to EACH ONE!    But He obviously does not - instead, GOD unreasonably expects men to believe ancient tales from ancient people who claimed to have had this or that vision....    We must believe ridiculous stories and rationalize (brainwash) our reality to convince ourselves that we - indeed - KNOW GOD - in order for men to escape judgment and Hell.    This happens all the time, because self-delusion is so very, very, very easy (especially when you WANT to believe A, B, or C.)    It is the courageous who refuse to believe outlandish claims - EVEN when those claims say that one will suffer for not believing them.|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	God already did, that was Jesus Christ, but look what happened then, He got hung on a cross.

I am a green/kitchen type pagan who pratices her faith(s) alone. . . I do not follow any strict rituals at this moment in time. . . er. . . something compelling. . . it's what I believe. . . not much more to it really. I sat down one day and was tired of all my questions about religion never really being answered. . . so I figured from that day on I'd have to go dig the answers for myself.     I was raised christian and my parents are very "hard core" christians.    Edit: Most of my friends are christians, BUT a good deal of them have other pagan friends/family members  that they've known before me, so it's not really as bad as it seems. I have had pagan friends in the past, and I have a few here and there, but  I don't base my friendship on religion, I base it on who they are as a person.

I continued my studies and became very interested.    I also know many adult pagans. They have been very supportive of me. One of them is a friend of our family.

u6K5TtRlaa	You need to sit him down and talk about this, about the boundaries and exclusivity of the relationship. You said you "caught" him giving out his number? If he was trying to do it discreetly, that's definitely an offense against the sanctity of your relationship. Have you told him that crosses the line? And how did he respond? If that's not something you're going to tolerate in your relationship, then tell him so and come to an agreement. Just because he hasn't slept with anyone doesn't mean that he's not cheating on you. Cheating isn't just sex but also the emotional involvement you give to another person that should be reserved to your partner. If he's flirting with other guys and knows you're not comfortable with that (I've had relationships where we would flirt with other guys, but just for sport, and we understood where all the lines were drawn), then he's not someone you need to be hanging around.    Have a good talk to him, maybe write out your concerns and ideas beforehand, listen to his response, and if you're still not comfortable with him, then he's not someone you need to hang around. What it comes down to is your comfort, that's what a relationship is about, and if you're not getting that, go and find it someplace else, without him. Don't make your mind up about him before you have your talk, but don't compromise your comfort.    Hope that helps!|`|iwNYcerfaa	You need to ask yourself. Are you happy with the way he is treating you? Does he get upset and argumentative when you try talking to him about your concerns?|`|Y9GdwvnWaa	have you talk to him about this? because that is defitnetly not ok. i would defitnetly have to have a heart to heart talk. and then maybe re-evaluate the relationship because you shouldnt have to deal with an unfaithful person. I know you said he hasnt slept with anyone yet, but that doesnt mean he wont, or you just havent caught him!
MM5iGrnIaa	I am a Christian, and this is how I look at it.    I will not fight for a homosexual's right to marry another homosexual.  However, I will not fight to take away any right of a homosexual.  If it does become legal, it is because God allowed it to happen.  If it does not become legal, it is because God allowed it to not happen.    Why will I not support homosexual marriage?    Because that would go against everything I believe in, and I do not believe homosexuality to be natural; I thought that before I became Christian.    Why will I not fight to take away a homosexual's right to marry?    I do not believe in fighting to take away a right that someone may believe they have. I will also pray that God works through our government to do his will.    Edit:    At one time, drinking was illegal period, but violence increased so much afterward that they went ahead and made it legal; Making alcoholic illegal gave birth to the first crime families.    Note: I am not suggesting that homosexuals become violent in order to achieve their goals.  I am appalled at how far people will go to continue drinking and smoking;  I hope homosexuals don't turn to that.|`|2uiuOpSvaa	First, there are plenty of Christians who do not think gay marriage should be illegal.  I agree with them.    Those who still believe it should illegal generally think society's laws should conform with traditions from biblical times.  This, of course, has caused conflicts for centuries: slavery, interracial marriage, the existence (not to mention the marriage) of gay people, evolution and science in general.  Usually the Christians come around about a century after the rest of society has changed its laws.|`|znt2s3sMaa	It's a sin against God, plain and simple.    I used to be gay myself, and I gave up that lifestyle to follow God's will.    Think about STD's and Aids....don't you think God put those diseases out there as a WARNING?     If He approved of homosexuality and promiscuity and adultery, etc....then He would not have allowed those diseases to happen.    Marriage is to be between a man and a woman, according to the Bible.  Are there any other religions that say that homosexual marriages are a good thing?|`|yZT7m5Qxaa	Gay marriage, it's wrong!!!!.

READ THE Bible the answer is in their.|`|EQUEuXIjaa	Because in the Bible, it more or less says that homosexuality is an abomination.|`|yMqWvG8naa	Because it says so in a 2000 year old book a few lines away from where it also says that eating shellfish is an abomination, and that we should stone our disobedient children.    Because of this, they feel the need to protect the "sanctity of marriage" despite the fact that marriage (as it existed in the biblical sense) was basically a contract by which a man would sell his daughter to another man.     The fact is that there are no logically valid secular reasons to oppose gay marriage.    It's natural:  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15750604/    It doesn't hurt anyone and it doesn't infringe upon anyone else's rights.    And according to the constitution, we're all entitled to equal rights..    Anyone who opposes gay rights places themselves in direct opposition to the constitution and the principles that this country was founded upon.|`|HRvPoQzKaa	The bible says homos are bad people and they are doomed to hell.

My job on earth is to love God and to love my neighbor as myself, not cast judgment on others.    Jesus hung out with the "sinful" people.. the people that society looked down on. I can't image Him in a million years passing laws against gay people. I imagine Him hanging out with gay people and being their friend. So that's what I aim to do.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Uh,,  well since 'gay marriages' have absolutely Nothing to do with The Lord God anyway and it is this 'worldly system',,, knock yourself out and continue to Justify SIN all you want.

Therefore, the 'sanctity' of marriage should not be permitted to sinners.|`|KjYxk1S2aa	It's a basic Christian belief, to my understanding, that marriage between a man and a woman is sanctioned of God. In the bible, it does not condone homosexuality, and that can be another reason.    I don't thinks all Christians are against it. A lot of them are, but not all of them.|`|qhFGj6lHaa	Its in both the old and NEW testament that homosexuality is immoral|`|fbrdhY1aaa	It IS illegal, at least where I'm from.  Christians view homosexual acts as sins.  They won't condone something that they believe is sinful.      The way I see it, if homosexuals want to get married bad enough, they need to start taking it up with their state governments and stop complaining about the votes of people who don't find their lifestyle to their liking.  The government is the one that decides what gets voted on, and what doesn't.  If they're still not allowed to get married, it's because the "higher-ups" are puting it to a vote instead of viewing it as a right.|`|AA12383652	Here is my main reason.    I dont want any other family unit besides that of a mother and a father idealized in our society.    There are situations that happen where people are forced to be single parents beyond their own bad decisions.  They shouldnt be looked down on.  This is not what I mean, however, there is a standard that you can hold up in society as ideal that should be and that is a child being raised in a home with both a loving mother AND father.    Look at what has happened in the last 50-60 years since single parenthood has been glorified and traditional families have pretty much been tossed as disposable.     Can a child be raise ok and be just fine in a single parent or homosexual family, yes.  Should that be the standard we set as ideal or what we want to glorify in our society?  No.    Once something is legitamized and culturally in our faces (like tv, movies, etc) it becomes perfectly acceptable as the norm.  We dont need yet another thing tearing down the family unit by which our entire next generation has been raised and taught their morality and value system since the start of our society.    This is a very big societal change in how the next generation views the concept of the family and what is normal and what should be the ideal.  Its one more thing, on top of what has already been ripping it apart, that just says a mother and a father is just no longer important in our society anymore.    When you say that a child does not need a mother and a father or that they are just as good if not better with just one kind of parent then it pretty much makes a statement that we no longer, in our society, need BOTH roles of mother and father.    I dont want those roles taken out of society or made less important.|`|1NtwIeLyaa	If you're trying to compare drunkenness to homosexuality and then tack marriage onto it, you're in a real muddle, my friend.  God never said that drunks can't marry.  He only said that drunkenness is a sin.  He also made it clear that He created man and woman for specific reasons and those reasons are for reproduction.  Two men, or two women, cannot reproduce without artificial means.  God has made it quite clear that 2 men lying together like a man and woman, are an abomination.  What else needs to be said about it.    Blessings,    Harmony|`|01b75bbcd20c3e82e1a4500548e5dd11aa	Ever notice that it's the Christians that think about gay sex more than those that actually participate in the act?

Ever notice that it's Christians that will divorce, cheat and abuse their spouses, but a loving same-sex couple together for over 50 years is an abomination?    Ever notice that Christians wish to legislate everyone else's lives, but balk when laws regulate theirs, as if theirs were shining examples of perfection?

If we are going to do it for one group why not the others as well? Where is the Arabic, the French, the Laotian, the Vietnamese, the Indian. . .  they all come here and must assimilate. When I visit Mexico, or any country where another language prevails, I make an effort! I once spent several months in South Africa for work and made an effort to learn at least conversational Afrikaans - it wasn't easy, people laughed - Often - but they thought it was great that even though they could speak English I showed them and their country respect and tried.    Edit - Raspberry, no one is implying that immigrants aren't entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I love that this country is a melange of everything - but it was founded by the English  and guess what they spoke? No disrespect to anyone of Hispanic/Latino descent - you can retain and be proud of your culture and still assimilate.|`|bIouq64Oaa	If you want to prevail with the common misconception that Americans are so much higher up on the totem pole than anyone else (especially people who speak different languages - because heaven forbid anyone disagree with us), then yes, certainly we should remove that little tiny flag and inconvenience innumerable people simply because "they don't belong in our country."    If, however, we are laboring under the idea that (I quote from the Declaration of Independence), "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness," then it makes perfect sense that people who are better off in our country than their own may definitely stay here. Would we go against one of the most influential documents in American history?|`|AA10948829	Yep. It sure is stupid to cater to a large group of people who don't have perfect English and would feel more comfortable asking a question in Spanish pertaining to a country they live in rather than in English where they'll be made fun of, told to learn English in order to live here, and not understand the entirety of answers or to Spain or Mexico where the answers will be "I don't know, I don't live in the USA."    Quit being an ignorant prick and get over yourselves. English is not an easy thing to learn and for you to assume that everyone who uses the Spanish-speaking American Y!A to be just some "dirty foreigner" who can't take the time to learn an entire language filled with rules and exceptions that DON'T MAKE SENSE just shows how much of a moron you truly are.|`|bLahP9Ivaa	You are one arrogant prick! The US took large areas with force from Mexico including California, Texas, Arizona an New Mexico. Spanish speaking people have lived here for hundreds of years before the USA were founded. So don't come and speak of "real" Americans. In fact there is no law that  states that English is the official language of the US.|`|l2qtG4yfaa	It doesn't really matter dude, relax. There is still an English site. We can't hide from the fact that Spanish is growing here, even if Yahoo! didn't include it, the issue would still be there. I agree they should learn English, but Yahoo excluding the Spanish site wouldn't make them learn English, and it takes awhile to learn. Yahoo is trying to make money, the more advertisements, the more users, the better for them.    Think about the other countries on here too.  Like Yahoo! India is in English when only 8% of the population can speak English as a second language. So the other 92% can't even understand.  Same goes for Yahoo! Malaysia  Their site is in English, when the official language is Malay.  I think they would like a site in their language.    Or    Arab users who don't even have a Yahoo! site in Arabic.  ______________________________________...    Yes, in order to become a citizen you have to pass the English test. But that test does not mean you are fluent. The test is on a intermediate level, which would less than conversational or conversational depending on the person. But not fluent. They would feel a lot more comfortable in Spanish. But remember if they are a senior citizen or mentally handicap then they do not have to learn, for obvious reasons.  ____________________________________    Also do not forget Puerto Rico, which is a U.S. territory who's main language is Spanish.  That site is directed at them too.    I understand what you are saying bro, but it doesn't hurt us to have the site a site in Spanish.  I agree with you that we need to fix border issues, to stop illegal immigration, and if they do come over they should learn English. But think about it, if they cross the border illegally why would they bother learning English when we have a lot of things in Spanish now? There is no real initiave for them to learn when there plan isn't to become an American, they just want to get money for their family and possibly go back.  ______________________________________...    You guys, I seriously don't think he is a hate monger trying to impose English. Imagine if 3 million Americans go to say, Japan, and do not learn Japanese at all.  Would the Japanese be hate mongers if they said these 3 million Americans should learn Japanese? No. Japanese isn't official there either, it is the de facto language. The thing is, is that I believe that immigrants should learn the language of the country they are going to. This goes for every country, it is respecting that country. But the natives need to learn that it takes time to learn it too. I don't think the poster has a problem with immigrants, he has a problem with immigrants who do not bother learning the language. Which I have a problem with too, for any country not just America. If 4 million british men go to Mexico, they should learn Spanish even if there are signs there in English. Everyone needs to respect other people's culture and language, especially if they are the immigrant.|`|fOYp0gGqaa	Wow! I never noticed that till you pointed it out! That's jacked up.... This type of thing is a pet peeve for a lot of people, myself included. I shouldn't have to "Marko el numero dos" in every phone call I make. Drives me nuts.     It's not just me either. My exes parents were off the boat German. Arrived at Ellis Island, learned English, got jobs, and made lives for themselves. It always ticked them off to see everything catered to Mexicans who don't want to learn English. No one offered to print everything in half German for them! They had to assimilate.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Nothing at all is wrong with it.    How does the second flag HURT you?    Get a grip.    It's not true that early immigrants always learned English; many didn't, but their kids did.    So-called Mexicans have been living where they live longer than Whites have.    What's stupid is being a hate-monger who wants to impose their language on everyone else. Not everyone retains the ability to learn new languages into adult-hood.

There's also one other group, they're "so called religious people", you know, those who only follow a "social gospel" or the teachings of some false prophet rather than the teachings of Christ.    Friends do you really "know" Christ as your Savior or do you just "know OF Him",    IF YOU DON'T KNOW CHRIST AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR REPENT & BELIEVE IN HIM FOR SALVATION AS HE'S SOON COMING BACK!!!|`|Y6odIQgJaa	Yes, they will be riding dinosaurs and in particular, flying on teradactyls.    They will be very scared dudes.|`|UVGPIUWYaa	What is "Satan's Army of Darkness"? I never heard of it before. lol|`|Uj9cLwbpaa	A bunch of Goths.|`|XWwZwHjWaa	his demons are in it.|`|FmbwIbtzaa	Satan, Lucifer's Lieutenant has been imprisoned for a long time now waiting their final adjudication and sentencing of oblivion.  You find it in Scripture when Jesus acting though His Universal Sovereign Authority said Satan get behind me.    Note:  The Son of Man was confident of success, and he knew that his triumph on your world would forever settle the status of his agelong enemies, not only in Satania but also in the other two systems where sin had entered. There was survival for mortals and security for angels when your Master, in reply to the Lucifer proposals, calmly and with divine assurance replied, "Get you behind me, Satan." That was, in principle, the real end of the Lucifer rebellion. True, the Uversa tribunals have not yet rendered the executive decision regarding the  appeal of Gabriel praying for the destruction of the rebels, but such a decree will, no doubt, be forthcoming in the fullness of time since the first step in the hearing of this case has already been taken.   http://www.urantia.org/papers/paper53.ht...
iqWfufpUaa	Don't leave your screen door open!    Damn!  I was trying to find the scene in Christmas Story when the neighbours hound dogs storm their kitchen and make off with the whole turkey    Thus, forcing them to go to a Chinese restaurant and have their first "Chinese Turkey" - hilarious!|`|YH6Ja07eaa	Does this mean that you believe in God?|`|7kR5dBTlaa	LULZ!!|`|J7KSKm54aa	How big is your dog's mouth?|`|evStsOQiaa	God should have taught them how to shoot a thieving dog.|`|vKmzcZZvaa	The lesson that he's trying to teach? That if he actually existed, your dog would have returned with a fully cooked babby.
AA11212102	You have been wronged. You have been hurt. This is a civil case. You are able to prove that this was done on school property. So, the school is trying to protect itself from a lawsuit and they are going to put up a defense. So, you must take your  own side and prove they are the party that has wronged you. This is pretty Straight forward as I see it from the bleachers. You can do something or you can limp off in disgust at the system. It is up to you.|`|zvDVYN5Kaa	I think that kid should be kicked out of school, just like the other rotten kids in our schools that either have racial discrimination problems or just problems in general. They should all be dealt with harshly especially the kid in your situation. If the school doesn't do anything then the board of ed will. I mean come on this is high school not kindergarten. Make sure something happens to that kid..you cant leave things like this and just walk away from them. Hey if you believe in Karma then this kid should break his legs in an accident even worst =D. Yea well my point is if the school cant do anything go to board of ed...if they cant do anything well you will have to revert to higher authority figures. One person can impact the face of a school for years to come..keep that in mind =D|`|VUfT35UQaa	wow, that is totally unfair! of course you wanted to show the smug git up in front of your class (kudos, on that by the way) and because of the adrenaline and time it takes for a bruise to appear, you would have carried on playing. Your gym teacher saw what happened, and talked to the kid afterwards, and so it's not fair that he gets off with no punishment. You didn't say how old you and he are and if you're in high school, then they should seriously do something about that kid lashing out! I would go to the head teacher and request that there be a punishment for the brat in question, or even, if you're willing to make the school hate you a little bit, go to your local paper or the school board.    If I were you I wouldn't let this go. If he did that on the street, it would be assault.    Good luck and get well soon|`|a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	Something should happen to the kid.  However, since you continued to play, you most likely contributed to the damage to your knees.  If you had gone to the nurse immediately, you might not be having this problem now and the kid might have had something done to him.|`|QlzFoBS3aa	This is a novel not a Question, please shorten it to get someone who is willing to read it all.  As for the PART of it I read, someone may need to see a Dr.|`|pGw2ev7Saa	well yea that is unfair but i don't know what to say, sometime life sucks and what goes around comes around so he'll be feeling it pretty soon.  but i hope you get better soon |`|vRPqfdlaaa	DO you think it has been suppressed because of a potential racial issue?
0G7pJAiLaa	Oh my goodness, excellent question! I actually asked this question, only in a different perspective. i asked "are black women attracted to white men at all?"     Well, I love black women. I'm really not attracted to any other type of woman. I just have always imagined a goddess being black. I love the skin tone, the hair, and everything else.     I personally think that Adam was white, and Eve was black. That's how you get all the other skin tones inbetween.     But once again, I do agree, there are A LOT of white men who don't like black women- usually becuase they're racist. And it is rare to see the two in public. I love black women though, always have since i was a little boy.     Great interesting question!     Hope This Helped!! :)     and by the way... u seem pretty beautiful yourself haha   i see ur 15. im 16.   Add me on MySpace. myspace.com/rocker_brett|`|JBT4RQuBaa	yes, of course just like any other other race.|`|WgruZkHRaa	Yes if they are polite, and not in your face. Tough B's turn me off|`|92iuiuZKaa	Depends on the Individual!!|`|UspK4SQBaa	Not the desperate ones.|`|QYDYX9B7aa	I would say sadly but rarely.    It depends though. I would imagine if the black woman was lean and sexy, perhaps. The overweight ones don't care and they are ever so strong even if no white guys are attracted to them. I've talked with such people and they turn out to be really nice and friendly!|`|TMi1GhSHaa	ya my step mom is black and dad is white.. i have two half sisters who are biracial from my step mom and dad..|`|a7ehLBcLaa	not usually.|`|nwRBiyMFaa	I am. But that's just me...|`|m3ThrbDMaa	Sure...    A beautiful woman is a beautiful woman no matter what her ancestry...|`|qWu5F1O2aa	My friend has dated at least 3. He's half white and half latino. You wouldnt know it though, he looks white|`|lQC5S37Paa	yea! really its not what color the skin is!|`|9q7UPZIfaa	Of course some are attracted to black women.  They are ashamed to displayed that in public though.|`|da4zS4AOaa	Maybe. One has been attracted to me.  And these days at school there's these 2 boys who usually look at me. I see them when I turn my right eye and i can see them looking at me. I guess being foreign with my accent is a plus :) lol.    But to answer your question YES. "Some" Definitely not ALL|`|9c40eaa9939b61f8b2a2080ce89b4c22aa	Of course, some are and some aren't.|`|X40Ww89qaa	nope|`|j6RDbnl6aa	go to hollywood.  you'll see all kinds of mixture.|`|6627NijZaa	theres a couple like that in my highschool and they kiss in public|`|c8f2b08d3fd8fb61fb9b5b49572c858faa	yep, just ask my husband of the last 14 yrs.|`|2QuGuphYaa	I disagree.    Where do you live?  Maybe that's why you don't see it that often.  In New York City, it is quite common to see interracial couples from all walks of life.    I also know plenty of white men who are absolutely crazy for black women.|`|YBC6QMs8aa	nope i dnt think so|`|HLMzKR53aa	my step mom is black and my dad is white. he is obviously very attracted to her if he married her.|`|q9yQwOecaa	You might as well ask if white men are attracted to brunettes.     Personally? No  But I know a kid whose parents are white and black.|`|4CsGde1qaa	Whoa! Hold the phone there! This cannot be true, at least for me. I have dated quite a few number of girls back then, and here is one of the stories. I dated a "chocolate" skin girl(please excuse me for not using the word "black," as I find it to be quite insulting) 5 years ago, and her name was Avionne. Not only was she nice, smart and trilingual, but she was also taller than me, Can you believe that! Love exists in any part of the rainbow, its just the kind of thing your gonna have to believe!|`|wZMq5jqyaa	some are, some aren't. my exes were. who cares though.|`|YSr8dm5faa	Just ask my white boyfriend and he'll tell you what HE thinks. 4 of my black female friends are with white men also. Race seems to be an issue here in the USA- travel will do you good. It all depends on the guy, in short.    Btw white men are nothing special.... before I date a white guy, he has to be attractive. No exceptions to the rule.|`|6tHA0QQXaa	The ones that i have dated have told me that they are not sure if black women will accept them,so they do not make it plain how they feel.They also feel that black men will try to hurt them.|`|lPPgMKibaa	I certainly am.. give me a tyra banks or a beyonce any day, haha..    meme has problems. dont listen to her.|`|AA12018110	I'm guessing they do since nearly all of my 1st cousins on my mothers side are 1/2 white|`|PLDRCAWlaa	YES they are i live in germany and i always get hit on when i go to the park it just depends on the person or where you are ...  my current boyfriend, william who is so cutee (preppy, blond hair, blue eyes, and liked riding on his horses) he always tells me that he was scared to ask me out because he was afraid of rejection but how can someone turn down blue eyes lol   welll i like his as a person and everytime we visit my parents in Ontario we get the wierdest looks from people once we went to the victoria secret store in the mall and the sales people were like OMG and pointing at us and stuff   heehe we gave the a good show of PDA !  so YES white guys like black girls|`|3OGqz3Uyaa	Yes, they do. I am a black woman who's engaged to a gorgeous white man who is NOT a 'thug wannabe' type. He's actually very nerdy, and I love it :)    And we have a gorgeous daughter together :)    Just thought I'd throw that in.    It's not impossible to find a white guy who likes black women, though.|`|ZoHLFcNCaa	Well ofc my mom's boyfriend is caucasion|`|KuvffA73aa	if there like beyonce hot, but no not really.|`|949AJbB6aa	I am attracted to some black women. Kind of like how I am attracted to some white women.|`|pwY5jwOIaa	Ummmmmm not being racist or whatnot but definatly not, i dont roll that way, but idk about other men,.... its theyre choice...|`|dI0lvvcsaa	no|`|zSkUhkrKaa	I am.. and my music arts teacher whom is caucasian is married to a black woman|`|UEhmcMo0aa	nope. cuz usally black girls are dirty.|`|PYAddY7taa	im latino  im attracted to black women|`|q0QuOC3vaa	I think it just depends on the person i guess....|`|TprIqGhCaa	Of course they are...me being a perfect example. I'm married to a white man! And I live in a predominately white town, and there were some white men that I've dated.|`|iYPwLxr3aa	no way sista|`|AA11121540	it depands|`|kv5GGYbhaa	Really it Depends on the person .   I For one believe skin colour does not matter.   xoxo|`|b4v2zdHZaa	it depends on the person! my dad is black and my mom is white and they were together for more then 10 years.|`|0QXQu5hvaa	honestly, i know tons of couples that the man is white and the women is black. it is not very common, but i really depends on the man, but more than anything, it depends on the woman. like i wud not go out with just any white man. it depends on the person|`|bd149acf47464f0da5277c47830f0ef6aa	black white red yellow.........whatever.....|`|9Wswr7kiaa	I can't speak for all white men, but there aren't any races I'm not attracted to.|`|FYda5GBhaa	i think asian girls r fit. esp turks  african not that keen  carrabian not that keen  arab. never really seen 1|`|eo0DKI0qaa	I don't mean to sound racist, but it kinda depends on how light or dark the skin of each person is, but yes we find you guys attractive.|`|7PyguvVgaa	not very much but some are. my aunt is married to a white guy, and robin thicke is married to a black girl.|`|AA12322068	My sister is married to a white man and he just loves her so much.|`|wlkp7ac7aa	my teacher is white and his wife is black|`|oB2hKVtmaa	to be honest    some guys LOVE black women    but some guys r just plain rednecks and all like white women    but they r totally missing out|`|g3HvXFGjaa	Some are...I'm black and I have two aunts who are married to white guys so it just depends.|`|pian616Daa	Well you're a bit of an idiot then aren't you? There are plenty of white men with black women. I think its sad how you have to reduce people to colors to make yourself feel good.|`|AA11899452	I dont think thats true. As a white male I have found some black women very appealing but did not think they would be interested in me being a white male. I dont have money or a big fine house so unless it was on of these love at first sight things (unlikely} what would I realy have to offer but the stares and the behind the back comments? This is also why I think so many black guys hook up with white chicks. They seem to thrive on controversy and just doing anything to be what they think is being the big man. A black guy once told me that his daddy told him it was his job in life to F--k as many white girls as he could before he died. Now thats one hell of a father figure.   Dont worry girl, Im sure theres some that are interested but dont or are not quite sure how to approach it.|`|lXOjqvcPaa	Of course they are  duh my fiance is from belgium his name is Allan|`|4307972eb5bfbca7acf00bd3df286e3eaa	Yes, we are|`|HUcLSUBMaa	listen to me.  im white and i am strongly attracted to black girls. im also very cute and smart and white girls and black girls love me. ill send you a pic if you want i can link you to facebook.  ive liked black girls (or found them more attractive) since grade school before i even went to high school (my high school was mostly black.)  but the fact is most white guys dont like black girls. thats just the way it is. and back when i cared what ppl thought about me i would front like i didnt like black girls just so i wouldnt get "labeled." maybe thats what it is or maybe they just dont like you guys i dont know. God Bless-  i edited this in- ive also found that most white girls are way faster to fall in love with me and do more to please me (you know what im talking about) this is before i was a christian. white girls would be like i love you so much chris youre so fine and black girls that i messed with when i talked to them i would have to w8 cuz ppl would be calling them on the other line every 5 minutes and they never loved me.  i heard a black guy say that sistas do more for you so maybe they did for him but white girls (and im speaking in general terms) like on average if i pick a white girl out of a large group instead of the black girls they will be falling in love with me and calling me all the time and going down on me alot.  im just being honest.   ya other white guys used to be amazed at me to see me with a chocolate skinned black girl and all like hey is that your gf???  other black girls would always start smiling at me and pointing it was funny. LOL so if your a white guy and you mess with black girls youre gonna get hated on by everybody (white girls, white guys, and especially black guys, and the only ones who will like you are black girls) unless youre me then white girls still like you and start trying to act black around you lol|`|G6owPyncaa	depends in my case I'm biracial my mom is black then yeah my dad ( white) was attracted to her

OZ2Ass9iaa	Real Satanism isn't worshipping a red guy with a fork.  It has to do with natural laws etc.  Yeah, I think they're real.|`|TnquzeM5aa	The average satanist is a teenage male who feels like an outsider at school.|`|EQUEuXIjaa	Usually its just a bunch of people practicing intellectual back flips.|`|N8wutNoLaa	my understanding is that Satanists think Satan is mythical.  but at the same time, they worship what he stood for.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	I think it's as made up as the whole God thing, but I don't have as negative a feeling towards them because they don't lecture me on what a horrible person I am.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	First of all, everyone is "born atheist." You have to be taught to believe in gods.  Second if you don't believe in gods, or a christ, than certainly believing in demons, devils or an anti-christ is a corollary.  Fundamentalist Christians do believe in the devil as a real entity.  There might well be three kinds of Satanists:  1--LeVey followers: atheistic  2--Ex-Christians, who believe in the entire "god cast Lucifer from HEaven" scenario, and think Lucifer (a.k.a "Satan") got a raw deal  3--Posers. Gothic pretenders.  By the way, while we are on the subject,  "Satan" means "accuser, opponent or adversary"--certainly in line with description  2, above.  "Lucifer" means "bringer of light" and was actually analogous to the Greek god Helios or the Roman Apollo. His characterization as a fallen angel was immortalized by Milton in "Paradise Lost."|`|KWvGUoW6aa	I would lean towards agreeing with you.|`|jW8Fm0eKaa	im sure there are lots of satanists just pissing people off but im sure there are other satanists who actually worship him|`|h1eBWehMaa	no they are real, there was a special on the History Channel about them|`|GeoiGjbCaa	There are at least some satanists who genuimely seem to believe that satan is the true god who got a raw deal from the other god. They believe satan will one day regain his rightful place in heaven.|`|L4eoLmvJaa	I never really thought about it because I have trouble with the basic concept of a "higher authority"|`|kLf8xFp7aa	Okay, well, yes, I believe that Satan is real, but he holds no power, really.   But anyway, Satanist are Satanist because the Devil had gone into their mind to change their thoughts. Satan can do that. He can make you think what he wants you to think.  He can do that to Christians too, but they are to ignore it, and try to do what Christ would do.  Anyway, Satan's either threatening them or tricking them into worshiping him.

The other kind of satanism is the theistic satanism, where belief in devils, especially satan is prevalent.  If you cannot believe that someone could believe in satan, how can you believe that someone believes in his counterpart, god?

AA12006309	A biological female who transitions to a male, and they like men, is gay.    A biological male who is gay who transitions to being a woman, is also straight.    You need to consider their orientation from the standpoint of their gender identity, NOT their biological sex.    Typically surgery won't be considered until after you're done growing, around age 18-20, though hormones can be started much earlier than that.  Some people don't transition until much later in life, sometimes into their 50's or beyond.  It's never to late to consider transition.|`|u6K5TtRlaa	I'm not transgender, nor am I lucky enough to have transgender friends (except one who's struggling with it, but working towards a healthy life) so I can't give you a certain answer, but here's what I understand:    Transgender people are born with the wrong biological sex, one that doesn't jive well with their psychological gender. A woman who was born biologically male will usually, as I understand it, be attracted to other men even while she still has the biological traits of a male, making her appear, on the outside, homosexual, but, after going through sexual reassignment surgery or whatever it's called, she'll be biologically female and still pursue relationships with men, making her appear heterosexual.    I don't think anyone's sexuality changes before or after opting to undergo surgery, it just looks different to us because, where once there were two women, now there are one man and one woman. The man was always attracted to women, he just wasn't biologically male.    Does that make sense?    Beyond that, I just like to avoid labels. You're attracted to men, you're attracted to women, you have a penis, you don't have a penis, what does it matter!? Just be comfortable with who you are, even if you have to change your outside to match your inside.    As for the age, I think you have to be old enough to give consent (18 most often) or have your legal guardians give consent if you're underage. Theoretically, you could do it at any age, but it's recommended you wait a little while and make sure your sexuality and gender identity don't change. Sometimes they're a little fluid, and won't settle until you're in your twenties or thirties or later.|`|IIsByPj6aa	if a straight girl, meaning she was into guys, gets sex reassignment surgery, she would be a "gay man".  if a gay man, meaning he is attracted to men, gets sex reassignment surgery, he would be a "straight girl".  I'm not sure how old you have to be to get the surgery done in the first place, but the reassignment starts with years of hormone therapy before any surgery is approached.    Also, transgenders, as they identify as members of the opposite gender, calling the "girl who turns into a guy" a "girl" is technically incorrect.  All along he would have felt like a gay man trapped in a woman's body, or so the rationale goes.  Same for the "gay guy" who becomes a woman. All along she was a woman who was attracted to men, only trapped in a man's body.|`|vsUZ77AFaa	I think you mean, a female having a sex change to become a man but still being attracted to men would make that f2m a gay man in many people's point of veiw but as far as I know by law she would still be female so therefore would still be able to do things such as marry (not just civil partnership) her/his husband.    Same for the homosexual m2f(male to female) I think, so he would still not be able to marry his/her partner, as I think they wud still be counted as the gender they were born.    And I beleive you would have to be 18, (only a guess) and they would put them through a lot of therapy first to make sure it was what they wanted.    Hope that helped x|`|LOSfacl5aa	1) female to male and he likes men when he is complete makes him a man who likes men, that is gay    2) male to female is a woman and is lesbian if she likes females, or is str8 if she likes men    3) as far as I know no surgeon will perform the genital reassignment surgery until you are 18.

A transsexual man recieves treatment for being born transsexual.  Please respect HIS identity.  As far as sexual orientation:    To know a persons sexuality you must know how they identify gender-wise first.    If a person identifies as female, no matter their surgical status, and they attracted to men, they are straight.    If a person identifies as female, no matter their surgical status, and are attracted to women, they are lesbian.

The strata, fossils, and other such evidence point directly to the Great Flood.    5. Logic supports the Bible. Many arguments are made in the Bible. Just count how many times words like "therefore" and "since" are used.    Just because Paul wrote after Jesus ascended into heaven, doesn't mean that he added his own philosophy into his epistles. Paul did not write any of the Gospels. He just wrote letters to churches.|`|mVsWyu0yaa	ymoham:   The bible, far from being accurate, is filled with contradictions, anomalies, anachronisms, errors, late Christian forgeries and outright lies.     The truth is, except for a very few letters that can definitely be attributed to Paul, we do not know WHO wrote the rest of the Bible.  For centuries it was taught and believed that Moses was the author of the Pentateuch (the first five books of the bible)...but scholarly investigation over the years has proved that the man called Moses could NOT have written the Pentateuch.     The Gospel authors contradict each other and, in some cases, contradict THEMSELVES....as John did in writing that "Jesus baptized" but almost in the same verse stated that "Jesus did NOT baptize".  The birth stories and the genealogies of Jesus contradict each other on so many points, that they cannot be of any use in determineng anything pertaining to Jesus of Nazareth...and they certainly cannot be used...as young earth fanatics insist, to determine the age of the earth.     Paul is the last person anyone should go to for information about Jesus of Nazareth...for the very good reason that Paul NEVER MET JESUS....everything he writes is NOT about Jesus but the false Christian Messiah that he created long after the alleged crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth.  He was not interested in presenting the historical Jesus...but the mythical, resurrected Jesus Christ.  Since he was not an EYE WITNESS to anything pertaining to Jesus, he cannot be taken seriously as anything other than a Mythmaker...the inventor of Christianity.    Edit    Shelby S:     Sorry, but if your grandmom told you your "Lord Christ Jesus" wrote ANYTHING, she is bonkers!!! Jesus never wrote one word that was ever recorded by anyone.    Zarove:  Obviously, your "in depth investigation" was not deep enough.  The alleged "moral guidance" found in both the Old and New Testaments was all plagerized from early religions...The Mosaic Code was based in large part of the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, the Ten Commandents echo the Ancient Egyptian "Negative Confession".  The Psalms, the Proverbs, the "Wisdom" books were almost word for word rip-offs of the earlier Egyptian "wisdom books".  Much of the Christian ritual 'allegedly' posited in the New Testament...including Baptism,  and the Eucharist, were taken from Zoroastrianism and the Mitraic practices. Even the Golden Rule that Christians attribute to Jesus appeared in every single religion BEFORE Christianity.  As a moral guide, the Old Testament is a wash out, presenting a monstrous god who invented Slavery, Polygamy, Concubinage, Ethnic Cleansing, and the wholesale Slaughter of non-believers.|`|qTmVdDLLaa	you just have to believe in Christ the Lord and know that what he has written is indeed the truth.Paul might have had an angel sent to him to show him what the good Lord Himself wants the world to know what is coming and our past.you just have to believe in your faith and religion. get it now?|`|8YX0C7qFaa	The question is somewhat unanswerable because your statement is flawed.    For instance, you say that you'd trust the Bible better if it hadn't been written by Paul after Jeuss died. Does this include Genesis thrugh Malachi?    Paul didn't write the Bible. Paul wrote the Epistles of OPaul, which are in a Standard New Testament the Epistles which run from Romans to 2nd Timothy, and often Hebrews is included wiht them alhouh few Schoalrs beelive he wrote Hebrews.    Thi is a total of 13 Epistles, out of 27 New TEstament works. 14 works where not written by Paul at all. This includes the Gospels.    That said, the reason I know the Bibel is accurate breaks down into what th Bible is used for and what you are reading it for.    We know the Bible is Historiclaly acucrate because we have a lot of different texts in the Bible which back each other up (The Bible was never designed to be a single book, by the way) and that are backe dup by outside textual soruces, as well as Archeological evidence.    Now this doens't mean we have absolute proof for everythgin in the Bible, but we have enough evidence ot eb raosnabely sure that the major events needed for Christendom to be viable did at leats in some way occure.    We know by textual evidence alone the life of Jeuss happened, for example.    If you'r lookign for Moral. guidance, we also have 2000 years worth of expeirnce withthe etachigns of the Bible which have priven useful in everyday life and have had a pwoerful transformative effec ton individuals and society at large and have priven benificial.

God by divine grace inspired these folks to write.  Hopefully the Holy Spirit can weed out the wheat from the chaff when reading any religious text, but overall the Bible appears to be pretty consistent with God's wishes for an authoritative body of writing which explains God.  Paul was unique among the writers because he knew the resurrected Jesus Christ.  That same Jesus can speak to our hearts too today.

Jehovah God never fails to accomplish what he purposes to do. Through his prophet Isaiah, he declared: "Just as the pouring rain descends, and the snow, from the heavens and does not return to that place, unless it actually saturates the earth and makes it produce and sprout, and seed is actually given to the sower and bread to the eater, so my word that goes forth from my mouth will prove to be.

DArAz67Caa	God has been with me since I was a tiny fetus-----he brought me life----he created me-----he created you----|`|houWY7qvaa	This is not Psyche 101.  I was a child and everyone around me believed in God.  I knew people from various religious backgrounds and read the Bible from beginning to end twice at the age of seven because we were sent to bed so early and that was the only reading material left in the room, besides our bedtime stories, or other children's books.   So, how old were you when you could read anything to that extent and did you understand any of it?     Trust me, my early experiences do play a significant part in why I believe, but not in entirety.  I like to find out things on my own.  I pride myself in being objective, fair, open minded and I don't believe because someone else believes the same way.  It's personal.

I am not a very religious person myself, although I am catholic, but even so, I am no ordinary catholic. I punish myself, I reward myself and it doesn't hit me to be a cristian when wrong is done. Even if religions never existed, my conscious and behavior are always of god moral decision, and i don't do harm to anyone. I do believe in god, but I don't chant his name like a freak. Why? I still love him, but running to God would probably be the last thing he would want. We are not stupid as to not know what to expect from our mistakes. It's like running to my mom every time I get dumped by a girl. It is pretty silly the idea really.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	No, I have been His child since before I was born. I didn't think I was horrible when I was a fetus.:P|`|KWvGUoW6aa	Yes, religion can definitely hit someone the hardest when they are in their darkest hour. This is something that religion is good at. I think that usually religions will make you feel as though you're horrible so that you will believe. If someone comes to the church and already feels horrible, it's a perfect opportunity for a pastor to work his magic.    Christianity has a thing called "Original Sin." It states that you are born a sinner, and that you will never be completely happy until you put God in your life. So, they will tell you that you are unhappy now because you don't have God in your life, but if you accept God into your life, he is going to make better things happen for you.    You might actually feel better, but it's not because there is a God, but rather because you WANT to feel better, and you WANT to believe that it's the religion that is making you feel better.    It's all Psychological, and very interesting.|`|YMFo5N2haa	NO. Just experiencing things in my life that no man could have got me out of and I know this!

Not because I felt horrible. Just because I knew--trust me, it was way easier to not have to believe in anything, and I wouldn't have just 'become' religious for the heck of it.    And now, though I'm not perfect, I am Christian. For one thing, it challenges me to be a decent human being, and care about something that isn't all about me.

871ea50d251ea84b03eb405148721ecbaa	In the Vision of Scipio Cicero has preserved some of the ancient doctrine concerning the derivation of souls from the empyrean. The spirit of Africanus tells his son that souls were supplied to men from the eternal fires, which are constellations and stars. Virgil says that in souls there is a potency like fire. In the Hymn to Minerva of Proclus, souls originate  "From the great fathers fount, supremely bright,  Like fire resounding, leaping into light."  The light of fire is the sun, the sun being the God Ra, all consciousness comes from the sun, the giver of life, the father of the soul (consciousness) The Egyptians believed that the soul was divine, that it was an actual part of Ra, that he had allowed to fall to the underworld to bring light to the dead. We are the dead in this analogy. The soul is then immersed in the waters ( matter, mater, mother = Isis) and Human life as both matter and divine is born. The fall from heaven is simplified as the falling rains, this then becomes the life force of matter (mother, earth) you have heard the terms that the rivers of the world are its life-force, blood, veins. this makes its way to the sea, back to mother earth, it is then vaporised (the spirit is set free) and raised back tot he heavens, through the glory of Ra (the guiding light of the sun) If you have learnt all there is to learn and been enlightened through your incarnation, you pass to the heavens (becoming a celestial being in the stars) if not you once again fall as the rain to repeat the process until the epiphany is procured, thus the cycle keeps repeating itself.  If God is the Sun, Ra, then the mother is Isis ( matter, mater) Horus is the Christ, the divine part of the human condition (KRST)   These Egyptian beliefs have been expanded on throughout the years of development and incorporated different ideologies, but this is the foundation of life through the Mythos. We know through research ourselves that Jesus is an avatar for Horus, that the parallels between them are too numerous to count, thus the beginnings of Christianity is here in the cycle of water and life. In the 3rd and 4th C these mythos' were interpreted as literal history and thus the Orthodox church began. Though we had the reformation, Protestantism never crossed the boundaries of the basic interpretation as a literal account of the person of Jesus as the Christ.     The OT is based on the Book of the Dead and the NT is based on both the OT and the Book of the Dead, all expanding from Egypt, the Christian church made the mistake of turning an esoteric story into an exoteric history    Jesus never existed|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	No they don't. When you try to tell them, they act like you grew another head and are spouting lies even though the evidence is right in front of them, clear as day. If you read any of Jesus' words that are in the NT even if he was just a myth, he did not want a religion based on him, yet Saul/Paul did it anyway and even preached things that directly opposed what Christ taught, while claiming that he was divinely instructed by Jesus to preach these exact teachings.     There is nothing that remotely resembles what Jesus taught and what Paul taught but yet Christianity is supposedly about what Jesus taught even though it is all Paul's creation.     Christians don't believe for one second that the Jesus mythos could possibly have been derived from prior belief systems since they firmly believe that those other beliefs are purely coincidental and if they were similar, it was because "Christianity came about first". Which is not the case at all. But good luck trying to infiltrate their bubble and convince them otherwise.|`|AA10554783	Tell me some more!|`|44cd283169fb972cb9a8006a9ecce2d1aa	Canned One,  The BIBLE was written by about 40 separate writers.

d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	Using the phrase "lose your virginity" usually implies a desire and consent to it, and not a forceable action.     That does not make it RIGHT, however.

To atone for one mans [Adams] trespass, the one man Jesus Christ had to correspond exactly to the once-perfect Adam. He had to be a perfect man, nothing more, nothing less. (Romans 5:15) Like Adam, Jesus could have married and produced his own family, made up eventually of billions of perfect humans. But that was not the Fathers will for him. Gods will was for Jesus to remain childless and to present himself as a perfect human sacrifice. His blood poured out in death would represent his perfect human life corresponding exactly to Adams life, and this he would use in buying all of Adams family to be his own. Thus Jesus would become father to this orphaned family, the many of whom he speaks at Matthew 20:28:    The Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many.|`|hgTR8Uzaaa	The whole reason Jesus came to this earth was to die for us.  So it would not have made sense for him to have run away.  God had willed Jesus (his son) to die for us since the Garden of Eden.

I can excuse the white people, they are clueless but the black girls getting on your case are ridiculous. Open your eyes people. I am with you Lannie, speak the truth girl. This is a good question that every black woman should be asking. Don't let those in denial stop you from questioning all the nappy hatred.     1. Black hair is fragile, a weave is a good way to switch up styles without damaging hair underneath. Africans have been using weaves for millenia, the look of them has changed however.     2. Weave used to be about achieving a more African look, now it about achieving the hair of a different people. No matter how much some people relax their hair let's get real. It never really looks like white people hair, it looks like nappy hair that's been relaxed. A weave or lace front wig made up of Asian hair can achieve that look though.    3. We have been brainwashed into believing our own hair texture is not beautiful and manageable. Nappy is a bad word to black people. It holds hurt in it becuase we have been indoctrinated since slavery. So fake blond Korean hair sewn onto our head is  prettier than our natural hair? Whatever. Escape the hair matrix people.    4. Many black women have damaged their own hair beyond repair with chemicals and heat and are using weave to cover embarassingly thinning, broken strands. Just truth.     These are all the reasons I used to wear weave.|`|LhCGU3F1aa	Wow, they wear extentions.|`|CGxQ9vSuaa	Everyone nowadays wears extensions, pieces and weaves.

Some white people actually do use weave. Nothing is wrong with weave it just gives your hair extra length.

Textures which they naturally have length. Don't sound so ignorant!

You put a lot of negativity into the world just by your thoughts. Did you know that? You have to understand that your thoughts sub conciously send out signals to people even when you don't know it. If you were being genuinely nice and happy, like I am talking GENUINE you would not have this happen. A smile and a fake attitude just for a few days does nothing, you have to actually believe you are truly happy and you will start to see changes. You are not truly happy, people know that, even strangers. So people will be arseholes.

I concede on one point, the wearing of graven Images such as "The Cross". Adorned by Men and Woman.    But there is an interesting verse in Galatians 3: 28. I quote>- There is  neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither  male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.    Pee -Wee|`|AA11220299	Most crosses are note expensive items, and in fact,"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image" is far more of a deterant than wearing jewelry.|`|vOI3u9jfaa	Women are vain, the BOOK also says to study to show thyself approved|`|oJxceG0Kaa	Proverbs 3:3 says to wear your trustworthiness around your neck.  Jewelry does not define Godly beauty, one way or the other.  The Book of Esther is an example of a woman groomed to God's purpose by outward adornment.  Simplicity of heart and soul is in the mind and "dressing down" makes as much difference as "dressing up" would before God.|`|hgTR8Uzaaa	Are you asking why women wear crosses and crucifixes as jewelry when the Bible specifically forbids women to wear jewelry?  If that is your question, then I would say the point of those verses is not for women to not wear jewelry or fine clothes.  It doesn't seem like God has anything against women having a few nice things.  Remember when Abraham's servant gave Rachel a bracelet and ring?  Or think of the story when the woman anointed Jesus' feet with perfume.  Even Jesus, although obviously not a woman, had one piece of fine clothing that was seamless.  It was so nice that the soldiers did not want to tear it.    I think the message of these verses is that we women should not focus too much on our outward appearance.  We should not rely on our outward adornments or beautiful hair to be our only source of beauty.  And, very importantly, we should be modest.  I think a strong piece of evidence supporting this is the fact that both verses mention "braided hair."  In biblical times, braided hair was a sign of prostitution or a loose woman.  It obviously does not mean that nowadays.  It would almost mean the opposite today.  When I see a woman with braids, I think it is an immature hairstyle.  The only females wearing braids are little girls.    God is more concerned with our hearts and our attitudes than what we are wearing.  A woman could be dressed in black from head to toe with no jewelry or anything, but she could be very flirtatious and seductive.  Obviously God doesn't appreciate that.  Again, I think God is looking more on our hearts.  If our hearts are right, then it will reflect what we are wearing.|`|74b1131cf5ddd01a70564ef108e130bfaa	Kudos to "ansn".  Excellent answer and I agree.    My dear Anabaptist friend, I wear two very tiny stud earrings and one modest (i.e., small and not ornate) crucifix.  Both were given to me by my husband; the first on the occasion of our 24th anniversary, and the second for personal reasons of faith.  The crucifix is most often tucked inside whatever I'm wearing on top, I'm the only one who knows it's there.  The earrings, well, you may be able to see them on a sunny day when they reflect the light, but they don't stand out otherwise.      I don't wear these pieces of jewelry to impress anyone, including myself.    It's not a matter of ignoring the verses you've mentioned, but understanding the intent.  I do find plain and modest apparel and covered hair to be admirable in the communities which practice this, and I respect them greatly.  It would be good of you to not make blanket assumptions about the rest of us when it comes to wearing religious jewelry.|`|TMb076n6aa	because some are not legalists. And it does not matter how you dress as long as it is not revealing or immodest. Make up and jewelry are good in moderation but not overkill.
9Wswr7kiaa	That's interesting- I have the same problem.  I'm physically attracted to women but I can't see myself in a romantic relationship with them.      Anyhow, if I were you, I would try dating a woman and see how it goes.  Romantic relationships don't have to be physical, after all.  Just make sure you explain to her that you aren't interested in physical contact.

w8uUWK03aa	It would appear from the lack of responses, nobody knows what "toughing a guy" involves.  I have tried Googling it, but still can't find out what it is supposed to be... even in the Urban Dictionary!  So I'm now making a guess that you meant "touching".    It's very sad if, just by touching another male, we're presumed to be gay and I think that brings into question your upbringing.  Are you gay when you shake another guy's hand or do a high five, or tap them on the shoulder?  Are sportsmen gay when they hug and kiss their team mates after scoring points?    Of course if you touched them on the genitals with the intent of coming on to them, then that's another matter!
vnJG8UYJaa	Sometimes people feel like the issue of sharing food is romantic or intimate.  Maybe your bf thinks it is okay to do this because of the level of your relationship.  It does not matter what he thinks.  It is your food, no matter who is paying the bill.  If you find the behavior unacceptable, tell him.  If he refuses to listen to you, turn down a dinner date by telling him that he makes it uncomfortable and embarrassing for you to go out to eat with him.  Tell him you are willing to go to a movie, but you'll buy your own food.  Maybe this will get it through his head that this is something you don't like.

Aren't you guys screwed?|`|rh8szekzaa	What's so important about belief? Surely God would care more about whether you're a good person or not rather than if you believe.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	What if the god that really exists sends all good people to heaven and all bad people to hell except people who pretended to know for a fact another god existed? then all good atheists are going to heaven but YOU ARE GOING STRAIGHT TO HELL. Why not repent when you still have time? Why risk eternity in hell?    What if god loves music and sends all musicians to heaven, but all other people to hell? How can you risk eternal torture by not playing at least four hours a day?    And how can you worship a sadistic god that tortures good people - most of the people who ever lived - for all eternity?    Pascal's wager:    "If god exists, it's infinitely better to believe, since you get heaven instead of hell for eternity. If he doesn't, it doesn't matter since you're dead anyway. So overall it's better to believe"    This is, of course, false.    Some of the problems with the argument:    * The assumption that if a god really exists, he or she set up an afterlife with a heaven and hell    * The assumption that if a god really exists, he or she cares about belief in him/her above all else    * The assumption that if you believe in a god, it will definitely be the same god that actually exists.    * The assumption that you lose nothing if it's false. Religious belief costs people plenty - money donated to churches, time spent praying, marriages ending because of religious differences, lives lost because of relying on prayers or refused medical care, wars... need I go on?    * The assumption that people can believe in something simply because it benefits them. Would you believe goblins exist for twenty bucks? Why not?    * The assumption that any god won't see through the "believing just to get into heaven" ploy.    http://www.abarnett.demon.co.uk/atheism/...  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal...  http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/t...|`|TnquzeM5aa	KNEEL BEFORE ZOD!|`|yMqWvG8naa	The most obvious problems with Pascal's Wager are:    * How do you know which God to believe in? There are plenty to choose from, and if you pick the wrong one, you could be in big trouble (e.g. what if you choose Jesus, but get to heaven only to come face-to-trunk with Ganesh?). This is known as the "Avoiding the wrong Hell problem". If a dozen people of different religions came to you with Pascal's Wager, how could you possibly choose between them? After all, many religions are quite specific that they are the One True Religion, and not any others. Jesus Christ said "I am the way, the truth and the light. None shall come to the Father except through me." [emphasis added] and no doubt most other religions make similar claims. If a Christian considers the Wager as strong support for his faith, surely he must accept that it is equally valid for all other religions when presented to himself?  * God is not stupid. Won't He know that you're just trying to get a free ride into Heaven? How can you sincerely believe in a God simply out of convenience?  * If there is no God, you have still lost something. You have wasted a good portion of your life performing the various devotional rituals, attending Churches, praying, reading scripture and discussing your deity with His other followers. Not to mention giving your hard-earned money to the church, wasting your intelligence on theological endeavours and boring the hell out of people who really don't want to hear your Good News.  * Can you get away with just sort of generally believing in a Supreme Being, without specifically believing in one particular Deity? Probably not - God will still know what you're up to. Also, many Gods are quite particular about how they should be worshipped. Many born-again Christians will tell you that the only way to Heaven is through accepting Jesus Christ as your personal saviour - nothing more and nothing less. General-Deity-Belief and being nice simply won't do. Many people believe that all the different religions are merely alternative routes to the same destination. Nice and tolerant (if a little warm'n'fuzzy) though this may be, there is no valid reason to accept this stance over the fire-and-brimstone fundamentalist position : if the fundies are right, then the un-Saved liberal theists are in just as much trouble as the nonbelievers.  * Few, if any, atheists disbelieve in deities out of choice. It's not as if we know the god is really there, but somehow refuse to believe in it (for example, see if you can choose to truly believe that Australia does not exist). Most atheists disbelieve simply because they know of no compelling evidence to suggest that any sort of god exists. If you want an atheist to believe, show her some good evidence, don't just say it's in her best interests to believe even if there is no god. A person cannot choose to sincerely believe in something, just because it is pragmatic to do so. Sure, you could say all the right prayers and attend church regularly, but that is not the same thing as actually believing, and any God worth his salt would obviously see straight through that.  * It is quite insulting. It amounts to a thinly veiled threat, little better than saying "Believe in my God or He'll send you to Hell" (in fact, this is often the form it is presented in). Also, the theist making this threat assumes that the atheist believes there is a Hell or a God to send her there in the first place. If you don't believe in Hell anyway, it's not a scary thing to be threatened with - a bit like saying "If you don't start believing in unicorns, one will trample you to death while you're sleeping." Who would be worried by that?  * It is often self-refuting, depending on the person's description of God. If you believe that God will forgive anyone for anything, or judge people purely on how they lived their life and not what they believed, or that everyone gets to Heaven regardless (unless maybe they were genocidal cannibal serial killers), then the Wager is meaningless. You might as well say "Believe in God, or you'll... erm... go to Heaven anyway." In such a case, it doesn't make a scrap of difference whether the person believes or not.|`|EQUEuXIjaa	Perhaps. But if there isn't a god, then you guys are just wasting your time, and screwing yourself daily.|`|tl2pMkOcaa	****DrInK****    sip*    nope...    We're not screwed because we held truth to the highest standard and still came up with no GOD.

It assumes there only options are one specific sect of Christianity and atheism are the only two choices. That is know as a false dicotomy. It also assumes there are no detriments one gains through being part of a religion. I would say wasting every Sunday of your life to prayer is pretty detrimental.

They live in other neighborhoods.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	haha i live in NY and trust me i don't live in no fancy high class apartment.|`|FKxrJxbPaa	Lol heres the thing      MOST if not all hipsters are not New Yorkers at all...theyre just rich weirdos from other states who move here tryin to "find themselves" while their parents pay for all of their stuff. They sit around all day doin absolutely nothing except try to act cool on purpose, and they contribute little to anything. They move to ethnic neighborhoods and push residents out, they crowd the freakin L train all the time, and they just basically inconvenience real New Yorkers for no reason.     No they aint starvin' artists like you...they fakes and their whole way of life basically mocks you.     I hate them.|`|GPznIhzMaa	Crapbag is right. A lot of them are transplants and their expenses are paid for by their parents. They might dress like starving artists but their wallets would say otherwise. They're one of the reasons why you can no longer find a 1-bedroom apartment in the East Side for under $1,000. The real starving artists (like myself) live in Brooklyn and the other boroughs.
ykusYpp4aa	Yeah that's whack. Why don't you ask the employee with the "special arrangement" what exactly the "special arrangement" is. And whether you two are getting paid the same amount. You're not as likely to get fired if you ask the employee. If he goes to your employers and says you've been discussing pay, just deny it.     And the LMAO guy doesn't realize I'm reporting all his sexist comments because he is probably half brain dead, but I am.|`|Fk9RN6taaa	maybe he's sleeping with the boss.|`|i0OVwfcyaa	Leave 1-2 minutes earlier and file a complaint with HR if it bothers you that much.

c2915bc290fa940289d9aeb2affb3612aa	Those on the video are NOT half naked --- They ARE dress properly for a proper workout.  They are wearing attire that will help evaporate the sweat off the bodies and allow their "trainer" or workout "coach" to see any moves that are being done "wrong."      I guess one can blame Richard Simmons and his videos for "encouraging' those uncomfortable with leotards and tights in the gym to wear sweats.  But that's okay also - as you should wear want comfortable and safe.  Don't want any clothing to get caught in the equipment and injure you .    Hi cut leotards and bikinis?  GREAT eye candy, as long as you ladies enjoy that extra attention, well, GO FOR IT!  If you don't, that's understandable also.|`|8U16bBrRaa	It works for me.  Gyms now seem just as much pick up spots as gyms.  Personally, I think it would make me work out just a bit harder.  Call it good motivation!  Go for it.|`|AA10025824	No, that's most of the reason why you work out, so you'll look good half naked, so go ahead.|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	I guess not.|`|f9uBsiosaa	just wear nothing nd workout at my house. i will even help u with ur strechting|`|SjNjtmCjaa	sports bra and short = okay.  leotard = crime against humanity.|`|1wb9rotSaa	it would be okay if the butt wasen't exposed so much|`|5eMXtgRTaa	I've never had a problem with women working out half naked.|`|cwqB4j0uaa	depends on what ur wearing but normally your supposed to have on clothes or sweats or something so that  can sweat|`|hHGNE0IRaa	The only thing that determines this is societal standards. It is unfortunately considered "bad" to dress certain ways in our culture. But some people get scared by their bodies.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	Many gyms have a dress code, but I would guess probably not all.  It seems to me that people who dress as skimpy as possible aren't there to work out, but there to be looked at working out.  It's a heavily ego-ed activity.  If it bothers you, ask the gym if they have a dress code or if they would consider instituting one.|`|OfGSF2vmaa	No, you can go to the Gym in a Leotard.   I have seen people do it.     Maybe not a bikini but you can try...if not   try a low cut shirt and maybe short short's.|`|pOLBKKNpaa	the camel wasn't working out, just watching, that's probably the danger right there|`|GZCmyzBYaa	i do, not for the sex just because when you sweat it feels a lot better to be half dressed than in sweat pants(but not like that girl! usually really short shorts that i probably shouldn't wear because they are THAT short and a baggy shirt or sports bra) the gym i used to go to they used to have rules and stuff on what to wear and when i moved it felt so good to wear short stuff!|`|AA10241709	At home, no, it's not bad at all.    At the gym, yes, a bit.  Not all people wanna see your stuff.    Let's not forget that if we allow an in shape, attractive woman come to the gym half naked, then we must permit an out of shape, unattractive woman to wear it too.  I have no problem with this myself, but I think the protest will begin at the first sight of 300 lbs woman wearing a 2-piece on a treadmill.|`|GqfiRXu3aa	That workout fashion has been out of style for many years now.   So yes, it is wrong to wear that to the gym.    By the way, I love your Jane Fonda avatar pic.  Her workouts are the best!|`|JSFCkne8aa	no|`|FlvUVPMWaa	No. I wouldn't mind if you came in wearing NOTIHING at all.|`|kyTU7yEbaa	hahaha I love it! Let's bring it back into trend!|`|IE9NfLGoaa	Nope|`|vm5TgsQwaa	No its fine. Many people just don't feel comfortable with men looking at them like that. But I think its fine I do it|`|Uu4vUvexaa	no  you choose your clothes here we are not fascist|`|KLg658F3aa	No, as long as the girls look good, toned.|`|cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	thats  no more  or  less  than  you  would  wear  on  any  public  beach. I dont  see a  problem personally.as  long  as  the  suit  fits  properly  and  you  arent  bouncing  out  of  it. and  as  long  as  everything  stays  covered  down  below.    butif  your  butt looks  practically  naked  and  you  are bending  over forward  it  would  be  inappropriate.    how  about  that  suit  with  a  wrap  around  the  waist|`|AA11788494	no|`|F3nlVXJ5aa	I can only speak from a woman's point of view on this.  (I don't go see utube films).  It used to be that women could dress how they wanted to as long as they were only with other women and that the social event was in the proper mode and venue but once gays and bixexuals came along the rules changed and were inappropriate and a dress code appeared.  So it's inappropriate behavior to exercise in front of other women while other women are half naked or naked.      It's good that the old rules still apply.  Certainly at home, in your own room, by yourself you can do what you like.|`|8mzaGn0Baa	there s nothing wrong with it|`|KKh8rikGaa	Yesterday, do it.  Today,no way. Tomorrow it may be considered ok to be fully naked. Society is soooo screwed, soooo many weirdo's anymore|`|YSuc7L8taa	Shorts and tee's appear to be the standard at most gyms now as they are far more comfortable then the attire shown in the video.|`|13acbbda76f58a1231e0892dba3e725faa	You know I wondered the same thing many times. You can get away with it on a beach why not in a gym?  I wouldn't mind wearing less myself. The short shorts with muscel shirt. All he gys and girls wear those track suits.  I think people would want to work out more if they had to wear less. As for the people who are out of shape...well even in the 80's they still covered up.|`|hR1HHCzRaa	If you are proud of your figure (and not seriously deluded about it of course!) you should be able to wear whatever you want so long as it's appropriate. Those styles are clearly work out gear for fit athletic people. I say keep wearing them so long as your body lets you get away with it|`|uWLYsYwoaa	you are great more people need to dress like that|`|htt20JRAaa	yes|`|Llvro4h5aa	Not at all very regular|`|4KocdJt4aa	I think they don't dress like that because at one point they were sick of getting stared at all the time.    Its your choice, who cares what anyone thinks, but just look around the gym when you do it and notice all the old guys looking at you.    Do you like old guys looking at you or something? Thats kind of weird..|`|WZvH3aHwaa	Yeah that's a little too much. That's okay on the beach but not in a public gym. Wear something tat won't attract the attention of guys.|`|lgMAN1Kkaa	WTF . N0|`|tYvf7YK6aa	To be honest i would not want to check out some girl working out right in front of me wearing almost nothing.. sorry.|`|GT0hOEGhaa	I am against clothing any day of the year. MEAN IT!  I wouldn't mind it, as I don't mind a nudist beach. The accumulated sweat is no good and stinks.|`|DieXW1VPaa	no are you kidding thats the only way girls should work out|`|AA12351099	no not really, as long as you don't weigh like 300 pounds....    One thing i can't stand is people that weigh like 350 pounds coming into the body building gym i go to wearing absolute skin tight spandex, and doing like 50 reps of something that weighs next to nothing....    rant off lmfao.    anyway back to your question, no its fine|`|b5184ff2ec1ca13b698a969bd675c543aa	no|`|wq9qCs2Gaa	well you have to remember, that was the 80's.   now-a-days, some people may think that is not appropriate, but it is really up to you.  personally, i wouldnt walk into the gym dressed like that, but i do wear short shorts with a sports bra.|`|AA10434137	In your case I would start out wearing as little as you desire but have with you something to slip on if conditions seem you should.  OR    start off in a 'dressed'  attire and take off what seems right for the conditions.  ie. shorts over a bikini bottom / sweat shirt over a halter type top etc.  In other words, be prepared to suit up for current conditions.  (maybe naked would be ok at times?)|`|S51Eo3Y9aa	No, in fact I recomend it.|`|nal4QuKvaa	nothing wrong at all with women working out half naked, or even completely naked!
AA10025824	Probably because someone who is looking for sympathy is an easy target.??   Tables always turn, Karma rules, they'll get theirs soon enough.|`|1JSblCBsaa	Because humans strive for perfection so being needy is considered a flaw and wanting sympathy is seen as selfish and self indulgent. In which case people will react angrily because they are not attracted or inspired by what you've said, so they have the opposite reaction of praise.|`|98GbovYTaa	because people are bitter...and want to break you down because they have a crappy life and have to take it out on everybody or whoever they think is better than them...anyway don't bother looking for sympathy..why would you even want sympathy..off worthless peopleeeeee  what i want to know is why people always seeem to think i want their goddamn sympathy ..**** off and die  noone cares about anything really..i have realised and i don't care either|`|36UDdHFzaa	it's just tough love nothing more... :)    what doesn't kill you makes you stronger|`|mFf8CqAraa	If you're referring to the people on Yahoo! Answers (being rude), it's because the majority of them are children. I really think Y!A needs to be divided into an adult and teen section to ensure people get serious mature answers.|`|AA11984147	Unfortunately, the world in which we live has changed tremendously from the caring, and loving society that I once knew.  People don't have time for one another - can't stop to listen and offer help.  You're on your own.      I feel for people who have lost the ability to love and show compassion for others.  Now that you recognize this frailty, you have the obligation to 'not' be one of those others, but be a person of love and compassion.|`|gCW30ejoaa	Cuz there is no face to it...sorry, but that is the cold had truth...|`|MTJs95Emaa	Some people just don't care about your problems and don't want to hear about it because they have too many problems of their own.|`|0kWsC3Uhaa	Sometimes it feels like an imposition ... like the person who is after sympathy wants more than just a kind word from the person they are complaining to.  Or sometimes you have no idea what to say, and feel scared, so you have a strong negative reaction to get that person to go away.|`|F3nlVXJ5aa	If a person looks for sympathy they need to look to members of their own family.  If they want answers to a problem then they can ask them in Yahoo Q&A.
AA12006309	If they are prepubescent, it would be pedophilia.  Typically that would be considered under age 12.  Between ages 12 and 18 it would be called ephebophilia.

suSWUm5Jaa	I did not know the website that Clare just mentioned, http://www.frenchtutorial.com/. It looks pretty good and is free.  You can find a lot of stuff on the internet. Often it is free and there is a reason for that. You get what you pay for. The best value for your money is Rocket French Language. Very useful and well structured program that you either download or buy the CDs and books (that may be over your budget). You will reach a good level pretty fast if you follow the course and work on it 15 or 20 minutes every day. There are 2 keys to learn a language: consistency and fun. You are in charge of the commitment and Rocket provides the serious though fun material.     Bonne chance!|`|5ofS2qQYaa	look into your local library! I'm serious! there're so many resources there...  great for starters and then online tools to keep you practicing    also, it helps to listen to French music and read french short stories or something    immerse yourself     :)|`|O7w6XGqPaa	try french.about.com|`|Nt1IQGkfaa	I recommend Rosetta Stone for a paying program, but it's best if you can actually interact with someone speaking the language.  Try and find a tutor who can video chat with you, or Skype with you.    If you aren't worried about security, I would go on Skype and select the 'Skype Me' status.  You will instantly be bombarded with people all around the world wanting to talk to you.  Pretend to be French, and try to decipher the messages you get back.  Maybe ask them for some help with grammar.  It's free, but not necessarily reliable.
CiCKFa8Qaa	I heard that they were related to Japanese and Koreans. I've also heard that they have language connections with the Ural-Altaic family, which happens to include Hungarian.|`|tlUihEOvaa	They are definitely different, they don't have big established communities like other Asians. They had smaller communities they associate with called tribes.     Also many Mongols weren't good at writing.     See after they conquered a huge part of the world, they failed to establish a stable government. They only knew how to conquer.    The Mongolians were seen as uncivilized barbarians because of some of their customs and the way they treated others.|`|EXurNsB4aa	I won't bash you!  It's not like Mongol culture is common knowledge for Westerners or anything.  I'm no expert myself but I do know a few things.    The main influence on modern Mongolian culture is the old Mongol nomadic way of life.  Russia, Tibet, and China also influenced culture there.  I think you have to take into consideration that Western China can be a lot different from Eastern China.   China is a really big place with a lot of history and culture.  Mongolia is very far away from Japan and Korea.  There is not a ton of overlap there, aside from what they have in common via China.    Mongolia has gone through phases of being taken over by the Chinese and by the Russians.  Makes sense since it's wedged between them.  For a while, Tibetian buddhism  was the dominant religion in Mongolia.  When the Russians/Stalinists took over, the dominant faith was forced out.    The geographical situation in Central Asia is what shapes the culture of Mongolia and other central Asian countries.  It's been modified because of outside countries taking it over, but the nomadic lifestyle is what Mongolian culture is built around.    I'm sorry, that's all I really know, which isn't much.  But I think you should look up some info on your own.|`|Dv5HiSSraa	Mongols conquered the Chinese twice. And no, Mongols speak Uralic, which is a different language family compared to the Chinese.

But feeling sad for a long while is unnecessary and you shouldn't dwell on it. If you are Christian then you will believe that he was in some form related/near/is/etc. god, so don't worry about it. =)
nwRBiyMFaa	Okay, here we go:     Das war ein Befehl! Der Steiner-Angriff war ein Befehl! Wer sind Sie eigentlich, dass Sie einen Befehl, den ich gebe, zu missachten wagen? Soweit ist es also nun gekommen? Diese Armee hat mich angelogen! Alle haben mich angelogen. Sogar die SS! Unsere Gener?le sind nichts als ein Haufen ver?chtlicher, untreuer Feiglinge! Sie sind Feiglinge, Verr?ter und Versager. Unsere Gener?le sind der Abschaum des deutschen Volkes. Kein Funke von Ehre! Die nennen sich selbst Gener?le. Jahrelange Schulungen an milit?rischen Akademien, nur um zu lernen, wie man ein Messer und eine Gabel richtig h?lt! ber Jahre hat die Armee meine Pl?ne zunichte gemacht. Sie haben mir jedes Hindernis in den Weg gestellt, dass sie finden konnten! Ich sollte alle hochrangigen Offiziere liquidieren, genauso wie Stalin es getan hat! Ich habe nie eine Akademie besucht und habe trotzdem alleine ganz Europa in die Knie gezwungen.      I need to say though, that I translated it the way it makes sense, and not word by word (but almost). I am not sure, if it is exactly like in the original (German) version of the movie, but I'm sure it's very similar.  No online translator :-)      Oh, I just found the clip on youtube, with this scene, so I'm gonna write it down for you, just the way, they say it:  So you have both versions, my one and the movie-version :-).  Here we go:    "Das war ein Befehl! Der Angriff >Steiner    Here's the link if you'd like to have it  http://de.youtube.com/watch?v=h6CFA0Ia9q...    Hope I could help you!|`|86bXaY3Waa	You want ONLY Germans to translate this? So no Austrians, Swiss, Namibians, Luxembourgish or Liechtensteinians allowed?

Wer sind Sie das sie meinen Befehl verweigern. So weit ist es also gekommen. Das Milit?r hat mich belogen, sogar die SS.Alle Gener?le sind ein Pack von nidertr?chtigen , treuloser Feiglinge. Sie sind Feigline, nutzlose Versager. Alle Gener?le sind eine Schande frs Deutsche Volk. Sie sind ohne Ehre. Sie nennen sich Gener?le weil sie Jahre in der Milit?r Academy zugebracht haben nur um zu Lernen wie man Messer und Gabel h?lt. Jahre lang hat das Milit?r meine Pl?ne verhindert. Mann hat mir jedes bisschen Hinderniss in den weg gelegt. Ich hatte gut daran getahn alle Gener?le zu Liquidieren, so wie stalin.   Ich war nie auf einer Academy und doch habe ich allein, allein auf mich gestellt, Europe erobert.    That was it, its from the Movie! I hope i can Help, but when i can ask why do you wont learn it!

I can only imagine how badly these people's lives must be for them to try to pull the faithful in Christ down to their level.

Christians: "Yes, we're from the Reformed Twice Removed Full Gospel Church of the Risen Black Jesus... - and we want you to believe what we believe, so you won't be tortured in Hell for eternity!" (smile)...    John: "Boy! I don't want to be tortured at all! What do I have to believe?!?!"    Christians: "It's really simple. You have to believe that you are unacceptable because this Book says so - and it doesn't matter whether you're good or bad, 'cause A really really really big and powerful being invented you - and since you are not as big or as powerful, you are bad. You are bad because your great, great, great, great, great... Grandparent's disobeyed this big, big, being!    PLUS! You have to believe that this being is composed of three parts and these three parts are one being and that one of these beings became a man, like you, over 2,000 years ago and walked on water and turned perfectly good water into an adult beverage!    This was a mere man, but at the same time, this book says that the "fullness of the Godhead was in him..."    You have to turn away from your evil ways - even though you are not judged because you're evil, but by your faith instead - and you have to read this book all the time and let it magically transform you, as you believe it.    If you do not believe this book, you will be choosing to go to Hell, where you'll be tortured by the ruler of all evil - The Devil- forever!    He will torture you because God will tell him to like he did Job. Or Maybe the Devil just likes to torture people forever, either way,    If you believe like we do, you get love, peace, healing, streets of Gold, mansions, heaven, happiness forever, etc,etc, etc...    If you do not believe like we do, you get tortured, horror, nightmares, and Hell!!!!!    So as you can see, it's really an easy choice, isn't it????"    John: "So you hold these beliefs strongly?"

It doesn't have to be said in a rude way, but it sounds blasphemous to some believers.  People hear what they want to hear.  And religious people often interpret things their own way, regardless of what is meant.

I've been out quite a while as I'm 16 next thursday (yayy) and have been with my girlfriend since 2007 so since I was 14    I get tonnes of crap for it, so does my girlfriend but it's worth it for love. Our friends are very supportive although she came out at 13 and found her then friends where not so supportive, two faced yes, but no not supportive.     If you want to talk you can message me or something and add on msn and talk as I know how hard it is, my dad told me to find my own way to hell, so yeah. It's going to be hard. But I personally feel more open and free now that people know.    hope this helped.    remember true friends usually already know, or accept you and wonder why they diddnt.    illeona x

Bisexuals may prefere one sex or the other but are attracted to both. Bi-curious girls just tend to do things with other girls to 'see what its like' or please men or just because of peer pressure (as alot of teens these days are now Bisexual but really have not become sure that they do infact have real emotional and sexual feelings towards both sexes)    I hope this helped.    It sounds like she's either Bi-curious or Bisexual and just not entirely faithful or looking for a real meaningful same sex emotional and sexual relationship.(But obviously I'm just guessing from what you've said)    x
AA10533811	It's a stereotype. But let me show you my point of view.  And not to be judgmental on gays but --  I know this bisexual guy who constantly stirs up trouble no matter how nice you try to be towards him. He hangs out with girls, flirts with guys and always seems to be into being dramatic.  So maybe theatre guys are sometimes gays because they essentially like drama and are dramatic themselves. Have you noticed that gays usually have that certain "voice," and are emotional and dramatic as women?  I know that not all gays and bisexuals are like this. Again this is a stereotype but most gays I met are like this so maybe this is why they are into theater.|`|lUuxrGAtaa	Just a stereyotype hun. Be urself|`|l8c2kTlvaa	I go to drama outside of school and none of the guys were openly gay, they all seemed pretty straight, but I don't know - I can't tell if someones gay or not :)|`|ohWdv6iHaa	The "gays in performing arts" generalization is just a stereyotype... While some men involved in theatre are gay, many aren't, so you can't assume a guy is gay just because he is in theatre.|`|AyEkA6Flaa	Straight guys can enjoy theater also, but I do think a higher percentage of guys into theater are gay, just as I also think a higher percentage of guys into music are gay.    It may be a stereotype, but sometimes a stereotype has a bit of truth to it.|`|HzmKMLEqaa	nah its just a stereotype in mine you have to take it (therefore there are some st8's)  im bi but im in art not all guys in art are gay either|`|nJIS1NMQaa	Well in  my drama class i can completly say that the 10 guys in the class are all straight except for maybe 3. and those are just guesses. but just get to know the guy and maybe he is.

What motivates me when everyone has let me down is that I have but one short turn on this world and then I end.  I want to leave this world a better place.

Big deal! Everything does let you down sometimes. I'm grown-up enough to cope with that, and I don't need religion to help me.|`|hYzfzu9yaa	Wow. You know, I place a lot more worth on the people in my life than that.     I don't have "faith" in the way believers have faith in gods. But I do have hope and trust and dreams. I look forward to seeing my children grow, to visiting my family, to finishing a project... I have faith in my husband, I trust him. And I am faithful to him.     YES, I have self-worth. So what if I let myself down. Does that mean I'm worthless? No. It means I'm human, just like everyone else, and when I mess up, I learn from it, become a little more knowledgeable, and move on.    YES, my family. I have a strong family. We don't fight like dogs in a cage. We are a strong and loving unit. We stand together, we help each other, we depend on each other. Yeah, there are disagreements, but we also love each other and know that no matter what, we can get through anything.    I don't have a job because my husband makes enough to support our family. His position is secure, and even if he were to lose it, we have so much in savings and other accounts we'll be fine. Yay for being rich, huh?    When things get rough, I turn to my husband, my mother, my family, my friends. I am not alone. I have many wonderful people who will help me if I need them, and whom I will not hesitate to help if they need me. My husband loves me no matter what. He believes in me. He supports me. He motivates me.     I believe in my children. Even if they do not believe in me. What kind of mother would I be if I did not? I love them unconditionally. Even if they one day turn their backs on me, I will love them and believe in them.     YOU think about it. Is your life so sad and shallow that you must rely on "gods" to get your through?

If you mean faith defined as trust, which can be based on evidence, then yes I trust others, based on evidence tho.    "Yourself" - I trust myself based on the evidence that I have done good previously and my ability to do so.    "Your Family" - I trust my family based on the evidence they have shown me with their prior actions.    "Your Job" - I trust my job will pay me, based on the evidence that I got payed last week, or the evidence that a payment was agreed upon.    "Who picks you up when you fall" - If someone had never helped me when I was down, it would be unfounded to trust that they would. If they had in the past, based on that evidence, the chances would be better.    "Who believes in their child even when their child does not believe in them" - To trust that ones human nature, education  and emotional bonding will influence them in their decisions is based on the evidence that it has for millions of others.    Overall, to believe something will happen/exist based on no evidence at all(the type of faith required to believe in a deity) is absurd.|`|DDFgKxcaaa	faith is a cop out, wishful thinking, self delusion.  faith is playing mind games with oneself|`|9SH8m1fEaa	To answer all of your questions...

I just can't believe there's someone watching over me and protecting me when I have a drunken abusive father. I also can't believe in this "god" because of the starving children in third world countries. The way you talk about god it just seems like you need someone to reassure you everything will be ok. I don't need that...I believe in myself and I will get myself through with my friends and loved ones.

IIsByPj6aa	I do, I really don't know how to stop it...  I sort of relish the feeling.  Anytime I see a good film or tv show it leaves me feeling detached from the world around me, because I was too much involved with what I was watching.  The feeling usually subsides in an hour or so, but it leaves me with a deep introspection, where I can just look into myself and wonder.  I think it's a beautiful ability, to have such empathy that these things can leave you with such feelings and impressions.|`|p6qF7YdKaa	oh god yes...

ADSy8my4aa	If you really want a tattoo with your kids' names, I advise you to use the original English forms. They sound better, for one, and you can't translate Maggie directly into Hungarian anyway.    Maggie is the short form of Margaret. Margaret is Margit in Hungarian, but it's obviously not the same as Maggie and probably no one could make the connection between those two names.    Elijah is either Ills or lis. I think, Ills sounds more Hungarian.

u6K5TtRlaa	It means that you're awesome. Gay guys are only interested in really cool girls, because they're all usually clamoring to be around us. Think about it: every girl wants a gaybuddy, and most gays usually have lots of faghags. If you're so special that they hang around you prettymuch all the time, as close friends, that means that you are, indeed, pretty special. I'm sorry they're getting in the way, but you might wanna ask yourself:     What does that say about what kinda guys YOU are looking for?    If they're all turning out gay, it looks like you might be looking for some "safe" relationships. Don't be afraid to take risks in guys, because we're not all either stupid or gay. If you keep on trying, you'll find a heterosexual sometime.|`|ULrDXaciaa	well most girls have gay friends and most gay guys have friends who are girls..... seem simple to me lol|`|d5d47806aa18d6ba2b4ff197c5930c9aaa	No type of girls attract gay guys ! :)|`|uGIIR9Beaa	You may simply like feminine guys.

AA10601065	Losers of each hand have to remove an article of clothing. Just like Strip Poker.    Unless you mean this question in the literal sense. If you want to play Naked Poker literally, then everybody gets naked and you play poker. But that's no fun. It's more fun when losers of each hand have to take something off.|`|rUgC7SPsaa	Sounds like your husband was losing...|`|fcsTUFDLaa	u lose u strip one thing|`|z7BTeUKvaa	Do you really think we're THAT stupid?|`|758f1c16f8aa9b1d1195f3f7d3415ca4aa	that's strip poker. and all you do is strip something off when you lose... Or you can play a variation where you bet an item of clothing and if you lose, you have to give up that item (or items if you bet more) and if you win you could put the item of clothes back on (so if they bet a shirt, you can put your shirt on, if they bet jeans, you can put your jeans on, if they bet more than one item, you can put those items back on...|`|60NJNjEpaa	poke-her!? i barely know her! hahahahahahhaaa.... i crack myself up.    and it looks to me like your hubby was doing something he shouldn't have been.    but with ever hand lost, the player must remove one article of clothing.|`|ZsujbEjJaa	instread of losing money, u lose ur clothes|`|oVcY7Bynaa	yea that dude broke it down very well  lose and u take one thing off until ur left with nothing on =]|`|uF3LK4ICaa	i'd say your husband was cheating on you with this girl! especially if they were shocked when you came in! how can you be so naive!|`|XrViVeqPaa	I'm no expert...but I would swear that you just lied to us. Shame on you.|`|f5XwQEjyaa	Actually, it's called strip poker, not naked poker.  See, what you do is you play regular poker, say, Texas Hold 'Em? So, when you put your betting money in, instead you put an item of clothing, then the other person will see, check, fold, etc. and if they check, they put in the same amount of clothing, say if you put in your T-shirt, they put theirs in, too. Whoever wins that hand has to put both items of clothing on, or just theirs, it's their choice.  That's the way I was taught.  The other way is it's all regular poker, but at the end of each hand, the loser must take off an item of clothing of any kind and hand hand it to the dealer.  Make sense?  Hop this helps, have fun!  Make sure your husband loses, you'll be turned on for sure! ;)  And by the way, ask this in the "I THINK MY HUSBAND IS CHEATING ON ME OR HE IS A CHILD MOLESTER WHAT SHOULD I DO?" category.

It should be How have you been? Answers could range from: I've been good, Fine, Alright, or just plain Good.|`|bIouq64Oaa	First of all, "How you been" is not proper grammar. it should be "How have you been?" But unfortunately we lazy Americans seem to have butchered our own language.    Secondly, neither of your options for answering are correct. The proper response would be, "I am well," because you need an adverb to describe the verb "am," not an adjective, such as "good." This is also a common mistake in the spoken English language.    Hope this helps!|`|7FlqCm4aaa	Well if someone ask you - How are you? You may answer - Fine thanks, how about you?|`|4265888b0ef5f48426618135bcb6a43faa	Good to see you. How you been?

P0fcmrkSaa	Languages consists of  vocabulary - words, what to say,   grammar - how to connect the words each to other, how to use them..  phonems (phonetics) - how to pronounce it...

It's a part of this cultura and the culture is a part of the language.|`|AA10948829	Sounds and rules, basically.|`|6SwaWSoyaa	It consists of words and punctuation that is used to get a message through and so you can communicate back or understand what is going on. This is probably the most vague question I have ever seen.|`|NYr4p2qEaa	phonemes:  sounds  morphemes:  a combination of sounds to make words  syntax:  an understood grammatical arrangement of those words|`|TEW2oCF2aa	Language is a form of communication developed over years by people of a particular region. They slowly developed words and formed sentences for their daily needs and functions and when they moved from one area to another they borrowed words from other people and slowly the languages developed. They initially talked and then found letters and started writing.Words were found for different things. Then Sentences were made using the words. Finally they started regulating and controlling the language using grammars.    So the language consists of letters, words, sentences, grammar, writing and vocabulary. Phonetics developed later to regulate how the words and sentences should be spoken.

This has happened with me I was jealous because she had a boyfriend and I didn't. It takes awhile to realize who you are jealous of.      If you are a lesbian/bisexual it's nothing to be afraid or ashamed of. I went through an experience where I wondered if I was a lesbian/bisexual. It's just about finding out who you are. It's a really hard thing to go through.     Good luck!|`|AA11117030	I went through that once too. This girl I was talking told me that she dated this guy I liked, and that she knew certain things about him, and asked her how and she said "because I f***** him"...

Perhaps you are jealous of the guy with the girl because you would much rather that she be with you than him.|`|defde0b6e42848179471ab740c517f46aa	Awwww, that does sound confusing.  I'm sorry :(  It's really hard to say exactly who you're jealous of without knowing more.  I guess you have to ask yourself which one bothers you more, the idea of your best friend kissing someone, or the idea of this guy kissing someone?  Figure out which one causes you more discomfort, and that should probably help answer your question.  Good luck!|`|NlWSj3OWaa	which one do u fantasize over?  u may just b feeling left out.  when u close your eyes and daydream do u c a male or female?  im thinkin u might just b feeling left out.

You have to rouse your soul to speak, and know how to speak from the depths of your soul to convince the critter to get thee hence.     That is why the Catholics have specially trained exorcists. That is why Faust had so much trouble with the devil. Even Jesus, in the New Testament had to turn His full undevided attention to the process. Dont know about you, but He was a lot more skillful than most people I know.     Too much prayer will just draw on more demons. They will see it as a challenge. Too little prayer and no one out there will hear you. The key is in balance. Live a good life, Love, Laugh, and pray. But in balance.     If you are in the MIDST of having a demon on the kitchen table, that is a whole different story. You may need to ask a minister, priest or rabbi, or imam to help out.

tUaAmXvsaa	My heart goes out to you.  It is very difficult.  I am in a somewhat similar position.  The toss between religion and one's sexuality.  I have family in your situation.  The guy want to live his Christian beliefs by people make it impossible for him.  I say to you what I say to him.  Live it.  People are going to say so much but, in the end let him who has no sin cast the first stone.  The Bible says we should stone adulterous women.  To me that was then.  Do we do it today?  NO!  I am not saying you are right but, only those in your position can truly understand.  May God bless you.  You are right He is forgiving.

If you find that you love somebody to death.  I mean, truly and honestly, that you care so deeply for someone that you'd give your life for them, then how can you say anymore that your sexuality isnt authentic.  Truth is, its just as valid as any other.  Love.  The pinnacle experience of all human beings, in all of its forms, its authenticity should never be discounted.  Even when it doesnt conform to the given spiritual/societal norms.|`|ohWdv6iHaa	Well, what you should do in this situation is evaluate which religion conforms more to your beliefs and ideals... you are not too "unclean" to be a part of either of the aforementioned religious groups, you just need to decide which group would be better for your lifestyle.|`|S1yswNmoaa	well its socitey forcing to conform someone to be straight thats why you might feel weird and really i think you should have a religion that fits your sexuality but i know jewish people who happen to be gay its okay dont try to feel weird we have free will i mean you can be a gay zionist and why are you feeling weird being gay doesnt hurt anyone and god loves all his children and dont worry at all okay

CLB32006aa	LOL it is not a religious saying basically the opposite. Diderot's statement about abuse in civilized society is supposed to say something about his own so called "civilized" society allowing abuse to women to happen. It is a critique of his own society lol not advice.     Back in the 1700's when the Dan Diderot said this pretty much everything was controlled by the government and church. He said that we cannot be free until religion and totalitarian governments are eliminated. Have we moved past religious and government totalitarianism? Look around you and you can see that we are not yet free    Men will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest- Dan Diderot    Hope this helps  Keep thinking :)|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Diderot was one of history's finest idiots. One learns a lot about the difference between smarts and niceness from him.    He also said :  Evil always turns up in this world through some genius or other.  Denis Diderot    If there is one realm in which it is essential to be sublime, it is in wickedness. You spit on a petty thief, but you can't deny a kind of respect for the great criminal.  Denis Diderot     My ideas are my whores.  Denis Diderot     HE REGULARLY DRIFTED IN TO PURE INANITY  The possibility of divorce renders both marriage partners stricter in their observance of the duties they owe to each other. Divorces help to improve morals and to increase the population.  Denis Diderot     There is no kind of harassment that a man may not inflict on a woman with impunity in civilized societies.

But some of the things you hunt, trap etc. might be extinct from over trapping, hunting etc. if not for the extremist views of peta members and other conservation lobbyist.|`|JXMVNEQoaa	theyre a bunch of liberal idiots|`|jfwmelYgaa	PETA are basically your run of the mill douche bags....I agree that dogs shouldn't be skinned alive in china and pitbulls shouldn't be used for fighting but they take **** too far.|`|Uwad1Irmaa	because they are snooty snobs that want to dictate their views on the world, in a disgustingly offensive manner|`|4wnPK7Uaaa	I am a vegetarian but yes I do think the PETA, is doing a good cause telling people of what animals have to go through. But you can't just shove your beliefs down people's throats.|`|WO1jgqWqaa	Because they are liberal elistist snobs who are trying to pump everyone full of liberal guilt. I am completely against hunting for sport; I believe that it is wrong for an an animal to die just so that some jerk can have it's head on his wall. Having said that, I see nothing wong with killing an animal for meat so that you can put food on the table.|`|8840f90d1236990da5c34043fc11245faa	Self-righteous twats who care more about shock publicity than they do about real issues like bears in China, dolphin slaughters in Japan the Orangutans in Indonesia they don't go after the big boys they pick on the little farmers or circus owners in other words they pick off the easy game.

Wear what you want.  It doesn't seem like anyone has a problem with it all except for in your mind.    lol...I have been on here all day and this is the best one yet.  I laughed and laughed thankyou!!!!|`|QPGyZEozaa	Not really sure what your question is.      What you wear in your own house is no one's business but your own.  It was so hot the other day I cleaned my bedroom in my bra and panties, I'm not ashamed of it.  I also shower nude.      Worrying about what other people think brings you down, live life the way you want to and let the others hang.  Find friends who don't judge.   The bibles said "do not judge, lest you be judged", as a Christian I find some many Christians hypercritical as they are the most judgemental people around.  They are always holier than thou.  Make your own peace with God.
vRPqfdlaaa	They don't teach anyone what it is or how to use it. Government prefers dumming down. Easier for them to control society when society is made up of fools.|`|T1OFtmB5aa	If a person is raised well, they develop common sense.  Unfortunately because of kids home by themselves because Mom and/or Dad have to work two jobs each to make a living they don't have a role model in most cases.   Or their parents are bad role models.  There is even "common law" which is based off of common sense or what most sensible people would do in a given situation.  It can also be a narrow minded way of thinking as well.|`|XNGRQlmDaa	Well there was at one time a thing called common sense, however I believe that it died at about the same time that our school systems stopped teaching deductive reasoning, in any shape or form. Simple problem solving has become a thing of the past.     The other big problem is that the youth of today have Absolutely no imagination. Ask a kid today to come up with a story off the top of their head, and they will stare at you blankly, like you've just grown a second head. The very idea of someone actually thinking through a problem, and coming up with a reasonable solution through basic reasoning is as dead as the dodo bird with the majority of society today.      I think that the last generations that really showed what we refer to as common sense would have to be those who went through the great depression, and as we all know they are dying off quickly.      Thankfully there are a few people left that still understand common sense and how to use it. The long term solution would be to have people stop watching so much TV, stop playing so many video games and start reading, and using (dare I say it) their imaginations. It still exists, however it should be referred to as uncommon sense.|`|VWdNoTM1aa	"Common Sense" can change depending on your environment.    For example, if you are attending a computer tech school, creating a basic page in HTML will be considered "common sense".    --------------------------------------...    "Common Sense" can change depending on your country.    For example, what is "common sense" to a Japanese is not necessarily "common sense" to an American.    For example to an American, it is "common sense" that George Washington is the first president of the U.S.A. However; many Americans do not know any of Japan's leaders.|`|AA10241709	Because there's really no such thing as common sense.    Common sense is what one person thinks everyone should know, but naturally, there's always something that someone doesn't know.

AA10241705	I've never heard any smoker use car emmisions as an excuse to smoke.|`|bXl12I4Baa	These not quite true cars are polluting more the environment than the smokers do.

Smoking pollutes the air as much as us smokers. If you don't like either you should bury yourself in a hole somewhere.Regardless of where you are there are going to be pollutants in the air.|`|vTNWiFPwaa	they don't have a good excuse.|`|kNdVqq0Daa	Smokers are worthless.|`|1EhbLBkUaa	Because they're addicts, and addicts look for any possible justification for doing what they NEED to do. Sad.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	so what about the car it kills a person to smoke it even says that on the package but guess what that is also a human beings right to make choices and do what they want and they have. so there is not much more we can do but bury them in peace when they leave this world. its sad but fact of life.|`|vwTyihvvaa	They are in denial.|`|e9z5oVKPaa	Why do you pollute the air with your idiocy? You can stop driving, just as easy as a smoker can stop smoking. There do I sound as stupid as you?|`|XK6k2UAIaa	No it is not proper analogy they are just trying to make excuses. Because they know what they are doing is harmful but they honestly don't give 2 shits about the rest of us that enjoy breathing clean air. Cars were created as a transportation necessity. Cigarettes were created to make money and that is it. Smoking is a choice. Getting to and from work is a necessity. It's like comparing apples and oranges to me. I hate how they cry we have rights to. Yes you do you have the right to infect your lungs and by all means do so but don't come out in public and take away my right to breath clean air. How is that fair?      Ok cars are not a necessity in this day and age really? OK so someone who works anywhere from 20- 100 miles away is really supposed to ride a bike or walk. That's pretty damn funny. Or when you go to the grocery store to by for your family of 5 you are supposed to just ask the store may I borrow your cart so I can walk 50 miles away to take these grocery's to my family? That's really stupid. Honestly.    To the one a couple answers below Molotov. You know why people don't get in someones face about eating potato chips or a cheeseburger while being over weight? It's because it doesn't affect us. That is not our health its theirs. However smoking there is this little thing called second hand smoke which can affect OTHERS around the damn smokers!    Wow 2 thumbs down already. Hehe pathetic. Come up with a good argument against me instead of thumbs down.|`|qHoWraAaaa	So, how is it that God designated you to point out the faults of everybody else without looking at your own LOG?  Are you perfect?  NO!  Have you ever stole, lied, committed adultery in your heart?  So have we all!  Where is the love of Christ?  Just because you do not smoke, does that make you better than everybody else.  Of course not!  But, just so that you will know, it is not what enters into the mouth of a man that defiles him, it is the impurities that come out of his heart.  God Bless!|`|cYO2jU1Taa	because pollution isnt really the issue, health is.  hope that helped!|`|KzNoxRwbaa	NOBODY WANTS TO BE BLAMED FOR THE END OF THE WORLD HUN|`|ZAppRn5Faa	i think they say these things because there ashamed and disappointed in themselves for smoking|`|dXGvp5sVaa	To be fair, taking a car is also not a necessity, and a cars exhaust is anything but natural. Tobacco is a plant and when it is burned produces smoke, which is more natural then burning gasoline.|`|q6uyloYdaa	One could argue that driving a car is a choice as well. Cars don't run themselves; someone has to make the choice to drive them and cause that pollution, just like a smoker. They could ride a bike instead.|`|CEI3o31Eaa	Because they want to point out the negatives in other things,  so people won't focus on what they're doing?|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	They point to that ridiculous fact because they have no other way of justifying it.  Of course I like to point out that it's not like I have a running car sitting next to me in a restaurant or in my family room or at work.  There are definite links between smoking and respiratory illnesses.  They can ignore them and argue them all they want, but that won't negate the truth of them.|`|G3HxgCmvaa	Smokers are addicted. And they know they are so they look for excuses that make smoking sound like it isnt a bad thing. They know it is and they cant quit smoking because they are addicted and this is their only way to feel like they arent doing anything bad and to rid guilt from themselves.|`|6gOsmzFoaa	Because they merely want to find an excuse, though pointless, for their bad habit.|`|IcHmWDSCaa	Because since they cannot control them selves they try to make smoking sound better so that people won't look at them differently then anyone else they simple blame all the problems on cars so that they have an excuse. Though some do say that their excuse is also that they are just "addicted" maybe they should have listened to friends or the videos you watch in health class and they shouldn't have even started. Its pretty pathetic to me.|`|UtCkgs18aa	To avoid blame|`|gtTg0XOOaa	Maybe because they're sick and tired of the fact that someone can get in their face about health, but can't suggest to that same guy that he needs to drop the potato chips and cheeseburgers for his own health without "crossing the line."  If he drives: is that why its okay? You have a choice to drive. You could walk, or ride a bike.|`|4wnPK7Uaaa	Because they are in denial|`|uauJyxJNaa	Your reasoning is so backwards, I now understand why you responded to my question the way you did.    You have not one ounce of logic between your ears.    I have NEVER heard of ANYONE using the car/cigarette analogy you just made as an excuse for smoking.  However, the fact that you call CAR EXHAUST a 'natural process' shows just how totally bonehead you are.    Babies don't need cigarette smoke to live.  Nor do they need cars to live.  And you don't need cars, either.  No one does.  They are a luxury item people CHOOSE to purchase instead of walking/biking/public transport.  And they are FAR MORE harmful to the environment than all the cigarette smoke put together.  If you don't believe me, look it up, chump.    You must be about 12.|`|bef202d85afc8aa7378d77f3bc4fd7e8aa	Oil companies and the Auto Industry have spent millions, if not billions of dollars, to keep electric cars out of reach and not available to consumers.  People do not 'need' fossil fuel burning cars. It is wrong to suggest exhaust is 'natural'.  Car exhaust is far more dangerous than tobacco smoke. If you're not convinced of that fact, sit in a closed garage with a car running.  Tobacco is not illegal and paranoid people support fascist policies and laws which continually attempt to deny smokers their rights.|`|OQuyxByGaa	because they want to be in the center of negative attention...i don't know|`|1899lYjMaa	What ever vice we choose to have, we also choose to try to justify it. Such is human nature.|`|ES1bhCyIaa	Because they are trying to justify the reasons they smoke, and why it's not such a bad thing.|`|qEsas2Ssaa	They want to make themselves feel better (and stupidity plays a part too).|`|08LAOOgyaa	a car was invented by a smoker a car puts out more chemicals then a sigaret.    try sucking on a sigaret an then on a car exuast and feel the difrince
ajXkKnB0aa	We have been known to push our weight around quite a bit. We also consume something like 25% of the world's resources. If you wanna play tough guy you're gonna make some enemies.    As for your second question, I thought we were supposed to be the melting pot. A little bit of everything.    Alvis, what makes you think DE is American? You are aware that this little community extends around the world, aren't you?|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	People like you who claim it is a christian nation are part of the reason some people don't like your country.    There are many more reasons; this really isn't the place.    To mention just one reason, many in the academic community laugh at america for its very low level of education, especially acceptance of evolution. It's decades behind Europe.|`|8Iqci2tNaa	ROFL!

The US is not a Christian nation and saying so is in no way, shape or form being anti Christian or anti American.  It's stating a fact.  There is a difference between a country being a Christian nation vs being a country formed by Christians.|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	In my humble opinion, America is losing its status as a "Christian" nation. How can we be a Christian nation when so many people are rejecting God?|`|zZxX5PXBaa	Alvis, I promise, I can't be sure if you're trolling, so I'm going to try and give you the basics on the assumption you're not.    1. Look at your budget. You spend more on weapons and the military than just about the rest of the world put together. You operate military bases on more territory belonging to other nations than any other country by far, and believe me, mostly that is not with the consent of the people.    2. Your soldiers are not subject to international law, in the way that the soldiers of virtually any other country are, so they go unpunished for war crimes (and EVERY country has soldiers that commit war crimes).    3. You have repeatedly sent your soldiers into combat with rules of engagement saying, and I quote 'shoot anything that moves'. In the UK, for instance, soldiers have a card issued for each combat arena, telling them exactly when they may and may not fire, for instance, 'you may return fire only when fired upon, and only with a well aimed shot at a target clearly holding a weapon'. One of the results of this is that you have more 'friendly fire' incidents than any other army, and for some of your allies in some conflicts one of the highest causes of deaths has been 'killed by American fire'. You also have killed civilians in both gulf wars on a massive scale. Your army's policies in this area are in direct contravention of the Geneva conventions.    4. You're the only country to have used nuclear weapons against another country, predominantly against civilian populations. Even when it comes to the testing of nuclear weapons on your own troops and population, with the possible exception of the Soviets, you're way out in the lead. You use depleted uranium weapons in tactical (battlefield) situations on a scale which dwarfs any other country (I admit other countries use them) which creates radioactive poisoning as much to your own troops as it does to any surviving enemy troops, though of course your allies get a good dose too.    5. Your churches are perhaps the most materialistic on the  planet, and while you preach the most loudly about believing the bible, you study it far, far less than churches in other countries, and your evangelicals preach against some of its central tenets, such as the use of weapons, and the support of Empire. Empire, in scripture, is an unqualified evil, and Christ's names, like 'Prince of Peace' and 'Saviour' were actually names for the Emperor Augustine, so that faith in Christ was, from the start, a wilful, knowing opposition to Empire. It is the issue that most early Christian martyrs died for. In the early centuries of the church it was not possible to be a soldier and a member of the church. When Constantine, a pagan emperor, made an accommodation with Christianity, church leaders knowingly betrayed Christian principles in return for worldly benefits ... money, social prestige, and so on. Now, consider that, and consider the American Church's support for George W. Bush. To most of the rest of the Christian world it is blatant apostasy. To most American Christians it appears not to be an issue.    6. America is a land of death cults that makes Haiti's adherence to Voodoo seem like a sunday school picnic. You have Christians who own guns. For most of the rest of the world church, apart from farmers with shotguns to get rid of crows, that is just ... well, it beggars beliefe. Secular research shows that the higher the level of gun ownership in a country, the higher the murder rate, the higher the suicide rate, etc. It shows that households which own guns are more likely to suffer fatalities in the event of a robbery. Guns don't protect, they kill. Jesus said, fairly clearly, not to use force. But you shoot each other at a rate that almost no other coutnry on earth can match. Parts of South Africa. Parts of Latin America. That's about it. You have gang shootings, you have mass-shootings in schools, diners,  you name it. It's a death cult. You kill each other with cars at a rate that most other countries can't compete with, and you pay dramatically less for your petrol / gasoline than almost any other country simply because you use your military force around the world to ensure that you get your oil at below the market rate. People die for this to happen. They die in Russia, they die in Nigeria, they die in Saudi Arabia .... over the last hundred years you have killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world for your cheap oil. And this is before we get onto the secret societies, the Freemasonry stuff, the Skull and Bones stuff, which is embedded in your system of government and even on your currency in a degree that, previously, I've only seen on currency from Mobutu's Zaire.    An American friend once asked me, 'aren't you afraid of Moslems?' and was astonished when I said 'No'. If he'd asked, which nation do people around the world fear the most, the answer would have been 'America'.|`|iYEWbE23aa	You're asking for a facepalm.|`|075c7DdDaa	The United States ISN'T a Christian nation. That's the truth.    There is no dislike implied.  Research the Treaty of Tripoli which stated that "The United States is in no way a Christian nation".    This country is a MELTING POT of cultures. To even say it's a Christian-only nation is a slap in the face to the founding fathers.|`|533z6lWpaa	America is all about redemptive violence, an eye for an eye. A little diplomacy would put us in a better light.    EDIT: Dear, America is not a Christian nation. The Founding Fathers were Deists.

OT4SrmDXaa	I guess we Christians took a time machine and went back and forced the Pope to start the thing?    The Catholic Church Started the Crusades. The Catholic Church  burned them at the stake. Freemason Inquisitors burned people at the stake. Masonry has nothing to do with Christianity it is a Satanic religoun.    Catholosim is just another denomination religioun like Baptists Presbyterianan, Eastern Orthodox, Mormans, Lutherens ect. There have been many people who wanted to serve God in these Churches but they are only a "minority".    Just like you have your Sunni and Shite Muslims denominations in Islam.

Christians who know their Bible don't claim to be "better" than anyone else because of their "morals".    Instead Christians tell people what the Apostle Paul said.    Ephesians 2:1  And you (former non-Christians)  He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins,  2  in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience,  3  among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others.      4  But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,  5  even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),  6  and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,  7  that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.      8  For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,  9  not of works, lest anyone should boast.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	"I'm pretty sure it was"???

You can believe what ever you want to believe. We (christians) just want to tell what the truth is and if it doesn't resonate with you then that is fine. No one should be forcing any belief on someone else. Even Jesus didn't force others to follow him. It is always a choice. We just don't want others to forfeit eternity.|`|C0K3Bo2Aaa	Do you realize that your avatar looks like Yoko Ono?  :0 Now it looks like Uncle Leo from Seinfeld!|`|zMcHYQeBaa	Crusades Schmoosades    Can we move along please?|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	Chrisitans are only justified by thier faith in Jesus. An atheist can turn to Jesus and have even better grounding than a Christian. The parable of the prodigal son illustrates that the brothers who were faithful and stayed at home with the father were jealous of the son who left and returned. The evil of athism is that it's a form of idolatry, putting yourself as God. Also spreading atheism's false doctrines such as evolution is something that causes people to lose thier faith, which is bad. Christians look to Jesus Christ's perfection, not thier own selves for perfection. So whatever you say about Christians that is bad is only the result of man's sin, and imperfection. Those people that killed in the crusades were not doing God's will and proably were not Christians. Many call themselves Christians that are not really Christians. Satan has his own false christianity and false christs.|`|AA11096726	Who says that? I haven't seen it. Have you made up your own straw man to knock it down?

We just believe differently. I'm sorry that some misguided person gave you reason to think that.    Christians are told to imitate Christ, and love people the way He did. Love everybody. And by no means are we better than anybody else who doesn't believe. Because its not anything we did that get's us "Saved". Its God's grace, and His reaching to us.    As for the reference to the Christians killing people....I'm not too terribly familiar with that period in time, so I can't give you an answer except that I would just encourage you to keep in mind that there are MANY religions that are called "Christian" but really aren't. Like, a lot of people call Catholicism "Christian" when its really not. So keep in mind...the Christians you know today may be part of a much different religion than the Christians you are thinking of from way back then.     Just my speculations.....all I can say is that I am an Evangelical Christian, and nobody from my religion would go around killing like the people back then that you are thinking about. Again, we are told to love everybody. "Love your neighbor as yourself." And - "Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you." (words of Jesus)|`|Y2Ag76kEaa	only hardcore Christians think that atheists are evil.    I am a proud catholic and i dont believe that atheists are evil(i have a close cousin that is atheist). I wouldnt choose to be an atheist even if god has completely turn his back on me. i would convert to satanism before that.    People need someone to believe in even if its the devil.as an atheist u trust science and do not believe in a higher power. therefore if things go shitty on a day then you have no one to pray to and no one to blame.     The catholic church was run by a bunch of assholes in earlier times which resulted in the killings. I myself do not go to church very often, i worship Jesus and god in my own way.

xu0R3ojaaa	The theory of Evolution is based on the idea (From Darwin's Origin of Species) that in any population, mutations cause variations between individuals in the species. Over time some variants prove more successful and these tend to live to breed more than the less successful variants, leading to the whole species eventually possessing the successful trait. In extreme cases these changes give rise to entirely new species.   Mutation + Survival of the fittest = Evolution.  Evolutionary theory is very good at describing how change occurs in ecosystems in response to changes in the environment or competition from other species. The ability of bacteria to become penicillin-resistant is the best modern example of evolution in action, caused by human intervention, but evolution of the species none the less.   What Darwin or modern theorists totally fail to explain is the origin of life itself - they think salt water subjected to lightning strike would spontaneously generate organic chemicals (Possible) then living organisms (Implausible at best). No-one has been able to generate artificial life in a laboratory, trying their best to do so - we are supposed to believe it will just happen spontaneously without design?  My take on this is that the Intelligent Design Hypothesis best describes the origin of the Universe itself and life on Earth; after which Darwin's theory, being based on careful observation of nature, best describes the ongoing evolution of the species on Earth once lifeforms were created. If looking for the best explanation of the world around us it doesn't pay to be a Bigot: Creationism and Evolution are NOT mutually exclusive, and in my humble opinion, we need both:  Creationism + Evolution = Reality as we see it today.  Your question as stated assumes everyone has to belong to one school or the other - why not pick the best features of both theories?  This is why truly open-minded scientists would support the teaching of the intelligent design hypothesis along side Evolution - let the kids be challenged to think about it, and form their own opinions, not be brain-washed by bigots of either extreme.|`|KgYIYXEtaa	'Intelligent Design': The idea that something was designed by an intelligence. The phrase itself however is used almost exclusively with reference to characteristics of life forms or certain life forms by religious believers, who maintain that said characteristics provide the evidence, or indeed proof, for existence of a god.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	You said "define Intelligent Design," so I will:    Intelligent Design is the belief that the origin and natural order of the universe is not random, but was created by a sentient being, who is omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient, and invisible.    This belief is unsupported by scientific method or direct physical evidence or observation, but is an article of faith, and therefore, untestable and incontestable.     Thus, it does not rule out the existence of genocidal sky pixies, benevolent flying spaghetti monsters, Zeus, or a giant turtle supporting the universe on his shell.     You pays your money and you takes your choice. Either way, what goes up must come down, into every life some rain must fall, day follows night and no one gets out of here alive.|`|075c7DdDaa	Intelligent Design: No proof, just "goddidit".|`|DqtSdgtPaa	ID- The idea that everything was designed by an unnamed designer. Creationism with out specifically saying god.|`|aBJDqwq6aa	Intelligent Design = The Creation 'story' without mention of a specific deity so that it can be forced into public schools without violating the 1st Amendment.|`|GBKaftrJaa	Evolution is defined when a living thing adapts and changes to fit their new environment.  And the science books in the chapters before that all say if you take a living thing and put it in the wrong sort of environment it will DIE.    A cactus can't become a palm tree.  A fish can't grow lungs or produce offspring that will.    Can viruses and bacteria learn to combat drugs, SURE, that's not evolution, that's still being the same virus or bacteria.    The "proof" of evolution is that of skeletons dug up of people with skeletal deformities, and instead of realizing these people were born with deformities they are seen as the way everyone must have been back then. Well, certainly with no prenatal care, doctors, vitamins, adequate diets, no medicines, then there would be a lot of deformities.  But that's certainly a deformity and not how people USED to be before we supposedly evolved.    And it's very easy to brain wash children so when their grade school textbooks tell them before the age of 8 that something evolved from something else, they just don't have yet the mental capacity to refute that idea and they just accept is as proof, as when I was 6 I spent an evening arguing with my mother that SHE didn't know how to spell our last name, because my teacher taught me how to spell it correctly. That is how easy it is to give children misinformation and have them accept it hook line and sinker.    So I'll be going with the eye witness acounts recorded in the bible thank you very much and not the guesses we politely call "theories" in science.  And I'm not quite buying the "proofs" since they always have so many holes in them.    I hope that was sarcastic enough for you.|`|WfR6AqHiaa	evolution.... hmmmmm im a christian. im only in 8th grade and i havent studied evolution much so i wouldnt really know. but on background just us and apes came from a common ancestor. and that seems to be b.s. to me|`|7c0eb610d871f4900af356753fbd90b4aa	ID = a new way of saying that they are creationists and believe in the literal/biblical idea of the 6 day creation    however using the words intelligent design rather than creation  suggests that God knew of the changes that would happen and allowed for them|`|OtKMSMn5aa	What a challenge, but here it goes:    I would have to ask, are we talking about the theory of acquired characteristics, the theory of natural selection or the theory of mutation and adaptation?  Either way, it is the same.  New, more complex forms of life have come (evolved) form lesser forms of life.  Instead of man evolving frorm today's apes ...    (if it doesn't have a tail it's not a monkey, even if it has a monkey kinda shape, if it doesn't have a tail it's not a monkey, if it doesn't have a tail it's not a monkey it's an ape) - Veggie Tales    ... evolution says that today's apes / monkeys / chimps etc... and man evolved from a common ancestor.  Some of them even go as far as to say that all forms of life evolved from a common ancestor.    (I find it hard to believe that men were all apes, they wandered this land of plenty with bananas and grapes,  And then one day ape became man - now ain't that terrific?  But just quite how we are not sure, we can't be specific). - I.B.I.J.I.T.O.F.W. by Hocus Pick Manouver    Some Evolutionists (or at least it was the case when I was in school which was just before the wheel was invented) further theorize that the original organism developed out of a chemical reaction resulting from an explosion (or big bang.  Now I don't know bout ya'll but every big bang that I have seen produces destruction not protozoa which given time and natural selection will become primates.  But that is just my observation).    So to summarize, simply put, an organism, given time (lots and lots or time) + natural selection = evolution.  We can't prove it because it takes too much time.    Give me God-did-it any time.  It's a whole lot easier to believe.

Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|k7FD3rt5aa	I don't know what they believe, but I can tell u there isn't a "trinity."

After that, he declared with boldness that they are separate beings.  He also declared that they each have physical bodies, although glorified and perfected.  The Holy Ghost does not have a physical body: it is a personage of spirit and can dwell within people.    The following link has the official account of Joseph's first vision:  http://scriptures.lds.org/en/js_h/1    Both Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon later shared a vision where they saw God.  The following is part of their firsthand account:    "20 And we beheld the glory of the Son, on the right hand of the Father, and received of his fulness;     21 And saw the holy angels, and them who are sanctified before his throne, worshiping God, and the Lamb, who worship him forever and ever.     22 And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!     23 For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father     24 That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.

No god required.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	First and foremost please remember that you cannot come to the understanding of the truth by listening to those that hate God and truth.  If you want to learn and understand the Bible and God you MUST learn from those that understand and love Him and His Words to us.   The atheists have websites with thousands of perceived errors in the Bible.  EVERY SINGLE one of those lies has an answer.  This is self evident by the thousands of lame questions that they post here that is answered only to be ignored or mocked.  Christianity is the opposite of fear.  Its is about belonging, helping, brotherhood.    The thoughts and doubts that you are experiencing are common.  To jump start your relationship with God become active in your church or find a good Bible based church.    Become involved in your church and its daily workings.  Help with ushering.  Help with pot luck meals.  Help with clean up day.  You will fill your life with Christian friends, thoughts and deeds.  In doing this you will push out the deeds of the flesh and its lustful self serving desires.  Remember, our every thought should concern our God and others and not gratifying the lusts of the flesh.   You will feel as though you belong to one another and depend and care for one another.  You will feel loved and you will seek to prosper others ahead of your own concerns.      Today, society tells us that would should aspire to become the full pattern of pop culture.  To attain beauty, wealth and status.  To put on a show of  '"look at me and how I have it all together".   But the way of God is to seek Him with all of your might and to do His work in caring of the less fortunate than ourselves.  Dont give up.    Message me and I will answer all questions that you have.  Remember, living a Godly life isnt about fear and the unkown.  Just the opposite.|`|TEaFwk1Baa	What you need to hear is this, "relax"|`|hjxsX4liaa	You must not give up child.

You don't have to be a model human being to believe in god. God is also not an instant solution for things. The teaching and values that come from god are what is important. You should make up your own mind about the values you feel god deems important. You don't have to be stupid to be a Christian. Nor to you have to follow what everyone tells you. Many people go through something similar.    Before giving up on your religion do a little research in to both Christianity, Islam and Judaism and  the values that they hold. This can help you to decide if god is not real to you. If this doesn't help then before completely dismiss the existence of god, take a moment to your self and just think of what you truly believe.     I Hope you the best either way!

I believe that their is more than one god, and I believe in life after death. I don't believe that the gods want to control us and make us be totally devoted to them, and i also believe that the gods wanted equality.

But let's  change the terminology to "spiritual atheist," instead.  It has a nicer ring...    I do not believe in the existence of a supreme deity. I really don't even consider that. Likewise, I don't believe in a devil, Heaven, or Hell.    I do, however, believe in souls, spirits, angels (as guardians, not Biblical) an afterlife... All those things.    I don't have any difficulty reconciling these beliefs. I feel  that our souls are our consciousness --our life-force.  I believe  that all living creatures possess such a life-force, and that, when we die, our life's energy changes form, continuing on in the hereafter. What we do in the hereafter, I haven't a clue.     I do feel that, in some ways, the dead are able to interact with the living. That's why we see ghosts, why strangers just "show up"  out of nowhere  to help stranded women or small children ... anyone in danger, or needing assistance. Then, these strangers mysteriously disappear. These would be the angels, or guardians of whom I spoke.    I realize I sound like a nutter, but I have my reasons for believing this. To me, these reasons are very convincing, and my beliefs -- strange as they are --  as valid as anyone's.|`|4WqvTAfmaa	Deity has lots of masks that help us humans interact with Him/Her/It.

I have seen it work in my life and others'  If the Law of Attraction works here on Earth, then there's no reason that it can't work in other realms. Therefore, I believe that we choose what happens to us after death (be it Heaven, reincarnation, etc. Even Hell, if that's where we truely believe we will go). And I believe that you can change your mind once there.|`|PRAd6MWwaa	I believe in a Mother and Father God, that all religions are just different versions of the same thing with their own twists on it, thus making them all partly true.

I believe humanity was created by god but it was taken over by the demiurge or "devil". i believe no one goes to hell but we all go to a afterlife. i believe in reincarnation only if we choose to. and once the earth can no nothing sustain life the hearth "heaven" will join with the cosmos "heaven" along with all the other planets "heavens" that had the same fate as earth.

I think we are all judged according to our works, hearts and actions and that if we prove ourselves worthy and capable then we will be able to grow and learn even more after this life.    God wants us to become like him just like we want our kids to succeed.  This life isnt about testing and punishing.  This is about growing and progressing.

It also shows our Heavenly Father that we have the discipline and attitude to deserve and be capable of growing and learning more.|`|3wbUElbOaa	I believe in God, everything is created by God and there is a part of God in everything including us.  I believe God loves us unconditionally and that God does not try to manipulate us into believing with rewards of heaven or punishments of hell.  I believe it is a more pure love for God if we are not trying to get to heaven or avoid hell.  I believe that all religions and religious books are man's understanding of God.  I believe our understanding of God should progress throughout the years as we progress as a people and that our grandchildren should know more about God than we do, not cavemen from thousands of years ago.  I believe we have been reincarnated through billions of years and will continue on this cycle of births and rebirths so that we can grow and progress closer and closer to God.  I believe we are co-creators with God and we create our own lives through our thoughts and actions and collectively we create the world around us.  I believe that the evil we create in this world is our own Karma that will come back on us to teach us what we need to know in order to progress and grow towards God.  I believe that each of us has a link to God that cannot be separated, that we don't need anyone to come between us and God as church leaders or saviors.  That's about all I can think of right now, thanks for the great question.|`|2YTIwMgOaa	I believe there is a road.  At some point in life, we each step onto the road and go one direction or the other by deciding if we'll be "good" or "bad."  It doesn't have to be about God to be good.  In fact it's possible to be about God and still be bad.    You can always turn around.    Thank You, Red Queen.  That was beautiful!
AA10982716	Each parent should speak his/her first language to the child, and can continue to speak to each other in English if desired (but I think also make an effort to learn each other's language). By the time the child is speaking either language well enough to be understood, he ill know which language goes with who. (Children at first say things that aren't real words, and I think Russian and Polish are similar enough that many of the words this child makes up/tries to say will sound as much like one language as the other.)    I don't know if you're the mom in this situation, but if so, please don't talk to your child in English too much. I don't mean to be rude, but (based on the English in your question), your English is not that great and the child will learn a very weird version of English. My first language is English and even my trilingual children speak a somewhat weird version of English, just because they don't hear it as much as monolingual kids do.|`|o9n6UXCVaa	You should make your difficulty your advantage. A family is a team that each member knows one another at all, including language in this case. And you are a youth, therefore, you should take the initiative. You should learn English and Russia as well as Polish. It is your advantage because you will be more "globalized": you know 3 languages and 3 cultures. Additionally, it is good if you understand that your parents spent their lives in a "mono-language" environment and how much hard they have faced when they changed to live in a family like this. They are old and see difficult to learn any more. Maybe, you should persuade them gradually to learn other languages.     I know, 3 cultures are diffierent, moreover being contradiction. But you don't need to merge them right now. You will do it naturally when you understand 3 cultures.|`|utMcsTlUaa	There is actually a lot of debate regarding raising a child multilingual. Most of the research is based just on a bilingual upbringing. Both of you should speak to them in English, and raise them with English as that is the shared language between the two of you. Now you have to choose the second language. Three languages honestly might be a problem, and problably would be confusing and actually hurt the child's development. So I would recommend raising them with English and then either a choice of Polish or Russian, and then after they are speaking well, like around age four or five, add whichever language you have not introduced yet.    The important thing is to set clear times, places, and people for each language so that they distinguish between them. For example, one man would walk his son to school, and speak French on the way there every day and German on the way back. Don't just use both off the cuff just now, wait until they are older and understand it better. Until them, raise them structurally. Speak English mainly, and if, for example, you choose to teach them Polish, speak Polish at a specific time.

RcB2FNWRaa	Quite possibly.  As females are generally seen as the less powerful (in strength and in other, more sociological sense of "power") of the sexes, I wouldn't be surprised if it came about because of patriarchy.  Jokes relating to another person's mother have always been popular, as well.
cyRDKRIDaa	You need to immediately go to the police. I myself certainly wouldn't take any risks with this at all.     In the meantime, you should most definitely lock all of your doors and windows and go spend the next week or however long you need too (until the police sort it out,) at a friends/boyfriends house. I would definitely feel more protected with my boyfriend around. xD     You need to get a new phone, so the harassment can (possibly,) stop, but make sure to keep your old one, and keep it active.     Good luck. That sounds really scary. I would've pis*ed my pants.|`|AA12051696	1: yes it is harassment. dont know if it can be considered sexual though  2: yes the police can track the number  3: yes they can press charges    buy some mace,  lock your doors and windows, and travel with a friend if you feel scared|`|B94G0Y7haa	HOLY CRAP!!! im really sorry that must be scary!!    1. yes it definitely is!  2. they probably will, they've been able to do a lot these days. but (idk how old you are) if its a guy from school just bugging you, that would be very embarrassing and bad to call the police. though they pretty much just said they were stalking you and you have a right to be scared and freaked out and call the police, even if it is a guy from your school and everyone thinks its not that bad. then "everyone" is a retard, but im sure the majority will be on your side. i urge you to cantact them and tell an adult! (again, idk how old you are) so i agree with the guy above who answered.  3. im sure you can, you have a good reason for it but im not sure exactly  Good luck with all this!!    answer my Q:)?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|zub6aYxHaa	that is scary. just make sure you dont delete the message because its like evidence. so, good luck. and ps. just couse he has your number doesnt mean that he knows were you live. he could have mad up a random number, go to the police right now..|`|O23lK3IUaa	Thank u for yr answer =]       OMG !!

I'm so sorry hun =[   I hope they find out who this man iss !!  Good luck xxxxx|`|MMdWfD1baa	Definitely go to the police.  If you give them enough info, they might be able to track the number, but I don't think they can press charges unless it continues.  They will probably give the man a warning, but if he keeps doing so, then they might be able to press charges.  Just be careful and never, ever give out your phone number. :)|`|hDeNKwNpaa	tell your parents first and then go to the cops, have any 12gauges in your house|`|QAwwmDuDaa	I suggest you get the police involved,if he knows your number he knows where you stay,get help,now.|`|PRAd6MWwaa	It may be a prank call.  but if you are really disturbed by it, i would go to the police.

AA10948829	Is it hard to learn a language that has three writing systems, a sentence structure backwards to English, a heavy use of transitive to intransitive verbs, and thousands of new vocabulary words you'll have to learn that have no connection to English (unlike Spanish or French)?

Waay easier than French or Dutch!! But that's just me...|`|A6ritUpHaa	Alright, before I start: This is not meant to be rude.    I'm going to be honest with you. Before you start into another language, try to get a hang of your native one.    You look like you don't use correct punctuation and grammar. You don't capitalize words that need to be capitalize. Instead of writing out words, you throw in "lololol."    Now, I'm not going to say that I never do that, but typing with correct english (at least to the best of your abilities. Do I look perfect?) gets you respect.    And a HUGE warning here: writing the way you are writing, people WILL call you a weaboo and wapanese and **** like that for being interested in Japanese culture. Hell, I DON'T type with internet ugliness and I get called those names.    It's true that Japanese is pretty complex. I'm learning it, and I keep getting stuck with sentence structure. I'm ripping my hair out over memorizing hirigana.    BUT!    I don't think its as confusing as other languages. And learning it will benefit you. A lot.    So, I encourage you to learn it, and I wish you good luck. Again, I'm not trying to be rude towards you- I don't want you to be insulted by the IDIOTS you will meet on the internet.    Again, good luck!     PS- I'm not relying ONLY on one program, but a good one seems to be "My Japanese Coach" for the Nintendo DS. Not only is is good, but addicting.

R8yelFG7aa	Modern secular society views homosexuality as wrong because it is steeped in the view that men must be strong, virile figures of power and dominance, and homosexuality is seen as weakness.  There really is no secular outrage against lesbian relationships- just twisted judgment and hidden religious bias.  Also much of the U.S. has been raised according to Roman Catholic or Judeo-Christian views even if they aren't raised in the religion.      If you research into past secular and pagan cultures you will find that homosexuality rises and falls in popularity throughout time.  Also, the anti-homosexual vibe is not as apparent in many places outside the U.S.    Yes, humans exist in both male and female forms and biologically, for purposes of procreation, a male/female paring seems to make the most sense.  However, human beings are wired to not only experience sex for procreation but also for pleasure.      Christianity says we're more than animals... why accept being bound by biological shape?    Even in the animal world there are species and individuals that engage in sex just for pleasure, and some that cross the gender boundaries.  In the world of pure logic (no God included) why not embrace someone you're attracted to and care about who loves you too?    Morality requires us to not hurt ourselves or others.  Inside that rule, there's a lot of room to move.  Hold to your ideals, but even the Bible says that judging a person's morality is God's job, not ours.|`|vRPqfdlaaa	Because everyone seems to be hung up on the law and the prophets of the Old Testament and not willing to understand why Christ died in the New Testament.

But to my opinion, your nationality doesn't really have to do with where your were born. It also depends on many other factors. I guess you should be Canadian.     And how about my cousin who was born in France with his dad being a French and his mom being a quarter Vietnamese, who was born to a Hokkien dad ( ie. my paternal grandmother's dad ) and a Vietnamese mother? enough to drives you nuts, huh?|`|69SHxWA9aa	I know someone that had two parents that are 100% chinese, and he was born in Los Angeles.  He married someone also 100% chinese decent, so all his kids are also Chinese.    Good Luck.    PS:  You do not have to have Chinese ancestory to be born in any country in paticular, so someone who is 50% Japanese and 50% chinese can be born in any country, yet if they are born in China or the United States, or someplace else, it does not change their ancestory background.    So if two people from Mexico should have a child in Canada or China, it will not make that kid chinese or canadain.  However having the kid in the United States will make the kid an American, and he can request that his parents be allowed to become citizens, and also receive free medical assistance if he is not working, and the parents have no money either.    That is one reason that the United States is going broke, we try to help to many others out.  Spending millions of dollars to keep the peace all over the world.    Even North Keorea was bribed with 300,000 tons of heavy crude oil for free by the Clinton administration if they promiced to not develop nuclear weponds.  Well the promiced not to develop them, but kept on researching nuclear weaponds and nuclear power plants, breaking their promice, and the United States kept giving them the fuel oil each year for free.    I bet that the next Congress will do the same thing that they did 12 years ago, and give away millions of dollars to whoever has their hand out.  Congress especially likes giving to those who contribute to their campain expences.

VRl1jENHaa	This is a VERY brief explanation:    1)  The Day of Atonement foreshadows Christ's sacrificial death for the all the people's sins (Lev. 16:16).  He is also foreshadowed by the scapegoat.    2)  The Feast of Tabernacles:  Jesus was born on the first day of this Feast (which is a special Sabbath) and was circumcized on the day after the Feast ended (which is ALSO a special Sabbath).    3)  The Feast of First Fruits:  Jesus is the "firstfruits" of the resurrection.    4)  Shavuot (Pentacost):  is fulfilled by Jesus' sending of the Holy Spirit to all believers.|`|AA11096726	The shedding of blood always looked forward to the perfect sacrifice because the sacrifice of animals could not forgive sin. Then when the blood would applied to the ear and the oil on top of the blood it symbolized the work of Christ and the work of the Spirit who was given after Christ did His work of atonement.

It hurts less to get rejected right off the bat then after its been dragged out for a while.  If you want to explore it and give it a chance then go ahead and go to lunch. If your not sure then ask her up front if this is a date or you are just going out as friends. Sometimes that can get confusing with girls. One of them thinks they are dating and the other thinks they're just hanging out. Clarify. Take it slow. Go out with her however many times it takes to be sure whether or not you are interested. If something develops then great, you're all set. If not then tell her "You know, I like you but I don't think there is any spark here. Lets just be friends." And stick to that.|`|Ki90Irkcaa	It depends. If physical attraction is something that is a must have for you, then no. Just tell her you're not interested like that and you could just be friends.

It matters more that they have the capacity to show and share love and teach love to a child.

I think the government should get out of all the  things you brought up but I do think they should control  population growth.  They should sell baby licenses.  I read  that it cost over one hundred thousand dollars to rear a child  through age 18.  It is mostly people who can't afford children  that think they should have six or eight.  We foot the bills.  And the children are automatic citizens even if the parents  are illegal immigrants. so again, my suggestion: Sell Child  birthing permits.|`|AA11232725	The government should legislate morality, not because it makes people more moral inwardly, but because it puts guard rails around our lives to keep us from doing evil acts.    The idea that abortion is "a personal choice that the woman makes for HERSELF, and HERSELF alone" is a lie of the Devil. Abortion isn't like choosing what color of clothes you want to wear. Abortion has many effects, the most drastic one being that it cuts off the life of an unborn child whom God only knows what they might have accomplished if they had been given the opportunity to be born.    The Devil tells us that we are all one big cosmic accident and that a human life is of no more value than the life of a pig or a dog or a cockroach for that matter.    Therefore, since an unborn child is really nothing in the cosmic scheme of things, it's OK to run around and have sex like dogs in heat, with whatever person suits your fancy, and if by the decree of the "god of chance" a human life starts to develop in the womb of the woman, just cut it out and throw it in the garbage and go on living your lives like a bunch of greedy pigs and don't give it another thought.    Don't make yourself feel guilty thinking about how your mother thought enough about you when you were in the womb to go through the pain of child birth and the trials of child rearing. YOU are the most important thing is this universe so get everything that YOU want now, because after you are gone, that's the end of it all since there is no God.    That's why the government has a God ordained role to legislate morality even if by doing so it doesn't make people more moral on the inside.    Romans 13:1  Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God.  2  Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves.  3  For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same.  4  For he is God's minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God's minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil.|`|4GiIXWUXaa	If there is no such thing as legislated Morality there would be no need for the Judicial System.  Murders and rapists should go free by your reasoning.    Makes no sense.    Besides, your conception of "Separation of Church and State" is incorrect.  Personal freedoms are granted insofar as they maintain obedience to the Law; what a person does in their own homes is their own business, but what is done in public is the public's business, hence the need for moral laws.    xoxo  ?    *edit* YES, abortion and gay marriage ARE personal choices, but they are choices that effect society, not just the individuals in favour of them. To maintain a moral and peaceable society the Law must be impartial to religion in general yet still state and maintain guidelines for ethical living.   I do not consider murder ethical, especially not under the guise of "personal choice" neither do i consider gay marriage ethical as, even if the Bible's statements about it were totally disregarded, it goes against the laws of nature in the reproduction of the species. Therefore it is a deviation and an unnatural act, biologically also.|`|8IHfytEvaa	OK    Let's do it your way and let's abolish the rules which prohibit:    Murder    Arson    Rape    Bank Robbery    If Abortion was legalized 15 years sooner, then perhaps our President today would be named McCain?

366aa3bbb60558f11aecb9d3750bceb2aa	Interview an older person who self injured and looks back upon the futility of that action viewed from later in life. Is there any one who would talk to your school about being a self-injurer in youth and how it was a bad choice.    When I was young I cut myself. Even when my child was small and my husband left me I cut myself. Now I advocate for alternative measures to relieve stress. I always own up to what I did and how stupid I was to do it. Young people think they made up cutting. if they met someone old who cut themselves years ago, maybe they would realize it is pointless and not a new fad.    ps. the cutting did not bring my husband back. My greater maturity with time got me a better husband.

dNSvlc6caa	There doesn't have to be.  I choose to believe in God (the best term to describe me would be panentheist), but in no way do I think I have any proof.  I realize that it's a faith thing - it's not fact based or rational.  I think the existence of God can't be proven, and that doesn't bother me.  I think there's a good chance that I'm wrong about the existence of God, but it doesn't matter.  What matters is that we live life ethically (and ethics are independent of God and/or religion), and if some people need to believe in God or religion to help them then I think that is fine.  The trick is to realize that it's a belief based not in facts or proof and to be okay with that.  I have no idea why I still believe in God, but I think it's just because it feels right.  However, I am very open to the idea that I could change my opinion on that though.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	People have to have someone to blame for their problems and insanity.

To use the words "have to be" implies necessary existence psychologically.  For those of us who have accepted the reality of God's existent nature through personal conviction, miracles, creation, things found in nature, health, wealth and salvation of the soul, I would say there has to be God because nothing else can explain what I see, hear, feel, sense and know.  Here is one example, where does our sense of "justice and balance" come from?

If so, then you should link to them.    If you're referring to that woman who gave birth to 8 babies (on top of the 6 children she had already), then I would guess that her problem is not a legal question such as whether abortion should be legal or whether fertility should be controlled.  I'd guess her problem is some form of mental illness.

TpG33NoWaa	Originally, 'etiquette' was a rather formalised mode of behaviour that was intended to minimise the unpleasant aspects of social gatherings.   In particular, it prescribed modes of behaviour to employ when in the company of someone you didn't much like.       Its motive was, apparently, to avoid giving offense, to avoid situations that might well lead to anger, argument, hurt feelings, etc.    This form of 'etiquette' is perhaps known as 'civility' today.   Another variation of this type of behaviour is sometimes called 'good manners'.    e.g.  In a group predominantly consisting of devout Christians, it would be 'bad manners' to talk deeply about theology in a gathering if there were Muslims also present, or Atheists, for that matter.     This would be to avoid heated argument, embarrassment, hurt feelings, etc.    This earlier version of 'etiquette' even had 'rules' for the behaviour at a formal duel.   How to address ones opponent, what ones 'second' should say, wear, etc.     Later, 'etiquette' was something the newly-emerged middle class learned (in order, perhaps, to aid pretensions to nobility?).  It certainly included behavioural guidelines, but it seemed to focus more on things like cutlery selection during a meal, the appropriate clothing to be worn for various functions, etc.    Now, I'm afraid, etiquette is something almost exclusive to pretentious 'women's' magazines.     I am being slightly cynical, perhaps, but it seems more to be about how you can be seen to be better than those about you than about ways of making society function more smoothly.       It certainly has this popular reputation, and is widely regarded as a study for aspiring snobs!|`|qf66N9AAaa	proper behavior|`|CTIC7Pmjaa	Pretty much.  It's doing the right thing to get along socially, treat people right, be polite and so on.|`|S3tVSDfaaa	etiquette is manners and the proper way to carry yourself in front of public etc. and it is like manners at the table and while talking to someone. for example looking at someone in the eye while talking to the and having a firm handshake.     its used in social skills because its how you present yourself to others.    hope i helped!|`|AA11198190	Yes....etiquette...plays a big social part in our lives.  Conforming to behavior,manners...and conforming to rules of society.  lf you don't have etiquette in our lives....then we are not totally accepted by the majority.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	etiquette is knowing how to act properly within a set social perameter...for instance knowing which fork is the salad fork in a ritzy resteraunt or knowing when to applaud at the ballet or if you should curtzy or bow in mixed company...but it goes deeper than all of that...etiquette is the basic human equivalent of consideration in all events|`|7DlEN6lXaa	Etiquette is what makes for a more civil world. It's saying please and thank you, and being kind to others, treating them how you want to be treated. Yes, it has a lot to do with social skills but it's a whole lot more.|`|CkIeCNS4aa	It's more like rules for polite society, such as which utensil to use during each course of a multi-course meal, and how to be polite in various situations.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	manners; proper behavior|`|f57L7TKRaa	Etiquette is a proper way of behaving in a social situation. An example would be bringing the hostess of a dinner party a gift, such as a bottle of wine.|`|d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	Alright... this is going to be a LONG, in depth answer, and not throwing terms like "proper behavior" around like those are adequate enough to define it.    Let us begin with the basic fact that human beings are SOCIAL creatures, like horses, like dogs, like ants, like MANY other creatures on earth.  As such, in order to ensure the survival of our species, we live in SOCIETIES.  It is the rare individual that lives OUTSIDE of the human society... it is the exception not the rule.    With this in mind, it should become obvious that such a society must have RULES to allow that society to live, survive, and "carry on." We need MAJOR and MINOR rules.  What do I mean by that?  Well... laws against murder, rape, robbery, etc. are "major" rules.  They are usually codified into a set of laws, rules, regulations, and ENFORCED by certain authorities.  After all, if we didn't have traffic laws, we'd be running all over the place and into each other ... it would be chaos.    That being said, there are MINOR rules which do not NEED to be so "heavy-handed" as to be codified into a set of laws and regulations.  However, they ARE NECESSARY for those in the society to live peacefully together.  THIS is where ETIQUETTE comes in.     Etiquette is that set of rules for "proper behavior" which helps to "grease the wheels" of social interaction... to allow people to get along with each other, to care for each other, etc.  Even the simple "manners" of saying "please" and "thank you" help to make everyone feel better, and live peacefully, instead of hauling off and socking one another in the jaws because they didn't appreciate the gift that was given to them!  Saying, "Thank you" for a gift is much better than being hit in the mouth for NOT saying it.    Etiquette's "guiding light" would be the phrase, "What should be done/said/considered in this situation to CONSIDER the OTHER PERSON (their feelings/position/respect, etc)?"  Mind you, that is not saying to consider the other person BEFORE or ABOVE oneself.  Only that one should THINK about the other person, and should do what would be best to live peacefully together.    You might say that etiquette is the non-legal equivalent of two cars passing each other on the roadway and NOT honking their horns at each other or flipping the bird to the other driver.    So, yes, it DOES have a LOT to do with "social skills."  While it's certainly nice to know which FORK to use at the dinner table, when faced with an array of silverware to chose from, that is a MINOR consideration in the overall volume of ETIQUETTE... the manners... the behavior that aids in the peaceable interactions between "social" human beings.    Even horse herds, dog packs, and ant colonies have "etiquette." It's either etiquette or a hoof-kick in the jaw, a bite on the neck, or chaos in the colony.    And different cultures have different etiquette, because they have developed different ways of peacefully co-existing.  So belching at the dinner table may be acceptable in ONE culture, but NOT in another.  Different gestures have different meanings.... and so on.  But ALL of this STILL falls into the category of ETIQUETTE.    I hope this has helped... LONG but helpful.      Have a polite day.
AA11231339	I am totally a proponent of the law of attraction - but I wasn't at first.    When I first heard about the Law of Attraction I thought "Wow!  I can have everything that I want!" but then it said, "You create everything in your life."  and I thought...    "Really?  Even that date I took to a party who exchanged numbers with another girl right in front me...I created that?!"    So I was skeptical.    But I had tried so many systems to improve my life and none of them gave me consistent results so finally just said "what the heck" and I stuck it for a while.    It wasn't always easy.  And I had my share of doubts.  But one day everything just "clicked" and I totally got it.    And now I use Law of Attraction all the time and my life is WAY better.    Like no more crappy dates... now I have a fantastic husband.  Much better! :)|`|mFy3M8mVaa	Yes.|`|bK5MJCxhaa	I don't believe in the parts that defy the laws of physics, but I think there is a lot to be said for focusing on what you want instead of what you don't want.|`|7ff82885c9d5d1f343a4664e9d97a78aaa	.|`|DqtSdgtPaa	Magnets are only attracted to their opposites?|`|oxUFlfPvaa	Which one?

Only thing is, Jesus never worshipped himself.....he only called himself the messiah just to fit in with the needs of reaching his message out to people, technically he doesn't fit the bill for the true Judiac messiah.     Christianity is a religion based on Paul and the various contrived beliefs of the Greeks, Romans, and a heavily edited religion to appeal to the masses (no offense to Xians but that's what I really think).     Judiasm is NOT synonomous with Christianity. Judiasm is NOT "Christianity without the Jesus" or "just the Old Testament". Its so much more than that. The Jewish religion acknowledges many paths to God meanwhile most Christians believe their way is the only way. The Old Testament of Christianity is a poorly translated text written in Greek and Aramaic, not Hebrew. There are so many inconsistencies and fallacies I cannot even begin to say.     Okay, enough ranting and comparisons. Truth is, there is no such thing as a "Jewish Christian". A Jew is a Jew, a Christian is a Christian, and so forth. The two don't mix.|`|i0Ydiqj2aa	They want to feel Jewish without having to put all the hard work in to really be it.    Imagine if there were a group of athletes that wanted to feel they were the best in the world, but instead of training hard and going to the olympics, they created their own fake olympics so they could win every time.    Messianic Judaism exists so people can feel Jewish in their own eyes without having to actually do the hard work that makes one a Jew.    I'm talking about real Torah observance, not the fake kind that they do.    And their trinitarian beliefs?    Well, many of them spend a lot of time talking down the Church for its pagan elements, and they'll talk of how the original followers of Yeishua had a pure form of worship which was corrupted by the Church, yet no matter how hard they try to remove the 'pagan' elements of Christianity, to get back to a more 'pure' form of "Messianic Judaism", they just can't give up their golden calf. Trinitarianism. It's just too scary to imagine that they were wrong about that too.    They talk about how the reform of Martin Luther didn't go far enough, yet they're guilty of the exact same thing. Keeping all sorts of pagan ideas which have nothing to do with real Judaism.|`|AA10405801	You are correct.  Messianic Jews is a fraud.  They should call themselves Messianic Christians.    99% of these people are Christians, and not Jews!|`|pElG2K61aa	Nothing is beneath the dignity of a fundamentalist Christian when it comes to conversion, including lying. Hence, "Messianic Jews".|`|8I9uduIiaa	We know why - the Christian Evangelicals that pose as 'messianic jews' are part of a Cult that's been around for decades.    They used to call themselves 'hebrew christians'. They stopped using that name: it wasn't fooling enough people.    Then they rebranded and came up with the notion of actually *claiming* to be PART of Judaism - even though they're about as 'jewish' as Osama Bin Laden.    Messianics are LITERALLY NOT JEWISH.  Just like Hindus and Muslims and Catholics are *literally* not Jewish.    Messianics are condemned by all Jews and 99% of Christians.    They can lie as much as they want: but all Jews and all TRUE CHRISTIANS know that the Messianics are making a mockery of BOTH Judaism AND Christianity.    Much more info: http://www.ajewwithaview.com    And what is beyond belief is that anyone thinks THEY have a right to come along and REdefine what is and is NOT part of JUDAISM.

Unless you block every non christian we can answer this question like so.    You do realize these groups provide help to those who's own governments are either unable or unwilling to provide the proper services BECAUSE the Christian and Muslim nuts rant and rave so loudly right?    That in these countries women and young girls are forced to have dangerous and often times LETHAL back alley abortions that could have been prevented by a condom or birth control?    Here's my piece of advice: STFU and mind your own business. What other people do when it comes to their CHOICE to reproduce or not you have NO say and no RIGHT to tell them how to act.    I know plenty of Christians who use condoms, and other means to prevent conception.     Also these groups don't just provide abortions, so again shut up if you aren't going to bother to learn the WHOLE truth of what they do and offer.|`|GtazNrplaa	It doesn't affect me|`|KWeU8LJtaa	I'm not a Christian, but I'll answer anyway because I can.

First of all, an abortion is between a woman and her doctor only. What a woman does to herself and her unborn child is her own business and no one Else's. We all have to answer to God when we die and face him with what we have done, therefore it's not your business to tell me what I can and cannot do. Second, can you imagine being over in an under developed country and perhaps being raped and then stoned to death for being pregnant out of wedlock? These poor women need someplace safe to go to eliminate something that could get them killed even if it's not her fault. We need to help those that cannot help themselves. You don't have to endorse or believe in it, but by God you don't have a right to tell a woman to keep a baby if she chooses not to. If we make abortion illegal, we will have women hacking up their bodies with coat hangers and having abortions done by butchers in a back alley. It's not your business, and we need to help the less fortunate any way we can. Even in our own country.|`|k3LbhASGaa	well kinda shows you what he is all about . did any one notice that he came from the most corrupted state in the union ? and this is according to the FBI agent that got blangovich|`|DqtSdgtPaa	I'm just happy Bush is out of office.

Am I right? Or am I mistaken?    And how do you know God's will? You read the bible? That's just a hotbox of truth right there. And you also listen to the church sanctions that tell you God's will just because they think THEY can play God and manipulate people to believe what they want and to live the way they want, not how your GOD wants.

Especially with our economy being so bad.|`|eDy3OkKwaa	Well there are many Christians out there who voted for obama based on one word "change" (I USE IT LOOSELY ). Which by the way is taking place against God's word.  I am also tired of people they are so glad BUSH is out of office. I am sure they did not loose one night of rest or sat up worrying about a bomb landing in their living room. They ran up their credit cards, and over indulging themselves and their children, while driving cars they can't afford, instead of  showing some support for a man who gave up a large part of his life to serve this country.Good or bad he deserves that much respect and gratitude.  Since there are so many concerned let them ask themselves not what our country can do for them but what we they do for our country (Kennedy...democrat with one good idea). So now supposedly it is better that we have a younger, more modern president in office who lives his life like a super star while his wife spend four hundred dollars on lunch..When was the last time any of us spent four hundred dollars on lunch? Yeah they are in touch with the common man. I dont knbow about you but I dont want my tax money educating any young women that abortion is okay...too bad the obamas choose that for their daughters. Wonder what they would do if it was their child that went for the abortion. Why won't the press ask those hard questions, instead of how is he feeling tonight knowing his grandmother was not here to see him be elected. GOD help us the next four years..the fall from grace is far...when you idolize others over God. Good Luck    Abstinence would help solve the problem the sooner people realize this the better,especially the younger generations coming up.
m1oEGlnmaa	I think being patriotic or even a little nationalism is fine (keyword being 'little'). I don't see a problem in being proud of where you're from. But there's a very fine line between being Patriotic and nationalistic and just discriminating/prejudice. Sometimes it can be great, other times it can lead to horrible events (Hitler's third reich).|`|jdKTs3aHaa	i see what you mean.

At least you are convinced.|`|8cac5996dfa4b74cef2a5b4b88deb987aa	Patriotism should be a personal choice, in an ideal world, and not something that people are encouraged into. Otherwise it borders on indoctrination.    It should be tempered by balance, and respect for others who just may feel the same patriotism for their own nation. This can only work if mutual respect exists.     I am not American but feel that to a certain extent, "truths" are presented and some swallow it whole (without chewing or trying the flavour) in England as well. Sometimes the attitude is that if it wasn't shown on the TV or printed in the newspaper then it did not happen. The converse is also true to those who choose to think this way, i.e. if it was presented in a certain way on the TV news or in the newspaper, then it MUST have occurred that way.    For some people, ignorance truly is bliss. They are happy living their lives that way, that is their choice and they are entitled to make it. For me, I am more comfortable with questioning and challenging.
iSU0O9W0aa	Fasting is obligated to those who are Healthy, Pregnant women, Minors, Old who are very weak, People who are in travel and can not survive without food during time of fasting, and so on.  Even women during mans period are spared and can fast latter when time is over.  Religion is from God and God Almighty is our Creator, He do not want to put us in trouble we can  not sustain.    Spirit of Ramadan Fasting:  Fasting was in some way or other was in practice before Prophet Muhammad as well. Qura'n says:  "O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that ye may (learn) self-restraint." Holy Quran (2:183)    Plus Fasting is not just to refrain your self from food, a lot more then that, see:    Fast like a living thing, have a body and a soul. The required abstinence from food, water, sexual relations etc, is the body of the fast: "piety" is its soul. If we are not striving to refine our character by fast, our fast will be a body without soul. Fast cleanses our body from impurities. Likewise, it must purify our hearts and minds from all impure thoughts improper desires and undisciplined sensations.    Holy Prophet Muhammad (saww) saw a woman, who was fasting on that day (not in Ramadan), abusing her girl-servant. Holy Prophet Muhammad (saww) admonished her and told her to break her fast. The woman protested: "But I am fasting today". Holy Prophet Muhammad (saww) said: "But was not your fast broken by the abuses you were hurling upon that poor girl?"|`|4rWPX8CTaa	Allah, the merciful, is sometimes more merciful than other times.|`|MYN4VFJvaa	first of all only those who are mature (as in attaining their puberty) are obligated to fast.   second, we dont fast for 24 hrs. from morning upto sunset actually.    pregnant women, elderly, kids, people who are traveling are not obligated to fast in ramadan.|`|e5d10eae9a48e059f9317d719d5b716caa	You don't have to do Ramadan if you are pregnant, ill, or a child.|`|utAWNRzfaa	even tho i'm not muslim, i believe what you say is correct.

In Bible times, anytime they saw a naked prophet they knew that he/she was truly speaking for GOD!    1 Samuel 19 24 He* (*King Saul) STRIPPED OFF HIS ROBES and also prophesied in Samuel's presence. HE LAY THAT WAY ALL THAT DAY AND NIGHT. This is why people say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"    At that time, all the prophets of God must have been high on something and going about naked to achieve the greatest impact on people! Thats how King Saul was recognized as another of the elite prophets of God! This is the honest naked truth in the Bible!    King David danced before The LORD with his genitals exposed.    2 Samuel 6:14, 20-23 * David, wearing a linen ephod, danced before the LORD with all his might... [20] When David returned home to bless his household, Michal daughter of Saul came out to meet him and said, "how the king of Israel has distinguished himself today, DISROBING IN THE SIGHT OF THE SLAVE GIRLS of his servants as any vulgar fellow would!"* (*Michal knew that dancing before the LORD was BULL SH*T!) David said to Michal, "IT WAS BEFORE THE LORD* (*The wanking Bible writers are hinting that God pleasurizes himself watching a man dancing naked before him!) I will become even more undignified than this, and I will be humiliated in my own eyes* (*how kinky can King David get?). But by these SLAVE GIRLS you spoke of, I will be held in honor."* (hey, was King David trying to impress The LORD? or was he trying to catch the eyes of those SLAVE GIRLS???) And Michal daughter of Saul* (*BTW, this is the King Saul who prophesied naked among the prophets before the LORD, too) had no children to the day of her death.     The lesson in the Bible is that no wife can complain about a husband dancing naked exposing his genitals before some slave girls and The LORD! or he is bound to stop having sex with her until she dies! Thank God she can still become a lesbian there is no damning of lesbians anywhere in the Old Testament!!!    How about going naked for three (3) years as a sign and a wonder upon some oddball countries?  This is about the longest sustained stripping in the Bible! You dont have to say anything just go about your daily chores totally NAKED and let your athletic body speak for God!    Isaiah 20:2-3 (KJV) At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking NAKED and barefoot. And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked NAKED AND BAREFOOT THREE YEARS for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia;      Hey, Christians got themselves a God that excels in refinements! They picked this Naked Prophet writings about an alleged virgin birth for God the Son Jesus Christ! (Isa 7:14-16)    The young prophet Micah used to go naked showing the effects of a heavy dose of hallucinogenics on himself!     Micah 1:8 Because of this I will weep and wail; I will go about barefoot and NAKED. I will howl like a jackal and moan like an owl. (Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus!!!)    The Bible writers put down in writing all this kind of Holy Crap by the bushels in the Bible. The kids in public schools can now read the Bible as another literature book It ought to be restricted reading for anyone under 18 years of age!|`|bb2fb83f62e8d0f381f54d42036a5791aa	If he or she has their own TV program then it's truly the word of god.

If they are in line with what the Bible teaches they are speaking for God. If their words do not line up with the Word of God then they are not speaking for God.

We are not to judge but God did tell us to be fruit inspectors.

There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|AA11232725	The writings that are found in the Bible are God's common revelation of divine truth to humanity. God does speak to individuals about local circumstances and issues that they face. Most of the time He does it through them seeing what He has already said in the Bible. Upon occasion the Holy Spirit will speak to an individual. And if a Pastor is given a message to deliver to a congregation that originates in the Bible and has applications for our lives today, then God speaks to groups of people in that manner.    If someone claims to be speaking the Word of God we have to be like the people from Berea whom the Apostle Paul preached the good news about Jesus being the promised Messiah or Savior to.    Acts 17:10  Then the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.  11  These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.|`|W0Ovbpq0aa	1 Pet 4:11    Also try; 2 Peter 1:20-21|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Because whoever wrote the Bible were chosen to write it.

God bless everyone!|`|tManvxfQaa	If we have the Protection of God around us , it wont matter what the wicked do around us , as long as we follow Christ , they can not Cross that hedge    Let me tell you a story TRue story and actual events not a dream nor a vision but physical event    I wont go into alot of detail but i will tell you i was in the midst of a mess and i was concerned about something....where i live our drive way is gated ..coming to get in the drive i had to get out to open the gate( cause of our little dog its gated ) anyway...as i opened the gate and got back into my car and drove up and got out to shut the gate , as i went to shut it in the middle of my driveway was a snake...it was crawling as hard as it could crawl yet wasnt going anywhere...i watched the snake for a few seconds trying to figure out why it was struggling to move foreward yet could not.....a few inches up from the snakes head was a Drop of Blood...it was very bright red..and it was only one drop..i first had thought maybe i ran over it , but it wasnt there when i drove up...and there is no tall grass of anything its all asphalt..anyway the snake crawled real hard to move yet it couldnt move foreward ....as i watched i heard the Lord speak to me saying , IT cannot Cross the Blood....i realized then what this was about...so i went over and i smashed the snakes head it immediatly stopped moving, and all know who have killed snakes even when you kill them thier bodies still move , this ones didnt...so i came up to the house..i told others about it and they went to see this snake ..the one i showed saw the snake and the spot of Blood there...and later as i told others and went to show them the snake was gone and so was the Blood spot...IT was a Witness to me and the other one concerning that the enemy could not cross the BLOOD , thus the Hedge of God that was placed there for us....and the other things that was going on..well it was all handled and it worked out just as God said it would...Thats a True Story.....Hope that helps someone who is reading this answer..  again it wasnt a dream nor a vision.......it was real !!|`|tpmAAkdBaa	By only asking for Christian perspectives you lose out on a lot... like a full understanding. Also, Muslims and Jews and countless others believe in God, as well.    As for someone who does not believe in God: I do like to pray/self meditate a lot and hope, but I have never actually prayed a hedge and I don't think it would be that important.    Also, Obama is not here to do evil against us and so far I think he has done a great job.
AA10746669	It's too bad we can't trust those textbooks, huh.  As a matter of fact, they are not only untrustworthy, they are full of errors, and even mountain high piles of c_ _ p.|`|wkmdKFxJaa	ROFL you sound just like a christian fundie. Da God dun it cauze my bible says it so it must be true. Your textbook says it because the scientists have deemed it credible enough to teach. At what science univeristies is Creationism taught and deemed credible..none thats what i thought|`|6jAVElX7aa	who wrote your textbook since that person is also a sinner, as in the Bible it is written. "For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God." So your textbook would only try to make you believe that evolution is a fact. delusion on your part.|`|bmqJs2hwaa	what... I doubt you own a textbook|`|K24JFTOcaa	no, in fact thats just stupid|`|M6VcuiyDaa	And evidence for creation is?    I have yet to see anything outside of "goddidit"|`|RrnMRJ2Laa	Yes evolution is true since there is proof|`|gHSarVD1aa	Wow .. I thought Atheist didn't realize they were worshiping their text books?  Ya'll is startin to impress me!|`|a7c22dd3a3ed6b12011a02bf27c95704aa	You must be Richard Dawkins.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	Why do atheists always think Creationists don't understand evolution. Your insults really only prove that you are not interested in the truth. Ask any creationist and they will probably say that if there is no God hypothetically, that evolution is the only plausible way that life could have formed into what it is. That's why evolution is such a strong delusion. It's a strong delusion because there is only one plausible theory to support the origins of species. Ironically even if evolution were true, it doesn't explain biogenesis, and there is no really good theory of biogenesis, and what processes were required. Now do I sound like a dummy?  I don't mean to insult, but I'm not impressed by this question at all.|`|AA12165299	huh...does this help you understand why we don't accept evolution...  fact...water exist  fact...rocks exist  theory...water and rocks equals life...|`|WfR6AqHiaa	wow you changed my life im an  atheists now and i belive in evolotuion|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Wow!!  Maybe I will 'convert' now!  lol.|`|oHSzktF4aa	I bow before you, good sir.|`|jW8Fm0eKaa	lol
49niWB6Qaa	Yeah that's so annoying. They should call it a five dollar store, not a 99 cents store.|`|H7Q1rA7jaa	yah it was 1:60$|`|J1F3SRJsaa	Only after tax.|`|0Bi6MufTaa	how does that work hahah|`|Llvro4h5aa	um not really....|`|HwU2ljGXaa	yes and its ridiculous|`|SEbchthIaa	YES!  Its rediculous, like there are actually a bunch of things in there over .99$|`|SsUG0mUQaa	yes, i have actually. after that purchase i complained to the manager about the price and the faulty advertising and went on strike. after about a week i got a call from an angry worker from the store telling me to do things that are inappropriate to say here. anyway, a few friends and i went to the store and proceeded to pelt the windows with 99 pennies and hold up signs that claim that the store was against all religions and that the workers are raped each day and are paid less than minimum wage. a month later the store was shut down and i was fully refunded for the $1.02 that i spent at that store.|`|DNW4jTigaa	Yea, in California there is a recycle fee or something.|`|nUmiUNklaa	yeah... a soda was supposed to be 99cents, it came out to be $1.05|`|7PJber95aa	no but I stole something from the 99 cent store|`|fOzP3CmWaa	No way! That's the beauty of the 99 cent store...nothing over 99 cents!! Why, did you?|`|hHKagR8Zaa	yes|`|iU1ULFWVaa	Yes today!! They went up to $1.10 cause of pay increase here in FL!!|`|1guDp259aa	all we have is the 2 dollar shop in austrailia.|`|58K4Ft0uaa	The Store.|`|GvVi4epVaa	Yes!!! All the time lol Sometimes there are hidden signs stating "these objects are 99 cents and over"  lol|`|419b54befe425a1ea6fbb7f00aaf095aaa	Here  in Chicago it's the dollar store, and yes i have and will continue to buy stuff there. I  buy dish soap and paper towels, there. Window cleaner, tooth paste stuff like that all name brands too! Bravo for the dollar store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ACA8i43Gaa	My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance. His reply Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said Its all good.    http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com  http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/s...|`|Z9jlS2bUaa	i don't think i've had a whole embarrassing day, but i've had some very embarrassing moments for sure! Too many to remember and i wouldn't wanna go into it anyways.|`|0iJSa2c1aa	When my dad walked in on me singing and dancing to Tim McGraw's "I like it, I love it". I was shimmying and everything. It was so embarrassing... it still makes me shake my head when I think of it to this day.|`|Toqqvz26aa	The teacher called me to his desk because I had to go some place and I tripped on a backpack on my way there. The entire class started laughing, then he gave me a hall pass. Then I was half way down the hall, i relized he never told me where to go. So I went back and asked. Everyone laughed hader and I turned bright red.|`|AUhHRZ72aa	i have had a few but, they don't bother me much because i laughed them off and would joke about it when it was over. I remembered this kid pushed me clear a cross the hall and i slammed against a locker. OH the kid was my friend and i kinda pushed him first and the only thing embarresing about it was i had a crush on this girl who saw the whole thing and was cracking up! but she helped me up and we walked away w/ our arms around eachother and we didn't end up going out but, we are very good friends and still talk|`|pSryQTckaa	I am extremely germaphobic. Well, I went to the bathroom during class one day. Of course I put paper on the toilet seat to avoid sitting on germs. Well I did my business and left the bathroom. When I got into class someone pointed out toilet paper I had sticking out of my pants. It had fallen from the seat and gotten caught in my belt. Most embarressing day ever.|`|nA8Qc4ZAaa	well.... my girlfriend had me in a toto i think the little fairy dress things and a faiy wand and a pink bikini top and my grandfather walked in lol it was bad he thought i was gay the rest of his life all i remember doin was running under the covers of the bed lol
DYQkOIXVaa	that is a little strange|`|aROi7KG5aa	Maybe he is reading it before he gives it to his teen daughter to be sure he approves of what is in it.  Glenn Beck had Stephanie Meyer on his show and it almost seemed like he had read Twilight|`|B94G0Y7haa	yeah kinda. but i love that book so i would probably force my husband to read it if i thought it was really good:) maybe he liked the first one and read new moon. and everyone loves edward so maybe he's looking for some tips:)     answer mine please:)?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|3U3n7w7eaa	no, to be honest that is not normal|`|4Vmlf902aa	No I guess not. It's like how video games were first suppose to be a guy thing. But now I see girls playing it, and when in the electronics section in the store, I see girls checking out video games. I wouldn't read the Twilight series, but that's just me. Who said girls had to be the only ones to enjoy the book?|`|upqJU9yiaa	Its just a book so it doesnt really matter how old you are, even if its told in a girls perspective doesnt mean guys cant read it. Its pretty hypocritical too cause you see girls reading books with boys perspectives but when you see a guy reading a "feminine" book there like he's gay which isnt always true.     I used to love pop up books when i was little and I saw one at the store the other day and i liked it still lol so yeah age doesnt matter.     =P|`|EFjrJmdXaa	Maybe he is open to his feminine side. Or maybe he is gay.|`|HsT9sW5Xaa	I would say that's quite strange.     I, being 16, could hardly get past the first chapter. The immature and teen-like writing style makes me feel like I'm reading a 14 year old girl's diary.     Then again, my mother read some of the series as a means to screen it for my teen sister who is reading it (to make sure it is appropriate reading material). Which could also be the case.
6Whz1p5Eaa	Yeah, I find some parts boring and hard to get into. Some parts of the Old Testament are confusing, and I really don't like Paul's writing style so I don't read his letters that much.     But to me, the Gospels are NEVER boring. I read them a lot.|`|GtazNrplaa	Cross reference the bible with other religions.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	To 'you', yes.  (Try reading next time with the Indwelling of The Holy Spirit!)  Then you will 'see' alot better!  |`|IxoBFCpTaa	Try reading the Qur'an; much more interesting:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0fKflH5-...          Peace ?  ^_^|`|AA11091234	Try the book of Revelation, it's pretty trippy.|`|UDXp2d8Zaa	did you read those verses yet/ 1 corinthians 14:34-35  Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.     35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.|`|W0Ovbpq0aa	Not really|`|M3lQYr1waa	what i thought the mixture of blood sex and violence was hilarious, the contradictory nature of the moral conclusions were a particular source of entertainment maybe your'e reading it out of context lawlz|`|dbw210qqaa	You need to be revived|`|SY3aYLMraa	Yeh, especially the whole John begat bob, bob begat danny, etc    I gave up after that and started reading Viz.|`|0bOSZIzJaa	The old testament is pretty interesting, especially the parts where god smites millions of people.    What is wrong with what I said?  Are you denying that god kills millions in the OT?  Try reading it...|`|z36j8rmRaa	That's because you do not have the Spirit of God helping you.  Ask Him to help you understand.  You might also try reading another version.    NIV or NASB or NLT    I like the NASB the best but the NLT is also great.  BTW  you can download most of these for free at E-Sword.  Great study software and download some commentaries with it like:    Albert Barnes commentary  also free    Gill commentary also free|`|6jAVElX7aa	because you dont read it and ask the Lord for understanding insight into His Word, you wont understand anyway, unless you believe God exists, God gives His Word as a guidance for daily living. So if you find it boring, then why bother reading it?|`|TMb076n6aa	Ask the Holy Spirit to illuminate your eyes with understanding so you may know God is speaking to your heart|`|Hz2L59BCaa	Boredom is a virtue.    God loves them that are bored, and he blesses them that are boring.  .|`|hgTR8Uzaaa	This isn't my original thought but I heard it somewhere.      The Bible is God's letter to us.  If you don't understand it, or it is boring, it is just because you are reading someone else's mail!        But, seriously, as a true Christian, no, I don't find the Bible boring or repetitive.  I've read it through numerous times and still learn and see new things.  I can read the same passage 100 times, but I will still see something different.      Keep reading and see if God will speak to you through it.  Start in the gospel of Mark.  It is short and full of stories.  Very interesting.  Then move on to Genesis.  A little bit longer, but again, most of it is stories.  But don't give up.|`|LoOBJ6RTaa	I don't read the bible. Sorry.
gRObakpZaa	God will forgive only unless you are truly sorry and get married eventually.

T6v3RWixaa	Put Jesus' face in their faces.  Or just think, "Is this Jesus himself  appearing to me as a fat man ?".  Remember Jesus' words:  What you have done to others, you have done it to me.  (I have no biblical truth to  prove this statement of Jesus but this is what I have been taught all throughout my childhood days ---- that oneday Jesus appeared as a  beggar to a man and the  man was rewarded for being kind to the beggar.)|`|NAL9SZuXaa	spend some time BY YOURSELF and do some self clensing/reconstruction. I LOOOOVE doing that =]|`|iWaU76T5aa	Look at their faces instead of their bodies and put a tape over your mouth when you are near them xD.|`|rI6xYwhcaa	yo no se, le pregunta jesus para ayudarte?|`|4fikqmnUaa	Just stop being such an idiot. remember your ugly points. maybe you have a big nose or ears? short? skinny? No muscle? you have something disgusting about you, so don't upset others.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Well, I know you are skinny, right?  So then you cannot understand why people are fat or obese.  There are many factors that can lead to overweight and many people have to fight off fat all the time by a lot of inconvenient exercising, going without food they are hungry for and just sacrificing themselves all the time.  I for one would have to do this but haven't had any success in losing weight recently.  A diet mentor which I contacted yesterday reminded me about the importance of going without carbohydrates and really I know this is what I would have to do in order to lose and keep it off---to sacrifice all carbos for the rest of my life because my intestinal track refuses to process carbos and the heavier you are the harder it is to do any exercise.  It has become just all I can do to do what I have to do to survive to a large extent so I don't have extra energy for extra exercise and even if I did, it would blow out my knees and wear down my hips and destroy my ankles so that I would have to have operations that I cannot afford and wouldn't have anyone to help me recover either.  Sorry, this is so long---but I thought this would help you understand a little bit of what it's like for some people.  I was confused about many things at your age too and it's takes years to understand what others are going through.|`|rJLeVoMKaa	You were honest, and that is the first step.  Ask God to help you stop by showing you what you need to do to improve your attitude.|`|vRPqfdlaaa	Start eating. and when you get fat yo will probably start empathizing with fatties.|`|OLL9Cdbtaa	Well, at least you know you have an issue and want to change it unlike some people out there. Just try and think how would you like it if someone made fun of you or if you had a fat child how would you like for them to come home with a story to tell about someone teasing them about there weight everyday?|`|pfke6Jieaa	just respect them. and since ur a property of jesus i would expect u to be a lil more respectful bro. u need to start respecting ppl for who they are cuz i know for a fact u r not perfect ur self. and u will never be.|`|XpHRL9xaaa	Gain weight.

Sounds like he's in great company to learn that everybody is the same, even when people are of different color. I think he will get over it as he gets older.|`|ykIleAQ7aa	My friends son did this too. Its not a big deal, I think you're worrying too much. Really there is nothing wrong with what he is doing, he is identifying things and he just so happens to do it out loud. I doubt this is something he will be doing for the rest of the year. It will pass, I don't think there is anything you can really say I mean he says you're brown to another 3 year old I highly doubt they will be offended, and if he says you're pink to an adult I doubt they will be offended either.   Here is a story for you.  When my older brother was about 2 or 3 my mom and him were at a grocery store. My mom saw a "little" person in the isle they were about to go down. My mom explained to my brother that  there are all different shapes and sizes to people. Well when they went down the isle the first thing my brother said very happily is "OH MOM LOOK HOW LITTLE HE IS!"   So no matter how much preparation you try to give your kids sometimes it just goes over their heads. I would just let him play it out.|`|da1dcaeaa6d5a578338ee81a7e6ea26faa	you are worrying to much! Little kids will not see this as racist at school. because they have alot of the same questions, but not the same social hang ups as adults. he is to young to understand racism, as will his class mates, and his teacher (unless she is really new) will be used to dealing with this.|`|LRezhwfVaa	That is normal, my neice and nephew both did that and no one got offended.  We were standing in line and he told a lady she was black, the lady had a good sense of humour and laughed it off. He also calls my mom(his grandma) brown as he notices that he is white and she is olive skinned. So perfectly normal.    It's good he is noticing and being observant at such a young age, and anyone that gets offended by the reality of what colour their skin is is very sensitive!|`|0SLCXs2daa	Its perfectly normal for a child to his age to recognize differences like that.  If you make a big deal out of it, that's when it becomes a problem.  Just ignore his remarks, or praise him for knowing his colors.  Eventually he will stop pointing it out, as all kids do.  I think you may be worrying a little too much about this one...Just relax.  As long as you teach him what's right, he will be fine.|`|KKh8rikGaa	You said " he doesn't understand why he shouldn't do this" why shouldn't he do this, why is everyone sooooo scared to say other people are different, are you teaching your 3 yr old not to say someone is taller, someone has curly  hair, straight hair...For heavens sake , let's not dare make someone uncomfortable........|`|ge2IamhUaa	Relax and enjoy his observation skills.  What he notices will change with time and probably sooner than you think!  Try redirecting his attention without taking away the importance of his observation.    when he says,"her skin is brown," you can ask him what color is her purse/hat/jacket?  Make a game out of color and praise him when he answers you right.|`|YpN6sg1Waa	The best thing you can do is not make a big deal of it.  If he senses that you think it is wrong or feel uncomfortable, his curiosity will persist.  All in all, it is perfectly normal and a great opportunity to positively reinforce his observation skills.|`|dvht9KlIaa	talk to him cuz if he went to my son and said "YOUR BLACK!!!!"  then my lil Tyronel wud kick his lil baby butt.    jus sayin. mabey is no big deal. but be careful cuz rasism aint no good fo no one|`|QPGyZEozaa	Anyone who takes a 3 year old's comment the wrong way has a problem.

I found that there is no truth in that statement as the papacy is nothing like the early church and the apostles.    It is so corrupted and full of dogmas... it Truly is sad.  very sad.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Catholics like to make it as if their religion is some sort of "unknowable enigma".      You don't believe in faith alone in Jesus, you don't believe that believers have eternal security either.     Since you reject those both, I'm not interested in  your defense of any other positions.|`|QlB3VXWraa	I'm a former Catholic, taught by nuns & priests in Catholic church school and I was even an altar boy. I know the Catholic church from personal experience, up close and personal. That's why I'm no longer a Catholic.

Since then I've read numerous texts including the bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls and several books about both. There is nothing in your alleged canon that would make me want to go backwards.
604x6fDLaa	Tarot cards are playing cards. One may play card games with Tarot cards as well as the conventional 52 card deck and one may also tell fortunes with both conventional playing cards and the Tarot.    Divination is possible with any deck of cards. Cartomancy is the name for a wide variety of card based divination which includes the use of conventional playing cards, Tarot cards, or purpose built oracle decks such as Angel cards. It is also possible to practice divination with dice or any other item capable of producing randomness.  However it would not be correct to call a reading with conventional playing cards a "Tarot reading" To do a Tarot reading, by definition, one needs a Tarot deck. It is also a gross over-simplification to always equate Tarot with divination as that is not the only use nor is it the original use of Tarot cards. People also play games with Tarot cards.    Properly understood, the Tarot is essentially a variant deck of playing cards. Playing cards appeared in China long before Tarot cards.  Shortly after the introduction of playing cards to Europe,  the Tarot began to appear in northern Italy to be used for a card game similar to Bridge or Spades. The Tarot was not originally designed for divination. Not only was the Tarot originally designed for card playing, there are people today mostly in continental Europe playing card games with Tarot cards. The European Tarot cards for these games often differ in appearance from the type of Tarot cards used for divination. In recent years, the internet has made it possible for those outside Europe to discover actual card games played with Tarot cards.    Prior the use of Tarot for divination, people used the conventional playing card deck for cartomancy.  The popular meanings often given to certain Tarot cards originated with the meanings often given to conventional playing cards.  Whether one uses Tarot for game playing or for divination, the Tarot is still a variant deck of playing cards. Prior to the 1960's it was actually much more common to use the conventional playing card deck for divination than it was to use the Tarot for this purpose.|`|gswPLRlRaa	Tarot Reading Cards are like magic, some tricks are better than others.    However, Statistics show that these cards not only give a false analysis, but too be quiet honest, if you are trying to get someone or something else to predict the FUTURE for you, you might be better off with a therapist who will give you a good check with reality.    Tarot cards will only have you leaving with a clairificaition of your own thoughts. Sounds brilliant, doesn't it?|`|6JnAOYCYaa	Hello    Divination with playing cards is called Cartomancy & is not Tarot. Place it in your search engine - see what comes up.    Sadhara|`|AA12059478	yes you can use playing cards just like you'd use the minor arcana in the tarot deck.  I did readings for years using nothing but a set of Bicycle playing cards.  (playing cards originated from the minor arcana which is why some christians have a huge issue with playing cards)  Interpret them thus:  kings are kings  Queens are queens  Jacks are knights and can double up as pages  tens to ace are the same.  Use any tarot book for interpretation.  Spades are swords  Hearts are cups  Clubs are wands  Diamonds are pentacles  Have fun :D|`|t5UQRABWaa	Very interesting. Tarot reading with playing cards? I'd like to know that myself! Can you email me if you find a good answer to this question?|`|03rOCajTaa	I haven't heard of that|`|4WqvTAfmaa	This is related to Gypsie reading cards. They use special meanings for each card. Of course, the 52 only match the Minor Arcana, but it is a start.     I have a deck that has a little piece of paper with a phrase on the top and bottom of every card. They look a little like the chinese fortune cookie slips, only smaller. I got it from my mother, who asked me to do a reading for her. She was scared, and was going out of town for surgery. That deck did indeed predict her death. That is the only time I have ever had to deal with a reading that involved death. I gave her some indication, but did not do anything to scare her any more than was required by the circumstances. She died within 2 weeks.     And, before anyone bothers, let me tell you I have investigated and the reading did NOT cause her death.
uxvskU7Xaa	i agree with u --- to get people to drop the subject when when " i just don't want kids" doesn't work and they ask me over and over -- this is my response ....   there are enuff people in the world now we are running out of resources and i am not going to bring another person into this world while its already overcrowded --- after this week i'll be adding the lady who had eight babies is having enuff for all to go around --- plus if i wanted a kid i would go adopt one no reason to bring another person in when there are already enuff needing to be loved --- this shuts them up really quick    the rudest and i mean rudest comment i ever had was this guy i was   in class with who was hitting on me ask me how old i was i said 34  he replied how many kids u got  i said i don't have any   he said WHAT! 34 AND NO KIDS  -- I wanna go out with YOU  and the tone he said it with was just so freaking rude - i knew what he had on his mind  i told him not in this lifetime or any other  thats when i started being rude when people ask me this question --- since i'm over 35 now people think there is something wrong with me and ask " why honey can't u have kids --so sad " thats when i give them the above answer|`|hzQ2aZz0aa	Because people are ignorant in the way that they think. I have 1 daughter who wants children and 1 who definitely doesn't. The 1 who doesn't is positive that she never wants children and more power to her because why would someone bring an unwanted child into the world? There are many kinds of families and they are who you choose them to be, if people can't understand that then it's there problem and their loss|`|xpiGWrdMaa	i think women who have 11 babies are selfish. That's just gross and they're polluting society.|`|MDWaPmXsaa	It may be that people see the person/couple as ungiving if they want to keep their life for themselves and not share it with a child.  Sometimes I think it may also be that the couple isn't providing their own parents with grandchildren, so that may be seen as selfish.  I don't understand it either, and I'm also tired of it.   I too have been called selfish because my husband and I don't want kids.  I just came to a point when I say "yes, I am, and that's my decision".|`|AA11598520	Idiot people. First, you ARE only 14. You may change your mind someday. Second, it seems to me that knowing you don't want children and then having one is selfish and foolish. It's better to know what you want and don't want then to find out the hard way later. I think they're being very responsible. I think they should respond, "When I want to know your opinion, I'll ask for it. Now, please, (gotta be polite) mind your own business."    Why doesn't the first answerer think that if a person wants to have 11 babies it's her choice, then? And, frankly, I don't see how any child can "pollute" the world. Scary.|`|4zevGBtdaa	Probably because some older fashioned people believe women are only good for having babies

You could always jsut draw her favorite flower too.|`|tNOXCHSbaa	that is a really good idea!   you know you should surprise her that you like her on valentines day!     so here is your answer for your question   you should make her a card and tell her how you feel about her inside the card  also you can but her a rose and some chocalate i know by a fact that she will love this aka i am a girl so i know what she will end up enjoying.    also inside the card at the end tell her this phrase  in my heart, inside of me, i doubt you know me, and i want to try and get that out but it is like if i am screming in the dark. will you be my valentine?    if you draw really good try drawing her she will absolutely love this because when i guy really means that he loves you then he will do anything for her.also it will show her that your talented.  so try this it will work out i promise         best of luck hope this helps                    -chelsyabigail-
d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	1. Thoughtless.  What you do it simply hang up on her in the middle of your conversation.  IF she calls back and ask what happened, you can simply say that she can call you back when she's less busy, that you do not wish to disturb her tv viewing, emailing, etc. etc. etc.    2. Thoughtless.  Next time, when the FIRST situation occurs when she doesn't have enough money to cover HER tab, you simply shrug your shoulders and say, "GOSH!  I only have enough to cover MY tab!  You'll just have to make arrangements with the restaurant for your tab!"  If she's shocked and hates you... then what sort of "friend" was she to begin with?    3. Thoughtless.  If you don't already have their names, addresses, and phone numbers, immediately get this information from them BEFORE they leave. If they ask why, you simply say, "Oh, well my lawyer will be needing this information when I sue you for your portion of the expenses that you agreed to pay."    ... oh... and rude in all these cases.  No, you are not overly sensitive.  When you are feeling hurt, that is your "inner you" telling you that you have been wronged in some way.  When they call you needy and overly sensitive that is their way of sloughing off the responsibility of their actions.  Don't argue with rude people... oh, and these people... I would not associate with them ever again. They have already cost you too much, in time, money, and your efforts.  They are not worth it.  Find friends who respect you.      Have a polite day.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	If someone does something like you describe ONE TIME then you never have anything to do with that person again, ever for any reason no matter what. The situations you describe are appalling and I would never put myself in that position again, ever for any reason.|`|1xMTNTgkaa	I would feel so hurt in these situations. They are rude, cruel, and inconsiderate. You would be better off with your enemies at least you'd know where you stand.   This is an awful situation an these so called friends are using you horribly. I am so sorry you have to go through this but you will make true friends. Some may always hurt you. But real friends, (although they'll make mistakes but won't take you for granted and they do will try to right the wrong) are around the corner.|`|69c729bbc40865df57b81abf4bbab3caaa	It sounds like you need a better set of friends.  It would appear that they take advantage of you, so simply put your foot down and say that you are NOT oversensitive, but that you expect to be treated like a friend.|`|uxvskU7Xaa	the first one is rude but i can understand that one somewhat i get occupied sometimes while on the phone but i'm trying not to do that    the second one is just plan very uncaled for she should have bought u something but some people don't see it that but if i was the "friend" i would have offered to pay for urs even if u had the money to pay u back for buying mine a few days before    the third one they sound like they follow the cheap fun -- i would find beter friends --|`|dCewrtXaaa	In all three cases, yes, your so-called "friends" have been rude. But you let them! When the girl was multitasking on the phone, you should have just told her "let's talk later." But why you would want to, I have no idea.    A sushi bar is an expensive place for an after-school snack. Maybe the girl is short of money. But then she should beg off before ending up there. Except that you have taught her that you can be counted on to pay and pay and pay.    As for refusing to pay their share of hotel costs, they are out and out stiffing you. But you have taught them they can get away with it.    You need to become more assertive and less of a patsy, and you need a whole new concept of how to choose "friends."|`|1161eb2411648d1b6121f0ed8cc27250aa	as for  1 and 2, and 3 they were rude.  The 3 person should have paid for the room, since they agreed to help, With the one you paid her lunch, I would not do it again, say you don't have the extra, even when you pay with more than the amount needed.|`|b3405fd5cf1e4d9c1bd727c0da6ee907aa	Yes i would say thats rude and id almost go so far as to say they dont seem like very good friends.  If they were true good ones you wouldn't have a problem as it would swing both ways where it works out even the amount of things to help each othe with and think situtions out before getting into problems..    Hope this helps.|`|tnKhIUK1aa	They are being rude and have a defense wall built up. They are them turning around and putting their own guilt on you and using intimidation because they are the majority.  Majority is not always right.  Stick with your guts and be true to yourself.  Pull them aside and tell them how you feel using "I messages".  ex. "I feel _______when you________because_____________..."  Then let it go.  You can only control yourself and not another.  Set healthy boundaries and make decisions if they do not respect your boundaries.|`|PhNzEkVnaa	Yes but....    You really can't call people on it.  You shouldn't become rude because they are.  Now some advice..in case   1 very pleasantly, no sarcasm allowed, say something to the effect "i let you go to  blah, blah, blah...we should catch up next week or whatever...bye.  In case   2--the friend is clueless and not very hospitable--don't go with this person anymore. Friends at least attempt to buy the next round, lunch or what have you.  In case   3...don't ever rearrange your plans to include last minute disasters of other people, there will always be a last minute thing (and they  ran right to it did they not ??) you will be upset and ruin your own holidays..  Keep being nice however stay clear of the rude people.  There is a difference between not letting the ill mannered bring you down and not getting caught up in it.  Be nice..don't be a  doormat--you'll just wind up cranky.|`|ge2IamhUaa	They want you to forgive their behavior but when you don't, they have to be defensive or submit to your disapproval.  They opt to call you oversensitive?  I'd say they deserve your label of rudeness.    I think you need to come up with some social strategies that prevent your "friends" from constantly taking advantage of you.    For example, when your friend had no money, you might have suggested a cheaper place where you could both have eaten for the price of one sushi meal.    Another example:  When your friends lost their hotel booking, you didn't need to be the savior of their trip and include them (actually, if you were a guest at someone else's place, it's inappropriate for you to ask to bring more guests in and take advantage of their hospitality.)  You could have just asked them what they were going to do about their predicament and let them solve their own problem.    As for the friend on the phone, the next time someone does that to you, tell them you can talk again when they are available to actually listen.

The real question is which one is correct when they say that the violence that has characterized portions of their history and their actions today has been ordained by God or not.    For instance, the Bible is clear that God told the Jewish people to go into the land of Canaan and wipe out all of the inhabitants. The people were afraid but they did what God told them to do.    Now when people claim that God has told them that if they commit acts of suicidal terrorism that He will welcome them into Heaven and supply them with 72 virgins as a reward, you have to ask yourself...    Did God create women to be handed out as prizes? Didn't God say that a man will be united to his wife and the "two" will become one?|`|vMFKIc4Jaa	Historically, Islam is more violent.

Islam is actually much closer to Christianity than Judaism,but the Tanahk is included in the Bible so Christians identify with Jews.|`|5mQydeBMaa	God = Allah decided that Islam should be the last religion on earth before the judgment day (which is very soon) so he chose the prophet Mohamed (sala allho 3alaihi wasalam) .but the Jews attempted countless times to kill him but they failed (by gods will) During the History ,the jews killed many prophets and twisted the truth ....jews can't be relied on even if you have no problem with them...now the jews own the world ,and want to eliminate islam by any means because islam is the truth.

AA10241709	I disagree.      You don't have to be a Nazi or a Black Panther to be a racist.    Racism could be just as subtle as someone not wanting their child to date outside of their race because they think their child can do better.    Most racism is not obvious - rather, it's quite private.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	I dont know but i gather that unless racism is ended people who experienced racism will always have some sort of opression to certain groups.. and people who were raised around racist parents will always have some sort of negative views around other races..|`|k9gp11PMaa	Wtf? Have u ever heard of 'undercover racists'? I think u need 2 be in this category of yahoo!answers more often. U'll see how much cowardice racists r really on here! It's a shame! Hate is nothing that is tooken over board! If u dnt mind hatred, thats u! But dnt criticize others 4 not lovin it like u might!|`|lPPgMKibaa	actually, your wrong, alot of people are racist. i bet out of the 200, 100+ would be racist.|`|wqFIC8c2aa	Out of 200 A handful would be openly racist and the other 190 of them would be closet racists. Only  a handful would be truly and freely open to all races.
Bk09TO3vaa	I would go with the Mazda.     Jeeps do look nice but they are serious gas guzzlers.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	They are totally different vehicles for different lifestyles. Thus, they cannot be directly compared. Buy the one that more closely matches your needs.|`|JknwX64saa	Get the Mazda.  I don't like Jeeps.|`|defde0b6e42848179471ab740c517f46aa	Hmmmmmm... I have a Mazda, and it's been a really good car.  I think they're very dependable, cute, and economically sound.  I don't know as much about the Jeep, but they're also nice looking cars.  I'd go with the Mazda.    Happy Birthday!!!|`|2uUctFHEaa	id get the mazda, i like mazda more than jeep|`|aucsqB7Laa	Jeeps are gas guzzlers and only show their real use in commercials.  Mazda's better in the long run. Gas efficient and eco friendly.|`|J0h1TKkxaa	wow a 26,800!!!!!!!!!1  but i would go with the jeep!  and in Silver..that looks so good!!!!!!  pick me up!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA12006309	A car.    For your birthday.    ....    I don't even own a car.|`|AmuSvGZxaa	Well, Chrysler is having trouble.  Personnally, I have had Mazdas before, and they are all right- but if you are not married to a particular brand- Look at Toyotas- They have the strongest performance records, Good warranties, and all Japanese cars have comparable models.  The 6 is probably most similar to the Corolla.|`|ohWdv6iHaa	Well, since I am assuming that both of these cars are within your budget range, you need to evaluate which one has the best features... Look at the safety and performance ratings and see which one would be better for you but also think of which car you like the apperacnce of best, because you shouldn't pay a lot of money for a car that you don't want to look at, especially when you will be having it for several years!    My recomandation is the Mazda... I know a few people that just got it and it is a very nifty car!|`|Dkylapi6aa	none, a nifty prius or honda civic hybird works best

AEZ75dJ7aa	Pharisees  were the Jewish religion law keepers (I don't know if they still exist today)-  They were the ones that always questioned Jesus and finally turned the Jewish people against him-  they cried for his Crucifixion and death  Jews are Gods chosen people- a race of people not just the country-  They began with Abraham and will always be cherished by God for eternity   Gentiles include all the non Jewish people including us today and because of Jesus we are now seen as "adopted" Jews in God's eyes.     At least that's what I was taught  hope it helps.|`|PRAd6MWwaa	what are Pharisees?  Jews are people who follow the Jewish faith and Gentiles are anyone who doesn't.|`|oxUFlfPvaa	Gentiles have bigger...brains.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	Jews are a race of people that included Jesus.    Gentiles are all other humans outside of Jews.    Pharisees are a Jewish religious party kinda like saying liberal or conservative.
1161eb2411648d1b6121f0ed8cc27250aa	you can explain that you have plenty of clothing, Or you can take what you don't need back. Most ppl giving gifts put in a gift receipt.|`|AA11788494	The only polite thing to do that I have seen is to put where you are registered in the invitations.  However that doesn't mean they will go by it.|`|76nTvO4iaa	You really can't say anything without appearing grabby and rude.    All you can do is hope that you'll get what you need.  If not, maybe the people will give you gift receipts with the gifts so (after writing them a gracious thank you note for their gift) you can exchange them for what you need.|`|4jOaN0WIaa	You shouldn't do anything concerning your baby shower. It should have been a surprise. You are the guest of honor. You don't do anything. Not everyone gets things from registries. I hate registries. I never buy off of them. It is like the person is telling me what to get them and I want to decide what to get them and not be told what to get. A baby needs so many things. I don't know moms to be have to have registries. You should keep quiet and be thankful for whatever you get. You can either return things you don't want or need or you will have to pay for some things that you want. A baby shower is a nice start but you aren't going to get every single thing you need for your baby at your shower.|`|69c729bbc40865df57b81abf4bbab3caaa	It's very rude to tell people what to buy and what not to buy.  All you can do is mention the registry if asked, and if anyone asks what you may need, simply explain that you're well stocked for clothing.  Accept whatever excess clothing you may receive gracefully and if you find later on you have no use for them, either donate them to charity or take them to a consignment shop.|`|4m3z1ztEaa	agree with the first answer  but you can hint  like ask them where you can buy high quality and cheap baby shower  and they will buy it for you|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	Say nothing.  Buy what you need.  Cherish what you're given.|`|d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	"What she said."    You do not "direct" gift giving.  It is rude.  Some people will include the sales receipt with the gift (those who are practical, thoughtful, and have stood in a Returns line without a receipt)... those you can return the item to the appropriate store.  Even if you don't have a receipt, most stores will accept the item back for store credit, and you will likely find SOMETHING else to apply that credit to which will be helpful.    Otherwise, the consignment shop is a good way to at least get some money for the items.  Donating or re-gifting are your last alternatives.      Have a polite day.
nQiLLqGeaa	I can't say if he is or not, because I don't personally know him.    What it sounds like to me is that he's comfortable with you. Very comfortable. Most guys have really good friends, but they aren't touchy-feely with them.    He might feel the same way. He might not. From the way you say he acts, though, he might not *realize* that deep down, he loves you. Sometimes we don't realize we have feelings for a person until we're actually informed about it. If that makes any sense at all.    You're not sure about his sexuality. Maybe he isn't, either.    In my own little fantasy world, you two would be cuddling during some movie or something, then you'd just lean over and kiss him. In reality, that's probably not the best choice unless you feel really up to it. Even if he enjoys it (or enjoys you doing it), he might get scared off because it's so sudden. Plus, if he's never experimented with a guy, he could be confused.    My suggestion is that you find a time to be alone with him (not in school or when other people are around). Sit down with him or in such a way that you're not touching. Tell him something to the effect of:  "Johnny, there's something I need to talk to you about. And please, please don't think it's a joke. . . . I'm in love with you."    And then hopefully he'll hop over the table and tell you he feels the same way.     I'd LOVE to hear how it goes.|`|fcsTUFDLaa	i think ur i a postition to ask what he likes/want...    ur good friends and with just asking it wil not harm at all trust me ;)    im also kinda jealouse abbout ur movie story!  i also wanna have friends like that:P    good luck|`|ohWdv6iHaa	My suggestion is, come out to him first. You need to evaluate how well he handles the news when you tell him that you are gay. If it makes him feel awkward and out of place, then I would at least wait awhile to tell him about the crush. However, if he seems super accepting or almost joyous when he hears the news, then you could tell him right away that you like him, because he will be able to immediatley tell you if he lkes you or not, which will simplify the situation!|`|sIVbcVwtaa	first of all im ttly jealous of u!!! second, i think u shood tell him, cuz none of my straight friends do anything close to that with me, it seems like he cood be gay, and almost all of my friends are girls, but it doesnt mean im st8 (im not) and if he isnt st8 then he'll be ur friend if he rly is a good friend|`|Dkylapi6aa	WTF! IM SO JEALOUS! First, what shool do you even go to?!?!! Sounds like theres alot of gay people! Second, OMG i wish i had a guy friend like that! It already sounds like you guys are a friggen couple! GAHHHHHH my lfie sucks!|`|9hSaOO5Waa	aww...I think there is something there, you should tell him how you feel, even if he isn't gay im sure he would understand :)   If you are too shy to tell him straight then get someone else to tell him, but its better if you tell him yourself :) I hope it goes well between you both :)|`|YIOIUZZlaa	i think he really like you and you should talk to him go for it :)
AA11043053	Buddhist gatherings usually are comprised of two different kinds of experiences: Meditation and/or learning experience.    Meditation can take several forms, from simply sitting in silence, to walking meditation, but the idea is to focus on being in the moment. Sometimes these meditations are led, and other times they simply ring a bell to start and finish. The leader(s) will announce the length of the meditation before they begin.    A learning experience can be a facilitated group discussion or a lecture of sorts. The topic will pertain to Buddhist philosophy or practice.    If, however, the Buddhist gathering is comprised primarily of people from another country, they could have brought their traditions with them. In that case, it's best to inquire from the community leaders.    ^v^ ^v^ ^v^ ^v^ ^v^ ^v^ ^v^ ^v^|`|PCBQbQmraa	We chant we pray we give offering to Buddhist monks. The significance we are showing our devotion to the way to the way of life to the Buddhist monk we offer food to show that we care and support there decisions and honor it.|`|03c287c9e9e2feef723946b70ad122f4aa	No sabe|`|ihOIHE5Aaa	Buddhists don't really hold "services." That's not what it's about. However, I attended Buddhist services at MCRD San Diego. There was a statue of Buddha we could bow to. I believe incense was burned. Aside from that we did a few chants and meditated. Meditation is the main thing, and that can be done anywhere.

JwAUeExQaa	Sorry about the late answer but returning the favour! :]    I haven't looked yet but the views are probably mixed. Although, I personally think it's really sweet.. Different people would react differently. And plus, it's not too recent. It's been about a year since my three month old kitten, Oscar, was run over by a car.. And if somebody would get me a stuffed kitten with "Oscar" on its collar that would be a really nice way to remember him.. it'd just be cute.    I say go for it!  No matter what you choose you're always gonna doubt yourself, but it's good :)|`|iufAPDeWaa	its a sweet idea but personally.... I wouldn't get him that. I think that might make him start thinking about his dog yeah,  but also his uncle. and it might make him sad and dull the mood. would get him something else sweet tho. get him his fav sitcom on dvd or something. try to make him smile! hope I helped. good luck    p.s.  thanks for answering my question too!!|`|e31se8p1aa	That would be great. It'll remind him of something he really loved- and something -or someone- he'll love even more. *Hint* *Hint* *Wink* *Wink* Lol.|`|AA10848621	depends on if he has moved on or not, either way he is going to cry. whether its tears of joy or tears of sadness depends on if he can finally talk about his dog and uncle without tearing up or getting sad. If he is okay with it all then i think it would be a thoughtful gift but if you do have second toughts about it or are still not sure then i think you should go with your gut. hope this helps!!|`|OYGkRASzaa	it will hurt him at frist i think  i mean its kinda a reminder of what he had  but he will love it and you for being there for him  i mean it is a reminder of his of what he had  so it could go both ways|`|csSsVmmraa	it could go both ways, it is sweet.  i think its a good idea though, but dont do the collar that could go horrible. just do the doggie its cute or do the collar and instead of the dogs name just right i love you .. answer mine! thanksss
6737bc1385aaa269c889b6f7c3e1c1e7aa	I'll move out because I'm bored of going to a state halfway across the nation, only to find SSDD all over the place. I like variety in culture, and the U.S. - though it is still inaccurately called a melting pot - isn't variety. I also think it's nice to visit places to see what they're like before I decide if no place could ever be better than America. So far, I've found a lot of great places, and as much as I do love this nation for its leadership, I'm sick of staying in one place with one principle of life every single day.|`|JXMVNEQoaa	stay because every other country is full of liberal elitist hippies also because we have the most economic opportunity, also theres alot to do here|`|GrqsnWtiaa	Stay duhh the rest of the world is poop|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	Stay...laws are less stricter here.

wUVz8bL5aa	Actually, I never had that problem.  People are always choosing my answer.    P.S.  Please pick me.  I really need the points.  P.P.S  I like the way you comment on answers too.  I do that when I ask a question too.  Makes it a lot more fun.  P.P.P.S.   Sure it will.  Because I take one answer like this and make a career out of it and it makes the game that much more fun.  Really, how many of these people that answered will actually come back and see what people said or if you responded.  I should get the points just for you coming back and reading my answer again.  By the way, are you going to pick the best answer tonight?  I don't think you're gonna get a lot more answers.  Besides me of course.  P.P.P.P.S.  Tell you what, I'll ask some question about 6 toed cats and pick you for the best answer.  Fair trade?  I think so.

I'm lazy so definitely laziness is a major factor.     I also simply just forget about the question and never come back to it. And I don't always get a reminder email from YA. Perhaps it ends up in my spam box sometimes.    Another possibility is that the person might of been locked in a trunk for a week like I was one gray December morning. I wanted to kill the man who hurt my daughter so I got in his trunk and was gonna shoot him when he opened it up. It turns out the S.O.B. frickin went on vacation and didn't use his car all week. This was during the heat wave of '79. I used my cellphone to call my son who brought over a drill and some food and water. He drilled a hole in the trunk and I survived off of french fries (the only think that would fit through the hole. I almost died in there.    When the man came back from vacation, he let me out and I simply forgot to kill him. He liked Florida so much he bought a house down there and moved there. I don't know where he lives now.|`|WO1jgqWqaa	Why are you such a point whore?

1e86a17cf7d3d6bd5f1d1eb0376ee828aa	The Book of Mormon does answer some of your questions. However as you are very well aware it does not even touch on many of them, nor would I expect it to. Even if I include the statement made by Joseph Smith about the Book of Mormon I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.    Just because a book is "correct" or accurate does not mean that it is all inclusive. You could have a group of people get together and write the most correct physics book ever written and you would still not be able to find anything in there on how to properly treat the love of your life. The same is true of the Book of Mormon. It was written for a specific purpose and that purpose is summed up on the title page of the book "Which is to show unto the remnant of the House of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off foreverAnd also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations"  The main purpose of the Book of Mormon is not to teach people every aspect about God but simply to help them to believe in Christ, and to help us remember what He has done for us and our ancestors. So just like you wouldn't find anything in a well written physics book about love, you are not going to find everything and anything you may want to know about in a book written to help you believe in Christ.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|LJkPRqN0aa	you want the "proof" how about you do your own research and pick up the book and find it yourself instead of being ignorant towards us? huh? hows that sound?? faith does not involve proof. if you were the least bit intirested you would do your own studying and have some ounce of faith in the church instead of mocking it. im so ashamed that people are so ignorant towards others beliefs....its insulting!|`|WyICbuPqaa	Let's apply your attitude to all of the scriptures.  Job was probably the oldest book in the Old Testament.  If we throw away every other book ever written by a prophet, what would we be left with?  We would be left with almost nothing.  The Bible is not one book, but a compilation of books.  The Book of Mormon is a different compilation of books.  The Pearl of Great Price is an even different compilation of books.  We don't expect that one prophet can know all the knowledge of God - each prophet adds to our knowledge.  They wouldn't be much of a prophet if they didn't.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	This would be like me asking:    "I would be happy to join a Christian Church if someone can show me where in the Torah (first 5 books of the Old testament) it shows that Jesus Christ walked on water."      The Bible was not written in one lifetime and then said "Well, there it is, everything that mankind needs for the next 7000 years".  The bible is one revelation on top of the next.  It was a book of truths that continued to grow year after year.  We make no claim that the Book of Mormon contains every truth that will ever be revealed.  You're pretending as though it does.     Our 9th article of faith states:  We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.    We are bold about our claim that there absolutely will be more light and truth revealed to us in time, just as was true in biblical times.      So, your question is really as silly as mine would be regarding the Torah.      You don't like Mormons...we get it.      As for  2, there was one scripture that came to mind.  Ether chapter 3 when the Brother of Jared sees the Lord, Jesus Christ.    "...and it was as the finger of a man, like unto flesh and blood..."    8.  And he saith unto the Lord: I saw the finger of the Lord, and I feared lest he should smite me; for I knew not that the Lord had flesh and blood.    9.  And the Lord said unto him: Because of thy faith thou hast seen that I shall take upon me flesh and blood; and never has man come before me with such exceeding faith as thou hast; for were it not so ye could not have seen my finger. Sawest thou more than this?    16 Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh.     As for  5, we have no specific doctrine that states this.    As for  3, that can easily be found in the Bible.  In Genesis it refers to the God's, not just God.      You're question isn't nearly as clever as you think it is.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	ok statement  1  first the book of mormon is combination in what is called the triple combination  the D&C teaches the first one.     you have to look at the whole cannon not just the one book.   for apologetic reasons the BoM has 2 disclaimers to read. first, it says if there are mistakes they are the mistakes of men. 2nd, it says that there were contentions in theland, and the righteous nephites became more wicked then the  lamanites. Thats why God sent Samuel the lamanite to preach at zarahemlas' wall and could not be killed.     anyway.     since i am pretty sure NOTHING will convince you, i dont remember the rest to be in the book of mormon. but i do believe the Bible has a verse in the book of revelation that says jesus has a heavenly father and will become our Father and we will become his sons. And you also have to understand WE dont have the First Book of mormon from the Large plates. this is a contention that joseph smith had, that first Book was stolen to discredit the second smaller plates. (hmm enemies of God have been speaking evil of the church no matter what proof is offered.)|`|OQ9SXUAMaa	Even if "you would be happy to join" you couldnt join the LDS Church if you dont do it because of your faith in Christ, you cant go up and say, yeah i wanna join you cause of something someone wrote on yahoo answers|`|7ff82885c9d5d1f343a4664e9d97a78aaa	.|`|AA11714512	I think you are lieing.   I bet even if someone showed you the proof you wanted you still would not join the LDS Mormon Church.   You would than want proof of something else.    It drives me crazy when people get you're and your mixed up.  You should have written   If your own book...    not  you're own book.   You're means  you are .  Your is the possive of you.|`|0qhRIKpSaa	Not only will this guy not join the church, but if Mormons give a good answer to his question, he'll delete the question. The Book of Mormon does not contain all the teachings of the church. There are modern day prophets who will reveal things that have never been taught before.|`|BMQlzUkfaa	What you do not realize is that modern day revelation exists.  In addition, God reveals things to mankind on his own time frame and in his own way.      We now live in the Last Days, when it was prophesied that many things would be revealed.  Many of those things have come forth but that does not mean that God is through talking to us.  He may just have a few more things to teach us.      That is one of the reasons why God calls prophets to serve.  To reveal his will to all mankind and to teach us what is important for us to know at that time.    If you are seriously considering joining the church what you should be asking yourself is this:  Was Joseph Smith a prophet of God?  Secondly ask: Does God still talk to mankind, or has he changed?  Revelation, is it real?  When you ask these questions and get their answers then everything else will fall into place.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	All of them can be found logically and easily in the Book of Mormon.    However it would be casting pearls before swine to share sacred truths with you.|`|2wUvFmrhaa	12 Essential Mormon Doctrines not Found in the Book of Mormon          If the Book of Mormon is the "most correct book of any on earth" (History of the Church, vol. 4:461), then why does it not contain essential Mormon doctrines such as...        Church organization   Plurality of Gods   Plurality of wives doctrine   Word of Wisdom   God is an exalted man   Celestial marriage    Men may become Gods   Three degrees of glory   Baptism for the dead   Eternal progression   The Aaronic Priesthood   Temple works of washings, anointing, endowmants, sealing.      Hum, what can you trust!|`|AA10637643	Haven't you asked this before??  And have we ever claimed EVERY teaching is in the Book of Mormon?  Of course not.  The church is living and the prophets continue to receive revleation.  The Book of Mormon doesn't state that pornography is bad... so should we have it in our home?  No, because our leaders have counseled us not to.  The Book of Mormon doesn't say anything about gambling.  SHould we go put our mortgage on black?  No, because w ehave been counseled not to... same with the Word of Wisdom and many other things that have been revealed in our day.  I have a large suspicion that even IF all this "proof" was laid before you, you would find someone to debunk it in your own way.  The Holy Ghost will convert those who are HUMBLED to accept the gospel.      1. Not doctrine  2. Sorry, that's in the D&C  3. That's in the Bible, Book of Mormon, D&C...   4. Not doctrine  5. Not doctrine    So, here you are, mixing assumptions with doctrine.  3 of the five things you listed aren't even doctrine, so WHY would they be in our Book of Mormon???|`|AA12383652	LOL  Thank you for proving, once again, how ignorant you are of the LDS church and its doctrines.    When did the church ever claim that the Book of Mormon was the source of all of our doctrines???????????      edit  looks like fireball has a little clone|`|dASHruataa	Oh, groannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.  Do they really? .............Believe that stuff?  Egomaniacs, all.  Yes, indeed.  Heavenly Father has a Heavenly Father?  Blasphemy.  Stay the hell away from me, you freaks.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	Did we ever claim that any of this was in the Book of Mormon?  It isn't, and I don't really understand why it would need to be.  The Bible teaches us of Christ and our relationship with our Father, as does the Book of Mormon.  The truths taught in each book often overlap, but not always.  The Bible contributes some truths that are not in the Book of Mormon (or simply teaches them in different ways, which also helps us better learn), and the Book of Mormon contributes some truths not in the Bible.  If they taught the exact same things, what would be the point in reading?  We continue learning and growing closer to our Father through the study of both books, and that's precisely where modern revelation comes in.  If modern prophets taught the same things in the same ways, there wouldn't be any point in having them.  Prophets exist to continue guiding us in the specific situations of our day, but they also exist to continue adding to our knowledge of our Father so that we can have a stronger relationship with Him.  Many of the doctrines you've thrown out have come from modern revelation, and your insistence that they shouldn't only shows that you really don't understand our faith.  The idea of continuing revelation is one of our most cherished doctrines, and the fact that modern prophets continue to impart knowledge to us only cements my belief that they're needed.|`|ejyXhTpGaa	The purpose of the Book of Mormon is to testify of Jesus Christ.  Read the book with this in mind and you find what you are looking for.|`|SeyaUqtmaa	You do not join a religion because someone answers questions like yours.   If you read the Book of Mormon with the intent to find out honestly and sincerely if it were true and then got down on your knees and asked God if it were true THEN you may find that you want to join our Church.   If we answered your questions you would find some way to discredit or refute them. There is a reason that Christians disagree on basic prinicples taught in the bible, we can interpret it however we want. BUT the LDS having a living prophet that helps us understand and helps guide us.|`|IqYQLL0jaa	Their doctrines changes over the time, new prophets. Who knows when the Book of Mormon is changed again to fit the needs of the current Mormons. They do not need new plates to change the message|`|c9cc37aa5013a8d8c99680a318db5954aa	Of the items you mention, some are ot doctrine of th Mormon church.  Those items that are LDS doctrine are in the Bible.|`|LJnyQyNSaa	no one asked you to join, and no one can "convert" you.  That is something you have to feel within yourself.

Being a mommy made me grow up and realize that there is no proof of God.  Just like you can't prove love.  You can't prove God.  You just have to have faith.

The wise old owl and the wise human person asks "Who ?" not just "what ?"    I suggest you study science and philosophy and major world religions, and integrate all of the best aspects of them into your developing  personal living spiritual faith. Look for the supreme spiritual Values: Love, mercy, service to others, truth, beauty and goodness. Reject everything spiritually inferior.    Believing is not just a one-time experience; I continue to have ever more real and significant personal God-conscious experiences.    Here are a few of the bigger ones.  Age 6, I made a moral decision to not cheat with my mother's money when I went to the grocery store; I bought just what she told me and did not buy candy with the change left over. Walking back home, I saw a bright light in the sky in the West, and the sun was in the East then !  For some months after that, I had some psychic-soul experiences that were very unusual.    Ages 6-12, I was given to know that much taught in the churches was wrong.    Ages 12-25, I was an atheist; ages 25-36 an agnostic, and always seeking more Truth in the physical sciences and math.     Age 36, I was reading a confusing book on Absolute Reality; (Monism) and then silently asked: "God, is this True?"  Suddenly, I am fully two-as-one (soul out-of-body and normal body-mind me) and then partly three-as-one ! (mysterious spirit-soul-me) That started my real personal God-conscious searching !    At age 37, on May 24, AD1977, and continuing ever more Real, I am suddenly given, while in sincere prayer, a Sacred Vision of God and Jesus as One infinite, all-loving Light of Life flooding down upon all humans and beings in the universe ! I am taken up by Jesus in Spirit into a special area of infinite Eternal Paradise-God; and my Final Destiny status is partly revealed to me ...much more ...all well beyond all human words to describe.    Since that profound God-conscious Transforming Event, I am not just a believer in mind; I Really Know our loving Father God !  I also know that the pure Spirits of God and Jesus and the Holy Spirit are all upon and within you also !    Do you not realize that GOD indwells you ! and He has now become as you are ! so that you may become as HE IS ! -- all perfect as His Beloved and ever-ascending son of God in Spirit and in Truth: God and Jesus as One in Spirit and you and I and all believers in Him ! All humans are now existing in the Family of God in Jesus here on Earth !     Nothing on earth ever compares to having a personal God-conscious experience !  Seek some in your life, and much more will be granted to you !    Now, as a progressing Jesusonian Christian, I am very selective of Bible verses and phrases. I believe only about 2% of the Old Testament is significant to believe and share. Isa 9:6 on our Creator Father-Son Jesus Christ  is fully True !  Numbers chapter 5 is very sick garbage, etc. I also believe and teach from about 15% of the New (less old) Testament.  The so-called "Gospel of John " is the best by far; it is about 85% correct ! The "Book of Revelation" is so garbled and highly edited that it should not be in the Bible. Rev 21:3-7 is very significant though, and a few other verses or parts of verses therein. You will know in Spirit that which is of the Spirit of God.  Does it sound as if Jesus would have said that ? Or not ?    Please read now, pray for spiritual Truth, and fully believe John 12:31-32 and then 16:7-16.    Email me if you wish for more.    Peace and progress !|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	It is not the Bible which makes me believe in God; it is what is in my heart, what I have lived and experienced and what I know to be true.      Yes, I have doubted, and what made me start believing again is what I have experienced in prayer and meditation.

78VY1OiHaa	Don't forget though that God, if He exists, has freewill too. That makes Him completely responsible for choosing to stand by and watch us all suffer and die when He could change things at any time.

w2zlb5r0aa	It's only assault if you had reason to believe that you were going to be physically raped, if these guys had the ability to carry out such an act, and if the action of bumping you was completely intentional.    That's a lot to prove, but you probably do have a case.    The final question is, what sorts of damages would you like to be awarded?  Were you physically and/or mentally harmed by the gesture, or was it just annoying?|`|JknwX64saa	I would DEFINITLY call that sexual assault!!!|`|2uUctFHEaa	it was sexual harassment not sexual assault. don't evan think for a second that all gay guy's act like that. promise me that ok =)|`|793OI1W6aa	I think in a court of law, they would say sexual harrassment, sexual assault is a stronger charge. Either way, I would hope that you had witnesses, then you could take it further.|`|758f1c16f8aa9b1d1195f3f7d3415ca4aa	Depends on whether it was intentional or not, were you both leaving and there wasn't enough space for you two to move? Or was there enough space and he did it intentionally.  If there was enough space, then yes, it can be considered sexual harassment or assault... if that convo wasn't about you, then it does not apply to the situation.|`|AA12006309	Yes it could be harassment.  You should have probably told someone (management or security).  There's not much that can be done about it at this point, except be more cautious around people you hear talking about you.|`|Ai4tL5G9aa	yes  that is sexual assault|`|AlrCZJ3saa	Theres a high chance hes not human.

Only in recent years have scientists begun to discover that excessive consumption of salt may be associated with serious health problems and that the governments guidelines should be taken very seriously.    u can get stomach cancer osteoporosis and hypertension|`|leCcd0rfaa	You can die of too much intake of *anything*.|`|G3HxgCmvaa	I had a next door neighbor that absolutely HAD to have salt on everything. Yes givin that he was old but salt was the major reason for his death. Salt causes heart problems because it puts too much stress on the heart and arteries and causes heart attacks. And as we all know....heart attacks are a major cause of death. Hope i helped|`|cxKR99KIaa	yes it can clog up your arteries and cause heart problems|`|AA11323749	Yes.    Because it is a poison of course.    All poisons depend on the dose.  Some poisons need only a little to be effective, some need a lot.    Every year an infant or two die as the result of finding a salt shaker and eating lots of salt (in a small body).    Sailors who were stranded at see and drank seawater to quench their thirst died much more quickly than those that eventually died of thirst.    There are several mechanisms for salt poisoning.    This site describes the positive and negative health effect of salt for humans and also the mechanism for salt regulation in the body and the ways poisoning affects the body.    http://www.yogamag.net/archives/1981/hau...|`|sYyNyjwuaa	eventually if you eat too much    it can lead to problems when youre older but if you eat too much im sure it can dehydrate you as well.|`|LoOBJ6RTaa	Yes because salt is loaded with sodium which clogs your arteries which gives you heart problems, thus resulting in death. Or just really severe chest pains.|`|R5MW3BSsaa	Yes, because too much salt causes high cholorestal, and clogged arteries which causes a heart attack!|`|Qkf8il7zaa	yes you can. In a healthy individual a little extra salt intake once in a while will be easily tolerated, but in a patient suffering from hypertension (high BP), it CAN cause stroke or heart attack.    Here is how it works:  Sodium from salt is absorbed into the bloodstream. Here it pulls the surrounding water molecules towards itself resulting in increased blood volume and dehydration of surrounding cells(which activates thirst mechanism).  -increased blood volume causes increased BP  -Thirst causes the person to drink more water and also releases antidiuretic hormones which decrease body's urine output, further increasing   BP.    Hope that helps.      @enginerd  salt is not poison. Please keep your pseudoscience to yourself.|`|2IRKdYEBaa	yes u can. ummm its cuz salt IS a mineral that IS slowly killing your body. so each time you eat salt you just die a little more. but yes if you do you can die|`|h8G1x2ioaa	yes it clogs ur ateries|`|a8wrZXosaa	Yes.  You'll get dehydrated.  But you'd have to eat a lot of salt and not drink any water for a few days :P|`|jnW1hEWJaa	yes. It can lead to hypertension, which can lead to other health problems.  Also you body keeps the amount of na cl inside and outside ur cells in equilibrium.  too much salt in your body could cause some salt to travel down the concentration gradient into the ceells, causing them to shrivel up.  I dont knwo if this is the direct result of salt intake orally.|`|9xdhln93aa	Yes but u could have a heart attack but i would not worry|`|5ELYyvy5aa	Yes, because Salt contains sodium, and that can cause your heart corruption and fail completely to beat. Meaning, You'll have a heart attack, and die a very painful med. or slow death. & This wouldn't going under religion....this would go under Health.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	too much anything can killl.    You can die of drinking too much WATER.|`|0lnamekJaa	Yes you can... Too much salt in your diet will make you die same as if you drink ocean water.     Hypernatremia  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypernatrem...    Hypernatremia is an electrolyte disturbance that is defined by an elevated sodium level in the blood. Hypernatremia is generally not caused by an excess of sodium, but rather by a relative deficit of free water in the body. For this reason, hypernatremia is often synonymous with the less precise term, dehydration.    Water is lost from the body in a variety of ways, including perspiration, insensible losses from breathing, and in the feces and urine. If the amount of water ingested consistently falls below the amount of water lost, the serum sodium level will begin to rise, leading to hypernatremia. Rarely, hypernatremia can result from massive salt ingestion, such as may occur from drinking seawater.    Ordinarily, even a small rise in the serum sodium concentration above the normal range results in a strong sensation of thirst, an increase in free water intake, and correction of the abnormality. Therefore, hypernatremia most often occurs in people such as infants, those with impaired mental status, or the elderly, who may have an intact thirst mechanism but are unable to ask for or obtain water.|`|4sUek7ugaa	Yes.  It upsets the electrolyte balance in your cells.    You have to eat quite a bit, though.    EDIT:  Did you mean long-term?  Too much salt can contribute to high blood pressure in susceptible individuals.|`|VtxtY3hXaa	yes salt softens your bones and causes artery problems|`|TLzknS0eaa	over time-hypertension-high blood pressure/stroke|`|25Cu0kjFaa	There is a health section, y'know.

It can have negative effects on  your body.|`|ttCkz39aaa	Yes because too much salt makes you retain water which causes fat which can cause death|`|ltt2pLg5aa	yes-sodium blood pressure honey...|`|396786e39de6d27bb83a16323b6d33ddaa	yeah....cloggs the arteries so much you die. why is this under religion|`|4QfyirQjaa	YESH! idk y but someone told em so...|`|jgimpZSpaa	um yeah! heart problems!|`|Ynsow6qbaa	Yes you can OD on any thing, even oxygen and water.|`|vkngPEyoaa	Well too much of *anything* is bad for you... even water...

As long as you're drinking plenty of fluids, I wouldn't worry about it.|`|d6EDZqpeaa	yes if you eat a lot of salt you can dies because it has a lot of fat in it and u get high bloodpressure and that makes you really fat.|`|PYIHDmAiaa	probably. eatting 2much sodium increases ur heartrate so eatting 2much could cause problems|`|bK5MJCxhaa	You can die of too much or anything, even drinking too much water.

But is by grace we are saved, as by the law, sin takes opportunity for you and me to break the laws of Moses.|`|jJxUCkkFaa	You are correct, but most Jewish ethnic groups (Ashkenazim, Sephardi,Yemenite jews,ect). are much closer to each other genetically (and to other Middle Eastern people Kurds, Palestinian Arabs) than to non Middle Eastern people. Converts to Judaism    are full members of the Jewish community. The most important tie is religion but ancestry does play some role. You are considered Jewish if your mother was Jewish. Jews that take up other religions are disavowed as apostates. Although they can return to Judaism anytime if they disavow other religions|`|4BQXYxPYaa	In a sense, it isn't a religion either.

I mean during a census, when it asks for your race, I wouldn't put Jewish, I would put my true race, i.e Caucasian/|`|DTog0VZWaa	A good explanation is to liken it to citizenship in a country.  If your parents (in this cause your mom) is a member of the community, you gain the birthright.  However you can also gain it by converting - immigrating to our community.  And you can leave, emigrate.  Being a less than enthused citizen, secular, doesn't give up the citizenship.    It's not a blood thing.  Hitler used ideas of the times to make it into a blood thing to make it easier to justify killing Jews.  We don't give blood transfusions to converts.       Anyone who can't get it after these few simple explanations, doesn't want to.  Some people not respecting Jews...nothing new about that.  Sigh.  Why are people so anxious to hate, even on a simple level, that they won't take Judasim's word for what Judaism is?|`|rYaqoPTHaa	Actually, the nation of Isreal has traits that no other nation has.  Jews not only have their own religion and people group but they also have their own homeland.  Judiasm is obviously a religion, and clearly a people group.  They do seem to be scattered about at the momment but I'm sure they'll all eventually come home.|`|RC5RAzykaa	I think you may be only half correct.  Judaism is a religion, for sure, no doubt.  But by Jewish tradition, if your mom is a Jewess, you are a Jew!  This is a blood tie, beyond question.    It would appear that Judaism is both a religion AND a race.  But I will agree with you that the beliefs of the person should be the defining factor.    On a side note, the Holy Sabbath is not only kept by the Jew.  I am a Christian, and I keep it as well, for it is the Commandment of God, and an everlasting covenant between Him and His people.    Happy Sabbath!!

Amor manet    Una vita, unus amor    Amor nunquam deficiet.- That's in future tense, which fits better in Latin.    Amor patiens (est) - The 'est' may be omitted.    Ego dilecto meo et dilectus meus mihi = I to my beloved, and my beloved to me. That's direct from the Song of Solomon, 6:3.   Dilectus meus mihi et ego illi = My beloved to me, and I to him, Also Song of Solomon, 2:16. The speaker is female.

"Chastity is virtue" - "Castitas est virtus"  This communicates the idea that being chaste is not just a personal choice or religious view but is also part of living a virtuous (excellent) life.      2.  "Loyalty is beautiful" - "Fidelitas est pulchra" This communicates the idea that there is a certain almost magical harmony that surrounds a marital union where both partners have only had sex with each other.  No other emotional baggage ever interferes.    3.  "I wait for greater joys" - "Pro maioribus laetatiis maneo" This communicates the idea that if one waits and endures the hardship of abstaining until marriage the joy on the wedding night will be greater than having sex with someone you do not fully love.

You CAN be atheist and spiritual    2. Is not an obligation of your religion is to convert people? Start making sense and you have an opportunity. Why throw it away?    3. If what we state make you or someone you know QUESTION your belief then maybe it wasn't as strong as you originally thought. Again another opportunity to look inwards to find answers (People out in the world only have their own values. They don't actually know anything).    4. Why would there be an atheists section? How can you discuss a nothing? You can discuss an idea like "God" there is a focus. Tell me where the focus is for Atheism?|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Why should doctors be allowed in the diseases section if they have no diseases?|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Atheists have positions on the subject of religion, and are affected by the positions and others take on this subject.  If religion was a secret for each person and had no effect on anyone else, then atheists wouldn't care in the least about it.  But that is certainly not the case.    Does the presence of atheists and their positions on religion publicly stated offend you?  Do you think they should be forced to keep completely quiet on the subject?  If so, you would have been happier in a lot of history and places (including some places today),  when and where atheism was/is a crime.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|kyBz7Rlmaa	to bad, you did offend you @$$ hole|`|XwQxKwRcaa	It's a topic, not a cult meeting!

You should be really proud of yourself. I a boy said that to ME, I'd slap the heck out of him. You should say, "That's your loss. I'm sure there is a decent, KIND, POLITE, sweet boy somewhere out there who has good taste." If that doesn't work for you, try that new hair removal thing.

I have no idea.|`|0nVZlAljaa	Yes, i think you are bisexual.  but if you need to reassure your self aks this:   Do i look at girls boobs or but?   Do ever feel like touching another girl the way you touch a guy?   and if you ever see a girl in a tank top,  do you ever stare down there?     & sometimes you might not be sure if you want to share this with others,  So just wait til your ready to tel other girls.     If no girl knows about this you can have some fun (:   have a sleepover or pool party all girls.  But if you want to take things so another level;  tell the girl thaat your bisexual (:   I HOPE THAT I HELPED (:|`|WcHP8gz8aa	yea yuh are bi buh jhus 2 be sure go experiment jhus 2 be sure.

I like it when girls wear dresses or skirts.  *Heels - but if you have a hard time walking in them, flats.  *Wear your hair down (I love it when girls style their hair - curly (not too curly) and wavy are pretty)    Hope this helps. :)    Answer my question? http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|ES1bhCyIaa	Hairstyles are a good way to go, make it look nice.

I don't think shoes have any real importance to guys unless your wearing tennis shoes with a formal, so that really doesn't matter. As for hairstyles, that is different for different guys. I like long hair, curly or straight doesn't matter, but clean and well kept does. As for cloths, that depends on the type of guy you want. Think of what type of future you want and try to get some idea of what kind of cloths someone would wear in the type of environment you would hope to be in, in say 5 to 10 years from now. Someone in business would prefer someone who dressed smartly, someone who is going to be a mill worker really wouldn't care. Someone who enjoys nice things but also likes the outdoors would like someone who dresses for the occasion. This may be just as confusing as it is helpful but I'm hoping you get the idea. I'd like a girl who dressed neatly and took care of herself physically while at school but that could put on a pair of jeans and boots and head for the woods on the weekend and would look nice in both environments. Remember, true beauty comes from the inside. Cloths don't need to be expensive to look nice. Hope this helped and good luck.|`|2Oa598ZRaa	Valentine's day is on a saturday!!!!

Atheists are rational by the laws of science, and by these laws their rationale is well-founded. When things cannot be explained by these laws, it is usually assumed that they do not exist. Few atheists will agree to something that cannot be proven or logically inferred-- once again, based on the laws and theories of science.|`|EiGOC8oRaa	Do I worship the devil?

4f928be0b9419dfd5070c2a489577792aa	There is no right answer to your question.  You may feel that it is perfectly ok to take a picture at someones  funeral and someone else believes that it is totally taboo.  I say, you do whatever comforts you during a time of great loss.  I, however, would do it very discreetly and when no one else was around.  Posting pictures on myspace just for   the sake of posting them is not good etiquette,unless they are "private" and meant for out of town relatives whom could not attend the funeral.    I think that it is ok as long as it is done right and for the right reasons.    My husband is a photographer and he was once asked to provide out of town family members with pictures of the deceased and the flower arrangements.  We did make arrangements to do the work prior to family and friends arrival.      We also used to take pictures of babies born premature that passed away soon after birth.  It was comforting to the parents to have a black and white image of their little one.|`|cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	i  dont  know that its  inappropriate in  society terms  but  it  seems  tacky  to  me  somehow.  i think  you  need  to  have  a  pro  handle  it  in  order  to  make  it  OK.  they  wont  use  a  flash  and  t5hey  will  know  how  to  be  discrete|`|z6YwEjlpaa	I think it's odd. Why would you want to remember a loved one as 'dead' ? Posting their pictures on myspace is personal choice but to others it might seem creepy. I know that when you are working on the body you aren't allowed to take pictures of them unelss you are authorized to. Other than that, it's quite illegal.|`|KKh8rikGaa	best answer has to be kana1215 and vintageo...in my opinon|`|ykIleAQ7aa	Well I had to go to 3 funerals last year I lost 3 of my grandparents. For some strange reason my mom's family requested pictures of their parents. And my dad's family requested pictures of his mom. It was very strange because my aunt wanted a picture of each individual person next to my grandmother lying dead in her casket. I really didn't want to! Personally I would prefer to remember the person alive and would like to look at pictures of them being such. I don't get the whole picture of the dead thing although it has been done a lot over the years and was a common practice in the 1800's.  As far as taking pictures of the living at a funeral I understand because sometimes a persons death is the only thing that brings the entire family together. You may not get to see your aunts and uncles or cousins or even siblings if it weren't for a death. So I can understand taking pictures of the living at the funeral (just not pictures of the living and the deceased!).|`|d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	Let's see... we saw pictures of the funerals of:    --- President Ronald Reagan (and the other "recent" presidential funerals)  --- Princess Diana  --- Pope John Paul II  --- Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi    ... shall I go on?  In NONE of these cases were the photos taken disrespectfully.  There HAVE been photos at funerals taken which were USED disrespectfully (funerals of soldiers... misused for political purposes, etc).    So, it's really a mixed bag.  The best thing to do is to politely ASK the family if it would alright to take photos... if granted, do it without being intrusive and be respectful of all in attendance if they wish NOT to be photographed.  THEN, posting and publishing such photos should be the right of the family.  As for MySpace, personally, I think it should be done as a PRIVATE thing, generally, unless the figure was a public figure... and THEN only done respectfully.      Have a polite day.|`|qXg3idqXaa	i think it's really weird when people do this. my grandma loves to do this, and it kinda freaks me out.|`|At2JL4MVaa	Not okay.

To me, that just sounds a little disrespectful to whom' ever has passes away. Who ever has died, I'm sure would not want you to do this.

I hope this helps!  :]|`|RxjX1enJaa	OMG! no its not right! who wud take pic's at a funeral?!

If you are not part of the family of the deceased, and want to take photos for whatever reason, as long as you have permission from the family to do so, and its for educational purposes only. Like learning forensic science, Then its ok.     For any other reason its very wrong, and can be violating someones right to their privacy. Its a very personal thing when someone dies.|`|AA11788494	Well back in the older days it was very common.  I remember seeing some of my family's pictures.  It creeped me out. I remember my grandma telling me she did not want her picture taken when she died.|`|7b31ddb38e2072009948a9a8c2511aeeaa	I don't think there is anything wrong with it at all. In fact, I think the whole fear of death and disrespecting the dead is ridiculous. I think this country needs to come to terms with death. The funeral industry has everyone fooled into thinking what they want just so they can make the money they want, how they want to do it. It's insane. We should all go back to green funerals, where everyone sees the people dead in their own home, take pictures and look at them. That's how you PROCESS death, that is how you come to accept that someone is actually dead. It's the way life ends, plain and simple.|`|uXAFz4qdaa	It really depends on the family.   I have pictures of me at my grandmother's funeral. I remembered there were a lot of pictures taken that day because it was almost a family reunion. Of course it wan't a happy event, but we never get to see eachother and it was comforting to remember there were many people there to grieve with and comfort each other. Of course we have no pictures of my Grandmother's body. I could see that being weird. But it really depends on your relationship.        However if you are just a friend/coworker/colleague. It is NOT ok.|`|IOBkadWfaa	When someone has just passed, it is a very delicate time with emotions often running high.  I have known people that don't mind at all and others that believe this is completely inappropriate, it's a matter of opinion.  My advice is that a person should speak with the family members that are organizing the funeral because these are usually the ones closest to the deceased.  If someone wants to take pictures, they should discuss their thoughts and ask the family's opinions and input.  It never hurts to ask but be sure to respect the decision that is made.  I don't think posting pictures of the funeral or the deceased lying in state on Myspace would be appropriate but if a person wants to do a sort of memorial on Myspace, there are many ways to do that tastefully to honor the deceased.  I'm sorry that what your friend did upset you, and you should discuss this with them.  My grandfather passed away last year and one of my uncles took a picture of him in private before the funeral.  This was agreed upon by all the siblings and each got a copy.  When my father passed, there was no formal funeral, but the entire extended family gathered to remember him and celebrate his life.  It was like a reunion as we are scattered across the US and there were many pictures taken as we remembered my father.   I hope your father enjoys a long life and on that fateful day, make your wishes known.|`|0K1ALWN2aa	where do u live bc if u live in the hood then no but the rich side  yes|`|A0wehpsOaa	i say as long as you dont take pictures of the dead person and dont put it on myspace and such. then it should be ok, just in case if you want ur last memorys of that person|`|XTXuMmAeaa	Don't take a picture at a funeral that's to sad to take pictures then you might get upset so don't take pictures at something sad like that like you said you wouldn't like people taking pictures at your dads funeral so don't take one at some one else's|`|ULe4IDs4aa	I think it's a little disrespectful. And to put on myspace!! That's just putting it over the edge|`|AA10025824	I think its perfectly okay.  Some might think its disrespectful and if you are taking pictures of people who don't want their picture taken it probably is, but that goes any time.|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	No because it is a private matter in which only family and friends should be allowed to take pictures. Nothing else. It is wrong to do that because you aare selling the pictures of some dead person. Morally wrong on so many levels.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	Now you said that, I can just imagine a group of people taking photos at a funeral in the classic myspace emo pose with a casket in the background|`|LsBS5bOCaa	I've done it once before and it didn't feel right. As far as posting them, nah! I wouldn't. Who wants to look at a dead picture?|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	That it's disgusting and reprehensible.    People are grieving.    It's not a party.    POST them? Geez. Your friend has no heart or human feeling.|`|yUWa6WpEaa	the last funeral I went to  I brought a small digital camera.  I was not sure if I would use it but I brought it just in case.  when I was there I got a strong feeling that I should not. so I didn't and as it turned out  the camera did not have any batteries in it. so I think that was an obvious sign from the universe that for me in that situation it was not a good idea. but me advice for everyone else is. be careful. If you know the deceased and funeral guests intimately enough to be  absolutely sure no one  will be offended then go for it . if not don't.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	NO    why would you even need to ask this  its a funeral not a party|`|pV6K2mm5aa	I think it's tacky - but whatever.

I have no strong feelings about it.|`|pWnsUHMBaa	no  i wouldnt   pictures are supposed to cherise special moments   i highly doubt a feneral is a happy moment|`|AA10453678	it's tacky, insensitive and gross.|`|glynFK9haa	That's so rude!  Why would you take pictures at the memorial of someone who just died?  And posting them online?  Why would you do that?  It's like, "Hey, look!  This is my dead grandma!"|`|QI74CxD0aa	In some cultures, taking pictures at a funeral is quite common.    But posting such pictures online is a really bad idea.  It is disrespectful to the person who has died.  Such pictures should be for the family only.|`|CkIeCNS4aa	At my father's funeral, my cousins took silly pictures and then posted them to their myspace with a caption saying something to the effect of "acting gangsta at a funeral".  It offended me because I felt like they didn't care that their uncle and my father had just passed away.  Personally, I think it's a bit rude, but that's just my opinion.|`|mcqO9Hgxaa	i think for some people it is okay,  but i dont believe its right to post online|`|nrnVqh7iaa	As long as you don't ask them to prop up the body, or put your arms around it and throw up signs... I guess it is okay.|`|KWvGUoW6aa	Nothin' wrong with it.|`|lTOeMNnraa	No way  like that's so disrespectful|`|uhxtlZGJaa	NO!!!!!!!!!!    THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING IN THE PHOTO THAT YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO SEE!!! SUPER NATURAL      http://youtube.com/cyclops23666|`|LLnNjH94aa	Not okay.  Cameras shouldn't even be taken to a funeral service.|`|cRz31MlMaa	It would be totally inappropriate to take photos at a funeral omg what kind of sick person would do that and then want to post them on the internet its just disgusting.|`|QUCIdBp5aa	I think they're cool artistically, but probably not to the family who lost a loved one.  I don't think I'd take photos overtly as the family might be sensitive to it.  Have you got a telephoto?    If you're close to them, you could ask how they feel.  I don't think myspace would be appropriate, though.|`|qQXeAAgHaa	i think it is a time to remember and even if it may be sad your going to want ti remember it jusst dont take pictures during the cerimony
qS8pxDhKaa	Yes, indeedy. It would be Laoch na Filochta (Pronounced "Leeckh nuh Fil-yee-uckh-tuh), literally "Warrior of Poetry." You can't say it as a compound noun like in English.      Laoch = Warrior  Filocht = Poetry    ch is a gutteral sound in standard Irish Gaelic like the ch in Scottish 'loch' or German 'noch nicht.' It is pronounced like an h or an r in some northern Irish dialects but it's easier to stick with standard Irish pronunciation for starters. .

jard50Yiaa	Here is a forum for Methodist Christians, you may find more answers here...    http://christianforums.com/forumdisplay....|`|SY3aYLMraa	Methodism is a movement of Protestant Christianity represented by a number of denominations and organizations, claiming a total of approximately seventy million adherents worldwide.[1] The Methodist movement traces its origin to the evangelical awakening in 18th century Great Britain. Methodism followed from the work of John Wesley, who was an Anglican clergyman. Although "Methodism" in Great Britain today is commonly taken as "Wesleyan Methodism", there were various Methodist denominations, until the final Deed of Union which, on 20th September 1932, brought together the Wesleyan Methodist Church, the Primitive Methodist Church and the United Methodist Church, to form the denomination today formally known as the Methodist Church of Great Britain. Wesley sought to keep Methodism as a revival movement within the Church of England, and a significant number of Anglican clergy were known as Methodists.[2] Other 18th century branches of Methodism include Welsh Methodists, later the Calvinistic Methodists, from the work of Howell Harris,[3][4] and the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion through the work of George Whitefield. The influence of Lady Huntingdon and Whitefield on the Church of England was a factor in the establishment of the Free Church of England in 1844. Through vigorous missionary activity Methodism spread throughout the British Empire, the United States, and beyond.    Early Methodists were drawn from all levels of society, including aristocracy.[1] But the Methodist preachers took the message to labourers and criminals who tended to be left outside of organised religion at that time[citation needed]. Wesley himself thought it wrong to preach outside a Church building until persuaded otherwise by Whitefield.[5]    Doctrinally, the branches of Methodism following the Wesleys are Arminian, while those following Harris and Whitefield are Calvinistic. [2] Wesley did not let this difference of interpretation change his friendship with Whitefield, and Wesley's sermon on Whitefield's death is full of praise and affection.[6] Methodism has a very wide variety of forms of worship, ranging from high church to low church in liturgical usage. The Wesleys themselves greatly valued the Anglican liturgy and tradition, and based Methodist worship in The Book of Offices on the 1662 Book of Common Prayer.[7]|`|oJxceG0Kaa	All I know is that they were founded by John Wesley and adhere to strong work ethics.  It is a Protestant denomination which means they also disagree with traditional Catholic orthodoxy and reformation.  Most of the Methodist churches I have attended were very friendly and they love to sing.  They believe in the Trinity and Bible and are thus Christian.|`|03rOCajTaa	the church I attended  we drank grape juice and used bread not wine and wafers  they are against the psychic stuff. and of that sort  they are okay with taking meds  they believe in the whole Jesus on the cross thing and that is how you are saved and get into heaven  they believe satan causes evil   they are a bit more lenient then baptist and not quiet so voicestrus  sing out the old hymnal books  ask you have question email me if I don't know the answer I can ask my mom she still attends the methodist

However, if you do not have the nerve to verbally express your sexuality to your friend, you could write him a letter and give it to him after you guys hang out while he is leaving your presence so he has time to think about it.|`|wr10vJgBaa	just sit him/her down and tell them. i came out to my friend about a year ago. she understood and if your friend is worth keeping around he/she won't freak out a good friend will love you no matter what.|`|JknwX64saa	I think that you should tell him face to face.

AA10969604	if the first is "meeeee", the last will be "mee!!". the fourth sounds always sounds like its got an exclamation mark to it, the first just goes on.    HOPE THIS HELPSX|`|ab12bf1cc4fcd2264e88fe8e2ee186f2aa	Here's how I differentiate them:   1st tone = the sound of "a pin or nail [metal object, not those on fingers] dropping on a plate": think of the tone when reading a sentence.  4th tone = the sound of "a heavy object dropping on a drum and rebounding": think of the tone when reading an exclamation.|`|9o2NVEARaa	Why indeed there is an easy way to tell the difference. You see, the first tone pinyin is a steady kind of tone. If you play an instrument, the first tone sound would be like you holding a note and not changing. The fourth tone pinyin sounds like when you are disappointed and say, "Oh." So it's a kind of a change in, I guess, pitch of your voice, going from high to low.    Another way to think about it is if you think of a car that has to pass over certain kinds of conditions in the road. The first tone pinyin is like the car just riding over a flat zone. The fourth, on the other hand, is the car going down a hill. The car represents your voice tone, and the road is the 'shape' of the tones that your voice has to take.|`|DyrjclUBaa	The first tone is called the "flat" tone. there is no change in the pitch of the character.     The 4th tone is called the "down" tone. in this tone, there is a change in pitch in the character. The pitch goes "down" like an accent.

6Whz1p5Eaa	Theres nothing inherently unbiblical about polygamy. The Song of Songs, the Bibles "relationship handbook" describes a polygamist relationship.    In this day and age... divorce is the appropriate route though, since polygamy is illegal in our country, and polygamy is considered immoral.|`|AA11232725	The chief would take care of his wives just like the polygamists in the Old Testament did but he wouldn't take on any more wives because after getting saved he sees that God's will is for one man to be joined to one woman.    When anyone gets saved they still have to deal with what they did in the past in a Biblical manner. God hates divorce, so if someone is a polygamist or they married an unsaved person, then they have to honor their agreement with that person and trust in God to work it all together for good.    1 Corinthians 7:10  Now to the married I command, yet not I but the Lord: A wife is not to depart from her husband.  11  But even if she does depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband is not to divorce his wife.      12  But to the rest I, not the Lord, say: If any brother has a wife who does not believe, and she is willing to live with him, let him not divorce her.  13  And a woman who has a husband who does not believe, if he is willing to live with her, let her not divorce him.  14  For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.  15  But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases. But God has called us to peace.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	He's really only married legally to one of them, so he probably kicks the rest out of the compound|`|W0Ovbpq0aa	let every man have his own wife. 1 Cor 7:2 and Ephesians 5:31,|`|VRl1jENHaa	The woman he married first is his wife; all the rest are not.

Noah probably would be polygynous too if he did not have to build the ark.  Also the right word for one man with multiple wives is polygyny.|`|oJxceG0Kaa	When one makes a commitment to Christianity they often have many moral choices to make.  Once the Holy Spirit convicts a believer of a particular sin, then inevitably the decision must be made which would fall within God's approval - not society or the law - but God's morality.  Cultural ties would be hard to break, but not impossible.  Part of the Christian call is to deny self and follow Christ.|`|3KD6RRhPaa	Interesting Q. Its the same in Africa, for many tribes there believe in polygamy and its men have more than one wife.    We must return to the Word of God and use this as our guide. You see, originally God made man and gave him one woman by using one of his ribs.  The Bible does not teach about polygamy.    The Bible teaches us that, "Man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh" (Ephesians 5:31).  And...    1 Thimothy 3:2 says, "A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, of good behavior, hospitable, able to teach....And so...    If this man already has several wives, he cannot kick out his other wives. He needs to accept the heavenly gospel of the water and the Spirit in his position as a husband of wives....for..    Its a fleshly matter...not a spiritual one

I don't have time to go into it with Bible verses, so email me if you need further explanation.  Basically the way I see it two things are the cause of worship on Sunday and not Saturday (The Sabbath).  The mainstream Jews went to tabernacle on Saturday, so when the Christian sect of the Jews were persectuted the Christians met in the same types of places but on Sunday in order to avoid the persecution. The other reason, which I like more is that Jesus rose on a Sunday morning. I'm not sure how Biblical about that it is, but I like the idea, and I celebrate his ressurection on Sunday as well as any day, only I celebrate at the church building with hopefully other believers.|`|GrqsnWtiaa	Christians actually worshiped on Saturday, They changed it to differ themselves from Jews who also worshiped on Saturday,changing it to Sunday|`|AA10471892	Long before Constantine Christians in and around Rome would gather early on Sunday mornings for communal prayers and the singing of a few psalms before going off to work.    It appears the custom developed for the early Christians to gather on Sundays for this purpose in order to distance themselves from the Jews and to prevent the appearance that they were Judaizing; that is, following after Jewish practice and custom.  In Acts 20, we see an example of Christians gathering on a Sunday, and the apostle Paul preaching on that day.    .
de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	When I was 11 and my brother was 14 he had a terrible breakout and my brother, my father and I were eating lunch in an outdoor restaurant and this woman came over to our table and told my father off saying looking at my brother had caused her to lose her appetite and the sight of him ruined her meal and on and on, and mind you, my brother is sitting right there, and my father let her rant and when she paused for breath he put down his fork and looked at her for a few seconds and said "Madam, my son's face will clear up and he will be very handsome (which turned out to be true) but you will be ugly all your life." The woman stood there in shock for a minute then left w/o saying another word. So whenever I see someone with bad acne I remember that day and just know that their face will clear up and anyone who judges them or feels repulsed by them will be ugly all their life.|`|AA11788494	I always feel bad for them because I had acne really bad in school and into my adulthood.

hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

Now,  Jesus is my elder brother and the one sent to show me how to live  a life that will help me return to my heavenly state.   About fifty years after his death, people started writing down  things that He supposedly said and did.    About fifty years ago  He dictated a book through an atheist college professor; that  correct much misinformation that has attached itself to  christian teaching in the last 2000 years.  I believe that Jesus could do that even today.  So I study  His latest book which He titled "A Course In Miracles"  Not an easy read, but much easier to understand than the   hodge podge of Christianity we have now

Matthew 6:25 Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing? 26 Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? 27 Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?   28 So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; 29 and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 30 Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?   31 Therefore do not worry, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we wear? 32 For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. 33 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things.

Are you not much more valuable than they? 27Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life[b]?     28"And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. 29Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 30If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? 31So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' 32For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.

If you ask anything in My name, I will do it." (John 14:13-14)    "So Jesus answered and said to them, Assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain, Be removed and be cast into the sea, it will be done.  And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive." (Matthew 21:21-22)    So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.  For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.  If a son asks for bread from any father among you, will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent instead of a fish? Or if he asks for an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?  If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!

9vOBtO1Oaa	I pay little or no attention to what is said that tries to convince me of what I know I am not.  For example, it fell to be my misfortune to live in a little town of very conformist, uniformest people. Most of them full or hear-say, prejudice and quick judgment without troubling to discover or explore into what they believe is their conclusion to everything, even if one feels like guffawing at their quickness to make a closing, yet very ignorant remark.  I am an artist and very eccentric. I do not try to disguise or deny my vocation, nor my lifestyle, way of thinking which they've decided is blatantly unconventional.  I have been called crazy, deranged, insane, even to my face. Sometimes a 3rd party will simply feel responsible to tell me what has been said...my sole comment to them is : 'Hmm...is that so? Well I seldom stop to listen or place trust in the jabbering of magpies!'

9JQvRXWsaa	my health teacher told me that a man who had sex with a woman, will know whether the person is male or female. because it feels different when a guys penis penetrates a real vagina versus an operational made vagina    im not against any transgendered people, im just putting out what ive learned from my sex ed class.|`|3OZgcntfaa	Stick to your hand, that way you don't have to worry about the sex VS gender question and we don't have to worry about you reproducing.

A transsexual women (I'm assuming you're asking about a transsexual women and not a transsexual guy) has always been female.  She changes her body to match her gender identity.  You have a gender identity too.  But yours matches your body.  Can you imagine being a guy in a girls body?  Doesn't sound like fun does it?    Transsexualism is a naturally occurring birth condition.  A brain-body mismatch if you will.  You said:    "Kat. as a regular male i don't want to end up with someone who earlier had the same parts as me"    How shallow of you to judge somebody by body parts they may or may not have.  Whatever happened to judging a person by their personality and character?  Your comment also demonstrates misplaced HOMOPHOBIA.  As I already explained she was NEVER a male.    For your information there are lots of women who are infertile for various reasons.  There are even some natal women born without a uterus or vagina (Google MRKH syndrome).  There are even women born with XY chromosomes (Google Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome).    Face it, sex and gender are waaayyy more complicated than you realize.  You can read more here:    http://www.LynnConway.com      After digesting this information you should see that you need to re-evaluate your own thoughts and biases.  And don't forget the stereotypes you were taught growing up as well.  When it comes to transsexual people they (the stereotypes) are all wrong.    Judge a person by their personality and character, not by their birth condition.|`|oeLAXHDnaa	If she gets a hard on during foreplay, its probably not the genuine article.|`|OUARGXBfaa	all u can do is get to know them and when  sex is about to happen u can be like no thank u i thought u had some thing different there.

Christianity changed when Jesus came to Earth bringing Christians the New Covenant to live by or the New Testament.  Church can be you body (Earthly vessel) referred to as a temple in the Bible.  Church is and should be a place of worship and sacred reverence and fellowship to hear the Word spread.  And if the Word you're hearing from your pulpit is not creating togetherness, tolerance, love and forgiveness then perhaps you should be searching for another Church.

God has ever had only one church on earth. We sometimes speak of the Old Testament Church and of the New Testament church, but they are one and the same. The Old Testament church was not to be changed but enlarged (Isa 49:13-23; 60:1-14). When the Jews are at length restored, they will not enter a new church, but will be grafted again into "their own olive tree" (Rom 11:18-24; Eph 2:11-22). The apostles did not set up a new organization. Under their ministry disciples were "added" to the "church" already existing (Act 2:47).|`|Ld16o3kYaa	is is a place where you go compare clothing!!|`|0EAHk0Baaa	I go to church to be closer to God.

AA12290249	well, as humans we all judge. it's just normal for us. it doesn't always mean we are shallow or anything, it's just what comes to our mind. we all judge even if we don't want to admit we are or don't think we are.    i myself judge by probably everything just like everyone else does. it's pretty hard not to. there's nothing wrong about judging, just as long as you don't act upon it or let it make you not want to get to know a person. it can be hard to be that way, but it's really the best way you can be when it comes to judging ha ha.    i'll answer your questions.. ha ha um. answered the first one.. second. the last person i judged wasn't nice and i thought to myself "she isn't very nice" but even though i think she's rude, i'm not gonna be rude back to her because i think she deserves it or anything, i'm just gonna ignore it and let her live her life how she wants. if she wants to be rude, then let her go for it. she'll learn for herself. same goes with people who are over weight, or smelly, etc etc etc. they will learn themselves eventually that they need to change.    i don't think it was wrong of me to judge because i didn't act upon it. but that's just how i see it. i can see how people think it's rude and shallow and wrong to judge before you get to know them, but i believe as long as you don't let that judgement keep you from getting to know the person, then you're just fine.|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	I judge everyone, although I do try to be open minded.    Its an automatic response like How old they are dictates how I would approach them E.G. I would Show more respect to an old person and just say Hi to someone my own age ...|`|NAL9SZuXaa	sure do....& i consider it for my own good. Yes, im told that im not supposed to judge, but i only do it so that im not unpleasantly surprised in the end|`|hzQ2aZz0aa	I try not to judge people at all, allthough this is hard sometimes...I do not wish to be judged by others and believe that a person can and will be anything they want to be|`|roFGlldOaa	Actually yeah I honestly do judge people. I judge them how popular they are... although I'm not proud to say it. LIke my bf for example. He wasn't popular until 5th grade when he became friends with the most popular kid in out grade. (This other kid was my bestest friend ever!) So, I din't like him even though he liked me. And now that he's popular I really like him a lot. I'm sad to say that if he never became popular, I'd never have gone out with him! Kind of SHALLOW... but you said be honest.|`|lA7oIFUVaa	i hate to admit it, but yes, i judge people....but it's not like i say anything about them, unless i know them personally....i  judge normally on the way people look, and act...which is totally the opposite of what i want to do...i hate it, but yes, i judge:(|`|McSE0ES4aa	Of course i do. To tell you the truth, i'm always wrong. I mostly judge people negatively but i find out how amazing they are after wards. The last person i judged, i thought he was a big mouth and talks a mile per second without thinking but he happened to be a person capable of expressing his feelings well.

Humans like to create because God is the creator. Humans need relationships because God is a relational being.    God is Spirit, not flesh. I think you and I both know He doesn't have sexual organs.|`|QVFjO5m0aa	Well if God was in existence before us wouldn't that make us misshapen freaks?
wB3AbJyLaa	The Scriptures tell us that the earth is round: "It is He who sits above the circle of the earth" in Isaiah 40:22. The word translated circle here is Hebrew word chuwg, which is also translated circuit or compass depending on the context. That is, it indicates something spherical or rounded, not flat or square. The Book of Isaiah was written between 740 and 680 B.C. This is at least three-hundred years before Aristotle suggested, in his book "On the Heavens," that the earth might be a sphere. It was another two-thousand years later, at the time when science believed that the earth was flat, that the Scriptures inspired Christopher Columbus to sail around the world.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	OOOOHH...are you a REAL atheist??    Wow! That must make you, like, the baddest kid in all of 3rd grade!    Gee!      FYI,  I don't believe God exists because the Bible says so.    I know  God exists for a number of reasons, but if you had to pin it down to a book it would be  the Summa Theolgica says so.    (No you haven't heard of it...it's a very old book, the sort that grown ups read...the kind your Mommy won't let you color in.   http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/B...  http://www.newadvent.org/summa/ )    In any case, it contains several logical proofs for the existance of God. When you get old enough to read it, you might be able to find a copy in the library.  Be warned though, it is full of big words like "demonstrable".     http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/aq...    BTW... not only does the Bible NOT say the Earth is flat...the Ancient Greeks determined that the Earth was a sphere  Eratosthenes measured the Earth diameter more than 15 centuries before Copernicus and Galileo were even born. Eratosthenes was born in Cyrene in 276 BC, and, upon the death of Callimachus, was offered the post of "Chief Librarian of the Mouseion", a most highly respected position. His measurement of the Earth diameter was the most exciting of his achievements, although not the only one. He knew the Earth is round, and knew that shadows cast by the sun in Alexandria and Aswan (Syene) were unequal. He took measurements inside a deep well in Syene and along an obelisk in Alexandria a year apart, on the same day of the year. Knowing the distance between both cities, and using simple calculations, he estimated the Earth diameter at 7,850 miles. Today, we know that Eratosthenes' estimate was only about 0.5% off.     Now you better run and wash up now, it's past your bedtime.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	I believe in God because He convinced me to do that.

Atheists see the sun rise in the morning and set in the evening. Therefore atheists believe that the earth is flat.    It is ridiculous because the logic is based on false premises.    God spoke to people. People recorded what God said and this is the bible. God is the primary source. The bible is a secondary source and open to interpretation. Some interpretations are true and others are false.    Suppose God came in person instead of relying on the written word and speaking through other people. God would be even more real.|`|Nu6HaIfgaa	Could you provide what scripture it says that's in pls|`|yN3fWUCuaa	Ahhh, sagacious one.

Man could not write what he had not yet experienced. In saying that--the bible says that the earth is flat because that is all they knew then.

According to my tampon box, I can swim, hike, climb mountains, and play football while on my period. Lol|`|QEd4AC22aa	You failed to quote where Scriptures says the earth is flat.  I missed that one.

Study the first 2 LAWS of thermal dynamics and SCIENCE disproves evolution|`|DDFgKxcaaa	1st Samuel 2:8 ... for the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and he hath set the world upon them.    Job 38:4 Where wast thou when I (the Lord) laid the foundations of the earth?    Psalms 75:3 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.    Psalms 104:5 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.    Jeremiah 31:37 Thus saith the Lord; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath,    Micah 6:2 Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord's controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth    Of course, the earth has no foundation, whether composed of pillars or some other form. The earth is a spherical rock floating in space. Its completely unsupported and certainly not fixed in place.
TOBYij3Qaa	no, sorry, is it good?
ugdutKAnaa	Well, when I had problems with Black men, because that is all that I've date so far in my life, I realized that part of the problem was me. I raised my standards and honestly today I don't have much trouble with men I date or hang out with. I've learned to nip it (the problems) right in the bud when something occurred.     This whole Black men being "bad" and "sorry" is bs...because believe me a Latino, White, or Asian man will do you the same way. I understand as a community it might not be so great compared to other groups but don't believe all the hype.|`|92iuiuZKaa	I get frustrated with ALL MEN! IGNORANT LITTLE BASTARDS!!

The trolls would love to use you as an example of a "militant lesbian feminazi".|`|da4zS4AOaa	I'm black african I haven't been close to a black american "man/boy" (they scare me) most of them. Most of them look at me in a lust type of way. it's really annoying. I would like to find one that's decent and nice. I think they represent themselves really badly and that's why most people view them in a certain way which they'll get mad. I'm scared of being mistreated too. I've seen a lot of them that are really cute, when it comes to personality i just get turned off.    I don't know i guess our cultures are different.     I have attraction to black americans (who are professional, talk and act in a classy manner) black british people and others from different countries or people of other races |`|N9WzNLsRaa	Well, I can honestly say that none of the black men in my life mistreat me... So, I don't get frustrated with them. My relationship with black men is great.    I don't get sexually harrassed daily... I mean sometimes I get the catcalls, but I get that from men of all races and it doesn't happen often. I just ignore it. Doesn't really bother me.|`|wkKJpCwRaa	Actually it really depends on the male himself. I saw a male today who I was close to falling in love with, just perfect, if only I had gotten to know him longer he would be my husband. I could live with him. Then I saw another today who I wanted to literally kill for being disrespectful to my father. However, what I've noticed that the one I wanted to kill was a teenager and the other an adult. Too many black men I know are way too disrespectful and I'm sick of it, I'm not gonna put up with the bullsh*t.

1d40jvLnaa	The egocenticism begins on page one of the bible when they attempt to make you believe the earth was created before the sun and stars, as if the earth were the center of the universe. How can anyone take this book seriously?|`|AA10652430	It is ridiculous, in sense, because not everyone wants to be married and some want to stay celibate like Paul in the NT (Corinthians, I believe) and I'm one of those ppl. I mean, marriage is okay for whomever-not everyone is going to be married, but everytime I think of myself married, or imagine myself in such a committed relationship I always draw blanks (akin to turning on the TV to an analog channel full of WHITE STATIC). I see nothing there, cuz I have trust issues.  And religion is overrated; I think it gives some people reason to be egocentric and the ppl who don't fit in (like me), must be having a hellish time around ppl and family that believe in such a religion.|`|VCi8XUPCaa	YES, absolutely,you got it girl!|`|kA0xb0MVaa	If you start from the beginning, it is ego.  God created, heaven and earth?  Really, why.  He was bored?  No because he needed a place to put all the people who worship him.  Although in defense of His ego, I will admit, He gave us "free will" to choose not to.  So in short God created man to have someone to worship him.  If that isn't based on ego I have absolutely no idea what is.    Religion isn't designed to make us all feel important.  It is designed to make us all feel as though we are the worthless sinners that we are.  Whatever!  Because if we are worthless, evil sinners, and he still loves us (provided we leave a check) then we aren't the sum of our worst deed.  And just for the record, I don't know any rational people who think of others solely because of their worst deed, except the Christians in my little world.  "You shouldn't let your children hang out with his, he did a lot of cocaine in the 80's."   "You shouldn't vote for him, he smoked pot in college."  Silly.    One of the other contributors to this question mentioned that it was originally designed to have rules/law.  Fine.  Good.  Except now we have laws.  We have courts.  We have jails, do we still need heaven and hell?  Well yes.  We need it heaven as a reward for not going to jail, for doing the right thing, for doing what we are supposed to.  We need hell, for when prison or the death sentence just isn't enough punishment.      Sin is sin.  So premarital sex is as evil as.....say....sending thousands to their death for oil.  Silly.  Just silly.  The whole thing is plain silly.|`|de2AwHpHaa	of course  to have god be a part of even the most mundane life  and for earth to be the only body in the universe with life  the epitome of arrogance|`|W7a5k7Zsaa	Honest and accurate insight|`|nw0fqXj9aa	Yes. It is said that we are adapted to this universe, not it to us. It is very egocentric to assume otherwise. And Phoenix, I see you, doin that thing...|`|0bOSZIzJaa	Yes.  It makes people feel like their lives have an undying purpose, and that there is always someone out there listening to you.|`|v92aRylQaa	Feel important? Isn't looking down no others a sin? AKA Pride?     If Christians were more Christ-like (hence the term Christians) they would be a more peaceful people. I mean look at Jesus. He was practically a hippie. He had a long beard, wore sandals, and was all about Peace, and did not look towards material possessions to make him happy. He also did not look for differences in others separating himself from people to make himself feel superior to others. HE LOVED ALL. Following the morals of Jesus is not a bad thing. Fictional or not he seemed like a pretty peaceful person. It's when these Christians try to act God like where it's a problem. Of course it's only some, not all who act vengeful and judgemental. Especially here on Y!A.    It's not only religion in which people become egocentric. This happens everywhere especially at school (cliques), but I know what you mean and I agree some people use their religion to feel powerful, to feel a sense of belonging, use it to separate themselves from others, rather than be at peace.|`|YE0qcQX4aa	Go blog somewhere else. this is Yahoo Answers.|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	religion doesnt make me feel important. why would it? so that theory makes no sense...ok, this whole one is weak i tell ya, very weak...|`|9a35060b1f035af576ef9d57f250b28aaa	People will murder without religion, it doesn't make a differences.    If I have to pull an article of an atheist couple murdering people, you would be embarrass to make that comment.    You have to accept the truth, there is no person that will stop with no religion.|`|BNHocZaiaa	The original purpose of religion was to quell fear of the unknown.  Later, it was perverted by leaders to control people through guilt, and by exploiting their fears.  And it was also used to accumulate wealth.  VAST amounts of wealth.  The people who did these things were highly egocentric.
6El0zpBJaa	He was born in Bethleham.     Of course he has always been--he is God (the Son).    The Bible says "In the beginning was the Word (Jesus) and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."    Jesus came to earth to be born of a virgin. When the angel came to Joseph (the earthly father of Jesus) to tell him about Jesus' birth, he said, "You will call him Jesus for he will save the people from their sins."|`|DRSv6SOLaa	From The Heart Of God.  :)|`|NsLtN7oLaa	Nazareth, I hear.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	Heaven.

The crowds just said he was Jesus of Nazareth because that was the prophecy. Jesus just called himself the Son of man. He never said he was the son of God. Luke was the only one to describe Jesus' birth events in the Bible and if you read Luke carefully he has kind of a disclaimer about it in the beginning of chapter one so noone knows for sure of those events

Hell is a place God made for satan and his crew. These people did not want to be in God's presence. God's presence is not felt in hell-which why it's hell.    4) Right.

The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	1. Because we want to save you from Hell.  2.I do not hate anyone.  3.He does not wish for anyone to perish, rather that they accept Him, and join Him in Heaven.  4.Only if you repent with a true heart, you can't go running around killing people your whole life, then all of a sudden ask for forgiveness without sincerity and expect to be saved.  5.I follow Jesus Christ, and I despise Satan, so I have no idea what you are talking about.|`|5NSfFGqxaa	1.) We usually seem to condemn rather than love. God said to hate the sin, love the sinner. I apologize if I at any point being a Christian judged you.    2.) Like God said, hate the sin, love the sinner.    3.) God never said if I love you, you will be saved, He said you must believe in me in order to be saved. God is a God of love, but He is also a God of wrath and judgment. We must repent sincerely of our sins and continue to have a relationship and live pure and Holy according the Word.    4.) Jesus dies for those who would accept Him, everyone can accept it they want to. He gave us a choice yet He still chose the cross for those who wanted to serve Him. As I said above, we must SINCERELY repent of our sins, not just ask for forgiveness to score a ticket to Heaven. God sees right past our words but into our heart, and what is in there, is all that matters. And you are never guaranteed another moment then the one you are in now. There may not be time to repent.    5.) Some Christians are hypocrites, however others are not. Some atheists are nice, however others may be the meanest people you will ever meet. Look at it in that way and it makes sense that there are still some devout Christians out there.|`|6tHA0QQXaa	1.I would never tell you where you may go because it is none of my Business.You are suppose to have your own beliefs    2.I don't hate anyone    3.You are going through all of this crap in your life for your own growth.Now if you chose to do is is your own choice.Learning is the importance of life.Hell does not consist of fire.Earth is hell.If you chose darkness over light,then have it as you may.    4.We are learning for ourselves Jesus learned from his lifetime that not everyone accepted his God,But he still chose to love him.Why don't you repent now?You wont ever know when you are going to die    5.I call myself a Human being.No one on this earth is perfect and no better than the next person.There are christians who feel that they must live a certain way to gain Access to the kingdom of heaven.I live my life the way that I want to live.I know one thing,That I do have to keep God In my heart,learn from this life and treat all people with respect,no matter what religion or nationality that they are.|`|IqwGkk7daa	1. Not ALL Christians emphasize this. Some do. They seem like doomsayers. Sadly, that's just what we believe. You are just focusing in on the bad parts. But yes, we do believe that if your sins are not payed for when you die, that you won't be allowed into Heaven. It it really all that confusing? I'm sorry people over-talked about that part with you. Our whole religion, in fact, is about love.     2. We don't hate anybody. At least I don't, and the Bible doesn't teach hating. if you run into professing Christians who truly hate a group of people for any reason...you haven't really run into a Christian.    3. Good question. But he doesn't want you to go through all this crap in life. Dude, that's just life. Do you think you deserve a perfect life, with God making everything happen for you? You are only human, and go through problems like the rest of us. Really, I believe bad crap in life is a test. To see how we respond. And as for the burning in Hell for your sins. Again, God does NOT want that! But if He didn't create a punishment for sin, He would be a liar, and an unjust God.     If a mom tells her child no more cookies before dinner or else he will go to his room, yet doesn't send him when he takes another cookie, is she even a woman of truth anymore? There has to be punishment for sin, though God does not like it.     4. Look, God knows your heart. If you are just patronizing God by accepting his gift of Grace and Salvation right before you die, He will know. If you are really truthful, and really sorry for what you've done, He will know that too.     5. I don't know, really. I know only one thing. I am a Christian, and I follow the word of God - the Bible. Others who don't, who call themselves Christian still....I will just try to gently instruct them to get more into the Word. I agree with you on this point. But just keep in mind that you can't take all people who say they are "Christian" and put them into the same group. Sad, but true.    Keep asking! Questions like these, and tons of others have been asked, by smarter people than you, and answered by smarter people than me, and yet the religion still stands.
JZTj5zFKaa	Most people in society think that when someone doesn't conform to trends, that they are being delibearately anti-social when they are just expressing their views. Many of my views don't conform to the standard of today's society, but I have a few good friends and i'm not what most people would define as anti-social.     All of the people that have made positive changes in the world questioned the norm of society during their time.

So, animals' nervous system has evolved methods of driving animals towards doing what aids procreation. Animals have noses that can help determine good food from non-food or rotten food.  Animals have developed methods for determining if a potential mate is a good choice.    One method of increasing the chance that a human will have sex is by making it pleasurable.  Also, couples who have sex tend to form into parental units that do a better job of raising their offspring.    So, the pleasure of sex helps procreation,even if any specific act of sex does not result in an egg being fertilized.    And, humans are healthier when they are in long-term committed relationships.  Sex helps initiate and strengthen relationships.    Also, the desire for sex helps a human be more opening to making an emotional connection with another human - and that can lead to both offspring and long term relationships.    However, societies make up rules about sex, and these may or may not be useful or harmful.  Try to separate arbitrary rules that are useful from arbitrary rules that are illogical or "wrong" in some way - it's up to you to make that decision.|`|dbw210qqaa	Both for married people|`|8nKyRiahaa	Sex is fun.

bfQGXi9zaa	There is no "connection" between atheism and morality, at least in the context in which you have phrased your question. Atheism is simply the lack of belief in any kind of god or deity. That's it. Atheism does not impart any particular brand of morality or ethics.    The reason morality seems to be universal within the multiple cultures and societies on our world is due to the fact that humans share a universal survival instinct.      The primary reason that morality and ethics were established was due to our genetic impulse to socialize; we are social animals.  As such, we developed social orders and from them the various cultures and societies. The only way they can survive is if the humans who want them to survive adopt certain behaviors and standards...we call them morals and ethics.  Therefore, morality and ethical behavior is really an extension of our survival instinct.    The universal nature of the survival instinct in turn makes the morals and ethics of all our cultures and societies universal.  I cannot think of any culture or society that condones or encourages wanton acts of murder, theft, rape, arson, assault, etc.  Even warlike societies such as the ones developed among the Vikings and the Celts adopted certain moral standards in regards to such actions, at least within their own societies.|`|PlBYWZ8Saa	Atheism in and of itself is an amoral standpoint. Specifically meaning that there is nothing in the denial of gods that has a direct effect on morality or ethics.     That assertion is one that has been propagated by the faithful, who believe that if we don't believe in their god, or any god, then we must not believe in anything that the bible says, and that because we are not answerable to a higher power, then we can do whatever we want.       That just isn't true. A lot of atheists place a very high importance on human life. I strongly believe that basic morals principles, such as the right to life, etc are universal. You don't need a religion to tell you that killing people, torturing people, raping people or stealing things is wrong.     I find a lot of things that the church supports immoral. For example, the support of abstinence only sex education when it not only doesn't work, but leaves children unprepared, the preaching of hatred towards homosexuals and the like. I believe that everyone, as long as they act ethically should be able to believe and do what they like, as long as it doesn't affect what other people believe and do.|`|AiFRVoq4aa	God didn't give atheists molars because he wanted to make it harder for them to eat.|`|899c6a371bce238646502edb0cee925aaa	It is strange to consider that people have major differences in the concept of what is moral and amoral.  This discrepancy comes mainly from the various religions that exist and have existed.  Namely, there are people who believe that morality is defined as following God to the 't' and not just fundies - many people believe that dissenting to God is an act of immorality.  Another example is sexual conduct - without the influence of religion, no one in their right mind would claim that sexual activity, if no harm is done, is immoral.  But religions crosses this barrier - religion states that things like disbelieving in God and having sex out of marriage are crimes against morality punishable by death - which of course is completely moral as long as God says so.    The basic human sense of morality is:  don't hurt people against their will or knowledge.  This is twisted - not just by religion, but by politics, social connections and philosophies - into ideals which contradict this basic drive but go by the same name.

I would like Mary to pray for me but she already is praying like everyone else in heaven that keeps saying when lord when?.    Oh and I do like Godzilla.|`|wT9PTRgtaa	I would ask a living person to help rather than a dead person.According to bible jesus is the only one who is resurrected and lives forever.He sits at right hand of god and intercede for all true believers.Mary and other saints are dead.They wont be ressurected until judgment day.Bible speaks enoch,and elijah didnt die and were taken up directly to heaven.It also says jesus conversed with elijah and moses on a mount.This doesnt give elijah,moses etc.Power to intercede for mankind to god-the father is reserved for son and holyspirit.That is why those christians who intercede for others,do it not by themselves,but by the power of spirit of god.When constantine in 4th century AD made christianity the state religion of Rome,the next 200 years saw influx of people from all parts of empire into church.Many of them ignorant about scriptures and seeking only worldly riches by the state were unwiling to discard their pagan practices.So instead of praying to many pagan gods,they elevated important persons in church to the status of god and called them saints.Catholics and orthodox churches still retain this unbiblical practice.When asked about it they will evade from truth and say some foolish arguments like praying to dead saints is same as asking a living person for help.Give me proof that apostles and first churches prayed to saints.You won't as such proof doesnt exist.Bible proclaims jesus is the only intercessor between man and god.When we ask fellow believers to pray for us,its actualy holyspirit in these believers who intercede for us.Catholics might ask if praying to saints was unbiblical then why did god allow it,to this day?Answer is why did god allow muslims who reject crucifixion and resurrection of jesus to continue and propagate till this very day?Why hindu religion with millions of gods exist even today?End of these false religions will soon occur.These religions will cease to exist in the coming world war.After the war true church of christ (protestant in essence) will cover all earth and all people living on earth will be its members till the day christ comes back to take true believers(trumpet day).|`|l3f8kf7xaa	I would choose Mary. Who would be closer to Jesus than his Mother in heaven? I mean really.
TSkI7Nktaa	At the heart of the matter is sin. If you go back to the book of Genesis in the bible, it tells us that man only ate meat after he disobeyed God and ate the forbidden fruit.  Animals began to hunt and eat each other after the great flood. This was never Gods original plan. Because God loved us he has to give us Choice.  Adam and Eve choose to disobey God and there was consequence. You see, sin has ramifications in the spiritual realm and physical realm, theologically speaking. Spiritually, every human being is born in depravity(thats why we must learn to do whats right; the wrong comes quite naturally) becasue of Adams sin. Phyically we are prone to hardships, sickness and death all becasue of sin.     Now God does intervene in the world affairs. He sent Jesus to save us from the power, practice and penalty of sin.  There are many things im sure God prevents from happening that we may not be aware of. but the day is coming when Jesus will return to this earth and set up his government only then will all suffering end!|`|BNHocZaiaa	How about the spider, that paralyzes it's victim and sucks it dry.

Is this not how the Lord rightly compares you, just like the churlish children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.     Wisdom truly is justified of her children!      That none can live except by the death of another is supremely exemplified in the death of Christ.    That sin will result in eternal suffering is amply exemplified here by its effects before your very eyes.      There is none so blind as the proud who do not want to see. And though you see you deny what you see.      Though He be close to the humble yet truly He is far from the proud.

However, how do you expect the world to work?  Don't you think that if something mysteriously fed all the animals every day, and they were all friends that it'd all be very artificial.  Like that, living on this planet would be living in a zoo and quite meaningless.  If you consider conservation of energy, the food that the life on this planet consumes has to come from somewhere, the biggest obtainable source being from other life forms.  Even a vegan is a killer, plants have to die for them to live and they're just as valid in their roles as lifeforms as animals.  Besides, if there were no hardships in nature then evolution would stagnate, life has to adapt to survive and that makes it stronger.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	If you knew God, you wouldn't go against Him.

For the first 6,000 years, God is allowing humanity to experiment with various forms of religion, education, government and culture. Through spiritual emptiness and physical and emotional agony, humanity is now writing the lesson in human suffering that mans ways always turn out to be wrong. Having learned this lesson, humanity will be far more ready to listen genuinely when God does open their minds and hearts to His Truth. In giving us freedom to choose, God has given us room to accept or reject His guidance, to choose rebellion or submission, to make foolish decisions or wise ones. In doing so He has given each of us an undetermined future.    Adam chose, by sinning, to turn away from God. The rest of mankind has taken the same path. "Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, ... death spread to all men, because all sinned" (Romans 5:12).    Sometimes the best we can do is to accept it as explainable only by what the Bible calls "time and chance" (Ecclesiastes 9:11). Although God does not cause accidents, neither does He micromanage the lives of every human being to prevent them. Paul tells us that in this life we see through "a glass darkly" (1 Corinthians 13:12, KJV). We will never fully understand some things during this life, but we will in the world to come. One of the consequences of humanity's decision to live contrary to God's instruction is a world subject to the capriciousness and vagaries of "time and chance" and the actions of others. This pattern will prevail until Christ returns to establish God's Kingdom on earth.

Therefore, we were given a soul to separate us from one another to make us an individual.   The animals in this world also have a soul. The only difference between their souls and ours is that our soul belongs to the spirit. Their souls belongs to the body. When their body perishes, their souls perishes with it. When our body perishes, the soul remains with the spirit.
fxHEZGcCaa	Greetings,    Those who have died in the past will have a resurrection.    Many think that all good people went to heaven when they died and all bad people when to a fiery hell of torment. Both these ideas are incorrect according to what the Bible teaches.    First of all the bible does not teach that hell is a place of torment. The Bible teaches that the definition of death is a return to the dust and an unconscious state (Gen.3:19; Eccl.3:20; 9:5,10; Ps.6:5; 115:17; 146:4; Isa.38:18,19; 63:16; Job 14:21; Ezek.18:4; etc.). Eccl. 9:5,10 explicitly states that those in hell (Hebrew SHEOL) are unconscious and that everyone who dies goes there.    So the bible clearly shows that everyone, good and bad, go to the same place; "Hell" (HADES/SHEOL) (Job 14:13; Gen.37:35; Ps.16:10; Acts 2:27, 31). This fact is hidden in many translations like the KJV which translate SHEOL 31 times as "grave" and 31 times as "hell" due to theological bias.    Second, the Bible explicitly states that nobody went to heaven before Christ (Jn. 3:13). Jesus was first be to ascend to heaven. The way to heavenly life was first opened up to imperfect humans only after the death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ (1Cor. 15:20; Acts 26:23; Jn. 14:2, 3; Heb. 9:24; 10:19, 20).    All those who have died, good and bad, are "asleep" waiting for the resurrection (2Pet.3:4; Jn.11:11-14; 1Cor.15:18; 1Thes.4:13-17).  But those unconscious in death are not forgotten. The Word of God explicitly says that those in HADES (hell) will come out in the resurrection and that Hell is not eternal (Rev.20:13,14; 21:4; Ac.24:15). God will empty the memorial tombs by bringing the dead back to life (Jn 5:28).    Scriptures plainly state that the resurrection of chosen humans to eternal life with Christ would only occur after Christ's return. God did not promise anyone that they would be rewarded at death. Instead, when humans died they would be asleep in death (1Ki.2:10; Dan.12:2,13; Jn.11:11; 1Cor.15:6,18) and only receive their reward at the time of Christ's second presence (coming: KJV) in "the last days" (Mat.16:27; 24:3; Lk.14:14; Jn.11:24; 14:3; 1Cor.15:22,23,51,52; 2Tim.4:8)    We do not even have to worry about any who have died in the past because Acts 24:15 states that There is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous. The unrighteous individuals that will be resurrected include the billions who died without having an opportunity to learn about God (Acts 17:30,31).    In past centuries many people died who did not know how to read and who had never seen a Bible. But they will be raised from Sheol, or Hades. Then, in the paradise earth, they will be taught Gods will, and they will have the opportunity to prove that they really do love God by doing his will. For their resurrection to be everlasting they must accept Christs ransom sacrifice (1 Tim. 2:3-6) and prove to be obedient through the final test (Rev. 20:7-10).    All those living will then experience what the psalmist said of Jehovah: You are opening your hand and satisfying the desire of every living thing (Ps. 145:16). There will be no war, violence, or crime (Psalm 46:8, 9; Proverbs 2:22).    [God] will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away. (Revelation 21:4)       Hope that helps,    Ron Rhoades|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	Only God the Father truly knows, but I think God would allow those who follow Him to go to Heaven, just a thought, I'm not sure myself.|`|AXOVKAwbaa	I was taught they were in like a "holding place" because the gates of heaven weren't open yet...I guess I should do some research on that.|`|tpmAAkdBaa	According to Christianity it only applies after Jesus came. The rest were saved after Jesus came (aka in heaven with God).|`|VRl1jENHaa	Paul addresses this matter rather beautifully at Acts Chapter 17:    22 Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious; 23 for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription:     TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.    Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you: 24 God, who made the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands. 25 Nor is He worshiped with mens hands, as though He needed anything, since He gives to all life, breath, and all things. 26 And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, 27 so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us; 28 for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, For we are also His offspring. 29 Therefore, since we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, something shaped by art and mans devising. 30 Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent, 31 because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.  32 And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, while others said, We will hear you again on this matter.     So we see by closely reading Paul's words that:    1) people to whom God hasn't been revealed fully still are capable of worshipping Him -- they just don't know Whom it is that they worship (John 4:22);  2) God wants ALL human beings to seek Him, no matter where and when they live;  3) God is not far from ANY of us, heathen or believer;  4) idolatry is ignorance of God's true nature;  5) God recognizes that, since He hasn't revealed Himself to heathens, that this "ignorance" must be "overlooked" in all fairness;  6) HOWEVER, God has now chosen to reveal Himself to ALL of humanity -- not just to the Jewish people -- through His Son, Jesus;  7) once the Son is preached to a person, s/he is no longer ignorant and therefore MUST make a decision;  8) the Son will judge humanity based upon the decision each of us make.    So to answer your question: if a person is righteous, but has never heard the Gospel, that person is with God. But if a person hears the Gospel and rejects it, then they die in rebellion against God and have condemned themselves to Hell.|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	Jesus brought the Gospel to them and offered them salvation.  If they wanted it by wishing to love as God loves, then they might see heaven.    The infinitely merciful God comes to all at the time of death to offer them salvation.  While many are ignorant of the God of Abraham (pagans etc), all have a conscience.  By following that conscience, they might be predisposed to accept him and love him.      This predisposition does not cause salvation, but they might accept him.    Keep in mind all good comes from God, so if a Hindu missionary were to tell a Buddhist he was drinking too much every night, that piece of advice is good and true and comes from Jesus.|`|bXeHr69Vaa	jesus set them free at the resurrection to be judged, read where the man asked lazarus for a drop of water and you will understand|`|gkmaYqdZaa	They are judged on their faith(if they have any) and how they used the knowledge they had.

Reason He did this to set captives free. The moment He descended, the people that died years before Christ were popping out from the graves, the same afternoon He was crucified.(Matthew 27:52)      Gates of hell are meant to keep people in, not out.     Matthew 16:18  And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  Matthew 16:17-19 (in Context) Matthew 16 (Whole Chapter)     Prior to the atonement by the blood of Christ, there was no entry into Heaven; Jesus was the first of many to come after Him. He was the one that opened the gates of hell to release the captives.   Who would those "captives" be?   Those that lived their lifes according to the God laws under the Old Testament.  God made sure those who believe would be able to express it by their lifestyle. Abraham pleased God 400 years before Moses came down the mountain with instructions (Laws) how to do it.    Jesus was the first to come down from Heaven,and first to ascend, and He is now seated on the right hand of the Father.

eO2rnf7yaa	It is the height of presumptuousness to claim to know the exact Will of God in such matters as you have described.     Honest Christians must accept that we do not know God's Will in such matters, except to know that Jesus clearly taught us to help people in need.

The LORD takes vengeance on his foes          and maintains his wrath against his enemies.         3 The LORD is slow to anger and great in power;          the LORD will not leave the guilty unpunished.          His way is in the whirlwind and the storm,          and clouds are the dust of his feet.         4 He rebukes the sea and dries it up;          he makes all the rivers run dry.          Bashan and Carmel wither          and the blossoms of Lebanon fade.         5 The mountains quake before him          and the hills melt away.          The earth trembles at his presence,          the world and all who live in it.         6 Who can withstand his indignation?          Who can endure his fierce anger?

Look at San Fransico. Sitting on a major fault. Not exactly a Christian friendly city. Look at New Orleans with the mardi gras celebration that is offensive for Christians to watch, and the hurricane happened there. It's not for me to judge, but I am noticing patterns here and there.  But Biblically God will sent prophets, or there will be a prophecy in the Bible that warns. However there are general warnings that if you offend God, you should expect some form of judgement both here, and especially in the afterlife.

What goes on in someone's private life is none of my business. Whether they do it up the butt, in the ear, whatever- if it's all consenting adults then nobody else has the right to interfere. If nobody is being taken advantage of or hurt then people can do what they like.    Personally I'm not particularly adventurous. I've only ever had sex with one person (I'm 21) and the most extreme thing I've tried is tying him up. But that doesn't mean I'm shocked at what other people do, it just means I'm not into the same stuff. I just wanted to wait until I was definitely ready before I had sex, that was my only condition.    And as for people being promiscuous, if they use protection and don't go home with strangers without telling someone where they are, it's up to them what they do.|`|knzJtfIQaa	for me i'm conservative, no sex b4 marriage. the risk of heartbreak and all these STDs is too much|`|wqFIC8c2aa	I would,but this whole "AIDS" thing that's going on in the world is putting a big damper on the sex movement.|`|Wmxpi9Amaa	Sex before marriage is fine and no one's business but yours, but you need to be friggin responsible about it.

Sending you all my best wishes...your friend...Annette***|`|ATPPWOpWaa	It is a mystery and a scriptural truth that we are drawn  to God as His children not simply by happen stance or impeded by the rudimentary laws of the world and understanding.  It is by the power of the Holy Spirit that we find our way and hear His voice.  By mans wisdom and device they limit themselves to a mindset of probability and fairness according to their earthly wisdom and  peculiar circumstance finding fault and never coming to the understanding of the truth.    John 6   43"Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered. "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.'  Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me.       John 10   27My  sheep listen to my voice; I (Jesus) know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand. I and the Father are one."       Romans 9  15 For he (God) says to Moses,  I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,  and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.  16 It does not, therefore, depend on mans desire or effort, but on Gods mercy.    Ephesians 1  4 For he (God) chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love    Also,    John 10  26 but you do not believe because you are not my(Jesus) sheep.    John 8:44  You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.    Romans 9  19One of you will say to me: "Then why does God still blame us?  For who resists his will?"  But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? "  Shall what is formed say to him who formed it,  'Why did you make me like this?' "Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?  What if God, choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrathprepared for destruction?  What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?|`|n1eXQr5oaa	not dependant... but science definately helps|`|RJECt4zFaa	I would like to say its dependent on the person.|`|urQQ6kbcaa	Not mine|`|1Y1PBMXlaa	Sort of.    What we believe depends on our knowledge and how we use it.  Science gives us a good amount of that knowledge.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	No. There are creation science ministries out there, but proving that God created the world is kind of like trying to prove that peanut butter is made of peanuts.  It's pretty obvious.  Science fails in one area: Being philosophically neutral. It always assumes that there is no supernatural, although science shows that there is more than what meets the eye. So philosophy is influencing science.  To get faith, you make a simple observation, which is you can see life all around you, then you read the Bible and understand that a loving God created the world. Faith comes by reading the word in the Bible, not by scientific research. The Bible says "Lean not on your own understanding". God knows that man can only know so much so he needs to "throw us a bone" so we can finally understand what is going on.|`|G9VBTg47aa	http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=Al...

Edit:---I might add that when I was young living in Northern Wyoming we had many Mexican farm laborers every summer and fall to work on the farms. They were almost all Catholic and since there was no Catholic Chuch in town, they came every sunday as a group and attended the Mormon Service. They were always warmly welcomed!    Addition:-- The Church has had Missionaries to the Latin American countries like forever, My Grandfather who spoke spanish fluently served three missions to the Latinos in the southwestern US and in Mexico in the late 1800's. Yes, 1800's, I am 73! Our Missionaries are still there in force.    ADDITION:---Sunday----I just returned from Church where the main speaker was from American Samoa, An African American lady who was Baptized yesterday was confirmed a Member of the Church today, There wer several other African American and Latino members in attendance!

I did live in a ward for about a year that was almost evenly mixed with English and Spanish speaking Latter Day Saints--when I mean Spanish speaking, I am meaning that they did not speak English at all, most being recent immigrants from south and central America. We had the technology to provide translation, but that didn't improve the comfort level. In auxillary meetings, Relief Society (women's meeting) a Spanish-speaking sister had to translate for other sisters in a low tone of voice the whole time and it was very distracting.    I worked in the nursery and had Spanish-speaking toddlers in my class. Trying to reason with toddlers is hard enough, but a toddler that doesn't speak the same language is a challenge. I am sure it was even harder in primary.    At some point, right before I left, they divided the ward. It made it convenient for everyone--no translation issues--but I wonder if the Spanish-speaking saints must have felt somewhat shunned because of that? I sure hope not.|`|GPn55rjTaa	Well great seeing that I have Latinos next door to me, they are LDS, and she is my best friend.  The LDS church spreads the fastest in 2 cultures.  Guess which ones?

Im not Hispanic, but I do live in a predominantly Hispanic area in Los Angeles. I have never gotten the feeling that Caucasian LDS members look down on those with backgrounds from Central and South America. In fact, it may be the opposite. LDS members believe that the peoples from the Americas are the decedents of the peoples in the Book of Mormon. Many in the Church have served missions to Spanish-speaking countries and come to love those whom they serve. My brother spent two years on a mission in Panama, my husband in the Dominican Republic and they feel this way. Mexico and Brazil have the largest LDS populations outside of the U.S. (LDS membership in the US is about 6 million; one million each in Mexico and Brazil.) In fact, its probably a conservative estimate that at least 25% of LDS members are Hispanic or are of Hispanic ancestry. Given these numbers, I find it hard to believe that the leadership of the church is actively shunning a quarter of their fold. Im sure there are some members who are racist and look down on those of Hispanic ancestry  in any given group of 13 million people youre bound to find some wackos. But these racists are wrong and will be put in their place one way or another.       As far as the look and sound of Mormons goes, you can ask the leader (Bishop) of my congregation; hes Mexican. Or my husband, who is Navajo. Or my brother-in-law, whos Japanese. Or the leader of our girls youth program, who is Iranian. All represent the look and sound of the LDS church.      And not to be snarky, but, jimi..youre telling me that there is poverty among minorities in a major US city? Ive never heard of that before:)

(This can translate into older kids calling younger kids "babies" as an insult.)  So, being anti-"what I was before" is normal.  However, learning to accept that you were doing the best you could under the circumstances will make your life easier.  It will ease your anger.    2) Parents force a set of beliefs (not facts, but "beliefs") onto their children.  When the children realize that these beliefs are not truths, not facts, but just what the parents wanted the kids to believe, it does make the victim angry.  It is a healthy response.    3) Your parents seem to have portrayed themselves as representatives of god, that what they wanted you to do was the same as what god wanted you to do.  That is very, very damaging to a child.  Anger at realizing how much they hurt you is healthy.

Since God created everything, you, me, the trees, the stars, the moon, animals, plants, everything you see or touch, or hear every day, and Satan created nothing more than evil masking itself as good, while God created everything that truly is good, how could Satan seem more real? I grew up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I have been mormon all my life. I have not always made the right decisions, but I have never once doubted the existence of God, His son Jesus Christ, and The Holy Spirit, as three separate, loving, distinct leaders, and beings, and more importantly, as my loving Father, and brothers. The only true answer to your question is that you are so 'anti religious' now because you allowed yourself to lose faith. You are what you, and only you made yourself. I promise you that if you decide to go back to church, you will be welcomed back with open arms, and if you don't, no one who really cares will love you any less. I have never met you, but I love you as a sibling in the Church, and I promise that no matter what happens, I always will, as will Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, The Holy Ghost, and your earthly family, and your ward leadership. The list goes on, and on. You are not abandoned. You are not forgotten. You are still His child, and He will never forget that, and I pray that you never will.

Everybody screws up and we're all in the same boat, and the idea is that we don't deserve his grace. BUT that is where GOD loved us enough, since he did created us, to give us an alternative. God knows we're always going to screw up and he doesn't need us to be perfect because he loved us enough to give us another option where we are forgiven. which is of course Jesus. The devil is realistic because he focuses on the fact that we will always screw up and never be perfect. God knows all that too, but he has the grace to forgive us and give us purpose and a chance to be with him like we were created to do, even though we'll never be perfect.
0lnamekJaa	A Short History of the Bible  http://www.nobeliefs.com/DarkBible/darkb...    Interestingly, there existed many competing Christian cults in the early years after Jesus' alleged death. Some sects saw the universe in dualisms of goodness and sin, of light and darkness, God and the Devil. Other Christian sects performed odd rituals, some of which involved the swallowing of semen, thought of as a sacred substance. Many other Christians also wrote mystical stories and by the second century there existed more than a dozen Gospels, along with a whole library of other texts. These include letters of Jesus to foreign kings, letters of Paul to Aristotle, and histories of the disciples. In one of these secret Gospels, it describes Jesus taking naked young men off to secret initiation rites in the Garden of Gethsemene. There lived Christian Gnostics (knowers) who believed that the church itself derived from the Devil to keep man from God and from realizing his true nature. In those first centuries of Christianity orthodoxy did not exist and when an organized orthodox church finally came, it got defined, almost inadvertently, in argument against many of the Gnostic sects.    So the idea of the Bible as a single, sacred unalterable corpus of texts began in heresy and later extended and used by churchmen in their efforts to define orthodoxy. One of the Bible's most influential editors, Irenaeus of Lyon, decided that there should only exist four Gospels like the four zones of the world, the four winds, the four divisions of man's estate, and the four forms of the first living creatures - the lion of Mark, the calf of Luke, the man of Matthew, and the eagle of John. In a single stroke, Irenaeus had delineated the sacred book of the Christian church and left out the other Gospels. Irenaeus also wrote what Christianity did not include, and in this way Christianity became an orthodox faith. A work of Irenaeus, Against the Heresies, became the starting point for later inquisitions.    There has existed over a hundred different versions of the Bible, written in most of the languages of the time including Greek, Hebrew and Latin. Some versions left out certain biblical stories and others contained added stories. The completed versions of the old and new testament probably got finished at around 200-300 C.E. although many disputed the authenticity of some books which later ended up as Apocrypha (uncanonical or of questionable authorship). For example, the book of Ecclesiasticus appears in the Catholic Bible but not in Protestant versions.    At around 405 C.E. Jerome (Eusebius Hieronymous) finished translating all the Old and New testament books into Latin (Vulgate Bible) which provided the Roman Catholic church added power. The Vulgate Bible went through several revisions up until the early 1900s!    The salvation doctrines of Christianity survived and flourished because they afforded the priesthood considerable power. The priests alone held the keys to salvation and could threaten the unbelievers with eternal punishment. Hence, in the evolution of Christianity in the last two thousand years with priests preying on human fears, the religion has demonstrated extraordinary powers of survival. Even without the priests, the various versions of the Bible have had more influence on the history of the world, in the minds of men than any other literature.    Unfortunately, the beliefs in Scripture produced the most violent actions against man in the history of humanity up to that time. The burning of competing Christian cults (called heretics) by early Christian churches acted as the seeds of violent atrocities against man. There later followed the destruction of Rome by the Christian Goths, and the secret pagan sacrifices consented by the Pope, the Vandals that had the Bible with them as they destroyed imperial North Africa, the crusades in the eleventh century fighting in the lands around the eastern Mediterranean, Palestine and Syria, capturing Jerusalem and setting kingdoms from Anatolia to the Egyptian border. In 1204 the Fourth Crusade plundered Constantinople the most holy city at that time, with Christians fighting Christians. And the slaughters continued (and continues to this day). According to Romer, "More heretics and scholars were burned in the Middle Ages than were ever killed in Carolingian times. For at this time the Inquisition came into its own, and torture, largely unused as an instrument of government since Roman days, was reintroduced."    In the 1380s, John Wycliffe translated the first English Bible which inspired an English religious revolution which caused persecutions against him by the Catholic Church.    In the early 1500's the German heretic, Martin Luther, almost single handedly caused the final split from the Roman Catholic church and created the beginnings of the Protestant revolution. This split still influences violence to this day. He translated the Bible into German which further spread Protestantism. Luther also helped spread anti-Semitism with his preaching and books such as his "The Jews and their lies," all supported through his interpretation of the Bible. One should not forget that Hitler (a Christian and great admirer of Luther) and his holocaust could not have occurred without his influence and the support of Bible believing German Christians.    In the 1530s William Tyndale completed his version of the English Protestant Bible (probably with the aid of Luther) and the first to print the English Bible. He too felt the persecution of the Church and he spent his last days in imprisonment and exile. His enemies finally caught him and burned him at the stake, but because of his celebrity, they strangled him first (what nice guys!).    After Luther's German Bible, others followed suit by translating the Bible into their|`|AA10057370	check out the Dead Sea Scrolls:  What the Dead Sea Scroll manuscripts clearly demonstrate is that through about a thousand years there was essentially no significant alteration in the text.

I don't think God has any use for it personally.  The Bible makes it clear that God spoke creation into being.|`|XN0cYCATaa	No what you are Talking about is Called Theistic Evolution     A variation on the theme of evolution is theistic evolution. It states that God initiated life on earth and allowed evolutionary principles to bring man to where he is--maybe with a little help from God here and there. At least this theory includes God. But this theory was developed in part by Bible believing people who thought that evolution had some merit. In addition, it is an attempt to answer the many problems existing not only in the fossil record but also with how life could somehow randomly form out of nothing. Because of problems like this, some believe they can be explained by simply adding God to the picture: God directed evolution.         For those who hold to the Bible as the word of God, theistic evolution should not be a viable option. The Bible says, "Know that the LORD is God. It is he who made us..." (Psalm 100:3). The Scriptures state that God created. God said, "Let there be..." and there was. The Scriptures speak of the creative word of God. When God speaks; it occurs. He said "Let there be" and it was so. It does not say, "Let there be a slow development through an evolutionary process."         God said in Genesis 1:26, "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground." The Hebrew word for "make" in this verse and in verse 25 where God makes the beasts, is "asah." It means to do, work, make, produce. This is not simply the limited Hebrew understanding of evolutionary principles.         The land animals were made differently than man. The animals were made from the ground but man was made directly by God: "the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being" (Gen. 2:7). Evolution states that man evolved from life forms that developed in the ocean. Here, God made man from the dust of the ground--not the water of the ocean.         If evolution is true and the Bible is true then how is the formation of Eve explained? She was created out of one of Adam's ribs (Gen. 2:22). There is no way to explain this if theistic evolution is true; that is, unless you want to say that Eve wasn't made from Adam's side. Then, if you do that, you are doubting the very word of God.         Also, Jesus said in Mark 10:6 "But at the beginning of creation God made them male and female.'" The beginning was not evolutionary slime; in the beginning of creation there was Adam and Eve.         Though this information is brief and far from complete, it should be obvious that theistic evolution and the Scriptures cannot be harmonized.

I'm not sure if it was a lie or not lol.|`|rMB71kZ8aa	No i would not.  You cannot judge a book by its cover.

If we were all perfect it would be a pretty boring life. Be grateful for what you have as there are many that do not have the advantages we have and a nose job would have to be the most unimportant of them all.

Jesus told us to love one another.  If you aim for that, you'll automatically be on the right track.    It sounds like you could use a spiritual advisor.

When I feel his presence I feel loved.  We protects me and watches over me.  I am blessed.  He died on the cross because He loves US.  I was told once that when we start getting close to God, Satan will try even harder to discourage us and trip us up and make us doubt.  Because he is loosing us to the Lord and he hates it.  There is a scripture that tells us to "Be still and know that I am God".  Just keep your faith and hang in there no matter what and things will improve when satan realizes he is wasting his time on you.  We also have to remember when we pray that God sees the whole big picture.  He knows what is best and sometimes the answer is no.  Sometimes we have to wait until he gets us to a certain point in life.  We have to trust Him.  Only trust Him.  :)|`|0mtuM3saaa	God (i.e. I) love you if you are a sexy and "open" girl!

Though I like Darwin's answer; I have to say yes and no. Like the commandment says: "There are no gods other than me..." (a) If there are no gods, other than he, yes he would be an Atheist. (b)  If there are no gods, other than he,no, he wouldn't be an Atheist; unless he believed in himself. Either or, why would there be so many other religions that claim to be right, if there was only on god?

Yes, there is no God apart from HIm; He doesn't know any other.<br>  <br>  This is merely an answer to your main question.<br>  <br>  In the OT, that has reference to idols; in the the NT, that has reference to being the Source of all that is (I Corinthians 8:5-6).|`|Z92LPUqaaa	Deny is not really the appropriate word.

Because He knows He exists, He does not have faith in God.  Therefore, God is an atheist, and because He does not have faith in God, God does not exist.|`|XqpRYh52aa	I couldn't be bothered to read all that but to answer your original question,according to the bible,no the Christian god is not atheist.<br>  The first commandment says "Thou shall have no gods before me" not,there are no gods but me.<br>  <br>  btw.The definition you have given of atheist is incorrect.An atheist lacks belief in gods.

I don't believe that being Gay is genetic. A former homosexual Christian explained to me that it's partly a pre-disposition that is genetic, but not a gay gene, and mostly environmental. Also the book of Romans explains that homosexuality is a form of judgement from God for those that do not believe in God.  Rom 1:18  For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;   Rom 1:19  Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.  Rom 1:20  For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:  Rom 1:21  Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.  Rom 1:22  Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,   Rom 1:23  And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.   Rom 1:24  Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:   Rom 1:25  Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.   Rom 1:26  For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:   Rom 1:27  And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	maybe we are all supposed to be gay. did you ever consider that?|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	yup.. the gay cant infect the lord and stop saying silly stuff|`|9btru19waa	Homosexuality is a choice, not a birth defect. To keep from this sin, one must turn away from it. God gives us a way to not sin, when confronted with temptation. If we flee from the sin, we are not going to act upon it.

While the word itself is not found in the Bible, we can find some principles to help guide us.    Sometimes, procrastination is the result of laziness, and the Bible has plenty to say about that. The Bible commends hard work and industry (Proverbs 12:24; 13:4) and warns against sloth and slackness (Proverbs 15:19; 18:9). One cure for procrastination is more diligence, regardless of the task. The Christian should be supremely motivated to be diligent in his work, since he is ultimately serving the Lord. Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men (Colossians 3:23). If we put our hearts into our work, as this verse says to do, we will probably find it difficult to procrastinate too much.    The Bible says that when it comes to some things, we should never delay. Jesus taught that reconciling with an offended brother should be done immediately upon our remembrance of the situation (Matthew 5:23-24). He also said to settle matters quickly with our adversaries (verse 25). However distasteful it may be to pursue peace with an enemy, we must avoid stalling. Similarly, we are instructed, Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry (Ephesians 4:26). Dealing appropriately with our anger is a matter of great importance, and we must not put it off until tomorrow, which will give the devil a foothold (verse 27).    Christians must not procrastinate when it comes to sharing the Gospel with the lost. There is no time to be wasted. Jesus likened evangelistic efforts to a man inviting people to a great banquet. As he sent out his servants with the invitations, he said, Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame (Luke 14:21). The most striking qualities of the invitation are its openness (anyone and everyone was invited) and its urgency (the call to the feast must go out quickly).    Some people, upon hearing the Gospel and knowing their spiritual need, delay in making a response. This is the most dangerous type of procrastination. Life is short, and we do not know what will happen tomorrow (James 4:13-14). The Bible urges us to get right with God today. See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness. As has just been said: Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion (Heb 3:12-13, 15). To procrastinate and put off getting right with God is to harden ones own heart.    Jesus could return at any time; we do not know when (Luke 12:40). Our Lord illustrated the importance of being prepared for His coming in Matthew 25:1-13. In this parable, ten virgins await the arrival of the bridegroom and the commencement of the wedding feast. Five of the virgins were prepared for his arrival; five did not attempt to prepare until it was too late, and they were left behind. Jesus calls the unprepared virgins foolish; one reason they were unprepared may have been that they procrastinated.    So in the matter of our spiritual life, we dare not procrastinate. It is also unwise to delay healing a broken relationship or dealing with anger. And since our service to God motivates all we do, we have no reason to procrastinate. In short, procrastination is a bad habit that can have eternal effects.

If you are being persecuted for the name of Jesus Christ then you may well be a Christian.

Mat 5:12  Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.   Joh 15:20  Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord.

We know, because we have found surviving copies of them, that all of the Old Testament was completed in the form we know today at least 400 years before any of the New Testament was written.  And yet God still continue to perform miracles, heal, "smite", etc. during that period and into the time of the New Testament.

51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	If they really understood, they wouldn't be holding their breath!    Matthew 24:37-39 As in the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man be, for as in the days before the flood there were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, even until that day when Noah entered the ark.  They didnt know until the flood came and took them away, so also shall be the coming of the Son of Man.     Matthew 24:40-41  Then (after that) two will be in the field and one will be taken and one will be left. Two women will be grinding at the mill and one will be taken and one will be left.    But wait a moment, Christ does not say that those taken will go up to heaven to be with Christ, and in fact He says just the opposite.      1 Thessalonians 2:16  Then (after that) we who are alive, who are left, will be taken up together with them (the dead) in the clouds to meet Christ in the air, and so will be always with Him.    Now I dont know about you but I do not want to be raptured.  Let us look at what the Bible says.  It says that a rapture will take place at the moment of Christs appearing in the sky but it does not say where they go.  It does say that those who do not get raptured will be taken up together into the air with Christ.      Matthew 24:21 For there will be great tribulations, which have not been from the beginning of the world until now, nor will be after.  22 And unless those days were shortened no flesh would be saved but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. 23 Then (after that) if any man say to you: Lo there is Christ, or there, do not believe him.  For there shall arise false Christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders insomuch as to deceive, if possible, even the elect.    Now read that again.  It says the greatest tribulations in the history of the world will come on all mankind, but it will not be the end of the world (for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened).  The elect will be here during the tribulations, and not raptured.  Then, even after that, if people say that Christ is here or coming, do not believe it, even if he (or they) perform miracles.      They want an easy way out. So they believe Satan's greatest lie.|`|n1eXQr5oaa	it aint there!    not that revelations is true anyway|`|9a35060b1f035af576ef9d57f250b28aaa	Rapture is a vocabulary word, there is no word "rapture" in the Bible.

Here it is:  ""With a shout of command, with the archangel's call, and with the sound of God's trumpet, the Lord himself will come down from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever."     We also see that in Revelation 2-3, the church age is present on the earth. In chapter 4, the church is no longer mentioned. It says "After these things I saw a door standing open in heaven. The first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after this." (Revelation 4:1)    It says, "After these things..." What things? The things of the church. It is never mentioned again in Revelation. Saints are mentioned, but these are Tribulation saints, who have "washed their robes...in the blood of the Lamb." (Revelation 7:14)    The Tribulation is not for the church. Jesus promised that His church would not endure this. (Revelation 3:10)    Other passages that give us a picture of the rapture are found in I Corinthians 15:51-57, II Corinthians 12:2-4, and John 14:1-3 for starters.    When Jesus comes at His "second coming," He returns to the earth, setting foot on the Mount of Olives, where an earthquake will occur. "And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south." (Zechariah 14:4)    He will then begin to rule and reign over the earth, along with the saints that followed Him from heaven. "Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied about these people when he said, "Look! The Lord has come with countless thousands of his holy ones. He will execute judgment on all people and convict everyone of all the ungodly things that they have done in such an ungodly way, including all the harsh things that these ungodly sinners have said about him." (Jude 1:14-15)    Now, allow me to discuss the etymology of the word "rapture." I will quote I Thessalonians 4:17 from the Latin Vulgate so that you can see where rapture comes from (rapiemur in the Latin):    "deinde nos qui vivimus qui relinquimur simul "rapiemur" c u m illis in nubibus obviam Domino in aera et sic semper c u m Domino erimus"    And the equivalent word "harpazo" in the Greek:    "? ??? ? ?? ? ? ? ? ??? "??" ? ?? ?? ?? ? ? ?? ??? ? ?? ? ? ?? ??."    So, the word (and the concept of a) rapture is Scriptural. Rapture first, Second Coming later.    EDIT:  Gee, that's what I get for not paying attention.  As Bobby Jim said, it's 1 Thessalonians, not 2nd.  Oy.    And the word "rapture" is the English (not fully) transliterated word which comes from the Latin text I quoted for you in the previous answer.  It is from tha Latin "rapiemur," which is translated from the Greek "harpazo."  Both mean "caught up," or "[violently] snatching away."   It is there, but as "caught up," not "rapture."|`|bVfVWFyMaa	they like to use the passage of the two women in the fields and on of them dissapears, of course this passage seems like OMG they got raptured!!! but the truth of the matter is that it was obviously a parable not meant to talk about the end of the world.

It is a term coined after the Bible was written.  Revelation 7:9 through 7:17 implies rapture but does not use the word.   Matthew speaks of there being two in a field and one is taken and one is not, (Matthew 24:40 and 24:41).  The thought of rapture is there, but the word is not used.  Revelations 14:1 - 14:5 speak of a multitude standing on Mount Zion with the Lamb and says that they were purchased from the earth (these are the "first fruits") - this also implies these were raptured.  Incidently, 144 thousand should not be thought of as an exact number but as a "picture" representing a multitude (everything in Revelation is an "image" not a literal thing, so why would we take this number literally.  The number 144 is made up of 12 * 12.  In the bible, the number 12 represents consumation or total completion.|`|0fd6c9cd983b835b83ca7be549d67540aa	which is easier to say "caught up" or rapture? same meaning.  anyone can say it how they please. i don't think God is worried bout how we get His word out as long as it is the truth. the word "grandfather" is not in the bible but we know that we have one.|`|VsCrYYMeaa	The fundie doctrine on rapture (dispensationalist premillenialist) is false and not Biblical.

It has nothing at all to do with the bible other then he was a christian nut-job.    http://www.nobeliefs.com/DarkBible/darkb...  ? ? ? The Survivors ? ? ?  "Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel." (Revelation 7:3-4)    "And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads." (Revelation 9:3-4)    "And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty [and] four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads." (Revelation 14:1)     "...the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins." (Revelation 14:3-4)    Comment  Here we have the great future destruction where billions of people will die. Only 144,000 virgin Jews with a protective mark on their heads will survive. (I suppose the 'Jews for Jesus' cult would serve as the leading candidates.)    How many believers realize that this means the death of everyone on earth but a few virgin Jews? And this includes the destruction of all Christians! (Of course the alleged Jesus, a virgin Jew, who claimed only a few would enter heaven would agree with this).      Note: Of course faithful Christians cannot accept the 144,000 figure so they must either become atheists, ignore these verses, reject Revelation as just dream nonsense, or try to revise its meaning to something they can accept. Some try to get creative by claiming that Rev. 7:-9,"...a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues...," means an unlimited number will enter heaven. Not so. The "all" in this verse speaks about all the tribes of Israel (the Jews) scattered around the nations of the world. The verse comes right after listing the tribes in Rev. 7:1-8. And man doesn't name the number but rather the angel who speaks in John's dream. And John reports the number, three times, in chapters 7 and 14, as shown above. Sorry Christians but all of you will have to suffer with all the atheists and unbelievers in God's hell. Welcome to the club!     Beware of a future "Armageddon" caused by religious people. Belief in self-fulfilling prophesies creates self-fulfilling acts.    ? ? ? Promise To Return ? ? ?   Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom. (Matthew 16:28)    Comment  Most Christians do not realize that Jesus' promise of his second coming did not apply to our generation or to a future generation, but only to the generation of his time. Also, Jesus said in Rev. 3:11: "Behold I come quickly..."    Those poor people of early Christianity! They thought the texts got written for them, yet Jesus never fulfilled his promise.    Two thousand years have rolled by and yet many "true" believers still await his "quick" return. As any school child knows, anyone who does not keep promises does not deserve our trust, much less our admiration.    Furthermore, to believe in a second coming and the end of the world gives no reason to feel concerned about the long-term future of Earth. Why should we care about the environment, wars, or suffering if we believe that the world will come to an end soon and that everything will get taken care of in heaven?    ? ? ? Jesus Reveals Himself ? ? ?  http://www.nobeliefs.com/DarkBible/darkb...  "I am the root and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star." (Revelation 22:16)    Comment  This verse presents the most shocking revelation in the entire Bible. On the very last page, it reveals Jesus as the "bright and morning star". In other words, Lucifer-- Satan!    In Isaiah 14:12, St. Jerome, translated the Hebrew "morning star" into the Latin term "Lucifer" (light bearer), a name commonly ascribed to Satan by Christians, and represents the fallen star, an ancient symbol for the fallen or evil one. The mourning star actually appears as the planet Venus, the brightest "star" in the sky (but the ancients did not know about planets). Venus always appears low on the horizon, thus it looked like a fallen star (fallen angel) to the believers.    Although the Isaiah verse describes the fallen king of Babylon, Christians have, for centuries, ascribed Satan as taking many forms. And what more powerful form could an evil being take than to pretend himself as the saviour of the world? This would certainly explain the hate filled verses attributed to Jesus and the blind followers who inherit ignorance. Thus, a conclusion, based on Christian beliefs of Satan, and the belief in the "inerrancy" of the Bible, one must conclude that Jesus has revealed himself as Satan!    What a Revelation!|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	Rapture is not in the bible-the doctrine was started in the 1800's and is not biblical.

AA10702349	Right you are about the choice issue. But, remember that the classic alcoholic really doesn't have any choice about his or her predelictions either; but they can, and some do, recover from such a condition.    And, unfortunately, the APA whom you quoted does not have any research to back up their cavalier claims about orientation change, whereas there is much research to the contrary, which their political guild (yes, it is NOT a scientific guild, sad to say) completely ignores, and hope that you, and everyone else, won't discover. The two latest studies are Spitzer's qualitative study from 2002, and Jones and Yarhouse's longitudinal study from 2007. Both indicate change as not only possible, but as a frequent occurrence, although not necessarily possible for everyone. And contrary to what the APA reported, both studies are valid and reliable studies. So, I ask you, why is a reputable organization like the APA propagating misinformation? And, to say that a study isn't "acceptable" because of whom were the researchers (just because they may have a different world and life view) is both scientifically invalid and illogical reasons (ad hominem fallacy), and quite unprofessional. If even the devil himself did the study, but it was found to be valid and reliable, then it MUST be accepted by all of science. And, all APA members know this to be true.      So, if you are truly interested in this issue for what scientific research has to say about it, then I would recommend you begin educating yourself at websites such as NARTH.com.

And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.   Genesis 2 says:   And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

Well, it *is* a **moral** issue.  But, to the best of my knowledge, homosexuals have exactly the same rights as heterosexuals in most Western countries.  No one that I know limits the rights of homosexuals more than the rights of heterosexuals - quite the contrary, in fact, in the U.S.  For example, hate crime laws clearly favor minority groups of all sorts.  When was the last time a rapist was charged for rape as a hate crime because he raped only women?      2) When in reality it is who they are.     Well, if they *weren't*, they would have a hard time telling anyone anything, wouldn't they?      3) They are conviently bringing the Bible up when most of our population has premarital sex, which is also a sin according to the Bible. But that's not against the law!    Yes, but it used to be and it still should be.    Understand:  a lot of the people who are against gay marriage are NOT against outlawing fornication, adultery OR homosexuality.  However, many Christians (including myself) support outlawing all of these things - just as they used to be outlawed ('way back in the 60s).      4) So I'm asking you, is this really all about religion?    For me it most certainly is.  However, clearly there is also a cultural tradition here as well.  For example:  why do we have statutory rape laws?  It's not in the bible (though there IS something similar...)!  We, as a culture, perceive such things to be improper.  Homosexuality, likewise, continues to be perceived by a huge portion of the population as improper, even though much of that population (in accordance with societal norms) no longer perceives fornication as improper (and never considered husband adultery to be improper...)      5) Even if they may be a different religion or they could be a Christian, they have to abide by the Bible?    Understand the point of view of Christians such as myself:  it is not a matter of religious imposition.    For example:  the bible says that stealing is wrong.  Now, maybe that's common sense:  but it remains true that for many, many people, stealing is only wrong if you get caught (and then, it's the people who catch you who are in the wrong!)  SO, that moral is NOT obvious to everyone.  However, as a Christian, it is quite obvious to me.  It is part of my Christian morality, true, but it is a *moral* issue, not an issue of worship.  I will always support laws that prohibit thievery.    Similarly, for Christians, homosexuality.  It is not about "do what the bible says or else".  It is about "this is a wrong thing.  Should I stand idly by while wrong things are being done, or should I support laws that prohibit wrong doing?"  The answer should be obvious.  For the VERY SAME reason that I support laws prohibiting thievery, rape, murder, etc. etc., I will also support laws prohibiting abortion, homosexuality, fornication and murder.

All sexual energy was directed towards filling women with babies as early and as often as possible; all other sexual behavior was criminalized.    It was a practical matter, and had nothing to do with morality. In fact, quite the contrary; homosexuality isn't immoral - it hurts nobody. Homophobia hurts and sometimes kills - that's what's immoral.    Christians can't reconcile the idea of a fair god with those barbaric laws, so they have to pretend that homosexuality is an immoral act (it isn't), a choice (it isn't - if you think it is, can you tell me about when you made the choice?), and unnatural (it's not - it's observed in many animal species).    You could argue that in today's overpopulated world, heterosexuality should be the 'sin'.    P.S. When the priests came to arrest Jesus, a young man who was with him dropped his linen cloth and "fled from them naked" (Mark 14:51-52). Need I say more?|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Because of SIN!

Even though the bible does talk about gays , if they choose to be gay or born that way you shouldn't discriminate. I mean they pay taxes like everyone else don't they?

In our world we're we clone sheep and try to split embryos and so forth some one being "gay" could have been a side effect or just the hormones they're bodies produce.     Humans can not send someone to hell or not. God can and that's all that matters. You can say gay people do this gay people do that but God loves gay people, because god said he loves sinners too (us) and being gay in the bible does count as being a sinner.

Do straight people like them really remember a time they chose to be straight? Of course not. Sexual orientation is not a conscious choice for anyone. A lifestyle is a conscious choice but not the feelings that underlie it.     Biologically I think homosexuality is probably a benign birth defect like left handedness. A birth defect is not a sin nor is a genetic disposition. Gays do not become gay from abuse by older gays. Abuse starts after they turn gay and the straights turn on them and abuse them. How typical of the abusers to blame their victims.|`|RAnceA2jaa	God created us with our abilities to make our decisions and those that turned gay chose to be gay on their own choice.

5db661aa7c4e9f42fa8139651a98c24caa	The recompense referred to in this scripture are the natural consequences of living outside the boundaries in a fallen world subject to futility and the corruption of death.  God doesn't have to inflict punishment upon those who take it upon themselves....and that is the context of this particular verse.    However, to answer your question, I would say yes for those who are unsaved.  Jesus Christ took the punishment upon Himself for those who believe in His sacrifice, death and resurrection....but for those who are outside the kingdom, judgment can be swift and resolute.  Go to the book of Acts and see what happened to Ananais and Sapphira (who could not have been born again and filled with satan at the same time), and to Herod for exalting himself as God before the people.  Two New Testament examples of punishment while you're alive.    Here's another:  1 Corinthians 5.  The man who was excommunicated from the church for his incestuous relationship with his father's wife.  He had failed to repent or heed the warnings from two or three witnesses, so Paul exercised his apostolic authority to turn this man over to satan for the destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit might be saved.  (Sometimes people who hit rock bottom after they've suffered the consequences of their sins will repent and turn back to God.......)      This judgment was divinely ordained, allthough Paul didn't say God would strike this man....he was removed from the protective covering of prayer in his church so he was open prey for satan.  There's a difference, but it certainly is a punishment dealt while he was alive.      In this particular case with redemptive purpose though.  Not so for Ananais, Sapphira or Herod.    Interesting question - thank you.|`|tDmemV5yaa	I don't believe that God punishes you for your sins if you are a Christian.  That is the reason the Christ died on the cross.

Sins separate us from God and from the Church.    One of the worst practical "here-and-now" consequences of sins is the way sins tend to lead us to sin more.  The more we sin, the harder it is to stop sinning and turn toward God.    Read the story of the prodigal son in the Gospel of Luke.  Sin leads to misery.  Rejection of sin leads to a better life,  but don't give up sin only because you want to be rewarded for it.  Give up sin because you love God and want to praise Him with your life's actions.

People worship creation, or images, etc. & are turned over to the lust of their flesh. And they burn in their lust for things that aren't natural.    And Exodus 20 the iniquities go to the 3rd & 4th generations of those who hate God.    So?  Consequences of sin is death. And this isn't really punishment from God. But it is. If we learn by our mistakes though, we can be redeemed through faith in Jesus.    But even when we are saved because Jesus Christ has redeemed us. God will discipline us. And some times it is rather harshly that people will die early. But to be saved (Born of His Spirit & cleansed by His Blood) is to have received eternal life. So even if we die early (for not discerning the body of Christ), we still are His child & He loves welcoming us home.

He may use his laws governing natural things, or he may use other persons as instruments to express his anger. Those who violate his moral laws are under his wrath and receive in themselves the full recompense, which was due for their error. These suffer a disapproved mental state, degradation, diseases, strife, and death. (Ro 1:18, 24, 27-32) When a person violates laws of the land that are in harmony with Gods laws and is punished by the governmental authority, this is an indirect expression of Gods wrath against that one.

Deut. 4:16 - of course, in early history Israel was forbidden to make images of God because God didn't yet reveal himself visibly "in the form of any figure."     Deut. 4:17-19 - hence, had the Israelites depicted God not yet revealed, they might be tempted to worship Him in the form of a beast, bird, reptile or fish, which was a common error of the times.     Exodus 3:2-3; Dan 7:9; Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:22; John 1:32; Acts 2:3- later on, however, we see that God did reveal himself in visible form (as a dove, fire, etc).     Deut. 5:8 - God's commandment "thou shall not make a graven image" is entirely connected to the worship of false gods. God does not prohibit images to be used in worship, but He prohibits the images themselves to be worshiped.     Exodus 25:18-22; 26:1,31 - for example, God commands the making of the image of a golden cherubim. This heavenly image, of course, is not worshiped by the Israelites. Instead, the image disposes their minds to the supernatural and draws them to God.     Num. 21:8-9 - God also commands the making of the bronze serpent. The image of the bronze serpent is not an idol to be worshiped, but an article that lifts the mind to the supernatural.     I Kings 6:23-36; 7:27-39; 8:6-67 - Solomon's temple contains statues of cherubim and images of cherubim, oxen and lions. God did not condemn these images that were used in worship.     2 Kings 18:4 - it was only when the people began to worship the statue did they incur God's wrath, and the king destroyed it. The command prohibiting the use of graven images deals exclusively with the false worship of those images.     1 Chron. 28:18-19 - David gives Solomon the plan for the altar made of refined gold with a golden cherubim images. These images were used in the Jews' most solemn place of worship.     2 Chron. 3:7-14 - the house was lined with gold with elaborate cherubim carved in wood and overlaid with gold.     Ezek. 41:15 - Ezekiel describes graven images in the temple consisting of carved likenesses of cherubim. These are similar to the images of the angels and saints in many Catholic churches.     Col. 1:15 - the only image of God that Catholics worship is Jesus Christ, who is the "image" (Greek "eikon") of the invisible God.|`|n1eXQr5oaa	what the hell is that supposed to prove?    saints are not gods nor worshipped as such|`|AA11466759	Well, it's a biblical verse alright.|`|AA11832138	WOW..I didnt know that...Im not worshipping Mother Mary anymore...Thanks for letting me know.|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	Agree with it.

It proscribes superstition and irreligion. Superstition in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion; irreligion is the vice contrary by defect to the virtue of religion.    212 Over the centuries, Israel's faith was able to manifest and deepen realization of the riches contained in the revelation of the divine name. God is unique; there are no other gods besides him. He transcends the world and history. He made heaven and earth: "They will perish, but you endure; they will all wear out like a garment. . . . but you are the same, and your years have no end." In God "there is no variation or shadow due to change." God is "HE WHO IS", from everlasting to everlasting, and as such remains ever faithful to himself and to his promises.    2084 God makes himself known by recalling his all-powerful loving, and liberating action in the history of the one he addresses: "I brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage." The first word contains the first commandment of the Law: "You shall fear the LORD your God; you shall serve him. . . . You shall not go after other gods."

As a sinner, I feel it is my obligation to inform you that you will be punished in Hel the dreary subterranean abode ruled by its eponymous blue and black giantess Hel, or worse, Niflhel, the deeper level beneath Hel, and those who break oaths, abduct and rape women, and other vile things will be sent there to be among their kind to suffer harsh punishments, for denying Him that is the God of Gods.    Again, why even take the chance? Do you WANT to find yourself in Hel?    It is just so ignorant to think that Odin doesnt exist because who else could have CREATED ALL THIS? The world is so complicated and scary Odin HAS to have created everything because it couldnt just have created itself, right?    You people just dont understand because you havent accepted Odin in to your heart. Once you feel His grace and forgiveness, you will wonder how you ever existed with out His love!|`|NCRfZRopaa	I never needed science to make me disbelieve in God.

Some of the words sound trite now but still  are the best we have.  Life, Truth, Love, Intelligence, Omnipotent,  and all Knowing.  Best analogy I've seen is think of God as  electricity or energy.  We know partially how electricity  manifests and how to use it, but that is about all.

I am reminded of how many of the Lord's disciples were offended in Him, and in one of the saddest verses in the Bible , it tells us that many of His disciples went back and walked no more with the Lord, and Jesus asked  the twelve, will you also go away?     John 6:66 From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.   67 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?   68 Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.   69 And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.     A few verses above this Jesus said:    John 6:63 It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.    I love Peter's answer! " to Whom shall we go? " He knew that Jesus was the Christ the Son of the Living God, and that He alone had the words of eternal life, there was no one else to go to, and no where else to turn. It is like that for all of us that know the Lord and have heard from  Him, He is alive and real in us, and no one else can satisfy us, we have to hear from the Lord, because the words that He speaks are spirit and they are life.

When people come to know Christ as their Savior, they are brought into a relationship with God that guarantees their salvation as eternally secure. Numerous passages of Scripture declare this fact. (a) Romans 8:30 declares, "And those He predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified." This verse tells us that from the moment God chooses us, it is as if we are glorified in His presence in heaven. There is nothing that can prevent a believer from one day being glorified because God has already purposed it in heaven. Once a person is justified, his salvation is guaranteed - he is as secure as if he is already glorified in heaven.    (b) Paul asks two crucial questions in Romans 8:33-34 "Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died more than that, who was raised to life - is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us." Who will bring a charge against God's elect? No one will, because Christ is our advocate. Who will condemn us? No one will, because Christ, the One who died for us, is the one who condemns. We have both the advocate and judge as our Savior.    (c) Believers are born again (regenerated) when they believe (John 3:3; Titus 3:5). For a Christian to lose his salvation, he would have to be un-regenerated. The Bible gives no evidence that the new birth can be taken away. (d) The Holy Spirit indwells all believers (John 14:17; Romans 8:9) and baptizes all believers into the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:13). For a believer to become unsaved, he would have to be "un-indwelt" and detached from the Body of Christ.    (e) John 3:15 states that whoever believes in Jesus Christ will "have eternal life." If you believe in Christ today and have eternal life, but lose it tomorrow, then it was never "eternal" at all. Hence if you lose your salvation, the promises of eternal life in the Bible would be in error. (f) For the most conclusive argument, I think Scripture says it best itself, "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 8:38-39). Remember the same God who saved you is the same God who will keep you. Once we are saved we are always saved. Our salvation is most definitely eternally secure!|`|pbsrCPRAaa	These people saying you have to do something to stay saved have a works based/legalistic mindset....salvation is a gift not a conditional loan...Gods name is riding on keeping a person saved we didn't do anything to cause the new birth to happen and we cant do anything to undo it....we are sealed with the Holy Spirit....arminianism is really messed up....dont listen to em        People have committed hideous sins in the bible and were saved...david committed adultery and killed a man and he went to heaven....the "ill just do whatever i want and im still going to heaven" mindset isn't the mindset of a saved person if a person can just run wild and not care they are not saved God disciplines His children and a true child of God loves Him too much to live like that          Can't lose your salvation but if you are living like a goat its because you're a goat if you are living like a sheep its because you are a sheep...look into the doctrine of regeneration...|`|v6KSGrlJaa	nope it all depends if your repent your sins ,and you cant foul God ,the same rule applies to lying,stealing..etc probably end up in purgatory until you learn your lesson|`|AA11375099	CJ you are really messed up aren't you?

Grace is not a license to sin and we must live a life of repentance and reverence toward God.|`|xlY5fu6raa	once saved always saved??    you can accept jesus into your life.....but if you don't love him....you'll perish....jesus said himself that if you love me...you'll keep my commands  you can lose your rewards and you can lose your soul......accepting jesus and doing what he says can lead you into his kingdom and your rewards there will be greater beyond anything you ever imagine.....dont get decieve into thinking about once saved and always saved....you must like me and everyone else must contiune finishing our righteous  course and at the end of the road....we'll get to our final position in the afterlife|`|HBp5r76haa	The question is: once saved, really saved?    What I mean is, the moment you, upon repentance of your sins, truly accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, you also accept Him as LORD of your life and you give Him control over every aspect of your existence. This MUST cause a visible change in your life, or otherwise your repentance was not real and you were never saved on the first place.    Jesus said "18A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. 19Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them." Matthew 7:18-20    He also said:     21"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' 23Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!' Matthew 7:21-23    The message sounds pretty clear to me.  If you are still bound to sin to the point of murder and rape, then you are surely NOT saved!|`|TwfyliKiaa	The law shows you that you need to be saved(sins).We all are dirty our best effort is nothing but dirty rags. We cant say he's worse then me. It's not that God looks at our sins, it's do we accept Jesus? It's a free gift, not based on what we've done. Thank God!|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Why do people always bring up murder and rape?     What about lying?     All saved believers are still sinners, and still sin every day.      All sins past, present, and future are FORGIVEN when the person believes in Jesus for salvation without adding any of their own works.     It is IMPOSSIBLE to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13).  THAT'S how good the Lord Jesus's salvation is.     If you think you can lose or "leave" salvation, then you aren't saved at all. Because Jesus gives ETERNAL life, not "temporary" or "probationary" life. So if you think you can lose it, then you don't have it at all. What you have is a false gospel of works, and no false gospel will get you into heaven (Galatians 1:6-9).     If a person adds works, then they are saying that Jesus's death for PAYMENT of sins is somehow "not good enough" to save.  What a blasphemous thought.     In other words, until a person believes that what he has received from the Lord Jesus is permanent and cannot be lost, he is not yet born again. A person cannot believe in Christ alone for his eternal destiny and also believe that he must do something (or avoid doing something) to keep it.|`|U24VtSlZaa	Not exactly.    The saved person goes to heaven, all right, but I doubt he'll get off the hook.|`|0hQyClksaa	If you trace its roots, both the "once saved, always saved" and "salvation by grace and faith alone" doctrines are both found to be Gnostic gospel teachings that Paul was fighting against (as well as James) in certain passages in the NT.    OSAS comes from people who make scripture seem to fight against other scripture...and God does not contradict Himself.  All Scripture is written in a PROGRESSIVE REVELATION format, meaning that we don't get all the total teaching on one subject in one place in scripture, instead it is spread out throughout the whole book.    Salvation (or eternal life) is based upon a covenant relationship just as it was in the Old Testament, the ONLY difference is that the sacrificial system in the OT was done away with in the NT by the one time sacrifice of Christ.    You still have to obey God in order to remain in that covenant relationship...or you throw away your salvation (it is true that you cannot loose your salvation, but you can lay it down and walk away from it - intentionally or not).    If you are obeying your faith, then you meet the criteria of scripture, "The just shall live by faith."  The word faith in this passage means the system of faith you espouse, NOT the head nowledge assent (the difference between Pistis and Pitheo...the two Greek words used for faith in the NT....and confusion of the two make once saved, always saved seem feasible...but that is error upon the one not studying his Bible like he was commanded to by God).      Gnostics are NOT Christians....so the only reason why Christians keep pushing this false doctrine is because they have never studied its origins...or they are Gnostic themselves, which means you can't be saved because Gnostic salvation is found only in "secret knowledge" that you can't know...so how can you ever get saved???|`|XTi1x0N0aa	Why would a saved person murder or rape anyone?

Many people come to Wicca because they heard about it and like one or two of the practices or possibly just want to upset their family. If you really wish to practice Wicca you must first understand that we dont have a central leadership. Also, though there are many Traditions in Wicca, including Eclectic Wicca, we all follow some basic precepts.     01. Wicca is an oath-bound mystery religion, each Wiccan should either be Dedicated or Initiated as a Wiccan to be considered a Wiccan by their peers and/or the general Wiccan community.   02.  Wiccans are polytheistic, honoring a variety of gods and goddesses.  03.  Wiccans are also dualistic, seeing individual deities, at least to some extent, as aspects of one God and one Goddess.  04. Wiccans are also pantheistic do some degree or another, viewing divinity as immanent within the natural world.  05. Wicca encompasses the practice of magick even though many Wiccans dont practice magick.  06. Wiccans show religious devotion to the Goddess and/or God (depending upon Tradition).   07. Wiccas ethical basis is expressed in the Wiccan Rede ("An it harm none, do as ye will"), and the Threefold Law ("What ye send returns three times over").  08. Wiccan Ritual usually involves casting a circle as the basic setting for spiritual and magical work, as well as emphasizes the Platonic four elements of earth, air, fire and water and some form of gender polarity, be that theologically in the image of the God and Goddess, and/or mundanely in the physical gender of participants as well.  09. Wiccans more often than not incorporate some form of the "Great Rite" (union of the God and Goddess), frequently symbolized in the blessing of the ritual wine by the conjoining of the athame (ritual knife) and chalice (ritual wine cup).    I suggest that you get your hands on Wicca for Beginners by Thea Sabin and/or The Circle Within by Dianne Sylvan. Both of these books are very good reading and both will give you some deeper insight to the Craft and how it relates to you. I hope that this little blurp has helped you out some.    Blessed Be    Nyjh    P.S. Teen Witch and Elements of Witchcraft are also good and are geared to Teens in the Craft.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	If you can come up with a non self-contradictory definition of "Wiccan Pantheist", I don't see why not.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|mFy3M8mVaa	????? said it perfectly. There are Wiccan Pantheists.
a8kAassWaa	The Scriptures tell us that we all face temptations. First Corinthians 10:13 says, No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man. Perhaps this provides a little encouragement as we often feel that the world is caving in on us alone, and that others are immune to temptations. We are told that Christ was also tempted: For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin (Hebrews 4:15).    Where, then, do these temptations come from? First of all, they do not come from God, although He does allow them. James 1:13 says, For God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone. In the first chapter of Job, we see that God allowed Satan to tempt Job, but with restrictions. Satan is roaming around on the earth like a lion, seeking people to devour (1 Peter 5:8). Verse 9 tells us to resist him, knowing that other Christians are also experiencing his attacks. By these passages we can know that temptations come from Satan. We see in James 1:14 that temptation originates in us as well. We are tempted when we are carried away and enticed by our own lust (verse 14). We allow ourselves to think certain thoughts, allow ourselves to go places we should not go, and make decisions based on our lusts that lead us into the temptation.    How then do we resist the temptations? First of all, we must return to the example of Jesus being tempted in the wilderness by Satan in Matthew 4:1-11. Each of Satans temptations was met with the same answer: It is written, followed by Scripture. If the Son of God used the Word of God to effectively end the temptationswhich we know works because after three failed efforts, the Devil left him (v. 11)how much more do we need to use it to resist our own temptations? All our efforts to resist will be weak and ineffective unless they are powered by the Holy Spirit through the constant reading, studying, and meditating on the Word. In this way, we will be transformed by the renewing of your mind (Romans 12:2). There is no other weapon against temptation except the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God (Ephesians 6:17). Colossians 3:2 says, Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth. If our minds are filled with the latest TV shows, music and all the rest the culture has to offer, we will be bombarded with messages and images that inevitably lead to sinful lusts. But if our minds are filled with the majesty and holiness of God, the love and compassion of Christ, and the brilliance of both reflected in His perfect Word, we will find that our interest in the lusts of the world diminish and disappear. But without the Words influence on our minds, we are open to anything Satan wants to throw at us.    Here, then, is the only means to guard our hearts and minds in order to keep the sources of temptation away from us. Remember the words of Christ to His disciples in the garden on the night of His betrayal: Keep watching and praying that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak (Matthew 26:41). Most Christians would not openly want to jump into sin, yet we cannot resist falling into it because our flesh is not strong enough to resist. We place ourselves in situations or fill our minds with lustful passions, and that leads us into sin.    We need to renew our thinking as we are told in Romans 12:1-2. We need to no longer think as the world thinks, or walk in the same way that the world walks. Proverbs 4:14-15 tells us, Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not proceed in the way of evil men. Avoid it, do not pass by; Turn away from it and pass on. We need to avoid the path of the world that leads us into temptation because our flesh is weak. We are easily carried away by our own lusts.    Matthew 5:29 has some excellent advice. If your right eye makes you stumble, tear it out and throw if from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. That sounds pretty severe! Sin is severe! Jesus is not saying that we literally need to remove body parts. Cutting out the eye is a drastic measure, and Jesus is teaching us that if necessary, a drastic measure should be taken to avoid sin.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	The only way to resist temptation is to stay close to God, read your Word every day and pray , then it will become easier for you to say no...  Because when you nourish your spirit with the word, the flesh becomes weaker and weaker and you can get it in control...  When my xhusband divorced me , I prayed for God to take control of that part of me, until He sends me a new husband...and God did just that...|`|RJECt4zFaa	I like it that you reduced sin to 'yadda, yadda'.|`|aYY9dPVJaa	Deciding to and renewing our mind to the truth and acting always out of a love for God  Life is free-will choice.  Throughout all time, those who resisted temptation received the benefit of doing so, and those who cratered face the consequences. Sometimes the benefits/consequences are immediately apparent, sometimes not.  We have a saviour from sin, The Lord Jesus Christ, who delivers us from all the sins we have and will commit, and the sinful nature we inherited from Adam. Look at Christ and stop looking at yourself, especially your sin.|`|3E6lf2cJaa	I don't pay attention to whats a sin, everything's considered a sin so I might as well enjoy sinning.

If the guy has the respect that he should for you, then he will not put you in the place to have to say no, or be tempted too far to stop. When you go out on a date, take some Christian friends with you. Don't be alone together in private places.     God will be very pleased at your decision to follow what he wants for you. You will have a clear conscience and your wedding night will be even more special.     Never give your precious self to anyone who is not committed to you in marriage.

If you truly believe, you'll be able to conquer those temptations with God's help.  He said so in the Bible that He would somehow "make a way".  And don't worry if you slip up once or twice because remember that we are still human.  He will forgive you.  Just don't do anything that you absolutely, POSITIVELY know is sinful.  That might not be the best idea.    Good luck and God bless. :)|`|CyslkJdEaa	Roadside Temptation and Follows Jesus gave two of the 'best' answers.  As for my two cents, James 1:12 Blessed is the 'man' who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. Also, verse 13-14 Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted of God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. 14. But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed.  As Roadside Temptation and Follows Jesus said (no matter how 'trite' it might sound), Give it to God and the Holy Spirit (if He's already in your life) and confess and believe that they will help you in your struggle, to over-come the temptation.  As the saying goes, "God can do anything but fail".  God be with you and hopefully and prayerfully, He will send you a special 'trusted' Christian friend and prayer partner as well.|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	Get yourself involved in a Church!

Of course, they discriminate against black people, but also against other Mexicans with dark skin.  For example, my own grandmother once asked me, "What happened to you?  When you were little, you were so nice and light, but now you're much darker?"  At least among older Mexicans, it is better to be light skinned than dark.  Perhaps it was an advantage because if you could pass for white, maybe you wouldn't have been discriminated against as much.    The same thing occurs in the black community, where light skin is more desirable than dark.  Also, I once spoke to a fellow from India, and he said they also discriminate against each other based on skin color.  It isn't just Mexicans who do this, I'm afraid it happens all over the world.

v7KJMqz6aa	Greetings Bluebootz!    This quotation is significant and has been interpreted different ways through the various religions. Ultimately it must be asked who or what is it that interprets this quotation? On observation the ego and the mind are responsible for interpretation and the ego/mind are transitory, the very source of duality. It is the ego/mind that seeks the truth miring itself, a false identity, in the quicksand of theories and concepts regarding the truth, creation, God and the meaning of life.  Prior to the arising of the ego and the mind (manifest consciousness) there is a subtle presence, one which cannot understood by the mind, therefore cannot be conditioned by words. For the sake of this post I will label it as awareness or That . That in which the relative, temporal manifest consciousness appeared is Absolute thus truth.    Truth/Awareness is the unchanging, subtle/static substratum of the dynamic ever changing manifest consciousness, which is the realm of "I am" and a perceived separate person acting on it's own accord in the world". This sense of separation can also be referred to as "ahamkara", the "I-former, or the I thought". Awareness (That) is immutable, non-personal and all-inclusive, experienced by all, the basis of existence and in the background of all transitory experience. It is the very source of sentience and is the seed  within all things animate and inanimate. That is always present, but virtually ignored by the senses, mind/ego which  is firmly entrenched in the individual identity, through the world it has created by conditioning and concepts. The source of sentience has been given many names: Brahman, God, Krishna, Allah, Jesus ect.., but these names are only inspirations of the ephemeral consciousness arising and pulsating on the immuatable surface of That.         From the vital breath arose the sense "I am", which is all-inclusive, experienced by all. Everyone knows that they are, "I am", but the primary and most important question is: Who am I?  The sense "I am" is a direct pointer to That in which the world has appeared.  One thing is certain and that is the fact you exist, so this is truth. All things expounded regarding God, creation theories, spiritual and religious books are secondary, merely mental concepts that need to be examined and dropped because they are not necessarily the truth, only sysyems of belief garnered from worldly knowledge. The spark "I am", the very fact that you exist now in the present moment is the truth and fact and "I am" leads to That which supports manifest consciousness, the beginning, the middle and the end so to speak. "I am" is a fragment (jivatman) of the totality, yet identical to the totality, but is subject to false identification as one limited individual acting alone in the world.  The sense "I am" is the key which unlocks the door to reality and the door to reality is not found in the external. All thought, faith, discipline ect.. regarding 'I am" must be concentrated within, for within is "That" in which the world appeared and That is the very Self in all beings.       From the ancient  Vedas come Mahaavakyas which denote great sayings, one of which is Tat Tvam Asi "That thou art". You are "That" in which the world appeared and That is not a person. "That" is the immutable substratum of the pusating ephemeral consciousness which gives rise to mutiplicity and the illusion of many minds projecting their own world, Ultimately there can be no world without you. That is the truth, the life and the way. I am is the seed of consciousness.     In closing, I state that "you are That", are non-personal and have never experienced a birth or a death. You forever are That and from you the world has appeared. Tat Tvam Asi.|`|G9VBTg47aa	I don't know, I just am.

Who knows you better than "you". I was thinking about this last night slightly also.    No matter how one tries to creatively express an idea, One always seem to find common analogies or references to help ease the commuincation process. If one also used wild metaphors or personal identity references from stories or ideas of mythological entities, then one would be expressing creativity with a biased mindset.    That being said, if we understood that every part of the world has culture, languages, and stories to tell, then we in ourselves are in a way similar to an entire village. One would seem to be capable of growing with others and sharing any knowledge to move forward in the pursuit of understanding a new inquiry.     Although we could balance out how and why we imagine things to be, it does seem like it always changes. It reminds me of the serenity prayer.    Sorry if I rambled on, I've been thinking about ways to write down more chapters for a book I am thinking about and have slightly been playing the parts of some of the characters I want to put in it. I seem to think of it as the shock factor kind of. Telling someone something to see how they react.

AA11620807	The people who say this means you're bi are makin groundless assumptions. It's all in WHY gay porn turns ya on. Some possible reasons are: <br>  <br>      1. The men themselves turn on the viewer<br>      2. The sexual energy shown is the turn on.<br>      3. The taboo factor  of 2 men having sex <br>      4. The "empathetic arousal" principle of seeing a man orgasm is multiplied in proportion to the # of men in the scene. <br>      5. Fantasy and uninhibited sex is itself a turn on for many, and a scene with a guy gratifying other men on camera IS pretty uninhibited.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>      You're not alone in the duality on the subject.

Just be happy that what your in to is on the Vanilla side of things and that you aren't in to things that make people do a double take like feet or clowns...|`|nfQhsRvfaa	Just because gay porn turns you on doesn't mean you're gay. Believe me I know. I'm straight and I've always been straight. Never been attracted to a woman in my whole life. But girl on girl action or a woman touching herself turns me on ALOT!!! lol It just means you appreciate the beauty of the male body and how sensual it is.|`|f4RnGIeSaa	It could be that you have to experience the sex to open yourself to it.  It isn't uncommon to unknowingly have a block against it.<br>  <br>  You could just go out and try having sex with a guy, or you could just accept that what you really are attracted to is the fantasy, not the real thing.|`|t4DP30r6aa	Your not bi.. seriously, your watching porn! it's supposed to turn you on.. It's not a multi-billion dollar industry for nothing.. It's good at what it sets out to do!..No matter how you spin it you are watching SEX!|`|evB63qWvaa	Well, you said you like the girlyness of girls.  Have you ever seen a girly guy and been attracted to them?  It just really depends on what you like.|`|MM5iGrnIaa	Your turn on probably had very little to do with two men, but something else contained in the porn.|`|ojUM9WbXaa	Well, there's a simple answer.<br>  You like watching gay porn as an observer, but you would never want to do it yourself. (:|`|H41u0B8Jaa	That doesn't make you bisexual....actually engaging in sexual acts with both men and women makes you bisexual not watching gay porn!  It is all just fantasy...some women enjoy watching lesbian porn too but wouldn't actually have sex with a woman.  I say don't worry about it...for whatever reason you find it a turn on to watch it....don't stress out about it or try and figure out why...it just does but you are still only sexually attracted to women...you are straight.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Only 10% of us is 'exclusively straight.'  You are part of the 'great 80% who are technically bisexual, but you are at the end closest to the exclusively straight.  So you like gay pornography occasionally.  This is called 'fantasy sex' and is far from wanting to have 'real sex' with another man.  You are still 'basically straight' my dear, but you should know that you are 'technically bisexual' whether or not you want to 'admit it' in public.  In other words, you are NORMAL!
mHKToJeiaa	He ascended into the Holy of Hollies (where the throne of God sits) to be our High Priest, to bring the blood of the Atonement into the sanctuary.   That we might obtain mercy.  Because He is worthy to ascend, we are worthy when we put on Christ. We are able to ascend by the same Spirit he ascended by, when we receive & walk in the same Spirit that was in him. The Spirit of Christ & of the Son. The Holy Spirit of the Comforter, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of YHWH    Acts 1:2   Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:  The Spirit is the form God wants us to recognize & relate to him by.    John 4:23-24   23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.   24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.    John 14:18   I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.|`|q57P8uJbaa	Well now he is at the right hand of the Father interceding on our behalf.  Jesus also said that if he leaves, he would send the Comforter in his place, that is the Holy Spirit.  Jesus said that he also goes to prepare a place for you in his Father's house.    John 14   1Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.      2In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.      3And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also    Praise God!|`|AA10242926	Right after he floated up out of their sights there were two men in shining garments that asked the people, "Why stand ye here gazing up?

So I suppose it was so they could tell of how he would come again.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

Then again, I'm not a mind reader LOL!|`|V9oNKkDgaa	well just because you're surrounded by it and don't notice until people tell you. my mom is from Tennessee and when people here(MA) tell her she has an accent she's like NO I DON'T. but i have a neutral, blah, average american accent and although people in america don't think i have an accent and talk "normal", if i traveled to england they would think my accent was funny, like we would theirs. their are so many accents so don't be ashamed. like the boston, new york, southern, philly, midwestern, and jersey. the majority of us are known as "neutral" or "the cali accent" as the britts seems to think.|`|qq804CE8aa	Well people from N. Jersey think people from the south have accents.  I guess I made the list when I was up there and said the word you'all. HA.|`|mqQUqXxNaa	Not an accent just a really bad lisp...|`|e3685f49608aafc5826d78a4417c8ab8aa	interesting -- "wooder" is more of a south jersey/philly thing. of course, the ny (nyc even) accent is complex and has many variants. bergen cty ppl have no distinct accent.
m1oEGlnmaa	Because....most of the time it IS true. I've lived in 3 states in different regions (MA, Cali and NC).I'm not trying to stereotype or anything, but since moving to North Carolina. Most of the people where I live (especially in the country side) do fit the stereotype. I have never heard so many racist jokes about Obama under the pretense of, "I'm not racist". Or say the KKK is planning to assassinate Obama....but then again, my favorite answer, "I'm not racist". I even had some people joke about their fact that their Grandfathers were in the KKK. They are also HEAVILY conservative, virtually everyone I know goes to Church on Sunday (and more), etc. Church is everything. Even in my school election, McCain overwhemingly won over Obama.......and at my old school (in MA) Obama won over McCain. Don't even get my started on their weird and old view of race. Thank god, I wasn't raised in the South. They really make you choose down here (I even had someone ask me, if I consider myself 'black'. The first time I've ever been asked that). I, honesty, do think they're a bit narrow-minded. But then again, their in the South. They're not exposed to as many cultures/enthcities (besides black and white) and the most exotic is "Native American" (which everyone claims). Maybe in the bigger cities, it's not that bad. But from where I live they really do live up to the stereotype, unforunately. :(     About the interracial dating, it's average. It's mostly the cliche black men/white women situation.|`|XBwLjq1daa	wth, if they're sick of it, then I should be dying because of how IM portrayed in the media.|`|yhfG07Jtaa	I'm a southerner sick of being stereotyped by the Yankees who have bought my state's politicians. The reason the south has gone so solid Republican is that we have been so heavily colonized by northern retirees.   These RightWingers are the ones who sold Ronald Reagan on the God, Guns & Gays philosophy - convincing middle-of-the-road southerners that somehow they would benefit by ceding huge tax benefits to Rockefellers & Winthrops who pretended to understand how they felt.  Rockefellers don't give a rip if their entire fiefdom of West Virginia falls into the river. Winthrops don't care if all of South Carolina rots under nuclear waste. But they sold both states on Republican tax cuts for the rich. How? By not arguing against homophobia, religious intolerance, and handguns for the illiterate masses.|`|wZMq5jqyaa	hmmm..maybe it's because it's basically where it all began. I never thought that eveyone in the south was racist. but some guy called me a stupid monkey when I was at Disney World. uhhhhh..not the best childhood memory lol..|`|E8FynDWIaa	Because I do not live in the South perhaps I have no business answering you but I would still like to share my thoughts. I believe that anyone who stereotypes a group of people ought to rethink their approach.  I certainly wouldn't blame any Southerners for being angry/hurt, whatever, but perhaps they should expend some energy pitying those who are causing the anxiety. In my opinion those who make such general accusations are the ones who really have a problem - they just haven't figured that out yet.  I personally have experienced wonderful Southern hospitality in a variety of Southern States on numerous occasions and in various venues.  Sadly, I also once had a very negative experience.  Should I allow that one negative experience to form my opinion of all Southerners?  Certainly not.  If I were to allow that, it would be a testament to ignorance and stupidity.  I have never relied upon the media to do my thinking for me and I sincerely hope that at least the majority of other people don't either!|`|xbISxnmfaa	Although Im not a Southerner Im from the West Coast but, I live in the south and those stereotypes are true for most people. Oh look at a politcal map and you will see all of the Southern states except for maybe one or two are CONSERVATIVE.|`|dXDroPtfaa	I live in Texas.  And yeah..Southerners get stereotyped w/all of those things.    It's crazy.  That's why I want to get out as fast as I can..    OHMY, and everyone thinks that just because you live in the South you have a dorky accent.|`|fEEbx6XTaa	Um, living in the South, a lot of it IS true. Stereotypes, unfortunately, have so much truth to them.     I have experienced so much anti-interrical daters, racist Rednecks, narrow-minded people......at the young age of 17.        I will get thumbs down, but there's a reason people say that.|`|B309jFKeaa	There are too many Southerners that keep living up to the stereotype but not all Southerners are like that.  The South is definitely better than it used to be but there's still lots of room for improvement.    California has more of these type of problems than the South these days.  California's reputation as a tolerant place is undeserved, it's becoming like Alabama in the 1950s.|`|C46DNX11aa	I'm live in the South and a red state. Racism isn't any worse here than it is any where else. I have found out through President Obama being elected that there is plenty of racims all over the U.S. to go around.

It should be known that plants were seen to have a soul just as any other living creature on the earth. The four types of plant life were trees, grasses, flowers, and vegetables. The trees were seen as the provider of shelter and other tools that were crafted from them. This resource wasn't merely used and disregarded or taken for granted. Thanks were always given and tobacco always offered to the spirit of the tree that gave its existence for the protection and survival of the people. The grasses of the land played an important role as well. Grass fed the buffalo, one of the most important resources to the Plains Indian. Sweetgrass, a very sacred plant, was also used for prayer and ceremony. Both man and animal for survival used the flower. The Saulteaux used flowers for such things as flavour in tea and other cuisine. Animals used flowers for food (e.g. Insects, deer, etc). The vegetables that surrounded the Saulteaux people were used for food.|`|5lbKGofgaa	Same as Chicgirl.|`|0jQcNWITaa	Yes I have spoken to trees.

Science has produced organic materials from inorganic substance under the conditions that the earth were billions of years ago.  Life can come from non-life.    There are some theories as to what caused the big bang.  Most atheists won't say that a supernatural source definitely did not cause the universe, but they feel that it is more prudent to seek out a natural cause before a supernatural one.    They don't accept there is no god.  They just think that according to the evidence at hand, nothing really points towards gods.     Religion is man-made.  There is no reason to believe otherwise.|`|M6VcuiyDaa	You can apply that line of reasoning to, well everybody    you act as if scientific fact is based on opinion.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	Pot to the kettle.|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Well since part of your list has been duplicated in the lab, it would be irrational to not believe in it.|`|yN3fWUCuaa	The dismissiveness out here is rather startling, considering they believe they hold the high ground on free thought.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	Who cares?

I don't need any atheists to tell me so or give me their approval.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	That is correct...and I mean that logically, rationally, reasonably and intelligently.|`|v7Wflu78aa	Most of us accept that the practice of science produces tentative explanations, models and predictions, subject to change.    Some of us also "believe" that there is no such thing as truth.    Finally, some of us accept that we have to take as "truth" only what can be proven with today's technology and explained in today's intellectual culture.    It is a convenient shorthand to label people who can't accept this reality as illogical, irrational, or unreasonable.  After all, we are all, at times, any one re more of those things.    And, it feels good to think that one is the sole arbiter of reason, rationality, logic and intelligence.    But, there are a few people who confuse FAITH with accepted scientific theories.  By definition, faith is believing that which can't be proved.  By definition, science is the development of proofs, models and predictions that CAN be or have been proved.    So, to the extent that science has codified and put into practice logic and rationality, and relies on the intelligence of the most intelligent people in our society, we can reasonably label fundamentalists as illogical, irrational and, alas, unintelligent, when they think and say that their faith is as "true" as science.    This is not the same as a geneticist saying, "Darwin's tree of life is wrong," because this statement can be tested, explored, and can be used to advance human knowledge and understanding.  (Look up "horizontal genec transfer"  to find out  more about this.)    While each side may have thought that logic, reason and intelligence were on their side, it was a normal way for scientific knowledge to grow.    But, some people insist that their belief in god, their belief that evolution is wrong, is the equivalent of a scientific hypothesis or model.  Their lack of understanding, their insistence on not understanding the nature of science, does leave them open to being called illogical, unreasonable and of lesser intelligence.|`|yX7fVGWLaa	accept evolution as fact...    It is.      accept life came from non-life...    It did.      accept the universe came from ??? but any answer other than God is ok...    God is a far less logical reason than many others.        accept there is no God or gods...    There aren't.      accept all religions are fairy tales..    They are.      but its atheists who are the open minded people...right...    Open to reasonable, logical, rational, intelligent explanations. Not "explanations" rooted in mysticism, superstition, mythology, and the occult.    Okay?|`|Q2NOsyLHaa	miss frmko if i may agree to marry with you, you will like Allah (pbs.org) very much, yes?  Please no worry, miss frmko, Yakman come on night of tomorrow to see you, yes?|`|eDYXQxA9aa	For me, and I suspect many others, to accept someone is reasonable, rational, or logical then all they have to do is hold beliefs or understandings based on reason, rational thought and logic. Whether they agree with me or not isn't relevant - if they continually present utterly illogical arguments in favour of their position, then I don't care what their position is, they're not logical, reasonable or rational.    Intelligence is different. You can be illogical and intelligent.
XpHRL9xaaa	Cut the material the same shape as the picture just bigger about 1/2 inch extra for seam since your hand sewing it.  i would cut  a super long strip that will be the sides and the bottom, and the strap of your purse, making the seam at the bottom of the bag.  Cut two pieces of material, long as you desire.  Then sew it on both sides good side in, turning it inside out.  Thats your side, bottom and strap.  Good luck

God has showed me so many things inthe spirit and as the bible says. " if you draw near to HIM, he will draw near to you"! and i can personally say that GOD has shown up and showed out for me..    P.S to give you all a hint of his goodness and his works.... all i can say is that GOd speaks to his children and uses them the same way as he did for noah, moses, abraham,adam, and shows them wonders the same way eve, etc etc....

Reading the Bible is supposed to increase/strengthen your faith in God, correct? Therefore, when a person reads the Bible, their faith in God will become stronger.    That's not what happened to me. Reading the Bible weakened my faith in God by the passage. In fact, now that I've rejected the Biblical God, I've never felt more liberated. I would never call this murderer my "Heavenly Father," because no father I know would kill his own children.     I'm not an atheist or an agnostic. I believe in a God, but nothing makes me happier that I left the Biblical Christianity. In fact, I thank God for helping me come to that decision. That was the only good direction I ever received from him.|`|hXxZ2kVfaa	the more i became closer to God, the more fixed my life became. my life became organized and smooth-flowing.|`|eyUVaqq2aa	when you are spiritually close to God, life makes more sense  you start to realize that you need to live for God|`|m73vgcxUaa	Yes and as you study more it will get deeper.

BUT when i was "spiritually close to god" i was a young child dealing with some problems at school.  It was really more an answer to all my questions for that time.  As i grew older i found that really all that crap happened for a reason OTHER than god and him having reason for everything.  Science and some common sense and most importantly experience living made me realize that it was my spirtual closeness that made things amke sesne, but, wrongfully so.  I dunno, im non-relegious now, seeking out what they all have to offer, although, my belief in no gods at all stands pretty firm.    Although, I am only 16, my answer might change with another decade or so of living.|`|yMqWvG8naa	My experience is the opposite.

It is important to remember that we should always thank God for all that we have - especially the blessing you describe.  We also need to remember that what you described is a blessing from God - it is a gift for which we need to be grateful, not something for which we should be proud.  We also need to keep thanking God, even when things get difficult for us.  Honest Christianity is often very difficult.|`|VDTTzwlUaa	No. I still had (and have) no idea what to do with my life.

Some don't believe in this "eternal" punishment (which, coincidently, wasn't even an idea until gentle Jesus came and told everyone it was).      I don't know that it makes me abhor Christianity . . . just makes it seem even more nonsensical than it already does.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	no     it is the truth so I accepted|`|H0LPCjIRaa	I thought that you were supposed to accept others no matter what they believe, so it doesn't fit any religeons to my knowledge.|`|RGe6Et0Xaa	Considering that is not mainstream Christian doctrine, it would be silly to abhor Christianity for something that only some 15% of Christians believe.|`|DvQLt59Paa	No, you abhor Christianity because you love your sin more.

He has to follow the law.|`|EAix5Av9aa	You answered your own question.    People have a choice. It is easier to do what is good for us than bad for us.   Satanist,occultists,witchs and those practising as such may end up in the head of the line for he;;. Some even believe they will rule ther(in hell)     Jesus came to set the captives free.   Demonic practising fool;s are there first to demand answers.mock God   .They think they can deceive others as they have and never face consequences.     Most believers here realize how limited satan is in his path of deception and his followers.    Do not be deceived Jesus is Lord and God manifest in the flesh.|`|AA11521494	That's one reason why I hate it.  Answers from Christians who say that's not true possibly haven't fully thought through the implications of what the new testament actually says, because that's what it comes down to.|`|ykImIiTwaa	God eventually saves all of us from sin and punishment and shares His complete happy experience of eternity with everyone...      God reconciles all to Himself through Jesus Christ, Who makes peace through His shed blood and crucifixion (Col 1:20). Jesus is the Lamb of God Who takes away all the sins of all the world (Jn 1:29). The creation itself, also, shall be freed from the slavery of corruption into the glorious freedom of the children of God (Rom 8:21).    Hell's punishment is not forever but until the end of the eons - eonian punishment. People don't sin enough during their mortal lives for God to choose endless punishment besides it would spoil the future of eternity to have a section continually reserved for endless torture...    People are made by God to rebel against His ideal will for them and then offered a choice - forgiveness of their rebellion, or, punishment for their sins until they have paid the last 'penny'... After punishment, those who went through torture in hell come to realise they need faith on God to succeed in life and they are converted into God's kingdom so that they cease from sinning and are rewarded for their compliance...      There are two bible translations which uphold the doctrine of Universal Reconciliation with God, and the union of all beings into experience of God as the all in each of us. For a free download of these bibles you can try this website:  http://www.scripture4all.org/    An outline of the bible references which support Christian Universalism has been posted at this webpage:  http://uk.geocities.com/timpauloconnor@b...|`|E71jweytaa	i know    its like me warning you that jumping off the Eiffel tower will kill you, then you jump and die      its my fault because i warned you right?|`|wR1XyyrUaa	That is pretty much it.

We are ALL sinners and fall short of the glory of God. The wages of sin is death, BUT the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Jesus does love us, that is why He gives us a choice to accept His payment for our sin.  God is holy , and He cannot be in the presence of sin- however He loved us so much that He made for us NOT TO BURN IN HELL, in which we all deserve to do. It was not the nails that kept Christ on the Cross, it was His love for you and for me.|`|FRwaGpJaaa	I don't think that is the saying. I think you are misinformed.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Not familiar with the concept.

I know enough about the religion to gather that.     Yeah, really. Love Jesus or he will friggin KILL you!    Really, people. What would Jesus think? He's turning in his grave or whatever. If he ever existed, that is. everything everyone ever told you or indoctrinated into you are words written and decided upon by people, and then translated by people, and interpreted by people to suit their wishes. None of it actually came from Jesus, in all likelihood.|`|rz4AUvbaaa	The concept you have stated is not Christianity, but is a myth believed by many.  Simple seekers of truth will go beyond this.|`|Ur53Pf6zaa	Yes.  That concept does, and should make us abhor Christianity.   Rather, should make us abhor Christians.  Our F-up with this religion shouldn't be a poor reflection on God. But it does, and it really ticks me off.    Truth is .. there is no hell.  Its a made up doctrine.  Read 'Tentmaker.org'.    God is knocking at your door - wants you to know the truth.  He is a good God, more than you can conceive.   Pray about it, ask God to show you when you've seen the truth( don't specify what you think the truth is .. let it come to you).  Your heart will stop when you read Tentmaker. You'll be freed of this terrible burden Christians call hell.  But pray first.|`|G2yuxzXBaa	that's it in a nutshell
AA11047076	What we believe in is euphemistically called "The World to Come". Not much is taught on it (at least not in open sources.) It is not a world as we know it, nor are there beautiful gardens and winged angels playing harps with golden halos around their heads. At the same time- their is no fire and brimstone or eternal damnation and burning in the fires of hell...<br>  <br>  The world to come is a spiritual realm- souls try to cluster around the pure essence of God, to close to the holy for the sake of being near it- because souls yearn to be as close to God as possible. but it is not as simple as that either. The world to come is not a simplistic realm of one level- in the Talmud, Masechta Chagigah, it is said that the outer courtyards to God's abode has seven levels - each of ascending holiness, each soul wanting to be as high as possible. It briefly states that beyond these levels you have the inner courtyard and abode itself- but stops there with the statement "Beyond here we do not enquire". Maybe it elaborates further in the Kaballah- I have no idea on that.<br>  <br>  Hell is completely absent from Judaism. There is no devil in Judaism as it is not possible for an angel to rebel (only humans have free will- angels can only perform specific tasks). What is generally misinterpreted as hell is the concept of Sheol or Gehinnom. This refers to the burning the soul feels at the heavenly trial after death.<br>  <br>  Essentially, we are brought to the heavenly court (God) and judged. Satan (literally the accusser) is the prosecutor and wants to introduce all our sins into the equation. God is merciful, and drops some of the sins before the trial begins (Rambam, Hilchos Teshuvah). After that, the soul basically watches two movies- one is- what your life was- the other, what your life could have been. The soul feels shame at the lost opportunities, at what it could have been vs what it is. It is this shame that feels like an eternity of burning. The burning is not a literal one- it is the burning of shame that it feels at realising how it has transgressed, when it could have been so much more! Think of how, for us with physical bodies, the shame of being shouted at by a parent/teacher/ boss can feel like burning- how much worse for a soul which is a pure being and has no physical imperfections or mental imperfections to give it excuses! But though it states that this "burning" feels like an eternity- it truth, it never lasts for more than 12 months. God is much too loving to give out eternal punishments, just as a loving parent would never punish a child for forever.<br>  <br>  Does this process differ between Jews/non-Jews? Nope- it is exactly the same except Jews (all of them- even apostates that converted to other religions) are judged by the law in the Torah and everyone else by the Seven Noachide laws.<br>  <br>  What happens to particularly evil people? Here we are moving into the territory of those who are punished with kares (spiritual excission). In its most simplistic understanding this means the soul is eternally cut-off from God, unable to enter into the world to come. But what that means is debated with two main answers:<br>  1) The soul dissipates and is destroyed<br>  2) It is forever outside, looking in and regretting its decisions in life.<br>  <br>  Number 2 is the one that has the most support in the Talmud. there is a story of Onkelos, a nephew of Titus and sorceror who summons the souls of three enemies of the Jews to discuss their fates. If they were still around to be summonsed, then they could not have dissipated- ergo number 2 would be correct.. As a side note to this incident, Onkelos repented, converted and became one of the major commentators on the Torah!<br>  <br>  Of course, this is even further complicated by the Jewish view of the soul. In its most simplistic form (yes, it can get a LOT more complicated!) the soul is seen as containing three divisions: 1) the animating spirit which is tied to the physical and dies with the body 2) The "You" part, the intellect etc which is the linkage between the holy and the spiritual and 3) the Holy spark, that bit of God that is within all of us.<br>  <br>  Now the purpose of life is to elevate the holy spark, to bring it even closer to God through the "You" part performing positive deeds and moving towards spirituality and away form the animalistic. As such, it is this part which is judged and has the reward/punishment applied to it. Even if the soul is punished with kares, this would only apply to the "You" part, and not to the holy part.|`|AA11992885	Jews believe in a heaven.......but the concept of heaven is different then that of Christianity<br>  <br>  Jews believe human souls go to a place called Gan-Eden, it is spiritual paradise, which is what many might call heaven..........though in Judahism, heaven is the place of angels ONLY, it is not for the souls of men<br>  <br>  hell is another sticky subject............Judahism does NOT have a hell, i.e. a place of eternal torture............Judahism has a place called Gehinnom which is a place of spiritual purification...........it is the place the soul goes after death to be purified<br>  <br>  a COMPLETELY righteous person who has no sin at all, completely bypasses Gehinnom since there is no purifying needed<br>  <br>  with others, purification can take anywhere from a day to a year, but no more then a year.............in scripture, all judgments are passed in a years time, so the longest a person can be in Gehinnom for purification is 12 months, roughly<br>  <br>  a COMPLETELY wicked person, who is still not purified after the full year, the soul is ultimately destroyed<br>  <br>  after purification, the soul moves on to Gan-Eden...........in other words, we all end up in the same place<br>  <br>  so, Judahism does have a concept of reward and punishment, though we call things a bit differently then christians do<br>  <br>  Heaven verse Gan-Eden, though we do believe there is a Heaven<br>  hell verse Gehinnom, though we do NOT believe there to be eternal torture|`|8I9uduIiaa	Please don't apologise - it's a perfectly good question and NOT remotely 'ignorant' :)<br>  <br>  We don't believe in 'hell' at all. The nearest we get to it is a form of purgatory, where the soul resides for 'purification' for up to one year.<br>  <br>  We believe in heaven, or 'gan eden' - 'garden of eden'. We believe that ALL righteous souls will get there. We are ALL equally G-d's children and the vital thing is to lead a moral and meaningful life, here on earth. This is what matters - not which religion a person belongs to.<br>  <br>  Just to clarify: the first answerer is wrong.

The gospel was to be proclaimed by the Church, and received by all the people of the earth, accompanied by all the teachings of Jesus Christ.    The Catholic Church has been proclaiming the gospel in word and deed through authentic preaching and teaching since the very beginning. Long before the Bible ever existed.    That's way better than any book ... even a holy book ... can do.

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	Excellent question.  Like most topics, you can find Biblical evidence to support either side if you look hard enough.  Shakespeare once wrote, the devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.    It is true that there are many Bible passages (especially in the OT) that support capital punishment, often for relatively mild offenses:    - Adultery (Leviticus 20:10)  - Blasphemy (Leviticus 24:16)  - Breaking the Sabbath (Exodus 31:14 & 15)  - Disobedient children (Exodus 21:15 & 17; Leviticus 20:9)  - Homosexuality (Leviticus 20:13)  - Not being a virgin on your wedding night (but only if you're a woman - Deuteronomy 22:20-21)    Some people cite Romans 13:1-7, which states that all governments are sanctioned by God, and if the government dictates something (like capital punishment), then it is Gods will [this passage could also be used to justify abortion]. I have yet to see a coherent reconciliation of this passage with governments like Hitlers Germany, or Stalins Russia, or Pol Pots Cambodia, or any of the hundreds of others that were responsible for horrible atrocities throughout history. Governments are run by people, who are  inherently  imperfect. This is why the U.S. has a system of checks and balances, and why our laws are constantly changing (remember, there was a time when slavery was legal, when women couldnt vote, when there were no child labor laws, etc.). This argument simply does not fly.    The New Testament (starring Jesus) is primarily ANTI-death penalty. For example, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus praises mercy (Matthew 5:7) and rejects an eye for an eye (Matthew 5:38-39). James 4:12 says that GOD is the only one who can take a life in the name of justice. Romans 12:17-21 guides us not to answer evil with evil, because God will have the final word.  In John 8:7, Jesus says, "let he who is without sin cast the first stone."    There are many, many practical problems with capital punishment (that I won't get into here), but purely from a moral standpoint, it is pretty clear that Jesus did not support it. True Christians shouldn't, either.|`|XEBpv9gwaa	As a code for Christians, sure.  To influence a law all will be under, no.    However, I think there are plenty of non religious reasons to end the death penalty.|`|vNvtwuBfaa	The "no more eye for an eye issue" is to deal with personal quibbles under theocratic law.    There are different rules for Christians to follow.    the 1st is those that are given for how to conduct your self as a member of the church, as centralized around 1 Tim. 3:15.    Then there's the whole secular government issue witch is given in Romans 13:1-7.    "No more eye for an eye" is given in Matt. 5:38, and like I said above that's for minor personal quibbles.  For in the same context, just before that passage, Jesus says:    Matthew 5:21-22 (KJV)   21 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:   22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.     "The Judgment" in that passage is the council that would enact the Old Testament Death penalty for killing (Ex. 21:12; and before the law in Genesis 9:6 - after Cain).  In the old testament, the death penalty was for killing someone.  Jesus is making it more stringent and he's saying that the death penalty will be extended to those who are merely "angry with their brother without a cause."     It's always important to get the whole mind of scripture on these issues and not let our emotions, feelings, and opinions get the best of us.    So if I live in a secular government that exercises the death penalty, I support it 100%.|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	Too bad that won't work, this is a Secular nation.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	Easily.

Some how you could include, forgiveness or how we shouldn't personally judge others.        Edit: The whole Cain thing. God took pity on him, but the B9ible never says that He was forgiven. God knows whats best, I don't think we should be telling Him what to do. :)

I understand that I may hear the same "new" idea many times, but that only at certain times am I open to that idea.    For example, I hadn't heard of the notion of brain plasticity.  But my source, a very intelligent trust-worthy psychologist, explained the idea, it's background, how it can be put into practice, and now I believe it.    It is harder, though, to stop doing what is bad for me.  For example, many people had told me to drink water when I exercised, but I was seldom thirsty - I didn't like to drink.    Then, one day I got a cramp, and a personal trainer said, "Cramps can be caused by dehydration."  Suddenly I saw the light, and now I force myself to drink a lot of water before, during and after exercising.  So, I gave up my belief that I only  needed to drink when I was thirsty, but it took years of people telling me that.    I needed the right context.  I needed the facts laid out in front of me:  1) You have a cramp  2) Cramps can be a symptom of dehydration while excercising  So, I am now operating under this new belief.|`|m73vgcxUaa	You have to keep an open mind but use decrement.

My mom can see auras* and its way cool. and special.  http://www.reiki-for-holistic-health.com... to see what colors mean.   usually when my mom sees an aura the prettier they are the more of a good person she sees in them, like if she sees a blueish purple one then she'll think that theyre scary or not a good person, when theyre color is ulgy she doesnt see the good in them  for my mom she cant control it, she only sees in it certain people sometimes she even sees my cats auras.  no my mom is not schizo or crazy shes totally normal and shes learned to live with it and she thinks thats its a gift to have it, you dont need to get better you just need to learn to accept your gift.  im only fifteen and i think she started seeing them when she was 18 and i HOPE that i can see them too, its something that runs in my family too my grandma can interpret dreams.(i dont know too much about spirits)    i hope that you learn to accept your gift, and be happy that you have it|`|0i4sNq2waa	*Aura.

Before you get too excited by this a few things to set straight : You are not pshycic, you are not seeing auras, there is no such thing as spirits. And no - you are not crazy.    From your description it sounds like you have a form of 'Synesthesia'. This is rare but very normal and there is nothing supernatural or mystical about it, it just means that your brain works a little different from other people.     The following link gives a good description to what Synesthesia is and what it is all about.     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia    I recommend you talk to your parents about this and consult a specialist. As I have said there is nothing wrong with you, but something like this can naturally freak many people out, especially as it often only manifests itself when children reach puperty, so it is a good idea to speak to someone who can help you put things into a proper perspective before you start believing all the supernatural, superstitious nonsense that is often associated with the condition.     Most of all relax - you are not crazy, you are special. Many Synesthesists go on to become incredibly gifted in various key fields such as Music, or Mathematics where their abilities help them to see patterns others cannot see.|`|Kfv2UP6Aaa	YOU'RE A WIZARD, HARRY|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	Pray to God and ask him if these gifts are from him to help you and if they are not from him to take them away.

I'm sure this is a good power. ;) Maybe you could do this type of thing for a living or maybe at the most save a person from something if you can change the future possibly.

Why answer if you don't believe or know? ANYWAY, you get better by practicing.  Control comes with time-try to "shut" it off, then relax and "turn it on".  Don't be scared, and don't think you're alone-you aren't.  Do some searches on the internet and you'll learn alot.  The colors, here's what they mean (sorry it's so long)-there's more info. on the website below, including dominating colors and "flashes".  Here's what the colors mean (and good luck!)      Meaning of Clean Colors of the Aura   (colors of the rainbow, bright, shiny, monochromatic colors):    Purple: indicates spiritual thoughts. Purple is never a strong point in the Aura. It appears only as temporary "clouds" and "flames", indicating truly spiritual thoughts.    Blue: Balanced existence, sustaining life, eased nerve system, transmitting forces and energy. People with blue strong point in their Aura are relaxed, balanced and feel ready to live in a cave and survive. They are born survivors. Blue thought is a thought about relaxing the nerve system to achieve the balance of the mind or a thought about surviving. Electric blue can override any other color in the Aura, when the person is receiving and/or transmitting information in a telepathic communication. For example Michel Desmarquet, author of "Thiaoouba Prophecy", frequently glows with the electric blue during his lectures, especially when he answers questions from the public.    Turquoise: indicates dynamic quality of being, highly energized personality, capable of projection, influencing other people. People with turquoise strong point in their Aura can do many things simultaneously and are good organizers. They feel bored when forced to concentrate on one thing. People love bosses with turquoise Auras, because such bosses explain their goals and influence their team rather than demand executing their commands. Turquoise thought is a thought about organizing and influencing others.    Green: restful, modifying energy, natural healing ability. All natural healers should have it. People with a green strong point in their Auras are natural healers. The stronger the green Aura, the better the healer. They also love gardening and usually have a "green hand" - anything grows for them. Being in a presence of a person with a strong and green Aura is a very peaceful and restful experience. Green thought indicates a restful state and healing.    Yellow: joy, freedom, non-attachment, freeing or releasing vital forces. People who glow yellow are full of inner joy, very generous and not attached to anything. Yellow halo around the head: high spiritual development. A signature of a spiritual teacher. Do not accept spiritual teachings from anyone who does not have such a yellow halo. Buddha and Christ had yellow halos extending to their arms. Today it is rare on Earth to find a person with a halo larger than 1 inch. Yellow halo appears as a result of a highly active brow chakra (which can be seen glowing with violet by many people at my workshops). Highly spiritual people stimulate the brow chakra continuously for many years, because they always have intensive spiritual thoughts in their minds. When this chakra is observed when highly active, a yellow (Auric pair) halo appears around it, surrounding the entire head. Yellow thought indicates a moment of joy and contentment.    Orange: uplifting and absorbing. Inspiring. A sign of power. Ability and/or desire to control people. When orange becomes a strong point, it usually contributes to a yellow halo, which then becomes gold, indicating not only a spiritual teacher, but a powerful spiritual teacher, someone capable of demonstrating his/her unique abilities. Orange thought is a thought about exercising power or a desire to control people.    Red: materialistic thoughts, thoughts about the physical body. Predominantly red Aura indicates materialistically oriented person.    Pink (=purple+red): love (in a spiritual sense). To obtain a clean pink, you need to mix the purple (the highest frequency we perceive) with red (the lowest frequency). Pink Aura indicates that the person achieved a perfect balance between spiritual awareness and the material existence. The most advanced people have not only a yellow halo around the head (a permanent strong point in the Aura) but also a large pink Aura extending further away. The pink color in the Aura is quite rare on Earth and appears only as a temporary thought, never as a strong point in the Aura.    Meaning of Dirty colors:   (colors appearing darker than background more like a smoke than a glow)    Brown: unsettling, distracting, materialistic, negating spirituality.    Gray: dark thoughts, depressing thoughts, unclear intentions, presence of a dark side of personality.    Sulfur (color of a mustard): pain or lack of ease, anger    White: serious disease, artificial stimulation (drugs). Why does the white color in the Aura indicate problems? White color is like a noise, ra

49de24d27a14cb66109a71fd1357be1baa	They should. After all, in theory, wouldn't God be classified as a ghost?  By the way, I'm an atheist.|`|94618fa9aff7c44a9bbefcc52d8a7de7aa	Yes we do, there is the "Holy Ghost" and that is the only one to be trusted.   There are other ghosts but we know they are of evil intent and the source for these phenomenons are evil. They will lurk in the shadows and give an impression of helplessness and kindness but then deceit really is mastered in their hands.  These ghosts are fallen angels still here on earth by God's allowance and they will be sent to the pit of hell along with the current ruler, Satan.  As for suicidal people? I personally think that they go nowhere, they end up in a grey limbo forever. I don't believe they are heaven bound because they have committed themselves to suicide which is basically a strong message to God. "here take it back I don't like the gift of life you gave me, it's worthless". That isn't exactly what our God would want from us.|`|3m00lxxuaa	I do believe in the paranormal. I can't yet give a good answer on which events that are ghostly are actually contributed God, but all things need to be tested by scripture, and haven't yet found reason to not  say that most images or events like that are deceiving, out of the ones that aren't hoaxes(made up) that is. Any truly born again Christian with Christ in their life can't commit suicide, at least without such a strong conviction not to at first. I know a man(Christian) who tried to once because of certain circumstances, and was stopped in his tracks.|`|Kfv2UP6Aaa	They believe in zombies. Might as well..|`|XEBpv9gwaa	I don't believe in ghosts.  I believe the soul goes to God upon the death of the body.      I absolutely believe that people who have committed suicide also go to God.

God judges righteously, he knows ones heart, he knows their pain.  Pray for them...    ?|`|TwfyliKiaa	I think ghost may be a lying spirit(demon). any trick to confuse us. Yes you can go to heaven if you committed suicide. The law was given to show us we needed to be saved ,so we all sin. Do we believe that Jesus is who He said He is? that He did what He did for us.

I don't believe in ghosts, but I do believe that what you all think as a ghost is really a demon.|`|d7FP0VmDaa	CHRISTIANS DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS !!!!!!!!  Then of course they (like their bible) immediately contradict themselves and say they they believe in the holy ghost.|`|IMKApyRDaa	Ghosts are familiar spirits. They are called familiar spirits because they are familiar with people who may have passed on and impersonate these people. They try to make people think they are communicating with dead relatives when in fact they are communicating with demon spirits. King Saul tried to communicate with Samuel who was dead. He went to a medium or someone with a familiar spirit. This was forbidden in Jewish law and Saul knew it. Ghosts are demons not departed human spirits. As far as suicide is concerned the person may not be responsible for their actions because of mental illness. I don't think someone can make a blanket statement that all people who commit suicide go to hell. You don't know someones heart when they do such a thing. It is an incredible, cruel tragedy. I knew someone who was very impulsive and she took an overdose of anti-seizure medication because she was so angry at her dad. When she realized she could die she told someone who called the paramedics and she got her stomach pumped out. She later explained she had no intention of suicide but was so mad she took the medication because it ran through her mind to do so. Was it stupid? Yes. Was it a suicide attempt? No. You really don't know what goes through a person's mind when they do some of the things they do. Some people have brain damage that causes them to do tragic things. Jesus is merciful and knows all things. He only can judge rightly.|`|z6fF9Fsoaa	I don't think Christians believe in ghosts, but i do think they believe in spirits. And I think it all rests in God's hands with the suicide part. The best thing to do would just be to pray for the person.|`|Kc9ZMATCaa	-The belief of ghosts isn't normally effected by religions as far as I know.  -Common Christian belief is that people who commit suicide go to hell.|`|421b093f3a26e984609f4230f395d7d9aa	Hi!  I'm Catholic and yes I believe in ghosts.  I've encountered one. In the Bible there is a passage that states that "some are made to roam the earth..."  Some are demon activity and some are souls that are in need of prayer, so I pray for souls in trouble. We believe that when a soul stands to be judged after death, God allows one to to go to heaven or hell. If they may go to heaven they must be purified of their earthly attachments. God purifies their sin with his death( as Jesus) and in his blood.  Attachments are completely a different matter. That is something us humans can't understand because we have a limit to our intelligence. The rest we leave to God.  We believe he works that out in his time.  We call that purgatory.  It could be from his glance or more.  One second to God is not what our seconds are. We cannot enter heaven until completely reaching perfection by him. Suicidal victims have God's mercy.  If the suicide was of a completely obstinate person the doesn't believe that he can help that person's life get any better or are in complete despair and won't get help--then usually that is the "sin against the Holy Spirit" (and "Thou shall not kill") and can't be forgiven as stated in the Bible. But, it all comes down to the heart of that person and God.  We have no right to judge another, no matter what. Only God knows how to work these things out. God is made of love and doesn't dwell on the bad.  He looks at the love we give before sin. "Love covers a multitude of sin"  the Bible says.  Keep on making others content and do good things.  God bless!|`|knKWRi5caa	Well, I'm Baptist, and we believe that all living beings have souls, and we also believe in the Father(GOD), the Son(Jesus) and Holy ghost. So yeah we do believe in ghosts in a way. Because we believe that only your soul (your spirit) goes to Heaven and your body is left behind on Earth. Ghosts(your spirit) don't go to Heaven soon after death because God said that  your spirit stays with your body in the grave until the Second Coming of Christ(Which is Armageddon) As for people who commit suicide they are doomed to go to Hell because that is the Ultimate sin, because you can't repent (or ask forgiveness) for that sin. Baptist don't believe in purgatory though.(the place between Heaven and Hell.)
Iva8drdfaa	Corn is the English word for Grain.    And grain exists in the Middle East.        All grains, grow on stalks, like Wheat, and Barley.  And are referred to as ears.

cEFiOrX5aa	Those who say God (and Jesus) do not exist provide far less evidence than those who believe he did (and still does) and always has. As one former atheist wrote, "I was an atheist at one time. And like most atheists, the issue of people believing in God bothered me greatly. What is it about atheists that we would spend so much time, attention, and energy refuting something that we don't believe even exists?! What causes us to do that? When I was an atheist, I attributed my intentions as caring for those poor, delusional people...to help them realize their hope was completely ill-founded. To be honest, I also had another motive. As I challenged those who believed in God, I was deeply curious to see if they could convince me otherwise. Part of my quest was to become free from the question of God. If I could conclusively prove to believers that they were wrong, then the issue is off the table, and I would be free to go about my life. I didn't realize that the reason the topic of God weighed so heavily on my mind, was because God was pressing the issue. I have come to find out that God wants to be known. He created us with the intention that we would know him. He has surrounded us with evidence of himself and he keeps the question of his existence squarely before us. It was as if I couldn't escape thinking about the possibility of God. In fact, the day I chose to acknowledge God's existence, my prayer began with, "Ok, you win..." It might be that the underlying reason atheists are bothered by people believing in God is because God is actively pursuing them......"      So for some of them, it's just their personalities. They are disturbed that the believers and faithful in society can do so without the kinds of solid proof they need in order to do the same thing. It's beyond their ability to comprehend God (which is normal), so rather than explore it and come to believe it on their own time and terms, they just choose to shoot the idea down altogether.    *The argument of evolution is a waste of time to me. Sure, we can sit here all day arguing about our ape-like qualities or the fact they they have human-like qualities, but that means nothing. Some pig organs have been used in human surgeries, does that mean we evolved from pigs too? No, it doesn't. And if we evolved from apes, why haven't ALL apes evolved then? See what I mean? It's full of holes.*|`|95c2929336859361a8f5aac01e713a06aa	One cannot prove a negative (a lack there of) but can prove a positive. If God existed, there would be some kind of irrefutable proof.

Did you ever wonder why the Romans did not leave any evidence of Jesus' death? Do you think when government officials do something bad they cover it up.

How can you even QUESTION the existence of Odin when most of Europe worshiped Him and His son, Thor? Odin predates Christ! How can you think such blasphemous thoughts as to deny the divinity of Thor, son of Odin?    Why cant you just accept Odin in to your heart? A personal relationship with Odin just makes you feel GOOD    Why take the chance that Odin isnt real and just convert to bask in His glory?     Why take the chance that you will burn forever in Hel, or worse, Niflhel? Dont you WANT to go to Valhalla?     By not worshiping Odin, even though you are aware of Odin, you are committing a sin And though I dont hate the sinner, I hate the sin and must label you as evil.     As a sinner, I feel it is my obligation to inform you that you will be punished in Hel the dreary subterranean abode ruled by its eponymous blue and black giantess Hel, or worse, Niflhel, the deeper level beneath Hel, and those who break oaths, abduct and rape women, and other vile things will be sent there to be among their kind to suffer harsh punishments, for denying Him that is the God of Gods.    Again, why even take the chance? Do you WANT to find yourself in Hel?    It is just so ignorant to think that Odin doesnt exist because who else could have CREATED ALL THIS? The world is so complicated and scary Odin HAS to have created everything because it couldnt just have created itself, right?    You people just dont understand because you havent accepted Odin in to your heart.

The thing is, you cannot prove or disprove something and to me it makes more sense that the universe had someone outside of time-space kickstart it. There are lots of scientists who believe in a god.     I actually think a lot of it has to do with different religions' views of God that put people off. Even with the Enlightenment and the rise of reason and logic people still believed in a God, they just didn't believe that he was the same as what Christianity, Islam and other religions said.

Atheist lash out at this anti-reasoning which blinds them to all the good people who believe, people who have been enriched by their beliefs.       Christians always approach Atheists with moral arguments: guilt, love, good, evil, etc. but they get so wrapped up in THE Truth that they can sometimes justify unreasonable thoughts because they must them fit into the pre-conceived view of reality.   They often can't see someone as truly good unless they believe in some form of God, and one must be evil to not believe in God at all.  Why would someone hate god who is love?           This is where the divide comes in. The fence where the infested screams of believers and non-believers can be heard:  "You're all mind and no heart, you must be evil"  "You're stupid for not analyzing this rationally, you must be crazy", they say respectively    The middle ground to be found is sweet green soft and sound.  A world where atheists can understand the good that is done through people believing in God, and where theists can see that the preachers and writers of God's words are human, inclined to greed and selfishness and not above abusing God's word for their benefit.  And i should hope for a world where a believer can accept that his belief is one of many and, though the others may not be right for his walk, the others can benefit in the same way.|`|n1eXQr5oaa	are you saying that what is in your heart (which is blood and muscles) is more important than cold-hard evidence... lol... no wonder the human race is f*cked|`|a8kAassWaa	People claim to not believe in God because it is not scientific or because there is no proof. The true reason is that once people admit that there is a God, they also must realize that they are responsible to God and in need of forgiveness from God (Romans 3:23; 6:23). If God exists, then we are accountable for our actions to Him. If God does not exist, then we can do whatever we want without having to worry about God judging us. I believe that is why evolution is so strongly clung to by many in our society - to give people an alternative to believing in a Creator God. God exists and ultimately everyone knows that He exists. The very fact that some attempt so aggressively to disprove His existence is in fact an argument for His existence.|`|nx5xMGzlaa	There is no proof of sky fairies and plenty to the contrary is why .|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	real focus is not the same as imagined or deluded superstitious focus.|`|5fKnal6Haa	There r two proofs of there is God.

When God created us he decided to put us in heaven. He created the first 2 people: Hazrat Adam (AM) and Bibi Hawa (Adam's wife). Then he told them that they can go and visit Earth and he told them that they r allowed to eat any food there EXCEPT only one fruit.

When I was 12 I started considering what I was being taught and the more I thought about it, the more unlikely it seemed that the Catholic dogma was the truth. That led to questioning spirituality as a whole, and creation and all that.     It seems more likely to me that a long time ago, people made things up because they didn't have the answers, than a superior, benevolent being created the world. I feel sorry that people sometimes need religion for strength, and can't find that strength simply in themselves.    I don't really believe in any sort of conventional god or afterlife or soul, but I do believe that any of it is entirely possible. Right now, I'm just comfortable not knowing, but still like to speculate and learn.
fxHEZGcCaa	Greetings,    No, what we did in the past is irrelevant once we learn what is correct and act on it. Notice this is explicitly stated in the Scriptures:    Acts 17:30,31: God has overlooked the times when people did not know him, but now he commands all of them everywhere to turn away from their evil ways.   For he has fixed a day in which he will judge the whole world with justice by means of a man he has chosen. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising that man from death!"    The important thing is for us to come to an accurate knowledge of the true God and the one He sent forth Jesus Christ (Jn.17:3). Once we learn what God requires we must repent or turn around and do what is right (Jas.1:22-25; 2:17,26).    On of the things we learn when we read the Bible is that no Christians would ever participate in war (2 Cor.  10:3,4;  Mat 5:43-47; Lk. 6:27-28, 32-36).  Jn.13:34,35 says you would identify true Christians by the love they show.     Another point is that the punishment for sin is not a burning hell but just death which is defined in the Bible as a return to the dust and an unconscious state (Gen.3:19; Eccl.3:20; 9:5,10; Ps.6:5; 115:17; 146:4; Isa.38:18,19; 63:16; Job 14:21; Ezek.18:4; etc.).     The bible clearly shows that everyone, good and bad, go to the same place; "Hell" (HADES/SHEOL) (Job 14:13; Gen.37:35; Ps.16:10; Acts 2:27, 31). This fact is hidden in many translations like the KJV which translate SHEOL 31 times as "grave" and 31 times as "hell" due to theological bias.    The Word of God also explicitly says that those in HADES (hell) will come out in the resurrection and that Hell is not eternal (Rev.20:13,14; 21:4; Ac.24:15).    So, again we should not be overly concerned with what we or someone did in the past, but rather do all we can to become true Christians right now.    Isaiah 1:18-19 says:  Come, now, you people, and let us set matters straight between us, says Jehovah. Though the sins of you people should prove to be as scarlet, they will be made white just like snow; though they should be red like crimson cloth, they will become even like wool. 19 If you people show willingness and do listen, the good of the land you will eat.    Hope this helps,    Ron Rhoades|`|yMqWvG8naa	Nope.  Hell is imaginary.|`|NsLtN7oLaa	In my religion the only time killing is OK is in  self-defense. Not in the "defense of your country"  unless the enemy poses a genuine risk. The  problem with Viet Nam, and many other wars  we have fought in the last 50 years, is that the  enemy posed no real risk to America. Our men  were sent into an unnecessary war on the orders  of a psycho leader for reasons of ego and profit.    Your dad will not go to hell but he should admit  that the war was wrong and talk kids today out  of enlisting until such time as our leaders act in  a proper and moral way.     My dad was in Korea and for a long time he wanted  to regard himself as a hero and not face the truth,  but he finally realized that he was no hero, he was   a fool, who followed orders to kill from a bunch of  fat cats who sat home and watched the action   like it was a football game.    By teaching others not to allow themselves to be  used like that, he has done a lot to correct the   mistakes he made as a young man.    Jean|`|Gb1bVKBCaa	If you believe in Hell and everything the Bible says, then yes. I do apologise, but that does count as killing, and according to the bible, killing is bad in the eyes of God.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	No your dad was serving his country & helping to prevent Evil from spreading  & he was doing Gods' plan for him so don't worry OK God bless you & your family & be proud of him always|`|Zzhgpe0Paa	There is only one way to miss out on heaven and that is to deny God's gift of salvation through His son Jesus. If your dad trusts in Jesus and only Jesus to save him and has confessed his sins to Him, then he is saved. Not only is he saved, but both God and Jesus promise never to lose him. The bible says that once you're saved the Holy Spirit is sealed within you as security for your inheritance, which is co-heir to the throne of Jesus. Nothing and no one can take that away.|`|zsZGepwLaa	If you read the Bible there is one passage that stated;  "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's,  Render unto God the things that are God's."  When killing in Vietnam Your father was rendering unto Caesar.

I was there also  One other thing, Tell your father that you love him,thank him for his service and always be proud of him. and brag him up to your friends.|`|ckIQfT2saa	no you do not go to hell for killing someone while protecting your country|`|8VEEihaqaa	I personally don't think he's going to Hell, I like to think God is more logical than that.    But since you're religious, and worried about this, I suggest repentance.  Just ask forgiveness, and if your father is truly sorry for the killings (which I assume he is otherwise he wouldn't have such a loving daughter worrying about him), he should be forgiven.|`|RspbqyzDaa	Of course not. God gives people the right to defend themselves. The only people that are going to hell are the ones that don't believe in Jesus.|`|m73vgcxUaa	The only thing that matters is if he has excepted Jesus as his savior and believes in God.

It is not wrong to kill in either self defense or for the defense of ones country. If he killed at war in defense of his country, then it is not wrong. He is a man of honor

IMKApyRDaa	Everyone asks that question. I know that I thought I was unique, I didn't fit in, was different than everyone else. This in fact is true but for a different reason than I expected. Life can have long uneventful periods of time  There are life changing events that are inevitable but there may be long periods of time between these events. During these "boring" times it seems like we are on life's shelf. These times particularly plague me when I withdraw from others. God does have plans for us but they always involve others. Because these plans involve other people there is always conflict and a need to grow as a person to overcome. I never grow when I withdraw. I am talking about prolonged withdrawal. Everyone needs a little alone time. God put a unique spirit in each of us even though we may have found out that we were a "mistake" by our parents or worse. God wants us to know Him through Jesus Christ. He wants us to love Him as an act of our will. This is a learning and mistake making process. This lasts our whole lives. Unfortunately there is some "shelf time" for most. These times are tough because we can't see any reason for us to be here. We feel useless. The only way I have found to combat uselessness is to do something for someone else. You really need to get involved with other people.

In other words, Satan questioned the unified nature of the function of God's attributes.        * Man was created with dominion over a portion of God's creation, i.e. the earth (Ge 1:28-30)        * Man was provided with a test of his volition (Ge 2:16-17)        * Man chose against God's command (Ge 3:6-7)        * As a result of sin, man lost his eternal life and nature was cursed with his fall (Ge 3)        * Man also lost dominion of the earth and Satan gained dominion over the earth and became its ruler (Ge 3 cf. Matt 4:8-9)        * God has demonstrated and is demonstrating the unity of His attributes (e.g. love, justice, righteousness, etc.) in human history        * He provided the promise of a Savior and fulfilled that promise   through His Own Son, i.e. Jesus Christ, the promised seed and Messiah (Ge 3:15; Deut 18:15; 2 Sam 7:12-13; Jn 3:16; Acts 2:34-36)        * God was motivated by His love to make this provision (Jn 3:16)        * God's righteousness required payment for sin (Ge 3:21 cf. 1 Jn 2:2)        * What God's righteousness demanded, God's justice executed (Rom 3:26)        * A God of love can sentence creatures who violate His righteous standards to an eternal punishment without violating the integrity of His attributes        * A righteous God is vindicated by a lower creature (man) accepting His grace provisions since Satan (the higher creature) failed           The ramifications of this truth in terms of personal application are manifold.      Just remember...Jesus had to suffer by taking all of the sins of the world upon Himself, became separated from God and was cruelly beaten and crucified for our sins.    If He was willing to do all of this for us, something that we in no way deserved....then we must be willing to suffer for Him also. Jesus will return when God tells Him it is time to do so.    Just remember....remain steadfast until the end...Jesus loves you....He will return to get us....pray to Him as often as you can...this will help you.    I pray that God will settle your spirit......peace be with you!    with love..."D"|`|szeFBYDmaa	Well now. Approximately 26 years ago your Mummy and Daddy were deeply in love.

nkmwGAKjaa	My grandparents lived with us while I was growing up so I am well versed in bowel problems. Now that I am a senior, I have made it a point not to discuss that function. lol|`|ku2tP4eEaa	How clever you are to be so considerate of the future and the children you don't and may never have.  As of yet lower tract aliments are seldom spoken about with my peers and I am about to be 60+.  <br>  <br>  If every young person were to follow up on their thoughts to be "euthanized" at age 50, there would very few people older than that.  Believe me, you will want to live as long as you can.  Bowel trouble or not.<br>  <br>  Fact is more people, parents are likely to talk about a baby's bowel movements, than seniors would talk about their own.  I have a feeling many a grandparent has shared such conversations.|`|nwnILcEAaa	Think it starts about age 80 or so it seems. Haven't reached that point, yet, but medical issues do become a matter of life and death and regularity becomes more difficult to achieve with age. You may be one of the fortunate few who are never troubled with any of those problems, but try to just concentrate on your bran and ignore those old souls at breakfast time. They speak freely whatever is on their minds.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	It is not a conversation that happens in our home.

1Gm1m30qaa	Rubbish. Besides early Islam was quite liberal towards women e.g it allowed women to divorce, its only now that some crazy Muslims are saying that women should be locked at home.|`|uzczwVT1aa	No of course not, they don't really hold it against us girls :p And its not like they can do much about it anyway lol. Besides that sounds silly, where did you get that from? Muslim men are just like anyone else who adore and fear for their children, they aren't hateful. Salam :)|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	That's silly. It's pretty hard to make boy babies if there are no girl babies to grow up into women. Most men love their children. In the cases of those who don't, it isn't religion's fault.|`|e3vQ4BWaaa	Of course NOT ....    The Muslim men like any other men related to any religion ... all of the people are equal to each other ... In USA u can find a Muslim american besides the non Muslim American ... both of them could be white or black .. etc ...    So , if u mention that Islam gives the chance to the man to hate the girl even she is his daughter ... u r completely wrong in your knowledge ...    Islam honoured the girl ..and the prophet Muhammad orders the all men to be sympathetic with the women ...     When Islam descended on the Arab Land ... people ( the unbelievers) used to barry their daughters alive ...they considered that it was a big shame that the man deliver a girl ...    So Islam prevented any one to kill his daughter ... and who did this he did a sin which must be punished ....    The prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him ) had got 5 daughters, and he loved & respect all of them ... and till now the Muslims respects all of the daughters, wives, grand daughters of him ...     Also their were lots of Muslim women who all the Muslims has been respecting from Muhammad's age till now ... because the woman is respected in Islam ....    Also all the Muslims respect many women who their stories has been written in The Holly Qur'an such as The Virgin Mary , The Pharaoh's Wife, The Queen of Sheba, Aisha ( the wife of Muhammad) ...etc...|`|4RLYdvZ9aa	They do not hate their daughters, but due to islam they will not give them the same rights as they give their sons. Most muslims like Ramz above cannot distinguish between respect for women and giving them equal rights.

Basically what has happened is that superstitious Catholics have turned Mary into a modern day Greek goddess.|`|dmTVbpcWaa	I Don't know- but this I found fascinating in an article by the Catholic Encyclopedia: The way in which some people treated their holy icons [images] argues more than the merely relative Honor that Catholics are taught to observe toward them. .?.?. Icons were crowned with garlands, incensed, kissed. Lamps burned before them, hymns were sung in their honor. They were applied to sick persons by contact, set in the path of a fire or flood to stop it by a sort of magic.Vol. VII, page 668  According to a special dispatch to the Providence Sunday Journal, December 24, 1950, back in 1928 the angry villagers of Mascali left the statue of their patron saint, St.?Leonard, to burn in the onrushing lava because it had failed to stop the flow of the volcano. The same dispatch credited St.?Andrew with stopping the flow of lava for the villagers of Milo, in 1950. In 1944 Italian peasants placed their images in the path of the flowing lava from Mount Vesuvius in a vain attempt to stop it.  The Catholic Herald, London, December 15, 1950, published a picture showing the inhabitants of Milo carrying a statue of Our Lady right to the edge of the advancing avalanche of lava during a recent eruption of Mt. Etna. But all in vain; the village had to be abandoned.

She is more important than God  and Jesus among Hispanics... i find this disturbing myself... i grew up catholic and saw it first hand. It always made me very uncomfortable.    I was a catholic for 27 years, and i always found myself questioning the whole, "Mother of God, Pray for our sins" deal. I don't think that is correct.  I don't believe she is mentioned any where in the bible as our intercessor, but I don't believe she is totally subtracted from Christianity; She serves as an example of how we should behave as Christians, but she was not our messiah  or anything more significant. Who rose from the dead? Jesus or Mary??    I experienced first hand the obvious mistakes made by the catholic church. At 28 i converted to evangelical, and now i see that as a catholic, i was very much in error. But you can't convince most Catholics of this, they are stubborn and will not read their bibles... instead the will listen to priests, and not question anything that is taught to them in bible study...     Most Catholics will continue to be fake Christians who are happy that they don't have make a deeper connection with God  through scripture. The are stuck in their ways and will continue with their "traditions" and repetitive masses and prayers.... even if the traditions contradict what the bible and God asks of us. For example: i was taught to kiss the feet of a statue in order to receive a blessing from the baby Jesus...  This is obvious idolatry.    Catholics are lazy.|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	Because she is my my spiritual mother (Rev 12:17), among lots and lots of other reasons.  God poured all the grace he possibly could into her from the very moment she existed, then sent angels to guard and protect her all her days.    Give me a moment to walk you through this.    First, you need to understand that when you ask someone for something, you are praying to them.  Until modern developments in American English, pray was to ask.  Even today in England, a faithful Christian might ask a judge, "I PRAY thee MY LORD, that your rule in favor of me and not the plantif."  Keep in mind this person is neither worshiping the judge, nor are they calling them a goddess when they ask/pray of the judge.    Second, it is ok to ask (pray) that another member of the church to pray for you, even if they are not God.  We have one advocate, the man Jesus Christ, but because God lives inside us, we can ask each other to pray for us.      Third, some of us can get different types of prayers answered.     Fourth, we still retain this ability once we are in heaven.  There are no dead people in heaven.  All the people in heaven are praying to God.  They do not lose the gifts of the holy spirit they have been given just because their bodies expire... for now.    So, people in heaven are more alive now than they were on earth.  They are closer to God than we are and make better prayer partners.  Besides, if you want to get to know Jesus better, who better to teach you than his mom.      Keep in mind she is much more than every other human because of the Work of God in her humble, quiet life.      "so shouldn't Mary be ORDINARY?"  - Absolutely.  However, keep in mind that the least and most ordinary on earth is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.      Finally, a little Catholic/Prot humor:    The people of Jericho scoffed at the people of God and claimed that 'Ark' was just an ordinary box.  Later, John Calvin scoffed and claimed that Mary, the Mother of God, was just an ordinary vessel.      Here are a couple of articles:  http://www.phatmass.com/directory/index....  http://www.cin.org/users/james/files/key...  http://www.holyspiritinteractive.net/col...    "is not prayer WORSHIP in some form?"  Not always.  See example above of the Christian 'praying' to the judge he calls 'Lord.'  Simple prayer is just asking, though we can worship as we pray.  The church defines 3 types of praise: dulia, hyper-dulia, and latria.  We give dulia type praise to people when they paint well, when they win races, when they show the love of God to the world.  We giver hyper-dulia to Mary.  However, latria (worship) is given to God alone.  Any latria given to anyone other than God is idolatry.    "I don't doubt that it is okay to ask for someone to pray FOR you but to have someone pray TO you is a whole other thing."  Don't get too wrapped up with the modern american words you are using.  Think of the concepts.  Christianity is 2000 years old, our language is only ~400 years old.  'Prayer' is simply a form of communication.  People may or may not choose to worship in prayer.|`|AA11796124	This is but a fraction of what the Bible has to teach about Mary:    Mary is our Mother and Queen of the New Davidic Kingdom  John 19:26 - Jesus makes Mary the Mother of us all as He dies on the Cross by saying "behold your mother." Jesus did not say "John, behold your mother" because he gave Mary to all of us, his beloved disciples. All the words that Jesus spoke on Cross had a divine purpose. Jesus was not just telling John to take care of his mother.    Rev. 12:17 - this verse proves the meaning of John 19:26. The "woman's" (Mary's) offspring are those who follow Jesus. She is our Mother and we are her offspring in Jesus Christ. The master plan of God's covenant love for us is family. But we cannot be a complete family with the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Christ without the Motherhood of Mary.    John 2:3 - this is a very signifcant verse in Scripture. As our mother, Mary tells all of us to do whatever Jesus tells us. Further, Mary's intercession at the marriage feast in Cana triggers Jesus' ministry and a foreshadowing of the Eucharistic celebration of the Lamb. This celebration unites all believers into one famiy through the marriage of divinity and humanity.     John 2:7 - Jesus allows His mother to intercede for the people on His behalf, and responds to His mother's request by ordering the servants to fill the jars with water.     Psalm 45:9 - the psalmist teaches that the Queen stands at the right hand of God. The role of the Queen is important in God's kingdom. Mary the Queen of heaven is at the right hand of the Son of God.    1 Kings 2:17, 20 - in the Old Testament Davidic kingdom, the King does not refuse his mother. Jesus is the new Davidic King, and He does not refuse the requests of his mother Mary, the Queen.    1 Kings 2:18 - in the Old Testament Davidic kingdom, the Queen intercedes on behalf of the King's followers. She is the Queen Mother (or "Gebirah"). Mary is our eternal Gebirah.    1 Kings 2:19 - in the Old Testament Davidic kingdom the King bows down to his mother and she sits at his right hand. We, as children of the New Covenant, should imitate our King and pay the same homage to Mary our Mother. By honoring Mary, we honor our King, Jesus Christ.    1 Kings 15:13 - the Queen Mother is a powerful position in Israel's royal monarchy. Here the Queen is removed from office. But now, the Davidic kingdom is perfected by Jesus, and our Mother Mary is forever at His right hand.    2 Chron. 22:10 - here Queen Mother Athalia destroys the royal family of Judah after she sees her son, King Ahaziah, dead. The Queen mother plays a significant role in the kingdom.    Neh. 2:6 - the Queen Mother sits beside the King. She is the primary intercessor before the King.|`|RJECt4zFaa	Why are there so many pizza toppings?

Who is the woman in Revelation 12?  John: Dear John Salza, I have a question about Rev. 12:1-2. In scripture catholic website about the blessed virgin mary, you talk about the woman being Mary, but it also symbolizes Israel and the church. In the New American Standard, (which I was reading during adoration!) it refers to Gen 37:9 - Joseph telling this dream to his brothers (you probably already know it), thus symbolizing Israel being the stars and moon. My question is how do you say to a protestant, or a new catholic (such as myself), that it refers to 3 things at once.  Is the main focus on Mary, the church, or Israel? Do you have any more insight about this subject? I look forward to a response.  Thank you very much. God Bless you.    J. Salza: John, thank you for your email.  First, if you are reading the New American Bible, I must advise you that some of the translations and footnote explanations are quite problematic. They are infected with liberal ideology and in many cases are even heretical.  It is truly a shame that the US bishops approved this Bible for publication. You should set it aside and instead use the Douay-Rheims translation, or the RSV-CE.    Regarding Rev. 12, remember that the Apocalypse (or Book of Revelation) is apocalyptic literature unique to the first century.  Thus, it is full of symbolism which has multiple meanings.  Therefore, it is common for one symbol to represent more than one thing.  The woman clothed with the sun is the Virgin Mary, and so the verse should be principally interpreted as such. This is demonstrated by Rev. 12:17, where the devil goes to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who bear testimony to Jesus. This makes Mary the mother of all Christians.    Since Mary is the mother of the Church, we can say that the woman, on a secondary level, represents the Church, which is the New Israel.  This is why John writes about her pangs of travail, which are symbolic for those who are being formed in the Church of Jesus Christ.  So, this literature provides us multiple meanings, but there is generally a principal meaning and a secondary meaning; in this case, the woman is the Blessed Virgin Mary, the same "woman" who God said would crush the head of the serpent in Gen. 3:15.  Because she is such a danger to satan, satan tried to kill her even after the Savior was born (Rev. 12:13).|`|6ec55368aa773b05b3b9440af5f7fc50aa	I feel sorry for them.They get caught up in the fanfare of the ceremonies.An have no relationship with God.They are missing so much.|`|LYnuEdKUaa	I would argue that she is NOT the same as any other person.    The Angel Gabriel grants here the title "full of grace" (and yes, in Greek, it is an actual title).    Her cousin elizabeth calls her "blessed among women".    Mary says "all nations shall call me blessed".    And even Jesus himself refers to her as "woman" - an insult today, but a term of great honor then.    She is only human, but she is most certainly not just like the rest of us.    Furthermore, many of the psalms are directed to the angels.  If we can talk to them, why can't we talk to Mary?  It's not like she's our central focus - far from it.    Edit in - no, prayer is not worship.  It can be, but it is not automatically worship.  If you've ever read or seen anything by Shakespeare, you've heard the phrase "pray thee", as in "pray thee, tell me what you mean".  In that sense, it means only to ask, and it is in that sense that we pray to Mary.  When we pray to Mary, what we are doing is asking - usually for her to pray to God for us.  In exactly the same way, you "pray" to your friends when you ask them to pray for you.|`|itroxygvaa	They should pray to God directly for He is ONLY ONE.  As for Mary the virgin peace be upon her, God have chosen her and purified her and chosen her over the women of the worlds. She used to prostrate to God and bow down to him and she was a righteous servant of God. She trusted in the words of God and she was a great believer.    Jesus the Christ peace and blessings be upon him never said to take him and his mother as two gods with God. He said "Hear O' Israel, God is my lord and your lord, so worship Him". That is what the Noble Quran says about them.    I hope that helps, may God increase us and you in guidance and knowledge, ameen.|`|5JQFCQCkaa	They don't pray to her in that way.

We ask Mary to pray for us becuase we beleive that she has a special place in heaven and is a powerful prayer warrior.     You will find however that the devotion to Mary is not strong in all Catholics.    Let me quote from the Gospel of Luke:  28And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.    and here:      41And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:      42And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.      43And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?   (chapter 1 KJV)    Now here is the famous "Hail Mary" prayer.     Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus, Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen.|`|TSkI7Nktaa	You are correct.  Mary was no different that many of the other jewish Girls in her time. Yet God chose her bare the messaiah. Mary was a  sinner like the rest of us She even said my soul rejoices in God my Savior--what did she need to be saved from? well sin of course!  Many roman catholic are decieved by having this strong attachment to her. More so than Jesus Himself!!  That is Idolatry! some one mentioned cultures Some culture are far more pronounced with there praying to Mary. The woman has been dead for centuries. Jesus is the one who rose from dead. Pray to him!     and as from protestants praying for each other the bible commands us to do so. Jesus lead with the example on this by praying for his disciple in John 17. James tell us to confess to each other and pray for each other that we might be healed!|`|PBpcF8KYaa	Mary was special. She was conceived with no original sin, which makes her different from everyone else in the world.     Catholics don't "pray" to Mary in the same way that they pray to God. They ask Mary to pray for them, in the same way that you might ask your friend to pray for you.     I am a Catholic, and I have a very close relationship with Mary. I look at her as a Mother figure, and she is very important to me.  She mothered the Savior .

Does God care how people worship him and what they teach?    God is a spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth" (John 4:24). Our worship must be spiritual but it must also be according to truth.    Cain and Abel were both offering sacrifices to God, a form of worship in the Old Testament. Abel's was by faith; Cain's was not. (Genesis 3, Hebrews 11:4) Without faith it is impossible to please God (Heb. 11:6). Since faith comes by hearing the word of God (Romans 10:17), and Abel worshiped by faith, it can be concluded that God must have told them what He wanted. They were both worshiping, but Abel worshiped according to truth (God's word). Cain did not and his worship was rejected.    Nadab and Abihu were both worshiping, but they were using a fire that God had not authorized. Even though they were worshiping, it was not pleasing to God and he punished them with their life. (Lev. 10:1-2)    Jesus said of some, In vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrine the commandments of men. They were worshiping, but it was vain, or useless, because they were worshiping according to the commandments of men. It mattered how they were worshiping.    Jesus said he has all authority and the apostles were to teach the things he had commanded them (Matt 28:18-20). If we follow the authority (instructions) of men in our worship, then does Christ have all authority in our lives? Most is not the same as all. Who has the authority in your religion?    Paul wrote that his hearts desire and prayer was for some to be saved. Those he was speaking of had a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. They were ignorant of Gods righteousness and were seeking to establish their own righteousness. They were not worshiping according to truth.    Yes, according to the Bible, it does matter how we worship!     We should be satisfied to worship God in the way His word instructs. We should not add to the word of God, take away from it, or distort it. (Deut. 4:2, Deut 12:32, Prov 30:5-6, Galatians 1:6-9, Rev. 22:18-19, 1 Cor 4:6, 2 John 9, et al)    Like it says in Numbers 22:18, "I could not go beyond the word of the Lord my God to do less or more!" We should be satisfied to worship as God's word has instructed.|`|yeEDahKdaa	Here|`|SUBqk9WQaa	Hi,.................Till we meet at Jesus' feet:)|`|YCvHJ32Gaa	Oriental Orthodox

There are many types of folklore.  Some involve the creation of the world, the activities of magical beings, and the existence of a spirit or being who watches all of us.  We understand that this folklore helps keep a culture together - that they have a function in a society.  So, belief in God is an example of folklore that for many has a useful function.    An atheist, by definition, does not believe that there is actually a magical, supernatural, or overarching god.    However, in my experience, I am not able to distance myself from all magical thoughts.  It seems that the ability to believe in magic is part of what makes human so good at thinking - we can imagine things that MIGHT be as well as things that actually are or will be.    So, I sometimes think that my dog shouldn't be watching me in the bathroom.  I know it's magical thinking, that's it's nonsense, but I can't stop myself.

79d325a9d7089b91075a8438b79efeaeaa	It depends what you are casting it around.  A circle is not about the elements being called, or the circle being drawn in the ground.  It needs to be felt.    If you haven't felt your circles before, then go back and sit in one and feel the borders of it.  When you cast a circle, you draw a line of energy around you, this is the mental circle.  The rest is the physical portion that can be done away with when need be.    Mental circles are great for instant protection when needed.  I need them one occassion as I know some psychic vampires that have few morals.  I protect myself during this time, and prevent feeding.  Sounds weird, I know, but hey it happens!    When you go to cast your mental circle, you can draw the energy from yourself or the universe around you.  If it comes from within, then you can create it by visualising your aura getting an egg like shell on it.  I tend to feel tingly when I do this.  I start my circle's this way, then feed it power from the universe itself in the form of white light.    Works for me, hope this helps.|`|3BXOtPkOaa	A mental magic circle is created with your imagination , with your energy that you can feel but you can't see. As many magic things we use to do, we can't see them but we can feel it. If you don't have experience then you must practice , so you'll be stronger in the future when you need to do a magic circle for spells, or  for protection.

Because smoking restricts blood vessels, it can prevent oxygen and nutrients from getting to the skin  which is why smokers often appear pale and unhealthy. An Italian study also linked smoking to an increased risk of getting a type of skin rash called psoriasis.   Bad breath. Cigarettes leave smokers with a condition called halitosis, or persistent bad breath.   Bad-smelling clothes and hair. The smell of stale smoke tends to linger  not just on people's clothing, but on their hair, furniture, and cars. And it's often hard to get the smell of smoke out.   Reduced athletic performance. People who smoke usually can't compete with nonsmoking peers because the physical effects of smoking (like rapid heartbeat, decreased circulation, and shortness of breath) impair sports performance.   Greater risk of injury and slower healing time. Smoking affects the body's ability to produce collagen, so common sports injuries, such as damage to tendons and ligaments, will heal more slowly in smokers than nonsmokers.   Increased risk of illness. Studies show that smokers get more colds, flu, bronchitis, and pneumonia than nonsmokers. And people with certain health conditions, like asthma, become more sick if they smoke (and often if they're just around people who smoke). Because teens who smoke as a way to manage weight often light up instead of eating, their bodies lack the nutrients they need to grow, develop, and fight off illness properly.   And more...|`|cyRDKRIDaa	I lived with a smoker for 12 years of my life, (not by choice of course,) and now I'm suffering on a 24/7 basis, on three different medications for severe asthma.

Of course I don't think that it is okay for smoking to be legal, it causes -so- many long-term health problems for the people that smoke and the people around them. It's ridiculous that just because cigarettes bring in all this money nobody wants to stop selling them.

AA12340210	Jesus was no more than two thieves crucified by the Romans and Judas was playing his part in the Great White Hoax of Rome because no one could id Christ in the Garden but his own and the Gospels do not say who Judas really kissed since the Christ was not crucified.    Roman Governor, Herod of Galilee, declared Christ innocent (Luke23: 15) making Christ a free man under Roman Power and Authority (Luke 23:20, John19:12)  Three Gospels give evidence that Christ bore no cross and made no physical contact with the trappings of crucifixion. (See Matthew 27:32, Mark 15:21, Luke 23:26)  Three Gospels give evidence that one Simon of Cyrene, who was not the Christ, was made to bear a cross to Golgotha. (See Matthew 27:32-37, Mark 15:21-26, and Luke 23:26-38) and this indicates to us that there were three crosses on the way to Golgotha, none of which Christ carried.  The Gospel of John alone gives evidence that the cross that was borne by Jesus carried the inscription, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS (John 19:16-22).   Two of the four Gospels have given us two crosses out of three with the inscribed name of JESUS. (Matthew 27:37, John 19:19)   Governor Pontius Pilate was the author of the inscription and title of JESUS KING OF THE JEWS and this was therefore the official title of the crucifixion of two thieves by Roman authority. (John 19:19-22)  Zeus the Sky God and Father God speaks in a voice from the Sky at the Baptism of Jesus, my beloved son, while the Holy Spirit descended like a dove. (Matthew 3:17, Mark 1:11, Luke 3:22)  Jesus is described with the features of Zeus the Sky God at the Transfiguration as his face did shine as the Sun, and his raiment as white as the light (See Matthew 17:2),   Jesus is described with the features of Zeus the Sky God at the Transfiguration, And his raiment became shining exceeding white as Snow (See Mark 9:3)   Jesus is described with the features of Zeus the Sky or Weather God at the Transfiguration, And there was a cloud that overshadowed them, (with the unmistakable voice of Zeus) and a voice came out of the cloud saying, this is my beloved son (See Mark 9:7)   Jesus transforms into Zeus the Sky or Weather God at the Transfiguration, his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glistering (See Luke 9:29), and there came a cloud and overshadowed them (Luke 9: 34) and there came a voice out of the cloud (Luke 9:35), and all of this is in a meeting with Elisha (or Eliseus of Luke 4:27).  The name, Jesus, is a combination of Jah and Zeus as The intention of Governor Pontius Pilate to match the false charges made by the Biblical Jews that he made himself a God and a Son of God. Jah is the God of Israel while Zeus is the God of pagan Rome.   The Angel at the tomb is none other than Zeus, with the same features as Jesus (Jezeus) in the Transfiguration; His countenance was like the lightening and his raiment white as snow.

What is the point of reincarnation? Why is more than one life needed?  What is directing the process of the transmigration of souls?

592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	No, masturbation is not okay for women.     The deal isn't just "spilling seed" -- the point of sex is to reflect God's image. So sex is always supposed to be GIVING, not self-indulgent. It is supposed to give pleasure, give unity, give all of oneself and give life. Masturbation is about taking pleasure, taking oneself out of any unity and being alone, taking oneself for oneself and it is not at all life-giving.    Get it?|`|AA11440601	+ Sex +    Judeo-Christian tradition has taught for thousands of years that it is God's will that:  ? Single people should be celibate.  ? Married people should be faithful to each other (adultery is wrong).    The Catholic Church recognizes the power of sex when it teaches, "Sexuality affects all aspects of the human person in the unity of his body and soul."    Chastity means the successful integration of sexuality within the person. A chaste person's body and spirit lives in unity and opposes any behavior that would impair that unity.    The Catholic Church does not have an official stance which types of sex are allowable when a man and woman are married as long as it is consensual and done in moderation.     The purpose of sex is to bring a husband and wife closer and to create human life.     For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 2337 and following: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3s...    + Masturbation +    Masturbation is contrary to the human dignity of the person, anyone about whom the person has lustful thoughts, and the dignity of human sexuality.

They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.<br>  <br>   14 " 'If a man marries both a woman and her mother, it is wicked. Both he and they must be burned in the fire, so that no wickedness will be among you.<br>  <br>   15 " 'If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he must be put to death, and you must kill the animal.<br>  <br>   16 " 'If a woman approaches an animal to have sexual relations with it, kill both the woman and the animal. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.<br>  <br>   17 " 'If a man marries his sister, the daughter of either his father or his mother, and they have sexual relations, it is a disgrace. They must be cut off before the eyes of their people. He has dishonored his sister and will be held responsible.<br>  <br>   18 " 'If a man lies with a woman during her monthly period and has sexual relations with her, he has exposed the source of her flow, and she has also uncovered it.

He told her to go away and seek God’s forgiveness. She persisted four times and admitted she was pregnant. He told her to wait until she had given birth. Then he said that the Muslim community should wait until she had weaned her child. When the day arrived for the child to take solid food, Muhammad handed the child over to the community. And when he had given command over her and she was put in a hole up to her breast, he ordered the people to stone her. Khalid b. al-Walid came forward with a stone which he threw at her head, and when the blood spurted on her face he cursed her.”<br>  <br>  Prophet Muhammad, under Allah’s direction, stoned adulterers to death and flogged fornicators. Allah’s decree/choice of death for fornicators (Quran: 4:15) and flogging adulteress 100 times with no mercy (Quran: 24:2, which also could lead to certain death) has clearly sanctioned/dictated dreadful punishment for sexual intercourse outside marriage.

The only opinion that matters is God's, and Jesus definitely spoke about marriage being a spiritual and emotional union between a man and a woman, ideally helping them to be as close as if they were one being.    Nobody has the right to do whatever he wants, not even God.  Such an attitude is puerile and facile.  We have the ability to pursue our goals and indulge our tastes, but man cannot pretend he's ill used when he ignores the operation of natural and divine laws.    In California, gay couples have just about every right that married couples have.  All they have to do is enter into a domestic partnership.  Leave marriage alone.    Homosexuals have always had the right to marry, the same right as anybody else in this country: the right to marry an unmarried, adult member of the opposite sex.  They just don't want to.  They want to redefine things to suit their tastes.    Well, I'm broke.  I want to redefine withdrawals to include taking money at gunpoint, because I don't want all the bigotry and discrimination and persecution historically associated with bank robbery.|`|T8X7mrtHaa	I am in favor of whatever civil unions consenting human beings wish to enter into.

ptIIkqq0aa	Because of the lack of knowledge people know themselves. People hear things that are not true about the Catholic faith, and they assume what they know about us is true. It seems that many non-Catholics have the idea that we worship Mary, and even though we blatantly say that we only worship God.     Because the Catholic Church is such a large denomination, a lot of people are aware of Catholicism. I will admit that I have never heard of a Coptic Orthodox, but because the name does not contain "Catholic" anywhere in there, people may automatically assume that you are a true Christian, unlike how they may think of us. (That may have been worded wrong- I am in no way taking offense to your religion :] )    It may also be that the United States is a predominantly Protestant country-so in a sense, if you went to Vatican City, or Italy itself, I highly doubt Catholics are going to receive as much hate as we do here.|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	Many say it is because they worship Mary.

This couple bowed on their knees before her and prayed TO her and asked her to bless their marriage!    Who is Mary to bless anyone? Can she hear all prayers like an omnipresent God? Does she have a power to bless?

American evangelical and fundamentalist Christians are, for the most part, uneducated with regard to the Eastern churches.  They all come from the Protestant reformation which was a Western phenomenon, and so their "protesting" is targeted toward the Catholic Church -- and more specifically the Roman.  (It's also very big, and very visible.)  That there are even other rites than the Latin (Roman), let alone Copts, which share many of the same beliefs, doctrines and practices that they claim to "hate" is (again, for the most part) beyond their ken.  If I were you, I'd be grateful that they're clueless.

SF1uPJZhaa	Well, it's the first foreign language they teach at school, so most people will have learned some. The question is just how interested the individual is in it and how much time and practice they invest in becoming fluent. I was always a huge anglophile, for example. <br>  Younger people are more likely to speak some than older ones.<br>  <br>  edit: "Hopefully very little"? If you're referring to the accent, those who are fluent don't have one.

Today's younger generations definitely know a lot of English since it's taught in school as a primary foreign language and some of them might even be fluent in it (especially if it becomes their major at university). Colloquial German is (sadly) starting to be heavily influenced by English now and young Germans tend to think it's ''cool'' to use English words in their speech. <br>  <br>  The belief that ALL Europeans are multilingual is an American-based stereotype. This isn't really true. Europeans are EXPOSED to a lot more languages than we are, which makes learning them easier and a lot of them might have some basic knowledge in 3 or 4 languages, but most Europeans will speak two languages, at best three languages fluently. Those who speak 3, 4 or 5 languages fluently is because that's their field of study, and that also happens here in North America. It is just that their immersion opportunities are a lot better. <br>  <br>  The only European country I know of that has a perfectly multilingual population is Luxemburg. Most people there are trilingual (Luxemburgisch, German and French).|`|w3plOs6uaa	Many of the countries in Europe teach their children multiple languages at an early age. I don’t know the actual percentage, but I would imagine that around 75% can communicate pretty well in English and about 30% of that is fluent in 4 or 5 different languages.

IqwGkk7daa	I'm sorry, you seem really misguided, and really mistaken when it comes to what's said in the Bible. And you seem also to simply be trying to stump the Christians.    Where it says "Love your neighbor as yourself," it doesn't say "no taking your clothes off" anywhere close in context. Really, "no taking your clothes off" is never said in the Bible. What's said is that sex before marriage is wrong, and so is lusting.    And one of the scribes came and heard them arguing, and recognizing that He had answered them well, asked Him, "What commandment is the foremost of all?" Jesus answered, "The foremost is, 'Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God is one Lord; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.' "The second is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these." Mark 12:28-31    "But I say to you, anyone who stares at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart." Matthew 5:28.|`|3m00lxxuaa	I haven't seen anywhere yet where it says that when concerning married couples making love.

itroxygvaa	Arabic is a rich language, for example these simple words:  (Bism-illahi Alrahman Alraheem):    translate to 13 words in English:    (In the name of the One God, The most Gracious, the most Merciful)    reading it in Arabic gets you more rewards, however God accepts :)    I recommend listening to it in Arabic + translation in English using this website:    http://quranexplorer.com/quran    Also, I recommend this translation of the Quran:  http://www.islam101.com/quran/yusufAli/    may God increase us and you in knowledge and guidance, ameen|`|vGWD8Zncaa	Well, with any ancient text, you get more out of it when you can read it in the native tongue.    However, you will also get SOMETHING out of these texts even if you read a translation.  Try to get a well-reputed translation, however.    Keep in mind that even if you were to learn Arabic to read the Qur'an, it would be many, MANY years before you could ever get to the point where you'd get MORE out of it than a good English translation!    Just because you learn enough of a language to muddle through doesn't mean you'll understand it well!    You'd have to be considerably fluent in Arabic before you'd notice an advantage, not to mention versed in the vernacular of the times and the region.    So unless you're going to become a serious student of Arabic, don't worry about it.    (Also, "reward" is usually what people TELL you in order to gain a modicum of control; knowledge and the pursuit of knowledge is always the greatest reward)|`|A8JbIu4eaa	course you will...at least you'll know what its all about!!!|`|d23570aaff2422e34fd788f5683707d3aa	Asalamu Alykum,    Its probably best to ask this question in the Ramadan section.|`|6KGGAtNtaa	Yes Allah will reward you the same, however remember that some translations are not accurate.|`|mqTsg05Taa	That's cool.

yQNit56Qaa	1) Christians - how does the bible explain all of the mammoths and other animals that date to LONG before Christ?    The bible claims that there were thousands of years of life on the planet before Christ.      2) how does the bible explain the fact that archeological evidence shows the bones of these creatures being much older than that of humans?    Remember:  archaeological evidence only *supports* the *theory* that these creatures lived long before humans existed.  (Personally, I feel that this theory does not contradict the bible, but the point is moot since the theory remains unproven).      OK, IF you want an explanation that allows you to accept this theory as plausible without contradicting the bible, here goes...    First, we have the 6 "days" of creation (I explain quotes later).  Lets call them "creation days" or CDs.  Land animals are created on CD6 - *before* man is created, so we know that animals predate man.  But if it's only by 12 hours, that hardly fits with the "old animals" theory, does it?  (BTW - let's call that the "old animals theory", "OAT")    OK, take a look at CD4 (v 14-19)  http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.p...    Here, we see God created the sun - on the fourth day!  Now, we all know that the 24-hour day is due *solely* to the motion of the earth with respect to the sun.  IF CDs are 24-hour days, how can there be 3 24-hour days before the sun even makes an appearance?    The obvious answer would be that these are NOT 24-hour days.  I mean, we can be nearly CERTAIN that the 3 days prior to the creation of the sun are not 24-hour days, because we don't HAVE 24-hour days without the sun!  As it turns out, there's linguistic support for this obvious logical conclusion...    The Hebrew word that is translated "day" can also be accurately translated "period of time of undetermined length".  In other words, the Hebrew word has more than one meaning.  We see the same thing in English.  If someone says, "in their day", you know they are speaking about a period of years or even decades.  If someone is speaking of the dinosaurs and says "in their day", we understand that to mean a period of time covering millions of years!    It so happens that the same sort of ambiguity adheres to the Hebrew word.  Indeed, the Hebrew word translated "day" in Gen 1 is *repeatedly* used to mean a much longer period of time throughout the Old Testament.  So, why is it translated as "day"?  Well, the first reason is that "day" in English has both meanings, so its a very precise translation IF you don't assume that "day" can only mean a 24-hour day.  Second, to translate "day" as "period of time of undetermined length" is really wordy and really awkward sounding.  Unless the translator can be absolutely certain that the Hebrew word does not mean 24-hour day, "day" IS the best translation to use.    Nevertheless, we have this dual evidence in Gen 1:  first, the fact that 3 CDs pass without any sun, making it pretty clear that we are NOT talking about 24-hour days.  Second:  the fact that the Hebrew word translated "day" can mean a period of time of almost any length.    SO, were the land animals created 12 hours before man - or were they created at the beginning of an entire *epoch*, while man was created at the end of that same epoch?  IF our CDs are epochs, then conceivably each CD can cover a period of millions - or even billions - of years.  What about our Old Animal Theory (OAT) now?  Let's look at the order of the creation of living things in Genesis now...    1) plant life  2) ocean animals and flying creatures ("birds" is a word very much like "day".  The more precise translation is "flight-capable animals" which would and *does* include insects!  The same word is used to describe flying insects elsewhere.)  3) land animals  4) man    As you can see, the order of creation of living things in Genesis quite closely parallels the general order of creation as theorized by species evolution.    SO, if you accept the less-common but linguistically sound (in both English and Hebrew) meaning of the word "day", then our OAT is quite compatible with the bible.

Animals were created before humans, so that explains your mammoths. The creation story is a record of an oral tradition that was passed down from generation to generation long before it was ever written down. There were probably many changes along the way, like the telephone game you played in school. Later books of the Bible are supposed to be direct accounts of what happened.

yDJiiqcsaa	Sure you can convert to Catholicism.  Divorce doesn't make a person disqualified or nor does it make a Catholic that later divorces excommunicated.  Divorce is not a preventive problem - it is a problem to be dealt with before you can marry someone else.   The process of annulment would have to be initiated in which the first marriage is reviewed to ascertain if it was both "legal" (under laws of the State/country) and Church law; and whether it was "valid" (whether each person was capable (mentally/maturity) of giving full consent/commitment at the time they were married).  Annulment deals with the conditions when first married - NOT with the problems that caused divorced.   Annulment is sort of like saying it "wasn't a "good" contract to begin with".  If the Church investigative group (Tribunal) determines that it was never legal or valid  - then there was no "real" marriage to divorce/dissolve.  If therefore annulled - you'd be free to consider marriage.   Remember if EITHER (husband or wife) weren't capable of giving full commitment due to immaturity or withheld full commitment then the marriage is void/annulled. (One person cannot maintain a marriage unilaterally).   What people get confused about is that a Catholic can divorce without getting excommunicated - they just can NOT marry again unless the first marriage is found to be null.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	You can become a Catholic only if you promise never to remarry.

neSZMDO4aa	The World Council of Churches, attempting to present the common understanding of the Eucharist on the part of the generality of Christians, describes it as "essentially the sacrament of the gift which God makes to us in Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit", "Thanksgiving to the Father", "Amanuensis or Memorial of Christ", "the sacrament of the unique sacrifice of Christ, who ever lives to make intercession for us", "the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, the sacrament of his real presence", "Invocation of the Spirit", "Communion of the Faithful", and "Meal of the Kingdom".    This is my opinion and I do not justify any behavior e.g., pride or any thoughts e.g., lust by giving this opinion. 100% of the people taking Holy communion have refused to let go of their sins or some form, minimally of the sins of pride and lust. To save the wrath of the 'hypocrisy of the righteous' and they are legion, I should say 99.99%.     And they (or we or you) knowingly do this, including  during the original partaking by all twelve Disciples up to this day with the  person administering and partaking the Eucharist with the exception, the one exception of Christ, Himself.    Christ knows today as he knew at the Last Supper of our struggles. I could quote scripture or as a hypocrite tell you otherwise. There is only one person that ever took Communion with God that had no sin.    Your question includes, "I am in love with someone else" "I am married to a man with no intimacy." So you are struggling in your life and I think you will not be in the disfavor of God but in the disfavor of those who pretend to know God's will.    I am not a theologian, I am not a marriage counselor, I don't know God's will and the only criteria I have for answering your question is that I am a struggling sinner.|`|XEBpv9gwaa	Are you Catholic?

So when we receive Communion, we actually participate in the body and blood of Christ, not just eat symbols of them. Paul also said, "Therefore whoever eats the bread and drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will have to answer for the body and blood of the Lord. . . . For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself" (1 Cor. 11:27, 29).|`|zefFTf8Aaa	hummmm,  I think so...  not sure, but ask your priest|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	yes because we do it to remember the sacrifice jesus did on the cross to remove our sins.|`|MU71ihZjaa	Yes... this is a very serious matter... where premature death could be a result.

wB3AbJyLaa	Because science, evolution, and the universe inspire you, I will attempt use the exact inspirations to ironically strengthen your faith. For organic life to exist, the fundamental regularities and constants of physics must all have values that together fall into an extremely narrow range. The probability of this perfect calibration happening by chance is so tiny as to be statistically negligible. Collins puts it well: "When you look from the perspective of a scientist at the universe, it looks as if it knew we were coming. There are fifteen constants...that have precise values. If any of those constants was off by even one part in a million, or in some cases, by one part in a million million, the universe could not have been able to coalesce, there would have been no galaxy, stars, planets or people." Some have said that it is as if there were a large number of dials that all had to be tuned to within extremely narrow limits, and they were. It seem extremely unlikely that this would happen by chance. Stephen Hawkins concludes: "The odds against the Big Bang are enormous. I think there are clearly religious implications." Elsewhere he says, "It would be very difficult to explain why the universe would have begun in just this way except as the act of a God who intended to create beings like us."|`|jfwmelYgaa	Watch "What the bleep do we know" you can probably find it online somewhere.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	Stop standing in the counsel of the ungodly.

I WANT you to read the bible...     The fastest way to becoming an atheist is to sit down and read the bible and/or the koran from cover to cover...    Here... I'll give you some good quotes 'they' don't like to talk about to start you off...    ? ? ? Jesus Reveals Himself ? ? ?   "I am the root and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star." (Revelation 22:16)    Comment  This verse presents the most shocking revelation in the entire Bible. On the very last page, it reveals Jesus as the "bright and morning star". In other words, Lucifer-- Satan!    In Isaiah 14:12, St. Jerome, translated the Hebrew "morning star" into the Latin term "Lucifer" (light bearer), a name commonly ascribed to Satan by Christians, and represents the fallen star, an ancient symbol for the fallen or evil one. The mourning star actually appears as the planet Venus, the brightest "star" in the sky (but the ancients did not know about planets). Venus always appears low on the horizon, thus it looked like a fallen star (fallen angel) to the believers.    Although the Isaiah verse describes the fallen king of Babylon, Christians have, for centuries, ascribed Satan as taking many forms. And what more powerful form could an evil being take than to pretend himself as the saviour of the world? This would certainly explain the hate filled verses attributed to Jesus and the blind followers who inherit ignorance. Thus, a conclusion, based on Christian beliefs of Satan, and the belief in the "inerrancy" of the Bible, one must conclude that Jesus has revealed himself as Satan!    What a Revelation!    ? ? ? Promise To Return ? ? ?   Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom. (Matthew 16:28)    Comment  Most Christians do not realize that Jesus' promise of his second coming did not apply to our generation or to a future generation, but only to the generation of his time. Also, Jesus said in Rev. 3:11: "Behold I come quickly..."    Those poor people of early Christianity! They thought the texts got written for them, yet Jesus never fulfilled his promise.    Two thousand years have rolled by and yet many "true" believers still await his "quick" return. As any school child knows, anyone who does not keep promises does not deserve our trust, much less our admiration.    Furthermore, to believe in a second coming and the end of the world gives no reason to feel concerned about the long-term future of Earth. Why should we care about the environment, wars, or suffering if we believe that the world will come to an end soon and that everything will get taken care of in heaven?    ? ? ? Came Not To Send Peace ? ? ?   "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household." (Matthew 10:34-37)    Comment  These words of Jesus confirm the unbelievable notion that Jesus did not come to establish peace, but rather to send the sword and to put man against his family. So much for family values. (See also Luke 12: 51-53, Luke 12:49 and Luke 14:26.)    ? ? ? I Come To Send Fire ? ? ?   "I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?" (Luke 12:49)    "Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division: For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law." (Luke 12:51-53)    Comment  Jesus did not come to send peace, but rather fire and division among the family. So much for the idea of a pacifist Jesus and the modern concept of "family values." (See also Luke 14:26)    ? ? ? Jesus Not Entirely Good ? ? ?   "And behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments." (Matthew 19:16-17)    Comment  Most Christians believe that Jesus, not only lived as the Son of God but God in the flesh. Consider that Jesus here calls "none good but one, that is, God," pointing to an entity separate from himself (also see Matt. 5:48)    Also note that because of the belief that none other than God "is" good suggests that Jesus must not have behaved in an entirely good manner himself.    Some early Gnostic cults (judged as heretics by the orthodox church) believed Jesus as the Devil in the flesh and these verses suggests that He was the opposite of good-- Evil in the disguise of God.    ? ? ? Jesus' servants would fight ? ? ?   "If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. " (John 18:36)    Comment  Jesus here gives Pilate an excuse for his predicament and, amazingly, makes the claim that his servants would fight for him if this world represented his kingdom. If Jesus' servants would fight for him, then what does that say about a peaceful world on earth or in heaven?    In effect, Jesus here complains about his deliverance to the Jews which would lead to his crucifixion, something that God supposedly ordained for the purpose of salvation of sinners (according to believers). So much for that theory.    ? ? ?

As man says "There is no perfect science". One just has to look at the Human body that we were created by God. Read below.    Are you hungry? Not physically hungry, but do you have a hunger for something more in life? Is there something deep inside you that never seems to be satisfied? If so, Jesus is the way! Jesus said, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty" (John 6:35).    Are you confused? Can you never seem to find a path or purpose in life? Does it seem like someone has turned out the lights and you cannot find the switch? If so, Jesus is the way! Jesus proclaimed, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life" (John 8:12).    Do you ever feel like you are locked out of life? Have you tried so many doors, only to find that what is behind them is empty and meaningless? Are you looking for an entrance into a fulfilling life? If so, Jesus is the way! Jesus declared, "I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. He will come in and go out, and find pasture" (John 10:9).    Do other people always let you down? Have your relationships been shallow and empty? Does it seem like everyone is trying to take advantage of you? If so, Jesus is the way! Jesus said, "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep...I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me" (John 10:11, 14).    Do you wonder what happens after this life? Are you tired of living your life for things that only rot or rust? Do you sometimes doubt whether life has any meaning? Do you want to live after you die? If so, Jesus is the way! Jesus declared, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will never die" (John 11:25-26).    What is the way? What is the truth? What is the life? Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6).    The hunger that you feel is a spiritual hunger, and can only be filled by Jesus. Jesus is the only one who can lift the darkness. Jesus is the gate to a satisfying life. Jesus is the friend and shepherd that you have been looking for. Jesus is the life - in this world and the next. Jesus is the way of salvation!    The reason you feel hungry, the reason you seem to be lost in darkness, the reason you can't find meaning in life, is that you are separated from God. The Bible tells us that we have all sinned, and are therefore separated from God (Ecclesiastes 7:20; Romans 3:23). The void you feel in your heart is God missing from your life. We were created to have a relationship with God. Because of our sin, we are separated from that relationship. Even worse, our sin will cause us to be separated from God for all of eternity, this life and the next (Romans 6:23; John 3:36).    How can this problem be solved? Jesus is the way! Jesus took our sin upon Himself (2 Corinthians 5:21). Jesus died in our place (Romans 5:8), taking the punishment that we deserve. Three days later, Jesus rose from the dead, proving His victory over sin and death (Romans 6:4-5). Why did He do it? Jesus answered that question Himself, "Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13). Jesus died so that we could live. If we place our faith in Jesus, trusting His death as the payment for our sins - all of our sins are forgiven and washed away. We will then have our spiritual hunger satisfied. The lights will be turned on. We will have access to a fulfilling life. We will know our true best friend and good shepherd. We will know that we will have life after we die - a resurrected life in heaven for eternity with Jesus!    "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16).|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	Your spirit is the part that connects with God, and your flesh wants to do fleshly things...whatever you nourish more will grow, and the only way to nourish your spirit is with the Word of God, then your flesh will become weaker ...

We have all sinned and fallen short of Gods glory (Romans 3:23). As a result, we deserve death and an eternity apart from God (Romans 6:23). But God loved us enough to die in our place, taking the punishment that we deserved (Romans 5:8). As a result, all those who believe are saved and eternally secure.    Sometimes doubting is a good thing. Paul tells us in 2 Corinthians 13:5 examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. We are to test ourselves to be sure that Jesus is truly our Savior and the Holy Spirit is truly in us. If He is, we can in no way lose the salvation Christ has obtained for us (Romans 8:38-39). If He's not, then perhaps the Holy Spirit is convicting us of sin and prompting us to repent and be reconciled to God through Christ. The assurance of our salvation comes from the knowledge that once we are in Christ, we are eternally secure. But genuine saving faith is evidenced by its works (James 2:14-26) and the fruit of the Spirit within us (Galatians 5:22). The lack of this evidence can sometimes be the cause of our doubts.|`|uC0xTgkeaa	it's really hard to be a christian sometimes, believe me, we all experience doubts sometime or another.    Just think of a single human body, the way our bodies work is a miracle in itself, and had to be carefully planned. We have so many systems that all work together, and we can feel emotions like love, anger, and grief. It takes me alot more faith to believe that we all evolved from single celled organism into this, than to believe that we have an intelligent Designer who thought us out carefully. It would have been mathematically impossible for the world to be this way if it all happened by chance.  at least that's one of the things that helps me.|`|hrraz7aIaa	I must tell you as a disclaimer that I have been an atheist since junior high.  First off It's natural to have the doubts about god or gods.  They have a magical sometimes nonsensical nature.  The stories of the bible were written by men with the wisdom of their time things like sea monsters, curses, magic were real to them.  I grew up catholic and decided it was better to be a non believer and true to myself than a just-in-case christian when I had the same doubts you are feeling.  Lack of religion does not make you an immoral person nor does being religious make you a moral person.  For example hitler was a christian.  Ultimately you must decide for yourself the answers will take time and thought.|`|hXxZ2kVfaa	trust me..

For the skeptic gleans from the text what may be invented against itself and the Bibles design provides ample fodder for them to choke on.  The truth of the Bible isnt to be found in "one liner scriptures"  but of a greater context which can only be recieved through study and the power of God.  The truth of the Bible is found in the conveyance of Gods message to His children and not from a literalists quest for error.  For the Gospel of Jesus Christ is foolishness to those that are perishing.   They are  never satisfied, never coming to the understanding of the truth.      1 Corinthians 1  21  For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 23but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,     Matthew 11:25  At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.    2 Corinthians 4:4  The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.     Luke 8  9 His disciples asked him what this parable meant. 10 He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that,     "though seeing, they may not see;  though hearing, they may not understand.'    John 1:5  The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.|`|cXXJVz64aa	You are wanting to believe in something that doesn't exist? That doesn't make sense.

Faith comes by hearing,and hearing by the word of God.  Also as far as science goes, don't believe that nonsense about evolution. Evolution does not explain biogenesis, which is where life came from in the first place. A self replicating mechanism is higly complex, and a self replicating machine which is life, would be too complex to have occurred by accident.  As far as the age of the earth goes, the strata dates are nonsense too. They just guessed based on assumptions that life evolved over time. Ever since Luis Pasteur they have been disproving the nonsense of evolution, but the evolutionists just keep revising the theory, and insulting those that believe in the Bible calling them rednecks, when many Phd's realise that intelligent design was involved in creating life.   Pray to God for more faith, but you won't get more faith until you get into the Word. That's the way God wants it to work. God wants you to love His Word, the Bible, so if you believe without the word, then you won't love the bible.|`|00b644b30c5fa40d9099dfddcd2118c3aa	The key to understanding God is first to understand the idea of mystery.  There are things that we humans, will never be able to truly understand.  One of those things is creation.  While the Bible says that God created the universe, it is up to debate about whether the Genesis account is literal or symbolic.  Most modern biblical scholars are more inclined to believe it is symbolic, but that does not disturb their faith in God.  There are points of evolution that actually require more faith than belief in a creator, and it does not answer the ultimate question of where the first substance came from.  That is mystery.  Science tries to give all the answers but it still falls way short of a comprehensive scheme that accounts for all phenomena  observed by humans.|`|6ec55368aa773b05b3b9440af5f7fc50aa	Here is something that helps.Before the big bang.Where did the original matter/energy come from?Or after  that,the universe exploded.It happened to form spheres.Which happened to form atmosphere.The waters happen to form single then multi celled animals.Here is the question.What is the probability of that???There is so much unanswered questions and speculations.Science has become a matter of faith.  But I ask of you pray.He has been waiting.|`|04f345ca740404026090acf2b474e49caa	Well intimate knowledge of God can only come from God from seeking him.  Spiritual truth is revealed, not learned.    Keep in mind that there is nothing within science that can disprove or could ever, the existence of God.  Religion and philosophy is outside the scope of empirical analysis.     I would suggest that you are being led to believe there is no God by some sources for science because they have their personal agenda and philosophy cleverly built into the material to make you think you have to choose between being a rational logical person or a raving religious lunatic that is faith only.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Some of our greatest thinkers in history and now are believers in the God of Abraham.  And the more reasonable, logical, self-critical of atheists will admit as much.|`|3a9f326d01ff48571ab8b07403c16d21aa	First of all get a calculator out. The earths crust is about 20 miles thick. now lets suppose the crust of the earth developed about 1/4th an inch on average per year. 1 mile is 5280 ft times 12 equals 63360 inches times 4= 253440 quarter inches times 20 miles equals 5,068,800 years ago the crust developed which proves science has already told you a lie. I dont trust anything science tells me because I keep finding lies like that. The only thing you have about science is that some teacher tells you this stuff is fact. Their Bible is a text book that somebody wrote last week. My Bible was written long ago by 44 authors that I have yet to find a lie in it. Make your teachers prove the stuff they tell you...

God Bless.
m81dfyOYaa	It so frustrating to make plans and have them canceled at the last minute, I know how that goes. When this happens one too many times I usually don't make plans with that person again. Another thing that really annoys me too is when I turn myself into a pretzel to be someplace on time only to have the person show up 30 minutes late. Some people are so aggravating.|`|lBLBvE0Zaa	I don't think you're overreacting, it's completely normal that you're mad, I would be too.    Actually, not too long ago, a friend of mine asked me as a favor to stay on campus and eat lunch with her (she had a class two hours later and didn't want to go home 'cause she wouldn't have time to eat,etc.), so since I had classes in the afternoon, I went ahead and agreed. I believe the time she should've been there was 1.30 pm. Well, 2.00 pm...nobody there...2.30 pm...the same, 3.00 pm...still waiting. No need to mention I kept calling her and she never picked up the phone. So at 3 I decided to go home to eat, which meant I had to miss my first class. I was pissed. Her excuse was that she had forgotten. As you can imagine, I didn't talk to her for weeks. There I was trying to do her a favor and she couldn't have cared less. I felt so disrespected.    So yeah, when you make plans you're supposed to not change your mind at the last minute. And in case you do, let the other person know, for God's sake!    Take care,  ;-)|`|defde0b6e42848179471ab740c517f46aa	I hate when people do that too.  It happens to me all the time.  One thing though, did you say you canceled plans to make plans with this other person?  If so, maybe the person you canceled on feels the same way you feel right now.  Unless of course you gave them advanced notice, then they probably don't feel the way you do.    Edit:  Ah, ok.  Sorry for saying that then.  I just was kind of curious.  Definitely though, there comes a point when you have to kind of weed out the people who do things like this.  My oldest friend (we've been friends for about17 years) and I don't really hang out anymore because I got so sick of her doing this to me.  Good luck, I know it doesn't feel good.|`|GSwjoipVaa	Wow.

Consider this fact: All men are born with tendencies to do things not acceptable. For example: All men are born with a tendency to molest their own daughters. Most men have enough self respect to control themselves. It's simply a matter of mind over body, a matter of the brain making the decision to do what's right. That is what life is about, making right decisions. A few people are born with same sex attraction. Again, this is something that they know is not normal or good, so they should put their brain in charge, and not just let the body rule. If we all let our bodies decide everything there would be no end to trouble. The brain needs to take charge. So again, I repeat. It's not the perverts we dislike, it's their conduct and lack of self control we don't like.|`|CnSaGHqWaa	My opinion only but I think it's learned.

However when I grew up and started coming into my own, I started asking myself why.

IEC0t2c8aa	    I believe that Mormons believe That Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior, that he is the Son of God, . I think they believe in the trinity as well . I believe that they believe in doing Gods work and have set their Entire belief system on helping the World KNOW the truth the way and the Light that is only found through our Lord Jesus.(Thus the door to door)   Yes they make house calls!!   I also believe that they believe that Joseph Smith is a prophet that was instructed to gather people together to do the work that The Holy spirit set in front of him... I am Not sure but is it the Native Americans That they believe that  Jesus went to  when somewhere in the Bible he said he had to go and reach the others is that who he went to see when he said that is that what they believe ?

On the whole, most of the Mormons I've met have been friendly enough (there's an LDS church down the street from me, and I've had many missionaries show up at my door), but I dislike how the church sometimes treats members who wish to convert or leave the religion.  I'm also not keen on some of the prejudice that runs rampant in the religion, though that applies to all of Christianity as well.  On the whole, I do really think Mormons are any better or worse than other Christians.  They just come from a very different world than I do, so it's expected that we won't always see eye to eye.

Victims of Satan's lies. The book of mormon is not the word of God.|`|BZBAogDwaa	The book of mormon lists many plants and animals that supposedly existed in the Americas, but in reality never did.  Talk to any biologist, archeologist, historian etc.  They will tell you that none of these plants ever existed in the America's until Europeans brought them over, which is way long after the supposed nephites or whatever the mormons called the supposed jews who came to america.    No wheat, barley, figs or grapes were found in pre-european America although the book of Mormon talks about it.    Same thing goes for animals.  Here is an excerpt of the web site below.    Dr. John L. Sorenson proposed that the Nephites were really referring to either a species of deer or tapir, but since they did not have names for these animals, they called them horses. This seems a weak response, but even if it were true it doesn't account for the many other animals and crops for which there is absolutely no archeological evidence.    The book of mormon and mormonism are complete frauds.  It is absolutely obvious.    Also the book of mormon talks about huge battles raging at the narrow pass or something like that.

For someone to prove me right or wrong will require research on their part.    Get your Bibles and research materials ready....    All races were created on the 6th day accept for 1... Caucasian  (that is not a racial remark in any form, GOD made us all and he was pleased with what He created)  The 10 tribes of Israel that were scattered (most going north) traveled over the Caucasus Mountains - that is why they are called Caucasians.  Some settled in what we now call Europe, Asia, Russia.... and Later settling in what is now Canada and the Americas.  --------------------------------------...  GOD did not rest the entire 7th day. Yes, He worked on the morning of the 7th. "...on the seventh day God ended his work..."  --------------------------------------...  Cain and Abel were twins in the sense that they had the same mother and were born at the same time frame.... But Cain's father was Satan.  Cain, after being driven out from the presence of the LORD, cain settled in the land of Nod and took a wife... also proving that other races were on the earth. This could possibly be the first interracial marriage.  --------------------------------------...  There is no such thing as the "rapture".  When you die, you do not wait in a hole in the ground until the LORD returns... to be absent from the flesh, is to be present with the LORD.  This teaching began to spread in 1830 from Margaret MacDonald. GOD did not wait about 1800 years to tell us this.   HOWEVER, GOD did say 2 very important things that concern this teaching... "behold I have foretold you all things"....  Ezekiel 13: 17 - 23   GOD told Ezekiel something that most people don't understand because MOST (false) PREACHERS and RELIGIONS don't teach - they skip over - the fact that GOD saw that someone would try to teach this crap....  GOD SAID: (and I'm paraphrasing to help you understand)  17- 23:  Ezekiel, prophesy against the daughters of thy people for they prophesy from their hearts... (they didn't teach the word of GOD they taught their own collective ideas - a false religion)     God is saying that these women are trying (through their teaching) to cover His outstretched saving arms... teaching His children to fly to save their souls.  GOD said... "wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go..."          "...Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthed the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life..."  --------------------------------------...  GOD said Learn the parable of the Fig Tree and He meant it !  We are in the generation of the Fig Tree..... Starting as of 1948 when both the good and bad "figs" (people of Israel) became a nation once again. Israel hasn't been a nation since GOD scattered it. Up until this time the land has been controled by many nations.    GOD said that this generation SHALL NOT PASS until all prophesy is FULFILLED !     We are in those final days. My dear family, I hope you are paying attention.  --------------------------------------...    Satan returns first, pretending to be Christ....    Peacefully and prosperously....   knowing that we as the human race have never seen nor experienced a "supernatural" being before....  many people will think that he is Jesus.  The people that claim to be the ones "taken from the feilds" or "raptured" will be the greatest followers of Satan. They are just too blind to see him for who he is.  Your family member that "deliver" you unto "death" are these very people. REMEMBER - One of the many names of Satan, is death.  You will delivered up before him as a witness, If you are one of the Elect.  The Elect, through the spirit and words of our Almighty GOD, will speak against Satan in a tongue that will be understood by all people of the earth AND they will begin to doubt that he is The Christ.  He will be trying to perform miracles so great that GOD said for the Elect's sake, He would shorten this time frame from 7 years down to 5 months, because He thought that it was too much to bear with such an outpouring of lies.   Which is the last flood - the flood of lies.  The last famine - the famine of not hearing the true Word of GOD taught as it should be in it's pureity. (the bread of life) not a famine for bread...

Although there may be SOME truth in astrology, it's not the whole truth.  The stars were created for "signs and seasons", but I think it's obvious that the astrological "signs" are pagan.  Perhaps I'm wrong on this.  If so, this would just be another one of Satan's counterfeits.      The stars, i.m.o., represent spirit-filled believers, the moon represents Christ, and the sun represents the father.  In this, the stars reveal the plan of salvation that God had in place from the foundation of the universe.  This is a "sign" I believe is actually from God.  I should be careful to state that this is only my belief.    It's very tempting for men to want to know the future.  But this doesn't come from faith, it comes from fear of the unknown.  Divination has been going on since the beginning of mankind.  Saul went to a medium and died the next day.  In the book of Acts, a woman who foretold the future was saved, and could no longer foretell the future.  This should say something to us.    Act 16:16  And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:   Act 16:17  The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which show unto us the way of salvation.   Act 16:18  And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.   Act 16:19  And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,    Note: What she said was true, however her source of information was a spirit of divination that she was possessed with.|`|e1f14553031ea73247b5b1290c459513aa	The Bible says that the stars are for "signs" such as the star over Bethlehem. It is possible that the 3 wisemen were students of astrology but I think the emphasis about stars is astronomy, not astology. Stars are for times and seasons and to mark the time of something to come. As for the constellations, I've read that they tell stories of the coming Messiah which is Christ. Also, if you look at the Jewish calendar such as the month of Elul which is signified 'the virgin', the "story" or meaning of the constellation gives meaning to the time that is celebrated in that month.    As for numbers, they, too, have a significance to dilineate meaning and symbolism. Not necessarily divination. The number 12 in particular means:    "perfection of government, or of governmental perfection. It is found as a multiple in all that has to do with rule. The sun which "rules" the day, and the moon and stars which "govern" the night, do so by their passage through the twelve signs of the Zodiac which completes the great circle of the heavens of 360 (12 x 30) degrees or divisions, and thus govern the year." -  http://www.biblestudy.org/bibleref/meani...    As for the creatures in Ezekiel, I think they are again seen in Revelation. They are not the constellations, but represent the four faces of Christ. A man, an ox, a lion, and and eagle. He was born as a man, the ox is 'servant, the lion is "the lion of judah", and "eagle" as in to bear up on eagle's wings.|`|q57P8uJbaa	The element of truth in astrology is far beneath the element of truth in Christianity.  The Bible gives numerous examples of this in the books of Isaiah and Daniel:    http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/inde...    I would suppose that the wise men in the Bible were not astrologers at all.  First of all the star concerning Jesus, was not a regular star.  Could others see it also.  Could not Herod's own astrologers note this star as well?  Apparently not.  Herod's men could not see it, but the Magi could.  The star, just was not a regular star.  The Magi followed the star as it moved and the star actually stood still when it reached Christ's location.  What kind of a star was that?  Not one that we see in the heavens obviously.    Then later the Magi are warned in a dream by God not to return to Herod.  In other words God was directly communicating with these men.  Who is to say that God did not communicate with them in a dream about the star and Christ's birth as well?|`|OCc1si6Gaa	Astrology is the system of belief in which knowledge of the relative positions of celestial bodies is used to interpret and organize information about personality, human affairs, and other terrestrial matters.    Since earliest known records in about 2300 BC; astrology has played a role in the shaping of culture and politics throughout history. In fact, despite the modern conceit that we live in an "enlightened, scientific and literate society", nearly every major newspaper in the world contains an astrological horoscope section.    Unfortunately, Astrology is bullshit.    4300 years ago, when the ancient Babylonians invented the practices we now call astrology, they were earnestly trying to understand the world they inhabited. The Babylonians did not have anything resembling the scientific method of thought, but did the best they could.    Babylonian astrology was based on the "theory of divine governance". This theory encompassed the belief that events on earth, including famines, harvests, wars and treaties were the direct result of the will of a large number of gods. These gods were active and regular agents affecting earthly and human matters, unlike the distant or non-involved "God" that many modern Christians may recognize.    Starting from the Babylonian's observation that the fertility of the soil depends upon the sun and rain from the heavens; and that mischief and damage done by storms and floods were to be traced likewise to the heavens; the conclusion was made that the gods had their home in the heavens.    Observation of the night sky, coupled with the desire to predict important events such as storms, or crop failures led quite naturally to the early Babylonian astrology.    The Babylonians divided the night sky into small discreet regions, each the home of one of their gods. These regions, although renamed and reshaped since 2300 BC, are what we now call constellations. There are 88 constellations defined and recognized by the International Astronomical Union, these 88 regions of the sky encompass the entire sky visible from the surface of the Earth. This is obviously many more than the 12 commonly associated to zodiacal astrological star-signs familiar to every modern newspaper. To understand the significance of these 12 zodiacal constellations, its necessary to understand a little about the mechanics of our solar system.    the plane of the eclipticThere are nine Planets in our solar system, varying in distance from the sun, from the nearest, mercury, to the farthest, Pluto. (or Neptune, as Pluto has recently be reclassified, losing its planetary status) The planets in our solar system all orbit the sun in the same direction, and in the same plane. That is, all the planets follow orbital paths which are more-or-less in line with each other, defining a flat plane with the sun at its center. This is called the "plane of the ecliptic" because if three celestial bodies, such as the sun, the moon, and the earth briefly "line up" creating an eclipse, it is on this plane.    From the surface of the Earth, the plane of the ecliptic can be drawn across the sky as an imaginary line. Observations of the planets and the sun will always be along this imaginary line.    The constellations of the zodiac are defined as those which are bisected by the plane of the ecliptic. A person's "zodiacal sign" is the constellation in which the sun is found on the date of their birthday.    constellation of Ophiuchus The zodiacal constellations are:       1. Sagittarius     2. Capricorn     3. Aquarius     4. Pisces     5. Aries     6. Taurus     7. Gemini     8. Cancer     9. Leo    10. Virgo    11. Libra    12. Scorpio    13. Ophiuchus        Some people might be surprised to learn there are not twelve, but thirteen constellations in the zodiac. In the 2nd century AD a Greek astrologer and mathematician named Ptolemy published a set of astrological tables which omitted the thirteenth constellation, Ophiuchus. Ptolemy's 12-sign astrological table was based on the sun spending an equal amount of time in each constellation, corresponding to the 12 months of the calendar. He is known to have used the then-2400 year old Babylonian astronomical data. As a popularizer of horoscopic astrology, Ptolemy may have sacrificed accuracy for simplicity.    Whatever scientific merit there might have been in the still-developing field of astrology, Ptolemy's tables mark a point of divergence from the later science of astronomy which replaces it. Present day horoscopes published in newspapers still use the same tables.    If people still believed that events on Earth were controlled by supernatural beings living in the sky, modern horoscopic astrology would have a significant problem.    That Ptolemy's tables were based on second-millennium BCE Babylonian data brings up the issue of precession. The Earth, as most people know, not only orbits the sun once per year, it also rotates on its own axis once per day, similar to a spinning to|`|qNpLxKtkaa	I find the bible uses the number twelve a lot. I'm not too particular to numerology but i am quite particular of astrology. I don't run too the horoscopes in the newspaper or to text the stupid number, but I believe that astrology does affect people. Hey, God created the stars, why can't they affect someone at their birth?    twelve apostles, twelve tribes of israel, twelve signs of zodiac, there are more i am sure.    I as people about it all the time, and people almost ALWAYS fall into their sign. I know that I am an aquarius and I tend to act like that, i believe that signs affect the friendships and relationships with others.    The magi had to have been astrologers.

Its probably just a misunderstanding. And any of those can be cleared up simply be communication.|`|k5quFjO8aa	You know, I think you're pretty lucky.

Maybe you're one of the few people with a mom who will love you no matter what, and she just decided that whatever you do is fine by her. Either way, if it bothers you, talk to her about it. Yes it's a cliche, but communication is the key.
kXq90b09aa	its same as any other religion!! you have so many dos and don'ts in every religion but not everyone will abide by it perfectly! What you heard was right, Islam encourages marriage to great extent thus it forbids dating and relationships without getting married.|`|ou20w5sCaa	Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim - In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful    Muslims are not allowed to date in the Western sense.  Like going out together with no chaperone, or being alone together, holding hands, kissing and the like.  Islam is keen to protect women especially from being assaulted or taken advantage of, so we protect ourselves by not acting in a manner that can lead to sin.    Now, the practice of arranged marriage is not Islamic either.  There is a middle ground where a man and a woman can get to know each other, but it has to be done in a decent manner without the physical interaction.  They can go out in public, or meet at home with a chaperone, and spend time together talking to learn if they are compatible.  Until marriage they are "non-mahram" to each other, meaning that even if they get engaged they still cannot be alone.      There are many Muslims who do not have a correct understanding of Islam, so they don't know the rules in regards to marriage.  Others know but are weak and cannot seem to stop themselves from engaging in wrong behavior.  The best way is to obey God and be chaste, so that you will not have any regrets down the line.  And that goes for men AND women.    May Allah guide you to the best in this world and the next.  Ameen.    Fi Aman Allah,    Nancy Umm Abdel Hamid|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	most of them don't date because they are promised to someone else and this happens at a very early age. you are tlaking about the generation that is tryign to end this mess and go on like we are. its harder for them to decide because the parents are there still having a fit but that is why.|`|Czpfs8RLaa	It is the choice of the parents whether or not they arrange marriages, it is more of a culture thing not a religion thing :) hope that helps|`|AA10105819	You're right, Muslims can't date like Westerners do. To understand this, we must first define "dating" and "coutship" and the differences between them.    Dating means to go out with different people, develop romances, engage in physical intimacy, even living together outside of marriage. Dating doesn't necessarily mean that a person is marriage minded. Dating can be that all a person wants is sex, or "friends with benefits."    This is a description of dating, but not of courtship. Muslims don't just meet and marry on the spot, no. They have to get to know another first. For this, they have courtships. Always, for a Muslim, the goal of coutship is finding a spouse, and never ever to "play the field." They don't date, as in going to the movies together, holding hands, kissing, etc. This is reserved for marriage. Instead, they visit each other at home (where the families live too), they all have dinner together, they talk, they see each other's behavior around family, around friends, etc. Basically, they see the other person's life, and then they make the decision to marry or not.    They can go out, but it's better to have a chaperone. At the very least, they can to out together, but keep themselves in a public place 100% of the time. For example, if they go to dinner and coffee, they're always in a public place where no hanky panky can go on. But you know, it's always safest to bring a friend, so that they can't drive off and "go parking."    Isolation, sex, bed-hopping, this has no place in Islam.    To answer your question, some Muslims date because they are going against their religion. It's like asking why some Christians get drunk, or why some Christians don't go to church, etc.    As for arranged marriages, this is not an Islamic thing, but a cultural thing. Keep in mind, though, many times an "arranged" marriage merely means that the family has selected a suitor, but the woman and man have the final say as to whether they will marry or not.    In a few cases, there is forced marriage, but this is not at all Islamic. It's 100% cultural.|`|AH1LuqZMaa	I agree with Llamas, so Muslims do date but not like Americans date. Arranged marriage is a cultural thing and not a religion thing. Even the Prophet Muhammad said no one should marry blindly.|`|N5zAbfggaa	ya u are really ignorant    tahts a stupid question    has nothing to do with religion just parents|`|E135gdSXaa	Actually it has everything to do with religion. SOme of the fundamentalist muslims believe that the woman shouldn't date. Rather, the parents set them up. But the new progressive muslims date same as any other religion. It's all about how hard core you are.
aZKgs79Naa	i believe that things which are that into depth, as you speak, are not consciences-- that it does mean something.  I would, personally, meditate on the letter, and in your mind think about what it may mean to you; maybe "A" will represent a future mates name whom you'll meet soon, or a sign for something which will happen.  I hope you figure this out, love and peace,    me :)

ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	You are right when you say that God loves everybody. But He does disapprove of the choices that we make, for instance, when He destroyed the city of Sodom and Gomorrah for their sinful nature. They had a choice and chose to disobey God. You have to answer for disobeying.   The Bible also says that to be a christian one must believe in God, God the Father, and God the Holy Spirit. And believe that Jesus was the son of God, that He died on the cross for our sins, and that on the third day He rose and ascended into heaven where He sits at the right hand of God.  The Bible says that God sent His only son to die for us. Yes, Jesus did die for our sins. But all we have to do is ask God to forgive us and He does.  But not believing in Jesus or the Bible is your choice. God gives you the right to make your own decisions. So, on the great day of judgment when you stand before God, I hope that you have made the right choice with God and that you came to know Him before you died. But having faith is having secure belief in God and a trusting acceptance of God's will.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	I am atheist but have faith (believe in the absence of conclusive evidence) in something.

I believe it can work for some people and that's what it's meant to be, If Jesus wanted me to be anything it would have been a Jew, as He as a man, did not dream up this Christian thing, it's something his followers came up with, and if Christians don't believe that then they don't even know their own leader, who has you say was a great man in his own right. Jesus is one of my hero's, and I don't have to be a Christian to see what a great man he was.  I am neither a Christian nor a Atheist, I am who I am and that is all I have to be. I'm kind and helpful, which I have many people who would testify to that fact and some are Christian and Atheist. You put across a very good point.

Por ejemplo:  Ayer Lola empez a trabajar.  - Yesterday Lola started work.    Using the IMPERFECT Past Tense     You are describing something that occurred *continuously over a period of time in the past*, OR *what used to happen*.    Por ejemplo:  Cuando yo era estudiante, estaba muy feliz.  - When I was a student, I was very happy.    http://www.rocketlanguages.com/spanish/i...|`|vTNWiFPwaa	preterite and imperfect are both past tense.  however, preterite is when it is an exact action like you did that.

q5lreoiWaa	You bet - just they can not be temple married if they marry in the Catholic faith, it is my understanding that the non-Catholic has to pledge to raise his or her children Catholic.  But in this instance, perhaps neither party will be that strict in observance.|`|XmJZkFuMaa	Yup.  A Mormon can marry whomever they want to marry, but it won't be in the temple for all eternity.  That's the only problem.  They can marry in the church, or wherever.|`|AA11713693	Of coarse they can.

It didn't work out. I loved him and forgave him for all his many indiscretions, but in the end, he wanted his freedom and he got it. We have a child in common, and we are now just friends and have no trouble between us. I'm re-married to a Latter Day Saint and he has a new girl-friend every week, just the way he likes it. So no worries for either of us.    We were not married in a church--I don't think that either of us even considered that, even. We were young and blinded by love, but didn't take Heavenly Father and His principles seriously enough to follow them. We paid the price for it, too.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	Catholics and Mormons can both marry whomever they choose.|`|n1eXQr5oaa	of course they can...|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	Yes, but the Mormon member has to marry the Catholic outside  of the Mormon temple is all.God Bless!|`|AA11314600	Yes, its called free will.

No.  That's only for members in good standing who have been in the church for over a year.      (But we'd love for the Catholic to join, if that's what he wants!)    One of my aunts married a non-Saint.  I never did know his religion, but he was a great guy.  Before I moved, I went to church with an elderly couple.  They're real sweethearts, salt of the earth kind of people.  Sometimes I think I went to church so often just because they were there.  I never did find out what religion the husband had.  I never bothered asking him.  I was just glad he was there, and I figured if he felt like telling me, he'd get around to the subject sooner or later.

If you are gay, and believe it is a sin, then what difference does it make if you are Christian or not.    If you are gay, and believe it is a sin, and are a Christian, then you must know what the Bible tells us that God does with our sins.  (hint:  forgive).    If you are gay, and believe it is a sin, and are a Christian, then you have a long row to hoe.  All that guilt can really suck the joy right out of life.  If you asked me, I'd recommend that you give up on believing it's a sin.  Plenty of churches will accept you just the way you are.    Just to let ya know where I'm coming from, I'm not gay, Christian, and don't believe it's a sin.|`|zlHgIltOaa	Neither!!! Be yourself.    And when any Christian tells you to follow god, ask them "which god?"  There's so many religions out there, and they have no proof that theirs is the right one. The idea of sins was created by man, but you can certainly have morals. Let yourself be happy.|`|E7fguoVBaa	Ask God.  Read the Bible.    In answer, read for yourself what the apostle Paul said at 1?Corinthians 6:9,?10: What! Do you not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit Gods kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes [male prostitutes, New International Version; effeminate, King James Version], nor men who lie with men [sodomites, Jerusalem Bible; homosexual perverts, Todays English Version], nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit Gods kingdom. Note that Paul specifically mentioned those who evidently take on a passive sexual role and those who assume a more active male role in their immoral relations. Thus he made it plain that God disapproves of all homosexual acts.    This is also evident from Pauls words at Romans 1:18-27: Gods wrath is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who are suppressing the truth in an unrighteous way .?.?. God, in keeping with the desires of their hearts, gave them up to uncleanness, that their bodies might be dishonored among them .?.?. That is why God gave them up to disgraceful sexual appetites, for both their females changed the natural use of themselves into one contrary to nature; and likewise even the males left the natural use of the female and became violently inflamed in their lust toward one another, males with males, working what is obscene. Here Paul specifically condemned both male and female homosexuality. He condemned homosexual practices as unnatural and obscene.    Sick or Healthy?    Many would perhaps respond to this by saying that the Bibles viewpoint is simply archaic, outmoded. But when you think about it, who knows our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual makeup better than our Creator? God made man and woman, and he put within them the great attraction they have for each other. (Genesis 1:27,?28) He did not make them to have a sexual attraction for someone of the same sex. Furthermore, God has determined that sexual relations between a man and a woman should take place only within the marriage arrangement.Hebrews 13:4.    This does not work a hardship on us. At Isaiah 48:17, God says that he is the One teaching you to benefit yourself. Yes, he knows what helps us and what harms us. Although to some the Bibles teachings may seem hard to follow, they are always healthful teachings, that is, beneficial to the mind and the body. (Titus 2:1) Homosexuality, on the other hand, can only be detrimental to ones physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	I think it would be good if you were a Christian period.  Even if you still struggle with homosexuality and sin, it would be better than if you were still a sinner and not saved. I don't condone homosexuality, but if a homosexual has faith in Jesus and doesn't understand that homosexuality is a sin, that's fine. When someone accepts Christ they become a new creature, and can overcome sin. So regardless of if homosexuality really is a sin or not it doesn't matter, because as long as a homosexual realises that they are a sinner in need of a savior and repent, and are willing to change if God changes them, then they can be saved.  I wish homosexuals understood this, but they seem to identify with being gay instead of idenifying themselves as being sinners just as every Christian does before they get saved. What's the difference between this sinner and that sinner? All have sinned. Salvation is a free gift from God. Letting one sin prevent you from letting God change you is a bad mistake. Why not just let God change you and be willing to change?|`|AA11323749	neither are sinful    there is no sin in "being gay" (whatever that means)    sexual relations outside of marriage is a sin    homo or hetero    if for somebody, most of their sexual attraction is for persons of the same sex, most people would consider them gay    there is no sin, no need to hide, no need to pretend    all that is needed if for that person, like any other person, to avoid all sexual relations with anyone except their spouse     for most Christians, that means a spouse of the opposite gender    none of this has anything to do with what someones "urges" might be    some people may only get satisfied by sex with children, or animals, or whatever    if somebody can never find sexual satisfaction with a spouse of the opposite sex then to avoid sin they may never experience sexual satisfaction    this is not just a struggle for "gay" people, single people have a similar difficult struggle|`|8ubAwaGCaa	The most righteous is the man who acknowledges his same-sex attractions, but remains in control of himself and lives his life as God wishes.  Maybe I will never be free from sometimes powerful same-sex attractions, urges, and maybe even temptations, but "I am the master of my fate.  I am the captain of my soul."    I am also sexually attracted to grown-up women, but the attraction there is a little steadier.

The solution is as peter says, Gird up the loins of your mind and be sober, and hope to the end for the Grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.|`|9741a3f7ecd87afb6df1b22885eb0f22aa	How is being a gay Christian sinful?

It would be the same as a heterosexual male having a strong attraction to a woman - what he does with it determines whether it becomes a sin or not.  Temptation is not sin.    All people have a proclivity to sin.  Homosexuals are no exception.  I believe God delivers all who surrender fully to him, regardless of the sinful inclinations.|`|WkGGpyVAaa	gay is bad

If you want it to sound older and poetic (it sounds like that's what you're trying to go for. It would sound more like this.    When the soft white clouds were still within reach, when the world knew not of lonesome winters, before Earth had learnt of the weight of man, we met. Thou hadst raised me up- me being not more than a nestling. My down and fluff had shaped to wings and taught me to soar.

Good Luck!|`|xtNe4ysmaa	no dont kiss her it might just freak her out because she might not like you back. its hard but you have to tell her that you like her because if you dont you are just going to stress it. or you can ask her she is gay if she says no just leave it alone. you really cant control who you fall in love with but if you find out that she doesnt feel the same way about you then theres nothing you can do about it,just leave her alone thats life. but you can try|`|KvTbShWsaa	Stop stressing and come out with your feelings in a random conversation. Make sure it happens alone you want this to be personal. If she finds out from another person it's going to be kind weird. But make sure its soon.

b108de07dd9b74f1bd9ebf107e54d92caa	You are to be commended. The way you came out to your friends is a big step and not very easy... and usually something others cannot quite afford to do. You took a risk and it (mostly) worked out for you. <br>  Since the cat is out of the bag, there is no reason to hold it back at school anymore. Those who ask you are curious and if you feel like giving them an answer, tell them the truth. If not ask them why they want to know... ie: looking for a date to Prom or something? Gauge the response and tailer it to the parson asking the question... do use caution. If you ever get an uncomfortable vibe, go with the your gut feeling. Usually intuition is a great thing and can help with troublesome situations.<br>  As for your parents, if you want to tell them then you should. You can either tell them seperately (pick the one you are the most comfortable with) but be careful with wording and don't ask them to not tell the other parent. When I say beware of the wording... avoid the pitfall phrase "I think I might be gay" because that implies uncertainty and the possibility that it is just a "phase". If you do tell them be as firm as you can given the anxiety of the moment. You can also opt to tell them both at the same time... to get it over with faster. It may be a good thing as it would show a level of comfort with both parents... but this in itself could be risky and could give them a chance to gang up on you (if they get to angry or confused, it could happen)<br>  In the end, when and how you do it is your call. Don't waste time waiting for the "perfect" moment because you'll find those are pretty hard to come by. I'm not saying do it NOW, NOW, NOW... but in light of what you are going through at school, the sooner the better.<br>  <br>  Best of luck...|`|0lnamekJaa	If you are or if you are not, what your school mates are doing is illegal... It is discrimination and bullying... <br>  <br>  You do not need to stand for that. <br>  <br>  You are a bit young to officially come out... I'm not saying that you are not gay or that this is a "Phase" because I knew that I was not straight when I was 10... But coming out in High School causes nothing but trouble... Especially in the black community... <br>  <br>  The only thing worse then coming out in the black community is coming out in the HEAVY CATHOLIC Latino Community...<br>  <br>  I won't tell you to deny things... Be who you are, not what others want you to be... but remember... You have the LAW backing you up here... <br>  <br>  If they negativly impact your ability to learn, go and talk to the principle... The last thing on earth he wants is a lawsuit.|`|kavhzTXgaa	First off, give yourself at pat on the back, you are strong young man. That's something to be proud of, and try to not worry so much about the kids at school. People can be cruel, i say, the less you pay attention to it, the less others will too. It may take some time but it will die down at school don't worry.<br>  <br>  As far as your parents go, it sounds to me like your ready to tell them. Just come right out and tell them. If you need a support system ask one of your close friends to be present when you "come out" to them.<br>  <br>  You are making great choices and I'm proud of you! Good Luck and remember stay true to who you are, you are taking the first steps to true happiness!!|`|vL8JErXNaa	Dave, in a way you're lucky to be living in the Chicago area there are a number of resources for gay teens.

I'll tell you what, my friend didn't officially come out till after we graduated in 1996. It's 2009 and she's still getting crap on Facebook from people we went to school with. 30 years old and people still don't grow-up. It's becoming gossip that I'm coming out and hanging out with that friend. Just role with it and know that they are small minded idiots. As for the 'rents: I agree with you. Figure out a way to come out to them before they hear it though the neighborhood gossip mill. It'll be tough, but better you go to them than they come to you. Good luck.|`|ZaIzN1Alaa	its better for you to tell them then they finding out i know|`|2CjVn4gpaa	Okay, no matter what, your ALWAYS gonna be knows as the gay kid.<br>  yor gay, it happens.<br>  <br>  It happened to me, i came out like what a year ago and i still to this<br>  day deal with asswipes that talk shitt.<br>  <br>  its part of gay life, its up to you wether its gonna bother you or not.<br>  its hard at first, but it does get alot easier.<br>  <br>  people will eventually start accepting that your gay and you wont<br>  be what everyones talking about anymore.<br>  <br>  Just give it time.<br>  <br>  And as for your parents, if your out at school, then you should <br>  be ready to come out to your parents.<br>  <br>  Just sit them down, or your mom at least and let her know that <br>  your ready to tell her that your are indeed gay.<br>  <br>  nooo biggie.<br>  <br>  Be the best gay you can be :D|`|rkC443vnaa	i hear u. i am not gay, but i am bisexual and know what your coming from. my school is SO homophobic,it's not even funny(i haven't told anyone but my friends...and i haven't told my parents). there's this one gay kid @ my school and he has NO friends, everyone hates him and likes to beat him up...it's so sad. :( but anyway, i say to deal with the homophobicness is to act like you don't care. be strong, don't let them know it gets to u. if people are rude and ask to many questions, politely tell them to go **** themselves! :)and if your friends are true, they will stick by you, and be there 4 ya. and as for your parents, set them down when there in the right mood, and simply tell them calmly. it'll work out. you have friends here on yahoo answers. *hugs* good luck!<br>  ?liza
8W3JAEazaa	I'd like to give a positive answer but to be honest, being a teen, I don't have much good to say about what it means.<br>  <br>  Especially where I live in the UK, and also in the USA, it means to be consistently blamed for everything and looked down upon all the time by society. I wonder why everyone seems to think that we're some kind of terrible generation that has mutated - we were raised and educated by LAST generation! <br>  <br>  It means to be considered scum, hopeless, perpetually pregnant and drunk all the time, stereotypically. It means being told by both the elderly and the middle aged that "we were never like that" and we're disgraceful, unintelligent, and also that all our qualification exams are "far, far easier than the ones we had to do". It means to be considered arrogant if we're intelligent and "typical" if we're less so. <br>  <br>  It means that our elders suspiciously overlook all the drugs and the riots of the '80s and other past eras, and consider us to be some kind of downhill trend of the human race.|`|RcBpbWKdaa	following the crowd and doing what everyone else is doing|`|691XsQOzaa	i DUNNO.  i JUST PLAY xbox all day

IwqTI7Rfaa	I  know it seems impossible right now, but law school is the most important thing.  It seems like you are trying to convince yourself you are not gay because it is so ingrained in you that being gay is wrong.  You are young, and your education (if you complete it) is going to give you the ability to live without struggles so you can later take the time to decide what you want for a lifestyle, who you want as a mate, or the money and health insurance to speak with a professional over these matters.  But you have to focus on the school right now.  If you're mom is acting as if nothing happened, she probably is not dwelling on it and just wants to move past it as well.  Things like this happen, it's embarrassing, and if your relationship is not one where you discuss this, you have to forget it.  It is unnecessary stress.|`|UOvzMYpWaa	whoa, nelly. Therapy does sound like the right idea. Good luck, you'll definitely need it.|`|aaRMPDIDaa	I would focus on your school work for now because that is what is most important.

1sRiR9jJaa	Hi. I am an English student learning to speak Spanish, and I have the same difficulties in learning. My advice is to read some short stories and try and work out what the words say. If there are any you don't know, look it up in the dictionary and write the new word that you have just learnt in your own "vocabulary book". Good luck xx|`|T5DbLLgQaa	Actually, broadening one's language skills is a very broad concept, it can be done in more than one ways at the same time which is highly recommended. You can NOT become better ONLY in one area e.g. speaking, you MUST improve your skills in ALL dimensions of the language!<br>  <br>  Learning language well requires being as active as possible and making the learning fun for yourself. Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:<br>  <br>  1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.<br>  <br>  2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.<br>  <br>  3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.<br>  <br>  The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry there is no easy way out with this, you must develop your skills in ALL these language "levels" or dimensions in order to reach better language skills!! <br>  <br>  Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!! English is practically EVERYWHERE these days, you just have to use your imagination to find it!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Mf7vu5Chaa	My friend is learning English.

It was so funny because me and him went and he put his hand up my skirt (to be funny) and we started making out and grinding...it turned into this huge like french kiss competition..pretty fun!   we totally owned.
0aN1xIxfaa	For the person scoffing at the spelling of 'mite' - that is old English for the coin of very least worth in Palestine in Jesus' day. It is correctly spelled 'mite' (Mark 12:41-44 King James Version).<br>  <br>  The idea about interest accruing over 2,000 years is missing the point, however. The principle is mentioned in 2 Corinthians 8:12: "For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have". Proportionately, the widow gave far more (of worth to God) than the large amounts of money offered by wealthy people, out of their excess. It's not about money. It's about honouring God with whatever we have. He rewards those who ensure that their left hand does not know what their right hand is doing (so to speak).|`|k3LbhASGaa	looks like I am gonna be rich when I get there,unless inflation is sky rocketing|`|gHSarVD1aa	There is a very important thing I would like to point out about your question. It is a wonderful example of how we completely distort and twist the Word of GOD into meaningless worldly garbage.<br>  <br>  Our monetary system is a man made fantasy world of placing value on man made kingdoms. For someone to even go as far as to think about the economics of the Widows Mites shows me the great truth of "Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks" <br>  <br>  The rich people gave a little bit of their wealth as a sacrifice to GOD. The widow gave all she had. She gave much more then the rich people ever would think of.<br>  <br>  Mar 12:44  For all [they] did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, [even] all her living.<br>  <br>  I wonder what would happen if all I had was a dollar and I sent it to the person on the Christian radio station. Do you think they would even know who I was? Or would the persons secretary open the letter and toss it into a 6 digit bank account? I doubt I would even get a computer generated reply.<br>  <br>  That's why I gave my 2 mites years ago. Because Jesus noticed.|`|sRsGTgqIaa	Spiritually, any time we put our energies into doing Gods Word we are creating blessings. It is for the good of everyone.

Q|`|wRBfUgI2aa	You read a couple of verses, then get things so screwed up.    1.  There was an earthquake when Jesus died.    2.  Jerusalem was laid out with grave sites on and in hills above parts of the city.    3.  When earthquakes or floods happen, it is not unusual to have dead bodies floating up or popping out of their graves.  Rolling down hill is not great shakes either.  Rocks do it all the time.    How many times have we heard of floods or earthquakes, but the dead popping up like toast is never brought up?  It happens, just is not mentioned normally in public society.
uky2nsh8aa	*gives you a hug*  homophobia derived from the christians when they took over rome i think, cause it was common in rome to have a male lover aside from one's wife, but they didn't like that. >.  to stop it, that's different. just ignore people. ignorance can't really be overcome with education. start organizations for it and stuff. ^_^|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Historically, the first place I have found a record of homophobia was in the Koran, written around 600 AD. No earlier writing expressed an anti-gay sentiment. (And that includes the Bible, which in its original languages, was not anti-gay).    During the Moorish occupation of the Iberian peninsula, certain Islamic ideas were adopted by European Christians. One of those was the idea that God disapproved of homosexuality. The other was the erroneous notion that Sodom was destroyed because of homosexuality. Thus was born homophobia. And like similar sicknesses, like racism and sexism, it is contagious, and only cured by education. The cure only works on the willing.|`|QYPyWgijaa	Dude,I feel the same way, homophobia comes from children learning not to accept the gay lifestlye from their parents or environment, those same kids grow up to be the homophobic people of the world. Some parents teach their kids to accept everyone, but thats just some. Homophobia is something that is learned and influence by our society and parents.    Some religions like Christianity also influence a lot of the homophobia in our society.
TeRr286raa	I would actually get to know someone first. Otherwise it's like any dating relationship- going up to someone you barely know and asking them out can be awkward and embarrassing for the both of you. Especially if the girl's straight.    Instead, become friends or friendly towards her. get to know what she likes and doesn't like- treat it as if she were a potential boyfriend. Then, when you know each other well enough, try figuring out if she's bi or lesbian. If so, then feel free to get closer- and if not, then at least you come out with a nice new friendship and you can continue searching around.    Hope this helps!|`|yXg1ojQoaa	for a more subtle approach- start off as trying to make a friend, it is best to sart a relationship if you know the person as a friend first, hang out, get some coffee, after a while maybe ask her about her sexual orientation.  but, if you just want to hit on her- be wary that you may come across as creepy so try to be as cool as you can. hit on a girl same way you'd hit on a guy, flirt a bit, make some physical contact and hope she flirts back.|`|H4bOkSTaaa	hey i asked a similar question not too long ago but really i have no problem getting women it's just the keeping them that sucks for me    the best answer i can give you is don't be afraid of straight girls they have to realize that they'll  be hit on at least once by a lesbian or bi girl if their hot     you shouldn't come off as too desperate that is not the type of person you want to come off as     so i guess maybe get involved in things or go to places where your kind of women hang ...so GOOD LUCK!!

Like Christianity.    When someone doubts their atheism it's usually because of emotions.. and a lot of the time the person usually stays atheist. We usually admit the slight possibility of divine interference, so that might also be a reason for someone to want to turn agnostic.    Weaknesses? I'm not sure sometimes it can be a sign of strength.      ______________________________________...    "to stop thinking and questioning is to be dead!    i feel agnosticism is the only reasonable view, as neither existence nor nonexistence of a 'god' can be proved..."    I'm atheist and the reason I find the word agnostic stupid is because it can be used to describe someone who says that there isn't any proof of fairies. I guess I can say that there are no such things as fairies but then someone like you can come along and say that well "agnosticism (related to fairies) is the only reasonable view, as neither the existence nor nonexistence of a fairy can't be proved.

If a person is unable to thoughtfully consider another position than the one they subscribe to and agree or disagree based upon reason, then that is bad.    However with matters of faith... it really comes down to what you believe in. I don't think a person should feel bad that their faith in xtianity/islam/atheism is unshaken because that's what they believe in. Faith is a difficult thing to quantify, if not an impossible thing to quantify, so the usual rules don't apply.     I'm an atheist for the most part as well.|`|T8X7mrtHaa	I can't help but insult some people with this, but...

FZKFLTyLaa	Her statement was clearly racist, and yes, Blacks can be just as racist an anyone else.  You, on the other hand, should not have flown off the handle.  Apologize, and go from there.
QqxZzvbAaa	this is just beautiful,thank you for sharing.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Very nice. You should submit it for publication somewhere.    God bless! You got HIS attention, I'm sure!|`|8UTdi5G0aa	Sorry, no.  Here is why:  (1) You seem to be trying to make regular verse, but your metre is irregular.  (2) You are trying to force a few rhymes that simply do not work.  (3) Stanza 2 does not make sense entirely.  By that I mean you seem to be trying to say something, but the grammar has failed you.  It needs a little adjustment from an 'English' view point.  (4) In stanza 3, you say "As His grace...", but it is not clear how you meant 'as' to be interpreted.  There does not seem to be a clause dependency associated with it.  Again, this is an English grammar issue.  Just needs a tiny bit of a tweak to get your meaning across.    Also, -- and this is not an actual error per se -- but in regular verse, one normally uses complete and correct punctuation throughout and initial caps on each line.    So it needs a rewrite for clarity and grammar.  Fix the rhymes or else choose blank verse instead.  Work on the metre.  (Try reading it out loud while snapping your fingers to help with that.)  Other than those, it is fine.  Keep at it.  Take care.|`|6RCHJQfQaa	Very good.  I like it.

nsZuZ1O9aa	It depends on what your looking for in a lover. Cancer's are very sweet and passionate, but they often feel insecure and may back out of relationships. Gemini are chatty and flirty, but can be kind of selfish. Leo are very bossy with most people, but once your close they would do anything for you. Aries are headstrong and fiery, but they are hard workers and would always stand up for their friends. Taurus is very romantic, sexy and they are great people, though they can be a bit selfish and stubborn.

GPQnyI0Daa	Many people believe that dying is the best way to conserve energy but whether it stops you thinking is something  not many people have returned to bear witness to.<br>  <br>  We assume you refer to live experience in which case it has been proven you cannot stop mind activity .Even in a coma it can be demonstrated that thoughts continue, not in a controllable way always but then do they ever?<br>  <br>  The  time honoured way of stilling or silencing the chatter box we all have in our heads is to practise the disciplines of meditation, possibly with fasting. This has the effect of focusing ones thoughts on a given objective including possibly the receptivity to new ideas, new concepts, new awareness, revelation from outside our own experience .<br>  <br>  It is also a wonderful therapy if only one can get over the loneliness barrier and not become a reclusive from it.<br>  Interaction with people is essential to meaningful existence.It also carries with it the vulnerability and danger of love and injury but also the rewards of happiness in social interaction.<br>  <br>  Aids to stillness are appropriate music, colours, environments, people,a comfy armchair or psychiatrists couch.

It IS possible to wrestle with these and shut them out, but it's very hard to do.<br>  <br>  Instead of trying to rule the mind with a rod of iron we can simply watch the thoughts as they arise and just let them go.

In that I mean emotional help.  If she were to spend only half an hour with each child every day that's 7 hours a day.  And that is only if they are all healthy.    How many times will she have to get up during the night with 8 babies!!  That does not include the other 6 young children she already has.  It is too much to ask of any mother even if there is a loving helpful spouse in the picture. This does not include trips to the doctor, buying clothes, feeding all those children.  What about sleeping arrangements for 14 kids???!!! With a 8 bedroom (one room for the mother)  house that is two children to a room.  With a 5 bedroom house that is at least 3 children to a bedroom.  That or one large domatory style room for all the babies.  I think she has a monumental task ahead or her that she is unprepared for and unable to handle.   She will not be able to work any provide any income which means she will require money from the state or federal governments. (that is us, the taxpayer)  I wish her children the best.

Killing a believer, unless he commits murder or 'spreads mischief on the land' is a sin. <br>  Also, there is confusion by the narrator of the hadith as to whether the above mentioned verse had been revealed or not.

Pj5ufRFPaa	WRONG SECTION!  But, as a mild racist I will answer.  Now first off cos it's important: I think America is the cesspool of the world, it is founded on a holocaust and everything about it makes me sick.  Secondly I have actually devloped racist opinions through extensive study, so ignorance is the wrong word.    Now, I am a racist because I do not like immigrants setting up a permanent home in a country of a differnt culture, I have no problem with temporary stuff cos they need money and jobs but after that i think they have a duty to return and help their own country, also I think permanent immigration destroys the original culture of a place eg America. But take my country, Ireland, in recent years we have seen mass immigration and because so many children are coming who dont speak English, they are exempt from learning Irish, our language in school and the teacher has to spend time teaching them English before teaching the rest of the class anything, and because so many of them are here permanently Irish is no onger rquired in many jobs where it was once and within five years it wil have been dropped entirely so I am being asked to drop my heritage for immigrants. Eventually my country will be as bland and culturelss as Amerca. I will not accept this, ever.|`|wdOD8Wbhaa	I admit that I'm SLIGHTLY racist; I don't really care for blacks and Hispanics. I think people like me have the right to feel however they want to. However, blacks don't deserve to be physically or verbally attacked for no good reason. I think racists should just keep their opinions to themselves. That's exactly what I do. Just because I don't like black people it doesn't necessarily mean I have to become a KKK member or a Nazi.

VRK2Kwdxaa	Early in the seventh century, forces of change were suddenly unleashed in the Arab world. The catalyst was a religious prophet called Mohammed, who galvanised the Arab world into unity and jolted it out of its isolation. Mohammed was born in Mecca about 570. Orphaned in his youth, he was brought up by an uncle as a trader. Eventually, he entered the service of a rich widow, whom he married, so ensuring himself a respectable and leisured career. As a trader, Mohammed came into contact with foreign merchants passing through Mecca. But there’s reason to suspect that the decisive aspects of his life were shaped less by these extraneous conditions than by his own introspective, brooding, ascetic spirit, which caused him to spend much of his time in prayer and meditation, often in the solitude of the desert. While the question of his own salvation may have been central to his spiritual searching, it’s likely that he was also troubled about the breakdown of traditional communal values and the moral laxity evident in Mecca.<br>  When Mohammed was about forty, he suddenly claimed that God — 'Allah' in Arabic — had spoken directly to him and named him his prophet. Throughout the rest of his life these revelations continued, gradually providing the key elements for a new religion. And they gave Mohammed his mission: he dedicated himself to convincing others that Allah had revealed through his prophet the way to righteousness, truth, and salvation.<br>  Mohammed insisted that almighty Allah requires complete submission to his will; the religion is thus called Islam, which means ‘submission to God’. Every true adherent of Islam, called a Muslim, must regulate his or her life so as to abide completely by the will of Allah as revealed to the Prophet and set down in the Koran. Those who believe in Allah and submit to his law will gain a happy life after death in a sensuous heaven; non-believers and the disobedient will be damned to eternal suffering in hell.<br>  For several years, Mohammed's preaching netted only a few converts in Mecca; in fact, Mohammed won many more enemies than followers. By 622, these enemies forced him to flee to Yathrib (later renamed Medina, which means ‘city of the Prophet’), north of Mecca. <br>  During his last years, the Prophet used his forces to compel other Arabs to accept his leadership, so that when he died in 632 he was the leader of a large and dedicated religious following. <br>  I hope this is of some help.|`|gZ0NPuleaa	Medina, Saudi Arabia<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Oops ,I forgot Medina was actually the place where they killed all the Jewish men in the city who wouldn't convert.

216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	The custom of saying "God bless you" after a sneeze was begun literally as a blessing. Pope Gregory the Great (540-604 AD) ascended to the Papacy just in time for the start of the plague (his successor succumbed to it). Gregory (who also invented the ever-popular Gregorian chant) called for litanies, processions and unceasing prayer for God's help and intercession. Columns marched through the streets chanting, "Kyrie Eleison" (Greek for "Lord have mercy"). When someone sneezed, they were immediately blessed ("God bless you!") in the hope that they would not subsequently develop the plague. All that prayer apparently worked, judging by how quickly the plague of 590 AD diminished. <br>  <br>  The connection of sneezing to the plague is not the first association of sneezing with death. According to Man, Myth, and Magic: The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Mythology, Religion and the Unknown, many cultures, even some in Europe, believe that sneezing expels the soul--the "breath of life"--from the body.  That doesn't seem too far-fetched when you realize that sneezing can send tiny particles speeding out of your nose at up to 100 miles per hour! <br>  <br>  We know today, of course, that when you sneeze, your heart doesn't stop, nor will your eyes pop out if you can keep them open (www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_30 4.html), nor does your soul get expelled. What does get expelled are hundreds upon thousands of microscopic germs. The current advice when you sneeze is to cover your mouth with your arm rather than your hand. That way, all those germs won't be on your hands when you touch the countless things you're going to touch in the course of the day (don't tell us; we don't want to know). <br>  <br>  There are many superstitions regarding sneezing, some of which you've already listed. But here are some of my favorites. <br>  <br>  Sneeze on Monday for health, <br>  Sneeze on Tuesday for wealth, <br>  Sneeze on Wednesday for a letter,  <br>  Sneeze on Thursday for something better, <br>  Sneeze on Friday for sorrow, <br>  Sneeze on Saturday, see your sweetheart tomorrow, <br>  Sneeze on Sunday, safety seek. <br>  <br>  One for sorrow <br>  Two for joy <br>  Three for a letter <br>  Four for a boy. <br>  Five for silver <br>  Six for gold <br>  Seven for a secret, never to be told. <br>  <br>  And lastly, a sneeze before breakfast is a sign that you will hear exciting news before the end of the day. <br>  <br>  nfd?|`|2N6oTOLQaa	According to Milhouse from the Simpsons, "when you sneeze that's your soul trying to escape, saying "God Bless you" crams it back in."|`|BUEp2B9gaa	A long time ago somenone told me that in the olden days, people thought that when you sneezed, you sneezed out your soul.  Saying "God bless you" in some way prevented that from happening or prevented a demon from coming in where your soul momentarily left or some nonsensse like that.|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	It originated when it was determined that your heart actually stops for that mini-second that you sneeze.  The fact that it keeps beating after your sneeze is supposed to be a blessing to you.|`|8cb155d3453a69c18555f503c5705ab4aa	I'm fairly certain that it is because your heart actually stops for a second, or skips a beat, or something very much like that.I'm no expert, maybe you should check out webmd.com.

What happened to GOD bless you? :)|`|yfIOqSrpaa	One traditional explanation for the custom is that it began literally as a blessing. Pope Gregory I the Great (AD 540-604) ascended to the Papacy just in time for the start of the bubonic plague in AD 590 (his successor succumbed to it). To combat the plague, Gregory ordered litanies, processions, and unceasing prayer for God's blessing. When someone sneezed (seen as the initial onset of the plague), they were immediately blessed ("God bless you!") in the hope that they would not actually develop the disease.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Superstition<br>  Other explanations are based on superstitions and urban legends about sneezing and what a sneeze entails. Some well known superstitions that may have contributed to bringing "bless you" into common use are:<br>  <br>  Oxford University Biology Professor, Bindi Perkins suggests: When you need to sneeze, it helps to look at a brighter light or at the sun. Looking at a bright light or at the sun can direct light up into the nasal cavity which in-turn reflects light from the dust particles up into your cerebral membrane. It is here that the sneezing mechanism is triggered.<br>  <br>  The belief that the heart stops when you sneeze, and the phrase "bless you" is meant to ensure the return of life or to encourage your heart to continue beating. (Of course, the heart beats because of electrical pulses that are not affected by normal functions like sneezing.)<br>  <br>  According to Jamie Hay (2007): A sneeze is the expulsion of some sort of evil, and the phrase is meant to ward off the evil's re-entry. Due to this some people believe that it is unlucky to say thank you, as this allows the evil to return. In Ireland if you say 'Thank you' a leprechaun dies. In other countries a fairy dies.<br>  Your soul can be thrown from your body when you sneeze, and saying "bless you" prevents your soul from being stolen by Satan or some evil spirit. Thus, "bless you" or "God bless you" is used as a sort of shield against evil.<br>  A sneeze is good luck and saying "bless you" is no more than recognition of the sneezer's luckiness.<br>  In his latest book, sneezing expert Justin Frankel (2007), speculates Flatulating, Burping and Sneezing all at the same time results in the sudden onset of death.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, it may be possible that the phrase began simply as a response for an event that wasn't well understood at the time.<br>  <br>  Another urban legend states that you cannot open your eyes while you sneeze, or if you manage to your eyes will pop out. During a sneeze the impulses travel through your face causing your eyelids to blink, this response is entirely automatic.<br>  <br>  In many English-speaking countries, the German equivalent, gesundheit (which means "good health"), is used after sneezing or coughing.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Alternative intent<br>  One other usage of the phrase "Bless you" in response to a sneeze is to bless or thank a person who sneezes but covers his or her mouth and nose with a tissue, handerkerchief, sleeve, or even a hand (hopefully then washing the hands before touching shared items) as an act of concern and courtesy to others, in order to avoid spreading the germs expelled so as not to sicken other people. Presumably, a person who fails to demonstrate such concern and courtesy by not covering the mouth and nose during a sneeze would not be blessed or thanked.|`|lMSDlLy7aa	I dno about blessing but Im bulgarian and we say Наздраве which means Cheers when someone sneezes :P:P
