One of them is mine which is potty trained but the other is a new puppy which isn't potty trained. The apartment is starting to smell bad and I don't know what to do about it. I work 6 days a week and when I come home and walk through the door I get that first whiff of bad smell and it is starting to drive me crazy. I don't like using the spary air freshners because it makes me sneeze but I'd like some solution to first possibly try and eliminate some or all of the odors and 2. have something that will keep the apartment smelling fresh at all times...what can I do? Also, before we got the new puppy it still smelled bad so its not all because of the pup. Our garbage disposal smelled like throw up from the second we got there and I've tried everything to try and get that to smell good. PLEASE! Can someone help me. I'd like to come home from work someday and not feel like I have to clean so it can smell good.

Here's what I've used so far rated best to worst:      1. Benjamin Moore Regal (eggshell) was to shiny and was told anything less than eggshell wouldn't be scrubbable       2.Porter Hi-Hide (eggshell) went on good and good sheen but not very scrubbable.      3.Benjamin Moore Aura (matte) great finished product but dries way to fast.  Extra money for extra work      4.Valspar Kitchen and Bath (semi gloss) kept wanting to run      5.Valspar Signature Colors (semi gloss) same as the Kitchen and Bath      6. Kilz Casual Colors (eggshell) paint came off with the blue tape      7. Dutch Boy (satin) incredibly easy to mark up and terrible touch up      I'm thinking of trying Sherwin Williams Duration or Cashmere.  Or maybe Porter Silken Touch.  Have you used any of these?

Besides the cutting width being different, one has a Briggs and Stratton engine and the other has a Tecumseh engine. The HP is about the same, so my only concern is the engine brand. My current lawn mower is 14 years old and it has a B&S engine in it. Never had too many problems with it. Which one is better? Is Tecumseh a good engine nowadays? The mower with the Tecumseh engine is $100 less, so if it's reliable, then I might go with it. Thanks!
