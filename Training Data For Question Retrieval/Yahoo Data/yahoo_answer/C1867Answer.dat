itBRFtwnaa	If you are replacing the hard drive, then yes, you will have to reinstall Vista. Whether or not you have to buy a new copy depends on the license you have for it. If it is a retail version, then you can just reinstall it, but if it is OEM, then you will probably have to buy a new one. If you buy a new one, OEM is cheaper, but you can only install it on one computer, retail can go in multiple computers but is more expensive. as an alternative, you could buy an external hard drive (if you dont already have one) as well as the new one so that you can create a mirror image of your system. to do this, you will have to go to the back up and restore center and back up your system to the external hard drive. (be sure to include the option "include system image"). Then all you have to do when you get the new HDD is go inot the BIOS and set it to boot from the external drive.if you need more help, email me. Hope this helps.|`|FnDuZxcVaa	Yes...and yes, you will need to buy the OS (or search torrent sites for a copy).|`|imziSPonaa	I would believe that you can use the current OS on the new HD.<br>  <br>  Did the old HD die?  I would say that OS manufacturers do not expect you to buy a new copy of the OS if your HD dies.<br>  <br>  Even if you are just getting a larger HD I would use the OS that came with the system.

zorYTX59aa	There are a few things you should be aware of when you<br>  label your videos: "tags" are only the 3rd most important <br>  element in YouTube's search-results. Words in the titles <br>  are 1st, and words in the descriptions are 2nd.<br>  <br>  And way in front of those three different variables is your <br>  YouTube username. Thus, tags are actually in 4th place,<br>  and as such are the least important element in a search.<br>  <br>  (Whenever you do a search, how often do you get videos <br>  at the top of those results with no matching words in the <br>  username, video titles, or descriptions? Just about never.  <br>  If you ever do get results like that with no matches at all,<br>  those are the times when 'tags' are relevant in a search.)<br>  <br>  Thus if you would like your videos to appear near the top <br>  of search results, the ideal would be to have people type <br>  in your username first followed by the title of one of your <br>  videos -- if not some of the most unique words.<br>  <br>  Also, you'll get better results by typing in your video title <br>  within double "quoteation marks".|`|idNLewPDaa	here's a way to get 100 views daily, actually works too.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwazRUEhjpU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwazRUEhj...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  that will make it more popular, and show up in search results.|`|RQ0okZ1Baa	Did you check and see if you tagged it correctly?..

A router is the best choice especially for on-line gaming and you want to use them both at the same time.

lQWVZo9naa	I'm not sure you understand what port forwarding is. To find out what router you're actually connected to hold open your command prompt (windows+r then type cmd and press enter) and type ipconfig and hit enter. Look for something that says 'default gateway' and type the ip address into your web browser to access it. Then, depending on what type of router you have (Linksys or DLink) follow the appropriate tutorial at <a href="http://www.portforward.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.portforward.com.</a> I hope this helps!|`|3LHsCLVFaa	You are really mixed up, there are local ip's and public ip's. There are dynamic and static ip's. Those that are local are dynamically assigned and become static unless the device is disconnected. When ports are forwarded. They are passed to the public ip, which can be either dynamic or static. If the public ip is dynamic, it is possible that you will have to pass the port a new address everytime you turn around. So passing a port is best with a static public ip. This is the IP you see if you type myip in the search engine. All of this amount to nothing because it will not help your peer program to run any faster.

Also there are no complicated installations all you need is a computer with internet and you can fax to anywhere and anytime.|`|zoptablFaa	Using an online fax service is a great way to go.  You can send faxes to traditional fax machines from your computer.  You can also receive faxes from traditional fax machines.  The way it works is that the fax is sent through the internet as an e-mail attachment.  If you are sending an internet fax, the fax is sent as an e-mail attachment.  It goes to the online fax service, who then send it on to the traditional fax machine through the phone lines.  When you sign up for the online fax service, they will give you a fax number that those with traditional fax machines can send faxes to.  The fax travels to the online fax service through the phone line, then they send it on to you through e-mail.  It will be waiting in your inbox when you log on.  No more worrying about missing faxes because the fax machine was off.  No more busy signals. No more paper jams.  No more need for a separate dedicated phone line.  No more fax machine service or maintenance.  You will save time and money with internet fax.  Here is a link to an article that has some tips for picking and internet fax service provider.  <a href="http://onlinefaxservice.blogspot.com/2009/03/choosing-internet-faxing-service.html" rel="nofollow">http://onlinefaxservice.blogspot.com/200...</a><br>  Many internet fax services offer free trials, so you should give it a try and see what you think.

z46THMt8aa	There is a very good reason for that. Ink is a lubricant for the heads. Even if you print in black, some color is used. Otherwise the friction would cause the color heads to burn out. Also, if there isn't ink circulating in the heads, the residue would dry up and the heads would become irreparably clogged. So unless you like to keep buying new printers, make sure you never run out of any color. Also make sure you leave the printer on (it takes very little power) or at least turn it on once a day to circulate the ink and keep it from clogging.<br>  <br>  The biggest complaint about all inkjets is the high cost of ink cartridges. <a href="http://ccs-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http://ccs-digital.com</a> has cartridges for about $4.50 each. They also have a unique product - a two-piece cartridge where the ink is in a separate tank inside the cartridge. When the ink runs out, you replace just the ink tank and the original chip resets itself to full.  By keeping the same chip, you save 1.50 per cartridge. Ink tanks are only $3 and hold 50% more ink than disposable cartridges.|`|AA11296044	You will get constant low ink warnings - however yes you can.<br>  <br>  You always need a color cartridge installed, however if that catridge is empty the printer will still work, however nag you constnatly about the issue.|`|E3WLVaheaa	Sometimes if you leave the ink cartridge inside the printer it will still print, if this is not the case possibly just refill the ink instead of paying 20 for a new ink cartridge

wt07QYyzaa	This will happen with any compiler.<br>  <br>  The program you are running is a command line program.  When you run it, the operating system will open up the command prompt, carry out the program, and then close the command prompt immediately, which doesn't give you much time to see your program.  Do one of two things:<br>  <br>  1) Open up a command prompt and run your program from there.<br>  <br>  2) Or, you could write code at the end of your program that asks for user input (like typing in a letter).  To do this you could insert the following code before the main function ends:<br>  <br>  int n;<br>  cin>>n;<br>  <br>  This will make your program wait for you to enter a letter or number before the command prompt window closes.|`|dfjIBHe3aa	What happens is the simple programs run in the DOS shell.  You can open the DOS shell and run them from the command line (like the good old days) or you can keep it running.  The above answers are good for C++ but there is an old C function system() which you can also use.  It's in cstlib.  It calls an external program, and in the DOS operating system there is a program called pause.exe which prints the slogan "press any key" and waits for you to hit a key before terminating, so putting "system("pause");" before "return 0;" will give you a few seconds to read the output before the DOS shell which you called by clicking on the program terminates.|`|xDom6mr3aa	try entering something like at the end: <br>  <br>  "<br>  int exit;<br>  std::cin >> exit;<br>  return 1;<br>  "<br>  <br>  that will force you to enter an int before it ends, thats assuming that you are using <iostream>  its probably running, and terminating so fast you cant see whats happening :o)<br>  <br>  If you list your code I'll look at it for you. :o)

But C++ is the  one use in making comercial games. C++ I use SDL for making 2D games, would use opengl for 3D games or a game engine,|`|Kz6Dmv2Oaa	I'd say you are bang on track language-wise. <br>  Most commercial video games are written in C++ , with other languages like Python used for scripting. <br>  Java is used to write games for mobile (cell) phones. It is currently too slow to be used for the large console games. Having said that, each new version of Java is getting faster, so I'm betting that it will eventually replace C++ in years to come. HTML is essential for web based games. It might also be worth your while to learn Javascript as well. It is used to add interactivity to web pages and therefore for web games. It has syntax similar to java (hence its name) so you shouldn't find it hard to learn.<br>  w3schools.com is a good place to learn javascript aswell as HTML and CSS because they set the standards for them.<br>  <br>  For graphics, it depends how high end a game you want to make. Professional games companies use Autodesk 3ds max (3D Studio Max) or Maya for 3D modelling and photoshop for 2D graphics editing but they have teams of people to do this sort of thing. You can use whatever you feel comfortable with.

Every pc over time, will require routine maintenance to optimize pc performance and to avoid registry processing errors.The registry is a directory of system settings and options. As modifications are made to the pc configuration in the framework of hardware and software additions or upgrades, the registry is altered. Sometimes these alterations may clash with the current system. As a result, your pc performance suffers and a registry repair is the only option.<br>  <br>  As time goes by, registry changes accumulate. There is significant risk of incompatibilities between the file processing.

vCQ7HuLuaa	Ok, when you downloaded it, what you downloaded was a package, with Firefox inside. As you rightly guessed, when you open that package, you need to drag Firefox over to your Applications folder. When you have done this, you can get rid of that package. Go to your desktop and drag that Firefox icon to the trash. It will 'eject' it, that's fine. <br>  <br>  Next, you need to go to your applications folder, and find Firefox. That's the actual application Firefox. Double-click that, and it will start without all that extra window nonsense you are currently experiencing.<br>  <br>  So that you don't have to keep going into your applications folder to start Firefox, click the Firefox logo that appears in your dock when it is open, and hold it. An extra menu will appear, go up that menu and highlight 'Keep in dock'.<br>  You will now be able to start Firefox from the dock in future, even when you do restart your computer.

fE7zhp3Caa	You're link is broken, so no luck on seeing it.<br>  <br>  The blue port with a picture of a monitor under it is called a VGA port.  The AGP slot (it's sometimes called a port, but it's easier to think of it as a slot instead) is inside your computer, and the card with the VGA port on it will be inserted in that slot, provided you're not using onboard video or a PCI video card.  If you are using onboard or PCI video, then the AGP slot will be the empty slot closest to the processor (your system can have more than one PCI slot but only one AGP).  It's usually brown and closer to the back of the case than any other slots, although many retail boards will have a wide range of color combinations.  It might also have a green plastic retention clip around it for locking in a card.<br>  <br>  There are half-height AGP cards out there, but none with 256MB video RAM will work with a 175 watt power supply.  Most bus-powered (powered through the slot) AGP cards will need at least a 350 watt power supply or the system won't power up.  You would need to upgrade your power supply first, and the problem with a low-profile case is that you'll spend a lot more on a power supply because you have a non-standard size.  Compaq usually complicates things further by going with power supplies you can't find anywhere else.  Unfortunately that means you might not be able to upgrade without spending more than you'd like.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Okay, that's onboard video.  The AGP slot is probably behind that vertical metal plate almost in the middle.  You'll need to open the case to remove that plate and install an AGP video card.  But it looks like your power supply (the large vented panel to the right of that plate) is not standard.  I have no idea what kind of prices you'd be looking at to replace it, but I can almost guarantee you they'll be much higher than a standard power supply with the same wattage.<br>  <br>  Compaq may offer power supply upgrades, but you might be better off replacing the whole system rather than trying to string this proprietary nightmare along.  It just won't be worth the extra time or money.<br>  [/edit]

If you haven't done that yet, you need to before you can actually use the drive. Most operating systems come with generic drivers that should work with most drives, but occasionally, you'll need to actually install the drivers from the manufacturer. If you have a driver installation CD, use it. If not, download the drivers from the manufacturer's website.<br>  <br>  If you're certain that you have working drivers, however, then it would be a good idea to check for any physical damage to the drive. Clean the laser with an alcohol solution, make sure it's connected correctly, clean the disc if necessary (probably not necessary if it's new though) and try again afterwards.<br>  <br>  If it still doesn't work, try updating the firmware. As always, do so at your own risk (if it's not working though, you don't really have anything to lose). If that still doesn't help, then it may be time to buy a new drive.|`|lrVbZdSDaa	Do other CDs load?  If not your CD drive is almost certainly bad.<br>  <br>  If that's the case, don't worry too much, they're fairly cheap.<br>  <br>  I personally have found that the cheapest you can get would be $20 ones from Newegg.com which are cd/dvd burners, with relatively positive reviews.  If you don't trust yourself to install it, bring it into a computer repair shop or call them and ask about it.<br>  <br>  If it loads other CDs on occasion try opening the tray and closing it several times.  Letting your CD sit there for 20 minutes won't do anything.<br>  <br>  Every time you close the tray it searches the disc to see if detects anything new.  If yours is totally broken, it won't even finish with that, but it stops trying to the second it realizes there's nothing it can read.<br>  <br>  And make sure that after you put the cd into your computer go into My Computer and see if the CD shows up there.  If it does then your drive is likely fine and you just have autoplay turned off.

In most cases, any laptop (again, not just Macs) will last even 5 to 6 years, but by then your laptop will probably be considered "obsolete."<br>  <br>  It is a myth that Macs last longer than Windows laptops. Macs may have nice casings on the outside, but they use the exact same internals as Windows computers do. Macs don't have extra-resilient hard drives. Their hard drives are the same hard drives other laptops have. Their RAM sticks are the same RAM sticks other laptops have (except more expensive).<br>  <br>  The one nice thing from a physical abuse perspective that Macbooks have is the magnetic power cord.

No internal DVD or CD system.<br>  6. 12" - 14" TFT screen.<br>  7. Low profile (thin).<br>  8. Integrated modem and network connection.<br>  9.

That is, a CD ROM drive is either built into the unit or the unit has a built-in bay that will accommodate a removable CD ROM drive. <br>  <br>  Notebook computers will allow you to attach, via cable, a CD ROM drive. ( Not always as I have one of HCL )Since the drive is not built into the unit, notebooks are smaller and lighter than laptops. Hence, a notebook is an ultra small laptop. Another way to look at it is a notebook is about the size (or a little larger than) of a real [binder] notebook.If you use note books are more harder than laptops as my laptop's system dead twice but note book not. <br>  <br>  <br>  Deskbook computers often refer to mobile computers that can be considered as desktop replacement units. Deskbooks tend to be larger and heavier than average notebook/laptop computers. Generally the display units are 15 inches or larger. They tend to draw down battery power relatively quickly due to their powerful, but power-hungry, processors. If you are looking for the power of a desktop unit, with the freedom of mobility, then a deskbook may fit the bill. <br>  <br>  Tablet PCs are mobile computers with a twist. That is, you can literally twist the monitor. Being a Tablet means that the display screen will swivel on its base - usually 360 degrees.

If you're going to be recording one channel of audio at a time, from a microphone or line-in input (like electric guitar, for example), and nothing more, a 1 or 2 GHz processor, lots of RAM, and a gigantic hard drive are all you really need.<br>  <br>  But if you're going to be doing any effects or soft synths and plan on doing large projects with dozens of channels, then you might want to look for a dual or quad-core processor.  Some programs, like Digidesigns Pro Tools, use a separate DSP (digital signal processing) device for hardware mixing and processing certain effects.  Pro Tools M-Powered uses a USB device called an MBox for handling inputs and outputs.  Their higher end options, Pro Tools LE and Pro Tools HD, use special DSP cards that tackle all the audio-related processing and thus don't work with standard sound cards.<br>  <br>  Another thing is that not all music creation programs will work on a 64-bit OS.  Cakewalk SONAR is the only one I know of for sure.<br>  <br>  Regardless of what program you decide to use, having a multicore processor with at least 2GB of RAM for Windows XP and a generous amount of hard drive space will work for nearly all options.  I'm running Ableton Live 6 on a custom built AMD Opteron 2.4GHz (dual-core) XP system with 2GB of dual-channel RAM and approximately 460GB of hard drive space and have no real problems.<br>  <br>  Another thing to keep in mind is the video card.  If you plan on using a dual-monitor set up or a huge wide-screen, you'll want a decent video card so it can keep up with all the data being displayed.  Most audio software will start experiencing audio lag when the video chokes.  A 128MB or larger video card should be sufficient, but try to shop for 256MB and up if you can afford it.|`|vhKIBwjUaa	Start with a mac. Not an imac as you can't customize them.

Or you could spend way too much time trying build a device that would interpet one controllers signals to the other systems. It would involve either hard wiring it or making your own wireless device.

24kFbAdsaa	What you are asking for may not be available for $5k unless you are talking about a lease.<br>  <br>  Our church leases a RISO HC-5500 high speed color printer.  We will add the scanner option later.  It has very large capacity ink cartridges (about 1 pint for each of 4 colors).  It's about the size of a medium chest freezer.  It can be networked, also.  We got it because we only pay for the ink and paper (above the monthly lease).  I'm sure there are other brands and models that may work better for you.<br>  <br>  Watch out for hidden costs; make a thorough evaluation of any offers.  Our other lease charged us about 12c per page for color copies.  The entire document was treated as a color document even though one page had color and the rest were B/W.  So those B/W pages were charged at the same page rate as color.  If the entire document was B/W, then is was 3c per page.

For example, you can't connect an IDE cable (one of those thin, wide ribbon cables) to a SATA hard drive (which uses much skinnier cables). Similarly, you can't connect a SATA cable to an IDE hard drive. Each drive also take a different power connector. However, SATA and IDE are the only two types of hard drives you should be looking at, and the connectors for both power and data are standardized, so that makes things a good bit simpler.<br>  <br>  If you need to check to see what cables/ports you have available, here are some pictures to give you an idea of what they look like:<br>  <br>  IDE (the long green one) and SATA (the short orange ones) ports: <a href="http://i.neoseeker.com/neo_image/155593/article/gaigabyte_ga_p35dq6/ide%20port_thumb.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.neoseeker.com/neo_image/155593/...</a><br>  IDE data cable: <a href="http://www.gshop.com.au/images/ide_133_cable.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.gshop.com.au/images/ide_133_c...</a><br>  SATA data cable: <a href="http://img.alibaba.com/photo/11220704/Sata_Cable.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.alibaba.com/photo/11220704/Sa...</a><br>  IDE power cable (also known as a molex connector): <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Molex_female_connector.jpg/800px-Molex_female_connector.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  SATA power cable: <a href="http://www.askkia.com/articles/images/sata15pin.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.askkia.com/articles/images/sa...</a>|`|MxculX2Daa	Any hard drive will work so long as it is the right controller type.<br>  The two you need to choose between are SATA and IDE/ATA<br>  <br>  SATA drives have 2 small connectors with metal contacts and 2 slim cables.

AA10464818	The rule, as always, is to stay away from those that ask you to pay before you can get these surveys. <br>  <br>  Legitimate market survey companies such as Pinecone Research recruit members based on demographic characteristics -- e.g. mothers of babies 0-12 years old -- and will send surveys of products and services targeting this demographic group. Pinecone Research, however, pays only $5 per survey -- you're definitely not going to be rich with that. They can give you anywhere from 1-5 at most surveys in a month. <br>  <br>  Other companies simply ask you to answer as many research as possible, and you don't earn anything just the chance to win at a raffle (which I find lame).<br>  <br>  Pinecone Research <a href="http://www.pineconeresearch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pineconeresearch.com</a><br>  GreenField Online <a href="http://www.greenfieldonline.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.greenfieldonline.com</a> <br>  Harris Poll Online <a href="http://www.harrispollonline.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.harrispollonline.com</a>  <br>  BuzzBack <a href="http://www.buzzback.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.buzzback.com</a>  <br>  SurveySite <a href="http://www.surveysite.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.surveysite.com</a> <br>  SurveySavvy <a href="http://www.surveysavvy.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.surveysavvy.com</a><br>  Survey Spot <a href="http://www.surveyspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.surveyspot.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.internetpaidsurveys.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.internetpaidsurveys.com/</a>|`|hXHBm1BSaa	Yes, all of them.|`|SJbX1SVKaa	There are tons of such scams, but there are legitimate ones you can make small amounts of cash from as well. Beware of anything that asks for too much personal information, or money up front. There are also websites that for example pay you to refer others into it or will just sell you a list with "legitimate" sites. Those will normally not be worth the trouble. <br>  <br>  I believe the list here contains mostly legitimate companies:|`|WaQNza9Maa	If you take a survey in person, and they say they will give you cash once your done, then I guess its not a scam, but if its one of those give us your credit card number so we can send you a couple of dollars, and hope you don't mind if we borrow a couple thousand....  then don't do it.

First of all, they don't pay you what they promise at the time they want to hook you up. Second, during the process of answering the surveys -which by the way, some of them are very long, you're asked to buy certain things, like online courses or consumer items, and to do that they ask you for your credit or debit card (at this point things start to get complicated, because you have to deal with the privacy and identity preservation issues). Third, some of those companies out there don't even pay you with real money, but with "points" which you have to accumulate and eventually, if you reach certain level, you could redeem for goods.|`|lQ35kPPGaa	Ever free survey for cash is a scam<br>  <br>  any legit survey for cash service that pops up gets raped by bots programmed to create fake accounts and to faill out surveys.|`|f5IlblGAaa	It's not a scam.

Often you would receive new products as a result. In some cities, marketing survey companies will contact their database online when they have a particular survey where you meet the criteria and pay you to come in and take them.<br>  <br>  Today, the Internet has revolutionized paid surveys taking and it allows marketing research companies to reach a broader audience. From the consumer side, someone with some time and a little patience can learn to take surveys at several different sites and make a little extra cash.<br>  <br>  One of the reasons taking paid surveys online works well is because everyone uses products all the time. You have your favorites of everything from cars to movies. There are companies that value your opinion about these things and they don’t mind paying to get the information.<br>  <br>  Most survey sites are contacted by these companies when they have a particular product or new product to test. Instead of spending the money to bring in a focus group of people or many people to test a given product, the Internet allows them to find more people in a quicker amount of time.<br>  <br>  As the consumer, all you have to do is go to the various sites, register with them, and then begin to receive surveys. Some send you several a day, others send you a few a month and still others. Well you get the picture.<br>  <br>  Your opinions and decisions about new products will influence whether the new product is made. Your opinion will also help them make decisions about the packaging, the wording on the package or the colors that each product will come in.<br>  <br>  The nice thing about surveys is you can take as many or as few as you want. If you decide you don’t like doing surveys for a particular company, you can back out with no obligation. Sometimes you may get into paid surveys and decide not to finish it; that’s okay, you just won’t get paid for that particular one.<br>  <br>  Another thing you should know is that sometimes you will be asked not to reveal any information about certain products. They will ask you to sign a statement — usually printing something like I AGREE in a box on the site to let them know that you won’t say anything to anyone. This is one way that they insure that new products won’t hit the market before they are ready. These are also paid surveys.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking paid surveys will pay between $1 and $5 on the average. Some of them will be worth points that will accumulate for gift certificates or other merchandise and some will enter the consumer in sweepstakes. All of them are fun to take. <br>  <br>  Ok so where do you find the legitimate paid surveys right? this ones easy I use <a href="http://www.theguruseye.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguruseye.com</a> .  This site has a detailed review of legitimate paid survey sites along with video reviews, video tutorials, and even free tools to take paid surveys faster. So what are you waiting for?

VgIBEANxaa	Despite the fact you send me an email saying you are mentally ill, you're in an IT class now?  Sounds like you're just struggling in school.  Also, I'm only 22, not an old man, but I'll help you anyway since you obviously need it.<br>  <br>  The computer case, is the part of the computer that houses all the components of the computer aside from the peripherals (monitor, keyboard, mouse, speakers.  You know what a keyboard is, right?)  It is sometimes called the tower or chassis (pronounced chass-ee) because inside the case is a metal frame to hold everything in place.  Some people mistakenly call the case the CPU or hard drive, but these are both parts inside the case, CPU being the central processing unit, and hard drive being a mass storage device.<br>  <br>  Yahoo! Answers is a good place for answers to questions that are hard to find in a general search, but if all these computer questions are for a class I suggest you study your books.  If these things are not in your books, you should talk to your teacher about whether you have the PC (personal computer) experience to be in the class.  Knowing your own aptitude is important in higher level education, as well as knowing how to do basic internet searches.  For example, a simple google search for "computer case wiki" turns up this as the first result:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_case" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_case</a><br>  It even has pictures.|`|H3Va1OKqaa	You mean the Chassis?<br>  <br>  It's what you screw the motherboard into and is what holds the motherboard and all your peripherals.|`|itBRFtwnaa	a computer case is what houses all of the computer's components.its just the metal (or plastic) shell. it has no electronic components. it is what all the parts are mounted to. here is a pic of one...<br>  <a href="https://mxmachines.com/shop/images/antec900.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://mxmachines.com/shop/images/antec...</a><br>  (just copy and paste it into your browser<br>  there is nothing inside of it and if you press the power button, nothing happens.

vAAGriFkaa	sounds like you are using wrong drivers. try downloading the latest 100% compatible drivers to your card from nvidia's website.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, then maybe your computer is using your onboard video card (if you have one) and that's why he is saying that the drivers are not compatible.<br>  If that's the case, you change the definitions in the bios to use the PCI express slot instead of the onboard card.<br>  also make sure the card is well seated in its' slot.
8KcsyJceaa	500 watts should be enough. When it comes to power supplies, the main thing that you want to keep in mind is the wattage. You should always make sure that you have a little bit more "amounts" of wattage provided by the power supply than the amount of wattage that the computer itself is taking up, just in case you ever decide to upgrade more parts. <br>  <br>  As far as pins are concerned, you need to pay attention to what kinds of connectors are on your drives -- i.e., your hard drive, CD/DVD-ROM drive, floppy drive, etc. They will either have molex connectors (see this link to see a picture: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molex)," rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molex),</a> or SATA connectors (see this link for an example: <a href="http://img.tomshardware.com/us/2005/02/28/strong_showing/nexus_sata.jpg)." rel="nofollow">http://img.tomshardware.com/us/2005/02/2...</a> You want to get a power supply that has the types of cables that you need. Also, pay attention to how many of each cable it comes with.<br>  <br>  Another thing to keep in mind is the size of the power supply itself. This is called form factor, and the most common form factor is ATX. Chances are, your computer case is ATX. Make sure that the power supply is ATX, or whatever the form factor of your case is as well. ATX power supplies are usually universal as far as size is concerned. <br>  <br>  If you weren't aware, some good websites to order power supplies from are: www.newegg.com and www.tigerdirect.com. I personally use Newegg the most. It's good if you want reviews and very detailed specifications. Always look to see what other people thought about the power supply in question; that should help you when you are choosing which one you want to purchase. <br>  <br>  That's all I can think of for now; hope that helps.|`|SJM0rzHtaa	Try those upgrades on your existing power supply.  I'm willing to bet it will work just fine.<br>  <br>  The 8600 series of cards don't draw much power--  Note the 8600GT and 8600GS don't even have a 6-pin power connector.  Only PCIExpress video cards that draw more than 75 watts of electrical power are required to have the 6-pin that must be connected to your PSU.  The 8600GT and GS both draw under 75 watts.  The only 8600 that draws more than 75W is the 8600GTS, and it has the 6-pin.<br>  <br>  And RAM doesn't draw much power either.  Under 10 watts per DIMM.<br>  <br>  The 8600 series of cards are designed precisely to work with lower-power PSUs.|`|3JTuL6vOaa	here is a good psu I bought one and I dont think I will have to upgrade for quite some time.<br>  <a href="http://www.ewiz.com/detail.php?p=PS-CUQ950B&c=pw" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewiz.com/detail.php?p=PS-CUQ9...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mcmelectronics.com/product/58-12235" rel="nofollow">http://www.mcmelectronics.com/product/58...</a><br>  the second one is a little less expensive but its not modular and only 550w. modular is better you only use the cords you need and not all that wire trash to slow air flow in your case good luck.

If they are dumb switches (no management capabilities) you will be stuck with pulling a cable at a time until you find the culprit.<br>  <br>  And technically, I don't think that is a broadcast storm, although the symptoms are similar.

Is really lightweight (1.7 pounds approx.) and comes with two configurations: Linux or Windows XP. With Linux, the netbook will have 8GB of hard drive and 512mb of ram. But with XP, the netbook comes with 1GB of RAM and 120 or 160GB hard rive. It have 5-1 card reader, WI-FI, webcam, microphone and a Intel Atom processor, the smallest in the market.With Windows XP, the battery last for 3-5 hours. The Aspire One doesn't have cd drive, but you can get a USB DVD drive for about $50. Is available for about $300-$400 depending on the configuration.<br>  <br>  Personally, I recommend you this netbook if you already have a larger computer, because this netbook is made for traveling and have a 8.9 inch screen.

As long as the signal comes from outside.

2gzfW5TXaa	it could be some sort of device, like a mobile phone, ipod, or games console which you've connected to your internet with. If not, someone has most likely hacked your password protection. Like the above person said, you could change it to WPA if it's WEP, but MAC Adress Filtering works like a charm. Find the computer and copy the numbers into the form below, and make sure it says to deny the following users access (you don't want to allow only them to access your connection!), and turn the filtering on. Hope that works =)|`|YXgVGjHlaa	If the user bothers you, have your password changed.  I don't know how someone can use your signal without knowing the password unless you have given it to someone. Then again, you might think it is set up as protected and it might not be.  You might check that out or have someone who can take a look at it.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	WEP passwords are fairly easy to crack.

NjnU2DVWaa	No computer is crash-proof, but the Mac operating system is pretty solid.  I've never even had to restart mine due to a program freezing.  No more "Ctrl-alt-del until it restarts".  ;)  There aren't nearly as many viruses out there for Macs as there are for PCs.  The system itself is more secure.  If your Mac gets a virus, it's probably because you downloaded it yourself from Limewire or opened an e-mail attachment you shouldn't have.  Those Windows viruses that you see warnings about going around.... even if you get an e-mail with those Windows viruses, it won't affect your Mac.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	It crashes about as often Windows or Linux does - that is, rarely.<br>  <br>  No operating system is foolproof.<br>  <br>  And Macs do not magically get viruses, as they have a proper privilege level separation.

m13Se2dAaa	Are you sure the font files are asking for passwords? It's possible that your extraction software is a trial and it is asking for a registration number.<br>  <br>  Try downloading fonts from www.dafont.com. They will definitely come as zip files and they definitely won't need a password.<br>  <br>  If you are running Vista: double-click on the zip to open it, then either click on "Extract all files" or drag and drop the files somewhere outside the zip window.<br>  <br>  If you are running XP and using a 3rd party extraction tool, I really think that is your problem. Try ExtractNow. It's basically Unzipping for Dummies ;-) Here is a link to a safe download from CNet. <a href="http://www.download.com/ExtractNow/3000-2250_4-10038365.html?tag=mncol&cdlPid=10871941" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/ExtractNow/3000-...</a> It is free. It is easy to install. Once it is installed, you just launch it, drag your zipped folders into it and click Extract. It's great because you can extract multiple files at once.<br>  <br>  Hopefully that solves your problem.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Or maybe you are running Vista and it is telling you don't have permission - in which case you need to be logged onto your computer as an administrator.|`|r8tX87p4aa	You have to ask the person who created the zip file for the password.

Whoever originally published the file doesn't want you to use it without some sort of cost involved. Possible not even a financial one.<br>  <br>  2.

LF2t9DPZaa	It's called "method overloading". In Java, you can have multiple methods of the same name in the same class, as long as the number and/or types of the parameters are different. That diagram doesn't show the parameters, unfortunately. <br>  <br>  Take as an example a hypothetical class that represents a fractional number. This class might have several methods called add(), for adding different kinds of numbers, e.g.:<br>  <br>  Fraction.add(int i)<br>  Fraction.add(double d)<br>  Fraction.add(Fraction f)<br>  <br>  and so on.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I'm not sure why I got a thumbs down for this. Yes, the method you mentioned is a constructor, but constructors are methods too, and it's still method overloading if it's a constructor. The fact that it's a constructor doesn't have anything to do with why there are multiple methods with the same name.|`|3xRmLJUGaa	They are constructors for the class.  You can tell it's a constructor because it has the same name as the class.<br>  <br>  Constructors are used to create an object of a class.<br>  <br>  The different constructors will have different input variables.|`|AA10212933	This functions are constructors, so it is repeated to give different options when initializing an instance object from those classes.

LmbRVb4Qaa	No speeds don't combine unless you have software that will team the connections. My desktop system has two Ethernet connections to my router. When in teaming it will use both to send/receive data. The bottle neck is of course my internet connection. When you run the speed test, Windows could be using either of the connection. Chances are that the slower speed, it used the wireless connection for whatever reason. Besides, do you really want your system exposed on an unprotected hot spot? Good luck.|`|22d97ccd017e03bfc5101f4d012367b5aa	Nope, nice idea though.
fE7zhp3Caa	If the question is whether or not it uses electricity when in sleep or locked, the answer is yes.  If the computer is plugged in, then even when it is turned off it's still using a small amount of electricity.  Laptops will pull enough to keep the battery fully charged, and desktops will use enough power to keep their CMOS battery charged.  Since standby is simply a reduced power mode, it's using more electricity than when it's off.  Locking a computer doesn't necessarily change a PC's power mode, so it might not be using any less than full power.<br>  <br>  Nearly all electronic devices still use electricity when powered down, at the very least to keep those little red standby LEDs lit.|`|b6b583ac1f8fbf805cf66023cafe00cbaa	Yes, it uses electricity when it is in "sleep" mode.  If it is not plugged in then the battery will gradually drain down. If it IS plugged in then it can charge up even while in "sleep".<br>  <br>  A lot of computers will slowly turn their front light on and off slowly, this shows that it is using electricity since it requires electricity to turn on the light.|`|1NWjta2jaa	Do you mean USE any electricity? Of course, it does, but not much at all. Of course, if you one of those, who worry about your "carbon footprint," than you are a terrible person because you use about two cents worth of electricity a day by not turning your computer off completely.

86188d90467d1d17151ae8044824c6cbaa	It sounds like a problem that is caused by multiple fingers on the pad at one time.  The computer interprets this as either a very fast finger movement and compensates by moving the mouse in one big jump or as the user trying to scroll the screen.  It is not usually something that can be easily changed in the computer settings although some computers do have a sensitivity setting that you can change.  I recommend you test it out and make sure you only have 1 finger touching the pad at a time (make sure your wrist isn't resting on the pad either) and if that isn't the problem then it is possible you have a defective mouse pad and you should talk to the computer manufacturer about getting a replacement.  Another less attractive solution would be to buy an external mouse and just stop using the touch pad all together.<br>  Good luck.

Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.

Cassette content is recorded to the drive and is saved for disk in wav or mp3 format.

It must have line out connections on the back. These are usually RCA type sockets.<br>  You will need a stereo cable from the L+R RCA outputs to a 3.5mm stereo plug on the PC. I got one from a local cheap as chips type store but electronics stores should have them also.<br>  Two RCA plugs to a 3.5mm plug.<br>  If your sound card has a line in socket select "line in" on the drop down list at the top right of Audacity.<br>  If you only have a microphone input select "microphone" from the list.<br>  <br>  The recording levels will need to be adjusted.<br>  Click record then start a track on the cassette.<br>  If the input is line in you will not need as much adjustment as you would if the input is microphone.<br>  Line level is a lot higher than mic level so the recording volume slider will need to be to the far left if using mic input.<br>  The peaks of the recorded input need to be within the limits of the viewing pane.<br>  A bit of trial and error is needed here to get it right.<br>  <br>  Each track needs to be recorded, edited (the blank ends trimmed off) and saved separately.<br>  All my tracks are saved in wav format to burn to CD. (music format).<br>  The number of tracks is limited to approx 18 - 22 depending on length of songs. The advantage is they can be played on any CD player, new or old. Burning to DVD limits the playback options although many more tracks will fit on the disk. Another option is saving in mp3 format. 150 plus (file size dependant) can fit on a normal CD but will not play on older CD players. It's a matter of personal choice.<br>  <br>  What I don't know is if music files can be burned then played on DVD.<br>  Deepburner free will burn audio CDs but only data DVDs.<br>  That's a question I'll have to ask.<br>  <br>  Naming convention.<br>  To keep the tracks in original order number each track with it's title eg:<br>  01 Track name, 02 Track name etc. up to track 09.

CGfEZV45aa	it sounds like you had a RAID 0 failure of some kind. the drive might still be working if thats the case, but then your data is probably gone. ok here's how you would go about it. just go into the BIOS and change the boot order so that the DVD drive is checked for bootable media before the HDD. once you do that save the changes and then exit the bios. open up your dvd drive and then put in the windows installation CD. there should be a prompt telling you to press a certain key to boot from the CD. follow the prompt and then once you're in try running a few diagnostics if you think it'll help. if not then just reformat then reinstall. are you using RAID 0? RAID 1? JBOD? or do you just have one of them set up as a secondary drive?

OSWIwalyaa	hey we have the same model laptop, lol.  i get these messages sometimes also.  go to your connections (im not sure how to get there on vista) disable, and then re-enable your connection, and then right click and hit 'trouble shoot connection'.  this has always worked for me, but if it doesn't for you, then i am sorry i couldn't be of more help.  Hope this helps!!!|`|r0tuv3i2aa	Hi,<br>  A lot of people with vista seem to share your problem.  Apparently the problem is that Vista requires DHCP discover packets to have the Broadcast flag set which is something that some non-microsoft routers can't handle. XP Service Pack 2 had this flag automatically disabled. The fix requires you to make a registry modification - you need to set the DhcpConnForceBroadcastFlag in the registry to 0.  Follow these instructions here on how to disable the DHCP BROADCAST flag in Windows Vista :<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928233/en-us" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928233/e...</a>  I hope this is of some help to you. :-)|`|de8xL7D9aa	turn off your wireless router if you have one by unplugging its power source wait a few seconds then plug it back in. Make sure you disconnect from the network you are currently connected to first. Then wait to reconnect to your home's wireless network until all your wireless routers lights are green. Then you can reconnect to your homes wireless network connection. I don't know what type of wireless router you have at home but I have a Belkin and at times mine has a little globe that turns Orange when it should be green and that's when I get the same error message. This could be your problem. Good luck.|`|bmaELuB6aa	The issue is most likely your TCP IP settings.  You need to make sure that your network "card" in the laptop is set to us DHCP for both it's IP and DNS Settings.<br>  Go to your network settings "Network and Connection Sharing" in Vista<br>  Select "Manage network connections"<br>  Right Click on your connection, and select properties<br>  Look for Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4), and select properties again<br>  Make sure that you have both options on the general tab set to Obtain automatically.<br>  <br>  Reboot your Laptop (just to be sure)<br>  You should now be able to get to the internet.|`|7NjNW3ITaa	Ok so im guessing its the problem with ur modem. Do u have a wireless modem or a normal wired one ?

Syn2excFaa	Worry more about your wireless network by setting up security on it properly.You can make sure by going to your router's manufacturer's website to see how this is done.If you have only wired internet than you don't have to worry about this. The keyboard is nothing to worry about.|`|fE7zhp3Caa	The range on wireless keyboards and mice is so small that it's unlikely anyone outside your home can receive any information.  Even then, the only thing that can be intercepted is your keystrokes, which is certainly enough of a threat all by itself.  A wireless keyboard doesn't have anything to do with a wireless network.  They're two completely different animals.<br>  <br>  However, I personally don't recommend using wireless where you don't have to.  Most wireless devices that use radio use the same frequency ranges, which can ultimately lead to interference.  At best this slows things down.  At worst it can prevent some devices from properly connecting.  Also, if you're going to be gaming a wireless keyboard and/or mouse can give you lag that isn't there with their wired counterparts.

At the end of the "Round" loop do printf("\r\n"); to insert an extra blank line.

There is not even a best product for detecting viruses.  There are 3 "certifications" of the effectiveness of av products - Virus Bulletin 100, CheckMark and ICSA.  All test the ability of products to detect 100% of known viruses without causing false detections (false positives).  <br>  <br>  Trouble is, the definition of "known viruses" used by these groups is artificially strict - not including trojans, for example.  Many products pass these tests.  <br>  <br>  2 independent testers do more rigorous testing - av-test.org and av-comparatives.org.  However, even though both these groups test the ability to detect over 2 million virus samples, they still only test one feature of your security product - the ability to detect malware in files on a hard disk.  They don't test the ability to detect threats in web pages, the ability to detect intrusions, firewalls, effectiveness in detecting threats in email or IM . . . . <br>  <br>  The top vendors - Norton, McAfee, Kaspersky all do pretty well on these tests, as do some less known players like AVG , Avira and Avast.<br>  <br>  I like the detailed product reviews at PC Magazine.  They do the most thorough evaluation of security products - using the above tests and also looking at ability to clean up infections, performance, stability and usababiliy.  This year they like Norton Internet Security 2009.  However, some other products such as BitDefender and Panda did well too.  I would buy a complete security suite - not get a free product that only scans for virues.  You do want the complete protection that the better suites offer - intrusion detection, firewall, web search protection . . .  .|`|FEgJH3Ajaa	Hard to answer,no anti-virus is 100 percent.Best you can do is this...1,download spywareblaster,install latest protection.2download what ever you like in anti-virus,install latest protection.3,down load a good firewall,like zonealarm or comodo.4 Do an online scan from bitdefender or microsft once a week or every 2 weeks.And last but a big one..use another browser other than explorer,it gets attacked alot,use firefox,or opera.Keep all settings on high,If you cant visit one site,don't fret go to another site,maybe blocked for a good reason...have fun.|`|Z2rxLctiaa	Not properly.Different anti viruses have different capacity.So use mutiple anti viruses and keep one active and others in the background.GOD doesn't like adult things.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	Yes because they have to renew virus definitions every couple of hours

They should first try out ContextBeanBox as a bean in Sun's BDK1.1, and only after that decide if they want to proceed with this type of installation.<br>  <br>  WARNING: This type of installation will permanently change your copy of BDK1.1.

HS8lX9Wxaa	I'd stay away from Dell, there are always defects especially with the battery that doesn't last and the faulty ac adapters that are loose. Customer service sucks, even when they repair things under warranty, they'll throw your laptop back together...lose some of your screws and potentially make the problems you have worse.

You have to get a 2.5" (inch) hard drive to put in it, and if your laptop is fairly new ( a couple years old) then I'm pretty sure its a serial ata connection (SATA). Once you have the new hard drive you have to reinstall windows on it.

UF8qU5cGaa	The biggest difference between the MacBook (Pro) and the Air is capacity. <br>  <br>  The Air is very thin and mobile, however it does not offer a lot of storage capacity and speed. <br>  <br>  The new version of the MacBook offers the same as the MacBook pro. The only real difference is the screen sizes, the Pro has a 15.4" screen, the standard MacBook has a 13.3".<br>  <br>  I would go for the MacBook (13.3") because it offers the best combination of portability and capacity.<br>  <br>  I have a MacBook Pro and a MacBook Air, the Air is not that bad if you are only going to use it for word processing and Internet browsing.|`|H3Va1OKqaa	The Macbook Air slices bread.|`|zhmpxdOnaa	The difference between the Macbook Air and Macbook Pro is that the Air is designed to be ultra portable and lighter than the Macbook Pro.  If you're lugging a laptop around a lot then you might want to consider the Air.  It's really designed for people who commute a lot or for people who are on the road a lot. The downside about the Macbook Air is it doesn't have a CD/DVD drive or Ethernet... kind of stripped down (hence why it's lighter)...so you need to have a wireless connection to go online.<br>  <br>  The Macbook Pro is a laptop that is just as good as a desktop machine or regular mac. It has DVD/CD/player/burner, Ethernet, Firewire, etc.  It travels well too... just heavier than the Air (a pound or two heavier..not really a big deal).  The downside is the Pro costs more than the Air, but it has more bells and whistles for hardware.  <br>  <br>  Also the Macbook Pro comes in 3 different sizes where the Macbook Air comes in one size.   The Pro comes in 12inch, 15inch and 17inch size.   The 15 inch size one is probably the best one.  The 17 inch Macbook Pro is kind of big if you travel a lot, and it costs the most.

jWcVcXZQaa	A modem turns analog singals to digital signals.  A router routes traffic between networks|`|cWuumdy7aa	A modem gets you connected to the internet. It translates signals sent over the phone line into data that your computer can use.<br>  A router can take that connection that a modem creates, and share it with (or route it to) more than one computer.<br>  <br>  You need a modem to get on the internet. You need a router to use that connection on more than one computer at the same time.<br>  <br>  The only exception to this is if you are using dialup. A dialup modem sits right in your computer, and uses your phone line while you're online. It's much, much trickier to share a phone line connection, and a router will not be able to split this connection. The easiest way to get a second computer in your house on dialup is to have a second phone line installed in your house.|`|ebuxHnScaa	It's confusing because some modems are also routers and some routers are also modems. But the basic idea is this:<br>  <br>  A modem converts between two signaling types. For example, between the cable that cable television runs over and Ethernet, or between a DSL line and a USB port. A modem connects exactly two endpoints.<br>  <br>  A router keeps track of where information needs to go and forwards it in the right direction, translating it if necessary.<br>  <br>  Typically you only need a modem if you only want to connect one computer to your Internet access.

m13Se2dAaa	Sounds like you formatted your backgrounds with the pictures instead of inserting the pictures. PowerPoint, unfortunately, is thinking for you and assumes you don't want to see the background.<br>  <br>  If you have a black and white printer, just set it to print in color and you will see the pictures. <br>  <br>  If you only have a color printer and you want black+white/grayscale, you can assign each image to print correctly. It's not a complex process, but setting up the tools gets a little deep. Let me know if you are using PowerPoint XP/2003 or 2007 and I can give you instructions (for this, they are drastically different).

If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.<br>  <br>  First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.<br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/what-is-the-best-registry-cleaner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...</a><br>  <br>  2. Clear your Windows cache files, this is your temporary file. It can grow up to a large volume and stop your computer from using RAM properly. In a sense slow it down by preventing it from using free space.Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Quit Internet Explorer, Firefox, or any other web browser<br>  2. Click Start, click "Control Panel", and then double-click "Internet Options".<br>  3. On the General tab, click "Delete Files" under Temporary Internet Files.<br>  4. In the Delete Files dialog box, click to select the "Delete all offline content" check box , and then click OK.<br>  5. Click OK.<br>  <br>  3. Manage your startups. Your excess CPU usage is due to too many programs running in the background. You can cut these to barebones by alter your msconfig. Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Open your Start menu.<br>  2. Click Run<br>  3. In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>  4. In the "system configuration utility",click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>  5. Uncheck all programs that your are no longer using.<br>  6. Click "OK"|`|eghsNMd7aa	Its old. Try reinstalling Windows or some other OS like Linux which doesn't bog down your computer.

While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your pc<br>  <br>  5.

With time, as you use Windows and install/uninstall programs and surfing online you create junk in the computer registry.over time,your registry will get congested and full of errors. So your computer could slow down. So, if you can clean it up this problem can be solved. To clean up registry,You can download a software called regsitry cleaner---Clean registry,remnant,corrupt files and temp files,history,cookies,etc..

The RAM is only 448 which tells me the video is sharing physical memory. <br>  Also, if you have taken those steps already then the reinstall will help however I think it is one of the programs you've loaded is making Gunbound slow. It is difficult to tell which one, however the best way to extend a laptop's life is to provide more physical memory. It is really cheap now too. So, I would go to www.crucial.com and you could order from there or at least find what type you need. Check www.youtube.com to see if there are any video instructions on how to take out or replace current memory on this type of laptop. <br>  Hope that helps also, I would suggest using more than one program to scan your computer for registry, malware, all the above. They are all written differently and one may find the culprit where others have missed it. <br>  Superantispyware rocks!

Usually 2 to 3 years for the more trendy peripheral devices. The big lie is that you can ever stick with any device in the extended long term and the second biggest lie in the industry is that you have room for expansion under the hood as the latest technology gets quickly cheaper than any expansion or modifications you may want to make anyway. Then they'll bail out on supporting your operating system shortly after you get all the compatible software and the add-on goodies that you've always wanted. At some point you are going to realize that millions of people are like trained seals, being told by virtually all PC components, systems, and software manufacturers when they are expected to drop another grand into all new stuff that is getting less and less backward compatible with all of our previously owned software accumulation and stuff like printers which are virtual throw-aways now. My old Windows XP software is not compatible with my new 64 bit Triple-core Vista machine and I am realizing I just can't ever afford to keep up by repeatedly buying all new software for my new machine. I feel as though I've been had, and at great expense! I am seriously considering open-source stuff now like Linux Ubuntu which is sounding better every day. here is a Google search query index page that came up with the info you want about various types of driver updater utility software when I typed in "Driver Update Software Reviews" and "Driver Update Software" into the Google search engine and hit the go button.

Get call blocker, change phone#, is all you can do. if they are more than silly calls call the police and make a report or call phone co. and they will tell you how they report it to police. The police will track you phone calls and may have you right down when you are getting phone calls to  help them find out who is calling. I think (check this) you can pay phone co. for a phone report that tells you who you called and who has called you. Make sure you tell them you want the report that the police gets to trace you phone calls. anytime you pick up your phone it is recorded who you call and who calls you. Check the phone # and the times and check them to the calls you have been keeping track of (make sure you have time, date,and what they said wrote down.) and check them against list then have parent call from different phone and ask for Man or woman of house. Tell them who you are by name and then say who am i talking to. (so you can try to get there name) Then your parents should tell them everything that is happening and that you would like to let them know before you give there info to the police. more than likely phone calls will stop.|`|6xsfvHdNaa	You need to evaluate how much work you're willing to do in order to solve this.

FBQZ06vraa	Since this is affecting your desktop, I'd suspect your resolution has changed.  Try this:<br>  <br>  1. Right click anywhere on your desktop and select Personalize.<br>  2. Click Display Settings.<br>  3. Slide the Resolution slider to the right to make it higher.  NOTE:  If the slider isn't movable, you may have to redownload the drivers for your video board from the manufacturer's website.  When the drivers are missing, Windows uses the old VGA size as a fallback.  I think it's an industry standard to support that without any special drivers.<br>  4. Click Apply.  The screen should go black for a second, then come back in the new resolution.  A little dialog box labeled Monitor Settings should ask you to confirm that you like the new format.  Clicking NO is the same as waiting for its timer to run out.  If you like it, Click YES.<br>  5. That should do it.<br>  <br>  If this works but the screen goes back to the old resolution after the next boot, you’ll have to set the resolution using the video board manufacturer’s dialog this way:<br>  <br>  1. Right-click on the desktop background.  Your video board’s manufacturer may have a special entry there.  Mine is “NVidia Control Panel.”  Click it.<br>  2. Under Select Task, select Display->Change Resolution.<br>  3. Again, set the slider to the same value you set above.<br>  4. A pair of Apply/Cancel buttons will appear.  Click the Apply one.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|jA1bdyyHaa	You can fix that by, holding the Ctrl button and if you have a mouse scroll down to change the wording.

W3dcQPvzaa	Did you get a CD ROM with the scanner and did you install the software on it onto your computer?

Specifically, it's an .NK2 file that is created in each user's profile.<br>  <br>  Where that file is depends on which operating system you have.<br>  <br>  But, to access it, you have to set your folders where you can view the hidden files, because it's a hidden file.<br>  <br>  NOTE: Outlook must be closed for you to do this.

Just use the path above to track to it in other words. There's going to be a outlook.nk2 file already there, of course, so either delete it and copy this one in to its place or just copy on top of it and say "YES" to save over. Whichever choice, it's the same thing.

Each card can run 2 monitors each. <br>  <br>  as for the video cards you can get any video cards you like. Since your saying money is not an issue, go for higher end ones so you can have a good, fast experience with whatever it is you intend to do with the flight simulator demo.

GKWs518Iaa	How did she pay? <br>  <br>  I've never been on Craiglist, but if she paid by Paypal, contact them and ask how to handle this before you send the items.  If she paid by cashier's check, deposit it and wait for it to clear before you send the items.  If she paid by personal check, contact her and request she void/stop payment on that check, that you will send the incorrect one back to her, and when she receives it to send you a new one in the proper amount.  When you receive the new check, wait for it to clear before sending the items.<br>  <br>  No matter which you need to do, inform her of the problem.  Do Not send the items until this is cleared up and DO NOT send her ANY money!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  To actually insist on paying $2,800 for a $300 item is way too suspicious.  Sounds like a definite scam.  I wouldn't do it.  Send the check back to her with a letter asking for a new check for the $300 ONLY.  When (or should I say if) you get that $300 check, wait for it to clear your bank before sending the items.  Also, send a notice to Craiglist about this.  They should know what's going on in case she puts up a stink or in case she's done this before.|`|aJGAXYUIaa	becaus emaybe it is a scam|`|i8cFHtUzaa	She could have meant to sent $280, but instead added an extra zero on accident. <br>  <br>  ask her ;)|`|vF2rwFeYaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  How did she send payment?

fE7zhp3Caa	The amazing thing about space is that people tend to fill what they have.  Give a person more space and they'll expand what they have to fill it.  I imagine it will be used for anything that can fit in 16GB worth of space, like thousands of MP3s, pictures, a few DVD ISOs, large program installers, even complete OS installations (pick a Linux distro and it will probably fit).  Use your imagination.<br>  <br>  I remember once, long ago, when computer engineers wondered why anyone would need more than 640KB of RAM.  The same has happened several times with each new upper limit in storage capacity.  You'd think the trend would sink in and convince people to stop asking the question.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Okay, here's a good point to consider.  A solid-state flash drive is less prone to failure than a mechanical hard drive.  It has no moving parts and therefore can't fail mechanically like a hard drive.  When flash drive capacities reach large enough sizes, you've given people an alternative external mass storage device that can be dropped from a 10 story building and stand some small chance of surviving the impact with the pavement (if you're lucky).  No hard drive in the world could withstand that kind of force.  Accidentally dropping it would be far less devastating.  Even laptop hard drives can't survive falling 5-feet onto a concrete floor.  The mechanical damage makes recovering the data expensive beyond most people's budgets, and sometimes the damage to the platters makes data recovery unreliable.<br>  <br>  I personally couldn't find a use for a 16GB flash drive either, but that doesn't mean no one else out there could say differently.  Back before hard drives were standard you had to save all your data on floppy disk.  Even after hard drives first appeared the convention was to save all your personal data to floppy, because you could easily buy more when you needed them and hard drives were incredibly expensive.<br>  <br>  Floppies haven't been practical for a long time.  Having ridiculously large removable storage allows people to save all their data some place other than on their hard drive.  It allows people to consolidate things and easily create multiple backups for disaster recovery.  It's easier to work with a flash drive than CD or DVD burning.<br>  [/edit]|`|2RQ4qDhXaa	My brother is going to school to be an audio technician.

BGjNqDloaa	once the Xbox is connected, it depends, im not sure about the original Xbox, but I have a Xbox360 and I only connected it to the internet to get the update (to update the newly bought console to the NXE update to install games on the hard drive).<br>  <br>  other than that this is not an exhaggeration but you have to pay for EVERYTHING! first there is a monthly subscription to have a Xbox Live account which you can access, and then you have to buy microsoft points (about 20 dollars per 2000 points) to "spend" on Xbox Live, where you can buy games, rent and watch movies from your Xbox. Or you can download game demos (which are free, but extremely short)<br>  <br>  now when I say buy games online, I am talking about cheap arcade games which cost about 1600 points EACH. such as geometry wars, feeding frenzy, etc.. not normal games of which you buy in stores for the system. also a little hint is that yea it is convenient to rent and watch movies streaming from your Xbox on your TV...but...MUCH cheaper to just rent it from netflix.com or from a movie store like blockbuster.<br>  <br>  if you have tons of money to throw away than have a blast, but first before clicking any buttons on Xbox Live on your console, you'll want to check out the Xbox Live website on your computer and first see the cost of everything. (A Xbox Live monthly access subscription runs about 15 dollars per month last I checked. it will NOT tell you on the website until you first enter all of your credit card information...and once you see the bill...well...like everything with microsoft...your money is already taken.)|`|iquR7SGbaa	Play games online, download game demos, download game updates, download full games, watch movies from netflix etc.<br>  <br>  But to Play games and download most things you need a gold account, which costs money.|`|3a23462a3bfb4a9eceaeadae6a06941eaa	blow it up|`|3r1RlSrhaa	xbox live obv   xD

They are all free for personal use and I have had no trouble with Viruses Trojans Hackers etc. I have just upgraded to AVG free 8.0 and all seems good so far. Zone Alarm allows a lot of personal configuration unlike the Windows Firewall. They can all be downloaded from <a href="http://www.download.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/</a> I also use Windows Defender from the Microsoft site. It is safe to use two anti-spy products but never use more than one A/V as it can cause conflicts. You should run A/V and anti spy weekly. Hope this helps|`|DjGEJfaPaa	If you want a free anti-virus I recommend in order of popularity, but please choose the right one for you (install only one):<br>  <br>  1. AVG Free<br>  a. A simple interface (easier to use than Avast! and Avira)<br>  b. Can detect about 82.82% of viruses<br>  Cons: low virus detection<br>  <br>  2. Avast!<br>  a. Real-time protection<br>  b. It has an option to delete a virus once found<br>  c. Can detect about 87.46% of viruses.<br>  Cons: Too many icons and confusing user interface<br>  <br>  3. Avira AntiVir<br>  a. It can detect malware better than Avast and AVG<br>  b. It's cute umbrella icon<br>  c. Can detect about 94.26% of viruses<br>  Cons: A very sluggish update<br>  <br>  For free anti-spyware I would recommend Malwarebytes and SUPERAntiSpyware.

SOME ANSWERERS <br>  ON YAHOO ARE ACTUALLY DISGUISED SALESPEOPLE TRYING TO "SUCKER" <br>  YOU INTO BUYING THEIR BOGUS AND UNNECESSARY SOFTWARE.<br>  <br>  If you’re using Windows Movie Maker, there is<br>  the possibility that you mistakenly saved your <br>  video as an "MSWMM" file with "Save Project"<br>  rather than save it as an "AVI" or "WMV" with <br>  "Save Movie File" (Win XP) or "Publish Movie" <br>  (Vista).<br>  <br>  There is a world of difference between the first <br>  example and the others: not only is MSWMM <br>  considered a "work-in-progress", it is not even <br>  a "true" video.

kWxhWET7aa	You're literaly only limited by your imagination, well that and your personal skill. But don't worry, over time, you'll get to know how things are done. You picked the BEST programming language to start with, however in order to get the most out of it, you're gonna need proper education. I recommend the books published by McGraw Hill Osbourne. They like to call them The Complete Reference, and for the most part, they're right.<br>  <br>  There are loads of free ebook downloads for C++ even a complete pdf version, just google it.|`|UniynYUwaa	Anything.

d22fa11eb34adb518ce9f61806a1ecb4aa	Not only on ur ipod, but in anything that lets you get online through wireless it will offer you the networks available.<br>  Meaning if near you are wireless signals that you can use to connect to the internet, your device will show them.<br>  <br>  You can only connect to YOUR network.<br>  Or perhaps other networks such as when your @ borders(they have wireless) or other places with "free" wireless.<br>  <br>  If the network has a password, it means is not yours, is not free, is a private network and you shouldnt get online in it. You wont be able anyways unless you have a password and user(if it requires so).

The next level is your satellite.|`|CWEO27okaa	(side note state an actual question, but what I think your getting at is what is your best option for internet)<br>  <br>  Satellite is an idea to consider, don't worry about trees, but usually there is an initial set up fee for around $300 plus its around 70 a month.  Look into the prices for your area.<br>  <br>  If DSL is not available, what about cable internet.  Call your cable provider as this will be your best option if available.  <br>  <br>  Another option is a broadband card, this will be slower than satellite but won't have the large up front cost.  However it will probably end up costing more in the long run if you go over your "internet time." The other options are unlimited this one is not.|`|bmaELuB6aa	With out a phone line, Dial up, and DSL are both out of the question.  Do you get cable TV where you live?  If so then your cable provider will most likely offer Cable Internet.  Sat. Internet is fairly expensive.  You might be able to get Microwave Wireless, but you need to have line of sight to the transmitter (which normally sits on a tower on the tallest hill in some rural areas)<br>  I would recommend looking into Cable.|`|EhsZuZhsaa	DSLreports.com (not just DSL Cable too) and ISP Ratings would be good Google searches. Each location is different as for Internet service and it's worth. Satellite is just expensive, trees should not effect much. <br>  You're on the right track, just gather information before hand. Also, I KNOW that here in Tucson. COX Communications if you call them cause they don't advertise this plan. Most companies have lower rate plans with enough speed to make it useful. It is slower than their normal 49.95 plan but fast enough to use once in a while. Dial up is not worth the trouble, as well since no home phone line. <br>  Perhaps you could get them an iphone? Just an option if you are located in the sticks where Internet is difficult to come by.

CJ9sfSReaa	Your security with BT is paid for in the monthly amount you pay.Once its on there its protecting good or bad along with windows defender.If you feel your norton isn't doing a good enough job then go to the BT broadband page and switch to McAfee marked as BT Net Protect plus.This removes norton and replaces it doing all the scans along the way.To me a bought security either separate or included in a package has to have certain obligations that a free one doesn't.I have changed all three of our laptops over,but to be fair had no trouble with norton I have changed simply because that is what BT now recommend|`|lcyV3WHAaa	When you get Norton internet security from your isp, it is installed on your computer and is the equivalent of the same package being bought retail. <br>  <br>  If you decided to leave BT and use another internet service provider, you would still have Norton Internet Security installed, and it would still update until the subscription period ran out, at which point you could choose to renew the subscription.<br>  <br>  If you still use BT and connect away from home you are still protected.<br>  <br>  This can be proven by the presence of the Norton Internet Security icon in the taskbar at the bottom right corner of the screen, which should have a green circle with a tick in it. This will confirm that the computer is protected from threats at any time. If it shows a red circle with a cross, then something is wrong, and should be looked into.<br>  <br>  Norton Internet Security will provide you with antivirus and firewall protection. You do not want to install a secondary antivirus or firewall program on the computer alongside this as they will clash and cause problems. Any computer can only have one antivirus and firewall application running at any one time.<br>  <br>  Norton products are suitable for protection against viruses, but their spyware protection isn't so great. I would always recommend going for one or more antispyware packages to compliment the system security, as these can run alongside antivirus protection without conflicts, and will often discover privacy, security and other dangers that can be missed by comprehensive packages such as Norton Internet Security/360 or Mcafee's equivalents.<br>  <br>  I would personally recommend Spybot search and destroy, and Adaware as good antispyware solutions. They both have a free version available which is great as there is no need to purchase a bunch of apps to keep the computer safe. You would need to run a scan every so often (say every 2 weeks or so) just to detect and remove any new threats, but make sure to run an update first.<br>  <br>  If you are wondering what is the difference between a virus and spyware - a virus will spread from computer to computer and infect files with malicious code. It is always considered illegal and they are created by individuals for illegal purposes - either destruction, extortion, fraud, or for fun.<br>  <br>  Spyware is created by companies or business minded individuals, it generally downloads it's own files and won't infect your files, but will often make changes to settings. It's purpose is to either: Spy on your habits (webpages you visit, etc), serve adverts (popups), create fear for the intent of tricking you into paying money for a product (claiming the system is infected with viruses, or has numerous errors - often using very realistic looking warning windows that appear like official error messages to an ordinary person) and other deceptive and/or fraudulent tricks. It is not neccessarily illegal and can be notoriously difficult to remove or repair.<br>  <br>  Antispyware programs will also find a lot of cookies, so don't be alarmed when it picks up 60 problems or more which are all cookies. This is just a file that a website has stored on the computer to track when you go to that website. Antispyware programs will pick up cookies created by adverts and advert pages (popups) that track how often their adverts appear, etc. This is a privacy concern for some people, but not a major risk.|`|09kNGOC8aa	Yeah Barsnip is right hardly anyone uses Norton its completely useless get yourself Clamwin<br>  <br>  Thats at www.clamwin.com (free)<br>  <br>  then for the firewall or internet security at www.comodo.com (free)<br>  <br>  pctools is completely worthless dosn't protect you from anything its a poor excuss for a firewall <br>  <br>  Norton these days only scans for Traces of viruses its wont actually get you anywhere those that i have said are free and the best <br>  <br>  I'll actually chuck in something that is also free and good<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.download.com/A-squared-Free/3000-2239_4-10262215.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/A-squared-Free/3...</a><br>  <br>  all these update daily hope this helps but just get rid of Norton|`|dE7zfuy1aa	hardly anyone uses norton anymore it seems to be totally useless.<br>  <br>  Try Avast you can not get a better anti virus system for free.<br>  it has many features you will have to pay for in other systems.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...</a><br>  <br>  don't forget to register or you will only get a 60 day trial<br>  <br>  for a firewall try this one also free and it has no conflicts with avast.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pctools.com/firewall/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pctools.com/firewall/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ...|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	go to BT home page they have stopped using norton~it is McAffe now.<br>  download from home page.<br>  hope this helps|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	One Norton is as good as the next.<br>  <a href="http://www.download.com/windows/security-software/most-popular/3101-2023_4-0.html?tag=mncol" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/windows/security...</a>

I tried downgrading to XP and found the laptop crashed every single time I tried, then looked into it and found that HP reprograms their motherboard's BIOS chips. apparently they "tattoo" vista onto the BIOS, and making the BIOS crash the laptop wenever another operating system is detected, its a trick to try and get you to pay for any work done. my friend did a bunch of digging and found a BIOS company that will remove and put in a new, unlocked BIOS chip. that is how he was able to get vista out. and out of all of us, he is the only one to have a well running laptop.<br>  <br>  im sorry to say but out of all my experience over the year and a half ive had my laptop as well as seen others with the same one. it happens to everybody and nobody talks about it because there is no solution. (dont bother calling HP, even if its under factory warranty they still charge you through the roof)<br>  <br>  maybe forcing vista into the under resourced laptops was on purpose to make more money fixing them when people found out they sucked? no idea.|`|AA11164502	I have Vista Basic SP1 on my Toshiba Satellite and IE and Windows Explorer randomly crash all the time too.  Of course, it could be that this computer was the cheapest one available ($400 just a couple of months after Vista came out should have told me something).  I don't have a real answer but I sympathize!<br>  EDIT: I agree with previous answerer.  I've got 512 MB of RAM and a cheap POS Intel processor.  Not enough bells and whistles to run Vista efficiently.  Pooh.|`|a4waUnI8aa	It goes to show that Vista is not a good version of Windows at all.

7gKHjyJvaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Unfortunately designing for print media and designing for web media are very different and PrintMaster Platinum, as the name suggests, should be used for the former. Looking at the source code for your website confirms this.<br>  <br>  Large file sizes for graphics cannot be used on the web, as they can for print, so they have to be compressed to a smaller size. This is why your images do not look as high quality as they do on your screen.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to say that the first thing you need to do is ditch PrintMaster as website design tool. I think OLSB has tools for creating website, so this is probably your best bet.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you have three options: <br>  <br>  1) Learn HTML and CSS markup and design your website yourself - this will take a lot of time but is probably the cheapest option.<br>  2) Purchase something like Dreamweaver (drag and drop web design software) to design your website with - Dreamweaver is quite expensive. This will probably take less time but there is still a steep learning curve. I don't think I would recommend this option.<br>  3) Hire a local website designer to do the job for you - depending on where you live, this may be more or less expensive than buying Dreamweaver. It would also be the quickest option and give the most professional results.<br>  <br>  I guess this is probably not what you wanted to hear but unfortunately this is my honest assessment. You never know, maybe some of the kind folk here at Yahoo Answers will have a bit of time on their hands and be able to help you :)<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	1) Using nothing but image files for a web page is a very bad idea.  It takes MANY TIMES longer to load a picture of text than it takes to just load text.<br>  <br>  2) You should display the picture in the size it is.  If you want the logo picture to be 429 X 536, make an image of that size.  Resizing images on a web page destroys the quality of the image.<br>  <br>  3) Using a program like PrintMaster gives you stuff you really don't want.  Your logo is at the top of a very large graphic with a transparent background.  You could make a png file with that logo that's much smaller (loads much faster) and has much better quality.  (and if you look at the sky in the picture, you'll see why you don't want to do it your way - unless your sky is really made of little blue dots.)

isadV8SHaa	This is not a good comparison.  Other than routing traffic to the right place, there aren't that many cohesive parallels.

I think this would just confuse most people.<br>  <br>  Try this:<br>  <br>  The Internet is a very simple thing, it is just a network of points with pathways to other points.  It allows information payloads to move between these points.  At each point is a device (a router) that helps to decide what the next logical path should be for each payload.  Some of the busier pathways are made larger to accomodate larger quantities of traffic.<br>  <br>  The road and highway system is a very simple thing.  it is just a network of places with pathways to other places.

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|nu4h6C04aa	You have been infected by a form of spyware, I suggest that you check out this website, it offers information about spyware and how to get rid of it:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://spywarerevealed.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://spywarerevealed.blogspot.com/</a>|`|3GmG8uQzaa	For the pop up, you can block it manually under the steps.<br>  <br>  Step1<br>  Press the Esc key one time. If this does not help, press Ctrl, Alt, and<br>  Delete keys all at the same time. If a programs screen appears, select end task and left click your mouse one time.

NpZukuuraa	If you are looking for quality registry repair software to rid of slow computer problems, anti-virus and anti-spyware products have trouble detecting the computer irregular behavior, computer freezes and crashes are becoming commonplace, and performance is a problem in most applications. We all realize how frustrating and stressful that it is to deal with continuous computer performance problems and system crashes. Making a decision about what product would be best to fix the problem adds more to that stress.<br>  <br>  There are a handful of top registry repair products that can do a quick and effective job for you. In most of these products there is only a small margin that separates them. This article will show you what to look for when shopping for software.<br>  <br>  Feature 1: Download Simplicity and Ease of Use<br>  <br>  There are a few programs that are extremely difficult to download and even more difficult to grasp the features in the user interface. The top products are completely opposite. The download is quick with only a few clicks and the user window that appears has an easy to use layout with descriptions of each feature when clicked on. The premier registry cleaner software programs give descriptions of each feature once you download the user interface during the free scan process. There should also be an online help guide in case you get stuck.<br>  <br>  Feature 2: Include Repair and Optimization Features<br>  <br>  Though repair and cleaning are the only issues on purchaser's minds, the best software programs offer optimization features to supplement repair characteristics. Good software programs will have tools that will complete system defrag (to free hard drive space), remove Internet Explorer plug-ins that slow your internet, and that remove viruses and spy ware from your computer. Not only do you get effective repair options, now you also get Internet Explorer plug-in removers, evidence scanners and cleaners, registry defrags, junk file cleaners, all in addition to standard scanning features.<br>  <br>  Now you can get so much more for your money. The following scan categories should be included in the software: Shared Program Paths, Application Paths, File Associations, Active X/Coms/OLE, Font Files, Help Files, Toolbars, Shared DLL Files, Invalid Shortcuts, Most Recent Files, and Startup Files.<br>  <br>  Feature 3: Automated System Back Up<br>  <br>  This feature saves your previous file "state" in case you are not happy with the changes made to your PC after the repair is complete. Sometimes changes made from repair are not what we expected. It is great to have the option to go back to the status we had prior to the repair in case we want to restore some of the files we selected to remove prior. Top registry repair software will ensure that you have a way to return to this previous state. This is considered the piece of mind attribute!<br>  <br>  Feature 4: Automated File Selection<br>  <br>  If you do not know what you are looking for in file changes, do not worry. The software programs that exist are designed to not be overly assumptive and remove critical files. If you are an advanced user, this feature can come in handy as you can select files you want removed without having to do the tedious work of self-registry repair.<br>  <br>  Feature 5: More than a One Use License<br>  <br>  Since you will need registry repair functions as part of an ongoing plan, you will want to be sure that the license is good for a year. It is best to get in the practice of scanning and repairing at least once or twice a week. By having a long-term license you can continually maintain your PC.<br>  <br>  Feature 6: Great Service and Tech Support<br>  <br>  Many of the best products have fantastic help files and you may never need a person due to the simplicity of the download. Still, it is always good to send a test email to the company to see how quickly they respond back to you. Take notice about how prompt the response is and how professionally you are treated. This will show you how good of hands you will be in if you get stuck while using their product.<br>  <br>  There are a massive amount of products that are separated only by a small margin. A few of products are far supreme in the number of features and repair effectiveness for the investment. The ultimate goal should always be to get the errors fixed as quickly and easily as possible at the lowest cost.<br>  <br>  The source below is the best registry repair software in terms of features, effectiveness and value for your money. A totally free software will do more bad than good to your computer.|`|TQOLhV53aa	I think Registry Mechanic 8 is your best choice,It alway works well for me.

We are interested in the 'local area connection'.<br>  <br>  From here, you want to see if it matches one of these following scenarios:<br>  <br>  1.Check to make sure that this does not say 'disabled', and the icon grayed out.  If it does say 'disabled', then simply right click the icon, and click 'enable'.  Hopefully, that's all your problem is...<br>  <br>  2. The icon may be colored, and say 'network cable unplugged'.  If it says this while your network cable is plugged in, try to wiggle the cable a little bit.  That network card might have a bad port (i have seen some with bent pins in the port).  If that doesn't work, a replacement network card might be in order.  Easy to install, cheap.  can be found here:  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833106121" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  3.

968KfJjqaa	It hasn't been released yet. Why? Because it's many times faster than USB 2.0 which is standard today.|`|e1GCbGrXaa	On September 18, 2007, Pat Gelsinger demonstrated USB 3.0 at the Intel Developer Forum. The USB 3.0 Promoter Group announced on November 17, 2008, that version 1.0 of the specification has been completed and is transitioned to the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF), the managing body of USB specifications.[31] This move effectively opens the spec to hardware developers for implementation in future products.<br>  <br>  <br>  Features<br>  A new major feature is the SuperSpeed bus, which increases the maximum transfer rate to 5.0 Gbit/s.[32]<br>  USB 3.0 receptacles are compatible with USB 2.0 device plugs for the respective physical form factors. However, only USB 3.0 Standard-B receptacles can accept USB 3.0 Standard-B device plugs.<br>  The protocol uses Dual-simplex, over four additional wires, differential signaling separate from USB 2.0 signaling (thus six wires total) to achieve the full Superspeed 5.0 Gbit/s[33]<br>  The protocol supports full-duplex data transfers.[34] In addition, data transaction is based on asynchronous traffic flow with explicitly routed packet traffic, instead of the polled broadcast packet traffic in USB 2.0. A streams mode is added for bulk transfer mode. SuperSpeed protocol also supports continuous burst transfers.<br>  New power management features include support of idle, sleep and suspend states[33], as well as link and function-level power management.<br>  The bus power spec has been increased so that a unit load is 150mA (+50% over USB 2.0). An unconfigured device can still draw only 1 unit load, but a configured device can draw up to 6 unit loads (900mA, an 80% increase over USB 2.0). Minimum device operating voltage is dropped from 4.4V to 4V.[33]<br>  USB 3.0 does not define cable assembly lengths, except that it can be of any length as long as it meets all the requirements defined in the specification. However, electronicdesign.com estimated cables will be limited to 3 m at full speed.[16]<br>  Technology is similar to PCI Express 2.0 (5-Gbit/s). It uses 8B10B encoding, linear feedback shift register (LFSR) scrambling for data, spread spectrum. It forces receivers to use low frequency periodic signaling (LFPS), dynamic equalization, and training sequences to ensure fast signal locking.|`|gz2JF00Saa	Yes, but it is extremely new.|`|oE0JCu89aa	Yes, there is. It has speeds of 4.8 Gbit/s (600 MB/s), and automatically cuts off the USB when not in use (to save energy).<br>  <br>  <br>  In short: It's better and faster than USB 2.0.|`|2RQ4qDhXaa	Rumor is it's in development - faster than 2.0 (just like 2.0 is faster than 1.0).|`|lkxFy681aa	2.0 is faster than 1.0, so I assume 3.0 will be faster than 2.0.|`|cKtfkXW5aa	Yes!<br>  <br>  <br>  "A SuperSpeed (USB 3.0) rate of 5.0 Gbit/s (625 MB/s). The USB 3.0 specification was released by Intel and its partners in August 2008, according to early reports from CNET news. Products using the 3.0 specification are likely to arrive in 2009 or 2010"<br>  <br>  It can transfer data between itself and the computer with more data or more faster|`|d22fa11eb34adb518ce9f61806a1ecb4aa	because technology evolves.<br>  Is the same reason you have windows vista and xp now days and u are not still using windows 98.<br>  <br>  Is just technology evolving.<br>  Usually when it comes to this kind of standards(USB, SATA etc etc).<br>  It means progress, maybe more speed, stability, quality etc etc.

They're both soffisticated operating systems, and they both have their flaws.<br>  <br>  Windows is designed and geared toward connectivity and business, but it has a near limitless supply of tools at its disposal. Unfortunately, most of these tools are expensive.<br>  <br>  Linux is geared toward design professionals and IT experts, doesn't have many tools available as addons, but comes bundled with loads of software.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'm sure that persons who REALLY have used both operating system will agree that you shouldn't even think about using Linux unless you're an expert at computers.<br>  <br>  Linux users swear that Windows constantly locks up, but the truth is, that if you don't even install Linux properly, you will have to keep reinstalling it until you do, otherwise it WILL freeze, over and over and over and over again.<br>  <br>  Long story short, there's problems with both, and you should base the decision on how much experience you have with computers, instead of which one is better for development. Linux comes with more development tools installed, but if you know what you're doing on Windows it doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  Also, game developer magazine did a recent survey about which compiler serious game companies were using.

SkpRC2Nmaa	Both After Effects and some non-linear editing systems (NLEs) are layer-oriented, meaning that each individual media object (video clip, audio clip, still image, etc.) occupies its own track. In contrast, some NLEs use a system where individual media objects can occupy the same track as long as they do not overlap in time. This track-oriented system is more suited for editing and can keep project files much more concise. The layer-oriented system that After Effects adopts is suited for extensive effects work and keyframing. Although other compositing packages—especially ones that employ tree or node workflows, such as Apple Shake—are better suited to manage large volumes of objects within a composite, After Effects is able to somewhat counter the clutter by selectively hiding layers (using the Shy switch) or by grouping them into pre-compositions. (After Effects does feature a Flowchart panel, which is similar to tree or node graph, but this view of a composition is mostly for display purposes and is not fully functional.)<br>  <br>  The main interface consists of several panels (windows in versions prior to After Effects 7.0). Three of the most commonly used panels are the Project panel, the Composition panel, and the Timeline panel. The Project panel acts as a bin to import stills, video, and audio footage items. Footage items in the Project panel are used in the Timeline panel, where layer order and timing can be adjusted. The items visible at the current time marker are displayed in the Composition panel.<br>  <br>  After Effects integrates with other Adobe software titles such as Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Encore, and Flash.<br>  <br>  [edit] <br>  <br>  lug-ins<br>  <br>  After Effects has extensive plug-in support; and a broad range of third party plug-ins are available. A variety of plug-in styles exist, such as particle systems for realistic effects for rain, snow, fire, etc.<br>  <br>  Using third-party plug-ins, After Effects can create 3D effects.

XXLOMOjeaa	Well you could slipstream some Nvidia drivers into your Windows CD, but since that is rather complicated to describe...<br>  <br>  There are two things I can think of for that problem.<br>  1. You are using a restore CD instead of an actual Windows Install CD. a restore CD comes with lots of things preconfigured that can mess up if you do not have the original hardware installed. Try to get a CD with just Windows<br>  <br>  2. The resolution of your card might be too high or too low for your monitor when it first comes up. Try installing Windows with the geforce card in it, then if the screen is black, reboot into safe mode (Tap the F8 key before the Windows Logo) and see if it would let you install drivers then.|`|wa7r36lzaa	Im not excatly sure but if you format your machine your whiping everything off of it, so the compuer will forget wat is in it.

That would send the monitor to sleep as well.  Try this:<br>  <br>  1. Right click on an empty space on the Desktop.<br>  2. Select Properties from the popup menu.<br>  3. Select the Screen Saver tab.<br>  4. Click the Power button on this tab (not the power button on the machine!)<br>  5. Click the Advanced tab.<br>  6.     If the Set the When I Press The Power Button On My Computer list box is set to Stand By, set it to Shut Down.<br>  7. Click OK.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.
eYdTRXFMaa	You need to learn how to work with anti virus, antispyware, registry cleaner. disk deframenters, etc. to keep your computer in good shape.  Every computer will get viruses and require regular tune-ups that you can do yourself.  Google what you want to to do.  You can get good tools to do this, free with downlooads.  Always check out the downloads first. A new computer is not going to solve the problem you have now.  Post another question and ask what you should do when you have trouble turning off your computer and are getting a black screen.  There are simple fixes for these things.<br>  <br>  IMO, you might consider getting your present computer in top shape (by yourself) before putting out money for a new one, because the same thing will happen to it.<br>  <br>  Email me if you want, and I will try to help you.|`|2RhTe54Raa	MACbook or macbook pro if u have the xtra cash..|`|qahjUkX7aa	macbook pro|`|kQADBPkQaa	Build your own at dell or something, get avast and use firefox and delete internet explorer.

lb0bYSgUaa	In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!
