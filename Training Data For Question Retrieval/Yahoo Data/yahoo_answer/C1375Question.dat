Escandalos certamente existiram e envergonham qualquer brasileiro. O imbecíl do Lula falar que n?o sabia de nada, revolta mais ainda. Porém é fato que o Brasil cresceu tanto economicamente quanto socialmente. é fato que o crescimento foi muito abaixo do que o país tem potencial mas foi bem acima do que ele vem crescendo anualmente nas últimas décadas. No entanto a classe média do país faz parecer que os escandalos s?o as únicas coisas concretas no governo atual. Será o brasileiro um povo exigente ou um povo extremamente capitalista? Será que o brasieiro se preocupa mais com escandalos do que com fatos sociais?

20090203130858AAV450A	Social Science;Psychology	Is this the appropriate diagnosis of Antisocial personality disorder?  Intentionally harming animals young age?	My father talks about how he used to light cats' tails on fire as if it were normal, I diagnosed him with Antisocial Personality Disorder.  He went on about how he used to shoot them with BB guns as well.       When I called him out on this abnormal behavior, he said did it as a kid, that doesn't count.       I said in the DSM the criteria is based on those behaviors as a child and how they get worse when the person gets older - as he is clearly getting worse with his psychotic behavior.  He now shoots blue jays and squirrels, and I won't even get into how he torments PEOPLE.      So case in point - he got worse as he got older, he really had no response to this.      Was that the appropriate diagnosis/response to his outrageous comments?      What would you do if someone talked like that as if it were normal behavior?      I have administered the SCID diagnosis for ASPD for years, so I know that is a factor.      Please answer if it is correct diagnosis and please no comment about how I shouldn't diagnose people to their face, as this man is truly one sick puppy and needed to hear it.
20090203134310AADfsZH	Social Science;Psychology	How to deal over losing a best friend?	I thought of him as a brother. When we met first time, he invited me to a party and we had so much fun. Then later I used to often hang out at his room in my dorms. Sometime later he totally stopped talking to me. I don't know what happened. He won't respond to my phone calls or emails. He even removed me from facebook contact. It will probably take some time before it heels, but I can't get off this mind, especially on philosophy class and religious where they talk about happiness, desires, detachement from pleasures. It just triggers bad memories and I can't focus. I am trying to set up an appointment with a counsellor at my school, but they're booked and not able to help me soon. I just miss him and I wonder if he'll ever speak to me again. I know where he has a class, so perhaps I would stop by after his class to talk personally to explain what happened, but probably not know, it would be too soon. I wish to tell it him personally how I feel sad, and sorry (I think I know what I screwed up, though I did not do anything malicious purposely). What should I do?

I woreglasses and in my dream I was so rushed I couldn't have time to put them on much less my shoes.  In my dream it was also raining, and dark....I could her my tentmates telling me to hurry, I remember running  along the path to the other tent....running and running...tfeeling very paniced and very scared,then suddenly I felt like something inside of me shimmered.

The "normal" lifestyle people have resolves around hanging out, hitting bars, going to parties etc. Now me, I HATE parties. I really, really do. (I'm not saying partying is wrong, just not something I enjoy) The idea of meaningless chit-chat, drinking, laughing and dancing is actually depressing. That's not a theory. Been there, done that. Didn't like it. Actually was bored. Also, people my age especially tend to only be capable to speak about the opposite sex, and sex itself. Sex I like, but talking about it day and night gets annoying. My social circle has been shrinking over the past years to the point that I have now no friends. None, zilch, nada. I never did stuff with them. I don't think of them as worse than me, but I don't want to to things I don't like, just because everyone else is doing them.      I have a much easier time being around girls. Mainly because guys I've met were idiots. The whole "macho" thing. Its like being around cave-men. For example, after 5 minutes of hearing a guy talk about how he got wasted last night, or how he thinks this girl is fine, how he ****** her and wants to **** her, how good or crap the football match went... makes me want to snap my own neck. Girls/women tend to be slightly higher on the evolutionary ladder. (ONCE AGAIN, it does not mean that such behavior is wrong, just not something I enjoy)      I have interests, I like ancient history, martial arts, I play video games more than most people would consider healthy. I do have a sense of humor, I can make people laugh. Slightly sarcastic sense of humor, but still. And I DO want to have close friends. Not many, just a small, close-knit group. Just two problems      1. Due to my lack of socializing, I don't really know where to start. I find it easy to talk to people, but I don't know how to start conversations, or turn a person I know into a friend. Or even where to look for friends. Its like a new world to me. Dating too. I can handle being on a date, but asking a girl out, that's out of the comfort zone.      2. Yeah I know, "just look for people with similar interests...". Easier said than done. At least in my case. Never met one person who I could relate with. Hell, I have a stronger relationship with my laptop that any other human being.      So basically I would like to hear people's opinion. What should I do? I really want some good, close friends, I am literally alone here. Haven't hit depression yet. Should I try to change, be more interested in what the masses do? Or suggest a place to meet people? This loner-ism thing is affecting me. I no longer do much, as its not much fun for me to walk around town and see a movie alone.       Opinions? Suggestions?      Thank you in advance.

20090225015005AA6YGwS	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What do you think about this comment concerning women's contributions to hunter/gather societies?	"Gatherer-hunter societies were the most egalitarian of all societies. Women provided 80% of the group's caloric intake; without their efforts none of us would be here."   -Olisbos      Actually this is not terribly different from the same argument of women being at least half the contribution in families where the man would work and the woman would be a housewife.          ... Now with that said do you think it would be too great a risk for us to entertain the notion that if a man can hunt and kill prehistoric beasts, or design blueprints to a multimillion dollar facility that he could probably also gather berries and do dishes and cook mac & cheese? I'm just saying here, people often paint these typical female contributions as if just because they (may) have been of equal value that would also mean that they were of equal difficulty and expertise. - I'm pretty sure that if the men and women in the above situations had switched, we'd realize just how unequal women really were to men in terms of ability.

20070410230656AAkizKe	Social Science;Psychology	What do I do about workplace psychological warfare?	In a nutshell, my boss is jealous of time I spend with another employee doing work-related things (he is not aware of our personal relationship outside of work, but it obviously carries over to work a bit where he can see it).  He is pretty good friends with this woman, and for some reason does not like the fact that I am close with her so he has launched a psychological warfare attack on me.  Attacks include instructing me to not do certain things at certain times (preventing me from being in the building at the same time as her after hours) as well as a stunt he just pulled today, pulling me off the major project that I spent the small amount of time with her (no more than 30 minutes a day, tops).  He tries to justify these things with other reasons that don't stack up to my supreme logic, then tells her that I was the one that decided to quit the project, making me sound like the liar.      How do I defeat this psychological warfare?  Just don't play?  If so, how do I not play?

20090203133957AAhR72i	Social Science;Psychology	Why do I overreact and make irrational decisions?	When I get annoyed with something I get myself really worked up. Its like the situation is the worst thing in the world. I can't see past it. I end up making silly decisions. I say things to people which at the time I think is perfectly apt and they deserve. I suppose it's like when people have anger management issues and 'see a red mist'.  Soon after, when I've had chance to assess the situation and I've calmed down, I realise that I've been totally irrational. But at the time it seems exactly the right thing to say or do. I know this happens to a lot of people but with me, it is getting severe. Its affecting my life.      I have no idea why I am like this. I had a happy childhood and nothing bad has ever happened to me. What can I do to sort this out?

I dont know why but i just cant seem to find anyway to speak up i always talk like im ashamed to even be speaking. I try to work on it when i notice im doing it but i rarely notice it unless others keep asking me to repeat my self and then i kind of yell what im saying cuz i get upset. anyways if that wasnt bad enough when i try to speak to others and convey what im feeling clearly its as if ive completly forgotten how to speak or what words are. Im always to worried to say what i feel because i dont want a negative reaction from people i just will go along with what theyre saying even if i dont agree because i dont want to argue. my question is what is the cause of this generally and what might i do to remedy this?

Entonces decidi pararle ya no reclamarle nada ni ense?arle nada. Pero ella insistio queria saber que habia atras, nunca le he ocultado nada.

If I felt rivalry coming from a slightly older woman in the changing/fitting room of ZARA (a fashion store), while I was trying on some cute dresses, (there was DEFINITELY rivalry coming from her...she seemed to be pleased about the way I was holding my left hand, which I injured two years ago, although everyone tells me the injury is hardly noticeable, but I disagree)...would it be more likley that that was because I was pretty for her, or ugly for her, and so she wanted to be mean?   I'm not good at reading people's expressions, I can't interpret very well. That's one example, a related question: if older women smile at me, is that out of pity for my ugliness, or is that because I'm pretty? Because lately, especially upon seeing the way I hold my left hand, older women smile at me, and I can't know what it means.      And if older men glare or frown at me AFTER I make my left hand visible to them?      What, in your observation/experience, do these reactions mean?

20090203135621AABMGx9	Social Science;Sociology	How many woman are turned on by being dominated?	I realize that this question sounds a bit sexist, but I've found almost invariably that women are turned on by being dominated. Maybe it's just me - I'm 6'3", 245, and bald - but the more violent and aggressive I acted in bed, the more women loved it. I found that, regardless if the female was 4'11" or 6'5" (I've dated both), the recipe for turning them on could be broken up into:      1) Hold them down firmly by the wrists...apply enough pressure to hurt them slightly, yet not to cause serious pain.      2) Thrust as hard as you can.      3) While doing so, mouth in an angry, aggressive tone things like "Yeah, you like this, don't you?" and "Come on, beg for it".      I admit, I'm less than thrilled by the whole procedure...while some men get off on dominating someone, I find it sort of caveman-esque and was a bit disappointed to find that the women were so traditional and stereotypical in what they liked. However, I've posted questions in the past mentioning that I hated my height and build and generally people acted like I was crazy, like almost all women wanted a big man who would "ravage" them. It's hard for me to reconcile turning someone on with something I totally hate about myself, but there isn't exactly a way for me to alter my height, build, nor baldness.

In this dream I was doing community service after school and my crush(JJ) was in it and so was my x-friend (CM) and so were all of their friends. We were ALL talking to each other when one of JJ's friend's said hey CM are you only here because you like JJ? for some reason this hurt me a lot and I turned around and started crying. then a circle/crowd formed around JJ and CM leaving me out. Then JJ got out of the crowd 9I was still turned away) he came up to me and said (my name) are you ok? not wanting him to see me cry I just said yea (my voice cracked) then I ran away after this I woke up. What does this dream mean and do dreams tell you things that other people are thinking too or do they just tell what YOU want to happen and it has nothing to do with how other thoughts feel? please help thanks so much

20090203135127AA2BuWx	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Please help me interpret my dream.?	I was in my room. There was no furniture. No shelves. No bed. No windows...The closet door and hallway door still were there. Outside the hallway was something indescribable. I'm not quite sure what it was...It was a strange, yellowish abyss. Three guards stood in front of me...And I was having a conversation with them. I think I was going to do guard duty. Suddenly, I ran for the closet door, opened it, went to the end of my empty closet...And crawled through the little door. I was suddenly in a large room. The ceiling was not visible, and all there was above me was darkness. Suspended from the darkness were two large golden poles that raised a throne about 2 or 3 stories off the ground, inside being Egyptian rulers of some sort...In front of me were multiple carts full of some sort of ore in which I was mining...And I was wearing tattered clothes. Sweating horrible, dehydrated, shaking, hungry, etc. I was a slave, I assume. I remembered there weren't any other people around me, yet the entire room was huge...And made out of a sandy brick and red cloth...Like the cloth they use for those walkway rug things...Lol. I assumed that there was a machine of some sort being built, and they were using me for some part of it...So I was repeating "I don't want to hurt them, I don't want to do this. I don't want to kill them.." etc... etc... So I ran down a long hallway full of ... insignificant pictures of what I assume were previous rulers. At the end were two large castle doors, and beyond those was a long, winding, greenish path that led into the sky. So I began to head for the left door, which slammed right before I got to it. I ran to the right door...And I jumped through. The door slammed behind me...And I non chalantly walked away. XD

20090224220239AAYFlh9	Social Science;Psychology	Does planning interfere with creativity?	Planning lets people impose order on the chaotic processes of making or doing something new. Too much planning, however, can lead people to follow the same predetermined course of action, to do things the same way they were done before. Creative thinking is about breaking free from the way that things have always been. That is why it is vital for people to know the difference between good planning and too much planning.   Adapted from Twyla Tharp, The Creative Habit         Does planning interfere with creativity? Please tell me your views.  Has this ever happened to you in your life or have you read about it somewhere?Also any reasonings or examples taken from studies, readings, or observations.   Thanks. Please tell me your opinion.

He said his name was Moshe Bradman. Doing my own research (looking up public records) I figured Bradman was not his true last name. Its actually Goldberg. There was a 25 yr old man who lived in the eastcoast state , Moshe has told me. Then it clicked. there was a listing of other relatives (sisters) which he also told me he had.

20090225020026AAxxpmT	Social Science;Psychology	How do you handle a person with a baseless, but strong depression?	A friend of mine has been showing many signs of depression recently. And I mean rather obviously. He has even mentioned that he thinks about suicide, but I am doubtful he considered it seriously. The problem is, if there is any reason for this depression at all, he will not divulge it. So, either there is no direct cause, he believes he must handle it himself, or simply does not want others to know about it. I have no idea what I should or can do about it though. Some people tell me not to try to force social interaction on him, others tell me it is important not to leave him alone. So basically the advice I have is,  I should only offer him my company when he wants it, but I best not dare leave him alone. If there is a middle ground here it cannot be literal. The two suggestions are mutually exclusive if he never wants company. What am I supposed to do about the guy?

In my dream and immediately when I woke up I almost felt guilty knowing that he was going to do this.      Why am I getting such morbid and graphic dreams??? I have also had a dream of my cousin speaking to me as well who passed away recently...      Help, can you interpret these? What does this mean?

He was only 10 months when his dad passed so he doesn't even remember him, but recently he's been very upset about the fact, crying every day, not being able to sleep etc. I try to comfort him, telling that his daddy still loves him and looking down at him but it doesn't seem to work. He just wants him back and it breaks my heart that I'm not able to help him. Please this is a serious matter so only serious answers.

20090225021950AAqXYh7	Social Science;Other - Social Science	What is something about the current and future generations that worries you?	This is a personal opinion question. I'm just curious to see what everyone else out there thinks. My opinion? It worries me that the current generation wants to grow up so quickly without any of the responsibilities required with it. I'm worried that this is leaking in to future generations. The need for things to be instant also concerns me.
20090225022551AAqGCAH	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I had a dream I was a ghost.?	last night, I had a dream I had died. Not sure how, I was just in the world and the only person that could see me was my aunt, who has down syndrome. I am one of her favorite people. Then I found myself with a lot of relatives, some that were worried about their loved ones and most that are alive today. some of us were trying to work out a way to tell our loved ones that we were okay and happy. One girl kept trying to make phone calls, but the calls would not go through. so, one of my aunts, who is still alive today, told me that she sometimes travels just to be around. In the meantime, the kids were putting on a talent show. I asked one of my aunts whose child died of young age if they ever age and she said that they didn't... so, her month old was in a child seat. From what I gathered, we were living but in our own spirit world. So, I traveled with my aunt, my grandma and some other cousins to my grandma's house. There, I thought we would find no furniture, however, the place was still furnished. I thought to send my message of my well being through my aunt the next day, the only one that could see me. I don't remember anything else. I think that is when I woke up. What does all this mean?
