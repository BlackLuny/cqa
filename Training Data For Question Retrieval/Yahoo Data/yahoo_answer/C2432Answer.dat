gnbBIRu6aa	You should probably start by comparing and contrasting the French and American wars in indochina.     The essential problem for the US was that china and the USSR were never going to allow the US to invade North Vietnam. They were also committed to providing extensive open ended military support to North Vietname. So american tactics basically involved fighting a war of attrition with people that had fought the chinese, japanese and french to a standstill. Crudely put it was a case of who was going to give up first, and even from the 1950s it was obvious it wasn't going to be the communists.|`|tJeS4SZCaa	the Devastation of the Hydrogen Bomb was to great, it had nothing to do with American tactics.|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	For some perspectives:  http://www.americanthinker.com/2005/05/w...  http://www.hoover.org/publications/polic...  http://www.jtfgtmo.southcom.mil/storyarc...  http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,4008...  http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary...

CCN2PneTaa	The plot revolves around five kids, Max, Iggy, Fang, Angel, the Gasman and Nudge, who grew up in the School, being tested n and genetically modified. They are 2% bird so they have wings and can fly as they have light bones. Some have powers, such as Angle, who can read minds, control people and breathe underwater. I've only read the first book, so I can tell you Maximum hears a voice inside her head which says she is destined to save the world.    They were rescued by Jed Batchelder, a whitecoat who took pity on them and raised them up, but disappeared one day.    They are also on the run from the Erasers, who were also made in the S chool, and want to kill them. They look human, but can morph into dog/wolf type creatures.    At the end of the first book, they find information about their parents, all expect Max, who is left shocked by a revelation revealed towards the end of the book. It ends with them going off in search of their heritage.    The film comes out soon.|`|d4Uz4FqZaa	Maximum Ride series are fantasy books about a flock contents 6 children who have avian-hybrid DNA on their bodies. Those are Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, Gazzy, and Angel. They are objects from a place called "School". They used to be the School experiment, but they escaped. A couple hours later, they have to be alert against "Eraser" (one of the most successful experiment despite Maximum Ride and friends who has lupine DNA) whose duty is to catch the flock.  The story itself tells about the surviving between the flock. Moreover, the story not only tells about their surviving, but also gives some some message like in the book four. If you read the book, you would like to think that you're included to the book itself. So, it looks like that you're going to do something good to the earth with them.  The theme of the book is complex too. For girls, they still can find about the romance between the major characters.  Well, I really recommend this book to you. In my opinion, this book is better than Harry Potter series even more Twilight series. I guarantee you about this. Hope I've helped :D|`|gu3GAFC9aa	Read the lake house and When the wind blows first.

Many people think that the series is a continuation of Patterson's The Lake House because it has similar characters but in the beginning of The Angel Experiment he has a note saying that they are not the same.  Nevertheless, I'll probably be reading it as well.|`|BBn8Xkiyaa	It's about a bunch of kids who have been genetically modified to be part bird.

Also, I recommend reading some Agatha Christie, and watching the television adaptations of her books (especially the TV show "Poirot", starring David Suchet). In the classic mystery style, her plots are very intricate, very improbable, and very entertaining -- you could certainly learn a lot about mystery-writing from her. After all, she is the Queen of Crime. You may want to be a bit cleaner, though, seeing as your audience won't necessarily respond well to bloody murders.|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	Try to find the Alfred Hitchcock presents tv series.

yuuvBSKsaa	Most of the time our hearts desire, and our mind acquire.    When our minds chooses our desires, we call this wisdom.    But whether from heart or mind,  desire is without flaw, because getting exactly what you desire is what we call flawlessness.|`|AA11564934	seriously?  You think there's a possibility that wise people never make mistakes?  This question is a waste of time.|`|OKClYfDQaa	No. Wisdom isn't exact; but it's nearer to perfection.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	Wisdom without logic is flawed.|`|eFjy1f2paa	Wisdom is ephemeral.  The most perfect wisdom and only be for an instant of time and place.  Wisdom, or that what can be written down lasting beyond its instant, can be no more than a finger pointing at the moon.   If you follow where the finger points, it may be that you can see the moon, where it is in its own time and place.  But then again, you may just end up staring at the fingertip.|`|O15my3olaa	Nothing in the world, i think, can ever be called flawless, perfect.    Even the great ancient Greek or modern day philosophers,scientists cannot claim to be right in everything they  do. Things often change from century to century, so knowledge, techniques and 'wisdom' should sometimes be modified, to be more practical for current usage. Very often, tradition and customs, which are ideal and wise, are not seen as sensible or necessary nowadays. Like Honour killing, burning of widows, etc And being "Too Wise" in some circles,whether in ancient or modern times, may be a  disadvantage or put one's life on the line. Being half-wise, avoids envy, competition,etc and therefore may well ensure longevity, instead.    However most of the wisdom of the East and West, since the time of Plato, Socrates, Confucius, Lao Tze are still applicable today. But still, many of the young generation of modern societies do not embrace sensible, safe or ideal practices related to ethics, morals, discipline, diligence, respect, filial piety,safe practices, etc just because the majority of their kind don't follow because doing so, would take 'some fun out of their lives'.     So, it is difficult to measure wisdom, nor necessary to judge whether one person has little wisdom and another person has almost perfect wisdom. There is no way of gauging such a quality, because there is really no yardstick-- it may well be infinite, just like Love, Truth, God.     Well, hope these points are in some way,  useful.|`|s2TJ6H1raa	I agree with the first answer|`|VoJR0a2Eaa	No.  However, it is still wise+|`|W06bUYyRaa	Yes and No. It all depend on what wisdom you follow.|`|w2qV8WEmaa	Since nothing is perfect, wisdom cannot be flawless ;-p

The answer is no, because it's "dead" blood.  Edward can still scent the blood, so he will know Bella is on her period without her having to say anything about it.  However, because it's not "live" blood, it's not going to set off his vampiric thirst.    To put it in human terms, it would be like smelling steak that's gone off vs. steak sizzling on the grill.

Starting so many sentences with "I" is repetitive.|`|2Sjn4B9eaa	No, not good at all. First of all you start almost all the sentences with "I", by rewording the sentences you can get rid of that problem. Also you say "thinking" to many times, think of another word, okay?

AA10729675	It is for money.  I am going to explain why:  even if it is not for the artist's money, which is often the case, it is for the money of the society they live in, because of the money or economy they live in.  They reflect what they feel in an economic contest.  No matter what it comes down to money.  Michael Angelo could do what he was doing because he was in a society that wanted to show off.  Today someone wanted to impress me one more time, maybe one time too many on the purity there is in nudity, which I absolutely reject as a theory and as a truth.  So he told me that he went to a conference about the notion of puritanism.  There the speaker showed them a picture of St Basil by an artist called St John something.  It represented St Basil with two women: one on his RIGHT, one on his LEFT.  The one on his right was nude.  The one on his left was dressed and was wearing jewelry.  Well, with his right hand St Basil was blessing the woman on his RIGHT who was nude, and with his left hand, he was condemning the woman who was dressed and wearing jewelry.  There.  My friend was happy, he had proved to me that nudity was blessed by the Church.  And I was absolutely flabbergasted.  I told him: don't you see that the explanation is completely childish?  -NO, why?  - Well, I  said, it so happens that this was not at all the meaning of this picture.  It was just a symbol not of purity and nudity versus clothes and impurity.  - No, it was.  - No, it was not.  It so happened that at the time of St Basil, the Byzantine empire was running out of money, big time.  So the first thing they did is tell women NOT TO BUY JEWELRY.  Because it was vanity.  They even took they jewelry to put into the state treasury.  I must say that they had very expensive jewelry indeed.  So St Basil and the man who represented it were only reflecting the new idea of the moment:  God bless those who are innocent WITHOUT JEWELRY, and condemning those who are vain and WITH JEWELRY.  Later on, it was picked up by all Catholics.  I remember when I was young in the south of France, women wore jewelry on rare occasions and no make up.  So, it has to be the money beyond all other or any reason.  They create whatever inspires them in the economic context where they live and however they want to express that.|`|3mYJ6WL9aa	All of the above in some cases.<br>  <br>  But think of the caveman & his etchings.No money.Ego?I doubt it.Benefit of society?Possible.<br>  <br>  No,the creative impulse has to come from somewhere deep within.It's as much of a calling as medecine or religion.More perhaps as it is obsessive.|`|tqWW0GaNaa	I think it should be to communicate something ... whether an emotion, an experience, a truth about human nature, a joke a story ... there has to be something that the viewer of the work is intended to receive, even if that's just a surprise.|`|7aK81hsbaa	there is no single answer: an artist's motives vary from time to time and with each work. emotions show in the work.|`|96wMLm5Naa	As an artist, I am personally motivated to draw and paint when my emotions are strong, or when my imagination is particularly active (usually at night for me, I typically wake up at 2 or 3 in the morning with excellent ideas from dreams and whatnot).<br>  <br>  Not really to feed our egos, even though I must admit it DOES feel awesome when you finally get something right.<br>  <br>  For money? nah, I don't sell my art, but I'm sure many do.<br>  Benefit of society?

Qualify it.<br>  -Form your thesis statement based on this. Relate your thesis to something larger, either in your life or the world at large. <br>  -Pick three points of evidence that will uphold your thesis statement. These pieces of evidence will be from books you've read, circumstances you've seen/been in, movies you've seen, etc. Have you had experience with the death penalty? Have you read a book about it?

After Toussaint L'Ouverture created a separatist constitution, Napoleon Bonaparte sent an expedition of 30,000 men under the command of his brother-in-law, General Charles Leclerc, to retake the island. Bonaparte was influenced by Creole planters and traders. Leclerc's mission was to oust Louverture and restore slavery. The French achieved some victories. In addition, Leclerc kidnapped Toussaint Louverture and sent him to France, where he was imprisoned at Fort de Joux. He died there of malnutrition and pneumonia.<br>  <br>  The native leader Jean-Jacques Dessalines, long an ally of Toussaint Louverture, defeated the French troops led by Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau at the Battle of Vertières. At the end of the double battle for emancipation and independence, former slaves proclaimed the independence of Saint-Domingue on 1 January 1804, declaring the new nation as Haiti, honoring the original indigenous Taíno name for the island. Haiti was consequently the first country in the Western Hemisphere to abolish slavery.<br>  <br>  Dessalines was proclaimed Emperor for life by his troops.[4] He exiled the remaining whites and ruled as a despot. He was assassinated on 17 October 1806. The country was divided then between a kingdom in the north directed by Henri Christophe, and a republic in the south directed by a gens de couleur Alexandre Pétion. President Jean Pierre Boyer, also a gens de couleur, managed to reunify these two parts and extend control again over the eastern part of the island.<br>  <br>  In July 1825, the king of France Charles X sent a fleet of fourteen vessels and troops to reconquer the island. To maintain independence, President Boyer agreed to a treaty by which France recognized the independence of the country in exchange for a payment of 150 million francs (the sum was reduced in 1838 to 90 million francs).<br>  <br>  A long succession of coups followed the departure of Jean-Pierre Boyer. National authority was disputed by factions of the army, the elite class and the growing commercial class, now made up of numerous immigrants: Germans, Americans, French and English.

AA12228381	Acting Technique in a nutshell:  The first thing you need is your objective -which is, most likely to escape or get free.  But it doesn't HAVE to be.  You could choose to make your captor admit you are 'right' and right could be anything you want it to be.  Once you figure that out, then substitute whoever you need that same objective from in real life.  For example, if you picked 'to be right', then pick your husband to be as I'm sure you have that need. (don't argue that point as I've been married for almost 10 years LOL).  Then figure out what obstacles you need to overcome to achieve your objective - mental or physical.  In this case, obstacles would be things like 1) he has a gun, 2) might be bigger and more physical than you, 3) your terrified.  Things like that.  <br>  <br>  And not to overload you, as I could list about 9 more things, just take it from there with those things in your head.  I know it may seem like a lot, but maybe it will give you a small glimpse of the prep that many actors do before a performance.  Acting really is work, although most people don't believe that.  And most of all - have FUN with it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  d.

(girl moves from warm to rainy place because of step dad?)|`|ZUL3drNgaa	amazing! but can you tell me what the general plot of the entire story is? i'd really like to know.
wEEOvu5Waa	Hey if a vampire can sire a child (since a vampire is a dead body and unable to manage bodily functions such as producing sperm) then God only knows what a half vampire half human might do.|`|imKCvvFKaa	does it matter? twilight series suck anyway!|`|F0TrTxataa	yea it wouldnt make sence if she couldnt|`|fpt2rOYpaa	I think she most definitely can get pregnant as long as she does so before she stops aging. I don't think Jacob would have been able to imprint on her otherwise.<br>  <br>  Sam says that wolves imprint on the person who gives the greatest chance at carrying on the wolf gene and since Nessie's genetic makeup is so similar to Jacob's, I think it's safe to say that that is why he imprinted. Plus, you know SM plans for them to have children. I think the way she set the story up made that quite obvious.|`|iB22RWkGaa	Well she better be able to, or else that would mean that meyer is really really retarded. she and jake imprinted, so that means that renesmee should be able to make strong weres/shapeshifters. that was the whole point of imprinting.|`|946a0de98c140058626f3f700cfaa468aa	Yes cause her body also changes.  She gets older taller...etc.  But she does stop at a certain point but she does have blood flowing through her so I believe it is possible cause her tissue is living.|`|jqXL4JDCaa	Yes. If I remember correctly, wolves imprint on the person who will give them the best chance of having an offspring with dominant wolf-genes. That way the wolves don't die out. So if Renesmee couldn't have children, they wouldn't have imprinted.|`|zlAxVAGkaa	i think so... cuz somewhere in eclipse i think it said that u imprint on someone that is the best to pass on the wolf gene, and jacob imprinted on her, so ya probably. any baby of theirs would be one weird hybrid... vampire/werewolf/human???? lol|`|85unn6s7aa	Yeah because Bella's says that vampires can't get pregnant because they are frozen like ice but Renesmee is warm blooded and is growing fast... she probably has to get pregnant before she stops growing.|`|daoEMBYsaa	Most likely, I would say yes. Reneesmee is human with vampire qualities. Half-Vampire, Half-Human.<br>   So, my answer would be yes.|`|iXNcB0vSaa	I tihnk<br>  cuz she is still growing<br>  n she wont stop until she is 7 years old [will look like 17]<br>  than she will stop aging|`|cJQdhGYJaa	yea possibly i think|`|IOVDAwmnaa	yeah, i think so.|`|WOBTw8jzaa	i think|`|IBgRn8Hyaa	Yupp!

I do wish Meyer would write more about  it, from Edward's perspective|`|tWlaPLcMaa	i totally agree with you...its like we got to see her struggles and all...but it would be great to see inside his head and witness what really was going on...and not just knowing oh its HARD>...but so that we can acctualy undestand it...and be in his shoes..<br>  <br>  o btw the JACOB PART WAS A MAJOR DRAG!|`|zlAxVAGkaa	i agree the jacob part was so boring. and the whole nessie/jacob thing just pissed me off, bella seriosly should have killed him...|`|mkSxfmzqaa	i totally agree!!!|`|Co7BtKiPaa	totally agreed with everything!!!!!!<br>  completely LOVED that book (:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EfHSTFbujs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EfHSTFbu...</a><br>  its hilarious|`|R0iHHPqEaa	I read Twilight and I thought it was awful.

COME ON! NOT ROMANCE! vampires sparkle, are veggies(animal blood), and only 4 have powers? WTF! NOT VAMPIRES! she might as well used guppies!|`|lk03YYPEaa	I don't agree in any way at all...<br>  Breaking Dawn honestly sucked. It was full of plot holes, and it was like Meyer was so desperate to have something new and interesting that she just made her pregnant... somehow. :p<br>  I think Jacob's point of view was the least depisable. At least he had personality -- Bella's so boring.<br>  I see no point in writing the book from Edward's point of view. It's just the same story, except the "OMG EDWARDS HOTTTT" is changed to "OMG BELLAS PURDYYY".<br>  >->|`|AA10228075	i wish she would write a book in edwards view. and another in resenmee.|`|AlJ557gHaa	twilight sucks @$$

B0GujA9Aaa	Interesting theory. <br>  <br>  I guess it could have been possible that Tatiana had survived the shooting. I mean if she sustained only minor wounds during the incident and if a soldier who thought that she was hot just so happened to notice that she was still alive then he might have helped her get some care. And she might have been able to change her name and leave Russia for England. <br>  <br>  But then again we won't really be able to know for sure, unless we are can obtain some DNA samples from Larissa and if it matches that of one of the bodies of the deceased Romanovs. <br>  The DNA tests done on Ann Anderson were inconclusive (more or less were not a match). <br>  <br>  If someone can just run some DNA tests on her then we might be able to really know if she was or wasn't Tatiana Romanov.

The carriage rides start there too and there is usually a good picture or two to take there.<br>  <br>  Remember you need a little faster lens indoor if you are not using a flash, and some places that allow photography don't allow tripods.  <br>  <br>  If you haven't checked out Flickr, there are many local Chicago groups that might give you some ideas, too.|`|eFnUBBxiaa	Garfield Park Conservatory if you like plants<br>  Chicago Union (train) Station<br>  Thompson Center is awfully big<br>  <br>  Just wander downtown going in various buildings: Marshall Field's, courthouse, Illinois State Building, etc.

944a14c77cfd5df8decc7beffcf31f38aa	NEVER START A STORY WITH DIALOGUE, here;s a website I just found with some recs for writing and it specifically says to NOT START OFF A STORY WITH DIALOGUE, not saying ou can't but it does say your asking for trouble when you do. Also don't start off with a character alone in a room, don't start off with a character waking up, lol this site is pretty cool. Just saying, for a good hook, you may not want to start off with someone talking.|`|aBh7uZkuaa	it's good i like the story.<br>  <br>  i like how you put in details such as "i bit my lip and clenched my fist."|`|WOBTw8jzaa	I like it. you just need to add more detail. Try to explain more things.|`|09bd9071f261e20518478352da1dad4daa	You have numerous errors in what you've written.  If it is for a school assignment, you might want to correct them.  When you write dialogue, you need to make a new paragraph for each speaker.  Where you write that the mother "weaped", there is no such word; what you should use is wept. You wrote kneow when what you want is either know or knew.  There is no such word as "beated"; beat is the past tense.  There isn't a word "scarched" either.  Reread the last part of your story, and you will find other errors in spelling.  It is not grammatically correct to write:  Me and a few other blacks...  You should never put yourself first and me is not a subject; it should read:  A few other blacks and I...  The story itself begins in an interesting way but then becomes rather incoherent; it's a case of racism in action, but is it realistic?  For an ending you should have your character escape!  By the way, what you've written is not an essay; it's fiction, therefore a short story.  What does your assignment require?  If it isn't due immediately, my advice to you is that you try to rewrite it with changes to make more believable.  Good luck!|`|1y1c5QWHaa	Run it through SpellCheck and GrammarCheck... but other than that, it's great! :) Hope you get a 100!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!
FoIxsunVaa	In my years volunteering serving meals to the homeless (with a group that fed out in the parks, called Food Not Bomb) I found that homeless people were smarter, kinder and more interesting than other people I had met. Later I worked in a corporate job with VP's and the president of a major corporation, and a bigger lot of children I have never met.<br>  <br>  I work at a shelter now. The people are a much better class of folks from corporate America.|`|YmtNel5haa	I think that there are two determining factors here.<br>  1. Money talks, wealth is power people respect power (usually)<br>  2. Wealthy people tend to have an air about them where they seem to expect or command respect.<br>  Poor people and the homeless have most likely faced humility and have been humbled.  The rich should be so lucky.|`|NaM4ZT64aa	I do not treat wealthy people with reverence.  I generally view them with a touch of contempt and (I admit) a bit of resentment.<br>  <br>  I do not treat the poor with either indifference or contempt.<br>  <br>  When it comes to poverty, I am a bit of a socialist.  Sure, you have the right to benefit from your own achievements, but not when it comes from the expense of others, especially when some have far less opportunity to succeed than others.<br>  <br>  The only reason people "revere" the wealthy is because they are wealthy wannabes themselves, like the insecure sycophants who suck up to the "popular crowd" because they want to be "cool."  It's pretty pathetic.<br>  <br>  Personally, I have little desire for wealth or fame, so I do not suffer from this mentality.|`|AA10729675	It seems that society at large and throughout the centuries, and throughout the world, have considered that the rich were to be revered for their capacity to accumulate of keep wealth, and poor have been despised for not having this capacity.  Thinking that money = power.  But when things change and suddenly money is scarce, they change their attitude.  Mostly they suddenly turn to religion to explain that the poor after all was not that less of human being etc.  Or, like in the Byzantine Empire, they made women suffer from their economical failure saying that it was vain and un-christian to wear jewelry.  <br>  The humiliation of the homeless is abominable.  If they have a dog, people look at the dog with pity and not at them.|`|O939tzHSaa	Treated by whom? <br>  <br>  Maybe it's amongst the groups of people they associate with.<br>  Everyone can be judgmental at times, some people even discriminate. <br>  <br>  One persons thoughts aren't always that important, rich or poor.

For some reason or another, she probably felt that since blacks were not welcome in the white community, whites were then also not allowed in the black community.<br>  <br>  When Jem and Scout entered the church, they were respectfully greeted "men stepped back and took off their hats...weekday gestures of respectful attention."

LVpyaf48aa	there are two basic ways to make money as a photographer. both of them assume you can take great photos.<br>  1. work for womeone else. maybe a portrait studio in the mall. easy but low pay.<br>  2. work for yourself. you need to be even better at marketing and advertising and selling than photography.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|D9x1QSgiaa	I like to give THIS advice to anyone who is thinking about getting into the photography business someday. <br>  <br>  The world is full or creative, talented and artistic photographers who will probably never reach their true potential as a professional or successful photographer. The reason is why is because they failed at their business, because they neglected to learn everything that it takes to succeed in the modern business world. <br>  <br>  A successful business owner/operator (of any kind of business) needs to know about boring things like accounting, taxes, payroll, management, financial planning, legal documents, copyrights and marketing as it pertains to photography, writing skills and numerous other things. If you think you can hire people to help you with all of these daily tasks, you'll soon be bankrupt.<br>  <br>  You cannot simply hang your "open for business sign" on the front door and start making money in photography. Photography equipment is expensive. Advertising and marketing cost are HIGH. The competition is fierce, customers are scarce, and getting loans to start a new business is not easy. To succeed in THIS business you must be a "Multi-Tasker". The hours are sometimes long...and the "rewards" are sometimes far and few in between. <br>  <br>  That BS degree in Business Management or Business Administration will be every bit as helpful as the classes you took in Photography.|`|biZRtdqzaa	first of all post this again with what software your running, mac or pc because then i can recomend a photo editing software, what does NIKONs have to do with anything, any quality DSL-R camera will do. also u can get a job by making yourslf available, post ur work o deviantart or something, make a website and put ur stuff there watever, u can get a jobb for newspapers, magazines, clothing company, almost anything
9XLUSMndaa	I was going to answer this from my memory of Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" but I checked Wikipedia first and once again, it stole my thunder.  Darn Wikipedia.  Anyway, I assume whoever wrote the article was right and I should add it generally conforms with my memory of Gibbon.<br>  <br>  I should also add that Rome was sacked by the barbarians three times although not really because the third time it was actually Ravenna where the imperial court had moved to.<br>  <br>  I would assume either the teacher was mistaken or your son misunderstood the teacher:  the entire city was spared, not just one building.  I think people have the wrong idea about "sacking": it means loot, not pillage, rape, raze, etc.  That's more of a 20th century phenomenon.<br>  <br>  wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(455)

But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  I love this book. It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?<br>  <br>  I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more. Some people told me they liked it better than Twilight too.
SuLMCvVfaa	Consider Hughes background.  Consider the fact that he was the first African American to make a living writing.  Consider the title of "Harlem." Harlem during Hughes time was a hub of arts for African American culture.  Also consider that "Harlem"'s alternate title is "Dream Deferred."  <br>  A theme is a message or idea.  Just think about the titles "Dreams" and "Dream Deferred."  They are obviously similar.  So what is Hughes trying to say?  What is the message?  What is the message in relation to the African American community?|`|nE5eqyWeaa	You just need to do some research and there's a tom of information on Langston Hughes on the web.

Not because there was an amazing explosion and millions of orphans died, although that is tragic. If you start off a story with a mother of a child dying in a plane sure it's terrible but it's not really emotionally attaching to the reader, he'll merely shrug and say, "Oh well, I didn't know her anyway."

The Allies had already pummeled the city and it was about to fall.   Japan was the one who got us and we had to finish the job there.|`|M2thieHqaa	The overall mood of the country was distinctly Anti-War. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that many of the American people had fought in the World War I and knew of war's horrors. Many American young men had returned home blinded or maimed from gas attacks, or so badly wounded that they never fully recovered. Those who could marry and start families and drilled their experiences into their own children, who were also part of the anti-war groups. <br>  <br>  Those who spoke out against Hitler or the Japanese empire were branded warmongers and jeered in the streets or beaten up. People asked them if they were willing to sacrifice their own children's lives in foreign wars; if they answered "yes", they were not believed or hated even more. <br>  <br>  There was a popular political cartoon at the time showing a young man in a soldier's outfit entering a building marked "European Theater", and a woman dressed like Death showing him in. Death says, "Of course I'll treat you right. I knew your father!" The implication, of course, is that Death awaits anyone who gets involved in the war in Europe, and that no good will come of it. <br>  <br>  That's how strong the anti-war sentiment was in the USA, before Pearl Harbor.

It is crucial that they are shot in the same position, and with things not moving into and out of the frame. If you are in the Manual Mode, you should see a little scale. For HDR photography, i use One Under, One Normal, and One Over.<br>  <br>  Do not change the aperture, you do not want varying amounts of depth of field in your photographs. All you change is the shutter speed. You should be able to see the effect on your screen. Change it until you hit one that is under-exposed, but not too under, then to one that is normal, and to one that is over exposed, but not to over. <br>  <br>  The Photomatix website offers tutorials.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/27145979@N02/3230114478/in/set-72157612643573734/" rel="nofollow">http://flickr.com/photos/27145979@N02/32...</a>|`|MMnjWEM7aa	Don't worry, you've got everything you need!  Well... hopefully you've got a tripod, but if not, I'm sure you can find something that you can set your camera on in order to keep the frame still.<br>  <br>  To make a really neat HDR, you might want to opt for 7 exposures rather than three.  Probably not more than that.  That way you get more dimentions (shadows and highlights).<br>  <br>  Start with the properly exposed exposure, go up three, and go down three.   <br>  <br>  If you want to see the one I did today, email me and I'll send it to you.|`|bo54Lw59aa	Check your manual to see if it has a bracketing function.  That'll take the three pictures, one over, one under, one normal.<br>  <br>  You can do it yourself if you have a manual mode.  Set for f/8, and take a bunch of shots at different speeds.  You should get a wide range to work from then.

zlHgIltOaa	I would suggest seeing the movie as well as others, to start off with. It's pretty necessary to watch multiple movies to get a background of Bollywood.<br>  <br>  But here are some of the elements of S.M. (some are stereotypically romantic Bollywood, others are just cultural).<br>  -Hindu v. Muslim conflict<br>  -slum conditions<br>  -corruption, dehumanization, gangs, prostitution, criminal activity.....the downside of essentially all cities. But I would suggest looking into specific details for this category. There's a lot going on.<br>  -romance, with Jamal calling Latika "the most beautiful woman in the world." And she is very very beautiful, like all Bollywood actresses.|`|9561bfcf1a05d328055061d4b26e8f40aa	Well i don't know about the culture , but in the slums of India people actually use little children to make money and they burn their eyes so they are blind .. and when people see that they give them more money because they are sympathetic of them. good luck with your essay|`|CpeGFIJmaa	I haven't seen the movie yet as I am reading a book Q & A by Vikas Swarup on which the movie is based. From my perspective as an Indian and a foreigner, the story is mix of imagination and reality.All the Millionaire questions are Centrale around real incidents with imaginary sprinkling, to make the story interesting. It is true that an orphan borned in India would be the most unfortunate event in his life on the background that there is no social security system for unprivileged in India. There are few govt plans for orphan, but because of corruption, funding won't reach to the orphan kids. It is all linked to corrupt politician, criminals, very rich people and police as a vicious circle.<br>  As far as Indian culture is concerned, love part of it is very true. This little boys love for his sister(not real sister - Shantaram's daughter), for his friend Salim, for his not seen mum (note he never blame her for abandoning him) is just magnificent. It shows Indians are emotional, they would do anything for their loved ones. It is true in any part of world but as far as love concern Indians go a step ahead. There is also a touch on how Indians face racism in their own country by an Australian.<br>  I am still to read more on this book and will replay again.|`|XkSdLIbZaa	i am indian, i was born in india (because i was a month early) and i never went back until this past december. i must say i was COMPLETELY blown away from the things i saw. and i was so confused with my thoughts. Slumdog millionaire is a phenomenal movie, just to put that out there. Every aspect of that movie is true. As for culture, you can see the slums as a huge problem in the inidan community. this is due to overpopulation. if you noticed in the movie, when their slum gets burned down, there is a man that is burning and runs across a police station. they do nothing. this is true as well. the police system in india is so corrupt, and they are so lazy, they only care about the higher middle class. if you are poor, they don't care about you. the gangs really do run the country. some are better than others. the trains, the obsessions, the selfishness, it all has morphed into the true culture of india, as sad as it is to admit it. There is a good side of the culture, but the movie shows the bad. and its a great problem. i hope i helped you out on your essay, i know i would want some help about a country i didn't know about with some experienced help. so good luck with your essay, and if you haven't seen the movie yet, watch it. not just for your essay (i'm sure it would help lol) but its very eye opening.|`|zqtWl1aJaa	Slumdog is a racist movie made by a xenophobic British, who thinks sahibs should still be ruling.

By then Hitler had taken over most of Europe and was making inroads into the UK, Africa, and parts of the Middle East. Hitler also had allies in South America. <br>  The Japanese attacked us with Pearl Harbor. I am torn about the bombing in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Japanese would not have surrendered if it wasn't for those bombs.<br>  But to answer your question, 6 million Jews murdered by the German and European Nazis? Yes, it was right to defeat them.

1thzSbS8aa	What I can tell you is that original watercolors do not come in editions, and that "societe de verification de la nouvelle gravure internationale" translates to "society of verification of the new international engraving". Engraving is a method of printmaking from metal plates. What you have is undoubtedly an etching, and if has a watercolory or tonal look to it, it's an etching method known as aquatint.<br>  <br>  The rest of the description is too vague to aid in identification. There are many many many depictions of quaint village streets in Europe, by artists known and unknown. <br>  <br>  If you can put a picture of it online and link to it, there is a possibility someone might recognize the piece or the signature.<br>  <br>  Edit:The signature looks like "Gantner", and the piece looks like an etching (though it could also be a lithograph, hard to tell). There is an artist named Bernard Gantner (born 1928) who is still alive and did do etchings, though he is more known for paintings and lithography. It might be him. <br>  <br>  You can see some of his images here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.art-cadre.com/art_artist.php?=SID&lang=en&nom_artiste=GANTNER%20Bernard" rel="nofollow">http://www.art-cadre.com/art_artist.php?...</a>|`|vBeDV359aa	i've used google and typed in village painting but it is hard to find it maybe you could put a link to a pic of the painting and it would be easier to find the painting  <br>  i would love to see the pating too!

msNXomjTaa	There is no simple answer to this question!<br>  <br>  Do you want a Bible that translates each word accurately, but loses the sense of what is being said, or one that translates the sense, but loses the wording?  Do you want one easy to read, or one that, while accurate, is much harder to read?<br>  <br>  One of the best word-for-word translation is the NRSV (New Revised Standard Version).  It translates the language very closely, albeit not 100%, as this often does not help.  However, it is somewhat stilted, and not a "fun" read.  The NIV (New International Version) is a more free flowing translation, and easier to read, but is not as word for word accurate.<br>  <br>  The best, of course, is to read it in the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek.  Tricky for most of us though!  When I am studying a passage, I like to compare several versions, as you get a much better sense than a single reading would give you.<br>  <br>  However, while reading any version is great, study is also important.  For example, the Good Samaritan story.  We know how kind he was, and how good an example his was.  However, when we understand that the Samaritans were outsiders, disliked by Jews (who did not consider them Jewish), and who Jews would not even speak to, we can understand the depth of this man's compassion all the more.<br>  <br>  If I had to recommend one, I would suggest the NIV.  A great place to start, but don't stop there!|`|Z8Jw9mDuaa	The King James Version of the Bible. It is the most original version, and it hasn't been revised or touched with modern day hands or minds.

I agree with them all.  I just want to say: don't get the Jerusalem version.  I bought it in French (La Bible de Jerusalem) and really it is not good. It is a good thing I have other bibles in English and they are far better.  I use the Saint Joseph edition. <br>  I would like to point out two things as a Latin teacher: two soldiers approached Jesus on the cross.  One lifted toward him a sponge full of vinegar. And people have said how cruel this soldier was.  Not so.  Jesus was thirsty, the sponge was to alleviate his thirst and vinegar was like a medicine at the time.  The second one not accidentally speared him, to help him die, to shorten his suffering.  <br>  As for the Jews, they had condemned Jesus.  Long ago.  They wanted Barabbas freed.  Barabbas was a criminal.  Pilatus washed his hands from this petty trial that did not really concern Rome.  But can we condemn a whole people because one time, a crowd decided they wanted Barabbas.  And they in fact were the instrument for the prophecy to take place, like Juda.  Your mother is not to blame.  Our ignorance is to blame.  What we have been fed is to blame.  But it can change.  We only have to study.|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	Maybe you should read what historians are saying about Jesus Christ.<br>  Torah is the Original bible. Which is most of the Old Testament.

From a purely numerology standpoint, 3 is the number of communication and interaction, also of neutrality, seven is the number of illusion and things not seen - like watching a really good magic show [7 is often associated with drugs or television, which aren't in LOTR}, and nine is the completion of a cycle / highest level a thing can reach. Other than that, I think it was just randomly picked, although the fact that 3 and 7 are prime number may be a factor.

Your ancestors may have come on the ship that followed the Mayflower, the site I found may have lied, or your facts may be wrong.<br>  <br>  There are 400,000 free genealogy sites. <br>  <br>  The US Census is reasonably reliable from 1850 - 1930, but you have to watch it. I have found nephews recorded as sons and sons-in-law recorded under their wife's surname.<br>  <br>  Before 1850 you are into family Bibles, county histories, county marriage recorrds, church records, family legends and such, which are harder to find.<br>  <br>  Most of us serious amateurs use ancestry.com. Your should start with your grandparents and work backwards, veryifying carefully.|`|AA12343309	My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet. We get your question many time a day. So I have cut and am pasting an answer.<br>  <br>  Websites that only have family trees are not worth a tinker's curse unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.<br>  <br>  Right before Christmas of 2008, I found out I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1957. It was the same year Hurricane Audrey hit in our part of the world. Hey! we had been dead for 51 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!<br>  <br>  I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.<br>  <br>  This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.<br>  <br>  Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family trees.<br>  <br>  Cyndi'sList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.<br>  <br>  Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.<br>  <br>  However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.<br>  <br>  A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.<br>  <br>  Rootsweb and FamilySearch.org are 2 free sites but remember verify information in family trees with documents/records. If you don't you don't know whether it is accurate or not.|`|mcpu4ZDtaa	Oh hi!<br>  <br>  Yeah there are several sites in the internet who offers searching family history but I prefer to recommend the Web Detective site because I've tried it already and it works for me. <br>  <br>  Web  Detective is internet's #1 investigative resource since 1995.  Most professionals and private investigators used this for personal purposes.<br>  You can search your family and anyone's family history. Not only that you can also have a background check of anyone even if he/she is not related to you.  Just give it a try, however there's nothing wrong in trying, right?<br>  <br>  Here's the link: <a href="http://www.web-detective.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.web-detective.com/</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck!!!|`|7ZeT3Krkaa	I use Ancestry. com a lot to view original records-especially census, land records, birth, death, and marriage records.  They also have books that have been uploaded with family and local/regional/state histories.  Rootsweb is another one that I use some.  <br>  <br>  I have been able to find a few records on MiGenWeb, which is the Michigan section of the USGenWeb project.  All the information has been entered by volunteers who have transcribed original documents, so there are some errors, and not all information from all areas is available; it depends on how many volunteers there are for a county and how much time they have been able to devote to the work.<br>  <br>  Family trees found online are notoriously unreliable.  They may give you some starting points, but most have no verification for the information they contain, so you will still have to search out records.

mO1s4pMgaa	Evermore by Alyson Noel<br>  Ever was a normal high school girl living a pretty good life. But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her|`|Rhuyvq2Zaa	Series...<br>  <br>  First of all, you should take a few minutes to sit down and read "The Tales of Beedle the Bard"  They are well written and entertaining, and the commentaries by Dumbledore are very witty.<br>  <br>  The Bartimaeus Trilogy (Jonathan Stroud) - these are some of my favorite books.

It's not even in my top 20.<br>  <br>  Have you read the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis? It's pretty awesome.<br>  As is Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkin.|`|swigidUeaa	ok, don't read twilight, it sucks. <br>  The chronicles of narnia really are like elementary level, they're good if you want to read something simple. <br>  Lord of the rings is very long and very boring, it's more of an adult book. <br>  The series of unfortunate events is good, it's very original.<br>  <br>  The Eregon series is good, so is the Bourne series. The Left behind. Libba Bray's books, but I don't remember the name of that series.

ceBTTCPwaa	Great Expectations is written in a semi-autobiographical style and is the story of the orphan Pip, writing his life from his early days of childhood until adulthood. The story can also be considered semi-autobiographical of Dickens, like much of his work, drawing on his experiences of life and people.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/greatex/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/greatex/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/greatexpectati..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/greatexpectati...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/G..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/G...</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	When Pip finds that Biddy has married Joe, he gives up on expectation-making. For good. He’s worn out for all of the dashed hopes and ruined expectations. Biddy and Joe’s forgiveness comes easily, but that makes sense. Their affection is not tied to any contract or expectation. True love and friendship, Pip comes to find, are beyond expectations.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Pip/Great Expectations|`|kfOpbbCyaa	Because Biddy and Joe had named their son, Pip, after him, and the tombstone was of Pip's parents. The tombstone of Pip's father (whom the original Pip was named after) read, in part, "sacred to the memory of Philip Pirrip." Therefore, the tombstone was interesting to little Pip (Joe's son), because it showed him the origin of his own name.<br>  <br>  There was also the fact that little Pip and Pip were much alike and understood each other. So, showing little Pip the history of his own name was giving him a connection (continuity) to Pip and his father before.<br>  <br>  You can read the scene in the last chapter: <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/dickens/greatexpectations/59/" rel="nofollow">http://www.online-literature.com/dickens...</a>

4CAPrr7Caa	look at my story. ^_^<br>  ..um, maybe you can say there is an evil sorceress/queen that prevents night from coming. it seems ironic but you can say that her power is fire, and she keeps the night because some moon magic can abolish her.<br>  <br>  ..people or her slaves are burned when they do against her will, and the people are hot and tired and wishing for some coolness to come. everything is on fire, like hell, being her as the queen.<br>  <br>  ..but some prophesy say that two child, a boy and a girl, can stop her at once, if they would be able to DRAW THE NIGHT. but unfortunately, these children were just a slave' son, and a maid's daughter so they haven't learned magic (and they never know they were the one destined in the prophesy)<br>  <br>  ..a rebellion broke up and it consists of slaves federation. the boy and the girl, secretly attending the meetings, learned to use magic because the meetings are also trainings.<br>  <br>  ..when the fight came, of course they are not allowed to fight, so they just wait on the shore, where the sun is clearly seen, never setting. they pray to gods that their parents were all right, that if they just can help, they would do everything, even death can't spare them from helping. they tried their magic, and most of these are water-bending.<br>  <br>  ..meanwhile in the fight, which is in the town in the hill above the sea, the rebellion is losing, even the queen has only few allies which is the ogres. The sun shone brightly as ever, because she knew that the prophecy won't come true. She killed all the child she had seen, and she thought that the prophecy is already broken because maybe these two children are one of those she killed in the burning town. But she doesn't know that the prophesied children are at shore and pleading to the gods to help their families. but, she found them, and was astonished for seeing slaves playing water magic, so she tried to kill them at once. But, the sea enraged and protected the children. She can't fight with the water, cause she's fire.. But she had a dagger and killed them both. The sea became anxious as ever and hold the girl and the boy to the air, until they are lighting. Not the lights of fire, but white blinding light that looks as if the gods in heaven were angered and revive the children. The girl controlled the waves while the boy became the moon himself. The water is rising up to the very hill and the sun is already setting. The queen and the ogres seemed to lose power, and the sea ate them all. Then when the moon rose up beautifully, the war is over, and they are now free. The boy became the spirit of the moon, and the girl became the spirit of the ocean. They became the guards that keeps people cool at night. Sun still shines, but twilight came and the mesmerizing night dawns everyone.|`|bQ9JN7KIaa	It is the year 6712.  People have gained complete control over the earth and they have learned all the mysteries that reside on it. Unfortunately, due to unknown spacial events, the sun begins to move towards earth. The sun gets so close that everyones faces begin to melt. People scream in agonizing pain and are forced to kill each others families for the sake of ending the torture. Fires erupt out of the skies and rain down onto many cities, smashing houses out of existance and igniting everything into a flaming blaze. As everyone realises that the end is near, people begin doing crazy things that they wouldnt normally do in public. Some go steal tvs, some run around naked with a bra strapped to their head, and others go and screw chickens in the butt. Some of them go mad and begin smashing their heads into telephone poles. Everything is chaotic, but then one brave kid stands in the middle of the street singing kumbayah my lord. Everyone, startled by this brave action, begin singing together and all die happily in pain. the end|`|SZvoBFUuaa	I would write about about a dream and in the dream the sun didnt set so  it was all over news how ND there is something wrong then all the lights go out and exciting stuff then you wake up!|`|AA11180647	vampires..........think about it|`|5E5gL9fVaa	If the sun doesn't set it either means that the earth has moved closer to the sun (in which case everyone would have to move underground where it's cooler and where the water won't evaporate) or it means that the earth has stopped spinning (which means on one side of the earth it is forever daylight and the other is forever nighttime). <br>  <br>  For a story about a legend i would set it in a world which doesn't spin and i'd have the protagonist having to journey into the darkside of the world for something.

dQmFoRRiaa	Aye, and there's the rub... this is the dream of the finite creature who must strive as if in vain hope he could find the fruition of his efforts.  If only we could strive to be more godlike and achieve it, but that seems not to be in the program.  Titans climbing toward the realm of the gods are only to be mocked and rebuffed.  And yet we impart to life some -- perhaps most -- of its meaning by striving, however vainly... truly a nobly Sisyphean task.  Your poem is beautifully rhymed and metered, a philosophical and phonological gem.  Thanks for sharing this... we usually have to settle for far less here, and the crusts have become all too familiar..
dQmFoRRiaa	I must say that I find the long lines here to be a most inviting format.  I've found that they provide opportunities for a variety of effects -- phonological and rhetorical -- and you have exploited those opportunities to the utmost.  Your poem is a poignant piece that reflects wistfully and ruefully on the past, the innocence of childhood, and the losses of our mature years (yes, I understand those too).  The rhythmic cadence of the lines, as well as the couplet format with enjambment, gives an almost lilting character to this poem when it is read aloud.  But Ian, this is no lilt, no cheerful ditty.  <br>  <br>  O’ Time devourer of my youth and strength, my very hopes and dreams,<br>  Which flows swift and remorseless and relentless in cascading streams<br>  And yet does not consign to sweet oblivion my yearning thought<br>  Of all I had, and hoped to have, of all that’s come to null and naught.<br>  <br>  Why must the Mother of us all bring each to wisdom much too late<br>  When he has appetite and dreams, but not the strength to either sate?<br>  The world, it seems, is fell and strange, and to our plight indifferent;<br>  Could he who fathers-forth all things have brought us here for this intent?<br>  <br>  In days now so remote they seem a realm of vast antiquity<br>  I lived for joy, and life my toy held nothing but delight for me.<br>  But now more gray I rue the days I oft spent in a fool’s pursuits;<br>  And, always waiting, my devouring shadow stands and convolutes<br>  <br>  The plans I had, the dreams I held; the subtle lines that frame all things<br>  That I held full and free I thought, are bound instead by subtle strings –<br>  The cobwebs that my habits formed became encrusted, dusty, strong, <br>  And then, at last, they throttled me; they stole my life, my love, my song.<br>  <br>  They stole my friends, they stole my glee, soon freedom and my life entire;<br>  They stole what was most dear to me, and yet they left me my desire,<br>  Desire and yearning for the timeless kingdom that I ruled at ten,<br>  The kingdom that still calls to me, where I’ve no hope to rule again.<br>  <br>  And I, prince regent in my fading kingdom of diminished light<br>  That rules me utterly by day and yet I conquer still at night,<br>  Now know what I possessed at ten was gold and gems beyond compare,<br>  And now all's lost, and at what cost, and yet the price I paid was fair.<br>  <br>  Such is the sad estate of all, what we need most none understands<br>  And yet the Mother of us all will nonetheless make her demands.<br>  She sends us out, but evening comes, and then she calls us in from play<br>  And we cannot return once gone; Time’s drum beats on, we cannot stay.<br>  <br>  Thank you for your excellent tribute to Time, which for each and every one of us gains an ineluctable victory regardless of our intentions.

S1EUulhEaa	The months of the year were changed. So Brumaire is the month in which he came to power. I think 18th February or so.
M2thieHqaa	Yes, it is a meat grinder. It always has been.  <br>  <br>  Afghanistan has been the country which, historically and militarily-speaking, has always broken armies. Remember, Afghanistan defeated Alexander the Great! <br>  <br>  Here are the main reasons why the present war in Afghanistan is faltering, and will undoubtedly fail:<br>  <br>  Geography - Afghanistan is a highly mountainous country with hundreds of small valleys and very few roads.<br>  <br>  Transportation - Travel inside the country is limited to either horseback, ATV, foot, or air; very little else.<br>  <br>  Government - Despite an "established" government in Kabul, the country has always relied more on tribal chieftains and intertribal agreements. Clans and families are frequently sealed in alliance through marriage, and tribal customs still prevail in the 21st century. The Soviets tried desperately to "modernize" the country during the Russian occupation, with no success. Koranic law is obeyed more than an imposed order of an outside power.  <br>  <br>  Commerce - Afghanistan's primary cash crop is and always has been opium. This is a tradition which dates back thousands of years. Despite condemnation from the international community, local farmers know there is always a demand for it, and know that it alone can be relied upon to fill their coffers; far more so than relying on international aid. Thus far, the only organization that has any impact on the opium trade has been the Taliban. <br>  <br>  Any conqueror will have to overcome the difficulties above to successfully pacify the country. Thus far, no one ever has.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	I am appalled.  Especially when the countries that  have the most at stake in Afghanistan allow us to do the heavy lifting and provide only advice.|`|JS3Zy6ASaa	The inviolability of Afghanistan is a myth.  It has in fact been conquered repeatedly: by the Persians, by Alexander (study history Lawrence) by the Arabs, by the Mongols.  The Soviets suffered far less in Afghanistan than the Americans in Vietnam.<br>  <br>  That being said, the war in Afghanistan is a military adventure best withdrawn from.  If the West wants to combat Muslim extremism, it should do it at home.|`|94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	It's the heavily-mountainous terrain that makes it difficult to conquer (and also, not worth the effort)...Just ask the Russians; it was the Soviets Veitnam.<br>  <br>  Why else do we fail there?  Partly it is due to the culture-clash.  America is an individualist culture; Afghanistan is collectivist.  So, Americans believe a whole movement can be based around one individual...When in reality, it is led by a large collective group; going after one individual will have little effect.|`|b3456135bf4f0f591eca2857f5c90758aa	You either fight an enemy on his doorstop or on your own , which do you prefer , their fifth column is already here bought in by the labour government and protected by European human rights legislation , and when the lords try to deport them labour makes sure they have plenty of money to fight deportation. So our young men have an enemy in front and behind them to contend with.|`|AA11441385	No invading army, from Alexander the Great through to the British and Russians has managed to subdue Afghanistan for long.  Terrain and a particularly independently minded population.|`|WZNaNvplaa	The main reason Afghanistan is a difficult country to control militarily is its terrain. Mostly mountainous, it played a large part in why the tribal system that dominates there has remained so strong for so long. With the tribes usually putting their own affairs ahead of the welfare of the nation as a whole, it has suffered endemic fighting for millenia. The same terrain makes it hard to conquer the land, since the Afghans usually can retreat, hide, and wait until the circumstances favor them.<br>     Still, Afghanistan is not exactly like sending meat into a grinder. The same tribal conflicts usually mean that politically savvy invaders can gain allies among the tribes. And by saturating a region with troops it's possible to enforce some peace. Not that you will stop the loss of troops from attrition, but it would be more like a cut that keeps oozing blood rather than shoving an arm into said meatgrinder.|`|D19F6m92aa	I don't think so.  Allied casualties are light.  <br>  Afghanistan's have always opposed foreign armies.  One reason our casualties are so light, is we have respected local culture.

6ef13d76058bd49c12e2d76cb4ec7227aa	I had similar fears and it was most likely anxiety.  i read somewhere that the very fact that you are thinking about this means you are very normal.  you see, people who are truly "crazy" don't realize they are heading that way and have no "what if" thoughts.  Mind, body, and spirit.  These three are connected and should be focused on throughout your life.  Are you exercising enough, going to church (or any spiritual focus), and you should meditate to.  Try sitting and deep breathing for 5 minutes.  Think of nothing (which is very hard to do).  Get to the point where you can empty your mind focusing on nothing but breath (life) coming in, and exhaling (taking bad feelings, tension, anxiety, etc. out).  Service to others.  What do you do to help/change others?  Volunteer, or work to do that.  Finally, when you feel your life is bad, go visit a children's hospital, or walk through the cancer ward of the hospital and just look at all the families visiting with their sick loved ones.  Life is about experiences.  There is never a "right time".  We all will die, and we can't take our money, or accomplishments with us.  It doesn't matter what car you drive, or how much you made.  Life is about sharing experiences, and connections with your fellow man.|`|yzULbPLgaa	You need to believe in something Greater than your self.

BBfIXcI0aa	Well, I'd prepare one that shows your personality! Obviously since they asked for it, they're wanting to see what you're like, and how you conceptualise what you're like. If they want to see you do something edgier, they can always ask you to do a cold reading.<br>  If you're normally a very light sort of person, I would look for something comedic, but only you know what suits you. If I were you, I'd just go to my local library or bookstore and skim through plays until I found a piece that reminded me of myself.|`|NjYCvfYGaa	I suggest doing a comedy. Make sure it is age appropriate, you don't want to do a monologue for a 13 year old. Go to your local bookstore/library and look for some published monologues(obviously) and skim through them.

XOgvpDiZaa	Good job for a beginner! :-D Boy, when I was a beginner I couldn't sing and play guitar...in fact, I can't even sing and play the song now lol!<br>  <br>  May I suggest you buy a few guitar picks? The reason I suggest this is because it's what guitarists use, and is much easier to strum with a pick than with your thumb. They're not even expensive and come in different sizes and feels. Try them out and buy multiples of the one you like best. Plus, there's a world of difference in sound when you use a pick. The way that your guitar sounds now is what it's supposed to sound like when you just use your thumb to strum. With a pick the sound will be brighter and fuller.<br>  <br>  "Sitting, Waiting, Wishing" is a fun song to play. By the way the chorus strum is the same as what you play on the verses, but it's a continuous strum. <br>  <br>  You don't mute the strings when you play the verses; you'll hear in the recording that there's a "chuck" sound, and that's created by hitting the strings with the side of your right hand (do that in place of muting the strings). <br>  <br>  And I love your guitar!!<br>  <br>  Keep it up!|`|AM33tqYAaa	it sounds like that, but not like it should? then what should it sound like?
iT9S20zvaa	Yikes! An 11-year-old girl reading the Twilight series?.....That had sex in it, my friend.  It surely did. <br>  <br>  Recommended reads for an 11-year-old:<br>  --Enthusiasm by Polly Shulman; this one is very clean and humorous.  It also stresses the importance of friendships and (as an added plus) might even get her interested in Jane Austen. (contemporary)<br>  <br>  --My Life and Death by Alexandra Canarsie written by Susan Heyboer O'Keefe; Alexandra, or Allie, has just moved to a new town and is unable to make friends.  Instead, she spends her time visiting the funerals of strangers, which leads her to believe that a student who supposedly drowned might actually have been murdered. (contemporary/mystery) <br>  <br>  --The Boy on a Black Horse by Nancy Springer; A young girl notices a boy riding a beautiful horse and discovers that he is caring for his two siblings without the help of a parent; meaningful and compelling. The boy and his siblings were victims of abuse, though there is nothing graphic mentioned in terms of violence or otherwise. (contemporary)<br>  <br>  --Well Wished by Franny Billingsley; A young girl makes a wish in her town's famous well that, unsurprisingly enough, goes very wrong.  Franny Billingsley's writing is beautiful, and her books contain meaningful lessons (though they are a little thin; fantasy).<br>  <br>  --The Princess Bride by William Goldman; kind of self-explanatory (fantasy)<br>  <br>  --Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine; Ella, the main character, is cursed with obedience and sets out to free herself.  Levine's book is a retelling of Cinderella. (Nice characterizations; fantasy/fairy tale) <br>  <br>  --The Wall and the Wing and its sequel, The Chaos King, by Laura Ruby; Hilarious and original series that stresses the importance of inner beauty and true friendship (futuristic fantasy set in a contemporary setting)<br>  <br>  None of the books listed above contain sex or drugs.  I hope the 11-year-old girl in question finds something wonderful to read.|`|135587141c574a1880bd4e34dcbdb34caa	The Chronicles of Narnia series by CS Lewis.

At first, Sidney was repulsed by the gaggle of girls that hung on his every word, that is, until he explained that he has no control over the attraction others have for him, it’s just one thing out of many that he is just as confused about as she is. Cael knows what he is, but he has no idea how or why. Their search for answers sends them across the world and forces them to go to extreme measures in order to get those answers.<br>  (The sequel comes out in march, it's called Illusions)<br>  <br>  City of Dreams by Stefanie Ellis:<br>  <br>  Skyler Ashford is a confused, over-analyzing twenty-five year old. She escapes a small town and bad relationship, winding up in New York City. She hopes to start over fresh and become someone new. Instead, she stumbles across a man. A man she hasn’t seen since high school, a man who always held her heart. However, things have changed for him, he’s become a world renowned figure in the world of entertainment.

I'm going to YAC, too. I already sent in my application but I'm only going to the 2 weeks. The third week isn't worth it, because you have to pay to be an EXTRA in a movie when in the end you get paid to be an extra. The role isn't even a speaking role. That will save you like $2000.<br>  I'm super excited and it's my first time.<br>  If you want to talk about the camp just email me!

Especially when you can have more control over living if you get some help.<br>  Death at best is a mystery. What if you don't get to decide?<br>  I mean you didn't get to decide to be born. Its the Creators choice and it just seems to me that if we cheat, it won't work. Like for instance, maybe all the pain goes with us and we still have to work it out in another realm. Scary to me. Life at least has possibility. There are things to help life go right. Therapy, medication, people who are supportive, who love us and will help if asked. In ten years the things that hurt now may not matter then. Please get some professional help. Call a Crisis Line, go to a hospital or to a doctor. Start somewhere. After you have done all you can to get in control of your own happiness, you may find things are different.<br>  <br>  Editing your poem<br>  <br>  Why do I think death is a treat<br>  I have no proof. Only thoughts at night<br>  ranging from painful to sweet.<br>  <br>  I like to believe death will take my troubles away<br>  Take my pain and magically transform me.<br>  I wish for death to consume me every day.<br>  <br>  Wanting to die doesn't mean I am bad<br>  It means I am way beyond the feeling of sad<br>  Even though my problems cause me to fall<br>  I don't fear dying. I want death to call<br>  <br>  Life is a punishment for me to endure<br>  Death would be mercy swift and sure<br>  Those who love me would weep many tears<br>  But my life is sorry and filled with fears<br>  <br>  In my horrible terrible life, death seems to be my friend<br>  I plan and practice for the end<br>  The only thing of which I'm not certain<br>  Is what's behind that final curtain.<br>  <br>  Might I be wrong in all my thoughts of dying<br>  Is it possible its the devil lying?<br>  Is it a torture yet unknown<br>  From which I can not ever return home?<br>  <br>  Perhaps there is a God for me<br>  Waiting for my surrender<br>  Wanting to bless and set me free<br>  I will pray to the blessing sender<br>  Just in case there is more<br>  To my life than I think is in store. <br>  <br>  I will give my life my all<br>  Before I let the curtain fall<br>  I will gain my power<br>  I am too young for the final hour<br>  <br>  I don't want to hurt those who love me<br>  I don't want my mom to cry endlessly<br>  I just want the pain to stop<br>  It can stop if I do the work to stop it.

K2h6M1xqaa	I finished my first novel when I was 18.  It took a couple of years to write and it was a complete mess.<br>  <br>  --Gloria, according to her website, had the guidance of both parents, both literary people, to help out with research and critical analysis and general support.  That must have been a wonderful environment in which to learn!  Mozart came from a highly musical family as well.  Having passion, intelligence and natural skills combined with parents you click with who are in the same field and who are eager to share what they know. . , dang!  What a powerhouse combination!<br>  <br>  Gordon Korman started writing when he was 16.  I don't know what kind of family or resources he had, but his books were incredible as well.<br>  <br>  Some kids just have an intuitive grasp of how people and reality works and are able to bring that to the world.  As this girl gets older and gains some real experience in her present life, she'll probably really start to blow people away.  As it stands, I don't see how it is possible that she isn't working primarily from archetypal story concepts gleaned from previous reading.  It's only as you get older and have had the chance to test your theories of life against the real world that new and genuine insights really start to blossom.  She might be able to bring something new to the world.  That doesn't happen very often.<br>  <br>  --Anyway, very cool news item.  Thanks for posting!<br>  <br>  -Cheers!

SuLMCvVfaa	"The Shepherd" is a poem about a shepherd who lives at peace because he loves caring for his sheep and his sheep love him.  Now you need to consider what you think the shepherd and the sheep symbolize.<br>  <br>  "Montemorency" is based on Montmorency Falls in Quebec, Canada.  In the sonnet, the poet captures the power and exhilerence the speaker feels in the presence of these falls and the connection he feels to nature inspired by the falls.  Wolfe and Montcalm were the two opposing versions over Quebec during the French and Indian war, and the speaker feels he can hear this history in the sound of the falls.
dmzan6D0aa	i would recommend Microsoft access. it is built for just that purpose. you can store a multitude of books and authors along with any kinds of additional info you want.
7ONKVbbiaa	Neither one is necessary, although you can do dna testing if you want. It won't give you names or dates. <br>  Off the bat.. one of your blocks is that the people you are working, are recent in genealogy terms. Your immediate need is to confirm when/ where Joseph died. I find no Joseph Brant died in 1965, and one 1965 for a Joseph Brandt, in Louisiana. The one record you need is his death certificate, which will give you the dates, his place of birth, and names of his parents. I am using the social security death index (free at rootsweb.com), and he may have had a different first name; you may be off on the year. Your mom's birth certificate may also have his location of birth. I don't find Carol Brant in the file either. <br>  With grandpa's death cert, it will open the door. His social security number will also help, as you can order that file which should have more leads. If mom can lead you to the cemetery name, that may also help. <br>  The key thing is that recent records are more likely to be restricted, but once you get past that, you can get into the historical items. The US census is open for research up to 1930.. it seems that Joseph's age is close to that line. Assuming that you can get the death certs for the grandparents, you also can get specific dates.. THEY should be in the census in 1930, which has much more info. <br>  Your main thing is opening talk in family, to get to the documents.<br>  edit<br>  Neue is showing up in the familyfiles at rootsweb, and German for sure. It has EARLIER ones that you mention. You need to connect from present until finding the immigrant, but keep those files in mind.|`|7ZeT3Krkaa	A genealogical DNA test will not tell you anything about who your ancestors were unless there are others in the line who have had the test.  The testing companies have to have samples to compare against each other.  Unless you know for sure that an uncle or cousin has had the test, it is a waste of money.<br>  Your mother should be able to get a copy of her birth certificate, which will give you a place to start your research.  Whether you hire a professional or not depends more on whether you would rather have someone else do all the work, or have the joy of discovery yourself.<br>  Either way, have fun learning new things.|`|PsR3zS4iaa	Washington Co., Oregon cemeteries--a Brandt is listed in Emanuel Cem., but that's it.
PhJTFyZFaa	Aww!!!It's so sweet and cute...and funny.I absolutely LOVE romance/love books they're soo....they make wish i had someone like that and i just love when they're decribing how the feel,it's like ur that person.that's the way ur prologue makes me feel...happy in love<br>  <br>                                                             :]|`|oSsVEXMxaa	I'll be honest, it's a bit cheesy. It doesn't fulfill the purpose of a prologue, which is to draw in readers and introduce the setting, characters, and story. It just sort of jumps into random dialogue between two random characters. The thing is...we've seen tons of love stories, usually the same thing over and over. And just from this snippet, it doesn't seem like anything new. It's cute, but generic and fluffy. In short, why should readers care about these characters? Maybe if you posted more I could get a better picture, but from what I've read here I wouldn't be interested in reading further.<br>  <br>  I think you should try giving your characters a unique "voice" so you can tell who they are even from dialogue. And putting physical description right in the first few paragraphs is very off-putting. Your characters should be able to shine without knowing whether their hair is shaggy or brown, and how chiseled their abs are.<br>  <br>  It's not terrible or even bad, don't get me wrong. But it's not interesting. There are a few grammar mistakes, but they can be easily fixed. It's your story as a whole that needs to be further developed.<br>  <br>  So, yeah...best of luck and no matter what, keep writing!|`|kmzCMDlHaa	It was very good!!!!! I hope you get it publlished and becomes a book i would buy it!|`|tyNzkO0waa	It is really cute and really sweet, but you keep switching from talking in the third person to in the first person. In some parts you are saying I and other parts you say she. If you want the last line to be our story, you will have to change it to be in the first person for the rest of the prologue. Other then that it is great!

He was drawn especially to social justice and to commenting on the inequalities inherent to Victorian society. While England was growing rich and powerful in the era of colonialism and the Industrial Revolution, Dickens saw the injustice that ran rampant among the working and lower classes. He sought to document Britain’s underbelly and to explore the fight for survival in a time of such wealth.<br>  <br>  There are a number of other sub-themes as well.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Great Expectations
g8Slbc4eaa	I usually gather all my favorite songs, usually a mixer of both upbeat and mellow or fast and slow songs. This way on one track I got “Just Dance” by Lady Gaga, and then it gets slower with “Bleeding Love” by Leona Lewis, and even more slow, and picks back up. But that’s just me. Some people like to listen to their favorite tunes, other’s want to listen to the music that inspires them the most or inspired them to draw whatever their drawing in the first place, some like it quieter, other‘s like it louder. I like a bit of them all (I like it louder when I‘m drawing, and quieter or silent when I paint and/or ink), and I also have some instrumental tunes as well. So it really is whatever works for you. Try and see.|`|fe2f81588ecd4cf84508234a973e6b23aa	If you're not the classical type, don't force yourself. <br>  However, you probably don't want to play songs you sing along to on a regular basis. Get some fresh music. Instrumental music tends to work the best, but it's not limited to classical. Personally, I listen to guitar solos. They get me pumped and I produce the best art that way. Quiet works too, but whatever floats your boat.|`|AA12063701	classical music.|`|eLOGuUTkaa	music you don't know the words too. a shuffle on music you haven't listen too much but enjoy is the best bet. it is what i do when i work in my black book|`|oD84tRxBaa	any of your favorite songs..<br>  but Metallica is amazing..<br>  and so is OZZY!!!!!!<br>  so those are a great inspiration for me when im drawing.

dQmFoRRiaa	Should still be in iambic pentameter, so ten.|`|nE5eqyWeaa	Meter is not made up of syllables but beats per line. <br>  <br>  Quick Lesson in Basic Scansion:<br>  <br>  Basic meter is based on the fact that all syllables in English are either stressed (at one of several different levels) or unstressed. In ordinary speech, we pay no attention to the patterns of stressed and unstressed syllables, so that no pattern emerges--the "pattern" is random. In metrical poetry, however, the poet takes syllables and arranges them so that the stresses that fall normally will occur in set patterns, as defined by the various feet (iamb, trochee, etc.).<br>  <br>  The basic meter in English is iambic pentameter, i. e., a line containing 5 iambs. <br>  "To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."<br>  "To STRIVE, to SEEK, to FIND, and NOT to YIELD."<br>  / iamb/ iamb/ iamb/ iamb/ iamb/<br>  <br>  "When I do count the clock that tells the time"<br>  / when I/ do COUNT/ the CLOCK/ that TELLS/ the TIME/<br>  / iamb/ iamb/ iamb/ iamb/ iamb/<br>  <br>  "When I have fears that I may cease to be<br>  Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain"<br>  / when I/ have FEARS/ that I/ may CEASE/ to BE/<br>  / be FORE/ my PEN/ has GLEANED/ my TEEM/ ing BRAIN/<br>  / iamb/ iamb/ iamb/ iamb/ iamb/<br>  / iamb/ iamb/ iamb/ iamb/ iamb/<br>  <br>  Certain substitutions are allowed which are not considered to disrupt the basic meter (iambic pentameter in this case), specifically the trochee and the spondee: <br>  <br>  "Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn"<br>  / THUS is/ his CHEEK/ the MAP/ of DAYS/ out WORN/<br>  / trochee/ iamb/ iamb/ iamb/ iamb/<br>  <br>  The first-foot trochee is the most common of all substitutions in iambic verse, although the trochee can be substituted in any foot (except possibly the last foot of a line).<br>  <br>  "Keen, fitful gusts are whisp'ring here and there"<br>  / KEEN FIT/ ful GUSTS/ are WHIS/ pring HERE/ and THERE/<br>  / spondee/ iamb/ iamb/ iamb/ iamb/<br>  The spondee can also be substituted anywhere within a line, including--unlike the trochee- the last foot.<br>  <br>  The important thing is that, as a general rule of thumb, there should always be more iambs in the line than substituted feet; otherwise, the iambic rhythm will be lost.<br>  <br>  There is, in addition, one further substitution which may occur, the combination of a pyrrhic foot followed by a spondaic foot; this combination is called the "double iamb" and is counted the same as two regular iambs in a line:<br>  <br>  "I summon up remembrance of things pasts"<br>  / i SUM/ mon UP/ re MEM/ brance of/ THINGS PAST/<br>  / iamb/ iamb/ iamb{/ pyrrhic/ spondee/ = double iamb}<br>  <br>  "When all the birds are faint with the hot sun"<br>  / when ALL/ the BIRDS/ are FAINT/ with the/ HOT SUN/<br>  / iamb/ iamb/ iamb {/ pyrrhic/ spondee/ = double iamb}<br>  <br>  "When to the sessions of sweet, silent thought"<br>  / WHEN to / the SES/ sions of /SWEET SI/ lent THOUGHT/<br>  / trochee/ iamb {/ pyrrhic/ spondee/} iamb/<br>  Since the "pyrrhic"/"spondee" is counted as two regular iambs, there are still 4 iambic feet in this line, despite the trochaic substitution.

But Georgie needed to work out her life, and Furze Pen seemed as good as place as any - until the terrors started. There was the lone watcher on the hill - at first she thought it was a scarecrow, so stark and still was it standing - and then the unexplained fire, with the remains of a child's doll smouldeing in the ashes.

swlqQ1mYaa	The civilian government was essentially powerless.<br>  <br>  At this time, the major loophole in the Meiji Constitution of 1889 was the right of certain officials to have direct access to the emperor. Until World War II, the emperor retained major powers that have since been passed to the Diet. Officials included the prime minster, the Resident-General (later Governor-General) of Korea, and the heads of the army and navy. And although the emperor technically had power, the way it worked was that they would basically tell him to sign whatever decree or document they wanted authorization for. Put bluntly.<br>  <br>  The Diet itself only had veto power - not that it was very useful. In the case of most Houses, their main power comes from vetoing the budget, leaving the rest of the government unable to function. However, in that case the Japanese government simply renewed the previous year's allowances, thereby rendering the Diet practically useless. Also, officials holding power dictated their successors by refusing to support movements, etc., until the candidate they favored was chosen.|`|D19F6m92aa	It was the tail wagging the dog.  The heads of the Army and Navy were automatically part of the cabinet, and they had the power to bring down any civilian government they found uncooperative.

7f7aa0ea5dc924471fffd54e742f67ddaa	Before I help you come up with reasons and examples, let's look a little deeper into the history of the Soviet Union. It is not as simple as those who paint black and white pictures would have you believe. For example, take the false statement, "they took advantage of World War II to take over sovereign countries and create protectorates which conformed a sphere of influence." <br>  <br>  Now, think, which of the other Allies (France, Britain, the U. S. A.) also did that? That is right, they ALL did! If you cannot look at the subject you are learning objectively, all others will have you learn is the same old Cold War propaganda. What is needed here is to not assume that anything about the Cold War is a fact, and question everything.<br>  <br>  Stalin knew what the Allies did, and would do, and his taking advantage of the war to take over sovereign countries was a wise move made before the Allies could make such a move. You do need to look at this issue from both sides. From the side of the Soviet Union, they had been on the defensive for almost 30 years. Once in the position to take the offensive-dfensive, they did what was necessary.|`|HxXduL1maa	The Cold War began after World War Two. The main enemies were the United States and the Soviet Union. The Cold war got its name because both sides were afraid of fighting each other directly. In such a "hot war," nuclear weapons might destroy everything. So, instead, they fought each other indirectly. They played havoc with conflicts in different parts of the world. They also used words as weapons. They threatened and denounced each other. Or they tried to make each other look foolish. <br>  <br>  Over the years, leaders on both sides changed. Yet the Cold War continued. It was the major force in world politics for most of the second half of the twentieth century. Historians disagree about how long the Cold War lasted. A few believe it ended when the United States and the Soviet Union improved relations during the nineteen-sixties and early nineteen-seventies. Others believe it ended when the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989, or when the Soviet Union collapsed in late 1991. <br>  <br>  The United States and the Soviet Union were the only two superpowers following the Second World War. The fact that, by the 1950s, each possessed nuclear weapons and the means of delivering such weapons on their enemies, added a dangerous aspect to the Cold War. The Cold War world was separated into three groups. The United States led the West. This group included countries with democratic political systems. The Soviet Union led the East. This group included countries with communist political systems. The non-aligned group included countries that did not want to be tied to either the West or the East. <br>  <br>  From the Western perspective, during the Second World War, the Soviet Union was an ally of the Western democracies, in their struggle against the Axis Powers of Germany, Japan and Italy. From the Soviet perspective, the Western democracies had provided material assitance to the Soviets during the Great Patriotic War, their struggle to expell the forces of Hitlerite Fascism which had invaded the Soviet Union. <br>  <br>  As the War neared its conclusion, the future of Eastern Europe became a point of contention between the Soviet Union and its Western allies. The Soviet Union had been invaded via Eastern Europe in both the First and Second World Wars. In both conflicts, some of the nations of Eastern Europe had participated in those invasions. Both Wars had devastated the Soviet Union. An estimated twenty-five million Russians were killed during the Second World War. The Soviet Union was determined to install "friendly" regimes throughout Eastern Europe following the War. The strategic goal was to protect its European borders from future invasions. Since the Soviet Union was a communist state, the Soviet government preferred to install communist regimes throughout Eastern Europe. The Red Army was liberating the nations of Eastern Europe and therefore, the Soviet Union was in a position to influence the type of governments that would emerge following the War. <br>  <br>  The Soviets believed that they had an agreement with the western democracies that made Eastern Europe a Soviet sphere of influence, i.e. the Soviet Union would have dominant influence in that region. In 1945 Joseph Stalin pronounced that any freely elected governments in Poland, Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European states would be anti-Soviet and he refused to allow this. In March 1946 Winston Churchill referred to an iron curtain descending across the continent. The cold war began because of this struggle for control of the politics of these nations. By 1948, pro-Soviet regimes were in power in Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Czechoslovakia. <br>  <br>  The Western democracies, led by the United States, were determined to stop the spread of communism and Soviet power. While not being able to stop the Soviets in Eastern Europe, the U.S. and Britain were determined to prevent communist regimes from achieving power in Western Europe. During the Second World War, communists parties throughout Western Europe, had gained popularity in their resistance to Nazi occupation. There was a real possibility the communist parties would be elected in both France and Italy. <br>  <br>  The United States also led the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949. NATO was a joint military group. Its purpose was to defend against Soviet forces in Europe [or, as the saying went, "to keep Russia out, America in and Germany down"]. The first members of NATO were Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the United States. The Soviet Union and its east European allies formed their own joint military group -- the Warsaw Pact -- six years later.|`|e53470e0994050b004790b633a444bd4aa	Because they took advantage of World War II to take over sovereign countries (the Baltics) and create protectorates which conformed a sphere of influence.<br>  <br>  After WWII they took over the Eastern part of Germany and they would not allow elections there to unite it with the rest of the country. They also allowed their forces to run wild in Poland and Hungary.<br>  <br>  They took over Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and sponsored pro-communist coups in Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.<br>  <br>  They split Korea and gave the North to the Kim family as their personal fiefdom instead of allowing elections to unite the country.<br>  <br>  They supported revolutions in Cuba, where Castro, the biggest sellout in all Latin American history, welcomed them with open arms.

vgPH9Engaa	It could be argued that there are two types of fiction books: popular, and literary.  I am disregarding long-winded non-fiction theses, poetry, and memoir...pretty much everything but novels...for the fact that these other genres are more likely to be written for the inherit value to the writer.  Novels, however, can really be classed under those two broad categories: popular or literary.<br>  <br>  The people that think they can write a book and therefore should write a book very regularly have narrowed themselves to popular fiction too often seen on bestseller lists.  These are the ones that clamor over James Patterson, Dan Brown, Stephanie Meyer, John Saul...you know the names.  It's about money to them, and they get it through a formulaic storyline.  When I tell people I'm working on a novel, they ask if I'll be rich like Stephen King (a noted exception to the bestseller-is-only-popular-fiction list).  My response is always, "In the event it gets published, probably not.  I just want to get into a Master's program and teach English."  But the popular fiction myth suggests that writing a book equals striking it rich and finding fame.<br>  <br>  The writers who write literary fiction, such as Toni Morrison and most college English professors, and you, write for the sake of writing and mastering the language.  The money and fame means nothing.<br>  <br>  I disagree that vanity presses cheapen the art.  By saying so, you're comparing two different styles.  Vanity presses pander to the non-literary dreamers writing stuff worse than your elementary school project (perhaps a handful of those 'authors' will strike it rich selling a vanity press publication to stores...most will just lose money--and since their goal was to make it rich, technically they completely failed, so rejoice in that knowledge), and even many large publishing houses are built for business and commercial products.  Not art.  It's like a gallery of Anne Geddes next to a gallery of Ansel Adams.  Not comparable.  One is made for money.  One is made for art.  Time will--and often has--shown that art outlasts commercialism.  And even still, commercialism weeds out the crap.  Remember Nicole Richie's novel?  No?  I bet she doesn't either.  It was that bad.<br>  <br>  You say that you will continue to write and accept that you might never get published (you're talking about legitimate publications, of course, not vanity crap).  So what's the problem?  You're happy writing something intelligent.  They're happy writing something terrible.  Don't worry about the rest of those people.  They'll 'publish' their book through a vanity, get 100 copies, and that's that.  The popular crowds and vanity press crap will be forgotten next year, replaced by new crap.  Go to a bookstore...a decent sized one (even a commercial one like Barnes and Noble or Borders).  Look at the Heather Graham section.  She constantly puts out new books in popular fiction (usually romance or romance/suspense or mystery).  But you can rarely find more than a handful (mostly recent publications) amongst her dozens of titles.  Voyage over to the centuries old Shakespeare, and you get more choices than an all you can eat buffet.  Time will save the art.  You can already see the satiation of commercialism in movies.  People are getting upset that all Hollywood is doing is doling out re-makes of previous shows and movies.  The same can be said of names on the bestseller list.  With any luck it will spawn new critics who will push the popular works into talented ones.  Until then, just remember that the writing quality is only as good as the critics reviewing it...so don't hold back on your literary fiction and those of your peers.  And don't ever fear that Jewel or Billy Corgan or iluvCullen14 will outshine Maya Angelou.|`|3iGoYk0Saa	Not everyone thinks they can write a book. Some people just post a small piece of their stories online because they want advice on how to improve with their writing. Others just enjoy writing and there is nothing wrong with that. Is it really that bad that some people have dreams to write a book? I'm sure you have dreams and wants that you want to be accomplished or already have been accomplished. To tell you the truth, I know quite a few people who have lots of training, time, and talent to write a book. Everyone has something they want to achieve in life.

This includes education if they have the means for it, yeah, and doing actual research or something. Even SMeyer could have been a decent author had she been willing to listen to criticism, and had received good crit and followed it. Now that she's a major success she doesn't have the motivation to do it, so I suppose it'd never happen.<br>  <br>  I agree with you, but there's not much to say that you haven't already. Everyone has to be polite and everything, so we're not supposed to tell people to their faces that they suck, so instead they think they're good. And if not, they'll ignore it because the honest ones are just plain meanies. It's pretty easy to do (or at least, easy to do something that might resemble writing), so people do it without care or effort.<br>  <br>  Everyone does have the right to write and even post/publish it wherever they are able, I won't deny that. Doesn't mean they're good at it, and that I wouldn't prefer it if they didn't - it would be easier to find some decent stuff that way.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	...the same reason why people audition for american idol when they can't sing|`|Lc5FtItDaa	It's one of those things you have to try to know if you can do it.<br>  <br>  So a lot of people try.|`|ThdFMIFUaa	I think a goal should be to write a book before you die, not publish it.<br>  <br>  ANYONE can write a book. Not everyone can get it published. Few people can write a good book. And very, very few people can write a book that is memorable and means something.<br>  <br>  I don't think the people that come on B&A are self centered. I don't think that they expect their book to be perfect or even good at all. If they thought that, why would they be asking other people's opinions? Especially random strangers.<br>  <br>  I think you are a little self centered to tell you the truth. You are coming on here insulting several people. While many good writers are have a degree in English, others have natural talent and were never trained to become a writer.<br>  <br>  I think you need to get off your high horse and realize that not everyone is like you.

Even fewer than that win Grammys and Pulitzer prizes.|`|AA11111233	I hear you.  I think anyone can make time for writing, but it takes talent and discipline to write, as you said, a solid and publishable novel.  Not everyone has the talent to do so, and contrary to what you believe, not everyone is aspiring to be a writer.  If they do want to publish a book, it'll probably be a book of memoirs, or other nonfiction.<br>  <br>  If you're referring to the 12-16 year old wannabe writers on here, I think they're just trying to dip their toes into it, to see if this is really for them.  They are young after all, looking for peers or perhaps experts on here to critique their work.  Or it could be that they're desperately trying to avoid a career requiring Math, and showing off their lackluster skills is the way to do it... LOL!<br>  <br>  But yes, not everyone can be the next John Steinbeck or Margaret Mitchell or Charles Dickens.  I would suggest that if this is what you really want to do, get yourself an education - that means finding a school with a good English Literature program, read widely and well, and take time out to polish and smooth your writing after a rough draft.|`|SOPRt0Ffaa	First, I don't believe everyone thinks they can write, but more people are writing books these days because it is so much easier to do than in the past. Believe me, having word processing software alleviates the burden of formatting that once made writing so onerous. Internet access makes all the research a breeze and reduces the cost of traveling to special libraries and locations. <br>  <br>  Also, the publishing business has become so difficult to break into that authors are going the route of self-publishing and e-publishing. Some of the bestselling books of the past few years have been published via alternative means, and promoted by word of mouth. <br>  <br>  I agree that there are a lot of bad books out there; celebrities attract readership even though they have no writing talent.|`|8DwxwhStaa	Let people do whatever they want, it's a business, arts got nothing to do with it, so if someone writes a product someone else wants (bad or good) to consume then kudos.|`|ZSXT5hPDaa	I really think this shows how self centered this generation (or humans in general, I don't know) has become.

Look at SMeyer though, she can't write for her life and look how popular her trash is.|`|W8F9PboZaa	Are you referring to the people here, who all post their story idea's or first chapters. Because most of them are nothing but kids. How are good writers meant to develop if they're not given practice or constructive criticism. I have no problem with the people who ask questions here, although every time I see another one about a vampire I can't help but roll my eyes. And the ones that don't even have half way decent grammar. Jesus<br>  <br>  I think everyone has the right to write. Whether they're good enough to be published is another thing. But if they are published, and are below par, then it's not really the writers fault, it's the publishers. And many authors write dozens of books before they write one that is truly memorable. It's the experience of publishing all of those books that allows them to do so. And honestly, why does it bother you that they're getting published. You don't have to read it. If it's written badly chances are it's not going to sell. Obviously there are exceptions to that, just look at Twilight. I think it's great that you're so centered and know exactly what you're aiming for. But there are successful authors who have no training. Look at Christopher Paolini. I'm not the greatest fan of his books but i thought they were alright. He was like 16 when he wrote that. One of my favourite series is Obernewtyn, which the author started when she was 15. She didn't complete the first book until after she had a degree in english but her idea's were developing way before she had any formal training.<br>  <br>  But basically everyone CAN write a book. If people start making people believe that they're not good enough then the number of good writers in the future is going to be severely diminished. And not everyone does believe they could write a book. I certainly couldn't. I don't have the imagination and the originality.
fb468012b8cf897d2de025f26607747faa	Any of the independent identity developed by the colonies was already present. The American Colonies used ideas widely circulated throughout Britain to derive their own form of government, so it's hard to claim them as being unique. Like it or not, the majority of the colonies adhered, and still do, to Anglo ideas and concepts. In countries like India, there was already a very distinct culture that persisted through the colony-period. However, all of the "White Colonies" stray little from British influence.|`|IwqTI7Rfaa	The colonies copied some food staples and cooking styles from the native Americans. Is this what you mean?

fb468012b8cf897d2de025f26607747faa	I think that at that time what the people thought really didn't matter. One of the more immediate effects was the seizure of Church property by the English Monarchy. Of course, Henry married Anne Boleyn shortly afterward, as well. I think that because Henry was a widely respected king and that England was going through a golden age, people the majority of people tolerated this move. I also believe that there were widespread notions that the Catholic Church was becoming corrupt, so that might have played a part in the peoples' reactions as well. I think many people believed that the decadent wealth possessed by the Church ran contradictory to their professed vow of poverty, so in many peoples' minds, taking that wealth was nothing too heinous. Besides, separation from Rome was more symbolic than anything because Catholic traditions were still practiced after wards. The main reason for separation was to replenish the English treasury, and I think that not many people minded that. <br>  <br>  Contrary to the modern conception, Henry was a very popular king for most of his reign, and did much to strengthen England. He developed the English Navy into a very potent naval force. He spent lavishly on building projects. He was a very talented fellow in his youth, and I think that most of the notion that he was a lazy, incompetent, ruthless tyrant is derived from people who only look at the later stages of his reign.|`|tM2XvQV0aa	people were pissed. . . they looked down on him, and i think after that a lot of things for england started going down..but can't remember what|`|t45fRqbTaa	hmmm.....an encyclopedia may have teh best and mnost cite worthy informatioin for this question...|`|GOpDGnsXaa	They were upset but King Henry was a murderous man they did not give him to much shlt.|`|3906b0dc53b49757cda1fb524b5353d4aa	Same old same old really-no real difference for the man in the street, a lot of the nobles were able to cash in on the church lands now up for grabs and were glad to see some of their firecest competitors taken out of the game-monastaries were usually very well run agricultural businesses.|`|9EkFrApiaa	The Catholic Church was enflamed and it went underground in England.

Did you know that the French believed they were the first to create a heavier than air aircraft? After December 17, 1903 the Wright Brothers kept a fairly tight wrap on things until they could get their patent so a lot of folks didn't believe they had actually flown. Which lead to the French dismissing the Wrights' claim, that is until they did a demonstration in France proving they could fly hogher, stay in the air longer, and had more control over their plane than the Frenchman who was making what he believed were the first successful flights of a heavier than air aircraft. You have to remember that this was a while after 1903 (1908) and the Wrights had continued experimenting, creating better planes than the 1903 Flyer.|`|AA10303012	Surely people must have felt that mans flight was amazing, and while that was true, they also wondered what flight would be used for, what practical applications it would have in the real world.

The last Shah lost popular support, especially from Shia clerics, because of his pro-Western stance, secular policies, and recognition of Israel.|`|wl1wVZ4Haa	I guess it depend on whose perspective. In the years prior to 1979, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (called the Shah)  was becoming very unpopular. He had become leader in Iran when the British and American govt overthrew the very popular Prime Minister Mossadegh in the 1950's. Mossadegh was a democratically elected official. And he was loved and respected by his people. That did not stop the U.S. from sending him into exile. To me that is a very sad chapter in American history. We will probably never know what Iran would be like without that horrible incident. But he stood in the way of oil fields that the U.S. and UK thought were theirs. The Shah ran a very brutal dictatorship. And he was friendly to the U.S. for the most part. He put together, with the help of the CIA, a secret police agency named SAVAK. SAVAK imprisoned or killed anyone who voiced opposition to the Shah's dictatorship. The Shah eventually fled Iran, fearing for his life. When the Ayatollah returned from exile, he had big time support from the Iranian people. They had come to hate the Shah, and the West.|`|073ad2ba60d8cf71ef3514ad2f5a92eaaa	After is better!

NR3YnkVPaa	Notice in the first two lines, the ladder points towards HEAVEN. That is clue number one. Line 7 talks about "sleep" and he keeps talking about sleep, until the last two lines mention a "Long sleep" and then "human sleep".  This seems to suggest something about death, wouldn't you think? <br>  That is the surface level of the poem. There is also a suggestion that our waking life is closer to a dream in some ways. Lines 10-11 mention a sheet of ice from the "drinking trough" through which he looks at the world around him making it appear to be "strange". It is when we are "on our way to sleep" that we finally see the world as strange; or we finally see that the way we usually see the world is strange. And it may affect the sleep where he will perhaps dream, or be haunted by the image of the "good" apples going one place and the  "fallen" apples (which are "as of no worth") went to the cider-apple heap (similar to going to heaven or hell).

2r88WStkaa	I've been in a LOT of plays. I mean A LOT. The best trick for me is, reading one line or sentence one at a time, then i close my eyes, count to ten, and write down everything i remember from what I just read. It works really well for me. Another thing you could try is rehearsing with whoever is acting in that scene with you, place body movements with your lines to help memorize them. Study your lines every night, and make sure you know your character really well, because if by chance you do forget a line, you need to know the appropriate way to improve and still stay in character.|`|JJZOhFdfaa	Hey!<br>  Im an actress wana be and iv leart a few tricks in my experience.<br>  <br>  1. read threw it until u know the story by heart.<br>  2. Get other people to read threw it with you (mom, dad, friends)<br>  3. Cover the script and then read the other carecters lines and when its your turn for your lines try to say them out lowd with out looking at the script.<br>  4.write your lines down<br>  5. If possible change some of the lines to something U feel more naturule saying.<br>  <br>  Well good luck with your practicing!|`|3RTaxHq2aa	It helps if you absorb and understand the story. <br>  150 isn't really that bad compared to some parts. <br>  You will go through rehearsal and learn your cues.<br>  <br>  Read the script every night, or work on one part at a time. Practice scenes, maybe get together with some other cast members to practice. <br>  <br>  Break a Leg    and congrats!|`|ToQEyzXHaa	Write them on note cards(which will take a while), study them while you are listening to some music or watching a movie and every time you move on to a new line you should say the other ones that are before that. Get together with some other cast members and practice lines together<br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|NjYCvfYGaa	Read the whole script, understand the story, and believe it.<br>  Never read ONLY your lines, that's how you forget your parts or you get mixed up. Get a study buddy to go through lines with you because listening to the other person helps you respond better with your line.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

AA11402617	Go a little farther back and thank the man who founded the Piggly Wiggly supermarket chain.  He invented the self service supermarket. Before he came up with the idea, if you lived in a city, you went to market, stood in line, and then waited your turn for a legion of stock boys to run around climbing ladders and fetching up all the items on your list.  Small stores only had the store owner himself to do it all.  The guy we really ought to thank is the guy who came up with the shopping cart. <br>  <br>  My favorite all time best modern invention is the mute button, The inventor of which only recently passed away.  They announced his passing on the news that night.  You may not have heard about it because your TV was muted.  A fitting tribute anyway, I think.<br>  .<br>  .|`|CZEj3mYBaa	No, he wasn't.<br>  Thank you SO much person who invented the Express Lane at the grocery store.  You changed our shopping experiences forever.  Your invention will always be remembered as one of the most beneficial happenings ever known to man.  From now on, every Monday will be Person Who Invented the Express Lane Day.<br>  Yes, he was.|`|5eArOiRxaa	(((FallenAngel)))<br>  <br>  Nope. I wonder who invented it...|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	No, he was in a hurry and left before anyone knew that he was gone.|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	Yes I was.
lTwH0lZGaa	I once read a book about a girl that could change into an owl...<br>  <br>  Maybe you could have your a guy be turned into an owl(that's the fantasy, and owl part you want), and the main character girl could take me in, and later find out that he's not really an owl. She has to find a way to change him back, and when she does, they fall in love.|`|zvhZ0Dsoaa	hm, this is tough. <br>   Write a story set in a small town bordering a forest (owls.) something mysterious about the town, (fantasy) <br>  A girl who's seclusive and finds what's in the forest...<br>  A guy who likes her and follows ... (romance)<br>  <br>  I'm just throwing out ideas. The above is kind of cliche so do whatever you want. It's your story.<br>  <br>  But when you've written it you should join a writing site and post it.|`|ZCnlMUp2aa	why dont you write a book about a 18 year old girl in her last year of college and she wants to get out of there untell she meets this guy and falls inlove untell he has a secret (powers, vampire, inlove with someone else?)|`|hjijQSvLaa	Oh, you don't need anyone to give you an idea! You've already given yourself plenty to work with! It's a good start to developing your own ideas. Like this: since you like fantasy, romance, and owls, why don't you write a story about all three? Either a story about owls (might want to make it different than the Ga'hoole books) or about people with owls? There's plenty of things you can come up with. If you want a problem, basically start thinking of all the things that can go wrong in such a world -a problem that comes out of the civilization/way of life itself, or a foreign problem that comes from somewhere else, or an internal problem with the character. There's a million things that can go wrong, nasty situations characters can get into ;)<br>  <br>  (And writing a story includes the 'thinking of it' part, which is why everyone says you need to come up with your own ideas. It's hard at first, but it IS your story. Good luck!)|`|gTXUcd1maa	Hi :)<br>  <br>     Writing is what you choose it to be, and only you can create these fabulous ideas in your head. Writing is extremely rewarding!! Take instances from  your real life. It's always fun to write about things you've experienced. Good luck!!

A name like The Karrs would be good in my mind as a more evil type creature but I can kinda see where your goin with this so your probably looking for more of a nice name. Such as, Rabbitfaces (lol) , The Hairy Ones, Beards, or even steal the classic starwars hairy like creatures and call them Wookies. <br>  I'm just throwing things out there I hoped it helped a little :)|`|btIDOI04aa	The race of furry faces should be Hogola.

nXxaAH0baa	not that I can remember..it seems as though this poem is based upon a real life experience.A lot of thought was put into this one,I would have loved to hear those beautiful songs that this boy sang,perhaps someday I will.Good poem|`|XBV6DP84aa	Was the bird a tit by any chance?<br>  Just curious...<br>  <br>  :-D<br>  <br>  I KNEW that would be your response. <br>  Aha.<br>  <br>  (I actually liked your poem...but don't tell anyone)<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  What the devil are you going on about?<br>  <br>  Oh god, I PRAYED you didn't mean that. <br>  I think I threw up a bit in my mouth.|`|srNBx7sLaa	And in response to the above answer I would only ask...was the tit a 'bird' by any chance? Interesting piece, Peter. (And I've only just noticed your additional details...two great minds think alike, eh?)|`|htxwTAAQaa	Lines 35 and 36 were nice.  I wish I could say that about the rest.|`|snrdDbLAaa	The punning title is a supine, and hence slightly unpleasant, reconciliation of inspired memory with otherwise irrecollectable inspiration.  `The song lives in a different throat' distances the speaker from the vivid first half, much as the title distances the poet from himself.  The first half of the poem is sensual, but demure: even the poet's curls usurp the sun's gold, which wars in gentleness with the wind.  The abstraction of experience quite poignantly pierces the illusion of childhood reality; it reminds me of late Wordsworth, who qualifies, more than condescends to seek full redemption.  This poem is more apologetic than defiant, in its ending; I do not mind this, as `ancestral lays' are inherently retrograde.  However, the ending is not fully satisfying, as to say the experienced poet `sweetly trills' is an external and naive view of his art spliced into his own voice.  The song is undoubtedly no longer of `almost too much love;' then, how does the poem describe itself?  To say `sweetly' is mere wistfulness, which is not a precise answer, I feel, to the question of the poem.<br>  <br>  Questions of the ending aside, this is a lovely, vivid work of free verse, a form which I can only admire at a distance.|`|NpiAaCMyaa	Pretentious and painfully wistful.|`|dS3XHvaoaa	This is beautiful... Every child will to grow up... Though we can't help but to wonder if the 'child' had truly left...|`|bonsNFzLaa	... this poem is definitely worth more than a Buk.|`|4gTszwIZaa	I do believe a lyrical genius has provoked a generous shellacking! haha! For is insanity truly the opposite of sane, or is it merely a combined term that allows for another parallel? Let me cure your questioning thoughts on this. It seems we look at the life as beauty and distaste, anger and happiness. However, are these truly opposites? For are they not couplets in life's natural rhythm that allow for such fluid understanding? If only we knew what the true opposite of life was... aside from my rant, excellent work of art again. The humming of a soldier is eminent in life and death.|`|WbRuTjmFaa	This is very sweet in it's simplicity. Are little girls that much different than little boys in their reactions to life and the natural freedom and music that is there? <br>  And the boy sitll lives on in the man even as the girl lives on in the woman and though their songs may sound different they are still the same.<br>  <br>  An enjoyable read for me. <br>  ... and to answer the question ... yes,  I have.
HUDjXVOyaa	I definitely suggest something archival and acid free. <br>  An acrylic marker is a good choice. The ink is actually thin paint. It will dry like paint and won't bleed.    <br>  <br>  If you are familiar with Micheal's craft store, they carry a marker called, "Painters" - opaque Paint Marker. It is made by a company called Hunt Corporation, from Statesville. <br>  Many of my friend who are painters have used this marker to sign the back side of their paintings. I have found it to be reliable also. <br>  <br>  Here is link for reference if your interested...<br>  <a href="http://www.artstuff.net/images/painters.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.artstuff.net/images/painters....</a>|`|AA12063701	don't risk it, write on the wood part on the back.|`|kl1wImM1aa	hi, I suggest you use a kind of pen called "mark pen"to write on the back of  canvas. You also can choose different colour according to what you like.|`|u4KK07hnaa	as long as youre not using crappy canvas and youve already painted on it, you should be fine.

Ow3O7h4caa	Thats ok so far . it doesn't mean that you stop there. You can try to advance yourself jsut the same by trying to practice scales in a chromatic fashion and using alternate-picking.<br>  <br>  At least, when it comes the time to learn notes and single note picking, you will be one step ahead of your teacher.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|ZTZBItU0aa	yes. all songs are played using chords. Once you get familiar with the finger placement, when it comes natural, it'll be way easy to play songs you hear, and even improvise when necessary and still sound good

AA10015648	He obviously thinks that past actions aren't an indicator of future actions and that people who have been convicted of murder should be given the highest benefit of the doubt.<br>  <br>  My point of view is... some people will never be free for the rest of their life because the crimes they committed involved killing multiple children, or killing people for absolutely no reason. They will never be safe to roam free because they're mentally, criminally and unfixably dangerous. Why keep a man like that alive? It'd be irresponsible to let him free with "mercy" because he is a sociopath who enjoys killing. <br>  <br>  True story... a man cuts of the head of a 23 year old stranger in a bus in Canada, without any cause or any remorse. CUTS OFF HIS HEAD! Let that man free? No. Let him live the rest of his life in prison so that he can live a small, meaningless life? WHY? It's senseless to keep him alive when a jury has determined he will never again walk free. Multiple people SAW him do it, it's not like anyone could second guess it or that he could be innocent.

The book, which went on sale at midnight, has spawned bookstore parties and vampire and werewolf costume-wearing fans, the likes of which haven't been seen since Harry Potter mania. Meyer told "Good Morning America" on July 31 that "I don't know if I'm completely finished with the characters." This could be great news for old and new fans alike. Since the release of "Twilight" in 2005, the books in the series have spent a combined 143 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. With inter-human-vampire-werewolf relations, this series has something for everyone, including a wedding in "Breaking Dawn." Get a taste of Meyer's most recent work, below.<br>  <br>  Preface<br>  <br>  I'd had more than my fair share of near-death experiences; it wasn't something you ever really got used to.<br>  <br>  It seemed oddly inevitable, though, facing death again. Like I really was marked for disaster. I'd escaped time and time again, but it kept coming back for me. Still, this time was so different from the others. You could run from someone you feared, you could try to fight someone you hated. All my reactions were geared toward those kinds of killers—the monsters, the enemies. When you loved the one who was killing you, it left you no options. How could you run, how could you fight, when doing so would hurt that beloved one? If your life was all you had to give your beloved, how could you not give it? If it was someone you truly loved?<br>  <br>  1. Engaged<br>  <br>  <br>  No one is staring at you, I promised myself. No one is staring at you. No one is staring at you. But, because I couldn't lie convincingly even to myself, I had to check. As I sat waiting for one of the three traffic lights in town to turn green, I peeked to the right—in her minivan, Mrs. Weber had turned her whole torso in my direction. Her eyes bored into mine, and I flinched back, wondering why she didn't drop her gaze or look ashamed. It was still considered rude to stare at people, wasn't it? Didn't that apply to me anymore? Then I remembered that these windows were so darkly tinted that she probably had no idea if it was even me in here, let alone that I'd caught her looking. I tried to take some comfort in the fact that she wasn't really staring at me, just the car. My car. Sigh. I glanced to the left and groaned. Two pedestrians were frozen on the sidewalk, missing their chance to cross as they stared. Behind them, Mr. Marshall was gawking through the plate glass window of his little souvenir shop. At least he didn't have his nose pressed up against the glass. Yet.<br>  <br>  The light turned green and, in my hurry to escape, I stomped on the gas pedal without thinking—the normal way I would have punched it to get my ancient Chevy truck moving. Engine snarling like a hunting panther, the car jolted forward so fast that my body slammed into the black leather seat and my stomach flattened against my spine. "Arg!" I gasped as I fumbled for the brake. Keeping my head, I merely tapped the pedal. The car lurched to an absolute standstill anyway. I couldn't bear to look around at the reaction. If there had been any doubt as to who was driving this car before, it was gone now. With the toe of my shoe, I gently nudged the gas pedal down one half millimeter, and the car shot forward again.<br>  <br>  I managed to reach my goal, the gas station. If I hadn't been running on vapors, I wouldn't have come into town at all. I was going without a lot of things these days, like Pop-Tarts and shoelaces, to avoid spending time in public.<br>  <br>  Moving as if I were in a race, I got the hatch open, the cap off, the card scanned, and the nozzle in the tank within seconds. Of course, there was nothing I could do to make the numbers on the gauge pick up the pace. They ticked by sluggishly, almost as if they were doing it just to annoy me.<br>  <br>  It wasn't bright out—a typical drizzly day in Forks, Washington—but I still felt like a spotlight was trained on me, drawing attention to the delicate ring on my left hand. At times like this, sensing the eyes on my back, it felt as if the ring were pulsing like a neon sign: Look at me, look at me.<br>  <br>  It was stupid to be so self-conscious, and I knew that. Besides my dad and mom, did it really matter what people were saying about my engagement? About my new car? About my mysterious acceptance into an Ivy League college? About the shiny black credit card that felt red-hot in my back pocket right now? "Yeah, who cares what they think," I muttered under my breath. "Um, miss?" a man's voice called.<br>  <br>  I turned, and then wished I hadn't. Two men stood beside a fancy SUV with brand-new kayaks tied to the top. Neither of them was looking at me; they both were staring at the car.<br>  <br>  Personally, I didn't get it. But then, I was just proud I could distinguish between the symbols for Toyota, Ford, and Chevy. This car was glossy black, sleek, and pretty, but it was still just a car to me.<br>  <br>  "I'm sorry to bother you, but could you tell me what kind of car you're driving?" the tall one asked.<br>  <br>  "Um, a Mercedes, right?"<br>  <br>  "Yes," the man said politely while his shorter friend rolled his eyes at my answer. "I know. But I was wondering, is that…are you driving a Mercedes Guardian?" The man said the name with reverence. I had a feeling this guy would get along well with Edward, my…my fiancé (there really was no getting around that truth with the wedding just days away). "They aren't supposed to be available in Europe yet," the man went on, "let alone here."<br>  <br>  While his eyes traced the contours of my car—it didn't look much different from any other Mercedes sedan to me, but what did I know?—I briefly contemplated my issues with words like fiancé, wedding, husband, etc.<br>  <br>  I just couldn't put it together in my head.<br>  <br>  On the one hand, I had been raised to cringe at the very thought of poofy white dresses and bouquets. But more than that, I just couldn't reconcile a staid, respectable, dull concept like husband with my concept of Edward. It was like casting an archangel as an accountant; I couldn't visualize him in any commonplace role. Like always, as soon as I started thinking about Edward I was caught up in a dizzy spin of fantasies. The stranger had to clear his throat to get my attention; he was still waiting for an answer about the car's make and model.<br>  <br>  "I don't know," I told him honestly.<br>  <br>  "Do you mind if I take a picture with it?"<br>  <br>  It took me a second to process that. "Really? You want to take a picture with the car?"<br>  <br>  "Sure—nobody is going to believe me if I don't get proof."<br>  <br>  "Um. Okay. Fine."<br>  <br>  I swiftly put away the nozzle and crept into the front seat to hide while the enthusiast dug a huge professional-looking camera out of his backpack. He and his friend took turns posing by the hood, and then they went to take pictures at the back end. "I miss my truck," I whimpered to myself.<br>  <br>  Very, very convenient—too convenient—that my truck would wheeze its last wheeze just weeks after Edward and I had agreed to our lopsided compromise, one detail of which was that he be allowed to replace my truck when it passed on. Edward swore it was only to be expected; my truck had lived a long, full life and then expired of natural causes. According to him. And, of course, I had no way to verify his story or to try to raise my truck from the dead on my own. My favorite mechanic—<br>  <br>  I stopped that thought cold, refusing to let it come to a conclusion. Instead, I listened to the men's voices outside, muted by the car walls.<br>  <br>  "…went at it with a flame thrower in the online video. Didn't even pucker the paint."<br>  <br>  "Of course not. You could roll a tank over this baby. Not much of a market for one over here. Designed for Middle East diplomats, arms dealers, and drug lords mostly."<br>  <br>  "Think she's something?" the short one asked in a softer voice. I ducked my head, cheeks flaming.<br>  <br>  <br>  Follow the link to read more it's going to be more in the bottom after the book review.|`|or0SzIoLaa	Try<br>  www.stephaniemeyer.com|`|MxJhDrmXaa	dont!<br>  go buy the freakin book<br>  if you like stephenie meyer<br>  then you should buy it|`|y6uKv9GOaa	go read the whole book,hon.<br>  <br>  since buying the book really waste your time,energy,space and money (i regret buying the first two books),i won't give you any sermon bout the copyright.<br>  <br>  www.scribd.com|`|z2Aj71joaa	Why not just go read the book.

usvPMtMtaa	Edward Cullen has no protein, because his body doesn’t need it. Protein is a component of DNA, which is also found in sperm. Edward has no sperm, so how the **** did he conceive Renessme? Sperm are living cells that need to be reproduced, and if you’ve been dead for a hundred years, I do believe that your sperm would be long dead. It is also physically impossible for a baby to be produced in a few short months. Bella’s body should have rejected the fetus.<br>  <br>  Imprinting is when you find your best genetic match, right? So Jacob’s best genetic match is a mortal-vampire hybrid. Now that is droll. Oh and 23 chromosomes and 24 chromosomes does not produce a viable kid. Nessie should have down syndrome or should be dead. GAH!!<br>  <br>  Another fault – Alice saw the Volturi invasion right, even though werewolves were involved? What happened to her not being able to see things when wolves were there?<br>  <br>  Oh and why the **** does Jasper go to school when he can’t be around people? I mean, they could have hid him well enough. They don’t even have to go to school!!!<br>  <br>  Also, Edward’s really scared about getting venom in Bella’s mouth when he kisses her. And if she didn’t get preggers off his sperm, she got pregnant off his venom??? WHAT? I think her moot would have been deformed, if getting venom in her mouth would have transformed her into a<br>  vampire.<br>  <br>  And my favourite one - Carlisle was hiding in the London sewers in the 1700’s … London didn’t have sewers in the 1700’s lol.<br>  <br>  Apart from the ridiculous amount of plot holes, Twilight has a poor structure and a storyline with no trail. The novel is basically made up of – “I love you Edward”<br>  “I love you, but I’m dangerous”<br>  “I still love you”<br>  “I’m still dangerous”<br>  The most amusing thing I found about Twilight however is that Edward sparkles… HAHAHAHA<br>  I’ve never heard anything more illogical and uninspiring in my entire life … And how Bella finds it “mesmerizing?” Hahahaha<br>  <br>  The novel consists of Edward and Bella propagating their love for each other for 2000 pages and 4 books and that’s it. Oh and throw in a potential war, a baseball game and him leaving her for a few months. He should have just left forever – dumb *****.<br>  <br>  I also find it really entertaining that people describe Edward Cullen as “the epitome of perfection,” when he is anything but. Edward Cullen is depicted as impossibly beautiful and can somewhat be compared to the god Adonis. His skin is "like marble"—very pale, ice cold, and sparkles in the sunlight. He has perfect facial features and impossibly captivating eyes. I can pretty much hear the words “fag, fag, fag, Gary-Stu”, being screamed at me as I write those words.<br>  <br>  But Edward Cullen is a stalking, pedophiliac, abusive son-of-a-*****. What kind of boyfriend disables his girlfriend’s car so she can’t visit her best friend, who’s having a hard time? What kind of boyfriend beats up his girlfriend while they have sex? What kind of boyfriend blames himself when his girlfriend falls over? WHAT KIND OF BOYFRIEND WATCHES HIS GIRLFRIEND SLEEP? AND HE WASN’T EVEN HER BOYFRIEND WHEN HE DID IT!!!<br>  <br>  Also, what kind of sick **** gives his wife a cesarean with his teeth? The answer is apparently a guy who fills the hormonal fantasies of millions of preteen/teenage girls and possibly gender confused boys.<br>  <br>  The one thing that really shits me about Twilight though, is the fan base. If you saw a kid with down syndrome and saw a Twitard, you’d think the Twitard was more retarded. Unless you ARE a Twitard. Then I hope you take offense.<br>  <br>  Here are some typical examples of Twitards:<br>  <br>  *<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkR6GTMBRRSVEgJwCISOQ_AjzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20081230233837AAmIu7o">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  *<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AskKC6Zdi3o5sAbgDYvTH58jzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20080515222144AAjokU9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  *<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmjPGihZzdjEWY.2ecfDDcrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090131204056AAEf3GG">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  *<a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&friendID=88908631" rel="nofollow">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus...</a><br>  <br>  ^^ HAHAHAHA<br>  <br>  I thought the books were terrible, but the film made the books look like literature. The acting was appalling, dialogue was **** and settings and characterization was vomit-worthy. Just a lame film. And when I had to sit through it listening to the hoard of screaming bitches squeal with orgasmic pleasure when Edward Cullen entered stage right, I wanted to scream with rage. Wait, I do recall screaming out “Eat a dick” to them. Numerous times. What a waste of $10.<br>  <br>  Twilight is ****. There’s no other word for it. Derivative, lackluster, cliché, Anne Rice rip off, blunt. You name it!! It’s like Anne Rice and Christopher Paolini had a love child with down syndrome and gave it to Ann Coulter to raise.|`|JnSrN3guaa	i like it even with the flaws.<br>  it lets me know that stephenie meyer is a human being with common human mistakes.<br>  <br>  i noticed the flaws the first time around, but i guess i didn't let it bother me. =]]<br>  <br>  i mean, gosh, vampires who sparkle? i think that's pretty creative and original, and she's her own self, not trying to copy all the other dreary vampire books out there. and pregnant? gosh, yes, that's something different and imaginative.<br>  <br>  the characters might not have "depth" but they're unique in their own way! :D|`|r5h7TmWJaa	Oh, same here! It's magical the first time, then the second time, like.. I just put it down and gagged. I think the flaws are that there are so many great characters set up, but they only focus on how hot Edward is. Bella says she only likes him for who she is, but it's always "his topaz eyes..." "his honey eyes..." "the shirt fit his muscled body so nicely..." etc. You never found out how a bear killed Emmett or anything like that, because it was so focused on how sexy Edward was. That was the biggest one.|`|IMHwA20jaa	The "Vampires". Really, no vampire sparkles,they MELT and PERISH and DIE! They're not all beautiful and perfect. Bella doesn't love Edward, she's blinded by his figure and perfect face and crooked smile and all the other repetitive description words she uses. Another thing, it's tell 13 year old girls that it's okay to have SEX with a perfect vampire who wants to suck your blood.<br>  <br>  I would go on,but really, I'm trying to stay calm tonight.|`|RrtUV5wcaa	i don't hate twilight, but i did notice a lot of flaws as well after i re read it a few times. like that she writes like she swallowed a thesaurus, i mean, in breaking dawn she uses like every freakin synonym there is for the word "said". and also, some of her sentences are really basic, and she could do a better job describing things and people. for example, with the vampires, pretty much the only details we get is that they're perfect, flawless, beautiful, and sparkle.|`|C2FkuVESaa	Because they're badly written.<br>  Because the characters are flat.<br>  Because Meyer doesn't know what a Mary Sue is.<br>  Because Meyer doesn't know what half the words she uses means.<br>  Because Edward is creepy and a jerk.<br>  Because Bella is stupid, and a self-insert.<br>  Because the sentences are all repetitive and say the same thing over and over.<br>  Because it encourages tweenyboppers to give up their lives and dreams for the sake of TWOO WUV (hormone driven lust between two apparently desperate virgins).<br>  Because she took four books to write what could have fit in one.<br>  Because she has no clue what a good story is.<br>  Because the style of writing used in this list is how Meyer actually writes.<br>  Because she doesn't know how to use adjectives not ending in -ly.<br>  Because the plot is cliched, predictable and weak.<br>  Because the subplot is cliched, predictable, rushed, and weak.<br>  Because her abuse of thesauruses, adverbs, and biology is just inhumane.<br>  Because she can't spell or use common grammar.<br>  Because she rapes the essence of vampires and werewolves to satisfy her wet dreams.<br>  Because it isn't love if you don't have to oil the window hinges.<br>  Because she proves that ANY idiot can get a B.A. in English at B.Young U.<br>  Because Meyer is an obsessive attention whore, with the maturity of a nine month old.<br>  Because it strikes heavily of Mormon propaganda.<br>  Because apparently Meyer knows jack about how the body/repro system/basic functions of life work.<br>  Because she uses huge fonts and wide spacing in her books to make them seem longer and more intelligent.<br>  Because she equates a long book with a good one.<br>  Because crap with glitter on it is still crap.<br>  Because there are plot holes bigger than a soccer pitch.<br>  Because it mistakes lust for love, and abuse for affection.<br>  Because it has a racist view of Native Americans, and is very prejudiced in general.<br>  Because imprinting sounds a heckuva lot like pedophilia to me.<br>  Because  the only purpose in Bella's life is having a boyfriend.<br>  Because Meyer has reduced the collective teenage IQ faster than the producers of vapid teen-TV could ever dream.<br>  <br>  <br>  ...need I go on?|`|R02aazVdaa	1) Because the writing is cliche and..BAD.<br>  <br>  2) The characters are two-dimensional.<br>  <br>  3) Because Meyer steals out of a thesaurus. <br>  <br>  4) Because Edward is creepy...<br>  <br>  5) Because of the fangirls who think they are ready to move on to the classics after they’ve read the stinkin book, just because there’s words like ‘ostentatious’ in it. <br>  <br>  6) Because Bella is stupid, and a self-insert.<br>  <br>  7) Because the sentences are all repetitive and say the same thing over and over.<br>  <br>  8) Meyer took four books to write what could have fit into one.<br>  <br>  9) Because the plot is cliche and predictable.<br>  <br>  No offense...though...hehe..|`|944a14c77cfd5df8decc7beffcf31f38aa	Oh my God the first answer was amazing...... beautiful and he/she obviously read the book and knew their stuff. It's one thing to hate a book, but to actually read it and hate it enough to actually know why you hate it.... that's real hate. Anyway I can't give an answer better than the first one but I can say this, out of many many books I have read, some boring, some amazing, I can tell you I barely managed to get to page 20 on Twilight and after that I stopped.... seriously though does Stephanie Meyer think that making each chapter 20+ pages makes it look more sophisticated? Jeez. I did not read Twilight. I did watch the movie. Twilight will go down as one of the greatest series because of it's fan base that is to idiotic to realize what a crime it is to other great books more deserving. It plays on the hormones of teenagers in order to distract them from great works that actually have some intellect in them such as Crime and Punishment, 20,000 Leagues under the sea, and so so so many others..... yet this is what we get now? A stupid preteen drama that has a bunch of I loves you in it? And it's the greatest book of all time?..... WHY!!!!!!!!!!!|`|0fwXaFCeaa	time to shine?<br>  oh please...<br>  stephenie meyer might not be the greatest author, but some people like her books|`|Vy8p3Qlcaa	Vampires, now thats a flaw.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	That it was made|`|E28mQDX0aa	Oh my... where do I begin?! There are so many things WRONG with that series.<br>  <br>  First, Meyer's writing is very amateurish, it's FULL of purple prose, she overuses adverbs and adjectives, and completely abuses the thesaurus, Bella is an obvious Mary Sue self insert and there are basic grammar, spelling and sentence structure problems that would have been easily caught had Meyer actually read over what she had written or her editor had actually done their job.<br>  <br>  There really is no story line... it was really nothing but the "romance" between Edward and Bella until page 400 or so, when something final happened and it went by so quickly and wasn't explained well at all (plus, Bella conveniently fainted so Meyer didn't have to write the fight scene between James and the Cullens, a complete cop-out if you ask me) it seemed to me that it was just added because Meyer realized that something besides the "romance" between Bella and Edward had to happen.<br>  <br>  Bella was the most annoying protagonist I have ever had the displeasure of reading about and is so obviously a self insert of Stephenie Meyer. If you look at the detailed description of  Bella on her website and then a picture of Meyer, they look exactly the same.My God, she was so whining and annoying! Plus, she was so dependent on Edward, it was disgusting. She practically freaked out if he wasn't in the same room as her. Also, her and Edward are not in "love" they are in lust. Their relationship is based entirely on physical characteristics. She likes him because he's hot and he likes her because she smells good.<br>  <br>  And, Edward is completely controlling and stalkerish. It is NOT romantic for a guy you barely know to sneak into your bedroom and watch you sleep. That is so very wrong. <br>  <br>  There are also a lot of plot holes, many things that just don't make sense. There have been questions asked by fans that Meyer couldn't even answer because she "didn't know", um... when you're an author and you create something, it's your job to know every detail, no matter how big or how small it is.<br>  <br>  And the messages that this book series sends out to the young girls reading it also pisses me off, I mean... they're completely anti-feminist:<br>  1. It's perfectly okay to have no goals or aspirations or even an education, just get yourself a man and he'll take care of you.<br>  2. It's also perfectly okay to like someone because of their physical features... this is not love people, it's lust! They have nothing in common! He likes her because she smells nice and she likes him because he's hot.<br>  3. When you have several guys fawning over you pick the hottest one of them all because looks are so very important.<br>  4. It's okay if the guy you love sneaks into your bedroom and watches you sleep at night... that's completely normal and romantic... not the the least bit creepy or stalkerish. <br>  <br>  Plus, Meyer's logic makes absolutely no sense and she contradicts herself a lot too. Also, she gets all whiny when people criticize her and she proceeds to blamed THEM for not "understanding" or some crap like that.<br>  <br>  The fans also annoy the hell out of me. Most are such hypocrites... we as haters are allowed an opinion, but we aren't allowed to express it if they disagree with it. Yea... that makes a lot of sense! I'm sick of the fangirls running around calling me names simply for not liking Twilight. It's a book for crying out loud! Also, hate how some fans now consider themselves vampire fans after reading the novels, but they have no intentions to read any more vampire novels. You are not a vampire fan if Twilight is the only "vampire" (and I'm using that word extremely lightly here) you have read.<br>  <br>  I am a huge vampire fan (more into romances, but whatever). That's what drew me to Twilight in the first place. I liked her ideas about vampires until Edward started sparkling... I'm sorry, but No. Just NO. Vampires don't sparkle. By doing that, they are no longer scary or evil in the slightest. And also, no fangs?! How the hell can they bite into their pray with no fangs? No amount of strong teeth would be able to do that without making a huge mess! That's why vampires logically have fangs... it makes it easier and less messy!<br>  <br>  Honestly, Twilight is an embarrassment to vampire literature. Actually, it's an embarrassment to literature in general.<br>  <br>  I think I covered more than just the flaws, but that's really the gist of it.

bC5XeVEIaa	You can prove a negative. There are even several words for doing so. Like refuting. Or debunking.<br>  <br>  Edit: If you're talking about disproving the object of faith, then no, you can't. Not until someone starts to make nonsensical claims to try and justify that faith. In that case, this is a perfect example of proving a negative:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdEZTdOlGss&feature=PlayList&p=AC3481305829426D&index=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdEZTdOlG...</a>|`|uyQXdKLiaa	Because you can't. (and i'm not going to try to prove that you can't because that's impossible.)|`|AA11707728	The people who say that artifically set the parameters of the argument to an absurd, infinite level.  Basically, they say, anything is possible and since there are infinite possibilities you can't eliminate them all.<br>  <br>  That is the logical fallacy of reductio ad absurdum...or rather a version of it.  You make an assumption that is dubious.  In this case, infinite possibilities.  And then come to an absurd conclusion based on the assumption.  You can't test ALL possibilities because anything is possible.  Monkeys might fly out your butt.<br>  <br>  All logical arguments first set conditions and parameters....boundaries that define the issue.  In this case, you set a reasonable, limited number of possible outcomes and then eliminate each to prove a negative.<br>  <br>  It's important to understand that the proof is not absolute...no proof ever is.  It is limited by the initial set of conditions and parameters.  If you change those, you need to redo the proof.|`|CVqj8J4taa	Well lets take the most important negative to prove:<br>  <br>  God does not exist.<br>  <br>  In order to prove this, I would need to find and identify all things in the universe and show that none of them are God.<br>  <br>  On the other hand (the positive):<br>  <br>  God does exist.<br>  <br>  I simply need to find one thing that is identified as God.<br>  <br>  <br>  Alternatively lets look at, essentially, what proofs require: evidence.  For this, lets assume that an existing being leaves a 'footprint'.  When trying to prove that God exists, we can look for a footprint and say "look, this is proof that God exists".  What is the footprint of something that doesn't exist?<br>  <br>  No evidence exists for something that does not exist.  However, the absence of evidence does not prove that something does not exist.|`|I3yU4XvLaa	It's not that you can't prove a negative, it's that you can't prove a UNIVERSAL negative.

Tiger Woods, for example, was certainly born with something "special" that makes him a great golfer.  But he also had to dedicate himself completely to perfecting the game or he'd be like any other guy who hits the links occasionally and happens to be pretty good.  And my family used to think my brother was tone deaf, since he couldn't carry a tune when he sang.  But he studied guitar like a madman and frequently does session work because he's a really good guitarist.  He only started playing to prove us wrong, but wound up committing himself to it and finding a pretty good career in the process (he also owns a recording studio).  He did try voice lessons, but he and his teacher concluded that he'd never be able to sing, which indicates we can't necessarily do something just because we want to do it.  But there are plenty of things we can accomplish, whether we're naturally gifted at them or not.|`|UfV26NrXaa	I have read about the "ten year rule," that is, many researchers say you have to do something for 10 years and x amount of hours before becoming proficient in it, so clearly something you gain for yourself. Also, I have read time and again that persistence is far more important than innate talent. However, I'd say the Einsteins, Federers and Yo Yo Mas of the world are definitely born with something special...|`|gkoX68Awaa	You can be born without talent. It can be cultured. If you truly desire something you will not let a small thing like that stop you. People who stutter really bad were taught to sing to overcome their stuttering. One of these people went on to have a pretty decent country music career and was a heck of a good singer, you probably heard of his daughter Pam Tillis, his name is Mel Tillis. He only started singing to overcome a speech impediment and turned it into a career.<br>  <br>  Proof that anyone who wants it bad enough doesnt need to be "born" with it.<br>  <br>  Good luck !
HUDjXVOyaa	Many people are able to appreciate art. Some people are nervice and need help. People are funny that way, especially when it comes to art. Selling art is very intuitive and has to do a lot with "going with the flow." A good way to increase the chances of people appreciating your work is to explain what it means. If your not comfortable with talking, another option is to hand out artist statements or CV/artistic Resumes. <br>  <br>  People to look out for are the ones who stop. If they have time to stop, it usually means that there is something within your art that strikes them. This is good. Your goal is to keep that person in front of your art for as long as possible because the more time they spend looking at your art the greater the chance for a sale. Starting a conversation can help you achieve that plus gives you a chance to explain your work to them. From there, that person will gain a deeper appreciate and understanding of your artwork. <br>  <br>  A good way to determine the price of your art is to look at other artists who are similar in style and medium to you. See what they are charging for there works.|`|8h5gXadiaa	Wow that's good. Ever heard of deviant art? Visit its website 'www.deviantart.com'.

2TLXfQKDaa	You can look at the work of other photographers and hope you pick up inspiration through them.  What I choose to do when I draw or photograph, is let ideas flow with a thought process.  Pick a feeling or mood, or lets use the one on the tip of your tongue.

Basically, he says he will do anything for her without arguing or saying no, but secretly the whole time he is trying to show her that a man should not act that way, a man should not go through all that stuff to boost a woman's ego, just because he loves her.<br>  <br>    stanza 1- the guy is trying to say that he will do anything for this lady. he will go through embarressment, and basically ****, "descretion" to give her what she wants, keep her satisfied, and to show her that she is the best.<br>  <br>     stanza 2- he says he will do anything for her without raising his voice or showing power, to declare his affection for her. He also says that she should make his decisions because he "shall be saved through her"
mO1s4pMgaa	Evermore by Alyson Noel<br>  Ever was a normal high school girl living a pretty good life. But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her|`|2wRWkjIlaa	Twilight, but if your a teenage girl you've prob'y already read that<br>  <br>  it's not a romance book, but this book changed my life, PLEASE READ IT<br>  it's called "Define Normal"<br>  <br>  There's an amazing romance book by judy bloom, it's not like her other books... it's the only romance book that she's written for teens so it should be able to find<br>  <br>  So B.

hv5JiSvvaa	Harriet Jacobs herself sums this question up in chapter 8 if Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.  She writes, "There is a great difference between Christianity and religion at the south.  If a man goes to the communion table, and pays money into the treasury of the church, no matter if it be the price of blood, he is called religious.  If a pastor has offspring by a woman not bu his wife, the church dismisses him, if she is a white woman; but if she is a colored, it does not hinder hiss continuing to be their good shepherd."<br>  <br>  Pious slave owners were often described as ones who beat, raped, and killed their slaves, but you would find them in the pew of church every Sunday.  Many slave owners of that time used the Bible to justify slavery.  (While the Bible does use the word slavery, it is not the same as the slavery in America.  Slavery in Bible times were workers that worked in order to pay someone a debt that they owed. Even then, they had rights.)  When people can find a place to justify their actions, they tend to go to that place often.  People do not want to feel that they are living wrong and need to change.  When slave owners could justify their actions with the Bible, they continued to be faithful to their church and their faith.  Perhaps people act more harsh and unrelentless when they convince themselves that what they are doing is not wrong.  If you convince yourself that a person is less than human, it is easier to treat them as less than human. <br>  <br>  Jacobs, whose grandmother was a God-faithful woman, understood the hypocrisy of the "pious" slave owners of the south.  This is one of the reasons that she wrote the novel.  The people in the north did not understand the true atrocities of slavery.  The novel was written to open their eyes (and hopefully their hearts) to a "Christian" nation that so desperately needed the true love of Christ.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Jacobs

They are actually the only agent I know of who is in Texas. Also, those kids probably get acting lessons now. Good Luck!|`|NjYCvfYGaa	"Kids". Kids aren't expected to have a enormous resume. If they have good training, and their acting coach has referred them to the agency then that's how they got to work with the amazing people. You've got it all mixed up. Don't find training just to get into a specific agency. Get training to learn and eventually your coach will refer you to an agency as well, maybe you can suggest the Kim Dawson Agency.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything!

M2thieHqaa	Make sure that your writing environment is conducive to writing. You should have the following (in no particular order):<br>  <br>  1. Reference books within easy reach. The internet cannot tell you everything, and certainly not in great detail. I've been writing for many years, and I still reach out to my bookshelf (right next to my writing desk) for everything from the Red Letter Shakespeare to the complete works of Edgar Allen Poe. <br>  <br>  2. Good music. I have a complete stereo system set up on my writing desk, with over 300 CD's, as well as Internet radio. Good writing is helped by good music. When writing battle sequences, I like to listen to heavy metal or Wagner. <br>  <br>  3. A window. Seriously, nothing helps writing than to be able to see the sun or the sky. <br>  <br>  4. Funny stuff. Too much writing for a prolonged period of time can leave you drained, so take time out to "recharge", Nothing helps this more than laughter. I keep a shelf of funny stories filled, and have 50 years of Mad Magazine on CD-Rom to laugh at when I'm tired from writing. It helps!<br>  <br>  5. As for grammar, the book you need is called "Elements of Style" by Strunk and White. This is the book that most writers swear by! I do, too.|`|yjyBbVJoaa	True writing comes straight from the heart. Use your feelings and experiences to guide you.|`|d267fab7a0b268922f3228351f52baf1aa	1) Make sure your format is correct.  If you haven't yet go out and pick up one book on scriptwriting or even order your favorite movie script on-line.  They are in book cover, relatively small but written out just like a screen play, with camera angles, setting, staging and lighting.<br>  <br>  2)  Take a class even an on-line class will help.  Nothing fancy just something to give you a group to bounce ideas around with, even if not the subject of the movie but the writing itself.  It helps to have some friends handy to cheer you on and to help out with explaining grammatical stuff when a book won't do.<br>  <br>  3)  I personally prefer to write in silence.  The story is in my head and like a movie I hear and see everything so I don't want outside distraction.  Chances are when it's done you might want an original score, I always love the Batman sound tracks.<br>  <br>  4)  Going to film fesitvals, movie/writers conferences and taking time to know the business side of the industry will also keep you pumped.  Don't overwhelm yourself but don't wait until it's done either.  Marketing your script is time consuming as well so best to learn as you go so you'll be properly prepared.<br>  <br>  (The above advice comes from experience.  I hadn't completed my manuscript when I was given a two book deal.  Then I had to learn about the industry in less than a few months.  I got a serious crash course and three years later my head is still spinning.)|`|PWkZffEzaa	I learned this a while ago... write down what ever is on your mind. Don't think about it too hard. Just write as much as you can and as often as you can, then edit it later. You might find that you like some of the things that come to you at the spur of the moment.|`|RrB51Mq4aa	Ignore everything that is bothering you, spelling, grammar and bad directions. Just sit down and fire on with it. It's a first draft, it's supposed to be raw and broken in many a place. The spelling is bad, who cares the words are there, the grammar is bad, hell once you've read over it a couple of times you'll see where commas and sentences should end because you'll be able to tell that it doesn't flow. and then make some changes and then pass it out to people you know and I'm sure they'll be more than willing to proof read for you and mark down what they see.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

4Xvyq6GNaa	That's almost apples to oranges.  While both books are in the genre of "fantasy", there are many differences that render them almost incomparable.<br>  <br>  Harry Potter was targeted for an audience of very young children, and gradually expanded into a series targeted for all ages.  The main theme that underlies all of the books is the battle between light and dark, and how a hero undertakes that battle. There are also many more books involved with the series, giving the author much more wiggle room.  Also, this series was extensively researched because it is very plot-intensive.  While there is a lot of character development going on, much of it is as a result of the plotline.  Readers who enjoy intense character development and a lot of exploration into the human soul might have found this series lacking.<br>  <br>  Twilight, on the other hand, is very different.  It was targeted towards young teen girls, and has mostly stuck to that fanbase.  This series is extremely involved with character development--there is very little plot, only enough to make the series interesting.  It studies human love much more deeply than did Harry Potter, exploring what it is that we want in a relationship, what we're looking for. While to some it might seem like a continuous "I love you" "No I love you" kind of story, if you read into it it really reveals a lot about what we desire in a relationship. Readers who are looking for a very active plotline, as is found in most teen novels, might have found this series lacking.  <br>  <br>  I personally enjoyed both series very much, but I believe they're very different, so I find it very difficult to choose one over the other.|`|7080N59waa	I like both, but overall the story line of Harry Potter is better. I really like Twilight though and I think that the concept behind it (finding true love that can overcome all obsticles) is really great and and amazing thing to think of but I sometimes got bored with the minor details of the books (I'm still reading the last one now). Harry Potter on the other hand is really never boring and everything just fits perfectly.<br>  So I think they're both good books but Harry Potter has more to offer.|`|xVu4bBnxaa	i think alex should get best answer, i agree with what he said and he went into great detail. I don't think i could describe it better.<br>  <br>  i've been a fan of the harry potter series for a long time and i think it's amazingly complex and simple at the same time. when it comes to vampire novels I prefer Anne Rice. her books are sensual and delicious; although the series admittedly starts to dwindle after the third book.|`|Qb1P7DCQaa	ALEX- u forgot that hes like a 100 year old pedophile and the fact that bella threw herself off a cliff to hear his voice in her head! and some call THAT romantic!

There was a little love triangle with Ron, Hermione, and lavander..... BUT IT WASN'T CLICHE. and please give me one example in which a charecter in twilight evolved.... at all.  And Harry Potter didn't expand to appeal to older people. the charecters in the story grew older as did the fans.|`|mn9bqc81aa	Harry Potter is better without a doubt. It's more interesting and it has everything! Twilight is just vampires. Harry Potter has vampires and everything else.|`|yym6vskIaa	Harry Potter.  It has better writing, more developed characters, universal themes, and a unique setting.  Stephenie Meyer just wrote down her fantasy in amateur language based on an overused plot formula.|`|gI3aBxCuaa	Harry Potter. Twilight's lines are too boring to me and Harry Potter is much more interesting, everyone reads it <333|`|86oPkfzOaa	Harry Potter. Twilight is just unrealistic, I can't think of it as real. With Harry Potter, the characters are realistic and the plot line is much better and more original, and the overall writing is great. But, come one, Isabella Swan went into a depression when her boyfriend left her? She didn't stop until she met a new guy! She's like a girl who can't live without a man in her life! And, Bella gets EVERYTHING she wants, I mean everything! And the ending was not in the least bit realistic. JK Rowling actually made a believable ending, it wasn't totally happy. And, when have you ever seen Bella sacrificing something? She got everything: to be a 'sparkly' vampire, have a beyond smart kid, a vampire husband, to stay in touch with Jake, EVERYTHING! Totally unbelievable and unrealistic. Whatever I didn't say, Alex said for me!|`|Ys47rcdkaa	Harry Potter, and use the bloody search bar next time you ask an unoriginal question!|`|r5h7TmWJaa	Harry Potter. Twilight is good, but very basic, and nothing really special. There are hundreds of other similar books out there that are just not as popular. Harry Potter is much more complex, and every sentence leaves you wanting more. Versus Twilight, which I had to put down about halfway through my second time reading it because it simply got too lame and sappy. It focused very little on the other characters, who were all fascinating, versus Harry Potter, who focused a bit on everyone. I do not mean to disrespect S. Meyer in any way, but HP is flat out, a million times better and better written.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	Harry Potter. Better storyline. Better characters. Feels like it's been more thought out and so much more happens.|`|Xl7UHNB1aa	harry potter is better, only teenyboppers like twilight. Stephen King admitted Stephenie Meyers can't write.|`|M0bE2IBQaa	This question has been asked many many times...<br>  Harry Potter.|`|swigidUeaa	Harry Potter, It's better written with more real of characters. It has a real plot through each book and throughout the whole series. The characters have flaws unlike twilight where everyone is perfect and a reader can better relate to them. The harry potter books have differences. In twilight, the same thing happens in every book. Twilight has a lot of grammatical errors and the same descriptions over and over again--if there's any descriptions at all. There are parts in twilight when I feel practically blind. Bella jumps from place to place with no explanation of how she got there. there are holes in the story line. <br>  <br>  Harry Potter is overall written better, read better, and not as annoying as twilight.|`|J2gr1ogHaa	Harry Potter, its better written, more thorough. Characters are interesting, the plots are always changing, the theme is good versus evil throughout, it can be read to children and adults love it too! Beautifully descriptive, and more stories!<br>  <br>  How can one say these books have no love or actual human developement? After all, isn't the reason Harry Potter is still alive due to the fact that his mother loved him so much??? There is romance, but in a way that makes you remember your first crush or date, because the characters are growing up.  The story is maturing because the characters are.<br>  <br>  Alex, GREAT ANSWER|`|wEEOvu5Waa	First off..OMFG...Alex, you are THE BEST. "Jesus Christ, I need a plot" Im just dying here..really..that was wonderful..made my day. lmao<br>  <br>  Anyway.<br>  <br>  God, Harry Potter owns Twilight in every aspect. HP actually has a -plot- compared to Twilight which is just mindless drama and fake romance.<br>  <br>  HP actually has character depth, and they are more believable. She also made a school of witchcraft believable, unlike with Meyer who totally ruined the image of a Vampire. I mean really, a vampire who sparkles in the sun, and can sire children? I wont even go into the problems with that, like the fact that a Vampire is a dead body...so how does it father children? O_o<br>  <br>  Its sad that people actually think Twilight could hold a candle to HP. But then again, Twilight is a realllyyyyy easy book to read, so more people will read that rather than challenge their brains with something actually worth while.<br>  <br>  Rowling needs to come out and beat some ***.|`|W8F9PboZaa	Ok Twilight is, I can honestly say the worst book I have ever read<br>  Bella: I love you Edward<br>  Edward: I love you too you are so beautiful<br>  Bella: No YOU are so beautiful. I love you. You're all sparkly<br>  Edward: You are the most perfect creature ever<br>  1000 pages and 3 books later<br>  Bella: I love you Edward<br>  Edward: I love you you are so beautiful<br>  OMFG it's just them proliferating their love for each other for 1000+ pages. And right at the end Smeyer is like JESUS CHRIST I NEED PLOT and throws some crap in.<br>  <br>  Ok Edward is not hot. He is a creepy stalker. he watches her sleep. He won't let her see her friends. He follows her around. He won't let her drive. He beats her up while they're having sex. He gives her a c-section with his teeth. Come on that's gross. Bella is disgusting, falling apart as soon as Edward leaves and only getting some semblance of togetherness back when she finds another guy to take Edward's place. PATHETIC.<br>  <br>  Harry Potter beats Twilight hands down. Harry Potter caters for a much wider audience, while Twilight appeals to tween's. Every single one of my friends hates Twilight. Thinks it's absolutely ridiculous, the writing is terrible, the characters one dimensional and the plot cliche. We're 18. My sister, who is 13 is in love with Twilight. So are all her friends. They get together and talk about it and how 'awesome' it is and 'how much they love Edward' and how they 'just wish Jacob would die'.<br>  <br>  Younger kids love the earlier Harry Potter books. But can you really see a 10 year old finishing Order of the Phoenix. They'd have to be a pretty smart 10 year old. But Harry Potter has fans in every walk of life. The Harry Potter phenomenon started, really, about 7 years ago. The people that started reading Harry Potter at say, age 10-14, are now 17-21. They're adults and the majority of them still love Harry Potter. And there's the giant adult fan base. Basically every single harry potter fan site it run by an older adult. And there's hundreds of them. I made my parents read Harry Potter. They liked it. Read the whole series. My sister made them read Twilight. Mum said the first book was terribly written and couldn't continue. Dad couldn't even finish the first book. They both have uni degrees, they're not idiots.<br>  <br>  Basically Twilight is aimed for girls 12-16. Smeyer writes likes she's swallowed a thesaurus, her books are riddled with plot holes and discrepancies. How can Edward, who has been dead for nearly 100 years, have sperm, which is alive, and has the capability to father a child. Yeah makes awesome sense. Plus he's a complete stalker. And abusive. Bella is portrayed as a woman who relies entirely on a man, after Edward left she completely fell apart. And this girl is supposed to be a rolemodel for other girls. <br>  <br>  Now compare this to Harry Potter. Please show me one plot hole. The main characters have substance and flaws and are amazing role models. Look at Hermione in comparison to Bella. She's smart, loyal, courageous and stands up for what she believes in. She loves Ron from the age of 14, and despite his not realizing it, she still stays strong and continues on in her life. The perfect role model for young girls. Harry is also a great role model. He continues to love despite the terrible events which have occured in his life. He is even willing to sacrifice his own life for everybody else. There's hundreds of other amazing characters. Ron, Snape, Dumbledore, Remus Lupin, Ginny. The list goes on and on. Who have you got in Twilight? more and more one dimensional characters who are nothing more than pretty stalkers. <br>  <br>  Ok and every single character in Twilight is one dimensional. <br>  Bella: Pathetic Mary Sue<br>  Edward: I love you Bella. And the oldest virgin ever<br>  Jacob: annoying.<br>  And that's it. That's all the major characters. If you include like Emmett and Jasper and Alice. They don't even have personalities. The best one, in my opinion is Rosalie.<br>  <br>  Every single Harry Potter character has a background, unique personality and REAL faults. Choose me ANY character and you can pull faults and positive traits in their personalities. Not like Bella being "clumsy" which everyone seems to find endearing so isn't really a fault at all. And what's with her supposed to be average looking? yeah ok coz it's not like every guy in the school wants to be in her pants apparently. At my high school all the guys went for the average girl, definitely. Sorry now I'm onto the Bella being a Mary Sue rant again. <br>  <br>  And JK obviously put some effort and research into Harry Potter. I mean look at the deep roots into mythology, legends, latin and other languages. Stephenie meyer had a pretty dream. Good for her. Even other authors acknowledge how much better Rowling is to Smeyer. Stephen King, best selling author for decades said: <br>  "The real difference is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer and Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn," he said. "She's not very good."<br>  <br>  JK Rowling intertwines foreshadowing through the entire series, with events in the first novel foreshadowing events that occur in the seventh, which was written 17 years later. What have you got in Twilight? certainly nothing that would match Harry Potter. You simply have a love story which appeals to kids who haven't got the maturity to realize how fake it is, or the life experience to realize it is appallingly written|`|uNIHqmH8aa	Hard.

AA10912074	You usually use at least several flashes/strobes.  If you are indoors, you often only directly set off one flash and the others will have an optical slave that sets off the others.  <br>  <br>  Many photographers are going with wireless sets.  There is a trigger that fits on your camera's hotshoe, and a receiver that connects to a strobe (you can put a receiver on each strobe if needed).  When you take a picture, the trigger sends the signal to the receiver and sets off the flash.  Popular names for wireless sets are pocket wizards, skyports, and cybersyncs.  There is an influx of non-name brand wireless gear from China on eBay as well.  Reliability (and lack of FCC approval) is the concern there  <br>  <br>  If you are using monolights - which are AC strobes - you would want to purchase at least 300 watt second units if you are really starting a studio.

It is important to know if you want good results.|`|A8vsbah7aa	Its quite easy to learn how to use a camera.<br>  <br>  Tbh, to get really crisp lighting all you need is a bright room to start off with.<br>  <br>  The lights that you see around (maybe on photoshoots) are different coloured flashes, With create a background colour of the subject.<br>  <br>  =)
2TLXfQKDaa	If you want an organizer with some pretty high end editing tools go with Aperture.  To see what aperture can do check out the tutorials for it.<br>  <br>  PS CS4 is an extremely powerful end product creator.  You can take a photo and manipulate absolutely everything you can possibly think of.  Within PS there is the option to open a file in a Camera Raw (a sort of mini program) which does pretty much everything aperture can do.  Also with PS CS4 you'll get Bridge which gives you an organizational tool like aperture.  <br>  <br>  If you need the high end processes of PS that's all you really need.  If you just need color manipulation and adjustments, some color correction and all the other normal editing tools stick with Aperture.  Try the trials for both, and spend 30 days seeing which program is more for you.  PS can do most of what aperture can do minus a few things, Aperture can do a lot, but is limited to adjustments and fixes.  Make your assessment during the 30days, start with PS CS4, then try aperture.  I have both because I purchased aperture a good bit of time  ahead PS, if I could do it over I'd probably just stick with PS CS4.  I do absolutely love the way some tools handle in Aperture, and as far as organization goes it beats PS and as well as in the aesthetics department.  But, as I said, PS can do pretty much all of what Aperture can do so if price is not an issue, go PS.<br>  <br>  Try the trials first, no point in pumping out the cash for PS CS4 if you only need aperture.  Oh and unless you need 3d rendering tools and a few other higher end features, don't bother with extended.<br>  <br>  --edit--<br>  An example of something PS can do that aperture can not, HDRI <--- look that up if you're not familiar with it.<br>  <br>  Aperture is more than enough for most people, but if you want to get very artistic and take your photos to a level that editing just won't get you PS will get you there.|`|MMnjWEM7aa	Photoshop CS4, by far.  Especially if price isn't an option.<br>   here are a few helpful links:<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=332011" rel="nofollow">http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.p...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=327919" rel="nofollow">http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.p...</a>|`|7Hm0UzLHaa	Depends totally on what you are after, Photoshop has thousands of features you can use but most people never use even half of them.  If you want to pursue the digital art side of photography, PS is the way to go.  <br>  Aperture is more for the photographer who doesn't have an interest on altering their shots too much, just enhancing the picture with a good range of adjustments.  Of course Photoshop will do this as well but it costs more.
NaM4ZT64aa	Good question.  This really made me think.<br>  <br>  In my humble opinion, time exists only as it is defined by space, as is supported by most time-space theory.  Thus, as space is no longer the same as it was in the past, the past is no longer existent.<br>  <br>  The past in memory is not existence.  That is only chemical recordings of experience inside of a physical entity (a conscious brain).|`|tqWW0GaNaa	It exists as a set of pre-conditions to the present.<br>  <br>  Contained in the present are a number of effects from the past, including human memory, but also physical facts .... the big bang still exists as a pre-condition of the state of the universe today.<br>  <br>  My dead grandfather still exists ... not as a currently living person, but as a precursor to my mother and to myself.|`|AA10217752	As my high school teacher said, history repeats itself.

VOZWgWgLaa	Personally, it was Saladin. He lived in the area and had a greater direct interest in the area. Richard I of England when he returned home was soon consumed with crushing his brother John, who had usurped the throne in Richard's abscence, and restoring order in his own realm.<br>  <br>  In terms of the ideological argument between Christian and Muslim, the answer would be neither. BOTH had equal claim to it. Religious people will always argue about the ownership of the "Holy Land" as it contains sites that are extremely important to all three monotheistic religions. The Wailing Wall in Jerusalem is believed to be the sole remaining piece of the Jewish Temple burnt by the Romans in 70CE. The Church of the Holy Sepulcher has been built on the site where they believe Christ was crucified. There is also the Dome of the Rock where Mohammad is said to have ascended into heaven.|`|AA11304025	Saladin. He was more local.<br>  Richard was an aggressive immigrant|`|721304c80de56710adba6c3a8fdc5f7daa	Interesting question. It touches on the fact that history is always relative.<br>  <br>  One simple rule you can carry with you when you think about history:<br>  "History is decided by the victor."-anonymous<br>  <br>  Who was more justified? I guess that would be Saladin; he ultimately won.

49472a84fe9634f0f30a66f419d61c8faa	Denis Leary is an incredibly funny stand-up comedian, I love his work. I wasn't too sure about his writing skills, I mean other than writing jokes for his act but I borrowed the "Why We Suck" book from a friend to read and I loved it! It's hilarious, and so honest too. Some people might find him a bit too honest but not me. If you liked Chelsea Handler's books then you might find Leary's a bit rougher going (he's a lot more harsh but he's more funny too, IMHO) but I would suggest to give him a try.
AA10276642	You're not understanding what a college dance degree is all about. Getting a 4-year bachelor's degree in any art form is about learning how to BE an artist - to create new works and to invent NEW styles. Learning ballet, modern and jazz forms the foundation for doing that.<br>  <br>  It would be like wanting to go to college as a writing major when all you want to do is keep writing graphic novels because that's what you already do and want to keep doing. That's not being an artist, that's being a craftsman: you REcreate a particular art form. There's nothing wrong with that. You just don't get a 4-year degree to study a craft. Learning a craft occurs in a vocational setting. In the case of dance, it occurs in dance academies, studios, etc. Dancers who just want to pursue ballet also should not try to do that by majoring in dance. The surest way to become a ballet dancer is to attend a pre-professional ballet academy.<br>  <br>  There are college dance programs that don't require students to already be good at dance, but they won't prepare a student to dance professionally. Like with the writing example: if a college has to start you out by teaching you the basics of how to write, you're not going to graduate and ease right into becoming a professional writer. However, if you already have to be good and pass a dance audition to get in, then it's like being a talented writer, and your chances of getting published after graduation are much greater.<br>  <br>  So if you just want to dance Funk styles professionally, just keep practicing your craft and go out and do that. Seek out auditions and look for work. However, if you're willing to get back to learning the basics of most dance forms, there are college programs that don't expect you to already be good at jazz, modern and ballet.<br>  <br>  I hope that answers your question.|`|3MAi3vJmaa	I really appreciate that you aspire to get a dance major for hip-hop talent, but I think down the road, you might NEED to take ballet or jazz. Only because, the really amazing dancers do ballet. However, you don't need to be good at ballet to be good at hip-hop (even though it probably could help). I understand that you wouldn't like ballet or jazz it might just not be your thing, but find a place where you CAN get noticed for your talent because you should always follow your dream.|`|D3ep2x7caa	you might have to "forcefully" take jazz, ballet, and modern dance...but it should be worth it, because it can enhance your skills that you already have with hip hop. this is only if you truly want to aspire in dancing, though.

In it they swear undying friendship, wage furious battles--and drive Christina's mother crazy. You won't believe how much fun a cardboard box can be! A gleeful little story of imaginative playenlivened by the delightful illustrations."<br>  <br>  "At first, when Christina gets the box in which her mother's refrigerator was shipped, she turns it into a castle. After Fats Watson, her friend, decides to kick it over after she locks him in because he ate her fig newtons, she then turns it into a clubhouse. After Fats decides to sit on it and cave it in, she turns it into a race car. After he cuts off the nose to "check the engine", it collapses so Christina turns it into a dance floor of her summer mansion and she and Fats have a formal ball. Fats then decides to clean the floor, hoses it off and well, it melts. FINALLY, Christina's mother gets to take the box to the curb only in time for Fats to bring over two more boxes his mother's waser and dryer came in to be set up as boats in the front yard. Christina's mother is quite dismayed at the paper boxes in the yard but it's quite cute how Christina comes up with a new use for the box each time it is destroyed."|`|7aoHmM4baa	is it   "jack and the boubou"?<br>  or<br>  "home alone and the fridge"

o3sYIdOzaa	Mary Barrett Dyer 1611-1660 was a Puritan, who became a Quaker and was hanged for refusing to leave the Massachsetts Bay Colony.  The colony had enacted a law banning Quakers.  She was one of the four Boston martyrs.  <br>  <br>  Dyer had also supported Anne Hutchinson, who believed that God spoke to individuals not just the clergy and incurred their wrath.  Governor Winthrop found out she had had a stillborn, deformed baby and had it exhumed and decided it was evidence of heresy.  She was banished more than once, but went back to protest the law banning Quakers and was finally executed for refusing to leave.<br>  <br>  "Nay, I came to keep bloodguiltiness from you, desireing you to repeal the unrighteous and unjust law made against the innocent servants of the Lord. Nay, man, I am not now to repent. ” <br>  —Mary Dyer's last words<br>   <br>  "After her death a member of the General Court uttered one of those bitter scoffs which prove the truest of all epitaphs, "She did hang as a flag for others to take example by."<br>  <br>  She was the last Quaker to be hanged in the colony, and the law was later repealed. <br>  <br>  A bronze statue of her by Quaker sculptor Sylvia Shaw Judson stands in front of the Massachusetts state capitol in Boston; a copy stands in front of the Friends Center in downtown Philadelphia, and another in front of Stout Meetinghouse at Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana."
tqg3qZzSaa	The Germans were allied to the Italians but in reality they were allied to the fascist government under Mussolini. Italy was allied to Germany before WW1 began but switched sides during the beginning of the war. Once the allies started their offensives and began invading parts of Italy the Italian people pretty much gave up, only the government forced them to continue fighting. Resistance movements across Axis controlled Europe were growing more bold. The Germans who were already stretched thin, fighting in every theatre of war and having to prop their allies up, believed that any town that aided the allies or resistance movement should be massacred. The Germans did the same thing across Europe, from France to Russia people were slaughtered should they even speak of opposing the Germans.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	yes they were but the Germans probably thought they were or were going to help the Americans so they thought the would try to stop that.|`|Q9lI5UViaa	They were allies, but like in world ware one they changed the sites. I dont know the year, but i think in 1944 Italy became allied with britan and usa and declared war on germany. so german and italy no no allies more. the italian resistance fought the germans and germans made some massacres in revenge.

mO1s4pMgaa	Evermore by Alyson Noel<br>  Ever was a normal high school girl living a pretty good life. But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?<br>  <br>  I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight.

44ea06d717408390822ebe87e8153cbfaa	Hitler came to power during the Great Depression.  You might have seen pictures of bread lines and shanty towns here in America.  In Germany it was much, much worse.  The mark (the German currency) was so worthless, people were burning them in their furnaces instead of wood because it took so many marks to buy the wood... it was actually cheaper to burn the money.  It took a whole wheel barrel of money to buy a loaf of bread.<br>  <br>  In those hard times, people were desperate for someone to save them.  Hitler promised to get people back to work, to stop the inflation, and to restore the dignity that Germany had recently lost when they lost World War I.  And he was a very charismatic speaker, so people believed him.  And he intimidated his political opponents through strong arm tactics.|`|Z1FX7DwCaa	germany was under alot of distress. their german mark had been completely minipulated and it took nearly 3000 marks to simply buy an egg. the german people were in a complete depression because their life savings were now worthless.

Agents know where gigs are, and will call you when a job comes up that is right for you.<br>  <br>  Another thing you can do is start buying Ross Reports. Ross reports are little magazines that come out with future filming and screening dates for different film and stage projects. (Most of the stuff in there is LA/NY, but there's a lot of MD/PA stuff as well). You can get those in the magazine section of most bookstores. <br>  <br>  Other than that just keep working, keep doing student productions, and make sure you get a copy of all the student productions you're in! A lot of casters want you to have a demo reel of work you've done, and that's really valuable. Get some headshots too if you don't already have any! Go to someone who specializes in headshots. <br>  <br>  There's a lot of non-union work in PA, so I think you definitely have a shot at it, you just have to put the work into it.|`|1oj4aamaaa	You need a portfolio.

MUEEARHyaa	i don't hate twilight, but what i don't like about it is that people are over-obsessed with it<br>  i read it 3 years ago, and now suddenly, everyone decides to read it<br>  i liked it then, but i didn't think it was the best book in the world<br>  i hope this helps (:|`|Q49d8oD1aa	so, I do NOT like Twilight, that's my opinion, and being a "hater", these are my reasons:<br>  Bella is a classic Mary-Sue and she has no personality...<br>  (she is pretty without trying and she doesn't think she is, she is overly smart, she is the "ordinary girl")<br>  Bella's "flaws" aren't really flaws at all (modesty, clumsiness)<br>  Edward is "flawless and godlike", he also does not have any depth...<br>  none of the characters mature throughout the books (and since Edward is perfect anyways, why would he need to?)<br>  the books were written poorly and SM uses a lot of the same adjectives throughout the entire series...<br>  the books are basically purple prose...<br>  there are many plot holes in the book, because SM didn't think them over enough...<br>  the plot itself is cheesy and unoriginal...<br>  (eg: she is the new girl and immediately all of the guys fall in love with her, as does the "hottest" most "unattainable guy"..)<br>  the vampires are hardly vampires...(sparkling instead of burning)<br>  Bella and Edward's love is at first purely physical...(Bella smells good, Edward looks good)<br>  the books sends bad messeges to teenagers:<br>  Twilight: "yes, it is OK for guys to stalk you, watching you in your sleep"<br>  New Moon: "without guys, teenage girls will spiral into suicide"<br>  Eclipse: " it is OK to try and commit suicide for the one you love"<br>  Breaking Dawn: "girls should get pregnent and married at a young age"<br>  anyone who doeesn't like the main character is "bad" (eg: Rosalie)<br>  there is no originality in the story (how many vampire-mortal love stories have there been?...many, many, many...)<br>  how Bella seems to need Edward every-second-of-every day, she is the typical damsel in distress...<br>  naming the character Bella Swan is so cliché... <br>  there is also Edward's abusive, controlling and stalking issues...<br>  real couples aren't like Bella and Edward in real life...(love isn't like that)<br>  the ending was too perfect...(she led the story to a big climax, then the main characters talked it over, and went home...she couldn't bear to kill of her main characters...)<br>  <br>  it's also the fans as well...<br>  there is a whole hoard of screaming fangirls, who probably only like the books for Edward...(and yes I know that what I just said is a blanket statement, I know that not all fans are obsessive, teenage girls, but most of the Twilight fans on Y!A are)<br>  the fangirls are vicious and just as cruel (crueler) as the "haters"<br>  hearing about Twilight 24/7 will drive anyone who is not a fan up the wall...<br>  and it's annoying when Twilight-fans can't understand why I don't like the series....<br>  and it's kinda scary watching the obsessive people give answers in this section...<br>  (eg: some girl answered a question saying something like: "NO WAY! EDWARD'S MINE! HE'S GONNA PUT HIS BABIES IN ME, AND I'M GONNA PUSH THEM OUT THOUGH MY BIRTH CANAL!!!")<br>  <br>  another thing that I don't like is when Twilight fans compare Harry Potter to Twilight, then say that Twilight is better...<br>  Being a Harry Potter fan, I really don't like that, seeing as Harry Potter is one of my favorite series, and Twilight is...not...<br>  <br>  I don't hate the books because they are popular...I HAVE READ THE BOOKS...okay?<br>  It really is annoying when people say that the only reason that "haters" don't like Twilight is because they are too popular or because they haven't read the books...<br>  <br>  to the people who say that Twilight takes them to another world:<br>  this always happens with all the books I read...Twilight was no different, every book I have ever read has been an escape from reality, it's not just Twilight...|`|imKCvvFKaa	im a huge romance fanatic and a vampire fanatic, no one bigger than me! it's a disgrace to both romance and vampires.! don't even get me started! bella is needy, edward controlling, abusive and creepy, bella commits suicide just to be with edward? he watches her sleep and stalks her and the kiss?

63b948f89ebc2e053374a20fd8f4b0b6aa	1) For the most part, the uncut version of the book is appropriate. I guarantee that you've had to read worse (content-wise) books for school. Don't fret. The uncut version however, does contain many inappropriate references and situations that weren't found in the original.<br>  <br>  2) When I read it, I planned on reading 50 pages per day. I ended up finishing it in 8 days. I got into it and couldn't put it down. For most people though, I would say about 2-2.5 weeks at an average pace.<br>  <br>  3) I read the book in high school, so I would say it's a pretty easy read for a high school student. I read it in both freshman and sophomore year.<br>  <br>  4) The uncut version is about 400 pages longer than the regular, original version (1200 pages v. 800 pages). I liked the uncut version better, but for time's sake, I would say read the regular one. It has much less exposition and thus, moves a bit faster. Try the uncut version afterward if you like. Maybe over the summer.<br>  <br>  5) The uncut version has a red bar across the top and down the spine saying "for the first time, complete and uncut." Also, many of the MM paperbacks are now printed as the uncut version (it will say so in the front cover of the book), so watch for what you're buying.<br>  <br>  6) The unfortunate answer is no, it's not as good. The ending was quite bad, but I have to say, the trip there was phenomenal. Most people who say it was King's best book say that because they haven't read anything else by him, and they only read it because it was long (bragging rights), or because someone told them to. I know my answer is a bit mixed, but I liked it up until the final 50 pages or so. But I just made up my own ending in my head that I like better.<br>  <br>  If you want to read a great King book, try one of these:<br>  <br>  Long: It (not school appropriate)<br>  Short: Misery<br>  -or- many high school students like Cell. It was very good, especially the ending. But it really is a love it or hate it book.|`|CblODn2Kaa	I'm in high school and I've read it, you should have no problem reading it, it's not that hard. It does have swearing and sex, but I highly doubt your teacher will have a problem with it, because it's such a good book. It is a really long book, I read the uncut version which is 1500 pages. I don't know how long it takes most people to read it, but I took about 6 weeks reading slowly. If you can, read the uncut version. So much is added to the plot and characters that it would make your report easier, but if you really don't have enough time the original is still good. The uncut version will be much longer and will probably say that's it's uncut on the cover. I loved it. It's one of my favorite books, I highly recommend it. It makes you really think about what you would do if you were in that kind of situation. I think it would be really good to write a report on, because there's so much stuff to analyze and pick apart.|`|SOPRt0Ffaa	The Stand is appropriate for a high school student, and it's a great choice for a book report because it has excellent characterization, several meaty conflicts, literary allusions and symbolism, and an awesome theme. <br>  <br>  I read both versions; the uncut book has about 400-500 extra pages. I suggest you read the longer version because it is the one King himself prefers. The publishers made him edit the original because they didn't think a book over 1000 pages would sell. It's hard for me to say how long it will take for you to read; I read it in about 8 days. In my opinion it is King's best novel.

kfOpbbCyaa	I would say that faith is the motivating factor behind the actions of Corrie ten Boom and her family throughout the book.<br>  <br>  For instance, it was because of his faith and acting on that faith that Corrie's father originally sheltered the Jewish people and saved as many of them as he could from the Nazis. (A part of I Corinthians 13:2-"...have such absolute faith that I can remove mountains, but am destitute of Love, I am nothing.") Her father took to heart the fact that faith without love means nothing, and love told him to do what was right and try to help those being persecuted.<br>  <br>  It was faith that gave Corrie and her sister the courage to carry on through all the humiliations and deprivations of the concentration camp.<br>  <br>  It was faith that gave Corrie's sister the ability to face her death bravely and with forgiveness.<br>  <br>  It was also faith that enabled Corrie to forgive the very people who betrayed and imprisoned her family.<br>  <br>  Though it has been a long time since I read the book, this is my recollection of how faith tied into the story and was the underlying cause of all the strength and courage and good done by Corrie and her family.|`|4Xvyq6GNaa	Faith is an immensely large part of the book. Corrie Ten Boom was a very religious person, as was her entire family.  They are constantly praying, and they bring God into nearly every aspect of their lives.  For example, when Corrie discovers that her crush is engaged to another woman, she realizes that God must have meant for her to lead a single life.  Also, throughout the book they constantly plea to/pray to/talk to/thank God for the various occurences in their lives.  Throughout the entire novel, through all of her trials, Corrie never loses faith.

Hey, you might even surprise yourself at the end of your senior year in high school and find that you're a more enlightened person for it. Not only that, but when you get to college and the real world, what are you going to talk to people about? TV? Who Paris is sleeping with? No, sorry. Adults like to talk about real topics. You're doing a great disservice to yourself by not doing your homework. You're not allowing your personality to grow.

esGjbQrSaa	First of all, the bombings had dramatic economic effects on the cities. America did have policies such as 'the Marshall Plan' that offered financial aid to countries who no longer opposed the US. However, as with most governmental aid, strings were attached and the US would have gained trade benefits out of the deal too. <br>  <br>  I find one of the best ways to describe how the cities recovered is this. If you burn down a forest, you will get devastation of the habitats that live there but in time the forest will grow back greater than before. <br>  <br>  In Nagasawki especially, when the rebuild began, new buildings and technlogies were introduced to help rebuild the city. You may also consider natural economic cycles and whether Japan just experienced a large economic boom as some countries did a few years after wars.|`|UzFWLTquaa	Yea I don't know who you heard that from but its not very accurate.  After Japan was bombed Japan was completely devastated so General MacArthur came in and tried to take down the zaibatsu businesses in Japan but he assisted in dispersing education and and law enforcement throughout Japan.  During this time of American influence in Japan there were Christian influences forcing their way in, Japan was highly defensive and angered by this.  Japan during this time was almost completely anti-Christian.  After WWII Japan basically vowed to never be involved in war again and its army is purely for defense.  In 1952 Japan officially signed a peace treaty with the US to ensure that they would never have a future conflict.  After the Korean War Japan's economy flourished and as a result of this the living standards rose dramatically as did its stability, societal changes, and pollution.  Because of Japan's economic boom it was able to create advanced technology and their technology became Japan's primary resource, with success from Japan's technological advance Japan was able to drastically improve its environmental influence over time.  <br>  <br>  The man who made the Atomic Bomb said right after it hit Japan "I am death...".  America was stupid and killed innocent people to scare Japan into surrendering, I mean Japan was extremely messed up before all that (the Japanese were constantly rampaging across Asia to gain land and they did it in the most vicious and gory ways) but using that kind of power which would also kill the innocent was not a good idea.  Eventually it resulted in Japan's success as a nation but America only triggered a change, they definitely didn't do it on purpose.|`|5c9d5f5ba969f07d8f9e8e3aa0985cbbaa	You are right... total BS.  America did help rebuild Japan and set it on its course to becoming an economic power house.  Also, Japan didn't have to spend money on military because it could only have a reserve military and not a full blown one due to the treaty that ended WWII.  But that is good because Japan is still one of America's strongest allies.<br>  By building them up, they didn't become a future threat like Germany after WWI.|`|RLQPWkXCaa	First, the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were atomic bombs, not nuclear bombs. <br>  <br>  But, yes, after WWII, America occupied Japan, like they are doing now to Iraq, but without the insurgents. They forced the Japanese to create a constitution, formed a new government and set it on its way. No one expected Japan to be anything. <br>  <br>  Then the Communist North Korea invaded South Korea, which America had agreed to defend, and set off the Korean war in 1950. Japan was the nearest free country to South Korea, so US troops used the area for supplies, and Japanese manufacturers got a boost in demand. This was the beginning of 30 years of economic growth, and became known as the Japanese Miracle. <br>  <br>  So, yes, the US bombed Japan and then rebuilt it, and it would be fair to say that more good has been done than bad.

Since the 4th century, waves of people had come from the east toward Europe.  The Huns, the Germanic tribes, the Mongols and the Turkic Ottoman people.  At that time there were also Muslim kingdoms in Spain, with strong connections to North Africa.  There is a good chance that settlers would come from those two areas.  The Turkic/Ottoman people were actively expanding into Eastern Europe and the Balkans at that time, and without resistance would probably have continued their expansion.

imKCvvFKaa	I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU!<br>  <br>  im a huge romance fanatic and a vampire fanatic, no one bigger than me! it's a disgrace to both romance and vampires.! don't even get me started! bella is needy, edward controlling, abusive and creepy, bella commits suicide just to be with edward? he watches her sleep and stalks her and the kiss? COME ON! NOT ROMANCE! vampires sparkle, are veggies(animal blood), and only 4 have powers? WTF! NOT VAMPIRES! she might as well used guppies! There aren't really any villans, the fight only last for like 3 minutes, no action or horror. when i heard that it was about a vampire and a human girl you know? i thought it was gonna be actionpacked and tuff, bt it turned out to be sappy and long!<br>  "I was looking down. Then i looked up too see him. He was not looking back. After a while of staring, I started to take to my friend. Later, i looked at him again. This time, he was looking back and he looked angry. i quickly looked down. after a minute, i allowed myself too steal another glance. he still looked ferocious. as i was thinking, my friend told me he was staring at me. when i looked at him again, he looked amused this time. next class was biology." AND SO THE WHOLE FRIGGIN THING CONTINUES LIKE THAT. i try to keep an open mind and try out books, but 100 pages of that nonsense was outrageous.<br>  <br>  - Bella is pathetic. She is so desperate for love that she's willing to give up her family and everything to be with Edward.<br>  <br>  <br>  - The author tied everything together with big, random adjectives that most of the time didn't even fit. <br>  <br>  - It was so long, yet nothing happened. All those pages and nothing special happened until the huge, predictable fight scene at the end.<br>  <br>  -There's too much sickly sweet syrupy romance. And it's only skin deep. She likes him 'cuz he's hot. He likes her 'cuz she's...well, I'm not quite sure why he likes her actually... She smells good?<br>  <br>  -Edward is a stalker and stupid Bella finds that romantic.<br>  <br>  -Bella is a friggin' pansy. Girl needs to grow a backbone and stop waitin' around for everybody else to come save her.<br>  <br>  -The conflict, which lasts for a grand total of 70 pages (out of, like, 500), is resolved in time for Bella's prom! Happy super fun time!|`|mmD4MEnGaa	I hate the style that book is written in. The author is horrible at writing. Her main plot/climax is at the end of the book.

62gbm2gbaa	The US involvement in world war 2 was an enormous factor in determining the outcome of the war. As the US were aware of the war quite a while before they were involved, they had a great deal of time to plan for the war, and further extend their technology. So when they did finally enter the war, the US's technology was far beyond any other country so the US had a detrimental effect on the axis nations. With the new allied boost, the allies were ow capable of making the big push into Europe and the far east which the allies were incapable of doing before. In the pacific, the US's large number of boats were able to penetrate the Japanese fleet. I don't believe the US were the sole reason that the allies won world war 2 but I do believe they definitely quickened the war, and saved a lot of other allied people's lives. The invention of the nuclear bomb was US driven which saved countless lives from having to invade Japan.
AA10729675	In Athens, children were raised as per our standards.  They could play, they could be with their parents.  In Sparta, children were removed from their mothers and they have to live like in camps, military camps, all the time.  They were severely disciplined and according to ancient Greek texts, they had to steal to be able to eat something.  They had to go to fields and steal what they could: fruit, vegetables, animals.  They were barely clothed.  They had to prove they were fit to defend their city which was the only Greek city without ramparts.  In other words, they had no childhood.|`|9P0r7Qbaaa	In Athens, you had the freedom to choose a career to pursue. You could be a philosopher, politician, or an architect just to name a few examples. In Sparta, you would strictly be involved in military affairs. For the children, this affected their lives because either they would be doing a career of their choice or be participating in the army.

Ftkr9jqYaa	Eliza Hart was born August 11, 1807 to Levi Hart and Martha Hart (they were first cousins) in Kensington, Connecticut. In 1820 the family moved to Oneida County, New York. She was introduced to Henry Harmon Spalding (b. Bath, NY 1803 - d. August 3, 1874, Lapwai, Idaho) through a mutual acquaintance who said that Henry "wanted to correspond with a young lady." They were pen pals for about a year, and the relationship quickly deepened after they met in the fall of 1831. She was as keen for missionary work as he was. They married October 13, 1833 in Hudson, New York.  After crossing the Rockies, she died in the Willamette Valley of Oregon on January 7, 1851, and was buried in Brownsville, OR.  Henry Spalding later married Rachel Smith Griffin, the sister-in-law of a fellow missionary, on May 15, 1853.

One Constitution?<br>  <br>  Whenever Americans claim fundamental rights they call upon the Bill of Rights (which, as 'fergamon' has stated, is part of the American Constitution). And that is because Americans consider that the Bill of Rights regulates Human Rights for Americans. We don't compare them, we simply give for granted that the Bill of Right deal with human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, or for that matter the concept of human rights itself, are seen by Americans as fundamental rights for foreign countries. Hardly ever mentioned for domestic conflicts.<br>  <br>  This is an expression of ethnocentrism similar to the one that leads you to say "the constitution" as if no other country had "a Constitution" as if there were no British, no Australians, no Indians reading your question.

mO1s4pMgaa	Evermore by Alyson Noel<br>  Ever was a normal high school girl living a pretty good life. But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?<br>  <br>  I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more.

But one of the things that stands out about her, and it is not positive, she is changing who the real Jesus Christ of the bible is.  She says she is Christian, but she is changing her opinion of God because she did not like to hear her pastor say that God was a jealous God, so she searched out New Age thinking gurus to agree with and promoted their books on her show.  <br>  <br>  If you go to the Moody Church’s web site you can order their book that explains what she believes now.  I just got my book yesterday and I could not put it down and finished it today.  It amazes me but this is how cults start.  Someone, who does not agree with doctrine in the bible, then begins to change what it is, and she does not even have a doctrine in theology.<br>  <br>  The book was written by: Dr. Erwin W.

swlqQ1mYaa	Do you know exactly how expansive question 1 is?! I wrote about five essays on those topics, each at least two or three pages long, during tests!<br>  <br>  First of all, it's impossible to summarize the entire of the Tokugawa Period - it's way too long. Not that that's a problem, since most people aren't interested in what happened in between. Just mostly the beginning and the end. Names you might want to remember are Tokugawa Tsunayoshi (5th shogun) and Tokugawa Yoshimune (8th shogun). Tsunayoshi was very religious, believing his forefathers' success to have been due to good behavior during the Sengoku Period; this connected to his ideas about mistreating animals, particularly dogs. He was also the shogun at the time of the Forty-Seven Ronin. Yoshimune is generally known as the idiosyncratic example of an excellent shogun in the middle of the period; he revised the government and allowed it to continue functioning properly.<br>  <br>  Christianity had been abolished from 1643 because of the conflict feared with bushido. The fault for this is placed on the Franciscans rather than the Jesuits, since the Jesuits converted top-down but the daimyo they explained to didn't really bother to learn, while the Franciscans worked to convince peasants of this new way of thinking. Yearly checks were done for Christian converts, forcing every single member of the population to step on a picture of Jesus or Mary. (This resulted in very accurate census data.) However, hidden Christians still worshipped secretly, without Bibles and disguising Christian figures in small statues of Buddha, etc. This was especially true in Nagasaki, where foreign influence was relatively strong and where there was no resident daimyo. (Nagasaki belonged to the shogunate.)<br>  <br>  Dutch, not Portuguese, were allowed continued trade rights - as were the British, who didn't want it - because they were Protestant. The Tokugawa shoguns only thought that Christianity was a threat. They were limited to the tiny island of Dejima, in Nagasaki, when they came to trade. Also, their trade goods were limited to things that had absolutely no connection to Christianity. For example, books were brought in, but the first page was ripped out because the year it was published was the year AD (Anno Domini).<br>  <br>  Dependence on Chinese traditions would probably involve the four-class system (shi-no-ko-sho), despite its failings, especially toward the end of the period. By the end of the Tokugawa Period, social and economical changes were stirring up unrest. Shi (warriors), who were the social elite, were very poor due to government policies such as sankin kotai and living in the capital. Often they borrowed money from merchants, or requisitioned items without paying. On the other hand, sho (tradesmen) grew increasingly rich from the business daimyo and samurai were required to do with them. However, in an attempt to keep them down in their position, the bakufu issued many edicts preventing merchants from showing or using their wealth.<br>  <br>  And now my fingers are tired, so that's the brief overview. There's more where that came from, naturally.|`|KV9iJyjqaa	2. by themselves(civil war), by Western European Crusaders, by Crusader states
3Wxx2FPkaa	Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address on March 4, 1865, at the start of his second term as President of the United States. At a time when victory over the secessionists in the American Civil War was within days and slavery was near an end, Lincoln did not speak of happiness, but of sadness. Some see this speech as a defense of his pragmatic approach to Reconstruction, in which he sought to avoid harsh treatment of the defeated South by reminding his listeners of how wrong both sides had been in imagining what lay before them when the war began four years earlier. Lincoln balanced that rejection of triumphalism, however, with a recognition of the unmistakable evil of slavery, which he described in the most concrete terms possible. Unbeknownst to him, John Wilkes Booth, David Herold, George Atzerodt, Lewis Paine, John Surratt and Edmund Spangler, a few of the conspirators involved with his assassination were present in the crowd at the inauguration. It is inscribed, along with the Gettysburg Address, in the Lincoln Memorial.<br>  <br>  Lincoln Address:<br>  Fellow Countrymen:<br>  <br>  At this second appearing to take the oath of the Presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.<br>  <br>  On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war—seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish. And the war came.<br>  <br>  One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. 'Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.' If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said 'the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether'.<br>  <br>  With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan – to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.<br>  <br>  The clause in the last paragraph, "to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan," was later adopted by the Veterans Administration (now the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs) as its mission statement.

54aea8f9c5941d9b20207a96ff5abb64aa	I slept 'till noon [no school!], then spent the outline of my day laying in bed on my laptop. The majority of the time online, though, was spent dressing my avatars on the various websites I use up in red, white, and blue; trying to spread the holiday spirit. Most people don't see President's Day as a holiday, much less anything important, and don't see the true meaning. They just see it as a regular day off from school, or a regular day in school, or a regular day on or off work.

You have this boy and he likes sparkly things and pink. Girl things to be precise. The mother is protective of him, though slightly concerned about his taste in apparel.

He does not care about the meaning other people have assigned to them (example: pink is for girls and blue is for boys).

wEEOvu5Waa	If you dont mind tragic love stories Id say go with The Pact by Jodi Picoult. Pretty sure I spelt her last name wrong though >.>|`|iG6ksSpHaa	Any books by Jane Austen. Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility are my favorites of hers.|`|mO1s4pMgaa	Evermore by Alyson Noel<br>  Ever was a normal high school girl living a pretty good life. But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?<br>  <br>  I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more.

swlqQ1mYaa	1. The rule of fascism is traditionally described as right-wing. Often, it is a right-wing reaction to a left-wing stimulus (most obviously, communism) in the country, or nearby. However, different fascist rulers have ruled in different ways.<br>  <br>  2. Examples: Both Hitler and Mussolini were fascist rulers. But they came to power in completely different ways! Hitler manipulated the system until he reached the top - then he changed the government. But Mussolini ignored the system and basically took control through military power.<br>  <br>  3. Because fascism tends to be a reaction to other types of government or thinking, it lacks specific characteristics. In order to analyze fascism properly, you have to choose the fascism of a certain leader.|`|CTSYw8yaaa	I can not answer your question,but If I were you I would do google search for the origins of Fascism.
Sky9MrdCaa	omg i get this problem all the time (especially on my pinky toes) but what helps me is that i wrap my toe(s) or wherever with... da da da.. medical tape. seriously. cover the blister prone areas before going on pointe to stop the rubbing that causes them.  <br>  you could also just go with blister bandaids or any other type of toe tape. The best thing is to prevent them rather than deal with them (of course this is not 100% possible, so if blisters do occur, you can soak your feet in epsom salt)<br>  however, there may be a bigger problem. make sure your shoes are the right lenght and width. if they're not, that could be causing your foot to slide every time you go on pointe then off pointe. <br>  good luck :)|`|yDB2EUbDaa	is it from your pointe shoes? well i would think it would be but anyway...  add extra protection to the "hot spots" when going en pointe they have blister band aids at CVS that help too. if you really wanna pop them it feels soooo much better but you will get scars from it that last for a long time and its probably really bad for you some how. as for a foot cream i just stick my feet in hot salty water after class. It helps allot!<br>  I hope i helped!<br>  <br>  P.S. maybe you should try different pointe shoes? just a suggestion if you LOVE your shoes keep them and just deal with the blisters but if you want to get other ones maybe ty a different style or shank strength or something!
yvyewZrWaa	I think "North and South" or "Cranford" might be easier to critique because they deal with bigger issues - industrialization, religion, change in general. "North and South" will probably have more in the way of information because you could discuss how the book illustrates early unions, poverty in industrial towns, the development of capitalism, and yet remains fairly objective. You could work a lot of history into your paper if you talk about either of these novels, discussing the role of women during the Industrial Revolution, both in rural and urban environments, in addition to the aforementioned topics. <br>  <br>  Good luck on your project!
ABhmJepFaa	This is the philosophy section!!!!!
1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	The fact of the matter is that there isn't just ONE pacifism.  There are different pacifistic movements who have different motivations for their pacifism, different objectives, and different degrees of strictness.    There are those, for example, who argue that you should abstain from violence because it has a negative effect on yourself (some Buddhists, for example).  In becoming a person who commits violence, even for the most noble of reasons, you will have to defile yourself perhaps permanently.  As they say, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions.  A 'just war' to such a person is just a greater temptation to stray from the ethically superior path.    On the other hand, there are those who just view violence as a generally unproductive way of solving problems (Ghandi's political followers might good examples).  Oppressors are probably BEST able to deal with violent counterattacks; by reacting violently you play to their expectations and their strength.  And though they would strongly advocate other means of resistance, even these have their limits:  some conquerors have no problem with wiping out every opposing living thing.  So although they would stress rather strongly the point of trying all other means, a practical pacifist might still accept that sometimes there simply is no other choice if you want to survive.    So what it all really boils down to is what KIND of pacifism we're talking about.  If the motivations and results align, then even war might not be completely incompatible.|`|qDYzdz5daa	Depends on what kind of pacifism you're talking about, whether the pacifist is "I don't want to fight, but I will if you force me" or "I won't fight, under any circumstances."      The article you use points to Pacifism as an "alternative" to the Just War.  That would seem to suggest that pacifists would not see it as compatible.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	No, not "compatible" at all. A just war is every war that has ever been fought. The "just war" is any that seems just, and every war has been seen that way by enough people obviously or else they wouldn't have been started. Violence in NOT immoral, not in the least or in any way conceivable. The mind decides what is moral and the mind can only decide from it's own information. There is no inherent morality in anything. It's like the Bill of Rights, by telling us what rights we can have they eliminate all other rights. Many horrible things have been done in the name of peace.    No one truly wants peace, they want what peace offers to us. Obama's "Strength thru Peace" might as well have come out of a Hitler speech.|`|AA11550519	Pacifism isn't Pussyfism! Pacifism is where you'd much rather live and let live, and simply shun those you dislike.   But no existing society is pacifist when its borders are disrespected. Any society that didn't defend it's rights was quickly conquered by a more assertive one.     You have to draw a line in the sand SOMEWHERE!|`|CVqj8J4taa	The Just War theory is, seemingly, incompatible with pacifism.  The greatest incompatibility would exist in the Jus ad bellum criterion of "last resort."  There's no way to justify that you have exhausted all possible peaceful measures?  "But we've talked to them and they still said they'd blow us up! Can we attack them yet?"  Have you talked to them again?  How do you justify going to war without trying all peaceful measures AGAIN?    It's widely argued by pacifists that under Just War theory, no war has ever been just.  This conflicts with our historic intuition to recognize necessary wars that we would, almost universally, call just.  This, to me, says that Just War is not a perfect military ethics doctrine.

05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	Her family saw her. Since she died 3.2 million years ago, the chances of their being alive today is slim.<br>  <br>  From<br>  <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/specimen.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/spe...</a><br>  <br>  "Lucy", Australopithecus afarensis<br>  Discovered by Donald Johanson and Tom Gray in 1974 at Hadar in Ethiopia (Johanson and Edey 1981; Johanson and Taieb 1976). Its age is about 3.2 million years. Lucy was an adult female of about 25 years. About 40% of her skeleton was found, and her pelvis, femur (the upper leg bone) and tibia show her to have been bipedal. She was about 107 cm (3'6") tall (small for her species) and about 28 kg (62 lbs) in weight.<br>  =============<br>  <br>  Note "40%". That is just under half, if your math skills are rusty.<br>  <br>  Your arguments would be more respected if you put your academic qualifications in as sources; a Ph D. in biology would be an example.<br>  <br>  If you wanted to argue against evolution, here is a little something extra for you, what the Cajuns call "lagniappe", like the free cookie the baker gives the kids when Mom buys a big birthday cake:<br>  <br>  Back in 1776, monarchists (Monarchists are people who want to be ruled by a king or queen, not butterfly fanciers.) argued against democracy as a form of government. They said it was absurd to believe that "All men are created equal" because anyone could see men came in different heights, weights and colors. Case closed.<br>  <br>  My point is not about democracy. It is about debate. Before you argue about something, you should understand it. If you don't understand it, you'll look foolish. <br>  <br>  One night on the "Saturday Night Live" TV show, Gilda Radner argued vehemently against the "Deaf Penalty", instead of the "Death Penalty". She looked absurd and we all laughed until the beer came out our noses, which was what she wanted. You don't want people to laugh at you.<br>  <br>  In a serious debate, you should understand the other side. Note that I didn't say "Believe". Understanding is not the same as believing. If you were to study 20th century European Political history, you would have to understand several forms of government: communism (the USSR), fascism (Germany, Italy), socialism (Lots of countries), socialist democracy, capitalistic democracy and constitutional monarchy. You would not believe in all of them; you COULD not believe in all of them at once. If you tried, your head would explode. You would, however, have to understand their basic concepts. <br>  <br>  If you were to study comparative religion, you would have to understand what Jews, Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Taoists and Confucians believe. You would not have to convert to a new religion every week, but you would have to understand the other ones. You would not get very far in your studies if you dismissed all the other ones as "wrong". They believe their path is the right one just as strongly as you believe your path is the right one.<br>  <br>  99.99% of the biologists alive today believe that species evolve, and that the theory of evolution is the best explanation we have for the diversity of life.  Christian biologists, Jewish biologists, Muslim biologists, Hindu biologists, Buddhist biologists; Australian, Bolivian and Chinese biologists; they believe it is the best explanation. Yes, it is only a theory. Planetary motion - the theory that the earth went around the sun, not vice versa - was only a theory for a long time. Some people still don't believe it.<br>  <br>  If you are truly curious, ask your minister to give you a short, reasoned explanation of evolution. Tell him you don't want to believe it, of course; you just want to understand it. If he says he can't because it is wrong, he is as ignorant as those monarchists I mentioned above.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Lucy isn't a tooth.  She is a full person.  Whether or not you believe the scientists that she is real and not a fake mummy is up to you.  I believe them.|`|o3sYIdOzaa	I saw Lucy in the Pacific Science Center in Seattle just last month.  I guarantee you I am as human as you and am very much alive.  A number of other humans saw her at the same time.  She is currently on a six year exhibition tour of the US. for any other humans who might want to see her.  <br>  <br>  The first human (Homo Sapiens) who saw her was American anthropologist Donald Johanson in 1974.  Johanson found not one tooth, but 47 bones, nearly 40% of a hominid who lived about 3.2 million years ago in the Afar Depression in Ethiopia.  Homo Sapiens evolved about 400,000 years ago, but I doubt that any of them saw Lucy alive or dead at that time, nor did anyone go back in time. <br>  <br>  No she was not a fraud, and no there was no pig.  She was an entirely new species of human ancestor, Australopithecus afarensis.  They called her Lucy for the Beatles song which was apparently the favorite song of someone in the camp and was played constantly and loudly.  They have since found over 360 skeletons and partial skeletons of Australopithecus afarensis, 216 of them were found at that site.<br>  <br>  We have the fossils, we win.|`|MbaP0u6iaa	Your memory certainly does fail you, big-time.

People wrote stories about best friends who like the same guy and he chooses the one that wins something. Then it turns out that he's a jerk and the best friends are friends again. You get what i'm saying? Put more excitement to it. One of the friends has a abusive father and she doesn't like to talk about it or there's just one girl who likes the guy and doesn't show it because she doesn't want to get hurt like before. It's a good plot but there is a lot of stories like that one. Be more creative. Good luck.|`|tMkjsYCcaa	I love it!! Absolutely Love it!!! :  -  D|`|AA10981338	sounds pretty good.
XxILKutWaa	First off, it's hard to say without seeing you. You could be someone with naturally incredible technique or someone who needs a bit more work. That said, I'll try and explain as best I can!<br>  <br>  To be entirely honest, 90 minutes a week is not enough for really any qualified ballet teacher to consider putting you en pointe. Why is this? Taking a minimum of three classes (270 minutes) a week ensures that you are committed and responsible as well as working CONSISTENTLY to build your strength and technique.<br>  <br>  The reason you need very strong technique for pointe is that any minor problem you have on flat will be amplified and even more injurious en pointe. If you sickle slightly in flat slippers, you will have some issues, but may not be in pain. Sickle in pointe shoes and you could end up tearing a ligament in one class. As such, committing to more classes per week (again, I recommend three minimum) ensures that the student is building consistent technique and working often enough to strengthen her muscles and alignment to keep injury risks to a minimum, both en pointe and off.<br>  <br>  In all honesty, I would ask your teacher. See if he/she can't work with your schedule and perhaps do private lessons a couple times a week. Also ask what exercises you may be able to do at home to improve your technique and strengthen/lengthen your muscles. <br>  <br>  In terms of ever going en pointe, I would say it's absolutely possible! A little more hard work and I'm sure you'll get there. Good luck! :)|`|ChyqsJ6Zaa	the teacher will decide when you are ready.<br>  it really depends on how strong your foot is and especially your ankle strength. <br>  i would say take a prepointe class because that is what i did and my teacher had us all start around the same time and we're all doing pretty well.<br>  i would say in 2-3 years, maybe just 2 years but not soon.<br>  sorry, but you really need to be strong to go up and its taken me 11 years to get here, well i started pointe after 9-10 years.<br>  dont worry , you'll get there. it just takes time, and patience. but have faith. trust me, you'll be glad you were well prepared for pointe.|`|VQLJrTKCaa	well...there are so many varying opinions on this! my friend's studio lets girls go en pointe even though they only take 45 minutes a week and aren't all that good. many of them have danced less than you have...this distresses me greatly (lol) my current studio requires that a student takes at least 3 2-hour ballet classes, are at least 11 1/2 years old, and have approval from the ballet mistress. i think that this is a better approach to putting girls in pointe shoes (not to discourage you though!) talk to your teacher! (but don't phrase it as "can i go en pointe?!!" ask what you can do to strengthen your feet in preparation for pointe work. this way you can display that you have a mature approach to the topic)<br>  <br>  good luck and happy dancing!

AA11635601	One night at 3:30 in the morning, the fire alarm went off and I and a dozen others donned our gear and raced off to find a house on fire with people trapped.  Working with tremendous speed, strength, skill, and knowledge, and having the right equipment, we were able to save the people and much of the house.  We worked like dogs until we vomited in the heat or fell to the ground exhausted.  Our ability to do that was a result of months and years of recurring training, maintenance of our equipment, practice, and dedication.  We were glad to do it, glad to be of service.    The woman's friend came roaring up in a car and they embraced  and wept, standing among the many of us spread out on the ground, panting and sweating, and the neighbor said thank God you're ok.|`|5XvItyDFaa	i really hope that god was using his time better that helping you. i hope that god was in africa, or the middle east trying to resolve the conflict not giving you success.|`|AA11313555	This completely up to you to determine, each individual is spiritual in their own way. I personally believe that God is responsible for everything that happens to me. As far as looking at situations as good or bad, maybe you should avoid this. Simply look at each situation as an experience.|`|ji7gqCWxaa	if God is to blame for both, your success and failure, then where is the choice he has given you? where is the control over what you do?  God did not make your success, he helped you with it. when it comes to failure, it is not that God made it neither, neither did he help in making it happen, but he simply let it happen and did not intervene due to his plan for you. Mostly bad things happen and we see them as bad, and eventually, later in the future, we realize that it happened for a reason, a good reason.|`|xKLJxbjaaa	Let me get this straight. Hmm, i am God, let me see what i can do.  I'll let this guy get the job he's always wanted and i'll let these people over here die of famine and disease.

You are given choices and when you make the best of them it is ok to be proud. When we make mistakes, we have to know that it is our fault and learn to correct them. If God was responsible for every action in our lives, then there would be no point in living them.|`|9CN0ZvAVaa	No, you are responsible, whether you are religious or not, physically you are responsible..you have the control over our life, not God.

It is completely illogical.    If u can thank him for the sunshine, u can blame him for the rain|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Whatever you believe it to be is what it is. God exists if you believe he does, and doesn't if you don't care. Assigning blame is a compulsive thing we humans do, but does not get us anywhere unless it helps us ignore something. Assigning blame and expecting someone else to take care of it, is bullshit. The way I think about it is, we never chose a single thing, but we are completely responsible for everything and everyone around us.|`|17EV9uuLaa	You are made in God's image so he does not have to take the blame for your success or failure. The onus lies squarely on you.|`|qEYYHNyyaa	The truth is gods do not exist. The lack of evidence of gods is the very definition of non-existence. The contradiction of your thank, blame example is just another example.
VCc77ZCoaa	It's a riddle that people have been trying to solve for years.  I suppose you could enter in any "answer" to the riddle that makes sense to you, and that is the answer.  However, popular theories on the answer to this particular riddle are "love" and "poetry," but neither have been proven.  One thing is clear, the answer is not "nature" as in Mother Nature.  Rather, the "nature" is eluding to the nature OF a something (the answer).<br>  <br>  Things to think about when analyzing this poem are:<br>  1.  "It" is used, instead of a gender.  Many things in society are given genders (aka boats are usually female) but this "it" is without gender<br>  2.  The "It" is difficult to tie down to a description.  Instead, it is described by things that are not (fashionless, phraseless, dateless, etc.)<br>  3.  There is a passage of time, but this "it" does not necessarily have a mortal end (there are everlasting clocks but it is only noon [halfway point] and it is dateless)<br>  4.  The "it" is personified and personified (private and best but fashionless and phraseless)<br>  5.  The "it" is like nature, but it still overpowers nature (stirs the proudest trees, beats time, etc).<br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|yJCdLNHwaa	One thing comes to mind.<br>  The wind.<br>  It is light and you can see the light through it.<br>  It is delightful, especially on a hot day.<br>  It is like the bee, always wafting through the air.<br>  It is dateless, be cause the wind has no mate.<br>  It is a melody, because it whistles. It can make wind chimes move.<br>  It is like the woods, because it will be around until time stands still.<br>  It is private like the breeze, because it never comes in unless you open the door.<br>  It is phrase-less, because it utters not words, but you can hear it when it stirs.<br>  It is like the morning, crisp and clear.<br>  It is best when the raging storm dies down.<br>  She could have been listening to the wind and decided to write this poem. By the time she finished it the time was Noon.

q3KCDrMAaa	Keep it historical. And yes, it's realistic. I think it's a great story line.<br>  <br>  Earlier in the 1900's (and mid to late 1800's) black women (concert singers) traveled overseas to perform since there was little work offered for them in America. However, I am sure there were women who may have played instruments. Look it up....<br>  <br>  Try to find a real historical people to pattern your characters after. Read up on several people each so that you can bring life to the characters. That helps a lot.<br>  <br>  Do lots of research before you start writing...<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  There was a woman... I can't FOR THE LIFE OF ME remember her name, but she played with a band in the 1920's of all men. She was black. I only remember the picture of her at the piano with the band surrounding her... (If I remember, I will try to look it up in that book tonight and put it here...)|`|AA11937656	Unless you are VERY familiar with every detail of the historical setting -OR- you are willing to do extensive research --  It would be better for you to write in the historical/cultural context that is familiar to you.<br>  Too many anachronisms would spoil your story.|`|0rgKBcgpaa	That sounds like a very good book! i would totally read it!!!

Also, interracial dating may not have been allowed, as black people were still considered less than white people. You may want to look into this before you start writing your story.<br>  <br>  Make sure you get your facts straight about that time!<br>  <br>  This plot sounds great, I would most definitely read it even though I rarely read historical fiction.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.<br>  :)|`|AA11264943	I know that in the 20's and 30's, when professional boxing was the biggest sport, but there was still alot of segregation.

I6dcRgD6aa	For me it is starting off the day balanced. I would like to do this better but to have a routine. One thing I do is drink a bottle of water when I wake up cause I don't drink any water late at night. The meditation/prayer help. I exercise when I am typing on an exercise bike with a shelf for my laptop. I know what I have to do in my life. So clearing out the things that I don't need has been important so I am not overwhelmed but focused on doing things that nurture me. I imagine a line like the one we used to see on the board in school when we learned about positive & negative numbers. If I imagine this & feel life is going off to the negative side I pull myself back to the center which could mean that I stop what I am doing & get silent. If my thoughts are fearful I ask myself what a higher thought would be then I imagine the higher thought bringing me back to balance. I have taken an inventory of my life. I think the people who do the 12 steps but I have never looked into this but you might be able to find out what this inventory is about. I take an inventory of what needs to be done. I know I have to care for my physical self so I have allowed myself to eat healthy with a tiny bit of junk food that I like. I know I need my house clean & orderly so I have a chart that tells me what to take care of each day. Being organized helps me be more balanced.|`|yOK32PM9aa	Don't feed the extreme emotions which take you to highs and lows.

swlqQ1mYaa	Previously, the US was somewhat isolated - from Europe - by the Monroe Doctrine. (Basically, it said that America shouldn't get involved in the messy problems of Europe, because it was the New World and should take advantage of its . . . fresh start.) Interference in World War I effectively ended this policy, paving the way for the US's rise to a full world power.<br>  <br>  There's also the point that the US benefited economically from the war. By not joining the war until 1917, the country was supposed to be neutral, and therefore able to trade with both sides if the materials traded weren't directly related to war (i.e. food, textiles, etc.). Of course this helped them, because other countries were limited in their trading partners by their alliances.<br>  <br>  Finally, the war was not fought on American soil; and they lost relatively fewer men than other major Allied countries because of the time of their entrance into the war. As a result, the US gained enormous prestige as a leading world power despite its minimal losses.|`|66ae92d2cce51274f11213f71597bd09aa	well the US didnt officially become a world power from it but it brought them out of their isolation, blanking on the word. the like nation isolation where its all about the US and not caring about the rest of the world, kinda like being wrapped up in yourself but it was the nation. so WWI was kind of like the US' debut on the world stage as our history calls it, before we were just kinda there not doing much with our self-thinking but that brought the US out more as some"one" with power and stuff. the world power didnt come until WWII

The more auditions you go on, the better you learn to channel your nerves into adrenaline.  Instead of being nervous, you become pumped up for the audition.  Just keep auditioning and both your nerves and technique will get better.|`|rHwE5Rkbaa	You can't.    If you listen to very famous and popular singers and performers, you will hear them all say that they are just as terrified on auditions and performances as they were when they first started.  The only difference is being able to DEAL with the butterflies.    Best bet is mental imagery.  Try thinking about the audition and imagine yourself doing it VERY well - you hit every note and everything works out perfectly.  Imagine the pre-audition lines and the post-audition applause.  Go through the entire thing - and just keep a positive swing on things.  Then, when it comes time for the audition and you feel yourself getting worked up into a tizzy, close your eyes and remember your mental imaging of doing well.    Hopefully this will be enough to help you through.    Good luck.|`|eulMjLtPaa	You can't stop being nervous, but you can deal with it.  As the first poster said, breathing is key.      Two things that help me:    1.  Knowledge that the auditioners really, really want you to do well.  They're looking for someone they can cast, so they're hoping for a good performance.      2.  I look at the physical manifestations of nervousness (shortness of breath, jitters, dry mouth, small peripheral vision), and note that they are the same physical manifestations of being very excited about something.  So instead of saying to myself "I'm so nervous!" I say "I'm so excited!"  It sounds trite, but for me, it really works.|`|4qVXodtnaa	Concentrate on breathing in and breathing out. Breathe in for 5 seconds, hold for 5 seconds, breathe out for 5 seconds.    Worked for me, and I got a distinction in my music exam for controlling my nerves in this way!|`|6ce30766a545694d9f60976802874a8baa	Like the old cliche statement goes, practice makes perfect. I work at a resort where I give tours, sometime in front of a large number of people. At first I was really nervous, I would stumble my words, and you could tell in my tone. But now after a year of doing it all the time, it comes as natural as breathing. I really love my job now.     So you should try rehearsing your material in front of friends and family before you have to do it on stage. Also knowing your material will boost your confidence. Its also a mental thing. You have to put it in your head mentally that you can do this, and that nothing is going to stop you. Like I said, it gets better with time.

PWwKcjwFaa	You have to be confident and convey to strangers that you know what you're doing, while saying you're only a student, so they'll be glad to help. Just be honest and try to read their body language and preempt their questions before it's asked ("no, I won't post it online, it's just for class", etc).    If you fidget too much or are too nervous, they'll pick up on that and won't be as willing to commit their time.    If you're a guy trying to take picture of kids at a park, parents will generally be nervous. If you're a girl, they tend to be a bit more receptive. Just approach adults as if you are about to ask for the time, and tell something nice about them, like why you're photographing them ("Excuse me, I noticed you have a really cool hat, can I photograph you really quick to test out my camera for photography class?")|`|09c748d7fc38fc30c74d3bc44d0ac9feaa	it depends on where you are for the photos...  someplaces do limit photography {depending on what theyre near.. in  my personal experiance, anywhere near a military facility is a BIG nono}    if they tell you to move on, then move on...also, some places you need permits - like our park, you need a permit, so the borough can cover theyre butts, in case of a lawsuit...|`|UHvuGAoOaa	If the police stop you and say no professional photography, tell him that your not a professional.

AA12093196	I think what you're looking for is information about genetic diversity in human populations:  the fact that there's more genetic diversity in African populations compared to non-African, has led to the theory that the human species originated in Africa.  Scientists have been able to speculate when and how certain populations of humans migrated from Africa to other parts of the world, based on genetic diversity in those populations compared to African populations.

kTZevQNHaa	No.   I don't believe that.    I think just feeling good and at peace  in response to the goodness is ample indication that goodness is occurring.  I don't believe we need to feel bad in order to appreciate the benefits of feeling good.    Look at the animal kingdom.They just go about their business without intended malice  beyond simply trying to survive...not malintent therefore not bad ...just being--surviving and that is good.....and humans wiht the capacity of consicience...can do so much better in a world filled with love...that's what we all strive and hope for...good and love and peace and harmony--the ultimate paradise.    Goodness--if just for the purpose of recognizing it and for comparative purposes--to then therefore 'require' badness is not good enough to justify its presence in  our society.    If all was good...all would be harmonious...and the absence of badness would be irrelevant...as would be the need to have it.|`|4e1nRQCUaa	We must have badness in order to perceive goodness.

Z63guoAXaa	You do not have to be born an artist to be a great painter/drawer. Anyone can be an artist because really, as overstated as it sounds, all it takes its lots and lots of practice. Whenever you get the chance, do some quick gestures; try drawing a person's face in under a minute. Yeah, its going to be pretty bad for the first few weeks, maybe even months (I know mine were! And they still aren't perfect), but eventually, your brain will learn that it needs to coordinate your hand so that what you see is translated to the paper. That being said, some people are born with a more natural talent; their brain already is very good at hand-eye coordination. They are usually very good at drawing things they see in their head. This gives the person an advantage, but just because you aren't born that way doesn't mean you can't draw. Practice, practice, practice. Hope that helps!|`|NehnjjQtaa	hello.regards to your question here today. never forget if one has a passion with in your own heart you can become the best of.....any thing your heart desires!!! whether cooking to become a master chef,or airplane pilot,or wood worker,doll maker,toy maker, leather crafts man,..etc.....and never let any one put you down or be little you either!!  at times many adult ed courses offer so many classes in your area so call them to see when the next art classes start up.. as well many local libraries offer so many wonderful books on this subject of your interest .. as well i do belive the dummies series of books may have a book on this subject aswell....so shoot for  the star's.. all the best to you !|`|Cc2Yb9DKaa	I think everyone is born an artist.  We all have a unique way of expressing ourselves that lends itself to art and artistic expression.  The problem is that some people try to be like another artist, which can lead to frustration and self-doubt.  Just express yourself in your own way, with your own style and sensibilities.  You can study the work of other artists for inspiration or learn the basic techniques and methodical approaches to refine your skills, but ultimately, you decide what you want to say and how you want to say it.  Make it fun, and make it interesting and youll do very well.    Art school wont hurt eitheryoull be surprised at how well formal study can improve your skills.  The great artists usually study for years to do what they do.
05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	Ummmmm<br>  <br>  Race is a handy physical description, as in "The lost child is a [white / Black / Asian / Hispanic] male, 10 years, 5'4", 140 pounds, last seen wearing a white T-shirt, blue jeans and sneakers."<br>  <br>  Look in the mirror. If you have light brown skin, slanted eyes and hair as sleek and glossy as a raven's wing, your family is Chinese. Your 2nd great grandfather signed on with HMS "Steadfast" as a cook in Hong Kong, then jumped ship in Dublin to open a restaurant that specialized in Guinness and chow mein. I must have known a dozen guys like that.<br>  <br>  Likewise, if you are about the color of coffee with a lot of cream in it and have a wider nose than your school chums, your great grandfather was an African American who came to Dublin with a traveling jazz orchestra, fell in love with a green-eyed red-haired singer, stayed behind when the band went on to Paris. He opened a restaurant in Dublin that specialized in collard greens and Guinness. I must have known a dozen guys like that, too. <br>  <br>  There are a powerful number of restaurants in Dublin that serve Guinness, black as sin and with a head so firm a mouse can trot across the top without sinking in. Chewy it is, and not for the faint of heart. Lucky for them, the Irish are not faint of heart. Many of them tend to sing when they have had a dozen pints, so it is lucky they sing well, too.<br>  <br>  London is a different story, it being full of English.<br>  <br>  The US Census asked "Race" from 1870 on, when they started counting African Americans. If you can find your transplanted Irishmen there (undoubtedly going to sleep every night with visions of Guiness dancing in their heads) you can sort of see what race they were<br>  <br>  I say "sort of" because mixed race people who could pass for white did so, not being fools. It meant their kids could go to the good schools and they could vote without a lot of hassle.<br>  <br>  Someone who was 1/32nd African and 31/32nds White counted as "Black" under the Jim Crow laws. They don't to my mind, and anyone with that sort of makeup would be tempted to round it off, before the 1960's.|`|7ZeT3Krkaa	If your family is Irish, your race is white.  To be any other race, your grandparents would have been from Asia, or been African-American.  If some of your ancestors were white, and others African-American, you would be bi-racial.<br>  If your great-grandparents lived in the US, you can check some of the old census records; they asked where the respondents were born, and in some years where their parents were born.  That will give you their heritage.  You may be able to go to your public library, and gain access to  a site with census records through them.<br>  If all of your grandparents are of Irish descent, then you would be 100% Irish.  If three were Irish, and one, say, German, you would be 75% Irish and 25% German.  If any of them were mixed, it would be harder to figure the percentage.|`|vZToCRVuaa	send your cheek saliva or whatever to some genealogy centre i forgot the name

(Again, use a scene/act/character)    His view on comedy and if he just added it for the pilgrims that watched his plays? Deeper meanings in the comedies?

Then I would also state that although his life remains a controversial topic with different perspectives and theories, his contribution to the English language, literature, standard plot outlines for films/plays/novels remains prevalent even today, as does the desire to constantly re-create his plays.

HqcH85SMaa	Unhallowed Ground by Gillian White<br>  <br>  On a snowbound February day, when Georgina first saw Furze Pen - a picturesque thatched cottage in a peaceful valley on Dartmoor - she thought it just the place to recover from the recent nightmare of her job in London. True, the cottage was old and isolated, and the neighbours weird and strangely threatening. But Georgie needed to work out her life, and Furze Pen seemed as good as place as any - until the terrors started. There was the lone watcher on the hill - at first she thought it was a scarecrow, so stark and still was it standing - and then the unexplained fire, with the remains of a child's doll smouldeing in the ashes. But there had never been a child at Furze Pen.

AA11712689	As a person with a long military history, personal and family wise, I would have to say YES, I agree with you that the Nazi Wehrmacht uniforms were especially attractive in the military sense. <br>  Arguably the MOST stylish OF the modern uniforms.<br>  <br>  Nazi uniforms looked that good for a reason.<br>  It was ON PURPOSE.<br>  Their look helped recruitment without a doubt.<br>  What little German boy wouldn't want to be in such a fancy, sharp uniform all dressed up and fighting for Germany.<br>  Their uniforms were as much propaganda as everything else they did.<br>  <br>  British and American uniforms were in comparison, flat, one color, undecorated, wrinkled to hell quite easily, baggy, ill fitting, and plain.<br>  <br>  Nazi uniforms were bold, shiny, highly tailored, off-set with different colors like in the collars and sleeve cuffs, broadly decorated, all wore with those high shiny boots. Beautiful craftsmanship.<br>  <br>  They were almost "formal" compared to the Allies uniforms.<br>  <br>  They were supposed to show superiority and power .... even in the tailoring of their clothes.<br>  It certainly made them LOOK sharp as hell even if the men wearing them weren't.<br>  The uniforms PROMOTED an idea.<br>  <br>  Pure propaganda but YES, in the Military sense, they WERE gorgeous uniforms, sharp as hell.... the LAST of the great military costume uniforms.<br>  <br>  I totally get what you are saying as a history buff.<br>  Too bad the uniforms were on the WRONG soldiers and have such a huge stigma attached to them, though greatly justified.<br>  <br>  Such a waste of great tailoring doncha think?|`|2IANlGQ6aa	yessss. they had probably the most stylish war uniforms. but they arent exectly what i would call stylishh.<br>  <br>  i prefer SKINNY JEANS and VANS =P|`|wnkoTEqVaa	I have to say the one thing i like about  German uniforms during world war two was the Sleeve/Breast Eagle. <br>  <br>  I prefer American uniforms though.|`|RXvZvnJHaa	Yeah, they had great looking uniforms.<br>  If you could judge an army by its appearance, the wehrmact would be number one.
OIRI5Ok7aa	Probably because Clytemestra is the complete opposite of Penelope.  She is an example of a "bad" woman who connives and cheats on her husband while he's away, while Penelope is a pinnacle of womanly virtue who stays faithful to her husband, even while she's being constantly pestered and bothered by suitors and goes through many hardships.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Clytemnestra might be Penelope's "foil" - her opposite.    Their circumstances are similar - both are high-born, desirable women waiting for their husbands to come home. But where Clytemnestra betrays her husband, Penelope is ever-faithful.

Ow3O7h4caa	Well, for one thing, I play piano very well but, I majored on the guitar because I found I could be more expressive with all the different techniques available.<br>  You can;t bend notes or finger-tap on a piano but i love to compose on a piano. You get to play bass and melody at the same time and you get a better idea where to head when composing or arranging.<br>  <br>  So, for your question, many guitarist have piano skills for the reasons I mentioned. Take John Lennon. He was always on piano but when touring, he played guitar.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|m9zviqlzaa	I think just about every musician has learned at least the basics on piano. if you take a music theory class, the first instrument you will learn is most likely piano.
SOPRt0Ffaa	Narrative is one of the four basic types of writing: expository, persuasive, narrative, and descriptive. Narrative is simply storytelling. Point of view basically answers the question: whose perspective is the reader getting? First person POV is when the main character in the story tells the events using I, me, my, our, etc. Third person limited is when a character tells what happened insofar as he or she knows what happened, and in third person omniscient (all-knowing), the reader gets to know what every character is doing and thinking because it is like God telling the story. <br>  <br>  To turn your original question around: A narrative may be written in first person.|`|oSsVEXMxaa	Of course. Whether the narrator is "I" or omniscient, it's still a story, so it's still a narrative. Hence the term narrator. :P

True, the cottage was old and isolated, and the neighbours weird and strangely threatening. But Georgie needed to work out her life, and Furze Pen seemed as good as place as any - until the terrors started. There was the lone watcher on the hill - at first she thought it was a scarecrow, so stark and still was it standing - and then the unexplained fire, with the remains of a child's doll smouldeing in the ashes. But there had never been a child at Furze Pen. And as the seasons turned and snow once again blocked off the remote valley, the frightening began in earnest....|`|DJOEV2TDaa	Not sure what age level reading you're at, but if your at Stephen King level, then I'd suggest  Mr. Build   <a href="http://www.EvansKregBooks.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.EvansKregBooks.com.</a><br>  <br>  Its got one of the most unique and odd love relationships I've seen in a book.

ceBTTCPwaa	Herman Melville (August 1, 1819  September 28, 1891) was an American novelist, short story writer, essayist and poet. His first three books gained much attention, though they were not bestsellers by any means, and his popularity declined precipitously after only a few years. By the time of his death he had been almost completely forgotten, but his longest novel, Moby-Dick  largely considered a failure during his lifetime, and most responsible for Melville's fall from favor with the reading public  was recognized in the 20th century as one of the chief literary masterpieces of both American and world literature.    http://www.literaryhistory.com/19thC/Mel...    http://www.melville.org/    http://www.gutenberg.org/author/Herman_M...    http://people.hofstra.edu/faculty/John_L...    http://hermanmelvillepoet.org/    http://theotherpages.org/poems/poem-mn.h...

It's an eye witness account of a man who did everything in his power to commence and hopefully maintain peace with an extremely limited supply of troops because nobody, not even the UN, had listened to him when he warned that a genocide was on its way in the very near future.  He remembers the smells, the sights, the sounds-the horrors of the genocide in Rwanda.  Shortly after this warning, the UN gave only 10% of the troops he had requested and shortly after this warning, the quickest and most efficient slaughtering of the "invalid" racial ethnic group known then and now as the Tutsi by Hutu militants in only the first 100 days.  He describes the atrocities of the genocide as well as his friends-the soldiers under his command-were slaughtered.  Everything I read in this book was so vivid and so gruesomely vibrant, I felt as if I were there in 1993-1994.  And though this man was one of the extraordinary heroes, he's the one that fell into a deep wade of depression in which he attempted to kill himself.  Rwanda-a nation torn by ethnicity, a nation shaken by the horrors of such ruthless genocide that has ripped many a nation into two and reaped its havoc on thousands upon millions of innocent fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, sons, daughters, Godmothers, Godfathers, cousins, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, husbands, and wives.   In this book, Lt-General Romeo Dallaire excels as two things-commending the brave soldiers and everyone who tried to keep peace in Rwanda as well as their loved ones, describing and depicting the atrocious slaughtering of an entire race, and doing what he can to make sure that nothing like this will ever happen again-even though it has.  This book was written by a man whose voice somehow got lost in the mix.  But now is the time to hear him-read his book.  It's informative as it is gruesomely entertaining.  If you read this book, I guarantee you you will not regret it.|`|gaVhPGWhaa	now you see her by jacquelyn mitchard *<br>  mixed bags by melody carlson<br>  stealing bradford by melody carlson<br>  homecoming queen by melody carlson<br>  sisterhood of the traveling pants 1-4 by ann brashares<br>  secrets of my hollywood life by jen calonita *<br>  secrets of my hollywood life: on location by jen calonita *<br>  secrets of my hollywood life: family affairs by jen calonita *<br>  ttyl by lauren myracle *<br>  ttfn by lauren myracle *<br>  l8r, g8r by lauren myracle *<br>  pants on fire by meg cabot<br>  gingerbread by rachel cohn **<br>  shrimp by rachel cohn **<br>  cupcake by rachel cohn **<br>   <br>  <br>  the * is the really good books|`|015n6RfDaa	There's a series called Cirque Du Freak and another series called Lightning Thief.

Often when a nation was defeated in war, those who weren't killed were taken captive to be slaves. Africans had wars, one people against another and many of those defeated were sold to Europeans as slaves, but that was a few hundred years ago. Don't you know of Roman slaves way back in Biblical times? Abram had an Egyptian slave and she bore his first son with her. Jews were slaves to Egypt and Babylon in different times, and in modern times, slaves to the Germans, as were also Poles, Hungarians and other Europeans.

The whole world had slaves up until the 19th century where it was eliminated almost everywhere, usually without a huge, bloody, civil war.<br>  The Bible describes slaves.  The Romans and Chinese had slaves.<br>  The very word "slave" comes from the word "slav" because white Russians were captured and taken into slavery.

e53470e0994050b004790b633a444bd4aa	Thomas Paine's Common Sense book played a part. Paine was a Londoner who hated the King and realized that the real source of tyranny in the British Empire, which caused all the problems in the colonies, was King George himself and not the parliament ministers, as the Americans believed in the beginning. The abuses of the British forces, of course, played a large part, but once the American leaders began realizing that the cause of their problems was the king (a tyrant for life) and not Parliament (whose members could at least be removed), they all the more wished to not be associated with Britain anymore.

AA12016117	I wouldn't say "burnt out" exactly; I haven't read her most recent works.  However, after her first few books I lost a great deal of interest when faced with page after page of her metaphysical ramblings.  I so enjoyed reading her great stories about Lestat, Louis and other main characters, the Talamasca, the nature of vampires and so on - and her excellent research on paintings and history - but I did not want to read about her take on the afterlife and the nature of God and the devil.<br>  <br>  It has rather put me off reading her book about Christ.|`|PR6w9XzAaa	yes.

D19F6m92aa	The Missouri Compromise was no state north of the southern Missouri border would be admitted as a slave state.  The Dread Scott case, the court ruled that Scott was a slave, and could not petition the court.  Living in Minnesota was immaterial.  Slave owners could not be deprived of their property.  The Missouri Compromise, was unconstitutional.  No Territorial legislature could ban slavery.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, it allowed slavery in Kansas, until Kansas was admitted to the union.  It gave legal standing to slave catchers anywhere in the US.
SuLMCvVfaa	I'm really drawn to this poem.  I've never read it before; is it yours or another's you're posting for analysis purposes?  <br>  The structure indicates to me a fractured state of mind, or a fractured, disjointed, messy situation.  It's choppy, and reads choppily, as though the speaker is frequently pausing, to gather thoughts, or because he is choked up.<br>  It's so simply written, and yet it communicates strong charge of emotion, not emotion bubbling over, but restrained, hence the pauses.|`|uhc1MCDzaa	Wow impact!!!!!

I think it's all about the soul, so I would focus on the soul to start with. What do you imagine a soul to look like? An image of the person, like a ghost? A little ball of light? Something else? I'd suggest do some research on souls and see what you come up with. You could also look into spiritual rituals, and see what happens in them, where they generally take place and what is the actual point of the ritual.<br>  <br>  All of that will get you images that you can stick into your book, to show you have been researching. From the images, you can then form your own ideas of how things should be.<br>  <br>  Hope I was of help :) good luck with the project.
ZB9zkbxxaa	Pretty girls in pretty dresses, partying until dawn. Irresistible boys with mischievous smiles and dangerous intentions. White lies, dark secrets, and scandalous hookups. This is Manhattan, 1899.<br>  <br>      Beautiful sisters Elizabeth and Diana Holland rule Manhattan's social scene. Or so it appears. When the girls discover their status among New York City's elite is far from secure, suddenly everyone—from the backstabbing socialite Penelope Hayes, to the debonair bachelor Henry Schoonmaker, to the spiteful maid Lina Broud—threatens<br>      Elizabeth's and Diana's golden future.<br>  <br>      With the fate of the Hollands resting on her shoulders, Elizabeth must choose between family duty and true love. But when her carriage overturns near the East River, the girl whose glittering life lit up the city's gossip pages is swallowed by the rough current. As all of New York grieves, some begin to wonder whether life at the top proved too much for this ethereal beauty, or if, perhaps, someone wanted to see Manhattan's most celebrated daughter disappear...<br>  <br>      In a world of luxury and deception, where appearance matters above everything and breaking the social code means running the risk of being ostracized forever, five teenagers lead dangerously scandalous lives. This thrilling trip to the age of innocence is anything but innocent.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anna Godbersen's debut novel, The Luxe is issued as a YA novel. It's been years since I could be considered a young adult and I have to admit I found this glimpse into the turn of the 19th century teens fascinating. Think Gossip Girl meets the Gilded Age.<br>  <br>  The Luxe is excellent. The characters are well-drawn and the problems facing them compelling and believable. The differences between the sisters lead to a climactic moment that, in retrospect, seem inevitable given their natures and outlook on life.<br>  <br>  The peripheral characters as well add an element of richness to the story. The reader will want to slap the obligatory b****y friend and cheer for the lover from "the wrong side of the tracks."<br>  <br>  I'm looking forward to next spring when the sequel comes out, simply because I was left with a feeling of "what will happen to ____" at the end of this book. I was sorry to reach the end and put it down.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend this not only for young adults, but for those of us who are... ahem... young at heart.|`|AD2e5hLqaa	I thought this series was amazing even though I usually don't read these kind of books.

The problem is that Elizabeth is in love with the stableboy Will and Diana is falling in love with Henry while Elizabeths friend Penelope wants him.

wEEOvu5Waa	Personally, probably not. Just wayyyy to many unbelievable plot turns. Kinda like that TV show 'Lost'. Kinda makes you think, when will it all end? I can understand the molestation part, that bit can and probably does happen. However, im not sure why they would travel to Russia for ballet, France if anything seems like a better place to go. As well as you usually just don't forget a language, especially when you're seven. And if Shelly got news of her fathers death...then the orphanage she was at knew her father...which would have meant she would never had gone to is as legal custody would have given her to her father, or another living member from his side. And the whole random brain cancer?<br>  <br>  A good book is able to make things believable, even if you stretch reality. Like J.K. Rowling. Now, she gave us a school of witchcraft BUT she made it seem possible. She didn't give her students super magical powers, lazer beam eyes and fly with magic wings and bogus stuff like that. She stretched the limits, but kept it realistic.<br>  <br>  Your idea is good, but to many unrealistic plot twists. Instead of Russia, maybe France. France would be more believable, especially for ballet. Keep her language English, but maybe she did learn French. You could do a two sided story where they meat in the end. Have the sisters look for each other after both of their parents die, and show the hardships they went through to find each other. That way its more realistic, but can be dramatic and will show how far someone will go to find their sibling.|`|REgV7fHAaa	you have to many things going on in the story you need to focus on one idea.You need to expand on what heppened during the time they are apart. then go into the coming back together. you ned to go into how they felt at different times in thier lives. like how would you feel if the other half of you were not there any more.

BGIsuNMTaa	I'm really into Martina Cole books, they are stories based in the 60s/70s in the east end. They're usually based on criminals, drug dealers, poverty, prostitution and adoption. They are so interesting because they let you live in a different life all together and see how it really is rather than just what meets the eyes when you see a prositute. <br>  When real life stories come on the tv I always watch them so maybe that. You could do inside prisions, people with diseases such as HIV, murders, prostitutes, teenage pregnancy, children in care things like that. Its interesting because its actually real and people can base their own experiences on it. I cant stand these made up stories about magic cupboards because they aren't real and luvi duvi stories are basically all the same. <br>  Lets face it even if people dont like what I've said everyone can be nosy and curious so will read it for that sheer fact. <br>  Good luck|`|hhBQe6Jdaa	i love to read about something like vampires and stuff...something we don't have is this world...so its interesting and mysteries<br>  <br>  can you help me please ? <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnGRk185eXZSYOtwafibH_7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219195042AAfrYHr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|kV9YT6bSaa	Teen pregnancy.|`|tMkjsYCcaa	Well These two 20 year olds fall in love, they are so much in love they are practicly insebereable, but on tragic winter night, they get into a car accident and the girl looses her memory, so the guy vists her every day and brings her a rose everyday and sooner or later she falls in love with him again ( She has short term memory)|`|Fex51ntIaa	I'd like to read something that makes sense with correct spelling and punctuation.

swlqQ1mYaa	War communism was an economic and political Bolshevik policy instituted during the Russian Civil War. Instead of previous, somewhat liberal policies, this one reverted closer to traditional Marxist communism. Its goal was to obtain enough food to feed the Red Army. It was replaced by the NEP (New Economic Policy) in 1921, because Lenin judged that it wasn't allowing the economy to develop properly. Main points included that land was nationalized - despite Lenin's promise of land to the peasants - and that distribution of resources was centralized in an attempt to secure enough for the army. Discipline was strict in order to enforce these goals.
EZ1cPPvkaa	The actual syntax and some of the wording could use some work, but it's a compelling idea.  I just noticed a few things, like missing commas and misspellings that really distracted from the idea of the story.

Overall, though, nice work.|`|tMkjsYCcaa	Yes it's amazing veary profound, if you don't mind me asking...How old are you...|`|pUWszP1Uaa	I like the idea of the book, but I think you should add some dialogue, or something to create 'white space' for the reader. This is a great start, but I would take out some of the description and slow it all down. Remember, you have a lot of room and time to get it right, and you might as well experiment with it in the early stages. I can imagine a very adventurous and exciting story running in this, but I think you need to work on your 'hook' and holding the reader's' attention in the beginning. A story like this will seem more dramatic and captivating if you lessen the adjectives and just put in a few powerful ones for each line of description. It will save you time and your readers will love you for it. Good luck! I hope you publish something one day! :)|`|NnlL3usKaa	I thought it was very nice. =]
1hvrQYWiaa	The system of government in Russia was absolute monarchy - the Czar ruled the Russian empire as an autocrat,made all the decisions and laws and basically could do as he pleased. Although there was a parliament (the Dumas) it had no real power, and was just a talking shop.<br>   Such a system works well enough if the ruler is strong, able,ruthless or even average. However, Czar Nicholas II was weak and stupid.He had almost lost power to a liberal revolution in 1905 following setbacks in the Russo-Japanese war.His foreign and domestic policies were failures, and Russia was technologically and socially backwards compared to the other European Great Powers.<br>   As WW1 continued and things became worse, the Czar got the blame - another problem with an autocratic system of rule is that when things go wrong there's only one person to blame,  particularly as Nicholas had assumed command of the army in 1916.Additionally, the Czarina was German, and many ordinary Russians thought she was betraying their country to her homeland.<br>   Eventually, the logistics system for both the army and the inhabitants of the big cities broke down. Nicholas was forced to abdicate, and a liberal government under Kerensky took power.<br>   Kerensky's government kept Russia in the war, but by now the whole nation was war weary. The Germans had captured Riga on the Baltic coast and occupied the Ukraine, the major food producing region of western Russia. Promising "peace and bread" Lenin's Bolsheviks stormed the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, seat of the government, and seized power. Due to his promise of 'peace and bread' he had broad popular support, particularly amongst the soldiers and in the cities.<br>   So, overall, it was the disastrous events for Russia during the war that led to the revolution.
BBfIXcI0aa	Of course you become good at musical theatre by becoming a triple threat, but there's more to this whole acting business than movies and musicals. If you're still in school, get involved with your school's drama department - take an acting class, audition for a show. Audition for the community theatres in your area when you can - all it takes is a monologue and some time, and there are millions of questions about that for you to peruse. The only way you'll know if you're good at acting is if you try acting!<br>  <br>  (As far as preparation goes, I would suggest classes, obviously. If you're super serious, I'd pick up either a copy of Stanisklavski's An Actor Prepares, or a commentary on it.)|`|draNVjbkaa	READ:<br>  "ACTING IS EVERYTHING (GOLD EDITION)"-JUDY KERR<br>  <br>  "SO YOU WANT TO BE IN SHOW BUSINESS?"- STEVEN R. STEVENS<br>  <br>  "ACTING TRUTHS AND LIES" (purchased at www.info4actors.com)<br>  <br>  TRAINING<br>  I think the first three classes that you should take before even engaging in a scene study/acting class are: Cold Reading, Commercials, and Improv.<br>  <br>  Why a cold reading class? How do you get the role? By auditioning! Auditioning and acting are two DIFFERENT worlds! In L.A. especially, the majority of your auditions are cold reads. You're lucky if you can get the sides the night before. Cold reading teaches you how to make sense of the script within a short period of time and also with in a limited space (you don't physicalize as much on auditions as you do when actually do the scene). After you get the part, you can always get an acting coach.<br>  <br>  Why commercials? Because those are the money jobs. Build your foundation with commercials so you can afford the best training and materials needed for a successful acting career. Commercials also don't require you to bust out your Meisner or Strasberg techniques. The commercial cds and clients just want to see real people.<br>  <br>  Improv is a must period. It teaches you how to not be self conscious, to use your imagination, and to make bold and quick choices. It also goes great with commercial auditions for a lot of them are improv.<br>  <br>  Stay away from those OVERPRICED "Acting/Modeling Schools" like JRP, John Casablancas, and Barbizon. There are BETTER and more AFFORDABLE schools. Of course you can have those three scammy schools on your resume and get LAUGHED OUT of LA and any other MAJOR market.<br>  <br>  AGENTS<br>  To get an agent, you need to get GREAT headshots, a good resume, and training from the best. These are enough to get you a commercial agent at least. Getting a GOOD theatrical agent (Film/tv) takes longer. Most good theatrical agents won't see you unless you're SAG, have a polished resume, and a demo reel. Commercial agents are more lenient about that. What the best Commercial agents want to see on your resume are good commercial classes, improv, and cold reading.<br>  You can get an agent multiple ways. Here are a few common ways:<br>  -Attend a showcase and impress them<br>  -Mail in an unsealed manilla envelope with a CONCISE coverletter and headshot with the resume stapled on the back. If you have a demoreel include that too.<br>  -Get a referral from a friend who is with the agency that you're interested in<br>  <br>  DON'T<br>  -Email them unless they tell you to. IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Call unless they tell you to. ALSO UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Walk in and ask for a meeting. UNPROFESSIONAL THREE!<br>  -Sign with them if they ask for upfront money, make you take new photos with THEIR photographer, or take THEIR classes. Agent's ONLY make money when you do. Agents usually make 10% on film/tv and commercials and 20% on commercial print<br>  <br>  RESUMES<br>  Here's the standard LA format. In NY, it's usually the same but with Theatre being higher up than Film/TV (/ denotes column breaks):<br>  <br>  At the top and centered:<br>  Name (Centered and is largest in font size)<br>  Union affiliation (if any)<br>  CELL Phone Number<br>  Email<br>  <br>  Far Left side below the top and centered stuff:<br>  Height <br>  Weight<br>  Hair color<br>  Eye color<br>  <br>  Right side opposite of statistics:<br>  Agent logo with contact info (sometimes if you have an agent, you can remove your own cell phone and email address. Then weirdos that find your stuff in the dumpster can contact them instead of you)<br>  <br>  Film<br>  Title/(Lead, supporting, featured)/Director<br>  <br>  Television<br>  Title/(Lead, guest star, co-star, regular, featured)/Network<br>  <br>  Theatre<br>  Title/Specific character played/Production company or director depending on who is more prestigious.<br>  <br>  Commericials<br>  ALWAYS put "List available upon request!" Do keep a separate list of the commercials with the Casting directors involved in case an agent asks.<br>  <br>  Training<br>  Skill learned/School or teacher/Location (LA, NY?)<br>  <br>  Special Skills/Abilities<br>  Be creative with this. When I was starting out and interviewing with agencies, they would usually go straight there and talk about my special talents and even had me demonstrate some of them<br>  <br>  DON'T:<br>  -Put extra work<br>  -Put Modeling/Print gigs. You make a separate resume for that.<br>  -Lie<br>  -Put age. If an agent asks you when you meet with him or her, then tell the truth. It's for legal reasons. ie. Under 18 can't work normal hours or you have to be at least 25 to do a beer commercial.<br>  -Put your home phone number or address unless you want weirdos coming to your house.<br>  -Put dates. It ages you!<br>  <br>  If you don't have too many credits or none at all, have a lot of training. That will show that you're still serious.

American History write a paper about the Battle of Midway, how we sent off the carrier Yorktown to get repaired which normally would have taken 90 days, but Americans were able to get it done in 72 hours, which majorly turned the outcome of the battle around because the Japs thought we only had 2 carriers, when in all actuality we had 3. <br>  <br>  World History- I have always loved the Romanov story, its rather intersting.

Besides older people are much harder to convince, its a heck of a lot easier on someone young because they can be influenced much more effectively because they dont know any better. Even me telling you my answer, you could accept mines or any others answer here and by doing so  you just accepted thier or my "ideas". You will pick whichever one you felt most satisfied with but your satisfaction does not make any of our answer true or  any less valuable. Most people are very easily tricked into this. Hitler told the germans what they wanted to hear, told them who was to blame for germanys woes, told them what to do to fix it. They felt satisfied and went along with hitler ideas down a road of death and destruction.|`|O0jEmiDEaa	He did get old people, but young people are the ones that were going to fight the war and (in victory) reap the benefits.

Hitler got rid of anything that was not perfection in his race, i.e. mentally handicapped, unwanted children (abortion), he practiced euthenasia, and he had a big problem with America because a lot of his best were migrating to a free country. Which is maybe why we are the only country he declared war on in WWII.

7f7aa0ea5dc924471fffd54e742f67ddaa	There is no comparison, unless you want to use fractions or per cent-ages, of the vastly greater numbers of those who died in China at the hands of the Japanese, or as a result of the Japanese invasion of China 1937-1945, with that of those who died at either Hiroshima or Nagasaki.<br>  <br>  I have seen figures in the millions, anywhere from the 19 given here to 20 million  (including military deaths) elsewhere. The Chinese people, were the real victims in the Second World War, since a large portion of those killed were civilians.<br>  <br>  Why the victims of the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima should be singled out as the only innocent victims of WW II, or the most important innocent victims is beyond me, and an aberration of the truth. I have seen person after person here on Yahoo! Answers claiming how the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was wrong (some even use the term "War Crime") all the while ignoring the greater numbers of victims in China. The bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki gave Japan no choice but unconditional surrender and no doubt saved many lives in China too.<br>  <br>  A question like yours is the first step to truly understanding History.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	The immediate effects of the blast killed approximately 70,000 people in Hiroshima<br>  <br>  In Nagasaki casualty estimates for immediate deaths range from 40,000 to 75,000.<br>  <br>  China suffered more than 19 million killed during WWII.|`|kacLYFrHaa	I don't think the number is actually known. After all, there is Unit 731 to take into account. This lovely little unit researched and developed chemical and biological weapons. It's estimated that at least 400,000 Chinese civilians died from experiments testing cholera, anthrax, and the plague (this is more than the estimated total of all those who died by the end of 1945 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki which was around 214,000). But this is just an estimate and it's possible there were experiments which resulted in the deaths of even more Chinese civilians that we don't know about. And this does not count the total killed by the Japanese Army.

AA12034021	When Lenin took over Russia, Russia withdrew from WWI.  Germany (and Austria and Turkey) no longer had to fight a 2 front war.  They could concentrate their efforts on one front.  It did not, however, last long.  This is because the U.S.A. and U.K. invaded Russia, and attacked Germany from the east, so that they would have to continue to fight a two front war.<br>  <br>  Edit: Merlin is thinking of WWII.  Russia did not fare that well in WWI, though did have 2 major advances.  Both sides had difficulty breaking through trench warefare.  The thing is, they would shell the spot that they were going to attack for like 3 days, and then attack.  Well, 3 days is plenty of time for the enemy to figure out what is going on, dig fall back trenches, and move in reinforcements.  Plus the land was so torn up with shell holes, that it was hard to make any progress.<br>  <br>  Well, quite by accident, Russia managed to break through.  They ran out of ammo, and only shelled for 6 hours.  A second time, they ran out of ammo, and shelled for 8 hours, and broke through.  The thing is, they never understood why they broke through.  U.S. General Pershing actually studied what had happened in Russia, and proposed shelling for 6 hours.  The British and French tried to talk him out of it - "these young upstart Americans, they don't know anything about this war we've been fighting for years...".  Their tune changed when it worked.|`|PQmCk7Fiaa	This is from the top of my head so sorry if I am not TOO specific.<br>  <br>  <br>  V.I. Lenin basically paved the way for communist Russia. He basically set the stages for Russia to become a dominant power during WWII. Germany wanted to retake everything that was lost to them as a result of the Treaty of Versai. and then some. Lenin, along with his administration created reforms that would revolutionize Russia, treaties/statements and later allowing Russia to join the Allied powers. In 1939, Russia signed a treaty with Germany stating that German would not "touch" any of Russia's lands but obviously they broke that.<br>   <br>  As mentioned, Lenin set the USSR in place for Stalin who eventually comes to power and is mainly responsible for defending Russia against the invading Nazis (Battle of Stalingrad)|`|AA12071552	They actually defeated the German's when they tried to invade

AA10961798	Your assessment that the "97" and "11" represent "1897" and "1911" is correct.  If you have the curiosity and the time, look up the information on those patents on Google patent search, link below.  Also  try to link to other patents that cite those two original patents, which should provide you with clues for production dates.    Unlike cameras and other optics, most tripods don't carry serial numbers and are thus are hard to date with any accuracy (within a few years at best) without further documentaion.  I'd seriously suggest you contact Kodak and inquire about production dates.  With luck, they'll have kept their archives and have somebody there willing to help you out.  Given the current economic climate, you may not get an answer, but it's worth a shot.    Obviously, the tripod wasn't made before the last patent date.  In general, any object with a patent date is most likely made within the period the patent(s) was (were) in force.  IIRC, that was 17 years in 1911 - so I'd be willing to bet your camera was most likely made some time in the 1910s or the first half of the 1920s.    ---- additional comments ----    Often products that are made with little change over many years carry patent dates after the patent printed on them expire.  That was the basis of my suggestion that you look for citations by later patents that refer back to the old ones.  The dates of the later patents that are not stamped into the tripod will help you estimate an end-date when it was made.

J9fxTGwKaa	There were thousands of workers working in just one factory working for their boss. They got paid extremely little and had horrible working conditions. Most workers did not get housing with their work, but some lucky few did. On the farms however, it was mostly family work. There would be anywhere from 0-10 extra workers that got paid a decent amount of money to do the work. The working conditions were also fairly decent. Housing was usually provided on the farm, but the worker could live elsewhere if desired.
v70p2kgWaa	Define western literature class and the structure for the class (time periods would also help american and british literature on their own tend to be broken up into more than one time period).  I don't mean to be picky it's just lit class can range from survey classes like American literature all the way down to special topics like the Dectective Literature and Harry Potter (yep real class offered at my college).    Greek literature has major influences on Western Literature and are common enough references whether we realize it or not.  The great bard William Shakespeare often uses references to greek culture.  Thus to study literature of the west, a base knowledge in some of its roots is a good idea.

I thought using the electronic one would be fine because it was a lot cheaper, but I wasn't able to focus at all while reading. I find that in an ebook I skim a lot more, which doesn't go over so well in Macroeconomics class.    They generally are cheaper, though, because you aren't wasting the printing money. However, I stand firmly behind print textbooks.    Besides, you can resell a print textbook. What can you do with an ebook? It's kind of money down the drain, in the end. You can't keep it on a shelf and look at it down the road because your code expires and it does you no good.

You can't read it while you're waiting on the bus or at the doctor's office.      It's harder on your eyes.    It's harder to take notes, and you can't highlight text like you can with a print textbook.    Extra point:  You can't sell them back at the end of the semester.    For:    It's easier to search for specific passages.    It's more interactive.    It's cheaper, but not necessarily in the long run, since you can't sell them at the end of the semester.    Extra point: they're better for the environment.      I hate them myself, and will pay extra for a print book.|`|k0P7Sm4Xaa	Against:     -They are destroying the book market.   -Almost everything these days are electrical - books have always been different. Electronics will soon take over the world. This has to stop.   -What happens if it breaks? Or you lose it? Or someone steals it? Then you're stuffed. Or it runs out of charge? Or the world comes to an end and we don't have any electricity? We would be dependable on something that can run out. Books are reliable.|`|AHuBqplbaa	the good parts about electronic text books are the saving of trees, the lighter weight (much easier to transport), and you can save even more by sharing the file amongst peers (legally or not).      the bad parts are mostly about old-school preferences - that electronic files are not a 'thing' you can put on your shelf (ownership is important to many), you can't make notes in the margins (although you can highlight on most electronic readers).      The idea that electronic media is more difficult to read, or harder on the eyes is no longer applicable with modern reader displays, except as a mental block in some.  The idea that you can lose it is silly, since you can lose any book.|`|irPhrsGraa	Against.    Books have pretty covers  If it breaks, your done for.  Its destroying the book economy  You have to wait for ages for it to load.     And loads of other reasons.

I do see your point though, people do get obsessive, i have asked my fair share of 'twilight' questions. But really, whats the harm. There aren't really that many good series's out there that have no swearing, or sex..or very little violence. So let us get our kicks. <br>  and, i'd never even heard of anything 'twilight' until it was in the movie theatres! which goe's to show me that i'm sure there are so many good books out there that i am missing out on altogether...bummer.<br>  oh, and i think the only damage it really does is set young girls up to be disappointed, seriously, Because Edward Cullen is soo over the top attentive and charming and so on...no real guy could ever live up too him, it gives unrealistic expectations.<br>  <br>  other than that though, i'm pretty easy to please, it is what it is...a vampire love story...just a story.|`|MMmv06Ynaa	ur so right.i dunno why some ppl get so obsessed? its really weird and i don't understand. the movie like u said is pathetic but the fans r like oh it was so great! and one chick i know saw it like 7 times at the movies for no reason. thats like really unhealthy too. i think they are obsessed cause of robert pattinson though, thats probably the main reason.|`|oSsVEXMxaa	No, but by asking questions about it you're just fueling the fire. Plus, tons of people have asked similar questions already :/ Please don't be like the Twilight fans who ask "When is Midnight Sun coming out?" eleventy-billion times a day.|`|muD7o37iaa	YOU'RE NOT.<br>  have you read any of the twiquestions on here?<br>  everyone's sick of it, that ship has sailed a long time ago<br>  <br>  and apparently some new passengers are boarding<br>  thank God.|`|c9xy59Ymaa	Its because the movie came out.

I know were you are coming from and ever SINCE the movie came out I have heard so much about twilight I feel like have have read the book's even knowing I have never even read the first page from any of them.  So no you're not alone.  Hopes that helps XD.|`|IceMVLNIaa	YES YOU ARE:sorry if this sounds rude and i know you wont pick me for your best answer, but THE TWILIGHT SAGA ROCKS<br>  Twilight may not be new but it is definately the best book in the history of the world. if you have read all of the books, which i reccomend if you havent, then go to the authors website (listed below) and read it from *EDWARDS** version its called midnight sun CHECK IT OUT|`|Iyr1nJ4Laa	I TOTALLY AGREE! twilight is a typical love stories, people that have read this and find it better than any other book, obviously haven't read good literature!

HqcH85SMaa	Unhallowed Ground by Gillian White<br>  <br>  Georgina Jefferson is a social worker who has been appalled by the death of a little girl, Angels Hopkins. She feels that she is blamed by the media for the death and flees London in despair to seek refuge at Furze Pen, a picturesque thatched cottage in a peaceful valley on Dartmoor. The cottage belonged to her dead brother, Stephen Southwell, an artist, and seems the ideal place to recover from the pressures of her job in London. But all is not as pleasing as it seems at Furze Pen. The cottage is cold and isolated and the neighbours, particularly the Cramers, are weird and strangely intimidating. There is, also, a silent watcher on the distant hill and Georgie, alone and depressed, feels threatened. Her condition worsens as strange happenings take place at the cottage. The watcher begins to stalk her. Chickens are attacked and their heads chopped off. There is a fire and smouldering among the ashes are the remains of a child's doll. Then a man is found with his foot cut off. It is enough to make Georgie leave and when an unknown buyer makes an offer for the cottage she is tempted to sell. But she hangs on, keen to know what is going on, and is, inevitably, alone and vulnerable when the terror strikes during a snow storm. <br>  The blurbs on the cover speak of Gillian White' s "psychological thrillers" which are "full of suspense". But the narrative does not flow as smoothly as one would wish. There are frequent flashbacks in the first part of the book which often hold up the action and towards the end the author switches suddenly back and forth from the past tense to the present. This may be an attempt to increase tension, though it is hardly necessary. The exposure of the sympathetic Georgina to danger provides tension enough. And her involvement in the death of a child at the end of the book provides an interesting parallel with the death of Angels Hopkins at the beginning.|`|AA11991012	A Bend in the Road by Nicholas Sparks|`|oUFDH0Ztaa	green eggs and ham|`|92yiQo7uaa	Homeboy by seth morgan. out of print get it at amazon.com|`|FZ1jvTQaaa	If you like to read, I'd suggest reading some classics.<br>  My favorites are <br>  Sound and the Fury : William Faulkner<br>  100 Years of Solitude : Gabriel Garcia Marquez<br>  And not really a "classic" but an amazing book to challenge how you think<br>  Life of Pi : Yann Martel<br>  (Note : I read all these in high school but i was an advanced reader, they are a little more college or honors level)|`|AA12147036	Ordinary People is my favorite book.I've read it twice and even though I know when you have a good book your supposed to pass it along I just can't let go of this one.The covers's completely off after reading it so much.<br>  <a href="http://www.authspot.com/Poetry/The-House-with-All-the-Lights-Off.499093" rel="nofollow">http://www.authspot.com/Poetry/The-House...</a>|`|iY36ARNwaa	If you honestly feel yourself mature enough, then I'd recommend Clarissa.

Stone was Coolidge's fellow Amherst alumnus and was serving as dean of Columbia Law School when Coolidge appointed him to be Attorney General in 1924.

It is an aid in playing bar chords.  <br>  If you are playing 'bar chords' without a capo, you have to use your index finger to go across all 6 strings on the same fret, and then use your remaining three fingers to make the chord/s you want.  Bar chords are hard to play for some people.  A capo is used so you don't have to bar the strings with your index finger, and then you can use all four fingers to make the chord/s you want.  <br>  So, a capo doesn't mute the strings, it makes them all a higher pitch, like you're playing all the notes higher.<br>  <br>  Here's a website that might help you learn the technique of muting your strings: <a href="http://www.accessrock.com/IntermediateLessons/muting-guitar-strings.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.accessrock.com/IntermediateLe...</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|wRCKf1Mzaa	capo

swlqQ1mYaa	Hmm . . . in my history class we evaluated his dictatorship as a success, if one that cost a lot of human lives. Remember, Stalin's main focuses were to keep power to himself, and to change the base of the USSR's economy so that it would be easier to prevent other countries from kicking him out of power. He stayed in power until he died (I think in 1953), so that was a success. He also succeeded in changing the USSR's economy from a agriculture base to an industry base.<br>  <br>  As for crimes . . . well, he wasn't charged with many at the time! After all, he was a totalitarian dictator who controlled soft power (media, education, etc.) as well as hard power (military, industry, etc.). If a report on his past didn't suit him, he had it changed; and no one dared to challenge him at the time.<br>  <br>  Well, Lenin charged Stalin with unnecessary cruelty in his Testaments and said that he should be purged from the Politburo because of it. But the Testaments were unflattering to a lot of the old Bolsheviks, so it was hushed up. Stalin . . . unrightly accused a lot of people for sabotage, spying, or conspiring against him; particularly during the purges. One could argue the aspect of his labor camps as a crime against humanity . . . but that's human rights, not history, so I don't know the specifics of that. Ditto with censoring the media and labeling propaganda, education.<br>  <br>  When you think about it, he was very smart about the bad things he did and did them in a way that wasn't obvious.|`|kWAm7syDaa	<a href="http://getinall.palacebet.com" rel="nofollow">http://getinall.palacebet.com</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check
02200970c8ed5e86bf84427d7244870eaa	You know, once I performed in a talent contest with pneumonia and it did not go well...haha, as you must know from your experience. Anyways, show personality from the moment you walk through the door! Don't act snobbish. Whatever you do, SMILE! Not all types of dance need a big grin on your face, but for a school dance team you need to show a willingness to learn and a good attitude. Do your best. I am sure that if you have 5 years of dance experience then you're not going to be totally lost. Concentrate and what they teach/tell you and give it all you've got!|`|hPVKMD4Iaa	GOOD LUCK!<br>  Just think that...you'll make it.<br>  Who cares what people think?  What are they going to do?  They can't tell you that you suck!  <br>  You'll do better than the other sluts trying out!  (Except for your friends)<br>  Lol, anyways, have fun!<br>  -Hazel <3|`|ULj5ngX6aa	Be confident in your self! And you have to just have fun. Most of the judging done in Comp. Is that you have to have a special light in your eye that shows that you LOVE 2 DANCE!!! also make sure it is sharp and precise. work your facials and u should be just fine!|`|lWbr1eWIaa	dance teams require a lot of ATTITUDE. and since you already have experience in dance, just make sure every move you hit is hard and strong.
