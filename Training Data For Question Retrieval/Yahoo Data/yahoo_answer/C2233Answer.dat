zkscW8seaa	Making a deck like that won't work out too well. This is simply because the number of LV monsters would not leave room for support. Plus, although LV monsters are strong, they are a pain to get out, and eventually get destroyed very easily. Instead, try out a Hopeless Dragon deck, this kind of deck features high level Dragon-Type cards, including Dark Horus and Dark Armed Dragon. Go on ahead, just type in Hopeless Dragon deck in the Search bar, it's that easy.|`|f6rHiAe2aa	Probably....or just make up a deck with Dark Horus and Dark Armed Dragon....here check this link out:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LLlZcE2_Gc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LLlZcE2_...</a><br>  <br>  It features Horus, the Black Flame Dragon and it's a full deck!

Definitely hook your 360 up with an HDMI cable.|`|F4ujCPGiaa	HDMI is a tad better, but I really don't notice that much.

SCnZ8CLRaa	Hey. I think that they should keep making Halo games that have master chief. They should add some more vehicles and weapons and new maps for online. Oh and some new aliens. Halo wars is more strategy based. It's like command and conquer. They should also make an online halo game for free for computer.<br>  Well, if you want a good Xbox 360 game, maybe get Fable 2 or wait for the new call of duty modern warfare 2 to come out.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps! Rofl.<br>  <br>  Bye.|`|BlDt6CjMaa	What? You can also play games similar to Halo the FPS on your computer too. I don't see how this is anytihng other than a very bad troll.

Like if they're good, use some evil spells and vice versa. Once they're neutral, you don't have to use only neutral spells. You can use some good or evil spells, but don't overuse them, or it'll change  their alignment.|`|1K8IaPykaa	I believe the Sims are already neutral when they begin their lives as witches. You can influence this by performing "neutral" spells, such as making food, cleaning, and teleporting.

vtJDHJDYaa	Kingdom Hearts 358/2 days on DS<br>  Part of the new installments of the Kingdom Hearts series, the untold story of Roxas while Sora was asleep, the game focuses on the daily life of the Organization 13 Main headquarters (Xemnas, Xigbar, Saix, Demyx, Xaldin, Axel and Roxas) and how was Roxas of that time, the game its after Kingdom Hearts Chain Of Memories, thats why some gamers had call the game “Kingdom Hearts Chain Of Memories 2″ since is coming for the DS too. The title “358/2″ will explain itself once you had beat the game. The story is about how long Roxas stayed on Organization 13. As well as his battle with Riku in the secret ending “Deep Dive” of Kingdom Hearts 1.<br>  <br>  Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep on PSP<br>  The new installment of the Kingdom Hearts series for the PSP, explaining the deep past of Kingdom Hearts, we are introduced by 3 characters, Ven, Terra and Aqua, Ven has a relation with Sora, Ven means air, as Sora means wind, which are the same; Aqua means water, and Kairi means ocean, which leads the same to water; Terra means earth, as Riku has some relation with earth. The major playable character is Terra, seen in the scans. In the game, the world Hollow Bastion or better known as Radiant Garden will explain himself more. Disney characters will make an appearance here as well. The old man is an older version of Xehanort, the game itself will show the gamers the Real Keyblade Master.<br>  <br>  Kingdom Hearts Coded on Mobile Phones<br>  Part of the 3 new installments of the Kingdom Hearts series, focusing on Sora and Jimminy Cricket, this game has been consider Chain Of Memories 2 since the style of the gameplay and the story, this game assembles Sora in his old clothes, which it might be or after Kingdom Hearts 1 or before Kingdom Hearts 1. The worlds we see in this game are Traverse Town and Destiny Islands. Disney characters in this game are Mickey and Jimminy Cricket.|`|4FAcbtskaa	Yes, the Sora one is only for Mobile phones IN JAPAN. <br>  <br>  And these are only filler games for the DS and PSP, like CoM was, so its not surprising. They're games to fill in previous gaps, just like if you didn't play Chain of Memories then you missed out on a big chunk for KH2.<br>  <br>  And since everybody knows Roxas, I don't think its bad marketing at all. And besides since KH fans are so starved for something since its been nearly 5 years since the last game I'm sure that it'll sell like its the best thing in the freaking world.|`|PTovC2Dqaa	Here's a lot of information on the three new Kingdom Hearts games:<br>  <br>  Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (Nintendo DS):<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_358/2_Days" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hea...</a><br>  <br>  Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep (PlayStation Portable):<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_Birth_by_Sleep" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hea...</a><br>  <br>  Kingdom Hearts Coded (Cell Phones):<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_coded" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hea...</a>|`|BlDt6CjMaa	There are three Kingdom Hearts games currently in the works, for the DS, PSP and Mobile. None of these are Kingdom Hearts 3. There has been no information released about Kingdom hearts 3 at all.|`|7W5JCf4Naa	If you're referring to Kingdom Hearts 3, meaning, what people had originally assumed was Kingdom Hearts 3 after watching the Birth by Sleep secret endings from Kingdom Hearts II and Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, that game is actually called Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep. It's for the PSP and is currently in progress, but people expect it to be out late 2009 or ealry 2010.<br>  <br>  If you're referring to Kingdom Hearts 3, meaning, the letter that Sora, Riku, and Kairi received at the end of Kingdom Hearts II, there is no information. The title "Kingdom Hearts 3" hasn't even been announced as an actual title, and for the three games that are currently in progress, Sora has kind of a minor part, except in Coded.<br>  <br>  Yeah, Sora only has a major roll in Kingdom Hearts Coded, which only has two chapters out for download right now for some kind of Docomo phone model. It has no plans for outside releases. A long story short, a mysterious message appears in Jiminy's Journal (the one that was wiped out and is only supposed to say "Thank Namine" in it). The King digitizes the journal and enters the digital journal world. The player plays as a digital Sora and solves puzzles to solve the mystery.<br>  <br>  Kingdom hearts 358/2 Days will be out in Japan on May 30, 2009, with a rumored NA release date of August 31, 2009. It's about Roxas's time in the Organization as Sora sleeps to recover his memories, and introduces a new 14th member named Xion, with ties to Kairi and Sora. She also has the ability to use the keyblade, but specifically Sora's keyblade. <br>  <br>  Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep is currently still in progress, and is expected by gamers to come out late 2009 or early 2010. The secret ending for Kingdom Hearts II is what the game is about. The three keyblade apprentices (also known as chasers) Terra, Aqua, and Ven, go off in search of the missing keyblade master (Xehanort the old guy from the ending) and his apprentice (the guy in red and black with the helmet). It also explains how Maleficent obtained some of the princesses of hearts, why Roxas resembles Ven, and maybe how Kairi arrived at the Destiny Islands.<br>  <br>  For some more information:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_358/2_Days" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hea...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_Birth_by_Sleep" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hea...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_coded" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hea...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://khinsider.com" rel="nofollow">http://khinsider.com</a><br>  <a href="http://khexcursion.net" rel="nofollow">http://khexcursion.net</a><br>  <a href="http://kh13.com" rel="nofollow">http://kh13.com</a>

JWjq5iaXaa	I'm going to make two assumptions about the zombie apocalypse...<br>  <br>  <br>  1)It's a realistic one. The "zombies" aren't walking corpses, they're infected humans who are driven crazy by... whatever, some kind of virus I'm not going to get into because I've been answering zombie questions all night...<br>  <br>  but basically, you take him down the same way you take down a human, because a virus wouldn't change the way you're organ systems work. So basically, if you hit a major organ, the zombie will react the same way a human would, without pain... eventually, the body will shut down without medical attention, and it will die.<br>  <br>  2) The zombies sprint. Really, if a virus was decaying your brain, the only thing that would effect your movement would be your balance.<br>  <br>  Now, let's see...<br>  <br>  Guns:<br>  <br>  --------M-16 w/ M203 attachment (grenade launcher)<br>  I'd take this gun because It's quick, it's powerful, and good for a medium number of zombies. It'll take down about 85% of the zombies I shoot at, and kill about 60% of them. Any zombies that get close enough, I'll just smack away any who get close and shoot. Then, once the zombies in the surrounding area are down, shoot the writhing and twitching zombies that might get back up. The grenades will be good in a tight spot.<br>  <a href="http://www.imfdb.org/images/thumb/a/a7/M..." rel="nofollow">http://www.imfdb.org/images/thumb/a/a7/M...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  ---------SAW M249 Light Machine Gun<br>  oooohhhhh, this one will be fun. If I hear wailing and a huge horde's coming at me, I'll get in a corner, go prone, and let loose. This thing's got a monstrous ammo capacity, and about 90% of the zombies will go down. I'd say of the 90% that go down, 60% have a slim chance at getting up. That's when I can switch to the m-16, take out anyone that gets up, then use a hand-to-hand to kill the twitchers.<br>  <a href="http://www.airsplat.com/Images/ERA-CA-24..." rel="nofollow">http://www.airsplat.com/Images/ERA-CA-24...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  ---------Striker 12 "Street Sweeper" Auto Pump-action shotgun<br>  Holy **** these things are amazing. Honestly, I think a machine-gun outclasses a shotgun in horde-takedown, but if ever I had to reload, and the zombies were closing in, a shotgun would sound pretty nice. Look at this thing, it's old, but a modernized one would be amazing.<br>  <a href="http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w45/b..." rel="nofollow">http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w45/b...</a><br>  <br>  Hand-to-hand:<br>  <br>  the way I see it, weapons can be simply categorized:<br>  -light weapons (bottles, pieces of metal)<br>  -middle-weight weapons (baseball bats, 2x4s, metal rods)<br>  -heavy weapons (briefcases, TV's)<br>  -shanks (cut hangers, kitchen knives)<br>  -Firearms (guns, guns, guns)<br>  <br>  Firearms are out of the question... they were already mentioned above. Honestly, I am most comfortable using the middle-weight weapons... Light weapons never last very long, Heavy weapons can be too slow, and shanks are only good if I could pull it our easily and slash through multiple zombies... that'd require a katana.<br>  <br>  ---------Some kind of bladed staff<br>  as I've known, I've always been good at smacking things with sticks. A long, bladed stick would be perfect. It's long, so I could stay (kind of) far from the zombies, I could slash through more than one, and I could mix between slashing, stabbing, and smacking (if one edge was metal, instead of blade)<br>  ---------Spear<br>  Barbaric? Perhaps, but when studying the psychological harms of killing living creatures, what weapon isn't? A nice, long spear, combined with a shield and some protective armor, would allow a Greek Hoplite-type offensive defense action to keep zombies at bay.<br>  ---------Blunt Metal<br>  A crowbar, a metal baseball bat, any middle-weight weaponry (mentioned above) would do. Can't really explain much about why.|`|AO9AF7gtaa	guns with looooots of bullets!<br>  or some huge a** sword!<br>  bulldozer with a huge gasoline tank, that way you have fun driving and defending yourself!|`|xOduTscPaa	best weapons no chance<br>  <br>  Machete: Long lasting sharp not to long not too short, even when rusted still dangerous<br>  <br>  Samurai Sword. not tang 68" blade length perfect handle swift <br>  <br>  RULE ONE: Blades Dont Jam, Nor Do They Need Reloading<br>  <br>  cut off their heads better off dead<br>  <br>  Blades are perfect for anti wear and tear.<br>  <br>  Range Means nothing if you can speedwalk your more than a match for a zombie.|`|9rC93btzaa	I'd go with a sniper with unlimited ammo cuz you just blow off their heads without any danger of infection!!|`|AA10345720	My Sniper Long Gun, With Teflon Coated, Silver Tip 180 Grain FMJ Hollow Point, coated in anti Vampire Evaporator juice !!|`|FefUO0ijaa	Shotgun = Zombie Repellent.|`|rAWUCB1eaa	FLAMETHROWER AND THE RAY GUN!

3Nm1FOJ1aa	Prot actually does quite well now in PvP and is always a big need for groups while leveling. So being a tank will help you find groups faster and will help you get invited into groups. As for PvP, they enhanced a lot of the moves where you do amazing damage with your shield and other attacks. <br>  <br>  If you wish to do even more damage, yes fury spec is the way to go but you can stay prot and still be ok. At level 80 though, the need for tanks kinda decreases because there are so many DK tanks now.|`|lz6vAjSEaa	prot is best 4 pvp and instances|`|mg2BJbeAaa	Prot tends to struggle in PvP, unless you are a casual PvPer. Prot does quite well in instances though, and are usually in high demand towards the higher levels.<br>  Are you staying at lvl 60 or going to 80? Either way, you should consider Fury spec, as Titan's Grip is amazing, especially with Whirlwind.

Been a while since i played it though.<br>  <br>  Edit:  get rid of hydro pump... the accuracy makes it a bad move. Hydro cannon isnt badm but get rid of it, surf is a very nice balanced move.

0Ead5iQSaa	Every Final Fantasy game is different. The number just lets you know which one you are playing. <br>  Aries is from Final Fantasy VII. She dies in the game, but she is in Kingdom Hearts.<a href="http://www.tosky.co.uk/wp3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.tosky.co.uk/wp3.jpg</a><br>  <a href="http://www.thewizardskeep.com/ffviiac/pics/aries2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.thewizardskeep.com/ffviiac/pi...</a><br>   Kingdom Hearts makes no sense with the Final Fantasy characters. Auron is just a little older then Wakka. But in KH Wakka ia a kid. Tidus is 1,000 years younger then both of them, but is the same age as Wakka in KH. <br>  The only games that are connected are FFX and FFX-2. And if you believe the story that Final Fantasy X came before Final Fantasy VII. Then those two are connected. They say that the life stream is talked about in FFX-2. And they say that Years later they leave there planet, and go to the planet of FFVII. FFVII is hundreds of years after FFX. The best way to find things out about each game is to go to wikipedia and read up on them. You can start with any game to play. I would start with FFX. It is just hard to find the older games. FFX you can pick up for under $20. Enjoy.|`|3eQhA8nraa	yuffie is from ff7, as is tifa, cloud, sephiroth, "ariel" (aeris), and the man himself sephiroth. leon is from ff8.<br>  <br>  ff7 has one of the best story lines, im not going to ruin for you, go buy it. it was quite good.|`|atJIGcukaa	With the exception of X and X-2, none of them are related. For a first-timer, i suggest popping your FF cherry with IX followed by VII. If you like games with moving story lines and characters that will steal your heart. If you like plot twists and a ridiculously fun combat style. You will love Final Fantasy. Give it a shot you can pick up FFIX for like $20.
M4L3QY3gaa	EV's are a special part of raising pokemon.  Their main use is to maximize a pokemon's natural power. Bulbapedia says-<br>  <br>  "Effort values, often abbreviated as EVs, are an important part of Pokémon training to consider. While raising a Pokémon's level is a very important part of its training, making sure that a Pokémon gains effort points in the correct stats is just as important to making the Pokémon the best it can be. For a list of the effort points that Pokémon give away on their defeat, see list of Pokémon by effort value yield. "<br>  <br>  As for a more specific definition-<br>  <br>  "In Generation IV, while not much changed from Generation III, due mostly to the data structure remaining much the same, a series of items were introduced that would automatically add four effort points per Pokémon battled in a specific stat.<br>  <br>  Stat                     Item<br>  HP:                    Power Weight<br>  Attack:            Power Bracer<br>  Defense:             Power Belt<br>  Special Attack:     Power Lens<br>  Special Defense:  Power Band<br>  Speed:             Power Anklet<br>  <br>  <br>  They would, however, also add whatever the Pokémon defeated would naturally add. For example, a Pokémon defeating a Bidoof while holding the Power Lens would get 4 Special Attack effort points, as well as the 1 HP effort point Bidoof naturally rewards; defeating a Bidoof while holding the Power Weight would yield 5 HP effort points."|`|qbmkMWqeaa	<a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/EV_training" rel="nofollow">http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/E...</a>|`|BlDt6CjMaa	EV's are one of the many things that determine your pokemons stats. Every pokemon your pokemon defeats has a certain type and quantity of EV. Like defeating a Gastly will give you one Special Attack EV.You can also buy and use items such as calcium and protein. There is a maximum amount but I forget it. Go to serebii.net if you want to learn more.

BlDt6CjMaa	You should get Platinum, because it is an actual Pokemon game. Pokemon Ranger is a spin off, and most spin offs are bad. Pokemon Platinum uses the same system as the original pokemon games, while Pokemon Ranger is completely different. It's like what Mario Tennis is to Mario.|`|qbmkMWqeaa	platinum. There are some good changes from Diamond and Pearl...|`|VB7IxdNgaa	definatley platinum its better game plot than ranger and a better game
BlDt6CjMaa	No, while it could get you yelled at by 5 year olds.|`|YweJ1PfUaa	nope but if your boosting your boosting buddy might ge banned
M4L3QY3gaa	In my own experience, unless you're careful with them, Nintendo systems never last longer than 8-18 months. They're VERY fragile game systems. <br>  <br>  My top screen is completely white when I turn it on, and that really sucks.|`|HnkmYdYnaa	mine broke as well. It doesn't turn on at all. If it does it turns off immediately. I bought a new battery and it did nothing. So I'm waiting for the new one to come out on April 5th. it has  a camera and is a little slimmer.|`|uvEmc2Uhaa	same thing happened to mine after i spilled water on it... most likely  water damage. i mailed it to nintendo and they said they dont cover water damge. so i got a new, better one.
dNrDhzkHaa	I don't know you can try the first COD game if you want.
PxTLTTxSaa	Well, first you should try without cheating. You also need to build skills: it shows the skills you need just like with having a job. <br>  <br>  If you want to cheat a little, the 'maxmotives' and 'motivedecay on' cheat helps as well.<br>  <br>  If you want to cheat a lot, enter 'boolprop testingcheatsenabled true' into the cheat bar. Then shift + click on you sims, select 'spawn' and 'semester tester.'<br>  <br>  From then on, it should be pretty self-explanatory. Just make sure to delete the semester tester when you're done and enter 'boolprop testingcheatsenabled false.'|`|LXxxAzIqaa	You don't only do assignment you have to always go to class and go on the computer and write term paper. Or is you really want to super cheat by making them graduate or skip a term do boolprop testingcheatsenabled true and spawn semester tester.
hqY5XwMiaa	I bet theres a used copy at Gamestop.|`|PTovC2Dqaa	You can find the game Kingdom Hearts 2 at several stores. The best place to buy is probably at Wal-Mart or Target. Just look under the PlayStation 2 games and you'll find it for sure. This is the same with Kingdom Hearts 1 and Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories.<br>  <br>  When I bought the game it was $39.99 because I had bought it on the day it came out. Now their about $29.99 at most stores.|`|1K8NPRUOaa	they don't make the game no more. the only way you will find the game is at eb game store or used game outlet stores.|`|MMV6wz3oaa	The answer to question one is actually very very simple. You could definitely find it anywhere they sell used games, Like EB Games or gamespot or gamestop. I actually got mine at best buy they had like 85 fricken copies there.<br>  <br>  They still make Kingdom hearts 2 in a greatest version so yeah i don't see why you cant find it cause its extremely easy to find<br>  <br>  You can buy disc scratch removers at like gamestop or gamespot etc.<br>  or they'll do it for you over at gamespot or gamestop etc.
GgD9Sv0faa	You can't make "pretty hair" unless you go on modthesims2.com and download different hair. And you can only talk to the characters in the game. The point of it is to have fun, like any other game. It's like a "second life."|`|4712f79c3b66a688114af1fc7e707671aa	You can download the "pretty hair" you're probably thinking of off of different websites. <a href="http://modthesims2.com" rel="nofollow">http://modthesims2.com</a> is a great one, and it's all free, you just have to sign up for it (it takes like two seconds). <br>  The purpose of the game varies from person to person. Some use it as simply a way to create fabulous clothes and hairstyles for other people, to create stories or movies, and play just because it's fun. It takes your sims through their whole life, from birth to death, through marriage and having kids of your own and such.<br>  And no, you can't talk to other people in the game. It's not really a game that's played like that, it has sims created for you to interact with, but other than that, you aren't going to find any other "real" people on the game. It's not over the internet unfortunately.|`|UR6jvjBVaa	The Sims Is A Game so naw you cant talk to REAL People!<br>  the game has NPC's already made to interact with your character..|`|PxTLTTxSaa	I don't know what you're trying to ask. To create 'pretty hair and stuff' look at the tutorials here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://modthesims2.com/wiki.php?title=MTS2:Create" rel="nofollow">http://modthesims2.com/wiki.php?title=MT...</a><br>  <br>  Second, you can't talk to real people as in ones who actually exist, you can just talk to other sims who you create or who the game creates. Read the game manual that came with the game. It actually helps.<br>  <br>  I don't know why you bought it if you don't know what the purpose is. It's supposed to be a simulation of real life. Look at these tutorials:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://modthesims2.com/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:Gameplay_Guides" rel="nofollow">http://modthesims2.com/wiki.php?title=Ga...</a><br>  <br>  And figure out how to play the game before trying to create custom content and stuff.

GgD9Sv0faa	Do you have a dvd disc drive or a cd disk drive? Same thing happened to me, and I needed to get a dvd drive. If you do have a dvd drive, go to the "START" menu, hit "RUN" and type in what the booklet for the Sims game tells you to. I think it's something like "AutoRun/:C" Check the beginning of the book, since I'm not sure if that's exactly what it says. Good luck!
d39f3dbe21f2274aab83dceb86482ed2aa	Obviously it can't be proven, but as was said earlier, they look at betting patterns.  So if you are betting $10 per hand and then the shoe turns good and you bet $200 per hand, then it goes bad again and you lower your bet back to $10, it looks suspicious.  I think they suggest limiting the betting range and not increasing it too rapidly.  So if your low bet is $10, you might limit the maximum to $50 and not increase your bet by more than $10 or $20 from one hand to the next.|`|85AoQYh8aa	through your betting patterns and they are not like the cops even if they slightly suspect you of counting they have the right to toss u|`|2d643fe2509c39d5e9d2affcc16d13bcaa	Yup..

sdv81QXfaa	SUPER SMASH BROS. BRAWL!!!!!!!!  It would be my favorite smash bros. game if not for the lack of Mewtwo, but aside from that huge and abominable flaw, it's an awesome game!  And it's very fun, I only just played it online today, and it was a bit laggy for me, but it was fun!  I recommend Super Smash Bros. Brawl.|`|O1nUSQ8Baa	You will probably see this alot, but Super Smash Bros. Brawl. It is not as fun as Melee, and seems to have a slower combat system. The major drawback is that without friend codes and friends on your list, you can only play 2 minute melee, which makes it very easy for someone to stand back and steal kills. Good game overall though, and plenty of offline game-play as well.|`|atJIGcukaa	Smash Brothers Brawl.|`|XVzNJqa6aa	Cheak out Mario Cart|`|IuDHep8vaa	smash bros brawl

jM7CyxQzaa	Best bet would be to run fabric paint through an airbrush.<br>  <br>  An airbrush uses compressed air to spray a very find dusting of paint onto a surface. You could probably get a cheap airbrush and run it off cans of air  to keep costs down (note - get two as they freeze up as they work and can ice up, if you have one in reserve you can swap them out and make sure your paint doesn't dry in the mechanism of the brush) <br>  <br>  This is how the wildlife kind of stuffed toys have surface shading on noses etc, it's sprayed on using an airbrush.<br>  <br>  OR if you can't use one how about just watering the acrylic paint down by hand and using a range of brush sizes. There's gotta be online tutorials about making thebody of the doll, rag doll making has been going on for hundreds of years so there's techniques out there I would think/<br>  <br>  Good luck
PNfjbSQMaa	well you dint need to use system link to play with two people, you can play up to four on one xbox, but if your talking about setting up more then one xbox the answer is also yes, in pro gaming tournaments they usually set up eight xbox up to each other using system link so there is absolutely no lag.|`|UuDmX9HTaa	Yes,  look at the name,  system link<br>  <br>  <br>  of course you can<br>  <br>  common sense should have told you that.<br>  <br>  <br>  my x-box live is XDnoobSlayer<br>  <br>  so  holla at yo boi deauntreqman@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  you heard it from me so holla.|`|Vb92NEJtaa	yes

I have an xbox 360 and it really isn't as good as it should be unless you have good games and xbox live. However if you already have bikes then what's the point in getting another one. I personally would go for the 360 but that's only if you will have the money left to get xbox live and some good games, if you do the xbox and then xbox live then add me, I'm SneezyJuju. I hope this has helped in some way or another. :)|`|gvqsQ0u1aa	get the xbox360, its hours of endless fun, but make sure u get the elite one. theres no point spending money and not getting the best available. but then again, the price of the xbox will only get lower and much quicker than the price of the bmx, so if money is an issue, get the bike,<br>  but if u want some entertainment, i definitely recommend the 360|`|uxExLJUMaa	well do you want to sit around like a lazy bum,or go outside in some sunshine?its really up to you but i would get the bike.|`|Rd1FLoCbaa	the bike because the 360 will more than likely get hardware failure or get a ps3 instead|`|ZiMkydtHaa	get the xbox 360|`|wtQY6VEwaa	dont get a 360. most of them malfunction, and microsoft has terrible customer service. it isnt worth the hassle.

sWKGUPziaa	For the Sims 2 for PS2 it isn't the same as Sims 2 for PC. The Sims have goals they have to complete, as far as I've seen and the graphics aren't that great at all. Even the sims for the PS2 game aren't all that good looking. You don't have as many options on PS2 for Create a Sim as you do for the Sims 2 for PC. Sims 2 for PC is alot better than Sims 2 for PS2. Graphics, the game itself, everything.|`|ac53eed0ec00a2d980be53069b559e62aa	well, seeing as there is no such game as Nightlife for the PS2, that is a HUGE difference right there.

I have gotten as much as a third of what they sell it for, but also one sixth of what they sell it for. All of my games are in FANTASTIC condition, most of them have never even had the instruction booklet removed from the case. For six games, as I don't know the titles, you could pull anywhere between $20 and $60. Depends on the store.|`|egCrER9haa	You should call your local Gamestop. They will know the prices, but just to warn you, it is usually a rip off. They will give you $5 for each game but sell it for $15 or more. (just as an example, I don't know any prices)

RK1plJbOaa	Unfortunately, the interface is not designed for ease of use.  Due to time constraints, they were not able to get <br>  it to that point – but it is useable, and i find that once you get the hang of it, designing levels is pretty fun.

Make sure you save your level data before going here.<br>  <br>  [L] Load level (from textbox)<br>  This loads level data from the top textbox (pressing [L] brings up the text boxes – the top text box is for level data, and the bottom one is for demo data).<br>  <br>  [S] Save level (to clipboard)<br>  This saves the current level data to the top textbox and to the clipboard.  You can then paste it into a text file by pressing [CTRL] +[V].<br>  <br>  [J] Load empty map<br>  This feature loads a new empty map you can start with.<br>  <br>  [H] Load full map<br>  This feature loads a new map full of solid tiles you can start with.<br>  <br>  [E] Edit level<br>  Press this key to pull up Ned’s menu and begin creating / editing levels without resetting objects.  <br>  At the editor menu, pressing [insert] ([help] on an Apple pro keyboard) or [numpad 0] allows you to edit <br>  objects, and [delete] or [numpad .] allows you to edit ground tiles.  See section 4 for more information.<br>         <br>         <br>  [R] Reset objects<br>  This resets all the objects in the level to their initial states.

GLrE1VWQaa	-Nintendogs is a really good choice as it can suit both younger and older ages. It's probably the most realistic pet game out there and is really good fun, plus the puppies all look so cute!<br>  -Purr Pals is great for any cat lover, it has great mini games and will definitely keep you entertained and working hard. It's pretty much like a cat version of Nintendogs really.<br>  -Dogz 1 or 2 I would say stay away from, the first doesn't involve much interaction with your dog and the second one's dogs look incredibly unrealistic with large heads and small bodies. Gameplay is O.k.<br>  -Sims 2 pets is quite good at first but it repeats the same thing over and over with no variation so will get very boring, very quickly.<br>  -My favourite after Nintendogs is certainly more for children really but is cute and I really enjoy it. Bunnyz, the graphics are great and I love the little mini games that pop up randomly.<br>  <br>  These are the games I have played, I have been looking long and hard for good pet games lol, and out of the above, Nintendogs (for the realistic aproach) and Bunnyz (for the cute factor) are my favourites.<br>  Hope this helps x|`|1nM56bFkaa	No don't give up!<br>  Nintendogs it a good choice if you want a realistic experience of looking after dogs.<br>  Sims 2 Pets is good if you want to experience more of a realistic approach to life with pets. It starts off rubbish but gets so much better soon into it.<br>  They're both worth the money.<br>  Good Luck! :)|`|x9vY0kYqaa	Try the new pet game Squarenix recently came out with, My Pet Shop. I have recently played it non-stop and it is quite addicting. The story is basically you run a pet shop with your mom and you help the citizens in Green Town get pets. The game is challenging and rewarding. You can keep more than three pets for yourself and train them. Basically, this is just a more in-depth nintendogs with a pokemon safari capture style twist. In my opinion, this game is really fun. Search up My Pet Shop DS on images to get a glimpse of the game. Hope this helps~
Oecbf4d6aa	prestige is when you reach level 64 and decide to start over, you get 1 new custom slot per prestige and get to complete all of your challenges again. after your first one you get an achievement/trophy and another one after the 10th which is the last. hope i helped!|`|FDt7cC8haa	You can prestige up, for example in COD World at War...after completing level 65...you get a prestige level medal...and you are reset to level 1 weapons, perks, etc... and have to repeat obtaining points and completing challenges to level up.

You can teach it fly later on to get you around places.<br>  2. Brave Bird is a great move<br>  3.

Later on in the game, get a gible and train it into the fearsome garchomp! or alternitavely, get a dratini ( but u can only get it much later on in the game) then i would also suggest getting riolou, and train it into lucario  and for a final pokemon, i would train up a strong ;legendary eg palkia or dialga! HOPE I HELPED U !<br>  <br>  pS.POKEMON RULZ!!!!|`|aj1IdP3zaa	None because man if you catch the first one you will have to work you but off trying to train it you want to beat the eite four so wait until you get farther in the game it will be easier to train and you will not have to waste so many pokeballs on weak pokemon also do not capture Palkia/Dialga,Uxie,Azleaf,or Mesprite with a master ball buy a lot of ultra balls for help|`|i7ptpfgAaa	I would say chimicar is your best bet. and the later on catch a starly, and make sure you get a luxray and a buizel. and get your self a grass type to be a bit safe|`|9136WNCzaa	blow me ka chu|`|KSQ8y2Itaa	lol|`|MFAMzb6waa	sorry how old are you?|`|UEu3T3onaa	Well im a pokemon freak well if you start off with empoleon dont bother on a water pokemon but just in case because in the pokemon league flint has an infernape which has mach punch which is super effective against steel types if you start with torterra it is good to have him because he can kill an infernape with earthquake because it is a ground/Grass type pokemon. but start off with infernape is my suggestion because it is easier to get through the league but the pokemon party i would have is : <br>  <br>  Infernape<br>  Haunter/Gengar<br>  Staraptor<br>  gastrodon<br>  garchomp<br>  milotic<br>  they are some good types and sources of pokemon!.<br>  <br>  //Johno|`|AMmbutbOaa	on both of my two run, I have caught Luxray and Empoleon as my starter. Although it will face severe problem at the 2nd GYM, but the future is bright. <br>  Generally, I would recommend you to have a Water Type, Grass Type, and a Fire type (Or at least something that can use 2 fire moves) to go throught the all 8 GYM. (Elite 4 is another story, since those are INSANE levels.)<br>  <br>  Generally, I would recommend this team if you are with starter: <br>  Empoleon (Gyarados/Milotic/Golduck if you don't have one)/Torterra or Roserade/Infernape or Rapidash<br>  Luxray/Raichu (Age long argument on this one)<br>  Azelf (with fire move +Nasty Plot)<br>  Bronzong (Light Screen + Reflect + Toxic + Gyro ball To stall)<br>  Palkia (STAB on water + STAB on the Dragon type, the others are your own choice)  <br>  Weavile + Priority Move to Kill Ground Type(aka Garchomp)<br>  (Others: Lucario/Uxie/Crobat/Something can make the elites SLEEP)<br>  <br>  All in Lv.58 - To Lv.60 is Okey.<br>  <br>  And TONS of Luck + TONS of Potions/HEALER . You will need them, trust me. <br>  And Good Luck. Hope this help!|`|2BXcXRlXaa	it depends what pokemon you start out with (if you get empoleon, you wont want a water pokemon). The next pokemon I tried to get after the start was abra, because alakazam and even kadabra are very powerful. You might want to get a magikarp because gyrados are extremely powerful too.|`|JmDuiel9aa	Starly will be good for fly and it learns some of the best moves its good when you battle grass fighting and bug types. Bidoof when it evolves at lv.15 it can learn surf which is good against rock ground and fire. Shinx is a good electric type to beat water and flying. That is my team and I battle my cousin with these three and I win <br>  <br>  P.S They are Lv.100|`|lWQAjwjbaa	I think that when you start off, you should catch a starly and focus on training it for a while. There is actually no perfect team. All you need to do is to train your pokemon. Also: You should have 1 fire, 1 water, 1 electric, 1 psychic, etc... Don't have two of the same element!!!!!!|`|8NZmbkW1aa	theres a lot of great answers here, so ill just put in another suggestion; catch a starly, but at first oppurtnunity catch a zubat, because crobat is wicked fast. once u have one, you dont need a starly.<br>  <br>  i would have to go with vaporeon for the water type. its a tank.|`|cUSjKqaFaa	I suggest you to catch Shinx because it will be pretty strong when it evolves to Luxray.|`|iHIdEf01aa	Start off with Piplup because later on it learns Surf and other helpful moves. Train a Shinx, Starly, etc. DO NOT TRAIN A BIDOOF. IT IS A WASTE OF TIME!!!!|`|D8hJqSqyaa	yo, i think shinx is the best pokemon to catch first. He learns extreamly good moves and isnt all that hard to train.|`|oJg3rTyUaa	shinxs,bidoof,and starly|`|G70GOWvOaa	shinx and starly|`|x8Py3Mlfaa	starly and shinx<br>  <br>                                      for more time<br>  palkia , staraptor and roserade|`|EGllbUvyaa	luxio and starly

You can get a wireless router and use the stock settings, but to be able to set up a password and such, you will need a computer. If someone wants to loan you their laptop for instance, just to set up your WiFi, all you need is 5 min. Here is what you need:<br>  <br>  Xbox 360 Wireless Networking Adapter - $100<br>  Wireless Router - about $50<br>  Borrow a laptop to set it all up<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  -/\/\averick|`|TZW8bIvMaa	Yes, but you still need a modem.<br>  <br>  If you want wireless internet then it cost like ￡70 to get it but you can wire the xbox to the modem.|`|VpWIQfXdaa	It's easier with a comp, but try searching for a router in your area, if its not locked. Also, if you can buy one of those cords, it might help too. (The ones for broadband or somethin.)|`|EgAO49w9aa	dont know|`|Rk4vsJkLaa	you should set wireless up for that with compter. :(

YM6MrT8Xaa	In Fallout 1 you are chosen to search for a new water chip to repair the vault water purification system, as there is only enough supplies for 150 days before it runs out and people start dieing from thirst. In your travels you find the water chip and bring it back, thus fixing the purification system, and saving the vault. The overseer hears of your encounters with super mutants in your reports and fears for the vaults safety, and sends you back out to destroy the mutant base and the vats that create them. So you do that, and kill the mutant master making the wastes safe again and are the vault hero. Upon your return, the overseer thanks you, then permanently exiles you because you are a threat to the stability as your stories will make others want to leave, and the overseer doesn't want that. So you walk off and found a new village with the few people that manage to leave the vault and followers that have heard of your heroic tales.<br>  <br>  In Fallout 2, you have to save the village by getting the 'holy GECK', or Garden of Eden Creation Kit, which will allow you to build a whole settlement and grow more crops. So being the toughest warrior, you are sent out to find Vault 13 and recover the GECK. As you travel about you find many other settlements, including Vault city, one of the few vaults that actually worked and has a fairly civilized settlement built around it. Once you find Vault 13, you find it was taken over by Talking Deathclaws and other nomads from the wastes that were looking for safety. Upon more inquiries and helping the deathclaws, you get the GECK and take it back to your village, only to find out they had been taken captive by the Enclave and you have to rescue them. So you break in to the Enclave base in Navarro on the coast and steal a key FOB for a tanker in San Francisco, manage to get some fuel for it from some chemists, and program the autopilot to take you to the enclave oil rig in the ocean. The tanker docks with the rig, and bypasses the defences so you can rescue your village and the people from Vault 13. As it turns out they are testing a new virus to wipe out all life on the mainland so they can repopulate it with unmutated blood from the vaults and themselves. So you break them out, set the rig to explode and escape. Then your villagers and the survivors of vault 13 use the geck and from a new settlement and everyone lives happily ever after.|`|ee569f9fc53b911e3456517551d307fdaa	It's a bit long, the plot for each is in my sources.|`|mg2BJbeAaa	The world goes to war in 2077. It's mainly between China and the U.S.<br>  Nuclear technology is abundant. It's found in cars, robots, even soda to a degree. <br>  In preparation for the imminent war, a company called Vault-Tec built many vaults across the nation for people to survive inside. Some people were invited in, but most had to pay ludicrous sums of money to get in.<br>  After the bombs fell, the radiation and nuclear fallout left the world a shell of its former self, with all manner of horrors rising from the ashes.<br>  There's mutants, giant scorpions, even a sub-human group called ghouls. And that's just the "normal" things encountered.<br>  People in the Vaults were unaffected, until they opened their doors...
DM2M5LK4aa	Okay, here is a good rule of thumb:  Don't EVER seriously consider answering an email like this if there are that many spelling and grammar mistakes.  It is obvious whoever wrote that email was not a professional.  Secondly, the kind of people who do these things do not intend on kidnapping people.  All they want is your banking information so they can scam you and get your money.  What you need to do is look at exactly how much information you gave them.  They really can't do much to you financially without having any social security numbers, debit card/credit card numbers, etc.  But no, really, don't worry about the kidnapping crap; just don't give them any more information.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and by the way, what the hell was your dad thinking?

fE87Pxt7aa	it is a series of games started in 1987 owned by square ENIX there all RPG's and in my personal opinion the best games ever made especially final fantasy 7 there was a film made called final fantasy spirits within which is so loosely based on the games its hardly connected there was a film called advent children which directly followed on from final fantasy 7 and if you have a PS or PS2 i suggest going on amazon and buying final fantasy 7 for 20 quid because if you havent got much to do it will take over your life like it did and still does mine|`|CBSohUV9aa	Well if you have ever played kingdom hearts it is alot like that with pretty much the same characters. But final fantasy 7,8, and 10 are the best ones the game starts easy but gets harder through out the game|`|76ACQGyFaa	GAME AND MOVIE ALSO.<br>  <a href="http://www.watch-movies-links.net/s/final_fantasy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.watch-movies-links.net/s/fina...</a>|`|AA11053164	Its a game...however, it could also be the very last fantasy a person has. :-)|`|63dUOWFNaa	It a movie then game come.

9KeaTUh6aa	1. The abilities of creatures, artifacts, and enchantments aren't spells. You can't play a that says, "Counter target spell" and select the ability.<br>  2. The turn is divided into multiple phases. You can play a creature/artifact/enchantment's activated abilities (ones with the format "Cost: Effect") any time you could play an instant unless it says otherwise on the card. If part of the cost is tapping the card, you may not also attack. The only time you could do both is with a creature that does not tap to attack, like Steward of Valeron (in link).<br>  3. Adding mana to your mana pool doesn't mean add a land. Lands tap to produce mana. You can tap a mountain to add R (one red mana) to your mana pool. You then use that to play spells. A card like Kaleidostone (link below) adds WUBRG, which is one of each color of mana, to your pool. You then use that to play spells (creatures, enchantments, artifacts, sorceries, planeswalkers, and instants) and abilities (the things that the cards can do). To illustrate:<br>  -Joe plays Kaleidostone. He pays five mana of any color and uses Kaleidostone's activated ability. He sacrifices Kaleidostone and adds WUBRG to his mana pool. Joe then plays Fusion Elemental, which costs WUBRG. Later on, Joe plays another Kaleidostone and uses its ability. He then pays for Dragonsoul Knight's ability (link 3).<br>  4. Your last question doesn't make sense to me. If you means abilities, you can use abilities as much as you want unless it says otherwise.<br>  5. Trust what official material says...it's official.

ZNeadVNXaa	Well, I'd like to find out how you could target a Pro: Red creature with Banefire in the first place. XD <br>  <br>  So, assuming the creature gained Protection from Red while Banefire was still on the stack, the taget is now illegal and Banefire will be placed in it's owner's graveyard. Banefire doesn't become uncounterable from game rules such as illegal targets, only from cards and abilities that say "counter target spell" or try to prevent damage if X>5.<br>  <br>  BTW it will still be a legal target for such effects, like Cryptic  Command, so that player will still be able to draw a card if they chose that mode.

iG6BCh0taa	To get Artifact 19 you must complete all weapons achievements. You don't have to do them in one game (not that that's humanly possible, as far as I'm concerned). You will get the gun after you die in the game that you got the final achievement. It's in a 3rd weapon slot when you start any new game.<br>  <br>  It is a small, sub machine pistol look alike, coloured green and cream. It shoots lightning and uses no ammunition, but recharges. You can't throw it away.|`|di0YAqD8aa	Yeah, you have to get all the 100 kill achievements with all the other weapons. Then you have to DIE (important) and start a new level, and it will be in a third weapon slot. You won't be able to throw it away, and you can't pick up ammo for it, it just recharges.|`|Ogc9tP3uaa	Well it says you must be skilled with all the weapons, so try and get the achievements for each weapon (that will take awhile)

B4uvrrtlaa	Yes there is We creating it!!!!! we have already designed and fully test four of our prototypes. The characters are fully 3D and are of real height  , example: dark magician is about 5'10" and a dragon say blue eyes is about 25'. All of the characters are animated and attack using actions just like the TV show. The disks have full sound from Boise systems, the projectors shoot out depending on the size of the area and perimeters the players are dueling in. The problem that arises is the designing of each and every character that comes from every so far we have designed 228 different monsters. They are real and will be coming soon in tournaments|`|XFRpw88Zaa	only in shows.

AA10237508	First of all we need to know how long you plan on staying in Florida. You wont be sleeping in Cinderella's castle but outside Disneyland in a hotel which will serve you FREE breakfast-muffins, cereal, bagels, toast, juice, coffee, etc. Take advantage of these by arriving early in the morning and grab an extra bagel for the ride to your destination. Your chaperones will understand everybody is on a budget and will probably lunch at fast food most days. All food inside the park is astronomically expensive so try to bring small snacks with you so you can afford to try a few of the fun treats inside the park! For dinner, ask your fellow choir members if they want to go in on a meal delivered to your hotel...Chinese? Pizza? Its cheap and they will like your idea. Figure $6 for lunch and $10 for dinner each night and you won't be hungry. As for souvenirs and stuff...I wouldn't spend more than $20! And I would spend it on stuff to give to friends and family back home! The best souvenirs you will have from this fun exciting journey are memories lasting your lifetime. Make sure to take a camera! The film you use must be high speed- 800 or more or else the airport's Xray during boarding will damage your film. Try to take a digital camera if you can.  Have a great time, tell Mickey I say hello and sing your heart out! :-)|`|d8HwFub8aa	Try to see if you can maybe pack food in a cooler. I would bring at least $200-$300 with me to the park and that also includes if you want to play games and eat at the park etc. Have fun on your trip!|`|Jm1M5j10aa	There are two things to keep in mind:  The ridiculously over-priced food, and the fact that you might want a souvenir on your way out.  <br>  <br>  You can expect a full meal with drink will be around 10 bucks, so it really depends on how long you're going to stay.

I bought a 8gb on ebay for $60, and you can get 16gb ones for like $90 on amazon.<br>  I also have a 1gb and 4gb as spares, the 1gb was $25 and the 4gb was $50 but it was 2nd hand.|`|3S4ci6Traa	Depending on the package you bought, it may or may not have come with an included memory stick.  Check the box itself for its normal contents (you'll find its contents on the back or bottom).  As for memory sticks, currently the largest stick size is 4 gigs and usually goes for around $40.<br>  <br>  (I've never seen the larget 8+ gb sticks sold anywhere, but if you can find them for a good price, get them.  Remember that they're not really necessary unless you'll be using your PSP heavily for digital music and movie media, otherwise, if you're just playing games, all you need is a 1 or 2 gb stick.)|`|2f8pTUcdaa	it depends. if you get a psp cobo thing that one that comes with starwars or somethink it does. but if you just get a regular psp it doesnt.|`|gsyhNAiRaa	memory sticks are very cheap. You can get a good 2 gig one for around $20 but they do have up to 8 gig stick for around $100.

lPnjjFkjaa	Please don't kill yourself. I was actually recently cut from my school's softball team. I have dedicated two years to the team (going during the summers to practice, going in the mornings to throw, etc). The only reason I didn't make it this year was because I was trying out for varsity, I had a horrible season last year and my skills weren't "varsity level" according to them. Believe me I understand your position. I love softball so much. It's my favorite sport.<br>  <br>  Listen. Just because you don't make the softball team doesn't justify your skills. You could be amazing at softball but ppl just happen to be better. If you are cut. Don't get so hung up. Learn from it. Talk to the coaches about ways to improve. The more you practice the better you'll be. Remember, nothing ventured, nothing gained.|`|eW0Lx8fcaa	wow, dont kill yourself just because you might get cut from a softball team, thats just stupid. if you kill yourself for not making a team you are retarded(sorry) seriously, there are so many good things in life, softball team...dont kill yourself over it|`|Sqei7Rj5aa	wow it wont be worth it dont kill yourself if you get cut then invite all ur friends for an emergency sleepover and explain the situation theyll comfort you just dont kill yourself|`|QJwaagGWaa	ok, why would you want to KILL yourself because you may get cut from the team. I understand that you LOVE playing the sport, but lets say what if you DO get cut from the team? Are you going to automatically commit honerable suicide? Are you willing to make your parents really sad by letting them lose you? NO! You do not kill yourself for that! You do not kill yourself because you are ashamed of something. When you lose something, there is always another door opened for you. If ANYONE tells you something or that they dont like the way you play softball, well that is their problem. That is their problem, and the only thing you can do is prove to YOURSELF that you can play Softball better than anyone else. So kid, dont kill yourse;lf because you might get expelled from theteam, use this as an oppurtunity to improve your in-game!

LnYr2dLfaa	"A Sony PlayStation Portable version was released, titled The Godfather: Mob Wars. Unlike the console versions, Mob Wars does not feature free-roaming environments. Instead, the game is restricted to a series of story missions involving Aldo Trapani. However, Mob Wars includes a new turn-based strategy mode with the aim of controlling all of New York City by neutralizing the rival families, completed by issuing orders and executing them as real-time missions. The portable version of the game also lacks the entire section of driving, even in the story missions, where the driving segments are replaced with cutscenes. When you complete the game you can not replay missions or mob wars. If you wish to continue playing, you will have to start over."<br>  <br>  From: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather:_The_Game#PSP" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfath...</a><br>  <br>  "It is produced by the same studio as the Scarface: The World Is Yours game for the PC, Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Wii; however, Scarface: Money. Power. Respect. is a turn-based strategy game featuring both single and multiplayer modes. The game challenges the player to make strategic decisions to rise to power and to direct an army of gunmen while fighting. In single-player story mode the player will direct strategic city-wide commands to dominate street-level real time combat. The game challenges the player to handle large territory, adversaries and profit-making opportunities through drug trafficking. In multiplayer mode it pits four players as criminal cartels in a race to gain money and turf. Through turn based showdowns and real time combat each player will manage production and distribution of drugs, build up enough cartel strength to overpower adversaries, conquer turf and rule the Miami drug scene."<br>  <br>  From: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarface:_Money._Power._Respect." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarface:_M...</a>|`|eQOxKa04aa	nothing only the difference is the price, the story of the game, the other one is portable|`|7Bzb7RN8aa	Yes they are different.

Ke6lYaQkaa	I prefer Zelda Phantom Hourglass. It justs seems better because i always have fun playing it. Also there many things to unlock so it will keep you playing and it has a good online mode ( i think final fantasy IV has a bad one). But if you could go with Final Fantasy III i think that one is way better than four but thats just my opinion. Only go with final fantasy if your a big fan. It just not that great if you don't like it.|`|1dPjTq0caa	ff4..are you kidding?..there's no other game to be getting for the ds until<br>  ff6 comes out...|`|bcubn8KNaa	Zelda, i am a hardcore gamer and prefer Phantom Hourglass.

7MnJUjo0aa	Okay, I'm like...the #1 RE fan and I saw this question. =P<br>  <br>  <br>  No, the live action films are NOT canon. The ONLY film that is canon is Resident Evil: Degeneration - It is a sequel to RE2, basically.<br>  <br>  The live action films completely distorted the plot in the games, really. A lot of the facts are twisted and the extra characters really  mess up the true storyline. The Hive and the Red Queen AI are probably the only things in the movies that could logically be tied in with the games.<br>  <br>  The live action movies are NOT CANON in any way. Hope this helps. If you need more information, or need me to elaborate, you can e-maul me. =P <br>  <br>  super_shania@msn.com|`|p330kgyxaa	I agree with Her. The only tie in is degeneration and it ties in after  RE 4 to be more exact. Claire was in Code Veronica and Leon was in RE:4 Degeneration takes place well after Code Veronica. As for the Hive and red queen question you get to enter the Hive in Resident Evil Outbreak, RE:3, etc... they are their own story I mean for christ sake the whole love story of Nemesis and Alice yeah ok there is a real tie in there lol....<br>  The timeline from what I personally know is as follows...<br>  RE:Zero, RE, RE2,RE:Outbreak File 1, RE:Nemesis, RE:Outbreak File 2, RE2 to File 2 all mesh together waiting for the end of Racoon City, RE Survivor actually takes place on an island after the Racoon City incident, RE:Dead Aim takes place immediately after the fall of Umbrella. Wonder what ever happend to this guy and asian chick Aida's sister or diffent code name?, Code Veronica and RE:4 take place near the same time Leon is on a mission from the President, Survivor 2 takes place as well in the code Veronica setting, RE: Umbrella Chronicles Is a summery of Data amassed by White Umbrella and the only one I know of that has the red queen , RE: Degeneration introduces us to Leon and Claire again, But mainly sets the stage for TRICELL. the New Baddies in RE:5, I look very much forward to the game, If you really look closely the whole storyline really evolves around Wesker and his Doings.|`|eO2yZVCkaa	the story of resident evil is always told from different perspectives. the movies do tie in somehow, we just not sure how. but everything connects at the core of the story, the t-virus, umbrella, and wesker.
AA10153982	I would use the same five fabrics in all of the blocks. If you want to mix it up and use other fabrics, keep the background the same and vary the "card" fabrics. Personally, I like the way the card trick block looks with narrow sashing between the blocks. It sets off the block so you can see the overlapping effect. If they're set together without sashing, sometimes the effect is lessened. Check out this link for another set of instructions:<br>  <a href="http://www.quilterscache.com/C/CardTrickBlock.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.quilterscache.com/C/CardTrick...</a><br>  <br>  On page 3 there are a bunch of links to photos of completed blocks and quilts. <br>  <br>  I don't know how experienced a quilter you are, but I've found there are easier (and more accurate) ways to make half and quarter square triangles. I start with squares slightly larger than the pattern calls for, draw a diagonal line 1/4" to EACH side of one diagonal (on the back of one of the squares), then place the square right sides together with the other fabric. Sew on the lines, cut down the center, and press - you'll have two half square triangles. Trim to size (in this case, 4 1/2") and your blocks will go together much easier. For quarter square triangles (the center square), make two half square triangle sets then draw the diagonal lines on the back of one of the half square triangle units, crossing the seam. Place right sides together with the other, alternate fabrics set and sew on the lines. Cut, open, and you'll have two quarter square triangles. One square of each fabric will produce four quarter square triangle units. For the half-quarter-square units, match a plain square with a half square triangle unit. <br>  <br>  Here's a better description:<br>  <a href="http://quilting.about.com/od/quickpiecingtechniques/ss/halfsquaretria.htm" rel="nofollow">http://quilting.about.com/od/quickpiecin...</a><br>  <br>  The advantage to this method is that you sew BEFORE cutting the bias, which means you don't have any stretchy bias edges exposed. Also, by sewing larger and trimming to size, your quarter inch seam allowance isn't so critical. You can make "perfect" blocks with a lot less effort.|`|FGyBCGZYaa	You can mix and match the fabrics any way you wish. Since the pattern you're using has 5 colors in it, I'd probably use all 5 colors in all the blocks, using a different background for the blocks.  For instance, if I were using yellow, blue, red, green, and orange, I would probably make one block with a yellow background, one with a blue background, and so on.<br>  <br>  If your fabrics have different fiber contents, and they're washable, wash them first.  That way, if there is any difference in the way they wash (one shrinks, another doesn't) or if the color in one runs, the finished quilt won't pucker or be discolored.|`|3iRl21Pqaa	Follow the advice given by the others.  I've done it with just two colours plus the background.  It's a lovely pattern.  And however you do it will be correct.

Just because it's more tactical and slower-paced than other shooters, doesn't mean it's less fun. Just means that you need to be a bit smarter to beat your enemies. <br>  <br>  To each his own, but I'll be over here, having a blast killing baddies in Vegas.

154dzJ1Faa	The directions will tell you what kind of needles you will need.  You can get a LOT of stitches on the needles, you know!<br>  <br>  You really only need the circular needles for all your work.  They will hold a lot and a lot of stitches.  I've had 1250 stitches on one row on mine, and it wasn't even fine yarn.  You can do anything from fingers of gloves to huge shawls with a 36" circular needle.<br>  <br>  You are worrying about something that hasn't happened yet.  Just get started and follow the directions.  When the problem arises, then you do something about it.  But it won't, so don't even think about something like that.  Get a couple of circular needles in the most popular sizes, and you will do fine with all your knitting work.|`|Q7IthmTFaa	Get some cable needles.|`|AA12177717	In a way it also depends on the weight of yarn you're using.  Laceweight yarns will probably fit, although not comfortably, on 14" straights, but anything thicker than that needs a 24" circular, longer if you're using worsted weight yarn, but you should be able to put a considerable number of stitches on a 32" (I've had 700 DK weight stitches for a shawl on a 32").  And, no, it's not a stupid question, it shows you're thinking ahead.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	if you have those double pointed ends, and not the needles that have the flat bottoms, you can get a piece of plastic and conjoin the two needles for bigger projects, and so depending on how you knit it, you can easily take off the piece of plastic when you dont have so many stitches on them. But if you dont want to do that, I would just get bigger ones because you can get up to 150 stitches.|`|M9FQSKRwaa	when it comes to that sort of project, you are better off just getting a circular needle that is at least 29" long in the size that you are using to make the shawl.<br>  <br>  circular needles are for working in the round and for holding a mass amount of stitches like making a blanket or a shaw.  Personally, I think that they are much better just working back and forth, less weight on your wrist.

3Gy2PJgzaa	not cool dude|`|td6WXhv4aa	It's not racist.|`|4h41aLa8aa	That is a really stupid question|`|JpG4zaA9aa	No Monopoly is not racist - its just how you play the game. <br>  However, there is a racist version of the game called GHETTOPOLY.<br>  <br>  They no longer make that game and I recently saw it at a yard sale selling for $50 dollars.  I asked the seller why not sell it on EBAy and she said it is banned from the website.<br>  <br>  I should have bought the game but I ran out of money.  I think it is a collectible item.  The sad part is an African-American did not create this game, an Asian business man did and made profit by exploiting the ins and outs of ghetto life. <br>  <br>  The description of the game on the Ghettopoly website reads:<br>  Buying stolen properties, pimpin hoes, building crack houses and projects, paying protection fees and getting car jacked are some of the elements of the game. Not dope enough?...If you don't have the money that you own to the loan shark you might just land yourself in da Emergency Room.|`|M8vxlM6laa	No it is not, it is all in the numbers that come up when the dice are rolled.

There is no such thing as a "guy game".

D4ot0qLpaa	I've always liked the Fire Cave. The weapon drops aren't as valuable as those in the CCL, and it has several battles with multiple opponents, but the gameplay is quick and smooth, there are no speeches, and it has two healing areas so it's easy to just run the quest over and over until your bag is full. Take the bottom path only (right-hand fork in the road).<br>  <br>  But really, the "best" farming area depends on your class abilities and weaponry. If you're not a mage, multiple opponents may slow you down, and if you don't have a good water or ice weapon, don't even bother with this quest.<br>  <br>  If your adult dragon is fully-trained, some of the titan fights can also be quite profitable. <br>  <br>  Have you checked out the forum resources on farming?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://forums2.battleon.com/f/tt.asp?forumid=197" rel="nofollow">http://forums2.battleon.com/f/tt.asp?for...</a>|`|TDG32O3aaa	Crystal clear pond|`|vZoOtsI3aa	isnt this against the rules?|`|wdgrsn86aa	i got bored of dragonfable for reals
AA11475571	There are a lot of different ways to enjoy U.B. Funkeys. You can explore, or chat with people, you can play games, or you can try to defeat master lox. You play games by going into the different gamerooms that each of your different funkeys unlock. You need to play games in order to defeat masterlox. You can always buy funkey familiars if you dont want to buy all of the different funkeys.
znehROHbaa	I see these games at used record/game exchange stores for about four dollars each. You could probably get around twenty for the DK64 but the others are pretty common. You probably wouldn't get very much for them unless you go about it thoughtfully.<br>  <br>  Don't sell them to a used game exchange. They will not give you a lot.<br>  <br>  Search eBay daily and check for days when your games don't seem to be for sale from other sellers/stores and start your auction at that time. That way, people won't think that there is a glut of the games you have. If the quantities of your game on eBay seem too plentiful, then people are willing to spend less on them.<br>  <br>  Also, sell your games as package deals. People will bid higher if they're getting more.
eO2yZVCkaa	As far as i know most naruto games on ps2 and wii are bad or average. the best naruto game is naruto rise of a ninja on xbox 360. i have it. it is good but can be annoying sometimes. but it is fun and i recommend it, unless you have anger problems.
dynYKimeaa	Similar to what the previous poster said, you have lots of random card that are just thrown into the mix and call it a 'deck'. It seem like you just put your favourite cards together. You kind of have dragon/zombie theme going on. You should pick one or the other. <br>  <br>  You can't really edit your deck, you need to pick a theme (example: dragon, zombie world, elemental heroes, etc). After you have pick a theme, try to make a deck with card related to your theme. <br>  <br>  Your deck right now is a 0/10.|`|nDR2iOF4aa	You call this a deck?!

ee569f9fc53b911e3456517551d307fdaa	There aren't really any good free MMOs out there.<br>  <br>  Your best bet would be to find a free Ragnarok Online or World of Warcraft server from www.xtremetop100.com, or to buy Guild Wars.|`|1yGzVeJKaa	guild wars<br>  <br>  it is not as good as wow but it is okay you have to buy the game.. but it is free online no monthly fees or anything like that|`|npRsY4hWaa	I'm going to give you my personal, honest opinion on this matter:<br>  <br>  If you want a GOOD mmorpg, that is structured, "offers real good pvp", has lots of character classes, and quests and missions and such allowing you to interact with others more, then you should consider buying a game instead of endlessly looking for a free one on the internet.<br>  <br>  Honestly, games that you buy are tons better than the free ones off the internet. I find that they are more structured, maintained, and have all-round better gameplay.<br>  <br>  Look at this...:<br>  <br>  Runescape<br>  Maplestory<br>  Silkroad<br>  FLYFF<br>  <br>  WoW<br>  Guild Wars<br>  City of Heroes/Villains<br>  Warhammer Online<br>  <br>  The first difference you notice between these two are that the first list is comprised of free games, the second are games you buy. But the second difference you realize is that the games in the second list are WAY better than the games in the first list. This isn't to say that the games in the first list are bad games, but the games in the second list simply outclass them.<br>  <br>  When you buy a game, you will get what you pay for, literally. Those other games make you sign up for special memberships (ex, Runescape) or purchase special items that you have to pay real money with (ex, Maplestory)...<br>  <br>  Also, not all games you buy have a $15-20 monthly fee. One such example is Guild Wars, which a lot of people are argue rivals WoW (I'm not going to get into that discussion so don't bother commenting on it).<br>  <br>  Anyways, that's just my opinion. I don't doubt that others may disagree with what I say. Good luck on finding a game.<br>  <br>  Edit: You can also play private servers, which are basically free versions of some mmorpgs that you usually have to pay for. There are private servers for WoW, but there are none for Guild Wars or City of Heroes/Villains. This is because Guild Wars does not offer free trials on the internet and has a lot of in-game updates, and City of Heroes/Villains has a lot of constant game updates as well.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

Fortunately, we stopped at a big truck stop where I was able to buy an economical meal at Taco Bell.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you are aware that food at Disneyland is very expensive! Food in Downtown Disney is probably even more expensive. I hope money is not severely limited for you! If I were you, I would bring $30 for dinner on Friday, and at least $40 for food at Disneyland. Plus $5-$10 for each meal on the road. When you go to Disneyland with your friends, you will see a LOT of cute stuff you want to buy. Make sure you keep in mind how much money you need for your meals. If it's Saturday afternoon, and you only have $25 left, you should probably not buy any more stuff and save the rest of your money for food.<br>  <br>  No matter what, you will have a blast. Bring a camera to take lots of pictures. And if you are going with a large group, there might be a lot of people in the hotel pool. If that is the case, you may actually want to stay out of the pool! The first year I went, there were a lot of people in the pool, and the next day at Disneyland, a lot of people (including me) got bad stomach problems.<br>  <br>  When you get there, write down your friends' hotel room numbers. You can call them for free on the hotel phones.<br>  <br>  I disagree that you should bring less money (unless you cannot afford to spend a lot on this trip). A meal at Disneyland can easily cost upward of $10. A cold drink will set you back at least $3, maybe more. As a student, you will probably not be allowed to leave Disneyland to find cheaper food. There isn't an easy way to eat cheap there. The only advice I have for sticking to a strict budget is to avoid snacks that don't fill you up - churros, Dole pineapple sticks, pickles, candy. And hopefully you can eat some kind of free breakfast at your hotel, so take advantage of it.|`|1WgOj89kaa	Dont bring too much each day, that way you wont be temted to spend much.|`|Jm1M5j10aa	Well, I think the best way to not spend too much is to not bother bringing too much money. :)<br>  <br>  Only bring what you'll need.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and a good way to make it memorable would be riding that "It's a small World" ride, with your arms up, and screaming the entire time.  I did for the that whole (what seemed to be) 20 minutes, and I got the biggest laughs out of my family, and even the people riding behind us.

In pokemon chronicles(a wierd show I watched once or twice,) misty is shown sometimes(The one I saw was where she needed new badges and Tracy helped.) When Ash traveled to the new land, pikachu was sick, and then some how, after being at Professor Birch's(The proffeser Oak of this region) lab, got lost in the forest. May found Pikachu, and somehow her bike got shocked(like misty) after Ash and May met, they decided to travel together. Brock somehow came back. As for dawn, I don't know how they met, but May is now gone along with her brother Max.|`|YDK74cUtaa	his friends chage every 2 or 3 seasons. but for sure misty was there longest-she was even with him and tracy.

Do not use flour to roll. If any additional dry ingredients are needed, use cinnamon. Roll to 1/3" thick and cut with cookie cutters.

rviSUZ0jaa	Vengeful Zombie seems a little sub par in your deck. Most of your other creatures have some kind of enhancement for zombies in play. Also it is 4 mana for a 3/2. I am not sure what other decks you are playing in casual but most red damage spells will kill it as is. So if you don't have one of the other power enhancing zombies in play a lot of times he will probably be destroyed and only cause the opponent to lose 1 life.  I think Noxious Ghoul could probably be cut too. It costs 5 mana and only gives non-zombies -1/-1. By the time it comes into play your opponent either has creatures that are too big to really care or you are winning anyways. If your opponents have some decks that churn out a lot of 1/1 creature tokens you might reconsider that advice. I am not a huge fan of Carrion Feeder. It is a 1/1 for 1 that can get bigger which is good, but most of the time he seems like you will not want to sacrifice your creatures to him. He could be really good if Lord of the undead is in play but otherwise he seems like you will sacrifice your bigger creatures to make him their size, but most of your bigger creatures enhance all of your other zombies too. So most of the time you will be preventing your self from building the zombie swarm you want. I like the number of lands you are playing, but I am not sure cabal coffers is that good as the list stands right now. Your most expensive creature is 5 cost and you don't really play any spells with X in the casting cost. It seems by the time the Coffers really starts producing a lot of mana you won't need it. Some cards I think might be good if you can find a spot for them: Bad Moon has won me several games playing zombies. Shizo, Death's Storehouse out of the Champions of Kamigawa might be a good one of land since you play Korlash HTB. It says tap for one black mana symbol or pay one black and tap it to give target legendary creature fear until end of turn. It is legendary and Korlash is your only target so I would only run 1. A couple spot removal spells might be good to squeeze in there. Sudden Death is great. 3 mana for target creature gets -4/-4 with split second so it cannot be responded too.

0WASp0bHaa	Gosh no. you can get everything to start with for about $30.<br>  <br>  This is called wet embossing.  I have dry embossed too. <br>  <br>  First off <br>  a pigment ink pad. (the other kind is called dye ink pad, this will not work with embossing)<br>  <br>  Versa mark (Versacolor, VersaMagic) is my favorite. You can also use Color Box. These run about $7.00.<br>  <br>  Then you will need embossing powder. <br>  Each pot of embossing powder will run about $4.00<br>  <br>  Then you will need a heating gun (do not use a hair dryer) Maybe about $20.00. Look for sales. And you can buy one with a coupon at Michael's and JoAnn fabrics. <br>  <br>  and of course rubber stamps. <br>  <br>  I wait for a 50% off sale at Hobby Lobby to buy mine. I also love Stampn' Up stamps sets. <br>  <br>  Ink your rubber stamp and stamp your imagine. Immediately pour the embossing powder on it. Use a lot. Tap off all excess powder (and put back in jar)<br>  Hold paper with tweezers and use heating gun to melt the powder. Be careful to not to over heat. You can see it turn shiny.<br>  <br>  Not to confuse you ...<br>  <br>  You can stamp with color pigment ink and use clear embossing powder. <br>  or<br>  You can stamp with Versamark clear and use colored embossing powder.|`|Vu3J4e0saa	My advise is try before you spend - just in case it is not for you.<br>  You can use virtually anything for a stamp from shop bought to using vegetables.  Potatoes make good stamps.  Try experimenting with other sorts like the cut off piece of a cabbage - excellent rose like stamp effect.<br>  If you mean embossing the stamp image (powder) then you will have to buy the proper stuff and a heat gun.<br>  Ink pads - start off with a black one.  Stamps can be coloured with water based colouring pens.  Wipe them off when finished with a baby wipe.  Build up your stock gradually.<br>  Go to Splitcoaststampers Resources for ideas and techniques

1G3XPiq3aa	Probably World of Warcraft. It has a lot of player interaction. You can do almost every aspect of the game together; questing, instancing, arena, battlegrounds. It's also quite popular with girls. I don't know what kind of games you're into. I played both Guild Wars and WoW with my ex, and would definitely recommend WoW.|`|FPsMtmThaa	I usually only game with my girl now, so I am always looking for games with co-op. Team Fortress 2 is a good game, but you can't play multiplayer together, on the same screen. =( <br>  <br>  The obvious games to play are Halo 3 and Gears of War 2 since they offer 2 player split screen.  However, if you are a couple who like to share and take turns playing single player, then you could take turns playing TF2, Portal or any of the Half Life games in Valve's "The Orange Box."<br>  <br>  Other than that, we both enjoyed playing Left 4 Dead although it ended rather quickly.  L4D has 2 player split screen and can be played online. We just finished playing FEAR 2 where we would switch on and off each level.  We enjoy horror/scary games like that.. another good one is Condemned 1 and 2.<br>  <br>  Other than that, my buddy introduced a decent party game to me.  I was surprised at how fun it was.  It's Shrek Super Party (yea, no joke) for the original Xbox.  But it's backwards compatible so it works on the 360 if that's the console you have. It's basically a bunch of fun mini-games.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.. happy gaming!<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|q1Fav370aa	I don't know about MMOs, but I recommend Left 4 Dead because it truly is unique, and Burnout Paradise is fun but I don't know if that offers team play. Assuming you have a ps3, Resistance 1 & 2 are great, so is Killzone 2 and Warhawk. Great but tame multiplayer includes Battlefield Bad Company, Halo 3, Rainbow 6 Vegas, Call of Duty 4, COD:WAW.|`|CncOEReIaa	IMVU,club amrian, or zwinky.|`|33g1DSv8aa	if you want to race each other try raceyourduck com,go to multiplayer|`|uxExLJUMaa	sex|`|YtuD4TkOaa	Guild Wars is one option you could consider. <br>  <br>  It's an online RPG, but it isn't a single massive world like WoW etc. (If you're familiar with older games it's sort of like an online-only 3D Diablo). Instead, whenever you go outside town, you and the people you're playing with get your own copy of the map ('instance' as it's called in jargon). This gives you peace to play the game without being bothered by loot stealers, griefers, and the rest of the debris that inhabit most MMOs.<br>  <br>  Also, there is not anything like the same element of 'grind' as with normal MMO games. You can get a character to the maximum level (20) in about 10 hours or so, and raising your skills is a simple matter of allocating stat points (you can change this as many times as you like, again unlike most MMOs).|`|55ZVxKw0aa	It depends on what each of you are into to be honest. I think MMOs offer a great way to game together, and offer different things to do that might interest both of you. My fiance and I game on World of Warcraft together. While he is a big PvPer I love crafting, and just leveling my characters. <br>  <br>  For none MMOs, I have to say I like Team Fortress a lot. I'm not a huge first person shooter fan, but it's pretty fun. Along with that Left for Dead, is great because you really have to rely on your team mates.<br>  <br>  Those are just a few suggestions I can give out.|`|kjOrrLyraa	Online game... lol ... Cheapest would obviously be Runescape... But its incredibly tedious... Sell you body for money... And you can only trade a set amount of money ... Ummm... Theres world of Warcraft? ... That costs money, only thats more roleplaying - Quest orientated - ￡9.98 a month.<br>  <br>  Xbox live if you both have an Xbox?... Theres loadsa games you can play... Ummm... Its not so much a game, but there is that IMVU chat thingy? Create a character and chat in different locations... Some random penguin thing i found a while back...? Its probably on miniclip look it up =P Apart from them i dont know may more lol... Hope i helped xD<br>  <br>  Goodluck finding something fun ^^|`|8xGlYptvaa	IMVU is fun i take it you dont mean shooting games. also second-life is pretty 'interactive'|`|AA11700955	BigPoint is a cool interactive online game site that just came on board through my web site.

513904c92e79649b91e9611ef5150b9aaa	The best one is marvel vs capcom 2|`|SsGMrpiyaa	Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is pretty fun..you should try it out.|`|nu3sqZsZaa	Marvel Alliance, X-Men Legends 1 & 2 are all good.  That Wolverine game is pretty good, too.  More Wolverine than superhero, though.<br>  <br>  Can't leave out any of the recent Spider-man games, though.  Movie and Ultimate Adaptions are good fun.
RjGtp41Zaa	I havenet played that game in years so I don't really remember (I did beat it though on Hard)<br>  <br>  Just memorize its stupid, ugly attacks and destroy him with super missles and the such. U probably don't have the Light Ray at that time though which makes it harder. Srry man. Check out GameFaqs.com for help though
43zXRpLYaa	When the ride starts it goes backwards for about 30 feet. Then it goes up a part way and it stops for about a minute. There you are looking down one of the hallways and it explains what happened in the past. Then it shakes and drops. It goes up and down slightly as if a ghost was operating the elevator. Then it goes all the way up, the doors open so you can look out and stops for just a couple of seconds, then it drops all the way down. It goes up and down again and then all the way up and all the way down. It moves back forward and then the ride is over.<br>  <br>  When you go all the way up the first time and the doors open, that is when your picture is taken so look scared and act goofy, however you want your picture to look.<br>  <br>  It's a lot of fun. My wife was so scared she was screaming like she was going to die. It was so funny and I was laughing so hard I almost pissed my pants.|`|eD7qRBKHaa	You are correct, sometimes there are drops that do not go all the way.  But you can count on at least a couple of all the way drops.  <br>  <br>  It's not terrifying, but it's not a kiddie ride, either.  It's very fun.  Just don't get yourself all worked up about it.|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	It is the bomb!!!  I LOVED IT!!  My son who was 5 at the time went on it three times with us!|`|0xmN2R44aa	I've only ride it once, but it was an experience.<br>  <br>  First of all the line is SUPER long and in the line you have to enter into a little elevator where there is a tv and it tells you the Tower of Terror Story in a minute summary. I remember I was like :"Is it going to be here? standing up?" But what I didn't knew is that there was another line outside the elevator which was disturbing because me and my family had been waiting for more than an hour. The story is about a hotel in a rainy day.There were people inside an elevator when a lightning strikes and they die. And now the ghost of those people is in the hotel. When you actually go in the elevator you sit down on your seat ( thank God you could sit down but believe me is just for a while) and put your seat belt on. Then 'magically' the elevator goes backwards and the summary begins again. This time longer and more vivid, it's kind of 3-D if you want something more specific. Then the lights turn off and you are suddenly falling 13 story's down and you literally can say that you're flying because if there were no seat belt, you'll be glued to the roof. Oh! and smile! You're picture is taken when the doors open and you see the whole park.It does drop, not a couple, but A LOT of times and everytime you get in, it changes the pattern. You'll never get the same ride again.<br>  <br>  I have to admit, I'm a scary cat , And I actually got bored. Why you might ask? Because at first it was terrifying but it so LONG, It is actually about 4 minutes. But at the end, if I have to give a rating of how scary it is, from 1 to 10, I'll give it a 6 because it wasn't so scary at all. Hope this helps!!!!
0HytYZKJaa	There are 4 % ranks each one you get a trophy I think top 1% 3% 6% and 10% (i think) but you have to be in the top 1, 3, 6 and 10% total players to get this. Its kinda odd atm tho like im ranked 430th and im in the top 1% but I have a friend who is ranked 9000 something who is in the top 1% but another friend is 3000 and hes in the top 10% soo.....its kinda confusing ~_~

BhFeii5Xaa	This is the exact same paper. It has a plastic coating on one side that adheares to the fabric but not to the iron.

I also let my grandkids use it to paint on.  It's inexpensive, continuous roll is perfect for spending a weekend being creative!|`|FGyBCGZYaa	It's regular freezer paper, the same as that used for wrapping meats for freezing.|`|6N3yjlXhaa	Yes it is and you can find it with wax paper, foil wrap and plastic wrap all of which should not be used with machine embroidery.<br>  <br>  Press with a warm iron and the shiny side will stick to the fabric.  It can be peeled off and used several times.|`|3iRl21Pqaa	Yes - I use it all the time, and buy a very long roll from a company specializing in kitchenware.  Latest project last week - printing on fabric using thin white cotton ironed onto freezer paper and cut to standard paper size.  Fab.  Good luck.
6jt6fuehaa	When in the underground. Open the menu and go to where the fossils are held. If you click on it, there should be an option to move it somewhere were you'd bring it up with you.|`|4HeeBMokaa	try pokemon forums or go to ign.com|`|Q1WIb2Gyaa	Yeah u go to treasures in the underground and it places it into your bag above ground|`|xVcSfj0laa	when underground select treasure and put it in your bag then  talk to him|`|Cd8hbB0Iaa	i dont know sorry. ill ask my brother|`|fJaZbXTkaa	oh yes there is. i do that sometimes too. while underground, there is a little menu on the righ side of the lower screen. select the one that is treasures, i think thats the one. if not, check the others. when you see the fossils you dug up and other items such as stones and such, select them. one of the selections i believe is 'move to bag'. do that and then they will litterally move into your bag. when you go back up they should all be there at the bottom of your items pocket.<br>  hope i helped and good luck with your game! (armour fossil turns into sheildon im pretty sure)
wAiVxAKNaa	If you are in a multicombat area (marked by crossed swords in the lower right corner of your screen), multiple people can attack each other.|`|CncOEReIaa	In the wilderness ditch ya. But not outside of it. If that were to happen I'd so get raped.|`|JcbOQ3Kwaa	Yes. But only when there are the crossed swords in the bottom right corner of the screen. For example, in front of Lumby, near the door, where there's the fountains and stuff, that's a safe spot. Nobody can attack you there. But right outside of there, there is the crossed swords, so more than one person can attack you.<br>  <br>  Also, on non PVP worlds, you can go back to where you died, and your stuff (armor, etc.) will be there for you to take, unless somebody else took it already. I'm not sure that there is that rule in the PVP worlds, I have gone back to my spot, and every time my stuff is gone. So I think either people are VERY fast, or it's not the same rule.<br>  Hope I helped ya!<br>  Have fun in runescape!!<br>  <br>  Please answer my question! :P<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227121159AAoXR7W">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|QmVSykDlaa	If you see that Crossed Swords symbol then that means that you are in an area where multiple people can attack the same monster,(or person in your case.)|`|5437985b95888863b86a1b13cbbbd60eaa	dang right you can. go into like level 5 wilderness or above and it can happen.

wAiVxAKNaa	Hi. :)<br>  <br>  Lighting maple logs for 99 firemaking will be cheap, but VERY dull and it will take a long time. I'll try and help you out the best I can. <br>  <br>  Level 70 FM is 737,700 EXP approximately. You need 13,034,431 EXP exactly for level 99.<br>  <br>  Assuming you do not have the flame gloves or ring of fire (which help drastically, by the way and you should get them) - you will need 91,087 maple logs for level 99. Maple logs give 135 XP each without ring of fire and flame gloves.<br>  <br>  At the moment, 91,087 maple logs will cost you 3,279,132 GP. This is not a lot compared to many other logs. Prices may vary - this amount is based on maples being 36 GP each on the Grand Exchange.<br>  <br>  You can light about 1,000 logs per hour. So, you can get about 135,000 Exp per hour. Assuming you light for 3 hours per day, that is 405,000 Exp per day. <br>  <br>  13,034,431 - 737,700 Exp = 12,296,731 Exp YOU need for level 99.<br>  12,296,731 \ 405,000 Exp per day = 30.036 days. <br>  <br>  About 30 days for 99 FM. Note that this is an approximation and will vary based on your attention and the amount of time you actually play per day. If you play less, it will obviously take longer. It is also based on lighting 1,000 logs per hour.|`|f398f25935df15199d59845b04e83828aa	I, have no idea,sorry.

The answer is no, your account will still be playable, but chances are your WOTLK characters wont be playable.
xHOuITo9aa	No. Sims 2 originally came out on the PC, they have since put it out for Macs. Xbox 360, PS3, and older games can be found for the PS2, Game Cube, and Original Xbox.

KSsOiWj1aa	CoD WaW by far. I hate how in Halo if you have a good game of team slayer, you can level down, just because someone else died 20+ times. I also like how you can unlock weapons perks etc instead of the whole game being dictated by who has all the power weapons in halo. Plus there are nowhere near as many swearing little kids playing CoD as well lol.|`|0wQF2Gw2aa	Mate , ive got a ps3 but i know from friends that HALO is the way to go !!!!!!!!!|`|77888b8968225c1f2e5a53c6ca85ccefaa	Definitely Halo 3. No more debate.<br>  <br>  World at War is runs on the same engine as COD4, but is definitely not as good. However, I believe that COD4 is almost as good as Halo 3, but Halo 3's combat approaches are much more creative and fun, with bigger environments. Halo 3 is also much better for online matchmaking on Xbox LIVE. The campaign storyline for halo 3 is also much better.<br>  <br>  Call of Duty World at War's approach at combat in the campaign is very dull, and usually consists of a certain number of enemies charging at you from the same direction, until you cross an invisible line, and go to the next checkpoint. Halo's combat is much more intuitive, and involves more tactics, and the campaign never feels the same twice.|`|J3Eu0O0Raa	Halo 3 by far, COD5 is okay at best, the only thing that saves it from not being "another WWII" game is the zombie mode.  That is fun but it does not match up to Halo.  COD4 might give Halo a run for its money, but World at War was no good in comparison|`|HMLPNOqGaa	Halo 3, <br>  <br>  It's not that Cod WAW is a bad game. I Mean, don't get me wrong - zombie mode and Online maps are great. It's Just there's no.. Pi-zazz to it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Halo 3 is different and a Unique game.<br>  <br>  <br>  Some times Playing in a Modern or World War 1 or 2 <br>  <br>  It's Just Boring because Call of duty series are, and So is Medal of Honour, and Couple others....|`|cO10thlnaa	It's all about your preference, really.<br>  Halo is more of a rush in and kill everyone who is not on your team type of game, where as Call of Duty tends to be a bit more tactical than that.|`|ZqI66ke1aa	Depends<br>  <br>  Halo for Xbox freakin awesome but Call of Duty World At War amazing online play so if your looking for online play pick Call of duty<br>  if not pick Halo then.

3SQ5RNIPaa	io ti consiglio di comprarli entrambi,xk: funky business ti aiuta a fare piu soldi,infatti puoi aprire una tua attività e guadagnare tanto, anke pets è divertente alcuni dicono k è l'espansione piu bella di tutte infatti puoi creare fino a 10 animali da coccolare e nutrire......buon acquisto|`|467433ac604e52695524e87a0f917cf7aa	pets!|`|j5D3jIOdaa	io ho funky businness..è troppo caruccio!!!in  pratica è come se ti apri una attività e devi portarla avanti, guadagni soldi o vai in perdita.. Sims stanno lavorando per te! Per la prima volta i tuoi Sims potranno aprire e gestire una loro propria attività: una boutique trendy, un salone di bellezza, un negozio di computer, un bar, una galleria d’arte alternativa o la più grande catena di negozi di dolci. Inventa splendidi interni per il tuo negozio così da attirare più gente possibile, sii gentile e dai servizi ai tuoi clienti fidati o seduci gli acquirenti per fidelizzarli. E quando l’attività inizia a crescere, assumi dei dipendenti, ma tienili sempre d’occhio e mostra a loro chi è il capo. Non lasciarti sfuggire i furbacchioni che guardano con troppo interesse la cassa e licenziali in tronco. In questa favolosa espansione potrai sfruttare i talenti dei tuoi Sims per produrre oggetti di altissima qualità da mettere poi in vendita nel tuo negozio: disegna vestiti, crea pietanze speciali, fai a mano regali o oggetti esotici. Sviluppa le abilità dei tuoi personaggi portandoli da semplici principianti a maestri veri e propri, o ispirali a creare preziosi e costosissimi oggetti che possano far guadagnare Simoleon a palate. Fai intraprendere ai tuoi Sims la via della ricchezza creando così un impero economico, oppure osserva ogni cosa fallire di fronte ai loro occhi, mentre si preparano a vivere la loro prossima grande esperienza.<br>  <br>  Caratteristiche principali<br>  <br>      * Crea un’attività in proprio per i Sims Apri una varietà di ristoranti, bar o negozi tipici. Assumi del personale competente e attrai nuovi clienti per far crescere l’attività. Riconosci i tuoi clienti: quelli fedeli e quelli che si lamentano sempre… Scrivi affascinanti recensioni e promuovi il tuo business con cartelloni, pubblicità e spot in TV.<br>      * Trasforma il talento dei tuoi Sims in… Simoleon! I Sims talentuosi possono produrre vestiti, cibo, giocattoli, robots, fiori e molto altro. Sviluppa le abilità dei tuoi personaggi per produrre oggetti ricercati e costosi. Trasmetti il talento e le ricette segrete da una generazione Sim all’altra. Sfrutta i momenti in cui i tuoi Sims sono maggiormente ispirati per liberare talenti speciali. Libera i talenti speciali per creare oggetti impressionanti ed eccezionalmente creativi!<br>      * Vai a fare shopping con i tuoi Sims: troverai più di cento nuovi oggetti Visita i negozi del centro: ti sentirai subito meglio. Se sarai un buon compratore, farai ottimi affari e sbloccherai nuovi oggetti. Espandi la tua attività commerciale scaricando nuovi negozi dalla sezione “Scambi” del sito ufficiale. I nuovi oggetti includono manichini, banconi, apparecchiature chimiche, insegne personalizzabili, registratori di cassa, porte di sicurezza e altro ancora.<br>  mente pets,bè, devi accudire gli animali...è simile all'altro the sims!io poi mi sono presaanche university e quello con gli accessori di vestiario...bellissimi!!<br>  bacini!|`|twAZAMajaa	Funky business è molto carino,puoi aprirti un'attività commerciale in casa o acquistando un lotto comunitario,Pets nn ce l'ho ancora nn so come sia..Xò la mia preferita è University,se nn l'hai installata te la consiglio|`|82G2EonRaa	Funky Business!!!

YI2oaoQIaa	The White Mushroom:<br>  This is the mushroom with the red hat and white robes who is the one that most people will likely encounter first in the game. The only way to defeat them is to use magic, and the mystery is what magic to use and how many times.<br>  <br>  How to Defeat it and get Treasure:<br>  <br>  You must successfully cast 3 spells that correspond with the mushroom's mood:<br>  <br>  Fire: Use when it crosses its arms and looks like it's shivering.<br>  Blizzard: Use when it leans back and fans itself.<br>  Thunder: Use when it has a light over its head.<br>  Cure: Use when it has fallen on the ground.<br>  Aero: Use when it is spinning in place.<br>  Stop: Use when the mushroom has frozen in mid-move.<br>  Gravity: Use when the mushroom is floating in mid-air.<br>  <br>  Summon: There is no summon mood for the mushroom. For example, even though Mushu's fire attack is a fire elemental attack, it is pointless to use this on the mushroom when it shivers because you will receive no item for using the fire attack on the mushroom even though it will appear as though you were successful because the mushroom won't disappear. Summon's against mushrooms are a waste of your time.<br>  <br>  If you hit the mushroom with 3 spells, but did not receive the special item "Mystery Goo", and received some other random item instead, then it is because those three spells were not all three the same exact spell so the percent-rate was lower.<br>  <br>  In the Japanese release version, 3 of the same magic spell on the mushroom gave a 100-percent-rate of dropping a "Mystery Goo". The USA-KH version was tweaked some and the drop rate for "Mystery Goo" is somewhat lower. So. Since the majority of you reading this have the USA version, the best way to get "Mystery Goo" is to cast 3 of the same spell on any mushroom, as that yields the highest drop rate for the Mystery Goo item.<br>  <br>  On another note regarding 3 of the same spell castings, if you were to cast 3 fire spells for example, then not only might the mushroom drop a Mystery Goo item, but also a Fire Gem (because you used 3 fire spells) but also a "Fire Arts". The same applies to all the other spells, that 3 Blizzard spells will produce a "Blizzard Arts", and thunder with a gem and arts, but Gravity/Stop/Aero/Cure don't have "Gems" but do drop random items and do have "Arts. All seven spells have "Arts", "Gravity Arts", "Stop Arts", etc.<br>  <br>  As far as the "Arts" are concerned, these are useful in that if you collect all 7, and get all max level spells (Firaga, Thundaga, Curaga, etc) you will recieve the Shield of Dreams from Merlin in Traverse Town if you go speak to him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mushroom Locations and Moods:<br>  <br>  All Mushroom locations usually have Fire/Thunder/Blizzard moods. These are marked with a (*). Extra moods are listed next to the asterisks, such as (*/Cure) denotes a location with Fire, Thunder, Blizzard, and Cure.<br>  <br>  <br>  Traverse Town Hotel - Red Room - (*)<br>  <br>  Wonderland - Lotus Forest - (*)<br>  <br>  Deep Jungle - Outside of Tent (*/Cure)<br>  <br>  Deep Jungle - Jungle Hideout - (*/Cure) In the main room with the hole in the floor.<br>  <br>  Hades Cup - #7 Tier - (No Treasure Dropped)<br>  <br>  Atlantica - Undersea Cave - (*/Stop) - Area on the way to Triton's palace,<br>  marked with two tridents pointing into a small cave.<br>  <br>  Atlantica - The Shipwreck, Below deck - (*/Stop)<br>  <br>  Agrabah - Treasure Room - (*/Gravity) - Cave of Wonders area, with the mountains of gold.<br>  <br>  Halloween Town - Graveyard (*/Aero) - This is the first section of the Graveyard just past the gates into it.<br>  <br>  End of the World - Room Before Last Rest Save Point (*/Stop/Aero/Gravity/Cure)<br>  <br>  <br>  Extra Tips:<br>  <br>  - There is one mood that really isn't a mood at all. The mushrooms do it just to throw you off. This is when they freeze in place for a second and look around like they are confused. This mood is sometimes followed by the mushroom getting bored and walking around for a few seconds. Just keep them targetted and follow them so they are still in your line of sight.<br>  <br>  - Pick one mushroom and stick with him. The mushrooms sometimes spawn close together and area spells sometimes hit another mushroom you don't have targeted.<br>  <br>  - Try to get all the "Arts" and "Mystery Goo" you need before you complete the Hollow Bastion. From my own personal experience, it is a lot harded to find White Mushrooms because the percent-rate for the Rare Truffles (another type of mushroom) is much higher after this point in the game.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Black Fungus<br>  This mushroom looks just like the white mushroom except it is wearing dark blue and black robes with a purple hat. However, to kill these you don't need to use magic, but you can if you want. Depending on what part of the game you fight them in, and your character's levels, the only advantage fighting them usually yields is experience points.<br>  <br>  How to Defeat it and get Treasure:<br>  <br>  Rarely will the Black Fungus drop a Mystery Goo. It is theorized that the percent-rate of the drop-rate is much higher if you use critical hits and combo chains to damage them and critical hits to kill them. <br>  One of the most rare items in the game is one called "Mystery Mold". It is much like "Pretty Stone" that you find in the beginning of the game in a chest. Other than to just have it in your inventory if you are a completeist, they sell for 9999 in Traverse Town's shop. But if you are in dire need of money, don't take this route. You'd be lucky to even ever get a Mystery Goo from a Black Fungus, much less to ever even see a Mystery Mold.<br>  <br>  A few tips for easier ways to kill these guys are as follows. Use the Trinity Limit if you have it. This should kill the Black Fungus outright. If you run into them in Halloween Town, use the exploding pumpkins to your advantage. They also kill the Black Fungus in one hit. Use Stop magic, then attack them. Or, if you are low on HP or are just tired of fighting them because of their poisonous attacks, let Donald and Goofy do the work for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mushroom Locations:<br>  <br>  Halloween Town - Pumpkin Patch - This is the area with the twirly bridge thing that three little kids walk over. The spawn rate isn`t very high, but the Black Fungus does spawn here.<br>  <br>  End of the World - Room Before Last Rest Save Point - Spawns all mushrooms so it drops the chances of getting only Black Fungi. Still fairly quick.<br>  <br>  Agrabah - Bazaar - This is the far right and back area accessible only via one route.<br>  <br>  Pegasus Cup - #5 Tier - Ah, the annoying battle which makes the speed battle for this cup rather annoying at times.<br>  <br>  Hallow Bastion - Dungeon<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Rare Truffle:<br>  These guys look just like the others, except they were blue robes and a yellow hat (and are replicas of the Final Fantasy 1 black mage). They jump around the place, and the only way to defeat them is to keep them in the air with air combo attacks or to cast an Aero spell on yourself and keep yourself under them at all times, bouncing them back up into the air.<br>  <br>  How to Defeat it and get Treasure:<br>  <br>  If it is Mystery Goo, extra items, and experience points you're after, this is the mushroom you want to fight.<br>  <br>  Like the White Mushroom, they are however, pretty easy once you know the trick, and that trick is to bounce them up in the air over and over and over again of which there are a few ways.<br>  <br>  UpperCut Trick:<br>  <br>  - When you come upon a Rare Truffle spawn, you must first lock on to one of the Truffles with lock on, abosultely needed.<br>  <br>  - Watch as the Truffle jumps, when it lands, run up to it and smack it once and only once. You notice that when you hit it, it bounces into the air, despite the fact it was on the ground before.<br>  <br>  - Anyway, you have just smacked the truffle in the air. What you want to do now is wait a split second then jump after the truffle and attack it in the air before it comes back and hits the ground.<br>  <br>  - You need to jump and then tap the attack button once. This will have you attack with an uppercut attack, and not the aerial spin attack, if you have that ability equipped. If you attacked with an aerial spin, it`s because you didn`t jump before hitting the attack button.<br>  <br>  <br>  Flying Neverland Trick:<br>  <br>  Since you can fly here, you can simply fly up and keep smacking Truffles with impunity. Some limitations apply, in that you have a little less control of which way a Truffle will bounce up, and you have to watch out for running into background scenery.<br>  <br>  <br>  Aero Trick:<br>  <br>  This is perhaps the easiest one, cast your version of Aero and run up and touch the Truffle. Into the air it goes. Stand under it, bounce it, recast Aero as needed before it runs out to extend bounce sessions as needed and reap easy rewards.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ragnarok Trick:<br>  <br>  Use in conjunction with the Uppercut Trick, select Raganarok and let it rip on a Truffle. Make sure you pull off the entire combo. Good finisher, lots of hits.<br>  <br>  You get treasure based on how many times you hit and bounce a Truffle:<br>  <br>    10 times - 1 Mystery Goo + 1 Elixir<br>    50 times - 1 Mystery Goo + 1 Elixir + Shiitake Scroll<br>  100 times - 1 Mystery Goo + 1 Last Elixir + Matsutake Scroll<br>  <br>  The scrolls items, like the other special items are again, not much worth, the game explanation simply noting that these scrolls show your ability in being a master of bouncing the Truffle 50 or 100 times.<br>  - An interesting extra, the scrolls (Shiitake/Matsutake) are names after actual types of Japanese mushrooms.<br>  <br>  <br>  Finally, juggling Rare Truffles nets huge amounts of experience. Where N equals the number of times you bounced a mushroom, you gain N(N+1)/2 experience for each juggling sessions. What that means is, for a 100 hit juggle, you will gain 5050 experience! Easily the fastest way to level up in the game should you get ahold of enough Rare Truffles. Combine this with fighting Rare Truffles in the Collesieum (as well as hitting pause right before a battle ends to redo a Rare Truffle battle) and you can make max level in less than an hour or two.<br>  <br>  Mushroom Locations:<br>  <br>  End of the World - Room Before Last Rest Save Point - Again, the save reload or respawn trick here. Easiest place to fight the Truffles outside of the Collieseum with the Uppercut trick.<br>  <br>  Neverland - Deck of Ship - This is the area you fight Captain Hook, tho of course you will not see Truffle`s here the first time you get there. The ship structure makes straight up truffle fighting really not easy, but there is always the option of flying for a real air combo as per the above trick. Spawn rates are seemingly good.<br>  <br>  Halloween Town - Area Right Before Boogie`s House - This is the area with the short bridge and the water passage which leads back to the fountain in Guillotine Sqaure. Spawn rates seem very small, but its possible to find Rare Truffles here. Geography can make fighting here easy or hard. Easy because you can trap Truffles in the corners of the sewer area where the spawn. Hard because the camera can go crazy in those areas. Note, if you hit a Truffle onto a slope, and it slides down and you hit it before it hits the water it DOES NOT count as the Truffle touching land and disappearing.<br>  <br>  Hercules Cup - #6 Tier - I highly recommend beating the time attack for this cup so you can freely select to battle Truffles here. Of course no dropped items, but practicing here is mad exp and is good for training for the Uppercut Trick.<br>  <br>  Hades Cup - #46 Tier - You can fight this one fairly easily without having to do time attacks to get the selectable battle option. But really, if you have the Hades Cup open, the Hercules time attack should be doable.<br>  <br>  Monstro - Throat - They appear here, in the area before the Monstro main fight.<br>  <br>  <br>  Truffle Tips:<br>  <br>  This is the Truffle that once you got your jump then attack rythym down (assuming using the Uppercut Trick), you will have the Mystery Goo's rolling in. I was fighting them once and checked how many I had, and my count was at 22! Enough to make enough Attack Point items to max out Sora`s attack level at 100;p During a typical fight don`t expect to get much more than 4-6 Mystery Goo's however, as getting the 100 combo limit takes some time, and you only have enough time to combo two Truffles up to 100 before the others dissappear (this is assuming no mistakes on your part, and not accidently hitting other Truffles as you combo the Truffle you have locked onto..a fairly common occurence. But as with White Mushrooms, centering one mushroom at a time is important for success). Still, it`s much faster than beating up other mushroom Heartlesses.<br>  <br>  Third, a note on combo`ing the Truffles. You can bounce them fairly high, but you don`t really want them flying too high, which is what happens when you hit them offscreen (the uppercut attack, especialy with the longer keyblades has an insane vertical attack range from somewhere at Sora`s knees to 2 body lengths above him and can easily hit off screen Truffles). Now, The auto-tracking for attacks (not the camera strangely enough) in game is superb and will often track things way over your head in battle, but its still possible to lose Truffles you bounce too high. So when you combo a Truffle, make sure he is on screen when you hit him. Don`t worry, you will hit a Truffle if you let him drop in altitude before you swing, as Sora`s uppecut hits a larger area than you may think (as written above). Less of a problem if you are flying in Neverland, and less if you are using the Aero trick. Something that will likely happen if you use Ragnarok though.<br>  <br>  Last, you may want to pre-kit your character ability-wise for fighting Rare Truffles if you expect an encounter. Namely, un-euipping the Glide party ability helps (Fast Glide is ok, but the normal Glide is bound to the jump button tho). Also, un-equipping the Aerial-Sweep ability from Sora`s list can help as you will want to be hitting with an upper-cut, not an aerial spin anyway. This assuming Uppercut again, for all the other tricks no kitting is really nessecary.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  General Hints:<br>  - All of the mushroom Heartless are timed battles. If you take too long they will dissappear. Doesn`t usually happen with Black Fungus, but is something you will happen with White Mushroom hunting a lot.<br>  <br>  - White Mushrooms and Rare Truffles will, 100% chance, dissappear without dropped items if you don`t use the proper attacks.<br>  <br>  - You may want to summon something when fighting some mushroom (especially White Mushrooms). Reason being, Donald and Goofy will often do a superb job of blocking your view on whats going on, and thus aught to be removed. At decent level, a single summon will last you long enough to take out 1-2 mushrooms. Recommendations go to Mushu (white mushrooms) or Bambi.<br>  <br>  - In order to help spawn some mushrooms in the world areas, realize that once you beat completely beat a battle in one small area of the game (i.e. outside the tent area in the Deep Jungle world), a new battle will not respawn until you run 2 areas away from area you want respawned with new monsters. So in the tent area case, running to the first bamboo forest area and back will not respawn the monsters at the tent, but running to the area where you fight Clayton and back will. An easy way to get new monsters. Also an easy way to level up in certain places of the game which allow you to run in circular patterns, thus constantly spawning monsters.<br>  The only area in the game where this works differently is at the the room before the last save at End of The World. This room will ALWAYS spawn new monsters, whether you ran 1 or 2 areas away from it.<br>  <br>  - The End of the World room before the last save is most easily taken advantage of spawn-wise for mushrooms by first saving the game at last save. Then run into the room before this. If the desired mushrooms aren`t there, simply reset with the quick reset option. This is NOT the reset button on the PS2, rather push and hold START + SELECT + R1 + R2 + L1 + L2. This will take you straight to the New Game/Load Game screen. For some reason, tho you can use the area respawn trick for this room, reloading over and over again is almost always quicker. I believe there is something in the coding for how the game parcels out mushrooms encounters, in that it gives a higher chance of a mushroom encounter if you have just arrived at the world, and not if you have been actively looking for mushroom encounters.<br>  <br>  - Alternately, for Mushroom Spawn points that are close to save points, you can respawn monster areas without fighting by checking out and area, leaving, riding your Gummi Ship then re-entering the world with the spawn point you are trying to hit up for world areas like End of the World, or the Deep Jungle White Mushroom spawn point.<br>  <br>  - There is seems to be alot of random chance in finding a mushroom encounter. Knowing this will help you tear out less hair.<br>  <br>  - Finally, if you do end up fighting for mushrooms at the End of the World alot. Be aware that mushrooms aren`t the only special items you can collect there. The devil and angel monsters which spawn the most at End of the World will infrequently give out Orichalcum and Mythril in addition to their normally dropped Gale. So doing the normal respawn fighting while looking for mushroom spawns may make sense, if you are keen on maxing out your level/attack/defense/AP parameters, rather than relying on the quicker save/reload trick for mushroom only encounters.|`|rpjI19fYaa	make sure all of your party characters have abilities equipped and items held that increase luck, and just keep trying...it took me 3 hours to finally get the mystery goo so just be patient and keep at it...you will get it eventually|`|p7ehOz4Caa	i dont know i havent played it in a long time.|`|S4NbEdK3aa	that is the best games ever. sadly i do not know because it has been so long since i last played it

GLN7arAeaa	le tue valutazioni sono giuste...ma in un gioco di calcio è fondamentale la giocabilità..|`|fx7Z8FGoaa	Infatti, concordo con te, quest'anno la sfida l'ha vinta fifa 08!|`|qovfv1O6aa	beh...difficile a dirsi però dikono in giro ke pes 2008 sia peggiorato...per l'uniko anno dellla mia vita voto fifa|`|Dd6faGypaa	mi dispiace contraddirti !! ma PES 4EVER !!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Dal vicino caminetto viene giù un angioletto l'ho mandato di nascosto a dar gioia in ogni posto tanta gioia e tanto amore agli amici che ho nel cuore... Buon Natale!|`|XqeFZSlyaa	fifa 2008 il migliore!!!|`|XrfpVhY3aa	Io li ho entrambi e posso dirti con assoluta convinzione che se vuoi davvero divertirti gioca a Pes2008 (Mitico), se poi ti interessa esclusivamente la grafica condivido le tue ragioni in quanto in Fifa08 la risoluzione è migliore..|`|eft7JQPmaa	Veramente pes è peggiorata tantissimo !!!<br>  Passa a fifa08 !!|`|3HdsHSQVaa	pes 2008 per ps3 è bellissimo nn si blocca,grafica stupenda e gran giocabilita ,ki se ne frega se nn ci sono tt le squadre,mike gioco cn il djungarden!?!?!|`|QwPmljdeaa	TI dirò, Konami, a cui sono devoto da 7 anni, dove per 2 anni ho fatto le selezioni per qualificarmi a Roma e volare a Parigi ai mondiali, io, che ho l'onore di aver affrontato Auron, the legend e altri miti del gioco nipponico, io... ti dirò che quest'anno ho provato Pro Evolution soccer 2008, anzi lo voglio chiamare Pro Evolution soccer 6... perchè è uguale, con l'unica differenza che puoi decidere chi sta in barriera...anzi...puoi pure simulare un fallo, e 3 volte su 2 ti becchi un ammonizione, cmq per il resto è uguale per play 2. Per play 3 c'ho giocato da amici, risultando bello graficamente ma molto arcade. Insomma, il giorno dopo aver provato questo gioco copia dell'anno scorso mi decisi di provare Fifa 2008. Fifa 2008, cross manuale, passaggio manuale ecc insomma copiato da Pro evolution, tasti L1+X per il triangolo, XO per il doppio pressing ecc copiati da pro evolution, aggiungi però i 30 campionati su licenza, aggiungi i cori da stadio, insomma è meglio di pro evolution, inoltre non è arcade. La giocabilità è realistica, e a fatica si riesce a livello intermedio ad andare oltre l'1a0, insomma come nella realtà. Poi c'è la modalità Be e Pro in cui vesti i panni di un giocatore (si si può fare anke con pro, basta andare nel controllo giocatori, ma non è la stessa cosa, perchè è finalizzato a una partita, Be a Pro invece vieni proprio catapultato per una stagione a vestire i panni di un giocatore), insomma modalità di gioco nuove. Riassumiamo: Pro evolution VANTAGGI: si segna facilmente SVANTAGGI: è un gioco arcade senza licenze. FIFA 2008 VANTAGGI: è realistico, si segna difficilmente, ha licenze, cori da stadio, modalità aggiuntive ecc SVANTAGGI: grafica non realistica, (ma neanke Pro la ha, visto che i giocatori sembrano robot), ed è difficile segnare (lo so, l'ho messo nei vantaggi, ma dipende dai punti di vistaDX)insomma come nella realtà. IO ORA TI DICO: DECIDI TU. se vuoi un gioco arcade, o un gioco realistico. Sperando ke konami migliori e torni ad essere il numero uno. Un saluto a tutti quelli ke ti dicono Pro senza aver provato fifa!<br>  mi sembra ti averti chiarito un po le ideee!!!! ciao!!!|`|nfFfVOaNaa	sicuramente pes2008|`|q1FICFvUaa	ok ok fifa è meglio<br>  però adesso calmati!!!|`|vDqUPivRaa	Io ho sia Fifa 08 che Pes 08 e trovo che la giocabilità di Pes sia molto peggiorata rispetto al Pes 6..... comunque credo che il migliore sia sempre e comunque Pes
AA10010715	It was on EA Link on release day.  Perhaps they have had too many people trying to download it and it's down for some reason.  It might be that you forgot the Bon in Bon Voyage.  Try looking for that instead.

Play and finish Kingdom Hearts 1, then you can go buy Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories and play it, then you can finally start playing Kingdom Hearts 2. By doing this you can really get to know the story and plot.<br>  <br>  And the game itself is a lot of fun. The graphics are really good and using cards to fight is also really fun. You also get to visit worlds from Kingdom Hearts 1 and you get to battle new enemies, including the rest of Organization XIII that weren't in Kingdom Hearts 2. It's a pretty cool game to play and it's also the same price as the other two Kingdom Hearts games.|`|TMQB8ASPaa	definatly get it its not the same as the gba version theres so much more to it. you will also love it and not regret getting it|`|0noe4aoKaa	I would say don't buy it. Me and my friend had bought CoM for the GBA when it first came out and it's ok, i guess.. and if you get the one for the PS2, it's the same storyline and when you go through all the worlds, it just seems as the same as the first Kingom Hearts... Sorry to burst your bubble, but it you want it to go together with your collection, then buy the version at some cheaper price at some other store..|`|VV74ysCmaa	I think it's fun because instead of just fighting, you get a bit of a mental challenge by selecting cards to perform your attacks. It also helps tie up the loose ends between KH1 and KH2, and it introduces the Organization and Namine.

D6si4NfYaa	for the zwinky <br>  <br>  the phrase says below the "button"
z2LGqY0Gaa	Well it depends on what console you are talking about, which is probably the ps2 considering the particular ddr title?  My ps2 can still read this old game shark cd that has a giant crack in it and it scratched up badly.  Some of the new games don't work because the laser in my system is going bad.  When ps2s go bad there are a lot of things that happen.  If you play dvds or cds on it, the life of the laser goes down.  Ps2s especially can do weird things.  First usually the ability to read cds or blue discs quits, then it's followed by the dual layered discs that have gold surfaces, then there's the regular dvd disc games.  Sometimes my ps2 would read a dvd disc game but not a dvd movie.  Sometimes it would read everything but one game or just one game and nothing else.  Either way, it sounds like your laser is going bad.  Yeah it'll read some old games for some odd reason and at some point will fail to read any new ones, they are just a little fickle when they wear out.  Maybe your ps2 has a special attachment to ddr like mine has one to that cracked game shark disc.  :)  <br>  If you aren't talking about the ps2, then some of the same rules still apply, consoles are a lot alike when they fail.  I had a copy of GTAIV that just didn't want to run and there really wasn't anything wrong with the disc, my 360 was just being a picky piece of crap.
z2LGqY0Gaa	The 360s that are new on the shelf now have all the same insides, although at one point the elites were said to have the better components.  The fact of the matter is that 360s still break a lot more than they should so it's hard to say that a new one won't break.  We sold a brand new one to a guy and out of the box it had the red rings as soon as he hooked it up and that was only a few months ago.  I have an elite I got in July 07 and it's broken 5 times, the first time a month after I bought it.  We just bought a new elite for my boyfriend and it is doing fine so far.  Then again some people with older systems have never had problems and some have them all the time.  They have fixed some problems that have caused massive failure in the 360s but no one version sold now is any different from the others.  Also keep this in mind, microsoft has removed the 3 year warranty on new systems for the rrod and the 2 year for regular malfunctions.  There is a 3 month factory warranty on the system and that is it.  I believe that you can pay 60 for an extended 2 years but that is the only reason for the recent price drop.  You should get the Elite because it sounds like you want it more, and there really isn't a difference besides the stuff you get.  Yeah, don't buy a fan for it, even if you don't plan on buying the extended warranty cause it's just not good for it.  If you are strapped for cash and want the arcade bundle then you can look out for special deals on hdds.  A few weeks ago microsoft had an offer to upgrade arcade bundles with refurbished hard drives and a live membership for pretty cheap.  So if you are thinking one of these models will not break more over the pro system then consider the pro system.  Also, if your current broken system is a pro system then find out a few answers, how old is your current system? If it is kind of old then if you send it into microsoft, they will send you a refurb of the same model, so buying a new pro system can make a difference in the hard ware.  If your system is newer, consider sending it into microsoft (1-800-4mybox) it costs about 100 bucks to fix.  There are many factors to consider when buying a new 360 but hopefully this has helped you realize some of them and can make it easier for you to decide what to do with your situation.|`|gcs54mvUaa	buy the elite and a fan to keep it cool|`|9j7B9Dhjaa	actually theres really no differance, besides memory of course, microsoft fixed the whole heating up problem so if you buy a new xbox it shouldnt heat up. apparently it had metal in it, but they fixed it. <br>  <br>  btw do not buy a fan! it voids your warranty and makes thinks worse because it makes the xbox work 2x harder than b4
m1DuVX9Qaa	Ask yourself this<br>  <br>  1. Is the disc scratched?<br>  2. Are the instruments plugged in?<br>  3. Could any of the instruments get damaged where you kept them?<br>  4. Is the warranty on the items still active?<br>  <br>  Or you can learn to play Guitar Hero acoustically
