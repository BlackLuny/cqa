20090223155531AAvO4a9	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	How do you keep beans from splitting during cooking?	When I cook black beans and white beans they end up splitting. The skin is still tough, but the inside is mushy. I soaked them for about 6-7 hours (today I made great northern beans) and then cooked them for about 2 hours now (in a cast iron/enamel) pot with two inches of water over the beans  (and no salt yet). They don't seem done, but they're all split in half. :-(      I really want to make good beans, but all of this soaking and cooking to end up with crunchy, not so pretty beans makes canned beans look more appealing.       Do pressure cookers really cook beans in 10 minutes or so after it's brought up to pressure? That sounds easier and the results might be more predictable.

20081107173521AAA63kV	Food & Drink;Ethnic Cuisine	What was this pastry at the Chinese restaurant?	I recently had a wonderful cake/pastry like item from a Chinese buffet. They had a sign that said "lover flower".It had two layers of phyllo dough (or something similar) on the outside that had been place in a muffin pan and the points came slightly over the cup to make the petals.  Then a batter was poured in to make a very light cake that was moist and lightly sweet, and baked until light brown. The finished cake/muffin looked very much like a yellow cake mix cake looks but very light. Maybe rice flour? A friend says the sweetness could be from bean curd?       I asked the server but she did not know. She said she thought it was an egg custard. It did not have a custard consistency but it did have an egg custard taste.      I would love to have this recipe but cannot find anything for "lover flower" or anything I might think it is.
