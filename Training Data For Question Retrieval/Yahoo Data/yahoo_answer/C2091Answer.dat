This feature is MAINLY for inviting people who are already in your Yahoo! Mail address book OR your Yahoo! Messenger buddy list.<br>  - Or go to a friend's page and click the "Add" link under their personal profile picture and make sure to check the "Invite As a Friend" box before sending the invitation. <br>  <br>  In all cases, the person needs to go to their 360 mailbox and ACCEPT the invitation so that they show up in your contact list, friends list, and friends module.<br>  <br>  If everyone is connected to each other, then you will see a "blue person icon" next to their name under the "Contacts" box (left side, bottom) on your 360 "Home" page. They will also appear in your Friends module on the Top Page. If you see a green cross, either one of you hasn't accepted (or sent) an invitation. That can happen if you click the "Add" link under a person's profile picture on their 360 page and chose to send the invitation as a FAVORITE, rather than a FRIEND. This means you opted not to select the "Invite as a Friend" box before submitting the invite. People are also Favorites until they accept your invitation. See <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/ca/yahoo/360/friends/friends-12.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/ca/yahoo/360/fri...</a> for more information about Favorites. You can have up to 300 connections, but only 100 outstanding invitations at once.<br>  <br>  There are communications settings to consider - click your "Edit Contact Settings" link under your personal profile picture on the "My Page." Make sure they are set to "Everyone in 360" for now (or "Friends of Friends" if you are under age 18). You can always change it whenever you want.<br>  <br>  If you find that your invitation isn't working, it could be for the following reasons:<br>  1) If a person's Yahoo! 360 page is not activated, you will not be able invite them. It will say that they are not accepting invitations at this time. Everyone has 360 attached to their Yahoo account,  but it stays dormant until it is activated (i.e. used for the first time). If the invite is sent to an address other than a Yahoo-related one, then it won't work.<br>  2) If they have an activated 360 page, but their Communications Settings are set to "Friends of Friends" instead of "Everyone 360" in terms of invitations - and you are not a "Friends of Friends" - then your invitation will not be received.<br>  3) They denied the invitation, which you should be notified about. The invitation is removed from both the person's inbox and your sent mail.<br>  4) You are on the person's "ignore" list, thus communications from you are not received. See <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/friends/friends-04.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/fri...</a> for more information.<br>  5) People are having problems with their mailboxes that could prevent the sending and receiving of messages for a long time.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  TO DISPLAY LINK TO YOUR 360 SPACE ON YOUR YAHOO!

suPD7c3gaa	You can't find it or you don't remember what it is?  Assuming it's the same log on you use for Yahoo! Answers, you should be able to "find" it.  Considering it's a web site, it's really not something you can lose.  Just go the www.yahoo.com and click on "Mail".  Chances are if you're already logged into the account, it'll bring you directly to your mail page.  If not, it'll bring you to the log on page where you type in your Yahoo user ID and password.

The organization has reformed the youth prospective in doing more positive activities, which gear towards more positive outcomes. This years event will begin the foundation of what the organization represents and stabilizes the community with unity forever.

Our senior citizens, youth, low-income families and children are in need of a health care plan that will give them a more reliable source that will make doctor visit more effective. I believe your organization can make a pivotal impact on this event.  Also, to guide many more people in obtaining a more valuable health care plan.

Then go to your profile, scroll down, click 'My Question', click the question you want to choose best answer for. Under all of your answers it will say 'Best Answer'. Click that. Then rate how many stars and if you want leave them a little comment.<br>  <br>  If it isn't your questions select the category you want to choose the 'Best Answer' in. Click 'Best Answer' and wa la! Your done!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|4KTe107Yaa	you have to wait 4 hours before you will be allowed to do this. After 4 hours a blue bar will appear under each answer you receive and just click on that blue box that will say CHOOSE BEST ANSWER. You will understand when you see it|`|PN7XMglOaa	I'm glad to help you . What you do is scroll down to my answer , and click on " best answer " , and I get 10 points . Thank you .|`|6qsTmMQaaa	To pick a best answer yourself, you have to wait four hours before the bubbles appear. The bubbles read, "Choose as Best Answer," and they appear under each answer. You click the bubble beneath the answer you like best, and then it will take you to a page, where you need to rate the response, and then leave a message to the asker. Then, you scroll down a little and click SUBMIT. The answerer will receive ten points, and you will receive three.<br>  <br>  To put your question to vote, you can either wait for the time to expire and then vote for the best answer, or you can go to the pencil beneath your question. If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE." Then the question will be put to vote, and you and the Yahoo! Answers community will vote for the best answer. You will still receive three points when the question is resolved.|`|xL6zc0bOaa	Just pick the one who's answer you like the best.

Just read the rules and be careful.

4V9lERvnaa	I don't know but if you start a race by calling Brucie and there's a Blista Compact in the race, you'll see Blista Compacts driving around on your way to the race. If a Blista Compact isn't in the race, the Blista Compact's car type (2-door) might be the cars that your'e racing so you still might see it.<br>  <br>  This is how I got a Comet because I abandoned the Comet that Brucie gave me because I thought I'd get more but I didn't know that there's never supercars driving around on the game. The game was new and I was only on the 1st island (Broker) and thought that there might be different cars on the other islands because there's usually better cars on newer islands.

We had to mentor someone, and write a research paper about their job and things taht tie into it. She really influenced me to pursue my dreams, even though she didn't try. Friends were never an influence on me, because I don't have many friends anymore (by choice, bad influences). Parents never were an influence, mine didn't go to school after high school, and never really push me to follow my dreams, but they would love it if i did they just never show it. So I'd have to say teachers and my mentor have influenced me, by being able to see who I really am under everything, and knowing my true intelligence even when I don't apply myself. I'm now planning on going to college and moving forward even after graduation! :)|`|9XPkCgdAaa	friends...personally, i rebel against my parents and my friends influence my actions.|`|8i76USBBaa	it's a tie between my friends and parents.

AgC8zPemaa	If you mean as it pertains to an individual, then the answer is : almost. Positive energy will overcome negative energy, but it may take many positive acts to overcome the brutal damage of a bad act. If you mean in the universe, then No. The universe does not measure things the way we do. It considers all energy and realizes that positive and negative energy remain at fairly equal levels. When they don't, it becomes a problem. Monumental changes may take place to restore balance or it may happen slowly. It will happen.Some people think we are destroying the earth. We are not. We may render it uninhabitable by human beings, but in a million years or so she will be feeling better and will allow some form of life to live and enjoy her again.|`|6RnwWPObaa	No, a positive action will not erase a bad action, but it can help others to forgive the bad action. Once the bad action is completely forgiven its as good as erased.|`|Q7haeWgvaa	Actually it doesn't, just like a glass once there is a crack already even very small it's always there. But if you had bad action and you tried to cover it with more positive actions, time will come that people around you will  forget the bad action that you did, especially if they see that you're sincere enough to stay away from that bad action. All human being fall and it doesn't matter. What matter most is your inactive to rise and continue doing good.

Having been in "the helping professions" all my life, I think maybe I just don't know how to fully retire from the process, and, as minimally exciting as this might be, it's still a whole lot better than television, and what people call "music" nowadays, so, that's why I return even after reaching "the end of my rope" on several occasions.

7u77AiBjaa	Since there isn't a link to your 360 in your Y/A profile or your question, then it's not easy to confirm that you have activated the 360 service on your account. Double-check that you are using the correct Yahoo services and have followed all the instructions below. Some people confuse the Y!Profile (<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> ) with Yahoo! 360 (<a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> ). If you've done everything, then likely you just have to wait for a change to be recognized:<br>  <br>  <br>  Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes take hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up.

XFZmAMOAaa	90% of the stuff on y/a is unnecessary and most of the answers are unnecessary.Seems to me that if only "serious" questions are allowed on y/a,why have a points system?I find this "game" entertaining and insightful,from the serious questions to the troll questions.I guess other people have their own idea of what is necessary,too bad they see fit to play censor to fit y/a to their idea of what it should be.|`|6014e877df433a9c4aa2133e5b670a4faa	Do I really have to breath to answer this question?

Each user can be a top contributor in a maximum three categories.<br>  You earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a certain section.<br>  The more positively you contribute, the more chance there is that you will get a TC badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to give credit to community members."<br>  <br>  The TC badge is awarded on the number of questions answered and best answers received by the user in a particular week, in a particular category.<br>  <br>  It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 percent best answers in your chosen category to get a TC badge although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret. <br>  All you see and read on the subject is speculation, rumour, assumption, imagination, and guesswork.<br>  <br>  A user who is on the leader board may or may not have a TC badge, the criteria is measured on weekly participation in a particular category (number of answers and % of best answers in the category).<br>  <br>  The easiest way to get a TC badge is to concentrate on one category where many questions are asked and hope to get some best answers.<br>  <br>  The Polls and Surveys and Jokes and Riddles categories do not have Top Contributors.<br>  <br>  If you have contributed enough to meet Yahoo's criteria, the orange badge will appear below your avatar on Monday morning.<br>  <br>  It can disappear just as easily on Monday morning, if you don't keep answering questions in your chosen category.|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	A "Top Contributor" is an expert in from one to three categories.

The cartoon figure is also used in Yahoo Messenger and appears on some customized Yahoo pages. The photo only appears in Yahoo 360 and Yahoo Answers. If you do not have an avatar then a shadow of a male figure appears. It can't be changed to female.<br>  <br>  № 1. If you want a cartoon figure then go to <a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> and create or modify one and then go to № 3. If you create one of the wrong sex then it can be changed in "preferences".<br>  <br>  № 2. If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to upload up to four photos there from your computer. Mark the one you want to use as your avatar as primary.<br>  <br>  № 3. Now for either a cartoon or a photo save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers. Click on your old avatar in Yahoo Answers which brings you to your profile. Now go to "Edit My Info". You can pick the cartoon or photo to use.  BE SURE TO PREVIEW AND SAVE (OK) THE PAGE AT THE BOTTOM.

7u77AiBjaa	People continually have problems using their Yahoo! 360 picture in Yahoo! Answers. Usually, it's just a matter of patiently waiting for the image to show up. The last delay took about two weeks for many people.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if the image is showing above the "Yahoo! 360 image" option or not in your Yahoo! Answers settings. Just choose that option anyway. It sometimes takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up to changes made through Yahoo! 360. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon), words/red "x" in box will show, or an old 360 image will appear. Just go through the process and let your picture stay that way until the Y/A system makes your correct 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then use the Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the Y!360 image (at least for now).<br>  <br>  After a few days of waiting, you can certainly contact Y/A staff by posting a BUG report on the Y/A forum at <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . I recommend putting BUG: to start the title of your message. Also, you can do a search on the forum and add a comment to messages other people have posted about the problem.|`|fmdoGQizaa	Try again. This time, after doing it, read the page that shows up after you press 'Submit', it will give you the option to either 'OK' or 'Modify'.

7u77AiBjaa	Double-check that you are using the correct Yahoo services and have followed all the instructions below. Some people confuse the Y!Profile (<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> ) with Yahoo! 360 (<a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> ). If you've done everything, then likely you just have to wait for a change to be recognized:<br>  <br>  <br>  Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes take hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> .

If you had been getting violations, you finally got one too many.  You can't keep getting minor ones since they review all your account each time.  If you never got a violation, you must have gotten a TOS, the worst kind.<br>  <br>  Did you know that if you claim to be a horse on YA, that is a TOS violation. Also, posting that you are under thirteen is a TOS violation.<br>  <br>  TOS violations are the most serious and they will zap you quick. Most people who get zapped for things other than vile, racist things do one of the following:<br>  <br>  1. Post links or ask for links to copyrighted material, usually music or movies. Giving someone a link to a youtube video of your favorite band is illegal in many cases.<br>  <br>  2. Posting or asking for sites for free but pirated software, giving keys to software, or similar illegal activities.<br>  <br>  3. Asking for people to give them accounts to sites or asking people if you can use their info and account. That is illegal in most cases.<br>  <br>  4. Putting up codes or asking for codes for things like Coke Rewards. That is illegal in most cases.<br>  <br>  5. Posting your website that may have business sections or sells anything. That is solicitation.<br>  <br>  6. Posting links to scams, get rich quick schemes, work at home scams, or spam.|`|rVhrVyRGaa	The following was in the Guidelines at: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_guidelines;_ylt=AkJ053ldcAFfMe6hdiSQj0o_zKIX;_ylv=3">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_...</a><br>   "Violating the Community Guidelines may result in the termination of your Answers account without warning. In extreme cases, violations may result in the termination of your Yahoo! ID, and consequently, access to all other Yahoo! services."<br>  <br>   Maybe one of your answers received too many thumbs down; you said something that went against the guidelines; or an answer was reported for abuse, etc. Try writing an email to Yahoo and ask for the specific reason.|`|1NPVVxW0aa	You may have inadvertantly breaches the TOS, as I did, and discover there is no way of contacting Yahoo to argue it.<br>  <br>  In my case, I 'insulted' someone by saying my opinion of them, who wanted to illegally harm their pregnant dog to abort puppies they could not afford. The scuzzbag objected to me 'being aggressive', I assume for not aggreeing with them,  and Yahoo supported them and gave ME a strike. <br>  <br>  There is no contact or response with Yahoo. It's disgraceful.
colhXvWDaa	Once it has been long enough(4 hours-4 days) you should see under all the answers a blue button that says "choose best answer". Go to the answer that you were planing to pick and click the button. Then rate the answer and say a little bit to the person. Maybe "Thanks!".<br>  <br>  If it is in vote you can not pick best but you can vote for best. Sometimes it takes months for voting to go into resolved because of tiebreakers.<br>  <br>  If the answer is resolved from being put into vote you can not pick a best.<br>  <br>  And you can not pick best answer if it is not your question. The only way you can do this is if you vote for a best.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped!|`|jwoVlmV5aa	When it's reached about maybe three to two days old, then it'll say that you can choose the best answer. Then, you can choose ur best answer!|`|suPD7c3gaa	Once your question has been posted for at least 4 hours, you will see the blue "Choose as Best Answer" button by each answer. After 4 hours have elapsed, just go to your question, then to the answer you want to choose, and click on that button, and follow the steps. If you haven't gotten the answer you need, you can give it a few more days just in case you get more answers, and one that might be better.
