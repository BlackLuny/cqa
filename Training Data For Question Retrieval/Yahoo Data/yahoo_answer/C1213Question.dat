Landing on the Moon      The Saturn V launched from the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, carrying Neil Armstrong, Edwin ‘Buzz’ Aldrin, Michael Collins and support crew. The spacecraft entered orbit 12 minutes after launch and took four days to reach the moon.  During this time Richard Nixon was president, but the speech        "I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth." was delivered by John F. Kennedy eight years before Apollo 11.      On July 20, 1969 Neil Armstrong became the very first to set foot on the moon, along with Edwin Buzz Aldrin while Michael Collins remained in the Command Module in orbit. The primary goal was to land the Lunar Module Eagle on the Lunar Surface witch Armstrong and Aldrin spend 2 ? hours on. During the mission Armstrong piloted the LM, while Aldrin called out navigation data, witch made landing the Eagle successful,       Armstrong then said after the landing of the Eagle    "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."      The team left an American Flag, an Apollo 1 mission patch and a plaque before returning home.       On July 24 the astronauts returned to earth, making a splash landing in Wake Island.       Please Give Feedback

20090205131920AAVRd8T	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Football and physics?	A quarterback claims that he can throw the football a horizontal distance of 196.6 m (215 yd). Furthermore, he claims that he can do this by launching the ball at the relatively low angle of 35° above the horizontal. To evaluate his claim, determine the speed with which this quarterback must throw the ball. Assume that the ball is launched and caught at the same vertical level and that air resistance can be ignored. For comparison, a baseball pitcher who can accurately throw a fastball at 45 m/s (100 mph) would be considered exceptional.

I'm beginning to apply to schools for next fall and I suddenly began second guessing my planned major--teaching.

I am also very interested in the study of whales.      But here's my problem: as passionate as I am, I've just never been a math/science girl.  Math has always been a horrendous struggle for me and I've never made it past geometry and algebra because I suffer from severe dyscalculia.  So I suppose my question is this:  do I have any chance studying marine life?  Is the math far too advanced for me?         Thanks!

I then looked up the classification of crocodiles and alligators, and it looks like they're in the same order: Crocodilia.  I also know that cats and dogs are different species, but in the same order: Carnivora (which also have bears, racoons, and seals).  I don't know much about classification of animals, but would comparing alligators and crocodiles be the same as comparing cats vs. dogs vs. raccoons vs. seals? Are Crocodilia and Carnivora comparable?  Are they the same in difference for the species within, or does "Order" in the classification system not transfer over so well?      Also, how genetically different/similar are crocodiles/alligators?  How different/similar is their internal anatomy?      I just want to have a response for this guy who says crocodiles and alligators are the same species.  What types of mammals would be good comparisons on how closely related they are, and genetics/internal structure?

20090205135945AARdowM	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Biology questions that I'm confused on?	1. In humans, the entire initial RNA molecule codes for amino acids in protein.      Is this true? Personally I think its false, but what confuses me is the "initial" RNA molecule. What is that supposed to mean?      2. You wish to try your hands at predicting the structure of a lysozyme.  Because lysozymes have several weak interactions that contribute to its folded conformation, you have decided first to measure their overall contributions, so that you will know how much leeway there is when it comes to assign values to individual interactions.  Since the stability of a lysozyme is:   deltaG = Go,unfolded – Go,folded   and    Go  = Ho  - TSo      You determine the standard enthalpy,  Ho, a measure of bond strength, and the standard entropy, So , a measure of disorder, for both folded and unfolded states.  Your values (kcal/mole) are shown below for measurements made at 37°C.         Unfolded state:    Ho=113 kcal/mole,  TSo=104 kcal/mole   Folded state:    Ho=60 kcal/mole,  TSo=61 kcal/mole      What is the energetic stability of lysozyme at 37°C?      The correct answer is: _______?   Would it make sense for me to just plug in numbers and solve for delta(G)?      3. On average how often would the nucleotide sequence CGATTG occur in a single DNA strand 8000 bases long? Explain your reasoning.      I'm not sure but I think the answer is something like 1 in (8000^(4*6))      4. During DNA replication in a bacterium, a C is accidentally incorporated instead of an A into one newly synthesized DNA strand. Imagine this error was not corrected and has no effect, positive or negative relative to the wild type on the ability of the progeny to grow and reproduce.      A. This bacterium then divides. What proportion of its progeny would you expect to contain the mutation?        B. What proportion of its progeny would you expect to contain the mutation after three more rounds of DNA replication and cell division?      No clue at all for this last one.      Any help is appreciated. Thanks!

20090205145459AAx2lEb	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Explain the choice of instruments used in the forensic investigation below?	Explain the choice of instruments used in the forensic investigation below?    I carried out three analytical experiments.  Two of the experiments were spectroscopic techniques and one was a chromatographic technique.  In the spectroscopic technique experiments I was provided with river water evidence sample and had to determine whether it was unpolluted (no coloured dye present) or if the sample contains any level of the pollutants in the water.  In the first experiment I used a colorimeter to determine the absorbance values for the river water at a range of wavelengths.  In the second experiment I used a colorimeter again to determine the absorbance values for the water reference samples of known concentration.  In the third experiment I placed the river water sample along with five dyes on a chromatogram to determine which dyes the river water contained.
20090205145501AABsJxf	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Can someone help me with my physics homework?	2. A placekicker must kick a football from a point 36 m from the goal, and half the   crowd hopes the ball will clear the crossbar, which is 3.05 m high. When kicked, the   ball leaves the ground with a speed of 20 m/s at an angle of 530 to the horizontal. (a)   By how much does the ball clear or fall short of clearing the crossbar? (b) Does the   approach the crossbar while still rising or while falling?   First try to solve this problem on a blank sheet of paper without extra hints. Only   later fill in the answers in the space provided on the other side of this sheet. If you   have no clue what to do, you will find hints on the other side.         (b) Hint: calculate vertical component of velocity when reaching the goal. The sign of   it will tell you if the ball is rising or falling.   Category

20090205111631AAgabHj	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Exactly how are quantity discounts calculated?	Today, my customer has asked for a significant discount based on quantity.      It was our policy to grant quantity discounts...but nobody can explain how we come up with the math behind what we offer.       At this time it is critical to hit this job on target.       We are already set up on his job, so the additional quantity wouldn't be a problem.      I understand charging the set up and changeover costs on short run production, but what formula is used to compute the discount amount?      Our asset (or work center) cost is $40/ HR and total process time is 5 minutes.      How can I justify his request based on quantities of 10, 100 and 400 pieces?

20090205140435AA7rIBs	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Help! Math wizzes- this is your calling!?	k. I have an assignment due next week(on Tuesday) that has to do with math, obviously. I have to write 100 in 100 different ways. I already have like...1,2,3, ok! 40 different ways written down. I need like 60 more. I don't actually want you to write 60 ways, don't go that far. I'm not forcing you. But, if you can put at least like 10 ways, I'll be really grateful! That way, the more people who answer, the better. I'll have enough in no time! But, the more you put, the better chance of getting 10 points. I know, it sounds like bribing. I'm really sorry about that. But, there's no way I can explain it in a non-bribing way on the computer. Thank you so much for your help!

Imaine that there are five rectangles where the measure of the length and width of each rectangle is a whole number from 1 to 10, and that you can only use each number once. Now imagine that these five rectangles can be fit together to form a square, with no spaces between the rctangles.  Draw a sketch of this square showing how each rectangle fits.      Please(when you figure it out) send me a picture with your answer. 10 pionts to the best answer.
