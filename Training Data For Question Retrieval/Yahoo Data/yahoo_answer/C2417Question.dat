20090205192054AAGzQ23	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Is there anyone interested in a poem (related to mourning)?	Love. Being gone.   It’s not always enough,   but, to try a song…   Something that would bring a smile to the face.   Wrong, as we know it to be   The wasted moments that it takes “to see”   The life-times spent in pursuit   The grasps of   “a single tyrant” like “a simple task”   A group. A species.      Masked by traits…   Ending up in either this ditch,   Or, beneath that stone   Conclusions of “together” or “alone”   Pitches, tones, behavior…   The Living Human Hymns   Waiting    (humbly? (to become “savior“?))   Broken Promises   “I’ll see you later.”   The ability to lie…   Hatred & their Haters.      To look back on or to have an idea of each and every mistake   … pathways; to making a title out of the word “Great”.

20090205192926AA30h5o	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	I have tried, but I can't take free will seriously.?	If destiny is admixed with randomness, random wins, and cause and effect breaks down. A little law called entropy is involved. If you replace random with CHOICE, you end up in a world devoid of cause and effect.       My world doesn't look like that. If you have a GUN to your head, you are not free. Cause and effect is that gun. Decisions made under duress are not free choices.      Can someone explain, NOT RANT, explain how free will could EVEN work? If you want to present "the miracle of God's gift" answer, save your time, I don't buy it.      Why am I not free to believe in Free Will?

20090205192844AAIW9bX	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	This is an important question about life?	Ok, heh well this is a question that applies to everyone so all should answer. Not to bore you but quickly this is my situation thus far and I can't believe I have done this to myself!      For the past years, I haven't had my own independence because I follow my sister around practically everywhere. And because of that, I do what she likes (things I find really boring) everyday.   Following her has been like hell, because I feel like I never get to do what I want and I get so angry cause of that. And all this time of wishing I were somewhere else, I have thought up some huge dreams for myself. Yet, I remain a quiet, shy person on the outside. But on the inside, I am funny, brutally honest, and I like to talk. I can't believe what an act I even been putting on. Here's the part I want you guys to respond to: By hanging out with all of my sister's friends who shared "conservative" beliefs while I have very liberal beliefs, I feel like I want to get away and in my life, finally enjoy what I want to do. But, I feel embarrassed if they ever found out because how they see me is totally different from what I think. But should I be embarrassed? It hurts me inside when they degrade stuff I like and talk about it so badly, yet I love that stuff but don't keep quiet! (Random example, I love fashion and being fit, yet they say it like it is so retarded to like that kind of stuff.)    Can life do a total 360 and should I be embarrassed of what people think?

20090205192528AA9M4x9	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What type of poem is this?	For Literature, I have to do a poetry project on Spring by Gerard Manley Hopkins.   Nothing is so beautiful as spring—     When weeds, in wheels, shoot long and lovely and lush;     Thrush's eggs look little low heavens, and thrush   Through the echoing timber does so rinse and wring   The ear, it strikes like lightnings to hear him sing;     The glassy peartree leaves and blooms, they brush     The descending blue; that blue is all in a rush   With richness; the racing lambs too have fair their fling.    What is all this juice and all this joy?     A strain of the earth's sweet being in the beginning   In Eden garden.—Have, get, before it cloy,     Before it cloud, Christ, lord, and sour with sinning,   Innocent mind and Mayday in girl and boy,     Most, O maid's child, thy choice and worthy the winning.      There is a set rhyme scheme, this poem is a fixed form but I don't know what.  If you can figure it out or know, please answer. Thanks!!!

He’s a funny man with a few dark secrets,    And cold metal chains locked tight around his anklets   He satisfies the public with a orgasmic smile   He’ll make your awakening in the mourning worthwhile   He says one joke and the mood shifts in the room   But you don’t know what I know, this man is a loon.   You’ll hear him in the dead of night dreaming unclearly   You’ll hear him speaking profanely, and screaming at nothing   He hasn’t always been together, he isn’t always so carefree   He’s a man to his word…sometimes, I speak for the family,   When I say that if its not a joke, then its his words that I call deadly   Funny man cant seem to understand, that a joke isn’t much to me   Don’t get mixed up here in words, I love the funny man so dearly   But he’s forgotten the role of life he so carelessly plays each day,    He may heal a frown upon my face, but I still walk astray   Humor can speak to the soul, but it cant replace a man I need   I don’t need a joke, funny man cant replace my daddy

I could play dress up and pretend to be a ballerina. Uh, no I can't dance. Maybe I'll put on this hate and pretend to be old Mrs. Ballinger in church. Or... I could be a rich lady, a very rich lady and pretend I live in a mansion on the golf course, and every year I go to Paris and buy lot's of jewelry and fancy clothes, and I drive a big car and... No the truth is I'm a model, a high fashion model, and all day long I pose for magazines and catalogs. I have long shiny hair and I wear makeup - lots of makeup- and everywhere I go people ask me for my autograph. Then I get a starring role in a movie. Yes, and all day long I'll be taking pictures for National Geographic . Yes ! Yes ! All day I'll be taking pictures of lions and tigers. But then suddenly the elephants stampede our Heep. " Oh, help, help the elephants are stampeding!" So we hop into our dugout canoes- yeah, yeah- and paddle down the Amazon through the crocodiles and the mean-eating piranhas, but suddenly the boat flips over and the crocodiles and piranhas come closer and closer.      Actually I'm NOT a movie star at all! It is my long lost cousin who looks a lot like me in the dim jungle light. I, on the other hand , am a doctor , the best plastic surgeon north or south of the equator. Maybe I'll be a motorcycle rider, or an... astronaut, blasting off to explore other universes, colonize other worlds, off to, off to.. THE KITCHEN. I'm starved , I wonder if we've got any peanut butter,      IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ IT : ) YOU CAN JUST GIVE ME TIPS :D Thaaanks !

20090205160738AAf4Gxn	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	What does this monologue mean?	HELENA   How happy some o'er other some can be! Through Athens I am thought as fair as she. But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so; He will not know what all but he do know: And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes, So I, admiring of his qualities: Things base and vile, folding no quantity, Love can transpose to form and dignity: Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind; And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind: Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste; Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste: And therefore is Love said to be a child, Because in choice he is so oft beguiled. As waggish boys in game themselves forswear, So the boy Love is perjured every where: For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne, He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine; And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt, So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt. I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:.   Then to the wood will he to-morrow night Pursue her; and for this intelligence If I have thanks, it is a dear expense: But herein mean I to enrich my pain, To have his sight thither and back again.

Broken      It whispers to her,   Never forget me…   A picture flashes in her mind   An innocent child with a broken smile,    Suddenly the child shrieks,    Her head rings but she stands still   waiting for the child to say something,   Anything   A gun is fired    A final picture flashes   Smeared blood   Everywhere.   I won’t forget       Blood      Blood leaves a stain   Forever   When it is cleaned   The pigment of color fades   The blood and    Its cells remain,   Remain like the memory   Of learning that an innocent girl’s blood   Was shed on the floor   That you had once walked on   And are standing on now      Imagination      A stick in the grass can be a sword   A rock on the ground can be a diamond   A piece of lint can be a living being   And suddenly a painted walnut is a piece of jewelry    A girls tears turn to laughter   Closing your eyes made it this way       When our eyes open we see    That the sword was just a stick in the grass    The diamond was just an ordinary rock    The living being was a piece of lint    The painted walnuts weren’t jewelry at all    And the laughter became tears    It is just a matter of    How you choose    To look at it.       Voice      Down where the rivers sing   And the trees laugh   Wind tickling their leaves   The ice of winter that blocked    Our voices   Melts away   All secrets   Revealed.       Please give honest opinions! Thanks!

Now I have to ask you to do something...  To forgive me.  Forgive me for all of the bad things I have done.  Forgive me of jealousy.  Forgive me of saying your name in vain,  Forgive me for not honoring my parents at times,   And most of all: For not honoring your glory you have given each and everyone of us.   For you have given us the power of life.  For not thinking about you everytime I take a step in this beautiful world you have created us.   And nobody realizes what you do for us every single second.  When I think of you, I can feel you right there at my side,  Guiding me to right way in life,  I can feel it,   And its the best feeling I have ever had since I have found you.  In Jesus' name, amen.    (c) themilkdude23@yahoo.com

It has a different kind of rhyming scheme than I've ever done...Hope you like it : )         Found In a High School Student’s Journal      They laugh and push me to the ground,   They scoff at me and call me clown,   Soon they’ll feel the pain deep down,   That I’m feeling every day.   They smash my glasses; call me nerd,   Call me names and nasty words,   They don’t know this kind of hurt,   But soon I’ll make them pay.      They think they’re popular with their friends,   But they’ll all be facing dismal ends,   As my misery with anger blends,   The time grows ever near.   All those fools don’t know their fate,   I have a list of the ones I hate,   I’ve already marked the calendar date,   Their little worlds are without fear.      Every parent, friend, or sibling,   Will think I did a terrible thing,   But they’ve never felt the sting,   That their words have caused.   Maybe it’s murder on high school ground,   But it’s too late their fate is sound,   Nothing I know could turn me around,   Their chance for peace is lost.      I hate them more every time I write,   Today I was bloodied in a fight,   When I was down they kicked for spite,   My father says “Be a man”.   Never again will my money they “Borrow”,   The day they die will be tomorrow,   Then they’ll feel my wrath and sorrow,   I’ll never be hurt again.      Today things happened differently,   Not what I expected to be,   Maybe it was sympathy,   Maybe I don’t know.   A family moved next door to us,   And their daughter ran to catch the bus,   She sat next to me without disgust,   And even said hello.      I ditched my guns before going in,   I didn’t feel like shooting them,   Maybe this was just a whim,   Maybe I’d shoot them still.   Things in school started out the same,   But when I was floored someone called my name,   She stared not at me, but them with disdain,   She stretched down her hand to me in good will.      Amazingly they started to leave,   And at first as I stood I couldn’t believe,   That such an act would happen to me,   Was this the end of my danger?   Even harder for my mind,   How an unknown could be so kind,   I was scorned; was she blind?   Such kindness from a stranger.      As the days past she’s stayed friends with me,   Even in the face of adversity,   When they pick on her she isn’t angry,   There’s something different between us.   Today I went and I said please,   I want; I need, your kind of peace,   I want the anger in my heart to cease,   She said I needed Jesus.      With compassion tearing in her eyes,   She said that Jesus never lies,   He’ll bring you peace; for He died,   On the cross at Calvary.   She told me how we all had sin,   And how we all are in need of Him,   And all to do is ask Him in,   And of His love for me.      I then asked Jesus in my heart,   And felt a change from the start,   Anger was no longer a part,   Of my inner being.   I had to tell the world about it,   Climb the heights of a mountain; shout it!   With joy and peace my life surrounded,   Differently I was seeing.      I told my parents; they accepted the Lord,   We’ve begun going to church with the family next door,   I always am yearning to learn even more,   And I know what has to be done.   The crowd gathered round today at school,   I told them all, I was the fool,   But now being used of God a tool,   I told them all of the Son.      Some mocked, some scoffed, but I told them it mattered,   Eventually though, all of them scattered,   And that was the last I think I’ll be tattered,   Or challenged in that way.   My life is so much better now,   Since the Lord Jesus I have found,   For even in trouble I know how,   To go to Him and pray.         P.S. feel free to rate my other open poem : )

20090205172157AACOLGh	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would like some feedback on a short dialog piece i have written?	basically this is a more or less philosophical exchange between a more or less pessimistic man, and a optimistic girl. their ideologies clash all the time, and this is just a short example i made in a few minutes. it starts with the girl asking the question, mid discussion. not that i purposely didn't put any in between thoughts and actions or descriptions because, as i have said, i made the dialog in a few minutes, and its just an idea right now. this can also be considered a part of one of my earlier writings, though not the same excerpt:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       "are you giving me a lecture of a battle between good vs evil?"   "the thing is, people have neglected to tell that evil has already won, there was no fight, there is no battle. there is no good left to be found."   "what about me?"   "the few good left, is a dieing breed, and is overshadowed by the evil that exists. even the beauty of your light is darkened and cannot be seen through the thick cloud that has been casted."   "you know...in the darkest of our nights..event he darkest of our days..the light which we are shines the brightest."   "i think its YOU who's giving me the lecture."   "i think you might be right."   "im trying not to think."   "good. its a bad habit."          "...how come i cant see it then?"   "see what?"   "this "light" that you speak so highly of. how come i cant see it?"   "maybe its cause you turn away from it, close your eyes and shut yourself away from it. or because you run from it. maybe its cause your too scared to look into it. i don't know. its something you should be asking yourself. but i do know this..and you do too. wherever there is light. anywhere there is even the smallest source, darkness vanishes. it runs. fear strikes it, and it disappears."   "are you saying that i am this darkness? the very thing i want gone?"   "that...and imagine what would happen..imagine what it would be like, if we all chose to be the light that we are- instead of denying ourselves. imagine if we all chose to play the role of the good."   "ive learned that imagining and hoping, only leads to disappointment."   "then your denying yourself of what makes you human."

20090205195222AAfraxi	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Miss Victoria.  Comments?	Becoming short skirts and lovely long legs,   And plenty of coffee with her easy-up eggs;   Candles and poetry, a kiss on the cheek,   Asleep on the couch, her dreams she doth seek.      Bundles of pics and letters and cards,   Inspires me to be nothing less than her Bard;   Glances and smiles over upturned collars,   A mere look from her is worth countless dollars.      Long black dresses and glasses of wine,   Dinner's at eight, soaked suits are at nine;   Be it Sal's or Tony's or Rosewood or Ki's,   Wherever she goes, the men use their eyes.      Sheer black hose with a seam up the back,   'Pleasures' is right, her charms do not lack;   Clanking and clinking with bracelets and rings,   The sound of her nearing makes my heart sing.      Puppies and Kats, and imagination galore!   Sweetness and light, with truth as its core;   All of the Angels, and more, that is she,   The only conclusion is that God has blessed me.

20090205194938AASmn8u	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	If True Goodness never changes, then why it that "Change is good"?	Example:      Fuel economy in cars was a priority in the 1980's.  Sub-compacts became much smaller cars, and MPG ratings got much better.  Now, most sub-compacts are mid-size cars again, Muscle Cars are back in vogue, and Fuel economy is an issue again.  If the 1970 Dodge Challenger is such an timeless beast, then why wasn't it kept on the market during the Eighties when smaller engines were the populist craze?  (The Hemi V-8 was even illegal from 1974 onward.  And suddenly there's a 2009 Dodge Challenger with a Hemi V-8 engine again!)  But, if fuel economy is an issue again, why aren't MPG ratings even as good as they were in the Eighties?      Please feel free to recite the illogical mess of your favorite yarn of timelessness versus populism!

20090205195653AABHIr5	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What would you do if your daughter is picking on her sister, who lost her hair after having chemotherapy?	i have a little cousin called nicole, who is four years old. she is a very spoiled little girl, who always gets upset when she doesn`t get her own way. she was an only child raised by her single mother. aunt rose had recently got married again. her husband is a man called harry, who was a single father. he has a six-year-old daughter called jade. jade had also been greatly spoiled by her father, who doted on her. after the wedding, the two girls did not get along. nicole often tattled on jade and got her into trouble. jade thought nicole was an annoying little sister. unfortunately, jade got cancer and was in the hospital for ages. she had to undergo many treatments, including chemotherapy, which made all her curly hair fall out. when she got home, people gave her most of the attention. they let her have her own way because of her illness, which made nicole jealous and bitter. nicole feels ignored and left out. she threw temper tantrums and became greatly attention-seeking. she had even tried to fight with jade on some occasion.. there were times when she was mean to her sister. nicole had teased jade, called her names and took her anger out on her. when they go out as a family, jade might not feel well and they have to hurry her home. nicole would cry and scream because she wants to stay and play. aunt rose and uncle harry would just comfort her, saying"we have to go home now because your sister is tired. we will play later." what can i do to help them?

20090205183648AAqljv7	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Why is the catcher in the rye a classic novel?	according to my teacher, a classic novel:  -can be read at any age and enjoyed at any age  -is compared to by other books/songs/tv shows/etc  -is a new style of writing  -has good examples of literary elements  -is thought of as best of its kind    so what i have so far on why the catcher in the rye is a classic novel is  -it can be reread because it's about coming of age  -it's the first of its kind because it's one of the first coming of age books because it was written in the 1950s  -it's thought of as the best of its kind because other books (like the outsiders) are always being compared to it. other things that have been compared to it are a jonas brother's song called 6 minutes, where he says "sometimes i feel like the catcher in the rye"    so i guess what i'm looking for from you people are more examlpes of why this book is a classic novel using what my teacher told us makes up one. also, more examples of things that are being compared to this book would be great (for example, the tv show friends talks about old yeller, the jonas brothers talk about the catcher in the rye, etc)    thanks so much to everybody who answers me

20090205195527AAQ5nTB	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I NEED SOME FEEDBACK PLEASE!!?	This is the very beginning of a story I've been writing. It's rough, but I wanted some input before I went any further. I've changed a bit and added some. Tell me what you think!         I was wearing the pretty princess dress, yet again.    The dress was pale blue and silky. It tapered around my waist and flowed out into a wide sweeping skirt. The whole dress was flecked with tiny sparkling beads that would shimmer in the soft lighting.      My hair was done up in soft curls pinned at the back of my head. There were small pearls in my ears that match the thin pearl necklace that was around my throat. I was wearing makeup, for once. I was a vision of beauty.      It was awful.    Ugh, every time I have to go through this, the same thoughts go through my head. The torture, the embarrassment, the monotony. Why am I doing this? What could possibly be worth this? And then I think of Sal, and the promise I made him.      At the time, it didn’t seem so horrendous. One night a year, I would make an effort to look my best. I would wear the dress he bought me— which always makes me cringe to think how much of his tiny salary went to the ghastly thing. I would do my hair nice, I would wear jewelry and heels and the whole shebang. At the time, I didn’t think it was much to ask of me, coming from the man who had raised me like a daughter. At the time.      Well, after having gone through the experience a few times before, I was ready to call it quits. Walking down that small hallway, my dress billowing around me, the only thing that stopped me from turning tail and running back to my room was Sal. Picturing the disappointment on his face. I couldn’t do that to him. He was too good and deserved more than that from me. So, I set my jaw and kept walking, bracing myself for a monstrosity of an evening.      I opened the door a crack and peeked in. The dining hall was immaculate. Sparkling chandeliers, huge elegantly set tables, fine furnishings, the works. People were everywhere, all dressed up, fancy and polished. Across the long room from me was a grand sweeping staircase where the new students and their families were coming in. It was the perfect place for a fairytale entrance. Many of the girls seemed reluctant to leave the spotlight of the steps.      I smirked. Thank god I didn’t have to come in from there. People would have thought I was a student, poised for a new year here at Brighton Academy. I didn’t think I could stand the shame.      Instead I crept in through from the kitchen door, trying to be invisible. Unfortunately, ball gowns aren’t exactly made to be discreet. People had to move aside as I pushed my way along the wall. Then they would stop and stare at my glittery gown as I went by, holding my skirts up so that I wouldn’t trip. I gritted my teeth. It’s not like I was the only one in a fancy dress, but people always seemed to fixate on me, like I was some kind of anomaly. I wanted to turn and shout at them. ‘Yup, that’s right. I’m Cinderella. Stop staring or I’ll yank off my glass slipper and chuck it at you!’ God, people are dumb.      Some whispered as I slipped by, others even pointed! My cheeks burned, but I tried to ignore them. Any other day I could handle the attention, ward it off. But not tonight, with so many stares and dressed as I was. I looked like every other girl here, all of whom were eager for any attention thrown there way. That’s why people dress like this, isn’t it? To show off? Ew, gag me. I’m in a huge ball gown! Nobody dresses like this! Shouldn’t they all feel sorry for me?! But no, sadly, I get awe. The irony.      With a huge relief, I spotted my family. Well, not my actual family, but Sal and the rest of the kitchen staff. I don’t have any real family, but they’re close enough. Better, even.      They were all standing near the back wall, dressed in simple coats and plain dresses. Every one from the school is invited to the Start of Year Celebration Ball. Students, their families, the teachers, and all of the school staff. Formal attire is expected of everyone, but Sal decided to push my promise to him above and beyond with the fluffy dress he got me. I looked like a marshmallow peep princess. It was so unfair.      Sal spotted me as I hurried over. His eyes crinkled as he smiled. “You look wonderful, Bun”, he said, calling me by his special nickname, “Absolutely wonderful.”      I smiled. “Thanks, Sal. You know I’m going to get you for this.”      He laughed. “You always do, Bun. Still, it’s worth it. You look like royalty.”      I grimaced.   Roma came to join us from his other side, dressed in her finest, meaning a very old, very plain black dress. I sighed with envy, trying to ignore the shimmering poof wrapped around me. She put an arm around my shoulders and chuckled. “Oh, let her alone Sal. You know how much Kylar hates these things.” She smiled at me and winked. “Personally, I’ve quite enjoyed the balls since you started coming. It’s

20090205200218AAJR6XT	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Good books about vampires that is NOT twilight.?	Ok, so don't judge me. I am looking for suggestions for books. I was wondering if anyone new any good romanic-action vampire books. I fell in love with the Night Huntress series by Jeaniene Frost (not for teens or younger, I might add), and I want something like it. I have been looking desperately for good books like this with no luck. Thanks if you can give some suggestions.      Criteria:   -Happy ending   -romantic   -action (preferably a bad *** female lead character)   -has to involve being in love with a vampire, or being one thats in love or something around that.      I am not really picky, but could you list the books and tell me what there about and why you liked them. Thanks.       But If you have other good suggestions that you think I would like that doesn't quite go with the criteria, please tell me.       And please, DO NOT SAY TWILIGHT! I have read it and wasn't impressed with the author's writing skill. The plot was cute, but if I hear edward was glaring or staring or gleaming one more time, I will go insane. She didn't have that many descriptive words. Plus I think it was aimed toward a younger crowd than myself.  Plus bella was whiny, stupid, and childish which made it seem weird that edward was digging her.       Any way, Sorry for the little book rant. Just please, I don't need to hear that twilight is the best book ever and that I should read it, cause I already have.       Again, Thank you if you can help!

20090205201103AA4xyel	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Another poem I would like to ask your opinion on?	Heat.   My short breath slashes the air   The heat,   slaps frozen wood on my arms.   A wave of soft sand shudders up my legs.   I feel like I can touch it,   the heat.   I feel the groping of hands behind my mind   My eyes are leathery and worn   like crinkled, waxy paper   They roll    as a tongue would across gelatin.   I can feel their sliminess   before the bridge of my nose.   My palms are pressed into shaggy carpets.   I close my fingers into their wrinkles   And all I feel is clay,   squishy and tingling.   The tips of my fingers   are leaden,   and the skin cracks like dessert mud   when I bend them.    My heart drums almost as harshly   as the particles of the summer   heat.          What do you think? Thanks

Just name the last book you finished, the book you're reading now and a little bit about them or how you feel about them.      I just finished reading Anthem by Ayn Rand--very easy read, but I don't agree with any of her major concepts and think her story was too far fetched.   I'm reading The Abolition of Man by C.S. Lewis right now. It's interesting, but he's a very thick writer and I don't follow all of his arguments too clearly. I think there's some that I don't agree with.    I'm also reading some Voltaire short stories which I'm finding are very over-rated...or maybe I'm just not that lofty of a person to get them. I don't know.      You?

20090205203606AAYWFgP	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Are relationships necessary in life?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.  Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.  Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..  On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my life.

"The White Room"   Charles Simic      The obvious /is difficult    To prove./ Many prefer   The hidden./ I did, too./   I listened to the trees../      They had a secret/   Which they were about to   Make known to me--/   And then didn't./      Summer came./ Each tree   On my street had its own   Scheherazade./ My nights/   Were a part of their wild/      Storytelling./ We were   Entering dark houses,/   Always more dark houses,/   Hushed /and abandoned./      There was someone with eyes closed   On the upper floors./   The fear of it,/ and the wonder,/   Kept me sleepless./      The truth is bald and cold,/   Said the woman/   Who always wore white./   She didn't leave her room./      The sun pointed to one or two   Things/ that had survived   The long night intact./   The simplest things,/      Difficult/ in their obviousness./   They made no noise./   It was the kind of day   People described as/ "perfect."      Gods disguising themselves/   As black hairpins,/ a hand-mirror,/   A comb with a tooth missing?/   No! That wasn't it./      Just things as they are,/   Unblinking,/ lying mute   In that bright light--/   And the trees/ waiting /for the night

20090205210311AACHFis	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Please set aside all prejudices.. about becoming an actress...help!?	it's a bit discouraging reading all those answers to questions similar to mine now, but i really am different from those whose dream of becoming an actress is just a passing fad. as early as 12 years old i already knew that this is what i wanted, i just cant be happier and gosh, the adrenaline rush that i always experience when we shoot project videos or do school plays ever since just tells me that this is what i am for. i watch movies not only to be entertained but primarily to be educated about what is good and bad acting and what kind of scenes work and not. when i was 16 and was applying for universities, i always discussed with my parents the idea of taking up theater arts. they just wouldn't hear of it. i am currently taking up a bachelor of science degree in nursing because they always wanted me to be in the medical field. i took this particular path because i know that this is one of the best ways to get myself in the united states (hopefully in new york or los angeles) where i can be totally independent and pursue my dreams of becoming an actress. i am actually going to be a year delayed for graduation because i left school when i suffered clinical depression more than a year ago of which one of its causes was my big frustration over not becoming a theater student. now that i've recovered, it still doesnt mean that im going to throw all my dreams away and just stay stuck with what i have now. yeah, im studying hard and doing real good at my hospital school and community health center shifts, but im back to reading lots of acting related books, practicing by myself and watching scenes from different movies over and over. i dont like movies because theyre top grossers, i love movies that are really brilliant because of their substance and the showcase of amazing talent. now, i'm 19 and am very, very happy that i'll be joining my university's theater organization (as a matter of fact,the oldest one in the philippines) this year. i hope this does not sound like a crazy obsession to you but seriously anybody who knows how to really want and be swayed many times from an ambition will understand.       and now, that i've already pulled myself together, i replanned, and i incorporated my acting plans in my  "gameplan". that is, finish college (that will be in more or less 2 years from now), go to the u.s. work as a nurse two jobs at a time, save up for acting classes and get started.      by the way i'm not american (which will surely make things harder than they already are), im asian (filipina with spanish roots from my maternal side) but i know how to speak english fluently. im not goddess-like beautiful but im also not an ugly hag either. i really dont know if i fall in the pretty category. not skinny, not fat, just right. im 5'1 (yeah i know that's short) but i am certain that i have immense talent for this kind of job. if you're going to ask me "then if you really like acting why don't you try your local film and tv business?" this is my answer: the philippines's entertainment business is nothing but crap. face value and sex appeal is what they find important, not talent. it's all about whom you're related to, how you look like and how modelesque you look. it will be a feather to your cap if you have foreign blood in your veins. that's crap. and as for storylines, i dont wanna sound really b*tchy but it's always the same. anybody who really appreciates movies and tv series and everything in between will really get bored here, what with all those very predictable finales, with all those predictable lines(!), all those oversold looks and poorly directed and acted scenes. well i cannot fully blame them, they have the stupid Filipino masses who love cliches to entertain and get lots and lots of money from. but it's not always the case i have the indie movie industry to thanks for. but you know, i dont wanna act without getting at least any penny in return. i am passionate about acting but i dont want to starve either.      wow, that was a mouthful i just said. now, here's my question (or plea for help). how do i start..?   any tip or piece of advice will be greatly appreciated. thanks guys, and i hope you don't put in unsolicited and rude comments. =)      May God bless you..! =)

20090205201619AAB6a2w	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Help me find some good books to read?	I am gonna be really specific lol!       I read all works by these writers:      Stephenie Meyer   Darren Shan   Holly Black   Frank Beddor      I really like fantasy. I like romance, suspense, action, etc.   Stephenie Meyer did the Twilight Series and The Host. Darren Shan did the Cirque Du Freak series and the Demonata series, Holly black wrote : Spiderwick chronicles, Tithe, Valiant, and Ironside. Frank Beddor wrote a new interesting twist about Alice in wonderland caled : The Looking Glass Wars, and Seeing Redd.      Anyway I am 21, so I like a little romance, but love action. I like books about Vampires, Faeries, Wolves, monsters, Demons, magic, and any other mythical creatures.       I want books similar to those. I look in the book store but can never really find anything interesting.  Which is weird.    I guess I like the Young Adult section or the Teen Section. Sometimes I think the books are a little too G rated for me. But books for "grown ups" are not fantasy enough for me. Most books my mother wants me to read are just murder suspense books.. Boring, I get enough of that on CSI and Law and Order. =D       So I would like some fantasy books! Romance is great, action, adventure, is great too.

20090205201958AAaoFR7	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of this poem? ?	THE RAVAN:     Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,   Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,   While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,   As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.   `'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, `tapping at my chamber door -   Only this, and nothing more.'      Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,   And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.   Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow   From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -   For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore -   Nameless here for evermore.      And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain   Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;   So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating   `'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -   Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; -   This it is, and nothing more,'      Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,   `Sir,' said I, `or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;   But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,   And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,   That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the door; -   Darkness there, and nothing more.         ***TO SUMMERIZE THIS UP WHAT YOU YOU SAY....***** WHAT ARE THE LITERARY DIVICES IN THIS POEM?****PLEASE HELP DUE IN 7 HOURS!

You deserve someone so much better than little ol' me.  You're amazing, you're one I couldn't live without,  Whether as a friend or a lover, I need you in my life.  Never leave me completely, stay with me as long as you can.  Someday, it will be over. I know that, I don't care.    Our pasts are filled with men and women gone.  Some stay, in both our lives. I'm getting over that, why can't you?  I don't care about the past, it's done and over with.  I don't particularly care about the future either.  It's scary and hurtful to think about.  All I want to do is live my life, one day at a time.  I think we should do that, and stop worrying about the past and future.        February 5th, 2009
20090205205256AANnFyr	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can you help me paraphrase these lines from Macbeth please?	So I have to perform a skit from Macbeth in front of a class, and I'm supposed to paraphrase two of Lady Macbeth's lines as if I were saying them in present day, does that make sense?      here are the lines:   can you paraphrase these for me into something that would make sense to a group of 10th graders?      Lady Macbeth:      All our service in every point twice done, and then done double, were poor and single business to contend against those honors deep and broad wherewith your majesty loads our house. For those of old, and the late dignities heaped up to them, we rest your hermits.      also,      Lady Macbeth:      Your servants ever have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs in compt, to make their sudit at your highness' pleasure, still to return your own.

On the test, there were questions like: which is the best revision of this sentence, and like what sentence best fits between the end of the sixth and seventh paragraph and there would be like a bunch of choice. Do you know any books that I could buy that would help me prepare for these sort of questions? Are they reading comphrehension questions?

The man in the hole only ever saw the shadows, so he thought that the shadows were the reality. It'd be great if someone could tell me who came up with this.

20090205210554AA76Wy7	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Going to a Musical Audition, Do’s and Don’ts?	This is an audition for a school musical. I would like to know the main Do’s and Don’ts for participating in a musical audition. My teacher is doing the judging/cast placement, she is trying to make it as relativistic to a real audition possible, but understands that as time is limited (we are WAAAAY behind) we are going to sing the song that we would like to sing in the musical, and be cast accordingly (this apparently when normally trying out is a HUGE don’t, but accepted under the circumstances we are presented with)   Anyways, I was pretty much babbling. :/      QUESTIONS:      What should I wear? Simple? (White tee/tank with jeans) or Fancy? (bold shirt, dress pants) What colours?   When I walk in should I act normal? Or calm, should I be quiet? (I know she’s my teacher but I don’t know if there is a certain way I am supposed to act in when trying out?)   When singing the song, can I start at any point in it? Or do I have to start from the beginning?   My teacher gave me an auditioning form (other productions/acting experience) can I include plays I was involved with in grade 3 or grade 6? Does that look lame? :/   Oh I assume that I should not pile on the make-up, I usually only wear eyeliner and mascara, that fine right?    I also wear glasses, but recently have begun wearing contacts… which should I wear?    Should I bring props?      I know these questions sound stupid, --they probably are, but I’ve never done this before, I want to do it right and make a good impression, so humor me. lol

20090205213541AAZjOpD	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Read some wierd poetry?	We all see what we fear the most when we look into the dark,    but what happens, when what we see is ourselves?   The dark, it holds so many mysteries, so many fears, so many insecurities,   A black abyss of nothingness,   Yet so full of so many things.   And yet none of which can be confirmed.   Looking out the window,   All you see is darkness….   But in your mind you see,   Clowns, and demons, and dragons fire.   You tell yourself to stop,   There is no need to fear,   Fore you know that these things do not exist,    but then again,    if you were to look out that very same window,    and see an exact image of yourself,    that seems to be living and breathing and feeling,    as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow,   then what would you tell yourself?   You cannot simply say it doesn’t exist,    because you know you yourself proves its existence.   You cannot just as easily close your eyes,   And expect it to be gone, because if it is gone,   Then so are you.   And yet you close your eyes anyway,   Knowing that image of yourself will still be there when you open them again.   Finally you turn away from the window just to try to get that horrible image out of your eyes,   That image of you, sweet pathetic you,   Outside, in the cold, all by your lonesome,   You look away to forget the pain of being alone and feeling unwanted,   You stare into the crackling fire,    and sit in a comfortable chair only to realize what you saw outside is also what you see inside,    you,    you by yourself,    with nobody there to keep you company or to keep you sane,    and that is when you finally realize,    seeing in the dark,    is exactly like looking in a mirror.
20090205213401AApWQ7X	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Books about a human experiment?	I like reading dramas and sometimes science fiction. Sometimes its hard to find a specific subject. I wanted to know if anyone knew about any fiction books about a person (the main character or characters) unwilling becoming an experiment of some sort? I was thinking on it after running across an interesting video game about a human who was tested on by scientists and gained powers. The wilder the story the better. The only one I really know of is the "Maximum Ride" series. I think that's about human experimentation.   What about a person becoming half man half machine. I feel like there are books out there like that if there are movies and video games on the subject.   I like following a lone character through his struggles. Especially if he's gained strange powers.

This person’ love strengthens my heart   And with this shall I change my part.         Any feedback would be great!
