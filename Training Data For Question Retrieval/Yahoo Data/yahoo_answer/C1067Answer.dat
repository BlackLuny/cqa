mqgS6Dfxaa	The advantage and disadvantages for the offense:  Advantage: Ground balls get through the infield quicker  Disadvantage: Slow roller will get to the infielder quicker    The advantage and disadvatages for the defense:  Advantage: Balls take truer hops  Advantage: Slow rollers will get to the fielder quicker  Disadvantage: Hard hit grounds will get through the infield quicker.  Disadvantage: Not the best surface to make a diving attempt on.    As far as the Rays and Twins success at home it's probably due to their teams being more geared to the artificial surface.  They have faster players that can cut off the gaps quicker.  By the way there were some non-turf teams that also had huge success at home.  The Rays won 57 games at home, Boston 56, White Sox 54, and the Twins 53.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	If a field plays differently then other fields (because of artificial turf or any other reason) the home team has an advantage due to familiarity with the field's quirks.  Most players prefer grass because it's easier on joints and hurts less when dive and slide on it, but it's hard to grow real grass in some stadiums.  The big difference between artificial and real surfaces is that the ball is much faster on artificial which benefits teams that hit a lot of grounders through the infield.|`|yk4S7uuraa	The ball carries differently on turf, and the home team knows how to play the hops better because they play there 81 times a year.  The ball gets through the infield much quicker.    But, playing on turf takes its toll on your feet and legs.|`|Mqurv3LXaa	The advantage rests with the batters. Artificial turf will cause routine grounders to speed up and possibly get through into the outfield. Artificial turf will also add an added boost to those infield choppers.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	I think the turf is cool. It prob is an advantage to them because they know there stadium well and are used to playing there. They should have an NL team with the turf I would love for the mets to play on one.|`|GwawzO5Faa	The home team usually knows how to play the bounces better and position the defense accordingly.    Weather conditions in Toronto and Minnesota make it hard for them to play on grass and keep up what would be very costly year round maintenance.|`|p7ZgSPIDaa	I like the feel of softer hair,i get sores on artificial turf.

ZN4tlYV9aa	well, i haven't seen how you do it, but since you say your "whip" is fine, then i'm guessing your leg is high during the whip and then comes down. well, ok, i assume that you know how to do a normal camel spin. you want to get into the same position as that. if you are landing extremely off balance, then that is something you need to work on, but if you are landing everything perfect and you just can't get your leg up, then there's nothing you can do but keep practicing it and getting used to the feeling over time, and also practice holding the position off-ice.

Just rumors and speculation up to this point.|`|qCWin81saa	yeah he will some back fight mosley then get ko'd by mosley and retire again|`|vT4eybSyaa	Nothing definitive.

This was on Talksport radio last week. Maybe the beginning of a talk up for a re-match. Unlikely though.|`|2yhtsxMWaa	yeah i do

Professes to be ready to do "anything he can" to help USA rugby - except of course to meet the obligations he undertook with his appointment.    So, as long as your idea of qualifications for a top-level position with Ospreys and Welsh rugby doesn't include honour or loyalty to either employers or players - or even completing the job you started - it's probably a grand choice.

Keep in mind that athletes want to get sports scholarships and go to good Division I colleges. If anything, taking it easy on an opponent is condescending.|`|jorawDndaa	How about the fact they only scored like 14 or 15 points in the fourth quarter. Most likely they had their reserves. The fact there shouldn't be an apology by the other team but by the athletic director of the school that only has LIKE 22 girls in the whole school.|`|3OV4Pl64aa	yeah but it means that they were trying to run up the score because they were trying to reach 100 points|`|LsIMKcHcaa	Why is this such a big deal?

ADD: Yes, the Japanese sell the meat:    Under a loophole in the 1986 International Whaling Commission (IWC) ban against commercial whaling, Japan has continued to kill hundreds of whales every year for scientific research. Once a whale is killed, scientists collect data from the animal's remains on its age, birthing rate and diet; the meat is then packaged and sold."

No matter what you think of him you cant say he doesnt know the game, how many people in the game have been a GM, Coach, and a Player.... he has don it all.  Being a goalie I will say that his goaltending analysis is shaky.      I can't really see him a a color guy though,  he is at his best when NESN just lets him go and he disects a play or issue.  In that sense he does a good job but if the network only gives him a little 15 sec spot then his work is relatively forgetable as in the case when he works with NBC.    As for Millbury's career he was a damn good player, a good coach, his career as a GM was well very weak.  He was forced into a few of those insane deals and offers like the Dipietro and Yashin contracts since Charles Wang wanted to let it be known the Islanders weren't gonna up and move and thereby push for a new arena.   That said, he still should have made it known just how bad those decisions were, that was his job as a GM although your boss is still the boss and he gets last say.... he writes the check after all.|`|HNEWf7ILaa	No

Wz2lTWJ3aa	This is easy, restructure the contract. Even from a money point of view it pays later. He is 'buying' the labels of selfless and team player which make him more valuable later. He is keeping talent on the team meaning he wont have ot face double coverage all the time next year. And if he can do something to keep the team good, any money he would loose now he will more than make up for in future playoff/superbowl appearances. And it also puts pressure on Boldin to stay. He is a classy guy, but if he leaves now he gives the impresson of pretty much spitting in their faces, and no team wants that kind of selfish money grubbing a player. (except perhaps the Cowboys)|`|7Z25Rmxoaa	no|`|acaAycEXaa	I wouldn't give up squat to sign that jerk. He should be cut for his antics.

Flair's 16 World Titles are a testament to his dedication, perseverance, and sacrifice to be the best.

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	RVD has been my favorite wrestler since 1997.  Seeing him at the Rumble this year was the highlight of the show.  I miss him the most out of the guys on this list.    Brock Lesnar I was never a big fan of.  Yeah, he's huge and strong, but he was mostly a brawler and I'm not a big fan of brawlers.  I don't miss him.    Eddie Guerrero was one of the greatest entertainers to ever be in a wrestling ring.  A fantastic wrestler and high-flyer, and one of the most lovable wrestlers ever.  I miss him tremendously.    Chris Benoit was the greatest in-ring performer I've ever seen in my nearly 42 years as a fan.  I never got tired of watching him wrestle; the man was an artist.  I miss seeing him so much that I go back and watch old matches of his pretty regularly.    Hulk Hogan I am sick of.  I've been sick of him since the 80's when he was rammed down my throat and into every other orifice.  Hogan and Hulkamania was impossible to avoid in the 80's, it was literally everywhere.  Not only do I not miss him, I never want to see him again.    The Ultimate Warrior.  I loved that gimmick and the lunatic playing that lunatic character.  But that was then.  I've done just fine without him the last 20 years.

tG5Ar7DIaa	Get average-good test scores.  All you are required to stay is a year to be eligible for the NBA.  You need to go to college.  There are other options, but college is your best bet.  The NCAA is the only one.  There are multiple divisions, but Division 1 is the best bet for the NBA.  You shouldn't go to college just for the NBA, though.  You might not even be good enough for the NBA.  I would, unless you can get a scholarship from a big school, go to a smaller Div. 1 school and try to walk on.    I don't mean to be rude, but I would try to improve your spelling before college.|`|i9FLcvb7aa	get into a top tier college great grades, great ACT's score. Be a great High school athlete.

Since you have 10 teams the best way is to set it up in two pools.    8:00 1A vs 2A and 1B vs 2B  9:00 3A vs 4A and 3B vs 4B  10:00 1A vs 5A and 1B vs 5B  11:00 2A vs 3A and 2B vs 3B  12:00 4A vs 5A and 4B vs 5B  1:00 1A vs 3A and 1B vs 3B  2:00 2A vs 4A and 2B vs 4B  3:00 3A vs 5A and 3B vs 5B  4:00 1A vs 4A and 1B vs 4B  5:00 2A vs 5A and 2B vs 5B  6:00 break for dinner  7:00 A 1st place vs B 2nd place and B 1st place vs A 2nd place  8:00 winner of the two 7:00 games for the championship    note: you could also have the two losers from 7:00 also play at 8:00 for 3rd place.    Also, hope it doesn't rain.|`|AA10331435	Break it into 2 five team pools. Actually gives each team 4 game minimum with about same number (21 games) of total games as a straight 10 team double elimination tournament (20 games). Top team from each pool plays for the championship. With an hour limit championship should start at about 1900 hours. Another way to get a boatload of games in during a short time span is to make it a one pitch tournament. Hitter starts with 3-2 count.

GvoQxbipaa	I think a really good rider is someone who can assess any horse very quickly and rides them as individuals whilst getting the best out of them. A good rider is able to communicate with the horse and listens to what the horse is saying to them. Such a rider is able to slow down fizzy horses, give confidence to nervous horses, give enthusiasm to sluggish horses and gets respect from 'bolshy' horses.   It takes a lot of experience on a variety of horses and a natural sensitivity to become such a rider, as well as all the other skills already mentioned in other answers.|`|gJE0ujbzaa	It's pretty easy to screw up a well trained horse. Only my best students get to ride my own personal horses as well.  Not only can a rider screw up a well trained horse, but a very responsive horse is more likely to gallop off or turn fast or do something "unexpected" when a nervous rider grips with their legs, lets their legs swing, etc.    A good rider has a good position, understands why horses do what they do and how they think(and by understanding this, can often predict and prevent spooks etc), and does not get tense or nervous(that nervousness transfers to the horse and makes HIM nervous and more likely to act up).    If you really want to learn, talk to your instructor about a working student position.  Where you do a lot of the things like grooming, stall cleaning, feeding, etc., in exchange for extra lessons, and a chance to learn more about horses.|`|RyZHhI6aaa	Well, I don't know how long you've been riding, but this lady may want the other rider to ride her horses because she may be more advanced and better able to handle the horses.  If the horse has had a lot of time off, it's going to need a strong rider who can react quickly and appropriately if the horse makes a sudden movement like if it spooks or rears or something.  I'm assuming that this lady thinks this other girl would be able to handle that better.    Or maybe it's just that this lady and this girl has a better relationship than you have and this lady would rather do this girl the favor of letting her ride the horses.    Of course I can't say for sure and I wouldn't be offended by it.    In my opinion, a good rider has good balance, a soft hand and seat, a strong leg, a natural feel for the rhythm of the horse, a connection with the horse so she knows what cue to use at what time, gentle cues.  You have to have strong legs and hands, but know when to use them.  You should make the horse happy and persuade them to work for you rather than forcing them to do it.  An advanced rider should know how to lightly ask the horse to get on the bit and curve around the inside leg in the corners.  A good rider always knows how her horse is feeling and knows when to push or hold the horse back.  A good rider can compensate for the horse's shortcomings.    There's a lot of things that going into being a good rider and no one is perfect so no one has all of those things.  If you're really worried about what this lady thinks of your riding, then ask her.  Tell her you want to improve and ask her what 3 major things you should work on to be better.    You could watch the other girl ride and see what she does differently and see if there's anything in her riding that you should imitate.|`|uNGJe5GBaa	The nerves could be the worst problem. Sometimes you can be completely awesome while riding, physically - good seat, hands, excellent signals, all that junk, but the nerves.. It does sound like your instructor does not want you to ride her horses. It could be because she doesn't trust you, or it could be that she thinks her horses could be too hot for you - they very well could be. If you get nervous, a hotter horse is not one you want to get on. Perhaps her horses are extremely sensitive and she thinks you're not capable of communicating on their level.     A good rider is someone who is confident and relaxed on the back of a horse. They can communicate clearly with the horse and can react spur of the moment to any misbehaviors or freak-outs. They have an independant seat, soft hands, and solid legs. They can move in time with the horse and retain some control, even when the horse is feeling nervous or antsy. Your riding may have come along quite a bit, but perhaps she doesn't feel you're ready for her horses yet. The more you allow yourself to relax, the less nervous you become about your horsemanship, the more your instructor will trust you with her horses instead of of the school horses.    Maybe you could ask to try out a horse you haven't ridden, or ask to go to a show with your instructor and enter some equitation classes to see how your riding compares to others'?|`|RFPUcsptaa	your nerves are probably why she doesn't want you to ride her horse and how old are you? if your younger than that could be why. but if you older it's just probably going to take some time to build up to a more experienced horse. Just remember you have only been riding for a couple of years, don't get ahead of yourself!|`|AqLrr82Uaa	A good rider is someone who is soft and understanding with a horse. Your equitation will come with practice. But a good rider is easy ad quiet with horses. Also, some would consider a good rider to be able to ride any kind of horse, (hot, calm, green, skittish, etc, etc) but that also comes with practice and experience
nqdDe3cJaa	not sure.  perhaps you should ask this question in a science or physics section, im sure they could answer your question MUCH better than your typical baseball fan.  i cant think of any time when a batter got his arm broken by a pitch, but im sure it has happened.  the hand or the wrist happens all the time, but the arm is a little harder to break.  on the other hand, they are countless times when a pitchers arm was broken by a line drive hit back up the box.|`|WrDGhduxaa	It is possible and it happens especially to the forearm and hands.  When a ball is thrown above 90 mph, it is going to hurt something it hits.  There are many factors as to whether a bone will break or not, the position of the arm, the angle of the hit, whether or not the arm was braced against the body or held rigidly.|`|p7ZgSPIDaa	Ask Rock,or the incredible slappy 'slap it' slapster

oHJ0ZEFqaa	I was initially suprised with the draft when the skins got both Kelly and Thomas. Unfortunately, I don't know if the skins will be able to utilize him correctly with Jason Campbell at the helm. I am not completely sold on him though I don't think he is terrible. I just feel that its a tired excuse saying that "he is still adjusting to the system". He will be playing in his 4th season, the 3rd season full season as a starter. Clinton Portis carried the team the first half of the season which was why he was an MVP candidate early. But after he slowed down, so did the team. The team is suspect but has an opportunity to be a contender if they get it together. Kelly will become along the lines of a Dwayne Bowe, a dependable target if he stays healthy. We've seen what thomas can do working the middle. I'm an Eagles fan actually but if the redskins can bring it together, they can do some damage.|`|GwawzO5Faa	Not as long as he's on the Redskins.

v0MlomPoaa	He was released by the Mets, July 12, 2007.  Then signed withe the Braves, July 18 and was placed on the team's active roster. On August 1, just 13 days after the Braves signed him, the Braves designated Franco for assignment. He accepted a minor league assignment on August 8 and was called back up as promised on September 1, where he finished out the season.  He declared free agency on October 29, 2007.     Franco began the 2008 season as a first baseman for the Tigres de Quintana Roo (Cancun) in the Mexican League, in hopes of signing with a Major League team later.    On May 2, 2008, he officially announced his retirement from baseball to his Mexican league team, the Quintana Roo Tigers. An official announcement was released the next day.  http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/...     He played for the Philadelphia Phillies, Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers, Chicago White Sox, Milwaukee Brewers and Tampa Bay Devil Rays, in the Major Leagues.      He also played with the Chiba Lotte Marines in Japan, with the Samsung Lions in South Korea, and in Mexico with the Angelopolis Tigers and the Quintana Roo Tigers.    He also played on a few Dominican League teams in the Carribean winter leagues during his career.    In the affiliated minor leagues, he played for the Butte Copper Kings, Central Oregon Phillies, Peninsula Pilots, Reading Phillies, and Oklahoma City 89ers before making the majors, and with the Rome Braves and Richmond Braves, in 2007.    Someone added up all the hits from all those teams and it came to 4,226.  Only Cobb and Rose can claim more hits as a professional.    He's is currently living in the Dominican Republic.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Julio Franco was released by the mets during all-star break in 07.

LpR9sLSlaa	The Cards are "considered" the home team, even tho the game isn't in Glendale (their real home field)  This is the NFC's year to be the home team, it alternates every year    I don't think it'll be any advantage to them tho,   I'll bet the Steelers have a lot more fans at the game    to watch them get their 6th ring|`|oYsSL991aa	None - The game was at a neutral site    The Cardinals were the designated "Home" team, which means they got to pick whether they wanted to wear colored or white jerseys.  They also get to choose their sideline (near side or far - near side is usually advantageous), and practice at the host team's practice facility most seasons.  (The "visiting" team practices at a nearby college or other facility)|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Neither. They're playing at a neutral site.|`|AA11601225	The Cardinals will, but the only "advantage" is that they get to pick their jerseys.

onvpwieHaa	In 2002 the All-star game was in Philly.     The NBA gives each team a chance to host the All-star game.

I hope Orlando and Miami will get the next bids since they hadn't' hosted since the early 90's,It gets kind of old to see the West wear the home uniforms almost every year.|`|2meTcR8laa	Just since they haven't hosted it yet because a couple years ago it was in Philly, Chicago, and Miami|`|lJrlg5b8aa	Because all the cool people are on the West.|`|0c7ff2733514381d048fdc22049ffd46aa	West is the best!!|`|jorawDndaa	Well I believe that since the west has been dominating the championships and the sell out arenas more often than the east does that's why they do it on that side. I am on the east and I seems not fair but now the talent is on the east. East is rising with bright future, for example the  1 team in the west L.A. lost to the Pistons, Pacers, Magic and Bobcats and Miami.That's 5 out of there 9 losses. The west is dying out on being the harder conference. So it wouldn't surprise me if the next couple years will be in the east.

XnhJZQvfaa	If you really want to improve your Vertical jump, first you need to figure out what type of Jumper you are, a power jumper or a leaper, as using optimal biomechanics is just as important as having explosive muscle power. Next you need to figure out what type of power or strength you are lacking. The three basic types of strength are: Base strength, transitional power, and explosiveness or "Reactive" power, they are all different and must be trained in different ways. Now I know a lot of you are wondering what's the difference between the three. Well in short Base Strength is how much weight you can move, Transitional Power is how fast you can move said weight and explosiveness is the maximum speed and distance you can move said weight with each single movement. A good Vertical Jump training routine will include the following exercises:    Base Strength   1: Traditional Squats and Pistol Squats   2: Deadlifts/base building olympic lifts   3: Lunges   4: Core Work (Functional Performance Core Strength= The ability to make your pelvis and spine "lock" and work as a single stable unit, not simply having a 6 pack or being able to do 100 crunches)   5: Stretching    Transitional Power:   1: Box Squats/Tempo Squats   2: Power Cleans   3: Push Press   4: Core Work   5: Stretching    Explosiveness:   1: Ballistic and jump squats   2: Traditional and Compound/Hybrid Plyometrics   3: Sprinting   4: Core Work   5: Stretching    You'll also want to figure out which individual muscles/muscle groups are working inefficiently. You can figure this out by completing a full vertical jump test progression and a baseline fitness test to diagnose any muscle imbalances that you may have. Remember no matter what type of training program you do you must make sure that opposing muscles are strengthened and balanced (e.g. Quads and hamstrings, abs and lower back) so don't skip the quad extensions and hamstring curls. If opposing muscles are not strengthened they will lead to weak links, energy leaks and imbalances will result in poor poor or slow improvement and raise the risk of injury significantly. Do a routine that combines plyomertic/bodyweight, free weight and or acceleration routines. Make sure you are consuming lots of protein to aid in muscle repair after tough workouts You'll also want to replenish your bodies ATP and glycogen stores as they are the fuel for those type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers you will be (AKA FG and FOG) shredding during your workout. In order to gain inches you'll need to tax your central nervous system and force your body to create new motor pathways. If you train correctly you should gain at least an inch a week. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTy...    Jump 20 inches higher in 10 weeks:  http://www.program51.com|`|3OV4Pl64aa	the left hand is simple  just practice with it  when ur in the gym alone just do layups, run the length of the court and finish with your left hand, and dribble with it  use ur right hand as little as possible    u can run faster by doing sprints  if your school has a track, run one lap as fast as you possibly can, then walk half of the track allowing urself to gain a little more energy, and then run a full lap again    as for jumping higher  calf raises and jump rope  its the best way    hope this helps|`|DkwgogXZaa	aren't there basketball drill DVD's?...you should google those...see what you get...good luck
4GHJlTkkaa	The best way to work on your left is just practice practice practice.  If you are running to get in shape, dribble a ball with your left while you are running.      To increase your vertical jump you can do many things.  You can hit the gym and work on machines that will strengthen your legs, specifically your calves.  There are also special shoes that are designed so you only walk on your toes, thereby strengthening your leg muscles.   Most of these shoes come with an intense training regimen.     Good Luck!|`|WrDGhduxaa	to jump higher you need to lift weights and do plyometrics. To improve your skill with your off hand you must practice with it.  Make a habit of using only your left hand for at least half of the practice session.  if you let your dominant hand take over you will not improve the off hand.

OfNTLq3Qaa	I think some are completely disrespectful of others. Just because someone likes Cena does not automatically make them a little kid or an idiot. I don't like Cena but that is just my opinion. If you like the guy, then more power to you.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	Maybe there is an aspect of being unappreciative towards wrestlers. I think most of the blame goes to the writers and owners of the companies though. The guy who wrote that brings up Lex Lugar but he doesn't mention the drug use, why luger lost all his money, and how macho man's wife died from drugs in lugers home. There are always two sides to a story. And wrestlers do get forgotten after they retire.

The Rock started as a heel but the fans started to appreciate him due to his charisma. Stone Cold was a jobber, but after his epic battle with Bret Hart he became a main eventer. Now, the WWE force feeds wrestlers. John Cena is a talented wrestler. However, the WWE made him into a star. He didn't develop naturally. The WWE cares about selling merchandise, not appealing to the real wrestling fans. The WWE insults our intelligence by having Rey Mysterio beat guys more than twice his size (he eliminated Mark Henry at the Royal Rumble). It is a clear ploy to appeal to the Latino fan base. There's nothing wrong with that, but I just wish there was an element of reality in matches. Shelton Benjamin was a NCAA wrestling champ. However, since he doesn't have market appeal he's a perennial mid carder. Jeff Hardy isn't even a real wrestler, but he's champ since teenage girls think he's cute. Wrestling has become a joke. It started with this John Cena experiment. Cena will never be The Rock. That's why fans boo John Cena.|`|NWtgYyF6aa	being honest.i respect every athlete in wwe because they entertain us and put their bodies on the line every night.I dont particularly love all of them but i respect them|`|ikyij2g3aa	A lot of fans do appreciate the wrestler like me but they still hate on some....but not as a person but the wrestler/gimmick that the person is playing

sBdOzbx5aa	I wouldn't doubt Hatton's abilities  he will be ready to fight and he's tough.  He will be unlike any fighter Manny has ever fought in the sense that he is the reigning 140lbs. champ.  Manny only has one fight in welterweight and that was to a washed up De La Hoya.  Hatton is in his prime and far more dangerous then Oscar at this point because Oscar could not catch him.  Ricky will catch Manny no doubt,  but if Manny can absorb the shots he will ultimately get the better of it.|`|apY85Qmtaa	Maybe because there are more British people than Filipinos. All the British want Hatton to win and that doesn't surprise me.    However I believe Pacquiao will win and not because he's Filipino. He's proven that he compete with the best of them|`|Ef4HdzEfaa	I think you need to rephrase your question man. Most people especially on yahoo answers ride pacman's nuts till no tomorrow. So the question should be why are so many people doubting hatton to beat pacman. Im sure a lot of people favor Pacquiao to beat hatton more so than the other way around. I agree manny improves after almost every fight and has evolved from a straight up slugger/brawler to almost a complete fighter all around now. I personally think pacman will beat hatton though to be honest i would prefer if he loses. Hatton gets too much credit himself and is over rated .... he is a straight up brawler not a boxer and his skills/talent is very limited. Though in hatton's defense he has a ton of heart, he is always determined in all of his fights, he has good power and always presses the action. But manny also has these qualities along with others thats why i personally favor manny to win. Hatton is still a little big for manny so its still gonna be a toss up who comes out on top. The size difference may still prove to be too much for manny , we have yet to see manny in the ring with a natural 140+ lb fighter who actualy is gonna fight back. I just get sick of all the people saying manny can hang with the true welter weights (147lbers) because they need a reality check. Example mosley would punish manny in the ring but most people on here would say manny can and will beat him... based all on what happened when manny fought oscar. Which people dont seem to understand was a FLUKE ... oscar was either completely shot or just showed up for a paycheck... 1 of the 2 or both it was pretty obvious that oscar didnt even try... didnt even fight back, barely even defended himself.|`|2f0d8b0ba23a243ba5699d5b29e7002baa	hatton wins 11 rounds  to damaging|`|PzaJO1Ekaa	hatton may be strong but he is a pub brawler. manny will outbox him. so why do people still think he's good enough to beat manny.

AA11459304	Margarito was the most avoided welter weight because of the unknown substance hidden in his hand wraps. Just kidding the results on the hand wraps aren't back yet. But he could take a punch until recently.|`|PzaJO1Ekaa	he's not afraind cuz his gloves are filled with plaster of paris. that's the sh!t casts are made out of. you would definitely be braver with that kind of "insurance"|`|I9Y6fxguaa	I am with you all the way 10-4 Even-though Shane got him. Margo learned the hard way.|`|QYB6oRacaa	I'm sorry but beside but Mexican fighters are not babied to the top - that makes no sense.    Plus you have so MANY great Mexican fighters that to choose Margarito over them is - well a reach    From    Chavez to Barrera to Miguel Angel to etc etc etc you have seen some good boxers that have been involved in wars and have lots of spirit ....    I can't say anything bad about Margarito because he took out Cotto, but who other? Sugar got on that butt from Round one and prove that he is not over the top!|`|jHqV6yUxaa	What about Juan Manuel Marquez?   Israel Vazquez?   Rafael Marquez?     All these guys have heart. They leave everything in the ring.

a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	Well, I don't see the Jets taking a CB at all. They've got one of the best in the league in Darrelle Revis, and they're hoping Dwight Lowery will develop into a solid  2. Even if they're not sold on Lowery, I can't see them drafting a  2 CB that early.    Derrius Heyward would make more sense, and I don't think Houston needs a WR, so Maclin could also be available. They really need a QB, though. If SF takes Sanchez, I think they'd consider taking Josh Freeman.    Other than that, most of the picks make perfect sense, and even the ones I disagree with I've seen go that way in "experts" mock drafts. Nicely done.|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	no way the texans take maclin. they have enough receivers. they need help on the defensive side. laurinitis or maualaga? :)|`|8fe3c5c628ca1e4652c6de261ec861bfaa	The Lions main need is everything on defense and offensive line, not QB.    I see them taking Andre Smith or the best defensive player, maybe Aaron Curry.|`|gF6pgy8raa	Eugene Monroe will be picked before Michael Oher. Aaron Curry won't fall that far. Jags won't take Orakpo. They traded up last year to get Derrick Harvey. Texans won't take a WR. Falcons need D.Baltimore needs secondary and Jason Smith will not fall that far. Chung will not go first round.|`|PMluTf72aa	it doesn't look too bad.  i don't see the Lions drafting a QB yet.  i'm sure they'll look to put their future franchise QB in a better situation.  Jon Kitna still has a couple years yet.  i see the Lions drafting 2 offensive lineman and a defensive lineman in the first round and their first 2nd round pick.  therefore, i see Andre Smith from Alabama going to Detroit.  as for Green Bay, they'll get the 330 pound NT from Boston College, BJ Ragi.  this is because they just changed their defense to the 3-4.  also, Green Bay hasn't taken an offensive lineman in the first round a quite a few years.  i don't expect that to change, but they may definately go after an OT in the 2nd or 3rd Round.  also, the Vikings wont draft a TE because Visante Shianco just had a breakout year.  i can't imagine the Steelers avoiding their OL yet again.  Roethlisberger needs better protection.|`|KTp27Fokaa	Here are my disagreements    6- I think the Bengals are happy with what they saw out of Cedric Benson near the end of the year. I expect them to take an offensive lineman, or maybe Aaron Curry if he falls there.    12- The Broncos had the 12th ranked rush offense in the NFL, and I think the 29th ranked defense. They have to go after defense. Raji or Maulaluga.     28- I don't think they go RB in the first round. They might go with a big offensive lineman (Andy Reid likes big lineman)    15- The Texans have bigger concerns on defense. The offense was very good. They might get a secondary WR off free agency.    otherwise I agree. Nice job.|`|rjuqrHK7aa	The Bengals do not need chris wells. He will have no luck without a line to run behind. They definalty need to go OL in the first round and maybe RB in 2 or 3. I would like a pass rusher in 2 and resign Cedric Benson.    Cedric Benson started 10 games after he was signed. He had 214 carries and 747 yards. That is 3.5 yards per carry. 20 catches for 185 yards. The Bengals gave up 51 sacks this season. That is 3 most in the NFL. I am a Bengals fan and watch every game. Trust me. Ask any smart Bengals fan and they will tell you the same.    Here is a story by the Bengals beat writer who says the same thing.|`|Roes9U61aa	Don't you have Chris Wells kind of high in the draft?|`|bjKK3uXMaa	Texans have 2 good WR right now.|`|tNerdFYsaa	I think its a pretty good mock, but i think the Jets try to trade up in order to get malauluga and then get a corner later in the 2nd with their pick from N.O. via Jonathan Vilma. I also don't agree with Beanie going that high...and also i think your right with the Phins taking Harvin...there offense is based on getting the ball out of Pennington's hand quickly, and Harvin would be another compliment to the receiving core of Camarillo, Bess, Ginn, etc all fast.
1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	Of the six, Kevin Von Erich was the best wrestler, Terry Gordy was the best brawler (though David Von Erich was a good brawler, as well), Kerry Von Erich was the powerhouse, and Michael Hayes was, by far, the best on the mic.    The Von Erichs were a great team because they were brothers and trained together.  The Freebirds were a better team because the three guys just clicked together; they traveled all over the U.S. taking on every team around.  The Von Erichs weren't a regular tag-team, they came together when necessary to fight common enemies.  The Freebirds WERE a tag-team (and a frequent opponent for the Von Erichs) and they fought everybody.    When WCCW was on top of the world, and the Freebirds and the Von Erichs were in their prime, that was the 80's.  Those two teams waged a hellacious war against each other.    I was a Von Erich fan even before I ever got to see them wrestle.  I used to read about them in the wrestling magazines in the early 80's.  When I finally got to see them they became some of my favorites (especially Kevin).    While I appreciate how good the Freebirds were (especially Gordy), they were the bad guys and I rooted against them, especially vs the Von Erichs.    Both teams are on my list of greatest tag teams of all time but I was always a huge Von Erich fan (still am).|`|c4945703897699a06e7537baffebe49caa	Freebirds, they had more of a "presence".|`|7u7N8gkiaa	the von erichs|`|Q1MI6L96aa	The Freebirds played a major role in professionally pushing the kids to incredible matches. Also, the Bad Street, USA, song and music video brought a new element into the marketing of pro wrestling.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	Von Erichs because I liked the Freebirds but I have always liked the Von Erichs better.|`|lTlaNwtgaa	whhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh the 4 horsemen|`|UWJinEbIaa	Heels drive the wrestling business....when they broke up the Freebirds the company went to hell.   Turning Michael Hayes face was a bad idea!|`|cjknXzm9aa	freebirds. they had the whole punk rocker look and they seemed really cool.
9wblT5sYaa	not a chance in hell!  did you know that the Bills have the cheapest price tickets in the league?  I love those Bills and this city would be devastated if they played more than one game a year in Toronto.  it ridiculous.  lets play a game in the rogers center with the roof closed when we could be playing in the ralph without a wild sold out crowd instead.  it makes me sick to think about it.    as far as Sabres tickets would go, I wouldn't trade anything for my family's seasons.  but wouldn't you pay huge bucks to see them play in air canada or the bell centre or a place like that?  I would, I think it would be well worth it|`|a6EndAPiaa	No I would not.  I am not even willing to pay the regular prices to see a Redskins game ($25 - $75 for parking) and a minimum of $100 per ticket.
7B9KEqCnaa	The answer is it depends.  You can fumble forward and if you team gets the ball back its where you recover it, is where the ball is spot.  There are exception to this rule though is inside, the exceptions are on 4th down if you fumble the ball is spotted where the ball carrier fumbled the ball, and inside the last 2 minutes of the game, the ball is also spotted were the ball carrier fumbled.  Obviously these are the only scenarios where fumbling on purpose would make any sense, so no one if going to try and fumble on purpose in a game.|`|DOXKwdRfaa	NFL solved that long ago, you can't fumble forward.  even if you recover it, it will be brought back to the spot of the fumble.|`|bed9746a7bf18f598324f858a93ae28eaa	nope, forget what year they made the rule but its a flag    so you gotta just sell it so it looks realistic lol|`|f7qVtYfaaa	yeah the rules were changed to stop that from being attempted|`|vT4eybSyaa	You can't advance your own fumble|`|bppRqm6qaa	EVEN IF YOU COULD TELL IT WAS ON PURPOSE THERE'S NOTHING THE REFS REALLY DONT LIKE GETTING THAT TECHNICAL SO YEA YOU CAN FUMBLE ON PURPOSE TO GAIN EXTRA YARDS BUT I WOULDNT RECOMMEND IT UNLESS YOU KNEW FOR SURE THAT ONE OF YOU TEAMMATES WOULD RECOVER|`|ak44mIy3aa	Well if you are not passed the line of scrimmage then yes, but if you are pass the the line of scrimmage they will probably call forward pass.  The only way that it can be validates is if you got hit and then let it go but odds of getting the ball back is like 1 in 20 you gamble too much.
Cb5N6UaQaa	I never hate teams perse. I can hate players. When a player thinks he is the best when he really is not, that infuriates me. When they are always complaining to the officials than also grind my gears. And they are just plain dumb that is also a trigger for me to hate them. I normally don't hate on anyone but Paul Pierce has gathered all this characteristics that I have just described a moment ago. So, Yes I hate Paul Pierce and those are the reasons. Plus!!!!  How he dares to go out the court in a wheelchair??? To start running on the bike and then play like nothing????  He is a drama queen and a THE REAL FAKER.     Answering your real question. Always the most loved and hated teams are the ones with the most wins or with the most superstars on them. A superstar gives the team an identity (to love or hate). Without an identity you can't either love them  or hate them as much as when you can imagine or remember the face of someone.    I hope this was what you were seeking in our answer.    EDIT: Sasha eats kids: So the Lakers don't show respect to themselves?|`|DIQSP48caa	I use to hate Michael Jordan, and the Bulls. I pretty much hated them after they beat my Lakers in 91'.

I'll elaborate a little further. I respect teams that build their roster through creativity, ingenuity and character. It's even more rewarding to see a team build with young stars, have the stars reach their potential, go through playoff wars together and gradually improve and reach the top. Acquiring players to play roles and fill in gaps is one thing, but what Boston did is not noble and their title, in my mind only, has a huge asterisk on it. They had 15 wins and were the laughingstock of basketball 2 years ago (along with the Knicks) and were DYING to land Greg Oden (the fans were chanting Oden with 20 games left in the season). They then lost the draft lottery, traded 7 players for KG, traded the 5th pick for Ray Allen and 8 months later ran the table. The "Celtics" didn't win the title, three-fifths of an Olympic team won the title. The "Celtics" were the kids they drafted from 4-5 losing seasons (West, Gomes, Al Jeff, Gerald Green, Tony Allen, Perkins, etc). Danny Ainge pulled these deals off to save his job and got bailed out by the fledging Sonics situation and one of his close friends in Kevin McHale. 25 other teams in the league would not have had the market power to lure these two hall-of-famers at once and would have had to ride it out with their young nucleus like Philly, OKC, Indiana, Sacramento and so many other teams are doing. If Ainge had any nobility, he would've rode it out and would currently be looking at a very good team of Pierce, Rondo, Al Jeff, Jeff Green, Delonte and others. But no, the almighty Celtics couldn't handle more rebuilding. That can only be tolerated in "lesser" sports cities. So instead of Danny Ainge being looked at as the GM that put together 4-5 losing and non-competitive teams, he turned 7-8 draft picks into two hall-of-famers in the span of 2 weeks and ran the table and now he's a hero. I personally would prefer my team to NOT win the title and grow together with HARD WORK, then throw a team together like that out of desperation due to your GM's ineptness his first 5 years on the job. I know I'm in the minority, but thats why I'll be the one jumping up and down when LeBron wins titles over them in the next few years.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	the lakers are my team. that says who i hate. why do i hate the celtics? there bandwagoners.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXPZVPIj...|`|KdhNCnEjaa	I hate the Lakers because their fans are incredibly cocky and show no respect for the best team in NBA history.    The Celtics are the most hated and most loved team because people hate us cause we are so good and our fans love us because we have tradition, lucky, and the dancing fat guy in the 12th row.    EDIT: I still dont understand how anybody can call Boston fans bandwagoners...We sold over 75% of the seats in the season we went 24-58, not even close to the bottom of the nba in attendance, and we sold out fenway as we watched the Red Sox go for 86 years without a championship.    EDIT: And also, how can the person below call Boston cheaters when the Lakers had the most biased game in NBA history, game 6 against the Kings several years back. Even the NBA investigated it but Stern did not want to make officiating an issue. Whose a cheater now LA??? Who is a cheater now? Thats right I actually know basketball and dont get it from the bottomline of espnnews. **** YEAH    http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?game...    Read it and weep you Laker Bitches    "Los Angeles went nearly six minutes without a field goal down the stretch in the fourth quarter, but made 18 free throws over the final 6:21 to hold off the Kings. Bryant made four free throws in the final 19.8 seconds for the Lakers, who shot a jaw-dropping 27 free throws in the fourth"|`|8hIs3dHsaa	The team will be in the same division and take my team's playoff spot. Most loved would be the Celtics, and most hated would be the Thunder.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	I hate all of the NBA. I will not support creating a band of multimillionaire thugs.

AA11459304	Antonio Margarito had his California boxing license suspended until conclusive test results are done on the hand wraps. If he did use a illegal substance on his hand wraps the commission will however deal with it. But the Cotto record will not be taken back regardless. Even though Margarito took every punch Cotto had to offer. The match may have been decided by the judges perhaps in the favor of Cotto. As I remember Cotto did most of the punching in the beginning & middle rounds. So if Margarito cheated I don't think it took away much from Cottos' punch. However, there's different kinds of plaster that will harden in the presence of moisture.|`|FPJSoxYwaa	Maybe they were using it to minimize damage to his knuckles.|`|WrDGhduxaa	He used an illegal substance in his gloves or wraps. He cheated, whether or not the term plaster of paris is correct or not does not change the facts.|`|l4WEwTWwaa	Well you sound pretty confident about this. So let me tell you what. I live in New Jersey and if you do too let me punch you in the face six hundred times with an inch and a half of plaster on my knuckles and afterwards you can tell me if it hurt or not? If you aren't willing to do it then you aren't very confident in your answer, so **** off and accept Margarito cheated.|`|4e2eba87c6aa4d888c7be6da88890d78aa	Maybe Margarito's team was not as smart as you and they tried to cheat anyway.  Either  way, attempting to cheat is just as bad as cheating.    I knew they should have hired a Dental Lab Technician to be in their corner!|`|NXrYtxFmaa	yeah to the top two.|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	You sure you're a dental lab tech?  I've had TONS of work done on my teeth, and never once had anything to do with plaster.    Now if you don't think that moist hand wraps coated with plaster wont have a cumulative affect when layered, you're just being silly.  Sounds to me like it'll strengthen in the same manner as fiber glass.    ***additional***    Ok there, my dental hygenist or whatever your are.  Use your mind and make conclusions.  Given that something was going on with the wraps, and I think it's fair to make that conclusion, otherwise there was no reason for them to be removed for wetness.  Do you really think the intent would be anything other than to gain an unfair competitive advantage?  Certainly they wouldn't alter the wraps to help out Mosley.     The wraps were wet for a reason, dude.  That's uncontested.  The wet wraps were pulled for evidence.  Now it's time to make a conclusion.  The wraps were thinly coated with plaster, thin enough to the point of being unnoticeable.  Then you layer it on, wrap after wrap, and you'll get what's basically a cast.  Plaster is white, the wraps are white, it seems like a relatively safe ploy in which to get away with.    The stuff you work with, I assume comes from the impressions made from the expanding goo that makes poor patients gag and vomit.  No doubt NONE of that stuff is reinforced.  It's pure plaster, which is good to protect against compaction, it has poor tensile strength,  That stuff no doubt busts up alot when you work with it.  HOWEVER, the wraps have great tensile strength and zero compaction strength.  When used in combination, it's a lot like the same affect rebar has on structural concrete.    TADAA!  You've got a weapon that won't crumble because the wraps protect against tensile failure and the plaster protects against compaction failure.  And I'd say that it takes about 45 minutes for the freshly wrapped plastered wraps to come into use in the ring.    Think it through, bro.

uRQEubkPaa	I don't know. but in this sport injuries are bound to happen.. The difference is weather they are serious or not..   Because you'll get sprang ankles, bruises contusions, scratches.. etc...    But if you know how to take care, you can avoid those serious injuries like broken bones.    The best way to protect yourself is by being aggressive, not to harm the opponent but if you go for a divided ball indecisive , most likely you'll end up hurt..|`|RAjycr4waa	I played growing up until i finished high school and never got hurt. its just a luck of the draw.
b994a4f27ea4a38742bd550caa568bbdaa	you just gave all the reasons HHH is good.  the pedigree is the worst finishing move?  and edge's spear isn't?  i'd rather get speared by edge than get pedigreed by anyone.  lacks athleticism?  compared to the undertaker he is the most athletic athlete on earth.  i understand you are young wrestling fan who loves edge, but as you get older and learn about what you are watching you'll eventually get it.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	I agree with you. HHH is a product of his marriage now. Otherwise, could he be on ECW? I'm sure he had the say to be the second to last out of the rumble. If he weren't married into ownership he would have been out of the rumble in the middle of the pack, not last. He puts input on the script, it goes on and on. I don't mind if he is a behind the scenes guy, but it's time to pick one or the other. Writing and scripting or wrestling.|`|n55Vb81Faa	Triple Homo is an overrated wrestler , he is in this level just because he is married to vince's daughter|`|KIOR56r6aa	HHH is the biggest bastard in the business.

Paul Wight(Big Show)is better than Paul Levesque|`|oSA9Wsv1aa	The Game=The one to beat, the one you are looking for when your looking for the best.He's what 12 time world champion. He just has that appeal to Wrestling fans. Now Edge is supposedly humping Mr Guerrilla, or vicky. They all have something.I can't stand orton but he's part of the show. Now quit sniveling, change your diaper and get with the program.|`|4c21e2f4c011e6cd394d8baf6024f878aa	First, the Undertaker's name isn't Paul, it is Mark.  So that blows your best Paul arguement.    Second, the Pedigree is a better finishing move than Cena's FU, or Miz and Morrison's finishers, or even MVP's finisher.    Third, he's called the Game because he is master at studying the game.  As in studying his opponents, etc.    Forth, wrestlers are suppose to "entertain" us.  If that includes telling jokes, that's part of the business.      Fifth, you can't count all of his success just because who he is married to (some yes, but not all)    Lastly, I'd take HHH over Edge anyday.  Edge needs help from other wrestlers to win lots of his championships.  When was the last time Edge won a title on his own ability???

JD5NQxeNaa	Larry Bird has been raving about Granger for quite same time now. No way he is traded and Bird wants to clear the bad boy image the Pacers once had. How would he do this by bringing in J.Ho?    I think my Knicks are going to get back Camby hooray! Nate to the Blazers so he can be reunited w/ Roy. Q to the Clippers and Knicks get Camby who will sign on a vet minimum so he can play through 2010 w/ the 2 All-star FA's we get. We will also get Frye back, but just for this year though, since his contract us up and we do not need him for the long term.    I can see the Marion/O'Neal trade as a possibility.|`|25ymUKdraa	i think the trade between j.o'neal and marion(bad trade for the heat) will push through.. im also looking forward if the mavs will give up j.howard and who will they get... danny will stay as a pacer.. i hope..|`|i9FLcvb7aa	Jermaine O'neal will be traded to the Celtics and Marion will end up a bull.|`|875b8a67d51aea3c2aba301f8e93dbe2aa	The suns will trade Steve Kerr to TNT|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Shawn Marion to the Knicks for Eddy Curry, Malik Rose, and a 2nd round draft pick.    The D'Antoni Marion reunion!|`|UcHqXPpvaa	http://games.espn.go.com/nba/features/tr...    Good trade for all three teams.   Chicago: Loses a lot of great role players and guys they have coveted a lot. However, gains the thing they absolutely lack and so sorely need. A big time post threat to pair with Derrick Rose. Stoudamire says he wants to be the premier guy, well he and D-Rose will be the premier players in Chicago for years to come, and likely win some championships. They also get a young center prospect and lose a guard from their guard glut.   Milwaukee: They've been shopping Villinueva to avoid giving him a contract extension at the end of the season and have been disappointed in Alexander thus far. With Redd out, they need a solid shooting guard to step in for the remainder of the season. Barbosa is fully capable of doing this, and can step into his perfect role of 6th man when Redd returns. They also get a young and very solid backup center to Bogut.  Phoenix: This trade helps them now and in the future. Stoudamire has been asking for a trade, so they may as well get something in return. Of the 5 players they get, 4 are under the age of 25, and at least 4 are ready to contribute immediately. Villinueva proves to be a competent replacement for Stoudamire, Gordon is an upgrade to Barbosa and the perfect 6th man for Phoenix. Nocioni and Alexander allow the Suns to get younger and better at the sf and pf spots. They can let go of aging Matt Barnes and Grant Hill after the season, and come away with a player of the present and perfect first forward off the bench in Nocioni, and a definite starting sf of the future in Alexander. Joakim Noah will also be a perfect f/c off the bench to complement a pg like Steve Nash, and can eventually be a defensive beast. The Suns get deeper, younger, and can save some money after this season with this trade.     I think it's a win-win-win.|`|rTbKXMMpaa	I saw micheal redd coming to cleveland but not anymore. I think Marion will be a raptor and oneal will be a heat center|`|KUs15suVaa	My gut says that either Marion will end up a Raptor, in favor of O'neal or a King in favor of Salmons and Miller.|`|2VVgxFDKaa	Danny Granger is there franchise player!!!!!! are you crazy? Anyways, Marion will get traded along with Josh Howard and possibly players from Phoenix too|`|EsnFmcMFaa	I heard Elton Brand is on the market.    If he is I see my Wizards trading Jamison for Brand|`|52oWf2xMaa	I agree with the Marion trade since Pat Riley has not denied it but he is concerned with O'Neal's knee problems. It might not go through because of it. Pacers will never let go of Granger since he is their current franchise player.     The Bobcats might trade Felton since there are lot of rumors about him being shipped somewhere in favor of D.J Agustin starting.    The Knicks are also looking for intreseted people in trading for David Lee.    The Bulls with their current position and the abundance of bargaining chips might decide to mov,their GM, Paxson has hinted making a move and Im not surprised that it might be with the Pistons since Joe is looking for a roster shakeup.    The Thunder might make a move but I dont see anything major.
QMZKV1pZaa	yes this is a great trade if you ask me. aldridge is not really that good and neither is j green, but amari stoudamire is one of if not the best power fowards in the nba, and he will start to warm up soon!|`|vF5lU8zeaa	basketballs GAY|`|cBJfldtEaa	I think they got the better end slightly, don't get conley though.|`|DkwgogXZaa	good trade...|`|JfVxCDb7aa	yes it was, ..good pick up

LnJjS8BRaa	Your exercise regimen for hockey should be fine for martial arts. If you want to learn submissions join a club. You'll get a lot more specific exercises from the class.|`|36u3Ml0kaa	do a lot of core work..that is key in fighting.  also do a lot of the basics: pushups, pullups, dips, bench, squat, lunges, shoulder press, calf press, flyes, cleans, medicine ball pushups, box jumps, etc.  Also be sure to get a lot of cardio work in-running is great and the best but also try to mix it up a bit and ride the bike or try the eliptical.  For submissions I would suggest joining a club, there are clubs all over now a days depending where you live.|`|JpJnhkmDaa	Pull ups  Push ups  Squats  Dips  Calf rasises   Shrugs      DO cardio alot of cardio    Stretch to gain flexibltiy     thnks|`|ldGz9UoBaa	Push-ups are by far the best they increase punching power and make the chest more resistant to damage.|`|vqm10k3Jaa	I voice for the club idea.  You sound like you'd want to be a sort of submission fighter so it'd be good to have someone demonstrate and show you in person.  As for your training, your hockey training would most likely keep you in good shape, not to mention the additional training you get in the club or gym, depending how often you go and how much time u spend there

There are few players that have the ability to make others better. If it wasn't for him players like Richard jefferson might never get the attention they have had. He is a great passer and decision maker on the court (only in the court) plus a great rebounder. It's extremely hard to make triple doubles and it's even harder being a point guard and he is among the All Time leaders in that category. He led the Nets to 2 NBA Finals with a not very good teams to lose, but still deserves the recognition he has. I recommend you see footage from his years in Phoenix and Dallas when he was just a kid for order for you to see why he is such a big deal now.

Mqurv3LXaa	Bobby Ryan has been impressive.  However, Steve Mason gets my vote. He has played like a premier goaltender for a "lackluster" team.  Ryan has great teammates, Perry, Getzlaf, Niedermayer, etc. So its harder for teams to isolate Bobby Ryan because of all those other stars.  Steve Mason is on a team with one premier player, which is Rick Nash. Mason faces much more pressure being a goaltender in the Western Conference.|`|qRfciActaa	If he keeps up his current pace. Unfortunately Chris Mason is looking like heis going to run away with the award this year.

It's true that Defoe and Keane wasnt great before but that wasn't under Harry, he could be the one to make it work. There's also the fact that Harry didn't sign Pav and it seems to me he wants to make his own mark on the team, build his own team which could leave Pav sitting on the bench (I'm not saying Pav is a bad player, I think he's starting to adjust to the English game)|`|QDXnM1l6aa	who the **** cares about keane and spurs?

Nothing is going in New Zealand's favour since the last 1 year or so. Yes, I'll be expecting NZ to make this series a competitive one, rather than a one-sided series. But, expecting a series win against Australia, which is an absolutely great team at the moment, is going to be too much.|`|3k4tPNTGaa	Dont know but i want to see australia getting beaten by 0 in this series. I want to see australia in bottom of ICC rankings even after Bangladesh. Their players dont hv respect for any gud player so i dnt hv respect for any aiustralian player or australian team. I just wish they quit playing cricket.|`|pi18FGiwaa	Perhaps Au Stray Lia should lose their characteristic arrogance and adopt Justin Langer? After their downtrou LOSS to the Pro Teas..

I think NZ needs to get rid of their self doubt when they play Aust.  We do have agood chance as Aust are not playing good for the moment, but, beware the sleeping giant.|`|cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	Defeating a team in practice match is not a big deal.The Aussies are right now having problems with The Proteas.If the Aussies want to improve then they have do only 1 thing which is removal of White and Hopes.Otherwise the Aussies would be having a tough time with New Zealand.  Edit-I know about it.I was saying about their chances against NZ.It can only improve when they remove Tait,Hopes and White from the squad.|`|gfxXikenaa	Australia will win~    Justin Langer made one of the the best opening pairs with hayden in history of test cricket ~   nice to hear he's still playing first class~|`|8FUAMccRaa	well, the kiwis are nearly as bad as the bangers these days, it should be fairly easy for the aussies.    Man of Series-Ricky Ponting|`|vQtW48riaa	I really don't think New Zealand should be underestimated.    There team is made for ODI's. Most of the New Zealand batsmen have simple but effective techniques for One Day Internationals. It won't be the walk over it was in the Test matches, regardless of what happened in the Tour Match.    NZ finally have a settle squad (which can't be said for the Aussies) Taylor and McCullum are always dangerous, Jesse Ryder is explosive, and there bowlers will always be effective because they are just plain accurate.    Also NZ haven't lost an ODI series for a while.    With the confidence the Aussies have at the moment, NZ have a chance, but still on Paper Australia are the stronger team.    Langer's still a great player.|`|rrDs6Dw4aa	NZ usually play well against Australia, I dont know why though. If NZ get beaten 5-0 to SA in an ODI series, they somehow have the knack to beat Australia 5-0.|`|8w9JZlaGaa	you have no chance what so ever      1. Non of your openers is reliable  2. your bowlers are crap  3. your middle order sucks     The win you talking about is a fluke, it cant be taken seriously  you cant expect Bangladesh to win an ODI series against any of the teams in the world  but  you can expect them to have a fluke win once in a blue  moon.|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	New zealand will make australia work hard but in the end australia should win this series.. Alot depends on captain vettori|`|Y31Ci8vlaa	Australians are in with a great chance.The whole series will not be too easy for aussies as kiwis are strong enough to be competitive.They are powerful with mccullum,vettori and some young players.Australia is powerful with its bowling attack.The weak points are newzealand pace order and australian middle order.The australian middle order's performance will play a key role in this series.Mike hussey,ricky ponting should be up for the task.On the whole advantage stays with australia.|`|YJM6Ouujaa	i would love to see my fellow kiwis more competitive . but sadly they dont have enough good ,experienced players. Going with Aust. here. but not a whitewash|`|hTruYNUQaa	I'm confident that Australia can beat New Zealand.The Kiwis dont have as good a bowling attack as the South Africans.    It will be a competitive series played in the right spirit.|`|gz2M5hsBaa	You can't write off either team. Both teams are in a development stage after a huge number of retirements.     We're watching the future of cricket here, this series will show us which new players can cut it at international level.
Uathep5Yaa	Lot of Depth up Front    Iggy, Bert, Langkow, and Camalleri all provide good primary scoring    Bourque, Glencross, Moss, Conroy and Lombardi all are good secondary scoring.    3 top D men, Phaneuf, Regehr and Aucoin, also Sarich and Giordano fill in nicely.    Excellent Goaltending with Kipper.    Very Good team top to bottom, I don't see them making it past the 2nd round, If they got into a series with Detorit, the Wings would get way too many power plays for the Flames to overcome but it would be an interesting series|`|UhL7m301aa	I honestly don't think Calgary is that underrated. 11 points out is a long way to make up with the way the NHL is constructed right now and all the 3 point games that are occuring.      That being said, they are a team that will probably be hell to play against in the playoffs. They have top end talent up front (Iggy, Langkow, Camalerri, Bertuzzi) and a really good goalie in Kipper. The flames are a team that probably won't finish above 5th or 6th but could easily make a deep run.|`|PwED69Isaa	As a Blackhawks fan, it's hard to say the Flames are underrated. They are 0-2-1 against the Hawks and outscored 14-5 in those 3 games. So what I have seen is far from impressive. I know any one team can have another team's number, and that doesn't make either team great or subpar... I just haven't seen anything to say they should be getting any better recognition than they currently are.|`|AA10068004	I don't think they are underrated. I do think some may of said 7th or 8th because I think many expected their division rivals to be much better (improved) this season. Calgary is a decent team as of late, no doubt about it. Granted, 14 of their wins are against sub-500 teams, they have also beat some excellent teams like San Jose (x2), Boston, and Caps. But like you said very early to tell. They could crash just as easy in the second half of season.|`|Mqurv3LXaa	I feel that if Calgary is able to implement a solid defensive scheme, then they will enhance their chances of winning.  During the off season Calgary brought in solid, team oriented guys.  Calgary has the star player (Iginla, Kiprusoff), and the solid secondary tier players (Cammalleri, Bertuzzi, Langkow,Etc.)|`|qdg8G12Iaa	No.Calgary has been a streaky team the last few years,but this year i think Kipper is playing much better.Adding Cammaleri was huge too.He has taken a ton of pressure offf Iggy.I think the rest of the NW division is weaker than past years so that also contributes to their success.I think they need more scoring from their 3rd and 4th lines.Moss is having a good year,but i think Lombardi has been disappointing.A guy with that much speed should be scoring a lot more.I dunno if calgary will have the depth to take out a team like Detroit or San Jose in the playoffs.As a Flames fan though i hope i am dead wrong.|`|nxS7Yzydaa	Calgary is a very scary team. They have a lot more speed than last year and are a very good team. They handed San Jose their first regulation loss at home a few weeks ago. they have the potential of a stanley cup this year for sure but im not sure if they are "under-rated" because they are in third in a very hard conference with San Jose and Detroit.|`|HNEWf7ILaa	I think they're under-rated.

They are not bringing back Olshansky so they need another starter like Tyson Jackson or Duke Robinson to replace Goff at OG as he is old and not coming back. They need a LT so they can move McNeil to RT where he would be better. They need a ILB but they don't necessarily need Maualuga as bad as people say although it would be awesome. They need a DT in the 2nd or 3rd round to relieve Jamal Williams and for a future NT. Then they need a safety but this class is pretty weak with Delmas,Chung and Moore being 2nd rounders most likely and Moore is just bad. They do not need a RB cause they will just trade for Michael Bush from the Raiders if AJ releases LT. They need to trade down if no Maualuga or Oher at  16 and get:  1st:Tyson Jackson(25th) DE LSU  2nd:Fili Moala DT/DE USC (Dolphins 44th)  3rd:Rashad Jennings RB Liberty  4th:Kaluka Maiava LB USC  4th:Chip Vaughn SS Wakeforest  5th:Ray Feinga OG BYU  5th:Will Davis OLB/DE Illinois  6th:Tony Fiametta FB Syracuse  7th:Jose Valdez OT ARK  Sign: Mike Brown SS, Vernon Carey OT,Jason Brown C/OG that constitutes a great off season.Trade down for a 2nd rounder if Maualuga isn't there.

rv6zl5t3aa	Vladimir Sobotka or Petteri Nokelainen   Tuukka Rask   2nd or 3rd Round Draft pick    Kovalchuk   3rd or 4th round pick    Atlanta I'm sure wants to get younger and cheaper. Nokelainen is a former 1st rounder and just needs another system to play in. Sobotka has played well in the AHL, but need more ice time, he'd get that in ATL. Rask, we all know about him and is there a team that doesn't want him?    This would all have to be contingent on being able to sign Kovalchuk to a long-term deal. Would hate to have a Hossa trade and watch him walk after 1/2 a season and sign with MTL.    Bouwmeester and a 2nd rounder for Chuck Kobasew, Matt Hunwick and a 4th rounder.

Therefore, I would give you Mike Rupp (who's done next to nothing for us since scoring the go-ahead goal Game 7 of the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals) and Sheldon Brookbank (another example of "addition by subtraction," maybe they could help the Thrashers but they're not helping us), plus a draft pick or two, for Mathieu Schneider (I know, he's almost 40, but we just got Brendan Shanahan and Bobby Holik back and they're contributing) and, since Martin Brodeur can't play forever and Scott Clemmensen, as good as he's been, isn't exactly a kid, maybe a backup goaltender like Kari Lehtonen.

One can get from Orchard Park to the Rogers Centre in about 90 minutes (87 miles between the venues).    Anyway, to answer your question..............the answer is no.  Let's say for example, that the Montreal Canadiens are not a popular team in Quebec (it's hypothetical people!!!!!) and they have decided that in order to increase their popularity, they will play some home games in Quebec City.    1.  Le Colisee is nowhere near as nice as the Bell Centre (Rogers Centre fails in comparison to Rich Stadium)  2.  The average ticket price is 3x higher    Similar situation, and a similar answer.      The difference is that Ralph Wilson has no succession plan aside from his kids won't get the team.  Apparently he was very good friends with Ted Rogers (deceased a few weeks ago I hear) and they had talked about the possibility of the team moving to Toronto when Wilson dies, and this whole ruse is to see if a team would be successful.    The article in the Sun states that tickets were $500 - and they ended up giving most of them away.  Obviously people weren't interested in paying.  $500 for a regular season football game?   What do they think this is?  Hockey!!!!!!!        (By the way, I just read an article in the Toronto Sun from the Bills weekend in Toronto, the few fans they talked to all said it took between an hour and an hour and half to make the trip from Buffalo, Cheektowaga, and Amherst (home of Darryl Sittler, Harry Neale, and Scotty Bowman))|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	It only more money because the dollar is terrible right now, and there playing a game in Toronto as an experiment to see if they can move internationally, lets face it Bills have a fan base but there are 31 teams with a better one.|`|HNEWf7ILaa	Yeah, because I probably wouldn't have bought the tickets!

Either, Kemp, and Loney have another year under their belt which is going to help the Dodgers.  I am going to say the Dodgers win the division without Manny if these three young guys continue to improve and if Clayton Kershaw begins to show just how good a pitcher he is.  There is no question he is going to be a star, if he can stay healthy, and I believe he can help to put the Dodgers over the top in 2009.|`|7meJphJMaa	Dodgers have the best shot, and if they get Manny, they will definitely win.|`|XWvD81COaa	Rockies: even with manny, the dodgers don't have enough offense. Arizona (like colorado) has a shaky tail-end of the rotation but a crappy bench.|`|11aa82b4abe14e156d38f0970fb2d99daa	sorry,only if  some one makes a big move in the west to get  a pwerhitter will the dodger lose the division|`|gwUq6HMUaa	I agree, any team in that division that gets Manny takes it. If not though, I agree with you and go with the Diamondbacks.|`|EtEf098yaa	Arizona will win it.    Too many young players on that team that were around when that team fell apart.  SD has no one after Gonzalez and Peavy, SF's offense might be as bad as SD's, and I have a weird feeling if the reports about what in Torre's book is true, none of his players are going to play all that hard for him.   He supposedly throws everyone the yankees got since 2000 under the bus.  He didn't want Jason Giambi (defensive reasons).  Bernie left his wife and kid at yankee stadium after games.  Damon wasn't the player he was with Boston.   Everyone hated Pavano.  Wells and Brown were destructive.   Ok, maybe the last two we already knew, but what player is going to give their all to someone who just sold out the team that got him there?   Ari wins by 7 or 8 games.
s9Pwnb87aa	Follow your dream.|`|WTCvm1ufaa	How about college football? more schools = more job opportunities. Sad to say that a woman has never been a coordinator to my knowledge :(     Don't give up on your dreams. My friend's mom used to work for the NBA. You never know.    Good Luck!|`|a6EndAPiaa	The NFL probably has less than 1000 direct employees so I would say it is not very realistic.  You would be competing with lots of people who have the same dream.  It is good to dream and to have goals but it will not be easy to meet that goal.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	I have 2 answers for you...here goes...    the serious answer- While I think it wouldn't be easy I'm all for you following your dream. Perhaps if you start at a local level so you have some experience under your belt before applying for the NFL it will go better for you. Maybe a minor in event planning or sport theory or PR or sociology would also help in your goal. Good luck and I wish you the best.     the not remotely serious answer- I too want to work for the NFL. My plan is to start as a ball person, move to person that holds the chains then to a referee, next step high ranking NFL official for a few years then announcer on ESPN. Now heres why-I think I can make better calls then the current ref's AND I would be totally unbiased. I don't care about any team but the Ravens but since everyone makes calls against us I can even that out. Also I would like to change the rules of the game so they make more freaking sense. well that's the short version of the madness anyway....
wmWrcN0faa	He's a very well rounded player.  If he was a more aggressive scorer I think he would get a lot more respect, and would be considered a lot better player than he is.|`|UaSFuT59aa	I don't think he'd rank near the best players because it's not in his nature to be an aggressive scorer. That's what makes him a good ballplayer. He doesn't force the issue offensively and he's more of a facilitator and playmaker than a scorer. He has a solid 15 footer and good with both hands around the basket. He doesn't take too many ill advised shots. He showed with Phoenix in the playoffs a few years ago when Amare was hurt that when a team needs him to step up offensively, he can become a good scoring option, but only when needed. He doesnt have a great first step or a lot of explosiveness, so he'll never be a 10 free throw a game guy and thats why he'll probably never be a 20 point scorer in the league. He's good the way he is, a rebounder, facilitator and defender. That's his niche.|`|XnhJZQvfaa	That is not what kind of player he is and that is not what kind of player they need him to be night in and night out. He's only 2 points and 2 assist away from where he needs to be to make that team a playoff team (17, 7, 7). Boris is a good leader, he does what his team needs him to do to win games. If they need him to score that night he'll score 25, if they need rebounds he'll grab 13 or 14, they need him to dish he'll end up with 12 assist. Most European players are that way because wins and team success count more then individual stats there.     Jump 20 inches higher in 10 weeks:  http://www.program51.com|`|JD5NQxeNaa	He has an all-around game. In most versatile he is at the top w/ Tayshaun Prince, LBJ23, AK47, Lamar Odom, Josh Smith, etc.
1uSoU8Lpaa	I hate to say it, because I'm an optimist, but the Brewers have little chance and this is why:    Pitching. We have everything else in place-it's pitching. No Sabathia, No Sheets, a young Yovani Gallardo 1.88 (who will be great, note only 4 games last season DL) followed by Dave Bush 4.18, Jeff Suppan 4.96, Seth McClung 4.02 and Manny Parra 4.39...so yeah. It's going to be tough.|`|RW7qVMk5aa	Cubs. Nothing really standws in our way, but there is somthing holding us back.

That's another World Series question but i like ya so I'll let it slide Lol! Seriously though if the Yankees get their act together including Alex Rodriguez the Yanks have a very good chance to get back in it.|`|AA10349169	No...playoffs? yes!    I dont think I had a year where I thought my team could win the Championship, except maybe Duke|`|XzisJYoAaa	yes i think the rays will win the world series  the only thing in their way is how veterans like burrell and carlos pena can perform.i think they both have at least 2 or 3 great years left.and at least 5 quality years left.so it should be an awesome season|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	No team ever has a legitimate chance the World Series. It's improbable or unlikely. No team should expect that at the beginning of any season.|`|DjjCvjlnaa	Yea I think the phillies have a chance to win the World Series this year, They won it last year and they pretty much have the same team this year. The only thing i think is the problem is the starting rotation. I think we need a better rotation|`|yg3Pveakaa	As long as no notable Red Sox are released it would be ok..    But i think your Yankees got alot better having Texeira..|`|UxSF3Doaaa	Hmm. Well, it is highly possible with the W. Sox.  As for the Cubs, let's not even talk about it! LOL! But I am grateful they made the playoffs at all last year! Who knows....I so miss Sammy Sosa!|`|e4ekb1amaa	Phillies fan, and coming off a title, there is no reason why they shouldn't be in contention again this year. They kept most of their team together, and although pitching is a concern (as always), they have a good, strong line up.    That being said, I'm not holding my breath either. I'm not EXPECTING them to win it all, but I know they have a legitimate shot to do it, which is what I thought at this time last year as well. Because they still have such talent on the roster, anything less than a playoff berth would be considered a big disappointment by me.|`|nuLF8SqBaa	yankees|`|356cfec15f8450218c5dff174ffe1d5aaa	I'm a huge Blue Jays fan... and while always hopeful.  Answer is no.  Reasons:     1 Yankees!!  Trying to destroy baseball yet again, they just went too far this year and I will cheer for any team playing them.  MLB has to fix this baloney.    Other than that, let's see.. oh the yanks took Burnett which really hurts us, so we will hope our young guns come through.    Yes I'm bitter.|`|p7ZgSPIDaa	I wouldn't mind taken you to the world series.|`|JaK8P9Xbaa	yes|`|zdQgOzYXaa	Rangers. Not this year, but they could possibly be a serious contender in the next couple of years if they get some pitching...same as it has been my entire life.|`|GAomwKNhaa	I am an Indians fan and as long as we can stay healthy and Kerry Wood "closes," then yes we are going to the World Series. Yankees fans (95% of them) are fair weather fans who only like them b/c they win.|`|4cJuKxJbaa	As of right now even the Pirates & Royals are in first place!!! So anything is posible :)    Yes, I belive the Yankees have a liegit shot...however it is WAY to early to know!|`|Mqurv3LXaa	Colorado.  As an organization, we believe Carlos Gonzalez is a star in the making. We traded Matt Holliday, which was a move the organization was hesitant to make.  Nevertheless, we expect Tulowitzki to be healthy and regain his 2007 form. Todd Helton will be back for another year, and we hope Jeff Francis takes strives towards the ace we believe he can be.|`|cnssh7v3aa	Im a tigers fan and i hate to say it but they will end up gettin 4th place again so no world series for them|`|AUHsZvavaa	Well. Probably not. Braves probably will end up in third place.|`|1WBgYZYbaa	I think that The Yankees or the Red Sox have the best chance of winning a World Series!!!!!!!!|`|rv6zl5t3aa	Yes, the Red Sox have legitimate chance to win this year. Are they the favorites? No, that goes to the Yankees. But you don't win the WS in Jan. it's won in Oct. and "on paper" means nothing. Look at the Rays and Tigers last year.    The Division, will definitely be the major reason for not going to the series. There's the Yanks and now the Rays. The Sox never usually play well vs the Jays either. With the talent in this division it wouldn't surprise me to only see 1 of these 3 teams make the playoffs. With everyone beating up on one another over 19 games each, another team may sneak into the wild card.|`|7meJphJMaa	Yankees have a chance every year.  Thing that could keep them out, injuries.|`|ecwhBLnxaa	Yup they do Go Yankees !|`|2S0BkT7oaa	The NY Mets have been very close in the past few years.   Maybe this year will be the year for them?     Also the Red Sox have a pretty good shot..|`|6bxOT9qJaa	The Reds. Nope    We are hoping to get above .500, but if everybody on our team plays to their potential, we could get to the playoffs!|`|cH2tidNOaa	it really depends on how much they're willing to spend. we need manny and some pitchers. if we can do that, then yes, we should be good to go.|`|6776aca5f3e214a39f2baaa61927b183aa	mets.    i think the mets can get to the world series now that the pen is better.  phills are still good and may get in the way|`|geih5vR8aa	Giants?   No, I don't think there chance is legitimate. They lack in hitting, and the hitting they do have is unproven.    They have great pitching, maybe the best starting staff going into the season.    They have pretty good defenders, anchored by Bengie Molina at catcher.    They have enough in the minors to trade for a good power hitter, and there is talk about them signing Manny Ramirez. If they do either of those, or both, then they can easily take there division, and in the post season, anything can happen.. especially with great pitching and defense.|`|AA10392176	Boston Red Sox is my team so I gotta say them.  But I do think it's gonna be there division that gets in the way, gonna be some good games this season!|`|5ulr9xLQaa	There is no doubt in my mind that the Cubs will play the Yankees in the World Series and I will have to go to all 7 games when the Yankees stop the Cubs from winning the Series again.  The Yanks have no excuse this year.|`|52JjKvMuaa	Now that we have Petitte, the two big things will be how the we get along in the clubhouse and we need to stay healthy.  Another outfielder wouldn't hurt with Damon a ? and can Melky rebound from such an awful year.....?|`|tPV0MlgKaa	No,because of the pitching and the uncertainty at several positions: Third base,center field,starting pitching and second base.I'll also see if left field and shortstop were a fluke.|`|imXPYucSaa	honestly, no.  the twins are really young.  i say in 2 or 3 or maybe even 4 years they might have the sqaud to do it.  the central has been so tough the last few years.  their needs are in the bullpen, which is normally the strength of our team.  could really use right handed power hitter at 3b or in the outfield.  i think the starting pitching, team speed, and cluth hitting will be our strengths.  we arent going to outscore teams.|`|zMvGnlMraa	Yankees and I think they have a great shot at winning.  There are two things that can hold them back.  1 - The team doesn't play as a team as many of the players have not played together in the past.  2 - Players dont play to their potential (the number 1 reason why the Yankees didnt win every world series every year)|`|AlZPIAtmaa	It's springtime.  The equalizer for all baseball fans.  The greatest and most hopeful point in the season and in life, quite frankly.  If you are a fan and don't have hope at this point in the season you should find something else to do with your time.      Of course, my Los Angeles ANGELS SHALL be the CHAMPIONS of the WORLD in 2009!|`|omszEWSSaa	Yes i think the Red Sox have a very good chance this year. And i don't think we really have a weakness this year|`|AYkEwqRXaa	If the injury bug doesn't bite the Cardinals this year, they may have a chance.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	I just hope we dont collapse again. I think the mets are the second most embarrassing team in all of baseball. Cubs are 1st cuz of the 100yrs thing. Have u ever been kicked down and got back up? then kicked down again.. Im still getting up from last years collapse. I feel like the mets have no offense if delgado doesn't preform well never have a shot also we only have Johan as our really great starter. I really dont think we have the pieces to win it all unless we add manny and sheets.

I hope we can pull it off, but some management needs to be redone before we can be real contenders.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	Well, i think the BLue Jays have a good chance but a lot things stand in there way. (i.e Redsox, Yankees, offence etc.)|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	I BELIEVE this is the year that the Cubs are real errrr well I did until yesterday when I read the news they traded for Heilman. ahhhhhh    I still think they have what it takes...... gonna have to hit in the playoffs to get that monkey off their back.

ea90aa73ecafa2c9bdad4765c43da29baa	I am a 49ers and steelers fan and evenly switch off between the 2 and I know what you are going through i have had people quit because i started out as the niners and started to switch and they left. What you can do is get creative. when i play with the niners (who are very weak) i have to improvise so i run a no huddle offense and throw to the flat alot because no defenseve audible guards the flat. I also put Vernon Davis my TE in at FB and run alot of FB runs and it is almost a guranteed 4 yards and i have broken off 3 runs for TDs over 50 yards. Get clever put Turner in a FB and pound it up the middle with a no huddle and if they audible change your play to a pass and hot route turner to the flat. As far as guarding these big recivers what i recomend is go to the dollar formation and do a lot of man blitzes they can usally cover the big WRs and can get pressure on the QB or call a weak side CB blitz it will double the lead WR and get quick preuusre on the QB. good luck|`|J3kfQtViaa	in madden though, it doesnt matter what team you are because there is still good and bad football.  if they are passing go with some good coverage.  my favorite pass defense is cover 3 press.    Whatever you do, do a good mix of running the football and passing.  With atlanta you are gonna need to make some passes sometimes.  The hardest part of the game i think, is finding the receiver while also watching the defense.  youve gotta see whos open, or if you know someone is running a route youve got to wait for his break (unless of course he isnt covered.)  Also you need to not throw intot he safeties.  Youve gotta do all this while watching the defense, that to me is the hardest part.    If that isnt enough for you, lol, you also need to anticipate what the defense is doing, and make any changes to your plays accordingly.  if you see everyone crowding the line they are blitzing or have a good run D setup, so audible into a quick slant, or whatever pass play you think could work. if you see holes up front audible into a run play.  once you learn the controls audibling is quick and easy.|`|NHAKOXyXaa	The problem with this is the skill level your are playing with. You need to be patient with this one, observe how your opponent game style then you have to experiment with some defensive plays, stick with the one he's havin trouble with.    Ex. Common stupid players would make their QB scramble to breakdown your zone coverage. Best defense play with this should be CB blitz.

gUMucKOkaa	Nothing, they will remain as is. The perjury had nothing to do with his performance just as the gambling had nothing to do with Pete Rose's on the field performance.     Now, the steroids are another matter but I don't expect that baseball can really change any on the field performance marks.    Please don't infer that I am a Bonds fan or a Rose fan. I'm not.    Good luck.|`|5EuOTAjJaa	Nothing.    Same as Pete Rose's records.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	It will probably remain the same,but they should put a big " *  " there anyway."Before and after steroid use ".|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Nothing. What do his records have to do with his legal problems?|`|5xIroQjMaa	I don't know if you've read any of the recent reports, but now it's looking like Bonds didn't lie. Things are coming out that he was mistreated by prosecuters that knew he wasn't lying in the first place, because the products he took 1) weren't illegal then, and 2) didn't even contain steroids.|`|obPSaYf3aa	Nothing will happen to Barry's records, nor will any other record holders named in the Mitchell Report be affected either.  Since this trial is based upon perjury and not steroid usage, it will remain a legal issue and not as sports or medical issue.    If this trial was about "US vs. Barry Lamar Bonds" for the purpose of finding out if he had indeed used steroids, how much he purchased, who he bought them from, if he received them free, if any of his tests came out positive and if he lied about using them, then if he was found guilty, his records and career would be in jeopardy.    I believe that although steroids are regularly dispensed to players with legitimate injuries, there should be an alternative medication or treatment for those players instead of steroids, which just relieve swelling in extremities and allows for faster healing time.  My son broke his foot recently and received just motrin, vicodin, antibiotics (after his surgery) and a bone growth stimulator (electrical impulses) and thankfully no steroids!|`|sVPjp3dUaa	As long as Selig is in office, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING will happen to the so called records. Despite having done some good things for the game, he turns into a cowardly weasle when he has to make calls on some tough issues. This includes the entire steroid scandal. Knowing that the scandal could completely ruin his reputation, he 'ordered' the Mitchell Report to make it seem like he tried to do something about the scandal. If Selig had a sack, he would've begun an investigation years ago. Once the report came out, the least he could've done was ban from baseball for life players such as Bonds, Giambi, Clemens, etc. Bonds' records will stay put & we will continue to see the game mocked by fraudulent, slimy weasles like Bonds and Selig. Until we get a Commish who truly has the best interest of the game in mind, the game will not be treated with the respect it deserves & we the fans will continue to get dumped on.|`|p7ZgSPIDaa	He will get raped!|`|AA10495394	No disrespect to any of the older ball players but him using Performance drugs didn't make him a great player.

It is all Bud fault this happened in the first place.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	Nothing    Going to jail does not do anything to his records, many MLB players have been arrested and gone to jail, it does not affect the records.  Even the charge of perjury doesn't affect his records since that only determines whether he lied to the court, not whether he took steroids or anything else that would affect his play.  Even if he was convicted of taking steroids (unlikely since that's not a crime, but pretend it is), the court's decision has no effect on MLB's decision which is the only one that counts, for Bonds' records to be altered or erased, MLB would have to determine with or without the courts that Bonds did something that affected his play and that that action is serious enough to warrant a change in the record books.  Impossible, no; Improbable, definitely.|`|TJMpKqFNaa	The same thing that happened to McGwire's records and Sosa's records.  Nothing.    MLB doesn't have the cojones to remove those steroid/HGH tainted records from the books because in reality I think MLB has absolutely no idea exactly when large numbers of players started using steroids and HGH in baseball.      MLB wouldn't have a clue where to draw the line as to who cheated and who didn't, so I bet none of the records broken in the 90's up til now will be wiped off the books even if it's proven (again) that Bonds cheated.|`|v7TXEzYhaa	>>>>>>>>>>> * |`|l3ZUVqB7aa	I highly doubt his records are important to him right now as important as the possiblility of him going to jail|`|xS2tyVRiaa	Do you know that Chris "Maddog" Russo, a noted SF Giants fan actually said that he doesn't see much change in Bonds body from his Pirates years?|`|e4WhipTHaa	Although I think they should be removed from history I think it would take a lot of work for that to be done.  BUT every one in our era would tell their children and their grandchildren about that   25 on San Fran who cheated and there should be an asterisk next to every record of his.    And what is up with all   25's being cheaters??!! ha ha    Bonds-Check  McGwire-Check  Giambi-Check    Who is next :P ??|`|3SwJy3B7aa	hopefully he will be forgotten.

nKSmgjylaa	Yep, most of the time. Or I star it so more people will see it, then I go back to it later. (:    WQ : What, ever? That'd be way too tough. Currently it's probably either Jeff Hardy or Rey Mysterio. Both of them are used to heights and taking chances, and they know just how to fly through the air. They know how to land correctly too, which saves me from the "Ouch!" moment.     Just a little side note, I think Lita did some pretty damn amazing variations on suicide dives too. She waz trained in Mexico, and has to be, in my opinion, rated with the men when it comes to WWE's best highflyers.

AA12103453	Well you can feel that way, I can even understand that view. It is because no one wants to talk about the quiet ones who just live their life.

zzkmdusEaa	I think that evolution is true and that higher power exists somewhere out there, I even believe that the higher power created evolution. Those are the beliefs I was raised with and I think them perfectly rational, that higher power exists and the cycles of life including evolution was created by it.      I'm sure alot of frowning christians will give me a thumbs down for this remark. My beliefs were asked for and if you want to rank me down because I don't share your views, more power to you. Go ahead and be irrational and immature. The only reason I add this is because everytime I express the views when they are asked for, I get hateful and malicious comments sent to me with thumb down rankings to boot...All from Christians!|`|zpIKtqNvaa	If you are referring to evolution or creation (Moreover Christianity) then I would have to say Christianity.

No this is not a rick roll|`|xaSEuGBGaa	The only Evolution we wanna hear about is a group that consisted of three of the greatest wrestlers of all time, and Batista.     There is a religion section for these "questions", though I would hardly call it that as you are obviously just being an @$$ and are just trying to get a rise out of people and could care less for their opinions.    Thanks for the 2 points though.|`|KR64fnHjaa	Well you could believe in gods and monkeys.  they are not mutually exclusive.  If you are referring to the dunder-heading polarity of believing in god or evolution then I would go with evolution all day long.
VDRonTZVaa	the sooner they stop talking about him, the sooner we can completly forget about him. It does look like they have now proof with a urine sample that he used other forms of steroids....WILL IT EVER END!|`|zMvGnlMraa	Agreed.  I can't understand why congress ever got involved.  Its not like public officials were doping up.  These guys simply broke the rules of their company.  If I was accused of doping up where I work, the case wouldn't go to congress. Also, most likely whatever Bonds used wasn't illegal at the time he used it.  Baseball needs to make its own decisions and be its own police instead of congress jumping in.   I guess there's so many congressman they are just looking for stuff to do.  Maybe we should have half the congressman we currently have to help take a bite at the national debt.  All in all , the government is a big scam where everyone just tries to help themselves.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	Yes, I am very tired hearing it!

If they can't prove anything then he is a Hall of Fame player. If they prove he lied then he isn't it. Too me its exciting.|`|obPSaYf3aa	Drugs are bad.....  Steroids are bad.....  PED's are bad.....  Cholesterol is bad.....  Eating meat grilled over charcoal is bad.....  Eating saturated fats is bad.....    We harm ourselves every single day with the polluted air we breath, water we drink that may not be fully filtered or purified, eat foods that can kill us if we're not careful and drive motor vehicles that give highten the risk of killing each other on the roads.      What's the big deal with Barry Bonds, asthmatics, injured athletes, orthopedic patients and the 100's of other professional athletes that have taken steroids on a as needed, prescribed or recreational basis?  They are not junkies or drug fiends, nor are they addicted to those substances where they blow their entire multi-million dollar paychecks just on PED's alone!     So what if he told a "white lie" about not taking the "cream and clear"?  Those drugs are definitely traceable in bloodstreams all over the world and the media made these "miracle drugs" seem like they were undetectible.  Look what happened to BALCO.....  It's not for the fans to moan and groan about because it's their bloodstreams and not ours, not our wallets but theirs and surely not our health getting compromised by PED's!|`|3QELIOU7aa	I hope the jerk is convicted and spends some hard time in jail.

Also steroids WERE banned, the players union didn't recognize it. So that's two arguments you don't have.    Third, if it wasn't banned and it wasn't aproblem, why do all the players who did it lie and hide the fact they did it? Why don't they just say "it wasn't banned, it's not a problem, I did it."    Because it was banned, they obtained the drugs ILLEGALLY and did them ILLEGALLY, just as if they were doing coke or pot.     I, for one, hope they bury the bastard and I'm a lifelong Giants fan.    The only people who want this to stop are those who don't care that players cheated and did steroids illegally. To them (you) it's no problem. It's quite sad.
KdhNCnEjaa	Guy above me made no sense    And Eddie House deserves to be there, but will not make it unless Ray Allen declines the invitation to do it.

AA11109752	Yes I think he will and I think he should.  I live in America, and I must say that him leaving won't be the worst thing for MLS.  MLS should be focusing on developing and marketing the up-and-coming American players and the prominent Latin players so the Latino crowds can come out more often and boost attendances.      Back to the point:  Beckham wants to play in the 2010 World Cup.  Let him go to Milan so he can achieve his dream.  He can always come back to MLS after the World Cup; and the Galaxy can make some money off of his transfer fee.  It's a win-win for both parties.    thessg.blogspot.com|`|yQ6gJnJmaa	Looks like it.

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	Like all bullies who get beaten by a much smaller person, JBL is embarrassed.  He knows that WE know all about that incident.  6'6 300 pound "wrestling god" got knocked out by a 150 pound computer nerd.  That pretty much killed the "tough guy" persona JBL had.    I think he's keeping things low-keyed because he might be afraid that if he starts screaming and hollering and bullying people (even in storylines) the fans might start chanting "Joey!  Joey!  Joey!" and that would humiliate him.

KdcansIyaa	Yo SGOLDPER  to bad that is a terrible answer.    Seattle "was" a terrible team back in the day. And yes there division is bad right? Oh im sorry what team is in the superbowl right now? Seattle has the 2nd most playoff wins since 05. The only team with more is the patriots. So seattle backs it up against playoff teams all the time. Its a shame you even answered that question. That had one bad this past season because of injuries. Hasselbeck missed 9 games, mauris morris missed 4, 7 starting wr's out, the WHOLE offensive line was on Injured Reserve. Seattle has become a powerhouse. They are top 5 in NFC. Top 10 in nfl. And watch the nfc west is getting better and better every year.|`|qCWin81saa	yeah the seahawks r a decent team but nothing special , i do believe they r a better team than there 4-12 season suggest cos i put that bad season down to the fact hasselbeck missed most of it|`|zKpGxtrGaa	nope...exactly they didnt get good until they moved to the nfc west and of course the afc west isnt all that great now but the afc west use to be a powerhouse division n the seahawks couldnt handle it, in the nfc west they can actually have a shot at winning|`|AA12103453	No, they didn't really get "good" until they were put in the NFC West, which became a crap division and they were just the best of the worst.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i think they are in a rebuilding phase for the next two years|`|ZQWEgFZ2aa	The Seahawks are an average team overall, but some years they're either good or really good. For example the past few years they've been a solid team, they went to the super bowl not long ago. This past year though, they had their worst season ever going 4-12. Hope this helps!
KdcansIyaa	They were and went through a slump and now back on track. They have patrick willis i mean they are monsters on defense. With mike at head coach expect a hard division out of the nfc west.

5HBVo4Ujaa	I would like to believe this to be true but I honestly feel that the lions scared him away from the nfl plus deep down we all know OU beat the shorthorns last year anyhow. That was the most poorly officiated game I had ever seen.  That team is already the best ever; just think if Reynolds would have played all year!  OH and who go before Bradford in the draft; chokeford or strokford; whatever, would have loved to have seen that one.  Tebow better than Bradford; you fool he is lucky and benefited from a 32 day lay off. The gators are not the best team in the country; the luckiest team in the country I will buy. They hadn't any business beating the Sooners; lets see a home game it was just a FLUKE all together. I really wish the game could have been played on December 21st; OU would have hung 52 to 55 points; I would say 60 but the gators play pansy football...    If Reynolds played that 3rd down rate is probably 4 of 12 let alone the NFL stars that went pro early.. chomp chomp my  @$ @ $@    And a thumbs down to another idiot. Thank You dinger!    WE HAVE 7 OF THEM ALL TOGETHER! HA   I guess we have scoreboard regardless!    Statistics show that if a superior team plays an average team 10 times there is going to be a fluke in one of those games; it just happened to be January 8th. The Sooners and that includes the coaching staff made the gator d look like all-stars which they are not. Heck I didn't complain about the clutching and grabbing all game long by the gator secondary; OU put up with that all year long and still executed; also the 32 day lay off contributed 70% to the gators. Flukada got lucky that is all I am saying. They have no business with a trophy of that caliber.|`|LraV5gjqaa	Lol, that couldve had something to do with it.  I don't think being drafted by the lions was that much of a factor for him.  I think he wanted to benefit from at least one more year and just get that much better before entering the draft, and he might not've had a great game in the NC based on his season aveverages but those int's hit the hands of his recievers first.      Yeah I'm ready for october, gonna be a good one.    Lofton was the biggest loss imo too many injuries at the MLB position.  He was a man he was  40  lol|`|m4yyCDNCaa	I don't think Texas has much to do with it. He and his 'high powered' offense got embarrassed by Florida in the NC game and the nation saw that he was an average qb who ran around like a chicken with his head cut off when faced with pressure from a great defense. One that doesn't even compare to the defenses he'd have seen in the NFL. He knows he has room to improve and he's taking his remaining eligibility to do so. Besides, it wasn't consensus, Stafford would have been probably picked before him anyway. He chose what was best for his overall career and that was to get more experience not only to come back and beat Texas.|`|vyYhJ7PFaa	Big XII sucks. He should have left. I think he only did it because Tebow is better than him and he thinks he could beat Tebow. But OU isn't going to any NC game next year, forget about it!|`|2CuuIT70aa	Who's consensus?  I think Stafford would've been picked before him anyway.    I think he passed up possibly being a Lion and being the lowest of the low, for being BMOC and revered in Oklahoma.    And I disagree with your other points but I guess it doesn't matter, you'll never pick anyone who doesn't end their answer with BOOMER SOONER!!!!|`|pDwQgwvRaa	I agree with wdr31.  When all the rants were going around about who would win the game, I made the comment that Bradford has not been pressured by a defense where the defensive line and blitz schemes can get to the quarterback while the secondary is playing tight coverage.  Therefore, I picked Florida to win the game.  Of course, the Big 12 folks jumped on me with both feet citing all the glorious stats ran up by Oklahoma.  Well, when the dust settled Tebow outplayed Bradford and a lot of it should be credited to Florida's defense harassing Bradford.  As far as next year Florida is still the team to beat since they return their entire defensive starters.  They lost Harvin but their recruiting will fill that gap.  Certainly not as well but it will not be a tremendous loss.  Oklahoma has to rebuild the offensive line.  Will Oklahoma light up the Big 12?  Probably so but I doubt if they win it all.  So, Bradford's decision to return to Oklahoma was a solid one in that he needs to work on his throwing mechanics especially a quicker release and another year should help him.    Ah KC3 just another rant from a Big12 hot air bag.  The game is won and lost on the field of play.  OU lost and their high-powered offense didn't get the job done.  Perhaps the Big 12 should concentrate on defense a tad more to give their quarterbacks more experience when it comes to jumping to the next level.  OU has lost the last 5 bowl games 4 of which were BCS bowl games.  Also, USC and Utah would have kicked OU's azz because they have good defenses as well.  Well KC3 if you want to look at the crystal trophy for the last three years just come on down to SEC country and we'll be glad to show them to you.  LMAO!|`|gSgYDAEAaa	Why are you still talking smack? Last time you did that your team lost and you were to big of a wuss to even come on here.    Also that would be a very talented team but Stoops is still the coach and they would find a way to choke in the big games.|`|J3kfQtViaa	Unfortunately i cannot agree. My first thoughts on bradford staying was that it was decided after he saw Tebow staying.  I dont know if its true thats just how i see it.  Anyway i know the feeling you get when you lose at something, and it leaves a bad taste in your mouth, so my first thoughts were that he would like to have a go at florida again.     Certainly i will watch the texas ou game next year.  Or this year, lol.  I wasnt aware that he was the  1 draft pick though.    I agree that it is good to stay for your senior year.  And certainly better for the coach to graduate players.  I admit, i would have liked to see Stafford stay and graduate, but understandably the nfl needs him so i cant blame him for going.      I dont know that Manning was rich at the time, remember when archie manning was a quarterback, salaries were nowhere near what they are today.|`|c4945703897699a06e7537baffebe49caa	No, I think he did the smart thing, the title game showed he's not quite ready for the NFL.|`|2VGbJtnCaa	Can't blame him for not wanting to go the lions. Peyton Manning stayed in school one more year because he did not want to play for Bill Parcells and the New York Jets. I disagree with your P.S.  though! I think every team in the Big 12 is overrated!!
onvpwieHaa	Here are a few reasons why:    1. Chemistry issues    2. Davis and the clipper's coach also has had several clashes about the offensive and defensive systems that he runs.     3. Injuries|`|52oWf2xMaa	The most obvious reason is that he is not in terms with Coach Dunleavy in regards on how he rusn the team. With the warriors its run and gun while in LA he has to play in a more deliberate offense.     He must be so used with the fast break game in Golden State that he has a hard time adjusting plus maybe the departure of Brand may have affected hsi play since Elton was the one who recruited him.     Dont forget he is injured most of the time this year which can be bad for your stats, no surprise since he hasnt been in shape right now, like the time when he was out most of the time during 1 season with the warriors, when he lost weight he came back strong.|`|lJrlg5b8aa	He is playing for the Wrong LA team.|`|cnssh7v3aa	hes hurt i believe|`|KYBuotxPaa	What happened to BDiddy?

For example, pay for the reverse numbers (Example, Pit 3 Az 0 at end of first--less money would be paid for 0-3 as well).  I once ran a pool where squares cost $50 each, but I paid not only for the straight up quarter, but for reverse quarters and connecting squares (smaller amount for squares touching the straight up square).  But, just make sure the math is good, and make sure that by far the most money gets paid for the straight up quarter.  I almost had to run 2 pools for $50 per square because the interest was very high.  And, I ended up paying a lot more people than simply 4, and overall more people had fun.  But, you have time, so good luck!
HEg82RVzaa	All great answers here, but what will be important to your friend is what you feel about martial arts.  What has it done for you?  You are friends so I imagine you have common interest and respect for one another? He is more likely to see all the attributes it offers if you are truly into the discipline.  You can preach and preach and preach, but the best testament is the impact it has had on you thus far.    In my own experience we are a certain breed and not all can dedicate themselves or even want to be disciplined enough to even try.  Good luck hope he at least tries!|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Martial arts are not for anybody but you. An art is a tool for you to use to search inside of yourself for what your own capabilities are.  I can say they give you confidence by far, along with that confidence comes self control and patience (just knowing i can drop a guy who is getting violent towards me is enough for me).  Self defense is not martial arts, in martial arts you automatically are able to defend yourself and more if necessary.  It's not something you compare to, it's a choice of lifestyle that only you can make. What you put into it is what you get out.|`|JpJnhkmDaa	Defend yourself  Boost your self esteem and confidence  Get you in shape   Create a lean body  Gain flexiblity  Make new friends  Release stress  Get a taste of acheivemnt as you upgrade belts  etc  etc|`|ldGz9UoBaa	1 you have more control over your life meaning less people can control you.  2 you will get in shape  3 its fun to fight   4 never fear other people   etc|`|BjS8k8Cyaa	If builds self confidence  You stay fit and healthy  You learn good self defense  It is fun!    tell him that if one day some dude comes up to him on the street and trys to take his money and phone, whats he gonna do?

Though it needs to be considered as to the purpose of starting martial art training in the first place!  First and foremost people generally take up martial arts so they can fight. In my experience, if this is the only reason then most people leave after a short period when they realise its not like the movies.   It can be a very social thing as I have met some great friends over the years I have been training.  As to the previous comments, never assume martial arts can always solve your problems when confronted with danger. Any experienced martial artist will tell you that fighting is an ABSOLUTE last resort. You can never tell if your attacker is hiding a knife or has a dozen mates around the corner! It gives you better odds but does not by any means make you invincible.|`|N5SVU6Xwaa	if you like it then its fun, and theres fitness and being able to defend yourself and stuff and try to avoid the mcdojos|`|hefL0heAaa	If you are in martial arts with a friend, tell him or her what you think is good about the arts. I did have a friend like you. He wanted to withdraw martial arts at the first day in class. One day, he saw me fighting with my brother and i didn't know what he was thinking. After that day he changed his mind.

You're dreaming right? Brock Lesnar is the Ultimate Fighting Championship World Heavyweight Champion. Lesnar will be headlining UFC Bouts at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, the MGM Grand in Las Vegas and other places. Brock Lesnar is on ESPN and other channels, why would he return to Professional Wrestling. Brock Lesnar has no interest in being on the road and wrestlng 4-5 days a week. Lesnar enjoyes working out, training and fighting every few months, which is what he does in the Ultimate Fighting Championship. He gets to spend more time with his wife and has a baby on the way. Brock Lesnar is not returning to Professional Wrestling, you're dreaming. The Dream Match I'm waiting for is Brock Lesnar vs. bobby Lashley.

A smoothie with a mix of fruits and yogurt can help give you enough energy to make it through a long day.     *Burn peppermint oil in an oil burner or place a few drops on your wrist. Inhaling this scent will stimulate your body and make you feel more energized.     *Step outside for a few minutes. Giving yourself a break for a few minutes can do wonders for your energy level, especially on a warm and sunny day.    *Use acupressure techniques. Pinching the point between your thumb and forefinger for several minutes can help give you extra energy.     *Practice deep breathing. Taking deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth allows you to feel energized because of the quick boost in oxygen. Keep your body relaxed as you breathe.

6sYXUc1caa	scottie pippen, steve nash and lebron james overrated.  kevin machale underrated (at leasted in the NBA) he had a great shot|`|UaSFuT59aa	This question always gets some ridiculous answers. How could Scottie Pippen be overrated? He receives all the accolades he should because people recognize that he would've been even more dominant if not sharing a ball with MJ. Some people think he was ONLY successful cuz of MJ, but look at the 1994-1995 season when MJ retired. Pippen was an MVP candidate, AS game MVP and only lost to Shaq's Magic team that went to the Finals.     Anyway, most overrated player of all-time is Allen Iverson. In other posts, I've listed all his discrepancies, so I'll keep it brief. His scoring prowess is based solely on his lack of a second option throughout his career and his massive number of shot attempts (only 42% shooter for his career). If ill-advised shots were an official stat, he'd be the all-time leader. For being a "leader", he hasn't won a playoff series in about 7-8 years.     Most underrated is tough. When guys are considered underrated for too long, they eventually get recognition for being underrated and become overrated like David West in my opinion. I think a guy that doesn't get enough recognition for his career is Larry Nance. He was a career 17 ppg and 8 rpg over 13 years. Made it to the playoffs 8 times with good Suns and Cavs teams and averaged 16 and 8. Most people remember him as the guy that dunked two balls in the dunk contest, but he was a very solid PF, 3 time all-star and 3-time all defensive team. When I first saw Shawn Marion, I thought of Larry Nance. The younger generation may not remember his career and that's a shame.|`|KYBuotxPaa	overrated-Dwyane Wade  underrated- Chris Webber|`|EsnFmcMFaa	most overrated: Lebron James, chauncey billups, rip hamilton, rasheed wallace    most underrated: antwan jamison, caron butler, joe johnson, nickyoung|`|NHAKOXyXaa	Overrated - Andrew Bynum, he's a good basketball player but i don't think he;s worth 16m, he's too slow.

Underrated- Al Horford, John Starks|`|ofC4JQIhaa	If you're in the NBA, you're an amazing player. Plain and simple. With only 15 guys tops on a roster, that is definitely true.    But some players are just not what I would call "winning" basketball players in that they have flaws in their games that don't allow them to help the team cause as much as their talent level suggest t hey should. And here they are:    Carmelo Anthony, Denver Nuggets-    This might be the most shocking inclusion on this list, but I have thought he was overrated from the minute he stepped on the court in the NBA. Why, you ask? Let me count the reasons.    1. He's a selfish player with an attitude problem. Even though he's matured somewhat, his run-ins with coaches are well-documented.  2. He is hailed as a superstar on the level of LeBron James yet he hasn't made an All-Star team still.  3. His defense is sub-par at best. Just plant your eyeballs on him for 10 possessions or so on defense and you'll immediately see what I'm talking about.    Anthony is a very good player but he also is more of a sidekick than a go-to guy in my opinion because on offense, he lacks a go-to move that he can score reliably in the clutch. There, I've made my case. Apologies to the legions of Melo tee-wearing fans but that's just how I feel.    Zach Randolph, New York Knicks-    Low-post scorers are a true rarity in today's NBA, and Randolph is a good one. But he's also a bad defender, so bad, in fact, that he only averages a pitiful .2 blocks per game while playing center and power forward, a number that is almost unheard of. When he's in the game, other teams feel like they can attack the basket at will, and that spells trouble.    Vince Carter, New Jersey Nets-    25.2 points per game and enough highlights to last ten seasons are nice, but what else does Vince really give to a team these days? He takes way too many ill-advised jump shots even though he could be an absolute force if he took the ball to the hoop more often, and he doesn't provide much defense or consistency.  Trying to determine what qualifies a player as underrated in the NBA can be pretty tricky business. Like the awarding of the M.V.P. trophy, you wont find any shortage of opinions on what basis the player should be judged upon.  Efficiency and statistical ratings have now become en vogue. Some consider how much the player makes as a tool to estimate ones value. Or perhaps the teams location comes into play, because you wont find too many athletes in New York or Los Angeles on these lists.  With no clear cut answer, I decided to try and simplify things, breaking everything down to one statement: Who doesnt get enough credit for their play?  Thats simple enough. Whether theyre a scrub or superstar, making the league minimum or maximum, the criteria will be the same.  I will exclude sophomores players as one year isnt enough time to establish a proven track record (I will call this the Andrea Bargnani rule). Also keep in mind this isnt a list of players the casual fan has never heard of. If you still dont know how good the David Wests and Shawn Marions of this league are, then I suggest an NBA League Pass subscription may be in order.  So, without further adieu, here are your candidates heading into the 08-09 season:  Maurice Williams  The newest member of the Cleveland Cavaliers, Williams comes in with the pressure of being looked upon as the missing link on a team in the mix to win an NBA championship this season. Being buried in the basketball wasteland that is Milwaukee the last few years, Williams has quietly established himself as one the top scoring point guards in the NBA. Possessing a smooth jumper and the ability to attack the rim at any time, he has no problem creating plays for himself or others. Along with being the fourth ranked scoring point guard in the league at 17.3 points per game, Williams has also shown an impressive all-around game. Averaging over six assists and close to four boards a game, this silky smooth guard is just as comfortable running the offence as he is playing off the ball.  Danny Granger  Also known as the guy we passed on for Joey Graham to Raptors fans, Granger has shown steady improvement over his first three years in the league. Although overshadowed by some of the big names at the small forward position, make no mistake, this guy can flat out play. The New Mexico State alum is an athletic wingman who does a little bit of everything. Deadly at the free throw line, improving from beyond the arc, and an efficient 45% career shooter from the field, makes the former first rounder, a nightmare to defend. Add in his solid rebounding and defence, and youve got yourself one of the top young forwards in the game. A solid 2007 season saw Granger average over 19 points per game, tying him with Paul Pierce for eleventh highest in the Eastern Conference. With Indiana rebuilding and starting to return to respectability, look for Granger to have a breakout year and take his game to an All-Star le|`|XT8eNPhVaa	Youre calling Steve Nash over rated??!?!?!

Austin was huge because he was likable, but he drank beer, beat up other good guys, flipped people off and had the whole sacrilege of the 3:16 thing. Another thing is that a few years ago, they allowed the superstars to improvise some. That's why the Rock was so good. He came up with most of his own promos and was hilarious. Cena's promos are completely scripted word for word so it comes across phony. He was much more likable when he got to do his own raps when he insulted his opponents. Since he came from SD to RAW, they stopped him from rapping and turned him into sort of a Superman hero. Kids love Superman, but older teens and young adults think he's a cornball. Same thing with Cena.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	I'm a huge fan too (hence the screen name) but I have a reason people don't like him: Jealousy!     They're haters, and why do people hate? Because they want it for themselves.  If they didn't care, they wouldn't take the time and worry about what the fans even think.|`|lTlaNwtgaa	he is a has been|`|zb40cLwOaa	Cena is overpushed, overexposed, but most of all, he's over with the fans. Most arenas have about 50 % cena lovers and 50% cena haters, but the main thing is the fans care about him.     Why do people actually hate John Cena? They're sick of seeing the same guy being the focal point of the company. I don't really mind it as long as I still get to watch guys like Jericho and HBK..and Cena isn't a bad wrestler and he has a lot of charisma but he just doesn't do enough to entertain the old school fans.|`|WCX6kYITaa	Nobody really hates him. To enjoy WWE, you've gotta become absorbed in the storyline. Otherwise, if you say, "It's only a script", the whole point is lost. Sometimes we hate the way the show is scripted, and sometimes we complain about real life stuff (eg. HHH is being pushed because he's married to Steph) but we still usually surrender to all the drama. As for Cena haters, well people love to hate him rather than actually hate him. Some of his haters love other faces (such as HHH, Jeff Hardy, Batista or HBK). But some of us are fans of the heels. At this time, heels dominate the WWE (Edge is WWE champion ; Orton is Royal Rumble winner, Swagger is ECW champion, Shelton is United States champion, Maryse is Divas champion, etc).|`|8Im1iGFTaa	what wrasslin turkey said|`|hDB84Etyaa	Cant wrestle, does the same moves over and over again!, um, a wigger, and thinks hes the hottest thing around, when in people's minds hes similar to vanilla ice.|`|cjknXzm9aa	we hate john cena because we had to him forced down our collective throats for over a year. he kept winning impossible matches against wrestlers better than him. we were happy with cena for a while, but his win against triple h and hbk never should have happened. him beating great khali never should have happened, the only reason he's the champ is becuase he's marketable to wwe's key demographic. his moves are limited and he's sloppy in the ring. he;s admitted himself, i;m young in the business, but since he has the bulky physique that vince likes, the gets the belt. this is why we hate.|`|8t1Osybyaa	why do some people hate WWE superstar Randy Orton|`|qbEeecndaa	John Cena makes WWE what it is today, He has the most passion for what he does than anyone else out there. Thats why he is where he is, plus he is great on the mic.|`|gUqTlLROaa	people are crazy|`|ikyij2g3aa	Im not a hater and not a fan but it would be that people hate him because he is winning the title a lot and I think he should be a heel and change his gimmick which might also be the cause. If he becomes that heel rapper again I bet people will boo him but also cheer for him...like the way they did before. If he keeps doing that for 2 years people will be cheering like made. Also a new move will help too.|`|BMDPdkdraa	he need a new gimmick because he "super god hero" gimmick is for 4-10 years old kids (and girl at any age) and also he need a new finisher|`|7QE1nPgQaa	Cena is the real Captain Charisma, hes what, 31 and still in his prime, he love the WWE and Vince loves that about him along with his persona and in-ring and mic abilities, fans however don't really like seeing the same guy over and over again, I personally think he's talented, he's just on everything you see, WWE Movies, Magazines, Newspapers, Commercials, billboards, hes like city tv............everywhere, His FU is overused and his STFU is an STF, and he hasn't been a heel since like john cena and B-4 days at the start of his career,    I remember john with rey and edge vs kurt, eddie and chris, boy have things changed since then, edge is a champ, john is a champ and a wigger, or he's a marine now, probably gonna be a cop now after his next movie and go after cryme tyme, who knows|`|N9to7r3Raa	I am a Cena fan, but I also can understand why people don't like him. The people don't like him because he does win a lot of matches. Now as a Cena fan, I'm okay with that, but as for the others, they things they mainly say is: He only has five moves, or he wins too much, or his character sucks. They don't understand that all of that is just in the WWE. Like anyone, Cena is a normal person, just like every other athlete.|`|Lv89kHKpaa	Cause they are blind.  CENA RULES|`|G59jP4FJaa	He needs to grow up and get a new gimmick. Fart and pee jokes are not funny in promos.|`|fJhVPz3Haa	HE NEEDS MORE MOVES AND HE IS TO COCKY SOMETIMES AND IS A HAS BEEN

Mi3rHjcYaa	I'm a Jets fan, but never been to an NFL draft. lol I'm not gonna buy a plane ticket from LA to NY just to watch some Draft I can see at home.    Btw 60% of the fans there are Jets fans.      edit: Yes the crowd does hear what ESPN announcers are saying. Because I remember 2 years ago when Herman Edwards (former Jets coach) was being interviewed on ESPN, the whole Jets crowd starting booing because they hate Edwards. So yes, I think the Crowd does get to listen to the NFL analyist and Mel Kiper, Chris Berman, etc.|`|5673ef8ed5e8008f074e69bcf4c7d2b9aa	I just remember Giants fans that cheer for whoever they draft and Jets fans that boo at whoever they draft.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	It is a convention of couch potatoes.

A lot of Jets fans, Dolphins fans, and a lot of Eagles fans.    Re: You cannot hear what ESPN or NFL Network are saying. You basically wait for each pick to be announced.

Yea you get to see the future stars and some coaches in person and might have a chance to meet them, but all you would do is just sit on uncomfortable chairs for hours and hear all the Jet fans screaming on the top of their lungs saying J-E-T-S JETS JETS JETS. It gets pretty annoying hearing it on the TV let alone being their righ next to them. I would rather be home on my couch with snacks and beer and just be a lazy piece of shiit for the weekend and enjoy the draft. Although going to the Draft sounds like shiit, it is still something i want to do at least once in my lifetime.

g9oKDTZtaa	Reverse cowgirl|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Missionary|`|4W8fHj5Gaa	If you're a fast player I would say forward and if you are slower than the others I would say defense. I played forward goalie and defense so I know what is important for each of those positions. If you want to be a forward make sure you exercise your legs a lot with running, biking, and skating to become as fast as possible, because that extra speed is a huge asset and you can actually help the defense on a 2v1 and other situations if you're fast enough. (I was the top forward in my league in goals and near the top in assists when I played).|`|9GzkVwfGaa	goalie|`|RQfnPOPXaa	choose the position you like playing the most.  im partial to goalies XD. but i think playing forward would be a lot a fun for you, you can pass the puck and create plays but also score and things like that. whatever you choose, i'm sure you'll have a great time playing =)|`|iw3v5bgIaa	Singh,    I play goalie, and always look for play maker that can skate well in a defenseman, boy or girl.     Keep in mind you'll need to take one for the team once in a while by blocking shots. If you have good agility on your skates and have a good shot from the point, I say defense.    As forwards usually get the glory in todays game (Crosby, Ovechkin), speed and playmaking are paramount.    To be the best player regardless of position, keep track of your plus/minus ratings (how many goals are scored when you are on the ice vs. goals scored against) and you can gauge if you are benefiting the team in the position you currently have.    Try changing positions and see if your ratings go up!!!    It is a team sport after all, and all the goals you score don't mean a thing if you're giving up more.    Regardless of position, click on the link below to find equipment deals, discounts, closeouts and new lines:    http://www.squidoo.com/sports-hockey-equ...|`|HNEWf7ILaa	I would say forward, specifically center, because then you could kind of play both.

I hate seeing new players pigeonholed into one position.  My son spent years on D but in high school plays forward.  However, since our goalie has been injured the coach is double shifting him on F then on D to make up for a weaker 4th d-man.  Being diverse helps you get more playing time and you will eventually come to realize where you fit best.|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	you sound like a back-checking center. Centers are forwards that are a 3rd defenseman. You can break up the ice and score, pass it off to a wing or even go in the corners in your zone to clear it out. And if your bad at taking face-offs then just have a linemate take them if they are better, but i would suggest that you become good at face-offs.|`|0qNbEif3aa	If you have size and strength, like the defensive side of the play, and don't mind not scoring points, defense can be one of the funnest positions.     If not, I'd say center (if you're quick on the faceoff) and work on your playmaking and passing abilities.|`|PbIS2MDraa	Just play in the position in which you have the more fun to play.    If your happy and you have fun, you will be even better.|`|fe420cf41ead9560ba0cb8531d43ebadaa	Play where you are most comfortable. If you can score being a forward then there is no reason why you can't score playing defense too.|`|hrd8lv8kaa	Well you have three choices!!!!      1- Well if you are good at slapshot then defense, and if you are bigger person then defense.      2- I would reccomend this, you sound like a forward. You make more offensive plays and you sound good at offensive checking.      3- YOU COULD JUST PLAY CENTER!!!! Best of both worlds!!!! LOL    I vote forward becuase you sound like an offensive player to me.But hey just play center and your problems are gone!! hahah|`|kHzfPQbjaa	i say defense especally because you have a good eye on when to clear the puck and also setup your teamates. if you think that you could play center for example you would have to play an offensive and defensive role as well.

oHJ0ZEFqaa	Wallace was just injured and he is out indefinitely. Before being hospitalized I would say this is definitely a good trade.

mnGOsAVVaa	First off, remember that you are playing recreational volleyball.  If you are looking for a more competitive level of play, or looking to play with more consistent players in a truly "team" environment, look into joining a league that fits that criteria.    Even in leagues where players are more experienced, there are always times when good players don't get set.  BE VOCAL.  Call for the ball.  Let them know in the middle of the play that you're there ready to hit.  Telling them before or after the play usually doesn't work, because in the heat of a rally, they will most likely only remember that their friend is there.    Also try establishing a setter.  Let them know that one person will transition and set all the way around.  This will mean there will be times that some of the "favorites" are out of hitting positions.    Another suggestion would be to hit the ball on the second contact and skip the setter all together.  If the ball gets high enough and you are positioned correctly, hit the ball on the second contact.  This is a great offensive move and it also forgoes the selfish setter/hitter combos.    Remember, sand volleyball is conventionally a 2-man sport--and occasionally a four-man sport.  Six players is unconventional at best, so don't expect a great level of consistency.    Happy playing.|`|KrkftOfkaa	Outside the other suggestions you can try and split up the "clickish" people in the rotation.  Say you "don't want all your height grouped in one spot" so that you have a better offensive and defensive mix.  It will force them to set a 10-ball to get their buds or go for a more conventional set to a front line hitter.  Assuming your are running a 3-2-1 at this play level and not a 6-2, a 5-1, or (god forbid) a total free-for-all.|`|085ceb5bb7c326a63e32a1f2eb169f02aa	southern... has some great advice.  Yelling outside or middle while the ball is on the way to the setter should help.  The other is patience.  I used to play with a very "cliquish" group.  I would go weeks without getting a set.  Finally, the other two front row players dove for the first ball and one of them passed it directly to the setter.  His only choice standing was me.  I saw the pained look on his face as he "had" to set me.  I blasted the ball for a winner.  Suddenly, I was part of the group and got some more sets.  Not as many as the others, but it was more than 1 every 2 week.|`|AA10264508	Why couldn't you join the team on the other side of the net?    Going to rec-game is like going to a party with free drawing at the door, you don't always get what you wanted, but you have a find a way to have fun.  To me, playing pickup/recreational volleyball is a way to make new friends. If you play two three times a week, you should be able to find some "nice" players who like to have you on their team and involve you with more touches.    You may talk to those "nice" players and see whether any of them is also playing more competitive games, and maybe you can join one of those league teams. Being a girl would give you some advantage in the co-ed or reverse co-ed league, no matter how good you are on the court.    Even when you are out-numbered, you can still move your feet and get some digs and blocks. When you hassle for more saves, you could earn more respect.    Just make this your first step into your local volleyball community, take your time to make new friends, and I am sure you will have fun down the road.|`|KgbausOCaa	call for your ball  yell your throat out|`|qRA0rA5Taa	first u can either yell super super loud and maybe they will set u........or....u could join a club or a school team 4 better vball  u dont need them :)      hope i helped!!
onvpwieHaa	Both players are about evenly talented.     Iggy has the better offensive game which is more suited for being a second option. While Smith lacks a consistent jumper, but exceeds at attacking the rim. Both are comparable man to man defenders with Iggy probably having a slight advantage, but Smith is by far the better help defender.     I would probably go with Iggy, but by the slightest of margins.|`|25ymUKdraa	ill go with josh smith.. smoooootttthhh!!! josh has better shooting touch than andre igoudala|`|nynlxGmNaa	josh smith|`|XT8eNPhVaa	Im gonna go with Iggy because he has an outside game to go with his slashing ability, but Jsmoove is better on D.|`|8hIs3dHsaa	Josh Smith.|`|52oWf2xMaa	Both players are equally talented, young and atheltic but each of them has their own pedigree.    Josh is a better defensive player since he can block shots and gets steals. Andre can also get steals but cant block like Josh but he is better offensively and that he can pass the ball when needed but averages more turnovers.    I would pick Josh because I think he performs better during the Playoffs compared to Andre where he faded against the Pistons, yes Detriot's defense was tought but he could have done better.|`|AA10896470	JSmoove!!!|`|NmXKPDoIaa	Josh Smith: He can play SF or PF, can score, rebound, pass, defend, he can do it all.     Neither player are ready to be the "man". However, Josh Smith is the better complimentary star player, he would make a great second option on any team, and can be effective with out scoring the ball.

Imagine if he was a starter.|`|UaSFuT59aa	I'm very happy to see a question about a kid on a small market team, especially Ramon Sessions. I've been telling my boys about this kid since he was in college. What he did last year went relatively unnoticed even until now. He was a 2nd round pick that the Bucks gave burn the last 15 games or so of the year and he put up about 8 ppg and 8 apg. He had a couple of monster games in the range of 20 and 15 assists or something along those lines. For a rookie 2nd round pick getting his first action, that was highly impressive. Last season I told my boys the Bucks would trade Mo Williams to make room for him. Then they did, but they took back Ridnour and benched Sessions. With his minutes being up and down, his play did the same, but now he's starting for Redd and he's been impressive. I can only hope he gets traded to a team where he can start or they bench Ridnour and give this kid the reigns. He could be a star. Needs to work on his shot though.      EDIT: I'm from NY and the rule is that we can say whatever the hell we want. Who cares what slang the man uses?

Oes7TRNVaa	Its very overrated but like u said it only proves they can play 20 years plus. I think the all time leading scorer really should be by how many points u score per game in a career. Jordan has that record and i think its a bigger deal|`|wp6qFB9Qaa	that's history man, being #1 at any categories in sports all time should be getting respect and everything. I mean how many players r there or was there? thousands! but having more points that all of them? It's not overhyped or overrated, it's respecting the player and his accomplishment...|`|WUzgGtAAaa	Its about consistancy and longevity. Kareem and Malone each played for 20 years or so. They put up big numbers consistantly. Records are records, but I agree that it isn't everything in determining greatness.|`|QrSFskUpaa	The more you have something, the more powerful you feel. I guess it is about being proud to have something more that others.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Man, would you stop down-playing Kobe's accomplishments. Sure, it doesn't mean you are a better scorer.. but just the fact that your in the top 20 of All Time. Means, you have been a great player throughout your carrer.<br>  <br>  I bet you if Wade was on the top 20 list you would be praising him saying how great of a scorer he is. And don't even say you wouldn't because you would.<br>  <br>  Anyways, that's my two cents.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: He didn't mention Kobe, but I know he was referring to him. It's obvious.|`|fAMpj8s2aa	yeah i see what you're saying. it also says that you were good enough as you aged to compete at that level though, so i'd say it means something, just not as much as everyone makes it out to be. like cal ripkins record is really just showing up to a game, nothing to do with being good, but i respect the crap out of his streak.|`|Qyk0Rdu5aa	Mamba, I agree with you, but no one mentioned kobe or D wade...but you are right they are top 20....but don't take everything offensive toward kobe bryant. I love kobe bryant also but he isn't even mentioning kobe. All that really mattters is the average points you have your total career.|`|ur1bnkrZaa	its pretty much being able to stay consistent. <br>  witch is always good|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	I don't...|`|kYBlgFQAaa	It's not the best indicator of greatness.  Not that Kareem wasn't great, but it's more of a testament to longevity and consistency.  <br>  <br>  As a comparison, Joe Montana is #10 on the list for the NFL career passing yards, while Fran Tarkenton is #5.  Obviously, stats don't always tell the enitre story.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I agree with you here.  When looking at the stats, "per game" totals over a career will usually tell you who was better at a certain stat.  The reason I say "usually" is because in some cases eras make a difference, ie Wilt's 22.9 rebounds per game and Russel at 22.5, is more due to their height in an era of smaller players, than them being truly the greatest rebounders ever.<br>  <br>  As for anyone bringing Kobe into this, he ranks 24th in total points and 9th in ppg.  If anything, this arguement helps Kobe, its not bashing him.
a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	I sign Mike Richards. The cap hit is 'slightly' less but his 'prime years' (ages 27-31) will be in the last half of the contract, while in Zetterberg's case, the prime years will come first.    Secondly, Richards will be 30 when the last 3rd of his contract starts which is still a very tradeable age. Zetterberg will be 36, not a very tradeable age, increasing the risk that a buy out may be necessary.        I do want to add that I believe that Jimmy Devallano and Ken Holland are very smart men, and that without having seen the actual breakdown this contract should be heavily weighted to the now, so that when it comes time to buy him out at 36 if the case may be, they are doing so for less than $6MM a season and the cap hit going forward (based on the payout, not the cap hit) will be smaller. I hope.    Since the contract was signed before Zetterberg's 35th birthday, the cheaper buy out clause remains if you buy him out late in his career (players signing contracts after their 35th birthday leave the team on the hook for the whole cap hit, even after being bought out - unless LITR)    The other thing to look at is upside. Both players are currently at a point/game pace. Was last year a fluke year for Zetterberg? Or is this a bad year for him? He's 28, already into his prime, and history shows very few players have their best seasons in their 30s. Richards is a few days shy of 24, he's still a few years away from his prime (historically speaking). Is he always going to be the point a game guy he's been for the last 2 years? Or is there more in the tank.    Zetterberg is a better skater, and better defensively, while Richards has more of a Bobby Clarke/Doug Gilmour mentality. Zetterberg plays in towards the net more than Richards does. Both players have exactly 20% of their goals as game winners (this was the uncanny thing). Zetterberg is the better face-off man (54% to 50%) but Richards is more likely to win a face-off in his own zone (58% to 47%). Richards has scored more shorthanded goals (16), than Zetterberg has shorthanded points (10) in 60% of the games played. Richards is more likely to hit (87 to 36), and is more likely to play the puck (42 take aways to 24 takeaways). Both players give the puck away more than they take it, and have the same ratio of 1.3 giveaways per takeaway.    Even if this is a down year for Zetterberg, I'm still taking Richards long term. I believe that over the next 12 years, he outscores Zetterberg overall, even if Zetterberg outscores him over the next 2-3 years.    LITY       Note: I am completely aware that I called Zetterberg better defensively while comparing Richards to two former Selke winners - deal with it!        Bob - Last I looked both Clarke and Gilmour were still playing at age 34 - so it's a good thing.    I stand corrected on the cap hit at the end too    The buyout hit would be 2/3 of the cap hit spread out over double the years remaning.    So, 2 years left at 6MM, the new cap hit would be 2MM a year for 4 years    12MM * 2/3 = 8MM, spread out over 2*2 years (4 years) = 2MM a year.    This would still be the case if the last 2 years of the deal paid him $1MM a year (the actual buyout is what is remaining on the contract)|`|lYnkvRASaa	Given the age difference I go with Richards.    He is still improving and should get better, Zetterberg is in his prime now.  I assume the Zetterberg one will be front loaded as well.  I'm not sure how that affects a potential buyout at the end.  Is it the buyout amount that affects the cap or the remaining cap hit.  If it is the buyout amount then with a low back end the buyout will not hurt the cap much on the back end.    I like the Richards deal, the Zetterberg one scares me some.  Even with the younger guys someone is soon going to get burnt on one of these 10 yr plus deals when the player does not meet expectations.  What can you do with a guy not performing who has 8 years left on a contract?    With the age difference Richards is the easy answer, if they were both 28 then I'd say both GM's made a mistake.    Vinny's contract could come back to bite someone too in the future.  Hopefully not my Habs    Edit: That's what I thought, if the buyout cap hit was only 2/3 of the remining $$ and not 2/3 of actual hit then these front loaded LT deals would make more sense from the team perspective.  I guess they do make the guy more tradeable to a team with cap space at the end.    Either way LTIR may be the best way out of some of these deals for the rich teams.  forget 40 year olds- how many effective 38 year olds are there in the league this year. Not many.    Edit:  I seem to remember reading that you can only get insurance for the first 7 or 8 years of a deal.      I do agree the Longterm deal costs less so money is saved and cap space, but in exchange the team assumes more risk.  Risk of injury can be mitigated with insurance but the risk of non-performance is the big one.  You have to live with that deal for a long time.    To use a Flyers example as a rookie Renberg scored 38 goals and was a point a game guy.....10 yrs later he is struggling to score 12 with the Leafs.  in Hindsight he would have been a poor signing to a LT deal.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Signing anyone for that long just seems like a bad idea.  I suppose the player likes it.    I didn't realise that they did years x total value for cap purposes.    As a self-described non expert, I have to wonder how these deals will look in, say 5 years (all these silly 10+ year deals).  With that being said, Ken Holland has always seemed a smart customer, so you do have to wonder.    Offhand, I'd say Richards' deal.  Younger, and one less year to go on it.|`|g9oKDTZtaa	Richards big time. Usually Holland is smarter than this. STUPID DEAL. A 28 year old for 12 years? Are you kidding me? This is the type of deal that will put Detroit back in the Dead Wing era before long.|`|Lu7qMDpAaa	I'd rather go with richards, i don't think zetterberg deserves it, he hasn't really done anything to warrant such a large contract, in fact if i remember correctly the game before the allstar break he ended the game on a -4 against pheonix lol....|`|jwPf5rsiaa	Richards. I like him as a player first of all. Secondly..he's 6 years younger and will only be half way thru his contract and only 28 but the time Zetts is halfway thru his and 34. More legs left in Richards at 28.      Glass half full sorta reasoning.|`|3ULjjUNlaa	I'll take Zetterberg.  Biased? Yeah.  But I KNOW he can mesh well with Datsyuk and they make each other a better player.  No offense to Richards, but I would rather keep Zetterberg because he can make you look stupid, expressed interest in staying a Red Wing his whole career while Richards might request a trade.  No disrespect to Richards, I think he will have a great career, but I'd rather have Hank.|`|rv6zl5t3aa	I'd go with Richards if I had to. Just because he's younger and maybe a little more scrappy than Z.    If I was a GM though I wouldn't be signing players to long term deals. There is just to much that can go wrong. Just look at DP on the Ilses. You just never know when an injury can take you out for a career and your left holding an empty bag.|`|HJuOSvmdaa	If I were unbiased and completely basing this on points...Richards.  But Zetterberg is the future captain in Detroit, and he loves his team.  He will be an old captian like Yzerman, and Lidstrom (both great players, even when they were older).  Even if Zetterberg is only making 60 points a year when he is 34, he will still be a great leader and once Hossa is gone he'll have more points than he did this year cause he'll play with Datsyuk more.  And I think Datsyuk has 6 years left on his contract...|`|1ApbWVhsaa	I love Mikey...Captain at 22 years old..Stands up for his players.Plays on both the PP and PK..Great eyes on the ice..Zata is a great player as well but very injury prone.Richie also has a +16 and leads the team in assists    Wonder how Zetterbergs' back will do after he reaches the midway of his contract?    I take Richie...Probably some homer in me as well.
jSkHquK5aa	INTER vs. MAN U|`|9H5wDRrRaa	great game im looking forward to the return leg|`|i1s9Vovuaa	Well, it was a good game but not purely classic as we hoped for.It was not that electrifying. Both teams were having a rather defensive policy. In my opinion the game between Inter Milan and Man United was best off all. It was splendid. The moves, the shots, the accuracy, goal attempts and overall tempo was just superb. thogh there was no goal but it had many breathtaking moments.Lets give credit to inter's Goalkeeper.He made it classical.

Matt and Jeff staged their whole fued for Matt to turn heel. But it's part of an elaborate plan for Matt to infiltrate Vickie's la Familia. Matt eventually sleeps with Vickie (getting back at Edge for Lita i.e the storyline; not the real Lita thing). But Jeff also has a stake in it. He wants to break Edge from Vickie and end their nepotistic "ownership" of Smackdown. I'll throw Chavo in the mix too. I'll have Chavo [and maybe even Big Show]working with the Hardy's to bring down Edge and Vickie. I know it's not specifically a Jeff storyline, but he'll be the crucial figure in it. Maybe at the end of it, he'll turn heel!|`|DVGYYKlpaa	ok first off i would put him in ecw with matt hardy rey mysterio kofi londrick aj styles and r-truth. i would make ecw an all the time extreme rules thing like the old days. then their will be a battle royal to determine the ecw hardcore champion and what happens is the ecw originals are in it too then what happenes is jeff hardy turns heel and joins the originals who said that the high flyers dont kno what "extreme" is by attacking kofi kingston during a tag match tlc match for the ecw hardcore tag team belts and make sabu and rvd the champs. he in the beggining gets love from the ecw originals until he goes on a losing streak. at the royal rumble ecw has their own ecw royal rumble with all superstars from all brands but it is extreme rules and what happens is it is a team royal rumble and jeff at the end when it is all the ecw high flyers in the ring with only 2 ecw originals or so we thought. Jeff hardy rips his ecw originals shirt and under it read ecw high flyers revealing that he was actually an ecw high flyer and eliminater rvd then the mini royal rumble was on!!!! all ecw high flyers had to face each other for the main event at wm. ultimatly jeff hardy wins but after he wins he says on behalf of the ecw highflyer we wont have a one on one match between tommy dreamer it will be a six man hell in a cell at wrestle manis featuring 3 ecw high flyers(jeff,kofi,r-truth the leader.)we are at wrestle mania but where is jeff hardy .evetually they start it without him and his replacement was evan bourne. the match starts and wwe see that the ecw high flyers all have something in their hands one has a talbe one has a ladder one has a chair one grabs the micro phone and says this is no ordinary hell in a ceell this is a tlc hell in a cell that means the first person to get to the top of the cage and climbs the ladder and retrieves the belt win. highlights of match:tommy dreamer gets thrown off the cell off the ladder that is on top of the cell though a flameing table: evan bourne does the 630 splash to rvd through a table from the top of the cell:rvd put evan through to table and the cell off the ladder on top of the cell and then frog splashes on to him down in the ring from the ladder 1.2... kofi saves him. end of match :everyones down and once the smoke is cleared the champion is ...          HORNSWOGGLE LOL JK.... the champ is         JEFF HARDY who capitalized on all people being down jeff hardy is the first ever ecw extreme champion    how is that for a storyline
5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	script or not when they hit or do a move it's real. there are rough scripts and rehearsals, general idea of how it may go down. they may know what is coming up but when they use a chair or take a pile driver it is done for real, and they have to learn how to take the chair shot & also how to hit with the chair the correct way. if it's done willy nilly & without care someone could end up paralyzed.     oh yha mat got tagged good with that chair.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Well it was part of a storyline so I suppose it was kayabe. The actual chair shot was real in that the steel of the chair hit the head of Jeff Hardy.    Matt and Jeff are very close brothers in reality though.|`|AAoQzU7oaa	no everyone knows its fake|`|NRs72Afxaa	Yes. It was a way to continue the storyline. You people that think the storyline is real is very laughable.|`|iOICjcZcaa	It's part of a storyline. Jeff actually got hit with the chair, but it's just for a storyline. Matt even quit ECW last night and asked to be moved to SmackDown. I think they're just creating a sibling rivalry. Perhaps Matt is jealous that he's been overshadowed by his brother or he's mad because he lost his ECW Championship so now he wants Jeff to lose it too.|`|cAviuUa3aa	Don't care I know Mark Henry doesn't need a steel chair to take someone out like the ***** hardy boys.  He can beat em up and break their necks with his bare hands.|`|bLxPLVNJaa	YES! BUT ON SD HE IS GOING TO BE IN THE RING FIRST THING EXPLAINING HIS ACTIONS|`|sqfjfR3iaa	Yes, he hit him with a steel chair and it is part of the storyline. Jeff may have a minor concussion. This would not be the first time a wrestler has been hit hard enough with a chair that he suffered a concussion.|`|Y8D3nERgaa	Hey Or you're an idiot matt didn't get hit with a chair jeff did. PS learn to spell or type, one of the two.|`|Nzqt4Qu7aa	Sadly yes. There are pictures on WWE.com    Oh & to "Bean Farter" she never asked if Matt got hit, idiot. How about you learn how to read. She asked "Did Matt Really HIT JEFF with the chair" Now I bet you fell stupid.|`|PAhdlQ5eaa	The actually chair shot was photoshopped, I could tell by the pixels.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	Well, the reasons are storyline, but yeah, he hit him in the middle of the ring, "In front of God and everybody."|`|2GMvuliVaa	Yeah the actual chair hit him in the head, but its obviously a storyline Matt and Jeff aren't in reality feuding|`|3icTrKLLaa	Well it is obviously part of the storyline, but if you watched the PPV it did seem like he caught him pretty good with the shot.

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	I think the fans are still going to cheer for their favorites, irrespectibve of whether they're a heel or a babyface.Certain charismatic Superstars will always get major pops due to their ability and popularity.I agree that the fans aren't as rebellious or responsive as in previous times.Back in the Attitude Era, the rebellious edgy atmosphere and the fans' total involvement highlighted this golden era that hasn't been matched since.|`|iOICjcZcaa	People see what they want to see. I don't see them as really "less rebellious."  There are just different age groups in the audience now. You've got A LOT of little kids now. They always cheer for the face.     You've also got a lot of parents who go for their kids and cheer for who their kids are cheering for. The Attitude Era was full of college age or teenage kids. There's going to be a few differences.    I see a lot of signs. I hate signs when I go to WWE events because they hold it up in front of my face. If I can't see, I'll knock that sign down.    I don't think there's any obligations as to who we should cheer for and I honestly can't figure out where you got the idea. John Cena gets booed out of the building nearly every night and Randy Orton has been getting cheered for more than ever.|`|3I6YUfg0aa	I cheer for Randy Orton and he is a heel.  I don't care what anyone else thinks, he is my favourite superstar.|`|GKJV2EBSaa	WWE fans are definitely not as rebellious as they used to be.For example,remember 1999 royal rumble when Vince won.The ring was filling up with garbage people threw in there.Since the wwe has turned PG,there are more kid wrestling fans than before.|`|TAPBWPJLaa	Well, you have to look at a lot of things.    WWE and its security at shows is more controlling now than in the past, and throwing garbage into the ring has been stopped years ago. And also, a lot of fans may look like lost "sheep" because the WWE does not care about their opinion. For the most part, they push whomever they want the fans to like and dislike. There is barely an option to who fans really want to see when it comes to a lot of people.    When you're following a story, you're supposed to cheer for the good guys and boo the bad guys anyways. You don't watch a movie and cheer for the cold murderer, do you?|`|sqfjfR3iaa	You're only hearing what World Wrestling Entertainment wants you to hear. Those of us who go to House Shows, Television Tapings, Live Events and Pay Per Views cheer and boo whomever we want. A lot of fans cheer for Heels and WWE drowns those cheers out, so that you only hear the cheers for the Babyfaces. If fans are not into a match, it may be because they are bored. A number of wrestlers can do a lot of wrestling holds and wrestling moves that the WWE does not let them do. If you went to House Shows, Television Tapings, Live Events and Pay Per Views you would see this for yourself. I've always rooted for whomever I want to root for, I don't follow the dictates of the WWE Booking Team. Please note if your signs are inappropriate, Arena Security will confiscate them.|`|cAviuUa3aa	It's because they are forced to cheer for crap wrestlers who aren't exciting, and little kids are too stupid to realize what a heel and face are. I wish Mark Henry would come out and worlds strongest slam everyone.|`|ikyij2g3aa	No their still kinda energetic. For example look at cm punks match vs Jericho in Canada...that was off the hook and an awesome thrill ride do to the fans cheering for Jericho and sticking their middle fingers at cm punk(some did in the front row). But sometimes ya the crowd is like a lost sheep which causes an affect on a match.|`|17kowr6yaa	After Orton's return from injury, he is no longer booed much anymore. I think he gets more cheers from the Raw fans than Cena gets. Also, at Survivor series, Cena's return was over-hyped. But the fans really went crazy for the Edge's return. (remember when Vickie said, "He's here, he's here! Here he is!" When Edge came out instead of Jeff, I think most people cheered. Orton and Edge are the biggest heels.|`|bLxPLVNJaa	STFU points and run
PNu9c7UZaa	He quit WWE in December of 2003 because traveling was to much for him and he was tired of it.  After that he worked in a few indy promotions in Australia and he did a few movies.  However he did sign a contract with TNA and he should me making his appearance on TV very soon.|`|cAviuUa3aa	He got slammed by Mark Henry and ran away back to prison where he belongs.|`|X9iZA9svaa	he retired i dont know why|`|EbTtmXViaa	What happened to Nathan Jones is he couldn't wrestle his way out of a paper bag so he was released.  He is currently squeegeeing windows at a car wash near you.|`|6LQNK51uaa	If I m not wrong than ur talking bout Nathan Jones...if he is the one than he is currently retired from wrestling,tried his luck in movies and there is a rumor that he signed a contract with TNA and is going to start his second inning as a wrestler in March 2009.|`|3icTrKLLaa	After he left WWE he was supposed to make an appearance at the Australian Wrestling Supershow III but no showed the event.     In 2005 he wrestled 3 matches for World Series Wrestling.    As of now he is primarily and actor, playing small roles, and cameos. He was even in The Condemned with Stone Cold.

h2KkiKK3aa	it's because they believe that when you shoot an animal, it sufferers before it dies, which in most cases of good sportmanship never happens, because the animal either dies instantly or adrenaline or endorphins stop the pain signals from reaching the brain, so there's no suffering.  they believe what they say so much that even when scientists say no, they still have it in their heads that the answer is yes.  they also from what I see bribe scientists to tell the public to do their bidding, because there are few scientists that believe in what they say.  I say F*** them all and they should go do their own thing, it's ok to believe in what you want to, I respect that, but never push your ideals on others, hitler did that to his people and look what happened, now with obama in office, we can only hope he has the decency to respect our beliefs.|`|WBGnXsr7aa	Isn't life ironic? and hypocritical?|`|6pUzzsuhaa	they don't like us because we ain't jumpin on the "band-wagon" and that our opinions are different from them. they understand nothing about hunting, livestock, etc..   they are as hypocritical as a person/"organization" can get.. they say one thing and do another, but yet they'd be the first people/"organization" to say that someone else was being hypocritical.   they are the kind of people who thing that THEY are right and they are like damn to the people who don't agree with them    they are just using up a lot of people's hard earned money by saying that they'll help animals, but farmers and us hunters do more good than they could ever try to do    like with the "educational" videos they have on youtube, they show the VERY VERY VERY few bad things that happen out there when people hunt and (this is a bigge of theirs) slaughter houses- all they show, is the worst possible thing and out of the 99.99999999999999% of people who hunt and the slaugher houses, they show the small, and i mean SMALL number of people/companies who dont do things 'right'|`|kQSSz2X2aa	They unfortunately have been misguided and believe that they are doing the right thing. If there is one thing that we can learn from PETA it would be the story of the honeybee. We've all heard about the huge impact that an increasingly dwindling number of honeybees could have on the environment (lack of pollination so the plants die, a big hole in the food chain that causes everything else to cave in, etc). Humans are just as much a part of the food chain as any other animal. As we can see form the honeybee example, taking a big part of the food chain out is a bad idea. Why they promote this I do not know.   Also, I think hunting is way more ethical than raising an animal for slaughter. The animal live in its natural environment and lives a free life with no fences or human abuses. There is no fuel wasted in processing the meat and shipping it across the country. The death is quick also. I think I also appreciate the meat more when I hunt it myself, field dress it, and butcher it. I realize everything that went into making that steak for dinner. It's not just going to the grocery store to buy individually cut steaks in little styrofoam containers.|`|d9L9C4dHaa	Those PETA followers are nuts , I bet most of them grew up eating meat then got with some nut that was against meat eaters and changed there ways.  If Peta got there way to ban people from eating beef or other meats that would put a lot of farmers out of work.    Just don`t get between me and my steak.|`|xOReEw6Waa	"Solent Green Is People", so maybe PETA just wants to hurry that along.If you look at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), you would see that hunters are THE MOST ETHICAL of any group. We pay for our rights out the nose while PETA folks whine and cry because  reintroduce wolves have to be shot because they just decimated an entire herd of elk and are now taking cattle. I think PETA people need to take a real, informative hunter education class before they get to grouse too much.|`|GpzvrlHdaa	They do this to feel the thrill of power, and to make money by fraudulent means (animal protection my a$s).

J6xmZqj1aa	What do you think, runners are skinny, if you want to bulk up which is not a good idea then you have to lift.  Would you rather be to thin or fat|`|3icTrKLLaa	Do some light weight lifting and weight training.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	If you are running a lot you have to eat A LOT more than the average person. I think I read that Michael Phelps ate something like 15,000 calories a day during training. That's pretty extreme - 8 hr of swimming per day. I imagine a distance runner would have to eat a lot too. Protein shakes and high calorie supplements can help.|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Make sure you get enough protein and carbs.  You don't have to stop cold, you can run moderately, right?  Besides, too much can be a lot to your joints.  Balance it out with strength training and other activities.|`|AA11447210	You have to consume enough calories so that there isn't a deficit due to your activity (running). Basically, eat more (just keep it healthy!)|`|Mya9LUxuaa	The more you run the more you eat.  You need more calories for more energy.  Don't be afraid to eat a lot if you run.  Michael Phelps ate between 8000 and 12000 calories per day to cope with the 2 intense practices a day he went through and he isn't fat at all.|`|fPbjSNEHaa	To be honest, being lean is good for a runner, especially for someone who competes. So long as you are eating well and don't feel exhausted and malrourished when you run, then I would not be worried. Don't give up if you really enjoy it.|`|RAjycr4waa	Lift weights along with running and keep eating healthy.|`|BgNjbppuaa	You just have to increase your calorie intake and lift weights to increase muscle mass.|`|vAcgZVspaa	cross train with weights to build weights|`|KoJ0rddfaa	Agreed with Alex F.     being skinny as a runner has many advantages. although i say go get some muscle! hah, it really does help. so like everyone else said get plenty of protein, sleep well, eat healthy, consider hitting the gym a few times a week and your good (:|`|lgnxK7ECaa	I read it once that you're supposed to eat 100 more calories for every mile you run, so depends on how much you run but in the end you just have to eat a lot of carbs and protein    and as someone said in the beginning its a lot better to be light for running so don't over eat carbohydrates.    And sorry i just wannna ask how long it took for you to start losing weight and about how much were you running a day?

nku1RPbhaa	yes you can say it. if the english language was not so darn difficult. the proper phrase would be they won the super bowl . the players etc. or the team won the game. not the city , state, county etc. the team and only the team won. players have second homes, not the majority of the cardinals. nice and warm. but how nany of the steelers would freeze , rather than return to warm climates. thia is a great great question. better description. very very well done.|`|DRPhJnXzaa	Die Hard Fans - yes    run of the Mill fans - no|`|NG6eeCfuaa	Jake: For fair weather fans, yes, you are correct.

You can definately say "we".|`|4blCVEvOaa	When a team wins....their fans win too. So yeah, it's ok to use "we"    Especially in college sports. I root for my alma mater.

However, if your team loses, then you have to say that we lost. Works both ways.|`|cCC7KTrKaa	Think what you want.

TJMpKqFNaa	Joel Zumaya, a relief pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, used to throw between 101 and 104mph at his hardest (depending on whose radar gun you believe).  That's the fastest I've ever seen or heard of anyone pitching.      People occasionally made contact with his fastball in games so I'd use a speed of 101mph or somewhere in that general vicinity for your estimate.|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	Didn't you just ask this question yesterday?|`|VppCNDrhaa	These are the fastest pitchers recorded   Joel Zumaya *       104.8 mph       10-10-2006       McAfee Coliseum    Mark Wohlers       103.0 mph       1995       Spring Training    Armando Benitez       102.0 mph       05-24-2002       Shea Stadium    Bobby Jenks       102.0 mph       08-27-2005       Safeco Field    Randy Johnson       102.0 mph       07-09-2004       Pacific Bell Park|`|5EuOTAjJaa	We'll never know as the history of baseball goes back 125 + years.

cWfTvJTcaa	Swimming is great exercise for humans. It is the best aerobic exercise and also helps build muscle.  Whales are a completely different species, so the same physiological rules don't apply.

IITnJjAjaa	Start walking for an amount of time that feels comfortable - anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. Once you can walk for 30 minutes easily, sprinkle one- to two-minute running intervals into your walking. As time goes on, make the running intervals longer, until you are running for 30 minutes straight- and there's your endurance! If you want even more endurance, go out for a 30 minute run and then next time add 5 minutes until you're running for 1 hour, you should be very proud once you acheive that!!<br>  <br>  After each training session it is advisable to stretch your legs. This should be a relaxing end to your workout so don’t be too aggressive when performing each stretch. Stretching isn't necessary before a run. Just start the run off jogging slowly to warm up the muscles so you don't pull them and aren't too tight.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have decent running shoes. I definately advise going to a running specialist shop, where they will examine your feet and give you the appropriate shoes for your type of feet (high arches/overpronation ect.) <br>  <br>  Make sure you have a healthy diet, and are well hydrated all the time. Whenever you are ill, remember to not run- it will only make things worse. Try not to always run on concrete or you may end up like me with Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome. Try running on a track (if possible) or sand/grass/dirt.<br>  <br>  Running is good for you. However, your legs have to endure a lot while running. Every step you take, the impact on your legs is two to three times your body weight. Therefore it is wise to incorporate a slow build-up and optional cross training in your running program.<br>  Cross training is any different form of activity which isn’t running like riding a bike, swimming, hiking, walking, going on the elliptical machine, etc.<br>  Cross training is great. It is still helping you increase your fitness while giving your running muscles a break. <br>  <br>  Good luck, i wish you all the best xxx<br>  <br>  Alice xxx|`|o1rHxx80aa	All beginners are at different shapes. Just set yourself a target and try to acomplish it. Like run to the park and back, you shouldn't stretch before running, but the other way round.
jIONJZSJaa	Shonn Greene from Iowa<br>  He was the Doak Walker winner this year which is given to the top running back, Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, and he ran for 100 yards in each game he played this year.

Ph5EkwwNaa	to build up the hype|`|XLXncQu9aa	Two reasons for this:     The first reason is so that the players can have time to rest, get healthy, and be ready to play their best for the super bowl.  Its best to watch two teams going at it at while they are at their highest level.  Who wants to see two teams playing at low levels based on injuries?     The second reason is so the players in the super bowl can get a chance to take in the whole atmosphere.  Many players on the Cardinals and Steelers team have never been to the super bowl, so this is their 1st experience.  The league wants to give first time players, a chance to take in the experience and enjoy it.  1 week isn't enough time to take it all in, or enjoy it to the fullest.  Also there is the whole thing about media day, and the press conferences.  It also builds up excitement for fans the longer the wait is.|`|dPbZeAYVaa	So Vegas make sure they gets sh*t straight.|`|0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	one week to game plan and one week for the festivities...    starting next year, the pro bowl will be played at the site of the super bowl the week prior(the weekend in between the conference championship games and the super bowl) instead of the week following the super bowl in hawaii.    ex:  pro bowl is in miami the weekend prior to the super bowl in miami next year.|`|wkDlHA4Baa	So the teams have more time to practice!!!!!

Ucm3gSedaa	I was a sprinter for the University of Colorado.  During that time I had patellar tendinitis in both knees and tendinitis in my groin.  I'm not sure what to do for the achilles but for the patellar tendonitis, it really helped to get my knees ultrasounded before work outs.  You might not have access to a trainer who does ultrasound so I would suggest heating your knees up with a heat pack.  This loosens the muscles and alleviates some of the pain.  After work outs, it is really important to ice wherever you have tendinitis.  Stretch really well before doing anything.  Sometimes it helped to take some ibuprofen or aleve before running.  Talk to your trainer also.  I was never a big fan of tape or straps but I'm sure there are some things that can help.  I'd say the main thing is heat before, ice after.

IITnJjAjaa	Start walking for an amount of time that feels comfortable - anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. Once you can walk for 30 minutes easily, sprinkle one- to two-minute running intervals into your walking. As time goes on, make the running intervals longer, until you are running for 30 minutes straight- and there's your endurance! If you want even more endurance, go out for a 30 minute run and then next time add 5 minutes until you're running for 1 hour, you should be very proud once you acheive that!!<br>  <br>  After each training session it is advisable to stretch your legs. This should be a relaxing end to your workout so don’t be too aggressive when performing each stretch. Stretching isn't necessary before a run. Just start the run off jogging slowly to warm up the muscles so you don't pull them and aren't too tight.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have decent running shoes. I definately advise going to a running specialist shop, where they will examine your feet and give you the appropriate shoes for your type of feet (high arches/overpronation ect.)<br>  <br>  Make sure you have a healthy diet, and are well hydrated all the time. Whenever you are ill, remember to not run- it will only make things worse. Try not to always run on concrete or you may end up like me with Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome. Try running on a track (if possible) or sand/grass/dirt.<br>  <br>  Running is good for you. However, your legs have to endure a lot while running. Every step you take, the impact on your legs is two to three times your body weight. Therefore it is wise to incorporate a slow build-up and optional cross training in your running program.<br>  Cross training is any different form of activity which isn’t running like riding a bike, swimming, hiking, walking, going on the elliptical machine, etc.<br>  Cross training is great. It is still helping you increase your fitness while giving your running muscles a break.|`|fPbjSNEHaa	To increase endurance, you simply have to go for longer runs. I suggest you aim for a relevant time per run (at your own pace) and step it up by a small margin once you can run it with ease.<br>  <br>  Once you start getting more serious you can do all you endurance training in mileage by aiming for a set mileage per week and dividing the week for a different distance each day to add up to your weekly mileage.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you do not increase your mileage by greater than 10% per week otherwise you are overdoing it and can become susceptible to injury.|`|TC9Z548Maa	Best thing to do is not to focus on what you "used" to be able to run.<br>  <br>  The best way to improve running endurance is to run more. increase your mileage slowly to avoid injury.<br>  <br>  Your never to cool to walk a bit in your running session. For beginners it will help repair tissue and decrease the lactic acid build up.<br>  <br>  If you do sprints in your run this is likely to improve your times but if you want to focus more on your distance run at a pace your comfortable with.|`|Ew6kXVWFaa	I reckon long running at a pace where you are still able to talk.<br>  Build up a base of short runs,maybe 15-20 mins, graudually increase these.<br>  I have found running twice a day effective at building up endurance.<br>  If the long runs become too hard I have split the running over two days.<br>  <br>  From a base of 2 months steady running you could start a endurance running schedule.|`|9d35213b399923e4fdd6fafc382680b0aa	the only way u can improuve your runing is by seting down goals. I've started runing six months ago for about 30 minutes like u however, as the time when by my body begun to get more and more endurance now day I'm runing two and half hours without stoping. Also, whatch your eating habits.|`|ryGHtoddaa	get a coach ans tell him to push you to run more more.<br>  maybe join the track and field team..<br>  <br>  thats the best way to do it

They were lucky that they got that penalty. But i think they shall be able to keep Roma at bay.. We shall c :)|`|xFAyGh8gaa	If they can play at the same quality as they did at The Emirates, they'll have a good chance.  They need to score the first goal to be able to play with reasonable ease, and play a more defensive game.  But I think they'll get through to the next round.|`|oPYw0QYqaa	i would say so... i think Roma will be a lot better at home but i think arsenal will Defo score... So Roma would then need three goals and i cant see that... So yes i thinkyou did.. and you will have Ade or Eduardo back then and wont need to worry with that muppet Bendtner|`|LReOvHEdaa	As Mr Lover said, we might have a better lineup for the next game.<br>  Hopefully Eduardo or Ade would play.<br>  No De Rossi for Roma.<br>  Its 70 % for us,if we had 2 goals then wud have been enough.<br>  Its still positive for us anyway.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	No, too many chances went begging. It should have been 3-0. However as Arsenal have proved in the past, they can play get a decent result in the next leg. Roma have to attack and that will leave them open at the back. I predict a 1-1 draw to send Arsenal through.

QSShHlRiaa	Try to stay up and make the shooter commit first <br>  and dont go down on every shot.<br>  only go down on screen shots and when players try to deke you<br>  if you stand up you have a better chance of stopping it<br>  becuase if its high your shoulder will hit it and try to glove it too.<br>  on low shots use your stick and go down on one knee.<br>  if you wanna be better the only real way to bacome a great goalie is <br>  expierience the more you play the better you will become becuase you will learn when exactly to go down and when to stand up and you will naturally become better. watch pro hockey and how goalies play you will watch them stop most shots on the ice and high shots their almost always screwd becuase they are all ready commited to the shot low when they go down. try to learn the "STAND UP" style of play. put WD40 on yuor pads before games becuase then your pads will slide easier when you make a butterfly save.

AA12371823	Yeah its got to be George.  Its not that he didnt have a great season, because he did, but Frazier was the most dominating player of the year.  Frazier is arguably the greatest college QB of all time, I dont think anyone brings up George when they argue best running backs (and the QB position is a more important position).  Its not a huge knock on George, but the Frazier snub is easily the best example of the heisman bias.  Any time a player from Notre Dame, Ohio State, USC, Florida of Oklahoma has a decent season they win the heisman.|`|0ZqJbmVyaa	Chris Winke come to mind, Gino Toretta, Andre Ware and Danny White were all heisman winners of no acclaim.|`|1fb28de3039f9f98095e0957ec1fca2eaa	Troy Smith,   I do not see how you could even think Woodson did not deserve it,  he was the best player on the team that year,  he played defense, offense and special teams and with out him Michigan would not have won (split) the National Championship that year.|`|RAjycr4waa	Tebow. Take away his size and hes not a good QB. His team makes him look good because they are so wide open and block for him so well. Put him on another team and even with his size he could be a mediocre player. He's a product of his surroundings more than his actual ability.|`|PG1LuEk5aa	WOODSON???...what are you smoking...the guy is a future hof....jesus...how about roy smith.....and are you overlooking the ones right in front of your face chris weinke and matt leinart??...matt leinart by far the worst|`|AA11307224	I'll go with Charles Woodson, not because of his season, but because he wasn't the best player that year.  Peyton Manning should have won the Heisman.  Without him at QB, TN would have been a 9 win team at best during the 1997 season.  He put up incredible numbers every week and set NCAA passing records.  By and large, Manning was screwed.|`|0Lg0Pj0Paa	Danny Wuerrfel- He smelled like earwax|`|5PSQx0Nzaa	That's an easy question to answer.     Hands down...Gino Torretta.  No doubt about it!     He might even be the worst QB ever as well.|`|ZprjlxH3aa	Charles woodson|`|khU8m4gxaa	Nitro is right on the money. Definitely Gino Toretta of Miami in '92. He was the QB on the best team (until they got destroyed by 'Bama in national title game), but he was really mediocre. Marshall Faulk clearly was the best player in the country that year, but was overlooked because he played for SD State.|`|Klw3Ke3Haa	Everybody is forgetting Troy Smith. I have nothing against Ohio St. because Ted Ginn Jr., Antonio Pittman, and Chris Wells were all that. But just because Smith played for a historic program like the Buckeyes, he won it over McFadden who is lighting it up in the SEC that year and Quinn who put up huge  's for the Irish. Smith put up subpar  's at OSU that year.|`|nqdDe3cJaa	without question .... Sam Bradford.    its quite obvious at this point that he put up monster numbers against pathetic Fraud 12 defenses.|`|o7E9LxV8aa	troy smith|`|QtjnmEzoaa	I think a lot of Heisman voters are undeserving. This is because many of the 900something voters don't know squat about college football. Or if they do know about football, they only know about one or two conferences and anyone who isn't in that conference is left out. An additional 150-200 unethical voters vote on an agenda, trying to get a certain person to win whether they deserve it or not. They did that this year by not voting for someone to come in third place, but leaving Tim Tebow off the ballot entirely. Therefore, because of these ignorant voters, it would be difficult for me to pull out just one that is the most undeserving, when in actuallity, a shorter list would describe the players who ARE deserving.    In addition to the players mentioned, I believe Troy Smith ought to be on that list. Smith over Adrian Peterson? Really?|`|wbIEau0qaa	gino toretto and andre ware    woodson was a freaking beast on michigan, he didnt outshine all the offensive players to get snubbed. he earned his heisman|`|0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	you realize that the heisman trophy goes to the most popular star on the most popular championship contending team, right?    with that said...i'd probably go with crouch.      and he only got 700+ points which is the only total lower than 1000 in the last 20 years i think.  most winners get about 1400 to 1800 on average.
8MUj24s6aa	Guns and knives and any other object cannot be good or bad...They are inanimate objects. They can be used for good or bad but that is up to the person behind the object.

If someone kills someone with a piece of rope, should rope be banned? if coconuts have the ability to kill you, should we exterminate them?(25 people a year die from falling coconuts)|`|6pUzzsuhaa	the PERSON who uses them in the wrong way are bad, not the gun or knife- they are just tools    also, people get killed by cars, but no one asks why cars are bad    and- there are MANY things that can kill someone, so are they bad? is a baseball bat bad? how bout a hammer or a screwdriver or rope? its all on the PERSON using it.     then if guns and knives kill people, then its the keyboard and my pencil's fault that i misspell words    and like executioner_bolan said, if you have to ask if you have to ask then you`re too immature to understand    and like at school, we got plastic forks and no plastick knives because i'm guessin they (folks in charge of the school) think we'll hurt each other, which i think is stupid- but if they do that, then they shouldn't allow us to bring pencils and pens.. its ALL out of FEAR and from non-understanding.    and parents SHOULD teach their kids how to use a gun and knife properly and safely, and the parents who haven't taught their kids about gun/knife safety- their no different than using a hammer or a fork|`|NsLtN7oLaa	They are inanimate objects so they are neither  good nor bad.

I'm sure that there are some people who want to ban guns and knives, but that would do nothing to end murder.  Did you ever consider the fact that a mid-size SUV could also make a great weapon?  If you drove one of those at 50mph on a sidewalk in a large city during rush hour, just imagine how many people you could kill.  Also, take a time to think about the 9/11 attacks.  Why didn't the terrorists use machine guns?  They are easy to obtain in urban areas.  The reason why they didn't is that guns simply don't kill people fast enough.  That's the reason why those terrorists resorted to hijacking those planes and flying them into the WTC and the Pentagon.

The poor could be self-made kings once away from previously established conventions along Atlantic Seaboard.  Guns and knives made the self-sufficiency possible and if deemed  bad by modern authority figures then we repeat previous history.  Eat what you catch.|`|cowRdp0jaa	they are not bad,its the people that use them against other people that are bad. my guns and knives hav never hurt anyone!!!|`|AA11646045	They are designed for mortally wounding people.    That is something we should not have the choice to do without the physical capability to do.Knives and guns make it easy for kids to kill when they would find it almost impossible to do manually.    Most people who kill are not mature enough to make a morally correct decision.|`|4i133cAVaa	They are not bad.|`|Y5B7H8Yfaa	Guns and knives aren't bad. The MISUSE of guns and knives is bad.  Guns and knives are tools, and any tool when misused can be turned into a bad thing.|`|1njsqy0laa	They are bad if they fail to function properly. Otherwise they're fine. Calling a certain class of firearms "bad" is pointless. A firearm can't cross the room, load itself, and shoot someone in the head. They require a human to operate them.    If you got killed in a car accident I highly doubt Sarah Brady would push for banning of all Chevy's. Yet that is exactly what happens with firearms and politics. Any firearm used in a crime is therefore bad. And the gun manufacturers who offer special training, obey all the laws, include massive amounts of warnings on all the manuals, and cooperate with the authorities are suddenly "evil".    Someone should sue Chevy when they get hit by a car. Maybe then people will see how absurd some of the lawsuits are.    If liberals don't like them they are probably very efficient. If liberals like them they probably don't work.

IITnJjAjaa	Yep, i have Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome which has been caused by not enough support from my running shoes and too much training on concrete as it has no shock absorption what-so-ever so without proper running shoes, you're asking for an injury, like me. Believe me, you don't want what i've got. I also used to damage my knees without the proper shoes yes because the pounding from the running goes straight to your knees as there's no cushioning in the rubbish shoes i wore!<br>  <br>  No your slightly wrong. The way to get stronger legs is just simply to run more. But running with thin, badly made shoes means you will damage your legs because of the constant pounding from the ground beneath you because you don't have the cushioning which absorbs the shock.<br>  If you want running shoes, go to your nearest running specialist shop- they'll give you asics!|`|fPbjSNEHaa	I would not suggest running in shoes that are not specific for running, particulary if you are familiar with running on the road or hard surfaces. They are not biomechanically designed to withstand weight bearing exercises like running as they are for their specific sport.<br>  <br>  With the correct support in the shoes you will put less emphasis on your lower legs and knees and put more weight on your upper legs and hips which is designed to absorb most of the load from each running step. If you don't have the right footwear you become more susceptible to injury.|`|eaagpElnaa	In my country we have many runners that does up to marathons without shoes. But the important thing is that these runners has been running without shoes since a very young age and their bodies has adapted to it.<br>  As a non professional athlete, do yourself a favour and get to a runnning store and ask them to have a look at your running style and to suggest a good pair of running shoes.<br>  But to answer your question more directly, unless your body has adapted FULLY to running without shoes, you WILL cause your legs/knees/hips damage.|`|1HwyDyD0aa	You would be much better off running in shoes made for running, especially since you're running on hard surfaces.  THere's a good chance that you'll end up with injuries if you do a lot of running in shoes with thin soles, and incorrect support.

The following symptoms are being a douche bag, thinking your cool, thinking your a stud, and being a dogmatic little ******. The problem is, any ******* person with the I.Q. over 10 (which is the reason you don't understand) can tell by the way you eny others and try to hide it by disrespect others, proves your an arrogant little *****. Now, grow some hair on those microscopic things you call testicles, get your facts right, and quit calling people pusseys or panseys just because they are more athletic, smarter, better looking, and just straight out better than you in every aspect of life.|`|UQLNP6iyaa	Deleting a question to try and avoid getting owned? That's just wimpy son. Don't worry, I save my good answers for just such occasions:    I love most sports. I love each of them for their uniqueness. Your comparisons are ridiculous. Let's see a 280 pound lineman run virtually non-stop for 2 periods of 45 minutes. Do you know what would happen? It's called cardiac arrest.    Soccer is a non-contact sport requiring supreme skill, flair, stamina and fitness. American football is a full contact sport requiring supreme power, tactical understanding, short bursts of speed and muscular weight. You are attempting to compare Ferraris to dump trucks. Each has extraordinary ability, but each is for a different purpose.    Also, Soccer is the world's game. There are very few large countries where it is not the national sport. As much as I love my NFL, the same cannot be said.    What you are doing is like comparing boxing to tennis. You're not going to want to hear it and you're not going to take it well, but these are facts and xenophobia and ignorance isn't going to change that.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	I love football but if I could make millions in soccer do I care, Girls are attracted to $$$ not your ability.

They also almost never substitute.  And the same team stays on the field all the time.  They dont take a nap when another "team" is on the field.  Football has a lot of rules that are unique.  For instance blocking and forward passes.  these rules make the game difficult to watch and understand when these actions are illegal in sports in other countries.  Most importantly they dont play football in other countries!  it is an american sport and has very little following anywhere else.  you probably dont know anything about rugby or cricket, and so are you likely going to watch/play these sports for fun?  not likely.  I'll bet you dont care.  one could think you are a sissy for not playing/watching/liking rugby.  The US couldnt even make it into the Rugby world cup,  what a bunch of girls.  There have been foreign players.  do a little research before you post an asinine question.

Both men have been dead for years and both wrote books. I think McGiverns book was called "fast and fancy shooting". The best I've ever done, and it took 6 shots, was hitting a beer can at 100 yds. I had to "walk" the bullets up to it. The gun was much more accurate than I was. Maybe I just got lucky.    Now I am happy when I got a deer at 50 yards.

qyATAaeXaa	My favorite place for such an activity is the High Peaks area of the Adirondacks in NY State. If you want to haul your gear into the woods a few miles and make a base camp, consider Johns Brook Lodge. If you want to car camp, look into getting a spot at the Adirondak Loj. (That's the way it's spelled.) This way if you have the sudden urge for a steak, a run to the brewpub, or need a pizza you can easily just head into Lake Placid. Both places have primitive camping sites.     From both locations you can take many day hikes through the area.     http://www.adk.org for more info.    If you are looking for a base camp area and don't mind a drive to the trailhead, look into any of the Vermont State Parks. I like Jamaica State Park and Emerald Lake due to their proximity to the Long Trail and many other side trails in southern VT. There's also plenty of places to camp long term in the Green Mountain National Forest.      http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/greenmou...    I've also stayed at Dolly Copp campground in the White Mountain National Forest in NH. Again. It's a drive to the trailheads, but you are very close to the Presidentials.     http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/white_mo...

IITnJjAjaa	Steps<br>  <br>  # Start slowly. In the beginning, don't tackle seven miles in a single run. Start with two or three and work your way up. For novices, runs longer than 10 miles will hurt you, for more experienced runners, more than 16 miles in a run will do more harm than good.<br>  # Run with a group!. This cannot be stressed enough. If you're in high school, join your school's team. It's extra important to find people of a similar skill level, so you can push and support one another. A coach is helpful too.<br>  # Always warm up and stretch. A warm up should be a couple of laps to a couple of miles, depending on how long you have been running. After you have warmed up, stretch. Stretching will prevent or lessen your chances of injury.<br>  # Do different exercises. Make a schedule for yourself and make each day different. On one day, do your long run to improve your stamina. On another day, do some hill repeats.<br>  # Always Post Stretch It is more important to stretch after you run than before you run. Stretching after you run prevents injuries.<br>  # Do push ups and sit ups every day. This will strengthen your upper body, which is also vital in a race. Start with fifteen push-ups and twenty-five sit-ups and work your way up.<br>  # Become friends with your cross country team, even if it seems like they hate your guts..you're a team, and you'll really like each other.<br>  <br>  Tips<br>  <br>      * Some people prefer to start out fast. By starting fast, you will end up running ahead with the top ability level runners, and there will be less people in front of you, which is both encouraging, and prevents you from being boxed in. but taking off too fast is a very bad thing to do. For every second you take off too fast in a race you lose 3-4 seconds on your over all time. You should try and find a good race pace for you to use and every race make your race pace a little faster.<br>      * Keep thinking, "It doesn't matter how I feel now because it will all be over soon."<br>      * Keep consistently training because if you let yourself drop, you'll be sorry.<br>      * In the late fall and winter it is cold outside which is not motivating and you may drop, so go to your local fitness center and run on the track or treadmill.<br>      * It helps to run with music to take your mind off the pain, like an iPod. Make a playlist for cross country consisting of upbeat songs to make you run faster. Avoid running to the beat if it's too slow.<br>      * Alternatively, think about your running pace. Learn what it sounds like. Focus on the sound of your feet hitting the ground. Then, think about your breathing. How many strides does it take to complete a cycle of breathing (inhale and exhale). Think about how your breath and stride sound and fit together. When you really know this sound, concentrate on the rhythm to help you ignore pain, keep up your pace, or have something to reflect on.<br>      * On the verge of giving up? Think of a song in your head and mentally hum it.<br>      * Listen to music when you run.<br>      * Drink lots of water to stay hydrated. However, don't drink too much before running, as it will often cause cramping.<br>      * Bring a banana to eat after a workout or race. The sugar in the banana will be quickly absorbed by your body, restoring your energy. Also, the potassium found in bananas will help prevent cramps.<br>      * If you must practice on roads try to stick to the grass or the road shoulder as much as possible. It's easier on your joints and safer for you in case of a fall or an oncoming vehicle. If you live in an area where grass or road shoulders aren't available, work out on a track, and see about visiting a local park a few times a month for a change of scenery.<br>      * Varied workouts are key to having fun and maintaining your motivation. Even if you like slogging 12 miles a day for a practice, mix it up! Change routes if you run on roads, run laps around the town park or playground, or play games like tag, capture the flag, or deer and wolves in place of sprint workouts. Obstacle courses can also be fun and you can scatter workout stations like push ups or squat-thrusts between the obstacles.|`|TC9Z548Maa	You haven't given enough Information on your ability are you a beginner ? Have you ever run cross country before?<br>  <br>  If you a beginner you will have to start slowly as you don't want to burn out before the end of the race.<br>  <br>  Running cross country is harder than road running. You'll have to take shorter stride lengths but this means you have to increase you leg speed.<br>  <br>  The only way to improve is just to do more running do more hills in your training sessions. Relax while running, don't focus on your breathing too much your body will naturally pick a rhythm it's happy with.<br>  <br>   Running isn't easy you have to train your body but your body learns quickly to training and you will improve.<br>  <br>  There is also a link you may want to read up on<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Run-Cross-Country" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Run-Cross-Country</a>

SMX228Olaa	They played the Atlanta Falcons which ended in a 10-10 tie.
RdhCN6ZXaa	all the ones you wold think
yulika3laa	Of course they can beat Real Madrid. But Real Madrid can beat them too. Nyehehehehe.|`|ePFdhsCYaa	No they are not good enough this season.|`|XU1KaWXwaa	we were born ready well atleast after rafa joined|`|UH1ipgJmaa	Real Madrid & Liverpool are such great teams that the team playing their best in a given night will win.     Though Liverpool have a great chance due to their glorious nature in the Champions League|`|huto12P3aa	I hope not|`|zu0W6hCTaa	it will be a great game but i would have to go with liverpool bc they have been pretty consistent.......Real losing some players and it makes a huge impact on the team|`|0lplyfe6aa	OBVIOUSLY.......|`|zN0orpp3aa	Can they beat them? Sure they can. Will they beat them? Not so sure.|`|40cUhBfnaa	Of corse Liverpool can win! and I sure hope they do....Torres will be motivated to play against them, we have more speed than Madrid|`|zDfp2PGpaa	If they can beat Barcelona, Juve etc they can also beat Real, also they always seem to play better in the champions league.
YfJHliLWaa	I always wait until the bathtub is full to get in.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	If I took baths (which I don't, the shower is the only way to go), yes, I'd get in while the water ran.  It makes it easier to adjust the temperature and keep it comfortable as you approach the right amount of water, and keeps you from putting too much in and overflowing the bathtub.    The only way I'd bath is right after a shower, otherwise you're just soaking in your own filth!|`|1hpctY4saa	Every now and then when I take a bath to relax... I always like to get in as the water is running.|`|RS6TvY2eaa	no,,take a shower if u have the option ,,y bath in youre on filth|`|AA11619635	Nope. I always wait until its full.|`|KoJ0rddfaa	i used to take baths when younger. but now i just shower. sitting in dirty water really grosses me out. besides, you can pee in the shower and not have to sit in it! hahaha      but to answer your question, i never did. i would watch tv and use the excuse the tub isn't filled up enough yet! haha
z7JsVzcnaa	There is no standard size or shape for the panels on soccer balls.  It varies by design and manufacturer.|`|f9dRts2zaa	why does this even matter? How would you measure the adidas teamgeist balls?
wjkVCD3Kaa	Its not pointless, you just need to aim better.    Get a smaller gun if you're too weak to handle a 12g|`|cBF3UiEraa	who the hell told you that?  get your *** to the range,  never take a shot on game without being properly sighted in.  when you pull that trigger you should know the exact hairs its gonna split.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	Taking a shotgun to the shooting range is one of my favorite things to do..... I bring a smooth bore 12 gauge Mossberg 500 8 shot Persuader, set up 12 and 15 inch steel plates at 75, 100 and 125 yards and target shoot with slugs.... 2 3/4 inch slugs -- This is with open iron sights..... Out of 8 shots I usually get 6 or 7 in the target.... Most guys can't do that.... Of course I practice a lot -- My son doesn't get it -- I do own several rifles but like to shoot steel gong targets with a shotgun...... I get a lot of looks of astonishment doing what I do because most of the deer hunters cant hit the target at all with a long barrel shotgun.... Others dont think you can hit anything with a smooth bore and cheap slugs at 100 yards.....    Pointless? - Not at all --     http://www.mossberg.com/images/Mossberg_...|`|AA12034449	if you still miss despite all the shells...it's not pointless to take your shotgun into a shooting range. Matter or fact..ask around and hire a shooting instructor to help you out.    Sounds like you need the work. Stay awake in your language arts (English) class too.|`|m5FyTeYgaa	You can miss with a rifle too. Rifles and shotguns are meant for different purposes. If you shoot a shotgun at a 100 yard rifle range, well that is pointless. Almost as bad as shooting a rifle at a clay bird flying overhead at the skeet range. Does that help?|`|K5AeQuSNaa	You need to work on aiming, and you need to practice with any weapon you are planning on using.  I take my social shotgun (a polite way of saying riot gun) to the range all the time.  Normally I am more interested in practicing reloading drills, snap shooting, and engaging multiple targets at different ranges.  Hitting with it ceased to be an issue several thousand rounds ago.  I also work on patterning it with buckshot to see how different brands and sizes perform, and make sure that it is still zeroed in with slugs.  All and all it is just an excuse to go play with it, but I would much rather have lots of hours behind the trigger if I ever need to use it for real.  That time practicing could hardly be considered wasted in my book.  If you want to really get to know your shotgun, go play with it as often as you can.  So what if you blow the paper targets to so much confetti?  You are building your familiarity with your shotgun, and developing muscle memory for the future.  You never know.  That may really pay off for you some day.|`|6pUzzsuhaa	its no where near pointless    at shooting ranges, you can shoot any firearm you own (basically- like rifles, handguns AND shotguns)    you can shoot may different types of skeet- like wobble trap, high-low house, etc..    and "you can still miss, despite all the shells" wtf!   with shotguns- there's little bb's in the shotshell, and that's what the 'projectile/s' is/are. with a bullet, you only have 1 thing as a projectile- most generally with shotguns you have bb's as the projectile- except with slugs    and with rifles/bullets you can still miss and the number of shells you shoot has nothing to do with how much you miss- it all depends on WHO is shooting    trust me, it's not pointless (:   i go a good few times to the local shooting range to shoot skeet. and now because i decided not to join the shotgun team (because of how the team is, including some coaches) i'm going to be going more once it warms up.     going to a shooting range to shoot your shotgun has many benefits- like learning to shoot skeet (or any other divisions of skeet shooting) or warming up before you go bird hunting|`|AA11694178	It sounds like you have some kind of problem and need help but I cannot tell from your question exactly what it is that you want to know.  If I were to venture a guess at what your question is, it would be that you are an exceptionally bad shot and cannot hit your target with anything including a shotgun.  If this is the case, you need to find a gun range that has an instructor on staff.  Take some lessons from him/her to learn how to shoot.|`|dfBwVxXFaa	huh?????|`|Ui2WJH4Iaa	it's not.  it gives you an idea how far the pellets will spread.  helpful in deciding what type choke to use.|`|1njsqy0laa	Pointless? it's not pointless. I take mine to the range for trap shooting. If your range doesn't have trap capabilities you can still practice with a slug.|`|CFQbdDRNaa	I dont go to shooting ranges.......THEY COST MONEY!!!!|`|6a4582a15eb74a69588c137e20137d04aa	You learn to hold it, swing it, get used to the recoil etc. There are plenty of other reason to. Trying different ammo to see how it patterns. How different choke tubes affect patterning.       American Patriot - There are plenty of new sabot slugs that can go 100- 150 yards. You can actually group them pretty tightly too. In other words it isn't pointless to take a shotgun to a 100 yard range.|`|UJmfDAI9aa	Even with a shotgun, I still go trap shooting at the range before Dove and Quail season to warm up, so as to make sure I will hit something when I actually go out.|`|b3Ox5mIRaa	in my opinoin shotgun is the most likely and best choice for home defense if u are going to be shooting some one most likely its going to be in that situation the shotgun does not have the velocity of everbodys favorite scarface guns your ak and ar but thats the best part u arn't going to kill miss johnson next door u get alot of variations of pellet spread i personally live in a apartment so i load 000 buck shot magnums for first 3 and the rest are 3inch magnum slugs to really take some meat that being said u really need to know the firearm like the back of your hand not only should u take it to the range run dry drills through your home and vary your loads to room size in your home depening on your safe zones and kill zones u also may want to think about mounting a light it is every gun owners responability to know what they are shooting and what is behind it before pulling the trigger|`|oYf3jSq6aa	Not at all pointless    I am deadly accurate with a rifle and pistol but could ne hit anything with a shotgun until someone pointed out that I was shooting a shotgun like a rifle    No gun is a magic talisman that sends bullets out on target by shear will power of the shooter  They all take practice and instruction of some kind
xaSEuGBGaa	Ive been following Shark Boy for a long time now, and i think he is underrated big time. He has a kind of cult following so I dont think TNA will be getting rid of him anytime soon. His Stone Cold parody is funny as hell, if you cant appreciate it for what it is, and only see it as TNA stealing an idea from WWE then your just ignorant. Ideas are taken from other companies all the time but for some reason peole ***** about this more than any other it seems. Look at the bWo or the JOB Squad for example. Hell if you wanna get into it could be said the entire attitude era was "stolen" from ECW. Its very hard in this biz to come up with new and fresh stuff, chances are when an up and coming superstar comes out and wows you with that awesome move youve never seen, its been done in Japan for the last ten years or by some independant circuit and you just dont know it. Shark Boy will be back I assume, maybe without the SCSA gimmick, but yeah i bet my money hes not getting cut. Him getting a shot at the belt would be awesome and I think its long overdue to let him have his moment.|`|AA11482019	He's still on the TNA roster, but I haven't seen him for a while.  By the way, today is his 34th birthday.|`|NRs72Afxaa	He's been off on Tv since after No Surrender. Personally I hope Tna gets rid of Sharkboy as he is a waste of space now.     Shark Boy as X Division Champion? Dear lord have Mercy!|`|6LQNK51uaa	Ahh by god Sharkboy is no more on TV...I love TNA more than ever.|`|5vXgcAbCaa	his gimmick is a cheap copy off of Stone Cold's. NOBODY, can get it "right on the money" besides Stone Cold Steve Austin.

Seriously, though, Undertaker because the lights go out, and I don't like the dark.|`|awNQ0h2gaa	Hes not in WWE any more, but I fear Tonga Fifita the most, he was known to be extremely dangerous in a psychical confrontation, he has been known to choke people, throw them threw doors, and even bite their noses off, but not on TV, in real life!|`|I4tOY0Wjaa	t-t-t-tonga f-f-fifita issss th-th-the sc-scariest man e-e-ever|`|Os0s1Usvaa	the boogeyman|`|VuIxxJvqaa	Hornswoggle.

Would love to keep it going.|`|9DLsBJJQaa	i think they played great  i didnt get to see the whole game cause i was at school but i got to see some and i think berba played really well with his amazing ball controling skillz    lets hope they can play like that against everton|`|xiDeae1saa	i've been praying we would recapture our form from the beginning of the season and now we have the tittle is ours to lose|`|UuG0gQ81aa	More like how bad were West Brom|`|H8j4rauFaa	They were playing ten man bottom of the league West Brom, with many players on yellow cards.  I could understand if you'd beaten a top 5/6 team in such emphatic fashion but seen as you didn't stop making a fuss over absolutely nothing!|`|91hnAOjbaa	they wern't awesome. even though they won they still didn't play that well. after westbrom got paul robinson sent of anyclub could have scored five.
xiDeae1saa	yeah berba seems the real deal albeit the 31 million price tag...i guess fergie got it right again...trust the 'old man'|`|HxET88bDaa	Berbatov is by far the better player, he is a magician/ genius, no matter what people say about him.|`|huto12P3aa	Berbatov has definately been the better buy, he's finally got on a decent scoring run and is a very good all round player|`|yulika3laa	Hahaha, I don't see Liverpool fans backing Robbie too much now. I think they've finally realized that they've been wasting their time doing so.|`|HpK07Wipaa	Just see at the end of the season. Keane WILL find form and form a great partnership with Fernando Torres. He will score more goals. Plus Bergatov is 10 million more expensive|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	no comparison Berbatov is much better keane a 20 million kop copout lmao
huto12P3aa	He'll be back at spurs by summer or maybe celtic, cos after all not only has he said liverpool is his childhood team, hes said that about celtic too lol|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	liverpool will need him when they have to sell loads of players to pay back the 350 million debt in July or go bankrupt|`|HpK07Wipaa	The season hasn't finished yet.Torres and Keano haven't had time to form a partnership yet|`|uuQDWo49aa	he will get sold to a foreign club|`|bkID8baLaa	Keane is not going anywhere !! He still has plenty to offer the club, just keep faith and he will come good. Have faith my son and go forth and be righteous on your quest through life.|`|TKDi70uTaa	i dont think it will happen, spurs have defoe back and need another bigger more powerfull striker. keane will not go back to spurs either he thinks he is better than he is.|`|fEWhwumZaa	I think the real question is are Spurs really stupid enough to buy him back?|`|zJCWIWE0aa	..9th question and still counting....    -.-|`|Pfq2zRejaa	sell him to everton and lucas as well
oXcMRxOdaa	West Ham 2-0 over Hull. The only reason Hull was good this season was because of the element of surprise. Nowadays, nobody underestimates them.|`|WiXVQEPjaa	West ham , xx|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	HULL 2 -1  enjoy the day|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	West Ham.

RS3fjNboaa	Hate is a strong emotion, so I'm assuming you are using the term loosely. With that in mind, here's my list:    Steelers, because of the Super Bowl history between them and the Cowboys    Niners because of the the NFC championship history between them and the Cowboys    All the NFC East rivals of the Cowboys.    It ain't personal hate for me. It's just that the Cowboys have played the above mentioned teams so many times, some very good rivalries have developed.    Edit: We know, Kendall.

Minnesota Vikings: Ugly uniforms, boring team...what's all the fuss?    Indianapolis Colts: Because of the way Irsay Sr. slithered out of Baltimore for greener pastures in Indiana. Can you say scumbag?    New York Giants: An undeserving team that stole a Super Bowl last year and proved this year their win was a fluke.|`|uEMyWOHnaa	There are several teams that I don't like but only one I hate - the titans.    Bud Adams, the owner who stole Houston's franchise and moved it to Tennessee, is the sole reason for hatred. When a man takes your football team and its history, there is no other option. Not only did the name Oilers follow with him but the entire history of Houston pro football. No one in Tennessee cares about the great running styles of Earl Campbell or the coaching technique of Bum Philips.     Add on to that with the titans keeping the color scheme and always wearing the powder blue when they play the Texans. Then there was Bud's move to draft Vince Young in the 2006 draft. He made his coach and GM do it even though they never wanted the man. Why? Because Young is from Houston. Adams even held the press conference in Houston after the pick. Glad that hasn't worked out for him at all.    There is no other reason to straight out hate a team. I'm not a Cowboy fan, but I respect the history of what they once were. I don't like the Raiders, but that's solely because their owner is an idiot. Bring back solid leadership and I could pull for Oakland under the right circumstances.     Ask Brown fan how they feel about the Ravens. Ask Baltimore fan how they feel about the Colts. These fans have reason to hate. I'm one of them. I'm a Texan.|`|f9e2c1711dc59ec9e6c730eee131216aaa	Dolphins  Steelers  Ravens      The bucs are the best bye bye jon (little Chucky)|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	the cowboys for obvious reasons. they show zero class on or off the field and they love criminals. they are all about headlines and making money.

It's in my blood, I'm a Brown's fan and these are the Browns biggest rivals.  The Ravens are the old Browns and the Steelers are and always will be a Browns rivarly.  I don't care what the arrogant Steeler's fans have to say about it, it's a rivalry and always will be.    Edit:  IM the next CHUCK NORRIS-  You're a dumba*s.  That is all.|`|nRSjUKJZaa	The Raiders- They have always been a rival and no matter how poorly they play I just can't seem to not hate them.     The Chargers- They are a good team and the one team in our division right now that we have to fight the hardest against to win against and of course the rivalry between Rivers and Cutler makes the hate grow even stronger.     Those are really the only two teams a hate.|`|4kdlE54Paa	I don't hate any team at all.  However, I do hate certain fan base.  In the 2007 season, I couldn't stand the Patriot fan base.  Way too many bandwagon fans ranting the most rediculous crap.  I found it quite annoying.  Where are these Patriot fans now?  I only know a few.    For the longest time I have never really liked the Cowboy fans and they regained the title this year.  Nothing worse than hearing the most arrogant and ignorant bandwagon fan base there is.  I hate how they try and make people believe they are Americas Team.  Here is a fact:  ESPN took a poll on the most hated NFL team.  We all know that there are 32 teams in the NFL.  The winner with 49% of the vote are the Cowboys.  That is about half of the NFL fan base that can't stand the Cowboys.  So how are they Americas Team if half the country hates them?    Please do not get me wrong though.  There are Cowboy fans that I do respect.  There are true Cowboy fans that are not arrogant and are realistic about their team.  On Y!A, you know who you are.  Those fans have my respect.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|a6EndAPiaa	1) The Giants -- as a Redskins fan for the last 33 years the Giants have knocked the Redskins out of the playoffs and or caused them not to make the playoffs more than any other team  2) The 49ers -- a team that was built by a great coach whos players get way more credit than they deserve and a team that was no better than the Redskins but is consider a dynasty just because their super bowl wins happened to occur in a ten year period that started and ended in a zero the Redskins teams were just as good but their last super bowl win occurred 1 year outside the decade.  3) The Cowboys -- did I mention that I am a Redskins fan|`|QtjnmEzoaa	I don't like the Patriots because I'm a Colts fan. The mutual dislike is only natural. I do respect them though.  I don't like the Cowboys because everything they do makes me respect them even less, if that's possible.  I don't like the Chargers 1) because I'm a Colts fan, and they've got a pretty good rivalry going. The feeling is mutual. and 2) because I can't stand the attitudes of half their roster. and 3) because their fans (for the most part) are even more cocky than their players. I know all teams have fans like this, it just seems like Chargers fans are the worst.|`|43daa72d6abd58775d0e46a24824eddeaa	K.C. the greatest underachieving team in 20 years. always on the brink of a great season then they choke.|`|ntLUHiTAaa	pats (with brady)  giants  steelers  titans  the reason why to be honest is that there good|`|JSGLKnA4aa	all of them i don't like football. their all over paid. spoiled.|`|jlk4HF6Xaa	ok well I HATE THE COWBOYS because im and Eagles fan. i think tthat is valid enough.

Uhm... thats about it.|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	Denver Broncos.      They're a division rival.  Also, they're fans travel pretty well and Denver isn't very far from KC so there are a lot of them at Arrowhead when the Chiefs/Donkeys play there.  Nothing I dislike more than seeing other colors in te Sea of Red and  there are always a lot of orange dots in the crowd when Denver comes to town.    In all honesty, there is some jealousy in there as well.  Both had some great teams in the 90s but where the Broncos won 2 Super Bowls, the Chiefs failed miserably in the playoffs.|`|s9Pwnb87aa	I hate no teams, but I do hate certain players.|`|xbQZ6xXvaa	pittsburgh because i hate there colors i hate big cry baby i hate chiniese recivers and i also am a cleveland fan so that will sum it up for you o wait your a pitt. fan and i hate the fans because my best friends dad is a pitt fan and i hate him so yeah all pit fans are jackasses including you jackass|`|Gy1YkHoeaa	I am not a hater but a lover of my fellow man.

Not to mention the hordes of bandwagon fans.     That about does it for team "teams", as for players that I dislike so much that I cheer against their team?    Eli Manning: I will always be happy to see the Giants lose as long as he is their quarterback. I will even cheer on Dallas over New York while he is there.|`|8KfX1n2qaa	See: Cavs Browns Indians lol  But i really hate the Steelers because they are so cocky and arrogant.

2kVmQWF0aa	Can Chris Jericho make Mr.Rourke look good?  No, because he is no where close to a professional wrestler, and no one honestly gives a crap about Mickey Rourke he is not a big name.

There is no way he can look good even with a seasoned veteran like Jerico there to, um, help.    WQ: Unless there are some FANTASTIC matches, then WM will do average at best.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	I think that Jericho can't do much to make a non-wrestler look like a great wrestler at 56 years old, no one can do that really. I really think that Jericho will get a different match at Wrestlemania and Rourcke will just be the Special Referee.     WQ: I think it will do pretty well because it's the anniversary and so many will want to see it just for the expected 5* show for 25 years.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Don't count out Mickey Rourke because of his age.

I never liked Chris Jericho so perhaps we can have another WWE special--the "screwjob"--maybe Jericho can get counted out in the Sharpshooter--hey, its been done to death, but this is the WWE after all.|`|pmjOiQFvaa	i think that statement suits shawn michaels more but Y2J is also a good workerbut HBK is better at brining out the best in his opponent aftterall he is mr wrestlemania, mickey may be 56 etc old sack inexperienced but dat doesnt mean the match wont live up 2 ur expectations in fact last years big show vs mayweather exceeded everyones expectations this match can also be a possibility if they hype it the correct way.    the economic is at its lowest peak in decades but WM will offcourse do well as its wrestlemaniaaa!!! but den agen i dont think it will do as good as the previouse two wrestlemania'z.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	I agree, Jericho deserves a "real match" at 'Mania.  I mean, if you look at his wrestling resume, he's pretty much done it all.  He worked in different promotions in Canada with Edge, Christian, and Rhyno.  He then worked in Mexico, Jim Cornette's Smokey Mountain Wrestling, and then went on to ECW.  He competed in ECW until he got into WCW.  He stayed with WCW until 1999 when he left for WWE.  In each promotion, he topped the wrestlers and gained many championships.  So, yeah, Jericho deserves to have a "real match" at WrestleMania 25.    However, if WWE is going to have a match with Rourke at 'Mania, then Jericho is the showman that could give it to them.  As far as making Rourke look good, though, I don't think that could happen, Jerihco would have to do some major jobbing, something that he doesn't deserve to have to do.    As far as the economy, the Royal Rumble was sold out, remember.|`|1UKAho1iaa	I think Jericho can make Rourke look decent, but probably not good. If they want Rourke to look good, he should face HBK. He has a way of making every match he works look good, regardless of his opponent.  WQ: WM will do fine. I don't see the economic crisis having too much of an impact on it.
RuJYupFWaa	Couple buddies of mine have the Invert gear bag.  It's compact for a large bag but fits a ton of stuff.  Has a collapsible handle, like regular luggage so it's real easy to wheel around but that's becoming standard on a lot of these bags.    The NXe bag holds about the same amount of stuff but it's got bigger wheels on it, which is a nice touch since many fields have dirt or gravel staging areas, and bigger wheels can roll on that easier.  The Invert bag bounces around along gravel.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	get the roller it'll be easier for your mommy to take you home after you get spanked.|`|3yzYUbnYaa	I like hte NXe Executive Rolling Gear Bag better than the other one.
YPQTXOQ5aa	I think that Morris should be in the Hall of Fame. He was the best pitcher of the 80's. He threw the best World Series game in the Game 7 of the 1991 World Series. Was a key member of two World Championship teams.     In my book, he is a HOF. Hopefully the BBWAA sees the light on Morris.|`|AQmcZ0gYaa	For sure, and Bert Blylevin!!!|`|Nkwv2hygaa	Morris is getting increasing support thanks to steroid abusers like McGwire. He'll probably be in the same situation as Jim Rice.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	His wins are on par with Palmer, but his ERA isn't remotely close. He got great run support his whole career and played on great teams. If he got in the Hall he would have the highest ERA of any pitcher. 3.90 is way way too high for a HOFer. Jim Palmer played in the DH era as well and put up HOF numbers.     Hall of Good definitely, but not Hall of Fame.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Jack Morris was good. All-Star even. Hall of Fame? No. Not even close really. Stop trying to put players in that don't deserve it, or else rename the Hall of Fame, the Hall of Capable, Mediocre and a few really really good people.|`|rRlTtoylaa	He belongs in the "Hall of Very Good", not in the "Hall of Fame"!|`|yk4S7uuraa	He was definitely good, but not good enough for Cooperstown.|`|ov7wGdIEaa	Yes people forget about his world series performances.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Morris gets PLENTY of mention, far more than he merits.    No. Not Hall-class. The greatness is there for fans who really want to see it.|`|E6EyY1klaa	Yes, Jack Morris deserves to be in the HoF. There are MANY lesser pitchers than him who are in. His performance in game 7 of the '91 WS is one of the best pitching performances ever. And if you watched Morris pitch, you know that ERA is really not the average of what he seemed to give up per-game.|`|2wgEsVmsaa	Based on his being a post-season icon, I'd say yes. If the Hall of Fame were merely about stats -- and it has just about become that, alas -- he probably wouldn't go, but since the Hall is also about iconic prowess -- how else could you explain Reggie Jackson being there except for the home runs -- Black Jack should go.

4VoQduaZaa	I totally understand the feelings of those who think that IPL, and T20 in general, is killing the traditional form of cricket. If you are true cricketer, you should feel the same way.     But finally it's a sport. No sport will continue to exist if it is not enticing enough for spectators. Unfortunately for cricket, the spectators do not enjoy the test matches in most parts of the world. Even going to an ODI means being away from your usual work for the entire day. T20 is really gaining on that front since you get to watch it in the evening for three hours or so. I see more and more people getting attracted to this form of cricket just because they can enjoy without spending too much time on it.    More importantly, IPL has opened a source of revenue for many a small-time cricketers in India. Surely, the stars are making big bucks, but they will anyway make it .. if not today then tomorrow. Those who make cricket their career but never get enough sustainable income out of it .. they are now getting the benefits through IPL (and ICL as well). And being from India, I have seen the difference in the earnings of an international player and one who has played first class cricket for all his life. So we, the lovers of traditional cricket, may not like this new concept. But if it helps feed few families in a better way, then I am all for it.    On a personal level, I had dismissed it as nonsense before it had even started, but once the tourney got going, I was pulled in as everybody around me started cheering for franchise of my city - the Mumbai Indians. Players like Abhishek Nayar and Dhaval Kulkarni made their mark. Being from Mumbai, they were bound to do it .. if not in IPL then in Ranji trophy. But for players like Swapnil Asnodkar, IPL has really provided a platform. Who'd have known about this guy if he would have continued to play for Goa in Ranji plate league? That is where IPL is helping cricket.    IPL may be bad for those who love the game, but it is good for those who actually play it without much rewards otherwise.    And as long as question of grabbing more power is concerned, India will continue to do so as long as cricket continues to be a religion in sub-continent .. existence of IPL is not a big factor.|`|bbf096ad6f74d4fe631cb97301e1a43baa	The Mickey Mouse Cup.      Pillage the village, trash the scene  But better not take it out on me  Cause a ghost town is found  Where your city used to be  So out of the darkness and into the light  Sparks fly everywhere in sight  From my double barrel, 12 gauge,  Can't lock me in your cage    You see us coming  And you all together run for cover  We're taking over this town    Here we come reach for your gun  And you better listen well my friend, you see  Its been slow down below,  Aimed at you we're the cowboys from hell  Deed is done again, we've won  Ain't talking no tall tales friend  Cause high noon, your doom  Coming for you we're the cowboys from hell|`|AA11193511	generally very good answers.    the consensus seems to be that it isn't real cricket but at the same time it is what the spectators want and at the end of the day it is entertainment so who are we to say that cricket can only exist in its original format!    The fact that money seems to be the over-riding factor in all this is the galling part. you can't really blame the players for taking the cash - afterall it's on offer!! the only negative part of it all is that players are beginning to get a very high opinion of themselves because they may be able to slog a few sixes or take a couple of quick wickets!! thus becoming even more removed from reality (just like footballers).|`|bHheiqY6aa	I Love it and   not Hate it  Not bothered either way  It is Good for the spectator might be bad for the game|`|d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	I'm desperately under-interested in it...the IPL registers somewhere just below the level of the "Pro40" on my cricketing radar. I'm afraid I'm a county championship and test match cricket lover, the shorter the form of the game the less I'm interested, as the appeal of cricket to me is the mental battle between bowler and batsman. I admit to enjoying a tail-end slog as much as the next man, but when a whole innings is played in that vein I do wonder if it really is cricket or not.|`|3mMElwb0aa	First we have to ask is 20/20 cricket, or simply manufactured entertainment? I liken it to the 7's. Great spectacle for those not commonly at cricket, but for me, not something I'd stay home to watch or ever bother to see live.    I find it hard to watch great batsmen slogging across the line...batting like tailenders...    The IPL is a money franchise, nothing more.    It will ultimately destroy cricket as any player will be more keen to play less overs, less games, yet still make many hundreds of thousands of dollars.    Take McCullum - if he had a choice, NZ or continue to pull $800,000 US dollars for 6 weeks of IPL, what do you think?    So, in answer, I find it boring.    20/20 is nothing more than the America's Cup on land - billionaire owners having a moment of glory with their 'troops'.|`|J7oFxMI9aa	Oracle,    Frankly I dont know much about IPL. I watched some matches to see how Akhtar was doing ..the KKR matches.    I do not have any loyalty to any side , knowing fully well it is a commercial enterprise.    However, this is my point of view.     Mr Charu has presented an excellent overview from different perspective and after reading it I agree that  IPL has had contributions to world cricket especially bringing forth new talent to public view. In that it is successful.    Good job Mr Charu ! Thumbs up    Rehman of Multan    P>S: On the flip side IPL has almost annihilated Pakistan cricket, due to their storng arming the spineless ICC|`|cb9KqrUyaa	I do not like the idea of the IPL.As far as i am concerned cricket players should not be bought for millions of dollars,i see it is a waste of money and also it gad cause a lot of players to choose money over the love of cricket and their countries.So i guess you could say i Hate the ipl.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	I don't like it for several reasons which I have stated many times in this section. It is bad for cricket in general as it has caused dissension between players & their national teams, it takes away from test cricket. But the thing I hate most about it is that India is using it to grab even more power over cricket, & anyone who thinks differently is sadly mistaken.Players are coming back injured in some cases, & exhausted in most,all for the sake of a few quick dollars. I live in hopes that it will die a natural death.|`|8T0Z0Y17aa	I don't particularly like the way it is dominating world cricket to the extent it is. I feel it should be working to get more interested in the game and more interested in test cricket - the ulimate test for a cricketer, hence the name - as a result, test cricket should always be the highest and most dominant form of the game.    However, while the IPL is attracting the interest, it seems that some of the people associated with it want the IPL to be the highest form of the game. Also, as test matches are the ulimate test, together with the honour of playing for your country, they should take precedence if you ever have to make a decision between playing in the IPL or a test match - we have seen already that this though is not the case when the Sri Lankans pulled out of touring England.    I also do not like the way its greedy controllers have treated the ICL. It has been branded a 'rebel tournament' when it was there first - HOW CAN SOMETHING BE A REBEL TOURNAMENT IF THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT TO REBEL AGAINST WHEN IT WAS CONCEIVED? I don't see why ICL players have to be banned from international cricket just because the BCCI do not like them playing in a certain tournament. Oh sorry I do - the BCCI just wants to iradicate the competition to its tournament so it can make more money and because of the power it has, this has ICC backing.    Plus the standard isn't as good as most test matches    A choice between watching an England test match or watching the IPL FINAL - England test match everytime - even if it is a test V Bangladesh (I say that with all due respect)|`|f9hiPMDxaa	T20 reminds me of professional wrestling. It is sports entertainment with the emphasis on entertainment.|`|8yMkjeDdaa	Love it    good for the game.    some people hate cause its in india...if it was in any other country then it would have been fine.|`|AA11088802	Love it|`|8w9JZlaGaa	Love It  very much    few cricketers say that it is good to earn money  but truth is....   every one tries to give more then 100% in the matches  because every run fetches them more money, every wicket gives even more.  and if someone doesn't perform ,he is dropped ,and it leads to the big loss.  they have to be serious  money matters  and it results in an action packed thrilling tournament at the right time and  in the right season|`|gfxXikenaa	well i wonder why do people keep criticizing it . its a good showcase of cricket to attrack audience on a larger scale.  when T20 was started in England, huge crowds came into watch the games and a survey proved that 10% of them had never watched the game before.  66% people were below the age of 44,  so IPL is serving as the biggest platform for T20 for players from around  the world to show their skills and also earn handsomely.  young players get more opportunities and recognition~    i know traditional fans wont like it but as i said above "66% were under the age of 44" so it attracts younger fan base and which is very important to keep the game alive .    So my answer is its GOOD for the game and i enjoy it ~|`|af5d52fd49c3606b73f3d910229c8a9daa	It is definetly overrated.  The best thing about 20/20 is it will attract new fans to the game but it is a bit of a raffle.

QC2NozBkaa	The job a swivel dose, snap or otherwise, is to prevent line twist when using spoons and some spinners.  If you have ever trolled a spoon for awhile without one you'll know what I mean.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	don't use it on bass lures. it will interfere with the lure's best action. just tie a good knot. there are some very small wire snaps whose name escapes me right now. they come in a pkg of about 25. they will make it easier when changing lures and aren't so large as to adversely affect a lure's action except for some of the smaller topwaters. there are a few lures supplied with one of these.|`|nfCH7nkTaa	it saves your line from getting all twisted and making a mess in your reel|`|lECmz3SEaa	It doesnt not give you better lure action ,but allows for quicker change|`|RxTIzsyhaa	As redcore mentioned, it considerably cuts down on the true action of a' lure/plug, however on an In-line spinner one will be alright.

Otherwise tie a normal knot but don't pull it tight to the eye of the lure.  Leave a loop, don't have the knot right on the eye as this too reduces the action of the lure.  Unfortunately you can't do quick change overs.|`|DHmHn7Ldaa	quicker change but don't use them the fish can see them.
jLTDqVHsaa	The director just asks the camera operators to look for crowd shots, and if something looks decent, the director will call it up.    People are most certainly NOT asked in advance.

Although most I know of tend to show people who are considered good looking, especially cute girls, young children or quirky people. Those who might resemble Santa Claus, someone sleeping, dancing, or someone painted.

bwbWX85gaa	it just depends on the bodybuilder. every body builder has different training programs and techniques. im sure some bodybuilders do pullups and chinups but i think most of them probably wont. I would think most bodybuilders target one muscle group at one time versus many at one time, so that they dont get tired before they get a good workout in each muscle area.|`|UKX5NZ4maa	it depends on the bodybuilder but i'm inclined to think they don't. they get their resistance primarily from free weights and machines. i don't think the Olympia competitors would try them at their level.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	Pull ups and chin ups are only going to build muscle to a point because you're eventually going to start doing lots of them if  you do them consistently.  To build muscle, you have to do minimal reps with heavier weights.  Though I suppose if you were to add weights, like weight vests or ankle weights, you could to pull ups and chins ups with added weight to build some more muscle.  Probably not to the same extent as heavy lifting with free weights though.
9C6KvSAkaa	For the most part the Dodgers are a team made up a bunch of young impressionable guys, after this why would any of them go to Torre about anything. Who knows it might end up in book in a couple years...   He's under contract with us for two more years, why not wait until then to do this. I doubt its going to cause a distraction, but its still not cool.|`|xw13XqNaaa	Yes, but it will be a good distraction because if they don't sign Manny they will come up short again this season like the others.  They need to get rid of the GM now because the in-fighting will be the larger distraction.  I want to read Torre's book.  I've already seen some jiucy stuff he has said about the players.  That is one mean rigatoni!|`|AQmcZ0gYaa	Not a dodger fan, but they are proffesionals, so it shouldn't|`|AA10554783	No, It appears that there are so many scandals going on i'm waiting for the next one.|`|RJghPceKaa	i dont think it will|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	It will be a distraction in New York....not L.A.    Even if the L.A. writers wanted to make a big deal about it, there's only a handful of them compared to the armies of New York writers, talk show hosts and bloggers that are constantly trying to "out-hype" one another to stay alive.    All Torre has to say is "I had a wonderful time in New York and it was a great honor to manage the Yankees....but I'm in L.A. now and we have work to do."  And it'll end there.|`|R0sfdiNeaa	don't think it should affect them because not about the Dodgers, plus too many are making such a big deal out of this book I guess because it is about the Yankees|`|yk4S7uuraa	Why would it? Those guys are professionals, and whats in that book is gossip, and has nothing to do with the Dodgers.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Not at all. There's no controversy, really, just a bunch of reporters blowing everything out of proportion. Is it really a shock that Torre didn't like Arod. I mean it's not like they had a buddy-buddy relationship. (I particularly liked how he batted Arod 8th in the playoffs once. That was hilarious). It would be fun to see the Dodgers beat the Yankees in the World Series however. I'd like to see that once in my lifetime.|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	Torre is a big boy and can handle whatever comes his way, and I don't believe there is anything in the book that will distract any of the Dodger players.|`|Ty4Hdm2Haa	If it's going to be a distraction for anybody it will more likely be a distraction for the Yankees.  It already has Cashman all worked up.  The book is about the Yankee Years and those years have nothing to do with the Dodgers.  I don't see how this would impact the Dodgers in any way.|`|kY63tqmdaa	Not a Dodger or torre fan. Should not.|`|PxEsutQNaa	Why would it distract Dodgers players? They're benefiting from old Joe right now, whereas the Yankees are in his dog house. I think it will be pretty neutral in L.A.    However, in ultra-dramatized Yankee Land, there will be hysteria. Keep in mind that Torre allegedly made comments about the most high-profile players to pass through New York in the past decade, including Jeter, Posada, Sheffield, and, of course, A-Rod. Most of those players are still with the team. This book will be a major distraction for New York, especially if A-Rod is even slightly affected by it.    I don't believe that what Torre did was right. Wait until you're retired to release such a condemning book like that. The whole ordeal is unfortunate. However, I also believe that what the Yankees did to Torre was also extremely unfair. It's like a WWII pilot with his gunner: they need one another, but if they can't work together, the plane won't last very long.

iaMBgc6iaa	Good question, I see the same thing. I think mainly because rifles can be much more accurate. Also depending on which state you can only hunt with a certian caliber gun|`|N4t2t3dMaa	a shot gun does have the knock down power just dosent have the distance but most of the time people on TV are hunting fair game, they hunt down there target and more than likely the target will be out of shotgun range!!|`|85faaa69d9e3fef474608806f4554398aa	I've seen several shows where they've hunted with slug guns. Some states or areas are shotgun only. If you see any shows from Illinois they will be using shotguns or muzzle loaders. The Drury's have hunted with slug guns in Iowa. So have Lee and Tiffany Lakosky( not sure if I spelled that right). Watch enough shows and you'll see deer taken with slugs.|`|CFQbdDRNaa	Because they are not good enough to get close enough to use a shot gun....it's a TV show for heavens sake!|`|0f58b7ae62db5c245105e10b9c061d03aa	Some shows do occasionally. I think they avoid it for the most part for two reasons: It has to be extremely hard to get good video footage, and take a big game animal. It would be even harder if they had to limit their shots to shotgun range only. Second, slugs punch big holes, and most TV hunting shows try to minimize the blood and gore (as they should). You've probably noticed that when they are looking at the animal after the shot, you can sometimes see where they've wiped blood off, or they only show a close up of the head, rarely do you see the entry or exit wound. If they shot deer with slugs, they would be more limited on the obligatory 'hunter holding the trophy' and recounting the hunt shot.|`|COVwNYGVaa	Bows and rifles are more interesting/popular? I have never thought of it, good question. I see muzzleloaders more and more, but I don't think ever a shotgun.|`|AA12034449	I dont watch each and every hunting show on TV...But-    it always seems that those guys are hunting at a private ranch or some other place that just isnt public land most of the time.    Hunting down-state Michigan, south of the rifle line, would not make good TV... wading a cedar swamp, hunting from a ground blind, having to walk (for gods sake, walk!) instead of guided around in a ATV.... just not much glamor or media pizzz-AZ if ya know what I mean.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	actually, they do use slug guns time to time, your just not watching the right program, i've even see a child using a shotgun for his first whitetail, was he ever happy.  if you don't watch it enough, that's the reason you never see it.  they never use buckshot because most people believe it's too inaccurate to be used effectively on game, it's better to use a slug or a rifle.|`|QC2NozBkaa	There are some states and areas of states that dictate shotgun only because of population density.  The range of shogun slugs is much shorter than high powered rifle bullets; hundreds of yards verses many miles in some cases.  These semi-urban areas aren't the "real" woods and plains that most viewers are interested in.  Just my theory.|`|xOReEw6Waa	A lot of it comes down to marketing new rifles and cartridges. Someone introduces a new Model 70 you have to show it on TV to sell it. New Uber cartridge you want the folks to know it knocks down deer or elk. Shotguns for deer hunting just don't get the same glamor coverage. Now, they will sometimes show the slugs taking huge deer in shotgun only states to get people to pony up on hunting packages. Ever notice that even the hunts they show  out west are rarely on public land. I'm not being mean, it is just the marketing and buying machine at work.|`|rZmiyAqJaa	I've seen plenty of shows where they were using slug guns. It all depends on what they are looking to sell....|`|xcG5Tasiaa	Well, I'd venture to guess the camera crew following behind the hunter would mean he would need to be able to "reach out and touch" that deer, if you will.     Camera men can be notoriously loud.|`|4LsF70cjaa	A true hunter does not hunt just to kill.  The hunter is after meat for his table.  You do not shot gun a deer because A) a shot gun does not have the knock down power of a rifle and could cause needless suffering and B) the pellets would mangle the meat and render it inedible and C) you would have to get pretty close to use a shotgun in the first place.
LiOOF1Plaa	Cannondale CAAD9. It's the BEST aluminum frame they ever made, and it climbs like a crack-addicted mountain goat.....better than a Cervelo Soloist, Trek Madone, and Scott Carbon. Where else can you find a race bike for under $1000? Why? Stiff, stiff bottom bracket and even smoother stays, make this bike a turn-the-cranks and LUNGE FORWARD machine- and one of the best road bike buys ever. I tried them all, too. Just look at those perfect welds! The Cannondale is handmade in USA perfection. Read ALL the rave reviews on Competitive Cyclist...     The BEST thing is that this frame can be built-up to be a sub-16lb rocket ship, with full Dura Ace, Chorus, or Record gruppo!    EDIT: Try the Cannondale Synapse Carbon. It handles almost telepathically. Get one with Ultegra, or 105 gruppo at your budget. Great ride. The one I rode weighed only 15.3lb!|`|CttL3LmBaa	I just bought my first carbon fiber bike and it's not even on your list. After looking for 3 months I bought a left over 08 Orbea Opal with Campy for $2100.  Check out the Orbea Onix It was my second choice.     That said, if comfort is really your first concern, I test rode both Specialized machines and the Trek from your list, along with the Trek Madone 5.2.   If those were my choices the 5.2 is awesome but out of your price range (do you want to stretch it?).  The Madone 4.5 has a similar feel to the 5.2 so I would make it next.  The Specialized Roubaix didn't feel as responsive as the Madone and the Tarmac was too aggressive in geometry for me to be a good tourer.    Edit:  If you get the 5.2 Madone you have the only bike with a 90mm bottom bracket.  None stiffer, not even Cannondale.  Test ride before you buy and make your own judgment call.|`|VT1BSwFcaa	There are many bike comparisons on bike cycling reviews.  The Specialized gets my vote.

The 08 PMR = the 09 PMR.  Main difference is the 09 has an UltraLite frame, an item that's mostly preference.  It's got a different style trigger and the frame is contoured to fit a player's hand... but not every player's hand.  I personally think it feels too thin in my hands.  The board is similar as well.  It's got one extra tourney mode, big whoop.|`|LcqPFxNeaa	Proto Matrix Rail all the way. I have one and just love it. Its so easy to do maintenance on and just as light as the invert mini.

YjL6ziBtaa	Australian Open final has always come down to one single thing. Who is in the best shape.    If it is between Nadal and Federer--Nadal will win.|`|RC3WoqFkaa	federer. better hard court player. win in 4 or 5 sets|`|gP7IB2XCaa	i think roger will win. their head to head record is a little unfair because rafa rarely makes it to hard court finals with federer, so they dont play too much on hard. but roger makes it to clay finals...  the fast courts will help roger, but the heat will definately be an advantage to rafa because he seems really strong.  it would be a good match, but i'm rooting for verdasco :)|`|2oBV68RLaa	Nadal will win in straight sets. He will keep attacking Federer's backhand with deep topspin shots and then suddenly unleash his vicious inside-out (the best in the business). Rafa is always improving on hard courts. Federer is going to take a severe beating if they both make it to the finals, and this will be a big blow for him psychologically, especially since he feels he's on his way back to the top - no chance.|`|ZLPVUQ1caa	IMO it will depend on which Federer turns up. If the Federer who beat Del Potro turns up, it'll be over for Nadal in straights...if the Berdych one turns up it could be straights for Nadal.  While Nadal has looked the most assured throughout the tournament, anything can happen in the next two matches. Nadal didn't lose a set last year till he got routed by Tsonga. Murray didn't lose a set this year till he got beaten by Verdasco, a player he has never lost to.  Also, the AO has a habit of throwing in surprise finalists for a while now...so that could also happen.  Its going to be exciting to watch.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Rafa. If the courts are faster this year (though it's said that the Australian Open's surface is one of the slowest in all the HC tournaments) and Rafa's been playing much better than he did in previous years, what does that say about his eagerness to evolve even after becoming  1? Because as far as motivation goes...I see Fed wanting to retake the  1 spot and most of all match Sampras' 14 GS titles, but Rafa seems to want to, more than anything, just keep improving and enjoying his game. To me that's what's making the difference at the moment, that's why Rafa took his  1 ranking!|`|75ZMWlnnaa	ok, firstly lets break it down.    rafa has not lost a set so far, and is looking in very good form, he has improved his game on HC alot based on what i have seen so far this tournament. he is playing more inside the baseline rather than doing all the running 2-3 metres behind the baseline.    roger was pushed to the limit in 4th round by berdych, came back from 2 sets to 0 down, and then absolutely slaughtered del potro in the next match, he is playing good, but only good enough to get through his matches, i expect him to up the intensity for the SF and F.    i believe that IF BOTH rafa and roger get to the final, the match will mostly be decided by which federer shows up.    if the federer who played against del potro shows up, it will be a 4-set win for roger.    if the federer who played against berdych shows up, it will be a 4-set win for rafa.|`|AA12034105	Rafaaaaaaaaaaaaa !!!!|`|KF2yg9Ovaa	right now both players are doing great...but i think that if the roof is open nadal has the edge because he hasn't been pushed as much as federer has...however, fed has the experience on hard courts to win...it'll be an interesting match|`|5YPSyP91aa	when's the last time nadal was in the final of a hardcourt major? ever?    he owns federer because almost everytime they meet, they are on nadal's surface (clay).     final ans: fed will win, he is playing well right now...|`|AyQV6ZDiaa	When they both make it to the final, it will probably be very similar to the Wimbledon finals. It will be very closde, but Rafa will win because he has been playing his best tennis and he hasn't had any trouble with anybody he has played so far.    On the other hand, Fed seems to be much better on hard courts than Rafa in general, but he hasnt been at his best, especially in his last match. He will put up a fight and it will be a 5 setter, but Rafa will win.|`|OL7Uu8Foaa	if they both come than Federer wins|`|SDNjTs0Haa	Before this open started I would have said Fed but Nadal has won straight sets in all his matchs and played amazingly  So, this year I think it could be Nadal's turn to win on hard court  I think that time off last year did him some good!  xx|`|91b7280fd9803a425ab46749a96ff39aaa	Nadal, I think. He hasn't had any problems yet, not a set lost, he hasn't played longer matches.... I think he should win.  Federer is always a tough competition and it really depends on how he's gonna play that day coz if he's gonna start the match like he did the one with Berdych...  Well, we'll see, the finals are definitely gonna be very interesting...|`|LKVTY2EPaa	Nadal has changed his forehand for hardcourts and has been executing it beautifully. He hasn't lost a set yet and has been flawless. I think Nadal will be the victor at this years Aussie Open. He's on a different level than the other players right now.|`|AiowugX2aa	roger federer,you just can't wish away 8 grand slams on hard courts plus his physical strength and ability to withstand the stress of the australian sun

For anyone who doesn't know what banter is, well basically, you rip and take the micky out of your opponents using big serves and penetrating volleys (in Barney and Hendogs case) so that your opponent cannot come back with anything. So I enjoy competing in singles because it is serious stuff but doubles is fun and I love the banter! x|`|cISlJr8xaa	Singles I like to have the court to myself...|`|Wjp0niEhaa	They are very different in my opinion.  I don't mind doubles, but like singles more because you just get to hit more balls in singles, you get a better workout, and you have no one to blame but yourself.  I think the quality of tennis is more important a question.  A quality doubles match is more fun than me whipping some poor guy at singles.  And a good singles match is more fun than a doubles match, where I am the weakest link!  I just love tennis; singles, doubles, ball machine, or the wall... the day just isn't complete without smacking a few balls.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	both , both have their high ponis|`|HFqiY6BGaa	Doubles because even though i lose when i play dubs ALOT!  its more fun|`|e26a6d1bc492d2de7a8edcc3478c5300aa	Doubles is cool if you are in the match.

aQcsrgLCaa	The Cycling Tourist Club (CTC) might be a good place to start.    Youth hostels usually have facilities for cycles.  Many of the cycling magazines give routes for training, pleasure or adventure and they often mention places to stay.    Other ideas might be Sustran, local tourist info in the area you might want to stay, websites for the county/town/city in which you might want to stay or a cycling website forum (like Cycling plus) where you could appeal for info.    Even on this forum you might be better off by suggesting an area in which you want to stay.|`|I3CNklLKaa	Do you mean a place where, when you get there they already have bicycles, or a place that you can take bicycles to?|`|8gMhcDIRaa	what an odd question...    im sorry i cant help but you made my day :)
FvVExt7Laa	In long jump. when you jump you land on your feet and try to fall forward, instead of backwards onto you butt, because it will be the measuring point.  Oh, and when they measure, they start from the plank you step to jump on.  So try to step at least 0.5 cm away from the plank itself. Stretch your feet as forward as you can, and try to land forward as well, so that they measure where your feet land.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Try to land softly on your feet, letting your knees collapse to absorb any remaining forward motion.  You want to move forward, but  you don't want a lot of energy left in the jump.  The measurement is from the closest point to the take off board, regardless of where your feet landed, so if  you fall back or place your hands behind you that is where they measure.  If you stand up and step back it is from where you stepped back.|`|AA11425571	You land on your feet and try not to land on your butt. If you watch the professionals do it, it looks like they land on their butts but they are really landing on their feet with their feet far in front of them. The momentum keeps them moving, causing them to not land on their butts.    Bottom line, land on your feet and prevent butt pain.|`|Mya9LUxuaa	You want to land on your feet with them far in front of you like a frog.  They measure from the farthest point to the back of your landing, should be the back of your foot.|`|mnGOsAVVaa	The goal of long jump (or triple jump) is to be the jumper with the furthest distance from the board (or take off point).  In the initial jump, the jumper pulls their legs up to a piked position (like when you try to touch your toes) and jumps out towards the pit (or sand box).  Studies have shown that when a jumper lowers their legs to land, it slows momentum, or the legs act as a brake to the forward motion.  If you've ever ridden a bike and the kickstand has come down on you while you're pedaling, it's a lot like this.    Additionally, the are several small, delicate tendons and ligaments in your knees that can be irreparably damaged if you jar your knee or land stiff legged.  This often happens when a jumper hits the divot of a previous jumper and lands stiff legged.      Ideally, a jumper will land with his torso leading his body, arms up and back, and legs back.  When in the air and close to landing, the jumper will throw his limps forward and contract his abs to create a last-chance throw for forward momentum.  This often will be seen as jumpers landing on their side or thighs as their abs twist in the air.      A common error when landing with your legs down and on your feet is that you will a) jar your knee, or b) fall backwards.  When your legs are 44 inches long like mine are, that is a huge deficit in your jump.    A true competitor would rather eat a mouthful of sand than fall back on his butt and eat a mouthful of crow.
KoJ0rddfaa	i've heard many times to run backwards up hills to get faster. developes strong mussels and harder to run backwards so makes easier to run forwards. this is what my english teacher did last year! haha.    although fro cross country we ran up this huge hill as fast as we could, in different increments. we would start at bottom then sprint a 1/4 of it, then job down. then sprint to the half way mark, then jog down. then sprint to 3/4 mark then jog down. then finally sprint all the way to the top, and we got to walk down, take a break and repeat. it can be HELL, but it really does work. and coaches know what they are talking about...as much as we can hate the work, it pays off. i am very slow and this actually helped me get speed. at beginning and end of cross country race you need that speed! and i know what your thinking..cross country it's different...well...the track team did this too a few times! haha, so i say go for it.      also, train by running double your distance that you will be competeing in/racing/ what ever. it does pay off.  and before you know it your 1 mile time will improve since it will feel easier now that you are getting faster and used to running 2 miles.    you could go ahead and run many miles a day to prepare for one mile, but i would stick to just 2. you dont want to tire yourself out too much before tryouts. (:    goodluck.|`|TKNPveHDaa	Those are good ideas, but that won't help drop your mile time as much as running 1-2 miles.  Go out and learn to complete the entire mile.  Jog the first part to warm up, speed up for the second part, and run the third part hard.  Do that 3-4 times a week over the next two weeks and you'll see an improvement.    Always do at LEAST the distance you need to run to train and get better.  Running 2-3 miles will help you even more.|`|ymrkxCGdaa	You'll improve, but probably not as much as you think you will. I was never a competitive runner, and my mile time used to be 7:20. I started doing distance running for track, running between three and five miles a day, and got my mile down to 5:50 in a few weeks. Best way to improve your mile time is to run a few miles daily.

NRs72Afxaa	1. I would make Randy Ortan the winner since he won the Roral Rumble.    2. I'm sort of predicting a Triple H vs Edge match, but cards can change you know.    3. Jack Swagger vs Evan Bourne is a dream match. I think Evan Bourne should go over since its WM.    4. Wouldn't be surprised, but Mickey Rouke would get a good match from Chris Jericho.    5.

Nothing against Tom Brady, as he's already assured his place in history, however, I am sure that NO NFL team prepares for a season based upon the health of the New England Patriots QB.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	How do you know that report is true? Just recently reports said that he would miss the entire next season. They're intentionally circulating conflicting stories, to, among many other things, increase Matt Cassel's trade value. It's a pretty typical strategy, but it's huge news because Brady is such an important player.     Don't believe ANYTHING you hear about him until around Training Camp, maybe even later.|`|a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	100% from a structural stand point for the knee joint.

Not even two weeks ago the organization stated that he would need at least two more surgeries and would not be ready until sometime during the season.

rRlTtoylaa	No one in the hall of fame should be considered underrated.  After all someone thought they were great.  My choice would be Gil Hodges.  He was truly a great player for the old Brooklyn Dodgers but more importantly a great man.  Check his stats, they were HOF numbers.    I agree with the person who mentioned Roger Maris.  His numbers may not have been HOF numbers but he was a great right fielder with one of the greatest arms in baseball history.  He never got credit for anything, even when he hit 61 home runs to break Ruth's record.  Very sad.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	I have to say Ernie Banks, nobody says his name enough|`|5EuOTAjJaa	Easy. It would have to be Gil McDougal.  He could play Gold Glove type fielding at three infield positions. SS, 3rd base and 2nd. base.  He was a vital part of Casey Stengel's run of five consecutive World Series Championships.  Plus, he could hit a little.|`|NG6eeCfuaa	I can't speak for history as I'm not as old as time, however, I'd say that Andy Van Slyke might be the most underrated player ever in the past 30 years. He was a Hall of Fame calibur CF and had a better than average bat. He just happened to be overshadowed by his teammates in Pittsburgh and St. Louis. But who remembers him? Probably everybody who reads this is going to be like "Andy Van who"???|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	Ron Santo.   Still can't get into the HOF with better numbers than Brooks Robinson.|`|Nkwv2hygaa	Stan Musial|`|zdQgOzYXaa	With this question being asked everyday, the most underrated players will soon become the most overrated!|`|w5sK75MPaa	I do know who Van Slyke in Pittsburgh. They had a great team to watch with Bonds,Bonillia,& Spanky. Id say he is underrated but I don't think he belongs in the HOF.   My answer is Andre Dawson. And I do think he belongs in the Hall & hope he makes it someday.|`|DSJOxz0Qaa	For his time, I would say Vince Coleman (and yes he played with Van Slyke in St Louis).  The guy could hit for average, steal bases and was an excellent outfielder.  He wasn't really given the credit for the Cards Championship years.|`|RAjycr4waa	Ted Williams. He missed a huge chunk of his prime to the war and came back and continued to dominate. People only look at numbers but he was the man.|`|Cp9aSL8haa	Roger Maris.    Broke the single-season homerun record, and never got the credit he deserved.|`|9ca8b7d729f1dd36f9ae8ae25a34b9ccaa	Yogi Berra would be my choice.  Always remember something that Casey Stengel said about him...without him they would have not been anything.  It brings to mind Reggie's quote "the straw that stirs the drink"...well I truly feel that Yogi was that for the Yankees of that time.  He was around a long time and right in the middle of it from what(?) late 40's to the 60's...even took time out to serve and participate in the Normandy Invasion during WWII...."if you come to a crossroad...take it, he once said"..."well it seems that he always seem to take the right(correct) one.!".....Yogi Berra would be my pick!...."one of the best bad ball hitters ever" but he always seem to hit them when it counted!|`|YPQTXOQ5aa	I am going to say Frank Tanana, who pitched for the Angels and Tigers. He won over 200 games, but was two different pitchers. The first part of his career he was a flame thrower and then hurt his arm. Then the last half of his career, he was a junkballer, but still won. Never got the respect from fans and writers about his career|`|32GwiKLtaa	ted williams...he gets credit, but not far enough. he was the greatest hitter in baseball, and when i say that, i mean it. better than babe, better than gehrig, better than anyone. he is still the only player in baseball history to finish a season with a batting average of over .400...he deserves more recognition|`|vuh0i3Axaa	george brett|`|H8VDpcV3aa	I'm going to say Dom DiMaggio, It's been said he was a better center fielder than his brother Joe. But was always in his shadow. No one thought he would make it because he wore glasses. He went from the sand lots of San Francisco right to AAA (San Francisco Seals). He only played 10 seasons because he served in World War 2. He had a career batting avg. of .298. he averaged over 100 runs scored per season. Was a 7 time allstar. Also it has been said that he was a better fielder than Willie Mays but Mays was easily a better all around player. He would play very shallow in the out field and would go back on a ball better than any outfielder and in on a ball with the best of infielders. He also played in the shadow of Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, and Jimmie Fox.  There are many veteran players who say he belongs in the Hall of Fame. Very smart player did everything right.|`|zfadjiJVaa	Ted Williams|`|hXeeg3pgaa	Tim Raines
AA11016927	The first "angling for sport" is from Europe circa early 1800's; mainly Scotland, England and Ireland.     The aristocracy of the times, (Kings & Queens), had the available money to purchase lines made from silk and Mooching-type reels and rods. Shortly, Fly-fishing was invented and was the RAGE.    By the mid/late-1800's Fly-fishing became a very popular "gentleman's sport" in Europe and through-out the US.     By the early 1900's, company's began popping up trying to invent an easier to use and more productive "common mans" reel and rod system. That is where the original bait-caster's come from.    The reason they were called "bait-caster's" is (duh) they were commonly used to "cast baits" instead of Fly's. In the Early 1900's many "gentlemen fishermen" looked down their noses at anyone who used bait-caster's because it took very little "skill" to simply cast a line out and wait for a bite.      Anyway, you can attribute most "angling for sport" to Fly-fishing & Mooching.|`|CFQbdDRNaa	This is a dumb question....Maybe adam and eve were down by the river and saw a fish and said:There's something...lets eat it!|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	I'd guess salmon or some sort of fish that spawns in masses like that was the first to be "fished".  They were probably diverted to traps or enclosures when they could be easily caught en route to their spawning grounds.|`|PvSGrtzJaa	You have 3 " Top Contributor's" answering. Trust there answers.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	l would say it was started by either ancient chinese or egyptians several thousand years ago. there are pictographs of both cultures catching fish with a pole of some sort (not a loomis) but the chinese probably had the better of it with their silk lines. and most likely freshwater for sport fishing.
9hC7bbf7aa	Depends on how seriously injured. Chronic meaning you have not given enough time for your wrist to heal properly each time before lifting the racket. Also when the wrist feels better, start doing some muscle strengthening exercises, but you can't do it during an acute inflammatory stage. Many players have to enter tournaments w/ ailing tendinitis. If you can avoid playing for a while and wear a wrist wrap during your normal daily activities too. Think about it as a broken bone, except you have broken soft tissues, vessels, or ligaments...They too require proper healing time of months. Try to stay away from tennis for a month see how you progress ? There's no magic time formula, for every injury is different on its severity and so on. Alrighty ? Take it easy :):}|`|bC2ILdqOaa	put it on ice, and try not to use it much|`|lEWuugaFaa	depends, if you are feeling numbness in your hand then you could have damaged the nerve in which case you should immobilize it at night and stop tennis until the numbness goes away.  If your wrist is not numb then its most likely that it may be unused to so much action.  If this is the case then i would suggest that you keep playing with a wrist strap so that you can help support your wrist while it builds up more muscle|`|Xo8XZVGbaa	Stop masturbating|`|BfmV2KpUaa	Give it a rest for a few days as you're probably straining the tendons. Continuing might cause tearing and calcification and then you will have problems.    I hope you're also doing at least 15 minutes of warm-up exercises and stretches before playing.|`|pwejv6jpaa	see a doctor|`|Wjp0niEhaa	A wrist wrap should help.  Take a few weeks off to let it heal.  You might be snapping your wrist too much during your stroke.  You may need to correct your form, with the help of an instructor, to prevent further damage/injury.  You may even be using too heavy a racquet, or too small a grip size.  Small grips are harder on the wrist.  You should also strengthen your grip and forearm through weight training and grip strengthening exercises.  Good luck!|`|AA11510511	Stop playing tennis.  That's what I would do.|`|Oz0JMbOoaa	you cant fix a tennis injury with more tennis, thats like drinking acid to stop an acid burn. probably ice of heat(whichever you prefer) and stop playing for a while|`|af3618c3c438b0c88538a888bf12f6b8aa	Never exercise through pain.  Time out from tennis until your wrist is better.    Try alternate icing and heat wrap with ace bandage.  If it does not improve, see a doctor.  When it does improve, try tennis again and see if you can tolerate it.  Good Luck.

Are you asking:     1) Martial arts that have been used in war?    2) Martial arts that are used in training military men now?    3) ......    You see what i mean it is hard to tell what you are asking.      Historically, The Korean Rock Marines where the only military force (The White Horse and the Tiger Divisions ) used Tae-Kwon-Do successfully in Vietnam, during the war.    NOTE: the TKD they do is nothing like the Shake-And Bake TKD taught in the U.S.A most of the time.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	tkd is the only one that came from the Korean military.    i know some one is going to say krav maga but this is not martial arts it is a self defense course.|`|sj902Wyuaa	Taekwondo was used by the korean millitaries    Karate, okinawa|`|009wtvVeaa	all different kinds, i think the us army is starting to use bjj.

The weapons in kung fu have long histories as military weapons. The empty hand techniques in kung fu are for efficient killing or disabling of opponents in as few moves as possible.     Just imagine a scenario of 2 armies charging at each other. The initial attack is with longer range weapons (bows and arrows and long lances). As the fight goes on, the proximity of the fighters become tighter and tighter. You must get rid of enemies in short order because you don't have infinite endurance plus they are all around you. Kung fu and warrior training were one and the same in many instances.    The ROK (Republic of Korea) Marines are some of the toughest in the world. All of them are TKD black belts. But modern weapons training (artillery, rifles, bombs, etc.) is not part of TKD. Krav Maga incorporates modern weapons into fighting tactics but there is no Krav Maga way of the warrior.|`|wrS5nguKaa	Actually most people that have said Tae Kwon Do have no idea what they are talking about.

Krav Mcgrav (spelling) is the Isrealie Military Arts, but differnt than the commercial one, because there are things they are not allowed to show civilians for liability reasons,     Kajukenbo and Kenpo have been used in a few law enfocrement and military hand-to-hand combat classes.    I know the Los County Sherriff Station in the City of Industry, CA some deputies train in Okinowian Kempo a more hard style Japanese base system different than American Kenpo.

Jujitsu/BJJ is one along with other styles.    Kajukenbo wasn't actually formed for or by the military, but it was formed for civilian street defense.

obPSaYf3aa	It's basically a matter of balance and the center of gravity in relation to the shape of a bowling ball's core.  I'm not heavy into the physics and technical aspects of the bowling ball where center of gravity and balance based upon how it's drilled, but can tell you these different exotic drilling patterns and how they affect the way my bowling ball reacts.  For example:    Elite PBA Platinum, Brunswick Ultimate Inferno & Hammer Black Widow Venom:  Drilled semi/relaxed fingertip grip with the pin below the ring finger (right handed).  Reaction is where I get "full roller" reaction with adequate side rotation and the track (where the ball meets the lane) shows it rotates outside all three of the holes.  It gives these bowling balls the maximum rotation, enough torque and maximizes the hook ratings.  I can go "coast to coast" with this drilling.      Elite PBA Chameleon, Morich Awesome Finish, Elite PBA Cheetah, Brunswick Red Zone:  Drilled full fingertip grip with the pin in the palm (RICO) drilling for more control over how I release the ball, provides side rotation and much like a spinner delivery where if I see my thumb hole stationary while the ball rolls down the lane and I use it for playing the "outside" with a straighter trajectory and a aggressive finish into the pocket.    Many bowling ball manufacturers have the cores in various shapes with various aggressive or tame coverstocks enclosing them.  There are also "pro pin" or "x-out" bowling balls where the length of the "pin" (end piece of the core protruding into the coverstock) determines how it will react, no matter the location of the center of gravity.  If you want to see how placement of the holes and pin can determine how the ball will react, Brunswick Bowling has an extensive collection of "drill sheets" showing how each will affect the performance.|`|czNUMFdWaa	ABSOLUTELY!      Today's equipment is very sophisticated.  There are many different coverstocks and weight blocks in many different combinations.  There are four things that you can start researching.  Pin Placement, CG (Center of Gravity), Mass Bias, and Positive Axis Point (PAP).  The simplest of these to look for on a bowling ball is the Pin.  This is usually a noticable colored dot on the ball.  The placement of this in relation to the finger holes will usually indicate what shape the ball will form on the lanes.  If the pin is above the fingers, the ball will tend to go longer and if the pin is below the fingers, that same ball would tend to hook sooner.  From there, there are a gazillion different combinations that would affect how the ball rolls.    To address whether it will especially affect the hook on the ball, Coverstock probably has more direct effect on hook than layout (drilling) does.  A pearlized reactive ball will hook less than a dull particle ball will.  The trick is to purchase a ball that has the most natural characteristics that match up with your individual game and the condition that you will be bowling on.    In other words, coverstock is the biggest determining factor on hook and layouts "tweak" the characteristics of the ball to better suit your game and style.    Ball layout can become very complex and I could write a short novel here but hopefully this helps to get you started.      Seek out an IBSIA certified pro shop in your area and they'll be able to go into more detail and actually show you what I'm talking about here.|`|teSCVfRoaa	Yes, the pro shop will help you with any questions when you take it to be drilled. It can be drilled for a righty or lefty. It can help you control your curve. It can be drilled for a finger tip grip or a semi-finger tip grip, or a full finger grip.

A stupid RKO that can be blocked by pushing him when his in mid air.    Did you ever think that the wrestlers use the move sets that are given to them by the WWE writers? I mean, Batista and Cena could do chokeslams, tombstone pile drivers, RKO's, you name it, but because they are signature moves, they dont.

mMFJrPbvaa	I would rent gear until you are sure you want to invest in the sport, almost every rock gym rents out shoes and harnesses.  Once you come to the decision that you are dedicated to it I would first buy climbing shoes and use the gyms harness, since you are climbing indoors.  Once it warms up and if you are interested in climbing outdoors then get a helmet and a harness.  But for your lessons rental gear is just fine, or buy the shoes and wait on the harness.|`|AA10895669	Don't wear normal sneakers, rent a pair of rock shoes there, (if your worried about wearing shoes that others have worn, you can purchase a disinfectant spray and squirt the insides before you put them on, and/or wear a thin pair of nylon or poly socks.) Sneakers will not provide you with the proper grip you need to stand on the holds and thus making a good time learning a real bother. If after a few classes your really interested in the sport, then you can go out and purchase the gear you need. It is a smart Idea to rent before you buy, some gyms have gear shops at them and will treat you very well if they know you are just getting into the sport.    have fun|`|1njsqy0laa	Beach Bum is right. Climbing is a lot of fun, but the gear is expensive. It's pointless to get a harness and shoes if this is not a sport you really want to get into. Rent gear until you are sure you want to keep it up. There is no harm in waiting until you're sure. Also keep in mind that used climbing gear is very difficult to sell.    If you decide that you want to get the gear, buy a harness and a pair of climbing shoes that works for you. Try not to have cost much of a factor. You will be wearing the harness and using the shoes for countless climbs - it's worth spending the extra $20 to be comfortable.     I bought my first harness many years ago - A Mammut. I've been using that harness since and have easily spent 1,000 hours in it. That comes down to just pennies per hour - if the harness you want it $80 and you don't like the others - get it.    Shoes are a little different. You'll need to try them out in person. Don't by online. Shoe size, fit, and type are all very personal. Your street shoe size is just a reference. My street shoe size is 11.5, I use 9.5 climbing shoes. Ask a sales associate at a Sporting Goods store to help you find what works for you. The same advice goes for shoes - get what you like. If you get the shoes you want you'll be happy with them and use them for many months (a pair for me lasts about 6 months, but I climb 5 days a week). If you get a cheaper pair that isn't as comfortable your feet will ache and you won't want to climb as much.|`|A5V4jsfaaa	Try a place like your local REI.|`|1I38E3XQaa	start with a chalk bag, then shoes then a harness|`|2eW7U8FQaa	I recently started rock climbing about a month ago i would suggest that you use their shoes and also just wear light trainers with good grip. Then if you like it after a couple of weeks maybe buy your own shoes as what is the point in getting shoes and a harness that might cost you somewhere in the region of 100 when you quite after the first few weeks. Only buy the equipment when you know that your going to persevere with the sport. Good luck

DHIudHy2aa	I would just buy the $300 one. You don't need a bayonet at all, and the open sites are really good on them so a scope isn't totally necessary. For the ammunition, you could probably find some mil-surp for cheap, but those can only be used for target shooting. Ammo for hunting is what your seeing with the $30 for 20 deal.|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	If you want cheap ammo .303 isn't a great choice.  The only surplus that's left has been sitting in hot warehouses in places like Pakistan and South Africa for decades and is in bad shape.  It's an obsolete caliber and the only reason they still make any ammo for it is there are so many Enfields in civilian hands.      I would not pay 500 for a sporterised gun.  They only had Holland and Holland put a scope mount on a few rifles for snipers.  That's not what you are getting.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	Those prices suck.  I am assuming that you are talking about a Lee-Enfield of some sort.  They are going for under $150 for a shootable one at Century Arms right now.  That should translate to under $200 for non-C&R FFL people at a local store.  For $300, I can go down to my local gun store and buy one in excellent shape with all the bells and whistles.  Also, if it is sporterized (somebody put a scope on it, or cut the wood down), don't pay more than $200 for it.  It is chopped, and only has value a shooter.  Not as a collectible.  Look online for Seller and Bellot ammo at several of the websites that sell it.  It shouldn't go for more than $15/20.  And if you do get a Lee-Enfield, it would be an excellent time to get into reloading.|`|wdR8pPH3aa	What kind of Enfields are they?    I got a US Made Savage for 250$ in decent shape with a good bore.    The Canadian Long Branch's are nicer than the Savages and the one's from the UK are even more money.    Make sure that the rifle you pick has a bright bore. The Enfields were issued in the times when they used corrosive ammo so that's what I would look for over a scope or anything else.    I would skip the scope if I were you. The Enfield shoots pretty good with iron sights and is quicker to get on target.    If the bore is good and the rifle isn't an Ishapore (Indian) then 300 is pretty decent.|`|3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	Wow, that seems steep.

plTYZU85aa	To start there is 3 divisions in each conference, with 5 teams each, There are 2 conferences, east and west. Then every team plays 82 games, then the 8 teams with the best records in each conference play in the playoffs. The 8 teams that make the playoffs from each conference are ranked 1-8 depending on the record, so out of the 8 teams the one with the best record is ranked 1, and the 2nd best record is ranked  2 and so on. in the first round, the  1 ranked team in a conference plays the  8 ranked team, and 2 and 7 play, then 3 and 6, then 4 and 5.The four winners advance to the second round, or Conference Semifinals, with a match-up between the 1-8 and 4-5 winners and a match-up between the 2-7 and 3-6 winners.At the conclusion of the NBA Playoffs the winners of these series advance to the Conference Finals.  Each round is a best-of-seven series.Series are played in a 2-2-1-1-1 format, meaning the team with home-court advantage hosts games 1, 2, 5 and 7, while their opponent hosts games 3, 4, and 6, with games 5-7 being played if needed. The NBA Finals are played in a 2-3-2 format, meaning the team with home-court advantage hosts games 1, 2, 6 and 7, and their opponent hosts games 3, 4 and 5.

Dealing with a good shop - with people you like is more important than an actual brand.  Bikes are that close in nature now that the real choice is service from your shop.  Google Trek, Giant, Specialized, Cannondale, Fuji, Bianchi and Felt (Just off the top of my head. Other answers will have some more brands, I am sure.) and see what is sold in your local.

SPleGlS1aa	A Class III license is a term for a license to be a dealer of NFA weapons.  Owning NFA weapons does not require a license in the U.S.  You have to live in a state that allows the type of weapon you wish to own (about 38 states allow machine guns, over 40 allow silencers but some states have special restrictions).    To purchase an NFA weapon once you find one you want you complete an ATF Form 4 in duplicate, 2 fingerprint cards, and a certificate of compliance.  You mail all that in to the ATF with a check for $200.00 ($5.00 for an AOW) and after about 30 to 90 days the ATF will mail an approveved form to the seller and you can pick up the weapon and form.  The form is a registration form that shows the transfer tax has been paid. The dealer will help you with the forms.  Also, if you are buying the item from an individual who is a resident of the same state as you, you do not need to go through a dealer, but you have to do the same paperwork.|`|qMhLcn8Gaa	Class III firearms license    http://www.letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=...
7E7HzYrRaa	yeh all of his kid fans will cry like little babies!|`|bdbf5eadab8ce0b8a809dd4d79141bafaa	Mark my words... at WM 25 I believe Cena will turn heel against Orton... the way the whole storyline with McMahon and Orton is turning out... people are sick of Cena being a face...|`|rknbEJkzaa	Yeah, duh.|`|3icTrKLLaa	I think many people are sick and tired of John Cena, period. Personally I don't mind him. He is a big draw for the company and is slowly improving.     Even if WWE wanted to change Cena back to being heel, i don't know if they could. He is still way too over as a face, and right now i just couldn't think of a possible storyline to have for it to happen.|`|DRPhJnXzaa	nope , not yet anyways|`|T13xM9iJaa	Even though I'm a fan of his I am I would be REALLY HAPPY if he did turn heel|`|4tvI9WYjaa	he should go back to his rapper gimmick when he was on smack down that was better. plus im not hating on him but what happen if john cena went to tna ?|`|7f2GSDmqaa	People want to see him turn heel, then half his fanbase who are still watching today that were there during his heel days will re-support him|`|Pne371ESaa	I am a fan of Cena but he needs to turn heel. he was a great heel and he showed that he could be a good heel when he beat the **** out of Jericho after Survivor Series. this is what i want to happen when Batista comes back as a face and says he wants to fight Cena for the title, then Cena comes from the back and looks like he is greeting Batista back then he hits him with brass knucks and procedes to beat the **** out of batista and let Orton come down and punt him again leading to a real Batista vs. Cena feud with Cena the heel.|`|pmjOiQFvaa	i reli cba anymore it doesnt really matter now and dnt expect a heel turn if there was this could prove fata to wwe'z merchandise sales as cena is der top box office draw in everything from movies to music to main eventing wrestlemania to merchandise etc.|`|GKJV2EBSaa	Lots of people are but im not.John Cena will always be face because he has a lot of kids in his fan base.If he turns heel then he's going to lose a lot of fans and the wwe is going to lose a lot of profit.(Think about it,a lot of his fans[kids] buy his merchandise and turning heel will drop sales and i don't think Vince would let that happen)Sad but true,its all about the money.|`|1UKAho1iaa	I am. It gets annoying when one person is a face for an extended period of time, especially when it's clear that more than half the fans hate him.|`|KghV0ahqaa	I think while he may not be great in the ring, he always puts forth maximum effort and he seems to be a generally nice guy in real life. WWE will not turn him heel because last year his merchandise sold more than any superstars ever execpt for Austin's top years. Yes, that means he has sold more merchandise last year than hogan ever sold in  1 year.|`|FGmEoXw9aa	Yea, he's like the Hogan of this generation, and thats what I think he wants to be. "I am a real America. Fight for you're Rights" Dadadadadum Dum Dadadum When it comes crashing down and it hurts too much, dadadumdum dadaddum, When you hurt my friend."|`|QoA9v1LGaa	lol i know i am, he's been face his whole career.|`|l3AZzVfMaa	I'm not really tired of John Cena as a face, I think I'm just tired of the whole John Vs JBL Vs Michaels ordeal. Its like they all three fight each other every week and its getting kind of old. I'm waiting on him to fight someone new because the story line is too dragged along. I know its all for WM 25 but can we see Cena fight someone new for a change?!?|`|lTlaNwtgaa	i hated him ever sence he showed up in wwe|`|2kVmQWF0aa	I've been sick and tired of john cena for a while but he will stay because kids love him-yuck no wonder why i hate him so much.|`|wosSPy0Taa	yea but WWE wont make him turn heel because of business reasons|`|TAPBWPJLaa	I think people are just sick of John Cena in general.    For the most part, I don't mind him. Despite that, No matter who the top face is, people will b*tch and complain about them.|`|770573c4f38cca3bd501e926925bcf9baa	not really a big fan of him but he does a good job at being the guy that does the right thing most of his fans might be young kids but that's what i kinda like about him kids cheer older fans boo he's old school corny wwe like hogan when he was on his run the Deference now is everyone wants there hero's to have a edge or carrie alot of baggage like j hardy.  he needs to stay a face|`|lFgkoLmmaa	Does anyone remember when Hogan turned heel? That was the first time I ever saw fans trowing massive amounts of trash and drinks into the ring, kids crying(that weren't planted there), and it was really great. I mean I can't compare Cena to Hogan but I would imagine a similar reaction and think it'd be great, but I could see parents not letting their kids watch anymore because they're kids were heartbroken, I think with Hogan the fans were more mature and understood the reality of it all.|`|ZSchvX1Yaa	NO !  well im not lol.  Hes my fave superstar and just simpy the best|`|2cH8JeVNaa	Yes, but they can't turn him heel, because most of Cena's fans are 12 years old. They want the little people to stay interested, because they're the future of the buisness (watching, competing, etc.). That's my guess, at least. Hope I helped. :)

BiMkowVMaa	It's just an award. Out of the last 10 MVP winners only 2 have won a championship.    Based on regular season play LeBron is the leader right now in the MVP race.    Look it up the Lakers had the third best record in the Western Conference (14 games above .500) before Bynum went down with an injury. The Lakers were already a good team. Gasol just put them over the top. You remove:    Wade  LeBron  Chris Paul  Tim Duncan  Dwight Howard from their respective teams and you'd have the same effect.|`|i5MInqeMaa	Gasol has 1 bad game and you wanna say it's all kobe. LOL.  How many times have kobe had sub par games and gasol and the supporting cast carried him?  Many times.  Kobe has had som average games and the Lakers have blown teams out.  Gasol has 1 bad game and you wanna say it's all kobe.  Get some more facts to back that up.  When Gasol came to the Lakers last year you guys got the best record in the west and nBa finals.  That's with Gasol.  You guys have the best record in the west because of gasol and the deep bench players you have as well as bynum.      Here is some of what Gasol has done since coming to the laksers last year:  This is starting when he came last year.    Gasol has helped the Lakers win 42 of their last 52 games, a number that would have been higher had the Gasol not sprained his ankle last March. The Lakers went 13-2 during Gasols first month in purple and gold. After struggling to a 9-6 mark in March partly because Gasol was on the injured list for nine games, the Lakers posted a 7-1 record in April and are 13-1 in October and November.     I|`|khbLZQHIaa	LeBron is the MVP.    I'm sorry you don't know how to use commen sense.|`|XrCc85kNaa	No..  Lebron is the MVP..    Deal with it!!|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	Kobe Bryant robbed Chris Paul of the MVP last year. it won't happen again. Lebron James will be the winner. Kobe Bryant did not deserve the MVP at all last year because Pau Gasol carried his team. without Gasol, the Lakers would be a 7th or 8th seed at best, and Kobe would still be crying like a baby for a trade.|`|VHphDgrhaa	No. Kobe ain't going to be MVP.     Never agian will I let that be true.    }8-]|`|plTYZU85aa	I think that D-Wade should be MVP. I have a lot of respect for Lebron and everything, but he has a really good team, sometimes when you watch the Cavs play, it doesn't even look like he is doing that much. D-Wade is single handedly carrying his team, coming of an injury. I think Lebron will win it though because he has a bigger fanbase, and his team is more popular.|`|tY3rZSsiaa	i think you have that logic wrong.  lebron is the mvp so far in the season of course that can change by the end of the regular season.  as for kobe, kobe with bynum last year was barely above .500, and when bynum went down, they got even worse.  when gasol arrived, your lakers went on a tear and won the west.  i dont think kobe was doing just fine with bynum alone.  without gasol, you wouldve been watching the celtics play some other team in the west.|`|vuh0i3Axaa	Chris Paul is the true M.V.P
jLTDqVHsaa	Join a bowling league.  Many leagues are "fun" leagues with low prize funds so that the competition doesn't matter a whole lot.  They also use "handicap" scoring systems so that a 110 average bowler can be competitive against a 190 average bowler.  It's also a very social sport, with quite a bit of downtime to relax and talk to people.    Give it a shot, even if you have never bowled before.  You'll learn along the way, and you'll find that there will be others with roughly the same skill level in your league.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	polar bear swim. oh take a blanket too.|`|teSCVfRoaa	Wii Fit best bet for those cold days.

EGe0k8P6aa	If the signs at my local Walmart's sporting goods counter are right doesn't do returns on any guns anymore.

Wal-Mart does take air rifles back, or at least they have in the past. It sounds like that's what happened in your case. Someone took that rifle home, mounted the scope**, then either didn't like the rifle or had a problem and took it back to Wal-Mart.     **If the dovetail mount is scratched up that's almost a sure sign the scope was mounted...    IMO, Wal-Mart should not have put that rifle back into stock to sell "as new"     You have a legitimate complaint...Don't do anything with the rifle....Box it up and take it back to Wal-Mart....Explain to them what happened....    The thing I would be concerned with is that the rifle was returned because of a problem....    Good luck

For example, if you are a serve and volley person then you might want to pick a more maneuverable racquet so you can get to all the volleys.|`|cISlJr8xaa	It dosen`t matter any grip suits any racket.Your swing style could be what is affecting your game.
CBVlu3Gvaa	I'd also like to see a guide that honestly listed the courses as to condition as well.....Hey if I am going to dream...why not dream Huge|`|AYkEwqRXaa	Sure, but it's unrealistic.  Different companies manage different courses.  Therefore each company puts out their own guide.|`|LHlturI0aa	Ohio has the best website for golfers!!!    www.ohiogolfguide.com    I would love to see every state have a similar golf guide. The guide has comments (by actual players), ratings, cost, directions, links to websites, scorecards, phone numbers, the courses are divided by county, regions, you can find a range or a retail facilityeverything you need to decide what course to play. I use it all the time!

d9329ea0bdca3de02039a3f70fc57a5faa	They are often on MSG, sometimes they are on Versus or NBC (only on Sundays) What MSG does is sells the game rights to versus because of another game or because they have something else scheduled. Check on the Rangers website to see which channel it is on|`|G33E41IBaa	They're on MSG+ today, because the Knicks are playing on MSG.  If you get MSG you should get MSG+ too.

Did you guys see how he crushed Del Potro? I mean cmon 6-3, 6-0, 6-0 is way better than Nadal's 6-2, 7-5, 7-5 victory over Simon. Besides, Roger is 15-2 over Roddick and although Roddick beat him last year, that is at the height of his mono and glandular fever.    For the women, I'm going Dementieva and Williams. I hope Dementieva wins.|`|zN0orpp3aa	I agree with your Nadal vs Roddick prediction. I think it'll be Zvonareva vs Dementieva for the women.|`|AbDAdrXkaa	Men:Defintely Federer vs. Nadal  Women: Williams vs. Safina|`|dU1z69H6aa	Mens:  Fernando Verdasco vs. Roger Federer   4 set win for Federer    Womens:    Vera Zvonareva vs. Elena Dementieva  Straight set win for Dementieva and the no. 1 ranking!|`|U5QOhYqvaa	I agree with above--Federer vs. Nadal BUT there is...a chance of Roddick vs. Nadal.

For its comedic value..What so funny about liverpool dominating.
Hzzdalavaa	I think you are confused.|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Goalkeeper: Jose Reina  Defender: Jamie Carragher  Midfielder: Steven Gerrard  Striker: Fernando Torres    I don't really feel comfortable breaking it down any further than that. It's unfair to compare different types of players.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	gerrard|`|MjPd9vyYaa	Alonso or Torres.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	It would have to be Gerrard, he's been carrying them single handed since their luck and the refs went against them.|`|ab2c491e6bca420e2c45c21f91d16208aa	the one man band who is Stevie Gerrard.|`|4Ygp0ikYaa	in the man:giggs  in liverpool:gerrard|`|baj33W9Yaa	If you're asking whose the best player, it's gotta be Steven Gerrard definitely!|`|a945c1f3af60e0fd27ec1b2cc1cebfc5aa	Carra!

d9329ea0bdca3de02039a3f70fc57a5faa	I'd buy a CCM helmet, but that's just me. But i suggest the 6k, i think the 4k offers good protection, but i think that the safer helmet will lead to less injury. If you want to save money, then ya go for the 4k but get the 6k if you don't mind the price
Veptmodnaa	At last West Ham are playing the "hammers" style of football that has been missing under the last three managers. Its a joy to watch again even when we lose! Zola has them believing in themselves which is so important. Cant deny though that Steve Clarke is probably making a lot of difference too.    Parker is looking superb in midfield and even Lucas Neill tackled someone tonight without giving a penalty away. A proper team at last!!     COYI !!!!|`|LdJFFvSVaa	What can you expect with a legend like Zola? His grin annoys me but he's proved himself as a manager.|`|MjPd9vyYaa	There awesome...I think Behrami is really good same with Bellamy.|`|rfCGWFNcaa	i agree they are playing some great stuff good luck to em as well what a difference a season makes eh|`|cjNtjOZtaa	They are playing very well .|`|mK06dus9aa	Agreed - and nice to see Carlton Cole at last start to deliver some of his long-awaited potential.
ziPiHdcHaa	You need to go to a book store and buy a magizine called Bekett they have one for every sport and it has the prices in it|`|1cde960f92f3cf52ea9b7b2bff72b659aa	Doesn't beckett have an online site? I know I used it, but that was years ago|`|Pq5Ds8F2aa	http://www.tuffstuff.com/priceguides/  This one seems pretty good.
afe603ba3e194df09373aa3fe7e6e4a8aa	Not legal for deer (shotgun or handgun only), but you could use it for groundhog, coyote, wild boar, or fox. A little bit overkill, but that's about it besides punching holes in paper.     Ohio is NOT the only state where you cannot hunt deer with a rifle. The other shotgun only states are Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Maryland, New Jersey, Massachuetts, Delaware, Maine, and Rhode Island. Also, three states impose shotgun only restrictions on firearm hunters in designated areas. These include Minnesota, Michigan, and Virginia.|`|AA12034449	I dont know if Ohio has shotgun- only areas or not...    But a .270 will hunt deer bear moose.... in all the 49 other states|`|EGe0k8P6aa	Coyote, fox, feral pig... Or any of the other game animals that can legally be taken in Ohio with a rifle (though it would be massively over-kill for most of them since they're usually small game).|`|JSGLKnA4aa	did your mom say you could!|`|COVwNYGVaa	I don't think you can use a rifle in Ohio, but yes it will work. Please check your local regulations before using a rifle. A bullet from a rifle carries a ton farther than a shotgun slug and could hit someone.|`|2TB8p5fvaa	Check you local guidelines to see if it is legal to use, if so then it will be good for anything from Varmint to Elk.

616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	Snoop wore a throwback Chargers' jersey (lance Allworth)in the video for "beautiful".|`|FtkoBEVpaa	I think he was wearing the powder blue jersey in the video for Gin & Juice, too, but I'm not sure.
DKcoZFVRaa	Yes, his name is Laurence Maroney and the commercial is for Fantasy Football. I personally would ot pick him for fantasy football as I made that mistake once and he is very injury prone.
d29M7lGKaa	Just thumb through the Bass Pro Shops catalog, they have rods and reels for all types of fishing , and they will show you what goes where!!!|`|nfCH7nkTaa	personally for the types I don't think the type of rod makes a huge difference other than length,   eg ice fishing rods are short while ocean fishing they are longer
TlfuGOCOaa	its subjective. depends on the age of the person and their weight ect... one of the personal trainers at my local gym has been known to do it for a good two hours, but he's a bit of roid freak. your best off not doing anymore than four-and-a-quarter-miles on anything higher than a mid setting, as thats what the distance the oxford-cambridge boat race is, and thats ****** intense.
q2TOb6unaa	There is one on each mountain I believe. They vary from slopestyle to halfpipe so just look for the competition where you haven't gotten any medals in yet on the map.    Good luck.
