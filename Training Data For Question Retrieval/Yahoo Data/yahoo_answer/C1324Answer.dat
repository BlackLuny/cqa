K0GTAH8Paa	In dreams when you are under attack or being abused it can sometimes mean that someone in your life is controlling you.    When you are walking down a path by yoursself or in a deserted place it can mean that you are going to be going through change in the near future. it also could mean that someone close to you has gone away.    When you go into tight spaces in your dreams it can mean that you have a lot to worry about, and have a lot of stress.    Some advice: go to your local bookstore i.e Borders/Barnes and Noble, and pick up the Dream Dictionary. its so great and it helps you decipher the meanings of your dreams.|`|5I3l7q7uaa	The dream really means that you are thinking of something that would happen to your life, but ain't happen.

Besides they are trying the very same thing the did during the depression  1,   and it failed then too.      Remember many of the programs were already in place when fdr took over, and he mostly expanded the current programs and added a few more.  Thereby forcing the depression to last another 8-10 years.    Overspending will extend the problems further, not fix em.

It is possible, and probable, that the child's behaviors were do to some other factor rather than race. More than likely it has to do with the parents style of disciplining the child. However, What is acceptable to one culture and one set of parents may not be acceptable to the next.    Assuming however that the mother was rewarding their child for such an act I have this to say. As children age they are likely to take on their parents morals and belief system. In this situation it would be detrimental to reinforce the negative behavior. Rather, It would be best to explain to the child the reasons behind why such behavior is inappropriate and correct the child's actions.|`|IllWKAUGaa	no, my mom gave into my brothers tantrums when he was little, and now hes 23 and they have escalated so intensely its not even funny...and hes a grown boy now...this doesn't do anything but make things worse...|`|dyPFkK4Daa	you have no idea what her motivations were for buying her kid those clothes.  just because she bought her kid clothes does not mean she was rewarding his disrespectful actions.  that's some faulty logic.  and yes i would, but i would also scold them and tell them whats up.  if your kid is smart and you raised them well, then you won't have to worry about whether buying them clothes will confuse their moral senses.  chances are this was the case with what you witnessed, since everyone knows Chinese people are the smartest in the world.  i know this because i am Chinese and i am one of the smartest people i know.|`|F5gtYbDVaa	its their life.  i wouldnt be nosy about it.  the parents should raise their kids in what they think is right.    ...holmes.|`|KEbn0z4uaa	i would never buy the kid clothes. probably smack em in public|`|aqsUNGfEaa	If they really needed new clothes then I can see getting them anyway, but otherwise no.|`|rj5FE3Klaa	Maybe what's disrespectful to another culture is normal to another? How did the kid act?|`|kXeGlHXOaa	First i would get on to my kid for doing that, I would still buy them clothes b/c they need it, but i would take some other form of action to discipline them|`|GXfSfcDyaa	As a hassled mother, the fact is, even if my kid had done something naughty, if I had taken them to the shops for the specific reason to buy them new clothes, I would probably still buy the clothes for them simply because they obviously need them and I wouldn't want to have to make another trip another day.     To my kids, clothes aren't really treats, just necessities, and I usually have to drag them by force to shop for new ones.  For this reason they wouldn't feel punished if I didn't buy them anyway.    That doesn't mean I wouldn't discipline them for the disrespectful act, but that would be done in a different way, by perhaps not buying them a treat (like a chocolate bar etc) while we were out or grounding them when we got home depending how bad the act.

4kfljeIGaa	First of all, let me say that I commend you for embracing your independence!  In our hook-up obsessed culture, it's quite refreshing to hear from someone who does not base her entire self-concept on some relationship.  And yes, I thought the asexuality answer was VERY presumptuous and in extremely poor taste.  Still, you should be prepared for that sort of thing, because lots of people will assume that if you're not actively looking for a girl- or boyfriend, then there must be something wrong with you.      Once I found a book at the public library titled, "I Kissed Dating Goodbye."  Right now I'm racking my brain for the author's name, but coming up short.  (Try looking it up on Amazon.com).  The basic premise was that the author wanted to stop dating until he felt truly spiritually ready to pursue a mate...since that is what he believed dating should be for (as opposed to just having a go-nowhere sexual relationship).  Since I was going through a very difficult time in my life, this radical new approach was just what I needed to hear right then.       (Oh, and just FYI: "celibacy" refers to abstention from marriage, though not necessarily from sexual conduct.  Quite often the term is misused in pop culture).|`|iHKJsyfTaa	Try this   http://groups.yahoo.com/group/havenforth...|`|u1vEj8DYaa	"Singleness" is hardly the glue that bonds.

j0Qd9Iayaa	I watch movies before i go to sleep and then i usually dream about it. My advice is that watch a movie that you'd likely want to be in your dream before going to bed. And then just think about what had happened in the movie, edit some parts if you may. Then maybe you'd dream about it.  But if you don't like that dream then you can just REALLY concentrate on something. When i was younger (8) I was scared that my mum would die then when i went to bed i dreamt about it. Like last night i dreamt about my grandad, i saw him, i hugged him but it wasn't the same. Bow i've ALWAYS wanted to go to back to thailand for a short vacation so i always dream of it, it was so real! But i ahev the dreams so manytimes i know it's a dream i'm having.

I feel that when I get enough sleep, I am more aware of what's happening in my dreams and that's probably the first step to controlling your actions in your dreams.  As for controlling what I want to dream about, I've never had any luck with that.

Ultimately the message was meant for you - so you can learn from him in ways he couldn't express.  And perhaps there was something revealed about him too.     I'm not sure if this helps, but here is a take on legs/feet in dreams.    ****  Legs  To see your legs in your dream, indicate that you have regained confidence to stand up and take control again. It also implies progress and your ability to navigate through life. If your legs are weak, then you may be feeling emotionally vulnerable. If you see someone else's legs, then it represents your admiration for that person. You need to adopt some of the ways that this person does things.    To dream that you legs are wounded or crippled, signifies a lack of balance, autonomy, or independence in your life. You may be unable or unwilling to stand up for yourself. Perhaps you are lacking courage and refuse to make a stand. If your dream that one of your leg is shorter than the other, then it suggests that there is some imbalance in some aspect of your life. You are placing more emphasis and weight on one thing, while ignoring other important aspects that need attention as well. If you are a woman and dream that your legs are hairy, then it suggests that you domineering or that you dominate in the relationship.    To dream that you have three or more legs, denotes that you are undertaking too many projects than you can handle. Unfortunately, you will find these projects to be unfruitful and a waste of time.       Feet  To see your own feet in your dream, symbolizes your foundation, stability and sense of understanding. It signifies your need to be more practical and sensible. Keep both feet on the ground. Alternatively, feet represents mobility, independence and freedom. Perhaps you have taken a step in the right direction and are contemplating your goals or your next step. The sole of the foot may be a pun of being or feeling like the only support of some person/situation.    To dream that you are washing your feet, indicates that others can easily take advantage of you. For Christians, washing your feet symbolizes forgiveness and compassion. If someone is kissing your feet, then it symbolizes humbleness, humility, or devotion.    In particular for the people of India, to dream of the feet, symbolizes divine qualities since the feet are considered the holiest part of the body.|`|ClblNgM1aa	no it's not like that my friend it is u who is not able to accept his death internally... don't worry god will take hold whom he likes very much may be ur dad would have bben god's choice this time... u just cool.... make ur father's soul which is around u happy by fulfilling ur father's dream... u love ur dad much that's y u feel it nothing else... just go ahead... life has more surprises to u... best of luck...|`|T5UY0Uqlaa	Father   To see your father in your dream, symbolizes authority and protection. It suggests that you need to be more self-reliant. Consider also your waking relationship with your father and how aspects of his character may be incorporated within yourself.     To dream that your father is dead, forewarns that you need to proceed with caution in conducting your business.     To dream that you are hitting your father. represents a desperate need for greater closeness with your father. You feel that he is not listening to you. In particular, if you are hitting your father with a rubber object, indicates that whatever you are doing or telling him has no significant effect on him. Things just literally bounces off him.?
K8LHoYruaa	I think that what you say has a certain amount of truth.     No man nor woman should ever be judged (especially by themselves) for displaying or not displaying feminine or masculine traits. However it is seen as a sign of weakness in some men that they may need counselling or  other psychiatric help.     Now the big question, was the female offered help more, or did she accept it more (or both)?     Is it that women are still seen as vulnerable and in more need of help (to the detriment of the males in need of help) so help is offered more often, and are they conditioned more to accept it? I know many men who would brush off help no matter what form it was offered in.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	Men need to teach their sons that it is okay to take help.

Or if not for themselves, for their sons.  Although to be fair, I'm not sure about what help you are suggesting.  It's a bit of a blanket statement.  I don't think my daughters have got more help in anything because they are girls.  One of my daughters has dyscalculi while my one son was diagnosed with dyslexia.  And he got a lot of help - mainly at my instigation.    Other than that, I don't think they have ever received help because they are girls.  Certainly, I haven't.

From a very early age, males are encouraged to put on a brave face at tough times, and not cry. Alongside deep-seated cultural values about what makes a man.    Society still looks on man as the provider, problem solver. strong, the fixer.  No doubt if you asked young boys who they saw as role models it would be men the like of Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger who portray men who are strong, the protector with all the answers.    Women are generally better communicators and will talk about problems and emotions with their peers, whereas men talk about things e.g. sports, cars etc especially with other men.    Men are far less likely to admit that they don't know the answer to a problem. Women are more likely to draw in others for help. But asking for help can be perceived by many men as weekness or incompetence which is possibly why they are reluctant to do so.    One of the most disturbing results of this is that statistics show that men are shown to be far less likely to go to the doctor and ask for help when they see symptoms of disease,  resulting in any illness being more progressed which must result in more deaths.    I think our culture and the ways in which boys and girls are treated from an early age is largely why this happens. As long as parents both mothers and fathers and the media continue to instil and portray these characteristics as the male ideal this will not change and men will continue to see asking for help as showing weakness.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	I think both are true.

Were you diagnosed with OCD? There are several meanings and contributing symptoms to it. Being Bi-Polar, or a "manic depressive", could cause you to say unnecessary, hurtful things. Having Tarretts (Sp?) syndrome, will cause you to have outbursts with cursing and what not. Speak to a doctor about this. I don't think though that anything you might be experiencing, comes from OCD.|`|X6RwSrJjaa	No, it just means you have terrible social skills.|`|ENANtueuaa	Nope, that sounds more like turrets syndrome. OCD is obsessive compulsive disorder. It's where you have rituals such as hand washing, counting, checking, etc.|`|4TNavgDuaa	Yes, It could!

cX79gknGaa	It sounds like you may have a bit of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Although I was never diagnosed with it myself, I think I had suffered from it to a degree when I was your age. I think it may actually be hormonally-linked. I don't really have those tendencies to much of any degree now, but I do very occasionally obsess on things at times. I do tend to over-analyze much too much, but I know that that's just who I am. The times I do get too focused on something I try to divert my mind to some sort of study or other pursuit separate from what I was doing previously, and I also try to relax. Maybe you can try to do the same, but if not you may want to talk to your doctor about it. I know that at the height of my obsessiveness, a small amount and duration of an anti-depressant was very helpful to me.    Best of luck!|`|r9wrDGm2aa	I'm the exact same way, you just have to learn to love yourself and accept things the way there are. There arent solutions to every problem and sometimes you just have to deal with the cards life dealt you. I have a tendency to read too much into how a person acts. Sometimes it's really not all that deep. I know I do this because i want the comfort of having an answer as to why a person does things, but the fact of the matter is that i have to find comfort in not having all of the answers.   Goood luck.|`|mmCxiJZVaa	you really cant.. its part of who you are.. i tried... but i guess in your case. the way you describe it.. you might just need to calm down and occupy yourself with other things? what are somthings you like to do. maybe you wont be so caught up on analyzing everything if youre busy.    try to sleep. itll probably help your psychological health..|`|6A0GkXXjaa	That happens to me when I have too much me time.

6GmtcZteaa	More confidence, better realationships with people, people like to be around somoene confident. Better vision of what you want, amition, definity of your own opinions, a feeling of happiness, and if you have a low self esteem then you prbably wont be so good at school, work or in ay social occasion or environment because youd be constantly thinking of what people think of you and what they want. Having self esteem makes you better as a person, and a better person around people. and a sense of self worth is essential to feel that you are important in your environment, which is called adapting and is necessry, or else youd be at your job for 3 years asking yourself hat brought you here. self worth makes it easier for you to accept your reality, and the fact that you are needed by those who are around you. and that you are doing a good job and improving yourself and your future and youd be more positive and so the atmosphere in general in your life, itll be pleasnt. Having sel worth really on many levels is so usefull and essential, thats how people excell, thats successs.  Tc|`|2k8TEiRtaa	it prevents them from having any happiness. if you do not esteem yourself enough to be the best you can.

It's always going to be about choice.  But the issue at hand is that very few realize that we do have choices at literally everything in life.  What we and others judge of our self worth is not real.  It's all based on things that have happened in our past that we put meaning on. The events themselves are real, but what we perceive is not.  Our self image is created by our own thoughts.  Our thoughts are also influenced by others' thoughts...which are created the same way our own is created from...past.  We choose to own or be owned, but it starts by realizing we have a choice.  A positive sense of self will most likely occur if we are present, and let go of anything from past that gets in the way, so that our future is open for any possibility.

When the gas is gone, so is much of our technology. Countries around the world have recognized this, and are starting to pull back on investing in the US (and other countries), and concentrating on their own needs.    This retrenching has had several symptoms -- the housing crisis (loans being called in), the lack of confidence in the stock market, and the see-saw of energy prices.    We are not doomed. We'll get it figured out. We're in for some rough times, but people are smart and there will be new ways. I think it may be the end of civilization as we know it, but . . . perhaps the next one will be better?    I have a feeling we'll probably be switching to nuclear power before too long. Solar and wind are great, but limited in application, and just can't replace gas and oil at the present population levels.     (-: Of course, when we run out of atoms, we'll be back here, won't we?    Aw well, buck up. My grandparents survived the Great Depression; surely we'll muddle through this depression.

The idiots in Washington are giving money to the people at the top to help their business supposedly, anyone with any common sense can see that if you want to help the economy put the money in the hands of the consumers to spread it around back into the economy and in turn will help it the way it is supposed to , but that would be logical and we can't have that can we. Buying American made products would help instead of supporting foreign countries . We sell our products to other countries for pennies and buy their junk for dollars. And then there is gas, sell them SOB,s food for the same price as gas. Other countries are laughing at us all the way to the bank. let's face it ,our leaders are dumbasses and the biggest one is at the top and I did not vote for him.

c59485c5fb066f0af7ae58a856c4b126aa	Oh, yeah. If you don't mind Mass Starvation and The Spread of Infectious Diseases through Unsanitary Conditions.    The modern farmer depends on fertilizers and farm equipment which is . . . provided by modern industry.    If everyone is going to grow a little garden in their backyard to help with the food budget, maybe things would work. But PROBABLY not! My mother-in-law has been growing food for the family for 40 years or more, and let me tell you, it is HARD work. It's not something you pick up in a week or so. I've gardened organically about 10 years, and there's NO WAY I could support my family on what I grow. I have finally gotten the hang of pumpkins, but other than that . . . no.    If the recession/depression wakes people up to the importance of Food, then I'm very happy. But if little children start starving as a result of it, I Am Not Happy At All.     Besides, only a rich society can afford organic foods. The economic depression will result in poor people eating crap food, and rich people fiddling around in their gardens, growing tomatoes and haricots while the poor starve on processed food all around them. It is only our recent wealthiness that has allowed us to experiment with back-to-nature lifestyles and techniques. We need more time!!!
ffkIisYwaa	1. Answer is C      (The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act was established to    increase trade in North and South America 1934)    2. Answer is D       (Textbook definition)     3. Answer is A       (Competitive markets are capitalistic and manufacturers seek to meet market demands.  Supply side is government intervention and is therefore NOT competitive.  The second part "all external benefits" is like maximum employment in economics, its impossible.)    4. Answer is D       (The answer is D because the Federal Reserve can't do any of the the first three options, therefore the answer must be D.)    5. Answer is B        (As the Mexican Peso gains in value, there products cost more for foreign buyers and the value of the foreign dollars have to fall because of the buying ""power"" of the Peso.  Laughable because the Peso is NO where near having a strong position.)    6. Answer is D       (Progressive- the more you make the more they take.    Optimal is wrong because optimal taxes would be 0.    Proportional is wrong because 1000 is taxed at 0 and 6000 is taxed at 25%, it would be proportional if all taxes were at 25%.    Regressive is wrong because the taxes become 'progressively' larger.)

Civilisation will change yet again if there is a threat of that nature. Further if you have seen the mating habits of an *** for example there is no evidence that the *** thinks it is time to procreate and have kids just before the act, they are merely fulfilling a bodily need the same as us humans. Of course human's procreate more than animals as is evidenced by marriage and attempts to have children by various fertility treatments.
cX79gknGaa	It depends on the type of taxation, but taxation either increases the costs of a good or service or decreases the spending power of the consumer. Excise taxes increase the cost of goods and services produced and therefore reduces demand. Income and payroll taxes reduce disposable income of consumers, thereby reducing their consumption.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	The more Tax on an item the more it costs and the less consumers want to buy it....|`|pnZssBg9aa	The higher the level of income taxes, the less money people have to save. This means that their savings are less, so they spend less $ on consumption.|`|oHOSxg0faa	Taxation reduces consumption because the government (or taxer) is reducing the purchasing power that each individual tax payer has to spend in an economy.           Think about it this way:  if you made $1000 and the government takes $200 from that, instead of you going out and buying a new tuxedo, a dinner at a restaurant and other things with your $1000, you have to limit your spending because of reduced purchasing power.  What occurs is that the tuxedo seller (as an example) loses your business, which they would have received if you had kept the amount of money before you were taxed.  Because you had to choose between the tuxedo and something else with the lower amount of money you had after taxation, an industry loses business because that money is no longer there to be spent by the person who made the money.           Taxation may help support some industries, but it does so at the expense of others.  Some taxation is necessary, but wasteful government spending and taxation can hurt an economy and interfere with true free market pricing.
kaBXMVh8aa	Bello lo scritto..  forse manca qualcosa per  davvero bello e si sente una tristezza non accentuata, pi languida, quasi malinconia.  Personalmente mi piacciono come poeti italiani   Dante, Leopardi, Gozzano e i crepuscolari, Montale, Saba, Pasolini, Pascoli. Direi anche  De Andr (diamo a Cesare quel che  di Cesare).  Stranieri:  Basho (il pi celebre poeta degli haiku giapponesi), Tagore, Shakespeare per i sonetti, Coleridge, Dylan Thomas, MIlton, Wordsworth, Keats, Blake, Wilde, Baudelaire, Prevert, Rimbaud, Verlaine, Garcia Lorca, Neruda, Pessoa, T.S Eliot, Emily Dickinson, Sylvia Plath, Walt Whitman.

pzLDXL6gaa	In my experiences women want sex as much as men but men are always making a fuss and going on about their high sex drives and needs but plenty of women are like that too or even more because they don't get that time afterwards where they can't go again. Some aren't though - it really varies by individuals, for both genders. Your gf isn't really unusual though.    Harriet|`|OTT79NAtaa	Women have the ability to have sex when they need to/want to. So in your instance a woman having sex 4times a day it is not shocking to see. Nor is it shocking to see a woman wait for marriage until sex with no problem-- or have the same woman do both.  Women sell sex for social gain and as such nature has equipped them with the ability to abstain or indulge sex as the environment requires.     - Nature gave men a more volatile sexual libido and a greater ability for occupational utility so that women and men would seemingly 'need' each other (and come together to biologically reproduce and socially communicate).|`|nhZb43pIaa	I agree with Snufkins.  I too need sex often, daily, and require it. I too have had most men who are not able to keep up with me or please me until I too found my Soldier. I think he is a rare breed among men.  I'm like your ex and can have it 4xs a day. I never tire of it or want it to stop.  I like Snufkins also knew that my mate had to be highly sexually active or it would never work out. I found my Soldier on a sex site and have been with him for over 4 years. I'm completely addicted to him and his sex. I don't know what I would do if he left. It took me 3 years of searching to find a man that could provide what he does.    Whorella cant believe your story  of having sex for 6 hours,which tells you again that most men and women don't have sex like we do and couldn't keep up.  If Whorella knew my sex schedule she would no longer use the title Whorella...save that for me,you, your ex, and Snufkins.|`|sGWVQcQmaa	i didnt see the porn question you are refering to but i think that many women are almost as horny as men - I happen to have a high sex drive.  It just takes less for a man to get aroused i think so it seems like men are hornier.|`|oCHaJc49aa	The truth is, women are of about two varieties:     1. the Frigid Feminism types    and     2. The over-sexed types.     The two varieties occasionally collide in the same person, but for the most part they hate each other.    Men are (in modern times) seen as being the sexual aggressor, yet this was not so until VERY recently. In fact, back in the bad old days, it was all men who were seen as needing protection from the sexually aggressive females.    The truth of the matter is somewhere between the two extremes. I saw somewhere recently that the female gender as a whole passes on about 80% of it's genetic code, and the entire male gender passes on about 40%. This means that women are about twice as sexually active as what males are.     I shall have to look up the source, it's an obscure one, so it'll take me some time to do so.    This rings true from what I have seen, especially considering the "spoilt rich bad boy" type most women seem to prefer, of which there are few of, but have an awful lot of girlfriends all of whom seem to worship the very thought of the colossal disappointment and shattering heartbreak that is certain to follow from their "devotion" to that type of partner. Yet the girls flock to them.    This has another name: shooting yourself in the foot.|`|8oGTduFAaa	no a lot of girls love to have sex, especially if they really care for their man..it makes it a lot more enjoyable, plus you are always comfortable to try new things, although there are some girls out there that might not like to have sex that much.|`|WKtakdsOaa	I am always horny and usually hornier than most men. My husband can keep up with me which is good but it took a lot of men to find him.  A guy with a very high sex drive was one of the main things I wanted in a  husband|`|G1kdupY3aa	That's about 6 hours of screwing.  Add to that 11 hours at work and commuting.  6 hours for sleeping.    Your house must be in an awful state!|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	Before my husband and I had kids we would some times stay in be all weekend and have sex. Even during the week we would have sex twice a day, but alas that's how we ended up with three kids! LOL  We still find time for once a day and are pretty consistent.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I'm pretty damn horny, so I'd say yeah.  Sex is always on my mind.
nhZb43pIaa	I love extreme porn of any kind but rough and nasty is by far my  my favorite. I won't watch any thing other than extreme, usually have to order foreign to get what I want, and have had men who felt uncomfortable with what I watch.   No, I don't find any of it degrading. These people aren't forced.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	What you're describing isn't necessarily degrading, but I don't understand how it could possibly be a turn-on. The last example (and this is a pretty bad one) of hardcore porn I saw was a seen from the movie Closer, in which Jude Law's character pretends to be Julia Roberts' character on an Internet sex chat and has a convo with Clive Owen's character. They come up with some pretty nasty stuff. (The clip is on YouTube if ya want a look.)|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Extreme hardcore- like Rocco Siffredi and Max Hardcore- is not pleasant for me whatsoever.  No heads shoved in toilets, closed-fist hitting, and so on.    But I do enjoy rough porn, so long as the girl seems enthusiastic and like she can take it and dish it out just as much as the guys.  I prefer scenes that aren't misogynistic (i.e. no calling her "b*tch" or power dynamics outside of BDSM), where they just seem to enjoy rough stuff together.  Deep-throating is fun to watch, but facials just aren't my thing (probably because I'm not that big a fan of c*m, regardless of where it lands).    But when it comes with hard core porn, though, I rank gay hardcore to be the yummiest, then lesbian hardcore (a la Crashpadseries.com, etc.), and then finally straight porn, mostly because straight porn is far too fakey and the women are annoying in their porny screams or dirty talk.  And the aforementioned misogynistic feel to a lot of it that I dislike.|`|4SFHGHyfaa	I'm a guy.  I only enjoy hard core girl on girl.  I used to find still picture erotica hot XD|`|6YPVVsbwaa	yes, i think about it daily|`|sGWVQcQmaa	i think it is degrading.  I have no idea of the women in the porn movies like that type of treatment but i dont know any normal women who do either.  Its degrading because it reduces the woman to boobs and a vagina - basically she might as well be a  blow up doll.  I dont like facials because the ejaculate gets in my eye and hurts and messes up my makeup.  Also it seems kinds of patronizing as its rude/disrespectfull to squirt someting in someones face in general.  Also deep throating is un necessary as i find that if you just develop your oral sex skills then deep throating is not needed for satisfaction.  Its degrading because it seems rude to shove anything down someone elses throat, never mind the person you love/care about.  I tried deep throating once with my ex boyfriend and didnt like it because he was basically fu@king my face and i felt like a blow up doll.  But thats just my tastes - everyone is different,  the important thing is to not do anything to your partner that they do not like.|`|hKiSCL4Iaa	I think that we all go through stages.  What used to work, doesn't work so much anymore. Its normal.    I don't think its degrading at all.  I dare say plenty of women enjoy the act itself.  ;-)  Porn of said activities is certainly enjoyable to some.|`|45TGzqOxaa	*Raises hand*    Lmfao.   Might have something to do with the fact that I'm actually bisexual.    Or... that's the reasoning my freidns came up with. ._.  I don't know any other girl who even admits to watching porn, let alone the stuff that's considered offensive.|`|cVhuFVWSaa	I enjoy all types of porn. Sometimes I am in the mood for really hardcore stuff and other times I like a good soft core medley. It really depends on my mood. I do not like butt stuff or the ones that just show deepthroating  the entire time, mix it up will you? Face shots aren't my fave but just about any form of porn will get me turned on!|`|0IhCFeXLaa	i used to get horny when my boyfriend would stroke my hand.  now it has no affect, as we have went further and further.    point is, the further you go, the more desensitized you get.  to me, watching porn can be fun, but if you love someone like i do, you dont want to watch it anymore because it takes all the mystery and fun out of each other.     I think porn lessens what sex should be, which is about enjoying the person you love.     Im in love.. and i only want to know what makes my boyfriend tick,not the guy on screen.    so in the end it makes actual sex less fun in my opinion because it takes the specialness out of it.    but if you are single i say why the hell not.|`|OTT79NAtaa	I assume the women who are too unattractive for softcore and/or enjoy the extra pay of hardcore like it very well. I also assume that women don't have sex- nor indulge or exploit sex unless they can gain socially from it, and thus many if not most women who watch porn only do so after being introduced to it by a man.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	When do you think your going to shut the hell up and do something worth typing you retard? :)    Eat ME!|`|WKtakdsOaa	I used to like softcore when I was 12 and I watched a porn called sex withh the stars when I was at a sleepover with my mates. It is so cheesy and crap but it turned me on at the time. I still remember it lol. The guy had to do a girl from each sign of the zodiac    Softcore is rubbish but its for when you are too young to get anything else lol. I prefer the harder stuff and like it rough. I dont think deepthroating or facials are degrading. I think facials are one of the sexiest things you can watch in porn as a girl. All my mates get turned on by that cause its sexy watching a guy play and come. I dont like anything romantic type of thing and think all the best porn stuff is the rough stuff. My favourite deepthroater is Heather Brooke. I think she is sexy and I like when she has the plaits. Her husband has a big one too so it is visually very pleasing|`|e07f8c1e78556e477bf544de03c31b1aaa	I watch a sh*t ton of porn... normally by myself... I guess I am a loser.|`|9tyx5BkPaa	I like normal porn.|`|zn8TzZrJaa	Hm, I don't watch most of that.  BUT if their okay with putting it on the internet and they don't feel like they have been degraded(the people themselves) then I don't care.  It does seem somewhat degrading, BUT those were individuals choices.  Soo   pretty much it was individuals therefore you should not be able to judge me by them...therefore I do not strongly feel that women have been degraded.  lmao you know what?  I am only 15 O_o and I am girl! Wow I am too open-minded lmao there must be somethin wrong with me. XD|`|elpaPX96aa	No...i dont find it degrading to woman, because there are several woman who actually like doin things like that such as myself, & there is nothin wrong with that, especially the people who choose to be in that line of work, & it doesnt matter what any woman tells you...she likes it secretly too, it just takes a real woman to admit it.|`|BkleL3F4aa	chicks hate porn  especially snufkins, she protests against it and sets her bras on fire.      Seriously though mate, of course women like porn, it they didn't there would be no female porn stars, or swingers or bdsm subs.. etc|`|2cep886Waa	I don't really like rough things, but other things I find are really entertaining.

There are moments of happiness . But There have always been times of trouble. Our true colors come out when we can overcome adversity and our hearts remain clean. Our first reactions don't really count. It's what happens afterwards. Which determines our self confidence and self esteem. True happiness IMO is being free and content with who you are and how you deal with Life. looking at the beautiful things in life instead of the negative is key to happiness.
72H4hFaHaa	Yes, I believe so  In Biology: evolution refers to ever-increasing changes in a population or species over many generations.  The long term result of evolution is survival.( An organism suffering a high mortality rate tends to become stronger to match its environment)   Fear is a basic survival mechanism in response to threats and danger ( imagine a human without fear walking straight into a hungry lions path)    Survival mechanism is a part of what drives evolutionary change.|`|ni7Qgt3Raa	our common fear of death made us evolve in medical science|`|2DICrKNraa	umm, survival perhaps!?  fight...or flight.|`|dMKi5UWIaa	Most definitely.

QbzvWJe0aa	I don't think if it is a gender specific problem, but I know panic attacks are triggered by obsessive thoughts. When you over think something I was reading once (sorry I don't remember the source), the brain sends you a warning signal "danger". When repeated for long periods of time it creates unbalance. Therefore the more you panic, the more difficult is to resolve the problems.     I copy/paste this article which explains better:     "A panic attack is a horrible and terrifying experience, but it is not in any sense dangerous. Panic disorder is actually an entirely natural bodily reaction that is occurring OUT OF CONTEXT.    For example, when we feel our survival is somehow threatened, all mammals have an instinctual response to either fight or flee. This response produces a sudden surge of adrenaline, accompanied by strong feelings of anxiety and panic, and a very intense urge to flee or escape the situation or circumstance.    It is interesting that the intensity of the reaction and the strong urge to flee are things that would ensure your survival if you were truly in danger.....    The flow of adrenaline and the resulting extra blood flow increases your strength and awareness of the danger. This extra "awareness" of the perceived danger may cause all sorts of feelings, such as dizziness, nausea, hyperventilation, heart palpitations, confusion, lack of control, unreality, being dazed, shaking, trembling, and sweaty palms, among others.    During a panic attack, your body goes through the same physical processes as it would if you were in real danger. The DIFFERENCE, of course, is that although you feel you are in danger, you really ARE NOT. That you undergo panic attacks -- without knowing why -- only makes the situation much more frightening.    Because of these feelings of panic, it's very common to "invent" or attribute danger to the accompanying bodily symptoms. Remember, though, that NO ONE has ever had these things happen to them as a result of a panic attack:    "I'M GOING CRAZY":     "I'M GOING TO PASS OUT":      "I'M HAVING A HEART ATTACK":      "I WILL STOP BREATHING AND SUFFOCATE":     "I'M LOSING CONTROL":     Although the thoughts and feelings of anxiety and panic are all too real, the brain is being tricked into thinking that you are somehow in danger -- when actually you are not. Part of effective therapy includes realizing this and slowly changing ingrained thought patterns. Another part of therapy is in actually tapping the emotional side itself -- to quiet and relax the mind so that anxiety and panic will have no choice but to eventually disappear.    Active, cognitive/behavioral therapy has been shown by research to be the most effective therapy in dealing with the anxiety problems.  Usually, there is no reason to rehash the past and analyze it to death. In fact, the more you think and analyze your problems, the worse you can make your condition. (Analysis = paralysis). Instead, a focus on making the present better so that the future is (almost) anxiety-free is the best and most permanent course of action to take.    Today, panic is being successfully treated in the vast majority of cases. Active cognitive-behavioral therapy plus a strong motivation and persistence on the part of the client are the essential ingredients in overcoming this major anxiety disorder.    -- Thomas A. Richards, Ph.D.,  Psychologist/Clinic Director    -----------------------------------    I have a male friend that suffers from panic attacks, therefore I think it is more related to personality than gender.|`|6GmtcZteaa	Women tend to get scared more than men.

In fact, only my closest of associates can tell.  Sometimes, they can tell before me!    "Hey, man, you're freaking, please go breathe."    Which is a good thing, as the panic sensation also incites the 'trapped' or 'frustrated' response, which morphs, rather quickly, into anger.  And once I get angry, everything starts going downhill fast.|`|Ld0ZgPmjaa	Men often front up to the emergency room thinking they've had a heart attack only to be told it was a panic attack.

2FWxIbpgaa	I would say that the easiest field of anthropology that one can be employed in is archeology.  One can, in the context of a major in cultural anthropology, attend successfully 6 credits of archeological field school, and along with a bachelor's degree in cultural anthropology, be employed as an entry level archeological field technician.  The work is hard, but expect to make between $10-14 per hour and receive a cash in hand per diem fee of $25-30 tax free.  My first job as an archeological field technician a few years back helped me pay back some of my university loans, and then I went back to graduate school to get a master's degree in archeology.    As far as pure cultural anthropology or biological anthropology are concerned, the entry level degree is the master's degree.  With cultural anthropology, you will have to do some sort of ethnographical fieldwork.  With biological anthropology, your fieldwork could be in a laboratory.  However, unless you are doing forensic anthropology in the subfield of biological anthropology, where you can start working as an 'expert', you will be going all the way for a doctorate degree, a ph. D.  Then expect many years of study, research, and then find yourself unable to find a job right away.  University professors make a lot of money, but it's a very politically charged environment.    There are four subdisciplines of anthropology: cultural, biological, archeology, and linguistics.  You can prepare for many possible fields within each subdiscipline, or prepare for other, seemingly unrelated fields with your anthropology degree.    Check out the websites below for more information.

7p3TCz3qaa	Spiders in a dream are connected with deceit,a web of lies.So you have to ask yourself who around you isn't being honest.Or it might be you who is the deceitful one! You say that your grandad had a walnut tree when you were little,so the walnuts in your dream may represent a time in your past when you were happy and carefree.Putting the walnut and the spider together in your dream suggests to me that you have been deceitful and you're terrified you will be found out (represented by the spider) and you wish you were a child again so you don't have to responsible for your actions (represented by the walnuts).

The cure is to get to know the guy so that you can eliminate the mystery factor and somehow desensitize yourself from his presence.|`|rTwsdq6kaa	it means you have feeling for him. don't pull your heart back on a leash. if you continue doing that, the more you'll feel nervous and self-conscious around him.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Do you want green signal?|`|fijYOZg1aa	It is an emotion, not a logic.|`|AA10950898	Yeah, it's called normal for your age.|`|PP0hNckuaa	infatuation :D i feel the same way to with another guy, cant say love coz we only know each others faces not names :D    http://clickako.blogspot.com/  http://doubleu3x.blogspot.com/|`|AA11354548	AWEEE yoo likee likee likee thee boyy,  cute been there, its amazing,  ahahah.    aww just talk to him,  i did that i was surprised that  it turned out so well.  we're not going out anymore,  but i was just me and at the time didn't wear a lot  of make up or anything i felt icky,  and he was a football player, but it  was soo good :D i was very happy i did that.  he's still a cool kid.|`|YiBvzIHsaa	It is normal for an adolescent to feel infatuation for different people in different ways. Humans send off different vibes that make you react in different ways.    You could think of this boy as being your stimulate and your actions are the reactant. However, you are just completely normal. I cannot tell you how many times I was thinking like that when I was younger.    You can relate it to things in psychology, but not to an acknowledging extend. You do not have any mental, physical or social problem, at least it doesn't sound like it.    It is possible that you could have an anxiety disorder related to psychology and there are many different kinds, but I do not want you to go thinking that because I HIGHLY doubt it.     You seem as just a normal school girl.|`|X3lrPVbKaa	You know that happened to me and I didnt know why I was feeling like that. I thought I could never be with the guy, he was prince charming good looking.   Try to be friends with the guy very casually. Be comfortable and self confident in front of him. It may be some insecurities inside you that is coming out. If he sees that he can cause a powerful reaction in you then he may try to abuse it. Be strong dear.|`|CT8pwhM5aa	He puts you off your game, as it were. You perceive him to be your match or greater.

Find one common interest to bring up in a conversation and the rest will take care of itself.
Hd1X4wO4aa	My mother has been raising my brother and I as a single mother after my father died when we were babies.     She's not a typical case example, though. For one she comes across as the definition of maternal, she labeled everything when we were babies (like chair, table, television, etc.) and she talked about complex subjects from early on.    She also has a bachelor's degree and a hell of a lot of perseverance.    That of course can't be expected from every single mother, but I think the most important of those things would be strong maternal instincts on the part of the mother and good education. Those two things would seem to cover all the bases and ensure that children turn out to be good upstanding citizens.    One thing I have definitely learned growing up is that the welfare system is pretty messy. My mother said that when she reported some increase in pay or some job at one of her applications, they lowered the food stamp money. She thinks that the government should give out money for a few years until said mother can get on her feet with a job and home. "Getting on her feet" would include getting benefits while continuing to work.    My mother was forced to sign up to go to a college course (and thereby leave my brother and I for a few days at one of those worthless daycares) when she applied for welfare. I guess the idea was to giver her the skills to apply for and work at a job. While it's a good idea in principle, she said that it was absolutely worthless (especially considering that she already had a degree in restaurant management). Maybe they could have practical and convenient education set aside specifically for parents in risk of reaching the poverty level.    There's close to nothing that can be done about that first point concerning maternal instincts though.     My mother's friend was talking about how they had to give out free blankets in some neighborhood to get mothers to bring their children in for immunizations, which is kind of a sad reflection on the mother. There is just about nothing that can be done when you have a mother with a poor attitude toward parenting (and her children) to begin with, I'm sad to say. What we should do is have resources available for the mothers who are really trying to get their children a better life- welfare at the current level seems to be about keeping people at a bare minimum and leaving them there.    Short of getting a shiny new government, all we can do is put some band aids on the problem.    Good question.|`|TIOfnPlQaa	Short answer:  timely identification of at-risk populations and early intervention.  Resources.    "Reactive Attachment Disorder (sometimes called "RAD") (DSM-IV 313.89) is a psychophysiologic condition (1) with markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts that begins before five years of age and is associated with grossly pathological care. This pathological caregiving behaviour may consist of any form of neglect, abuse, mistreatment or abandonment."    Obviously, the roots of 'grossly pathological care' need to be addressed.  Very often, this REACTIVE disorder is a result of depression and other forms of mental illness in the primary caregiver (like untreated post-partum depression).  An impoverished, isolated, stressed mother lacking in resources is far more likely to be clinically depressed than one who is not.  So is the infant.    More thorough screening and follow-up care of at-risk populations by mental health care professionals would be beneficial.  There needs to be more resources made available.  Resources cost money, and taxpayers are at loathe to pay.  Evidently American taxpayers prefer to pay later - when these social problems are so enormous they just can't be swept under the carpet anymore.|`|3720c8d6fc740d5ec25d1b3775ebf59baa	You should never shame a child in the early formative years as this is a time when the young child is learning about the primary personality - any attachment problems that  become apparent usually surface when the  young personality enters the secondary stage of personality development around the age between 5-6 years depending on the intellectual and cognitive ability of the emerging personality of the youngster this why it so important not to shame and blame a child and this is so damaging to the childs development particulary differcult as you rightly -  say for single moms - children need a - safe secure -  environment where they know the - protective resistance of their bounderies are not going to be harmed in any way -  for where there is no clearly defined boundry - the childs interaction is made less secure and the child becomes confused and will challenge any will of the parent against their own judgement and the situation is complex as there is a chance that some estrangement in the childs personality begins to show aggressive tendency towards any efforts to resolve their predicament - social interaction - is about a duty of care and parents -  need better education - about the consequences of remaining in ignorance of the these guidelines - the early years of childhood need careful consideration and a little understanding is all that is needed - to ensure the emergence of the little personality does come up against fear based shameful patterns of behaviour in the early formative years - thats all folks.|`|cecb8b383242fb859e0c3d1393509369aa	Now, I know I no longer live in the states; haven't for the past 13 yrs, still the one thing I know is there comes a time where you cannot depend upon society, cause society is involved in its own problems so to speak.  In that case what do you do?  Do you just sit there and do nothing or do you decide on your own to do someting?  Close relationships between parent and child, child and child are built upon communication.  Communication does not only comprise of just talk and more talk; it comprises of listening, by that I mean some good hard listening.  Here let me give you an example.  I have a 12 y/o daughter and I am constantly getting at her to clean up after herself, this led into her screaming at me; instead of hitting her, I kept still until she finished; then I asked her a very important question: Perhaps I should leave you to your own devices?  To which she nodded.  In truth she does clean up after herself, it takes a while, still she does and her things are organized like you would never believe; meaning I was also guilty for not giving credit.  Yes that is another point we must give credit where credit is due, that is up to us.  We are the society in our children's lives not society as a whole.  Everything begins in the home, even if you are a single parent it begins with you inside your home.|`|d7c4c19b5cd4b1b2e1eb53e46d0ad5abaa	I'd like to see more baby-friendly workplaces.

Better education, social supports? Any ideas?"    70% of the criminal population comes from single mother households. Women should be discouraged as much as possible from sleeping around and bringing up bastard children. Having a child without a father is selfish and unfair to the child and should never be supported by the state. If they cant keep their legs closed for the local bad boys then thats their problem not tax payers.     If feminists really cared about children they'd never encourage this sort of lifestyle. As usual its all about what the woman wants no matter how foolish, self-centered, and destructive it is and of course they need the government to support them in order to make it possible.|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	Just a couple of off-the-cuff thoughts:     - ensure that babies are *wanted* (meaning maximize the accessibility and usage of birth control, improve public education about reproduction)   - provide a full year of parental leave   - on-site day care centers at large companies   - offer job-sharing and other flexible employment arrangements  for parents (it is understood that these options will carry fewer benefits than full-time work)    To Levity:  The issue itself may not appear to be financial, but all of the proposed solutions carry significant financial implications... so I assert that it IS a financial issue.|`|hBFSQ9bbaa	In an interview last year, I was asked if I had any children.  I did not complete the interview because even though I don't have children, the principle is that my ability to be hired was based on whether or not I had kids.

It should be understandable.  just a thought.|`|a0HfL6JHaa	gladly, mrs. juniper.  the issue is not financial although it may probably help.  babies & toddlers learn from their environment.  they require attachments, consistency, & associations.  punishments & rewards motivate behaviors.

(-: Take a look at the Mother Earth News archives, if you want to see what kinds.    We are using our own oil, but a lot of our oil is too hard to extract at the current prices. When the prices go way up, then they'll start drilling more.    I really think we'll go nuclear when the oil starts to run out, and switch to electricity for our cars and heating and everything. It's a dangerous technology, but we can do it, and we know we can get considerable energy out of it. Solar and wind and geothermal and wave power and water power are certainly alternatives, but they won't work for all areas. Nuclear can be used in many, and easily "transported."    But I do have a fond place in my heart for the renewable resources. (-: And, if we ever run out of atoms, we'll be right back here, looking for new energy!

These people obviously for some reason just lost that feeling, somone should bring it back. Besides, it hurts me alot to see a beautiful young woman cutting herself while there are woman out there that would kill to be half as pretty as her.

AA11611282	It is common. The client and the therapist often have a close bond, where the client tells the therapist everything about themselves, and the therapist does not judge them negatively. This intimate relationship and non-judgement is often translated to attraction. I mean don't we all want a partner that really knows us, doesn't judge, and is there to support us. Also, the client really knows very little about the therapist, so may project many great qualities on them. This is the set-up for the perfect partner. The problem is that it is an unequal and false relationship. The therapist is not who the client imagines, and the attention is partly because it is the therapists job, and not necessarily as much  to do with honest interest on theri part.|`|a7d1dc39931849d0bb98a1ce75f66b41aa	It's transference--a lot of times, you project emotions onto your therapist from your past.  It's good in that it can help you work through past issues that you've dragged into the present.  Transference is actually part of the process.    But it's bad in that you're attracted to your therapist.  Which can be uncomfortable and weird, even guilt-inducing.    Personally, I was very attracted to my current therapist for a while, but I worked through it and talked to him about it after I felt I had resolved it enough to not feel too weird about it.  Fortunately, my therapist is young and handsome, so at least I didn't have to deal with the, "oh, god, why am I attracted to THIS guy?!?" effect that can happen in therapy.      Cold comfort, I suppose.    It doesn't always happen, but it's certainly normal, even expected in most cases.  It's just the nature of the beast.  By working out your inappropriate feelings for your therapist, it can help you work out stuff in your life in general.    So it's actually pretty helpful, if handled correctly.|`|gn02kSZNaa	yes it is possible because they take care of u and u like it along with them.|`|hBFSQ9bbaa	because your mind is lucid in the chair and your secure sharing vulnerable parts of yourself and this mysterious person who nods and asks question is accepting of you and keeps asking questions, giving you attention you get no where else.|`|9db58f2a42761d62ac1f4b75ccc601bbaa	I'm straight and have only had much older female therapists, so I've never expirienced that. If it happens I imagine its because you two are sharing an emotional connection. I always share emotional connections with my therapists, its impossible not to when I'm telling her my feelings and she's doing all she can to relate to me and help me. When two people connect emotionally, often the physical attraction follows suit. Its natural and humanistic. Humans are basically programmed to want to fall in love with whoever they become spiritually connected with, especially if its someone of the opposite sex. I can't say I'm positive of this, but this is my theory based on my expirience with my various long-term psychiatrists.|`|4fb0f251d83afb740be8e45e4f702006aa	i imagine it could have something to do with a person confiding and feeling secure with their therapist, and in turn relating those feelings to mutual understanding and than feeling attracted by that and not the actual person.|`|bHRjEHFtaa	You trust the Therapist with your deepest secrets, you feel that they are a friend.    They are doing a job, If they are attractive it's natural to look and feel. We're all human. If it becomes a concern duscuss it before it becomes a problem. Best idea is act like an adult and think of your therapist as a doctor. If your therapist is making the moves, get a new one.
AA10446296	That's an interesting point of view...  But is the feeling of not needing to prove yourself a sign of an inferiority complex or a superiority complex : ) ?  I see the definition says the person is very discouraged. That can not be a happy state.  Of course there are people who are brought up to be meek. And then they might feel they are doing the right thing and enjoy it. But the truth is that doing the right thing actually makes them feel superior not inferior.  So it is the feeling of superiority that makes them happy.|`|VwdZiRmTaa	Inferiority complex is also taken as Humbleness; and at the same time self degrading.

FJPacbJQaa	The Oxford English Dictionary has a more real definition.    feminism  2. [After F. fminisme.] Advocacy of the rights of women (based on the theory of equality of the sexes). (Cf. WOMANISM.)      See, no reference to men's rights.    Similarly,  child  1. a. The unborn or newly born human being; f{oe}tus, infant. App. originally always used in relation to the mother as the fruit of the womb.    When the application was subsequently extended, the primitive sense was often expressed by babe, baby, infant; but child is still the proper term, and retained in phrases, as with child, to have a child, child-birth, the verb to child, etc.      Your definition of child is accurate.      What's real interesting is that it is a country which prohibits abortion which has the safest maternity statistics in the world and it may be related to the fact that abortion is illegal.

EDIT  Ok. Thanks for clarifying.|`|OWbMSMNraa	The purpose of a dictionary is to provide clear, unambiguous meanings of words so that they can be used accurately and in the proper context.  If a word in the dictionary can be interpreted multiple ways, that is not a clear definition and it needs to be revised (in all dictionaries).    If most dictionaries provide the same or very nearly the same definition for a word, how likely is it that the definition is incorrect?    A dictionary definition is typically only considered incorrect when a person doesn't agree with the definition.|`|AA12161166	If we go by this dictionary definition of feminism, I would say that over 85% of the population, male and female would be considered feminist.

Prima di tutto, il rispetto e' qualcosa che tu devi avere in te , per te medesima! Se tu non ti rispetti, per esempio facendo qualcosa che va contro il tuo pensare, solo per rispetto dell'altro, allora vai contro la tua Natura e inevitabilmente nasceranno dei conflitti! Per rispettare gli altri, devi prima di tutto imparare ad ascoltare i tuoi bisogno, senza calpestarli per far piacere agli altri! non devi avere paura dei conflitti : allora nascera' in te una sensazione di rispetto per cio' che sei! da qui..emanerai una dignita' tutta tua, che portera' le persone a rispettarti! E' in te che devi lavorare....ti rispetti veramente? Sai quali sono le cose che davvero ti fanno stare bene? Sei disposta a combattere anche se gli altri non la pensano come te( con cortesia per carita'..ma mai tirandosi indietro)?

E' tanto brutto quanto ingiusto ed anch'io, a 34 anni, mi faccio la tua stessa domanda. Purtroppo ci sono persone che non rispettano un accidente e approfittano del nostro riguardo calpestando caratteri e dignit. Queste sono le persone che non hanno un minimo di educazione, non conoscono quelle regole non scritte che servono per navigare in mezzo agli altri. Il rispetto  la prima cosa che andrebbe insegnata dai genitori, ma come hai notato tu, c' gente che non conosce i risultati che esso pu dare. E, quando ci si rispetta, i risultati si vedono. Eccome! Non dar retta a questi ignoranti, avranno le loro belle ricompense! Si tratta di imparare a risponder loro a tono senza perdere la nostra stima e il nostro decoro. Tranquilla, a volte non vale nemmeno la pena di prenderli in considerazione!|`|e3e93c5645364b156187ae67ac15e04caa	Sai credo di capirti ma per l'esperienza che ho io il rispetto e come tu mi insegni che si ottiene sopratutto rispettando, ma deve anche essere meritato e chi non lo merita non deve essere cosi fortunato da riccevere comunque il rispetto altrui.  Oltretutto il rispetto deve essere anche posto in vari modi assecondo dell'attimo e di cosa viene svolto con la persona interessata.

JlkWt3Evaa	You're only 20. I had no idea what I wanted to be doing when I was 20. I didn't even figure it out until I was like 24.  I dropped out of college, partied till I was 22, then got clean and realized I wanted to be a microbiologist. My parents pressured me too and forced me to go to college... big mistake. I wasn't ready.  You are barely old enough to make the decision with what you want to do for the rest of your life. I've seen so many people go into college after high school, get a degree in something then realize they hate it... Don't sweat it. You will find yourself. I say you need to experience something besides community college.  If traveling is an option (even within your own country) I would do it.

It is hard to try to get a sense of direction when you are tired and depressed.  It seems like you need to treat that first before you try to make big decisions with you life.

The best way to do that is to remind yourself of all the things you have and do no matter how small. Understand that you have control of your life, not anybody else. Your family pushes you because they care about you. That means you are special to them and even if they don't tell you to your face, it's true or they would leave you alone. Start everyday by telling yourself, in the mirror, that you are someone who matters, that you will do your best today, and that you owe it to yourself, not anyone else, to be happy. I know it should cheesy but it works. It will take some time to climb out of the funk, but you have already taken the first step, wanting to do it. Next, start eating better, no junk food, it causes depression, get some exercise, it helps boost mood and focus. Also try getting some hobbies, no matter how small, like carving wood or something with your hands. Creating is a wonderful way to make put yourself into something and take your mind off of the daily grind. If all else fails, remember that there are millions of people worse off than you and you have a unique opportunity to get an education while your young. Embrace all that comes at you as a welcome challenge, not a boring obstacle.|`|Heux22X5aa	I'm kinda there too. College can be stressful, especially when you have other cares.

Everything just seemed to get worse and I didnt feel like doing anything. Then my aunt invited me to Cabo San Lucas on day and after I got back I was totally rejuvenated!      Take a break from your life, forget college, forget ex girlfriends/boyfriends/family for a few days, leave all your stress at home and go somewhere to clear your thoughts (even if its just a nice hotel in your city) Go somewhere you've never been with a person you care about.

I'm 25 now, and have, within the past year, become a much more motivated, driven individual.   I was always a night person. From the time I was a kid, I would stay up late.. After high school I had what I refer to as "My Lost Years." Due to my laziness, I put off going to college. I ended up going to parties every night, getting home late and not going to bed until 4 or 5 in the early morning. I would often sleep until 4 or 5 in the afternoon.. Just in time to get up, get something to eat, get a shower and get to partying! Although this life seemed awesome at the time, it was by no means fulfilling or satisfying. I mean, I slept on my dad's couch for 3 years. I spent more time asleep than awake. I blamed this on the medicine that I take for seizures. That, along with depression, may have added to the problem, but certainly didn't cause it. About 2 years ago, I moved in with my mom and got a third shift job. I met a girl there and we started dating. I worked there for a year and quit to go back to school. It was soooo difficult to get my schedule in some sort of balance.   I moved in with my girlfriend and her two kids, and started going to bed before 4am so I could wake up before noon. Slowly, but surely, I began to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day. Having this regular schedule not only helps me stay motivated and awake, but also helped me climb out of my depression.  I coulbn't have done any of if without my girl. She's been the  ! factor in making me grow up. She supports me and has faith in me!  In summary, the two things that helped me get over my laziness:  [1] I Fell in love with a beautiful, loving, smart woman who supports me.  [2] I got on a regular schedule. It took a while but, it happened.    Good luck! It's a tough road, but you can do it..Trust me, If I did, you can|`|9faf164b8bfd02a8adbd83229d74816baa	talk to me on AIM or yahoo.

Just take things day by day and go at your own pace. You may not know what to do with yourself now but in time you will. You shouldn't force yourself to be decisive because in many cases when someone is and chooses something for themselves they grow disappointed if they don't follow through because they came across something else that caught their eye.    Also, maybe the reason you get so depressed easily is your not doing something that really interests you. If you were you'd be happy and very much enthralled. Think about the major you have now and exactly why you chose that major, then take a look at other majors and see which one really catches your interest. Do some research on it and if you're still interested, switch majors.    Good luck with everything.|`|PYyUvN05aa	1. Find what interests you.  Get a fun job.

Call one for an appointment to see if you can take a test that assesses your personality type and abilities.  When I took it many years back in LA, it was about $500 and took about 2 hours to finish.  After taking it, the psychologist assessed pretty accurately what kind of person I am and where my emotional/mental strengths/weaknesses lie.      Along the way, she can help you understand yourself.  If you have the $ to burn, go ahead with it and set up an appointment.    3. Hang out.  Socialize.

Trust me I have walked in your shoes and it sucks. Depression is a very difficult thing to understand as a person that has it, what I mean by that is most of us will not admit we are depressed, but you can feel better about yourself and life. You just need to make the decision to get some help and find out what is really going in your head, and trust me you cant do it buy  yourself, you need to see a doctor or a counselor it will really help you. I went through what you are going through a long time ago and I got help and my life is so much better today and has been. Something that may help is there are a lot of good books out there you can reed that will help, Your Best Life Now by Joel Osteen and The Secret To True Happiness by Joyce Meyer. You are very young and you have a long life to live why not enjoy every day and be happy with who you are as the person you born to be. Good luck life is a wonder full thing it's up to you to take care of yourself to enjoy it, know one else will do it for you.

It is every store's or company's way of employee safety to do these background checks so they can know who they are employing, for example they would like to know if that employee was an ex-pot dealer.

wnI04x8Kaa	Man vs. Technology is a theme in literature that places a character against technology.    Frankenstein is often considered the classic exposition of this theme, with a scientifically-created human becoming a destructive monster.    It is also a common theme in science fiction, with The Terminator and The Matrix being popular examples. Another example would be in "2001: A Space Odyssey" when Frank and Dave battle their flight computer, the HAL 9000.
GRAE6K1iaa	Free market economy: Where households own resources and free markets allocate resources through the workings of the price mechanism.  An increase in demand raises price and encourages firms to switch additional resources into the production of that good or service.  The amount of products consumed by households depends on their income and household income depends on the market value of an individuals work. In a free market economy there is a limited role for the government. Indeed in a highly free market system, the government limits itself to protecting the property rights of people and businesses using the legal system, and it also seeks to protect the value of money or the value of a currency.   Planned or command economy:  In a planned or command system typically associated with a socialist or communist economic system, scarce resources are owned by the state (i.e. the government). The state allocates resources, and sets production targets and growth rates according to its own view of people's wants.  The final income and wealth distribution is decided by the state. In such a system, market prices play little or no part in informing resource allocation decisions and queuing rations scarce goods.

If she comes from a Muslim country or some other country where men are very strict towards women, she'd probably feel very liberated.

She's not Muslim, but she's from a country where it's part of the accepted culture for men to beat their women, etc. In the US it's not acceptable. And, my dad is a pretty easy-going guy, believes in equality, etc. She feels very liberated with him and is glad to be living in America.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	I don't know about the US but I did read a newspaper article in which they interviewed a foreign bride brought here to marry a Brit.

If European, Australian etc. I doubt that this would change much as culturally we are very similar.    If you are talking about women from countries where women are still bought up to accept themselves as the submissive sex e.g. parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle East then one would expect them with their exposure to American culture to question her preconceived role.

It's a GEM when you're considering a career path.      One thing to remember is that you are interested in certain subjects, so if you can find a job promoting, say, football (if you're a fan), or teaching music (if you're in to the arts), then you'll have more fun, and be better at it.    Jobhuntersbible.com is the website for the author of "What Color is Your Parachute."    ONET is an AWESOME resource for DETAILED job descriptions of ALL KINDS of jobs.
aLwrpMPXaa	Bob, I had a career for many years. As a matter of fact, after graduating from College, I thought "a career" is all I wanted to have. I met my husband at 29 and at 30, gave it all up to be home, and raise our children. I've traveled all over the World, met numerous people and live in NY now. I have been a stay at home mom since 9 years so far and I wouldn't ever go back to the Corporate World and it's life style. I live in this country since 12 years, (both of my and hubby's family live overseas) and being able to stay at home and raise my two children, not only has been the greatest challenge of my life, it has taught me so many other things I've never even learned in College. I am able to "take care of people who I love and who love me" and there simply is not greater satisfaction. I don't always like my job but this is a choice my husband and me have discussed and made. I hear  almost everyday "mom, I love you" and I do also hear too many "why" but no one, told me to do this. I wanted it for myself and I have the privilege to be able to stay at home however, I have the out most respect, for mothers, who have to juggle both. Working outside, coming home and take care of their home !|`|YQOT68xFaa	I get to spend time with my kids. More than my poor hubby who has a career. He works because he has to in order for us to survive; if he could work from home he'd do it in a heartbeat so he could spend more time with us.    It enables us to homeschool our kids, which is very important to hubby and I.    We have no fights or arguments about chores and responsibilities. I do almost all of it since I'm home and have time. It gets done when it needs doing, without a fuss.    Home cooked meals are easier since I have more time to do it.    I don't have to do some boring office job, working for a boss who really doesn't care much about me at all.     I am in charge of my day. I can do what I like and make my own schedule.        ADD  "  so as for married women with children who work outside and earn money,    means they're doing things 3x than men do. (marriage+children+profession)"    Nonsense. The husband is doing the same thing. He works on his marriage too, he is a father to his kids, and he has a job. Men aren't accessories while women do it all, you know! Men contribute just as much and are every bit as vital to the family as the woman is.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	Traditional women?  Hm.  I'm a feminist and was a stay at home mother.  But to answer your question:  I wanted to be the one to look after my children.  I believe strongly that children should be brought up in their own homes.  I wanted my children to be brought up according to my beliefs and my ideals.  I didn't want my children dragged out in the middle of winter to a child minder, especially if they were ill.  As they grew older, I wanted to enjoy the school holidays with them, to be here when they were ill, inset days, snow days, no heating in school days, etc etc.  I regard my children as my responsibility and my duty.  I love being with them.  The downside is that I have no pension to speak of.|`|0UCq5LgRaa	Often times, men have an issue with their wife being a woman of power. A male takes it upon himself to "bring home the bacon" so to speak, to make the money and secure the lifestyle, while the wife is meant to stay at home maintaining it and caring for the children. Even in the animal kingdom, the males will generally go out and catch food to bring home to the mother and children.|`|NYU37jfGaa	It satisfies me because the idea of 'juggling' doesn't appeal to me at all.  I tried this when my oldest son was a baby, and it was not a happy experience.  I like being at home with the children.  It is especially convenient when, as happened recently, there is a spate of illness in the family.  First me, then no3 son, then no.2 son, then my husband, all came down in turn with a stomach bug.  Because I didn't have to work I didn't have to worry about taking time off when I was ill myself, and when my children were ill, and I was able to look after my sons and then my husband without any stress or anxiety that would have come with me having to take time off work.    Besides, I was never career orientated even before I married.  If I had never married at all, I would never ever have had a career anyway, just a job.  Like many others (men as well as women) I am simply not a career person.|`|JSbLnryzaa	lol. im no house wife,   babe.|`|AhRRhe1Yaa	Security, safety of the home.|`|URsRqqCcaa	if u havent noticed not all women stay at home  i dont believe in it  and when i am older and get  married  i will certianly not be a stay at home wife.|`|096b7gBHaa	it confuses me a lot when "mother" can be termed as a profession.    it's like when they say...  "she an artist and a mother"  "she's a businesswoman and a mother"  "she's an athlete and a mother"    as if like women have their own predetermined career awaits them from the day they were born, while the men have to find their owns'  when they're already grown up    although i don't like to take things this way, coz women have to find knowledge and men have to be able to do houseworks in order to be real independent    so as for married women with children who work outside and earn money,     means they're doing things 3x than men do. (marriage+children+profession)  which might also mean that they're seeking 3x superiority instead of equality    whereas stay at home wife&mom s are doing as equal as the men   (if the their husbands also do houseworkx s. if not it means the SAHM's are superior than the men since they're doing 2xmore)    but for the women who do things 3x more as mentioned above,  if minus kids (as how it common among feminists today),  then it'll be 2x more than the men's    if minus kids and marriage then it'll be as equal but..these women at the end of the day have to against their own nature of will in order to gain that kind of 'equality'    so in the end it's just the same, but rather better for the SAHM's|`|qKkTI0jnaa	I'm in my third year of college & more traditional than a lot of my female peers. I am studying to become a schoolteacher and while I am not against having a career (c'mon I went to college), I think that it important for a woman especially to stay at home to nurture & watch her children grow. That in & of itself is a labor of love. That's not to say that there don't have to be stay-at-home fathers but I would much rather stay at home w/ my children than pay high $$ to send them to a daycare where chances are, the caretakers don't give a crap about them.|`|gTjtaG0Faa	Since quitting my job and staying home full time we eat healthier, spend less, and have less fights.  I used to come home from a long hard day to have to take care of a baby, a home and cook dinner. By the end of the night I would be so angry and tired that it didn't matter that it was not my husbands fault he was the one I took it out on.    Now life is simpler we down sized from being a two car family to one, add in the fact that we don't spend the money on car insurance and up keep, fast food for when I was to tired to cook and the cost of day care we are saving money with me being at home.  On top of which our home is cleaner, kids happier, marriage a thousand times better I would never ever go back.
XOnSRoR2aa	I am definitely not a sociology expert, and I am currently halfway asleep, so this may wind up just being my fingers typing randomness on the screen rather than giving you the answer you are looking for, but I'll give it a go.     There has always been a stratification between the classes, and at various times in history it has been more pronounced. This is one of those times. My visualization is of the Titanic and the differences between the first class passengers and those below deck and all the ones on the levels in between. Metaphorically speaking, our economy is heading towards an iceberg, and a I think a feeling of panic is setting in. People on all the levels below the top one are resentful of the greed and excess they witness going on at that one when they are worried about their very survival. Right now my brain is too fuzzy to remember all the details (I'll edit them in later if I have the time), but there have been several cases of almost bewildering corporate greed lately. Stories about executives going on expensive retreats right after laying off thousands of workers from their company, or hosting expensive Super Bowl parties when they are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy have been in the news a lot lately. There was also the case of the executive who spent an astonishing amount of money redecorating his office after approving the lay off of many workers. Using the Titanic metaphor, that would be like filling ten lifeboats with your luggage while people were standing there desperate for a spot. Or like when Marie Antoinette said "let them eat cake" and kept dancing on in her pretty gowns as people starved on the streets. Eventually a mob came for her. I also remember reading about the board of directors at American University in Washington DC giving the president a golden parachute despite the enormous protest from the students and staff a couple of years ago after he'd audaciously used university funds to pay for a personal chef and expensive trips abroad and other private expenses. If a janitor at the school had stolen money from them or taken supplies to use at his house he would have been fired and possibly arrested, so people were outraged that the university president was treated with a $1 million +compensation package for essentially the same act.   As a result of the golden parachute, tuition rates probably were increased, so others had to pay the consequences of his actions.     The reason the economy is so poor right now isn't entirely because of corporate greed, but it's a part of it. People bought houses that they really couldn't afford because mortgage companies and banks were greedy for their business, and so even though the blame doesn't fall solely on either party, it probably feels better to put it on the shoulders of a company rather than on your own.     My brain is starting to beep that the battery is running low. I'll edit the names of companies I referenced above later on when it's fully charged if the question is still open.     peace|`|jNQbVDHSaa	from time immemorial, it has been about haves and have nots lords and serfs, nobility and the proletariat!|`|LELGscJFaa	Hee Amy, I've noticed something.. there are categories of people...    doctor, singers, accountants    and the thing is that society tries to put us in one of these boxes.  All we have to do is go around talking about what we want, and people say "Hey, I know a person who does that!"  And then that's hooked up.    You are right about HR... the HR concept is really bizarre.    Here's the reason why HR is no longer relevant:  HR takes what they want, and they put you into the box (Resume, Cover letter, Interview).  It is a negative situation.    The thing to do is, instead of interviewing around and chasing a job... to create it yourself.  Think about what you want, baby it, nurse it, and it comes to be :)    Yes a new attitude is emerging :)

81c1606e8b69fbf385e8ccb9d683032eaa	because IQ tests were actually designed to distinguish between kids with mental retardation and normally developing kids, and the creators of the test never anticipated errors in the other direction.  historically, IQ tests are simply an indicator of potential for learning, but at some point the American school system adapted these tests as methods of screening children out of gifted programs which created a learning gap between children of normal IQ and those with higher IQs.  I agree with you that it is a total mistake, and undermines the potential that many children have for learning.  the other thing people need to understand is that IQ tests are not 100% reliable, and they may not even be valid! your IQ scores can change from day to day, year to year, etc...|`|i6Q19FwUaa	well, officially u are a genius if your IQ is over 140...but, you can be a cooking or a musical genius without having a high IQ...i myself have an IQ of 154 but I'm not musical at all, so i guess it isn't really connected...plus, most geniuses have a need to collect unnecessary information...
LfM6p8Bnaa	Here is the Interpretation of your Dream:    There are many parts of the dream that may very well be true.  I think you actually got a glimpse of the holding tank for souls that need to be processed.   The creatures you saw were either part of this creation or another creation of eternities past.  Everyone has to be judged but the one who judges them self will NOT be judged by God because he/she would already judged them self.   There is always a review of ones life when passing into eternity.  The part about seeing yourself many sexes and or species simply means that either other entities where latched onto you and became your character or personality or you were duplicated over the multiverse.  I believe your dream to be prophetic but it should also show that you need to be very careful on your choices you make.   If you do not have any Godly knowledge or Wisdom it would behoove you to start asking God before it is too late.  You have been greatly blessed in dreaming what you dreamed.

Or perhaps it was an epic dream. Epic dreams (also known as Great Dreams or Cosmic Dreams) are so huge, so compelling, and so vivid that you cannot ignore them. The details of such dreams remain with you for years, as if your dreamt it last night. These dreams possess much beauty and contain many archetypal symbology.  When you wake up from such a dream, you feel that you have discovered something profound or amazing about yourself or about the world. It feels like a life-changing experience.

If something is getting me down I try to think about it reasonably and objectively without over-analysing it and see if I am reacting unnecessarily and usually find that I've really not got as good a reason as I'd come to think, or even completely lost sight of what it was that got me down in the first place.  If its just one of those moods that come seemingly out of the blue I run. Listen to upbeat techno, which is what I like to run to, and run until the endorphins make me happy. Then I have a nice shower and relax in the calm emotional backwaters you find yourself in on the other side of a hard workout.  Or watch random interesting youtube clips.  Or comedy I've downloaded - if I'm in a really dark mood then dark, politically incorrect satire, the kind that produces smirks rather than outright laughter is cool.  I also often get drunk with a person who's good at making me laugh, or write about whats happening to clarify my thoughts (journal or blog), or have sex.

If you are afraid of the snake, then it signifies your fears of sex, intimacy or commitment. The snake may also refer to a person around you who is callous, ruthless, and can't be trusted. As a positive symbol, snakes represent healing, transformation, knowledge and wisdom. It is indicative of self-renewal and positive changes.

He will be pulled in the false pretense of this distraction what will be meticulously manufactured.  I would look carefully at work where work can be a kind a hole that we all are captured in.  Be careful to not be so trusting in the next couple of weeks but be cunning and calculating.   When you see the snake pounce on it and call it a snake...because that is what it is.

Sometimes when near-traumatic things happen to us we tend to brush it off as something unimportant. This is a defensive move on our part since we don't want or are not yet ready to deal with the psychological effect of the situation. The next stage here is to become numbed. That is what you are in now. You feel like a robot because you have blocked your emotions...especially those that you cannot deal with right now. The best way to cure this is to face these unresolved emotions. This is the only way to free yourself from these ghost or else it will manifest itself in a different way and affect you permanently.

When you dream begins you are shopping, which has to do with all of the possibilities and choices available to use in life. In your dream you were having fun at a fair. This represents your life being a fun experience with lots of opportunities.    Next, there is a woman standing near you. To see a woman in your dream, represents nurturance, passivity, caring nature, and love. It refers to your own female aspects or may also represent your mother. Alternatively, it may indicate temptation and guilt. You are afraid that this woman is going to "put you in jail", which could indicate fear in your waking life of your nurturing/passive/caring personality leading you into a situation where you feel trapped.     To dream that you are being chased signifies that you are avoiding a situation that you do not think is conquerable. It is often a metaphor for some form of insecurity. To dream that you are in a jungle signifies aspects of yourself and your personality that may be inhibited. You may be experiencing some chaos and unpredictable circumstances in your waking life. Consider the phrase "it's a jungle out there!"      To dream that you are sleeping can mean that you are ignorant and not fully aware of the conditions and circumstances around you.    I think that your subconscious is telling you to be more assertive and to not allow others to take advantage of you and spoil the fun in your life!

xV4qOG4Iaa	I do believe in God and that things didn't get here by themselves, as you said He is here within us our hearts, and i think that we all must believe in something, and i would rather believe in something than nothing because without that what have we got, and i do not think it right that others have the right to tell us what or who we should believe in. If it is alright i would like to know what you thought of what i said thank you.|`|dAfgR2xgaa	Wow, you're retarded. Let me just ask you this...    You believe... that when you die... some guy will meet you in front of the pearly gates of heaven, judging you, telling you if you go to heaven or hell? You've been brainwashed, seriously! I feel sorry for the kids who have to grow up in christian schools, it's like... ""christian camp.""  It just sounds extremely ridiculous. It pretty much means, have faith, because you might be cold dirt, or drinkin' a cold one with God and the angels. I bet you haven't even read the bible. Did you know that if you have a scar you can't go to heaven? What happens to the premature dead baby's out there? Or the different colored ones? Or gay people? Or someone with no leg? Apparently, they're all screwed. I guess i am too, because i have a scar! Don't preach that to you, do they? Only the happy stuff. Did you know church's were originally unallowed to be built? That taking money from people was unchristian?     So ridiculous.    I'll live my life happy, kind, and without god.|`|X7i1iGhgaa	Nice rant. What's your question?

The auto (not just fuel, but parts),  Also, fertilizers that grow your food.  Also, the seeds themselves have been genetically engineered so they need the fertilizers from oil to grow.  Many do not realize how incorporated oil has become in our daily lives and how dependent the human race has come to demand the use of all these products from home, office, medical, space, etc.
bVa3Ir7xaa	Anger fuels adrenalin, not to mention a bunch of other natural responses. In certain circumstances it's a good thing, but for everyday work it can definitely get in the way.    The flow of chemicals in the body does effects a person's ability to sit still or focus on their work. It's nicknamed the fight or flee response for a reason.     Just work on those anger issues and you'll change over time. It's not something that can be fixed at the moment it happens.  Just allow your body to adapt to the kind of work your doing and eventually you'll be able to focus better without getting frustrated.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Definitely you need to find a positive outlet for yr anger, such as ball sports or jogging.

72H4hFaHaa	Congratulations! I bet it took quite an effort to get there.  Whatever helped you conquer your fear: keep practicing.  You know the saying: use it or lose it.  If you keep going with what works for you, you'll never have to worry about unreasonable fear again.    Whenever I get a twinge of fear of failure I picture a baby learning how to walk:   It falls and gets up again - and again - and again..............

I think it's really important you start with small things you feel most comfortable with, and realise that if you do happen to 'fail' with something along the way, it is ok. Keep reinforcing whatever helped you to overcome in the first place. Goodluck.|`|AA10200409	Wow congratulations! I know what you have done is no small thing for sure.    To retain your power, help others and create. Maybe it's best that you contact you local Habitat for Humanity and build homes for those who wouldn't have one but for you and others who help build. You meet lots of great people there too.    Whatever you do, remember this: Our reason for being here is to help others.    Enjoy your new life!|`|uPFRukGNaa	set yourself some realistic yet decently hard goals that you'll have to work hard for...the feeling only gets better!

yOeLBIPaaa	1.Because it was something I was passionate about and at this point in time its what I want to do for the rest of my life although 10 to 15 years down the track I might be ready for a change.    2. Explain to my superior that it is running late and hand in the good copy of what I have done then finish the rest as quickly as possible but of good quality. Although I don't see why I would be running late unless something major like a death of immediate family member or best friend. Perhaps even an illness.    3. I would talk to them about it and if they don't pull there weight then I would tell my Superior because I won't be pushed into doing all the work for someone who is too lazy to do it themselves    Just curious, why are you asking this?|`|85d25c63c9c8d4e4ad0e4c097927a33faa	I don't think the psychology category is the best place to get someone to do your homework for you :)

I know how it feels when you are surrounded by friends, but you feel so alone. If i was you I would see a school counsellor, or maybe talk to a trusted adult about your problems, and allow them to take you somewhere to have therapy or counselling if you really feel you need it...I know that sounds big, but honestly, you need some guidance and support. At the moment, I am depressed but I see a school counsellor from time to time, and i can also talk to my girlfriend about things. Maybe you should try to open up a little more to the girl, form a close bond, start of little by little, these things take time.

Also, talk to your girl about all of this. I'm sure she would be more then happy to help you through all of this. Believe me, it could be so much worse. Be strong, the dark cloud will pass, things will look up, im sure you have people in your life to talk to, so talk to them. And don't dwell on things in the past.

You just need to pick yourself up, dust yourself off and get on with life as you know it.    Last year, I broke my finger, had my step children living with me not paying rent, had three water leaks in my house,t my washing machine, dish washer and water heater all died.  To top that off, we had a hail storm that killed my roof and my husbands truck.  The icing on the cake is my own daughter won't talk to me any more as her boyfriend won't let her.    Started out this year just the same.  Slit my wrists on vacuum equipment and my husband might loose his job.    Let's top all that off with the fact that I'm going thru menopause, lost 40 lbs (so I'm dead skinny), can't sleep normal and I've been sick for two months.    We all have our crosses to bear during life.  Life is like living in Hill country Texas (where I am)  It's all ups and downs.  Like the old saying goes "When life hands you lemons".....    Figure out about your girl, grieve for your friend and study.  Sometimes a day at the beach alone on the hood of your car just thinking works wonders.  Helps to clear your mind.    Depression will only bring you down further into more of a depressed state.  Email me if you ever feel the need to talk to someone.  And always remember...There are People out there who love you and care about you.|`|vLG32pwTaa	You have reached out for help, there is strength number one!  You are honest to yourself about levels of commitment that you are ready or not ready for, strength number two!  Studying and preparing is exhausting enough on its own but you are doing it, strength number three!   Maybe you are a stronger person than you thought? Let that hold you up as you experience the loss of your friend, and let that inner strength give you the right words to say to your girlfriend, having thought over whats right for you at this time first.   Feeling alone....can be good if you want it but not so good if you don't. If you don't want to be alone then maybe physically chat with some friends. Bit like a brick wall....Every time you bottle something in it will be one brick and before you know it, you have a towering wall around you and it gets difficult to climb over. Keep talking!|`|m5aenb6qaa	learn to prioritize your problems. and take steps one by one. if your think the solutions for all the problems at the same time then you will surely get more depressed.|`|AA12151161	I suggest you find a helping Professional.

A feeling of safety to do so would help. Internalizing is like lashing within that can hurt a person physically and emotionally. Try to cry when you have total privacy.

Crying is a cleansing of the soul. Loosen up. If all else fails try God, in my opinion. take care and stay strong.

AA10558731	A best friend is like a four leaf clover, hard to find and lucky to have.    Some people make the world a special place just by being in it.    Best friends are the siblings God forgot to give us.    When it hurts to look back, and you're scared to look ahead, you can look beside you and your best friend will be there.    True friendship never ends. Friends are forever.    Good friends are like stars: You don't always see them, but you know they are always there.    Most people walk in and out of your life, only friends leave footprints in your heart. Everything is okay in the end. If it's not okay, then it's not the end.    Relationships are a lot like tables: one leg is love, one is trust, one is shared pleasures, and one is shared dreams. Lasting relationships need all four legs for balance, to hold up the burden of your troubles. (In my case, though, I'll never get rid of that irritating wobble...)    Friendship is the finest balm for the pangs of despised love.  ~~Jane Austen    Hatred ever kills, love never dies. Such is the vast difference between the two. What is obtained by love is retained for all time. What is obtained by hatred proves a burden in reality for it increases hatred.  ~~Mohandas K. Gandhi|`|1df0ad311fbe59f9d01e90f00f853835aa	its good|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	To have a true friendship, is a blessing from God. A true friend is very hard to find.

Cristo fue el mejor regalo que nos di Dios, pero ante todo era un hombre, el mejor, pero un hombre. Si se cas lo nico que hizo fue santificar el matrimonio, si tuvo una hija, nos dej un legado ms. El amor nunca ensucia a nadie, antes lo enaltece. Lo que haya hecho la Iglesia no afecta en nada la figura de Cristo, l brilla por luz propia, la Iglesia existe gracias a l no al revez.

San Pedro si estuvo casado porque el evangelio habla de la suegra de Cefas o sea Pedro, y en las exigencias de Cristo esta dejar esposa, padres e hijos pero habla de un aspecto espiritual.    La madre de Jess nunca lo abandono alli estuvo al pie de la Cruz como cualquier madre digna de ese nombre.

Jess era judo y como judo tenia que respetar la leyes y para esos a?os los hombres se casaban a los16 o 17 a?os y las chicas a los 13,14 o 15. Y ponen a Mara Magdalena como prostituta para desvincularla de Jess pero si nos ponemos a pensar por que Mara Magdalena estaba cerca de Jess y de Mara su madre en momentos tan importante en la vida de cristo momentos en solo una esposa estara???

AA10415940	Behavioral therapies are more effective at phobias than most anything.  The most popular of these types of therapies are systematic desensitization.  In this type of therapy, the person is taught cognitive (thinking) ways to cope and then is progressively exposed to the stimulus.  Example, if you fear heights you will initially have to think about scary situations.  Then move up to having a ladder in the room.  Then moving closer to it.  Then stepping on first step and gradually higher and higher.      Another method is called flooding which actually has some success.  Imagine u fear snakes.  You would be put into a chamber filled with them to be flooded with fear to help u overcome it.  Problem is some people go and have heart attacks in the mean time...lol.

Autos: tienen su riesgo, pero es la persona la que decide respecto de si misma. En ellas siempre se aplica nueva tecnologa y hace avanzar la industria automovilstica y la seguridad.    Boxeo: entre dos personas anda el asunto, pero la avaricia econmica y el afn de ganar y de venganza hace que los espectadores disfruten del xito de uno-derrota del otro, exteriorizando la propia agresividad. Los boxeadores suelen quedar "tocados" cerebralmente.    Toros: El torero ya sabe a lo que va y el riesgo, pero aqu el problema esta en el toro, que lo han obligado a meterse ah, que sea fiero, y que le torturen y maten sin que el lo haya pedido.  Realmente es una salvajada para el animal.    De todas maneras hay gente para todo. Pero para mi el boxeo tendra que hacerse con unas normas de seguridad mucho ms grandes, y ante el menor sntoma de lesin cerebral, fuera.    El toreo, si que lo prohibira o por lo menos la tortura y muerte del animal.  En Espa?a hay muchsimos pueblos y ciudades en que el todo es parte integrante de la fiesta y la tradicin.

Incominco a correre nella mia corsia,il giorno naturalmente stava anche piovendo,mi metto tra le 2 macchine,d un colpo,sterzo per mettermi in mezzo a loro 2,perdo il controllo e sbatto nel muretto di protezione della corsia,vedevo le scintille uscire dalla macchina stile fast-furious,riesco a tenere la macchina e non fare il testa-coda,mi fermo nella corsia d'emergenza, eravamo tutti silenziosi,spaventati.  Esco dalla macchina (nuova), guardo cosa avevo fatto,e gli avevo fatto tutta la fiancata.  Il giorno dopo,siccome non potevo dire che mi ero ubriacato ai miei genitori, gli ho detto che mi aveva attraversato la strada un cane e per non ucciderlo,l'ho schivato e ho sbandato.

c08654fd5ed7d1ce714c62c30235857eaa	I have went to a few session. Those 'therapists' are not like any of those that we've seen on TV magic shows. They just keep speaking and giving instructions to you to relax in a near whispering voice. They all test that if your body is relaxed and still with a clear sound mind. It's like you're falling into sleep. They call it in a beta wave status.    If you're looking for a way to help you relax a bit and get the pressure from work released, it may worth for a try. But if you're seeking help from hypnotists for finding missing pieces of memories, forget it. It didn't work even a bit on me.

E' cos, lo hanno stabilito quando hanno inventato le regole grammaticali ( secondo me erano due uomini ubriachi, che scrivendo le regole, pensavano una cosa, poi passava qualche bella ragazza e stravolgevano gli scritti pensando "al femminile " )  O forse, come dice la storia dell'italiano, fu Dante, padre della nostra lingua, che era tanto innamorato di Beatrice che attribu tutte le emozioni al femminile.

Probabilmente il tuo ragazzo non vuole usare il preservativo perch prova un leggero fastidio e magari tu non te la senti di farti prescrivere la pillola dal ginecologo perch sei ancora molto giovane e ti sentiresti giudicata.

In pi, non hai protezione contro le malattie sessualmente trasmissibili (che non  solo l'HIV, ma anche l'HPV, la candida, la clamydia, la gonorrea...).

I suggest that you should read the book "How to Win Friends & Influence People" by Dale Carnegie.  If you read that already and don't feel any changes, it's fine to change yourself first.

But second, it's because your kind of insecure, and third you don't have anything else occupying your time, like a hobby or other friends that you really like hanging with. I don't think you need a physiological evaluation if you don't have those other things...you just need to get those. In the long run it makes you a happier more interesting person. So do those things for yourself.

AA10572269	Here are some tips that will help create more balance in your life while also decreasing depression. Hope this helps.    "GET OUT OF BED:     One of the most important things you can do is get up at about the same time every morning (even week-ends). Preferably, that means about 7 a.m. or earlier. You might not feel like it but Get Up. Such regularity helps your body function more normally so you're more likely to feel normal.     LIGHTS:     Light helps your body function better. So turn on a lot of lights as soon as you arise. Open curtains to get more sunlight. Better yet, go outdoors into the sunshine as soon as you can. Remove any eyewear so light will enter more readily (glass cuts out some of the sun's rays). But don't stare at the sun, of course.     MOVE:     Be active right away -- oxygenate! That means getting up and walking around your dwelling for five or 10 minutes, or perhaps riding an exercycle. Mild exercise gets the blood flowing and transports more oxygen throughout your body (especially to your brain), helping you feel mentally alert and alive.     MUSIC:     Select and play some energetic, happy music as you dress and have your breakfast. The audiovisual department of most libraries has albums and tapes you can check out.         BREAKFAST:     Begin your breakfast with protein (i.e., meat, eggs, peanut butter, nuts, cheese). When you get up, your body chemistry is ready to convert food, especially protein,into longlasting energy. To balance your most important meal of the day, add an orange or other fresh fruit and whole grain cereal or whole grain bread.     TALK WITH SOMEONE:     One of the quickest ways to beat the blues is to interact with others. You might not feel like doing that - you'd rather avoid people when blue. So make lt easier on yourself. Talk with someone you enjoy about a subject you enjoy so there is definite give and take.     And, force yourself to say "hello" to the persons next to you in class, those where you live, anyone around.     LIMIT CAFFEINE:     The long-term (four hours or so) effects of caffeine are depression. Try to limit coffee to no more than one cup in the morning. Coffee can make you more alert for an hour or so, but later you get an opposite reaction. Caffeine tends to increase the release of insulin in the blood, and insulin lowers the blood sugar level. When you have low blood sugar levels, you begin to feel less sure of yourself, and have low energy levels, which can lead to the blues or depression.     LIMIT SUGAR:     Sugar might give you an initial rush of energy, but within an hour or so the blood sugar level can become low, and when it's low you may feel low, too.     The caffeine/sugar cycle. It's easy to get caught in the caffeine and sugar cycle -- having coffee, caffeinated soft drinks, or something with sugar every two hours or so to "stay up." For example, cola contains about 10 teaspoons of sugar plus caffeine equal to about half a cup of coffee. In addition to bringing on the blues, this cycle can result in dependence, poor nutrition. and obesity -- reasons to get down on yourself even more and feel blue.     MAINTAIN FIBER:     Fiber helps food go through your digestive system at a proper rate, giving a more constant energy supply. Highly processed foods merely provide a quick surge of energy which can be followed by depression. You can maintain fiber in your diet by eating an orange or grapefruit rather than just drinking the juice. Eat fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and whole grain breads and cereals.     STRESS B COMPLEX:     Some persons report receiving help by taking a concentrated vitamin B complex. You'll find these called something like "Stress B" or "B 50." This is controversial.   Some nutritionists say, "Yes, this really should be considered," and others say, "No, this is not a good Idea." You can try some and decide whether or not it helps you. If it does help, then perhaps you should consult a nutritionist to see if there are other ways you can augment your diet.     ROUTINES:     Changing your routines is another way to help shake the blues. Choose a different combination of clothes to wear, walk rather than drive, take a different route, eat at a different place. Do something different to help break the routine.     It's hard. Getting up in the morning, turning on the lights, eating a nutritious breakfast, keeping busy--keeping such a schedule is not always easy.     You might need help for the first few days, someone to help you form good habits, get you out of bed. turn on the lights, make sure you have a good breakfast, someone to help you be more active. One good way is to make a contract with a friend or friends who want to see you change. It might seem embarrassing, but   those friends want to see you healthy and happy rather than depressed and difficult to be around. Note: If you feel that you need the help of someone for more than three or four days, you probably should make an appointment with a counselor or psychotherapist. You don't want to wear out your friends!     DEVELOP SUPPORTS:     Good old-fashioned support works wonders. Most of us have not developed "support systems." We need to think about that idea ahead of time, if we have the tendency to feel blue, so that the supports can be available when needed. Plan ahead by filling out the last section of this publication and keep it handy. In addition to developing your own resources, you might know of some community support groups for persons with the blues. Call the local mental health center to see if there are some groups you might be a part of. Some places to call for leads at K-State will be listed at the end of this brochure.     What do I do when I feel myself coming down with the |`|e6a9f39e931a3e787271baf127d1f6c5aa	Get to your doctor. Part of it can just be part of grief with the loo of your grandfather.

And happy driving in the rough terrain!|`|0cda4da51208783704bb74d27a9aa125aa	Then maybe it was time for your thinking to be challenged.  Figure out what is making you that way, and either accept it or change it.      When trying to sleep, try thought stopping.  This is where you yell out "STOP" when your mind keeps going on and on.  If you can't yell, then visualize a stop sign.....or a fat greasy construction worker with a hard hat and his belly hanging out  of his nasy jeans holding one of those paddles in front of a roadblock with blinking yellow lights.|`|3c40f4ab82ab4c707127a2e577a7800daa	It seems that sometimes when we lose a loved one that we get over it, but at times it can get us off track and its not as final as we think.

I found it good even though it seems to some people silly, to go to their resting place and talking to them. Just telling them how I feel and how I miss them.

You may think that you're over your grandfathers death but in reality you may not be entirely and with it being the holiday season, alot of people get depressed this time of year.  As long as you aren't having suicidal thoughts, give it a little time.  Do whatever you can to make yourself feel even a little better.

I am very sorry about your grandfather. Definitely find someone in your life to talk to and maybe visit your doctor. Exercise can help both insomnia and depression, and you may want to talk to your doctor about other ways. If you're still feeling lousy in a few weeks, you may want to talk to a counselor. Your doctor could refer you or there may be a non-profit agency near your home. Some people also find it helpful to talk to a faith leader such as a minister or rabbi. I've been through periods of depression, and believe me it can get better. I hope all goes well for you!|`|AA12076992	First off allow your self to grieve.      IN reality it takes at least a full year to start getting over the death of someone we care about.  To start feeling better.  A hundred years ago when you lost someone, depending on how close they were to you you were expected to were black and morn for a period of time.  This was not for society in general it was for the person who was morning.  It allowed you to publicly declare your sorrow when ever you needed to.  It made it so people could give you emotional support.      Now days you are given a couple days then expected to get back to business as usual.  They are dead now get over it!  But it really doesn't work that way.  We need time to morn to allow ourselves to morn. to feel supported by those close to us.      This is so soon after the death!  Allow your self to morn.  Morning helps us to adjust.  I am betting you will feel better.

If words were the real measure of personality, all politicians would be recognized as honest people who wish to serve the public in the best possible manner.    If by thinking you mean the "words" you process in your head -- no, that's got nothing to do with personality. Real thoughts are "feelings" and "unexpressed impulses" that come as response to the circumstances.     People who don't speak because they are "dumb", also have thoughts. The "words" you compose either in your head or "speech" are merely your own "composition". Real thoughts seldom come in words -- we learned to translate them into words when we learned the language.    Example:  A girl can scream "I hate you" at her lover out of coyness  -- because he teased her till she cried, which, if you know the meaning of "hate", should have never occurred to her. Thoughts and "words" you compose are mutually exclusive.    About the specific actions that represent personal values, well, you'll just have to observe people to learn more about that. No handbook for an "action to personal value" match exists as such.    (All my opinion -- based on a study of myself)|`|AA11890416	I don't accept people walking over me and I let them know it. It sometimes has bad consequences when I speak my mind on it but as they say 'Those that mind don't matter and those that matter don't mind' I would give my heart and soul for my family and close friends but I'm not a doormat.|`|AA11268185	Well first off, you don't "prove" your personal values you simply live them.  No need to worry about who notices or not.  There's an old adage that explains it pretty well, "Character is how you act when nobody is looking."    If your doing something you wouldn't normally do just so others notice or to prove something then its not one of your values.  If it makes you feel uneasy or awkward it may even be against your personal values.|`|534b37ca1c21eb53f4f53bb6f1415d7aaa	By sticking to it, even when no ones there to watch. Sounds silly. But, it's true.|`|AA12265902	by being kind to children  by being respectful to people  by offering a helping hand to someone in need  by helping new coworkers learn the things they need to learn, even when its not my job to do so  by offering encouragement and understanding to others,  by spending time listening and interacting with family members even when i am tired or would rather be doing something else  accepting people and enjoying the diversity of people  i strongly believe in "walk the walk of the talk you talk"|`|e8f3253812863de663d0fae4aa53ce67aa	no it is talking and walking that talk because in this world it takes a lot to have conviction and face the ridicule of others for standing up for what one believes in. it takes courage to put yourself out there. the only person we have to prove it to is ourselves because that is who we have to live with everyday and it is easier to live with someone you have respect for.
