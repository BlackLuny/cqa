It looks really good from the front but the profile looks horrible. Other than that girls say I'm gorgeous/hot/cute/stunning and if I just got a nosejob I would be perfect. I look a lot like Jesse Metcalfe...with a toucan beak. I really like this girl but she's really really hot, almost a 10/10 and I'm worried she will reject me because of my nose. Anyway, is this a deal breaker to you?

20090226193506AAtnG9r	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Why do teen girls wear UGGS?	Millions and millions of sheep r killed 2 make sheepkin UGGS      DO u wear UGGS?   will U stop buying them and wearing them???   Do u know that so many sheep have been killed that they can't keep up with demand. thats y there sold out   Will u stop wearing them now?       Do u feel sorry 4 the sheep?      Do you have to really kill the poor sheep just to make a pair of UGG boots?   The answer is YES. The sheep has to be slaughted to obtain their hide and fleece. Now once the sheepskin hides are taken from the sheep then the process of preparing the hide for manufacturers and ensuring the hides are up to export standard begins.       Woolskins are usually preserved with salt prior to being processed by tanneries. At the tannery the skins are processed in large vessels called paddles which vary in capacity from 3000 to 15000 litres. In contrast to hide processing, in woolskin processing mechanical action is kept to a minimum in order to minimise felting of the wool. Rotating blades on the paddles move the skins slowly and gently, and processing is performed at much higher float ratios (typically 20-35 litres of water per skin) than are used in hide processing.       Typically it takes about 10 working days for the skins to be tanned and finished ready to be cut into panels for ugg bootsUGG? Australia uses only the best quality sheepskin exclusively. Twin-faced sheepskin is used in many of our core products. A piece of twin-faced sheepskin has been treated on both the fleece side, and the skin side.      The wool of genuine sheepskin is extremely dense (more-so than any synthetic), which provides for a more comfortable and durable material.      Fleece breathes, wicks moisture away, and allows air to circulate, keeping feet dry.      Sheepskin is naturally water resistant & therefore small amounts of moisture will not seep through or damage it.      UGG? Australia sheepskin is naturally thermostatic & therefore will keep bare feet warm in temperatures as low as -30°F and cool in temperatures as high as 80°F (Sheepskin will naturally insulate by keeping feet warm in the winter & cool in the summer.)      The sheep that we use have finer wool & cleaner skin

20090226195828AAkua4S	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Will tanning kill me in this case?	Obviously I am aware of the dangers and risks of tanning and by no means have I ever made it a regular activity. In fact, I have only been tanning through one package which was for my senior prom 2 years ago. But my cousin's wedding is coming up in a few months and I was thinking about doing another package because I am the whitest Italian who ever lived! I burn very easily and have gotten a few serious sunburns in my life so tanning probably should be the last thing I wanna do, but seeing as it in extreme moderation, I'm wondering if I should bother doing it? I've heard that tanning once in a while isn't so bad, on the otherhand it may take just that one time that could trigger some sort of skin cancer for me in the future right? ps I use bronzer on my face and chest, but I think it'd be too difficult to bronze myself from head to toe and I also don't believe in spray tanning or tanning lotion!

20090226200450AAM6yAr	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	I want a piercing ...?	But my mother won't allow it. I'm currently trying to soften her to the idea.   She has said that she'll let me get a tattoo, but she won't let me get a piercing. and that' what I dont understand.    She's worried about the scaring a piercing MIGHT leave. But I think a tattoo is doing more damage to ones self, as it's permanent. ( Unless you get laser removal. ) But with a piercing, you'd just have to take it out and it'd heal up. You can never be sure if it'll leave a scar.   Now my question is;   How can I convince my mom that a piercing would be a better choice?

I keep trying to use Sally Hansen wax on my upper lip, and it only removes a little hair. Am I doing something wrong maybe? I followed the directions pretty well I think...do I just need to do it a few times in a row, or do I need to let the hair grow out more? I hope not-that kind of eliminates the purpose, if you have to walk around growing a moustache for a few days before you can wax.   I know shaving and hair removal creams work, but the hair grows back quickly and with a blunt end, making it appear darker. D:    I'm so incredibly embarrassed asking chick questions online. Help me out so I don't have to do it again please?   Also-is it true waxing will eventually make hair stop growing because it damages the follicles?

Do you prefer hair length at the chin or shorter, at the shoulders, or down the back? So short, medium or long hair?   White, tan, or brown skin?   Do you prefer tall, medium, or short women? Tall I guess say 6 feet or taller, medium height 5.5-5.11 feet, or short 5.4 feet or shorter?   Hazel, blue, brown, green, or grey eyes? or any other natural colored eyes that you think is attractive?   Do you prefer thin, athletic or curvy body type?   Do you like big chests or prefer smaller ones?   Do you always prefer real breasts, or does it not matter?   What is the most attractive physical part on a woman?

I have this really cute pair of hollister laguna skinny jeans. They are dark wash and I usually pair them up with some chestnut uggs which I tuck the jeans into. Anyway, I wanted to know something about the sizing. When I pull them on, it takes me at least five to ten minutes to get them and the crotch all the way up. They're skintight, at least, but then they feel like there sliding down as the day goes on. I mean, I love how tight and sleek they look on my legs, but I have a hard time wearing them to school cause I always have to pull them up. It just seems like every ten minutes, I have to put both hands back, flip up the bottom of the cami, wrap my fingers around the belt loops, and pull as hard as I can. Why are they so hard and tight to get on, but then they feel like they're sliding down? Oh, and I tried going down a size, but that just made the sliding worse.

It has less skin that it goes through now than when I originally pierced it, but its been about 3 months since it was pierced, and my friend told me that the swelling prolly just completly went down so it just looks like there is less skin, and that since there is no redness, pus or soreness or anything, that it isnt rejecting.  But is there not enough skin from what you see in the pic?      Do you think I should take it out and get it repierced so that it goes through more skin?

Since I don't want to use anything on it that might really damage it deep down, I would rather use a straightening iron than a chemical straightener.

20090226220457AAdIDb4	Beauty & Style;Hair	How to get lots of thin blonde foils...?	I've been getting blonde foils for years and I used to get just a few and the amount of blondness has increased over the years. Thing is I don't like the stripy look or when you have a thickish piece of my natural colour coming though (I'm a red head).       I also don't like the look of being blonde all over the top, doesn't suit me and regrowth, urghh.       My hair dresser used to slice it but I still got the odd thick piece which I don't like. She then weaved it and I don't remember the outcome, but not as blonde as I liked. So I got her to weave one, slice one, weave one, slice one. I.e. the bit she left out of the slice she weaved. Which looked great the first time, but alas regrowth was quite obvious, not such a big deal until the next time she did the same but left it on too long and I was white. She put a toner over it to put some colour back but it was still too white and there was none of my natural showing at all. She never overlaps the colour, so my hair doesn't split, but it just was too much.       Last time she went back to slicing it and you can hardly even tell I had it done.       I have really thick hair, so streaks are a no no. Any suggestions for getting lots and lots of thin blonde foils but also having only thin strips of my natural showing at the same time.       Thanks in advance.

Yesterday as I was shopping round a man got in my way and asked if I wanted a free makeup trial I hesitated but said I was in a rush.He said it would be quick so I sat down.      He did my makeup for me and after wards persuaded me that I looked great and needed the product for my skin.   I felt so under pressure and unsure of what to do I agreed to the foundation he then persuaded me to buy the blush as well.   (He knew I was 15 because he asked)      He quickly got me into small talk while he printed off receipts etc.I had not known what I was paying till I looked in the bag walking off.      I ended up paying $150 for a 1 and a half inch container of blush and foundation I clearly could not afford.      I went back with my Mum to complain and receive a refund and they told me I need a doctors say for a refund or to talk to the manager.      What rights do I have?

20090226201101AAqzfNk	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Bikini Line Blues.  I need suggestions!?	Okay, I've tried shaving - using plenty of lotion, shaving in all directions, trying to shave gently, not going over the same spot twice, etc, and I still get little red bumps everywhere, and it's terribly itchy.        I've tried hair remover creme - it leaves stubble, it leaves my skin red, and I still get a crap load of bumps.      I've tried the cold wax strips - the pain wasn't bad at all, but it still left some stubble, and I bled a little bit in certain spots.      I don't know what else to do!  Laser hair removal is not an option, as I can't afford it.  Getting it professionally waxed is somewhat an option, but I'd really prefer finding an at-home method.  I have super sensitive skin, obviously.  If it matters, I'm just looking to trim things up, I'm not into the "bare style".  So is there any solution?  Does anyone have any tips?  Like what brands are better than others?      I'd really appreciate any input on it.  I'm completely frustrated with it.

20090226212348AAZksL2	Beauty & Style;Hair	Why did my hair stop growing (and how can I get it to start again)?	I've been growing out my hair since I was five, but it slowed down and stopped growing when I was about 13.  Ten years later it is still 3 feet long.     Since I was five I've always wanted hair that was down to the back of my knees or even longer, like I've seen a bunch of other women have.  I think it looks great!     I take pretty good care of it--I use cheap shampoo but then a leave-in conditioner, and the only thing I ever do with it is put it in a ponytail for work.  I've never even colored it!  I had the ends trimmed a few times when I first noticed its growth had slowed, but then it just stayed the new length (I know because the measurement of the longest part is now exactly 36 inches).   Why did it stop growing so long ago?  Is there anything I can do to start it up again?   Thanks!

20090226184758AA9nTvr	Beauty & Style;Hair	My hair just feels so lifeless and flat...i don't know what to do with it!?	Its thin and blonde, and about 2 years ago i dyed it blonder (its getting darker as i get older, im 22 now).  The dye added some life, but then after a year, my hair was friend, and I decided no more dying.  My once long and beautiful hair hasnt been the same since I dyed it and chopped it all off.  I have, over the past 8 or 9 months been growing out the dyed portions and getting regular trims to get rid of the dyed portions.        My boss, a hairstylist, was going to put in a few highlights, but since I have a swimming class this semester, I wanted to wait till after, because teh chlorine can really ruin any dye job.        I just feel that there is no life or spring in my hair.  If i use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner its too heavy, and if i use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner its too frizzy and dried out.        I have tried using a moisturizing shampoo and a volumizing conditioner so its not as heavy...but even that jus tmakes my hair feel coarse.      I am not sure what i used to do to make it so soft and fluffy...and i am just looking for pointers to make it all better...      i hate using product liek mousse and stuff becuase my hair gets greasier faster and feels hard.  I liek to be able to run my fingers through my hair, and when i put product in it...it feel hard and clumpy.  So please dont suggest root stuff.      p.s. i dont blow dry it as often anymore because it feels so dry, so i let it air dry a lot...since then it seems harder to blow dry and doesnt do anyhting i want it to do!      i also comb conditioner through my hair in the shower and use a wide toothed comb when really wet...which has made it feel stronger and less fo my hair falls out when i was it every day...but past that no real changes have been made.      also...ive tried all types of cheap to expensive shampoos...nothign works quite right anymore...im really fed up.      thanks for reading i know its long

20090226215855AA9DybN	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Do tattoo artists seem like they prefer a nice canvas?	I'm afraid my tattoo artist has been selling me short on quality work just because I'm a big girl.  I've seen his other work, and in comparison, my tats look like they were done when he was drunk.  One of my tats was even chosen from a similar piece from his portfolio, and it turned out completely different.  He doesn't have any large clients in any of his portfolios, and he'll even include face shots when the girls are pretty, even if the tattoo is on a completely irrelevant spot like the lower back.  I've only gotten two pieces from him. If I'm being too sensitive, I'll just have a talk with him.  If my problem seems legit, I have no problems looking elsewhere.

I'm naturally golden blonde, and just about 3 months of root bleached at the salon, but it came out too orange/yellow and brassy! I've toned it, which didn't help much, and use purple shampoo and conditioner.   I bought the L'oreal Dream Blonde ultra lightening kit in "Baby's Breath Blonde," but I'm too scared to try it!    If I use it on my roots for 15-20 minutes, will it lighten them to platinum? Or will they still be brassy, and get even worse?   I heard if you use the dyes on pre-dyed hair, they turn brassy...Does pre-bleached hair count, too?   Oh and, do you have to use a toner after this kit, or is it a stand-alone kind of thing?

I don't think she feels the same for me, even though she flirts with me every now and then. I was having a conversation with her that eventually led to me asking her whether or not she thought I was "cute." I used the word "cute." She replied: "yes, I think you're good looking, and you have a great smile."       To me, good looking seems like a non-answer, something you say when someone is not attractive, but not a dog either...know what I mean?      Thanks,      LM

20090226172553AAzHusJ	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Hairstyle reflective of personality and style?	I am getting my haircut quite soon; my hair is desperately dry at the ends apparently and I have a few split ends. My hair is somewhat long-- a few inches past my shoulders, and I may have to cut several inches off to get it back into pristine condition. I have a bit of a European vibe (I've been told I look European/ exotic [I scoff at this] and my personal style is Euro-eclectic) and a bit of a laid back, rambunctious (that may sound a bit contradictory) free loving personality(yes, I've a bit of a hippie). I'd like a haircut that reflects that. I, presently, already have a few layers and side bangs, but I don't know where to go from there. My hair is essentially straight, but has a bit of random body to it, and it tends to be somewhat poofy after blow drying (even if I blow dry down the shaft of the hair). Although my hair isn't very thick, it's not thin. Also, I would like my hairstyle to be very low maintenance, but also one that is not too short.      Any suggestions or pictures would be a great help.      Thanks!

20090225124053AAfr2lC	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Porn addict, am i going to heck, how can i stop?	Okay so i'm 15, and for awhile I had been watching porn videos & masturbating almost everyday. I'm not proud of it, or trying to be graphic but I just have an extremly high sex drive, and I would orgasm everytime. But after getting grounded for always fighting with my sister, I didn't have my computer so I didn't watch any porn....&& I was okay with that. I masturbated without it, not as much though. But then something tramatic happened in my life, and I prayed to god that if he helped me through this i'd stop masturbating and watching porn this happened during the month I didn't have my laptop. But then I got my laptop back, and I had done fine for about the first 3 days of having it back...but then I got an extreme urge to look at porn, i resisted it and looked up sex stories & read like 2 got week and rubbed on some stuff NOT TOUCHING myself & orgasmed after I felt really terrible. I honestly fear god and i'm afraid i'm going to he!! now, i really don't want to at all obv. I'm really sorry for what I did. So my questions are since I didn't get naked & touch myself or watch actual porn there wasn't even pictures on the site i read the stories:   1. Am I going to hell?   2. Did I break my promise, or not technically.   3. Do you think I'm addicted to porn.   4. Is it normal to orgasm that much?
