I feel like I’m down in a hole, all alone   down in a hole, losing my soul   I'd like to fly,    but my wings have been so denied      I’m right below the ground   Below your heart   Underneath your feet   Underneath your thoughts      I want to break out and say      If love calls out to you,    would you let it be?   If love grows stronger,    would you set it free?   If love made me yours,    would you choose me?   Would you chase me?   Would you find me?      Every time I try to break free,   Something always holds me back.   Every time I’m about to speak,   Something won’t let me ask.      Every time I think about jumping out,   Spreading my wings and flying away.   I remember your still near me,   And suddenly I want to stay.      But I still want to break out and say      If love calls out to you,    would you let it be?   If love grows stronger,    would you set it free?   If love made me yours,    would you choose me?   Would you chase me?   Would you find me?      If love, if love, if love, if love,   If love, if love, if love, if love,   Yeah   If love calls out to you,    would you let it be?   If love grows stronger,    would you set it free?   If love made me yours,    would you choose me?   Would you chase me?   Would you find me?      If love            It kind of has a tune like 1,000 miles, kind of, not that much though, that's as close as I can think of.

20090128154607AA0O8mo	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Girls!! I need you!! fashion Q for a guy pls!!?	Hey, I'll keep this brief:      Basically I have a wedding function to go to, where there will be lots of girls (including my crush) so I have to dress to impress!      I've got everything except I need a new belt. So to make an impression, I've gone designer (!). Well the reality is, I don't know much about fashion at all, just going with some brand names I've heard of.      Its down to these two belts:   Versace:    http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?...       Gucci:    http://cgi.ebay.com.au/NEW-Amazing-Mens-...       I kind of like the versace one a bit better, but I want to know what you girls think, since you're the type I need to impress! Also I don't want a designer belt that is 'out there' screaming designer because that would make me look like a try-hard. What you girls think?      Another quick question...do you ladies notice a guy's belt or not really? Also, if you did see a guy wearing versace, would you think he was full of himself? because thats the last thing I need!

20090128153742AAoxhAo	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Old dear abby letter. Man in a nursing home...remember?	There was an old dear abby letter, and it was about an old man in a nursing home. The old man had children and every Saturday he would get all dressed up and wait for his children to come and visit him.  He would tell the workers at the home and also visitors for other people living there. Not once did his children walk through the door. As time progressed, and his children never came to visit he never lost hope, but the relatives of other patients would pay more attention to him, because he was all alone. Then one Saturday morning everyone came and met with their relatives that lived in the nursing home, and no one saw this man. As it would turn out he passed away early Saturday morning, all alone, with no one visiting.   Now reading this i cried my eyes out, and writing this question made me tear up again...does anyone have a link to the story or know what  it was called and who wrote it? i would appreciate it so much!

During the funeral, one of the sisters spots a man paying his respects whom she has never seen before. Nonetheless, she instantly falls madly in love with the man. After the funeral, the sisters return home only for the sister who spotted the man to kill her sister. Why?

20090128160342AAC4pQM	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Is this a funny joke?	A blonde wanted to slim down for a party she was going to three months from now. The blonde went on a strict diet and exercised every day. Once a month, the blonde weighed herself. After the first month, the blonde stepped on the scale and said,  "Oh my goodness, I have gained three pounds!" and worked even harder to lose weight.  After the second month, the blonde stepped on the scale again. She looked down and exclaimed,  "Oh, no! I gained two pounds!" Then she worked as hard as she possibly could during the third month.     The day of the party, the blonde had gained eight pounds since she started. She walked up to her friends, a brunette and a red head, and noticed they have lost weight. The blonde was feeling mighty jealous.  "I went on a diet and lost fourteen pounds," said the red head.  "I went on a diet and lost eleven pounds," announced the brunette. Sadly, the blonde responded,  "I went on a diet too, but I gained eight pounds. I don't know why... I exercised every day and ate healthy, but my stomach just gets bigger and bigger every day!"   The red head looked at the blonde strangely and said,  "Of course you gained weight -- you're pregnant! This is your baby shower!"

20090128163337AA85Vjv	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Introducing: Care to rate my local "band of the week" (#1 in a series)  ?	I live in Columbus, Ohio- a city that, despite making great strides in the last couple of decades, is still trying to shake its "cowtown" image. I've decide to do my part by starting a series on Y!A featuring bands or solo artists that are either from- or got their start- in my hometown. I'm going to try and do this once a week on Wednesdays.  Here goes something...       TIMES NEW VIKING is a low-fi indie rock band from Columbus' burgeoning noise scene, combining loud distortion-filled music with catchy melodies and guitar hooks. Last year the band, like Dayton's Guided By Voices before them, made the leap from Siltbreeze Records to the higher profile Matador Records. Their debut on Matador "Rip It Off" reached #17 on the Billborad Heatseekers chart. This is the band's latest single "Call and Response" off of the 7" EP "Stay Awake" released in October. You should have no trouble staying awake...         http://www.imeem.com/pitchforkmedia/musi...       So what do you think?       Got a band from your hometown you'd like to promote?  Post a link.      More info:    http://www.matadorrecords.com/times_new_...

That's his way of dealing with folks, that's how people who consulted him rate him on a professional and personal level.. I like honest, no beat around the bush attitude.. but I read this.. it gives me bad vibes.. I have to go there because my family physician knows I gained weight.. which I drop daily since I stopped Effexor 75.. I am totally off the drug.. but he wants a second opinion.. about me having done the Valerie Bertinelli act.. in revers.. more like Oprah.. fell off the bandwagon from slim to big through Effexor.. since I stopped I already lost 10 lbs.. I only have 20 more to go and the problem is solved.. but I get sent there anyhow ...I never judge people until I met them.. but I feel I am going to make an exception with this guy.. I don't believe I will like him at all.. Sorry.. I am open minded.. but I go there on April 15th.. and I already feel I will think like those who gave him bad ratings.. he sounds like my family physician only 20 times worse still.. I got the meds against my GAD... I have chronic pain.. chest pain.. I don't ever feel anxious.. I get tightness in the chest.. the doctors told me that was all due to GAD.. No I never feel apprehensive.. but now I am starting.. I will be a Jittterbug by April 15...    I made it a policy of mine to not judge a person until I know the person.. but can't seem to help myself. I believe he has preconceived ideas about his patients.. and I feel the same way about him.. I judge him already and never met him.. I get this gut feeling.. I am not a narrow minded person.. I am fair.. I like honest people and not backstabbers but he seems rather weird.. to say the least.. I think he ''takes the cake''

20090128162848AAi9ApF	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	( o _ 0 ) Lara Croft Reboots Without Angelina?  Aw man!  What the?!  Your thoughts ?	Angelina Jolie's loss may just be Megan Fox's gain.      Warner Bros. has confirmed plans to relaunch—and completely overhaul—the hot pants-wearing, artifact-collecting Lara Croft: Tomb Raider franchise, with the first major casualty being Jolie.      According to the Hollywood Reporter, the third film will completely reboot the video game-based character, including changing her origin story (most likely shying away from her English aristocracy roots) and introduce new kinds of missions, love interests and villains.      And, most notably, a new leading lady.      While producers say an actress likely won't be cast until a writer and director have signed on, Fox has emerged as the frontrunner replacement, at least as far as the blogosphere is concerned.      While Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and its inconsistently punctuated sequel Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life were produced by Paramount, the rights to the series have since reverted back to video game purveyor Eidos. In December, Time Warner increased its stake in the multimedia company, ensuring in-house studio Warner Bros. first dibs to what has been a lucrative, abeit critically panned, franchise.      The first installment, released in 2001, grossed $275 million worldwide, while the 2003 sequel earned $157 million. All told, the video game series, which launched in 1996, has accounted for more than $1 billion.      Edit:      Man, I like Jolie.  She's hot!  ( ^ _ ^ )  Megan Fox will probably do ok.  But nobody does Laura Croft like Jolie.

20090128161213AAOAucI	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Do you think Megan Fox is a good replacement for Angelina Jolie in the new Tomb Raider installment?	-?-?-?-    Personally, I find there's no better actress than Angelina Jolie to play the part of Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider series.    But I just read an article from the Y!-homepage saying that Megan Fox is a likely replacement for Angelina Jolie in the next Tomb Raider installment. I think this would be a mistake. I don't think Megan Fox would be able to pull off that role very well, but that's just my humble opinion.    What do you guys think? Megan Fox or someone else (who?) to play Lara Croft?

I mean, I was at laser tag with some friends and we all had tactics planned because we were the first team to go in the room and we immediately started to take positions and establish firing points on the loft and the sides of the room.  My friend (girl) was just following me and she was like "What are you guys doing?"  I said, "We're making a perimeter, it's a good tactic."  Then she said "Tactic?"  I said "yeah it's good to have a strategy."  Then she said "Oh, I thought all we had to do was run around shooting people"      Ok, well yea i guess that's not a bad synopsis of laser tag, but still, are there any girls that are concious to the fact that there are tactics in the military and it's not just a joke where the military goes in guns blazing with no plan?

Maybe in that movie she dances, I don't really know.   So the girl has cancer and in the end of the movie she dies.   I know it's not a walk to remember.   At the end the girl was accepted to a school but she was already dead, she has a boyfriend and I think she also shaved her hair.      I hope I was clear enough and that somebody knows wich movie I mean.

They came around about 1-2 years ago, so they're pretty recent. Here's the link to one of their songs:    "Acido Fincado"  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrGITN_PL...    If the link isn't working, then I apologize. If anything, if it isn't working and you're still interested, then simply look up Os Haxixins on Youtube and you should find some of their videos.      Anyway, if the link is working, what are your thoughts/opinions on them?    Peace!

They believe they are music elitists because they listen to obscure bands that no one really cares about.  And all metal bands sound the same, especially death and black metal.        Why do the "vocalists" like to sing in a tone that is similar to pigs being slaughtered?  How can you enjoy music that you can't even understand?

So, is there a current age limit on Zoo Weekly?

Now there's no doubt that south park is a funny show, but the evolution episode's message was just plain stupid. "Man goes from retard fish to retard dog to kangaroo to monkey to man" or whatever. That makes evolution sound like scientology. It seems like that they got their view of scientology from propaganda.         How about this, creationists, would you like it if i explained the creationism theory as "giant floating man wakes up, gets bored, makes earth, makes man from dust and snot, guy pops out fully grown, rips open ribcage, out comes a a women".

Here's the lyrics:      If you'll be my star, I'll be your sky   You can hide underneath me and come out at night   When I turn jet black and you show off your light   I live to let you shine. I live to let you shine      But you can skyrocket away from me   And never come back if you find another galaxy   Far from here with more room to fly   Just leave me your stardust to remember you by.      If you'll be my boat, I'll be your sea   Depths of pure blue just to probe, curiosity   Ebbing and flowing and pushed by a breeze   I live to make you free. I live to make you free.      But you can set sail the the west if you want to   Past the horizon, till I can't even see you   Far from here, where the beaches are wide   Just leave me your wake to remember you by      If you'll be my star, I'll be your sky   You can hide underneath me and come out at night   When I turn jet black and you show off your light   I live to let you shine.      But you can skyrocket away from me   And never come back if you find another galaxy   Far from here, with more room to fly   Just leave me your stardust to remember you by   Stardust   To remember you by

20090128175740AA42Pvo	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Who said I don't know what a redneck Vasectomy is?	After having 11th child, and Alabama couple decided that was enough(they could not afford a larger double wide)So, the husband went to his doctor(who also treated mules) and told him that he and his wife/cousin didn't want to have any more children. The doctor told him that there was a procedure called a vasctomy that could fix the problem.   The doctor instructed him to go home, get a cherry bomb (fireworks are legal in Alabama), light it, put it in a beer can, then hold the can up to his ear and count to 10. The Alabamian said to the doctor,"I may not be the smartest man, but I don't see how putting a cherry bomb in a beer can next to my ear is going to help me---I don't want to go deaf!"      So, the couple drove to Georgia to get a second opinion. The Georgia physician was just about to tell them about the procedure for a vasectomy when he noticed that they were from Alabama. This doctor instead told the man to go home and get a cherry bomb, light it, placed it in a beer can, hold it to his ear and count to 10.   Figuring that both learned physicians couldn't be wrong, the man went home, lit a cherry bomb and put it in a beer can.   He held the can up to his ear and began to count,"1,2,3,4,5...,"at which point he paused, placed the beer can between his legs and resumed counting on his other hand......

Do you think they should make a rule saying nobody can sign a gospel.      Because it's unfair to others, all you have to do is sing a gospel and you win. I have not seen an atheist judge yet either

I think it would be really cute if I could have pics of the two of them together (like screencaps from the show or something when they have like romantic scenes [or about as romantic as they got on the show, lol]) but pics of them by themselves are great too. Thanks!

20090128173528AAJVhNI	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	In Oz, music is banned from pubs because one person says this is noise pollution. Is this fair?	The well-known and bizarre history is that politicians imposed unreasonable noise levels on music, at the behest of the poker machine industry, which saw dance music as unbeatable opposition. The outcome has been the collapse of live music as it was in the days of ACDC, Men at Work and 10cc, wherein Oz represented almost one third of the global Top Twenty. Do you think noise levels should be decided by the local community, or by politicians and bureaucrats? If you want more details ask on tonyryan43@gmail.com

20090128174600AAJmT83	Entertainment & Music;Movies	AHH help me find these movies!!?	There are these two movies that I saw probably ten years ago that I really want to see again. They are both about children and babies and stuff...read on...      First movie: I think this movie's title has something to do with the word "rain" in it, but I'm not positive. The movie is about some storm or something that makes all women infertile. (NO it's NOT Children of Men, I promise.) The children in school are taught how to have sex and are encouraged to have babies as soon as possible with their classmates. I cannot remember the name or very much about it, because I was like 10 years old or so.      Second movie: This movie was also about some sort of clouds or storm or something that passed over a town that caused everybody to pass out for like and hour or so. I remember that one mad fell onto a grill as it happened and was shown on screen getting burnt to death. The storm passes and everybody (but the crispy guy of course) is ok, but all the women are all of the sudden pregnant. Then, they all give birth on the same day and have children that all have blonde hair, (I think blue eyes) and are mind-readers. They try to kill their parents. I remember one child controlling her mother's mind and making her put her arm in a pot of boiling water. BUT there is one good little boy who isn't evil, and he's like the special one of the bunch.         I really hope somebody can remember what the movies are!!! This bothers me SOOOO much!!!
