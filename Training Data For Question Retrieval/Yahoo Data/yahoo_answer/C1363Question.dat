Since two months i have lost all interest in it and haven't played a single game since, i just didn't want to live this life anymore.      The thing is, i have forgotten how to enjoy life, i have absolutely nothing except my work to keep me busy which i don't really enjoy but don't hate either, i have no hobby's, only a handful of friends, no wife, no nothing.      I do go out now and then, but i get bored so fast, i just wanna leave again.      All i know is that i want a purpose, something i can do that makes me happy. I just don't know where to start,

Hi I am a 33 year-old woman and I have a large collection of swimwear bikinis and swimsuits of various colours styles etc most of which has been bought by my husband for me over the 10 years we have been together. the thing is I don't think that I have the figure to wear these anymore nor do I have the desire to do so.      I have twice tried to throw them out in the dustbin but each time my husband has found and rescued the swimwear.      I have also tried to donate to local charity shops but they won't take them for hygene reasons.      Any ideas on how i can get rid of these bikinis and swimsuits or what can i do to stop husband rescuing them from the dustbin?

It`s not alot of discharge but sometimes it gets very uncomfortable to sit around in because I can feel it sorta dampening my underwear.   I`ve already been to a doctor and I don`t have any infections, and it`s not the weather, and I`m not being sexually aroused by anything. Is it normal for a girl my age to be wearing pads constantly?   I`ve tried the pantyliners but the things are too thin and they turn over too easily and are very uncomfortable when they get dampened so fast.   My younger sister says it`s not normal for my age to wear pads everyday and she makes me feel bad that I use up my family`s money to buy "unnecessary things" like pads which you shouldn`t wear everyday. She thinks it`s just a bad habit I picked up and that I`m lying about the frequent discharge.   Is there any way to lessen the discharge or find some way to use pads "normally"?

Don't get me wrong I'm not crazy, this is just a theory. I'm also a Christian and just because this is my theory I don't denounce the Lord or Revelation, but I don't think Armageddon is Revelation.

20090223002814AA2kd8k	Social Science;Sociology	Intelligence and society?	Look I know this is going to come off as racist which it is but my question is despite the fact that there are countless study's that have found frontal lobe and electrical synaptic differences in the overall speed and processing power of brains based on races or (populations) im not talking bout IQ tests I mean computerized BRAIN scans and the fact that throughout history all major inventions like electricity plumbing climate control automobiles and modern architecture 3 dimensional art have never come from africa and still dont in many parts. That people argue that everyone is the same when the science proves otherwise and is overlooked or ignored by mainstream media who just like to point out how IQ scores dont prove anything which is true but the genetics and neural processing of the brain says very clearly otherwise (guy who mapped human genome Nobel prize winner spoke about this got linched by media). Not everyone is like this there are smart blacks and dumb whites but in general the TREND is that 1/100 black men have the same processing power as asians or whites. Im not racist but not unfounded information not bias just facts and findings. And there is in fact a 6% difference in humans attributed to race TRENDS there is in fact a black white Hispanic gene but it is very complicated and is often mixed and discombobulated with other cells but again the TRENDS have been rather strong in suggesting the correlation or commonness of different races.Ive read bout the multiple intelligence theorie and even the creative parts of the brain are more active in white and asian brains than their african counterparts. Sorry its racist but and it will make people feel bad but society shouldn't just stick its head in the ground like an ostrage and ignore the facts. We should learn to accommodate each other based of real expectations there is a reason that rape murder robbery and drug abuse are the highest in African related individuals throughout the world (not just America). Mainstream scociety needs to grow up and accept things for what they are and help people who need more help rather than promoting gangster rap and that other MTV bullshit.

In my dreams im usually trying to take pictures, of the tornados, or of something that is so AMAZING and beautiful, but I can never get the picture in time, or my camera wont work for some reason.   Im really into photography, so this usually really upsets me when I cant get the pic I want!      WTF do these mean???
20090223022723AAVwM5x	Social Science;Psychology	Why am I always tired?	I know that I don't get enough sleep due to my work schedule but it seems as though I am ALWAYS tired...I work a 10pm-6:30am shift 5 nights a week...I have a 9yr old son who is in school 5 days a week in which I try to sleep while he is at school.  Here is a quick breakdown of my day:      Sat-Wed night work 10pm-6.30am   Mon-Thurs morning get home about 7am; Rest for about 30mins before waking up my son to get him ready for school; 8am he is off to school; 8-10am run errands, clean up, decide what is for dinner; 10am or so I lay down and stare at the TV until my eyes get tired...sleep until about 1pm...now I am up and have NOTHING to do...3:20 here comes my angel of a child from school; time for homework; snack; take him to the park or let him play outside with his friends; 5pm time to make dinner; 6pm he comes in the house and it's time for dinner; 6:30pm I am back laying down staring at the TV or reading a book; 8:45pm time to wake up and get ready for work...      OMG now that I typed that I see that I do have some time to sleep but it's like my brain doesn't shut down long enough...people have suggested going to the doctor to get a sleep aid but I have quite wrapped my head around that...so I guess I have 2 questions:    1. Why am I so tired?    2. What can I do?     I am not looking for medical advice...just some pointers from the online community...      Rude comments will be reported...

20090223032822AAalO9m	Social Science;Psychology	I was molested the first time I Ever touched a man, does this explain who I became ?	I was saving my first kiss for love, silly at the time I know. I got drunk for the first time when I Was fifteen years old at my best friends house. Thinking everything was safe. She left me and her brother showed up, he was younger then me, his friend was with him, I had never even held hands with a boy before. They both did things to my vagina, as they forced me to suck there ***** and told me I was never going back unless I Did these acts. I Was crying and saying help. A week later I lost my virginity. I slept around, but got a serious boyfriend of two years. I dropped out of highschool within the year that happened. Once the boyfriend left, I slept around as much as possible and I never felt shame but as if I deserved it all. I am twenty now, IT has been five years. I still have these personality traits, does going through somehting like this change you to this extent without help? I was never that girl, but now I can honestly say looking back, the moment the right of everything I had stood proud against was taken I lost my will to say no and my right to do right. Where do I go now ?

Among the many topics of interest to non-Muslims, the status of Muslim women and the theme of their rights -- or rather, the perceived lack of them – seems to be foremost.  The media’s portrayal of Muslim women,   usually outlining their “oppression and mystery” seems to contribute to this negative perception.

At the trial of Valerie Solanus after being charged with shooting Andy Warhol.      "On June 13, 1968 Valerie Solanas appeared in front of State Surpreme Court Justice Thomas Dickens; she was then represented by radical feminist lawyer Florynce Kennedy who called Solanas "one of the most important spokeswomen of the feminist movement." Kennedy asked for a writ of habeas corpus because Solanas was inapproriately held in a psychiatric ward, but the judge denied the motion and sent Solanas back to Bellevue. Ti-Grace Atkinson, the New York chapter president of NOW, attended Solanas' court appearance and said she was "the first outstanding champion of women's rights."       http://www.womynkind.org/valbio.htm

When I fell back to sleep I had a bunch of nightmares, each which woke me up, and every time I fell back to sleep they continued. All the nightmares took place in my bed, and involved voices, noises, being poked and pulled and pushed in my bed, and everytime I tried to scream, nothing would come out. I was so terrified to fall back to sleep after a few of these dreams that I got up at 6.30.   I'm so tired and can't understand what happened! I have a sore throat and maybe a slight temperature, could this have been linked? Was it because I was in a light sleep?   Thanks

20090223061201AAckkwR	Social Science;Psychology	Still worried a year later and effecting my daily life.?	hey everyone i suffer from OCD/anxiety and i have been worried sick for the past 11 months because while moving i threw out my old 40gb laptop hard drive without thinking..and have read alot about idenity theft and it just scared me sending me into a complete obsession over my personal information being found and someone finding out everything about me, even though eveything was deleted from the drive, i know things can still be recovered ..after 11 months odds are it has been destroyed right? i would have known by now if anyone had found it. Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.      Should i seek therapy? I have already checked my credit report and what not, but i always seem to just tell myself it just hasnt happened YET

20090223072649AAII9pF	Social Science;Psychology	Is music a bad influence? (in Religious & Psychology views)?	Before you make any conclusion. Please read everything I wrote below:-         I'm a Muslim who wants to hear other opinions and experience based on this question. Some Imams said that music is forbidden. It is not because of music itself (as individual) the dangers are the effects or influence when we hear music for example: drugs, sex, bad influence (e.g.: clothes, lifestyle etc.) and another fact that music effects a persons emotion.         Personally, I wasn't sure about it myself. Then I did experiments which are:-            Listen to music frequently for a week      results: Sometimes unable to control my emotions, desires and hard to concentrate in certain things.            Limit myself listening to music for a week.      result: Able to control my desires, emotions and able to concentrate more and often read or do something much more useful rather than listening to music or etc.             From my point of view. Music does have effects which are emotionally and mentally.       So I choose to avoid listening to music too much and concentrate in other things.

20090223063725AAj840S	Social Science;Psychology	Is it normal to have reoccurring thoughts of violence?	Okay this has been bothering me for years: I get these random thoughts of harming people I'm around, not people I don't like (that wouldn't bother me) but people I like or even care about, it disturbs me very badly.. here's an example: I'll be around somebody (like a co-worker or a family member) and a thought about how easy it would be to kill them (and I can see this in vivid detail) will jump into my head and I'll feel sick and repulsed by it -it's kinda scary, because it makes me feel afraid of myself, but does the fact that I'm afraid of it mean I'd never do it?? I think it does, I think these just might be obsessive thoughts that I think about for the sole purpose of upsetting mysel.. for instance if these thoughts didn't bother me I wouldn't think about them... it's like someone who has an irrational fear of death and is obsessed with their own future death but for me I'm always worried that my mom, or family members are going to die or somehow I'm going to kill them -but I don't want to so why would I?      I need to figure out how to get rid of these thoughts.. they are very scary and make me feel crazy, does it sounds like I'm going crazy?? I think if I were it would have already happened years ago..      btw it feel allot better just asking this question because I've never told anyone this.. maybe part of the solution would be to talk about it to a doctor, but I don't want to be locked up... any advice is appreciated.

20090223063647AAWTPrH	Social Science;Psychology	What questions would you ask yourself in an ethical situation?	If you had to make a decision on an ethical situation, what type of questions would you ask yourself to make the right decision?       There's the story of the man that had a dying wife and their health insurance wouldn't pay for her expensive medication. Not wanting to see his wife die, the man broke into a pharmacy in the middle of the night and stole the medication that she needed. Should charges be pressed towards him for breaking, entering, and stealing? Or should he be waived because he was trying to save his wife's life?       Or what if you found out that your best friend's boyfriend was cheating on her? You know that she has the utmost confidence in him and if you ever said something bad about him she would never be your friend again. Would you tell her and make her upset and risk your friendship? Or would you just pretend you didn't know?      What type of questions would you ask yourself in making similar decisions, and why? For example, you can just ask yourself, "what are the facts?" or "what are the consequences?"

To eat or not to eat      Pre-experiment Question: How will eating breakfast in the morning affect a person throughout the day?      Hypothesis: People who eat breakfast in the morning will have more energy and be more attentive than people who don’t eat breakfast.      Subjects: 15 healthy males ranging from 18-35, 15 healthy females ranging 18-33      Independent Variables:  Type of food that was eaten, amount that was eaten, and time breakfast was eaten.      Dependent Variables: The results throughout the day.      Control Group: 6 people ( 3 male, 3 female) who get an extra 30 minutes of sleep and skip breakfast.      Experiment Overview:  24 participants will eat breakfast before leaving for his/her occupation.        The participants who ate breakfast will be compared between themselves and the control group.      Potential problems with this experiment:   1. The experiment doesn’t take into account the amount of food the people ate.   2. Some occupations may be more demanding than others.

An academic psychologist wanted to investigate the effects of three days of sleep deprivation on fine motor tasks (fine motor tasks are actions that use the small movements created by the small muscles in the fingers)      the psychologist proposed to test this by using a computer game where the participants of both the control group (who slept as normal) and the experimental group (who stayed awake) played the game every three hours.      the psychologist asked for volunteers, but when there were none, he resorted to coercing his 3rd year uni students, saying that if they did not participate, they would fail. of the 30 students in the class, 25 then said they would participate.      the psychologist told them that once the experiment started the students would have to stay until the end and complete it. after which, they would be permitted to drive home.      At the conclusion of the experiment, the psychologist did not share the findings with the students and some students displayed negative symptoms such as anxiety, headaches and excessive crying for two weeks.      The psychologist also told the participants that the results were to be published with their names in the next months psychology lecturers bulletin and when one person objected he said "Too bad!"

Not that I want to instigate a heated argument or be another "I don't understand feminism" spokesman. I just need some second opinions before considering myself one.      I live in a society where I get sick and tired of machoism and see women abused on the news headline everyday. Enough rambling, I want to know the core beliefs and elements of feminism and maybe a little evaluation on my ideas.      - I believe I'm liberal, having some negative sentiments towards my country's current government and capitalism in general.      - I'm pro-choice and I support minority rights, LGBT rights and affirmative action policies      - In my relationships with friends who are girls, I might not be the life and soul of the party but I treat them with respect and avoid sexist joke/slang as much as possible.      - Like many other guys, I DO watch porn, but I honestly disgust men mistreating women in such materials so I avoid anything too brash or hardcore. I can dissociate this and real life in social situations.      - As sexually open as I can be, I reject promiscuity and polygamy.      - I personally believe there's a masculine and feminine side in every one of us, therefore gender roles are nothing but false threshold trying to separate one whole, blurred picture.      Am I sorta qualified?

But last night I had a dream that I was in my basement with my friends cousin [I dont even talk to him, I seen him twice] and a whole bunch of other people. There was this girl there with blond hair, and I started talking to her. We were talking and I started to like her and there was an attraction. She brought me in the bathroom and she laid up against the wall with her arms crossed smiling, and I went to go kiss her but she pushed me away and I felt horrible, since I have a girlfriend already. She gave me her number and somehow my mom was calling me from upstairs, I told everyone to be quiet since I was supposed to be in school. When I went outside it was summer, and my mom told me to clean some clothes. When I was going to go back downstairs my best friends aunt was talking to me, and I dislike her very much. I felt uncomfortable talking to her so I went back downstairs doing the clothes, and I heard people leaving. I yelled something like "You guys dont even say goodbye, what the hell is your problem leaving like that?!"       The girl stayed though and we talked, thats all I remember.         Whats going on? Ive been having some weird dreams lately.

I've tried various Google searches but cannot find any academic sources or web pages reporting on this research. Can somebody please suggest one?
