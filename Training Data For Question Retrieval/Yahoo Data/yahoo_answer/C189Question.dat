20090306141633AAbrkxd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How much walking did you do to help dilate?	I'll be 38 weeks tomorrow and the past two weeks I have tried to go walking at least 2-3 times a week, just so after I have the baby I'm used to walking and I also heard it can help you dilate. At 34 weeks I was 1+3/4 cm dilated and 80% effaced but I have not been checked recently (my next appointment is on Tuesday the 10th, which is 11 days before my due date). Normally I try to walk about a mile, sometimes a little less depending on how tired I get. The past few days I've been pretty tired and haven't walked but I had some extra energy today and went for a walk with my dog for about 10 minutes came home, checked my email and then went back out for an additional 20 minutes.      For those of you who walked to help dilate how long did you walk for?

I ordered a smash cake, but I am 99% sure he'll poke at it with disgust. He does have tactile sensitivities though..  we've been doing cake or a cupcake per day, as practice. Sort of going about it casually, bc it's SUCH a control issue. When he knows we want him to eat it, he absolutely WILL NOT. If we walk away and pretend to be busy, he will at least try it.   ANYways, anyone else have a 1 yr old without the classic smashed cake on the face pic?

20090306170336AAVlDtZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	I am almost 5 months pregnant and left my boyfriend- sometimes I feel that I overreacted?	I am almost 27, and sober. I met my boyfriend in August however; we did not start dating until Nov. When I met him, he had just come back from a relapse and I was not working a strong program. We became pregnant the first time we had sex and decided to stay together, and have a baby. (I was shocked at both responses but grateful to have someone that was so willing to grow with) At about 2 months my hormones went crazy, and so did I for that matter. We lost communication and I began to not trust him. We stopped being intimate, and our fights got worse. I am the financially stable one with career and no-debt, I can be rigid with values, and am also a lover when not pregnant. We have tried to work things out, but last week he definitely slapped my morals and compromised my belief system. After saying that I could trust, "if it ever happens again, then you can leave me" he did it again. When I called him out on it I was pissed, I packed his things and kicked him out. I have decided to be as copacetic as possible with him, as we had no foundation really to begin with and maybe now we can format something to raise this baby with. However now, I am worried that I will fall for him, or vice versa, or that I will lead with chin or follow with my heart. I know TODAY that I am unwilling to compromise my values for anyone, regardless of OUR child, but at the same time I wished that he could have shown up this negotiable while we were together. He know says that he will reaarange his work to fit my schedule so I won;t worry about the finance of child care. It feels like he wants the child and not me, adn it hurts that he couldn't just say that in the beginning. We had many talks about this, and he said that he can;t live with me throwing him out If he makes a mistake, and I said I can't live with him telling me to trust him unless of.... and then doing the unless, with no consequence. Any advice?

I'm so sick of buying a million outfits that all look the same.  I have also been looking for bedding and realized that there is such a variety for a baby girl and like 3 things for a boy.  Again at buy buy baby they had walls and walls of girl comforters and about 3 things that would suit a boy, jungle theme, elephant theme and some blue and brown theme.

I am having a issue bc My son isn't sitting up well enough to use adult bath tub w/o slipping and sliding all over the place. He could get hurt.   here is what we had before: Sorry this is long!!       1. http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41...       this tub has worked great up until now. The pump doesn't pump water anymore even after through cleaning. The padding over the tank is just like cloth and doesn't pad his back and butt enough. Hes getting to big      2. http://www.safety1st.com/uploads/product...       We had this cradle bathing thing which I liked until at the bottom( that goes into the water) foam padding is always coming loose. The metal frame in there was getting rusty( way too rusty to use now). My son is so long that he stretched the length of the whole thing. The stuff this is made out of was starting to un rival so it had holes in it.       3. http://www.safety1st.com/uploads/product...    We just bought this tonight thinking ok yeah this will work. Well he pushes his legs on the lower end and his head goes over the edge. Its not slip resistant. Doesn't keep baby from sliding. I hate it and we are taking it back.        http://www.safety1st.com/uploads/product...       I found this on the safety 1st site and what are your Mommies opinions of it and Do any of you whom has used it have any pro / or cons about this tub side bath seat. .
20090306185511AAXzuLo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Do you think this is good discipline even though it is awkward?	I was taking a test at a public library today, and after I was done taking the test, and as I was leaving the library, standing by the elevator to get to the ground floor, there were two kids, about between ages 4-5,(one was a boy and the other was a girl) standing in the corner in the small foyer by the elevator, and the boy was by the button where you call the elevator, which was already pushed, and his sister was on the other side, and I could hear the mother saying ot the kids to keep still and don't move.   I know it is very good discipline, and also works really well. However, is still good discipline to use in public, even though it may sound awkward? The reason why I am asking this is because if I ever have children, I want to feel comfortable making my kids stand in the corner without having strange looks from other people. I would like to give time-outs to my children without embarrassment. Is it still good discipline?

I know I'm not that far along, but I am a CNA, and I am already starting to see the hard part of this job while being pregnant.      I had a miscarriage last time at 8-9 weeks pregnant, and so this work kind of scares me since we have to lift people everyday!! People at work know I'mn pregnant, and help me out, but we're always soo short staffed that I have to lift people, and so today my tailbone is hurting so bad I could cry, and my legs are hurting sooo bad!!      I need a job right now, but this work is going to kill me while I'm pregnant. I don't know what to do. I cant find another job that is easier for me because who wants to hire a pregnant woman who will need time off in not to many months anyways.       Does anyone have any advice to help me out. I am desperate for advice, and do not want to risk this pregnancy just for work.

20090306213855AAMlTeA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I have a "weird" reputation, && I'm scared it will be like this all through high school :/?	I'm 14 years old and in 8th grade. Ever since I moved to this stupid place where the teens think they're some sort of celebrities on 90210 I guess I've been 'weird'. I'm not weird they're just too serious, or i don't know the word. SNOBY! Any way, I guess I'm weird. and I'm scared that because of what people have thought of me from the 4th grade to now, no boys will like me.       Today I had to go to a 7th grade teachers room to ask her a question and whenever I walked in immediately someone said "ewww". I could feel my face turn red. But what hurt me more, was that it was a 7th grader! That knew me! I just hate people thinking of me as the weird girl. I'm not weird!! I was like in the 4,5,&6 grade but come on, I had just moved and I was growing boobs and crap like that! What should I do? I don't want to go to high school & people (especially boys) think I'm still weird.   Grrrrr. >:l

Today I felt wet and went "oh great, it's back AGAIN!" but, it was just regular discharge. Is it over? Also, does this mean I am ovulating already? Is that possible? I'm also breastfeeding. Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
20090306212254AAe1zta	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	A question for pro life women :) not mean I promise!?	I have heard that most pro lifers believe that life begins with sperm meets the egg.  So obviously I understand your thoughts on abortion but what about the Plan B pill?  I am pro choice but it seems like Plan B is giving people a free pass to have unprotected sex.  It seemed like a few years ago if you did not have a condom you did not have sex.  Now its if you don't have a condom you get plan b.  To me it seems like there is going to be a wild outbreak of STD's from it.  So my question is:   Do you consider Plan B in the same way you see abortion?      p.s.  I am not trying to get any ones feathers ruffled I am just really curious to see what the other side sees   Thank you

I own my own place and my twin sister who I'm close to lives with me. I live in New York. Will it be difficult for me to adopt a baby?

But I would like to give a baby that is already alive and unwanted a good home if I can. How hard would this be to do and would it be easier adopting from a country other than the U.S.?

Recently, a group of our closest friends confronted me (not us) saying that I go out too much for how young my kid is, non of which are parents themselves.

OK, sorry the last post i did was too long i guess, here's the short version. Im studying abroad, my girlfriend missed her period by almost two weeks, first two pregnancy tests were negative.  She then told me 4 days ago when i called that she had taken test again and it was positive.       We had already decided along time ago that if there was ever an unplanned pregnancy that we would get married (working towards it soon anyways)  Even though we had talked about it, still very emotional but i know i can make adjustments and still be ok, still get through school and get where i need to in life.      After 4 days when we finally can sit down and have a long conversation she tells me that she was just joking and is not really pregnant!! WTF!?        WHy would she do it?! Should I dump her ***?  (she said that the day she told me she was pregnant was the day she really had her period)       I hung up on her, wont call or take calls from her till i figure this out, I dont know what to believe at this point or why she would lie to me.  If she told me she was pregnant again and not serious this time... well... i dont know what to believe..      (she said the first time on the phone she wanted an abortion, led me on for 3-4 days for hours at a time about being pregnant... said i had to marry her even if she gets abortion b/c i got her pregnant and she had to get an abortion... WTF)      SHE KNEW I LOVED HER< THAT I WANTED TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH HER< WHY WOULD SHE DO THIS@?? IM FREAKED OUT AND WANT OUT, AM I JUSTIFIED FOR DUMPING HER?      (IS SHE CHEATING ON ME? oR doing this so i dump her?)  I dont know if i can trust her again, esp after something like this.      THanks

I will be returning to work in a couple of weeks and all everyone keeps telling me is, I have got to put her on a schedule so she sleeps through the night.  How?  Is it realistic to believe that she can be put on one so young?  If anyone has done it, what tips can you give me?  Also, they say you can't spoil a newborn but when should you stop rocking them to sleep (so they won't need you to fall asleep all the time)?  My baby will fall asleep in my arms and as soon as I put her down she is awake and crying.

20090227063900AAxOBoV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is there another way to get my baby to burp better?	My son is a littler over 2 weeks old and is breastfed.  I have the hardest time getting him to burp when he is done eating and if I don't get him to burp, most of the time he'll spit up when I lay him down.  About 95% of the time he is sleeping when I burp him, but I don't think that has anything to do with it because the few times he is awake it is just as hard to get him to burp.  What I do it pat him on the back and I usually try different speeds lol and sometimes when I pat him fast he'll burp right away and other times he doesn't.  I do it on his belly sometimes and will pat or rub with the same results.  So is there any other ways I can get him to burp better?
20090306232427AAlDJIF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Pelvic/Uterus Pain continuing MONTHS after childbirth -- This isn't normal, is it?	My son is almost 9 months old and ever since I have given birth, I continue to feel this nagging discomfort and sometimes extreme pain in my pelvic/female organ area.       I breastfeed, so I know that its normal to feel some sort of pressure while feeding and shortly after we've finished -- but this feeling doesn't ever really go away. Its a constant (mostly dull) feeling..      I find its also even worse after I pick my son up for an extended amount of time or if I pick something else up over 15 lbs or so.      Is this pressure still normal.. even 9 months after I gave birth??      Has anyone experienced this?
20090306225047AA7KG2O	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Are these normal aches and pains of pregnancy?	Well, I've had some pressure down low for the last few days, and I've noticed that my baby bump has that downward slope, so I figured my baby girl was dropping a little. Today, though she seemed to be back up high. I've had menstrual-like cramping low in my abdomen (not extremely painful, but achy and uncomfortable). Tonight I had sharp pains going across my abdomen about the level of my belly button.      My uterus feel tight and high, not just stretched out, but tight (like after having an orgasm, except I haven't had one of those in a while). I don't think it's preterm labor or anything like that, but I was just wondering if this is pretty normal for 33 weeks pregnant?

20090307002114AArwaXl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Do some parents take "anti-spank" way too far?	i understand all parents have different ways that they discipline in their homes. to each their own, but when anti-spank mommies come on here and call moms that do spank "bad moms" "lazy parents", its really not fair. the spanking mommies could turn around and call the anti-spanks lazy and bad for not spanking, its a two way street.      it is not child abuse to swat your child on the butt (age appropriate) once they know right from wrong. sometimes "talking" to your child is not effective. just like adults are visual learners, hands on learners, etc, kids are the same way. sometimes they need to see the punishment instead of it just being talked about.      i do agree that some parents dont know where to draw the line between spanking and beating, but if we beat our children i doubt we'd be participating in a parenting forum, right?

She brings up her burps fine but she still gets wind go down & she pops of alot & is in pain. No matter how much i wind her it don't stop the air going down. Eventually she will go for a big poop ( sorry : / ) 7 it goes. I give her infacol which is a colic relief & it helps alot! It knocks the bubbles out of her system but she still can't shift it all & drawers her knees & can tell she has tummy cramps. The thing is she don't scream or really cry with it, she whimpers but seems to just get on with it. She's not that much of a crier though so i didn't know if it's colic & she just gets on with it or its not enough to bother her that much. If we run out of infacol we will be up for about 5 hours because she settle but she is not going into 1.  What do you think?

I've been taking care of my friend's teen for about a week now, his mother is very ill and has cancer, recently she was given a healing prayer and it worked better then anyone expected, in fact she will be starting treaments that she never would have been taking before. I love my friend and I love her son, but there is a big problem, last night there was a pot luck at my church, I took my friend's son, let's call him Sammy, with me because I just don't feel comfortable leaving a 14 year old alone. He made a big stink because I was making him go to church, and he is an "Atheist" well after we got to the pot luck the pastor took Sammy aside and they talked for about 20 mins I don't know what they were talking about but Sammy left with a big smile on his face, when we got him all he said to me was, " the only one of you sheeple that makes any sense is Pastor Gerry" then he locked himself in his room, about 2 hours later I was heading to bed and I heard crying coming from his bedroom and he was talking to him self saying "I hate you god I hate you, why did you take my mom away and make her sick..." he went on.    I'm so confused! He says he is an atheist, but he talks to god? he hates Christians but the pastor understands him? is his a teenage thing? what's the deal? even more important how can I help this kid? please I need answers

Right now I'm 16years old and 14 weeks pregnant. Idk if you think it's right or wrong because I am and there's nothing I can do now.       Anyways right now I am laying in a hospital bed because I have mono and a horrible kidney infection which is causing my kidneys to shut down. I live with my sister and her family and the rest of my family basically htes me and won't talk to me. My mom has cancer and is dying so she's not there to answer questions.        I go to school full time(I'm a junior) but I only have 4 credits left    after this year so I'm almost done. I hve good grades and a 3.8 average GPA      Right now I'm working 2 full time jobs and going to school. With me being in the hospital I'm going to miss a lot of school an work.       I'm just confused at how other moms handle all of it. Do you guys still go to school and work and be a mom? Whatshould I do?       Ps the father (my bf) is graduated and works and is supportive. But once I have this baby my sister wants me to move out and my bf has to move out then too so were going I have to pay for food rent baby stuff and everything!      Anyone else in this boat?

20090227050002AACzsaG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	How long does sperm live?	Have read lots of different things, most say it can live up to 5 days but typically only lasts 2-3 days. Is that correct? I was just wondering as had intercourse 3-4 days before ovulation and was wondering how likely it is that that would end in a pregnancy? I know its much better to have intercourse as close to ovulation as possible. If what most of the websites say is true the sperm from intercourse 3 or 4 days before ovulation will most likely be dead by the time i ovulated.

20090227004800AAJjOLm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Feeding advise needed...?	My daughter is now nearly one and she as a healthy appetite.  She still has some formula each day and she has three proper meals a day with either some fruit, rice cakes or rusk maybe a ocouple of times a day with some baby juice.  She will eat finger foods (proper solids) like toast or fruit for example but when it comes to meal times she will not eat anything lumpy.  I have been trying for quite a while now to move her from completely pureed foods to more lumpy foods and she will not eat it.  If I give her anything at all ,lumpy she spits it straight back at me.  She has pureed veg/chicken/fish etc for her meals and fruit/yoghurt/sugar free jelly for pudding but just WILL NOT eat her dinner if it's not completely pureed.  The jars of baby food that you can get are completely pureed for 4-6 month olds but the 7-9 month jars are lumpier and she wont eat them.  Does anybody have any advice???  Is it a case of trial and error, just keep trying?  Or is there something  should be doing?

My 5 month old baby has just started getting over a head cold and conjunctivitis, she had a temperature for a about two days but that was a few days ago now, her temp was fine yesterday and seems fine this morning. However she has a red/pink rash and her body. It was worse on her back and stomach last night but I wasn't too alarmed as she was fine within herself and is feeding as normal.    Last night though she moaned quite a lot in her sleep and I had to move her around a lot to settle her as though she couldn't get in a comfortable position, something was bothering her. This morning her face has this rash on it mainly on her for head, chin and behind her ears. The rest of her body isn't as bad as it was before. Oh and her head feels warm where as the rest of her body is normal.    I am going to take her to the doctor now in a short while but wondered if anyone had experienced this with their children and what was it?

Do something to get in trouble... Then she will go "AHHHH!" like shes hungry so she can get up and wonder off. )      Potty training is impossible because she drinks from her bottle (her sippy cup) all day.

When I went to the Dr. last Wed. I weighed 173 and now I went back today and I weighed 170. I can't really eat, I try then immediately feel nauseous. I was sick one day and threw up 20 times, the reason I went to the Dr. last Wed, and couldn't keep any fluid or anything down. A couple weeks ago I was losing thick yellow, sticky, gel-like mucus. It happened over the course of a couple days and I showed my Dr. the picture I took of it and she dismissed it without looking at the picture. Does that sound like a mucus plug? I'm also having terrible cramps and back pain and losing my breath. I have another appointment with a different Dr. Monday the 16th and I hope she can tell me something.  In the meantime, anyone have any ideas or similar stories to share?

20090227063902AA1UErc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is it possible to get a 4 week old on a schedule?	I plan to go back to work in 2-3 weeks and I really want her to be on somewhat of a schedule (that will work w/ my work schedule).  Right now she likes to stay up until midnight.  She sleeps until 4-4:30, then goes back to sleep until about 7:30.  She takes a morning nap around 9:00 for about 1-2 hours.  After that she usually takes a nap in the early afternoon (like 2:00pm) for 1 hour, then stays up until midnight.  She is breastfeed and seems to cluster feed in the evening and is fussy. How can I get her to go to sleep earlier?  I really don't feel like she is oversleeping during the day, so what do I do?

20090307133328AAv3o0g	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What do you mommies think of the Baby Einstein Videos?	My 5 month old, loves watching TV.  I usually always keep it on in the background, because I'm home alone all day, and like the noise.  She loves to watch it.  There are times I'm playing with her, and she's looking by me to try and see the TV.  She some times even responds to the people, by squealing, smiling or laughing.  I'm not one of those moms that thinks kids shouldn't watch TV, especially at 5 months old.     So I picked up one of those Baby Einstein Movies.  It was Baby Mozart actually.  I don't think I got the point of it.  It almost seemed kinda dumb.  Especially when they had the hands playing with the toys on the screen.  I'm the mom, aren't I supposed to do that.  I mean maybe I'm missing something, but I don't think it was any different then her watching some random commercial.  I'm thinking it was a waste of money.      So what do you guys think?  Do think it's any better then regular TV?  Or what about kids shows on TV?
20090307115154AAjCK5H	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	AP's and adoptees...child in need of special care?	Hi,   My sister is asking for some information about resources for foreign adoptees in need of special therapy/treatment.      My sister's student is 8 years old, and is the oldest of three siblings adopted from Russia. She was adopted after the younger two, once the AP's realized that the younger two had an older sister. According to the AP's, the child was left in isolation for much of her infant and toddler years, and was adopted at around 5-6 years old. She is in the right grade level, but has no interest in school or much of anything. The school has done testing on her, and say she has a low IQ. They have said that there is nothing the AP can do to help her daughter. The child talks and reads on grade level, but is behind all of the other children in social skills, in comprehension of things she learns. She is extremely close to her Adoptive mother, but is very wary of strangers and new situations.    I honestly don't know much more than what I have given you, but the AP's are concerned because they don't know what to do to help her. I questioned why they are just now seeking help, but they said that there weren't many warning signs prior to the 2nd grade.    My question is, do any of you know websites, facilities, etc. to help IA children with treatment, support, etc.? I'm not looking for an online forum, but an actual program or service. Apparently, these people are not hurting for money, and are willing to do anything it takes to help this child....but I just don't know much about IA and the transition issues, developmental issues, etc. Thanks for any help you could provide!
20090307123048AApCtsZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	PREGNANT WITH NUMBER FIVE!?	I know this isn't a question, but I'm letting everyone who has been following my semi-struggle getting pregnant, that I am pregnant with baby number five without any help from doctors!!! I went to the doctor after three positive pregnancy tests and a missed period and it's a yes! I'm being very careful since I haven't had the best luck with pregnancies in the past, but for now we are just counting our blessings and thanking God! We told the girls the day after I went to the doctor, but have asked them to refrain from telling friends until I'm further along.      QUESTION: What do you think my biggest adjustment will be with this baby since it's been fourteen years since I last had a newborn in the house?!

20090307124225AABL6XH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I have some early signs and it's too early for the test to be accurate!?	I'd like help from women who have been pregnant because I've never known one.  I'm supposed to start my period sometime in the past couple/next couple days.  But we started getting alarmed before that because I kept getting nauseous.    I've recently switched to a schedule of staying up/waking up late.  Shortly after I wake up, I sometimes feel sick to my stomach.  Usually it hits about 1:00, even if I wake up a few hours earlier, but then often I'm not up till 11 or 12 after staying up till 1 or so.  I suspect the nausea is because I'm not eating for a long time after I wake up.  Not eating makes me feel queasy sometimes.  I'm hoping that's all.  Does that happen to anyone else (not pregnant)?  If you get too hungry you feel sick and you can't eat?  It varies from day to day, but seems to happen MORE often when I eat very late.  Does morning sickness happen early in the morning, or when you get up, no matter what time of day?      I thought I felt some period cramps yesterday morning, so I felt relieved, but nothing yet.       The last thing to freak me out is that I've had dry mouth when I wake up the last few days.  I was just wondering why, and I got nervous, so I Googled "dry mouth pregnancy," and apparently that's an early sign too.      I took a test a few days ago, but it was a few days before my period was actually supposed to be, and the box says it's not really, really accurate at that point, even though it's an early test.  Even now, it would probably be only at 80% accurate, so I want to save it for a few days and not try again unless my period is about a week late, so I can make sure it won't be a wasted test.      My boyfriend and I always use condoms (hormonal birth control will not work in my body), but sometimes they come off and get squished up inside me and it's a while before we realize it (I'm fairly tight).  Also, we do some strokes before he puts one on, so it's possible that a little semen could have gotten in.      I'm so freaked right now!  Can anyone tell me their experiences (and hopefully say it really doesn't sound like I am)?  But don't lie, I just HOPE you can tell me I'm probably not.
20090307141651AAJtubE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How should I attempt this?	Basically I am trying to patch things up with this guy.    We dated over the summer, he was an *** to me, we broke up. Long story short.      Two days ago he talked to my friend and was like "um, does she (meaning me) hate me? I was such an *** to her." So apparently he's been thinking about me and what he did all school year.          I don't hate him and I would actually like to be friends with him because we got a long really well. Should I message him and say something or just smile at him at school??? I'm not very good at patching up friendships.

She says she has nightmares of me getting kidnapped one day. She always wants me to call her when I get to a friends house. She is ALWAYS worrying about me when I'm out on a walk with my friend.   I know she loves me, but I just really need some space. I rather her care just 95%, not 100%.   All my other friends get to do things and I don't!   How am I gonna live my life when I'm 18?

20090307135246AA3dP5F	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What funny things have your kids said lately?	I love hearing the funny things that kids out there say and do. I also love to share what my kids have done. It gives us all a moment to brag about our little ones. So my answer is, I took my daughter (who is 5) in to register her for kindergarten. On the way into the school she asked me if the school had any boy teachers. I told her "yeah they probably do why?" She looked at me with this really worried look on her face and said "Mommy can you make sure that I don't get a boy teacher?" I asked her "why?" She tells me, "well I heard that boys have this disease called cooties and I don't want to catch it!" Of course I explained to her that if boys had that she would have already caught it from her brother or her daddy. She tells me all serious that you can't catch it from boys in your family, duh mom. I don't think I have ever laughed at something that she said as much as I did that day. So everyone it's now your time to share if you want. What funny thing has your little one said or done lately?

I had unprotected sex with ejaculation on Feb 16th and 17th. My boobs are sore and slight bigger or swollen(or maybe that's just me), I pee a lot more often but not a whole lot,they are very sensitive, I had a metallic taste in my mouth, I am always bloated now, tired and sleepy. I was thinking that I could be pregnant because I know that I had sex around my ovulation with 2 ejaculations in me.Then when I would make a sudden movement I would get a sharp kind of pain in my left lower abdomen just above my pelvis. The pain would only last a few seconds then go away. Wednesday I had cramping for a little and then it went away. Thursday I had nothing just a lot of discharge. So I tested Thursday afternoon with first response and it came out negative. I tested Friday morning and it came out negative. All Friday I had an increase amount of discharge. It was so much I thought that either my period had came on or I had pee'd myself because my panties were that wet(sorry if that's tmi). Later that day I had brown discharge and then that night a little bit of bleeding with less then mild cramping which I thought was strange because my periods are usually 5-6 days and heavy with cramps. This 1 started very lightly and hardly any cramps. It didn't even use up half of half of the pad.Right now I just have very mild cramping through my left thy and bleeding lightly but it is taking up the pad.

20090307140608AARRqmT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What happens if the baby never drops? (Even during labour?)?	I'm in labour right now, my contractions are about 12 minutes apart. (It's my due date today, go figure!!) Yesterday I was 2 cm dilated and the OB did a stretch and sweep. Let's just say it worked. But she said the baby was very, very high and seemed perplexed. It seems she never dropped! She said that "sometimes it happens during labor." But what if it doesn't? Does that mean a C section or is there anything they can do?       I'm going to ask all this when we go to the hospital,  I was just wondering if anybody had any insights.       And could somebody wish me and the baby luck? :D      Thanks

I will call the doctor, but they don't want to see me at the hospital until my contractions are 5 min apart.       Today is my due date- yesterday at the appointment I was 2 cm dilated. I was achy all night and had a few irregular contractions. At 6 a.m. the painful contractions started. I've been having regular, painful (so painful) contractions since 7 a.m. They are pretty regular, they get closer together when I'm up and about. They are every 10 to 15 minutes (a couple of times today they have been 5 min or 30 min apart, but they are pretty consistently around 13 min apart)  and don't seem to be getting closer together.       The pain is insanely intense. It's impossible to talk or move and the pain is like the worse period cramps you can imagine, the pain radiates down my legs to my knees and it's very very intense.       What do you think? It's been 10 hours of this.

20090307113321AAmg8oU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Advice on my mom..???	Well, let me just say I'm not a great daughter. I talk back, talk down to my mom, have a tendency to scream at her or try to push her out of my life. I really love my mom but some things that she does trigger the above ^. She goes into my room anytime she wants, without knocking- just barging in.. and she lays down on my bed and has to marvel at how "cozy" everything is. Really, really annoying. She gets mad at me and starts yelling at me for not cleaning my room, gets mad at me if I start to cry after she manages to succesfully crush my hopes and dreams. I love her more than anyone but she really gets under my skin (to sum it up- control freak, neat freak, etiquette specialist freak, annoying, too distant, or too close). Recently, she told me she hated me because I talked her down in front of my friend (well on the phone with my friend)- this is getting too long, so all I want to know is what the **** to do with this relationship?? How do I win her over on my side- being nice doesn't help, talking doesn't help.

This question needs to be answered in one of two ways;      1) As a current parent, would you send your child or children to a private school if you child got accepted to the college even if you knew you could not afford the college.      2) As a future parent, would you consider sending your child to a private college if your child or children got accepted knowing that you could not afford the college.

Before you conceived, did you just start a healthy diet, or lose some weight, anything like that?     I'm asking because I have pcos, and they say that going on a healthy diet and losing excess weight will make it easier to conceive.

20090307134402AAG2UvM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breast feeding help for first time BF mom?	I had my son about 2 weeks ago and have been breast feeding him.  He gets about 1 bottle of formula per day so I can sleep (I had a csection).      The past 4 days or so he nurses every 1 hr 20 min which seemed odd.  That means he sleeps no longer than an hour at a time (yes, I am exhausted).  Today I decided to pump all day rather than BF to see how much he is getting.      I pumped every 1.5 hrs and only got 1/4 of an ounce from BOTH breasts COMBINED at each pumping.  That means 1/2 ounce every 1.5 hours.  I assume that is what he is getting to eat (I have a hospital grade pump).      He is 18 days old so I think he needs more than what I am producing plus he is up every 1.5 hrs.  The only time he will sleep for 3 hrs is after a bottle of formula (3 ounces).      I am eating 3 meals a day w/ a snack of a fruit and pretzels in between meals.  I drink 4 cups of coffee through out the day and over 100 oz of water throughout the day (I like water, have always drank a lot).      He urinates at least 10-14 times per day and has a bowel movement every few days.      How can I increase my milk supply?      Should I be concerned about the little amount of milk he is getting?      How can I help him be satisfied longer after each feeding so he will sleep longer?
20090307114012AAXW1qc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	If you breastfeed and formula feed does baby still get the same benefits?	My daughter is 5 days old and was born on Monday the 2nd March 4 days over due weighing 6lbs exactly. Yesterday (6th March) she was weighed and had dropped too 5lb 7oz. I thought this was typical practice for a newborn and as they use more energy sucking etc and sometimes their weight drops to begin with.      However, my midwife said she was not obviously getting enough from my breast and I may not be producing enough milk. She feeds six times a day and the midwife said I should breastfeed her for 3 of the feeds and formula feed for 3 of the feeds, alternating between them. I was so disappointed as I wanted to breastfeed her for 3 months at the very least.      Would my daughter still get the same benefits from breastfeeding than a baby that is solely breastfed if she was given formula too?      During each feed my daughter will take one breast for 10-15 mins, I wind her and offer her the other breast which she always takes for 10 15 mins then I wind her again before offering again very rarely does she take it occassinally she does and she will feed from it for 5-10mins. When she no longer took the breast I took this as an indicator that she had had enough. Each feed lasts about 45mins.      I no a midwife is a professional however in this instance, as her mother, I feel she is getting enough from breastfeeding. Would it be incredibly foolish to ignore the midwife and continue to solely breastfeed?       She is due to be weighed again on friday. I want to continue solely breastfeeding her just now and if she still does not put on weight re-evaluate the situation. Or would other Mum's just go with what the midwifes says?      Also I pumped for 3 of her feeds today just to see how much I was actually producing and how much she was taking. Two of the feeds she took 3oz and the other 4oz. Again the feeds lasted about 45mins, she is a slow drinker though.      Do you think she is getting enough from me or should I introduce formula?      Thanks for your opinions :).
20090307141250AAnxq2W	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Im so Confused. Should you wake your newborn baby during the night for a feed if they do not wake themselves?	Im struggling with my newborn daughter's feeding pattern and whether she is receiving enough.      I posted this question earlier       http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       It has all the details of her feeding. However, I getting told so many different things to do by experts, friends and family.       She sleeps right through from 10.30pm til 6 am and doesn't wake once by herself. The midwife told me to leave her as she is in a routine which is a good thing and not disturb it, if she is hungry she would let me know. However, I ve also been told you should wake your newborn every 4 hrs during the night to feed them if they do not wake themselves.      What is correct thing to do?      Thanks!!!

20090307133259AAJlSen	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy Problems & Issues?	OK, so first off I found out on February 23 that I have placental abruption. Which means I am bleeding behind the placenta, and when I found this out I was about 16 weeks along.  She put me on bed rest, and I can not cook, clean, drive, pick up my 2 yr old son, and pick up anything heavier than a gallon of milk.. and I am suppose to have no stress.  I am a full-time student, part-time worker, and the mother of a toddler, so I know you get the picture.  Well my husbands job started letting him work from home half a day after we found out what was wrong.  He worked 130-530 at the office, the 530-10:00 at home to help me.      Well then this Thursday..he got laid off, so now we have NO income coming in, and I don't know how much more I can take.  I am so stressed, depressed, and feel like I am losing all faith in life.        Does anyone have any suggestions on just making it through?
20090307113403AA212Ps	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Does anyone here think mothers who put their children in daycare are bad mothers?	I've come across people / parents from time to time, in real life and on this board who think that parents who put their children in daycare are horrible people.   I don't think so at all, and I always get so mad when I hear people say that! Some families don't have the luxury of being able to have one parent unemployed. And I'm not using the word 'luxury' because I think being a SAHM is easy, I know first hand it's not. What I mean is in the cases of single parents, or low income families; obviously 95% of the time the single parent will have to work, and put the kids in daycare, and same with most low income families.      But in my own opinion, I think daycares are good for kids. It teaches them to properly interact with other children, learn to share, learn to raise their hand, ask to go to the bathroom, classroom manners, etc. Right now I'm still on mat. leave, and we're kind of mulling over the idea of me being a SAHM, but even if I decide thats the best choice for us, I will still probably put my daughter in daycare a few afternoons a week just to get used to the environment for when she attends school.      I've heard mothers say that parents who put their children in daycare are unfit and shouldn't have kids if they don't look after them, and I just think that is ridiculous. Some parents don't have a choice.      What are your thoughts?

If he's separated from me for more than a minute, he begins shouting for me, so you might imagine how he feels when I leave him at school every day, or today, when I dropped him off at his grandparents' house today. He begins screaming and crying and causes a scene, and it stresses me out and makes me feel like a bad father. How can I get him to stop clinging?   A few months ago, he was in a car accident, and was in the hospital for a few days. The accident wasn't too serious, but he was in the hospital for evaluation. Maybe he felt that I was leaving him there and didn't love him. Does this make sense? Could that cause him to be so clingy?   Please help

20090307132614AAdXiRo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	During pregnancy, did your ultrasound ever show a "soft marker"? And was baby ok?	Have any of you had the ultrasound show a "soft marker"?       We went for our level 2 ultrasound at 18 weeks. The tech was kind of with holding...I could just tell. Before my husband came in the room, I asked "please be honest, does everything look ok?". She listed off some major things and said they all looked great...but when I asked "so everything looks normal?" she replied "Well, I did see something. It's nothing to worry abou though". I asked what it was and she said "I saw something on the brain, but it can be totally healthy".I did not tell anyone, not even my husband. If it is something 'not to worry about' I don't want this (our second child) being labelled before it's even born. I just wouldn't want anyone to look at it once it's born and think "Oh, maybe it's doing this or that because of the spot on it's brain"...      So when we had our follow up appointment with our OB/GYN I asked him about it before my husband came in the room. He said the tech saw a small cyst on the brain, otherwise known as a 'soft marker'. He said he had the quad screen test number run again, and that they were so low that even if he multiplied them by 10, they still wouldn't be in the risky range. He assured me he has no worries about this baby, ordered another ultrasound at 26 weeks to help reassure me. Given that I have been told not to worry, should I tell my husband?      And has anyone else ever had an ultrasound show a "soft marker" but there baby was completely normal?      Any insight would be great!
20090307124107AA8X0wb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I'm having more babysitting problems... Or am I just overreacting?	Last night, my husband and I went out for a dinner with my brother-in-law and his girlfriend, and we were staying out from 5-8 PM and going to dinner. We have 4 kids and they're all girls, ages 8, 5, 3 and 1. We would've tooken the kids with, but we were going to be seated in the bar area or the restaurant, and kids aren't permitted in there.       So, we hired two girls to babysit our kids. A 15 and 16 year old girl. We had the 16 year old babysit for us before, but we never had the 15 year old babysit.      We checked in occasionally, and everything seemed to be going smoothly, but when we got home, the house was a mess!       I wasn't expecting maid services, but toys and dvds were strewn everywhere, and it seemed as if the babysitters had taken to a delight as to clean out my refrigerator and of course leave empty pickle jars and half drinken cans of Pepsi everywhere.      It looked like I left with my house and came back to the aftermath of a hurricane!      So, I paid them but I cut back on their pay. Instead of paying them each for $8 an hour, I paid them each $6 for an hour.      Did I overreact or do the right thing?
20090307112506AAuaFwd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Did I handle this right? Am I a bad parent?	I am 20 and my parents died. I take care of my 9 year old brother, 4 year old brother, and 13 year old sister. The 9 year old brother (his name is Luke) has been hitting the 13 year old (Claudia) with wood, switch, and a belt. I confronted him with it and he lied to me. I gave him many chances to tell the truth but each story was different. Luke has ADHD and Claudia has bipolar. I knew the truth because I saw the bruises on my sister. I told him to knock it off and to leave her alone. When I got home from work about 50 minutes ago I saw Luke beating my sister. I grabbed Luke and took him to his room and helped my sister. She was in a lot of pain so i told her to go into the hot tub and just relax. She said she can't so I told her to just go into the tub and relax. She said she really couldn't so I told her to just go lay in bed then. I calmed down and went to Luke and put him over my lap and spanked him. I didn't leave any marks and did it with my hand only. I also grounded him for a month and took away the video games. I feel really bad about spanking my brother. I gave my sister some ice packs and Tylenol. She already has a shattered thumb and fractured wrist and Luke hit the cast with a big piece of wood. She is laying in her room relaxing. I just feel really bad that I spanked my brother and that my sister got hurt. Am I a bad parent? Was this the right thing to do to my brother?       How do I get Claudia to feel better? Should I take her to the emergency room for her thumb and wrist? She is in a lot of pain.

We've been teaching her how to drive and she's a pretty good driver already. Have you ever taken your child driving when they're in a less than ideal state to drive? I'm thinking that it's a good idea since every driver has had to drive at least once when they're not always in the best condition to drive.
20090307143029AAUibJz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Should I.......................?	Should I drop my Spanish class for a different class?   I'm usually an A or B student, but for some odd reason I really suck at Spanish. IDK why but I do. I guess it just wasn't mean for me, ya know?   I mean, I memorize the words fine, and my OLDER sister asks me how to say some things, but I'm getting a D + in that class, which sucks. My Dad would murder me if he found out.    I would lose credits for dropping, but I'm an eighth grader taking two classes at the highschool (math and spanish) and i could easily get credits as a freshman. I mean everybody else is getting their credits as a freshman!      So should I drop...or not?

20090307140545AA2jwQZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What do you all think? Please read!?	So starting at midnight yesterday I was having really bad contractions that were waking me up like every half an hour. They weren't really horrible but they were painful and I was also having EXTREME back pain. Well I woke up and was still having them and around 10am I went to the bathroom and there was a lot of blood. I told my husband and he was like freaking out and so I called the doctor and they wanted me to come in. Well I'm still having contractions about every 15 minutes at this point and they can't see me until 3:15pm. Well I go in there and they check me and I'm still completely closed and I forgot to ask them how effaced I was because I was 50% on Feb 26th. After I left the doctors office I was still having really bad contractions that were about 10 minutes apart and they were getting really painful. Well last night they seemed to calm down a little bit and I only woke up to them about 3 times but I'm not sure if I was having others and just not waking up. Today I haven't had as many but my lower back is still really hurting me. Does this sound normal? I'm in so much pain and I really can't believe that I haven't started dilating yet. Does anyone think I may start dilating soon?       Also I'm about 37 weeks along!

20090307141332AAcHwQ8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Criticism on Yahoo Answers?	From reading Q&A's on here I've noticed something. It seems that there are a lot of people who judge others for their parenting decisions, but there is a trend. In general (not all people, but in general):      Breastfeeders tend to criticize, while formula feeders do not      Non Spanker's criticize and Spanker's do not      People who don't circumcise tend to criticize while those who do don't judge      Pro Vaccine and Anti Vaccine tend to criticize each other      While Co-Sleep and Anti Co-sleep tend to not criticize each other at all      I know not all people do, I'm saying that this is a general trend I've noticed. I mean I'm a breastfeeder and don't think that there is anything wrong with formula feeding. I'm just asking, does anyone else see this trend?

She has asked "what's that?" when seeing me use the toilet and in the shower, and I wasn't sure what to say.  Part of me wants to say, very matter of fact, it's my/your vulva.  I'm not wild about the word, but it's the correct anatomical term.  But I also kind of want to say pee-pee!        What does anyone else think?  Any thoughts would be welcomed.

I have a friend who is all into this babywise book ( which I am not a follower of ..)   and the book talks about getting your baby to sleep through the night at eight weeks.   First of all, this seems really young to MAKE a baby sleep through the night. I can understand if they do it on their own... but..      Anyways, she said that the first night when he woke up they just let him cry and he cried for half an hour!  This seems like so long to let such a little baby cry to me! It seems like he was hungry and she was depriving him or something.. then every  night it got less and less time.  But i dunno... he is three months now and I know that babies that age don't do a lot, but he just seems so lethargic and almost like hes a vegetable or soemthing sometimes.. and doesn't have any of those cute baby rolls.. and another baby that was on the babywise plan was the same way.. I swear my daughter was only like that the first month!  I don't think this book is good for babies.. they just don't seem right to me! its like it goes against your natural motherly instinct or something.. but it might just be me.

20090307133417AAA5bHy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Should I continue letting my little sister sleep next to me?	I'm 16, and was an only child...but then my mother adopted a little girl from the Ukraine, well she's 14 but she's small/thin for her age and has Cerebral Palsy so can't walk. She suffered a lot of trauma in her past. She got attached to my mother fast, and very attached to me too. She always likes to sleep next to me in bed at night, and at first she just likes if I kind of hold her close or rub her back until she falls asleep. But then once she's asleep she'll have a very restless sleep, she'll move around a lot, have bad dreams, and kind of whine/cry in her sleep. She'd wet the bed too if we didn't keep her in diapers at night. It is hard for me to go to sleep myself because of all her movement and such. Should I continue letting her sleep next to me? How can I make her have a more peaceful sleep?

20090307125433AATiOO4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Has anyone had low HCG levels but gone on to have a healthy baby?	Hi went for an early scan yesterday morning as i had been having bleeding and had passed a clot, the lady that scanned me said that she couldnt see anythin on the scan and believed that i had had a complete miscarriage, afterwards i was told i had to speak to the doctor before i was allowed home, the doctor wanted to blood to check my hcg levels to confirm what the scan had said      Now i received my results last night and the lady said they were very low at 22 and that for pregnancy they look for between 10-1000 and although mine were very low at 22 they need to do repeat bloods in 48hrs (2moz) to check whether my hcg levels are rising or falling      Now if i had had a m/c then my hcg levels should have fallen further from yesterday morning til now surely? but i did i did a first response test this evening (now they say their tests need hcg levels of at least 25 to get a positive) but i got a faint positive now if my levels were still 22 or lower (which they should have by now) surely i wouldnt have been able to get a positive test result? so could this mean my levels are rising?

My 20 month old son will scream and grab his belly, arch his back, and move around. He says mommy, mommy, no! and there is nothing I can do to help him. He won't let me rub his belly, I have to force medicine, and it only helps for a little bit, and I try my best to comfort him. His stools have been yellow. He had vomiting and diarrhea last week, and this week, constipation. He had blood in his stools yesterday. I took him to the emergency room Wednesday night it was so awful and they did x-rays. They determined no cause, and said to schedule an appointment with his regular doctor. I took him today, and they felt his stomach, said there is not obstructions, did some blood work, and told me to give him more fiber. He gave me a sheet with foods containing high fiber, and he regularly eats these foods. I can't take much more of this screaming, and not knowing how to help him. He has had episodes similar to this in the past, so I believe something is WRONG internally. I don't feel like anyone understands how serious this is. Anyone else experienced this with their child or have any ideas of what I should do to help him?

How would you feel?	if you knew that the local sheriff's department let a convicted rapist and child molester stroll right out of the court house and is now on the loose in your town or state or even the nation?  I asked this question in Law Enforcement category and why am I surprised that an officer responded and said it must not be true.  Here is the article from Arizona Republic.  I want to write to the governor and ask her WTF?  While no one was looking (???), he just walked out of the court room and now that can't find him anywhere.  How can they let a convicted rapist walk out of the court? When you are in jail and go to court, aren't you normally shackled and have a guard as an escort? The sheriff's dept. held a news conference asking for the public's help in finding him. Oh boy - would I hate to be the officer that was in charge of him.       This part was taken directly from the AZCENTRAL.COM site:   Cruz was serving a life sentence with no chance of parole for 35 years after sexually assaulting his girlfriend's 9-year-old daughter in 2004. The mother allowed Cruz to take the girl riding in his ice-cream truck, where he sexually assaulted her.      The girl became pregnant, and because she was too young to carry the baby, she had an abortion.      Cruz was on trial for two other sexual assaults in 2003 — one on a girl younger than 15 — after his DNA was matched to those attacks. That trial was nearing an end when Cruz took advantage of a lapse in security, slipped from his restraints and walked out of the courthouse. He even stole a leather coat from a court commissioner's office in full view of at least one court employee.      Cruz's trial continued after his escape, and a jury last week found him guilty in absentia of sexual assault, sexual conduct with a minor, sexual abuse and two counts of kidnapping related to two attacks in June and July 2003.

I was having a conversation with my dad the other day, and he said that one of his huge pet peeves was when people would tell him how to raise us (3 girls), especially when they didn't have kids of their own.      I agree with him in a way. My husband and I don't have any children, yet, but I think that it would tick me off if someone that didn't have children was trying to tell me what to do with mine like they are super-mom (or dad.) That's not to say that all people that don't have children don't know what to do. They could have a dozen little cousins and younger siblings, in which I would take a little more stock in their opinion than I would in some single person that works next to a daycare center.      That's, also, not to say that some people that have kids don't know what the heck they are doing. My two little cousins had the misfortune of having a mother that treated them more like a meal ticket, and abandoned them when they were no longer of use.      Thoughts and opinions?

20090307143735AAnhK2j	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I asked this a few hours ago but NO answers...=0(?	Im really confused. My last period was Feb 8th and Im due for my period tomorrow (Mar 8) and to make a long story short .. ive had 3 normal periods in a row so far, because I was on depo last year (1 injection only) and my period stopped for a while. But its safe to say Im back to normal b/c i got dec, jan, and feb all normally.    I was online at storknet and babycenter.com to check my ovulation and it said the 22nd i think. So my husband and I thought it was safe to have unprotected sex (and him ejaculating in me) from the 25th and on...   Well my friends told me recently that my ovulation times could be wacked still from just getting back to normal with my periods and I could have a possibility of becomming pregnant. The last few days I felt dizzy and I've had headaches like CRAZY the last few days. I did start a new job, so I thought maybe I could link the headaches to that b/c it is pretty stressfull, but I am not certain on that. I also have been feeling SO nauseated to where I cant eat alot. (That is on and off)    Last but not least, today,..(the day before my period) I feel like gas bubbles popping in my stomach, some cramping, etc. But one thing I noticed is that some of my cramps are much higher up like a few inches under my boobs so some of them are in my higher part of my stomach which is odd.    What I am wondering, is if the slight cramping could definately mean I am getting my period tomorrow, or if that is pregnancy related? Because I did list alot of other symptoms.   Anyhow, I tok 2 pregnancy tests. 1 was taken 2 days ago and 1 was taken yesterday. I have one left so I will just wait till the day after I miss my period if I do so.      Thanks so much! Sorry if it was a little lengthy!

I had an ultrasound at 6 weeks-the tech said there was only 1 heartbeat...however, I feel HUGE.

20090307144924AAzC8nf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Question about a pram from a new born?	This might sound like a totally stupid question but do new born's need a completely flat laying pram, or is a regular pram that reclines quite far back ok to use? Im originally from australia and i had never really even seen a flat laying pram. My mother never used one nor has any of my friends, but here in germany where i live now, my husbands mother seems to think is totally wrong to not use a flat laying pram. they are very popular here in germany, i think its more of a fashion trend then anything, but then i could be wrong. Is there a reasonable argument that they are better? Many thanks in advance! :)

20090307144256AArbJgQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I feel amazing and I'm 31 weeks pregnant, anyone else as lucky as me?	With my first I felt like crap by the time I reached 31 weeks, my back hurt and so did everything else. With this pregnancy I feel amazing!! No pain or anything, in fact if I didn't have a big belly and constant kicking inside of me I'd swear I wasn't really pregnant. Did anyone else have a less painful second pregnancy or am I just odd?
20090307144710AANOEzQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Please read! What do you think?	So starting at midnight yesterday I was having really bad contractions that were waking me up like every half an hour. They weren't really horrible but they were painful and I was also having EXTREME back pain. Well I woke up and was still having them and around 10am I went to the bathroom and there was a lot of blood. I told my husband and he was like freaking out and so I called the doctor and they wanted me to come in. Well I'm still having contractions about every 15 minutes at this point and they can't see me until 3:15pm. Well I go in there and they check me and I'm still completely closed and I forgot to ask them how effaced I was because I was 50% on Feb 26th. After I left the doctors office I was still having really bad contractions that were about 10 minutes apart and they were getting really painful. Well last night they seemed to calm down a little bit and I only woke up to them about 3 times but I'm not sure if I was having others and just not waking up. Today I haven't had as many but my lower back is still really hurting me. Does this sound normal? I'm in so much pain and I really can't believe that I haven't started dilating yet. Does anyone think I may start dilating soon?       Also I'm about 37 weeks along!

20090307144911AApyeKa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I am so sick of my best friend's overcontrolling mom! What do I do?	I had plans to hang out with my best friend today, and we had these plans since Thursday, and his mom disallowed us from hanging out because he had to spend all night studying for a chemistry test we don't even have until Thursday, and we've had review sessions in class over the course of one-and-a-half weeks. It's not the first time she's done it, either, and that's what pisses me off the most. She once wouldn't allow my best friend to come over because my best friend "needed" to clean his room and do his homework, and she KNEW we had plans to go see a movie that day, and she KNEW we had those plans for about half a week. The thing is, she has NOTHING wrong with me, so don't say it's because she doesn't trust me, or whatever. She thinks of me as her second son. I'm just so fed up with her controlling my and my friend's relationship! She barely lets us do anything on weekends, and we haven't hung out on the weekend since we were in eighth grade, and we're sophomores in high school! I am so fed up with it!! I'm so fed up with his mom! What do I do? It's driving me insane! She's not letting us do ANYTHING together!

Im currently 18 weeks pregnant, but not yet really showing nor have I gained much weight...I know typically you tend to eat more but im eating habits have remained the same, and Im concerned that maybe im not eaitng enough and not geting the proper amount to my baby if there is such a thing... This is my first pregnancy so im concerned although my doctor has not said much about it, im still worried...help anyone
20090307144427AA7pXsv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Booster seat or not....?	Okay, so to start off, I am extremely skinny. Which is just the way I was born. I am 14 years old, almost 15. I am 5 feet 2 inches tall and I weigh 68 pounds. I eat a lot and I am not anorexic or anything, I have a doctor working to raise my weight so please do not answer with comments about my weight. So, anyways, I was in the car sitting in the front seat with my mom and she was speeding so we got pulled over and when the police man finished giving my mom her warning he asked my mom and I how much I weighed and I told him 68 pounds. And he said it was required for me to sit in a booster seat until I reach 80 pounds, no height requirements or age, just 80 pounds. And he said there is no warning if I am caught next time without a booster seat in the back seat. So, my mom of course is like a safety freak and doesn't want to get a ticket because we are low on money so she said that if I am caught I have to pay the ticket. So it is up to me if I sit in one or not. But, I have like no money and the ticket is like over a hundred dollars. But, it would be so ridiculous if I were to sit in one, even though it is for my safety. I am just going to feel like a baby which I shouldn't. I need opinions to help make the decision whether to sit in one or not. Thanks.

20090307145626AAhEopV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Am i pregnant or am i not pregnant?	i have been TTC since november and have not had a period since 1-14-09. I bought 2 first response tests. The first test was a dud. It did not even show a test line. So i took another and it was Negative.   2 days later i went to the doctor and they also preformed a urine pregnancy test, which also was negative.      I do not have sore brests, but i have been experiencing na nausea through out the day everyday, an extreme heightened sense of smell, and a sudden dislike for foods i love. I have also been very tired. At the doctor i was told i could have an upper respiratory infection, however there was no evidence to support this except a slight fever and a minutely stuffy nose. I was not even give any medicine, just told to rest.         Is there a chance these negatives could be wrong?   Is it normal if i did have low homone levels, not to be experiencing breast changes at what would be about the 8th week of pregnancy?   What should i do?         i have also been experiencing a lot of lower back and right hip pain all the way into my thigh over the last week. I have been told this could be related to implantation or the uterus expanding. is this true?
