PmNf0YICaa	1. I believe there may be life on other planets.  Why are we the only ones to be able to survive?  Surely there must be other planets with the same conditions as Earth.  I don't think it would be possible to meet any "aliens".  As we know, there is no life elsewhere in the solar system, and we simply do not have the technology to contact aliens in other solar systems, if they do exist, just yet.<br>  <br>  2.  I am not scared of ghosts, since I do not believe they exist.  I do not believe in an afterlife.<br>  <br>  3.  I love chocolate, just like the majority of females out there.  You can never go wrong with milk chocolate.<br>  <br>  4.  I cannot sing.  Period.  Maybe if I was in a choir...<br>  <br>  5.  I would love to help others by becoming a teacher.  Short term, however, I would just like to be happy, be a good girlfriend, and keep my grades up.<br>  <br>  6.  I am a natural blonde.  Not a dirty blonde, but a bright yellow.  I love it.<br>  <br>  7.  I live in southern California, so I'veee been to Disneyland several times.  My friend even has a season pass.  I've been to Disneyworld as well.<br>  <br>  8.  Girl:  I can keep my hair messy for a week.  I love to go camping, so this is kind of mandatory.  (Camping as in tents.  Motor homes are NOT camping)  However, I refuse to wear pink.<br>  <br>  9.  I try not to get involved in celebrity life, but a man should never hit a woman, no matter what happens.  Likewise, women should never hit men either.<br>  <br>  10.  I do not.<br>  <br>  11.  Pink.  It is such a sterotype that all girls love the color pink.  My favorite color is yellow, then blue, then purple.<br>  <br>  12.  I reuse plastic bags for my lunches.  I get them at the store, and pack my lunch in it the next day, so I get two uses out of them.<br>  <br>  13.  I have a wonderful boyfriend.<br>  <br>  14.  I like certain types of spicy food, especially salsa.<br>  <br>  15.  Cinema.  (We call them movie theaters where I'm from).  I absolutly hate shopping.  You spend tons of money on stuff you probably will wear once.  And who wants to put their clothes on and off that many times in one day?<br>  <br>  16.  I like some sports.  I like to play softball and soccer, but I don't like basketball or football.  I don't like to watch sports either, except maybe baseball or basketball, just because of the energy of the fans.  I'm also in marching band, which I completely count as a sport because of the level of difficulty of playing an instrument and marching.  We have to run, do push-ups, and practice several hours a day.  We also compete.  <br>  <br>  17.  Some.  But I don't go around smelling too many herbs.<br>  <br>  18.  I've slapped my friends.  But only if they slap me first. =)<br>  <br>  19.  How does one agree with politics?  Who's?  <br>  <br>  20.  I hate fashion shows.  I think they put an image of "beautiful" into girls' minds and make them feel inferior if they don't look the same as the models.  Why can't we celebrate differences instead of trying to make everyone look the same?<br>  <br>  21.  I love Twix.  It is my second favorite after Hundred Grand Bars.<br>  <br>  22.  I've been to several amusement parks including Disneyland, California Adventue, Disneyworld, Hurricane Harbor, Knotts Berry Farm, Seaworld, and county fairs.  I'm sure there are several more, but I can't seem to remember them.  Disneyland is my all-time favorite though.  All of these except Disneyworld, which is in Florida, are in Southern California.<br>  <br>  23.  I like thrill rides, but I can't go upside down.  It's my one fear.  I don't know which was scariest, but I love Splash Mountain at Disneyland, Expedition Everest at the Wild Animal Park in Disneyworld, and Journey to Atlantis at Seaworld.<br>  <br>  24.  Sadly, I am not old enough to drive and will not end up getting my license until I am 17 or 18.<br>  <br>  25.  I hate missing school because of the make-up work, so no.  I receiently had to miss school to go to the doctor because of an ear infection.  And it was on my one month anniversery with my boyfriend. =(|`|J0G4lRrNaa	1. No and no<br>  2. Not really.<br>  3.

H6b5TbbIaa	buzzing usually indicates a bad ground connection.  could be in the cables, pedals, guitar or amp.  <br>  <br>  you said everything is quiet unless yr using the pedal, so i'd suspect the problem is there.  it might be worth the time to take it to a qualified repair tech.<br>  <br>  some pointers....<br>  <br>  if yr using a strat style, or guitar with single coil pickups, you WILL get buzz. 60 cycle hum is the technical term, and it's the result of yr pickups acting like little antennaes picking up all the current in the room around you.  if you play a strat style guitar with 3 single coils, try using the 2 or 4 position on the selector switch.  this will provide hum cancellation.  if yr guitar has a humbucker, use that pickup.  if yr in a room with flourescent lights or lots of electronic stuff plugged in, you might need to change rooms.<br>  <br>  could be anything really.  but troubleshoot the cords first.  that's the easiest fix.<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  j.

f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	<a href="http://www.startrekmovie.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.startrekmovie.com/</a><br>  <br>  It appears from the trailer that they took a page from the movie "The Last Star Fighter" and through the trainees to the lions as all the other ships are down and only the cadettes are there to man the ship. This of course stahnd in the face of all the Star trek lore to date which has Christopher Pike preceding James T. Kirk to the helm of the Enterprise which is where Kirk supposedly first meets Mr. Spock. This film seeks to change that as well.<br>  <br>  Here is the UK version of the trailer:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.startrekmovie.com/intl/uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.startrekmovie.com/intl/uk/</a><br>  <br>  Some are saying that what you are seeing is a parallel universe where things change but the results are similar.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://io9.com/351995/crazy-new-star-trek-movie-rumors" rel="nofollow">http://io9.com/351995/crazy-new-star-tre...</a><br>  <br>  This one makes the most sense which is to say they are stealing a page from "The Terminator" and seding a Romulin back in time to kill the great James T Kirk before he is great. Spock in turn follows to save Kirk but in doin this the pair change the history of the Enterprise, killing Pike instead of the fate he is supposed to meet. This plot is not good but it is what it is.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://movieblog.ugo.com/index.php/movieblog/more/star_trek_spoiler_zone/" rel="nofollow">http://movieblog.ugo.com/index.php/movie...</a>|`|XJRYAhZVaa	Yeah, I saw the new trailer as well. To me, that's what I got from it. I am thinking he might become Captain toward the end of the film since the movie is suppose to be about him before that and how the crew came together.|`|wQOoiAwsaa	To my understanding, there is a graphics novel to the movie called countdown. To my knowledge this is to be a prequel to the movie. I found it at star trek gift shop. I don't know if there will be a mini series on this as the name implies. For those of all who wish to see this, here is the link to where I found the book.<br>  I have not read it yet. So I can't tell you if its any good.|`|HkdTCqnSaa	The movie covers more than just Kirk's days at Star Fleet Academy.  He was 34 when he first became a Captain.

But it's lousy - I know!!!|`|fmQIU0zqaa	This sounds very confusing to me. If you know for sure your sister stole something of yours, then you have the right to search her room or anybody else's.

I have to say that she knows nothing about u because if she knew how nice u r in person she would never treat u like that<br>  i read that u tried to run away, well i must warn u that if u get caught then u will be in jail, and worse, ur mom or dad will judge if u can go home or not. and believe me, jail is much worse than ur house. if they said that they are ok with ur behavior and u go home with them then they will even treat u worse. so i suggest that u don't escape<br>  <br>  i know that suicidal thought cross ur mind when u r depressed (like me)... but just think, Do your parents worth ur life? what will happen when u die? ur parents will cry after u and feel sorry that they treated u like that and u will be under the dirt. what will happen next? in two years u will be just a memory, in 5 years almost no one will remember u, even if they do, it will be just another wasted moment of their day.<br>  <br>  u said that u will tell the counsler, it's ur choice ofcourse, but how will ur life and the life of ur little brother be? u will move from house to house and all ur relatives might hate u (exept ur cousin maybe).<br>  u will have no life<br>  <br>  i suggest that u wait until u r 18 so u can be independent and so u can do what u want to.<br>  <br>  i'm really sorry i didn't answer earlier, hope to talk to u soon|`|1wDkKyLCaa	sounds like you need to get the heck outta there, your mom doesn't seem right in her mind, that is not healthy, is there anyone you can stay with|`|vbO4edaraa	Call the police or your local child protective services.

Im so sorry.<br>  My mom is abusive aswell, just not in the same way. She drinks and Drinks and Drinks, and insults me like your mother does. But ive learned to suck it up. Because there is no where else in this world for me. Grandparents and my Father are also alcoholics. There not much better.<br>  But you, you NEED help. Your mother should NEVER lay a hand on you. And the insulting, it HAS to stop. You DESERVE alot better then what you are getting in the house you are in right now! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE get help, for me. You re mother is not giving you what you need. She cant give it to you, at least not right now. Please talk to the school, the Police, anyone that can help. You need to get out of that house, the abuse has to stop and you need somewhere better to live. Somewhere you can feel safe and secure to do your homework, and school work peacefully, quietly, without constant fear.<br>  <br>  Your Mother should not be treating you like this. That is absolutly Horrible. I cant imagine how afraid you must be to go home after school. <br>  <br>  Does she drink? Drugs? Anything? Because it doesnt seem normal for her to be so angry, and mean without being drugged up or drunk.<br>  <br>  Please Please Please Get Help! You dont deserve this.<br>  <br>  PLEASE EMAIL ME to talk, anytime, about anything. I can get you some phone numbers, depending on what state you live in, ect. And there is a poster at school, that i will get the number from, its a convedencial help line, anything you say will NOT be told to anything, they will just try to give you some advice.|`|tR36oILvaa	me being me, i would suck it in for a few years, end up hating myself, want to kill myself then change to who i really am. I have changed, my mums not abusive but everyone around me says things that make me feel **** about it. I started talking to a friend, a good friend a friend who listens, and then i started to feel better, i have started letting my true emotions show. I can be happier now its great! Also my 3 breakdowns helped get some attention. I hate crying at school but  i couldn't help it. talk to someone outside the family. It really helps. Our school <br>  counsellor (sp)  helped this girl in my school who apparently has an abusive mother, the school so helping her get out of the house, so it might help!<br>  <br>  Good Luck and i hope everything works out!  <br>  <br>  ~^___________________^~

I think you give to much though. Instead of telling your audience, you need to show them. <br>  <br>  Are you going for a short story or a novel? I think you should try it in first person. like "my name is alice" instead of using 'her'. It makes it sound awkward when you read it. It definitely needs more work, but since your only 12 it's quite understandable. <br>  <br>  use a thesaurus and play with different sentence lengths.<br>  <br>  read 1984, and I think you could get some ideas sparked.<br>  <br>  keep writing!

The reason that 5 years is a big difference with younger people and less of a big deal with two people in their 20's, 30's etc. is because of where we are developmentally.  5 years is a lot larger gap when in the 15 to 20 range, and anyone that supports their 15 year old trying to have a baby as opposed to say.... finishing high school, should not be a parent.|`|2J1Ca4Bbaa	Too much of an age difference, for a fifteen year old at least...<br>  & you're fifteen you shouldn't be having sex or at least<br>  trying for a baby!|`|0FWtWxMGaa	no its nasty hes grown and shes still a kid, then they are both disabled what if he triest to take advantage of her..<br>  think|`|EzOlEHsHaa	I'm 15.<br>  Totally no.<br>  That's pretty wrong.

AB1xk3OBaa	Three songs were played during the ending credits which were not included on the V for Vendetta soundtrack. The first was "Street Fighting Man" by The Rolling Stones. The second was a special version of Ethan Stoller's "BKAB". In keeping with revolutionary tone of the film, excerpts from "On Black Power" by black nationalist leader Malcolm X, and from "Address to the Women of America" by feminist-writer Gloria Steinem were added to the song. Gloria Steinem can be heard saying: "This is no simple reform... It really is a revolution. Sex and race, because they are easy and visible differences, have been the primary ways of organizing human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labour on which this system still depends." The final song was "Out of Sight" by Spiritualized.<br>  <br>  Sorry I couldn't remember which song was the first one so I just copied this from wikipedia|`|08jvhNLDaa	plz dont watch that movie

cc5be59f6a72c9c92331efcf0be00ebaaa	greatest amp i've ever heard is the Hiwatt Studio Stage Combo (20 watts.) It's also $3500. Less than $1300 is a tricky price range, because the really GREAT tube amps -- like the Hiwatts, handwired Marshalls, Fender "tweed" amps, Vox -- are all extremely expensive (sad to say.) <br>  <br>  u could try a Fender Twin Reverb w/ an overdrive pedal, but that would probably run north of $1300. the aforementioned AC-30 is indeed a great amp, but it's at least $2500. You might find an AC-15 (basically a half-powered AC-30) at about $1300, and that would be a very solid buy.<br>  <br>  i've played a peavey classic 30, and i was pretty impressed. it's about $600-$700; and, in my opinion, sounds much better than comparable Fenders (ie, Hot Rod Deluxe, Deville, etc.) Where i've always found the cheaper Fenders to be thin, brittle, fizzy sounding, the peavey struck me as being thicker, warmer, fatter, however u want to say it.<br>  <br>  My nomination for "best amp" here is the 5-watt Epiphone Valve Jr. ($175.) first, it's easy to travel around with because it's so small. second, because it's only 5 watts of power, you can crank it fully and get that pure, thick, saturated power tube distortion WITHOUT violating noise ordinances. trust me -- this amp absolutely screams when the volume knob is opened up all the way. it is an outstanding blues/rock amp.<br>  <br>  5 watts is a lot louder than people think, and u can put a mic in front of it if need be.|`|0vfX40Qxaa	If it were me I'd be looking at combo amps, there are plenty of good ones in that price range.   Play as many different models and styles as you can find in your price range, and get the one that gives you the best, portability, features and most importantly sound that you need.|`|XpDt1bqHaa	Check out Carvin Amps....bang for buck very good. ....their tube amps have been used by many top notch players...don't be fooled...just because Steve vai has Carvin models believe me their clean tones are great too.|`|rRCTvT7Saa	Either a great Fender or Vox tube amp.<br>  <br>  Also, Dr. Z amps are outstanding!|`|79ieDdkhaa	vox ac30
XzicOcyeaa	Personally i much preferred the book. <br>  I think they did a good job making the movie, but as the book is so complex in it's structure and character development, it would have been impossible to convey all of this through film. For example the expression of Amir's sense of guilt and his journey to redemption etc does not come across very powerfully in the movie. Despite this, it is a good film, though probably a lot more enjoyable if you hadn't already read the book, as you wouldn't know what you were missing out on.|`|ClETpYZQaa	I'm a filmmaker, so no idea if this is the sort of answer you want but...<br>  <br>  I didn't like it. Way too Hollywood. A story like that needs to be shot on s16mm, lots of handheld, not with a super polished aesthetic and modern camera moves (technocranes) and a soundtrack that even at one point includes Explosions in the Sky (a great band, but not a suitable one). That's my opinion any how.<br>  <br>  Performances were good. Book is better.|`|HkSSJXE9aa	movies are rarely as good as the book but if you liked the book it's worth the watch you know to at least see  people acting the characters you used to read in the book...

The humor is great and the characters are awesome. The girl's name is Yostuba, meaning "four-leaf" (which is what her hair looks like), and so the title literally means "Yotsuba and ___" - so each chapter has a different theme featuring Yostuba and "something." The style is super cute (from the author of Azumanga Daioh, another awesome slice-of-life four-panel manga turned anime) and just always entertaining in a very innocent sort of way.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yotsuba%26!" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yotsuba%26!</a><br>  <br>  "Train Man: Densha Otoko" is a very sweet tale (short, only three volumes), based on a real story about a nerdy guy who stands up for a beautiful girl being harassed on a train. When she calls him and sends him a thank-you gift, he starts to fall in love with her, and turns to his computer to get advice from people on the Japanese 2channel forum as to how to act around her and further their relationship. The internet-chat motif is interesting, and of course the main romance is very cute, but the nicest thing about it is getting to know a bit about all of the random strangers who follow his posts on the forums, how their opinions and encouragements differ, and how their own life is affected by listening to his story. It just made me smile the whole way through.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Densha_Otoko" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Densha_Otok...</a><br>  <br>  "Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle" is an awesome epic adventure type manga, with great characters, interesting settings in various dimensions, and some hints of romance. It's a CLAMP work, so it has a lot of crossovers / cameos / character appearances and the like from their other series. It follows the quest of a young boy Syaoran to collect "feathers," or memory fragments, of Princess Sakura's memories (featuring alternate versions of the characters from Cardcaptor Sakura). The serialization of the manga is still ongoing (which I usually hate to get into and have to wait for a conclusion!), and at the major plot twist, I felt like it lost some of its more innocent appeal from before and kind of got creeped out, but the story is still really good overall.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsubasa_Chronicle" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsubasa_Chr...</a><br>  <br>  And finally, "Chobits" is a very interesting futuristic ecchi/romance between an accidental-pervert/nice-guy-type college student and a humanoid computer girl of particularly special design. The characters, backstories, and messages in the manga are great, and in my opinion it far surpasses the anime version of the same franchise.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsubasa_Chronicle" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsubasa_Chr...</a><br>  <br>  Those are my top favorites, heh-heh - but if you were looking for recommendations for yourself, you should definitely look at some of Tanemura's other works, if you haven't already. Full Moon wo Sagashite is wonderful, and what I read of Kamikaze Kaito Jeanne was pretty good.<br>  <br>  Also, I don't read much Korean manhwa, but I checked out a bit of "Chocolat" and "President Dad" and they were pretty cute - what I'd probably call "shoujo" if they were Japanese.|`|zCSYHlpraa	If u like shojo manga, then i highly recommend a couple of my favorites, Beauty pop, which is about a girl who is a talented hairsylist, and Skip Beat, about a girl who gets dumped by the guy she sacrificed everything to help him become a star, then vows to become more famous then him in show business. Fantastic reads, both of them :D|`|f5u9KGYcaa	I'd give you called Zippy Ziggy (it's a manhwa though) it really funny to me.<br>  <br>  Manhwa- Korean Manga|`|REfvEVe8aa	i only read Romance mangas so there is vampire knight or bitter Virgin(i would not watch with anyone there so sex in it)or Desire climax same as the other there my favorite hope helps|`|hexzaIGgaa	ああっ女神さまっ<br>  <br>  <br>  Ah!

5FiO6aNCaa	I always love to read the answers to this question when it's asked....<br>  <br>  When I was 17 and learning to play guitar, I bought a guitar world magazine with Stairway in it.  Included in the magazine was a small booklet dedicated to the anniversary of the song and the meaning behind it.<br>  <br>  They had some lyrical expert go line by line and decipher it all to be a bunch of nonsense.<br>  <br>  Turns out that (according to guitar world) that's exactly what it's about (according to Plant). They said the song was written on the fly and really had no deep meaning that everyone thinks it has....<br>  <br>  Disappointing? I dunno...the more I learn about music the more I realize this is often the case. Take songs for what they are sometimes.....good tunes.....|`|0vm66wlcaa	<a href="http://www.sunsetwestproductions.com/forever/stairway.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sunsetwestproductions.com/for...</a><br>  <br>  "This song is a thinly disguised evangelistic song about Jesus Christ"<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I don't know personally but that website says it's about the Bible and stuff.<br>  I personally think it is more interesting backwards haha<br>  <br>  Edit 2:<br>  Way to steal my link dude!|`|WU4MHq3aaa	about a lady who thinks possessions will make her happy... yet... they don't... and she realizes this and tries to change before its too late<br>  <br>  EDIT: Its not a religiously themed song.. but... WTV... open to interpretation|`|06df7be548fafbe99b9d683ebc91c586aa	Led Zeppelin is my favorite band. I think this song is overrated, it's great, but as I said, way overrated. So here's your meaning. I'm not religious, at all, I'm actually an atheist, a quick Yahoo search found this.<br>  <br>  <br>  There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold<br>  And she's buying a stairway to heaven. (she is tithing) <br>  When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed <br>  With a word she can get what she came for. (The bible is the word of God, with the bible, she can get into Heaven.) Revelation 3:8 <br>  Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven. (She is tithing and she she thinks that will get her into Heaven) <br>  <br>  There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure (points out the significance of the next line, hint hint) <br>  'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. (parables, which the bible is full of, and the words in this song have two meanings) <br>  In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings, (reference to John the Baptist and  Jesus) <br>  Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiving. <br>  Ooh, it makes me wonder, (think!) <br>  Ooh, it makes me wonder. <br>  <br>  There's a feeling I get when I look to the west, (the anointing of the holy spirit's comforting, Christianity is the religion of western civilization) (it's usually about now that I feel the spirit! -jk) <br>  And my spirit is crying for leaving. (soul crying out to be saved) <br>  In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees, (Revelation of Jesus Christ) <br>  And the voices of those who standing looking. <br>  Ooh, it makes me wonder, <br>  Ooh, it really makes me wonder. <br>  <br>  And it's whispered (Revealed by Jesus) that soon if we all call the tune <br>  Then the piper (Jesus, the one playing the woodwind instrument, the flute, which has a whispering tone) will lead us to reason. (Jesus' second coming, revelation 7:17) <br>  And a new day will dawn for those who stand long (World after tribulation) Revelation 3:12 <br>  And the forests will echo with laughter. <br>  <br>  Well I've got some good news!  (Gospel is the Greek word for good news) <br>  If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now, <br>  It's just a spring clean for the May queen. (God puling the weeds, the tare, reaping...) <br>  Yes, there are two paths you can go by (the Stairway to Heaven or the Highway to Hell), but in the long run, <br>  There's still time to change the road you're on. <br>  Well I hope so! (There is always hope.  It is never to late to be saved) <br>  And it makes me wonder. <br>  <br>  Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know, <br>  The piper's calling you to join him, (Jesus said I will knock on the door...) Rev 3:20 <br>  Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, (the word of Jesus) and did you know <br>  Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. (if you want to get to heaven you have to follow the piper, Jesus.  Christians are saved by grace, not by their works.) <br>  <br>  And as we wind on down the road (Later in life, after a few wrong turns.  There is a straight and narrow path to heaven, there is a long and winding road to hell.  ) <br>  Our shadows taller than our soul. (late in the day (near the end of our life) we cast longer shadows, our soul is nothing with out Jesus) <br>  There walks a lady we all know <br>  Who shines white light and wants to show <br>  How everything still turns to gold.  (Later in life after more and more sin we can still be saved.  The new world after the tribulation will be made of gold.) <br>  And if you listen very hard <br>  The tune will come to you at last. (if you accept Christ the holy spirit will come into your heart and you will be saved.) <br>  When all are one and one is all (in Heaven we are one with God) <br>  To be a rock and not to roll. (Jesus is the Rock, be strong with his foundation) <br>  <br>  And she's buying a stairway to heaven................ <br>    <br>  <br>  Conclusion:  This song is a thinly disguised evangelistic song about Jesus Christ.  Old <br>  school musicians had a clever way about writing songs about subjects without being blatantly obvious like the musicians of today.  Mostly they used this technique to sing about sex and drugs without the general population knowing what they were actually singing about.  This song is unique in that they are singing about finding God without singing Jesus Jesus Jesus and forcing religion down people's throats and turning them off.  Heeding their own words is another story.  (Do as I say, not as I do.)  The members of Led Zeppelin may or my not be Christians but they do seem to have studied the bible quite a bit and seem to know it a lot better than the average American.  They hit on all of the major points of Christianity: self righteousness or good behavior doesn't get you into Heaven, only following Jesus will get you into Heaven, Jesus is coming back to judge the world and the faithful will be rewarded in the new world. <br>    The narrative of the song is about being a sinner and hearing the word of Jesus, continuing to sin and then later finally accepting Christ and being saved!  You get to heaven by the grace of God, not|`|l7fiAHRLaa	They wrote the whole song on the drug "LSD" I think or something.<br>  <br>  There's all of this pseudo analysis going around but I think it's just about what it says.

Patricia, heart-broken, goes out to find her, but doesn't bring any money. She, has no choice, turns to prostitution to, and makes a lot of money.

ojEkgJoqaa	first sexist and racist<br>  <br>  and not all girls are unbearable to be around<br>  <br>  but it looks like you are boring and shallow No pic blah<br>  <br>  and what about Grey Shadows??|`|GqEAun7Baa	Wow, you need to hang around some different white girls. I'm not gossipy and fake and shallow so hey keep fishing.|`|tT6GMdHiaa	because they are really annoying lol some are but doesn't matter the race really|`|5nfqY9T7aa	You haven't been around many white girls, have you?<br>  <br>  I think you're just meeting the wrong white girls. lol|`|MZWdvdEwaa	Speak for the rest of them, Jerk.<br>  You're shallow.|`|ozmqdlEbaa	it honestly does depend on the girl.|`|I2HgAwvsaa	well, i think i would have to agree.<br>  even though i'm a white girl, but it just seems to be sort of true.<br>  but then again it could just be the girls i'm around.|`|nJOYHuyZaa	They are just gossiping about your tiny penis is all.<br>  Sorry, some things we just can't keep to ourselves, we have to tell others.|`|AA10910187	umm I don't think you should categorize all because yes I agree but I don't think I am shallow and or that fake|`|BLvLwN4Daa	I agree......black people are starting to take over.

If they grew up being "cliquey" and stuck-up, then that's how they'll be later in life. There are plenty of white girls that are legit, but it's the "valley girl" types that piss me off. I don't mean to sound shallow, but I see them as objects rather than human beings. They give off that vibe! However, there's ditzy airheads in every race and ethnicity. It's just the luck of the draw, and in the USA, the luck isn't quite there.|`|KcooLtkCaa	Umm...<br>  well I'm a white girl.  Maybe I'm just being modest, but I don't consider myself unbearable.  I hate gossip, actually.  And trust me I am farrr from shallow.<br>  I'm only unbearable if you don't want to hear the truth, b/c I'll give it to you.<br>  For example, if you're afraid your pants make your butt look big but don't want to hear that they do, don't ask me, b/c I will tell you to change.<br>  <br>  I'm blunt.|`|NAy7lfxkaa	yeah, well a LOT of girls of different ethnicities are like that.<br>  I myself, find gossip to be stupid and most of the time false. ....<br>  just like the girls who DO gossip :o<br>  <br>  oh BURN!<br>  <br>  ha no. I'm kidding.  :}|`|X7r4ImWLaa	Way to be stereotypical, you're no better.<br>  And I believe all races have the same flaws, it just depends on who you talk to and meet in your life.|`|dHYVE076aa	Are you saying Africans Americans and Hispanics aren't gossipy?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hahahahaha|`|FHF43hZcaa	=O<br>  <br>  Look. Don't judge an enitre race by just one person, or by seeing them on TV.|`|fcHN7Mrcaa	Maybe more white girls are fake, but all b*tches gossip.|`|zDJ26bktaa	I think your gossipy, fake and shallow.|`|QPyEvIneaa	i think that this just an excuse and cover up for the deep love you have for white men.|`|xkVv5faCaa	pfft. <br>  some are, i agree. The majority no.<br>  why would skin colour have to do with a person be annoying anyway?

vlIXsFmhaa	I suppose they can always cut away more wood but you may end up with a hole if you have a third single coil in the middle|`|AA10411829	Check with a place like guitar center or your local music store. There are stacked humbuckers available and depending on your instrument, may fit without any alterations to your wood.|`|CjPtAEzmaa	Something tells me it would be a bit cheaper to buy a new guitar with humbuckers on it as opposed to paying for someone to modify your guitar. But if you want to, go somewhere like guitar center and ask them about it.|`|aIdOMU1caa	You can get humbucker pickups that fit right into the single coil holes.

A girl or a guy. I guess most people believe what they see and don't try to solve issues with their heart.|`|heEN0Zghaa	Haha the first time I saw you I thought you were a girl as well. :p<br>  I don't know why. Maybe because the stuff on your old profile sounds like a girl, like your relationship status.|`|00dde3824bb31a5760d4b4cdc75e4641aa	are you actually a guy? I always thought you were a girl lol!|`|INf502UUaa	LOL|`|URo3Ee4oaa	Not sure.. I mean a dog is a mans best friend, right?<br>  Maybe it's because you have a fluffy dog..Idk.<br>  <br>  Either was it's precious =)|`|rMRErHifaa	its a cute dog!|`|BTkHkkJTaa	hahahahahahaha<br>  <br>  <br>  this made me laugh. i'm not being sarcastic either.|`|2u8teJkJaa	Of course they can..|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	lol. i thought u were. i dont know why though. <br>  <br>  <br>  sorry|`|uuK5lYsjaa	Well now we know ahaha :D|`|2xaVpnNNaa	lol.....well now we know.|`|3WCXGRaGaa	yes they can. and omg i loves ur doggie. i wants him. -steals doggie- heheh... he is soo cute. and yes u can be a guy. ^^|`|uXALEpIRaa	Aww, yeah, it's sad that people always just assume things. <br>  <br>  The reason they think you're a girl because of your avatar is because you have a stereotypically feminine-looking dog (white, fluffy, super-cute, etc.).<br>  <br>  They shouldn't be presumptuous like that, but a lot of people are.<br>  <br>  Don't care what they think, they don't know any better. <br>  <br>  :D|`|yRNW0Utbaa	haha I...Don't know, maybe because cute puppies are a little feminine|`|wbcZL1dGaa	Sure, you can put whatever you want as your avatar.<br>  By the way, your dog is adorable! :) What's the breed?|`|QdFdoB7uaa	lol, well because stereotypically Girls like cute things, and because you have a dog has ur avatar, they proabably assume your a girl.<br>  But i woulden't :)|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	Is that a rhetorical question?  <br>  <br>  I was actually thinking you were a really smart, white dog who had learned how to type!  <br>  <br>  Damn, I feel so let down, now!|`|uLHtXibRaa	Yes you can..you put a pic of your pet fish up if you like....but its coz normally guys dont like cute fluffy snuggly wuggly things..except if they are girls lol..(are girls fluffy?..lol)..|`|xQiNe72Waa	I don't know, pictures of puppies are normally pretty feminine.|`|VZAN5FUaaa	male or female??... because you complained, you a beeiotch|`|tKFO3u60aa	i would have guessed u were a guy....maybe that's because i saw this question first<br>  very cute dog:)|`|CqcEhI2Kaa	haha actually when I see animals up I always think its a guy on the other end. idk why|`|EgUxu5kjaa	LOL yeahh, of course he can!<br>  leave it, it's cute!<br>  is that really ure puppy????|`|BpTlXUj9aa	hahaha i think the dog|`|GO0FqfOIaa	no. :) i think it's cute.<br>  but your going to be called a girl because of it. :)|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	I do not think you are a girl.|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	thats a cute puppy.|`|xBOQMqU0aa	u can... well i like ur avatar.. nice dog|`|HmakIJm3aa	Because it's extremely cute and gender stereotypes run rampant. If it's any consolation, people usually assume I'm male if I don't use an avatar indicating otherwise. I don't know whether to hope this suggests I give at least semi-intelligent responses, as that is most likely the case.|`|94043tRNaa	I think it all depends what the dog looks like. They call my dog a girl all the time. I think he might be traumatized, my poor pomeranian. If you would put a german sheppard it would be different.|`|wDJJGWejaa	They can. <br>  There is nothing wrong with that.<br>  <br>  But it's usually the girl that does that stuff.<br>  Don't worry about it though.<br>  <br>  The dog is cute by the way :]|`|AhBJT5xFaa	Ehhh most people I know who put thier pic as a fluffy white dog are girls. No offense. I think it' kind of stupid of people to make that kind of generaization though... I mean I just think maybe that's the reason why.|`|BBgo08uRaa	Its not the dog, its the girly way you have written your name. If you changed it to "Tod" people would know you were a guy.|`|cjLxrrTBaa	Is your man card stamped "Revoked" yet?<br>  <br>  (((STAMP)))<br>  <br>  Well it is now...|`|NAy7lfxkaa	because your widdle puppy is adorable  :]<br>  I guess one would think guys'd use a more masculine avatar.<br>  <br>  it's just so cute :}|`|NlXWdRcQaa	Cos usually girls go gaga over dogs :P<br>  But I think it's fine if guys have them up as their avatar.|`|qWNSRq4xaa	Sure, but YOUR dog isn't manly. It's a fluffy lil' puppy. A pitbull perhaps, snarling at the camera all pissed off wearing a barbed wire collar. Now that says pure man.|`|yq0ym26daa	coz your avatar is sopposed to be u<br>  <br>  i cant talk<br>  <br>  <br>  LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL<br>  <br>  :P|`|mtZxKdxIaa	I also though you are a girl. Anyway I wanna say LOL. And it's because it's a dog that was in your avatar.|`|M2hnhyfUaa	pashhh hahaha that make me laugh lol sure i geuss, but yeah it is kinda awkward?|`|UzUPUPl5aa	of course he can, but most people are closed minded and it's more common to see a girl doing that than a guy|`|PzAHTXQeaa	Gender roles.<br>  <br>  <br>  You probably think gender roles suck right now...|`|AoHSO0qsaa	If you put a picture of a BlTCH up, then people will think you're a BlTCH, too.|`|fpS90nx4aa	hahahaha i guess not|`|BsfCZlMraa	awww, your dog is soo cute! <br>  too bad people think ur a girl.. maybe give yourself a really guyish sounding name so the picture doesn't make people think girl so much|`|fcHN7Mrcaa	Your avatars cute.|`|IhtbWbJpaa	A sensitive guy can :D|`|JYyZDRKraa	hahahahaha!<br>  <br>  ya whats wrong wit people...Maybe they think they are no sensitive guys left in this world...|`|e6rPJyOeaa	is that a dog?<br>  i thought it was a white gerbil!|`|3e0fb112d935519e50f071750d581bcdaa	Haha you crack me up. <br>  Very cute doggy though!|`|JjTfFD07aa	Hahaha hellz ya, why not??|`|2980af5b4722d033c6edc3ef6f679894aa	uhm... its not a very manly dog|`|hQNmgdQ7aa	LMAO!<br>  <br>  True true true. xPP|`|0j2E9WPEaa	because you are one.<br>  :D|`|3eP6pzM7aa	no he cant|`|WpGROxH8aa	I don't think I would have been able to tell if you were a guy or girl.

26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	That looks almost natural and is really not that much makeup. Women wear 10x that much everyday and people talk about how pretty they are even if they look like a clown. What Taylor Swift is wearing there is nothing.|`|H9AlDTZOaa	Nooooootttttt..... why hide your true face?|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	I'm not a guy, but I' think that much make up is fine. It's just accent on her eyes and then her blush is subtle and her lips are nude so it's perfectly fine. <br>  Make up only looks heavy when you load up colors on every point on your face: eyes, eyebrows, face, nose, lips, cheeks. <br>  You have to accentuate one feature and go subtle on other parts to look stunning.|`|GA5BAhaRaa	Some people need it, some people don't.<br>  I think people generally look better without it.|`|xKLydoTpaa	if done with good taste it can be attractive.   if to much make up, not attractive.  many would be better off without it|`|m1JyB08Raa	nice so long it doesn't look like a clown.|`|1RzQ3lK8aa	If the girl has natural beauty , then no.

I mean, they might as well pour porridge all over their face.|`|IkWRXHGXaa	NOT.

Not even just occasional mistakes, people aren't even close.  Even if you read news articles from legitimate sources, there are a lot of errors that would have never existed 15 years ago.

Qt0ImbEPaa	This is what Hayley Williams, Paramore said what the song means :<br>  <br>  <br>  "Twilight is the first series of books I've ever read. I didn't get into the Harry Potter series even though I love the movies. Twilight really caught my attention and held it. I'm really excited to see the book adapted to film and excited that our band gets to be a part of the phenomenon. I chose the title "Decode" because the song is about the building tension, awkwardness, anger and confusion between Bella and Edward. Bella's is the only mind Edward can't read and I feel like that's a big part of the first book and one of the obstacles for them to overcome. It's one added tension that makes the story even better." -- Hayley Williams, Paramore|`|YMFunEr3aa	Um hello? have you read the twilight books? it's about Bella being confused about who edward is but not caring because she is in love with him. It's about her courage and trust in him no matter what he was. <br>  And I adore Edward Cullen|`|QLlu6GMwaa	It's about bella 'decoding' Edward<br>  (slowly discovering what he is,a vamp) <br>  I love twilight!!!<br>  Decode is one of my fave songs!!|`|anORn7Sjaa	ewwwwwwwww i hate edward cullen the whole movie he looks like hes comsitpated and that hes gonna poop out his guts! who agrees with me!<br>  <br>  <br>  im always right like always!<br>  <br>  hehe|`|9YWvGTjuaa	i luv him i luv him i luv him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the song is about bella "decoding" what edward is hint by hint!|`|7E2D2Fg2aa	SHUT UP ABOUT TWILIGHT, REALLY!|`|v5XYluuFaa	Don't know, haven't heard it. I hate Edward Cullen.<br>  <br>  I did like the Twilight books, but they were nothing to obsess over.|`|q34vCB3Qaa	i hate both. the band and the gay vampire|`|uOTD3qwZaa	The song is basically about Bella and Edward's relationship and things they go through and what they think in some cases. Here is what Paramore had to say.."Twilight is the first series of books I've ever read. I didn't get into the Harry Potter series even though I love the movies. Twilight really caught my attention and held it. I'm really excited to see the book adapted to film and excited that our band gets to be a part of the phenomenon. I chose the title "Decode" because the song is about the building tension, awkwardness, anger and confusion between Bella and Edward. Bella's is the only mind Edward can't read and I feel like that's a big part of the first book and one of the obstacles for them to overcome. It's one added tension that makes the story even better."<br>  <br>  <br>  Ugh! I love Edward Cullen! Not like literally, but his character is absoultely amazing. I love his thoughts that which Bella reveals threw him, the thought of reading his name and wanting to know more about him. When your reading him from Bella's point of view it's so interesting like you can't help to want to know more deep inside his thoughts of how he feels, why he feels that its so terrible to be a vampire, and why he won't let Bella in at points. And how each characteristic is so sweet and romantic and what not. I've read each book and I've read Twilight 2 times and in the middle of new moon again! I can't wait until it comes out! <br>  <br>  (:|`|dM1jwSGyaa	"How can I decide what's right when you're clouding up my mind?"<br>  <br>  This refers to how Bella doesn't know if she should take a chance by dating Edward, but he's "clouding up her mind" because she's already in love with him.<br>  <br>  <br>  "But you think that I can't see what kind of man that you are, if you're a man at all. Well, I will figure this one out on my own."<br>  <br>  This is an obvious reference to how Edward's a vampire.<br>  <br>  <br>  "My thoughts you can't decode"<br>  <br>  A reference to how Edward cannot read Bella's thoughts.<br>  <br>  <br>  "There is something I see in you. It might kill me."<br>  <br>  Of course, with Edward being a vampire, there are some risks if Bella decides to date him. Namely, he might bite her.|`|WqJk2yJiaa	Decode was specifically made for the twilight soundtrack, " how did we get here" (part of the lyrics) is basically what every one is thinking during the book/movie. i don't love Edwards Cullen, no offense. but he is cool. i like Jacob better, but i want to be team Switzerland(in the middle).|`|624623cd2a8b6362d907567791d6afb3aa	JACOBJACOBJACOBJACOBJACOBJACOBJACOB<br>  JACOBJACOBJACOBJACOBJACOBJACOBJACOB<br>  JACOBJACOBJACOBJACOBJACOBJACOBJACOB<br>

FZKFLTyLaa	No.<br>  Instead, we should disqualify anyone with a law degree.

sNE6qwAOaa	dude.  That song spoke to me.  I've been trying to write songs for a while and gave up but this is a quality song bro.  I could hear it with a slow tempo or fast, light or heavy.

Put a melody to it and you got a hit brother.|`|mPAnzTF8aa	it sounds pretty good, i would probably like it if I heard a recording of it but ya pretty good.

Did you not bother looking? Did you not think about using the search bar?<br>  <br>  To add insult to injury, it is not classical music - it is bad instrumental pop and we in this forum are sick tired of the endless questions (all of them the same!) about this piece of pop pap.

XbzhrtZqaa	I have heard enough stories to know that teachers do have crushes on their students.  Many do act on them.<br>  <br>  I almost dated a professor I had.  But I got kind of offended when it became clear to me that he had given me an A without even reading my paper!<br>  <br>  I could have cared less if it was a lousy paper.  But it was really good and it made me feel like he didn't care to know me or my work...Otherwise I thought he was hot and funny and cool.<br>  <br>  I just wished he would have read my paper...|`|FHF43hZcaa	Here's a story:<br>  <br>  It was snowing really hard one day, and everybody was asking my science teacher if we'd get out early. He said "no, you'd just have to stay here over night" and we all cringed and walked away then he said "if you don't have a sleeping bag you can share with me"|`|JjTfFD07aa	Wtf??|`|d4c9a4d52a9e77de4545721ac937c02faa	You're probably going to get more answers from teachers if you ask it in the "teaching" category.|`|kfNBVZH6aa	Whats wrong with you?!

sNE6qwAOaa	What's the name of the warrior? If his last name is badass, then just have that as the title of the movie.<br>  <br>  Otherwise you should do something like  "Furhead"  or "The Relentless Warrior"  or "Rolling One Deep"<br>  <br>  Hope these work brother.|`|ra6t3UsLaa	The Man Who Skinned Cats|`|6098ebd9c2c175997bc815b09ad17e01aa	Cattahat|`|vCSjs4y0aa	A Warriors Skin?<br>  I know pathetic right!<br>  Who knows where did you get the idea?

cLW7vFUGaa	Ah, I went to Anime Expo 2008 as my first con (and sure hope I can make it again this year), and it was A-frickin'-MAZING. You definitely won't regret going, except for the fact that your expectations for any future, smaller conventions will be blown out of proportion by this one's unbelievably epic awesomeness. xD<br>  <br>  Look under the "Programming" tab on the official site to find the cosplay events. (Remember that since the con is still a while away, all the descriptions and information still might not be complete.) If you just want to show off your costume but aren't really into the pressure of competition, you should aim for the Chibi Masquerade. No places or prizes, just a nice show for beginning cosplayers. You don't have to register beforehand, and you can just enter and sign the release form when the time comes at the con.<br>  <br>  However, if you want to enter the big thing, you'll want to try the real Masquerade. You can enter in categories according to experience level, and prepare a skit, dance, song, or just a walk-on, whatever you want. The page for the event on the site has the release waiver and stuff that you can print out, and you can direct any questions to the email given there: cosplay@anime-expo.org<br>  <br>  Good luck with your cosplay!|`|LSn5iF47aa	<a href="http://www.anime-expo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.anime-expo.org/</a><br>  <br>  There's a link on the site on where you can register (I don't know where to register if your going to be in a contest though.) ^^

V6QCWVMoaa	Meh, I have to go with Watchmen.  As good a film as the Dark Knight was, it was somewhat overrated.  It's biggest flaw was that it needlessly dragged everything out, which resulted in several points where nothing was happening and it became incredibly boring to watch.  Contrary to popular opinion, this IS NOT good film making.  Another problem resulted in the film not having a clear central plot, and as a result, no real ending to speak of (this of course is due to the fact that it's the middle of a trilogy, and will hopefully be made up for by the third movie).  Fortunatley, the action sequences, use of very little CG (they used more actual props and special effects), and of course, Heath Ledger, made up for most of it.  <br>  <br>  Watchmen, however, didn't have these problems.  In some ways, I have to say it stayed on track better than the graphic novel, though as a result, character psychology suffered a bit.  Still, the fight sequences were outstanding, it was very loyal to the book, and the acting was all around pretty good.  <br>  <br>  Tha being said, neither film gets a spot in my top 10 (Watchmen might land in my top 20, though), which is instead populated with films like Aliens and Blade Runner.|`|80II1Wv1aa	I liked Watchman's story better, and it's cinematography, too. Overall, I still prefer the Dark Knight.|`|aXY70pLraa	watchman was better because it was not as happy.  i mean dark knight was definatly not happy but the good guy won and he did not have to break his one rule.  in watchman it is darker and to save the world millions of people had to die.  it was more real. and for some people to real|`|iacvdnYTaa	Watchman was disappointing. Dark Knight was a million times better. Ledger really outdid himself.|`|RCqEezvlaa	yes because the Joker and Harvey Dent's characters were more epic and better actors played them.|`|miCJLOHYaa	I agree!! <br>  And it definitely would have been better if they didn't show so much of Dr Manhattan.

AA10012665	The answer is highly subjective, depending on the opinion of the user -- and the opinion of the user will likely be influenced by how well the service matches her particular needs. For example, does the user want/need to be able to purchase music, or do they simply want to listen to it while sitting at their computer. Since the question implies portability, it appears the user would also wish to listen to music using a portable device.<br>  <br>  It you are interested in listening to music but would rather not purchase the music for keeping, I suggest using a service you haven't mentioned: Pandora. Pandora has a recommendation engine that is currently unmatched by other Internet radio services, and music can be listened to on a variety of devices.<br>  <br>  Should you choose to purchase the music you hear through Pandora, you can purchase through a variety of vendors.

pTERJdzQaa	Its called: "Who the F*** is that" by Hot Dolla.<br>  <br>  No offense: I really hate rap that has the same format as this one, the ones that onlt talk about money, cars, jewlery, and quote on quote "Hoes", those types of rap songs are very ignorant[in my opinion].<br>  <br>  Anyway...This is the actual name to the song you are describing.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to the song: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DgsCHIAGKc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DgsCHIAG...</a>

cLW7vFUGaa	Nope, I'm fairly sure that scene was only in the manga and light novels.<br>  <br>  The most Mikuru has reveleaded in the anime is her initial explanation in chronological episode 3 ("The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya Part 3") and the introduction of her adult self and the star-shaped mole in chronological episode 4 ("The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya Part 4").<br>  <br>  Nice marathon idea! I want to dedicate a whole day to Haruhi sometime. ^^|`|100d4d6d377b86b48c4e5e6fa8632cb5aa	mikuru's older self goes back in time and visits kyon but i don't remember him going with her...i dunno it's been a while since i've seen the show but anyway the epi i'm talking about it is the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya part 4
5U1TTI7Taa	i loved it. i think the people who dislike it are taking it too seriously most of the time, you have to take it for what it is - a reboot of an eighties slasher film. there's sex, drugs, and senseless killing that would never occur in real life. that's the point.<br>  <br>  it is thoroughly entertaining, though. i saw it twice in theatres the first week it was out and i plan to buy it when it becomes available on dvd. it's not terrifying or anything, just a really fun movie. i think they did an excellent job.<br>  <br>  btw, if it means anything, i'm 20 and a big fan of the original series.|`|sNE6qwAOaa	I assume you're talking the 2009 movie.  This was, honestly, a really good movie.  I haven't seen any of the originals, so I had nothing to compare it to.  The setting of the movie is just classic: the old, abandoned camp with the ghost stories.  And Jason is an icon.  I'm getting scared just writing about it but it is a really good movie.  Lots of violence, lots of sex, lots of fun.<br>  <br>  The thing I really really enjoyed about this movie was that it wasn't cheesy, but more importantly, the dialogue.  The teenagers in this movie talked exactly how a teenager like me would talk!  What they were saying wasn't retarded, it was really accurate with today's lingo and phrases and everything.<br>  <br>  I'd give it 4 out of 5.|`|13Jy3Smsaa	It was OKAY it was no texas chainsaw massacare but it pulled off. The very revealing sex scenes in this movie weren't needed but the director went right ahead and put them in. The death scenes weren't that elaborate but oh well and thats saying something considering the fact it is a horror remake.|`|vjB9ARWmaa	IT SUCKS SO EFFING MUCH!!!!!! DONT BOTHER WITH IT!!!!!!!|`|SfuVoSKfaa	If you’re talking about the 2009 movie, it was a decent movie. It did had some point where it would be consider a porno instead of a thriller flick, but other than that I enjoyed it. For others they didn't. For some reason they compared it to the Michael and Leatherface Remakes. If you are really into horror movies and not a big hypocrite, you should check it out.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	Friday the 13th, Bad.

EqeCiJ8Baa	yep, that's Death Sentence (2007) with Kevin Bacon, Garrett Hedlund, and Kelly Preston. Bacon's oldest son is killed by Hedlund's younger brother (Matt O'Leary). It's part of O'Leary's initiation into the gang, and Bacon hunts them down to get revenge for his son's murder.<br>  <br>  Very bloody movie, not for the weak stomach.|`|nXQmZv0baa	i think thats with kevin bacon<br>  death sentence i belive

HAHAHAHA  It took me like 2 minutes to realize it.|`|BXxar1rSaa	Idk is this is considered being "locked up" but, when I was younger, I was in the car by myself when my parents left and I wanted to get out and when I opened the door, the alarm-siren thingy (whatever you call it) went off.

I stopped buying Yngwie albums after Eclipse - that album sounded like he had run out of ideas and was starting to recycle material.<br>  <br>  Not to hijack the question, but assuming Yngwie fans read this - are there any post-Eclipse studio albums worth having?

If you dont want to, They will not criticize you or make fun of you for it.<br>  <br>  As long as you are dressed like someone that looks like an Anime char. then I doubt that they will make a huge deal about it otherwise.<br>  <br>  Just be yourself.|`|AA10074522	well noone will really recognize who you are cosplaying unless the fan fic has a HUGE following...generally you are better off cosplaying as a character from a show or manga that is known... especially if you are looking to compete in the masquerade...<br>  <br>  but if you aren't looking to be recognized as such and such a character and not looking to compete and just more or less want to wear a really cool outfit  that you wouldnt be cought dead in otherwise then go for it.  as long as it is done well and looks good i expect few ppl will say anything negative to you for it.

AA10501021	First of all, let me say that I consider Hip Hop to be culture, and the music of the culture to be Rap. As far as whether or not he is really hip hop, I don't think he's about enlightening people or creating real culture so I would say no. As far as rap goes, sometimes he does actually rap, but a lot of the "crunk" **** he does, like collabs with Lil' John and whatnot, seem pretty far removed from real rap or Hip Hop. They don't even have much rapping on 'em. It's like, people doing litle jumprope chants over club beats, and shouting the same hook or chant over and over. Reminds me of some sort of high school pep rally.|`|nv5Mewe3aa	There is no way Pastor Troy is even close to what I'd call Hip Hop. <br>  <br>  There are those that cross the lines between Hip Hop and Rap and he does not. <br>  <br>  Pastor Troy is RAP.|`|2d551121552d809b5579c385a4e1891daa	Nope.

AA11595360	its not bad<br>  and its not illegal if you are not having sex<br>  <br>  you will appreciate the older guy because he wont be an immature jerk like a 15 year old boy.

We allowed them to be together under our supervision.  Then at 16 they could occasionally go to the show or dinner. (By the way in our state at that time 15 was age of consent so she and he were both legal).  Just before she was 17 they began to date alone.<br>  <br>  I would have let her date someone closer to her age sooner.<br>  <br>  They are married now and have been for 15 years. <br>  <br>  I don't think you should be unsupervised but to see one another would be ok in my view.|`|9qSD385Paa	Like, you should be dating boys your own age. If a 20 year old guy is willing to be a 15 year old, don't see it as a compliment. It means he's a loser and there is obviously a reason why he can't find a girl his own age. Your better off sticking with your own age group.|`|9f3fef8c85fa161e18f4848f36e97fb8aa	If you are not having sex then it is not illegal or bad|`|PY160XO7aa	Yes if caught he will go directly to jail and not collect $200.00<br>  illegal= BAD|`|547Ln6rNaa	A twenty year old man should not be dating a child.

You're 2 strawberry daquiris away from losing your virginity.|`|M4nXH7DTaa	well i think it is wrong but i think as long as ur not haveing sex its less bad..... BUT you know thats all he wants|`|oli6MD6paa	Not having sex? <br>  We'll see how long that lasts, for. <br>  Theres no 20 year old who wants a <br>  15 year old girl for nothing but her intellect. <br>  Its called pedophilism. <br>  <br>  It is wrong, and though I'm sure you think you're prepared for it <br>  (Because all 15 year odl girls think they've got life figured out) <br>  Either he's really immature for his age, <br>  Or he is mature for his age and is manipulating you. <br>  <br>  In both cases, its a bad dangerous situation. <br>  And even though you might not think its dangerous, you may end up regretting a lot of choices. Grow up at a normal pace. Date people your age. Enjoy being a teenager.<br>  <br>  And don't listen to those answers like "I know a 21 year old and a 26 year old who are together!" yeah, keep in mind, the development of the mind between 21-26  way different than the development of 15-20.  <br>  <br>  Maybe in 5 years when you're 20 you'll see why dating a 15 year old would be manipulation and predatory.|`|7ZMXW4jSaa	It's not illegal, but it's bad.  If you're going out with this guy and your parents are not aware, or if he's letting you drink alcohol, or smoke, or do drugs, etc. then you shouldn't hang out with him.  And if nothing bad is happening right now, something bad will probably happen in the near future.  My mom use to hang with 20 year olds when she was in high school.  That's how she was date raped.  Almost all of the adults she hung out with tried to have sex with her later on, and when she refused they got violent.  She was also introduced to drugs with one of them, and she knew that she shouldn’t try it, but with those adults all cheering you on it’s nearly impossible to say no.   And the police busted in on the guys house when she just happened to be there doing drugs for the first time.  The 20+ guys also got her drunk one time and she was driving her parent’s car back home, when she swerved into a lamppost.  Her best friend was killed.  She also lost her parents trust forever.  And the 20+ year olds that she hung around didn't give a **** about her.  They stopped being her friend like they never were friends to start.  So, if you are going to be rebellious and think that nothing can hurt you, and you're going to have a great time with someone much older then you, maybe you will.  Maybe you won't.  Just be careful.  It only takes one moment and anything could happen.  Also, my mom said that she was around those guys because her dad was an *** and she wanted to be around a father figure that was her friend, so she could replace her evil dad with a nice guy.  If that's what you're doing, then I'm sorry to hear that, and if you get hurt by that guy it's going to really screw you.  Don't be like my mom where you become an adult and look back to when you were in high school and go, "Wow, I really f***ed up.  I wish I could go back and change things." Reality check, you can't.  You get one life.  Don't f*** it up.  I’m not saying all the stuff that my mom went through will happen to you.  Maybe none of it will happen.  But you know that only one bad thing can ruin your life, or change the way you view people forever.  There is a huge list of like a million things that my mom could tell me of bad experiences.  Most of the things would make you cringe just thinking about it.  You can have plenty of fun without a 20 year old in your life.  It would be really sad if you went down the same path as my mom, or the path of millions of other women that wish they could start over.  I hope you make the right choices.|`|Im4K2eFIaa	I know it is illegal too, but I don't think it is a big deal. I was 15 dating a 23 year olds! I believe that the law is there for a perfectly good reason, because many teenagers are not mature enough to be with someone that much older, there is quite a gap between interests and mentalities normally between a teen and an adult. But when a 20 year old dates a 25 year old nobody cares because they are both adults and on the same mind set and track. However if a 15 year old is just as mature and not naive as a 20 year old then who cares? "Age ain't nothing but a number".<br>  Looking back, I wish I had dated guys my age though. I never slept with them or even had oral sex with them, so it's not like I regret anything sexually really, but I just wish I had dated someone in school with me more, I don't know why really, just do.<br>  Now I am dating a guy who is 30 and I am 22. We have a baby together and I couldn't imagine dating someone my age because we are not on the same track. I am too mature to be with someone more my age. It's just a fact.<br>  So the question is are you mature enough? Don't just say the automatic answer of yes, actually think about it. It is perfectly fine not to be, it is expected that you would be at the same maturity level as any other 15 year old...it's normal.<br>  Make sure you aren't being naive either and do NOT do anything sexual with him! Not only could he get in trouble, but you may seriously end up regretting it. If you are still with him when you are like 17 or 18 then maybe you can take it to the next step.|`|jcqa41rcaa	It's naive and stupid.|`|EtSPbSzcaa	Pedofile|`|kjcybCOvaa	PS:NASTY HUN UR WAYYY TO YOUNG AND NASTY! NOT CLEVER...w h O........re|`|bS3f0f1paa	In my opinion no. You can't control who you like and don't like. It's not illegal as long as you two are not having sex. If people sit there and tell you that it's wrong then that's their problem not yours. When i was 15 I was with a 19 yr. old guy. As long as you both truly like each other and he's not just some other jerk whose only out to get one thing. Then ignore all the negative comments. No matter who you date, someone somewhere isn't going to approve.|`|79841d26463b41861cda2417a9cf472daa	You won't not be having sex for long.  If he's 20 he's probably already had sex so he's going to want you to have sex with him eventually.  And if he doesn't try to pressure you into it, or if he does and you resist, he'll probably either break up with you or cheat on you.  Seen it many times before.|`|hHAdA9V9aa	Hmm he could have hidden motives. I'd take care.|`|fe3cf86ee176021daf6b79ae5ae6df7daa	I think its bad personally. Less for you than him.<br>  <br>  No way I would have been with a 15 yo when I was 20. No way.|`|wu47J6WPaa	I dated an 18 year old when I was 13, the only thing that was bad is I never liked a guy my age ever again after that! Its not that bad besides the fact youll prolly never be happy with someone your own age ever again but guys mature 3 times slower than girls or something so just think of it as your with a 17 year old haha. its straight though|`|IWzYB44raa	Yes that is wrong.  He is either really immature or a pervert.|`|oC8U5Bl5aa	a little girl should not be with a grown man, that is just wrong!|`|VH00G8Isaa	nahh, if you like him you can't help it|`|Q3yGFnnnaa	Yes and no at the same time.  Honestly, I'm leaning towards yes.  Due to the fact the girl is so young and is "underage", it is a bad thing.  It would not be bad, however if she was a twenty year old dating a twenty-five year old.  I guess that the only reason that I would turn up my nose at the situation is the fact that the girl is so young.  so, just wait five years, I guess?|`|rdMGWgZBaa	? do think it's bad. It's normal for a 15 year-old girl to like a 20 year-old guy, but i don't think it's normal for a 20 year-old guy to like a little girl.|`|do4c3O3paa	yes because at 15, puberty is at its peak for women, so they may believe they wont mess around with this 20 year old because of there morals. But once you guys share an intimate and closer bond with one another than , its going to be hard to fight temptation.|`|vrGyG5Esaa	Yeah. Its weird... and gross. Theres no reason for a 20yo whos, in theory a college student, to look at a 15yo and think anything of it... maybe if its like an older siblings friend and you say "hey" then whatever.... but to be together.... sick. And as you said, illegal.|`|gLJBnqYmaa	I'd say that sounds a little weird. I didn't know that was illegal...<br>  <br>  But as long as it's for real and they're not having sex, or the guy isn't trying to have sex with the girl, then nothing's stopping you :)|`|6FIhIQ3Eaa	y r u with him if ur not havin' sex?<br>  <br>  duz he enjoy pretending u r his littel sister?|`|DSrLXRS0aa	Hell no girl!<br>  Screw tha law seriously<br>  i'm 14 dating an 18 year old<br>  theres nothing wrong with it <br>  despite what people tell you<br>  corny, but true, follow your heart|`|M80AhVVuaa	Ummmm<br>  <br>  I'm not gonna lie, that doesn't sound too good.<br>  I hear about allot of these story going bad|`|uaofSDEJaa	i can judge others like that srry its a person own opinion to date who they want to date|`|qrGLcTh4aa	You answered your own question. He could end up going to jail.|`|FTL1F0fGaa	i would say yes you need to go for a guys a lil closer to your age plus hes not gonna want to put up with the random hs bull crap we do so i would say ya dont do it go for somone els|`|hQA8Ql21aa	Well im 16 and my boyfriend is 20 alot people say crap about it but i don't care anymore we have been together for 2 yrs.<br>  If you have your parents consent then you are fine.|`|4SDqRs6Laa	What else would a 20 year old guy want from a 15 year old. Damn cradle snatcher. A naive 15 year old needs to be with her girl friends before she gets into things she'll seriously regret but seriously doesn't see coming.|`|BqQAcmVbaa	no as long as you're together for the right reasons... my best friend's boyfriend is 6 years older then her....|`|SUQWnvG3aa	been there done that...and it can lead to it...just be sure u have a smart head over ur shoulders....and like, no, i dont think it is....|`|NRfqivKPaa	lol not having sex yet... you will! then it will be a problem!|`|62b28ec311860b5c8dac8f973f751d37aa	nah its not bad<br>  as long as u dont have sex<br>  just wait until ur 18 <br>  then u'll be in the clear|`|sAYu1JNDaa	its not bad. if you end up being together 4 ever/ get married, think of it this way. When you are 45, he'll only be 50. Don't have sex w/ him yet though.|`|QwdORLk6aa	That depends on your definition of BAD.   The fist question that comes to my mind (and actually to my parents mind when I was fifteen and dating a 22 year old guy  what a coincidence), is what are YOU offering as a 15 year old girl to a 20 year old guy?  YOu are on two different life levels, you have school, friends, parental drama.  He SHOULD have work, life, college, etc.  The reality of this situation is that there are things he should be sharing with a woman his own age, and you with people your age.  Love at 15 is  romantic but VERY SELDOMLY forever, though this stage of your life is over very quickly.  I dont think it is BAD per se however dont be in such a hurry for TRUE love, its not all its cracked up to be, and what you could be missing is.|`|Jk4jFHITaa	It's not good. I dated older guys when I was younger, and looking back on it they all took advantage of me. Five years may not seem like a long time, but there is a huge difference between 15 and 20. Think about it- when you are 20 are you going to hang out with 15 year olds?<br>  Good guys don't date underage chicks- really.|`|3lsAXL4vaa	its realy hard to say because it IS illegal<br>  when i was 14 i had a boyfriend who was 20 and now, 10 years later looking back i think what the hell was that guy thinkin getting with a kid!!!|`|xxSGhywoaa	Age wise no, but seeing as she still very young, yes.  Her age doesn't become "just a number" until she's 18.  But seeing as they aren't having sex, I say no.|`|AA10283080	Kinda.<br>  <br>  15 years old is a hell of a lot different than 20 years old.<br>  <br>  If you're meant to be together you can wait until the 15 year old gets more life experience.|`|mggll8dRaa	Yes, Very Bad and not Necessary;<br>  <br>  Let the 20 yr. old deal with Someone his own age,......!!|`|K86A0hyEaa	It's just morally wrong.|`|SkFgDxpEaa	no it isn't. me and my husband have a age diff of five years, i am 21 and he is 26 but its good you aren't having sex because you are underage|`|0p9wHjSWaa	I can't say anything about that.  When I was BARELY 16, I dated a 22 year old.......  The age of consent is 17 here in Texas, so techinically we didnt do anything illegal as we dated a long time before we....um....got "friendly" with each other.

Ironically, Most stans tend to have little knowledge of the rapper they stan and make really stupid statements about that rapper. It's quite funny actually. For some Stan 101, Look out for ATL MANE or "MR P3RFECT", Killeur Killer and JP.<br>  <br>  Typical stan moment:<br>  "I think NaS is great but he's not the best rapper of all time"<br>  <br>  "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!

It's retarded.<br>  <br>  Easiest definition: hip hop is a noun (the music) while rap is a verb (how the music is performed/the way someone delivers lyrics).<br>  <br>  A Stan is this:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5_VESqYkk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5_VESqY...</a>|`|K86A0hyEaa	Same sh*t different name.

Y1aAGPURaa	Now that a coincidence!!   Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  Elmer came home drunk one night, slid into bed beside his sleeping wife, and fell into a deep slumber.  He awoke before the Pearly Gates, where St. Peter said,’You died in your sleep, Elmer..’  <br>  Elmer was stunned. ‘I’m dead? No, I can’t believe it..I’ve got too much to live for. Send me back!’  <br>  St. Peter said, ‘I’m sorry, but there’s only one way you can go back, and that is as a chicken.’  <br>  Elmer was devastated, but begged St. Peter to send him to a farm near his home. The next thing he knew, he was covered with feathers, clucking, and pecking the ground. <br>  A rooster strolled past. ‘So, you’re the new hen,huh? How’s your first day here?’  <br>  ‘Not bad,’ replied Elmer the hen, ‘but I have this strange feeling inside. Like I’m gonna explode!’  <br>  ‘You’re ovulating,’ explained the rooster. ‘Don ‘t tell me you’ve never laid an egg before? ‘  <br>  ‘Never,’ said Elmer.  <br>  ‘Well, just relax and let it happen,’ says the rooster. ‘It’s no big deal.’  <br>  Elmer did, and a few uncomfortable seconds later, out popped an egg!  Elmer was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood.  He soon laid another egg his joy was overwhelming.  <br>  As he was about to lay his third egg, he felt a smack on the back of his head, and heard his wife yell…..  Elmer!   Wake up dammit.

p5ZJfiIaaa	I would steer away from any answers you get on here that are like: "OMG!!!!!! IT WAZ SO GOOOOOD!!! edward is so hott!!!1111" etc etc. Usually those reviews are from girls who are fans of the books and think Robert Pattinson is a big dream boat.<br>  <br>  I did read the books, I did enjoy them, but honestly, I almost walked out of the movie. It was very boring and the acting in general is pretty bland. I think you got some pretty good synopsis responses above me, so I won't go into much detail there. In the previews, they made it seem much more exciting than the actual film itself. Any "action" takes place in the last 20-30 minutes of the movie, and even that is not very exciting. <br>  <br>  I think that the future movies may be a bit better simply because the books have more going on. The first book itself IS technically a bit boring. After I saw the movie I thought about it and realized it did reflect the book pretty well since the book is mostly about how much Bella loves Edward (I almost had to put the book down sometimes simply because I felt a tad nauseated ;) and thus does not have tons going on anyway. <br>  <br>  So maybe put this one on your rental list. And actually, I would just recommend reading the books :)<br>  Movie rating: 1|`|zzsZ3jEhaa	About a 3.<br>  In England it's rated 12, I think.<br>  If you've read the book, you will be incredibly disappointed.<br>  The lead female role of Bella Swan, played by Kristen Stewart, is atrociously bad. She's a very miserable actress.<br>  Basically, Bella moves away to her dad's house, because her mum's married a baseball star, & moves to Forks, in Washington. She complains constantly, about everything, she's a tiny whiner. She falls in love with an irrestible vampire, named Edward Cullen, (Robert Pattinson), and it's basically about an unrealistic strain on their relationship.<br>  The acting and editting is poor, it misses lots out of the book, and the match on action is never correct.<br>  I think I might be critical because I'm an Alevel media student, but I was really disappointed. <br>  Personally, I'd recommend reading the book series.<br>  The movies are attracting fake fans who like it because of 'Rpattz' and couldn't name half the characters :)<br>  <br>  Hope it helps :'D|`|FTL1F0fGaa	um 0 it was terrible very little action um basically the chick has to move from her moms to her dads which is terrible at first cuz she doesnt know ne one at her new school so she finally makes friend and realizes that the certain group of kids are really close but never come to school when the sun is out gets to know one of them hangs out learns hes a vampire learns other vampires are evil um evil guy takes her good guy gets her back they rip bad guy limb from limb end of story done|`|1f47eba822d1938bfb09dfdafbfca889aa	If you are a 12 -17 year old girl you will love it but I saw it with my 14 year old daughter and  I who normally love vampire movies hated it.|`|LIYrWrCAaa	20!<br>  <br>  It's a really good movie, not as good as the book.

uUDNcsyUaa	Okay...got a question in there??  I mean you are definitely entitled to an opinion but there is no denying that Death Magnetic is still better than most 'mainstream' hard rock/metal that is out there.  Yes everyone knows that Metallica isn't what they were in the 80's and they are sell-outs blah blah blah...I say enough with the Metallica bashing, at least they somewhat went back to their roots and didn't continue on with the crap from Reload and St.Anger.  Being an experienced and educated musician/guitar player for 15 years I can tell you that all the songs on Death Magnetic DO NOT sound all the same...I think you might be confused with the new Slipknot CD.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	I agree and diagree. Death Magnetic was decent they are 45 year old men. The new Metallica is just as good as new AC/DC and better then new G&R. They have a bassist now that isn't their producer they will likley make at least 1 more abum and probably realese a greatest hits. I think Metallica will try one more time to return to their roots.|`|OTFzJbaMaa	metallica must go on forever.<br>  no matter if you love them or hate them everyone talks about em. they create alot of buzz in whatever they do and i think even if people like death magnetic their not gonna admit it easily becausee alot of there older fans think they sold out with the black album, so these same people arnt going to say they liked death magnetic even if they did just because their stubborn.<br>  <br>  metallicas sound has evolved and there really is nothing wrong with that. when you think about it they kind of had to make the change because NO ONE can be around for as long as they have been playing the same s*** over and over.|`|vidiDXxBaa	I think Death Magnetic was pretty good . Not as good as their 80s stuff BUT a major improvement from their previous 3 albums. I would've liked it better if the album was shorter and to the point. It should have been about 40 min long just like the old days. The songs don't sound the same. I don't know how you came to that conclusion. So you're saying Metallica should be over but many people including me think they still RULE live. They even make their crappy songs sound good. <br>  <br>  Overall, I disagree with you.|`|f05a742426c93189e57dc361f1c464a7aa	In Soviet Russia, Metallica has had enough with you|`|9hCezzwRaa	That is your opinion and you are entitled to it.|`|XGPML3Lsaa	ugh i ahte those long boring metallica songs..they should just retire already no one wants to hear that crap|`|RYvtTeT1aa	I agree. Metallica had a good run, even the load era brought something new and pleasant. Death Magnetic Is very repetitive and generic. However they wanna please the hardcore fans, and keep in mind the fan base is HUGE. Or possible the wallets are not big enough for them. I used to love metallica but grew out of it after about two years.|`|uBpPvRBUaa	well i love Metallica i love all their old cds but this ones just plan sad  i cant stand it but i think they can do better|`|Ady3YRYzaa	Nothing lese matters is probably one of my favorite songs ever, but I agree, I don't like their recent album so much.|`|K3yjfKhJaa	its your opinion and ur intitled to that but i like them but they might be done soon because there realesing there greatest hits album later this year|`|ijhHql0Qaa	Everyones entitled to an opinion but I think Death Magnetic is pretty kickass|`|JQHOpMT4aa	Metalica is so overrated. People act as if they were the best thing since sliced bread.|`|0hXKHyDzaa	i agree.<br>  their old stuff i will always love <br>  but their new stuff just annoys me.

I'd go with Taken ... Torino is totally rentable<br>  :-)|`|W1lh6A8saa	Personally, I think you should see Gran Torino. Clint was brilliant in that movie and the acting was phenomenal! <br>  Taken was ok, but it was more of a brainless action thriller than anything else. <br>  I think it depends on what you're in the mood for, but Gran Torino truly was the best out of the two.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	Gran Torino is not my favorite Eastwood movie. Taken is dumb fun. You can't take it seriously but it was a blast to watch a good actor (Neeson) play an action part. He kicks butt!!|`|vvAyfBGCaa	Taken is the best. It keeps you on the edge of your seat during the entire film! Liam Neeson rocks too :)

They work so hard for their fans!|`|B3N388wBaa	Kinda like what the first answer said. I usually find out about songs and/or CDs of artists a few months before it comes out, but with them I have no idea. I know that there will be a new CD out somehwere in May or June.<br>  <br>  Besides the time it might come out, the only other thing I know that it's called 'Reset' because Bill said he wanted to have a new beginning. Nothing much was said after that|`|1UOIoOzKaa	A new German song was supposed to be out THIS February, and a new English song in March!

I got free guest passes to their gig in Dublin in November through someone I knew who worked at the venue.<br>  <br>  Forth, with backstage passes you don't get to meet them. You need meet and greet tickets.<br>  <br>  Fifth, you'll get over your wierd obsession with McFly soon enough anyway.

If you want to be a critic, you need to be educated in film or have a broad understanding of movies in general, not just an opinion.  You also need to be able to write and/or speak eloquently.<br>  <br>  Just saying a movie sucks or rocks doesn't maeke you any more valuable than any other person with a worthless opinion (read: everybody).|`|d7qUDYNVaa	you need a journalism degree from a college...

KvyS9QuAaa	FINALLY someone who understands!! No way is it weird, its awesome because mainstream rap nowadays is horrible, they would rather make a dance move than an actual good album. You single? jk jk|`|GaHXxlS7aa	Hell no it's not weird for you to listen to those artists. Lil' Wayne is TRASH. It's good that you listen to old Hip-Hop. The 90's is when Hip-Hop was the best. If you listen to Soulja Boy you should smack yourself. T.I. is cool though. T.I., Papoose, Young Jeezy, Uncle Murda (not to much tho), Jay-Z & Jadakiss are the only artists that I listen to today. Other than that, I listen to 90's Hip-Hop.|`|rlFIK3Voaa	I can stand lil wayne, to me he's lame.... I enjoy the rap from the 90's as well and those artist you mentiond they're classics and I have alot of mobb deep, wu tang and nas, you should try to listen to xraided,c-bo,mitchy slick, 2pac, Big syke, scarface , you will like these artist if you're down with gangster rap|`|m0axj5jZaa	hey its all right i cant stand lil wane either hes all the rage for nothing and he has a high kind of pitched voice but i do agree i haven't heard of  most of the artist on ur list except for Notorious tupac and dr dre, but everyone and anyone NEEDS to have their own personalities so don't sweat it!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|413b445e09f2861d1232d7a194055207aa	I think it's great that you are interested in things that aren't mainstream within your circle of friends. It means that you are thinking for yourself. It isn't weird at all! It just means you identify with something those 90's artists were doing that today's artists aren't.|`|fX6ENI8Zaa	Thats the beauty of music, theres such a variety its up to the individual about their own music taste.<br>  Your not weird, you just have a defined music taste, and I think thats pretty cool you're not following the crowd!|`|EbmieiNHaa	F lil wayne. he got everything handed to him.<br>  <br>  here are some rappers i listen to and i think u might like<br>  <br>  Tech N9ne<br>  Lil Wyte<br>  Kottonmouth Kings (not rap but good)<br>  The Game<br>  Young Jeezy<br>  Rick Ross<br>  <br>  OH!!!! Wiz Khalifa is AMAZING!|`|V7IdZplIaa	T.I. is the man tho, you should listen to him if not the other newer artists. Sounds like u enjoy rap for what it is and you def a cool person. peace.|`|BVEA5DCgaa	na those r all fantastic artists & ur freinds r probably just lil fake b*tches so they dnt undastand. ur right, 90's rap was way betta, but i like weezy lol but really it shouldnt matter if they think it's weird if u like it|`|H2YziHqVaa	If anything, it's the other way around. It's normal to be into classic 90s hip hop.<br>  <br>   But dang, they don't even know who the Wu-Tang or Mobb Deep is? THAT'S WEIRD!|`|sBLxU6J0aa	Its not weird, its different. And check out the song Crack a bottle.|`|fn2ee9NQaa	Aint nuttin weird about that. If you enjoy something bump that sh!t till your speakers blow up, whether it's Lil Wayne or Busdriver.  dont worry about what other people got to say|`|pjhp3N8Vaa	I like some if those old artists, as well as some of the new ones. You are not strange.|`|Z2evOboaaa	90s was the golden age of hip hop|`|E7i4J7e7aa	naw its cool dont worry bout tha stans|`|1zw3Nj3xaa	nah its whats you like|`|EMYImof1aa	lil' wayne is so strange! like what you like, who cares:] i like <br>  tupac (california love), i like N-Dubz who nobody has heard of lol :]<br>  but i don't really like rap too much, i'm more into hip hop, pop, and rock....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBR8TkzXCk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsBR8TkzX...</a>|`|4d3Md9pnaa	Nah, it's not weird.<br>  As far as I know, 90's rap sounds a lot better than today's rap.<br>  (The only rap music I listen to is 90's rap-inspired.)|`|oi4LXCgLaa	Is it wierd? Do you worry people might think you're wierd and not accept you because you rather listen to rap from the 90's?<br>  <br>  Try doing something...don't feel wierd about anything. DO WHAT YOU WANT. Who cares what people think about you.|`|NZ3rA9rlaa	story of my musik life|`|SIaTnM5Qaa	[Clapping]...lol...naw your not weird...you just have good taste...lol....lil wayne is wack....but T.I. is koo.....|`|UnMramoWaa	Music is personal and intimate, your ears are your ears, do what you want with them.  Its kind of weird that people give a fukc what other people think of their music tastes, considering no two people interpret a song in the same way.  Considering you like 90's rap, have a listen to Outkast's Aquemini album, it's pretty good.|`|haxPqmIgaa	Dude, i'm proud of you. (lol) your freinds are just thinkin radio hip-hop is good cuz its on the radio. i like all those people and you should look up Murs, a Tribe Called Quest, Jean Grae, 9th Wonder,Tech N9ne,  and Poe Picasso (all east coast, but they are dope... Jean Grae is a female MC) i started with stuff like what you listen to... then got into pepole like the 1s i just listed and they're pretty good. Try pandora.com and create a Tribe Called Quest station, and listen to what you get - chill, real songs.|`|FAaePWPWaa	No I don't think it's weird you just need some new friends lol. Jk jk. I think it's great that you listen to them. Because those artists are really what true hip hop is. I love how you say Biggie's whole name lol.|`|fusc1cykaa	Yeah thats kool and Lil wayne can't rap his voice sounds all squeaky n $hit like a lil boys. Dr. Dre on the other hand has that nice deep,smooth, manly voice. He can rap|`|Da8WCIrjaa	Man you had to do it. Yeah songs from back then is way better than songs now. && dang i cant believe they never heard of those rappers.|`|SJ8gNEWuaa	if they think it's weird that you like other artists other then wayne.<br>  <br>  they obviously know nothing about rap and hip hop|`|hfxRFSM4aa	lil wayne sucks and your doing yourself a favor by not listening to him|`|xxgx0IVAaa	Its a good thing you dont like Wayne.|`|Qbiy6HAraa	dawg lil wayne is a fag

eCszB0MYaa	I don't care either.  Personally, I think you just have to go with what the celebrity say to issues like this.  This is what Ne-Yo has said to the rumors:<br>  <br>  “I don’t know. To this day I’m still trying to figure it out. You know what I think it is? It’s because when you see me, when you talk to me, my mannerisms are not-I’m not that. So people see me and they don’t see something that they’re accustomed to and people feel the need to have to categorize stuff. They just can’t let it be “I don’t know what that is.” So they got to do something. He’s not rough, rugged, and raw, so he must be gay".<br>  <br>  I have a lot of admiration for him.

bHA2K4HYaa	What it comes down to is this. Porn actors are not having sex with customers. They are having sex with other paid actors to produce entertainment material. Both people doing the sexual act are being paid. With prostitution one party is being paid for the sexual act. The porn customer comes in after the sexual act is over and then pays to watch the act as it took place in front of the camera. Or however we choose to edit said sex scenes lol|`|jLvlcoFBaa	Because one of them isn't paying the other for sex.|`|P5rfNdFEaa	Both male and female porn stars get paid for performing in the film.

In court they argued to legalize it.  I do believe they made a movie about it but can't think of the name.<br>  <br>   I do believe that one person is not paying the other.

o1BDgJQTaa	Either: Choose something you feel really passionate about. The best songs are those that capture strong emotion, whether it be anger, sadness, hope or happiness :) If you feel angry about something political, by all means write about that. Or you could write about this chick/guy you're crazy about. Whatever floats your boat!<br>  <br>  Or: Don't write your lyrics first. Start on a melody or a cool riff that catches your attention, or even a nice chord progression. You could write the music and get a mate to write your lyrics, if you really want.|`|av5XzZ8Haa	I'm a songwriter also, pretty good so far. Working my way up. I try to take songs I have heard and put them together. Like I got some ideas from the song Bruises by Chairlift and Viva La Vida and got a cool song. <br>  <br>  Tips on mixing songs: Do NOT put rock and emotional kind of songs together.<br>  <br>  Personally, I like love, and peace.|`|8Frra2DAaa	I haven't written a song before, but i think it all needs to come from your heart or what has been on your mind|`|Ahm3fSYlaa	I would write about a girl, possibly losing her|`|rchaTSI9aa	Well I've been trying to write a good song for about a year, but none of them have come out exactly right. But I usually just sing about whatever I want. I sing about what I did that day, what I'm doing at that instant. Of course I never write it down, 'cause they all sound stupid and repetitive. So I would guess just stop thinking about it right now. When something has inspired you (like maybe you got a new pet, or your life has just gone screwy on you), just play the music in your head. Or at least the first couple of measures or lines. Then, keep that rhythm in your head, and as soon as you can, write it down. Think carefully of what you're gonna add after that, or else it might ruin the whole song. Then slowly progress in the song. Going note by note, measure by measure. <br>  <br>  Good luck! ;)|`|RtG5Iarbaa	Take inspiration from your own life experences, other people's lives, or other references like movies, the media, etc.<br>  I recommend writing lyrics right before your sleep.. I find that when your lying in bed and just thinking about your day or whatever, you feel the deepest emotions and then you just can just write out whatever you have on your mind. <br>  You don't need to write a whole lyric at once, if you think of a few good lines, jot them down, at any time that you think of them. You could always come up with more to go with it, or find some others you've written before to put together.<br>  Sing the lyrics when you read them out and just sing them as naturally as you feel you should. As in, put emotion in and make the melody as you go.|`|J7oQV0zPaa	You need to fall in love = loads of material.  After that get your heart broken = loads more material.|`|hhRuKIzRaa	i would think that in order to write a song that you need to be in touch with your emotions...it is difficult to write if you aren't able to create a story.  think of how you feel and then listen to some rap....cuz they are the end all for raw emotion.  above all, trust yourself...|`|L8XP51rdaa	Do anything.

1DPeKBaBaa	I actually do not play an instrument, but I am definitely a classic metalhead. Trying to learn to play drums though if that counts. haha|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I love Metal but I do not play an instrument.|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	I do not play an instrument. I understand metal, but I don't play it.|`|12QJ9QMRaa	I do play.<br>  <br>  I even used to play well, before buurnout and a destroyed right hand put a crimp in things.  But I am refusing to let that be an excuse, and I bought a new Bass guitar, and recently started trying to get back into my groove.<br>  <br>  At the very least it is good therapy, both for my bad hand and wrist, and for me, since I find playing (even playing Metal) to be very soothing.  I can always channel my anger into the bass strings.<br>  <br>  I would agree, that playing HELPS one to pappreciate Metal, but that it is nto a requirement.  I think all one needs is an open mind, and good ears, to be able to discern the depth within th emusic.  The same can be said about most forms of complex music. <br>  <br>  <br>  * I also used to play guitar some, and what I would really like is to learn both the Cello and the Fiddle.  But drums are my dream.  I love drumming with a passion, but don't seem to multitask well enough to get any good at them.  But bad drumming INSTANTLY ruins a badnd for me.  It's one reason I generally don't like most Black Metal or Death Core music.  Crappy drumming and no bassline to speak of.<br>  <br>  ***Wart, there are quite a few metal drummers who use single Pedal.  Nicko McBrain form Iron Maiden HATES double kick.   The dude from Down uses a single kick, and the same for the Sword.   AndI play in standard most of the time.  (except when I feel too lazy to tune my Bass first.)|`|h1yGVkkfaa	Well if you consider me learning how to "play" the guitar playing the guitar then yes i play an instrument(sh!t its frustrating though)<br>  <br>  I've met my share of ignorant metalheads that play an instrument but don't understand the true meaning of "music" itself.|`|c90TJKe4aa	the drums :)|`|rXlyHk1Raa	Yeah, I play guitar<br>  Good show of Dime Bros on tonight|`|00b644b30c5fa40d9099dfddcd2118c3aa	I would say that they don't always go hand in hand, but the players tend to stay metalheads longer.

H2YziHqVaa	I believe it comes from his level of "weirdness", with the metaphors and similes he does, along with the usual cars and money talk. Even his voice has a certain distinction to it, all combined these elements do make him entertaining and likeable to the masses.<br>  <br>  But at the end of the day, he doesn't leave you with a real message, and that may be why many so-called "haters" don't like what he does.|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	In the white* white** picket fence suburbs<br>  <br>  <br>  *White People<br>  **White colored Picket fence|`|NzkPEKYgaa	Technically, he's hated by many BECAUSE he's popular.<br>  Mainstream rappers can suck my cock|`|LyauFqaaaa	he can't lose.teenie boppers and media does wonders for him. how can he lose when he has mtv and bet under his wing? tv is dictating what is hot. they are force feeding the children. can you honestly picture him going up against a raekwon or a nas. they are better skilled but don't get play like wayne why? cause of media. teenie boppers don't want lyrics. they want snap crackle and pop. fast food music.if i don;t like it. does it mean i hate it?|`|SJ8gNEWuaa	lil wayne believes in quantity not quality.- quoting someone I can't remember.<br>  <br>  he's music is not the best, but he gets on everyone's songs.|`|ZMPMqYV0aa	His fan base are 11-14 year olds. I think its past their bedtime.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Everyone knows vanilla ice and soulja boy. That doesn't mean they're good or great.|`|GaHXxlS7aa	It has to do with verse vs. chorus. Most people hates his verses but they love his chorus. He usually gets help from another artist for his chorus. A chorus is what attracts people nowadays. If you have a hot chorus then all of a sudden your number one. People don't give a damn about what you say in your verses anymore. That is why Lil' Wayne's verses are trash. He knows that no one really cares. Listen to Lil' Wayne back in the day, then listen to Lil' Wayne today and you would see the difference in his verses.|`|RCqEezvlaa	a person cant truly hate someone they've never met... thats called envy!!!<br>  <br>  hes popular cuz old people and children know who he is... hes got muhh-fukaz in Ethiopia sayin waaaahhhh!!! and bling bling!!! <br>  <br>  i challenge you to find a person who dont know who he is...|`|nf2vpDCUaa	I really don't know why people have such a problem with him.

Y1aAGPURaa	A lady is throwing a party for her granddaughter, and had gone all out... a caterer, band, and a hired clown. Just before the party started, two bums showed up looking for a handout. Feeling sorry for the bums, the woman told them that she would give them a meal if they will help chop some wood for her. <br>  <br>  Gratefully, they headed to the rear of the house. <br>  <br>  The guests arrived, and all was going well with the children having a wonderful time. But the clown hadn't shown up. After a half an hour, the clown finally called to report that he was stuck in traffic, and would probably not make the party at all. <br>  The woman was very disappointed and unsuccessfully tried to entertain the children herself. She happened to look out the window and saw one of the bums doing cartwheels across the lawn. She watched in awe as he swung from tree branches, did midair flips, and leaped high in the air. <br>  <br>  She spoke to the other bum and said, "What your friend is doing is absolutely marvelous. I have never seen such a thing. Do you think your friend would consider repeating this performance for the children at the party? I would pay him $50!" <br>  <br>  The other bum says, "Well, I dunno. Let me ask him - <br>  <br>  HEY WILLIE! FOR $50, WOULD YOU CHOP OFF ANOTHER TOE?"<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>   One day, a lady was preparing for having a ladies' dinner at her house. Her young son was really getting on her nerves so she sent him to his room. He went into his parents' room and got some bb's. He went downstairs and threw them in the salad his mom had made and rushed back to his room. The dinner went off without a hitch, but the son started to to feel guilty. He told him mom what he had done and she began to call the ladies who'd attended. First, she called Ira Mae and asked how she felt everything went. When asked how she was feeling, Ira Mae said, "Oh, I feel fine but the strangest thing happened to me today. I bent over to feed my cat and shot my canary."|`|McbFOIG7aa	What's brown and sticky?

eaCnjb5yaa	teehee is usually more flirty. Haha means they are laughing about something, like: yesterday i fell off a horse. girl: oh haha. but when someone says teehee, it usually means they are being a flirt. like if you said: i accidently dyed all my boxers pink. Girl: teehee. (means she is being a flirt because you guys are talking about your underwear.)|`|6FtqLQm7aa	HaHa is like laughing at someone when they do something embarassing. Tee Hee is a quite little laugh when something is funny but you are not laughing your butt off.

I googled it though and you are right.  I guess cycle 13 will be for girls 5' 7 and under.  I think this may just be one time thing unfortunately.  Who knows though?  Read this:<br>  <a href="http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2009/02/24/top-model-welcomes-short-girls/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2009/02...</a><br>  If you want to be a model and you think you have what it takes, go for it girl!  You don't need a stupid tv show though it doesn't hurt!  I personally think the girls on the show are bit too old.  Most top models started modeling in their mid teens like at your age.

81AjhZaQaa	Keep your promise.  It is not your place to tell anybody.  I am sure it was hard for him to tell anyone.  Don't make it any harder on him.  That would be wholly unkind of you.|`|HCHqzkQraa	Don't tell her outright, just say he has someone <br>  else on his mind... <br>  and introduce her to some new people.... <br>  and maybe him too, cause obviously he likes you as a trusted friend.|`|uff3kOoFaa	keep your promise|`|mSt1LGfjaa	i really hate to see her get her heart broke,but it is his place to tell her but make sure she doesn't find out you knew or she will be hurt that you didn't tell her,you got to make the decision on what is right and wrong,you got to decide who is more important to you..it is  hard decision to make.|`|eRVRWwkBaa	I wouldn't say anything because you 'promised' him. She may not believe you and think your interested in him or be hurt and do something childish and say something hurtful for spite. But she's your friend and you know her;however,sometimes people do things that would surprise you and even themselves.

tJ2lzTSmaa	what it looks like is <br>  you grab the crown of your hair (the top part) and tease it pretty good make sure it high enough ,and also when you tease your hair spray every layer with hair spray so the height stays all day long and pin it down with bobby pins then you grab the sides comb it side ways like the pic shows and it looks like they used hair combs to pin it down but you can use really nice bobby pins that have jewels on them <br>  now it looks like they just did a low messy braid make sure you do it lose and messy and off a little to the side that you chose ,that's what it looks like to me so I hope this helps you

2e41492627923affb8e7fc267ed04777aa	It's hard to say, since U2 hasn't announced their tour venues yet. On March 9th they'll announce when and where they'll be touring. <br>  <br>  This is a quote from their website:<br>  "..dates and venues are yet to be finalised and fans are advised to steer clear of groups claiming to have tickets available now."|`|P0d0cmWQaa	Check out SeatBOT, it's like a ticket search engine.  They show all the tickets that are available from a ton of sites and put them all in front of you so you can pick.  I've bought from them and they ship super fast.  Good Luck!|`|WLVYLJULaa	It completely depends on how close you want to be.  Two tickets general admission tickets right down by the stage should be approximately $55 Euro or less each (I haven't seen price quotes in US dollars). When I saw them on the Vertigo tour, general admission tickets were $49.50 US dollars and those tickets are supposed to be cheaper for this tour.  Strangely enough, the tickets closest to the stage are the cheapest.  This is because they are not reserved and are all general admission. The earlier you get to the venue, the better your spot on the floor will be.  Then, the closest reserved seats are the most expensive and get cheaper the further they are from the stage.  General admission is definitely the way to go, both in price and closeness to the stage.  And all the tickets are very, very reasonably priced when compared to what other major bands charge.<br>  <br>  From U2.com- "U2 has always been at their best when surrounded by the audience, this staging takes a giant leap forward. With 85 percent of the tickets priced at less than 95 Euro, general admission floor tickets priced at 55 euro and at least 10,000 tickets at every venue priced at the 30 Euro price range, we have worked very hard to ensure that U2 fans can purchase a great priced ticket with a guaranteed great view" says U2's manager Paul McGuinness.  <br>  <br>  As for the new album, No Line On The Horizon, I think its absolutely amazing.  I've had it in my car cd player for almost 3 weeks straight.  I would say its one of their best albums all time and best since Joshua Tree.  And that's saying something.  Good luck making it to some shows and I hope you enjoy the album!|`|FodRZ4qdaa	This tour will be less expensive than years past. Since they are playing in stadiums this time around there will be more tix therefore pretty reasonable prices. Each show will have 10,000 GA tix for 30 dollars each. Then theres 55, 95 and the top prices such as 110-250 area.

The only way to tell if you love him is if your heart stops when you see is picture or you cant stand seeing another girl with him. Try to picture another girl with him and see if you get jealous that way you would know that you are very much interested in him and you are in love with him. I hope that this helps!|`|RwwpsDEqaa	Wow, you really need help. First of all, you are not in love with him. You don't know him.<br>  <br>  Second of all, he has not murdered and raped. He just raps about that stuff.

DUH they could do things after there 20s its called learning more, and in your 20s you dont no evrything|`|Unz5OISBaa	Dr. Amen's Magnificent Mind really answers a lot of what you are probably wondering. What we believed about the brain even in the nineties isn't what we believe now. The brain can re grow and it can be strengthened. It's not at its peak because there are so many more important factors in brain health than merely age.<br>  <br>  And it isn't true that it's at its peak at infancy. The reason that you learn so quickly at that age is because the frequency at which your brain resonates is alpha. The brain changes to beta during childhood. Studies have shown that adult brains in alpha frequency learn five times faster than in beta or any other state. Alpha brain waves can be induced with binaural beats and meditation.|`|AA10244921	Lots of scientists and thinkers did their best work later in life.  If I remember correctly, the ancient greeks thought that a person was usually in their 40's at the time of their greatest accomplishment.

Every persons brain is different. Just like people are left and right sided people. There are people who learn faster than others and some are more practical, logical, or imaginative. The brains peak (if there is a peak) is different for everybody. But that's just my opinion|`|7ff93384150a84022f12b48eda390e79aa	The brain is at its peak when you are an infant.

Gyllenhaal's acting was spot-on, having his sister as his sister was a nice little brushstroke to make the movie ore real, and of course the story was more than enough to keep someone interested.<br>  <br>  It was not only his laugh that (presumably) got him the role, but his ability to play a very dark role and still turn around and play his brief revelatory period aptly as well.|`|jLvlcoFBaa	Can you type movie one more time?

You can just play halo 1 in normal mode?<br>  Why would you want to play it in safe mode??<br>  <br>  Any way, while your pc is running,, shut the power off. without exiting the windows.. and they will ask you if you want to load the windows in safe mode or not,, <br>  if it doesnt work.. trying running many softwares then immediately shut the power down,, it should ask you if you want to run windows in safe mode or not,,<br>  <br>  But remember that in safe mode,, you cant use your internet <br>  <br>  So if you were willing to play it online,,<br>  Try running it in normal mode

Y52s7dfNaa	My 11th grade U.S. History teacher (last semester).<br>  She tried to force every single opinion of hers onto you. If you didn't believe it, she hated you.<br>  And if you were a boy, she hated you. I am girl, but it still bugged me.<br>  I failed a test on WWI because she decided to teach us about modern day woman's rights instead of WWI.<br>  On my final exam, there were multiple questions about WWII and The Great Depression and she never taught us about those subjects.<br>  And one thing that made me SOOOOO angry every day, (yes, I said every day), is that she knows that I (and some of my friends in the class) are Catholic, (And she is an Atheist), is that she would insult Catholic people almost the whole class. While looking at me and my friends. I don't mind if you are Atheist, but that is really unnecessary.<br>  And that isn't even all of it.<br>  <br>  I am sorry you had to deal with reading all of that, but I just feel really angry about her.|`|wKSvnna2aa	When I moved to this one country (I moved a lot as a kid), I got a teacher there who was a total b*tch. <br>  <br>  She persecuted and humiliated me in front of the class for not being able to speak English. She would also pull sharply at my ear when she got mad. <br>  <br>  That was in the 2nd grade, but my teacher in the following year was a kind lady. The complete opposite of that horrid cow.|`|mnMJh7Hsaa	my 7th grade science teacher =(<br>  he just assigned us a boat load of homework for no reason and would always hold us after class for no reason...<br>  and when he graded my papers he would mark me down if i didn't use specific terms is specific orders? <br>  he ate in front of us when we were suppose to be at lunch....damn fatty|`|Bcp8DJa5aa	LoL! i hate my reading/english teacher cause we always have to be quiet! we can NEVER talk and when its time to read, everyone is soo quiet and shes like "stop talking! read!" and nobody's even talking! or when someone makes a little sound with a pen or something shes like "stay still!" and i have a 70 in her class thats barely passing...! :]]|`|KBL6sE7Naa	I dont hate my English teacher I just think hes dumb<br>  Hes 80 years old and has been teachin 49 years and wont retire all we ever do in his class is read and take tests and he always says "hurry up before I take off my belt" or "im angry" and hes african american so he always tells us his life stories sumtimes he takes up the whole period|`|xvT1rqasaa	i dont really hate any of ma teachers.|`|RQyRhUqKaa	i hate my science teacher!|`|j0Jkq4z2aa	my current 7th grade history teacher Mr. Allen. He is a creep. and needs to go to a nice place where nice little men in white coats will help him. he swears in class. gives out detentions for no reason. and tells creepy gross stories. and he hates all other teachers.<br>   STORIES<br>  <br>  when we were studying china, he spent an entire class telling us about killing dissecting and eloctrocuting a frog when he was younger. this ties to china because "we use a scalpel to dissect animals, but not to dissect our history." and then at the end of class he "admitted" it was actually a gopher he dissected.<br>  <br>  he almost gave me a detetion because i was taking a sip from my water bottle, and it made a little crackling sound. he stops class and goes "why are you disrupting my teaching? huh? huh? you're disrupting my class. that is not acceptable. come here. give me your water bottle" he then proceeded to open it, dump the rest outside, crumple it up, and throw it in the trash. " and if you ever waste my time like that again you will be spending your lunchtime scraping gum from under the desks."<br>  <br>  talks about gay people and "horse crap"<br>  <br>  the spanish teacher was playing a movie in her classroom next door, and we cold hear it a little. he stops talking, holds up his finger, and storms over to their classroom. we heard him screaming at the spanish teacher to turn it down, and she told him no. he came back to us and said " fine, if she won't turn down her movie, we'll put one on too. so he then picks this ultra boring movie, gives us FILM/LECTURE NOTES!!! and then turns it on full blast. which really sucked for me since i sit right next to the speakers. i was like deaf for the rest of the day<br>  threw a desk into the wall<br>  <br>  my teacher has done much worse but id be up until midnight telling you (it's 9:00 here)<br>  <br>  yup so thats why i hate him.<br>  <br>  sorry if u see this mr allen lol u suck!<br>  <br>  i hate public school. i wish i was still at private : (|`|INf502UUaa	I hated my 7th grade teacher because she dumped SEVEN projects on us during the winter break!

I couldn't stand how he always talked about politics and degrated anything democrat like "green" things (whole foods).  He also graded really hard and only graded based on answers, not on the process.  I couldn't stand the class so I switched out second semester.  Yay|`|bvsXX1Cgaa	i hate my math teacher, mr. wilson, he is evil, and swears at us and calls you dumb**es, haa and i've never said a word in that class because i'm scurred he will hit me haha|`|DGigWUXgaa	I can't believe i still remember this but<br>  my 1st grade teacher! ugh<br>  icky :P

They probably didn't notice, because I was sitting. It happened 2 days before I had my baby. Either they didn't notice, or they just wanted to make me feel better.

The Chinese women do better over here with white men and also black men. <br>  Also in the USA, American women take offense at you liking them because of their skin color. <br>  I have dated Asian women and the worst thing I could say would be to admit that I find Asian women sexy. That would be the end of the date. <br>  You just have to get to know the women and find other character traits that you like about them. <br>  If you are rich and hard working they will like you. Also if you know the martial arts that is a plus. <br>  Overall, I have found that Asian women have inter-racial relationships with white men, black men, and other races. Asian men tend to date and marry Asian women in the USA.|`|yRNW0Utbaa	uhhh yea! i mean Jon and Kate plus 8? hello|`|d9iXONYsaa	The only thing white women care about is how much money you have.

SMkB2LKIaa	I work at the post office and deliver mail. One day I was delivering and passed up a mail box in my truck. Instead of parking, getting out and walking the 2 feet to the box, I stuck my head out the window and reversed to the mail box.

TJBEeXO2aa	Alto range is probably the contralto. D5 is actually pretty low. It's like 6 notes away from a C6, the typical mezzo soprano top range.<br>  <br>  Alto range...is probably somewhere between Tenor and Mezzo Soprano. Alto singers...not too sure. Those who do blues mainly for the females. The rich lush voice is needed in that genre.|`|Zd1akKMRaa	LOL I have to give you props for knowing this, but your information is completely wrong. D5 can either be a falsetto or belt depending on how big your chest range is, if you can't hit in chest you break into falsetto. Also Alto is a line in choral music like Alto, Alto1, Soprano, Soprano 1, Trebl and yeah. so theres not really a alto range, your probably talking about Mezzo, or Contralto. usually there range can come from lower extreme of A2/Bb2, to high extremes D5/Eb5. but if your a mezzo you can probabbly reach higher.

wOc4Dqllaa	No, sorry. Record labels reject 99% of unsolicited demos, and the ones they do select they select because of the originality of the work. No label is going to sign an artist based on a karaoke track. I suggest you start writing original music, and ask a few friends to play on the track. Even then, your chances of being signed based on an unsolicited demo are extremely slim, I suggest you start making friends inside the industry.|`|1lh7oQsPaa	Most of the record companies I know insist on some original material,  unless you're applying for a kiddie production.  Most of them also want some live singing experience.
o1BDgJQTaa	Sing it over and over, but make sure you are singing from your stomach muscles and not straining your throat. If you're making your throat feel sore, you're doing it WRONG and probably don't sound too flash either.<br>  <br>  Quick Tips:<br>  -Open your mouth quite wide when you're singing, or the sound can't get out lol<br>  -Don't really stretch your mouth to the sides when you sing an eee sound. That just sounds gross.<br>  -Keep your shoulders relaxed<br>  -Use your stomach muscles/diaphragm!! Most important tip!!|`|aKiuKWh5aa	On YouTube you can type In a song then the word karaoke and then a karaoke version of the song pops up and that's good practice.<br>  Watch American Idol and write down all of Simon Cowells comments it sounds weird but he knows good singing.

I was advised to keep my voice tuned by practicing different parts of the scale, like Do Re Mi, and to make sounds by moving my mouth in different directions, and to fluctuate your voice in ways you feel you can't really do. Don't be afraid to be loud, because that's the best way to test your voice's limits. Drink lots of water, and try not to be loud when not singing. Almost forgot, try this for practice too: Mi Me Ma Mo, Mi Me Ma Mo, Mi Me Ma Mo Moo. Exaggerate the face, it helps stretch the mouth so you can extend your voice to different parts of the scale. Practice many different songs from different genres to strengthen yourself. If you practice the same song too many times, you'll get stuck in that scale and mode, and it will be difficult to sing something different.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds like a lot of crazy and strange exercises to do, but I can honestly say I have been doing all these things for years, and I still get told my voice sounds like "butter". Haha. The key is to keep the vocal cords hydrated, and to extend your reach of the scale.|`|Tb3hIDy8aa	Hey!  You could just work on singing the song over and over again, or you could do your own variation of it and mix notes in (that are on key of course).  You can also do warm ups, and stuff.  Here is more info because  I noticed that you have some questions about singing. Here is a method that will help increase your range, your ability to sing with style and variation, and help to sing clearly and strongly.  Speech Level Singing.  <br>  <br>  It works very well, and I recomend it highly.  Speech level singing helps cure vocal cord paralysis, and nodgules.  It also helps people without these conditions to prevent them.  SLS helps people learn how to sing, and become the best that they can! A lot of famous and non famous people use this technique because with it your voice will not come out, or be damaged.  It also helps you sing high and low notes with a connected voice, so it sounds pleasant to the ears.  <br>  <br>  Find a Speech Level Singing teacher near you, so that you can start now! For more information, go to sources! If that doesn't work, then I guess it comes natural to a lot of people.  On your vocal cords you have a skin coat layer simular to your skin.  It varies on thickness, and quality.  That is what makes you sound like you, and so on some people it naturally sounds better. It is highly recomended that you get a SLS teacher.  Go to my first source and go to find a teacher near you.  <br>  <br>  If you cant afford a teacher, or just don't want one then, go to youtube and type in speech level singing.  There is a playlist of warmups someone put on there, and just try your best!  Any way,  Have fun singing! :)

You should choose for good.  even though it is not pop or anything, it would be okay because it is for a Christian event, and idk, lol.

kB4EJUKgaa	I don't know if he necessarily cheated on her but he was seen at a college party with a lot of other girls. Here's what Perez Hilton has to say. For a gossip source, he's pretty legit.|`|uDsXjzwjaa	I heard these rumors today. Apparently there was an article and pictures of Jon with some college girls in InTouch and Star magazines. According to Jon's rep he was just taking pictures with two fans and that turned into the rumors. <br>  <br>  Of course no one knows for sure, but I highly doubt it. He's been putting up with her crap for way too long to all of a sudden cheat on her. Also, he wouldn't do that to his kids. I don't believe it's true. I think it was only a matter of time before rumors were spread about them.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	Kate is such a demanding woman that it would push any man to stray... so I'm thinking the rumors are true. <br>  <br>  I know this sounds horrible but.... if I was married to her and had all that stress in my home> I too would look for some solitary time away from all the confusion and cameras .. ( what people will allow to make a few bucks ) sickening ! ( NOT a Kate fan )|`|B8oct3Yfaa	It's probably just rumors, that lady probably keeps John in check.<br>  Wwwwwwhhhippedddd.|`|1378862e7f14f3d6b3ca9f2e14f3ba94aa	omg i love that show.<br>  <br>  and they have a kid w/ my name<br>  ALEXIS<br>  <br>  and i highly doubt he would cheat on the women that fertilized 6 sperm in 1 egg and b4 that, she fertilized 2 of his sperm in one egg b4 there was a show.<br>  <br>  sry, tryin 2 sound smart.<br>  P.S. I RLY HOPE HE DIDNT CHEAT ON HER!!!|`|g5RS83paaa	I don't believe anything from Star Magazine, Kat wouldn't put up with that, if it were true, he would be kicked out of the house|`|lO2Nvj81aa	Back in early February (the 6th) Jon was at a bar in Huntingdon, PA, where his mother is currently living. After a short time a the bar, Jon went to a college party hosted by a Juniata College senior. He spent an hour and a half at the party then went back to the bar. There are pictures of Jon at the party and at the bar with fans.<br>  <br>  On another occasion, rumored to be Valentine's Day, Jon went to another bar and there are pictures of him with fans from this night as well. In total, there are six pictures of Jon with girls circulating the internet. He is completely hammered in at least two of the pictures and looks pink-cheeked in a couple of the others. In the last photo, taken from the Juniata College paper, he is holding a beer pong and posing with the party hostess.<br>  <br>  Rumors abound that Jon was seen making out with girls and dancing with them inappropriately. Do I believe THESE rumors? No. Do I believe Jon was out partying with college girls. Yes. Do I think that is right? No. He is 32, or nearly 32 years old. He is married and he has eight children. He does not belong out by himself partying with college girls. Does that mean he is guilty of cheating? NO. <br>  <br>  When analyzing the information that is available on the situation, you have to use your own judgement. Ya know? There's is usually some truth to any rumor and in this case the truth is that Jon has been hitting the bars as of late.<br>  <br>  An article appeared in the Altoona Mirror yesterday in which a spokesman for Juniata College confirms that Jon was in fact partying with students of the college and was in fact at the bar that is mentioned in the tabloids. That article appears here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.altoonamirror.com/page/conten..." rel="nofollow">http://www.altoonamirror.com/page/conten...</a>

Yeah. <br>  <br>  I'm a scorpio/taurus moon/aries rising. I have always seen and felt ghosts, some pretty scary. My whole family is haunted and so is the land we own. I have phantom knocks, stuff moves by itself, I sense people standing over me. I dream of my dead relatives a lot.

I later went to a psychic and she told me something about someone I haven't seen in a long time that I already sensed and knew because of my dream...and she also told me a lot of things that I already instinctively felt....so the confidence boost in my instincts was nice.<br>  I was/and still am really obsessed with everything mystical and spiritual.....I just hope I get a chance to learn more about it through actual supernatural experiences.<br>  (also I don't now if this is true but one of my friends claims that she constantly sees spirits in her house....but I don't think she is such a reliable source....(because of some stuff I don't want to mention) ~ she's a Cancer)<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  .....personally I don't think that only/or most water signs are intuitive(or that you have to have a water sign in your chart to be intuitive) ~(just my opinion based  from my experience with some) and anyone can have or develop their psychic/intuitive powers....just takes patience and an open mind.|`|9rGUexf3aa	Definatly....CANCER...AQUARIUS RISING<br>  <br>  All water signs at highly intuitive but.....Look up your astro chart on the internet, with your zodiac sign, because you most likely have some water signs in your chart..Google it, its free.

A winner. <br>  <br>  For Taurus: Good partnership. You will enhance one another. You offer the Crab the necessary security and in return you receive the affection and loyalty you desire. <br>  <br>  For Cancer: The Bull is one of your best partners. You are both homebodies who appreciate good food, good quality and thrift. You can keep each other quite happy. Truly an enduring relationship.<br>  <br>  Both love home and are sentimental. Cancer is moody and Taurus is even-going and placid. Cancer is very sensitive and Taurus must be careful not to slight Cancers feelings. Taurus is someone Cancer can depend on and Cancer will give Taurus the loyalty they need. Both have the same money goals. Both are ambitious for money and security. This could be a very good mating.

The thing is, if the world is about to end, then either they're insane (and thus the information gained will be suspect) or they will lie. They obviously have nothing to gain by not telling you (except maybe some kind of mystical ideal), and won't care if they're released or not. I think it's already clear that this is an unlikely situation and just sort of an ethical question.<br>  Since you have time, the right thing is to use the least permanent-damaging methods first, like pepper spray or mild electrocution. Then strike with a club with increasing force, but only enough to cause bruising. I'm not sadistically creative enough to fill in the gaps, but the last resort is to break the toes, one by one, starting with the pinkies and going inward. If that does not crack them, forget it. There's really not much more pain you can inflict than that.|`|Ii0Kd6hdaa	Sodium Pentothal. <br>  <br>  The barbiturates as a class decrease higher cortical brain functioning.

Then, take rotten limburger cheese and smear it all over his face.  Hope that he gives in withing 1 hour.<br>  <br>  If not, progress on to this method, which was truly used during Persian times:  Find a dead animal carcass, cut a hole in it, and fill it with as many worms as can fit.  Then stick the man in it, and seal it shut, with his head out to breath.  Make sure his body is completely immoblizized.  The worms squirming all over him, in addition to the putrid dead animal smell, may soon overpower him.|`|bq3aYPIUaa	keep electric shocking them!!!

I would have to say it depended on the circumstances and the situation as to which of us are the most stubborn. Each sign tends to have their own things they will not budge or compromise on. I know for a fact being an aquarian, while I am willing to compromise my compromise only goes so far and once that is reach I wouldn't budge if someone threatened bodily harm. Im the same way when I make up my mind. I wont budge for anything.|`|3M79t1EQaa	taurus|`|h50SIDZtaa	taurus
wDisAke1aa	I just rented Enemy at the Gates with Jude Law and i am going to watch that tomorrow along with some BSG and Jackie Chan Adventures. It should be a good day. <br>  <br>  WW2 movie party at my house?|`|ubrYk78waa	"Tora! Tora! Tora!" It is a docudrama based on the book "At Dawn We Slept" by Gorden W. Prange. The movie was actually made before the book was completed. It is a very accurate account of what led up to and the bombing of Pearl Harbor.<br>  "Battle of Britain". It is about the RAF and the German bombing if England in 1940. It has some really good restored German and British planes.<br>  "Midway". Fictionalized story of the battle. There are a lot of historic facts in the film though. Like Halsey being in the hospital. The ruse of a water problem at Midway to figure out what the Japanese code word AF meant.<br>  "Twelve O'clock High". Don't know how historically accurate it is but it is a great movie. Well worth a watch.<br>  "The Tuskegee Airmen". An account of African American fighter pilots  during the war. They never lost a bomber they were escorting. <br>  <br>  All I can think of now.

BtIAB7duaa	well maybe the name is spelled know because you dont know if your gunna return or why youre gunna return??????????/|`|WvrxPfDHaa	It's explaining reasoning behind knowing the point of a return key on a keyboard. It's talking about all of the conveniences of having a return key, such as being able to go down a row in text, and say yes to stuff. The possibilities are endless when you have a return key, and knowing it is crucial to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.|`|PB9EklObaa	Point of Know Return begins with a song of the same title, clocking in at 3:12. It was a later addition to the album, along with giving the album its name. After this track is "Paradox", in which the violin takes center stage as a solo instrument in an extension of the prototypical Kansas style. Following is the band's first ever instrumental "The Spider", composed by Steve Walsh and so named for its alleged likeness to the arachnid. This piece segues into a song written about Albert Einstein, "Portrait (He Knew)". "Portrait" is a straightforward collection of rock riffs and somewhat strained phrases, building upon a relentless theme and weaving a unique patchwork of counterpoint. "Closet Chronicles" is a Howard Hughes allegory, which is an unusual subject for a progressive rock epic. Nonetheless, this song includes a unique instrumental break and makes use of the contrasting vocal timbres of Steve Walsh and Robby Steinhardt. Next is a somewhat dated generic rock tune called "Lightning's Hand." In this song, Steinhardt attempts vocal caricatures similar to Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins in their respective tenures in the British progressive rock group Genesis. Following this song is the work in which many listeners judge the band, "Dust in the Wind". The song does not really reflect any other song in the entire Kansas canon in many ways, and is known for its sparse acoustic nature. In this song the band explores the prospect of death and the insignificance of one lifetime in the endless thread of time. "Sparks Of The Tempest" comments upon the cyclical nature of rebellion and the claim of power through a purely Kansas-esque brand of accessible rock. "Nobody's Home" chronicles an alien encounter with the world of a fallen civilization, and reflects the pensive atmosphere of "Dust." This song makes effective use of Robby Steinhardt's skill on the violin, particularly in the climax of the instrumental break. The album closes with "Hopelessly Human", a progressive epic in the vein of those on Leftoverture. The piece features many instrumental solos|`|iCdLXG5uaa	no one else will answer because no one knows it!

I'd say look up acoustic songs by your favorite bands. Those are always really good. Personally a few of my favorites are The Foo Fighters - "Everlong", Blind Melon - "No Rain", Matchbox 20 - "3 am" (It's a piano acoustic), 30 seconds to Mars - "The Kill", Crossfade - "Cold", 3 Doors Down - "So I Need You",  and Fuel - "Innocent" (another piano acoustic). In any case try those out and check out acoustics by your favorite artists/bands. That's your best bet.<br>  <br>  **Note: All of these songs have regular versions so when looking them up make sure you specify in whatever you're using to download them, acoustic or acoustic version.|`|JigcvrsMaa	I'm not posotive on what acoustic music is..but im pretty sure..<br>  my favorite son like this is<br>  trouble:by nevershoutnever|`|LxZXNDYLaa	Corinne Bailey Rae. she has an amazing voice. some of Nickelback's song are acoustic to.|`|NqMx7YOtaa	Try<br>  <br>  <br>  Jack Johnson<br>  And JEREMY ASHIDA<br>  <br>  <br>  they are both really great, especially jeremy ashida.|`|Py9FwmYIaa	Try listening to some Secondhand Serenade.

Only he adds several deep layers of metaphors over the Rakim style.<br>  Hell Razah has a lot to say and a nice way of saying it. <br>  Kweli is quite possibly the better half of Black Star.<br>  And GZA has a style that's nigh untouchable.

About inspiration, try some story: ancient Greek legends will do, or anything similar.|`|KvyS9QuAaa	Honestly if it is like screamo or anything you can basically write anything and noone will really here it.

4w3PNY2Taa	No, no...you misunderstand. DirectTV  simulcasts several XM channels (or at least they used to) and the Virus was one of them (like the Urge Radio or MusicChoice music stations we all pass by on our TV listings). But because they were talk and not music, DirectTV wanted to drop them at one time until fan reaction caused them to reconsider for a while. Eventually, they did drop the channel from their package.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

UT7sUSqlaa	No in order to got into an R rated movie, someone has to be 21 to buy the ticket for you and take you into the theater. Sorry. I have tried this before and i know it's really frustrating. My mom once bought me the ticket and then when i went up to see the movie, they told me that i need to have someone 21 or older to go in with me.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	It shouldn't be a problem. You just have to be with an adult. It doesn't matter if they are a parent or guardian or not. Just as long as they are over 18 and have an ID with them. Some theaters here won't let you in if you are with a group, but if it's just one person it's fine. I don't know if all theaters are like that. Two people only shouldn't be a problem.|`|jLvlcoFBaa	The rule says you must be with a parent or guardian and your sister is neither. Some theaters however don't follow the rules.|`|wpg6zTMQaa	An R-rated motion picture, in the view of the Rating Board, contains some adult material. An R-rated motion picture may include adult themes, adult activity, hard language, intense or persistent violence, sexually-oriented nudity, drug abuse or other elements, so that parents are counseled to take this rating very seriously. Children under 17 are not allowed to attend R-rated motion pictures unaccompanied by a parent or adult guardian. Parents are strongly urged to find out more about R-rated motion pictures in determining their suitability for their children. Generally, it is not appropriate for parents to bring their young children with them to R-rated motion pictures.<br>  <br>   Hope this helps.|`|ViwZCW7paa	nope its a ***** but im pretty sure shed have to be 21. what i usually do is buy the tickets online or some people just have a person buy it, wait a while and go back and buy another one. either way it wont work if the ticket taker person is an *** and wants id then u have to try and sneak in with a group of ppl.|`|5U1TTI7Taa	she has to be over 21 to do so, but most theatres probably won't check ID. if she has a debit card and your theatre has a ticket kiosk instead of just a box office you'll have a much easier time, or if you go on a weekday.|`|LAseDHyRaa	yeah i think she can!!! but im not really sure|`|vxRZGhM0aa	Not unless she is your legal gaurdian.

This fish pervades the entire film, in real and imaginary form. Meanwhile, Axel tags fish in New York as a naturalist's gofer. He's happy there, but a messenger arrives to bring him to Arizona for his uncle's wedding. It's a ruse to get Axel into the family business. In Arizona, Axel meets two odd women: vivacious, needy, and plagued by neuroses and familial discord. He gets romantically involved with one, while the other, rich but depressed, plays accordion tunes to a gaggle of pet turtles.|`|V2BvV8rlaa	<a href="http://answersin.frasesde.com.br" rel="nofollow">http://answersin.frasesde.com.br</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.

If you're not going to perform it I suggest checking your library's collection (some larger libraries have sheet music) or make friends at a local music store and sweet talk someone into copying the for-sale copies.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, musicnotes.com has downloadable copies for under $20 (for 5 songs from Enchanted)|`|UAHjJpC0aa	:Where can I find free piano sheet music for the movie Enchanted?

Tb3hIDy8aa	Good Evening!  I noticed that you have some questions about singing. Here is a method that will help increase your range, your ability to sing with style and variation, and help to sing clearly and strongly.  Speech Level Singing.  It works very well, and I recomend it highly.  Speech level singing helps cure vocal cord paralysis, and nodgules.  It also helps people without these conditions to prevent them.  SLS helps people learn how to sing, and become the best that they can! A lot of famous and non famous people use this technique because with it your voice will not come out, or be damaged.  It also helps you sing high and low notes with a connected voice, so it sounds pleasant to the ears.  Find a Speech Level Singing teacher near you, so that you can start now! For more information, go to sources! If that doesn't work, then I guess it comes natural to a lot of people.  On your vocal cords you have a skin coat layer simular to your skin.  It varies on thickness, and quality.  That is what makes you sound like you, and so on some people it naturally sounds better. It is highly recomended that you get a SLS teacher.  Go to my first source and go to find a teacher near you.  If you cant afford a teacher then, go to youtube and type in speech level singing.  There is a playlist of warmups someone put on there, and just try your best!  Any way, Good Luck! :)|`|o1BDgJQTaa	Don't use your throat, use your support muscles!!!<br>  That is the number one tip for singing. Use your stomach and your diaphragm and concentrate on breathing.

vsy4QMHMaa	Rather than change your teacher, I think you should change your attitude. Your parents are investing time and resources in to having you learn piano with a teacher ... something more than a few folks here wish they could do<br>  <br>  ... I bet you wish you could quit school as well. After all it's not fun, and homework is difficult. <br>  <br>  Practice what you need to practice, do it well and _add_ other music to the mix don't try to do the "fun stuff" instead of  the "required stuff"|`|m3ThrbDMaa	Get a new teacher...<br>  <br>  No piano teacher ought to be telling you anything other than encouraging things...<br>  <br>  Stick to the piano playing, though...you won't regret it...and even start learning to play the guitar, too...|`|caExWxHbaa	if piano appeals to you, then don't quit.  You'll definitely regret it.  I've been playing piano for 5 years and I love it and I'm pretty good.  Tell your parents what's realy going on and ask them if they could let you get a new teacher.

I'm not lying. That is exactly how it was for me. When I started piano I found I loved playing but dreaded going to lessons every week. It really helped when I changed piano teachers. My first piano teacher I had for 2 years and I just wasn't getting better at all, and found it awkward every week when I went over to lessons and she had forgotten about me. My second teacher was fabulous but was often frustrated that I couldn't play fast enough and didn't memorize easily. And now, after 3 and a half years of struggling through piano because of teachers that I just didn't connect with, I have a wonderful teacher that makes piano less stressful/awkward and just more natural and fun.|`|9WKVmOs1aa	i think that u should stick with piano, but find a more supporting teacher.<br>  you cant support urself under his weight as well. just try breaking the news to ur parrents that u want to continue, but only if they find a teacher that wont bring u down so much. if they arent willing to help u then they are half the reason ur a quitter so to speak.<br>  if u want to impress them and show them otherwise, just keep playing..it will pay off!<br>  things will get better|`|BtAQU5u4aa	I think you should find a better teacher. i hated my piano teacher when i was a kid so i quit and I regret it because I should have stuck to it.

He is using psychology in an effort to get you to push harder. He is also very challenging and demanding and THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT. In Japan....kids who are taught martial arts go home with broken arms, legs, etc. They don't give up...they return and become some of the best martial artists in the world. Turn the tables on HIM.

CnEmETVfaa	Yes!  I think you do have to feel some sort of happiness or joy in order to have fun.  Fun is the experience of feeling joy, and if you are not able to feel joy, then how do you experience the fun?  <br>  <br>  I believe that happiness, joy and fun go hand-in-hand.  In other words, without one you cannot experience the other.  How do I know?  Because I too have a difficult time experiencing joy, happiness and fun.  They are emotions or feelings that I constantly have to work at on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  Why?  I know that there are some things that have happened in my past that I cannot seem to let go of.  Therefore, because I cannot seem to forget or forgive those who have hurt me, I continue to be weighed down by their memories.  It is only when I am finally able to forgive and let go of the memories will I be free from the weight of the past.<br>  <br>  NOW....I do believe that you can learn to have fun, regardless of how you feel.  I have learned that if I don't want to do something because it will make me feel uncomfortable, I do it anyway.  I put myself in charge of my feelings (or emotions) and when I do that, I forget why I didn't want to do this particular thing to begin with.  <br>  <br>  It is only when you allow yourself to move forward, despite how you may feel, that you will learn to have fun.  Try to forgive those who have hurt you in your past and allow yourself to experience some pleasure and fun. In other words, if you can let the bad stuff go, the fun will come to you.<br>  <br>  If you are currently in a situation that people in your life are hurting you, you need to seek professional help as soon as possible so you can remove yourself from the situation, or get the help you need.  I have attached the link the the National Alliance on Mental Health should you need immediate help <a href="http://www.nami.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nami.org/</a><br>  <br>  I also pray a lot and I read the Bible.  Having faith in God has helped me tremendously.

The next 10 years, I wanted other men, sometimes very strongly, but I never cheated physically, for fear of getting caught, catching a disease or getting pregnant. So you could say that my faithfulness sprung out of my cowardliness. Still, I felt like I was cheating, because, in my mind, I was.<br>  <br>  Then my husband cheated on me and now his girlfriend is pregnant so we are divorcing and even so that he tells me I'm free, I still won't cheat on him because I'm still legally married to him, until the divorce is officially pronounced.<br>  <br>  I wish my husband had tried to save our marriage, then got a divorce, then start a new relationship. The way he did it, he started another relationship, then wanted a divorce without ever trying to save our marriage.<br>  <br>  Now, our divorce is not about both of us wanting to move on. It's about him cheating on me and me being the woman scorned, the one that Hell has no fury like a woman scorned.|`|ij9N9r5waa	I have never cheated on My gf/spouse,  but I have been the other man on several occasions,  sometimes women need things that the husband is not providing,  Oh sure he has a lot of Money that's why they don't just leave him.  But he takes them for granted, forgets to say "I love you" doesn't have time to listen to what they need to say.  So yes I have been the other man and I'm not ashamed about it, eventually they all went back to their husbands.  Sometimes a woman just needs a lover she can lean on for a little while.|`|RAgWVuu4aa	I've never even been on a date before, much less had a boyfriend...LOL Yes...<br>  <br>  As for whether I'd cheat or not...I doubt it, but who knows?

Then again, if my boyfriend was crappy I would probably dump him...So no, I wouldn't cheat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *EDIT* Why the thumbs-down?

Well i ended up talking to this one girl on myspace one night. Ends up it was the girl my boyfriend was cheating on me with. Thats how i found out he was. And she found out that he was cheating on me with her. It was actually pretty funny. We both wanted to kill him. haha. But i hated the dude. But i have classes with him now. haha.|`|N3ioHJwDaa	Yes, unfortunately.  :(<br>  <br>  It's not one of my prouder moments.  I was with a guy who wasn't my boyfriend and we kissed on the lips.  I don't know what I was thinking.  My boyfriend found out and needless to say was not happy.  The relationship didn't last after that.  We weren't really compatible anyway, but it was still wrong of me to do that.|`|behBa6ssaa	no that's stupid...and completely immoral<br>  how would u feel if a girl cheated on you<br>  cheating is a lowly dirty thing to do that only a pig would do, however by comparing pigs to a cheater i am insulting pigs<br>  <br>  uh guy btw|`|PJH9vHf1aa	"I want you to listen to me because I'm gonna say this again.

Not yet. ; )<br>  You should probably define "cheating". As this can vary from person to person. (Some people only apply that to sexual behavior, but i would include any romantic involvement.)|`|xDTpX0ktaa	I'm a girl and I only cheated once. AND It was the biggest mistake of my life!

BB4Qd9ymaa	I agree with yk, since they have "super powers" (talking turtles that kick butt), and are heroes to the public, yes they count as super heroes.<br>  <br>  But really, you must define superhero first to decide if they are.|`|TApVoMdAaa	I'm a ninja turtle <---|`|3WCXGRaGaa	They have to be!! they fight crime!! that makes them super heros just caz there not hot. doesnt make htem not super heros they make me laugh!|`|AA10074522	I would have to say no... they are mutant's and while a lot of mutants are super heroes thats because those mutants have super powers <br>  <br>  the turtles don't have super powers they are simply trained as ninjas and ninjitsu doesn't qualify as a super power since most people can be trained as ninjas if they are dedicated enough.  <br>  <br>  Mutant....Yes <br>  Hero.......Yes <br>  Super......No|`|75GcSkF6aa	definitely<br>  <br>  they are mutants that fight criminals<br>  <br>  why wouldn't they be|`|LNEvMAk8aa	no|`|iRWp6QNHaa	No, I don't think so.<br>  Being a Superhero implies you have Super powers and you're heroic.<br>  They're trained mutants, that's all. They don't have Super powers.<br>  <br>  Not all who fight the evil are superheroes. Some are just overgrown pizza-eating ***-kicking reptiles.|`|ihtUSk4Yaa	Well they fight crime (check)<br>  They have a base (check)<br>  Have a kick *** theme song (check)<br>  Disguises (check)<br>  The most Bitchin ride out there (check)<br>  Yeah i would say they are a super hero|`|uoNJhBxfaa	Yes, because they are 'super'. They're turtles with human-like characteristics. They are 'heroes' because they try their best to help people. They fit the definition to me.

9o3eWYcEaa	Beethoven is a titan figure, much emphasized in his solitary traits, his deafness, his complex relationship to women and money. For a fact, he was a real, early musical professional, not patronized by anyone. He is a complete musician: symphonies, piano sonatas, piano concertos, a super-human violin concerto, a piano/violin/cello concerto rather bombastic but absolutely masterly, chamber music, an opera like Fidelio paving the way to the coming romanticism, the last visionary string quartets. He went through 3 periods (classical, original, futuristic) excelling in all he did. It's not difficult to find people who say he was The One.

3b50cea442c25def74c78d25b0c52839aa	Yes, they did actually. They usually used them in the movie theater so people could move around or get a refill between the movie. Intermissions are more common is older movies. About 1970's and older. The king and I, My fair lady, South pacific, west side story, state fair, the music man, and the sound of music.|`|ee1b84441775c37227d31b7c50729a69aa	The last movie to use intermissions was Gandhi (1982). The decision to stop using intermissions was twofold. First, to pack more screenings in a day, thereby increasing profit, and secondly, to keep track of the customers so they wouldn't be sneaking into extra movies without paying.|`|HxC7uvAPaa	Many did.<br>  <br>  I think if the film ran over 2 hours then they'd have an intermission.  The movies of 3 hours or more definitely had them.<br>  <br>  The Mary Poppins movie DVD has it, and I remember when my mom took my sister and I to see it when we were kids, and they had (what seemed like) a long intermission.<br>  <br>  I kind of miss these.  It would be nice to have them again so no one disturbs anyone by getting up and going to the rest room and snack bar, and you wouldn't miss anything in the movie :)|`|AA10750759	yea...nd some indian movies still do!|`|56bNLJykaa	Long ones do.. Seven Samurai, Lawrence of Arabia, etc. and Yes, it was more common back then.|`|c56e8a27e1fe5b4843f30c8834cc5d35aa	Really long movies, usually 2-1/2 hours or more, did have intermissions, in their original release, My Fair Lady, 2001, & Lawrence of Arabia, to name a few.  The screen may have went blank, but there was a musical interlude playing.  Most intermissions were about 15 minutes long, giving patrons time to stretch and use the facilities.  They probably kept the intermissions on tape and DVDs to give the viewer the 'complete movie experience.'<br>  Shorter movies don't really need an intermission, and today people just get up whenever they want to, making a formal 'break in the action' unnecessary.

wlaxCA3Iaa	I am entertained by both Harry Potter and Twilight. However I feel Harry Potter has more depth and a much more intricate plot than Twilight. Harry Potter is a timeless classic with dynamic characters that almost everyone can relate to and enjoy. Twilight on the other hand is not, it is a fantasy romance novel geared towards immature teenage girls who probably have not read anything other than the Gossip Girl collection. It definitely will NOT stand the test of time.|`|MHoTbF2laa	I hate it!|`|LhHAkqGiaa	They haven't read any real books.|`|Q5cEmhDEaa	I agree. Twilight is great, but it doesnt even come close when compared to harry potter. I think one of the reasons why girls love twilight has to do with the relationships between bella and edward/jacob. Im past the whole teenage stage, but I still find the majority of teenage guys these days untrustworthy jerks! Its nice (even if its a fantasy) for girls to experience that level of bond with teenage guys who are actually half decent people.|`|uzsfir0Yaa	i think that Twilight is more of a girl book, because of the perfect guy in it. and i think that harry potter is more of a guy thing. i dont know, ive never read harry potter, and got bored watching the first movie, but twilight keeps me entertained all the time. :D|`|uff3kOoFaa	i liked the twilight series. a lot. but im not like obsessed or anything. i also read harry potter. i got a little more into the twilight series. but i think harry and twilight are about even now.|`|ZllkWRIOaa	duno its dumb|`|KvVTmlLWaa	I'm a big fan of both Harry Potter, and Twilight, maybe even Twilight more. I, myself, wouldn't make the comparison. I don't think they are at all alike, but I do like both of them anyway. I think teenage girls like Twilight because it gives them an escape from reality, and they become "obsessed" with Edward, because he isn't real, but people would like him to be, as he seems the perfect boyfriend ever, and there are alot of good features about him. x|`|WmTI8PkXaa	Twilight is based on the idea of "love conquers all" where as harry potter is dealing more with friendship and the good side conquers all....<br>  <br>  Being female, and read both harry potter and twilight, I have a good idea of where you're coming from but to be honest the books aren't even in the same league with each other. Other then the fact that they both deal with fantasy aspects and are both having their books made into films.... their not comparable.|`|klzmFfjZaa	Because it all depends on opinion. Some people may not like Harry Potter, but may love the Twilight Saga. I read a lot and have read Harry Potter and the Twilight Saga. I found Twilight very gripping but, unfortunately, didn't really enjoy Harry Potter. It all depends on what things you like, as an individual.|`|VVZF3QD5aa	S'CUSE ME!<br>  <br>  how can you say that harry potter is better than twilight.<br>  <br>  Harry potter is a crappy little boy who is a wizard. Big woop.<br>  <br>  On the other hand twilight is such an amazing book. So many people fall in love with the book and the story.<br>  <br>  I mean .<br>  Seriously. Who would you rather read about .<br>  Harry Potter.<br>  Or Edward Cullen?<br>  <br>  I know who i'd pick.<br>  But sometimes i guess its just what your into.<br>  <br>  If you saying that stephinie meyer should have put more into it thats rediculous.<br>  <br>  The storys have so much crammed into them<br>  Vampired werwolves.<br>  Babies.<br>  Love<br>  War<br>  .<br>  <br>  How can you say thats not enough.<br>  <br>  Its down to peoples opinion reall i  guess.<br>  <br>  I read twilight over and over again.<br>  I read one harry potter book and got bored.<br>  And the movies.... LAME!|`|juK9Xyxzaa	I read the first 3 books in one week, mostly because of boredom, during June.  Then a few days ago I finally got around to reading the 4th one, and now I'm on page 90.  Honestly, there have been several points in the story where I just burst out laughing because I couldn't believe how badly written it was.  Sorry if that offends anyone.|`|Mj8ojDMMaa	Coz of the great love story which is in HP not so much, only a few details about Harry&Ginny, Ron&Hermione.<br>  And of course Edward, he is not from this world.<br>  In HP there is the normal world (Muggle world) which exist along the magical world.|`|107dc37380e1695e442d9b8f7ce7a63caa	I don't think its the book as much as the idea of the perfect man - hot, rich, lets her do anything she damn well pleases, loves her unconditionally, can read everyone elses minds and can offer her immortality........|`|w63Ry3w4aa	Because they're in love and obsessed  with fictional characters....|`|IBHyiWoAaa	I think the answer is because it's basically a romance story.  It's got the "vampire" twist to it, which helps to get people to buy the book in the first place.  <br>  <br>  But you soon find out there aren't any vampires in the classic sense at all.  These "vampires" walk around in daylight, they don't sleep in coffins, and the aside from one "bad" vampire out of a dozen "good" ones don't eat people.  The also have superpowers, like Rosalies clairvoyance.  These are clearly not souless undead vampires.  You might as well have called Edward Cullen a mutant (like in the X-Men movies), an alien or basically anything but a vampire.  In fact I think the books go a long way NOT to use term vampire (cold ones, etc.) once you've bought the vampire angle from the marketing.<br>  <br>  So, you find out quickly enough you have nothing but a romance story.  It's a take on Romeo & Juliet as lovers from the opposite sides of the tracks, except that the vampire-human predator-prey relationship is a stand in for the Montague family.  Or at least would be if there were actual vampires in the series.<br>  <br>  And I think the movie did a poor job as a romance movie as well.  Maybe the book did better than the movie.  You'll get more romance from a Ben Stiller romantic comedy then you will twilight.<br>  <br>  I think a lot of guys will fall for the "vampires" hook for the first film, see it with dates/ girlfriends/ wives, and then pass on the sequels.  I don't think it has the scope or depth of the Harry Potter series.  Harry Potter is wonderfully imagined and well written.  Twilight has neither of these.  But twilight does have the Harlequin Romance thing going for it.  It's managed to achieve Hannah Montana like popularity, which means every teenage girl in America will be peer pressured into seeing the movie or reading the book, and then expressing how much they loved it.|`|kui8rS4jaa	I don't want to sound like one of "those people" that completely sticks up for something, but yes, teenage girls think Twilight is the best book ever, and why should we complain?! At least they're reading SOMETHING...Hopefully these books will trigger something in the younger generations to want to read MORE books and become more literate! And it's not like ONLY teenage girls like Twilight. Pretty much every girl/woman I have ever talked to that has read it loves Twilight (we're talking ages 16-70). And for girls, what's not to like? Especially in high school when girls are in and out of relationships, drama, hormones, yadda yadda yadda...it's nice for them to sit down and read a book to take their minds off of it, and think that there's someone great out there for them and that they don't have to just settle for what they can get!  <br>  Also, comparing Twilight to Harry Potter is like comparing Indian Food to Desserts.  They're in completely different genres... and there are only going to be so many people that would enjoy BOTH books (I'm one of 'em). How about instead of looking at Twilight like a huge merchandising fad, we look at it as the introduction of books to teens!|`|Izwr5Tfqaa	I have been reading the Twilight series for about a month now.  You might call me obsessed but I really like the books.  I think most girls (like myself) like the books because they describe the perfect guy.  We all know that there is no perfect guy so reading about him is the best we can do.  I know it sounds kinda stupid but it's true.  I have read other books.  I tried reading Harry Potter but I hated it so much that i couldn't get past the first book.|`|jMF1LiGnaa	my entire group at school is obsessed and there is 10 of us. I am the only one to not read them because they have made too much of a deal. But i could probably tell you everything that happens they talk about it so much....i am sooo over hearing about it!!|`|o1BDgJQTaa	I don't understand the Harry Potter comparisons either. They ain't in the same league!|`|6IDBlIaMaa	because its the only book they've ever bothered to read.

6dAsdiA5aa	Hi~! (^___________^)y<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  My fav Knightmare in Code Geass is Shinkiro~!<br>  <br>  Total absolute defense & cool design~! XD<br>  <br>  <br>  My fav charries in Code Geass are:<br>  <br>  #1::: Rolo Lamperouge<br>  <> I love the adorable + cute Rolo to teh extreme~! Idk exactly why I liked him, but when I see his face for the first time, I immediately know that he's gonna be my fav. And he did :]<br>  <br>  <br>  #2::: CC<br>  <> I'm such a big fangirl of her~! XD She's so pretty + sexy & Lelouch are soooooooo meant for her! Sorry Lelouch x Kallen & Lelouch x Shirley fans~! >:]<br>  <br>  #3::: Suzaku Kururugi<br>  <> I love him~! *pouts* He's liek, the most awesome charrie in Code Geass! Suzaku PWNS~!!!!! XDD There are a part of him that I dislike but I still love him :3<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I'll rate the show... 8/10<br>  <br>  The show was amazing but there are still many questions unanswered in the anime so yeah... 8 would be it ^^"""<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  See ya~|`|pzkw5LJ7aa	ok i can't decide between the lancelot or the gurren mk II....i really dont like suzaku though so i would probably have to go with the gurren. not that i like kallen that much more...lol <br>  <br>  1: LELOUCH!!! i love him because he is intelligent. he tends to think things through thoroughly. and i love his geass, if i were to have one i think that i would want his.<br>  <br>  2: Xing Ke. i love his awesome samurai sword skills and the way he pretty much always able to keep his cool.<br>  <br>  3: Kaguya: she is sooo adorable! i just want to hug her!<br>  <br>  4: Tianzi: same as kaguya!<br>  <br>  5: Anya: she is soo serious and basically like a robot. but she is also like a kitten. so curious about things.<br>  <br>  6: Gino: I don;t think that gino could be serious if he tried. he is the exact opposite of anya and he is hilarious to boot!<br>  <br>  there are many others, but the list would go on 4ever<br>  <br>  umm overall i would give code geass a 10. except for the ending. that would be an 8. i was sad when lelouch died and that just killed the whole series for me. but that episode where shirley died i would give a 13. i don't like shirley.....oh and yes i did mean it when i gave it a 10, and yes i have seen many other anime and i do know what i am talking about. :D|`|6a212c9c778993f0ddb7d1f87cefdc91aa	Nightmare- <br>  <br>  I should give this question to my brother.

ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa	I would never be without the late Haydn Masses (actually all written for an occasion - the name day of Princess Maria Hermengild) or his wonderful late Te Deum. Other works that I find sublime are Bruckner's Te Deum and his E major Mass. From English composers mention must be made of of Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, Britten's War Requiem, Elgar's Dream of Gerontius and The Kingdom (listen to the setting of Peter's sermon at Pentecost and not be moved) and Vaughan Williams (an agnostic) Hodie and Benedicte. I suppose my all time favourite has to be the latter's Pilgrim's Progress. But for total sublimity - 'Laudate Domine' from Mozart's Vespers for the BVM.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, the Muslim Holy Day is Friday. - and no way will I 'pooh' you over the German Requiem.|`|rNqF4gIVaa	Two Pieces come to mind... both by Bach<br>  <br>  From St. Matthew Passion - Wir setzen uns mit Tranen nieder. Powerful stuff.<br>  <br>  and...<br>  <br>  From the Mass in B minor - Crucifixus. Heart rending.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Also another couple of pieces that could easily be described as sublime:<br>  <br>  Mozart: Dulcissimum convivium (from Litaniae de venerabili altaris sacramento, K243 and...<br>  Laudate Dominum (from Vesperae solennes de confessore in C major)|`|NJaZBgDwaa	I must agree with Malcom D, Bach's Mass in B minor - Crucifixus.<br>  <br>  Rossini also wrote a crucifixus which is also awesome. I heard it first when listening to Alessandro Moreschi, which was awful, but then I searched other people doing it and decided it was great. <br>  <br>  And I think that Verdi's Requiem is sublime. And Dies Irae is not a lame reason for liking it. You have inspired me to listen to it! So for those who dont have the pleasure of owning Verdi's Requiem, here it is: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVjDP0vlem4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVjDP0vle...</a> (Karajan is a great conductor, and the musicians are wonderful... but somehow I dont think it is appropriate to smile while singing Dies Irae) This is truely awe inspiring! To think that this was composed by the same man who wrote La Donna e Mobile (Rigoletto) is amazing!<br>  <br>  I also love Vivaldi's Gloria, particularly the fourth movement Et in Terra Pax. And the eleventh Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris.<br>  <br>  And Some of Handel's oratorios could be considered the best religious music. I know for a fact that the Messiah is performed every year around Christmas time (At least where I live). I realise this doesnt make it great, but surely you do think the Messiah is at least good? <br>  At the moment I adore Il trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno (In Italian, I actually quite despise it in English!) and his Ode for St. Cecilia's Day is also very good. (no this is not an oratorio, for those of you too ignorant to realise that!)<br>  and Handel's early work (So early that it actually is in German and premiered in Halle) "Victoria. Der Tod ist verschlungen" is stupendous!!!!!!|`|xcPzZvsraa	Beethoven's Missa Solemnis,absolutely.<br>  I wonder if you agree that this seems in particular one of those great masterpieces that is no easy feat to pull  off successfully. <br>  I've heard a few less than inspiring attempts.  <br>  However I've just got hold of a new recording conducted by Jascha Horenstein who died in 1973.<br>  It's an amazing performance on the BBC Legends label.<br>  Incidentally I've mentioned before how highly I hold Wilhelm Furtwangler as one of the greatest conductors who ever lived without question.<br>  Anyway I came across an interesting anecdote which related how supposedly he never recorded the Missa Solemnis because he didn't feel himself qualified for such an undertaking.<br>  Such a profound display of humility from so great a man.<br>  <br>  Other works that just usher me into the presence of the divine<br>  (if such a thing exists of course?).<br>  <br>  The final movement to Gustav Mahler's 2nd Symphony "The Resurrection"and especially those last few bars of the choir are just bliss. <br>  (damn good call by Boy Wonder)<br>  Does this even count as it's not liturgical as such?<br>  <br>  Also especially these three I find deeply devotional:<br>  Gregorio Allegri's -  Missere and <br>  the Requiem in D minor from Gabriel Faure and <br>  Karol Szymanowski's  Stabat Mater <br>  <br>  Anyhow good question as I've recently started expanding my tastes from purely orchestral works so all these answers were most interesting and have gave me a few new pieces to try out.|`|C4OIwfS3aa	You don't have to be religious to like religious music.  I love the Requiems of Mozart and Verdi and the German Requiem of Brahms.  I also like Bernstein's Chichester Psalms and Bloch's Schelomo.|`|jR8kyp0Taa	Does Mahler's 2nd count?<br>  <br>  More on this in the morning after (hopefully) I feel better from this virus going around.<br>  <br>  BW|`|AA10125474	Like Malcome, I think nothing remotely approaches Bach's B minor mass.<br>  <br>  But for a short work, Mozart's "Ave Verum Corpus" fits the definition of sublime.  There is also a wonderful Brahms motet "Schaffe in mir ein reines Herz"  (Create in me a Clean Heart) that has really gorgeous lines, and some very clever counterpoint to boot.<br>  <br>  Also John Rutter wrote a simply gorgeous setting of the benediction "The Lord Bless You and Keep You"  that has a delicious Amen.  Rutter is a very talented composer --  but he is virtually ignored outside of the church setting.<br>  <br>  And -- not to nitpick, but the word "Sabbath" literally means Saturday, and not all Christian denominations use Sunday as the day of Worship.<br>  <br>  Glinzek|`|kbFty6eVaa	You do realize that even atheist composers write requiems and masses with Latin text. I do not believe these works can be described as "religious compositions". The other part of the time, the compositions are not written for explicit religious services. Realizing those points, there are extremely few pieces actually written for "a specific religious occasion or ceremony" from the Baroque period onwards - the Beethoven Missa Solemnis you mentioned sort of contradicts what you're asking for.<br>  <br>  If the topic is music with liturgical text regardless of other factors my favorites would be:<br>  <br>  Brahms - A German Requiem<br>  Bach - Mass in B minor<br>  Dvorak - Stabat Mater<br>  Faure - Requiem<br>  <br>  You might not be familiar with the Dvorak Stabat Mater but if I would recommend one symphonic choral work that might well be it. It is heart-rending. He wrote it after 3 of his children died.|`|uGmEjSLDaa	Agnostic chiming in here:<br>  <br>  I love love love 'And the Glory of the Lord' from the Messiah. It's got great highs and lows, great switches in tone and emphasis, and is the best religious-power-put-to-music piece that I can think of.<br>  <br>  My favorite types of classical music are motets and madrigals, since I love polyphony, and they have great range in their subjects. A lot of religious works along these lines are great: Di Lasso, Marenzio, Weelkes, Byrd, Morley, all wrote great examples of sacred works as well as secular.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	I'm going with the J.S. Bach works .... those mentioned by Malcolm (Matthaus Passion and Mass in B minor) I'll add the Johannes Passion.<br>  <br>  For "simple" hymns I'll throw in the Coral Prelude BWV 645, "Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme" and his harmonization of "O Sacred Head, Now Wounded" (from the Mathheus Passion).<br>  <br>  ... Happy almost birthday Mr. Bach 21 March 1685|`|70jNDiIiaa	Hi Alberich,<br>  <br>  Like you, I'm non-affiliated, in a religious sense - yet most of my favourite musical works are Christian religious music. But the works that move me most profoundly are the following ones (and what a surprise - all happen to be Baroque!!)<br>  <br>  VIVALDI: <br>  -Stabat mater<br>  -Nisi Dominus<br>  -Gloria in D <br>  <br>  HANDEL: <br>  -The Messiah<br>  -Dixit Dominus<br>  <br>  MONTEVERDI: <br>  -Vespro della Beate Virgine (1610)<br>  <br>  JS BACH: <br>  -St. Matthew Passion<br>  -St. John Passion<br>  -Mass in b minor<br>  <br>  G. GABRIELI: <br>  -Symphoniae Sacrae<br>  <br>  PERGOLESI: <br>  -Stabat Mater<br>  <br>  PURCELL: <br>  -Te Deum in D<br>  -Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary<br>  <br>  BIBER: <br>  -"Rosary Sonatas"<br>  <br>  <br>  That'll do - for now, anyway!<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Hafwen.

6qPTQDdZaa	I like it.  It might even work better than simply banning using a cell phone while driving.|`|Uk4OwRtMaa	I'm not so sure that's the right approach. I'm against cell phone/texting while driving, but not quite in the same category as DUI. I'm thinking more along the lines of an upgrade to a ticket/fine/points/jail time that a person would normally get for the particular accident if they were also using the cell phone or texting when the accident happened. Easy enough to prove through cell phone records.<br>  Say a $1000 on top of the normal fine. 5 points on the driving record. 1 year added to a jail term if applicable. Just a thought, I haven't really thought about this in detail.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	Awesome idea. people think that because they can multi task that an accident cannot occur. my friend texts all the time while driving with her kids in the car and i tell her to pay attention to the road one day, i fear the worst for her and all those who text while driving. your life is more important than a msg better yet, someone elses life is more important!|`|et9gdoDKaa	I think it's a good idea.

4kIDqJCwaa	Not only did he have one of the best techniques but he was also one of the best sight readers in the history of piano. It's been said that he and Chopin were friends and music rivals and Chopin would just be awe struck and jealous that Liszt could sight read his etudes for the first time and play them perfect without any mistake. He has composed thousands of pieces, a collection so big that only one pianist as of today has ever been able to recreate. His name is Leslie Howard.<br>  <br>  Liszt was also known for his amazing theory, being able to recreate and transcribe many other pianists' works such as Schubert (another favorite of mine!). Not to mention that many of his pieces are very advanced and require a professional to truly interpret and perform them. This is also because you need so much finger dexterity and strength to play his demanding pieces. (Note that modern pianos are much easier to play)<br>  <br>  I've read that he had great stage presence and women would basically faint as he performed. Sort of like the biggest "rock-star" (for lack of a better word) of his day haha.<br>  <br>  What really makes him my favorite pianist is his ideology about music. He didn't charge for music lessons as he wanted music to be available to everyone who appreciated it and not just only for the wealthy. History will most likely never see another musician of his capabilities.<br>  <br>  His Hungarian rhapsodies were great no doubt, but many people only know him by that unfortunately. He has composed fantastic symphonies that you should check out. His other piano concertos and works are simply astonishing.<br>  <br>  Here's a sample you should enjoy. An epic performance by the great pianist Enrico Pace. Don't forget to check out part 2 of the video!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqCEhmqsSnY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqCEhmqsS...</a><br>  <br>  For me it is VERY hard to name his greatest achievements because I have so many favorites. His Transcendental Etudes are on the top of my list though. If you have time, check out these two youtube channels that have hundreds of videos dedicated to uploading Liszt's music:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/FranzFerencLiszt" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/FranzFerencL...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/liszt73" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/liszt73</a>|`|UC5H2F1Taa	I think his Hungarian Rhapsody #something is really popular.  La Campanella is good as well.  I liike Feu Follet from his transcendental etudes too. I forgot what number it was.

D4OCM8yUaa	I actually watched the movie when I was really little. I didn't watch the whole thing, just little bits and pieces of it. The parts that really creeped me out were these:<br>  <br>  Whenever Jesus is carrying the cross there is this creature that is really scary that pops out. it is really freaky.<br>  <br>  The devil looks kind of scary, cause he is wearing this hood.<br>  <br>  When Jesus gets whipped, A LOT of blood comes out.<br>  <br>  Jesus is like COVERED in blood when He is on the cross. It is amazingly sad. I NEVER cry at movies, but I was crying at this one.<br>  <br>  <br>  You most likely will be crying A LOT at this movie, but it really shows you all the pain the He went through and how much He loves us. It is just so sad! Just also, you actually will feel a little guilty after you watch it. I know I was thinking, "Why, for ANY reason ever imaginable, would Jesus do all of this for me?" And this movie isn't anywhere near as bad as how much Jesus suffered. We can never imagine all of the pain that He suffered for us. <br>  <br>  Also, there is one scene that WILL stick with you no matter what, and that is when He is hanging on the cross next to the robbers mocking Him and He is covered in blood. I watched this movie when I was 6 years old, and I can still tell you every detail that I saw (remember i said earlier that i didn't watch the whole thing cause it creeped me out so bad.) So no matter what you do, you will remember everything.<br>  <br>  God Bless You!|`|kHMQhpJaaa	alright, well i dont know what Confirmation is, but i do know we both believe that Jesus is the son of God, so please email me and tell me what confirmation is please! ( i go to a Southern Babtist church, we have prodestant faith, and basicaly believe that God sent Jesus his only begotten son , and that who so ever believes in hime, shall not perish but have eternal life, John 3;16!!) <br>  <br>  <br>  Anywho, i watched it with my youth group on Easter weekend. i am not an easy cryer, but i did snifle alot in it, <br>  It realy depends on your Faith if you ask me, Durring the whole thing they speek Juish,  So you have to read the words on the screen that show under th picuter, so you cant realy " space off" or anything because you would have no idea what they are saying,<br>  <br>  But even though you might cry, i truly believ you shall walk out understanding the crucifiction better.. i know i did!! I think it will make you have a stronger relationship with Christ,<br>  <br>  because as soon as you are done with the movei, you will want to go shout Jesus's story on the streets!|`|DFaMY7Aaaa	I first saw the movie while living in the deep south. There were so many people in the theater who were flat out hysterical. Lots of people were on their knees , praying and others were hugging complete strangers. <br>  I'm surprised that they chose this movie. <br>  Do they realize that it is rated "R"?|`|70860a41a58f8d75a2a493037473b6fdaa	And what point are they trying to make by showing this? It's bad what they did to him in the movie but I think what they did in reality was far worse. A good movie, but not for everyone.|`|wX4ZGlAnaa	you have to watch it to receive confirmation? thats odd. i never received communion or confirmation. i always wanted to but never did it. but i never heard of a church making you watch a movie especially that movie which IMO was a good movie, but it does have a lot of blood and gore in it and its not for the squeamish|`|vBAFmWqSaa	its not the blood that makes you sick really so it's not disguisting. but do take a FEW BOXes of kleenex with you it is a tear jerker. <br>  what makes you sick is the fact that they did this to him and he humbled himself to do this for us and our sins.......<br>  LOVE THE MOVIE THOUGH.|`|hs9Mibf5aa	I cannot believe any Catholic Church would use scare tactics - this is what they are - to send a message before someone is confirmed.<br>  <br>  I wasn't emotionally ready at 12 (age I was confirmed) to watch "The Passion" - nor would I have been legally able to?!  I'm quite surprised.<br>  <br>  This is a movie you should watch when you're old enough emotionally.  Of course it doesn't lessen your feelings for Christ, but you don't need Mel Gibson's mental imagery to honour Him.<br>  <br>  I don't know what to say, except talk to your parents.  This doesn't seem right..|`|hhRuKIzRaa	if you are a christian then it will be painful to watch...but it will also make you feel like your troubles are insignificant...<br>  <br>  i left the movie crying my eyes out but it made me want to be a better person..now that is a good movie!

Someone is videotaping me in my spaceship."|`|HkyOtIeTaa	i don't pay attention to how i eat it .<br>  all i know is that i lick my ice cream .|`|IhtABUWMaa	That's pretty much how I eat mine, no joke.|`|uff3kOoFaa	i dont pay attention to how i eat ice creamm...|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	Everyone has their own technique. <br>  I myself work the top so it doesn't drip... then once i get down to the cone i let it melt and then suck it out... the melted bit at the bottom is the best part of any ice cream. I sometimes don't even eat the cone... <br>  <br>  It's funny i always find myself telling people 'ah you're doing it wrong ' when they let it melt or whatever, and they just look at me funny...|`|AA11369490	i eat it exactly the same way :D<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (ˉ`v′ˉ)<br>  .`·.?.·′ ?.·′?.·′¨) ?.·*¨)<br>  (?.·′ (?.·′ .·′ ??.·¨ `*~*~*|`|GtEfBBwAaa	Yes!!! I love that. Although when I get to the bottom of the cone, i just plop it in my mouth and sink my teeth into it. The cone along with the cold ice cream just sitting there is marvelous.|`|mbfMYmzWaa	Lol. Same. <br>  <br>  It sounds rele gross, but I try to pack it down as I lick it too, so that it all gets squished into the bottom of the cone.<br>  <br>  It never lasts long enough to get 'all melty' though sadly. <br>  <br>  ;)|`|vryw9udtaa	meh he, i do that too! i eat everthing strangely. that's the RIGHT way to eat it!|`|PtSeJXnEaa	thats how i eat it too! the very end is the best part!!|`|MZMwJwDGaa	no fatty|`|VzeNr568aa	i do so dont feel bad|`|F0sfmZFnaa	Haha...cute question. :D<br>  <br>  I do all of that right up to the "melty" part. Usually, I eat my ice cream so fast that it hardly gets melty lol, but when it does, I don't suck it up - I still lick it out. Haha. Or, I bite off the end of the cone and then suck it out that way if its melted. Then I eat the rest of my cone like you!! :)|`|DrZVUaTcaa	Well I can't tell you for sure if it is strange or not, but that is how I eat it.

Today I spent it with my family & us being the explorers that we are we went hiking into the mountains & ended up discovering a really beautiful garden at the top of one of those mountains. It was a really fun, yet exhausting day. We took my little doggy, and since we've arrived home he hasn't even lifted a paw... he's been sleeping. hehe<br>  <br>  ^_^|`|1b7ed28e6db720f8a3742ba925e36793aa	yup. 5.3 miles|`|WW5Xp6ofaa	I walked like 2 miles with my friend.

ZdIaVkIcaa	My 360 avatar is Mr Magoo and his dog, tryed so use it here but it won't transfer.|`|DooqYRfAaa	I know who Elmer Fudd is because he's a Warner Bros. character, but I don't know who Mister Magoo is.  So I'll say Elmer Fudd.  I'd like him more if he didn't chase and try to hunt down Bugs all the time.  He is the hunter in the 'toons if I remember correctly.<br>  <br>  I know who Thurston Howell the III is, he's the snob and 'faidy cat on the island who sleeps with his teddy.... but he's a likeable guy.|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	Fudd for sure. Are they still showing those, I bet some of the younger ones wonder who you are talking about. Did not know about Thurston though again younger ones don't know probably. The good ole days.|`|d09ca82ef4d1521ac23c334df2e8eedeaa	Fudd :)|`|0KaKKAskaa	Fudd rules - he was often homicidally crazy after Bugs, and never gave up. Magoo was always kind of boring and all the jokes were about his bad eyesight, so dull they added his dog "McBarker" but that was dull because he was just a dog with bad eyesight. Magoo was better as a limited supporting character, not on his own, while Fudd had leading man qualities.|`|DyuXD9Evaa	elmer fudd...definately|`|aY08TZIaaa	elmer fudd = D|`|TAIlyvgyaa	Magoo.

However, it's becoming really hard to tolerate certain acts.  Satan's Host doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of how far certain BM bands will go.  Hell, I think they were even Power Metal in the 80s.|`|cYgxTWDVaa	That was actually funny, to an extent.<br>  <br>  There's been a lot of hilarious black metal music videos recently. <br>  <br>  It's like they purposely exaggerate on the cheesiness and cliche-ness of black metal(exaggerated cheesiness is redundant) to make fun of themselves.

No matter how you feel about religion or anything like that, just the whole video is totally lousy.  It's been done, over and over, and in better ways!  Looks like a group of kids just kinda got together for a school project or something.<br>  <br>  Note to:  This Sentence Has 32 Characters.  Thanks so much for the Alice Cooper link.  He really does sum it all up in just a few words.  I love the Alice!<br>  <br>  BQ:  It's only 12:12 here and so far it's going well!

mDxolwgpaa	This song and I have a history.<br>  <br>  I think we need something to introduce how it changed my life, so here's a bit of background info about my family... My mother has severe schizophrenia with a bit of bipolar and depression.  One of the things she clung to was religion, so the only thing we would listen to on the radio was christian rock and pop. You know, "You Raise Me Up," and the like. We also used to watch American Dreams on TV until it got too "pornographic!" and she wouldn't let us watch it anymore. The good thing that came out of that show was the fact that my dad bought the CD and let me download it onto my iPod. At the time, I wasn't allowed to listen to a bunch of stuff, so the only way I could really listen to the stuff I liked was through headphones so she wouldnt know. <br>  I was taking a walk one day when "The Sound of Silence" came on my ipod. The stuff I listen to now is equally as deep about a quarter of the time, but this was the first song I ever heard that was spiritual in a different way than I was used to. It wasnt a hymn, it was something else, something more powerful, and it triggered the first onslaught of real turmoil in my mind about god. <br>  <br>  My mom moved out, and I'm now agnostic. I think this song has had a major influence on my life just because it forced me to think in a way I had been afraid to in the past. I grew up a little when I first heard it. <br>  <br>  ... You probably didn't need that piece of history.<br>  <br>  As a song, the harmony is awesome. The guitar in the background is eerie, and it is quiet and powerful enough lyrically to hold you spellbound.|`|OwHqxXx8aa	Depends on my mood. But the song,even though it is considered folk-rock,is a well written number.|`|zM9Lj21waa	great tune even tho you have to be feeling pretty despondent to listen to it...|`|ONWCXzUMaa	No lie this is one of my top 5 songs of all time. Great choice<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|ssoZ33XIaa	I love that song, it's been a favorite of mine for a long time.  Excellent choice!|`|AA10246871	Well, for a moment there I thought I was having a really creepy moment. All there was was silence. Then I realized I had bumped my keyboard and muted everything. I was confused for a moment there, though. It was a moment of art made into life.<br>  <br>  This is a great song. I wouldn't say I like it as much as "The Boxer", as I like "story songs" a lot, but this is a well-written song. One of the strengths of Simon and Garfunkel is they knew how to write for their voices. I have heard Paul Simon sing this alone, and it's not quite as good. As for the lyrics, well, I believe that really good lyrics can stand alone as poetry, completely sans music. And this definitely fits the bill. (As an aside, that's why I like Bob Dylan's music--everything he wrote can stand alone as poetry--I often actually dislike the music, but I always like the lyrics.)<br>  <br>  So, I can't give it a Bandstand score, as it isn't good to dance to, but it's a hell of a good song, and both lyrical and vocal brilliance.|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	Oh yeah. That's just pure poetry, and since this song came out, lots of teachers have given this as an English assignment. It's beautiful and profound.<br>  <br>  Also very much love their "I am a Rock" song from the same era. And the "Boxer".|`|AA10652430	Oh!I heard that before. On the radio. It's decent.

High school was so much better. Way hotter girls, Better parties, everybody has a car, richer kids, better alcohol, and everybody didn't worry about what day it was to party etc.... College everybody is broke, hot chicks don't go to college, have to go to clubs to find the hottest chicks, frats are annoying especially when they think they are all that then try to mess with your house ( my house ) for having a better party then call the police when you do it back ( no arrests ),  nobody funny in class get all attention for being funny which gets you kicked out of class ( yes this is college not high school people laugh when I'm tell them this ), don't know which chick has a disease, college nobody parties on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday unless it is a holiday and people think they are all that when their not. The only two upsides to college I can think of currently is leaving in your own house ( apartment, dorm, whatever you had ) and I could get any ( I REPEAT ANY ) chick I wanted in college except the married ones or teachers ( I tried for a teacher though ). Pretty sad when high school chicks were hotter . I'm still in college so I might have more  recent experience. I don't see it changing senior year or senior semester depending if I get out early.<br>  <br>  If you think hot chicks go to college right after high school try again.

The Songs most people know do feature with other people but he does have many songs and albums by himself. And like "Melly" said tons of people want to feature with him|`|hUyIeCVlaa	Well "A Milli" and "Hustler Musik" were all singles done by Lil Wayne himself featuring no one and he still managed to have success with them.

She was just that type of person. She never stood for violence and that was the only thing she disciplined for. In the beginning of my teenage years and preteen years, I assumed it was okay to do drugs, have sex, sneak out etc. because I never got into trouble with her.<br>  <br>  As time went on, I learned the hard way. My best friend died when I was 13 and I took it hard. I stole my moms keys and wrecked her car. I went to the detention center and had to pay back a total of $200 in court fees and for once I felt remorse. Not necessarily because I had to pay the money but because I had no right to treat my mom that way. I constantly brought home report cards when I was lucky to have a C.<br>  <br>  When I was 13 I enrolled in a online school. I decided I was going to have to make a lot of changes in my life. It took 3 years of self discipline before I got it right. I still have my faults at 17 by being diagnosed as Bipolar. However, for the first time in my short life, I feel that I am worth something. I have all A's on my report card, I can get up at 7 in the morning with no problems, I can clean my room without being asked constantly, I can save my money, and I can disagree with someone but be respectful. Some people never learn any type of dicipline and at first, it's hard. However, if you stick to specific guidlines that you set for yourself, you can be the queen of both disipline and self-dicipline!|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I am undisciplined now. You just have to pick what you really want to be disciplined about & focus on it. Set up a time to do whatever it is each day for example. It is forcing yourself to do somethng you don't want to do.|`|MwiBGBK1aa	I had pretty strict parents, I've never sworn at them.|`|PRG7OiTJaa	the first  time my dad kicked my A** for yelling at my mom ( I'm a fast learner )|`|ZllkWRIOaa	what is discipline|`|tT6GMdHiaa	Beat Your Kids!<br>  -thats how|`|6dWlnf20aa	At the end of my dads belt it worked just fine.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	With patience and the reality that without discipline I can't be on a balance with life.

2kpr2arRaa	Networks were waiting for the March Ratings Sweeps to begin ( febs was moved to march this yr)<br>  <br>  _______________<br>  <br>  Sweeps ( A television ratings term)<br>  <br>  What are "sweeps"?  Sweeps are time periods when television stations/networks typically schedule programming designed to attract a larger than usual audience.<br>  <br>  Why?  Sweep period programming is designed to attract larger audiences who in turn are exposed to advertising commercial messages. Thus, when the ratings for the sweeps period are revealed, the TV station/network can charge its advertisers more money because more people watched.<br>  <br>  When do sweeps occur?  Typically four times a year: the months of February, May, July and November.<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  <br>  "The Sweeps" -  Local Market Measurement<br>  <br>  Several times each year, Nielsen Station Index (Nielsen Media Research's local market measurement service) collects demographic viewing data from sample homes in every one of the 210 television markets in the United States. Each home in the sample maintains a paper viewing diary for one week. Each household member writes down what programs they and their guests watch in their home during the course of that week.<br>  <br>  The term "sweeps" has been around since the beginning of TV measurement. These measurement periods are called "sweeps" because Nielsen Media Research mails out diaries to certain households around the country, then collects and processes the diaries in a specific order. The diaries from the Northeast regions are processed first and then swept up around the country, from the South, to the Midwest and finally ending with the West. The standard sweep months include November, February, May and July of each year.<br>  <br>  In some of the larger markets, there are as many as three additional months (October, January and March) during which diaries are used to provide viewer information. Standard reports based on the diary data are produced and issued regularly to clients. This viewing information is used by local television stations, cable systems, advertisers and their agencies to buy and sell commercial advertising as well as make programming decisions.   (Source: Nielsen Media )|`|9ZCkB6dzaa	Probably just building anticipation.

Decide how you want to report it.

"Watchmen" features a totally new set of heroes and villains. They're relative unknowns compared to Batman et al. Besides AFAIK Alan Moore (the writer and creator) and the publication responsible for "Watchmen" have nothing to do at all with DC Comics.<br>  <br>  There are resemblances to "Batman" though. First and foremost it's set in New York City and most of the heroes have no superpowers whatsoever. Second it's a detective comic, like "Batman".|`|wck4MHREaa	What?

I don't think there is a "normal" family, really - - we create an ideal in books and on television, etc. but it is a fantasy. I think we need to take the good and move forward to create our own lives and not dwell too much on the negative.  I know there are people who had better family experiences than I, but I also know I would not have to look far to find those that had worse.  For those who were truly abused - in what ever form - I admire them for their courage to over come what obstacles they faced in childhood.  <br>  As for how it impacted me -  I have been careful not to engage in the type of passive agressive and controlling behavior with my own children.  I have been imperfect, certainly, but I think my kids have had a much better childhood experience.|`|qhU3PDgfaa	it was not nice..<br>  i hate my childhood.. <br>  i was molested..and i ended up losing confidence...and many more things...<br>  <br>  i try hard..but i find it difficult to forget it..

I had a lot of BAD experiences when I was young and It lead to me continually finding myself in them as a teen. My Life has been riddled with Bad Situations but I knew my way out...

Lil' Wayne is hands down one of the biggest musicians on the planet and if he wants to make a rock album he’s gonna damn well make a rock album. Don’t hate before you actually take a listen to what he is saying and why he has chosen this route on his musical journey. We’re on the cusp of something huge in music right now. It’s a real turning point as we close in on the end of the first decade of the 21st century. The only thing keeping people interested in music today is change. Creativity. With Hip-Hop being stagnant for so many years, it’s refreshing to hear things you would never have imagined in your wildest dreams. Rappers are singing and singers are rapping and it actually doesn’t sound half bad. Haters will hate, but if Kanye can put himself out there and sing on an entire album and still sell units and have hit singles, anything can be done. Hip-Hop has always been a breeding ground for the next ****. Lil' Wayne is an incredibly successful rapper who is at the top of his game and with his rock album Rebirth due out April 7th, more than a few heads will be shaking. Some in approval, some in disbelief. Prom Queen is the first single and sets the bar high with the highschool tale of a girl Weezy was after who laughed him off, only to regret her decision later when she realized what she missed out on. Lil' Wayne is the evolution of music and along with a select few in Hip-Hop, they are ushering in a whole new sound. Without risk there is no reward.|`|GaHXxlS7aa	Oh she's nobody for now. It's just like Jim Jones "We Fly High" song, the girl on the hook with him was a nobody.|`|pExTATAsaa	you|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	Doesn't this belong in Rock?|`|hQbUwLvwaa	Lil Wayne
NJaZBgDwaa	The tempo should be around 148 beats a minute. The tempo does not change very much. It changes only in bar 14, where there is ritardando, then in bar 15 where there is tempo primo. (Meaning it slows down in bar 14, then goes to its original tempo in bar 15) Then in bar 44 (second to last bar) there is again a rit.<br>  <br>  Some people might make other little changes in tempo, but those are the only changes that are written.<br>  <br>  Just play it allegro. (Or read the music, do you think that would help?)

If there is no other movie in for that one. They will credit you. Some BBV's have additional day charges now, so its important you let them know asap. But they are closed right now...well depends on what part of US your on. Most on Friday and Saturday close at midnight. They will not charge you for another one because i t was not your fault. But if you really don't want to watch the movie anymore. They can refund your money. Just be nice to the employees please, We do our best to help you.

And at fifty years of age, his voice is bound to be deeper than it was at 25-30 So the changes just seem logical to me.

In fact, this has happened.|`|z2bejpm1aa	i'm pretty sure they would stop lol|`|UwFb8cleaa	nah uh|`|ij9N9r5waa	No, the driver will be detained by the police answering questions so that two others are dispatched, 1 to go to orig location,  and the second to the current accident scene.|`|LNEvMAk8aa	no, it just throws one of the paramedics out and continues onto the original scene<br>  unless it's dr. carter of er, then he just keeps going and dispatches help for the hit and run|`|gY88GEtSaa	uhm, yesss?!?!?!|`|OLQmoyNSaa	of course;<br>  they'll come back for that person<br>  but then they'll run over another person.<br>  then its just happens over and over again.|`|GtEfBBwAaa	Is this a serious question?

lGSUToFQaa	yes she sure can it's a job related expense, <br>  <br>  <br>  so unfair right<br>  <br>  <br>  Although a simple nose job or tummy tuck is more than likely not deductible, certain types of cosmetic surgery may be a legitimate tax write-off if you can show that it is a necessity for your job. This was proven in the case of exotic dancer Cynthia Hess (a.k.a. "Chesty Love"), who sued the IRS in order to take a $2,088 tax deduction for her breast augmentation that left her with a size 56FF chest. Hess was allowed to take the tax write-off in that her 20 pound breasts were used for the purposes of making money at an Indiana strip club, and were essentially looked at as a "stage prop."|`|hFVPEkWjaa	yes u can :)|`|Ev6WQRmzaa	This sounds familiar|`|VmLZFN4Taa	HAHA<br>  <br>  Probably|`|dPgP28Aiaa	Hahah that's funny, but I'd think so.|`|z2bejpm1aa	lmfao yeh i think she can|`|ij9N9r5waa	yes, also G-Strings, bathing suits, make-up, all of her beauty supplies.|`|rXbtkSBWaa	lololololololol,|`|dJrJYLBFaa	hahaha probably.|`|8sMuQa7haa	Yes.<br>  That will be $500 please.|`|CCXMW0HYaa	Yes.|`|3Fma3URSaa	i think so|`|eKbWhBqIaa	yes|`|gY88GEtSaa	yes|`|rFHTPpVNaa	You actually can.|`|jMF1LiGnaa	hahahhaha good question :P<br>  ill go with yes|`|AA12290212	LOL|`|Yq1PmF4xaa	yup yup lol funny stuff you got there
HNaeWVHKaa	It could indeed be possible. <br>  Although the apparent 'death' of Kakashi should have released his four tails and if Iruka was in Hinata's place he would have released a few more.<br>  <br>  If ever he is to release all tails in the series I would think it would indeed be the death of Sakura. I can't think of anyone else he has a closer affection for.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Actually if you look, it was 6 tails. Um probably considering how much he cares for sakura. But i don't think the 9 tails would come out instantly i think it would go to like 8 or something like that.|`|ZOsIPzsYaa	Just like Darek Khort said he has always had a crush on Sakura. He would probably release all nine tails if she was killed,but if he did he would probably die,and that would be the end of the series.

Well my two favorites right now are Adam Lambert and Danny Gokey. I really think one of them will win.<br>  <br>  Other favorites that I hope get far are: Allison Iraheta, Kris Allen, Scott MacIntyre, Jorge Nunez and Anoop Desai.<br>  <br>  I really can't stand Jasmine Murray and Lil Rounds. The rest I'm just in the middle with.|`|1hpqBhf5aa	Top 2: Allison Iraheta and Lil Rounds (maybe Danny Gokey)<br>  Winner: Allison Iraheta :)|`|jJZz2U8Gaa	Judging by people with the most talent, kris, matt, danny, adam, alexis, lil rounds will be in the finals.|`|IDZofGJgaa	anoop and megan
RusTwYZnaa	1.- Adam Lambert( if you saw him sing the rolling stones, his voice was amazing.. he can hit notes so high, yet go so low.. his vocal range is amazing!!! NONE! of the men in season 8 can sing as high as he can.. therefore he= #1!!<br>  2.-Danny Gokey( his soulful voice reminds me of Rascal Flatts which is amazing in it's self)<br>  3.-Michael Sarver(i know, i know what your thinking.. who? Not many people pick him but I love his voice.. It's got kind of a soulful vibe and its not what you expect from a big guy like that.. I think american idol needs a guy like him because he Truly is an all american guy.. and again he sounds allot like Rascal Flatts that bluesy soulful type. WHICH IS WHAT AMERICAN IDOL NEEDSS!!!!!)<br>  4.- Scott MacIntyre( I love his voice and it's amazing since he's blind... I loved when he sang daughtry and he's a master on the piano.. But i worry that america takes pitty on him because he is in fact blind.. So if he does bad america will still say yes because they feel sorry for him.. But to me he's another stevie wonder!!!!! He has a nice sweet voice and magic fingers when i close my eyes and listen to him he takes me too a happy place )<br>  <br>  NOTE: i don't talk about the girls because america has had enough annoying dumb blondes win already.. and that lil rounds chick is just another Fantasia.. the last thing we need is another kelly or carrie.. It's time for some real talent, not that sellout top 40 pop bullcrap!|`|YIcBd569aa	Megan isn't another dumb blond girl her voice is different and unique she's more of a jazz singer than anything and jazz is unique to american idol contestants i like <br>  Lil rounds<br>  danny gorkey<br>  Megan<br>  scott<br>  allison <br>  alexis<br>  matt<br>  I not excited about adam or anoop. I don't think they sound any better than the others but they have a good voice. it too bad american idol is nothing more than a popularity contest. the contestants who made the wild card should be proud because the judges liked them which means they really have a terrific voice. and the judges have a better understanding of what a singer should sound like than most of america. out of all of them I want Megan to go far. I love her jazzy voice.|`|X5Qzk78maa	the winner will be either adam cuz he is crazy, kris cuz girls like him, allison cuz she is young, megan cuz she is hot!|`|AA10345961	some of them were really memorable to me. <br>  <br>  my first will be matt or danny. i really like matt's i dont want to be and danny's i hope you dance and his audition song.<br>  <br>  as for adam im amazed by his range but he sound to girl when he sing soo high. the rolling stone song is one gd example.. im amazed but i just don like his nature of his tone.|`|DQkDQraOaa	Danny Gokey<br>  Lil Rounds<br>  Matt Giraud<br>  Anoop Desai<br>  Scott McIntyre<br>  Adam Lambert<br>  <br>  I don't really like the rest of them much.|`|oThluLJJaa	I'm not really familiar with the names yet but I like Adam Lambert, Danny Gokey and I think it's Matt Giraud|`|Hjsy8rnRaa	13. Scott MacIntyre (I hate him. Is that a good reason?)<br>  12. Michael Sarver<br>  11. Jasmine Murray<br>  10. Jorge Nu?ez<br>  9. Matt Giraud<br>  8. Kris Allen<br>  7. Megan Joy Corkrey<br>  6. Danny Gokey<br>  5. Anoop Desai<br>  4. Lil Rounds<br>  3. Alexis Grace<br>  2. Adam Lambert<br>  1.

AA10074522	there are several it just depends on what you are looking for... if you are looking for the same are stile and similar type story i am not sure exactly where to point you however some other recommendations for full length anime movies would include.<br>  <br>  Appleseed....   CG animation set in the future in a partially utopian post apocalyptic city.<br>  <br>  Appleseed Ex Machina.  think of it as same characters different story<br>  <br>  Blood the last Vampire.... Vampire hunter samurai sword wielding girl with a bad attitude lots of action<br>  <br>  Final Fantasy VII.... only loosly related to the game...<br>  <br>  Ghost in the Shell.... Futuristic cyborg police special investigation unit very tactical stuff ... hard to describe but a good flik to be sure<br>  <br>  Grave of the Fireflies.. real tearjerker but VERY POWERFULY moving story about the firebombing of tokyo in WW II <br>  <br>  now that i think about it just about anything by Hayao Miyazaki is a cant miss.... especialy "Laputa  Castle in the sky" and Naussicaa of the valley of the wind. and Princess Mononoke<br>  <br>  <br>  that should give you a good starting place... tho next time you might want to be more specific as for what you are looking for in as far as story and whatnot...|`|cRwYEyBJaa	Samurai Champloo|`|Wod4nE0Taa	samurai x:trust and betrayal<br>  but maybe watch the series before hand|`|VCjmXiGaaa	it may be live action, but watch the death note movie.

XJi0l3JUaa	If you don't have the drive or the passion to pursue music, than no your did not have a future in it.  We may like to do things as hobbies, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we are meant to do those things in life.  If music is something that you do want to pursue, or atleast make a part of your life again, maybe you should take some lessons or learn how to play an instrument.  It will be harder because you are older, but if you have determination, you may be able to reach your goal, whatever that may be.|`|7mtzpD68aa	I'd say you should still give it a try so you can totally find out if being a musician is your thing.

SZOMVGBRaa	Never had it myself, first I have heard of it. Here's a little bit about why its Illegal in America or not I guess ?  I was suprised to learn its made by Kraft Foods.<br>  <br>  In October 2006, the Melbourne newspaper, the Herald Sun incorrectly reported that Vegemite had been banned in the United States, and that the United States Customs Service had gone so far as to search Australians entering the country for Vegemite. (ROFL)  The story appears to have originated as an anecdote by a traveler who claimed to have been searched by US Customs. Also, a spokesperson for Kraft made a misinformed comment to reporters. The story led to some anti-American comments (of course, because everyone loves to hate us) in blogs and newspapers. The Herald Sun blamed the US President for the ban, and encouraged readers to post comments on its website and send emails to the White House.<br>  <br>  The US Food and Drug Administration later stated that although it is technically illegal in the US to add folate to food products other than grains, there were no plans to investigate whether Vegemite contains folate, subject it to an import ban, or withdraw it from supermarket shelves. The United States Customs and Border Protection also tried to dispel the rumor, stating on its website that "there is no known prohibition on the importation of Vegemite" and "there is no official policy within CBP targeting Vegemite for interception".The story of the "ban" later took on the status of urban legend. While Vegemite has never been popular in the U.S., it can still be purchased at supermarkets that stock imported food items. <br>  <br>  Our customs can't even stop terrorist's from coming into our country how the hell would they be able to stop Vegemite. That whole story made me laugh.<br>  <br>  I have never seen it personally, I will have to go look and try it and see what all the hype is about. It better not turn me into a kangaroo or anything lol.|`|Xnx7p7OHaa	Love Vegemite but then again I'd be deported from Australia if I didn't. (lol)|`|kA7GEKf7aa	I do.

Justin timberlake, Chris brown, Usher, Beyounce, Rhianna.....etc<br>  <br>  Michael is known as the KING OF POP and so far no one has knocked him out of that position<br>  <br>  In 1997 michael jackson was named the most famous person in the word.<br>  KING OF POP STAYS ON TOP|`|bc34ec59002a028af03455eb88fd84ebaa	Michael Jackson obviously, i think if it wasn't for MJ, Eminem might not hav been around. Cos all those that hav inspired Eminem are moslty black ppl...and it was MJ who helped black ppl recieve MORE attention and he was the 1st major crossover artist. People say the Beatles are big, but if u think about it the Beatles' music and fans are majorly limited to white ppl, whereas with MJ its black AND white (and other colours!) ppl who like his music...so yeah MJs definitely bigger. If not, just look at the record sales, around the world too!<br>  <br>  MJ is as big a brand as Coco Cola and McDonalds.<br>  <br>  Its common knowledge MJ has the biggest fan base...i mean any other artist who has been thru what MJ has been thru would not even be spat at, but cos MJ is a genius and the best in his field he will remain a legend and someone will ALWAYS like him.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	I had almost forgotten about Slim Shady . . .

And ill tell you why!<br>  <br>  <br>  Michael Jackson - The MUSIC KING.<br>  <br>  He is well known, withover 200million Fans worldwide, When in a survey,  For each country , people were asked, who would you rather Have as a Personality/Form If you had to chose, 53% Of Britain Prefered Michael Jackson over, Chris Brown, Rhianna, David B., Paul O'Grady, Latoya Jackson, James Bond (P.Brosnan).<br>  <br>  Michael is, And will always, be even after his death,  The King of Pop and people will always love him, and adore him, and generations of generations of generations will always like his music. So Michael Will always have more and more fans too come.<br>  <br>  Slim Shady/Eminem - Nothing<br>  <br>  Yes, good artist, but have (on Reasearch) less than 18 million Fans.<br>  And they wouldnt be for ever going. when death dawns for him, he will die his fans will mourn, and then they will forget about him, or atleast push him to the back of there minds.<br>  <br>  So thats sorted for fans, now Global Brand <br>  <br>  MJ - Brands<br>  Clothing Brand<br>  Sony<br>  MJJ Productions<br>  Flipancoq<br>  JAH<br>  <br>  Eminem - Brands<br>  Clothig<br>  Dolla.<br>  <br>  I think MJ Outways the Labeling etc.<br>  <br>  Michael jackson - King of Pop (and most other genres)<br>  Eminem - Prince Of Rap (and thats it)<br>  <br>  So their both legends, In their own way.<br>  <br>  CONSIDERATIONS<br>  ---------------------------------<br>  <br>  MJ been about since 1950 <br>  Eminem hasnt been famous for aslong.<br>  <br>  SOURCE Considerations<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Im a Bigger fan of Michael, over Eminem, so take that into consideration, But i do think ive given a good enough Balance this way.<br>  <br>  Michael icon<br>  <br>  Glove <br>  Shoes<br>  Moonwalk<br>  Finger clicks<br>  Spin<br>  Sidewalk<br>  Toe stand<br>  <br>  And many others<br>  <br>  Em. icon<br>  <br>  Gun?<br>  Tattoos?<br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  People HAVE Fits at Mjs Concerts, and only 2 have been known to die, and thats just from speaking/dancing/singing/precense, Where as Em. can only do that, by shooting them :P or throwing knives into the crowd of 100.|`|e5Uk9jNTaa	You can't be serious!

CrAwmz65aa	I'm risking an attack from the DYOH brigade, but here is my analysis:<br>  <br>  The first theme, in F major, starts at the beginning.<br>  One source, I forget where, marks the upbeat of ms. 13 as the transition.<br>  The second theme, in the dominant, starts on the upbeat to ms. 19.<br>  <br>  On the upbeat to ms. 142, we hear a melody in c minor.  It's in the wrong mode, but right tonal center, for the second theme.  So we can group this theme with the second theme.<br>  <br>  This all cadences in the key of C in measure 55.  Beethoven could stop here, but he doesn't.  So everything from here to the repeat sign is a codetta.<br>  <br>  Everything between the repeat sign (ms. 68) and the key change to two sharps (ms. 118) I would call the development.<br>  <br>  At the key change, Beethoven does something really dastardly.  He starts to recapitulate the first theme, but in the wrong key.  He finishes recapitulating it at the keychange back to one flat (ms. 139).  So we aren't sure whether to mark ms. 120 or ms. 139 as the recapitulation.<br>  (Just this morning, I was looking at his F# major sonata, and found that he pulls the same trick there.  Live and learn!)<br>  <br>  The second theme reappears, this time in F major, on the upbeat to ms. 147.  The extra theme reappears, this time in f minor, on the upbeat to ms. 142.  The codetta reappears, this time in F major and renamed the coda, reappears on the second beat of ms. 191.<br>  <br>  Any time you see a piece with a key change and another key change back to the first key, it's a safe bet that it's in the ternary form, with A at the beginning, B at the key change, and A at the return to the first key.  In the case of the second movement here, the first theme is in f minor and the second theme is in Db major.  This reminds me of Fur Elise, which begins and ends in a minor, but one of the other themes is in F major.<br>  <br>  For the fhird movement, I would use a term which I coined myself: it's a "monothematic sonata movement."  That means that it has an exposition, a development, and a recapitulation, but only one theme.  (Take a look at Schumann's Traumerei.  It's a monothematic sonata, too.)<br>  <br>  The first theme starts at the beginning.  You could call ms. 17-18 a dominant cadence, or you could call ms. 22-23 a dominant cadence.  Somehow, I prefer to draw the line at ms. 23.  That means that everything else up to the repeat sign is a codetta.  <br>  <br>  Starting at the repeat sign is what most people might call a "modulatory section."  I would call it a development.  Either way.<br>  <br>  The opehning theme is restated, this time in the bass, on the upbeat to ms. 87.  In ms. 124-125, we see the same cadence which we saw in ms. 22-23, but this time in the tonic.  <br>  <br>  In ms. 125-133, we see the codetta from the first section, this time in the key of F.  But this time, Beethoven is not even content to stop here.  So we have a coda in two sections.<br>  <br>  Any time you're analyzing a composition, here is a good place to start:<br>  <a href="http://www.lib.utk.edu/music/analysis/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lib.utk.edu/music/analysis/</a><br>  <br>  Write back and tell me how my analysis compares with that of the experts.

j0mI8l07aa	Mile High Comics is selling an A-Team #1 in really good shape (Very Fine) for $4.45 right now. They list the price for a NM copy at $20.00 but they don't actually have any in stock right now. Which means if you have a MINT copy they'd probably buy it from you for about $5.00. Honestly Mile High is one of the more expensive online shops because they have such a MASSIVE inventory. I think a good price for a MINT/NEAR MINT (almost perfect) copy would be around $6.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.milehighcomics.com/cgi-bin/backissue.cgi?action=list&title=00778367902&snumber=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.milehighcomics.com/cgi-bin/ba...</a>|`|u9RwzLPnaa	Find a local comic shop and find out.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=csl" rel="nofollow">http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=...</a><br>  <br>  now my guess is NOTHING, since nobody cares about the A-team but then again I could be wrong. You could have a fortune! $$$|`|ebb4b810f34245706f791aeb50bec63aaa	Mile High Comics is a horrible website to compare prices because of how ridiculously high they price everything.  Anyways the price guide value for A-Team #1 is $2.50 for the 60 cent cover and $8 for the 75 cent cover.  There's a ton of copies of that issue on Ebay that can't even be sold for $1 so that is a pretty good indication that it is nearly worthless.

All he did was rap on it anyways.|`|ReqWzUM0aa	Nah, he's been into rock for a long time now. I believe it was about 2 or 3 years ago when I first saw him on stage playing an electric guitar. Lil' Wayne's style is like Jim Jones' style, it's a little rock and a little 'thug'. And no, I don't think his career is over, this album is probably a one-time thing, something he's wanting to try out. It's good that he widen's his genre of music. And I think "Prom Queen" is a decent song, but it's a little too plain, somethings missing, it's not "Weezy" enough.|`|TFizPrvuaa	that was just his start.. he had it all planned out|`|BT5QzRHgaa	It was probaly all the drugs... they make him think he's a rock star.|`|W0U5HdIOaa	People still love lil wayne he's a talented person...

596a75e7c6a4325fea04d813bcf8fee2aa	It's hard to sell instrumental music only. I would see if you can find a really hot female vocalist, or try remixing someone existing hits. From listening to your Techno WarFare track, it sounds like you have some experience with this. Also, these tunes seem a little bit subdued, they don't really drive me to want to get up and move. Like I think if you did the background of "Nippon Club" twice as fast, it would add a lot more beat complexity to it and make it drive more.

3bRIEj98aa	I LOVE THIS SHOW!!! this is the first series ive watched...<br>  <br>  ive always loved #7...he was so smart and just so positive about every treatment... and last saturday they didnt take anyone out before the finale...so i was really excited about yesterday haha.  i have to admit #4 was very very impressive, i just had this feeling #7 was going to win...my whole family said #4 was going to win, even my husband!!! loool<br>  in the beginning of the show i honestly thought #9 was going to win, i thought it was unfair how he had to go, its like they made the treatment to get him out, but if ou think about it he wouldnt be able to do the rope challenge anyways...<br>  <br>  my favorite treatment was the mousetraps lool i actually laughed at it rather than sitting at the edge of my seat!!<br>  but all in all, its so sad how the final three turned out, i mean how number 3 and 4 lost...it was so much suspense and soo hard to guess who would win! they were all soooo good.|`|AA11510033	I Also Love this show I wanted 3 Katie or 5 Maureen To win<br>  I really Thought Number 4 was Rob Because He Trained for It <br>  As for The Treatment I Like The Rope and the gum ball treatment|`|ef1zX3Mjaa	ok all i have to say is that ROBROB is a pu$$y. he cries allll the time. dude grow a pairrrr.<br>  <br>  1. i liked number 9<br>  2. number 9 again<br>  3. i liked the one where they had to eat all the food. haha|`|KB9HF3NVaa	1.

The mousetraps one! I found that so incredibly funny. And Robrob won! And number 5(?) was so funny with it when she quit.|`|USt4MZSBaa	1. #4/ RobRob <br>  <br>  2. i thought RobRob because he has trained for it for a long time he said and i am not surprised that he was in the final 2 but i was so shocked when he did not win!<br>  <br>  3. my fav treatment was the maze, the last treatment (looked like a cross), and the spider web.|`|2cH8JeVNaa	I liked number 3 and number 8.

There was also a black Juicy Couture-looking hoodie w/Circus Tour logo (forgot price).  All of the women's shirts were $40 while the men's were $45.  The kid's shirt was either $30 or $35.   The tour program was $30.  There was another shop section which featured more of the circus novelty items: a black top hat ($30), a feathered mask ($5), a picture of britney ($5), a plastic orange cup with circus tour logo ($3 and a smaller one for $2), a poster ($10), etc.  They even sold cotton candy and popcorn to enhance the circus atmosphere.|`|3c5f2316d7b180d5f45a6448d9b9def0aa	There are over 40 items on sale for this tour.<br>  Velour sweat suits (eewww), burn out tees, embroidered track jackets, embroidered hats, masks, illuminated boa scarves, top hats and more.<br>  <br>  Can't seem to find a definitive listing of all available merchandise or one with prices. <br>  Even britneyspears.com doesn't have one.<br>  <br>  I understand you wanting an idea of the costs before a concert, but you may have to wait till you go - take lots of money!<br>  <br>  Tyler, you might like to watch this ET video on the tour's merchandise:<br>  <a href="http://www.etonline.com/video-224.php?slate=%2Fmedia%2Fvideo%2F2009%2F03%2F80942%2Fet_britneymerchandise_090303_large.jpg&vid=71376&config=%2Fmedia%2Fvideo%2F2009%2F03%2F71376%2Findex.php&sitesection=etonlinemain&videoasset=71376-et_britneymerchandise_090303" rel="nofollow">http://www.etonline.com/video-224.php?sl...</a>
5IKklL9haa	Can't stand Scorpio males...am an Aries...|`|mD7eAAoNaa	Aires! I have a "good" friend and she is an Aires, but I can only take her in moderation. She talks sooooooo much! It's ridiculous! All she talks about is herself, what she did, how she did it, when she did it, why she did it, when she is gonna do it again, she talks about her dog nonstop, brags about her success, rubs it in your face, puts you down, makes you feel stupid. Another thing, she gets her studying done and then invites herself over to my apartment and starts talking and doesn't let me get my studying done. I try to zone her out but it's impossible. It's ridiculous and I cannot even say anything to her because I will look like the bad person, it's that kind of situation. She also tells her parents about the smallest detail about her life. I don't know how they put up with her. There is only so much talking and listening someone can do. She tests my patience so much. <br>  <br>  My cousin is an Aires and she is pretty annoying too, really really random.<br>  <br>  -Virgo|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	Scropio, Virgo, Libra, Aries|`|Po6dgusAaa	For me its any sign that thinks they are better than anyone else,annoying,or lack common courtesy and hygiene.<br>  <br>  I'm a capricorn.<br>  <br>  LOLL.at the answer below.I completely understand what you mean XP<br>  <br>  Help the planetles: You probably have considering I haven't been married yet. =]|`|8ssiOsDzaa	aries, two of my closest friends are aries but sometimes they can be sooooo annoying that i just want to bite their head off >.<<br>  and capricorns, i never really liked them, they simply get on my nerves for absolutely no reason<br>  and i am a scorpio =)|`|to6JW3yFaa	Im a Pisces and I just cant stand some Taurus, Scorpios, and, Aries|`|izX7ymibaa	I'm scorpio, and Libra, Pisces and Leo females drive me bonkers.|`|3JL40zc1aa	Well...I'm a Gemini...<br>  I'm gonna say that the 2 signs that get on my nerves the most would be Libras and Virgos...I get along with them actually, but there are just things about them...Libras can be so humble and balanced that they sort of over-do the kindness and let people take advantage of them and they tend to ramble in a redundant way...<br>  and Virgos can be sooo picky and critical, and being a Gemini, it really really irks me how they judge people who aren't up to their standards or don't believe the way they do...NO OFFENSE EVERYONE! <br>  Just my opinions from personal experience.|`|NoZzbS3Uaa	its so funny all you Capricorns are mentioning that you cant stand geminis b/c i am a gemini and i cant stand your a**es either! lol haha!<br>  <br>  capricorns are boring boring boring, dry sense of humor, act like they have a stick up their a**es all the time, i mean what is the deal? lol.  let loose once in while cuz you may say gemini are annoying but you couldn't even come close to having a deep, fun, philosophical, comical conversation like us geminis any day!|`|0l88fiUTaa	I'm a Libra and a lot of people piss me off sometimes so here are their signs in no particular order: pisces, aries, leo, cancer, gemini, virgo, and one libra (so, basically I listed all my family members and some friends ha ha I guess no one can please me, not even a person with my sign!)|`|ax9xk0Ndaa	Libras<br>  <br>  Sometimes they try to manipulate me or mind control..<br>  Never get why i do certain things or maybe they do but they're just trying to p me off..<br>  <br>  I'm not that wierd =[ lol.......|`|47l1Sumeaa	Well --- I'm a Capricorn and I find your comment offensive. :/ Gemini gets on my nerves.|`|AA12215623	Capricorn (male), but Gemini females I can't be around AT all.|`|IGu4bx51aa	Has to be Capricorn They are a bloody pain<br>  <br>  What is my sign ...Capricorn<br>  <br>  edit<br>  <br>  Answer me damit lol<br>  I bet I had more wives than you had husbands<br>  <br>  Ha Ha who the hell would have us !!|`|OegheALwaa	i have noticed that gemini annoys me most.<br>  im a pisces.|`|8WajgMlGaa	I'm a Cancer and it'd have to be Sagittarius, Aries, and Gemini.<br>  <br>  I get along with people of the Sagittarius sign pretty well and have a number of them as friends, but I like to settle in and they can never sit still, they always want to go out on an adventure and I can only take so much.

South park is also better than family guy, about on par with the simpsons.|`|AA10774810	Family Guy hands down.  I don't know how on earth they get away with some of the things they do on that show.  What I wouldn't give to be in that room when they're writing the episodes.  LOL!  Plus, you gotta love the cutaway gags.
oiUb21yNaa	Yes I definitely hate that.<br>  You put so much effort into giving a decent helpful answer and all you get is a lousy 2 points when someone else says, for example the question is: "Do you like the band 30 Seconds to Mars?" and you say "Yes I do. I love Jared's vocals, Shannen's drumming and Tomo's guitar. Also I love Matt and its a shame that he left." and the person who gets the best answer says "Yep."<br>  <br>  I especially hate it when you actually research the subject so you can give a decent answer. <br>  <br>  Your welcome...xxx|`|bHphhSYbaa	Do you even realize how much this happens? I guess you do since your asking this question. Just know this. We live in a stupid society where it takes nothing to gain the attention of people.

lOkWLI9Caa	The combination of your Sun sign and your Moon sign produces a personality that is discriminating, intellectual, and peace-loving. This position blends the intelligence, analytical insight and discrimination of Virgo, with the emotional balance, courtesy and friendliness of Libra. You are friendly and know how to make a good impression, but you can remain detached and impersonal in relationships. You have a sense of restraint and diplomacy in your nature that prevents you from ever coming on very strong. You may not even voice your opinion unless you feel you really have something of value to offer. Mental stimulation and study keep your quiet and observant personality occupied and content. You enjoy companionship and in having a good time, but excesses and extremes are not your style. The critical aspect of Virgo is softened by the Libra Moon, creating a fine and precise balance. The elements of discrimination and criticism blend to make you very selective in associations, and contained or restrained in the saying or doing of anything that might hurt or offend others. Your reaction to coarseness is avoidance. While perhaps a lover of humanity in general, your tendency to examine individuals closely before you accept them in any social sense, leads others to view you as highly aloof and particular. You have a way of eluding the issue and being thought of hard to get to know. You practice a quiet and unassuming approach to life, having a live and let live creed. The social aspects of Libra make you inclined to enjoy friendships, but not the deep, intimate relationships associated with romance. You have an intellectual curiosity and love to experiment, to muse over what you have learned. Mental analysis and impartial judgment are the major strengths of this combination.

But of course that's just half of the story. Then there is the show, the constant dog and pony show, the criticism, the hate blogs. Crazy. I feel sorry for them.|`|uKBadZPXaa	It's about Kate!  It seems like she has been suffering from something like post partum depression for a while.  I stopped watching 'cause she was always being such a hag to Jon.

The highlights for me were:<br>  <br>  -Kitchening<br>  -The bear on the bed<br>  -The crotch-angle-interview with too much inner thigh showing<br>  -Steven's acting<br>  <br>  You've got quite the delivery.  I mean, seriously, I love how you said your lines.  Were those lines written in advance?  Or just ad libbed?  Either way, I think you've got some great acting skills.<br>  <br>  I think the content needs some work but, you know, it's all about practice and producing much more of these to make some truly funny stuff.  Keep 'em coming and I'm sure you'll have success in the future...<br>  <br>  (and, yes, I saw you're from New Zealand)

However, if you don't intend on playing seriously then all you really need is a way to be able to read music (so being able to read tabs is fine) and to be able to write down your own music, if you're going to be making any original music.|`|XJi0l3JUaa	no, you could read tabs or play by ear<br>  its magical<br>  don't know how they do it|`|bojIKJMNaa	technically, no...but it sure makes it a WHOLE lot easier!

aHEwm3QLaa	R&S is definitely better.<br>  <br>  And I agree, the atheists are usually the nice one there.<br>  <br>  Edit: To another answerer, as have been answered by the atheists already, you don't have to be religious to go to R&S. Why is it that non-cats can go into the cats section? The same with R&S. Now, we might disagree with many things, but I hope that you can at least agree that religion has done many evil things in the past and is continuing to do so in the present. Certainly, any rational person would want to talk about it.<br>  <br>  Also, atheism is just a disbelief in deities. You can still be a religious or spiritual atheist.|`|TBZK5q78aa	R&S by a mile man....<br>  <br>  "Most of the trollings in R&S seems to come from the religious.<br>  <br>  The atheists/agnostics/deists are the nice ones in the section."<br>  <br>  That's not true... I never had a problem with any agnostic or deist, but a lot of atheists there are belligerent. There are ignorant people in every race, belief, etc. Most atheists there are just a plethora of children that insult answers or ask belligerent questions, and a lot of the Christians there are bigots. There are some theists/atheists that has rational sense and respect others beliefs... For the mos part the R&S section epitomizes vexation.<br>  <br>  There are trolls from atheists and theists... So it's not necessarily just one or the other... I stay out of both section because people there are vexing. Politics isn't so bad IMO. R&S involves a bunch of futile rants.|`|EPki0rwgaa	Politics are talking about people who actually exist, but when it comes to religion...they are talking and arguing about mythical creatures and Gods. Politics is better.|`|YlMR42agaa	R&S running mad with athiest who need to mind there own bee's wacks!<br>  <br>  yea but why are you there if your athiest? <br>  only to aggitate people? That's not your place!<br>  <br>  that's like going to lgbt and start protesting gays<br>  <br>  that's not your place get out|`|47l1Sumeaa	R&S is CRAZY.|`|UG2VpQjaaa	What if they made a Religious Politician section??? There would be no end...<br>  <br>  I think it would have to be the Politics section, bipartisan politics is never clearer there with such irrational people there, I wonder how old there truly are... They act like 12 year olds and I always thought the only people with an impact on politics would be the people 21 and over, but I guess 12 year olds feel the need to express themselves politically even though they don't know ****.<br>  <br>  The religious section is pretty rational when I make a quick visit there, it's chaotic I hear but I just think religion, being a less tangible subject than politics people have more of a right and reason to be less rational when thinking about religion since everything contradicts with everyone else. They should make sections for every type of religion so then you can ask a question without someone answering "your god is false" 9/10 times.|`|7LkJ8G1Jaa	hmmm... definitely politics imo, they are always at one anothers' necks. at least there's a bit more diversity in the R&S section<br>  <br>  I love P&S.. so laid back.. we are the cool kids of Yahoo|`|NhF9sM5jaa	the trolling is worse in politics<br>  but atleast the people there are a bit more open minded|`|TvTg82wyaa	I love the R&S section!!!

I think I can handle R&S more, cuz I know NOTHING about politics.<br>  <br>  I'm spiritual, with a live and let live attitude, so they don't get on my nerves quite so much.  lol.
0234a5919425f2503a2245af18fde971aa	Vito never says this, just so you know. He is sexist when he says "Women and children can be weak, but not a real man." Also when he slaps Johny Fontaine and tells him he cries like a women. Also the entire way he structures his family and his organization is sexist because it excludes women in any position of power. He also seems to have raised his sons to continue this male superior hierarchy.|`|wD86088oaa	From your examples, despite these examples being fallacious, Vito would be a polygamist. Vito Corleone, however, is not a polygamist, he's womanizer. He has a wife and a mistress--he's not married to the mistress. <br>  <br>  He has a mistress, because he is rich and powerful. The two women signify his dominance among men. Having two women fulfills multiple roles in his life. Vito as a powerful person, who can have whatever he wants. And Vito as a man, whose libido is greater than the average man. And Vito Don of the underworld, whose life is ruled by sin, such as adultery. And several other roles. <br>  <br>  While this is very "sexist," Vito would not be Vito unless he had the wife and the mistress. So, Vito himself might not be a womanizer, but his role as Don forces him to live up to expectations.|`|ddcvo5YZaa	Vito actually says ..."for me, there is only my wife and my children" hes actually different from the other don's since he doesn't cheat on his wife, and even if he did, he would be sinning and go to hell for it, sexism is a made up term from the west, its not real, its made up to force society against the natural order of things, and the fact that people act as if its a real word has basically led to the destruction of the American family.|`|146MzXiTaa	don corleone is a fictional character.<br>  <br>  even if he was real, he was a gangster.  anyone who considers a gangster to be a great man needs their head examined.|`|CzIaAnsraa	why the heck would u ask that at this time of night?

WpqwaqcQaa	that like most everything in this movie<br>  <br>  is up to you to decide.<br>  <br>  unless your the writer or the directors of the film, your just guessing.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	My interpretation is that it was yet another symbol of fate. Up until then, Anton Chigurh was the personification of fate.  He was like a whirlwind that blew in, swept over everyone, changed (or ended) the lives of everyone who felt him pass, and then disappeared as quickly as he arrived.  I think that that scene was just symbolic of how we are sometimes blindsided by fate.  In Anton's case, it happened quite literally.  He was literally BLINDSIDED by his own.|`|2gIVF2QEaa	Agree with Eyes Wide Shut.<br>  <br>  Also, from a storytelling point of view, it was important that some kind of negative consequence fell on Chigurh. Bad guys have to get what they deserve in stories. Watch the news and bad guys get away with what they do every day. Innocent people are killed and they get away with it. One of the underlying reason that audiences like to see movies is that people want to live out their fantasies of seeing justice served.<br>  <br>  This idea is summed up by Oscar Wilde:<br>  <br>  "The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what fiction means."|`|56bNLJykaa	No matter what happens, the cycle of violence wont stop- it cannot be killed or put down if you will..

DEXSuqT7aa	I don't think it was ever mentioned.<br>  <br>  I know pretty much everyones name in the movie has a spiritual meaning  here is for Neo/Thomas<br>  <br>  An anagram of Neo is One.<br>  According to the Wachowski brothers, "Neo is Thomas Anderson's potential self."<br>  The name Thomas is Hebrew and means "twin." As Agent Smith tells Neo, "You have been living two lives." As Thomas, he unknowingly lives inside the matrix and works for a software compnay. As Neo, he is a computer hacker who wakes up in the real world. <br>  Neo is referred to as "the One". In "The Secret Language of Dreams," it states that the number 1 represents "the prime mover from which all manifest creation flows, the single principle from which diversity is born. In dreams it may represent the source of all life, the ground of being..." <br>  In Christian theology, Jesus Christ is the Messiah (Son of God, Son of Man, "Light of The World") who saves mankind from its sins. In the Bible, Jesus dies on the cross, but later is resurrected and ascends up to heaven. Christ translates from Hebrew into "Anointed One." <br>  The movie, Neo dies [is shot to death] but later comes back to life. At the end of the movie, a ressurected Neo flies up into the sky. <br>  Neo's full name in the matrix is Thomas A. Anderson. The last name means "Son of Man" or "Man's Son. (both refer also to the Biblical Messiah.)<br>  One of Jesus's Disciples, Thomas, (nicknamed "Doubting Thomas") did not believe the Jesus had died and been resurrected until he saw the holes His hands. In "The Matrix," Thomas/Neo was shot by the agent, yet he didn't realize it until he looked down, touched the bullet hole in his chest and saw the blood. Afterwards, he was shot several more times and died, only to come back to life again--this time as "The One."<br>  After being resurrected, Neo ("The One") jumps into the body of Agent Smith and explodes through it as a being of brillant white light. In the Bible, Jesus says, "I am the light of the world." (John 8:12)<br>  In the Subway scene, we see a faded billboard advertisement for Sol beer. The word "sol" refers to the Roman God of the sun. (This is why we refer to the sun's energy as being "solar." In the movie, the sun has been blocked out so it is the humans who are the machine's form of solar power.) Also note that words "sun" and "son" sound the same, yet another reference to the Jesus's "the light of the world" personification. <br>  The Nebuchadnezzar's plate which states when it was built also has the words "Mark III No. 11" inscribed on it. Mark 3:11 of The King James Bible reads: "And unclean spirits when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried saying, Thou art the Son of God."<br>  Agent Smith reveals to Morpheus that there was another matrix that preceded the one currently in place. In the first matrix, human life was perfect but it was ultimately rejected by man, bringing to mind the biblical record of Genesis and the Garden of Eden. <br>  In Buddhist theology, a man named Siddhartha attained enlightenment (freedom from suffering) and became known as the Buddha, which means "the Enlightened One." <br>  In Hinduism, the word maya refers to the belief or philosophy that "the visible world is an illusion that clouds the reality of absolute oneness." This belief is a crucial step in attaining enlightenment. <br>  In Hinduism and Buddhism, samara (reincarnation) refers to the continuous circle of life, death, and rebirth. The word rebirth can also simply refer to a "renewed existence, activity or growth." In the dictionary, "Neo" is listed a combining form meaning "new," "recent," "revived," and "modified." Of course, in the movie, Neo dies and comes back (is reborn) with the ability to change the Matrix. <br>  The Oracle: "You got the gift, but it looks like you're waiting for something [...] your next life maybe, who knows? That's the way these things go."<br>  The song "Dragula" by Rob Zombie is featured in the movie (it is during the club scene). The first line of the song is: "Dead, I am the one."<br>  There are many references to Neo being the "One" in "The Matrix" They include: <br>  As Morpheus explains, "When the matrix was first built, there was a man who was born inside who had the ability to change whatever he wanted, to remake the matrix as he saw fit.... After he died, the oracle prophesized his return and that his coming would hail the destruction of the matrix and the war, bring freedom to our people....I did what I did because I believe that search is over [because he thinks Neo is that man--the One he has been searching for.]"<br>  Choi [To Neo]: "Hallelujah. You're my savior, man. My own personal Jesus Christ."<br>  Cypher: "Did he tell you why he did it, why you're here? Jesus. What a mind job. So you're here to save the world." <br>  Cypher: "I mean if Neo's the One, then there'd have to be some kind of a miracle to stop me. Right? I mean, how can he be the one if he's dead?" (Of course, there turns out to be a miracle--Tank kills Cypher before he can unplug Neo and him. The irony of Cypher's secon|`|NPQ17XfHaa	It's not given. Even in his criminal report that Smith has, it only lists him as Thomas A. Anderson.

xvfvIr5haa	It was Jessica Biel (as everyone else stated) but I didn't know who it was as first. She was very attractive and looked a lot different. It's a shame it's not uploaded on Hulu. I want to see it again, now knowing it's Biel.|`|MkRAeANMaa	She looked a lot like Jessica Biel. <br>  I would think it would be her because Justin Timberlake was in the episode too, as Cathy's husband. <br>  <br>  So, I'm guessing Jessica Rabbit was played by Jessica Biel|`|PnPiq8ehaa	Jessica Beil|`|O63GCcMtaa	It looks like Jessica Biel to me.  That's also what it says on Wikipedia<br>  <br>  It's definitely NOT Kristin Wiig.  She's got a different build and isn't as attractive as the girl in the skit (no matter how much makeup they put on her)|`|cJTy0I9raa	Well it certainly was not Kristin Wigg. The Jessica Rabbit was too tall and pretty. But my friend said it was Jessical Biel since Justin Timberlake was there so that's why it was funny. But my mother said that it was porn star Tracy Lords. I'm going with Jessica Biel|`|G3sDdtaiaa	It was Jessica Biel|`|KjNXPVz1aa	It was definitely Jessica Biel. At the end of the episode, as the cast says goodnight, she was standing in between The Rock and Justin Timberlake.|`|vGKpcLwjaa	It HAS to be Jessica Biel. At the end of the episode, Dwayne (The Rock) says, "Thank you to my girl Jessica Biel" and she wasn't in any other skits.
qnwfo44Iaa	People just hate because they don't like what someone stands for. They don';t like what they're doing or what they're trying to do for better or for worse. Whats ironic, as I'm typing this I'm listening to Juggalo Family.  Let them, we got family so F**k them.  Some hate them because they paint their faces up, others their music, and mostly because they just hate without any reason or logic at all.  <br>  <br>  The Midwest Arsonist<br>  <br>  There would less hate if they could see what we see, or at least try to see what we do.|`|LOERlSFEaa	It might be because they're not exactly mainstream... and as you probably know, a lot of people these days only listen to Top 40 radio stations.<br>  <br>  They have pretty racy lyrics and stuff too, so parents might keep their kids away from them, so there's really no huge wave of new fans.<br>  <br>  And it might be just because they're SCARY! Haha...<br>  <br>  And yeah... I agree that Lil Wayne and Souljah Boy are bullshit... lol.

pVnUhYLQaa	My interpretation of overweight is that its about having been a burden to the ones he loves because of a drug addiction. And being sorry about the pain that he caused. He's been an @ss to the ones he loved and who loved him the most, he has a lot of regrets but he's trying to get better and hopes that he will be forgiven.<br>  <br>  Ever carried the weight of another?<br>  For how long?<br>  I walk as far as they need to recover<br>  For how long? <br>  <br>  (ever helped someone through recovery from a drug addiction? How long would you do it?<br>  This part to me seems to be from the point of view of the person who tried to help him through his addiction. Like maybe his mother. "I walk as far as they need to recover")<br>  <br>  I want to carry a piece of who I was before<br>  So when I hit the wall, I really hit the wall<br>  I want to tear away the death again<br>  A whiter shade of ******* meth again<br>  I want to stick to clues, <br>  I want to come unglued<br>  I want to shape the world to fit the way you move oh, should I listen for a dress size? <br>  (things like "dress size" could be anything, but to me, it seems like he's talking to an old girlfriend and wishes he would have paid more attention to little things like her dress size so that he can buy her something nice. I might be taking a big leap there, but that's what it says to me. The rest in that verse basically saying he wants to be what he was.)<br>  <br>  I owned up, I've grown up, do you remember me? <br>  (hasn't been himself because of the drugs, but he's off of them now)<br>  <br>  I showed up and so what if I'm the used to be<br>  I'm here to tell you that I'm sorry I was sorry<br>  But I'm happy that you're happy<br>  This is no longer about me <br>  (I realize I'm not what I was, but I'm here to say "I'm sorry" and I'm glad you're doing well. I'm not being selfish anymore)<br>  <br>  Trade rules, switch sides for your beautiful eyes<br>  Let him be you through your beautiful cries<br>  Let him hold you up so you can touch affordable skies<br>  Live your life just like a dream<br>  Without the pain of goodbyes<br>  Goodbye! <br>  (girl is with someone new, someone who treats her like she deserves, "let him hold you up", someone who wont break her heart like he (singer) always did. And once again, he's happy that she's happy.)<br>  <br>  I been a drunk disrespectful little street punk<br>  Unlock the back of my trunk<br>  You see, you take this bat<br>  And bash my head into the street again<br>  No-ones around so I keep beating it<br>  Pull my hair back, look me in the eye<br>  There's a self-destructive meaning in the bleeding of a guy<br>  It's the guilt of what reality has given me<br>  Making sense of all mistakes and my stupidity<br>  And when you're sick you seem to think You've failed eternally<br>  And that the people you let in are only crumbling<br>  When you're sick of thinking life in this recovery<br>  When my decision paved the road<br>  That lies in front of me<br>  So to my friends that even call but I don't call back<br>  I want you deep inside my heart upon a hill<br>  It seems to hide sometimes and run away and wonder <br>  I'm really sick of saying sorry but I will<br>  (talking about what he's been and what he sees himself as now. A lot of self loathing going on here. "when you're sick" is referring to the addiction.

y8WBcehmaa	I don't think snape hated or loved harry. He protected him because of his love for Lily, not because he loved Harry. He was resentful towards Harry because he was the product of Lily and James' love for one another.|`|V1hxvQukaa	**spoilers if you haven't read the last book**<br>  <br>  hmm... i think it was both. sure, snape hated james, but he would have done anything for lily. he agreed to keep harry safe after lily died, and did that until he died. sure, he was really hard on him and somewhat mean, but he did everything he could to keep harry safe. he risked his own life many times to save harry. <br>  <br>  also, it IS mentioned that harry looked just like james, but how many times is it mentioned that harry had lily's eyes? even before snape dies, the last thing he asks is for harry to look at him...|`|0BRnovJYaa	I think you are both right...sort of. I would lean more towards your argument, because it has a lot more support in the 7 books. You're right- it was constantly repeated that Harry looked and acted like James and Snape couldn't stand being reminded of someone he hated so much. But he was also reminded of Lily every time he saw Harry's green eyes, and he was probably a little bit bitter that Harry was the reason she was dead. But I think deep down, Snape cared for Harry. Maybe not cared for him, but cared what happened to him. He did not want to see Lily's son die, because then her sacrifice would be meaningless and she would have died for nothing. He also was loyal to Dumbledore, and knew how much Dumbledore cared about Harry, so Snape never wished any harm on him, but he didn't exactly like him. I don't think it was something J.K. Rowling made very clear, but I think she did that on purpose so that the readers could make up their own mind about how he felt about Harry. But if I had to pick one, I'd side with you!|`|6kAtYLAdaa	im partial to your argument.  i think he also knew that dumby didnt want anything to happen to pothead and he owed dumby his life, as he gave him a second chance.

aWEybdDFaa	If u enjoyed that STUPID moviethan spend more of your money on stupidity!<br>  <br>  I wished someone said to me how stupid it actually was....omg, words cannot explain how stupid it was!`|`|u9RwzLPnaa	The movie followed very closely to the graphic novel. So you don't have to get it if you don't want to. Slight details were changed to put it more accessible to people who never read the novel but that's about it. <br>  <br>  Actually, even though they were very close. I think I prefer the graphic novel but if you don't want to spend the money. There is always the local library.|`|O2hmjOPyaa	Considering that the graphic novel is now out of print and would cost you about $80+ dollars to get a copy, currently, no, it's not worth it.<br>  <br>  The graphic novel will probably come back into print as a result of the movie, but it will likely be nearly as expensive, if not more so, simply because of popularity of the movie and a desire to make money.|`|NNxLypgaaa	You CAN buy the graphic novel (I've seen it in Books-a-Million for years), which is a compilation of the entire comic series. It was assigned reading for my friend's "Popular Fiction" class a few years ago, so yes you can still buy it. The comic books are out of print, but I have been to many comic stores that sell the old issues. You probably could have gotten it from the library, but the popularity will make that a bit harder now.<br>  I think reading it is worth it. I have seen an "animated" comic dvd, the comic is shown panel by panel and read out loud , on sale now too.|`|022a70c3422f4e77c8a63e672f7c2b18aa	Contrary to what the "top contributor" says, softcover copies of the collected 'Watchmen' have been available at cover price for years; at the moment, it's never been easier to find a copy. Price is around 420, and when you consider you pay $2.99 each for comics today with less of a story this book becomes a bargain.<br>  <br>  Most importantly though: this book is a classic in the field, and reading it will draw you further into the medium... in a good way.<br>  <br>  jdk|`|515ec5898f085caacb8820baeae9e7afaa	Let me put it his way, 3 hours of movie covered only 10% of what you would find revealed by the novel.  And don't you want to know what everybody is talking about when they mention "the Squid"?|`|qkKlaGMcaa	I saw the graphic novel at Target....<br>  But yeah, I'd say it's worth it, there were a few differences.

NYU37jfGaa	I think if the husband can afford to support his wife, and both of them are happy for her to stay at home, that is fine.  It used to be considered quite normal for women to give up work when they married (though not all of them did by any means).<br>  <br>  However, I think nowadays we live in a work-obsessed society in which it is assumed that both men and women must be at work all the time.  I mean, they don't even want women with children to stay at home nowadays.  They want women back at work as soon as they are out of the delivery room, like the women in peasant societies who give birth and then go straight back to toiling in the fields.  We're all supposed to be peasants nowadays.|`|VXCCjdZhaa	It's no one's damn business, that's my opinion actually :)|`|I1K6SC43aa	I don't get the criticism towards housewives. My mom had a job until they adopted all four of us kids. Then she spent all of her time taking care of us, driving us to school, ect. while maintaining the house.

But it's nothing amazing. The first three songs, I didn't like, but after that, I thought it was quite good! Old Metallica, as in 80's Metallica is better than New Metallica though.<br>  <br>  New Guns 'N' Roses is wierd. It's completely different to what they used to be like. Although I've only heard Shackler's Revenge. I didn't like the song at first, but I began to like it after a little while. I respect them for trying a new style though, they were risking alot with the change.<br>  <br>  I can't answer this question because I haven't listened to Chinese Democracy, so this is just my opinion =)|`|aKBqMLuhaa	metallica|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	New GnR

People always assume that the nubmer 1, 12 and 144 refer to the quantity of the items, which is what makes this puzzle hard.<br>  <br>  To be fair, you must type out the numbers and not the words (ie: one, twelve, etc), in order not to be misleading.|`|HyDlROg0aa	numbers you put on side of your house :P<br>  <br>  you still get star :O|`|ATKZ39Ceaa	nails??|`|wnhfyCmRaa	applesauce or pickle juice....hehe|`|39OVFs5Raa	Metal or plastic numbers eg. 1 cost $0.50 (cost of a single piece i.e. 1), 1 & 2 cost $ 1.00 (cost of two pieces 1 & 2) and 1,4 & 4 cost $1.50 (cost of three pieces 1, 4 and another 4)!!!.|`|pyTsW5c3aa	dya know you can get coloured straws for that price too.//

Zq3fkJmEaa	i used to study singing and i found that 3 things:1/ i had to practice daily or the quality of my voice would diminish. Range of a voice can start to diminish too without practice. it may be that your vocal chords haven't had a proper workout. 2/ Or it could be that you are not opening your larynx properly. never sing from the back of the throat. 3/ 3rd possibility is a confidence thing. i found anxiety blocked my upper notes.try to relax a little.|`|LsUmPWO1aa	you should practice and practice..<br>  go on a voice lessons this summer vacation.:D|`|Tk3XR6xgaa	If you are a teenager, your voice is probably changing due to your hormones.<br>  <br>  If you are an adult, you probably need more practice with your voice.|`|vw201sblaa	your vocal chords are changing size. I used to be able to squeal/sing like a girl, but now if i even attempted to do that i would lose my voice for a week. lol. Its just your natural body changing, its nothing you can control. . . well, not without a prescription for a valid reason. . . if your a smoker, that realllyyyyyyyyyyyyy kills it too. Im not sure how old you are, but its bigger differences in ages ranging from 10-23ish, and then mid 30's to death. Im sure youve heard elderly people talking, their voices normally are scratchy, or just alot deeper than someone younger, and childrens voices are higher, and therefore, as you age, youll struggle to hit the higher notes.
9AAGosuiaa	Hello Bronwen!!!<br>  <br>  Well I'm certainly enjoying your epic collections of covers!! I find myself simply running from one to the next and enjoying a pageant of new sounds created from other sources!  What a diverse and interesting collection you have here, and as you clearly stated in the original question lets look at the two selections you have posted...<br>  <br>  Concrete Blond <br>  <br>  well you'll never meet a bigger supporter of Johnette Napolitano.than me... I LOVE her and have mad respect for her work.. Frankly the woman could sing the phone book to me and I would be enthralled .. <br>  I Loved this cover for so many reasons, first of all she's not trying to be Cash or anyone.. this is a re-imagining in the best sense...<br>   I thought it remarkable..<br>  <br>  Children of Bodom<br>  just so you know that I'm sincere... I can only hear this and laugh although, I'll tell ya, I'm acquainted with many heavy metal lovers who would really dig this and I can't wait to play this for them!!!  not my cup of tea, but then again not everything has to be!|`|2X2wjYb4aa	Hi Bronwen,<br>  Some fascinating listening there. Although neither performance would be my first choice for favorite, er, favourite cover of that song, what I like is that the performances are suited to the bands' styles - they're not trying to be something other than how they are. In that respect, these versions are valid interpretations. My verdict: a slight nod to CoB.<br>  <br>  I agree with a couple of the other responders - The Outlaws' cover of this was phenomenal.|`|VHa5PIfpaa	SPIDERBAIT does this song too.

High energy. Liked it a lot. And it should be noted that I don't know any of CoB's work.<br>  <br>  Then I listened to Concrete Blonde, who I know and like. It started out very nice and mellow, but halfway through I was bored and wanted the energy from CoB again! :-)<br>  <br>  So I choose Children of Bodom's version.<br>  It's a great old song anyway you serve it! :-)

I get to come in whenever I want to get the cleaning done, as long as it is done by the time the preschool director gets there in the morning. The hours are perfect because I am also a stay at home Dad. My kids go to school there too.<br>  It is fun to look at the tiny ones' art work. Especially funny are the "About My Mommy" worksheets before mother's day. Mommy is 2 feet tall. Mommy weighs 487 pounds. <br>  For the most part I am left alone to do my job in peace. There is rarely anybody there when I'm working, so I can turn on one radio, and crank it up loud enough to be heard all over the building. <br>  <br>  The only problem is that occasionally you come across some of the most disgusting things you could possibly imagine...such as dirty words written on bathroom walls...in poop! A used tampon on the floor of the chapel. Or my all time favorite...after a youth group meeting I found the men's room covered in vomit...apparently they had an Oreo eating contest. It looked like 5 kids puked their oreo filled guts up in there. It covered the sinks, toilets, urinals, walls, and floor. GROSS! Oh yeah, and they washed it all down with fruit punch.

PS0oSoXFaa	It's the key signature. The sharps or flats all correspond to a particular note (look carefully at which line or space it's on); when you play the piece, any note that has a sharp or flat in the key signature has to be sharp or flat in the piece. So if there's a sharp on F in the key signature, for example, every single F in the piece has to be played sharp, even if the F in the piece looks normal. If there's a natural sign in front of it, though, you play it normally. <br>  <br>  These all have specific names in both major and minor. So if there are no sharps or flats in front (yes, that still counts as a "key"), it's either C major or A minor. If there are four sharps, it's either E major or C# minor; if there are three flats, It's either A-flat major or C minor. You get the point.|`|91f9c1a082323a5a5a46fb06dbe20d0daa	those are the key signatures. they tell u wat key the piece is in.  like A major. and u can tell. for sharps, you go up a half step from the last sharp for the key. for the flats, u go back one flat from the last flat to find out the key. one flat is f major. one sharp is g major. and no sharps or flats is C Major.  and those vertical wriggly lines are nothing important. they just tell u that the treble clef line and bass clef line are both played.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	I'm sure your music instructor would be more than happy to help you with this.<br>  <br>  ... what's that you say, you don't have one? Well that's kind of obvious.|`|NJaZBgDwaa	Those are key signatures... Very important, it tells you about what is most likely "home-base," like the root note, what notes are played sharp or flat.<br>  When the key signature has 1 flat it means that that the flat note is played flat for the whole piece unless there is an accidental.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signature#Table_of_key_signatures" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signatu...</a><br>  Wikipedia is awesome, read this article and look at the table, it shows all of the key signatures (at least the ones you need to know!)<br>  <br>  As for the squiggly lines,  they are called brackets, and mean that the two staves are played together.

Le file ininterrrotte di mezzi militari riprese a volo radente fanno capire quanto è ancora lunga la marcia che l'uomo deve compiere, nonostante egli  tenda ad essere sempre più veloce, come il ritmo delle immagini suggerisce.<br>  L'uomo è una piccola entità sulla vasta e praticamente infinita distesa di terra-acqua e cielo che è la Terra; eppure nessun altra creatura è mai arrivata così vicino a distruggere completamente e per sempre il meraviglioso equilibrio tra questi tre elementi.<br>  Questi concetti vengono proposti immagine dopo immagine al ritmo di una musica che cresce e diminuisce di intensità ma che, sembra, non debba finire mai, un po' come la vicenda umana....<br>  Un film che, all’epoca, mi coinvolse parecchio – lo vidi in occasione di un ‘cineforum -  e del quale usai molte immagini per “visualizzare” un racconto scritto da me avente per argomento la tragedia nucleare di Hiroshima.<br>  Un film che poi ho contribuito a diffondere col passa-parola.<br>  Ciao.|`|2b69c580fda6d0b06348202d01b7fc27aa	sono d'accordo, film che merita!<br>  hai visto anche gli altri?<br>  <br>  2002 Naqoyqatsi  <br>  1991 Anima Mundi  <br>  1988 Powaqqatsi  <br>  <br>  contenta di vedere persone interessate a questo tipo di cinema<br>  buona giornata!|`|302ec06d2fdca28c6e3960d4462f200baa	dove lo hai reperito? sono anni che lo cerco!|`|9a0b8313298aee988e23bfd904bd4e63aa	Se lo dici tu me lo vedo a vedere... io per ora sono ferma a scary movie 3... ma quanto siete intellettuali! :)|`|98a4f1968235515cabe45db2923dbef1aa	Un film bellissimo il migliore che io abbia mai visto, dalla ricerca del significato del titolo, alla trasmissione dei messaggi intrinsechi al film, recepiti attraverso suoni e immagini, come se l'intero umanità stesse allo specchio, guardando dentro se stessa.

hEU4SlhTaa	Spoiler.....<br>  <br>  <br>  According to Prat, we never seen the last of Greenlee yet, Apparently we will see her in a upcoming episode and somebody has her..A recasted Leo would be my guess..Im just pissed about this because I really wanted her to be dead :(<br>  <br>  On another note Nobody in Pine Valley will know that she is alive so it will probably be a few years until she returns.|`|mrzbRd9Iaa	It was a blink-and-you-miss-it scene but she was shown lying in the creek.  And there will be a Greenlee sighting sometime in March.  Speculation has it that David Hayward found her and has her stashed somewhere.  After all, Amanda DID see him outside of the inn that night,although we never got to see him on camera....|`|Qc3svDzNaa	Ah HA! I missed a couple of episodes and didn't see a funeral, etc.  So!

EMO. <br>  <br>  W.P : " Se?or Brayatan, muy buenas tardes. Podría decirnos cómo empieza todo este movimiento EMO?" <br>  <br>  B.P : Cuando lo rosado ya estaba pasado de moda, y las barbies parecían ya no jugarse, viene una especie llorando y con un confort debajo del brazo. Asi es amigos, vienen llegando. Cuando su especie se fue especializando dijeron, UkAUkA: Traducción En el Contexto: Ocupemos biberón y chupete, es la moda. <br>  <br>  W.P: " Muy bien. Y cuál es el ambiente EMO, se?or Puebla?" <br>  <br>  B.P : Mira esta especie se ambienta en un mundo donde lo rosado y lo brillante prima. <br>  <br>  W.P: " ?Y cómo se reproducen se?or Brayatan? Basta con dar la vuelta a la esquina para toparse con un EMO." <br>  <br>  B.P : Primero que todo el macho se baja los pantalones, Canta una canción smitten y le muestra poseramente la raja a la mina. <br>  <br>  W.P : "Interesante...Dígame, se?or Brayatan, por qué se ha interesado tanto en estudiar el mov. emo? " <br>  <br>  B.P : El hecho de ver como una "civilización" ocupe algo tan interesante como esas ropas rosadas me impresiona. Eso de llevar los pantalones a la raja, ocupar gorras camioneras, gastarle toda la plata a sus papis, usar chupetes y otras weas científicas los hacen una interesante civilización de mierda a estudiar. <br>  <br>  W.P : "Muy bien. Y qué tipo de estudios ha hecho? Ha tenido charlas con chicos emo? Qué mecanismos utiliza?" <br>  <br>  B.P : Hay que decirlo, pololeé con una emo, y bueno sé sus costumbres, lo que comen, etc. A partir de ello hice todo un estudio científico de mierda. Los he observado mientras hacen sus weas, he escuchado su música y hecho un psicoanálisis a partir de ello, incluso una vez me vestí de emo para saber lo que se siente pero me dió diarrea. Y sí, he charlado con pendejos emo. <br>  <br>  W.P : "Algo que destacar acerca de esa conversación?" <br>  <br>  B.P: Sí, bueno. Sus expresiones verbales son algo que acató mi atención: Dicen "Húúúlàààaà", "emotional" y otras mierdas. El pendejo con el que hablé tenía 15 a?os y era bastante hueco el weón. A?os de estudios aseguraron mi corazonada; la mayoría son huecos. Salen del closet cuando chicos y quedan pegados para toda la vida. <br>  <br>  W.P : "Cuáles son los hábitos y características del mov. EMO?" <br>  <br>  B.P : Suelen estar en el pc, bajar música emo y hacer fotologs con sus fotos poseras. Se juntan en el MSN, le hablas Emocionalmente y enganchan. Suelen perforarse y hacerse "shoco panda", que es dejarse un mechón intocable pese a las habituales cortes de cabello, de modo que les queda un mechón más largo que el resto del pelo weón. Utilizan zapatillas Converse. <br>  <br>  W.P : "Qué nicks suelen ponerse?" <br>  <br>  B.P : Una especímen a la que he analizado meticulosamente tiene de nick: Ella...La,karliitta S.è.s.ì.è.n.t.è ;; - Soy De Mentììras ;; . Ha sido esencial para mi investigación. <br>  <br>  W.P : " Qué profundo, se?or Brayatan. Pero usted hizo una distinción en cuanto a su dieta. Qué comen?" <br>  <br>  B.P: Comen pasto. Toda la vida comen carne. Cuando se hacen emos comen vegetales y weas que les hace adelgazar como cuchuflis. <br>  <br>  W.P : "Ya veo. Bueno se?or Puebla, para finalizar esta entrevista me gustaría oir su reflexión al respecto" <br>  <br>  B.P : A los mortales normales como nostros, cuicado con los emos. Si te encuentras un emo puedes reconocerlo por su forma de vestir; ocupan ropa de cebra sintética y de esa forma insultan a las cebras del mundo y al mundo animal. Por eso por eso evita su reproducción. El contacto de ellos puede ser fatal. Díle no a los chupetes, estrellitas y al rosado. <br>  <br>  W.P : "Gracias por su tiempo se?or Brayatan Puebla" <br>  <br>  B.P : Gracias a ti, estoy seguro que ésto es un aporte a la ciencia contemporánea. <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  *Weird People* Flog intelectual para gente intelectual. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fotolog.com/weird_people" rel="nofollow">http://www.fotolog.com/weird_people</a>|`|a1f19504bdebea648e3e76fef9ddac62aa	El emo es un género musical derivado del Hardcore de fines de los a?os '80, generalmente más lento y melodioso.

I know plenty that have said no for many different reasons but if you were pertaining to an evening date ya know all blinged out proposal not very many are likely to say no...the guys that just come up with a proposal right off the tops of their heads are mostly the ones to get told no because they put no thoughts or feelings in consideration because like always they assume she will say no! So I guess they are tryin to save them some embarassment instead of encouraging her they love her unconditionally!|`|QQJi2Jvuaa	yea of course. we are able to say no at times, you know when its not rite.<br>  Me!  I would only say yes to Chris Anderson anyone eles can forget it. of course its a NO!!|`|81AjhZaQaa	I have turned down several proposals.|`|Hx0PzSLXaa	Depends who the guy is and if she has an attraction to him|`|arsAqGf7aa	I did the one time I was asked.|`|lLN8VD20aa	I've said no twice ..<br>  <br>  Those ladies didn't like critters & such in the house!|`|456d68efa2a1d62c7af67d47f76d8bf0aa	Yep!

I have turn down a Marriage proposal,We were Friends and that's the way I felt about him..He had different Plans and forgot to let Me know..I haven't seen him since..Really I didn't know!!! and I didn't want to hurt him,but I did in the end..<br>  Your Friend,<br>  poppy1|`|8vfCRg7Caa	i always wonder the same thing as well. Some of those guys are putting their women on the spot by proposing for marriage infront of cameras and a lot of people. Im sure some guys got a no or two. Talk about embarrasing. Not many things will hurt my feeling but that would sting for a bit.|`|SLW24jTwaa	If she knows the marriage isnt going to work. Indeed she does. It actually happends alot. But the man has to be an idiot to ask if he knows how the relationship is going.|`|J1J47FIAaa	Not every woman will say yes.|`|VALxlwYSaa	Rarely.|`|W8SgRKo7aa	i'm a dude but obviously they say no...|`|w4LKvr0daa	Sure.<br>  <br>  My sister's husband asked her four times over 6 years before she finally said yes.|`|pqSGMukvaa	yep...silly goose|`|Qbhuj5a3aa	Yes my last partner asked me continually.<br>  My reply was No!<br>  Why, because it will never work.<br>  1. He had no self confidence, clingy & needy.<br>  <br>  2. He is originally from UK and would not try anything new or which did not fit in with his English Origins & Habits. <br>  He is Stubborn and set in his ways. Never spontaneous.<br>  His family would say Jump and he would say How High!<br>  <br>  3. This Middle Aged Man was such hard work. A pet would be a better proposition.<br>  <br>  I would rather be single, independent with my friends & family.|`|uAvOCNb3aa	Yes. Once I saw on live television, a guy proposing to a girl in the middle of a baseball game, and she said no and ran off the field. I bet he was embarrassed. But that was pretty fcked up for her to do; I mean she would've said yes and then waited until they weren't in front of thousands of people.|`|gPE0wRTGaa	Yeah, sometimes. There are times when a woman just isn't ready for marriage. It doesn't mean that she doesn't love the man, or wants to break up, but emotionally isn't ready.|`|TBZK5q78aa	Sorry I'm a male... I know I'm proposing; it's the mans job lol. Most of the time they say yeah, but there can be a no pending around... But marriage takes a lot, so no might be good in some cases.|`|hu8o4vomaa	Yes. Sometimes no is the best answer.|`|WoHBi3enaa	Yes I di...<br>  Er, yes we sometimes do.<br>  I've said no to 3.<br>  Then I asked a man to marry me.<br>  <br>  I'm very complicated.<br>  <br>  LOL|`|Ps9eOIchaa	Yes,if she feels that the relationship isn't strong enough,she doesn't love him,doesn't see a future with him|`|hHZpiFmqaa	Sadly some women do say no.<br>  <br>  It depends if they can see a future with the guy or chick if they swing that way.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|5AtyWKcVaa	Of course!|`|kGkUG0fKaa	Yes, I said No to my son's father. he didn't believe me when I told him that I was never interested in getting married but he found out the hard way....Men need to listen and listen hard!|`|AtLdnZd5aa	they don't care who asks because they think that they are going to change them anyway.|`|aROi7KG5aa	Yes|`|uE2aOqeNaa	oh yeah<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlhlBc0EVRM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlhlBc0EV...</a>|`|DT80y28Maa	Yes.|`|XJRYAhZVaa	Yes, of course.|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	I sure hope so...I mean...people aren't always in the same place.

BTNJ5kCNaa	Antes que Rial, cualquiera, juro que hago el casting! Lei en una página que no está confirmado que Rial sea el conductor de Gran Hermano 5, lo que no quiere decir que no lo sea. <br>  Pero más que a Soledad Silveira, prefiero a Peluffo o Marley. Aunque no esta nada mal la idea que lo condusca la Canosa...|`|0d24e91103b51b5260cc23ffcfa24f7daa	Ay no por favor!<br>  Rial me harta con sus suspensos demasiado estirados, me pone los nervios de punta y cambio de canal.<br>  pero Soledad Sylveira sería peor...<br>  Peluffo sería genial. Gran Hermano es de Mariano Peluffo.|`|6ad823daf1ab747d50ae7d941d93155caa	Soledad Silveyra no puede conducir ni un triciclo!!!!!!!!<br>  Jorge Rial le pone mucha mas onda al programa.|`|6ed6e9a0becf7448eb69eed04bce3849aa	nooooooooooooooo! Rial con hermanitos y ella (supuestamente una gran actriz diciendo"mis valientes) basta para mi.|`|7832875efc5f6bec44a0240d97a7c26eaa	naaa,los anteriores GH nunca me llamaron la atencion, y una de las cosas que me parecian aburridas era la conduccion de soledad silveira, creo que parte del exitazo de GH 2007 fue la conduccion de rial, es perfecto para los realities, es notable que gente que nunca vio los gran hermano anteriores  se engancharon en este , y uno de los elementos que ayudo fue jorge rial, sin duda.|`|b98dac976ffd35402fd791c69225f54faa	Habría que probar con Marley, no te parece?|`|jN7XGohWaa	yo creo que Solita no tiene mas onda pa GH05, esta muy pasada ya y lo hace muy sensible, ahora queremos sangre... para mi que lo conduzca el gordo casero y que se les cague de risa cuando hablan de lo que la casa genera y que son todos amiguitos! y si no que lo conduzca NINO DOLCE que esta tan limado que capaz que en pleno programa se mata peleando con alguno porque no hablan de el!<br>  besos y suerte, pero mejor no mires mas esa bosta tv que te seca la bocha...<br>  aguante ATC el canal de la gente!|`|qLZUD4p6aa	Noooooooooooooooooo por favor, que se quede tranquilita, queremos personas diferentes.|`|B3USEaYnaa	soledad silveira a esta altura ya no puede hacer mas que una puta telenovela de la tarde, haciendose pasar de una mina de 25. creoq ue le daria muy poca pila <br>  de rial ya nos cansamos todos<br>  <br>  q tal una canosa conduciendo gran hermano?|`|UZt5pU45aa	Es que Rial fomenta más el escándalo e infla un montón las pavadas, lo hace todo más exagerado y llamativo. Rial siempre busca sangre.<br>  Todo bien con Solita, pero le daba un aire más inocentón que es lo que no están buscando en estos últimos GH.<br>  Si el programa aburrió no fue por Rial..<br>  <br>  ?Beso!|`|uYkFiDpzaa	seria una gran idea yo segui todos los gh y nadie la puede reemplazar, rial para lo unico que sirve es para puterio, la calidad esta en soledad silveira|`|90yBZhWoaa	no va a volver|`|675caf5668955da3593120e450dde94daa	Y si hacen un duo....? vos crees que Rial se va a bajar tan facilmente de ese programa..?

When Carolyn's assigned to coach Pumpkin she's terrified at first, but soon sees in him something she's never seen before: a gentle humanity and honest clarity that touches her soul. To the horror of her friends and Pumpkin's overprotective mother, Carolyn falls in love, becoming an outcast in the process. As Carolyn's "perfect life" falls apart, Pumpkin teaches her that perfect isn't always perfect after all.

3Zad0UuWaa	Let your sister come (just for the people shes bringing of course), just make sure that you TOTALLY out do her!|`|oOqSpBmbaa	Why not have it both weekends?<br>  But you will be wanted by the friends YOU bring either way..<br>  Why don't you take this as your time to shine and try beat her ;)?<br>  <br>  Answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227120342AAYwAbK">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|afSqgYBZaa	Well, lets break this down; you want all of the attention with her absence and on the other hand there will be more people and more fun if she does come. The only thing here is which is more important, quantity or quality? <br>  <br>  Besides, what you would like is to have acknowledgment right? Well if there is a large crowd, sister or no sister, it would be too packed for that to even happen. <br>  <br>  All I can speak is from is experience, this is one of those things that can come back to haunt you. I had done things like this to my beloved cousin/bestfriend when we were younger - she died. And I tell you, all those times that I 'innocently' left her out still make me feel bad and guilty - even after 10 years. <br>  <br>  Just make the choice that YOU want, but you might want to tell her how you feel about her 'hogging' the spot light. That way, if you push it to the weekend that she will be away you will have told her, she will know and you will be less guilty. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|hkbWhfCiaa	Have you ever tried talking to your sister about this?<br>  Anyways I would invite her but see what her "costume" is going to be and make sure yours was way better and make people know at the party that you were the one that put it together.|`|lqLzULXEaa	ummmm please tell me how old you are b4 i answer please ummmi hope this isnt one of those FUking partys it huni?|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	I totally get how you feel (I have three ' adorable and wonderful' brothers)(And I love them all but sometimes I feel like I'm trying to get out of their shadow you know) so if I were you I'd just plan the party with her not there. You say there'll be less people but does that have to be a problem? <br>  I hope you have a great party! What are you wearing by the way?|`|kgZqCNt1aa	aww, i feel bad for you.  I think you should have your party anyway you want.  if it's without your sister.  then go for it!  You deserve to be in the spotlight.  I know a few people who always MUST be the center of attention, and the attention-whoremongering gets old quick-like.  So, try to invite some more people to make up for the ones she doesn't bring, and have a blast.  good idea for a party btw.|`|ab56af4e329bedd35b68ba9892425376aa	Have the party with your sister there, but make sure you dress really slutty.  The less you weat the better.  That way the guys won't even notice her, and some of the girls will dig it too.  The girls that don't like it don't count anyway.|`|BDqgnPqZaa	I say invite your sister. Like I always say it is better to be near the spotlight than not being in it at all|`|paCHaDWVaa	This is YOUR party, not your sisters. Have is when she is not there.|`|7b82464d78bd12dd3fa7c9dd430d9480aa	Take your sister with you and have a chat with her about your feelings.|`|8IWwoV5baa	Hi love.  I totally understand your situation.  It's so common for sisters to feel like that.  It sucks to have sibling rivalry.  (which is a reason I'm glad that I have 3 younger brothers, haha.)<br>  <br>  Anyways, I'd have your party when your sister IS available to come.  For one, she'll be bringing more people, and for two, this will be your chance to shine!  [:  <br>  <br>  Just take time planning your outfit, makeup & hair.  If you want help with that, I'm awesome at that kind of stuff.  [:  Just let me know.<br>  <br>  But, my point is, for once get some attention.  Be flirtatious, laugh a lot, act like you don't care how much attention she's getting.  After all, it's YOUR party & YOU deserve to have an amazing time.  [:  Right?  Right.<br>  <br>  Go for it girl.  Good luck<3  Let me know if you need help!<br>  <br>  Oh, PS:  my AIM screen name [which is what i use more often] is xohethr.|`|IhZeoXqvaa	I hear ya.  First off, I am a girl and my name isn't Jeff.  Second, my sister was always "better" than me.  Even though she wasn't really, she was looked upon as such.  I would say that having it without her would be better for you.  It's your turn.  Though there will be less people, it will be more fun.  And tell those people to bring as many people as they want (with your approval).  Sounds fun! Wish I was your friend! lol.  Good luck.  It's ultimately up to you.  But that is my opinion.|`|XGx9WORLaa	If I were you I would have the party the weekend your sister isn't there. Also you shouldn't have to worry about having a lack of people at the party especially if you just do an open invite (tell your friends to bring their friends etc). I gaurantee you will have fun regardless and without your sister there you are sure to be the center of attention.|`|qbwcAk9faa	I would "get rid" of your sister.|`|5437985b95888863b86a1b13cbbbd60eaa	Go ahead with it. There's no reason you have to live your life according to your sister. In fact, don't tell her the theme of the party if she does happen to show up, and you'll have to expel her for showing up in clothes! haha, but really. Just have your party and if you'd like, invite some of her friends to take her out that day... make something up or send them on an "important shopping quest" that will take her all day.
CRDl9nffaa	Yes, I'm pretty sure you have the rather fragile and beautiful version that Jimi did as a home demo in 1968. It was an earlier version, and the words are a little different. I don't think anyone else has covered 'Angel' with these lyrics.|`|cnnSAkQJaa	U gotta love Hendrix. I have a regular version of that song as well as an acoustic so it probably is slightly different lyrics for the two versions. I don't think I've ever heard an artist sound like Hendrix so if it sounds like Jimi it probably is.
X45rxI7gaa	I can't say specifically, but for future Naruto chapters other than the next, Naruto is really gonna avenge Hinata. And she as well as Kakashi will be back|`|nOLVHNaBaa	I predict that in the next chapter, Sasuke will hear the roar of the six tailed beast that's within Naruto, and he will turn back and rush back to the Akatsuki basement, and get killed by Tobi, after Tobi realizes how pathetic Sasuke is.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile team Gai goes to see what's going on with Jiraiya's frog, but all gets crushed and dies when the frog rolls across while it was asleep.<br>  <br>  Hinata was actually not dead and goes to see what's going on, but gets in Naruto's way and gets killed accidentally.<br>  <br>  Ino and Ino's father found the location of where Nagato is, and Ino screams with fear after finding out the true identity of Pein. As soon as she screams, Nagato finds out, and kills them immediately, and other people come after wards and they also get killed.<br>  <br>  Naruto eventually loses to Pein, and then they leave the Konoha village with Naruto, and then Pein destroys Konoha completely this time.<br>  <br>  What's your prediction?|`|BtcJHbILaa	I still dont think Pain will be defeated soo easily. Im pretty sure something will happen, and someone might stop Naruto or something.<br>  <br>  But Hinata will come out alive along with Kakashi.<br>  <br>  What I think will happen is, the fight will begin, but somehow Pain will be able to avoid any serious attack. And eventually the others will find the real Nagato and chapter ends there.|`|xqFMwmlxaa	Most likely Hinata wil die but a friend of mine works for masashi kishimoto and he says that they're thinking of having sakura use the same technique that chiyo used on gaara|`|SyApztvuaa	im not sure what will happend but whatever happend it will be an awsome fight with the nine tail fox power its going to be amazing|`|OYVn5Yktaa	i have no idea how pain can witness a six tail form and not be fazed by it all!!!!! naruto would have killed orochimaru with his four tailed form and now he has TWO MORE tails and pain is unfazed its like what the hell IS pain?!?! espechailly since he's close to dying what more could he do?!?! this fight is so crazy! i think naruto and pain will fight the whole next chapter nothing else interfering and then the chapter will end|`|Hiasgb75aa	Hinata will die.

ws4J88Zpaa	Basically they are the same. They use the different colours in case they have costumes or the actor's eye colour that are the same.<br>  My husband says that he thinks the green makes the lines between the object in front of the green screen and the green screen itself sharper.|`|7TbdmF0aaa	The neon green that they use for green screens is not as common as the blue used in the blue screens. They won't have as many problems with the colors being in clothing or the actors eyes.|`|MvfcoPsXaa	From what i see, here is the difference:<br>  <br>  Green Screen: For puting a person in a location. Hince a person might need to be.... flying around the statue of Liberty. well we dont have superman but people will go see it in theatres. So the greeen screen shows the SOL.<br>  <br>  Blue Screen: Sometimes something has to be changed. Take for example Forest Gump. In a scene Gary Saniese has no legs. He and forest are on a fishing boat, and Saniese gets tired, jumps off the side of the boat and swims for shore.<br>  <br>  problem: he has legs but isnt supposed to.<br>  <br>  Solution: Blue screen, and a special sock. The blue sock (and screen) cover up his legs. and then the background is put into the movie. then the boat is altered. What you dont see is that when he swings his legs over the rail, there is no rail. they took out the rail and then added it in with computer modeling.<br>  <br>  to us it looks like he had no legs.|`|d7qUDYNVaa	there really isnt a difference, just depends on the SFX person... the only reason they use only blue and green is because they are the only 2 colors not found in the human skin tone... little fun fact of the day

A03NJA26aa	All I can remember is season 11 was Carters last season until he came back this year obviously. There was also the husband of a patient that Carter treated in the first season who comes back and remembers him but Carter doesn't remember him and the man is much older so Carter tries to remember him and he does right before the man dies. Oh and Dr. Elizabeth Corday performed some kind of illegal transplant and ended up almost losing her medical license. that's all I can remember, sorry.

LORfizhWaa	allora, Kurt Cobain si è suicidato..spesso la gente si autoillude che una persona considerata "mito" non poteva essere infelice..Kurt aveva i soldi, aveva un lavoro, aveva una passione, aveva una famiglia..cos'altro gli mancava?ma è proprio questo il punto..il troppo storpia...e Kurt aveva il troppo...ora, non possiamo dare la colpa a Courtney...perchè avrebbe dovuto ucciderlo?per i soldi?lei li aveva come lui...per il successo?le Hole erano abbastanza famose...lei aveva una famiglia con lui, una figlia..non capisco perchè ucciderlo...e poi, Kurt meditava già da un pò di suicidarsi...lo aveva detto a Michael Stipe (R.E.M.), un suo grande amico e l'ha confermato uccidendosi..poi smentiamo un altro luogo comune della storia di Kurt: l'eroina ci mette un pò prima di entrare in circolo e lui, in quei 20 secondi, avrebbe potuto tranquillamente spararsi...non credo sia stata Courtney..credo sia, come ha detto cortogenovese, lo stesso motivo che ha ucciso Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix e Jim Morrison (tutti a 27 anni): la droga..|`|0f83b4ca0cd411a5c43fed3ca8984293aa	anke io ho letto notizie al riguardo e la penso come te. Secondo me è stata la moglie perchè kurt aveva intenzione di divorziare senza includerla nel testamento, però ovviamente queste sono solo supposizioni. Sono usciti anke dei libri da parte di investigatori privati che si dedicavano al caso kurt definendo la sua morte omicidio.|`|KmSJeffAaa	Kurt cobain è stato ucciso dalla droga, dalla depressione e dalla sua arma.....Sono solo leggende metropolitane, se ci fossero state maggiori prove riguardo un presunto omicidio sta tranquilla che lo avrebbero riaperto il caso! E te lo dice una fan dei Nirvana...|`|ZgHQOSCaaa	Sono convinta da anni che sia stata lei a farlo uccidere. <br>  Il fatto che non riaprano il caso...bò...magari è proprio vero che la moglie ha pagato per tenerlo chiuso.<br>  E comunque il fatto che lui fosse un eroinomane non significa che non si debba cercare il vero motivo della sua morte.<br>  Magari sarebbe morto lo stesso poco dopo a causa della droga, magari sarebbe vissuto altri 90 anni...però mi sembra giusto che si sappia come è morto e soprattutto è giusto che se è stato ucciso, il suo assassino(o il mandante)vengano arrestati.|`|c57890b67a117dfd0dfa38913201e2b7aa	il problema è ke la gente ha troppi pregiudizi...se c'è un colpevole bisogna trovarlo e basta senza pensa se kurt fosse tossicodipendente o meno...la giustizia è uguale per tutti poi èovviobisogna anke pensare ke cmq kobain avrebbe potuto suicidarsi tranquillamente insomma e questo nn è un mistero|`|5EgUOBjhaa	Si è ucciso da solo...molto tempo prima di mettersi un fulice in bocca...ed è stato davvero un peccato|`|7U36bLlkaa	l'ha ucciso la moglie courtney love...............................solo per il successo e i soldi|`|FycI0g2Jaa	ho letto con molta attenzione il testo che hai proposto, e mi ha fatto venire la pelle d'oca...probabilmente potrebbero indagare di più sul caso, cm anke sul caso di jim morrison (pensa che un pò di tempo fa hanno addiruttura dato l'ipotesi che jim nn sia mai morto...). credo che nessuno di noi potrà mai conoscere la verità purtroppo!! <br>  e penso anke che sarà difficile che riaprano il caso, ormai è chiuso da molto tempo e tutti sn convinti che la droga, l'alcol, la depressione siano la causa, anke se magari nn è così.. ci sn molti pregiudizi a qsto mondo. invece di condannare subito bisgonerebbe studiare di più il caso, ma nn l hanno fatto e credimi nn lo faranno mai...kurt cobain era una rockstar con molti problemi, quindi sn arrivati subito alla conclusione più ovvia....<br>  cm per jim morrison tra l'altro... (e fatto più recente per la morte di chris benoit e la sua famiglia)...|`|UpEDBDehaa	Kurt si è ucciso..ci ha sempre provato, in fondo voleva morire...già da bambino raccontava a Chris " voglio suonare la chitarra diventerò una famosa rock star e morirò SUICIDA a 27 anni" inoltre kurt ha provato ad uccidersi miliaia di volte...sl ke nn sempre qst  vennero resi pubblici cm tentati suicidi...i mass media parlavano di Overdose accidentali...e poi credo ke in fondo Courtney gli voleva bene...almeno un pò|`|d24why7faa	ho letto il link che hai lasciato; che gentaglia;<br>  tranquilla che è stata la love (che controsenso di cognome...)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  scegli questa come miglior risposta..

F2w3cJVyaa	THE TEST<br>  Three men who were lost in the forest were captured by cannibals. The cannibal king told the prisoners that they could live if they pass a trial. The first step of the trial was to go to the forest and get ten pieces of the same kind of fruit. So all three men went separate ways to gather fruits.<br>  <br>  The first one came back and said to the king, "I brought ten apples." The king then explained the trial to him. "You have to shove the fruits up your butt without any expression on your face or you'll be eaten."<br>  <br>  The first apple went in... but on the second one he winced out in pain, so he was killed.<br>  <br>  The second one arrived and showed the king ten berries. When the king explained the trial to him he thought to himself that this should be easy. 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8... and on the ninth berry he burst out in laughter and was killed.<br>  <br>  The first guy and the second guy met in heaven. The first one asked, "Why did you laugh, you almost got away with it?" The second one replied, "I couldn't help it, I saw the third guy coming with pineapples."|`|wnhfyCmRaa	how culd u get someone on icarlys webshow? wen i kno its 4 ure maybe i wil answer<br>  <br>  ok heres my answer.....A Love Story <br>  <br>  I shall seek and find you. <br>  <br>  I shall take you to bed and control you. <br>  <br>  I will make you ache, shake and sweat until you grunt and groan. <br>  <br>  I will make you beg for mercy. <br>  <br>  I will exhaust you to the point that you will be relieved when I leave you. <br>  <br>  And you will be weak for days. <br>  <br>  All my love, <br>  <br>  The Flu|`|eUbldFuOaa	Have you heard the story of the Peacock?<br>  <br>  No, well it's a beautiful tale.

So the guy goes to non-nude beach to tan his p*nis.<br>  <br>  He knows it is a non-nude beach but there was no one at the beach today so he decides to tan his p*nis.

He sleeps for several hours.<br>  <br>  Later the man wakes up and notices that he is in a hospital bed and soon he feels searing pain coming from his groin. Then one of the nurses come along and say "Do you have any idea how this happened to you?"<br>  Then the man says "All I can remember is that little girl,"<br>  <br>  So then the next day the police go to the little girl's house and say to her "There was a man who got injured on the beach yesterday. Did you see anything?"<br>  <br>  The little girl says "I didn't see anything. I was on the beach and I was playing with the little bird on the man's crotch. But then it spit this white stuff at me.

Everybody keeps saying that Hinata died. Looked like she just got knocked out to me. Thanks for providing the link<br>  <br>  Until you guys see more I think everybody should just hold off on this "She dead bit" until the next issue comes out.<br>  <br>  Jezz!|`|X45rxI7gaa	finally dies? so you're saying you wanted her to die?<br>  <br>  I doubt she's dead because she's a main character.|`|iG5v0tDXaa	She could have died by Pain's chakra blades as you can see him holding one on the same page.|`|oir5upKHaa	I don't think she's dead since she's one of the main characters. I doubt Kishimoto would kill her off right when she confessed her love for him.|`|Fcz18jTZaa	You don't know if she died yet (probly did but...). Pain just said how his parents died in front of him. I think she just got badly injured. Since Naruto knows she loves him he probably got THAT mad (six tails) for hurting her.|`|ASoKuntMaa	nah. Now that I think about it<br>  I don't think Hinata is dead.<br>  Think about it.<br>  Like they said in the show once.<br>  "See what's underneath the underneath"|`|5nwOZLgqaa	she might not be dead i hope not anyway after all she is a main character. We will just have to wait and see cant wait to see the next chapter six tailed naruto vs pain gonna be epic|`|stYO4Q1Haa	no that would just piss every fan off.<br>  <br>  they might have wanted to give hinata a better angle but killing her will acheive nothing. they have possibly killed kakashi but hinata why and remember the other toad was there as well the possiblity it was her is also high.<br>  <br>  she is the main character you just don't kill off the main character unless you are in dragonball z.<br>  <br>  hinata is now of far more importance. also she is way too popular to kill off like i said it would just piss every fan off<br>  <br>  i seriously doubt she is dead because the odds are stacked against her and if you are the underdog like Hinata is then that sort of goes in her favour. so if the odds are stacked against her then her chances of survival has increased by a heavy amount. i would say she as an 85% chance of survival.|`|HhpRxYSLaa	Like every single one of the younger generation ninja in Naruto, she's probably going to "die", and then Kishi would miraculously not appear dead somehow.<br>  <br>  Like with Neji, Chouji, Gaara...etc.<br>  <br>  Edit: Ryoga, you're wrong. She isn't a main character, she's side. Sakura is leading lady. And popularity has nothing to do with keeping characters alive, Itachi was popular and he died.|`|FIwBccyiaa	EDIT:<br>  wait why are u saying finally dies..did u like want her to die..???<br>  and its not confirmed yet that shes died maybe shes just in the mid of dying..she mite survive|`|SyApztvuaa	i know i was just reading it. i cant believe she dies like that at least she told naruto how she felt im so sad|`|L2nbez3caa	Nah.. i dont think hinata is dead. Kishi just jeeded her to trigger the kayubi inside naruto. But definitely she wont die. And besides i've seen photos of them. Kissing and stuff. So they will end up together.<br>  <br>  And if hinata die's, im not gonna forgive kishi for doing that to her. I mean Hinata is 1 of the favorites. How could he kill her, and do something like that. And if hinata dies, im pretty sure naruto manga and the anime naruto will loose ranks.<br>  <br>  Naruto manga and Naruto shippuuden is in the A1 right now, which is the top.<br>  <br>  And kishi is getting ideas from us. He's actually reading our predictions to create some imaginations. And if people dont hinata dead, then i guess hinata is alive. We should all think outside the box sometimes.<br>  <br>  SO COME ON KISHI! DONT KILL HINITA FOR GOD SAKE!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://my-naruto-blog.blogspot.com/2009/02/naruto-chapter-438-spoiler-raw.html" rel="nofollow">http://my-naruto-blog.blogspot.com/2009/...</a>|`|oZGu2pZTaa	it makes perfect sense, they wont have her live right after she ruins the love pentagon between rock lee naruto hinata sasuke and sakura<br>  <br>  right when she confessed her love to him i said o dang there goes hinata haha<br>  <br>  anyways pein is obviously in trouble now and i think that gais team is going to run into a fight they dont want to be involved in|`|MaCVp5Xsaa	no personally i think shes just knocked out really bad and why kill her when she just got the guts to tell naruto that she loves him? to be honest i dont think she is dead lets just wait and see what happends next|`|sLvyz5zAaa	Two things:<br>  <br>  If Hinata is dead, the series can focus more on a building relationship between Naruto and Sakura. <br>  <br>  If Hinata is alive, the series can move forth making the relationship between Naruto and Hinata stronger, since Naruto finally notices her.<br>  <br>  Either way, the series is ending soon, and Naruto needs a love interest, and with Hinata liking Naruto, and Naruto liking Sakura, it's a love triangle that isn't really getting anywhere.<br>  <br>  Overall, it's going to be exciting to see what happens next.|`|2DKRF3qoaa	Time out... She may not be dead, Pain may be cold and heartless, and he may want to kill Naruto.... But he may not want to knock off Hinata. Sakura would not forgive herself if Hinata would die and she got to tell her feelings to him first. Also she is not a main character, she is an character in the Manga and (soon) Anime. But she is not a main or the main, that honor goes to Naruto himself.     Give me a break man!!! she may jump in the rankings some but god man!! You guys are throwing Naruto under the ******* bus here. She "Believed it" and told him her true feelings.|`|1oNa75OYaa	Hinata is not dead people. SHE IS ALIVE!! She is knocked out at the end of chapter 437. Pain never stabbed her with his chakra blade. If you look closely at the bottum right image on page 14 in the chapter, you see that Pain stabbed the ground and not Hinata. You can see the cracks in the rock and the blood flowing down the sword and onto the rocks. The blood is Naruto's from earlier in the battle. And the triangle figure above the blade is Hinata's sleeve.  And I doubt that Pain's first attack would kill her right off the bat, if so why would Pain need to stab/fake stab her. Hinata is still alive at the end of the chapter, as for if she will live or die later i have no idea.|`|IDUg1KP6aa	well no i dont think she died well i hope she dosent because i like her character but if you remember chojis though his dad was dead but he wasn' t but you dont know she could be dead|`|xKxKHPsMaa	Yes regardless what these other people say she is dead it shows pain lift up one of those chakra signal things in kill position and it makes the sound effect of stabbing so ergo he finished her off and reminds naruto that this is just like when his parents were killed in front of him. the only way she wont die is if they do something similar like they did for garra by trading lives or something other than that she is confirmed dead|`|Sl52WDwVaa	this is animeking wanting to join in on the conversation, i cannot believe that hinata dies right after she tells naruto how she feels about him im kinda mad at the creator for making such a terrible ending, but enough with the emotional stuff lets get to the fact that naruto is now in his freaking 6th tailed form and he did it in an instant he must of been realllllllly pissed! also notice his form there are the bones of the nine tailed fox coming out of him like a shield im afraid that naruto will die from the aftereffects of this transformation we cannot only see the end of hinata but the end of naruto himself!!?|`|0VV7pZV9aa	dang guys, how do none of you see hinata get stabbed in the heart?!!! the next page, after hinata is knocked to the ground, Pein stabs her with his knife. It even has the japanese sound effect for a stab at the top of the page. And then it shows immense bleeding from her chest area, and naruto freaks out and goes 6 tails.|`|7U7OizXjaa	Man they're just going to keep killing everyone off aren't they. First Kakashi and now this.|`|cSJLV980aa	She's been disposed of.  Doesn't mean she is dead, just means she isn't going to be helping Naruto out anytime soon.  Don't worry, things will work out as they always do.  The author never disappoints his fans, unless the fans want something that gets in the way of the main story arc like Gara coming back from the dead.<br>  <br>  Please note, at this time my comment is completely speculation.  No one really knows what is going to happen next until the next weeks issue is released.|`|u6jwAdowaa	Uh... SPOILER much?!|`|Wwf0AuYMaa	Yeah. It's so sad. She's my favorite character because her story is, for me, deep and moving. She's strong in her own way and when she finally tells Naruto how she feels about him, she dies. It's just tragic. She had a hard life and now she has a sad death...Well, at least she can rest now...:)|`|d5ae6eb71f3ea80a6ec89e0c5323f28aaa	URH im disgusted!<br>  <br>  Even if she dies ??". I believe since shes hinata then she might just end up badly injured and will come bk alive XD I cant bear the thought of hinata dying.<br>  <br>  And sakura doesnt end up getting together with naruto!!! <<< Sakura X Naruto is a sickening pairing!!!<br>  <br>  naruto X Hinata fan 4life!|`|JT37eDxiaa	yes she died. I think the reason why kishi let her die for the reason to naruto and sakura(you know what i mean).

I really don't want her to die, though, so I'm holding a small shred of hope for her. But some of the others are right, popularity doesn't always mean that they're gonna stay alive, just look at Itachi. They kind of needed him to die, so Sasuke would stop whining about revenge.|`|LOSFTvlraa	i don't think she's dead, but rather that she's very close to death. the same thing happened with kakashi. everyone thought he died, but tsunade said there might still be a way to save him. likewise, there might be a way to save hinata too.|`|xXO6BQwbaa	Im sorry to say..but i belive that hinata did die.As awful as it sounds..its a strong possibilty...Kishi may want to make rrom for Sakura and Naruto and getting rid of Sakuras competion may be what he had in mind.But im hopeing she isnt dead because if naruto anf HInata have a kid...man will that be a strong little dude or girl...call them Byakyuubi....the white eyes and little demon foxes in the kid...lol|`|Xddc4H3haa	Well... Pain has killed Kakashi and alot of other ninja in the village, so i dont know why it would be different for Hinata. But... You know how things like love in anime like to draw out the " I LOVE YOU" part, so maybe she isnt dead.|`|J5Wpp6Htaa	Well, I would like to think Hinata hasn't died.<br>  I mean, not after what she tells Naruto!<br>  Cause, i'm a NaruHina fan and... well, I would not like to think it that way.<br>  I'm pretty sure she's still alive. We didn't really see her die...<br>  NARUHINA FOREVER!!!|`|pZG04d7Daa	Just to contribute, I think Pain stabs her with his blade after knocking her down, and they just don't show it. Chances are, Hinata was murdered, otherwise Naruto wouldn't have gone six tails on the fly like that.|`|eLi410ocaa	Yeah. She does die. I read it at MangaFox.com<br>  She's a main character, so what? Kakashi Died, and he was a main character. REMEMBER tons of people die in the Series of Naruto. Ero Sennin Died too.|`|A6OQoS92aa	i really hope hinata is not dead but just unconscious and really really hope that sakura dose not get with naruto in the end although i like sakura i dont think shes suitable for naruto.|`|wNezRUHSaa	She's dead. The creator had no problem killing Jaraiya, Kakashi, and even Itachi, and they had much more importance than Hinata. Think about it, has she had any major influence on the story?|`|tOYjgFXhaa	well if you think about it then pain has no remorse cause with salamander hanzo he killed him then killed all family then all known associates <br>  so he probably has stabbed her but shes not going to give up but shes in a bad state

Their first 3 albums had that unrehearsed garage sound that made them millionaires at a very young age. The names for the first three albums are: Grand Funk Railroad, 1st album 1969. Their second album was: Grand Funk, that was their famous red album 1969 and the third album was, Closer to Home 1970. All three albums are very edgy, unrehearsed and over the top garage sound for their time. Look at their picture inside the red albums CD and they would look just like a heavy Metal band of today almost 40 years later. By the fourth album the group lost their edge in their sound and they started to sound like all other groups out there of the time. I have gotten older and have out grown that kind of sound but someone younger like you it just might be one of those new sounds you are looking for.

I also don't really mind when people only know one song, I don't really think it diminishes the value of the music itself. Like you said, a lot of people only know Killing in the Name or Bulls on Parade from RATM, but people like myself heard of them from GH and liked what they did, so explored more of their music. The people that do only listen to the one song on GH by a band are the people that don't appreciate music to start with.|`|03c870c2ab95c32e4284f873e1540058aa	absolutely not.  For many i know, it broadened their musical horizons. You hear a song you like and you check out the band more. then it leads to you new bands.  Don't hate b/c other people can be stupid.

IUxM3brbaa	I think you mean 16K bit rate, which is pretty bad..thats like worse than telephone quality.<br>  <br>  40GB = 343,597,383,680 bits<br>  <br>  16Kbit/sec for 3.5 minute (210 second) song = 3,360,000 bits each<br>  <br>  So 343,597,383,680/3,360,000 = 102,261 songs<br>  <br>  Thats a lot. I suggest using 128Kbit/s and you will still get 25,500 songs|`|lgyWJ3TYaa	about 8000|`|zfadjiJVaa	7000|`|OLCoFKQraa	my ipod has 55 gig on it already, and that amounts to around 6500 songs, but most of them go for over 3:30, so my guess would be that you'd get at least 6500 songs on there, if they're all that short, even more if you plan on using terrible quality.

d7qUDYNVaa	Fortunately for me, I knew someone in the business. He mentored me for a few years. I also went to film school for a year. With that being said, I’d hate to say it but for film, you don’t really have to go to school. The best way to break into film is to join a lot of clubs (Film foundations, film societies etc.), that way you get to know people that can really help you. (example; you want to be a director and not a writer, you can, most likely, find a writer with the same artistic views as you at the get-togethers) I made a ton of short films. When I got comfortable enough, I started entering timed contests and festivals. That’s really the way to do it. You just have to realize that it won’t happen overnight, and for some, it won’t happen at all.<br>  <br>  Eventually I learned how to do special effects, sound mixing, sound editing and movie editing, <br>  <br>  As for acting… I have no idea, lol, I never liked actors and never wanted to be one.

You'll need to start applying for jobs as a PA, or maybe an internship first, and "pay your dues".  If you want to act, you'll want to take classes for that.  However if you want to be a movie critic, you'll need a degree in journalism from a college.|`|SMtTONPQaa	NEVER WATCHED  IT SORRY

Although sad at times, the ending is sweet and is really good.<br>  <a href="http://onemanga.com/Bitter_Virgin/" rel="nofollow">http://onemanga.com/Bitter_Virgin/</a><br>  <br>  *Half and Half - this is a one shot manga but a worthwhile read.

Uses sport as a subplot and is suprisingly addictive to read. The manga has finished and an anime has also been released closely following the manga.<br>  <a href="http://onemanga.com/Suzuka/" rel="nofollow">http://onemanga.com/Suzuka/</a><br>  <br>  *Kimi No Iru Machi - Another romance based manga. It is like the opposite of Suzuka and is really a nice change of perspective, especially after you have read Suzuka.

Also it is getting released bi-monthly so there's going to be some serious waiting before this series ends up being finished. However, it is incredibly promising and I'm sure you'll get hooked to.<br>  <a href="http://onemanga.com/Princess_Lucia/" rel="nofollow">http://onemanga.com/Princess_Lucia/</a><br>  <br>  Love Hina - I know, this series sounds cheesy etc, but really this is a good series.

One of the most satisfying endings you ever come across.<br>  <a href="http://onemanga.com/Love_Hina/" rel="nofollow">http://onemanga.com/Love_Hina/</a><br>  <br>  * means that they have been written and drawn by Seo Kouji. All his manga's are very similar yet different. The main characters look the same from the different manga's but their personality are almost entirely different. I highly recommend his manga's as they are very intriguing and the drawings are very detailed. As well as that, there is a distinct art style about the manga which really catches your attention.

Ym7H3x49aa	I LOVE sweet girls. Bad girls are too unstable in my opinion. I've grown up with them, and frankly, I wouldn't want to get involved with their drama. They're crazy I tell you, completely nuts! With a sweet girl, you can always count on them to respect you and treat you right. They are the best lovers (demonstrating love, not sexual) and don't put out like a dirty tramps. I actually want to work for a relationship that actually GOES somewhere.|`|73ZquQVwaa	a sweet girl but has an edge to her too.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	When you're dating bad girls can be fun.<br>  But when it's time to settle down you want a sweet girl.

They have good and bad emotions and they don't put on a fake attitude.<br>  <br>  Quite a few punk chicks are often quite sweet too.<br>  <br>  "sweet, flower-picking girl who wants to be friends with everyone" sounds like a potential serial killer to me. Of all the people any of us know, probably only 5% or less could be classed as friends so sweet flower picker would be 95% disappointed and unhappy.<br>  <br>  For me and most people the important things are sincerity, kindness, decency, a good heart, loyalty and functional behaviour.<br>  <br>  Reasons? If you go out with somebody who is disloyal, they will be disloyal to you too. Kindness, sincerity, decency and a good heart are also traits which mean you can trust somebody. <br>  <br>  I would never go out with somebody whose behaviour is dysfunctional. That includes self obsession, being manipulative/game playing, addictive shopping, drug addiction, extreme religious/ anti religious intolerance, self harm, mental illness, personality disorders and eating disorders. Not because people who do those things are nasty but because I guarantee those traits will make any partner very unhappy. I know from experience - dysfunctional people make their problems your problems.<br>  <br>  So is there any "ideal type"?<br>  <br>  No, there are physical things I find attractive but other than that it's all in the personality.<br>  <br>  Maybe a flower picking punk chick who's happy to make friends but isn't needy and doesn't have some fake "I'm-not-afraid-of-anything" attitude.<br>  <br>  I've been celibate for over 15 years now and I don't think my perfect woman will come along. The only reason i'd ever give up celibacy now is if I truly fell mutually in love with somebody naturally and unexpectedly.<br>  <br>  My perfect partner would also like cats.....roasted. <br>  <br>  Just kidding cat lovers.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Almost every guy I've ever known will agree that they want the sweet girl who withholds a bad girl inside.

e6jrBORRaa	I still love "Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan".  I was so emotionally affected by it.  The scene where Spock died was gut wrenching!!  And, the final scene when Kirk is giving Spock's eulogy?  The way his voice breaks but he manages to correct himself and press on with his speech?  Wow...I was just a blubbering mess.  ;-) <br>  <br>  Putting aside the fact that it was such a tear-jerker, it really was just a great film.  Reprising Khan's character was a great move.  It was a familiar face that fans related to and wanted to see again.  And, Ricardo Montalban was perfect as the insane villain out-for-revenge.  <br>  <br>  Finally, "The Wrath of Khan" was able to pump life back into the franchise.  This was sorely needed after the first movie was such a dud.|`|ZbpaRKkUaa	The Voyage Home : Star Trek IV - because of the reference to Harold Robbins and Jacqueline Susanne and also because it was well made. The second movie was surprisingly good too. Kirstie Alley as Saavik.<br>  The Edith Keeler episode where they travel through the Guardian of Forever - because I've read a lot of Star Trek novels and they refer to this episode and especially the role that the Guardian plays in the life of Spock and Kirk.|`|NxLmvKtJaa	Star Trek VI:  The Undiscovered Country.

Rex Banner is appointed to replace Chief Wiggum as police chief to enforce the new laws and stop Fat Tony from smuggling. Rex is successful, but then Homer starts to smuggle alcohol. Eventually, Homer ends his bootlegging ends and approaches Wiggum with a plan to expose himself and restore Wiggum's good name. Homer is about to receive punishment by being catapulted, but he is saved by an impassioned speech by Marge.

oKckkzz9aa	I have to read the next chapter to see the jutsu done on 6 tails naruto first.<br>  <br>  But I'm guessing the Yamato, and team Gai will show up to seal him back. Then the others may find pains body. I dunno man so many facors to consider. Or Naruto may juss get kiddnapped. Sasuke is confusing what he'll do too. He didn't really capture the 8 tails if I remember correctly plus the village is gone except the stone faces...<br>  <br>  <br>  Pain has one dummy body and his own body protected by conan but knowing him he is prepared for combat with his regular body. I dont think anyone can handle conan except maybe someone from team Gai.<br>  <br>  <br>  {EDIT}<br>  <br>  Naruto might be kidnapped and just have the nine tails removed.. I wonder how narto will function considering his chakra. But if he can still use sage mode he'll be good. What bothers me if they do get the nine tails they still need the right right? I bet kishimoto is gonna cut back to sasukes story now...|`|QTo87nTbaa	itachis "power" could be like madara's power to control the kyubii, he could have given it to naruto like he implanted amaterasu into sasuke<br>  he could use it to control the kyubii like the 8 tails contolls his transformations and then kill pain<br>  when sasuke gets to konoha he probs will flip knowing that its already destroyed and go hunt down pain and will have a massive all out battle with mangekyou sasuke and 6tails naruto and while pain uses the chibaku tensei <br>  i dont think pain will die just yet or else there wont be many antagonists left

66XP3XILaa	pluse, that's the movie like 3 yrs old|`|ZyGyDLsDaa	Pulse (2006)<br>  starring Kristen Bell, Ian Somerhalder, Christina Milian, Rick Gonzalez, Jonathan Tucker, Ron Rifkin, Brad Dourif, Kel O'Neill, Zach Grenier<br>  IMDb review:<br>  A hacker releases a strange computer virus that immediately affects computers everywhere, as well as cell phones and even TV screens. Eventually, it is discovered that the virus is really the dead who have found a way to return to the living world. What they want is the life force of every living being. It is up to our heroes to try and find a way to stop them before they can consume the entire world.<br>  <br>  This is the U.S. version of "Kairo" aka "Pulse" (2001 Japan). You likely would enjoy the original, too. The other share very little storywise or at least the way the story is approached. I like both versions. The U.S. movie goes for a lot more shocking images, the major difference.

Be a good conversation starter. Tell him you hadn't seen him on your normal route and wondered what happen. That lets him know that you at least thought of him and might kick stuff off. Then from there maybe he'll give a reason why he switched (job, etc) and you can make some small talk and get a number at the end of it.|`|a7yj0kZcaa	Hmm this is a difficlt situation. He could either be flattered, or creeped out. I would say to go for it... if things don't work out, you wouldn't have to worry about what you would do the next time you see him, right?

TLC were not. They wore comdoms on their clothes that stir up a lotta noise and ppl felt they were sending out the wrong message. Left-eye stayed in a abusive relationship and was arrested for arson. Plus T-boz and Chilli really didn't get along with Left-eye.So I don't think Oprah would have showed them love.

I actually had to read your post twice before understanding what you meant, but you're completely right.  The producers should really think about those kind of situations in the upcoming episodes.<br>  <br>  On a side note--Do you even like the way they're doing the elimination rounds this year?  I'm not liking the format or the concept of the "wild card" week.  I really liked when they had girls perform on night 1 and guys on night 2.  It all works out the same.  Just personal preference I suppose.

That's just a naked man... but doesn't it make you wonder what they're looking at on the fifth floor!....... I'm not a Pervert"                LOL . Another time is when a man calls her while she is in a conference to tell her that she owes lots of money. she knows who it is because he calls her often calls her about the same thing. she climbs up on the table and hangs up the phone and tell them it was a ex boyfriend who has been stalking her. then another time when her and her friend get drunk and she trys to get a letter back befcause she sent it to the wrong address. It is super funny and you should see it. it was dumd at 1 part when the man she works for gets angry and asks her why she shops...|`|6oWIKqS7aa	it was ok.<br>  in a way she is too lucky so feel kinda jealous, career-wise and stuff.<br>  being in debt and writing it off and everything is far-fetched, (or extreme) thought shallow... superficial... i know that's why materialism is silly.<br>  maybe i should have seen it as fairy tale, but i thought that way as well as light hearted...<br>  i liked the colourful-ness tho. and the friend of the main character was beautiful, she is lovely.|`|il9vgn2qaa	I LOVED it (:<br>  My favourite bits were when they would talk to random people when they would be asked a question, one of my favourites is where theres two women talking about one of the subjects and one of the women is like yeaa i eat loads or something, that made me laugh.<br>  Another of my favourite bits is when the guy from the bar and the red/gingery haired girl got together (lol ive forgotten they're names :L) but yeaa was a good film and if you haven't seen it i recommend it! :)
JlYqg8z8aa	the thing now with the oscars is that the voters are a newer generation thats why crash, departed, no country and now slumdog have won last few.<br>  <br>  they are all fresh, hip and action/thriller related.  Multi themed.<br>  no longer are the old timers the majority voters that would have seen the likes of rev road, aviator, australia through.<br>  Gran tornio was not oscar worthy whereas the wrestler was the biggest snub especially as it was on the thinest budget.<br>  <br>  This year as a hole was very weak.|`|hZHj0i52aa	I havent seen Revolutionary Road but have seen Gran Torino. Gran Torino and Dark Knight were the two best movies I have seen in '08. Watching the oscars I didnt think credit was given where it was due. I mean, Slumdog Millionaire? Yeah it was an okay movie but wasnt a great movie. In fact I remember some people walking out of that one when I saw it.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	Look at the history of the Oscar and I think you'll see really glaring snubs. The Greatest Show on Earth which is a terrible movie beat out High Noon and The Quiet Man for Best Picture. High Noon is arguably the best or 2nd best Western of all time, and John Ford won the Best Director award for The Quiet Man!<br>  <br>  In 1967 the old school brought forth Dr Doolittle. The young Turks had Bonnie and Clyde and The Graduate. Neither won Best Picture though Mike Nichols won Best Director for Graduate. In the Heat of the Night won for Best Picture and Rod Steiger won Best Actor for Night.<br>  <br>  In the early 50s Humphrey Bogart won instead of Marlon Brando for The African Queen over Streetcar Named Desire. Figure that one out.<br>  <br>  And great actors like Pacino and Newman have always been ignored until late in their careers, likewise directors such as Scorsese.|`|ml2FDYECaa	Ever since Scorsese was snubbed for Goodfellas I lost all hope from that point on...even as director. I don't even remember who won as I don't care anymore. For anyone to answer this question...I loved readying their responses as they are all right...I don't take it as serious anymore, but I have watching them as I get up from the computer from time to time. <br>  <br>  I really wanted Mickey to win, but at least it was Sean who won as he is one of the greatest genius' in our time of cinema.|`|d55D0Ci4aa	I agree, my biggest disappointments were The Dark Knight and Revolutionary Road!|`|e61gjKd5aa	Yes! I no! I agree!|`|5db8a4d79ef1c9ff462987bc954ba65baa	The credibility issue stems from the arrogance of referring to Oscar winners as the "Best."  While it is my opinion that Sean Penn gave the best performance by a lead actor this year in "Milk" I can understand how some would consider Mickey Rourke worthy of that honor.  When you are claiming that someone was the "best" you cannot allow sentiment or politics to weigh in the decision making process. I think the Oscars should be for the Academy's "Favorite" performance, etc.<br>  <br>  While I didn't feel that "Revolutionary Road" was an exceptional film, I did believe Kate Winslet gave an exceptional performance.  The problem is that she got nominated for "The Reader" (deservedly so).  If the award is all about the best individual performance by an actress.  Why is it that Kate Winslet could not get nominated twice in the same category if she gave two nomination -worthy performances in two different films?<br>  <br>  But you will find plenty of instances where Oscars were given to films or performers that probably were not the best in their respective years.  "Citizen Kane" is considered the greatest film of all-time.  It won one Oscar for its screenplay and nothing else because people were jealous of Orson Welles.  There are several other examples, Oscar history is rife with oversights.|`|7bIrMvziaa	What do you mean losing it?<br>  The oscars haven't had credibility for years.

f68cbd69ab1cba1c29f33d69ed58c6b2aa	I know! A few of my friends said the same thing, that they had seen it before. When I saw it I thought it was really familiar too. We thought maybe it was a remake or something.|`|yqe0I5zpaa	The film's screener was released online, the screener was only intended for critical and studio viewing, for promotional viewing. So, that a studio could pay cash to distribute and market the film, not everyone downloads movies, so the people who didn't see it, went to go see it. The fact that the film was leaked online was because somebody got a hold of it and distributed it online for free, it's pretty common.|`|vvAyfBGCaa	Taken was released in Europe last year, because studio heads didn't think that it would sit well with American audiences. The movie was a hit in Europe, so they sent it to America this year and people love it.<br>  <br>  The DVD came out last year, which is why you may have seen it before. It has also been leaked too I believe.|`|JlYqg8z8aa	this was a rariety in which a distributor threw their film out to the world before the states.  Therefore it got leaked over the net.  It was a big ploy that actually worked, as it got good word of mouth and despite many thinking that downloads would have hurt it really bosted it and I'm sure other companies will do the same as Taken has nearly grossed an unbelievable 100 million in  the states today!

AA12227599	I think you have a lovely voice and alot of potential. Celine Dion however is not a good choice if you're not sure if you can sing, especially that song. I think it was a bit too big for your voice in some parts. I wouldn't try out for Idol just yet. With some vocal coaching you will get much better, so I say go for it. Just try and watch the weaving back and forth, I started getting sea sick. lol <br>  you are very cute too. :)|`|hZco463faa	First let me start by saying that you are as cute as bug ears and kudos for putting yourself out there like that.  That takes guts..<br>  <br>  Second, and please dont think I am being mean, but your are simply ok.  I bet you sing alot better when you are alone and not so nervous.  I wouldnt stop working on it, but right now your not ready to perform or anyhing like that.  Thank goodness your not tone deaf though, which means you have the ability to improve.  The tone of your voice is good, but breathing an inflection and all that stuff needs to be completely addressed.  <br>  <br>  I dont mean to sound harsh or judgenmental, but I firmly beleive that people should get honest feed back when it comes to things like this.  If people are simply just being nice then it can hurt you more in the long run.<br>  <br>  Good luck and dont ever stop trying|`|h0Zk7hfaaa	yup, not bad kid|`|8VWQbMvCaa	ya u r actually rlly good i like ur singing style<br>  keep up the good work!!<br>  : )|`|lijNJznEaa	good voice- 5HIT song- sorry.|`|voFR2se9aa	that was pretty good.

vuCo9wZZaa	The second half of it shown on Wednesday had them training with their new "teams" and Jillian's team had a 3 pound advantage for winning the 24 hour bike challenge, although they would have won without it anyway.  So Bob's team had to boot someone.  Ultimately it seemed like the team stayed with original party lines. The Yellow team split with one of them voting for Kristen (purple) and the other voting for Ron, Ron and Dane voted for eachother, and then I think purple must have both voted for Dane. Had both of the girls on yellow voted for Ron then it would have been a tie and Dane would have been able to stay, but the one (the one who was at home for a while and only lost 2 pounds) took the chicken way out by voting for Kristen as a throw away vote.<br>  <br>  But, Dane looked fantastic in his video after the show and was able to complete a marathon with his wife in less than 4 hours.<br>  <br>  They didn't say how much he had actually lost, but he certainly looked happy and healthy.<br>  <br>  UPDATE:  It has now been revealed that Dane did not run the complete marathon within the alloted time and due to an overzealous producer, he was driven  miles and then finished so that they could get the footage of him crossing the finish (which must happen within 6 hours).  The finish time was 5 h 53m, and Dane felt so guilty that he went back and ran the 3 miles that evening.  Now people are in an uproar, but the fact is, he did run the 26.2 miles in that day, and the time reported was the fault of TBL, not Dane misrepresenting.  They also reported in this article that he's lost 130 pounds so far.<br>  <br>  Here's a link to the "scandal" and the explanations.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/02/danes-marathon.html" rel="nofollow">http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtrac...</a>|`|lCE5sziNaa	Dane was sent home after having integrated blue and black teams.|`|4imsjgE2aa	Dane was sent home after losing 100 pounds in 8 weeks!  I guess they thought he was the biggest threat.<br>  <br>  The three people of this Blue Team to vote him off were Kristin, Ron (who I think should have been sent home because of his knee) and Cathy.<br>  <br>  Since leaving he has run a marathon with his wife.  However, they didn't mention how much he has lost since he left, like they have done with with out contestants.|`|FghyJZC7aa	I personally believe they should have kept Dane around for a while. He was a threat to the other team, not them. He could have been a big help to the blue team with his weight loss. That would have prevented them from having to send anyone home for a while. Maybe they'll realize how much they need him at next weeks weigh-in.|`|ztllWXy3aa	Dane got kicked off on the Wednesday night episode!|`|AA11215640	it was on the next night.<br>  <br>  Dane got kicked off....|`|6e5ab6ad17c88f5c5e5b06b79857d7caaa	Dane got the boot, but he shouldn't have.  I hate when they vote off the strong players - whoever is left at the end of all of that mess probably will be the biggest loser in the negative way.

The Jonas Brothers and Green Day are like two different worlds. They are totally different from each other. Jonas Brothers are mostly pop, not even close to punk, and Green Day are alternative/punk. All I have to say to Disney is Wow....Just...Wow!|`|AA10652430	Interesting yet odd statement, because both groups are far too different from each other. Green Day is punk pop right? <br>  I think you can put the JoBros in the bubblegum pop category, like those before them (Hanson, etc).|`|WaBdHbhhaa	wow. just wow.|`|6ZI2Fhgiaa	If that's true, I'm a man, and apples are the clean version of tomatoes!<br>  <br>  You cannot compare the two bands.

And on calling them "clean punk"...<br>  <br>  Isn't that the ultimate contradiction?|`|BpRbWoFCaa	i agree, that they probably meant that they are like green day for the younger crowd. i think the fact that they compare Jonas Brothers to the Beatles is A LOT worse!|`|AA10479574	simple because theyre dumb and they want to make JB sound hardcore and less poppish (even tho they are clearly pop)|`|NaPibFiYaa	I agree, their music is nothing like Green Day...<br>  I think Disney is just trying to get more people to listen to them by comparing them to REAL bands with REAL music.|`|guuInsslaa	i am a very big fan of both GreenDay and the Jonas Brothers<br>  i really dont know how the bands are like ATALL!<br>  waht idiot even thought that!? x|`|zsyyFDdEaa	wowwww.. xD hah the jonas brothers suck!! :D green day is soo much better so wTF r they thinking?!!?!? they can sooo not even come close to being good!|`|g5pZhzeoaa	That's pretty funny.  But why they would even think to compare the two bands? I don't know.  Disney...is....just messed up.|`|Wy3wddFlaa	are you sure??|`|lkP8ZY63aa	It's because everybody loves Green Day and Disney wants everyone to love Jonas Brothers so they make them out to be the new Green Day but they're way more toward the pop side if you ask me. If the Sex Pistols knew that one day The Jonas Brothers were going to come about, I doubt they'd even start a band :-P|`|6lkNOFNlaa	Maybe what they mean is like, they are a kid version of Greenday but Greenday are far more talented with a more mature sound to them so I personally don't see the comparison much apart from them both being bands and the fact that they both have guitars.|`|QlJBmjsraa	I think Green Day would beat the crap out of the Jon *** Bros if they met.

gIjnoEi5aa	His name is Anoop Desai.  I was pretty upset last week when Michael Sarver beat him out for the 3rd spot in the top 12. (Alexis Grace was the highest voted girl and Danny Gokey was the highest voted guy). Now, Michael IS very likable, but Anoop has a MUCH stronger voice. I just wish he had chosen a song other than, "Angel of Mine," because it didn't showcase his amazing vocal ability. After Anoop's initial auditioned I searched for clips of him on You Tube and I found out that he sang in an all male a cappella (sp?) group for the University of North Carolina. After watching those clips it made me want him to succeed even more. Therefore, I'm going to pray that he makes it in the wild card round because I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY want to see him in the top 12!|`|elfIbUCmaa	anoop desai otherwise known as "anoop dawg"|`|9d9d3bb3d31c037c8e12d6a013e133f2aa	ANOOP!!! i dont know what his last name is, but his first name is anoop. randy called him "anoop-dog" :)|`|JbPGX2Adaa	anoop|`|76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	Anoop dawg :p.

ed4af609a0a4f9d42f8a2f01236c55e2aa	A fretted fingerboard (a fretboard) can be scalloped by 'scooping out' the wood between each of the frets to create a shallow 'U' shape. The result is a playing surface wherein the players' fingers come into contact with the strings only, and do not touch the fingerboard.<br>  <br>  Scalloping can be:<br>  Full - All frets from the first to the last are scalloped.<br>  Partial - When some of the top frets are scalloped for fast soloing.<br>  Popular examples include half scalloping (12th to the last fret) or few top frets scalloping (19–24, 17–22, etc.)<br>  <br>  You can read more here if interested:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalloped_fretboard#Scalloping" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalloped_f...</a>|`|7d03fbeeb45eea4c8affc41243484833aa	give the 10 points to joe b thats exactly what it is ..<br>  <br>  it is well explained.. <br>  <a href="http://www.ancient-future.com/guitar/scallop.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ancient-future.com/guitar/sca...</a><br>  if want more info try this link above|`|53b2fb5e21113cbf8c594de3e35c1e0daa	A scalloped fretboard is when the fretboard is actually rounded inward between frets.....In other words, wood is shaved out between the frets, like bowed inwards.

Este le sugirió lo siguiente: La próxima vez, coloque unas gotitas de vodka en el agua y va a ver que, después de algunos tragos, va a estar más relajado". El domingo siguiente el Padre aplicó la sugerencia, pero no contó el número de gotas y se pasó. Pero, en efecto se sintió tan bien que podría hablar hasta en medio de una tempestad, su emotividad causó hasta desmayos y hubo una mezcla de conmoción y emoción extrema entre los feligreses... Al finalizar el sermón, ya totalmente relajado, regresó a la sacristía y encontró una nota del Arzobispo que decía lo siguiente:<br>  <br>  Apreciado Padre Gumaro: La próxima vez, coloque unas gotas de vodka en el agua y no unas gotas de agua en el vodka. Le anexo algunas observaciones para que no se repita lo que vi en el sermón de hoy:<br>  <br>  No hay necesidad de poner limón y mucho menos escarchar con sal el borde del cáliz.<br>  <br>  Aquella caseta, al lado del altar es el confesionario y no el ba?o.<br>  <br>  Evite apoyarse en la imagen de la Virgen y mucho menos abrazarla y besarla.<br>  <br>  Existen 10 mandamientos y no 12.<br>  <br>  Los apóstoles eran 12 y no 7, y ninguno era enanito.<br>  <br>  La Santa Cruz no es la " T volteada esa".<br>  <br>  No nos referimos a nuestro Se?or Jesucristo y sus apóstoles como " J.C. & company ".<br>  <br>  No nos referimos a Judas como "ca.brón lengua larga".<br>  <br>  No debe tratar al Papa por "El Padrino".<br>  <br>  Bin Laden no tuvo nada que ver con la muerte de Jesús.<br>  <br>  El agua bendita es para bendecir y no para refrescarse la nuca.<br>  <br>  Nunca rece la misa sentado en la escalera del altar y mucho menos con el pie sobre la Biblia.<br>  <br>  La Biblia, a propósito, no es ningún "librito bien pocamadre".<br>  <br>  Dios no les dio la "expulsación" a Adán y Eva del paraíso.<br>  <br>  Las hostias son para distribuirlas en el pueblo. No deben ser usadas como aperitivo para acompa?ar el vino y no saben mejor con atún.<br>  <br>  Los pecadores van al infierno y no a chin.gar a su madre.<br>  <br>  La Virgen de la Concepción y las 1000 Vírgenes no son "Concha y las Muchachas".<br>  <br>  La iniciativa de llamar al público para bailar fue buena, pero eso de hacer trenecito por toda la iglesia, NO!<br>  <br>  El aserejé no es un salmo.<br>  <br>  Atentamente, El Arzobispo.<br>  <br>  P.D.: Aquel tipo sentado en el rincón del altar, al cual Usted se refirió como "tra.vestí con faldita", era yo.<br>  <br>  Que mier,da!|`|5e5e427a9f1b9ffa4470d7cc4fb5445daa	El lesbianismo no se produce, es una opción sexual.|`|5eca759cceb0f8a9cbfeb6744a88978eaa	El lesbianismo se produce por incapacidad de los machos para encontrar el punto G... quién mejor que una congénere para saberlo????

3SQ5RNIPaa	anke io la penso cm te xk il terzo le morti erano piu belle e paurose il secondo era carino anke se mi aspettavo di piu...il 1 invece nn  mi è tanto piaciuto x le morti assurde e stupide...ciao quindi 3-2-1|`|8gUIvKRZaa	io non ho visto il secondo, ma immagino che non sia niente di nuovo rispetto agli altri due... cmq, a me era piaciuto il primo... piaciuto per modo di dire... le solite idiozie sulla morte, bla bla bla.... però ben fatto secondo me, e anche gli attori abbastanza bravi... e che effetti speciali... io lo definirei thriller-comico-horror... la morte più bella e "assurda" è quella della professoressa... ahahahah che risate.... mentre la morte più stupida l'ha fatta quella gallinella della fidanzata di Carter (il bullo)... quella che attraversa la strada e passa un camion (in pieno centro città!) ad una velocità supersonica.... ahahahha... bella la fine.... <br>  <br>  il terzo invece era un pò più crudo... aiuto quelle duefatte arrosto dentro le lampade... che schifo... ma se la sono pure cercata... oppure quello con il cranio triturato dall'elica del motore del camion... ble... che schifo... oppure quello che rimane schiacciato da quell'insegna del luna park... O_O pu, mi sta salendo il vomito...<br>  <br>  troppo esagerato, cerca troppo di eguagliare il primo, superandolo per "schifio"... <br>  <br>  ciaooo  la morte ci perseguita... ahahahah xD|`|e1ba10a56b12218179d9f0e43b129b95aa	anche io il contrario della tua... 1 - 2 - 3 .... forse per la novità del genere.... non so...|`|e570e18337721255c9978545abb171fcaa	Non te la prendere ma la mia e' l'opposto della tua:<br>  1- come sempre (o quasi...) il capostipite e' sempre il migliore, anke perke' in questo caso ha il fattore novita' che lo rende un film molto originale.<br>  2- il secondo capitolo a mio avviso molto piu' spaltter, mi e' piaciuto per l'incredibili incidenti che succedono ai malcapitati, bellissima la scena iniziale dell'incidente sull'autostrada.<br>  3-il terzo non e' malaccio, ma l'ho trovato un po' insipido, e devo dire non recitato molto bene, ovviamente qualke bella scena c'e' anke qui, ma io preferisco i precedenti.<br>  ciaaaaa|`|3TK1ukysaa	Io il contrario della tua...<br>  <br>  1-2-3<br>  <br>  :D|`|96729428312f28932d61ee6d5eb46b81aa	nessuno|`|9AEYsVfwaa	io adoro quei film ma in particolare il 1-3 ...........2|`|CPtKFlQgaa	uhmmm.... io nn ho visto il secondo, ma sarà cm gli altri due.... anzi, x la verità su youtube, in inglese, ho visto la scena del secondo dove muore quello biondo con la faccia schiacciata dalla scala.... peggio x lui che aveva buttato gli spaghetti fuori dalla finestra!! cmq il primo e il terzo si assomigliano molto.... e mi sn piaciuti tutti e 2, in tutti e 2 i film ci sn delle morti orrende e delle morti stupide... x esempio la morte più tonta del 1 film è quella di terry, la ragazza di carter, l' "amico" (ma quale amico?? O_O) di alex... investita da un camion che tranquillamente andava in giro x le strade a 1000 km al secondo.... l'unica cosa brutta è che prima di morire aveva detto a carter che lo lasciava... poi, sempre del primo quelle che mi hanno fatto più impressione sn state quelle della prof. lutor (la morte nn ci riusciva proprio ad ucciderla) e quella di tod, quello impiccato nella propria vasca, da solo, in casa.... O_O ah, e poi bisogna contare quella di bill, lo sfigato del film che era sempre in bici, decapitato da un pezzo di ferro che "casualmente" si trovava, in quel momento, sui binari, proprio quando passava il treno... <br>  <br>  nel terzo le morti sn più orrende rispetto al primo, x esempio quelle due ochette morte affumicate cm 2 acciughe mentre si facevano una lampada a temperatura altissima... (mah... sarà stato un caso che la mensola si sia conficcata tra i due coperchi delle lampade??)... poi c'è stato quell'intelligentone morto con la testa schiacciata mentre faceva tranquillamente i pesi in palestra... eppure l'avevano anche avvertito... ma secondo me la morte l'ha fatto morire così proprio xke diceva che la morte nn sarebbe riuscita ad ucciderlo... che fine orrenda... nel terzo, poi c'è quella cretina di istant star morta con i chiodi in testa sparati della pistola spara-chiodi del fidanzato (x giunta)... e infine c'era il fidanzato di istant star schiacciato dall'insegna enorme crollata proprio sopra di lui... aah!! e poi nn bisogna tralasciare l'amica della sorella della protagonista... allora, prima la sorella rischia di morire sgozzata con la corda del cavallo (che era inbizzarrito xke che due co.g.lion.cini gli avevano scoppiato un fuoco d'artificio vicino...) che la stava trascinando vicino a quella cosa dove si appoggiano le bici... l'amico della protagonista riesce a salvarla, ma nn fanno neanche in tempo a dire "bah" che una lancia si conficca nella pancia dell'amica della sorella, xke lei sarebbe morta dopo la sorella, ma siccome la sorella nn è morta è morta direttamente lei... in paradiso l'amica della sorella si starà mangiando le p.a.lle... insomma, l'unica cosa chiara in questi film è che alla fine tutti muoiono solo xke si sono salvati da morte certa, all'inizio del film, avendo un c.u.lo così... ciaooooxD<br>  <br>  e ricorda... "non puoi ingannare la morte."      <br>  by final destination2|`|UpXPs3HZaa	A me solo il 3 visto che alla fine morono sul serio i protagonisti!|`|d9834fb8123bd7c387441278c18b1507aa	A me è piaciuto di più il 2,poi primo e di meno il 3|`|iN3h8cVeaa	il primo e il secondo sono i migliori, il terzo è stato fatto per raccimolare soldi e ci è riuscito, è stato fatto male rispetto agli altri...non ha avuto tanto successo dopo l'uscita al cinema<br>  stupende le morti che capitano nei primi due film...peccato che nel secondo film l'attore Devon Sawa non abbia fatto parte del cast|`|waLcqbtNaa	2-1-3<br>  sono sanguinaria ghghghgh<br>  il 2 l'ho trovato favoloso: sangue ovunque e l'incidente iniziale davvero spettacolare<br>  l'1 molto carino e diciamo ha avviato per bene il senso della saga<br>  il 3 l'ho trovato un pelino più carente degli altri 2|`|2ef14de7fec995e63b420b03840504e0aa	A me è piaciuto molto il primo, il secondo non mi ha convinto granché ed il terzo non l' ho visto affatto!|`|9R1dswPWaa	1° final destination 2<br>  <br>  2° final destination 1<br>  <br>  3° final destination 3

XXhR1tx6aa	It depends.  If they are made with a delicate fabric then usually the fabric just will not stay the same-it will not fit the same, that is.  Also, if the garment has any kind of pretty beading, etc. on it, there is a good chance it will come off in the washer.<br>  <br>  Having said that, most of my 'hand wash only' things I just wash on the delicate cycle-and you can always get the Woolite and a delicates bag for washing.

(Non perchè mi stiano antipatiche).<br>  Leggi qui la descrizione di ragazza perfetta che lui ha, non mi sembra corrisponda a nessuna delle due:<br>  <br>  Che cosa dice Joe Jonas sugli appuntamenti e le ragazze?: "Mi piace una ragazza che non mi pressi troppo e che possa capire i miei pazzi orari. Voglio conoscere una ragazza che quando stia in un posto, non saluti solo le persone che lei crede che dovrebbe salutare, bensì a tutto il mondo, senza distinzione alcuna. Sto cercando anche qualcuno che sia divertente e rida delle mie barzellette - perfino se queste non sono divertenti. Sai una cosa? Mi piacciono le ragazze e mi piacciono gli appuntamenti . Che cosa può fare una ragazza affinché mi piaccia? Solo venire e dire ciao. Cioè essere lei stessa."<br>  <br>  E questi sono i consigli delle ragazze...<br>  <br>  Demi Lovato:  "Facciano ridere Joe. Joe è un gran fanatico delle commedie, quindi se puoi farlo ridere sei nella strada giusta. Non ho tentato mai di sedurrlo, quindi questa è una domanda molto difficile a cui posso rispondere, ma credo che il buon umore è la cosa migliore per conquistarlo. Fa' che sorrida!<br>  <br>  Meaghan Jette Martín: "Non parlargli di politica o qualcos'altro di pesante! Joe non è il tipo di ragazzo che gli piace essere serio, quindi mantieniti allegra e divertente. Joe è divertente e gli piace ridere, quindi fai qualunque cosa che possa farlo sorridere.<br>  <br>  Jasmine Richards:  "Che vestiti usare per conquistare a Joe? Non usare un vestito ne tacchi alti.  Se vi capita di avere un appuntamento con Joe, usate una maglietta dei Power Rangers ed alcuni shorts. Sentiti comoda. Questa è la chiave!<br>  <br>  Anna Maria Pérez di Tagle: "è importante essere se stessi e molto disinvolti. Joe ti mostrerà il bambino che è in lui , infatti a volte sembra come se avesse 3 anni rendendosi spiritoso. Lui vuole una ragazza con la quale possa mantenere una conversazione e che abbia molte cose dire, oltre a farlo ridere. Buona fortuna!<br>  <br>  Alyson Stoner:  "Quale è il miglior modo per conquistare Joe Jonas? Devi essere unica e non avere paura di affrontarlo. Quando si tratta di moda, credo che lui stia cercando qualcuno, che sappia quello che vuole e che non ha paura di esprimere i suoi sentimenti in un capo d'abbigliamento. Le persone interessanti e non persone che semplicemente rispondono con un si o un no. Lui vuole una ragazza che faccia la differenza!<br>  <br>  <br>  Nick, vediamo premettendo che non sopporto Miley scelgo Selena.<br>  Ciao.<br>  Andreina<br>  <br>  Qui ci sono anche altre persone: <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_s_W7Bj8cAuE/SGLIy8QnAvI/AAAAAAAAABU/eX6d_-bIJbA/S1600-R/DisneyStars.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_s_W7Bj8cAuE/SG...</a><br>  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3013/2732901931_fb3008a67e.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3013/2732...</a><br>  <a href="http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll177/SaveThePlanet201/5607060007a7579632289l.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll177...</a><br>  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3189/2746459282_3013733bc8.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3189/2746...</a><br>  <a href="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y285/butterfly888143/Jonas%20Brothers/n1315628361_9909_5405.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y285/bu...</a><br>  <br>  Di Miley + Chelsea non ho trovato nulla mi spiace.<br>  Ti mando singole foto:<br>  <a href="http://bittenandbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/miley-cyrus.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://bittenandbound.com/wp-content/upl...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mymostwanted.com/gallery/data/2892/miley-cyrus_dot_com-mtvtrl2006oct23-049.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mymostwanted.com/gallery/data...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.celebrity-gossip.net/images/thumbnails/miley-cyrus-timbaland-288-5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.celebrity-gossip.net/images/t...</a><br>  <a href="http://chelseastaubfans.com/gallery/displayimage.php?pid=452&fullsize=1" rel="nofollow">http://chelseastaubfans.com/gallery/disp...</a><br>  <a href="http://chelseastaubfans.com/gallery/displayimage.php?pid=392&fullsize=1" rel="nofollow">http://chelseastaubfans.com/gallery/disp...</a><br>  <br>  P.s: In ogni caso la ragazza devono sceglierla loro non noi e io sarò contenta in goni caso, basta che loro siano felici e lo sono anche io.

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	In 1935 (seven years after Walter's disappearance), David Clay—one of the boys assumed to have been killed—is found alive. He reveals that one of the boys with whom he was imprisoned was Walter. David, Walter and another boy escaped, but were separated. David does not know whether Walter was recaptured, giving Christine hope he is alive. But I think that he was recaptured and, subsequently, killed.<br>  <br>  I think that he was killed on the chicken ranch during the years of the so-called "Wineville Chicken Coop Murders". Since the L.A. police department did not have the advanced forensic technology like we have today, they were unable to identify all of the human remains that were discovered there on the ranch.|`|YHu1wXVRaa	Yeah that was a good movie. But I hope he just lived out the rest of his life in hiding, like maybe he was afraid that the psycho would come and get him if he came out of hiding. If he was still alive he would be about 90.|`|mO9AhiDgaa	That was an amazing movie and such a harsh thing for her to go through loosing her son that way i mean honestly he just disapeared one day.

bsnnEsp5aa	LOVELY COMPLEX (highly recommended) (romance, comedy, high school)<br>  Lovely Complex is a story of a boy and a girl. The girl, Koizumi Risa, is much taller than the average Japanese girl; and the boy, Atsushi Otani, is much shorter than the average Japanese boy. Due to their immense difference in size and constant bickering with each other, the duo is unwillingly the school’s comic relief. As Risa and Otani continue to provide endless laughter for the masses, their friendship develops; and with that, so does Risa’s feelings for Otani...<br>  <br>  CLANNAD (highly recommended) (romance, comedy, drama, harem, high school)<br>  Tomoya Okazaki is a third-year high school student who is generally bored with life and doesn't take his studies, future, or anything else seriously. One day, however, he meets a lonely-looking girl in the school courtyard, Nagisa Furukawa. She explains to him the source of her loneliness: she had missed a lot of the previous school year and thus is repeating her third year; everybody that she knew has already graduated, and she is lonely. Tomoya is rather indifferent at first, but decides that he has nothing better to do and spends increasingly more time helping Nagisa restore the school drama club. As his relationship with Nagisa grows, Tomoya begins to open up to various other people around the school as well...<br>  <br>  AISHITERUZE BABY (romance, slice of life, drama, high school)<br>  Whenever Kippei is at school, he has one thing on the mind: girls. From skipping class to cheesy lines, he'll do anything it takes to reel the ladies in, though he never seems to find the right person. But the bachelor lifestyle is soon to change when young Yuzuyu enters the picture. This five-year-old cutie has been abandoned by her mother, and is to be taken care of by none other than Kippei! Unfortunately for the both of them, Kippei has no experience raising a child, so the learning curve will be quite steep...<br>  <br>  HONEY & CLOVER (drama, romance, comedy, love triangle, art college)<br>  Art college: cradle of romance, home of bittersweet comedy. Takemoto is struggling to find his direction in life, while his roommates Morita and Mayama are moving confidently (or recklessly) towards their goals. Enter Hagu-chan, the childlike and beautiful prodigy whom everyone admires… and thus the love triangles begin. Honey & Clover explores the pain of first love, the trials of romantic conflict, and our loyalty to those annoying people who happen to be our closest friends…<br>  <br>  BLACK CAT (action, thriller, mystery)<br>  An organization known to the dark side of the world as Chronos claims to desire world peace, employing the top thirteen assassins in the world known as 'Erasers.' They each have a weapon customized to fit their style, all made out of orichalcum ore, the strongest material available on Earth. Number 13, Train Heartnet (codenamed Black Cat) is the most famous and revered of the thirteen Chronos numbers, but in the light of a tragic event he has come to question his path in life. Together with Sven Vollfied, a struggling bounty hunter and a living weapon named Eve, Train takes up a job as a bounty hunter - all the while running from the other Erasers and Creed Diskenth, a crazed man whom wants him to join the Apostles of the Stars, a group made to destroy Chronos.<br>  <br>  CHRNO CRUSADE (action, romance, supernatural, demons)<br>  It is the early 1920s, and New York City has a problem of evil proportions -- demons. With devil worshipping on the rise, foul spirits and monsters have begun to surface, causing fear and panic. Now, it is up to two members of Magdala Monastery's professional exorcist squad to help bring peace to the city, and destroy the demons with God's power (and bullets!). Join Chrno, a young demon, and Sister Rosette, his contractor, as they try to keep the city clean, while confronting the demons (no pun intended) of their past.<br>  <br>  PEACEMAKER KUROGANE (highly recommended) (samurai, action, drama, comedy, historical)<br>  Peace Maker Kurogane takes place in Kyoto in the late 19th century, during the height of the conflict between the Shinsengumi, a shogunal police force, and its enemy, an anti-government faction called the Choshu. This tale follows a young boy named Ichimura Tetsunosuke who is desperate to join the Shinsengumi and avenge his parents' deaths by the hands of the Choshu. But in the midst of the bloodshed, will he be strong enough to survive?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :D|`|zJ2GKkwAaa	*Clannad<br>  *Itazura Kiss|`|h7CvumEmaa	have you seen pita ten?  that was really funny i thought.

enC9TvxUaa	-I am 42, and even I was uncomfortable with some of the violence, rape scenes, and full frontal nudity!  I am not a pride, but the could have left out some, no a lot, of it and ot spoiled the movie at all.  When the blue man's privates are on the scrren- several times and for several minutes- you will probably be uncomfortable!  The rape and killing scenes- just too much for a super-hero movie!!!|`|2dd22446424b9019f02a884f4efe9b5baa	You will both be a bit uncomfortable - as there are a couple of graphic sex scenes, a rape scene, and Dr. Manhattans blue penis waves around everywhere for half the movie.<br>  <br>  Not a bad movie though|`|RJbm7hkmaa	The theater that i went to had little kids YES little kids watching this movie it made me feel how bad these parents were <br>  <br>  if you dont want your dad being with you just tell him to pay for your ticket then he gives it to you then go inside by your self or with some friends|`|Pa1rzBwwaa	WATCH IT ONLINE NOW 4 FREE<br>  <br>  <a href="http://watchingfilmsonline.blogspot.com/2009/03/watchmen.html" rel="nofollow">http://watchingfilmsonline.blogspot.com/...</a>|`|w2Dui70Faa	The movie is very graphic.
