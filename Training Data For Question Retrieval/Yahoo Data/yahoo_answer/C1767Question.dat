Yes she gave birth to 8 babies. That is her business. why are people be so immature and judgemental. Its not like you have to take care any one of them babies. They are not your responsiblities. Instead of judging her, pray that the babies are nurtured and provided for. That they grow up without any mental or physical delays.

20090309134453AATOoaP	News & Events;Current Events	With unemployment set to soar to 3.2 million next year, how secure are you?	The British Chambers of Commerce said manufacturing will fall "sharply", capital investment by firms will "plunge", while the state of the economy has deteriorated "significantly" since January.      The group said the second half of next year was looking particularly dire.      Around 10% of the workforce can expect to have lost their jobs.      BCC chief economist David Kern added: "UK prospects have worsened significantly since our last forecast in January.      "We are now predicting much larger UK GDP declines. Consequently, we now expect bigger unemployment increases and larger budget deficits.      "Unless the huge falls in UK capital investment are halted and reversed, the UK's productive potential will be seriously weakened."      So do these figures mean anything to you, are you worried or do you think your job is safe?       http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Busines...

20090309143701AA8O6EO	News & Events;Current Events	How angry would you get if you couldn't get tickets to see your favourite band?	A gig by heavy metal band Iron Maiden has ended in tears in Colombia after ticketless fans desperate to hear their heroes began to riot.      Over 100 people were arrested on Saturday as clashes broke out in the Colombian capital city Bogota, several hours before the band was due to play.      Police fired tear gas canisters at those who tried to enter the concert grounds without purchasing tickets.      Colombian media reported one police officer was hit when fans started throwing rocks.      Police officer Rolando Arturo Girata spoke from his hospital bed, saying he had been transferred there after being struck in the face.      Iron Maiden manager Rod Smallwood said only a minority of fans were involved and called on authorities not to react by banning metal acts.      He told Sky News Online:"We abhor the inane behaviour of a small minority of people outside.      "They do Iron Maiden, metal and the real Colombian fans a disservice and sadly just provide a reason for the military to feel they need to be there.      "Our fans are there for the MUSIC. We definitely intend to return to Colombia and trust the authorities will not be swayed to banning Maiden and metal because of a minority of troublemakers spoiling it for the huge majority of true Iron Maiden fans.".......
