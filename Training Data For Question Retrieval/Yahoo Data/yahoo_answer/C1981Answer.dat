ac2d71a2bc454f739dc19101f9eb7365aa	I think it depends on what you need the phone for really. If you tend to spend a lot of time on the phone then landlines are the way to go since they offer a flat rate per month and you don't have to worry about going over your minutes. But, if you tend to call people that are farther away and like to be able to call no matter where you are then cell phones are the way to go. I chose to get a cell phone instead of a land line. My mother-in-law lives two states away, so when I'm talking to her it's much cheaper to call her from my cell phone than it would be if I had a land line and called her from it regardless of how long we stay on the phone. <br>  <br>  Really though I think that unless you have more than one reason for a land line (i.e. don't want people to be able to call you when you aren't home, plan on getting dial-up internet, etc.), they aren't really any better than a cell phone anymore. You can get a decent cell phone plan for the same price as a land line and be able to use your phone when and where ever you want instead of having to be home to use it, and except for a few weak spots cell phone coverage is available pretty much everywhere now.|`|AA11887522	get a track phone, they are pretty cheap, almost the cheapest you can get, land lines and other cell phones vary from company to company.|`|ZHRpV3iGaa	Landline, you don;t have to connect wirelessly or have anithing bouce of satel;ittes. Simplay 1 very long complicated wire|`|rpbY3xjtaa	vonage can be the cheapest but you need broadband Internet.<br>  <br>  Cell phone is the most practical for the money. Most people get the land line and then 6 months latter they get the cell phojne and end up paying two bills. just get the cell phone and pay one bill $40 a month or so.|`|d13e28ec0f8488f329d563f0d92c0860aa	Landline.  But of course that's the only place you can get calls to and from.<br>  If that's the way you go, you can get long distance for 2.5Cents/min without monthly charges through <a href="http://www.ecg1.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecg1.com</a><br>  IF you have broadband access there, check lingo.com (VoIP).

I mean the iPhone has so many capabilites despite being a music player, but it won't be able to hold many songs seeing that most of its' memory is taken up by all the other hi-tech stuff. But there's also been a lot of complaints about the iPhone like the keyboard is not satisfactory and how it's only registered with AT&T's EDGE, which some say isn't a very good network. But I say get a Zune all the same, because you can get a better iPhone in a couple of months, because Apple is always improving their products, and a Zune is cheaper. Just look at all the models and generations of iPods and Mac Books...so I would wait and spend my money on a better iPhone that would eventually be the same price as it is now...so hope I helped...Happy B-day to your brother!|`|T9TICji3aa	I think an iphone would be going all the way it is such a cool good looking phone, but it's a phone.

Tell your brother happy b-day, and get him whatever you think he needs and or wants.

I found that out after 8 hours with customer service (over the period of a week).<br>  <br>  Since they did not tell me, they screwed me over all the minutes on my plan and all the money in my flex account. I have not been able to use my phone for two weeks, and still won't be able to until my service renews in two days (on the 7th). I have used it for free for the last six months. Now they have screwed me over and I have to suck it up or leave T-Mobile.<br>  <br>  I am so mad. I think this justifies a lawsuit. I will let this be known across the internet!!!<br>  _____________________________________

The only phone I can recall being sold out the first day was the iPhone. And I got the last one in Dallas on the first day it was out.|`|m2iQcSQZaa	I would highly doubt that it sells out, unless it is a super hot selling phone. You may be best to buy one online, most places are quite fast with their shipping.|`|2ntUrHyBaa	complete mobiles talk just in <br>  <a href="http://www.mobilemore.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mobilemore.blogspot.com</a>|`|w0RZKqXOaa	Get someone to buy for you.  Believe it or not, there might be pre-orders and some might even sold to other people already.
GkCWAurLaa	Where do you want the sound to come out? You can input that into any box with an avilable audio input with RCA jacks, and speakers out. Portable Radios usually have them , home theaters, TV's, etc. If you want it out your computer speakers, you can buy a cable with RCA jacks on one side and a single prong on the other you can plug into your microphone input on your computer. Good luck.|`|AA10287427	If your monitor does not have built in speakers you can't get the audio that way. You can go directly to your speakers ( you may need 2 plug converters to match the RCA plugs to the speaker plugs) or you can run the audio through your computer to the speakers. You may even be able to run the whole thing through your computer by plugging the red and white wires in to your sound card and the yellow in to your video card.

SBLHtsOaaa	Yes. As long as you add $20 every 3 months, your good. If you didn't use any money in those 3 months you only have to add money so you don't loose your phone number. Say it was at the three month point and you hadn't used any of the other money, you HAVE to add money, but don't loose the old money either. You would end up with $40. But if you didn't top-up (add money) then you'd end up with the original $20 "expiring" and you loose your phone number.|`|9bff631837763463b100c78a151d1035aa	yes your new minutes will add on to the ones you already had.|`|PwI3rPCwaa	yes

VrCCTCwmaa	a metal shop should be able to. There are some stores specifically designed for engraving stuff like plaques etc... Might try calling some of those places.|`|BZIscz2Qaa	I have no idea.  If u had ordered it directly off apple's website, you could've gotten it shipped to u with it already engraved.  <br>  <br>  Engraving lowers the resale value of ur iPod also if u ever plan on upgrading.  
q1bS5Bk5aa	The best way is to sign up for a rewards site, but do some research on them before you do. I was skeptical, especially since my credit card number would be out there, but TRAINN is a very reputable website and has been covered by CNN and NBC as legit. Yes, some of those reward-style sites are legit. Here's the short version of how companies give away "free" stuff. The companies who offer trials pay the company for each offer someone from their site completes. So, when someone does Netflix, Netflix then pays that website money for the referral. The money made more than covers the cost of whatever reward you select. Don't think the companies are being nice, they are making quite a bit of cash from these deals.<br>  <br>  Websites will send things like game systems and iPods as rewards. That is true, but what is misleading is the whole "free" aspect. No, it's not 100% free. They couldn't make money if it were. When you sign up, you agree to complete one offer to activate your account. Offers are around $10 on average. From there, you have to find family and friends to be referrals for other offers so you can have them count towards your prize.<br>  <br>  Also, beware of people (lots of them around here) that claim they have "hacked" versions of the rewards sites that require no credit card from you. What they give you is a link with their referral number, so you go do an offer thinking you'll get a reward and, shockingly, nothing happens for you. However, their reward just got closer thanks to your referral!<br>  <br>  The bottom line is you need to research the sites and determine which is the best site for your needs. Personally, I use sites under TRAINN's umbrella as they seem the easiest to deal with. There are some good groups on Facebook that are made up of users of those sites. A good one in particular is a group called "Shortest TRAINN Conga Line" on Facebook. They offer advice and answers about how the sites work and tactics to get stuff quickly. You can also get in the Conga Line for easy referrals|`|0uoxGDn1aa	Honestly, You should try a freebie site. Get your parents to let you use their credit card, sign up for an offer, refer a couple of people and you can get it for free. Even with an offer, you still walk off paying like $2 for a brand new Ipod. It's how I've done it a couple of times, getting referrals isn't as difficult as one might think. <br>  <br>  Good luck and you should use my link!|`|tm4mmm2Waa	Earning it is free.|`|d903c96f4faf72eacf033aff8ec2fea9aa	U AV NICE FAMILY MEMBERS OR UR DAD.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Well you have no choice.

XdtS0Mrzaa	You might have to search for a new connection. It sometimes happens with computers, with mine anyways. First, you should unplug your router for about 30 seconds, then replug it, and try to connect with your Xbox. If its still being funny, search for a new connection. If your wireless has WEP security or something like that, you need to enter the security code when it prompts for it while connecting to the new connection. Its usually your phone number unless your changed it.<br>  <br>  Try searching for a new connection if unplugging does not work. Sometimes the frequencies get overlapped and go past each other, so unplugging should work.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
lkqjJisaaa	U should check your battery and charger.  Either your battery isn't holding a charge or your charger isn't charging it fully.  That's the most likely explanation.
w7Ffw6MYaa	Nope, its not a touchscreen. It has buttons on a full QWERTY keyboard which slides from the side of the phone (landscape orientation). This is NOT a dual slider phone, so in order to dial a number you will have to use the QWERTY keyboard. It also has the standard volume rocker, camera key, etc. A nice addition is music keys for the MP3 player on the top of the phone. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps =)|`|MEusplxhaa	It's not a touch screen and it does have buttons. The phone also can only slide on its side (not a dual-slider).|`|1a25a30b0fd9f9c2f744041ef4826fa7aa	Pretty sure it's not touch screen. Virgin Mobile doesn't offer phones that expensive. It's probably got a keypad that slides out and the large screen is to make it more visually pleasing as an MP3 player.
VB94J4i4aa	It depends on your digital box.<br>  If it is HD, then it is 16:9. Almost all display boxes are HD.<br>  If it is not HD, then it will be 4:3.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	4:3 for NON-HD<br>  16:9 for HD|`|AA11525080	My converter let's you choose between 4:3 and16:9.
4ef759a72bd240232f7647985dcd2818aa	Things take time.<br>  <br>  Remember, there's always an obligation to be completed. And that's whether your ID proof and the rest of the documents are geniune or not. Moreover a copy needs to be submitted to the Government.<br>  <br>  If u took a prepaid, the above step is for you.<br>  <br>  If u took a postpaid, the above step + address verification is mandatory. The service provider want to be absolute sure, whether u have the capability to pay up or not or, may refuse when the bill arrives.<br>  <br>  Or probably the documents are still lying with the dealer / franchisee and he forgot to forward them.<br>  <br>  The customer care executives will be unable to help u as u aren't a subscriber in their systems yet.|`|99cYmmfdaa	just go to AIRCEL shopp they will immidiety activate your SIM

In Argentina, the code might be *31# (landlines) or *31* (most cell phone companies). In the United Kingdom and Ireland, 141 is the equivalent code. Australia uses 1831. New Zealand uses 0197, in NZ you can also request Telecom to permanently disable your caller ID. Hong Kong uses 133. Israel uses *43. In Denmark and Switzerland *31* is used to hide the one's called ID; the same code is used to reveal your caller ID if you have your number set-up as a permanent disable. Other countries and networks may vary. On GSM mobile networks, callers may dial #31# [11] before the number they wish to call to disable it.

I assume that he fire wire cards are showing that they are ok in the device manager!<br>  <br>  1 If you can take your camcorder to a friends and plug it into their system, if it does not work then its probably down to the cable, or camcorder change the cable if it works then thats your problem, if it does not then its the camcorder (does not happen very often) <br>  <br>  2 If both work then there is a problem with your system, both of the firewire ports, return the new card and get another one. <br>  <br>  2b check to see if there are problems with the firewire card and Windows XP<br>  <br>  3 check to see if there is any issues with the camcorder and windows XP. <br>  <br>  If all else fails and everything is ok then it may be a windows system problem, I would do a full reload (Format clean install back up your data) and see if that sorts it out.

I have all songs at 320 kbps (if it aint 320, I don’t want it because quality is key for me). I have all my albums ripped on to a 1 tb hard drive and my music alone takes up close to 115 gigs. So I can only add the best of my music on to my pod. If you have a huge library like me I suggest you ditch the 80 and get the 160. I’m not going to buy the 160 because I hear their might be a 1tb ipod after this year.<br>  <br>  And to the guy who says you can do a lot more like adding nes snes psx emulations..I think you need a girl friend buddy...

60a063fb25d466da391924829b47c782aa	If you take an existing MP3 and reencode it to a higher bitrate, it will sound the same.  You're just using more filespace to say the same thing as before.  To benefit from a higher bitrate encoding, you'd need to rip it from the original source file (like a CD) or from a copy with higher bitrates that what you want to acheive (eg a 640 bitrate file being compressed down to 320).  Otherwise, it's like trying to squeeze water back into a sponge.|`|121bd34e5be6cf9632868ab21d89e5b7aa	it won't improve the sound quality since you'll be compressing an already compressed file. if anything, it would degrade the sound even more although the difference won't be that noticeable.|`|f7304d0a9ae9a1287b72c884c298afc7aa	Yes, if there was a way to make bitrates higher than it normally was. You can make bitrates lower, but not higher. But a 320 kpbs does sound better than a 56 kpbs. However, the sound quality increase might be negligible depending on the sensitivity of your ears and the song. Maximum PC has done a test on this with five people. They had to guess the bitrate of their songs as well as the other five people's songs' bitrates. Some of them could find no difference while others could tell the difference. It depends. Also, the bitrate will affect how much space it takes up on your computer or mp3, so if you can't tell the difference, I recommend staying with a lower bitrate. But try to stay above 128 or 192 kpbs if possible.

3CJAUyqPaa	rugratzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz is correct - but keep in mind that "fragility" is only one technical problem with hard disc drive (HDD) based camcorders.<br>  <br>  The four issues that also count (at least in my book):<br>  <br>  1) HDD cannot handle prolonged, high levels, of vibration. The source of the vibration can be loud audio - loud music (whether amplified or not); loud crowds, loud engine noise... even vibration from a vehicle's passenger compartment if the camera is not mounted properly to shield the camcorder from that vibration. The result is the HDD heads will park in an effort to protect the HDD platters. The workaround is to disable the drop-sensor (which can result in a crashed hard drive) or remove the camcorder from the vibration (which can result in no video capture opportunity). If you continue to try capturing video in the high vibration environment, the camera will report a "Buffer Overflow" error message and not record.<br>  <br>  2) High altitude (generally over 9,800 feet) usually results in very low air pressure. The hard drive head needs air to "fly" over the platters. When air pressure is too low, this cannot happen. The camcorder will not work. The resolution is to remove the camcorder from the low air pressure environment - which means you could miss the video you wanted to capture.<br>  <br>  Neither flash memory nor miniDV tape have these vibration or altitude problems.<br>  <br>  3) Consumer HDD based camcorders save their video files to very highly compressed MPEG2 (sometimes modified MPEG2) standard definition files - or if high definition, a very highly compressed consumer version of "AVCHD" (MTS) file types. Since video compression = discarded data = reduced video quality, and this happens at the first step, anything past this can never be "best available video quality". For that, you need to start with less compression. In the consumer space, this means DV for standard definition or HDV for high definition. In the consumer space, this means miniDV tape. Even the external hard drives and flash memory the pros use write to DV and HDV (Focus Enhancements' FireStore; Panasonic HVX200 P2 cards). There are a couple of AVCHD- based pro-grade camcorders from Panasonic - but there compression rate is not as severe as the consumer version AVCHD (24mbps vs 17mbps). Consumer flash memory camcorders use these same consumer video data file formats.<br>  <br>  4) What are you expecting to use to archive the video captured by the HDD camcorder? What happens if you have not transferred video from the HDD and the camcorder is broken or stolen? With miniDV tape, if you do not re-use the tape, that tape is the archive - fill the tape, take it out, lock it, put in another tape, resume capture. Flash memory is not an acceptable archive media, but fill the memory card, take it out, lock it, put in another card, resume capture, applies. If the camcorder is stolen, you are out only the memory card or tape you left in it - not potentially hours of video captured to the hard drive. If the camcorder is broken, typically, take the tape or card out and use another equivalent camcorder - with HDD, that internal drive is not easily removeable - and you want to know that DriveSavers can recover your data, but they are expensive (maintaining clean rooms is not cheap).<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|42tTsVuxaa	lets just say I wouldn't want to bang one very hard. Ok in a camcorder they are protected by lots of plastic, so that will help. 3g isn't very much, don't take it on a fair ride, most exceed that. <br>  <br>  As long as you don't trow it about you should be ok<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  RR

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Mega pixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches. Click links below for more details.<br>  <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=398&pq-locale=en_US&_requestid=2039" rel="nofollow">http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h...</a> ...<br>   <br>  The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices.

It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.  <br>  <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A590IS/A590ISA.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-powershot-8-0-megapixel.html" rel="nofollow">http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po...</a> ...  <br>   <br>  You may never need expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, but the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera.

3CJAUyqPaa	From the camcorder's perspective you are asking about the difference between the "AV-out" and "AV-in" capabilities of the camcorder.<br>  <br>  The AV-out can be used to connect a camcorder directly to a TV so the TV can monitor what the camcorder sees. Pretty much all camcorders have this capability. That is what you have done. AV-Out is also used to playback recorded video in the camcorder and display that playback on a TV (or copy to a VCR).<br>  <br>  SOME (very few) camcorders have the option to act as a VCR with an "AV-in" feature. Most TVs do not have an AV-out to feed the camcorder's AV-in. You might be able to connect the camcorder AV-in to a VCR's AV-out... What many folks want to do these days is record game play off a console - that requires using a Y-cable - one leg of the Y plugs into the game consol's AV-out; one leg of the Y connects to the TV and the last leg of the Y connects to the camcorder's AV-in.<br>  <br>  You did not tell us which camcorder manufacturer or model number, so we have no way to research whether your camcorder can do AV-in. Most camcorders do not have this capability. You did not tell us which TV manufacturer or model number, so we have no way to research whether your TV has AV-out.

XiLco8XXaa	I've had my battles with AT&T and this is how I won<br>  <br>  1. Call them and tell them the story (again). If the person doesn't wish to issue credit then don't get mad at him/her. He's doing his job and doesn't have authority so then speak to his manager. Tell the manager your story (don't assume the representative sided with you when you told your story!)<br>  <br>  If they can't help then  <br>  1. Tell them about your previous month's bills and how you were not charged and this charge was unauthorized and should never have been placed on your account. AND IF AT&T did change their billing procedures or methods then they are required by law to keep you with your contractual pricing plan and agreement.<br>  <br>  If that fails, thank the Manager for his time and inform him that you will contact the BBB (Better Business Bureau) and that you refuse to pay the disputed amount until it's resolved.<br>  <br>  Then contact the BBB and a high level executive (or his secretary) will contact you and resolve the issue. Usually at this point, they give you what you want if it's reasonable.

If you want really good quality video, go to Ebay or a local pawn shop, get an older camcorder that might have a defective tape deck, but the camera is still working.  Hook it up with RCA cables ( $12 for a 50ft cable )to your internet connected computer at work, and this program will email you the video when motion triggers it ( wireless is so noisy ).  Or you can send commands via email to your work, and the program will start or stop recording.  You can connect from 1 to 16 cameras.

UHC4IJH6aa	There are many music download sites and software, but the best FREE, LEGAL, and SAFEST site/software I have used is Nexus Radio: <a href="http://www.nexusradio.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nexusradio.com</a><br>  <br>  It is 100% free and they have a bunch of music you can search and download. I have not found any other free or paid software that has as many features as Nexus Radio.<br>  <br>  I have been using it for over a year without any problems.<br>  <br>  First download the software. Now just open the Nexus Radio software and click the "On-Demand" tab. Enter the name of the artist/song in the search box and click search. Songs you download go directly to your "My Saved Files" folder located: C:\My Saved Files.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: Never use limewire, Frostwire, or Bearshare...those networks are riddled with viruses and are heavily monitored for illegal file sharing!|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	nexus radio. limewire.|`|uH5eYdLqaa	Free music is illegal. <br>  <br>  Try somewhere like <a href="http://www.mp3obsession.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mp3obsession.com/</a> - songs are only 9c each. <br>  <br>  I know your mum won't let you buy music, but it's surely better to pay 9c a song than get caught downloading it illegally and being sued for millions???|`|3fLiqJYVaa	Torrents!<br>  Download this: <a href="http://www.utorrent.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.utorrent.com/</a><br>  <br>  Once installed, search for torrents here: <a href="http://www.mininova.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mininova.org/</a><br>  <br>  Or here:<a href="http://thepiratebay.org/" rel="nofollow">http://thepiratebay.org/</a><br>  <br>  Or here:<a href="http://coda.fm/" rel="nofollow">http://coda.fm/</a><br>  <br>  You'll find complete albums in different formats (mp3, wma, flac, etc).  For single songs,  you may find them if they're popular.  Otherwise you can find the song within an album and choose to just download that.  Simply click on Download Torrent on one of the sites, choose to open with utorrent, then utorrent will give you a window asking where you want to save your download.  Choose a location then uncheck the songs/files you don't want to download.  Then just let the download complete and you're done!  This is P2P so downloads can take time depending on how many people are sharing it.<br>  <br>  There's Limewire or Frostwire also, but I'd stay away from that, even though there are usually no viruses in audio files (Stay away from any windows formats like wma/wmv.  Look at link at the bottom).  I got a virus through a temporary file that limewire used/created.<br>  <br>  If you find what you're looking for but it's not a format that ipod can read (you'll want mp3 usually), you'll need an audio converter.  For FLAC files, you'll need FLAC Fronted: <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html" rel="nofollow">http://flac.sourceforge.net/download.htm...</a><br>  Or get winamp to play them.|`|JiBEGG0Oaa	Go to www.bittorrent.com and get the downloader(its free) <br>  Then go to <a href="http://www.thepiratebay.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thepiratebay.org/</a> to get torrents(compressed files) and download them with bittorrent(also free) I've never got a virus from there either!

But there is another way to get free or almost free music. Trade your cds that you are tired of with a friend that way you both end up with different music.

9KJWIXTRaa	we have sold Wii systems to schools (K-12, college level), day care, boys/girls clubs, health care, elder communities and public libraries.  health/exercise plus social interaction are clear educational benefits.  there are also games which focus on more academic areas - (ie brain academy)...generally all Wii games are designed to challenge players with a problem solving/reward format...kind of like the real world :-)|`|BjDBXyROaa	well it depends, the system itself meh, but all it will takes is for someone to make a game based on education, or for someone to use the wii motion+ for a sports type game. so you will have to correct your self and not the game.|`|ilbMPWmzaa	the wii fit is, fitness wise.|`|ahuFrmWQaa	there are some games that have to do with education on the wii like :<br>  Big Brain Academy Wii Degree<br>  Smarty Pants<br>  Wizardology <br>  Dragonology|`|q6uyloYdaa	It has a couple of educational games (like Big Brain Academy), but overall, no.

The games dissapoint me and the online.<br>  <br>  Ps3 is way better|`|KbxPl1oYaa	It's a lot of fun... esp. when you first get it... Unfortunately... being a grown up (yup, and still love games)... they don't have enough games geared to my age bracket.<br>  <br>  So I got a PS3 about 9 months later.|`|j17IpQ1oaa	The Wii is awesome!|`|5HfuI3MEaa	awesome.|`|xwEPYEqSaa	I got Wii for Christmas in 2006 I loved it. The Virtual Console was awesome, the games were awesome and the motion sensor was awesome. Last summer I totally lost interst in Wii. I had beaten Twilight Princess, Galaxy, Smash Bros Brawl and No More Heroes. So then I was left with nothing good to play. I still have my Wii but I have since moved on to Playstation 3 which is better designed, better graphics, better use of motion sensor, better Virtual Console (not ridiculously over priced) and a bigger and better game library. I was wowed by the FPS's on Wii like Metroid Prime and Call of Duty 3 but when I played Killzone 2, Resistance and Haze. I never wanted to play Wii FPS's anymore. I would sell my Wii but I still like to play SSB Brawl and House of the Dead from time to time. But the PS3 is now around 85% of my gaming. <br>  <br>  In 2006 I would have given Wii a 5/5 rating now I would give it a 2/5.
zmrHJAUWaa	With Verizon, you will not be able to use iTunes with your Blackberry Storm. You need to get the program, Microsoft ActiveSync, with this program, you basically can get inside your phone and mess with the files, programs, etc. I have this at my house, so I can just let you borrow it.<br>  <br>  You can also do things such as add ringtones, full length music tracks, games, and picture very very easily.<br>  <br>  They are laggy from what I hear, but I believe they do have a task manager in the phone to where you can shut down applications so they dont slow your phoen down.<br>  <br>  Yes, you can get on any website you want with Internet on a Blackberry Storm because of the browser that it has.<br>  <br>  Dont sell your iPod 30GB, as much as you call and text, playing music on the Blackberry will kill your battery very quickly.|`|4cMuedpWaa	Jordan said : <With Verizon, you will not be able to use iTunes with your Blackberry Storm. You need to get the program, Microsoft ActiveSync><br>  <br>  First of all, it's NOT about using iTunes with the Blackberry Storm. It's about putting the music he has in his iTunes into the Storm WHICH can be easily done by connecting the Storm (with the memory card inserted) to the Mac via USB and simply copying the mp3 to the memory card.<br>  <br>  Second, WOW, since when ActiveSync works on a Mac ? NEVER.<br>  <br>  Get your facts straight, Jordan before giving wrong information.<br>  <br>  And for you asking about getting on Yahoo answers from your Storm, yes, you will be able to browse basically any website with your Blackberry Storm.<br>  <br>  And keep your iPod as it beats the crap out of the Storm in terms of mp3 player and it also will allow you NOT to waste battery on your Storm.
fxF2oraPaa	All game consoles overheat, but the wii overheats less than the xbox, but a little more than the playstation. But wii sucks anyway, so just go out and buy a playstation|`|ilbMPWmzaa	call nintendo and see what they suggest. i believe they have a 1-800 number. they would know best, and give you the best advice.|`|jKc7aDCwaa	That sounds like overheating. About all you can do is try buying a fan for it and see if it helps. It's possible with the ice pack and a fan helping, you might get some more play time in, but I'd contact Nintendo and get as much offloaded to SD card as possible in preparation for shipping it in. You shouldn't have to do that to keep playing and more than likely, the problem's just going to get worse or fry it and make you get it repaired eventually anyways.<br>  <br>  One tip, you might want to check Circuit City in your area if they're still open. I went a few weeks back and got a Nexxtech brand fan for the Wii for like $3.50 (normally $10) and they had a ton of them still in stock.|`|BjDBXyROaa	what is he talking about, <br>  <br>  anyways how? I play for over 15 hours most days not straight ofcourse and no problems ether you bought a faulty Wii or it's not getting the ventilation it needs, other then that you don't need a fan.  my Wii system is on all day and don't get warm or cuts off.  just go out and trade for another.

k0BF9M0Haa	Well what you want to do first is go to your settings --> wifi --> then tap on "netgear".<br>  <br>  If you placed a password on it then you'll have to type that it in to access it, otherwise your iPod should connect on its own.<br>  <br>  Doing that a little "online" symbol thingy (the three/four dash lines) at the top left corner should appear to let you know that you're connected. Then exist out of settings and then have fun surfing on safari :]<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|5x6zzvDFaa	Have you set it up under settings (the gray one on your home screen) go to wifi (another grey one) select you wifi network. If you have a password enter it and you should be good to go!|`|lJjNNalHaa	If you have it set up right, you just go to Settings- Wifi- and then you just click your router.
jKc7aDCwaa	Are you sure you're putting the correct WEP key into the Wii when you've got it turned on in the router and try connecting? The correct key should either be 10 or 26 hexadecimal characters, and if it lists 4 keys, the first one is usually the best to go with. Does the laptop just not see the router when you've got WEP turned off? Usually laptops are more forgiving when it's turned off... you may want to check the below links for suggestions on resolving your error.
TwIK4Ivlaa	It should be water-tight without the 'tripod socket' (though I won't bet on it). It's anyway designed to be removed for attaching to the flash. More important is to check the gaskets and get them lubricated if they are dry and replaced if they are worn out. The lens mount is the main part that locks the 'whole' camera and so this needs to be cared for.<br>  <br>  For more information go to any old photography store and they might be able to help you.

VPnCk2Muaa	Microsoft just came out with new technology to almost completely get rid of the RROD, so more than likely, they just threw away your old Xbox and sent you the better, updated one.|`|3d97e0903de2c4ce8a8b79492024ff4aaa	They rarely if ever send you the same console. Most of the time it is replaced with a refurbished console. If you will notice your serial number for the console has changed.<br>  <br>  Also I live pretty close to the repair center in Texas and got a differnet console back after about 3 days.|`|WEaoTNQAaa	I know a woman who sent her Xbox in for repairs and got it back in about a week. I sent mine in and recieved mine back in two weeks. My experience with them as that they are fairly quick in getting it back to you. As for if they replaced it, I wouldn't know. Did your Xbox have anything on it like a scratch, scuff or paintjob that would identify it from a new Xbox?
qGfAlDd2aa	It depends on your cable system and how it's set up.  Many cable systems are designed so that the subscriber must use there box to access all the channels, especially premium channels like movies and PPV.|`|dqzoEw67aa	You'd want to change an SD cable box for an HD cable box because the SD box does not have the cable outputs necessary for component (red/green/blue) or HDMI cables to connect it to your tv.  Without those two types of cable, the box can transmit only SD not HD.<br>  <br>  And the HD box is normally the same price per month as the SD box, or maybe $5.00 more at most, so it's definitely worth it.|`|sER6UGMWaa	yes it is recommended to upgrade to the HD service... thats pretty dumb if you get a new tv and not get the best picture out of it and not upgrade

hJP9y6kjaa	I assume you mean Dmsus2, right?<br>  <br>  No such thing. <br>  <br>  Sus2 = "suspended 2nd", which means that the third has been removed from the chord and replaced with the 2nd, which is a more "neutral" interval. Since the 3rd is what tells us the tonality of a chord (major or minor), if it's been suspended then the chord is no longer major or minor.<br>  <br>  Written out -<br>  <br>  Dm  -       D F A<br>  Dsus2  -  D E A<br>  <br>  D - F  = minor third. this means that this chord is a minor chord<br>  D - E = major second, which is a neutral interval. Neither major nor minor.<br>  <br>  The other type of suspension is a "sus4", and in this case would be spelled<br>  <br>  Dsus4  -  D G A<br>  <br>  One of the reasons that these chords are a little ambiguous is because they sound like each other. For instance<br>  <br>  Dsus2  =  D E A       Asus4 =   A D E<br>  Dsus4  =  D G A       Gsus2  =  G A D<br>  <br>  Do you see how the same notes apply to each chord? We tell the difference by how the chord is voiced and from the context - if the bass is playing a D note, then we'll hear " D E A " as Dsus2, but if other instruments are playing A then we're more likely to hear it as Asus4.<br>  <br>  <br>  Music theory. Good times.  =)<br>  <br>  Saul

If you owned a 35 mm SLR or DSLR system, then you can buy a body only and all your lenses will work with them as long as you by a body that matches your existing system.  The past five camera bodies I purchased were purchased, "body only".<br>  <br>  <br>  P&S cameras are a different animal all together.  There is no benefit to selling a camera without its components.|`|tHjBr4L4aa	As I read your question, you still have all the accessories to your lost Powershot, but just want to buy the camera.  The question title originally made me think you wanted a camera body, but not the lens.<br>  <br>  You might find an original body only on your local Craigslist, or through a deal with a camera store.  But you probably won't save much over the price of a complete camera package.<br>  <br>  I'd advise this.  Find your best deal on the Powershot, or other camera of your choice.  Then offer your battery and charger on Craigslist or Ebay.  Amazingly, there are many people who misplaced those parts are would be very glad to buy them from you.<br>  <br>  OR, having an extra battery is never a bad thing.  And a backup charger (for traveling?) could be a lifesaver.

0q7Wiiliaa	Gain skill without losing money <br>  Use the following trick if you do not have a lot of money and want to buy goods or an object to gain more skill to get a promotion. Buy the particular goods that will help you for a promotion (for example, an exercise machine, or book shelf) and study the knowledge (for example, cleaning). When you get a skill point, delete the item that you bought (sell it before 24 hours have elapsed). You will a get full refund back from that object. If you sell after 24 hours, you will get less money. By doing this, you will gain your skill without losing your money.<br>  <br>  Buy expensive houses <br>  Use the following trick if you want your average Sim to buy a house that is above his or her means. First start a family or load one, and find an empty lot. Move the Sim on that lot. Enable the "motherlode" code a few times, just to the point where you can buy the expensive house. Exit the lot, but save the game. Then, evict (move out) the family. Notice that your family is displayed at the "Choose Family" window. You can now buy any house desired.<br>  <br>  Quick money <br>  Get a friendship with a rich Sim (girl recommended). Ask them to to move in. The Sim will bring at least 20,000 Simoleons with them. The money will be added in your account. Then, you can make him or her move out.<br>  <br>  No job <br>  When you first move into your new house (especially if you have any kids or plan to, or if you have the Popularity, Knowledge, Family, or Romance Aspiration), do not get a job. If your Sim has a Family Aspiration, then keep it at home to potty train, teach to work, or talk your toddler. If you have Romance, you must keep up with them woohoos. Knowledge may require you to get a job, but it probably will not be a power want. Popularity aspirations will keep you home making friends (unless they work); stay at home and take care of your Sim, their family, and their aspirations.<br>  <br>  Never pay bills <br>  Go to buy or build mode and use the hand tool.

Reflective light meters can be fooled because at the extreme ends, dark, dark gray or very light whites (like sand or snow), they attempt to render the scene at 18% gray, so shooting coal may give you a gray chunk of coal and shooting snow, may render it gray as well.<br>  <br>  Sekonic makes one of the most used incident light meters by motion picture DP's and studio photographers.

FKJAnOhSaa	I've had my Sony Ericsson Z530i for 3 days and it keeps shutting off.
9NfLuHo9aa	What you prob can do is to have him get the email address he sent the e-mail too and bait the person into coming to see him again by asking for similar products beacuse you liked what you bought or instructions on how to use or fix it or something so that they can meet you again. You can also try to use that email address to find the person facebook or myspace if they use the same address as well. If they met then i guess camera prob caught the guy so ask him where they met or if not how did they know each other arrived? a phone number pehaps
AnT6O6fEaa	DO NOT PUT IN OVEN!!!!!!<br>  That was a stupid answer to your question. Don't use the ipod for a few days and if possible store it horizontally. A can of air will do it good too. Make sure to read all the directions on the canned air though. If that does not work, if you are truly desperate, send it in to apple and pay for a repair.|`|2vz59utAaa	put it in the oven for a little bit at a low heat. that usually helps dry out phones. Might work on an ipod.
LSXdwRDUaa	Yes all ps2 guitars work for previous ps2 guitar hero,<br>  But it cant work for ps3.|`|q6uyloYdaa	Yes. All PS2 guitars will work for all PS2 guitar hero games.
TPBfzLqjaa	try re-downloading the apps and resynching your iphone. you can also try to restart the pc or shutting off your phone to enable the apps to work. Hope that helps.

ZRcpeESnaa	I'm sorry. I was hungry. They were good.|`|GpR5MI5raa	under your bed.|`|U4opUCNVaa	Check your ears|`|tv8D9Pwpaa	ChEcK oN yOuR hEAd !!!! and please le tme knoww!!!|`|Oasudymdaa	I see wires in your ears!
ohhXoCpOaa	Would be nice but unfortunately it wont work.<br>  <br>  Your choices are<br>  1, Buy the xbox 360 wireless adapter (Thats what i use they work really well, but there quite allot of money).<br>  <br>  2, you can move your 360 closer to your networker so you can use an Ethernet cable.<br>  <br>  otherwise i don't think theres much you can do.|`|WQbJhFORaa	Nah man that aint gonna happen unless you hire Bill Gates to wire the whole thing up.<br>  <br>  Your gonna have to get yourself a router and an ethernet cable or alternatively you can buy the 360 wireless adapter and that will use the same signal as your wii, it is slightly expensive though.<br>  <br>  c'ya|`|RpCwfcRzaa	No. You cannot use the Wii as a hub. The software isn't compatible and it just won't work.|`|q6uyloYdaa	Nope.
