9VAnsWYUaa	I'm not sure if you're reading too much into this, but I know that my head goes in circles when I try reading too much into your question. Sorry :-)<br>  <br>  The only thing I can say is that you are both confused, but still have feelings for each other. That's what I gather from your question, so the only way is to hang out with him, and talk things through. That first step can come from either of you, but take it slow.<br>  <br>  Good luck !|`|BGNdKvXzaa	You blew it.  Move on with your life.|`|4Vswcoqeaa	he doesn't sound like an entirely honest person.|`|y16D1G0Kaa	well, the fact that you wrote so much and i didnt feel like reading it all, i say yes..|`|XIbct4fuaa	Welcome back.  Is this guy your boss?  You mentioned him being fair.  I really think you should find someone else regardless.  Also, read the book "He's just not that into you".  Every young single woman should.

afI03mJXaa	I do think you should respect a persons views because everyone is different and with different people come different views. Even if the view is racist as well you still have to respect their point of view. You don't have to agree with it or like it, but everyone is allowed to have there own opinion. You also have to keep in mind on how those people were raised that made them view things the way they do. We don't have control over that, but if we give our point of view it could possibly help them to view things a little differently.|`|IlSGU9Yzaa	Yes but there is a balance in life. I can respect a persons reasoning but it doesn't mean that it is right. You can't have a view point thats cornerstone sits on sand, if you get my illustration. Tribes in third world contries feel that they are the only ones that should be in a particular area, but does that mean that a Genocide is a respectable course of action? Most racists are unreasonable in their way in which they are not reciporcating the respect that they themselves demand.|`|TW4Xg7Kbaa	Before making a judgment on a perspective, one needs to understand why an individual thinks the way they do. There are views, such as racism, which I couldn't imagine a single reasonable excuse to have; but understanding is key.<br>  I don't necessarily think the view should be respected, but, I believe the person's right to have this should be respected. With that said, the exception to this would be any view that has an unwarranted negative impact (direct or indirect) on any person.|`|l9egWdbYaa	Don't trust these other guys, I majored in Respect Issues in university.  To answer your question, it is always important to respect others views, even if their views are racist.  It is only when they want to act on such racism that it becomes an issue that requires a different outlook.|`|VjJJSvxnaa	no - i don't think it's necessary to respect someone else's veiw(s). that doesn't mean i'm right - but you have to "earn" respect. it's not automatic.|`|XtyR8FrGaa	I think it is important to respect all views.  By respecting the racist viewpoint I pretty much respect the fact that they are close minded and posses limited intellect.  Respecting that scenario; I will have very limited contact with that individual, just on an as necessary basis like at work.<br>  <br>  It won't help matters to be disrespectful to everyone with a different set of values than your own.  Acting respectful does in no way say you have to agree with them.  Just don't take part in or be a party to any of their racist actions. <br>  <br>  You obviously have a mind of your own, keep it up.|`|GU1i931Xaa	You should respect an opinion if it has any kind of basis in fact whatsoever, even if you don't agree with it. Facts are open to interpretation. But there is opinion, there is right and there is wrong. Racism definitely falls within "wrong".|`|VxWiwl6oaa	if the veiw is racist i wouldnt respect that!<br>  thats rude there no better than than them!|`|jIM9CbQJaa	Respect that they have a right to an opinion, but you dont have to respect there opinion.

LMHpNsipaa	This just screams depression to me.<br>  <br>  I have felt EXACTLY how you feel.<br>  You have all the obvious/classic symptoms.<br>  <br>  I am 18. I can never focus on the present. I am always thinking about the future. I look at what I do now and I wonder how the hell it will help me in the future. I feel lazy at times. I am happy at some moments and as you said, I too feel "on top of the world", but generally feel an overwhelming amount of stress, dissatisfaction with anything I do or achieve, and utter sadness and guilt.<br>  <br>  I feel I can no longer connect with people and at times I don't even bother trying because I think, "what good will this do for me?"<br>  <br>  I know what you mean about viewing things introspectively. For instance, once in a while I stumble upon something that interests me and all of a sudden I make it my vocation or my goal to seek out every opportunities to fulfill that interest. People have often told me that I "overthink" things.<br>  <br>  It is amazing how much you remind me of myself. I understand what you are going through and I really wish I could help. I too have to sort through my problems. Just take it a day at a time. Live in the moment. Do not overthink. <br>  <br>  The best thing I could say to you is to find a therapist and tell him/her exactly what you wrote here. This is imperative. <br>  <br>  You are young, fresh, and from what I can see you are intelligent and in touch with your feelings. You see a problem and you want to fix it. Now you have to carry through and make sure you do not spend the rest of your time worrying. You MUST get help. You do not deserve to contemplate over these stresses in your life. You owe it to yourself to find out what you can do to feel better.<br>  <br>  Good luck. :)|`|68lLAQnKaa	oh sweet girl, you just have a case of the blues, part of the problem is you, hate to put it so bluntly, but if you want to get out of this hole, you have to determine to do so.  There is this great book called Battlefield of the Mind, by Joyce Meyer, it really helped me when I was feeling this way.  You should pick it up.  Also you have to know that you can't get out of this dark place alone, you need something greater to cling to, try praying to Jesus, seriously, He knows you and will radically change your life, if you let Him.  I'll tell you more if your interested, just drop me an e-mail.

1HfLkTrdaa	Let me first say this...<br>  <br>  I never did understand why some women criticize men who live with their parents.  Some women live with parents their entire life, but no one puts them down for it. So to me, it's really unfair and judgmental to do that...to anyone.<br>  <br>  Some of those gals have watched TV shows like Sex And The City once too often...and they have a very distorted view of what a "good man" is. Hint:  it isn't always Mr Big or others like him.<br>  <br>  Any woman who blows off an otherwise good guy because of his current living arrangement is just being shallow.  There are many reasons why a man might still be living at home with parents and/or siblings, and not because he is some "sissy" either.  <br>  <br>  What is the man supposed to do.... just blow off a parent who may need to be cared for in their old age and shunt them off to a nursing home just so he can have a girlfriend? In fact, if a man did that to his mother or father for no good reason, I'd be less inclined to want to get to know that guy. I say if you want to know how a man will treat his sweetheart, just look at the way he treats his parents! If he disses them, especially his mama, then he'll more than likely diss the girlfriend/wife at some point, too. If he treats his mama with respect and like a like a lady, then he's a keeper when he's ready to settle down!<br>  <br>  Also, in major cities like NYC or L.A. the rent can be extremely high and not everyone is making six figures. Even some professionals are still paying off student loans that are $28K or more.  So if they can live with their parents, then why not?  Who's anyone to judge? Who's business is it? Really?<br>  <br>  In rural areas, you can see men who still live with parents, and siblings too!  The movie "Seven Brides For Seven Brothers" is not all that far removed from the truth.  After all,  there are still a number of family farms out there as oppose to corporate farms....so there's still farmland or homesteads that must be maintained. Sometimes the father gets too old to work the land or he dies, so the young man chooses to skip college and stays on the farm or he returns home to help out and/or run the farm after a few years of college or city living.... rather than deciding to sell that farm and migrate to the cities the way that women would tend to do. To this day in many parts of the West, a guy who looks like a very humble looking "hick" could indeed be very rich ... cash and land wise...and yes "mama" and sometimes even "bubba" and "sis" may still living on the homestead...and might remain even after the marriage...that is, when mama is not traveling as a snowbird!<br>  <br>  In some nations like Ireland or Italy, it was not unusual for men or women to remain home with parents upwards of 30 years of age. In affluent home throughout Latin America, sons and daughters remain with parents for a long time after turning 18 and no one thinks that it's weird. Often, they'll often have their own apartments within the larger estate...and despite living at "home" they can be quite independent and come and go as they wish.  Same with many of the very wealthy families in the Middle East.<br>  <br>  Seems to me that if and when the man is ready to leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife to become "one flesh" and do it in a dwelling apart from the parental one, he will do so. It happens all the time.<br>  <br>  In your case, however I wouldn't say that living with parents is the barrier. Rather, it's your attitude of bitterness and resentment that has become the barrier. Check your last "yelling" line and you'll see what I mean.  With that attitude, I'm surprised any woman would come within a mile of you...even if you had your own swanky penthouse on Central Park West.|`|ZYp1AEspaa	It has to be the fact that you live with your parents. It couldn't possibly be your attitude that's keeping the women from coming at you from all directions, desperate to prove that they are worthy of you.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	Well you sound like an angry jerk so that's probably why you're having problems. <br>  <br>  I doubt many girls would look down on a young adult male who lives with his parents while completing law school or whatever.|`|AhRRhe1Yaa	All this will change when you meet your best female friend and like her and realise that that's the direction you are going in. She will be trouble and you won't get her and she will cut the heart out of ya, but when you meet her and if you recognise how much nicer that feels than where you are at (and only when you are ready, **** I have no prob with someone living at home), then you will move on. When you meet someone who likes you straight up and hell, you really like them and are almost afraid of them, you won't ask this question. I reckon, yo will meet her in about two months. No ****. and no, guys don't have to paint the perfect picture. Only with bitches who treat other women the same for Christ's sake, just cause they are insecure. Women like that are the female 'JOcks' of this world or the insecure 'Captain o the Football Team' or the 'Stud'. some women are like that too. You know the guys, why tolerate the female equivalent? She is there OK, Coming at ya. Re- post when you meet her OK bud?|`|6Vaaqle0aa	Okay, first of all that's an extremely sexist question and your taking a MASSIVE generalisation. Maybe if you think so big of yourself, why should you question how women act? Shouldn't they be storming you by many?<br>  <br>  Girls like people for who they are, not for where they live or their cash. I'm sure many boys still live at home and can get girls, it's not where you live, it's how your relationship is and how you're going. <br>  <br>  And no, parents aren't the barrier, it is only the people in the relationship or how the relationship is affected by the person living with the parents.|`|1suTgWGoaa	Only thing modern women want from men .<br>  Is not intelligent, purity, chastity, morality, but his credit cards.<br>  When a particular man attracts a particular woman the influence is not his <br>    beauty.

Depends if he satisfied her or not. In the early stages of a sexual relationship, the woman would prefer him to finish, but after a short while of him not caring about her climax, she begins to see the equality in the situation. Plus if a man doesnt finish, it really is all down to him. No one is ******* him in the man and woman scenario. Let's face it, he has ample opportunity to take control of his own orgasm, unlike most women, who in lieue of a penis, need a confident and sensitive man to bring them out. I think the real question here is..WHAT GOES THROUGH A MAN'S MIND WHEN HE CAN'T FINISH?|`|T588vfJDaa	Do you mean can't finish?

NAGiNKFWaa	Well you could technically link any outcome you want to get the result you want.  It would imply that teens commit suicide because of a broken home, yet  others survive the same fate.  You could imply that some commit suicide because they didn't learn how to deal with their problems, and then link the problems back to their families.  Drugs and alcohol are certainly the cause of most broken homes, but money issues , and cheating spouses also cause broken homes.  It is too vague an issue.  My parents were drug addicts, and alcoholics and we came from a broken home, but none of us kids drink, smoke or do drugs or attempted to take our lives.|`|qKhGAADMaa	absolutely!! either that or the influence of others e.g. friends, media.<br>  <br>  a broken family, or a troubled family causes depression, doesn't it? depression is an easy key of suicide.<br>  <br>  and yes, families like this can cause over indulgence of alcoholic drugs. but again this could be an influence from friends or 'cliques'. It's like when people smoke or drink, it's usually for them, an excuse from depression e.g divorce, job loss. sometimes its a long term addiction of alcohol and drugs from continuous depression.<br>  <br>  hope i helped x

zIpbIWb3aa	I'm always amused when women ask men if they're intimidated. Nothing intimidates me. I'll proudly tell you right now, I know absolutely nothing about cars, and not give it a second thought. <br>  <br>  Electronics are more my thing anyway. If I met a woman that knew more about electronics than I did then I'd probably be in love instead of intimidated. Then I'd have her teach me everything she knows so it won't be an issue anymore.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I think it's fun having a woman that I can talk to about different things like cars, theoretical physics, electronics and so on. Sometimes I'll say things like I don't like smart women that act like they have something to prove, but the truth is some of my longest relationships have been with women that were smarter than me.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Cool! Unfortunately the only ones I know are the older ones like logo and visual basic.

Im in grade 9, and ive gotten b's andc's and a few a's from here to there until this year, ive dropped a lot. first semester, i got a C- in japanese, a C in socials, a C- in english and a F in math....not very good grades. i also have an xbox 360, i spend most of my time on it. ive noticed, how cluttered my life is, always having something to do, but homework is my major issue. And girls, of course have gotten in my way to. There is just soo much to do, and my grades were slipping tremendously. what happend, was a faked sick because i couldn't talk my parents into letting me out of school for a bit. A break from school, and having ALL my homework done has gotten me an A in art a A in science, a B in biology and a B in p.e.

He may have a planner and if he doesn't get one with enough space everyday for him to write all his assignments, test dates, and project due dates in. It helps to see when it's due to stay on top of it. Making a list of all assignments in all classes will def help him keep track of what he needs to do and as he finishes he can cross off the assignment and move on til they're all crossed off. Until he's got em all crossed off he can't play XBox, no ifs ands or buts.
m89kGXBnaa	Um, no - <br>  <br>  Delusions are held even in light of contradictory evidence, are impossible or false (patently untrue), and are held with utter certainty<br>  <br>  A delusion of persecution is (by definition) irrational. If you are *actually* being persecuted, then you are not suffering a delusion. In pretty much the same was as if you hear a voice when someone is talking to you, you are not hallucinating....<br>  <br>  Secondly, competition is not the same as persecution, just because both lead to outcomes of detriment to you. Persecution implies some some form of organised conspiracy against you in particular (or a group of people). Competition is much less organised, neither is it directed at one person or one group in particular, it is generalised.

UwiGwDGdaa	That's part of being human. We can't help it. Whether or not we realize it, we assume and judge people based on small interactions - and sometimes, that's a good thing. <br>  <br>  A positive assumption would be...as an extreme example...let's say you live next door to a couple. You hear loud shouting, thumping, and a ruckus going on one night. The next day, you see them getting into their car - one of them is injured. The injured one seems fearful, does not stand close to the other while they're walking to the car. <br>  <br>  What would you assume if you witnessed that situation? It doesn't seem like a positive assumption, but, if you suspect abuse and make a phone call to the authorities, just to be safe, a positive thing could occur - the abuser being removed from the situation. <br>  <br>  We use our knowledge and life experiences to not only protect ourselves, but also people around us. <br>  <br>  The same can go for personalities - we learn to associate behaviors and thoughts with personality traits. We've all befriended a bad person or two in our lives who hurt us in some way, and after that you learn to associate certain behaviors with certain personalities. In that case, it serves a protective function - we don't want to get hurt, so we don't befriend the person who exhibits the traits we believe are negative. <br>  <br>  The same goes for positive traits - if we befriend someone who makes us feel good, we'll look for other people who exhibit the same traits as the person we like. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Yes, assumptions can lead to bad things (stereotypes), but they serve a protective ability as well. It's how you use the assumptions that makes the difference.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Uh, why do you assume I DO?<br>  <br>  ;-)<br>  <br>  We have to live our lives on limited evidence, so we have to make assumptions, go with likeliest things, and so on.<br>  <br>  We're social critters, we live in a social world of other people; thus, we have to form our conclusions about others based on insufficient evidence. Otherwise, we'd never know how to act or respond.<br>  <br>  Hope that made some sense.<br>  <br>  The trick, of course, is to still be open to evidence as it comes in, and not fall too much in love with our assumptions. And to be reasonably reasonable in our assumptions in the first place.|`|XDcOhAALaa	it's human nature to judge people usually on sight. everyone does it. animals do it. through judgements you make you get assumptions.
FSpL3s1raa	Psychodynamic:  Anxiety results from a power struggle between the Id, the Ego and the Superego.  You might want to mention "defense mechanisms," which were first described by Freud and are used to reduce anxiety. <br>  Biological:  Anxiety is probably related to the stress hormone, cortisol.  It can be reduced with anti-depressants (such as Lexapro) and sedatives (such as Xanax).<br>  Cognitive: Anxiety is the result of negative "automatic thoughts."  When a person is confronted by something anxiety provoking, they think negative things to themselves and if these negative automatic thoughts can be eliminated, so will the anxiety.<br>  Humanistic:  People just need a loving environment to freely speak their mind.  Unconditional positive regard and congruence in a therapist can help someone reduce their anxiety.|`|13tAUE73aa	Well, anxiety disorders can be looked at from  linear or systemic perspectives. Linear approaches like psychoanalytic theories, humanistic approaches, or CBT view it as an inward debilitating issue where the individual has to work on his or her anxiety. Anxiety is viewed as a cause/effect issue. A systemic perspective looks more at the whole environment, individual, AND family's involvement to the anxiety the person experiences. A good example can also be related to the schitzophrenogenic mother. Take a read of Gregory Bateson's Steps to an Ecology of Mind and it goes into cybernetics and how everything is connected and thus "anxiety disorders" are viewed differently than the symptomatic approach that tends to be used. It is a highly recommended book in systemic family therapy and post modernistic issues.|`|XzLUA7ataa	I've never heard of anxiety disorders being classified by those categories or as separate perspectives, they're more generally all parts of the overall picture.
zgqAHk66aa	I have read that it is caused by some kind of trauma to a certain region of the brain, I can't remember the exact lobe(don't have the book in front of me). No one knows for sure, whether that kind of behavior is a result of nature(genetics) or nature(environment). However, those are common symptoms of a sociopaths. They are most easily recognized in children, as most sociopathic or psychopathic adults will try to hide these behaviors.|`|ed910418c525aafef203ce51a2249facaa	some people just enjoy seeing other people suffer<br>  i guess it makes them feel better about themselves|`|t56hZozqaa	i don't know any scientific explanation, but i do know that sometimes, people make fun of others and hurt them only to make them feel better about themselves.  this is mainly because the person that hurts the other person is jealous.|`|51yrKwH9aa	it is probably due to conditioning. Anything positive happened after a person was hurt for example and so by time  they begin to associate people in pain with positive feelings.

We choose to live a lifestyle beyond our means with no thought that things arnt always going to be as good as they were. We have forgotten that the economy has ups AND downs. We have poorly educated ourselves and have invested foolishly. We have run to government to solve every problem that faces us and were surprised when there was a cost that came with it.

It was meant to extend the franchise - but used the word "male" instead of "people", excluding women from the vote. The first leaflet advocating votes for women appeared in 1847, and suffrage societies began to crop up throughout the country.<br>  <br>  Twenty years later, John Stuart Mill led an unsuccessful attempt to secure votes for women in the Second Reform Act. That defeat led to the founding of the National Society for Women's Suffrage.<br>  <br>  The following year Richard Pankhurst, an MP and Manchester lawyer, made a fresh attempt to win votes for women. His wife and daughter, Emmeline and Christabel, went on to become the two most important figures in the movement.<br>  <br>  The first country to give the vote to women was New Zealand in 1893, a move which acted as a major fillip to British campaigners. Australia took nine more years to do the same.<br>  <br>  <br>  Surveillance pictures revealed: How the police kept watch<br>  <br>  In pictures<br>  Frustrated by no sign of reform at home, the leading campaigners of the day took matters in to their own hands. On 10 October 1903, the Women's Social and Political Union - its members soon be nicknamed the suffragettes - held its inaugural meeting, and declared that the situation was so serious it would have to pursue extreme measures of civil disobedience.<br>  <br>  Women began chaining themselves to railings, and within five years the campaign had extended to smashing windows.<br>  <br>  The most determined - and the first to be jailed - were Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kennedy. They disrupted a Liberal Party meeting, got themselves arrested and then refused to pay fines so their jailing created headlines.<br>  <br>  Arson attacks<br>  <br>  By 1911, the UK had witnessed the first act of suffragette arson (orchestrated by Christabel) and two years later Emily Davison died at the Derby as she rushed out to bring down the King's horse.<br>  <br>  In Parliament, pressure for change was led by some liberal MPs, who were the leading figures in a suffrage committee.<br>  <br>  But away from the reasoned debate of Westminster, prisons filled with women prepared to go to jail for the right to vote. The civil disobedience continued behind bars, with many women force-fed to prevent them hunger striking.<br>  <br>  While the authorities tried to present them as insane, their families campaigned for the inmates to be given political status, including the right to wear their own clothes, study and prepare their own food.<br>  <br>  War effort<br>  <br>  World War I proved to be the turning point for the campaign.<br>  <br>  The suffragettes effectively put on hold their campaign of civil direct action in the interests of national unity. As men went to the Western Front, women proved how indispensable they were in the fields and armaments factories.<br>  <br>  <br>  Many arrests were made<br>  By 1918, no government could resist and the Representation of the Peoples Act allowed women over 30 the right to vote. It would take a further 10 years to abolish the age qualification and put men and women on an equal footing.<br>  <br>  To mark the centenary of the votes-for-women movement, a National Archives exhibition emphasises that the suffragettes were not all well-to-do Edwardian women, as history popularly has it.<br>  <br>  At its height it became one of the few political movements in the history of Britain to cut across all classes - for no woman could vote, regardless of her position.<br>  <br>  Many of the upper-middle class women jailed for suffragette protests found themselves sharing prison with the poorest in society, an experience which greatly influenced much of their future politics.<br>  <br>  Suffragette in the family<br>  <br>  Annette Ure, a business analyst at the National Archives, knows a thing or two about this. Her great-grandmother, Emily Cowley, a working class woman in domestic service, joined the suffragettes and was jailed in 1908.<br>  <br>  Her stand for her rights is something which Ms Ure's family treasure as much as they would a family heirloom.<br>  <br>  "We still have her suffragette plaque and brooch and I remember as a child how my mother and Grandmother would bring them out and explain to me their significance," she says. "So when I first voted after turning 18, we raised a glass and toasted Emily."<br>  <br>  Emily Cowley was jailed after a protest turned ugly in Westminster.<br>  <br>  "Undeterred by her imprisonment, she had a photograph taken of herself and her children, wearing her suffragette's uniform as a mark of defiance," says Ms Ure.<br>  <br>  "Having a suffragette in my family has been a great inspiration to me. I have two daughters who are a long way off from voting, but I hope that Emily will be part of their lives too."<br>  <br>  EDIT: If you want something short, the answer above is probably the one for you. A short description of a rich and complex moment in time is pretty difficult to give...|`|xsyAljhaaa	A bunch of lesbians got together and said, "This su*ks!

We will trick women into thinking they need to be just like us, so they will support our plan to gain the same rights as men."<br>  <br>  I'm not lying about the lesbian part either.

Anyone that takes him literally needs to be gassed.|`|6NZamyGPaa	Marx and Engel believed that capitalism led to people either belonging to the very richest of rich class or the poorest of poor class. They also said that eventually capitalism was going to destroy itself in overproduction: more supply and prices dropping. In order to make up for the dropped prices, people would just make more and sell more, feeding more and more overproduction. This was the mistake of the Great Depression in europe with the overproduction of farm products. So according to Marx and Engel, pro communist, yes, there will be more recessions.|`|5Snex2peaa	Marx is obsolete.<br>  <br>  What did he say about the effect of planned obsolescence on the Gross Domestic Product?  How much didi consumers lose on the depreciation of automobiles in 1883?<br>  <br>  It was $300,000,000,000 for the US in 1995 and our economists said nothing about it.
AcgDcQG0aa	It doesn't make sense for people to trade predictably in the stock market, especially for the large institutional traders who buy and sell a lot of shares.   Because a lot of other traders can take advantage of such predictable trading behavior at the expense of those who trade predictably.<br>  <br>  All this talk about formulas, networks, and oscillators obscures the fact that you are talking about human behavior of people who often try to avoid being predictable.  It's inefficient for big traders to be predictable to others.  And this is something the Efficient Market Hypothesis doesn't take into account.
eD687uffaa	DUDE i have the same problem... but im a lot better now .. to get over it, as painful as it was i had to put myself in uncomfortable situation .. got jobs working with large groups , went to bars and other social places ... your going to have to sweat it out take a rag with you so you want feel so embarrassed ...  although its not as serious as we feel... talk to people... look for other shy people ... sometimes drink a beer.. you would be surprised at who's actually shy ... you will grow out of it .. hell man there just people just like you probably worse if you really get to know them .. just social anxiety .. just chill its normal as long as it doesn't stop you from anything|`|XzLUA7ataa	Possibly your doctor may have some recommendations for reduction of anxiety.

Not too sure about how to help your face from becoming red, though.<br>  <br>  For sweaty palms, I've heard that taking a wet tea bag or something and holding it in ur hands for a matter of minutes helps.<br>  <br>  If you really want to take it to the next level, there are corrective surgeries to help with sweaty palms. There's an actual disease called hydrolosis or something like that. lol.<br>  <br>  Let me know if you need more advice.

However if they did I would never forgive them. I am astounded by people that have heinous crimes committed against them and they that they forgive that person. How can you forgive when there is no remorse on the part of the perpetrator? Sure one can move on and try to deal with it but unless forgiveness is asked I fail to see how forgiveness can be given. What these monsters did was wrong and they knew it was wrong. They are not worthy of forgiveness.|`|1fruneZ1aa	Honestly, since they did me no harm personally, I don't think it would be<br>  my job to forgive them.

Sounds like she is lonely, is there any way you could make contact just  stopping and chatting for a few minutes, or give her a friendly wave every time you pass, this may build her confidence to talk to you. It is so hard when you know you are getting old and day to day things are difficult to do, you lose friends and relatives and end up having to depend on people, that isn't too pleasant, you start to feel burdensome. The thing is a friendly smile/wave and occasional chat could make all the difference, and she could be a really good person to know. Let's face it we all face getting old, we have to hope that society will be kind to us, that has to start somewhere. You are obviously a kind person to have noticed this and to ask opinions on here - take it the next step, what can you lose.|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	you have a kind and loving concern for the lady.i am sure she will appreciate the thought<br>  if you have any magazines ? put on the note you have them or maybe post one with the note.<br>  all the best and thank you for caring|`|FJXWanpAaa	aww i love old people.<br>  Maybe you should go over to her and talk to her, get to know her.

You're not alone.  don't be hard on yourself, this will pass and you'll be okay.  It's okay to feel this way, don't worry about being judged.

You shouldn't try and lose weight "fast". What I mean is, astronomically fast. Some weight loss programs say "with <insert name of pill, program, or food here> you'll lose 7 pound in 7 days!" This is a very dangerous way to lose weight. If you're losing anymore than 20 pounds a month, it can hurt you.|`|88MByjTxaa	Hate to say it but you're being lazy. Surgery and Drugs are very damaging to your mental and physical health. Just get off your butt and do something physical.

The girl most likely does not gratify you the same way you do for yourself. It may be a different technique, stroke, grip, whatever. The fun part of all this is fixing it by practice, practice, practice. Talk to her about what feels good and what doesn't really do it for ya. There's no way for her to know unless you talk about it. <br>  Sometimes when my girl and i were intimate she would do things that didn't feel good at all, she was horrible at BJ. I wasn't phenomenal either, but by practicing and talking to each other we learned each other's spots and enjoyed many great intimate moments. At first I was nervous because I was shy about coming in front of her, don't know why, but once I did and I saw how much she loved getting me off, I was more open to her about what I like/don't like.

A flashback is an event where you actually are reliving a traumatic experience. You believe it is occurring right now as you have the flashback. It normally is part of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

Sure, shat happens all the time, some good, some bad. When something bad happens, I try to not let it overtake my mind and attention. <br>  <br>  Many people tend to focus on something bad that is happening and dwell on it, become caught up in it, to the point where it owns them. In this selfish perspective they see the problem as how it affects "ME", the problems it causes for "ME", etc. The trick is to remove your "self" from the equation, and you will likely see that the problem was overwhelming you because you saw it in all the ways that it affected "yourself".  <br>  <br>  Instead, try to view the problem from a third-person perspective. Instead of asking how it affects "You", just see the issue for what it was, why did the other people/things involved end up this way, etc. Put it into a larger perspective of how serious is it, really? Is it life altering, or going to change anything in the long run? And even if it is, so what?

V1MptCMiaa	If that's your reasoning for putting women back in corsets, then men should wear them too.  Men are just as fat.|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	How would that help?

27JOvNgAaa	Hello there, <br>  <br>  It seems like you're going through a pretty rough time having looked at your previous questions. <br>  <br>  I was a foster-child from the age of 14 until I moved out when I was nearly 19. Crappy family history: mum passed away, dad & stepmum hated me, so I was fostered. By my very own choice. <br>  <br>  It was hard, I had no freedom. Needed to be in the house by 6.30pm and in bed by 9pm. All the other kids around had significantly more liberties than me. I was accused of stealing money, stealing fags, doing this, doing that, spending too long in the shower, being lazy, using all my friends for money. Most of which was wrong and very upsetting. Sure, I nicked a few fags here and there; who wouldn't if their allowance was 6￡ (irish punt) per week and everything from razors to, well, fags needed to be paid for. <br>  <br>  Once I got older, got more freedom and things tuned in a bit better, it got better. We didn't necessarily get along too well but we had a silent understanding that I would always be me and they couldn't do a damn thing to change that. <br>  <br>  We ended up being quite compatible and I like my foster parents (I still visit them occasionally!!) but I wouldn't ever want to be in a position where they'd be trying to run my life for me again. <br>  <br>  Maybe you and your foster-parents just aren't compatible. It sounds as if they have issues of their own and are letting a lot of their frustrations out on you. And that is not in order. As a matter of fact, this is extremely contrary to what they are supposed to be doing. <br>  <br>  You must have come from a difficult situation (maybe violence, maybe death of parents, I don't know...), so you are being fostered to give you a balanced environment to live, learn & grow in. And that is supposed to be provided. <br>  <br>  Living with folks such as your foster-mum will make you strong and you will get far in life that way. So that's good. You'll grow up quicker, be self-sufficient, not go off the rails like other spoiled brats once you hit college. It's good. <br>  <br>  But then again, who doesn't want to have a nice and normal childhood. There has to be a balance. <br>  <br>  My advice (and advice is a precious thing to give) would be to think it all through. <br>  <br>  See if you can maybe focus that emotional turmoil into your schooling or something if that is what your ambition is. Hold in there for a few more years until you are of age and able to stand on your own two feet. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you really desperately want to get out: You need not be afraid, no child should be afraid. Talk to a person you really trust, someone who won't tell your foster-mum, see what your options are and what advice they can give. <br>  <br>  Never be worried bout what your foster-mum might do, it doesn't matter if she ever gets to read any of this. Stand your ground, the worst she can do is hit you and then she'll most likely face the law. And that exactly is the reason why she won't do it. :) <br>  <br>  The authorities tend to believe children more than adults especially when it comes to abuse cases (be it physical or emotional), there have been too many child abuse cases in recent years that have got undetected for long (lemony snikett style) ;p.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, call ChildLine and ask for advice. Free and confidential. They'll advise you how to proceed. 0800 11 11 (freefone)<br>  <br>  Don't hesitate to ask more questions about this as I'm sure many people are pleased to give you some advice and help you out. <br>  <br>  Don't harm yourself and face it with a smile on your face. It's smiles that kill your enemies, not knives. ;p<br>  <br>  Peace!|`|CfvgcYMhaa	Talk to the police/ local foster agency and tell them you hate it, and want a new place to live.<br>  <br>  Tell them you want to commit suicide and they will take it more seriously.

There will always be something; crappy job, demanding boss, lousy apartment, that "friend" that you can't seem to get rid off, an ex that won't leave you alone, just to name a few.  And it will drive you mad if you dwell on the negatives in your life instead of the positives.  Fix the things you can and brave the things you can't.

2wFjqYfpaa	First of all analyze what happened. Everyone interprets and sees things the way they want to see them. Pain and suffering are things that are really quite relative. We all choose how we respond to whatever situations we are in, if we have a bad day, bad week, boyfriend/girlfriend breaks up with us, excess homework, peers being mean, burn our hand whatever the source is; we choose to react (sometimes over-react) however we want to whether it be through crying, hitting something/someone, paranoia etc. <br>  <br>  Your paranoia is a defense mechanism your mind created to protect yourself from anything bad happening again. You get tense around anything that could relate to amputation or burning. These topics are amplified in your perception. You are in complete control with how much weight you associate to anything that happens to you. <br>  <br>  Ok so what do we know? What are the facts? You burned your hand, it hurt like hell, you broke out in blisters, your friend is NOT a doctor, your mom had a conversation about diseases. <br>  <br>  To be redundant, you are in control of how you respond to ANY situation. People made it through concentration camps by altering their perception of things as they happened, as gruesome as they were. You will get through this, you will realize that these things are only relative to how you perceive them. Look at the facts, think about how you responded to them, and how you interpreted them. You will find the paranoia is something you created, if you created it you can destroy it. Good luck, don't give up on paintball, its way too fun to have one incident keep you from it.|`|zgAoOs5raa	Buddy you just really need to relax ok. Just keep saying to yourself over "I am fine" and "nothing is going to happen to my hand"  Because other then a little burn mark or some blistering your hand is going to be just fine. Your friends just said that to freak you out so don't let it bother you. Take a deep breath. Inhale and exhale. Just be sure to take care of the wound and you will be just fine :)|`|rAVPz0Faaa	breathe in & out of a paper bag while trying to think about nothing...<br>  ...Shoot, I don't know. just chill out|`|xHxi9p0Vaa	Even though CO2 is cold, what happened to you sounds like a second degree burn. Make sure that you keep the area clean, maybe even putting some sort of gauze dressing on it, but DON"T use any type of ointment, or butter, or fluffy cotton on it. Keep it clean. If it were to turn dark brown or black, or if it seems to be infected, you need to see a doctor. I hope that helps

He alone could have prevented the problem. All he had to do was not to save anyone during the dot com crash and let interest rates go up. If he had done that, there would be no bailout of Fanny and Freddie, there would be no subprime mortgages, there would be no giant deficit, there would be no Iraq war, there would be no expansion of government, there would be no excessive spending, there would be no excessive consumption on borrowed money, basically none of the factors that cause this depression will exists had he acted the right way 8 years ago.|`|KkZE2NDYaa	I'm not interested in blame.

SQLfPz1Zaa	as i keep telling people who ask about dream interpretations, dreams don't always mean something, they are usually something that your subconscious congers up to answer a question you have that cant be answered. this sounds to me like you were somewhat close to your uncle but never had the chance to really do something with him before he died, or never got to really say goodbye. you wanted to drive the bus, but it left right before you could, he didn't drive it away though it drove itself and couldn't be controlled like death can t be controlled. You want to control it, and you think you have all the time to do it, but then it just does it on its own and theres nothing you can do but let it go.|`|1CVOHoapaa	It means you missed the bus, (missed something), because you didn't act quickly enough and you should wait for the next one but take charge next time. Make a decision.|`|1aa2d6d5bc15f2352d29f943ba647b66aa	surprisingly dreaming about buses means so much more<br>  1.  your coming to terms with the way you handle group relationships, and new directions you need to take in company of others<br>  and 2. You may be experiencing the need to be an individual, at the same time belonging to a group with a common purpose. <br>  Basically, you're using your dreams as a way to take your uncles death, especially if you were close to him. Maybe if your holding on to his memories and the fact that he is dead, that it is time to let go|`|3dT7f39maa	The first thing we must remember is that the uncle in your dreams is actually a symbol of what your real uncle meant to you when he was alive.  He must have been a very large part of your life, for you to dream of him so long after. Anyway,  to dream of you talking to a dead relative is usually a sign of great good luck.|`|dE8edvGIaa	Well, as far as I know. It means that you will be following his steps in life and will be like him.. <br>  Hopefully, this is good for you.<br>  x

U69Q6rsWaa	I'm not sure there is really a blanket response to that criticism, it generally depends on the particular study, and the level of explanation they were looking for. I would generally expect whoever raised that criticism to say why whatever they did in that paper was inappropriate. <br>  <br>  In most experimental psychology, we reduce things to some extent, as we isolate particular defined factors involved in what we're looking at (the humanist approach is probably the main/only one that doesn't reduce things, or does it less, but very little empirical research comes from such an approach because of it).  A great deal of progress has been made in psychology on the basis of reductionism, so as a general criticism, its a bit unfounded.<br>  <br>  Broadly, reductionism stems  from materialism, which is what the 'natural' sciences are largely based. All structures and processes occur through/because of tangible, (theoretically if not practically) observable configurations and processes (e.g. chemical, physical etc.). Therefor, all psychological processes are (in principle) explainable on this level. Arguably, the most basic level is the best place to start, as its the most easily definable and controllable. If your theory doesn't work at the most basic level, how can you expect it to work at higher levels?<br>  <br>  Though you could look at reductionism in a couple of different ways. A neurobiologist examining romantic love would likely explain it in terms of neuro-chemical processes, but many might say this misses the point of what we consider love to be (as well as excluding interpersonal/social factors). However, if you're just looking at the neurobiological basis of love, and are writing a paper in a neurobiology journal, its perfectly appropriate.<br>  <br>  Another way of looking at it is in terms of theoretical approach, say behaviourism for example. Behaviourists said all psychological processes could/should be identified through changes/patterns in behavior, and applied this approach to things like language. After a while, it was found that approaching things in this way simply couldn't account for a lot of more complex processes, and the reduction of things like language to simply conditioning/stimulus-response principles was inappropriate. Thats not to say we didn't learn a lot from behaviourism though.<br>  <br>  Whilst it is important to consider an explanation on every level, it isn't necessary (and its rare) to do it all in the same experiment/paper. As long as the level of explanation is appropriate for the subject and audience, and doesn't contradict any other explanations on other levels or 'common sense', I wouldn't say theres any thing wrong with reductionism in itself.<br>  <br>  (Sorry for the long-winded answer, if you had a specific paper or approach in mind I could give you a more specific answer)
rrvCfW5naa	Heres most of your possibility's :<br>  <br>  You have not started your period and in the dream you were scared then the dream means that you are in fear about starting your period.<br>  <br>  You were not scared in the dream and have not started your period then you are ready for your period and you aren't afraid to start.<br>  <br>  You have started your period and you were scared in the dream it means you are in fear of your sexual life.<br>  <br>  You were not scared in the dream and you have started your period then you are happy with your sexual life or you are not afraid of starting your sexual life.

SIqFa1mzaa	I have this same exact fear.  I have been told many times that I just have to do it.  When you think about it, look at all the people out there who have jobs?  They are not anywhere near perfect and they can do it.  So why can't we?  Other people mess up and they get other chances, or if they get fired, they just find other jobs.  Someone once told me, if you are so perfectionist, don't you think it's possible that you are less likely to mess up?  If you do, what's the worst that could happen?  Getting fired and possibly being embarrassed.  <br>  <br>  I really need to get moving on this myself.|`|BO5w10IAaa	It sounds like you need to weigh the fear of a job against the fear of being in poverty for the rest of your life. Which do you fear more?? Living under a bridge somewhere is harder then having a job.|`|Yh4YWdR1aa	There is nothing wrong with failing. You miss out on a lot if don't try and it's not the end of the world if you get fired, that just means you weren't right for the job. Now go out there and get a job.

Swish, 2 points|`|W1xs3vYBaa	IQ is only about a persons potential and shouldn't hold weight in a society. It has also been found to be heavily flawed. <br>  <br>  Now, if you have the qualifications for something that is a different story. <br>  <br>  Feminism was originally about being equal to males so that they could have the same opportunities. Like being able to vote, get into university, seek employment and have individual freedom to choose to divorce/the route of their lives. <br>  <br>  Of course different waves of feminism have distorted this original intent. In the 1960's it was quickly market and the free love movement  was really about making a lot of money and establishing an unhealthy relationship and mentality about what feminism was suppose to be. It became the ability to be promiscuous, and everyone jumped on board. <br>  I'm not one to say that you should have only one partner, and wait until marriage, but through this era a sense of decency was lost in society and sex became too prevalent and has lead to men and women losing a certain level of respect for each other. <br>  <br>  This sexual confusion established a weird interaction with men and women where women wanted to be a feminist and not be controlled but also wanted a relationship. Men, confused by the change in society and the actions of women, began to resent some of them for this. However, many men have held a prejudice against women because they have breasts and a vagina, which is wrong. Some men have worked actively against women to make sure they did not enter the work force. <br>  <br>  This lead to the 1980's where it was women had to be better than men, which is wrong in itself. No one should be better. <br>  Affirmative Action was necessary to establish the norm of women in the work place, because it wasn't going to happen without a push from legislation. People don't like actual change. <br>  <br>  Affirmative Action has lead to many incompetent women getting positions of power. The reasons of this could range from men appointing women who they knew would fail to prove that women couldn't enter the work force, to women just being under-qualified for the position based on a lack of education, upbringing and experience (when it was first enacted), or it could be that affirmative action has gone too far in some cases and is discriminatory. <br>  <br>  Still, today stats do show that women have continued to make less than males and that white males are the most likely to be employed in high paying jobs. Therefore, the myth that white males have been hurt is not proven by reality. <br>  <br>  Still, ideally a person should be based on their merit, and not sex, skin colour, orientation or political association. However, you have to see that when changes to a once oppressed minority are first being made there has to be legislation to get their foot in the door. Once figures of said minority appear in different fields is when such legislation should start to be revoked. <br>  <br>  In a true meritocracy we will need to have hiring done primarily off merit, but it was not long ago that females and minorities were not allowed certain things and it has only been recently that the last generation has found a footing in different fields so that today's generation can see them, and hopefully mirror them. Our consciousness is changing, and with that so should our laws. I cannot wait until hiring is based upon on merit, and it is coming, but it is still a bit too premature. <br>  <br>  Again though, IQ has nothing to do with how you will function in society. It is innate potential, but it does not mean that that potential will be fulfilled.
K70Hkq5haa	Heaven and hell does exist. Isaiah was brought to heaven and Lazarus was talking from heaven to the rich man who denied him food pleading for a drop of water to quench his thirst in hell.|`|YQOT68xFaa	They are real. belief or disbelief don't make them appear and disappear.

The only difference between people in heaven and people in hell is that those in heaven believed in Jesus Christ. That's it. I put my faith in Him when I was 13. But I am not perfect. Heck, alot of the time I'm not even good. I'm selfish, I'm angry, and i can be quite mean to people sometimes. I'm not going to heaven because I'm worthy of it. None of us are.

However -- I, too, think that our energy continues. Our soul, our essence... whatever one chooses to call it.<br>  <br>  How it does so is beyond the capacity of mere humans to understand. It might be something like what we understand as 'reincarnation.' That would make sense to me, I think.<br>  <br>  I also think that "heaven" is right here on Earth. As is hell. The beauty and perfection of Nature is too overwhelming to describe - it is homo sapiens who has turned this Paradise into a living hell.

I believe hell as being removed and broken off from the presence of God(dess).  I also have a vague belief in reincarnation--like you get to do life many times until you're ready to move on to heaven.  As for what heaven looks like--I guess its beautiful and peaceful, but not necessarily with streets of gold and gates of pearls.  Too many cultures describe heaven differently and I think it may look like what one may want it to look like to them.  For me personally, what would I want with streets of gold?  Not my cup of tea.  Give me miles and miles of uncut, undestroyed landscape with wild animals and freedom.<br>  <br>  EDIT--My question about Christianity has always been this--what happened to those individuals who died before Jesus?  Or what happened to those before YHWH came around?  Remember, the Judeo-Christian god arrived rather late to the scene (I always wonder what took him so long).  Abraham didn't come around until 1800BC and the bible didn't start to get written until late 1300BC.  Considering we have written material dating as far as nearly 5,000BC, what were people doing before YHWH?  What "heaven or hell" did they go to then?  Hmm, maybe I'll ask this in the R&S section.|`|dPk7dr7laa	I DO!

Beyond this reserve requirement, the bank can invest the funds in loans so as to make the funds earn or productive.|`|fofzdoROaa	Since large sums of money when loaned out will return to the bank as investments, this process can be repeated, by lending without much of the money staying in the vault. Thus means that when you lend a new sum of money to the bank it can lend out this sum about 9 times more! This the loan to deposit ratio. <br>  <br>  A better way of expressing it is the Reserve Ratio which for a loan to deposit ratio of 9 has a reserve ratio of only 10%. It is the proportion of money that the bank holds in its vault compared to the amount it is allowed to lend.<br>  <br>  It is this low value that creates the financial crisis when a sudden run on the bank by savers, results in their reservs becoming zero before more savings are returned. <br>  <br>  And this is about what's adding to the economic crisis, but not the basic cause which is loss in value of real estate and foreclosures..|`|nvSyOQZfaa	Dear Sir/Madam,<br>  <br>  We Offer Private, Commercial and Personal Loans with very Minimal annual<br>  Interest Rates as Low as 2% within a 1year to 50 years repayment duration<br>  period to any part of the world.

It's for women, but not "against" men.<br>  First of all, the number of women in prison is minuscule compared to the number of men in prison.  No one is talking about serious women offenders being released.  It's the women who would benefit from working in the community who would be allowed, under supervision, to be released.  They then have to have counselling and meet strict security measures.<br>  The research proves that women respond very well to this kind of re-education, much more so than men.<br>  The men's prisons are too full for many reasons, and this would allow the women's prisons to be used for the men.  <br>  I would far rather that women have re-education and rehabilitation than just allowing the same old sinners back into the streets.  Again, violent women and serious offenders will not be released onto the streets.  <br>  I am in two minds on this - on one hand I would rather see the women punished (if you can't do the time, don't do the crime), on the other hand, if they are to be released back into society, I would far rather they were rehabilitated so that they are fit to be released into society.<br>  This is not anti-men as far as I can tell, but pressure because of the shortage of space in prisons and a wish to rehabilitate the comparatively few number of women in prisons.|`|67204bd052a33365d7bd0f82da0dcc95aa	So you recognise that women did have to fight for equal rights then? The old fashioned feminists were ok, yes? But, and I love these little names you come up with, neo feminists are not ok because we have equality now do we? When did that happen? And do you think it is some places but not others? And feminists want all those thousands of female murderers, and gang bangers and rapists and crime bosses let out of jail...absolute garbage!<br>  No such thing as being nearly equal, we either are or we are not...and we clearly are not...and there are about 5,000 women in UK jails...keep the dangerous ones in, there are some, but they could probably be housed in about 5 big trailers, the rest are not a danger to society, and could be punished in the community. As for men, about 86,000 in jails, poor lambs, all victims of feminist conspiracy, I am sure...do the same keep the dangerous ones in and punish the others in the community. Then you can see that women are not actually as criminal as men.<br>  But you don't want to hear the reality, read the others who tell you we make this stuff up, regardless of where we work, or what we know, or how high up in the CJS anyone maybe...believe someone who watched Fox news once...lol|`|AA11705909	Psychotic stupidity?|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	A phobia of men?<br>  <br>  Maybe you could be more specific|`|phJfL2wTaa	It is a process of Dehumanization.<br>  <br>  This approach is used most commonly with soldiers.  By Dehumanizing the enemy a person can mentally justify treating the enemy in-humanely.<br>  <br>  "Dehumanization is the process by which members of a group of people assert the "inferiority" of another group through subtle or overt acts or statements. Dehumanization may be directed by an organization (such as a state) or may be the composite of individual sentiments and actions, as with some types of de facto racism. State-organized dehumanization has been directed against perceived racial or ethnic groups, nationalities (or "foreigners" in general), religious groups, genders, minorities of various sexual orientations (eg. homosexuals), disabled people as a class, economic [e.g. the homeless] and social classes, and many other groups."<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanization" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanizat...</a><br>  <br>  The unrelenting repetition from feminists portraying men as dangerous predators will over time make a person view men this way, regardless of personal experience.|`|SwyZkNn6aa	I don't see that they're against men.

To be honest, I think some women are just trying to redress the balance of the fact that much in life really has been male orientated for years.<br>  <br>  Page 3 on newspapers, for men, larger wages for men, better jobs for men, exclusive clubs to which women were never allowed.  It just goes on and on.  Because one or two places run a genuine equal opportunity staff charter, men seem convinced it's all over now and we're equal, but in reality, it's not like that at all. Men are still better valued.  <br>  <br>  Some women feel the injustice of it.<br>  <br>  Personally, I am fighting my own battles against feminists, as in that I have committed the ultimate feminist "sin" of getting married, being a housewife, having a family and producing more boys!  i don't mind my life at all, though like any job, I have my off days, so reserve the right to moan about it - however, personally, I think it's about time men and women both grew up about it all.  We're just different, let's accept that and move on.  We both need each other, and both respect individuals in each of the sexes, so we need to stop pigeon holing the whole of man/woman/masculinist or feminist kind - like in this question!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Those types of women will never change, like guys who make sexist comments about women, or overcharge girls to get their cars fixed  - sexist people are typically stubborn, they will keep silent if pressed, but, they will always hold the same opinon.

13tAUE73aa	hi there. im a clinician. it sounds like you have a form of anxiety or social phobia. have you ever seen a mental health clinician? a therapist would work with you on working on skills you can use when you encoudebilitatingtriggers (e.g, public speaking situations) and a psychiatrist would prescibe you a medication for the problem if medication is warrented. some anxiety in your life is NORMAL in order for you to survive, (that fight or flight response you have), however, it sounds like you are past the point of functioning effectively in everyday life situations. there are things out there that help decrease the anxiety you're feeling so that you can live a "normal" life. anoher important point i must make though...feeling suicidal is a serious thing. just because someone has friends, family, and financial succss does not mak them less likely to try to hurt or kill themselves. in fact, the highest suicide rates are among people from that demographic so seek help. i can only imagine the feeling you're having is making you feel helpless and ashamed. but there is help out there for thousands of people in your situation. take a moment to search for a therapist on the american associatoin for marriage and family therapy website. they offer brief therapy for individuals also (i am this kind of therapist). the website is www.aamft.org and go to the link for "find a therapist." also, a number to help through those thoughts of suicide is 800-784-2433. it is an accredited national crisis line to offer emotional support and additional information to help you find help in your local area. also, one last thing, i am not aware of your history in relation to your anxiety and don't know if you've experienced any form of traumatic events that bought on the fear of public speaking, but if that is also the case, take a look at the EMDR website www.emdr.com...good luck!<br>  tiffany m., ms, mft, cis|`|fnAfHfuvaa	Well, first off, I think it goes without saying that suicide is taking it way too far. Anyway . . .<br>  <br>  For most of my school life I had extreme problems with public speaking and pretty much just approaching new people to begin with. But with public speaking, it was the worst. My stomach would be in knots, my face would get completely red. So, of course, I'd go through it as fast as possible and never look up once.<br>  <br>  Somehow, one semester into college, that's all changed now. Granted, I was only speaking in front of what might have been 5 or 6 people, but it went perfectly. No nervousness, no stammering. I didn't even look down at my note cards one single time. I really couldn't believe I had gotten over it so quickly and perfectly.<br>  <br>  I even got enough confidence to insert a few humorous things into my "introduce yourself to the class" speech. Everybody laughed and I received the comment of "good use of humor" on the rubric.<br>  <br>  So to end this long-winded thing, how did I do it? It wasn't a product or pill or anything that could be bought. I think it was just doing it enough times to point where I was actually comfortable. Believe me, I was literally  the worst at this, but just by doing it enough times I'm finally over all the problems I've had. I still don't like it, but I can do it now. And that might be the only way to get over it--keep on trying.

AGrQp2qZaa	An assessment is fairly straight forward. The purpose is to find out about you and what factors might be causing your symptoms of depression. This will usually include an interview with the psychologist. It involves asking about your personal history, such as your family, relationships and a sense of your basic perspective on your life. The purpose is to get to understand you on a deep level. There maybe some tests. Most likely it would include a personality test, such as the MMPI, which is a true /false test of some statements. Then the psychologist may suggest some therapy to help you with any identified issues. The best approach is to understand this person is there for you and wants to help.

6cd0dede1cb5b94c9817d6ec157367bcaa	Just remember that everyone has trouble communicating at some point in their life. Even the most gifted public speakers and most out-going people have days when they feel like they can't get an idea across to ANYONE no matter how hard they try, so you're not alone.<br>  <br>  Take it a day at a time, moment by moment. Think things through, and then act. There's nothing wrong with taking life a little slow to insure that you're communicating effectively.<br>  <br>  When all else fails, take a deep breath! Remember that no one's going to laugh at you if you have to take extra time in figuring out how to act. We all operate differently, and almost everyone in the world respects that.<br>  <br>  :) Cheer up! You're a great person with great potential. Never forget that.|`|79632f5cafa59cc02272fe8777999b37aa	hi :]  i read once that anger is your natural response to a perceived threat. And i reckon thats true. Its perfectly normal to get angry if you feel under threat. I was abused too as a kid and I had anger issues for a long time. I think its cos maybe when we are mistreated in a bad way for a long period our fuse becomes shorter because we are more protective of ourselves. We take less **** in other words than someone who has had a nice easy life.<br>  Also its normal to get flustered if someone is rude or behaving inappropriatly to you. Everyone gets like that sometimes. Also depending on where you are and your mood it will be unexpected if someone is rude or nasty so you will not be ready.<br>  The main thing is to try and remain calm.<br>  You can say stuff like "theres no need to speak to me like that or I am not prepared to deal with you until you can act reasonably."<br>  I think its all about boundaries. You have to teach people how to treat you.<br>  Having said all that I still suck at it a lot of the time. Everyone does. You are not alone in not being perfect.<br>  Have groovy day :]|`|RihPWIfBaa	Try doing some research on NLP or neuro linguistic programming. NLP is a form of hypnosis that uses anchors to recall positive emotions when needed. You think about a time or activity in which you feel completely confident in and as you think about that time close your eyes and try to recall as many details as possible. think about the colors, sounds, and even the smells that are associated with that time. as you do this be fully aware of how confident you feel. let the feeling build until your on top of the world. As the intensity of the feeling grows to its peak quickly touch an area of your body that you dont normally touch or an object that you can keep in your pocket and subconsciously link the action/object to the feeling of power that you are feeling now. anytime you feel inadequate reach into your pocket and pull out a handful of confidence and power<br>  <br>  in addition---one of the best ways to conquer fears is to face them head on<br>  if you're afraid of being picked on--put yourself in a position to be picked on and try to keep your cool while you realize that other peoples opinions do not matter<br>  <br>  My best friend since I was 4 has this same problem almost word for word and I'm so afraid that he will be like that for the rest of his life because he is so hot headed and doesn't allow himself to be criticized or take advice<br>  I tink the problem is that he doesn't ask for the advice and I just give it to him which tells him that I believe there is something wrong with him<br>  <br>  you however want to change and have asked for this advice<br>  that still doesn't mean that there is something wrong with you<br>  You just need to change the way you percieve things|`|c2a5a96d2af9384b70492a465aff7e81aa	I understand where you are coming from because I have had a similar experience and have suffered from anger when I feel that I am being belittled. There are times when I can control my cool and then those other times when I end up being called a little immature girl for reacting the way I did. The best advice I can give you is to  try emotional intelligence. There are many books out there on the subject that will help you cope and give you insights when  you are in those type of situations. If you want to talk you can email me marlybo2002@yahoo.com.
QUlm9dtpaa	I watched this whole video spellbound.  I think he's extremely intelligent and really knows that what he says is going to happen.  God help us!|`|xGb2CBgkaa	He's riveting and has a lot of good points.  And the interviewer's facial responses were hilarious!!!<br>  <br>  He's right about the unemployment picture.<br>  <br>  He's right that things will get worse.<br>  <br>  He's right about problem of commercial real estate.  Vacancy rates are going up, commercial rents falling and the nation's largest mall operator may have to file for bankruptcy.  But I would disagree his assessment on the magnitude of these events-- he says that this will dwarf the problem with residential real estate.  But commercial real estate was financed more conservatively compared to the wild gunslinging that happened in residential.  And once commercial rents come down, it will have a positive benefit for retailers.<br>  <br>  He paints a nightmare scenario with tax revolts and crime sprees.  But I think that a more realistic scenario is that at the end of this, we will emerge with a much larger deficit and the government will have a much larger share of the banking sector.  And greater gov't involvement in banking is not necessarily a bad thing.<br>  <br>  Also, he mentions that the policy responses that aided us out of the depression can't be used today.  But the policy responses being used right now are very different, and much more sophisticated, to address the issues that we face today.  <br>  <br>  And he doesn't mention that there are trillions of US dollars on the sidelines.  People are hoarding their cash, and eventually, it's gonna get spent either in goods or investment assets.<br>  <br>  So overall, it's a thoughtful interview with a smart guy, but I think he's definitely much too pessimistic in his assessment.
YupMCYHlaa	There have always been theories, stories, legends of great civilizations past.  While there certainly have been some great cultures that have come and gone, it's hard to imagine that there was ever a civilization as technologically advanced.  They would have left behind big messes, like we are leaving behind.  If we were all to get into a spaceship and leave the earth, the evidence of our being here would remain for hundreds of thousands of years.  So if there had ever been a civilization like ours, we'd know.|`|TMVPdFqLaa	You could be right, however until we find some physical evidence, we'll never know for sure...|`|ROUAPY3waa	A technologically more advanced culture has never been proved by any valid evidence.  But if you ask me, there was a golden age. That would be the neolithic.  Egalitarian, non hierarchic, more peaceful age.
snFHHKAdaa	Just as a matter of interest, I thought I would let you know that recent genetic studies have found mitochondrial DNA haplogroup X in some native americans. This haplogroup is only found in Europeans and not Asians. Its presence in the native americans could only mean that some Europeans migrated to North America in the Paleolithic period about 15,000 - 36,000 years ago.

fa5c4f373a8de64cffa0f9041aaa803aaa	You need to get out of your head and stop analyzing your self so much. Everyone has periods of doubt, self conscience-ness and being socially inept. You write you are confident at times. Trust in those times. You will have days like today when you start riffing on how you feel and it starts the snowball effect. <br>  I mean it gets bigger and bigger the more you think of all the things you believe are wrong with you. It can start to overwhelm you. Then all the feelings are there and you're paralyzed with doubt.  When this starts to happen...get out of your head. Do another activity that will busy your mind. <br>  Some  people are inherently shy, so this is something you may not even be able to control. Remember trust the times you feel confident and expand that feeling. Go to it and good luck.|`|3h37vetbaa	Keep on pushing yourself to be a little more outgoing each time, sweetie.  Keep pushing the limits of your 'comfort zone,' as they say.  Taking little steps is a smart way to build up your self-esteem.  And stop telling yourself you can't do it--of course you can!  Just stick with it and never give up!<br>  <br>  P.S. You think attractive guys are out of your league?

First thing to tell your self: I am somebody, I think I am attractive and if nobody else likes that, they can all go to H***. First don't worry about other people's opinion, everybody has an opinion.  Good or bad.  Tomorrow, walk up to the cutest guy you know and say Hi.  He won't bite.  Another thing what is wrong with you thinking you are better than someone. Good Luck|`|hbtCPs5qaa	NO, you are not the socially awakrd person, In fact you are socially most fit person, ironically. <br>  This is society's construct that attractive should always hang out only with attractives, and being a part of that group is sort like 'a trophy' or something. hence the nervousness. <br>  <br>  Now, you may have heard, i am positive that you did, that media creates these images of celebrities and that everyone needs to be like them to be really socially accepted. But like all others, you did not get the hidden message behind these words of wisdom- <br>  It is media that's creatng this inequality, why do I say this, have you really looked at someone on the red carpet or at oscars or they giving autographs?....they were somehow better than those taking the autographs....this is given, right? Do you really believe that oridinary people are less than any one of that celebrity? No, they people,just like us and they can do nothing extraoridinary than you do, then why are they getting oscars... because it is the ruling of the handful of media owner who create the shows as well as after long period of time, they make society's values & beliefs...it becomes ingrained in all of us that we are to follow that cult. <br>  <br>  Like better looking people, have all things good in the world, but really they may be the worst person to be around. why doesn't that matter that much?<br>  <br>  unless you can value yourself without your looks, you;ll never know what true you are.|`|lwG6tvOqaa	Wow... While reading this, i thought that i was reading a secret diary of my life. I relate to this question so much. I guess our main problem is that some people are more approachable than others, and look like less of a threat to talk to. The reason that i am the way i am is because i have had bad experiences in the past dealing with "cool" people, and the whole situation left me feeling like a loser.<br>  <br>  Anyway, for now, try only talking to people that you feel that you can relate to and communicate with with no problem. Sometimes, i will talk to my friends, and i will get so happy, and feel so good, it'll be like this euphoria effect. When i get like this, i can talk to almost anyone, no matter what social status they are at school. I also notice that when i get like this, they seem to enjoy my presence more, and want to get to know me better.<br>  <br>  Popular kids don't like social outcasts, shy people, or people that act like they are insecure. If you are insecure, figure out a way to hide it like the popular kids do. It can be hard, but there is a way to do it.<br>  <br>  If you want to talk more, then you can IM me, and we can talk about this in detail. Just click on my username.
WXExyAlWaa	200 years ago was before the Industrial revolution really kicked off. We had much closer-knit social groups, many people living in rural areas and depending on each other to get everything done that needed to be. Now, people are becoming increasingly isolated. Often you have no idea who the people who live next door to you are (or the apartments around you if you live in a block). The internet and telephones make communication easier, yes, but they also ironically make us lonely - we spend so much time talking into machines and typing into computers rather than spending time with people face to face and working together.<br>  <br>  When you're working together to make a living, like people used to do, bonds of trust formed, quite deep ones. We don't have that so much anymore, so we need more obvious signs that people are on our side - verbal validation, encouragement, agreements, etc. Humans are highly, highly social animals and we've built ourselves into a society where that is downplayed in favour of commerce and technology. It's actually kind of sad.|`|mCbChkKraa	In order to fill up our deficits in self-confidence.|`|NwhN0W9Qaa	I don't know why its different now.. What I do know is that to make ourselves feel less lonely we need to find a comfort in something or someone. You should join a church, sport team or hobby group.

If this is a constant presence in your life, whether you're alone or surrounded by friends, you should consider talking to a counselor or therapist.

BCOmoJ59aa	well it sounds to me that you need to find yourself, when i say that i mean you need a BIG boost of self confidence. To do that you need to know who you are, you need to know what you believe and stand for that. And if people dont agree with that than there is no point in you talking to them anyway. You need to keep it real, and tell it like it is. But the most important thing is to BE YOURSELF!!<br>  and trust me girls will like that way better than some air-head football player who just follows the crowd. _i would know

jffs8MrJaa	To dream about sex, refers to the psychological completion and the integration of contrasting aspects of the Self.  You need to be more receptive and incorporate aspects of your dream sex partner into your own character. Alternatively and a more direct interpretation of the dream, may be your libido's way of telling you that it's been too long since you have had sex. It may indicate repressed sexual desires and your needs for physical and emotional love. If you are looking for a place to have sex, then the dream may be analogous to your search for intimacy and closeness.|`|SQLfPz1Zaa	dreams don't always mean something, but sometimes you subconscious makes stuff up to give you an answer for a question you cant answer. like what would happen if you had sex, or got together with someone you liked, but didn't want to stay with or something like that. ir maybe you like both girls and choose 1 but are afraid it will be the wrong choice and things end badly.|`|NjrVSbLBaa	You obviously have a crush on a girl and are interpreting her into your dreams...

That way, you wont have to ask but you have a guarantee the money will be transferred to your account every month at the same time without fail? If he's your mate then he won't do this to you, as you're being really nice to him and he is being out of order. Have a calm chat with him and find out if there's money problems going on for him and how you can handle the situation. money and friends isn't a good thing and can wreck a friendship. Don't get into the habit of letting these mates stay for free, cos eventually you won't get rid of them. <br>  He sounds like a bit of an idiot if he's blaming everything on you and being a general **** about it! If anything he's the one that's not helped the friendship and also he has had it fairly easy with you - no one else would put up with late payments like you have.<br>  Put an add on a website or local paper quick for a new housemate in case he does just bugger off!

cGOBkGwwaa	First I'd like to say, you can do this. Your baby is depending on you to be strong and stand up for him/her. You are about to start a new life with the love of your life and you said yourself the thought of being a mother to this child is very exciting. <br>  As far as your parents and in-laws are concerned...<br>  If your fiance's family is old fashioned and religious, i would assume they are against abortion. If they found out you were pregnant and had an abortion it would be twice as bad. You have to tell both your and your fiance's parents. They may be upset at first but it's not like they will disown you. The hardest part will be getting it out. But just take a deep breath and tell them. If any of them suggest abortion, tell them that you are two responsible adults. That you did not plan to get pregnant but it happened and it is a blessing. Even if they think premarital sex is wrong, it is not fair to punish the child. Once the baby comes, they will so quickly fall in love with their grandchild. <br>  <br>  Best of luck, and congratulations. I wish your baby a life of healthiness and happiness :-)|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	It sounds as if you and your finance are fine and happy about the new life that is growing inside of you (as you should be!). If your parents and his can't be happy for you then that is their problem, not yours.  I'm sure their first reaction won't be positive, but once it sinks in they will realize that this is not the end of the world!  The good news is that you and the baby's father love one another and want to raise your child together.  So what if it didn't happen on their timetable.  Be strong and don't be ashamed.  Love is what love is and no one is perfect!|`|12VQ4ETcaa	If your inlaws are really judgmental, they will probably find something to blame you about sooner or later.  Your decision should be based only on how you and your husband feel and what kind of life the child will have.|`|zzvM2Yrsaa	There are no accidents.Everything has purpose. You being pregnant has reason. Remember that. Good luck. <br>  <br>    JP|`|c249231c77adf375806f00bfe2204ff3aa	You are taking all the responsibility!!!  Your fiancee was responsible for birth control also!!!  As a very grateful mother of an adopted baby girl, I urge you to NOT abort!  I know that the young woman is the visible one of the couple, but it took your fiancee to do it!!!!  Require him to face his family and to take RESPONSIBILITY!!  If his parents reject you--then HE NEEDS TO BE A MAN AND DEMAND THEIR RESPECT OF YOU OR LEAVE THEM AND "CLEAVE TO HIS WIFE" AS THE BIBLE SAYS.  There are many options--adoption, keeping the baby and marrying him or require his financial support of the child.  Don't let anyone urge you to destroy life!|`|m89kGXBnaa	You choice means just that - never make this sort of decision based on what someone else might think, you have to deal with it. And you really don't seem to want an abortion. Which probably means, anyway, any doctor interviewing you would advise against it.<br>  <br>  There's always the chance your parents will be starry-eyed witht the prospect of a grandchild. Alternatively, don't treat it as a big deal and they can't do much... they're an older generation, and you are both independant adults. I'm sure you're parents arn't flawless, either of them, so don't worry to much that they happen to disapprove... you haven't done anything wrong. They'll get over it. Your fiancee will be there to support you and you can support him. This might not be the case if you ruin your happiness by doing something neither of you want...|`|SgtvDDcjaa	You're going to need to find strength no matter which direction you take.<br>  If they really are traditional and religious, they will probably frown on abortion even more so.<br>  The biggest thing is that they're not going to raise the child - so if they're not going to support your health and decisions you should focus your efforts elsewhere.<br>  Good luck.|`|RX4nj825aa	just tell em straight up<br>  and thank if you get abortion you are killing that cute little baby that never got a chance at life<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  but remeber to tell the parents stari up so that they will no that you are mature|`|5ab9f0e0fb42ab35836984594d98aa76aa	Darlin, the easiest way would be to think instead that this is your body and you make your own decisions.  Or better yet, get angry with the people that think they have a right to judge what you do with your life.  Nowhere is it written that you were placed here on earth to please others.  <br>  <br>  This is stress you don't need so don't accept it.  If you're mature enough to plan a marriage then accept the fact that you are now mature enough to have a new life with you along the road you walk.  Congratulations on both.|`|G4pmbc0Qaa	Well, let me first say congratulations! Marriage, a child, you're getting a jump start at life. And I hope you enjoy motherhood. <br>  <br>  Now to business. You are an adult. You're engaged and you plan to be married. You used contraceptives and it wasn't your fault in the least that a condom broke. You were responsible and you plan to still follow up with commitment. What is there to be blamed for? If your inlaws truly see something wrong with this, you won't be changing their minds.  They may blame you for it and tell you it was a silly or stupid thing to do, or a sin, or whatever they believe. But while they may disapprove you don't have to disagree. Be polite, be tolerant when they're criticizing you, afterall they're going to be around for a long long time. But you have nothing to be ashamed of and you know it.<br>  <br>  Now focus on the happier aspects of pregnancy.. think about decorating, clothing, and naming. I promise the love of a new baby will outweigh any regret you feel at disappointing your fiance's parents. <br>  <br>  If in the end you decide to get an abortion, it should be because it's what you and your fiance choose and should be completely uninfluenced by inlaws or anyone else. It is, afterall, your egg and his sperm. How're they going to tell you what to do with it?|`|gYpKia4paa	first of all congrats...:)...you can't worry about what other's think even if it  family...they may take it better then you think...give them a chance...what do you and your fiancee want to do? It's your child and your decision..you both will have to live with whatever choice you make...as far as advice to telling your parents...sit them down tell them...if you show them you are set in your decision...and you both support each other..they will be there...they might be in shock..but really if your planning to get married anyways...what should it matter..take care..i know you'll be ok :) embrace parenthood it is the most rewarding job in the world..by the way im a  proud mother of seven..|`|zgAoOs5raa	Honey, first off congratulations on your impending nuptials. This is a great time in your life, getting married and having a kid. I understand that children are a huge responsibility but they are also a huge blessing. I really hope that you don't have an abortion because that is your beautiful baby growing inside you and to kill it would be wrong and i know that you don't want to do that. If you absolutely can't keep it adoption is your best bet but from what i read I think you want this baby but are just worried about the parent's reaction. To handle the parents there are a few things you can do. Explain to them that it wasn't planned. Tell them that you wanted to wait until after you were married but it just happened. Explain to them that even though it's a little sooner then planned, that soon they will be the grand parents of a beautiful little boy or girl and that they should cherish this little miracle. Also reassure them that you are getting married soon so the baby will come into the world with a married mother and father. They should understand. I wish you the best of luck and I congratulate you again
DRGchuRGaa	no|`|Lpc2aAzRaa	it happens... just try to say a few prayers before u go to bed, ull be fine.|`|b1a8093259484a9e63b778d8303a25d7aa	i do. i have had this dream since i was about 6 years old (i am now 39) and am still having it. i am 6 years old in my dream and am with my dad in a transit van and we are driving down this really really long straight dusty road. we seem to be traveling for about 24 hours (although it never gets dark). eventually we come to this tower that is huge. it is at least as twenty thousand times as tall as the chrysler building is. but, the thing is, from the outside, it looks like it is only just large enough for the van to go through the door and that is it. but, when we drive through the doorway, what a shock we get. inside it is massive. there are aqueducts and viaducts everywhere. in the middle of it all is this spiral of a road just wide enough for the van t drive up it. there is a 5 painted on the spiral to tell us to go 5 miles an hour. we get about halfway up this spiral and my dad decides to drive 6 mph to ty and get us up there faster but we zoom (literally, as though we had gone 100 mph) over the edge and land in........wait for it.........rivers and rivers of porridge (oatmeal). (yes, i don't get it either) We are swooshed along on this river until we go over the edge of a porridgey waterfall, only for it to start all over again.<br>  <br>  now, i promise this is absolutely trye. i have had this recurring dream all these years and am stil having it. if ANYONE can translate ALL of it for me, i would be ever so greatful, i cannot sleep properly because of it. Happy Days!! =D
QAtpLEEFaa	Gerge Ritzer is one of the major conflict theorists in the world today.  He drew very heavily on the Weberian approach to bureaucatic power in modern society and adapted it to describe the nature of rationality in  the globalised consunerist world of the late twentieth century.<br>  <br>  However it might be useful for your paper to point out (maybe in your introduction) the link between Ritzer and Weber then indicate the debate about Weber within sociloogical theory  as Functionalism has claimed that Weber was major contributor to Functionalism.  <br>  <br>  You could then use the body of your paper as evidence about this debate and thus  use your conclusion to give your own informed decision  about whether the concept  has been influenced more by Functionalism or the Conflict approach<br>  <br>  This article about  Ritzer might  help you with that last paragraph on Macdonalidsation and its influence.

ae92e8a121c399eb3751b67c6557c92aaa	Depends on what kind of person you are. If you want to work VERY hard and push yourself to the limit, then go for Capitalism as you will get to keep the fruits of your labor and if you want to distribute the fruits that you earn, you can choose who you want to distribute them to. On the other hand, if you want to just laze around all day, lying on the beach and enjoy yourself, then go for Communism, because then you can mooch off the fruits of others.<br>  <br>  Btw, Communism is not a political system, it is an economic system. One can be dictatorial and capitalistic at the same time. China is capitalistic, no question about it. Communism can't last in china, it is not in the blood of the Chinese to be communist. You can't turn away 3000 years of capitalistic culture just like that.|`|fDGlC403aa	Whatever China is doing is not strickly communism ... they are beginning to seriously kick our economic butts.|`|5JUeTOzmaa	The answer lies in potential.  The potential of capitalism can not be defined because there is no ceiling.  The ceiling of capitalism is your own ambition and ability.  The potential of communism is only as great as the winkest link because it is collective just like a chain.
AA10952792	What's better, an entire society where people can walk the street at 3AM and not feel unsafe because the government has cameras on public streets (such as singapore) or one where walking down the street even at a reasonable hour can mean death (such as philadelphia, and Los Angeles). it may be better to lose a few individual freedoms in order to gain a good for the whole society. Chewing gum is outlawed in singapore too. and you better believe their streets are clean. so just something to think about. Sacrifice a little for individuals  for good for the entire society.|`|AA10060784	There are no reasons that justify the loss of personal privacy.<br>  <br>  “They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty not safety.” – Benjamin Franklin|`|19da9b08442f9881cafe78b80940a57baa	We are more important than you or me.
WXExyAlWaa	I suppose you could argue that in areas of extreme poverty, those able to work are basically obliged to do whatever they can do to keep the job, simply because there are no other options. They'll risk their lives for a miniscule wage because it's better than not having the money at all.
o4Xt90Qzaa	I don't think so. I am a counselor, and I can't read anyone's mind. However, when you are around a lot of different people all the time, you start to learn body language, facial expressions, etc... so you can see patterns in what people are thinking/feeling.|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	Of course not!  They are trained to read signals and some may be very intuitive, but they certainly aren't mind readers.|`|hbtCPs5qaa	No,those are called psychics|`|AKIhBwC9aa	i don't really believe in psychology. i just think that they are using what you tell them to tell you what your problem is.<br>  <br>  which is pointless really, when you just already told them!|`|VG2X9Ihkaa	No they can't.

VG7k5QRFaa	Both.  Guys obviously talk a lot to each other during sports games, at clubs, at bars, at church, at the movies, etc.<br>  <br>  The reason they might not talk to girls a lot is because:<br>  <br>  1. You might look good, and many are nervous that you might reject them.<br>  <br>  2. When they talk to women, some of them are EXPECTING them to be "chatting them up" and so bite their heads off as they reject them.<br>  <br>  3. Society has taught men and women to be intolerant of one another's interests and to stereotype the opposite gender's interests (ex: women like shopping for sport and men like watching sports).<br>  <br>  4. Many women expect to ask questions like "Do I look fat in this?" or "Is Alex Rodriguez cute?" and also expect the man to answer.  In the first case, she will tackle him for even answering or for giving the wrong answer.  In the second case, he can't answer without either looking like he's on the down low or looking like he's jealous of A-Rod's "gifts" on the field.<br>  <br>  5. Females, many times want to talk about topics that are important to them, but might not be too interested in talking about the topics that are important to the male.<br>  <br>  Online, it's easier for males and females to talk, because we don't know (for the most part) how fat or skinny, how tall or short, how ugly or pretty, what skin color, what ethnic group or what class the person we're talking to is in.<br>  <br>  Also, it depends on the guys you're talking to.  I've held long conversations with women, but many men don't for the reasons I've stated above.  Furthermore, I haven't bought into society's stereotypical ideas about the similarities, differences and power plays between the genders.  <br>  <br>  To answer your question, for ME it is easier to talk to women online, because as a black guy most women expect you to be coming on to them...unless THEY'RE coming on to you.  However, the women who ignore the stereotypes about black men are very easy to talk to and it beats talking online any day.|`|e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	Real life is much easier. Though I don't have girlfriends, I have no problem talking to girls or women, unlike here. I rarely chat online. And when I talk to girls, I don't chat them up, and they know it.<br>  <br>  You can convince women in real life about your other qualities that make you a good guy. Here (not just GWS), if you give women a hint that you're anti-feminist, they'll avoid you like the plague, and get nasty with you. I have enough of those emails with Rated-X words in my inbox to prove this.<br>  <br>  I'm more outspoken online, but I talk more offline.|`|tYTfT5Hjaa	im more talkative in real life..... also more bright..<br>  <br>  i find it a lot easier to talk to women in real life... because in real life i can have a conversation about almost anything.. plus the way i say things are funny.. also my hand jestures... its just a lot better in real life<br>  <br>  i dont speak for everyone though|`|6qPTQDdZaa	Online, definitely.  It's not just with women though, it's with other men too.  It's easier for me to talk to someone when it's not quite as personal, and that's much easier to do when I talk online.|`|9b6acf55d27a39548c86f16f9efbd431aa	I'm more talkative and openly opinionated here.  When I hear myself babbling too much in public I get irritated and shut up. I sometimes wish others would do the same. lol.|`|BkleL3F4aa	hahaha there you are El<br>  <br>  are you blocking me or stalking me?<br>  <br>  <br>  im the same or similar, if anything Im too like my real self on line.|`|qLBsTaDlaa	online. always.|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	I talk a lot more offline than online.|`|UOmH9vaPaa	I definitely talk more online than in real life. I think it's because there are a lot less distractions. My mind won't wonder on other details about the woman if I can't see her. Personally I find it easier to have female friends online.|`|tUzCFeMJaa	I think I talk about an equal amount online and off. <br>  <br>  It's easier to form friendships in general online just because you don't always have to bite your tongue for feelings sake.|`|vEj7xoBraa	both.|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	online.<br>  <br>  For one thing I never get much chance to say anything in a real conversation as the other person usually has a lot to say, and often cuts me off to continue talking after I've only said one sentence.<br>  <br>  Also, it is easy to maintain focus in my communication when typing. There are fewer digressions. Only the ones I allow. But in a real conversation, the subject often vascillates and I lose interest.|`|zIpbIWb3aa	I don't like talking. Usually, the only time I talk is at work, at school or with women. Most of my phone conversations with my guy friends only last about a 45 seconds and that's usually to arrange a meeting time and place for us to get together and do something that doesn't involve talking.<br>  <br>  I find it much easier to connect with women in real life instead of online. For some reason when I approach a women or call her she  say yes or returns my calls. When I try an online dating site I almost never get a response. There's just something about the online me that repulses women and something about the in person me that women can't get enough of and I just don't know what it is.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	You just can't shut me up - at all - in real life and online.<br>  <br>  I just go on... and on... and on... and ariston... and on... and on...|`|MIpyDPxWaa	yes, thats me... lol... idk about any other guys though...

It would be inappropriate. She may know you like her but she would be breaking the law if she acted on the relationship. You have to know there are boundaries you cannot cross. Unless you want to see her in jail. There are many cases that have ended with the teacher in jail and you the student will be left emotionally scarred. All the following women have been incarcerated. Would you want this for the teacher you cared for. I think you need to keep yourself busy and stay out of her classroom. She doesn't need an excuse why. It's for the best. <br>  Mary Kay Letournau<br>  Debra LaFave<br>  Karen Louise Ellis <br>  Debra Lafave <br>  Bridget Mary Nolan <br>  Pamela Rogers Turner<br>  Sarah Jayne Vercoe <br>  <br>  You can get past this and you will. Good luck to you and stay strong.|`|qX2zTcNYaa	i agree with ale f on this the feelings you have is because she helped you so much you need to find someone your own age|`|Fwopm8Ufaa	I would say you need to learn to deal with your feeling and move on with it. You have to learn in life some things are not going to happen
12VQ4ETcaa	I am so sorry for your loss.<br>  <br>  Understand that if your dad killed himself, he probably felt like he was in hell already.  It's not something a person does on a whim.  People who really want to commit suicide will find a way to do it, no matter what anybody else says or does.  It's really sad.<br>  <br>  Here are some Bible verses that talk about suicide.  The first link has specific scriptures where suicide is mentioned.  The second link tries to explain reasons why Christians shouldn't commit suicide, but notice that it is not able to show a single verse where it is forbidden or where something bad happens to someone after they kill themselves.<br>  <br>  Most people believe in a forgiving God who offers peace.|`|mCbChkKraa	1st: hell does not exist. 2nd: suiciders have to live their life without a body until the end of life. 3rd: suicide is no sin.|`|c249231c77adf375806f00bfe2204ff3aa	I'm so sorry that this happened to your family!!  I personally always believed that "hell" was invented by man to discourage people from ending their lives prematurely.  The burden is passed on to the family--spouse and children!  A terrible burden, it has to be.  There, of course, was nothing that could have changed the outcome--they say that when a person is determined to end his life, they do it in spite of everyone.  It's a mental health issue and the same as one who died of cancer, etc.  Suicide is a mental health problem!  For me, a Loving God would never condemn a person to a hell!  The Bible is an ancient record of peoples' struggle in life. Treasure the memories of your father while he was alive!  Treasure the STRENGTHS that he gave you and build your own life in the positive mode that is available to you!!!  Envision your father as having been very ill and finally succumbing to death.  You LIVE!|`|lwG6tvOqaa	That is what everyone says. I don't know how true it is though. They say that suicide is the most unforgivable sin. Some think that murder is more forgivable, because of the many circumstances that it can happen. Some people have to kill someone else to save them self or someone that they love. Suicide is the intentional taking of one's own life.<br>  <br>  Try going on google, and looking it up. I'm sure that it would have some very informative answers about the subject.|`|4Wd4ENqsaa	man there is no hell... I mean if you are religious that's cool, I'm not gonna try to judge your beleifs, but sometimes you just gotta think logically... heaven and hell just seem like fairy tale places to me, theres no proof they exist..<br>  <br>  but im sorry for your loss, that's a horrible thing to go through, i wish you the best|`|LgxVVDWraa	I asked a question similar to this before, and there is no part of the Bible that specifically says that, however in the ten commandments it says thou shall not murder.  Killing a human, even if is yourself is murder but at the same time, God loves us and I think if your brother had that dream, rest assured he is in a safe place.  It does say in the Bible that God is the only real judge if people go to heaven.  So it's up to him.|`|VG2X9Ihkaa	I am really sorry to hear about your dad.  The kids who are making fun of you are st***d and they don't know from right to wrong.  If I was you, I would try and not listen to them even thought it hurts what other say.<br>  <br>  Your dad did what he did while you guys were in school because he didn't want you guys to see him in that state of mind.  It must have been very hard for your dad having to take this decision.<br>  <br>  Good thing for you is that you remember your dad as a good dad.<br>  <br>  My understanding from Islamic point of view is that people who are mentally ill and are not aware of what they are doing, will go to heaven but others might get lucky.<br>  <br>  But then again in Quran, God says that he is forgiving.  So what you can do is to pray to God that he gives your dad a place in heaven.<br>  <br>  I am really sorry that there is no simple or straight forward answer to your question.|`|zgAoOs5raa	I would first off like to offer you my condolences and I am very sorry for your loss. After reading, I must say that when your brother had that dream it was most likely your father giving you a message to let you know that he is alright. The fact that he gave you that message shows that your father really does love you guys and he doesn't want you guys to worry anymore. So if he says he is in a safe place then he is. My advice to you is that now that you know he is safe to stop worrying about his safety and cherish all the memories and the good times :)  I wish you all the best!|`|tvF86mRDaa	My cousin committed suicide a month ago and I still struggle with not knowing where she is or if she's safe now. I have always always believed in heaven, regardless of how the person came to die. But since my cousin died i've questioned it. however I do know that the bible does frown upon taking your own life but doesn't say you'll go to hell because of it. Believing in god and repenting for your sins is what's important and that's what god cares about. Don't upset yourself with where he is, just trust in god that he's safe. <br>  I'm sorry for your loss and sometimes when we go through these thoughts of where our loved ones have gone, this is the grieving process and part of accepting the loss. Maybe if you feel it will help, ask for some bereavement counselling to help yourself make sense of what happened? Stay strong. and remember kids at school can be horrible and nasty because they don't understand what's happended.<br>  Your poor brother, I feel for him after what he has had to witness. you need to all stay strong for each other and perhaps do something to mark the time that's passed but in a positive way like a family meal or looking at pictures or home video's to help you to remember good times? <br>  Take care. xx|`|Ku9jZQHcaa	Some people state that suicide is a crime against God but I do not subscribe to that. It seems that your dad did his best and was led astray by others. They are the ones who will go to Hell. From what you said your dad will be in Heaven. After he died he will have had a chance to repent and say that he believes in God. I do not know of any passage that says you go to Hell for killing yourself.<br>    Good Luck to you and I hope you find some inner peace very soon.<br>  <br>                   God Bless You.
uptAXf31aa	I think part of the reason that people get in that rut of not liking certain holidays, birthdays etc. is because it's over-blown and they're just making too much of it. When there's so much pressure to do something wonderful each year or that it HAS to be happy, then the pressure starts to get to you. There are apparently more suicides at Christmas and New Years than any other time. Years ago, I came to the realization that it's ridiculous to put pressure on yourself in this way. It's your birthday, be completely selfish, treat yourself to a luxurious present - anything you want - like a day at the spa, a nice gift that you've had your eye on etc., stay at home read a book, relax, meditate, go to some kind of workshop - anything you want! The point is: take the pressure off yourself and make it your day, because it is your day. My birthday is always special to me because I do whatever I want to do. None of this traditional birthday cake and the obligatory party. It's "me" day and I do whatever I feel like doing.<br>  For Christmas, I stayed at home with my beautiful little dog. I was invited elsewhere but I chose not to go. I don't like all the stress and commercialism that goes along with that. I listened to Christmas music, played with my dog (videotaped him opening his presents) and meditated on the true meaning of Christmas to me, which is Jesus. There was nothing lacking. It was very freeing not to feel obligated to do things that I didn't want to do. I had a grand old time. People put way too much into those kind of events and they get depressed. Free yourself from those thoughts and do something unconventional!<br>  It's your birthday, you can choose how you feel and you can choose what you want to do. Make it a "I'm celebrating me" day! :)|`|9Ypxwuxbaa	stop complaining!!<br>  <br>  when you live in a 1 room apartment and don't even get so much as a happy birthday phone call from anyone come holla at me!!<br>  <br>  untill then continue being misrable OPENING GIFTS WITH YOUR FAMILY AND BLOWING OUT CANDELS AND EATING YOUR FAVORITE FLAVORED CAKE!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  "Greedy mutha fudge cake now tell me how that fudge tastes!!" <br>  ~Lil Wayne<br>  <br>  <br>  that was to you AND the ungrateful girl above me <br>  <br>  "MY MOMMY GOT ME A BRAND NEW LAPTOP AND I HATED IT AND THE WHOLE BIRTHDAY IDEA!!"|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	I think birthdays are all about expectations...we expect to have a wonderful day and the reality is that it's not always as fun or great as we hoped it would be.

I'm unmarried and have no children.  Talk about having a hard time.  <br>  <br>  The truth is, birthdays are considered a big thing because it's how parents used to gage their own development.  So don't feel depressed if by 14 the passage of time no longer feels like a big deal.  It's your birthday after all, what should be important now is what you plan to do with the day.  <br>  <br>  Psychologically you would considered in Erickson's Adolescent stage of development which would be Identity vs Role Confusion where you would Try integrating many roles (child, sibling, student, athlete,<br>  worker) into a self-image under role model and peer pressure.

I am one old broad now and have lead a very good, rewarding and challenging life.  I have much to be happy about.<br>  <br>  My birthday is this month and I am all ready preparing for the worst.  When I was young, my parents played favorites and I wasn't the lucky one chosen.  When I was a teen, my mom became an angry nut around my birthdays.  I have been happily married for a zillion years to a man who can not even remember the date.  My daughter and granddaughter are wonderful and have their own lives. They always remember, but it is up to me to make the date fun.<br>  <br>  So, I do make it fun on my own terms.<br>  <br>  There are always challenges to every life.  My suggestion is to expect the worst and make your own party.  Celebrate your life and infect others with your joy!|`|lwG6tvOqaa	I know right. Last May on my birthday, i turned 15. My mom bought me a laptop and a chocolate cake and ice cream, and i had a random cold at the time that made my throat hurt, so i was definetely not in the mood for the whole Happy Birthday thing. <br>  <br>  My mom forced to go downstairs and have everyone sing to me, but i went back upstairs, and went to sleep. <br>  <br>  Anyway, some people just call it the birthday blues. It can happen at any age. It is completely random. Maybe you are just realizing that the things you enjoyed when you were a kid don't feel the same anymore, and don' t feel special.

Of course, it is good if those dreams don't bother you when you wake or if they are good dreams.<br>  <br>  Dreaming at night is another way to have your brain function.  Remembering dreams is actual issue.  By remembering them may reflect the memory of yours and in that sense, yes it is good, because the brain activity is functioning and if our body parts are functioning.  It is a good thing.<br>  <br>  But then again, if you have tons of nightmare that is a bad thing.

zQk7DseDaa	Jon Stewart asked a similar question to an economist on The Daily Show. Only his idea was that since the supposed bad guy is not the irresponsible bankers and predatory lenders, but rather the poor people that can't afford their mortgages, the government gives the money to the borrowers, who in turn use it to pay off their debts. Thereby killing two birds with one stone by giving the banks money and at the same time removing toxic assets from their books, which is supposedly why they are all insolvent.|`|czZyzMwdaa	a better comparison would be if your foundation's got a crack in it and you house starts to fall, do you take out a sledgehammer and start whacking at the crack.|`|E4jwk6r0aa	I still can't figure out why they tear off the roof when it is snowing out to feed the fireplace and contemplate rebuilding the roof in the spring, when they should have just cut emough wood for the winter to begin with.What the **** were they thinking?|`|fofzdoROaa	The problem is that the money has to come from somewhere. What ever the government does in the way of giving money to somebody, it must simultaneously take it from somebody, so the overall effect is nothing, only one lot of favoured people are being helprd by another lot of disfavoured ones.<br>  <br>  And I don't recommend fixing the foundations because there is a good chance the whole structure will collapse on you! <br>  <br>  Please see my previous answer on this subject as to what to do.
b1a8093259484a9e63b778d8303a25d7aa	i have had this dream since i was about 6 years old (i am now 39) and am still having it. i am 6 years old in my dream and am with my dad in a transit van and we are driving down this really really long straight dusty road. we seem to be traveling for about 24 hours (although it never gets dark). eventually we come to this tower that is huge. it is at least as twenty thousand times as tall as the chrysler building is. but, the thing is, from the outside, it looks like it is only just large enough for the van to go through the door and that is it. but, when we drive through the doorway, what a shock we get. inside it is massive. there are aqueducts and viaducts everywhere. in the middle of it all is this spiral of a road just wide enough for the van t drive up it. there is a 5 painted on the spiral to tell us to go 5 miles an hour. we get about halfway up this spiral and my dad decides to drive 6 mph to ty and get us up there faster but we zoom (literally, as though we had gone 100 mph) over the edge and land in........wait for it.........rivers and rivers of porridge (oatmeal). (yes, i don't get it either) We are swooshed along on this river until we go over the edge of a porridgey waterfall, only for it to start all over again.<br>  <br>  now, i promise this is absolutely true. i have had this recurring dream all these years and am stil having it. if ANYONE can translate ALL of it for me, i would be ever so greatful.

SQLfPz1Zaa	usually dreams are an answer that you subconscious gives you for a question that yo cant figure out. the dream doesn't always mean something, just a way of getting answers or making something happen that wouldnt normally. you probably know that you shouldn't be friends with her because it sounds like you may be a little jealous, but you cant except that for an answer so your dreams gave you an example of what might happen. it would be good at first and then start to smell like onions and when you decide that you 2 probably shouldn't be friends or you start liking her again its going to end badly, like when she didn't say goodbye in the dream. eventually you'll both move on and you'll meet another girl.|`|yqy5xfSbaa	Do you like another girl?

c6eae266bb501e0a315d4b3e606f9c99aa	It is pretty much as you would expect.  Social psychology graduate programs are usually research focused.  However, there are also some programs in applied social psychology, which have an emphasis on practical applications of social psychology research.  It would be akin to a PhD in clinical psychology - a mixture of research and application.  The "pure" applied degree would probably be the PsyD in clinical.
AA11487579	For the first question, the answer is D. The PPC represents what the economy could produce if there is full employment (i.e., if all resources are being used efficiently and to their full extent). Since labor is a resource, unemployment means that labor is not being used to its fullest extent, so the economy can't produce as much as the points on the PPC--instead it has to produce some smaller amount of stuff in general, which is represented by a point inside the curve.<br>  <br>  For the second question, the answer is B. If the PPC is curved, then it means that some of the resources are better suited to producing either good X (the one on the horitzontal axis) or good Y (the one on the vertical axis). Why is this the case?<br>  <br>  Well, if you start out at the point where you're ONLY producing good Y, and you want to produce one unit of good X, you'll see that you only have to sacrifice a little bit of Y to get that one unit of X. But if you want to produce another unit, you have to give up more Y. You keep giving up more Y for the same increase in X as you go down the curve, because at the beginning you're reassigning resources that are the best at producing X first, then as you move down the resources that are still being used for Y become progressively less useful for producing X, so it takes more of them to make more X, meaning that you'll lose more and more production of Y per unit of X when you move down the curve.<br>  <br>  But if the PPC is a straight line, the amount of Y you have to give up to make one more X is the same everywhere, and the amount of X you have to give up to make one more Y is the same everywhere as well. This means that the production of goods X and Y uses resources that are perfect substitutes for each other.<br>  <br>  Answers A and C don't even relate to anything that the PPC can tell you, and answer D is just plain wrong; there's only one point on the PPC where you'll have equal quantities of the goods. Everywhere else you'll have something like 9 X and 3 Y or 4 X and 8 Y.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

AA10973537	Found this: <br>  <br>  "Revenues of this tiny island have traditionally come from exports of phosphates, now significantly depleted. An Australian company in 2005 entered into an agreement intended to exploit remaining supplies. Few other resources exist with most necessities being imported, mainly from Australia, its former occupier and later major source of support. The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term problems. Reserves of phosphates may only last until 2010 at current mining rates. In anticipation of the exhaustion of Nauru's phosphate deposits, substantial amounts of phosphate income were invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition and provide for Nauru's economic future. As a result of heavy spending from the trust funds, the government faces virtual bankruptcy. To cut costs the government has frozen wages and reduced overstaffed public service departments. Nauru lost further revenue in 2008 with the closure of Australia's refugee processing center, making it almost totally dependent on food imports and foreign aid. Housing, hospitals, and other capital plant is deteriorating, and the cost to Australia of keeping the government and economy afloat continues to climb. Few comprehensive statistics on the Nauru economy exist, with estimates of Nauru's GDP varying widely."<br>  <br>  In the same fact file it says Naura is a republic and that unemployment stands at 90% and they have some coconut based economic output.<br>  Also that "note - the president is both the chief of state and head of government"<br>  More here:<br>  <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nr.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications...</a>

jk0rAkEjaa	Statistics from the United States, Australia and other countries suggest that approximately 30% of all paternity tests exclude the putative father as biological father.[2] These numbers do not reflect the overall incidence of paternity fraud in the general population, because the numbers are based on tests performed in cases in which the alleged fathers suspected they were not the biological fathers of the subject child. For example, see the AABB statistics for 2001.[3]<br>  <br>  According to Steve Scherer, a senior scientist in the department of genetics at the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto), 10% of babies born in Canada are victims of paternity fraud.[4] A 10% paternity fraud rate was also cited during a science seminar for Canadian judges in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada in November, 2002 by a panel of medical experts.[4]<br>  <br>  Dr. Jeanette Papp, director of genotyping and sequencing in the University of California at Los Angeles department of human genetics is of the opinion that 15% of children born in the Western world are victims of paternity fraud.[4]<br>  <br>  Paternity fraud statistics for Australia provided on a TV show aired by the Australian Broadcasting Company stated that for the year 2003 more than 3,000 DNA paternity tests were ordered by men in Australian, and in almost a 25% of those cases, the paternity test revealed that the children they thought were theirs were actually sired by another man.[5] The Canadian Children's Rights Council's commonly uses a paternity fraud rate of 15%.[6]<br>  <br>  Based on the birthrates in the countries listed and the percentages of paternity fraud, I would say millions is not a bad number for referencing.|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	Maybe your broken english has something to do with it!

It may suggest that something old is passing and something new is entering into your life. Your thoughts and views are changing. In particular, if the fire is under control or contained in one area, then it is a metaphor of your own internal fire and inner transformation. It also represents your drive, motivation, and creative energy. Alternatively, the dream may be warning you of your dangerous or risky activities. You are literally "playing with fire".|`|wQZ1ycI6aa	The dream suggest that you are a responsible person and that people should trust you. The problem is that people around you don't seem to trust you.|`|I6KdUbZxaa	what billy b said|`|07hmAcA1aa	no i dont care to. thanks for asking.<br>  oh btw...thanks for the 2 points! XD
46eoAIGZaa	Yes- I work in the car business, in payroll to be specific.  I watch people's paychecks go from reasonable to barely hanging in there.  More and more people are only making minimum wage.  You try living off of minimum wage.  It's pretty impossible.  Also, I have a close friend that I'm living with who just recently got laid off because his dealership got closed.  Luckily he was able to get another one just today, but there are many out there still looking and competing with the other millions who also are out of work.|`|MKHd10MYaa	Economic recession? We're in like a depression right now -- the beginning of it.<br>  <br>  Not sure about your question, but if you mean affected me, then yes. I am only 16 years old but from my parents talking about it and how we need to save money now and not waste it, I have eaten a lot less and now, I have this mental thing in my mind where I do not eat as much as I used to. I am now considered very underweight (86 lbs at 5'3") and I can't seen to gain weight because my brain tells me to not eat much and convinces me that I'm full when I'm not.|`|fd5924c397f5b6b2236018882cccd4a7aa	That is a good question.  I don't know about other towns, but you cannot get into a restaurant without reservations in under an hour here on a friday or saturday night.   The lines at the grocery store and discount stores are ridiculous too.  I think people may be scaling back on big ticket purchases, but other then that all is going well here in VA.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Yes. I work in a library. They are trying to shut us down. We'd be the first public Library in Mass. shut down because of the recession. Can't do much about it though. Find a new job.|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	yes, the place I worked closed, we are just being really careful with money no extra spending|`|ee08b687b5ca665f680a54a91f18d5deaa	No, but I have relatives who have been laid off.  What am doing about it?  I'm spending a lot of money at Walmart and Amazon---but I'm not sure that helps much.|`|2qGN0uEMaa	hardly any hours at work (Target)<br>  uh.

m89kGXBnaa	9.11 is burned into national conciousness via repetition and import. So it stands out, much like othe numbers that are important (culturally or personally - like 13 or 666). Because it stands out (or more techincally, percieving the number will automatically re-route some of your attentional processes so you are conciously aware of what might otherwise be an unattended stimuli) you notice it more and rememvber seeing it more (ever looked at your watch, someone's asked you the time a second later, and you have to check again? This is because most information remains in short term memory and doesn't get recorded unless we have a reason to or it seems striking).<br>  <br>  Exactly the same effect happens with your name (i.e. you catch it in someone else's conversation you weren't listening too).<br>  <br>  It's meaningless, in other words. If you could record every number you saw or passed throughout the day, 9.11 wouldn't actually stand out much at all.|`|HogIbGlraa	It means your gonna die...<br>  <br>  Or you just have really good timing....<br>  <br>  That would so cool....<br>  <br>  Maybe it's one of those subconscious things; you "know" what time it is and when it's 9:11 you look at a clock - i vote subconscious!!!!!!!!|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	I had the same thing going with 3 am I would wake up and just know it was 3 am. It never went anywhere but it drove me nuts for a few months
yqUgRG2raa	If the teacher doesn't teach then this is your chance to study and become the teacher thereby becoming the most likely to get the highest grade. Grab and run with this.|`|YPc76Ni2aa	I'd say the main concepts were magic, religion and science ... but I could be way off base ....
Lfc9Zav2aa	sure they think they can fly and they jump off a roof or something goofy like that|`|NLKVrdIKaa	I remember , many years ago reading in a newspaper about a little boy who was wearing what he thought was a "magic shirt" and jumping off a bluff and died as a result. I am sure they are many other cases like this.|`|SqPOZlUbaa	Yes. My cousin actually saw a guy on TV who never slept, and he tried it. He died shortly after.
