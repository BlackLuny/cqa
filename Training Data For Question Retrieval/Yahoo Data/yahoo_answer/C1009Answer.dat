NnsizqH2aa	I think the answers of personal benefits have already been answered. So, I'll just comment on the styles thing.<br>  <br>  I don't want to put down TKD, but I'd send you to a Muay Thai school before I would send you to a TKD one. Muay Thai will simply teach you all of the same basic skills from a much more realistic perspective, and will focus much more on practical training and conditioning. The thousands of fat TKD men out there is testament of how seldom they train in real fitness.<br>  <br>  As for the BJJ thing, I think they get a lot more credit than they are due. BJJ comes from Japanese Judo, so there is NOTHING offered in BJJ that cannot be found in Judo or other Jujutsu. In fact, certain older styles of Jujutsu (such as Yoshin-ryu and Sosuishitzu-ryu) will teach much more about atemi-waza (striking) than you will ever see applied by a BBJ man in competition. <br>  <br>  Every school or style will have its unique focus, even if they are of the same general art type. Yoshin-ryu has been seen to teach striking and kicking counters to grabs and punches before they taught even the most basic joint-locks, up to the green belt level in some schools. Yet, most people mistakenly believe that Jujutsu is all about grappling.<br>  <br>  For this reason, I don't want to put down any art. There are TKD schools that are run by really good fighters that are actually prepping for real fights. The same can be said for just about any art.<br>  <br>  Instead of focusing on the name of the art, you would be much better off taking the time to go and look at each school. Observe them each at every chance, from afar and from inside, by talking to students (both current and former) and by taking in any direct lessons that might be offered for free. That way, you learn more about what they offer at that school, as well as exactly what quality of instructor you will meet at each school. Sometimes, the teacher will end up swaying you more than the art being taught.|`|CVT6vf5Raa	styles like bjj are usless in a street fight. anyone that tells you other wise is an idiot.<br>  some dumb people on here think 90% of fights end up on the ground. what they forget to tell you is only one person is on the ground and not the other.|`|lpU2dnqsaa	A lot of things.<br>  <br>  When I practice martial arts, my confidence always rises. I have more trust in myself and my abilities in everything. When I don't (Not everyone's case: Just mine), It tends to drop to where it was before. I'm at this point right now. LOL<br>  <br>  It's definitely a stress reliever. I'm working out in order to prepare to take martial arts again, and unless I do the portion of my workout that involves striking, I may enjoy, but my relief afterwards usually isn't as great no matter how hard I push.<br>  <br>  I develop more awareness of my surrounding, and my reflexes are greater. I'm not saying that one can't develop reflexes another way or just be blessed with them, but there are many times where I just miss bumping, tripping, injuring, etc simply with a last minute quick reaction.<br>  <br>  As for the schools? What type of martial art do you like to do?<br>  <br>  Tae Kwon Do- Punches, Kicks (SOME schools emphasize this more because legs are bigger and longer than arms, and some emphasize both punches and kicks equally), some basic grappling at times, self defense techniques. <br>  <br>  Muay Thai- Punches, Kicks, Elbows, Knees, and clinching involving all those techniques (It's a type of standing grappling).<br>  <br>  BJJ- Basic tachiwaza (Standing grappling), GREAT newaza (Ground grappling), jointlocks, chokes, some pinning.<br>  <br>  Watch for mcdojos (I.e. Expensive fees, 100 belts, poor training methods).<br>  <br>  As for Muay Thai: I tried my best at google Fu since I live nowhere near you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=323777639" rel="nofollow">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus...</a><br>  <br>  MMA school (Which often times just offer a striking or grappling art alone in addition to everything [Go ask!])<br>  <br>  (And note if you decide to do MMA, It is 247 dollars for the first 3 months, which is REALLY good, but I don't know the school enough to say whether it's good or bad)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.manta.com/coms2/dnbcompany_fx261c" rel="nofollow">http://www.manta.com/coms2/dnbcompany_fx...</a><br>  7.91 miles from the center of your town.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and be safe.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	Do yo uresearch on the schools. Try them out and speak with the instructor. For TKD the instructor should be ranked as an instructore through the Kukkiwon. For BJJ you should be able to trace your instructor's lineage back to the first Gracie instructor.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of less reputable schools out there flooding the market. Check them out like I said and pick the one that is taught the best and fits your interests the most. Good luck.|`|TnTXGNyMaa	i would say go with BJJ, not only is it really fun but really useful was well... i have used bjj countless times to defend myself, look at almost all pro fighters, in the ufc and that do mma have a bjj background. TKD is more of a sport with flashy kicks and what not. Look up BJJ on youtube. I suggest you go try out all of them and see what u like best though good luck|`|pIiqXbFBaa	Tae Kwon Do is probably the best because it focuses most of your energy on kicking and punching techniques.  It does decrease your stress level because you can let out the stress when sparring and using the punching bags.  Being a martial artist, I have gained a lot of confidence and have been able to handle all kinds of stress in a better way.  So I suugest Tae Kwon Do because it is the most useful form of martial arts.|`|7XSvp533aa	You get mentally stronger by focusing, being self confident, remembering your techniques kicks, punches and blocks and you can learn pressure points and learn how to take down your enemy. If I were you I would take TKD. Its kinda like karate.
mK06dus9aa	Quite good because they had every bit of luck going in the draw. The most they will get into the semis is one though, probably your team of cry babies :o).|`|CuDM1zeGaa	dunno abt others..Arsenal fo sure will make it..let Man Utd go down.. n then someone clip over arrogant Jose Mourinho....|`|MjPd9vyYaa	Like 85%<br>  I don't know about Villareal but the rest are probably in.|`|HkqiGEMuaa	I don't have a clue...|`|cOPCNP7Laa	There are good chances. Might even happen but if there is a lesson I learnt from the 2007 CL is that it does not matter necessarily if even 3 of the semi finalists are from one country...|`|oNR7il8baa	55%
CVT6vf5Raa	you need an insstructor to learn self defense or martial arts. you can not learn it from videos and be any good at it|`|TnTXGNyMaa	hmm well i go to submissions101.com, i like it cause i do jiu jitsu. go on youtube and type self defense techniques you will find some good videos. good luck
CP3IiHG3aa	I think your doing everything that you need to do. Just remember not to over do it. There is such thing as working out to much. Just make sure your eating right along with working out. Cute out junk food and POP!!! Pop is sooo bad for swimmers. Good luck to ya.|`|iTtMQud1aa	hey me, that's a hard time to drop best thing you can do is sprints on butter fly on 50 meters, count your breaths that you take a lot of times are on breathing so the best practice is swimming no kidding but sprinters need to practice on the blocks and breathing it will come together be patient int wont drop 4 secs that fast .good luck at your meets swimming rocks. take what i tell you seriously i was a state record holder in 50 100 freestyle.|`|DEPbNRqhaa	Its all in the hips.<br>  Getting your hips up is one of the things most people leave out when swimming butterfly.<br>  <br>  When you get in the water next time, really throw those hips up.<br>  when i practice, i think about right when your hands enter, the water hips go up.<br>  Another thing that helps, is when your entering in the water on your stroke and you do a little glide, push your armpits up. that will create your lungs to move forward and up thus pushing your body up more in the water when you start your stroke.<br>  Again when you get in, do some fly pull and some breast-pull/fly breast-pull/fly= one breast pull with a dolphin kick than one butterfly stroke and switch.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|9VcB8fniaa	clear your head before you race, listen to music that relaxes you and get ready to race, make that your only thought, swimming is a lot of mental too.
kxMQXhuAaa	Some Everton fans go on about how Liverpool rely on Gerrard and how they struggle when he doesn't play.It will be interesting to see how well they get on without Arteta.|`|mK06dus9aa	They had better hope Cahill keeps fit.|`|3ZrTiVFCaa	& I think your Right<br>  They will struggle But Not To Much|`|3iJ6CmAjaa	It will certainly be a great loss, that is true. But there are 11 men on a team, not one. As much as he will make a difference, it wont make too much of a difference. We have lost great players before, why would now be any different.|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	yes he will be a big loss to us , but we have had no strikers for most of the season and we are in 6 th place , we have a small squad but i hope Cahill , Pienaar and Felianni can compensate COYB|`|AA11193511	I agree. Although they have recently had a couple of youngsters come through I think they rely really heavily on both Arteta and Cahill!|`|sztJ5dhPaa	Maybe your right, i just think Moyes will have a way to re-shape the team to get successful results with or without Arteta. We have already have seen Everton adapted well without Osman,Pienaar,Saha & Yakubu. Moyes took in two young players Rodwell & Gosling who have done well in the team.  The only thing Everton could struggle is the service that Arteta has delivered into the team, will that mean Everton will struggle in form, i personally don't think so.|`|c65125310c801112d2ca421b6ef869edaa	Of course we will struggle, he made the team tick.<br>  We have a very very small squad and it has come back to bite us on the **** now.<br>  As a unit we will give it a good go though.<br>  The quarter final is the big game of the season for us, just hope we do it for the younger supporters.|`|4kAsly6gaa	I know Everton will struggle Just like how arsenal are without Fabregas.<br>  But Man. Utd. will win @ the Sans Siro tomorrow<br>  Glory Glory Manchester United|`|GZ4ix77Saa	It is a big blow, but they still have that small chance of getting 5th place.|`|kJhZx5Mcaa	Yes they are going to struggle big time without Arteta|`|8QxVjXUxaa	everton will be lucky to hold their place. however if piennar and cahill do well, then they might just hold on|`|awWXu7mzaa	they will miss him badly|`|QB3LvbVaaa	I agree|`|e6U8kEEyaa	They need Arteta.<br>  Everton will start slipping badly.
oAjbBLDpaa	Terry Funk was basically two legends in my view. He did amazing in regular wrestling and then made himself the true hardcore legend in his later career.

Also its good to have one because they save weight by being smaller and taking more chain links out of the chain from all the extra slack left over.<br>  <br>  They are also good for dropping into quarter pipes and stuff. Plus they are also stronger if you think about it. What would be easier to break a large record from a record player or a cd from a cd player or a penny.<br>  The smaller it is the harder it is to get that extra leverage to actually bend it.

Plus no one likes winners especialy when u win that much.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Never said the Yankees suck.  Well, never really meaning it anyway.  I hate them, but I know they don't suck as a team.<br>  <br>  As for the spending too much money thing.  You're right, other teams pay a lot for players, etc.  But the Yankees have the highest payroll in the whole league, by over $70 million dollars.  Its not even close.  A team that spends that much money should win, the fact that they don't is a failure.  <br>  <br>  As for the whole past issue..... How can you say that people can't use the past, the fact that they havent won since 2000, but then you're using the past, the fact that they have more championships than anyone.  Its kinda hyppocritical.<br>  <br>  To be totally honest, there's a lot of hate for the Yankees due to their fans and ownership.  First of all, the fans.  No disrespect to the few decent Yankee fans out there (Elizabeth is the only one here I can think of off the top of my head, but I'm sure there are a few others), because there are a few, but the general public of them are arrogant pricks.  I mean, most think the Yankees are the only team in baseball that matters.  There have actually been posts here from some that essentially say they shouldn't play the season, and they should just hand the Yankees the WS now.  Living in an area thats equidistant from Boston and NYC, I see both fans a lot (its all we have here) and the Yankee fans are really arrogant pricks that you don't even want to be around.  They really think they're the greatest thing that's walked the planet and they're above everyone else.  Most of them also show little knowledge of the game of baseball or just plain ignorance.  They think that every other team sucks except the Yankees, especially the Red Sox because they're their biggest rival.  The problem?  How can you really say another team sucks when they've been outperforming you lately.  Again, either ignorance or lack of knowledge of the game.<br>  <br>  As for the ownership, most people who are fans of them resent the fact that they spend so much money on their team.  Granted, Steinbrenner is just trying to make his team better, but teams that lose their free agents year in and year out because they just don't have as much money as Steinbrenner and cant compete for them, resent them.  Also, some teams resent them because free agents they do actually keep, often get their price driven up because they use the Yankees as leverage.  <br>  <br>  Overall, there is a lot of hatred for the Yankees, but a lot of it is brought on by themselves.  I mean, they always have to be better than you.  If you bring up anything that's even remotely negative, they'll use their 26 championships as a reason why they're better than you.  They don't realize that what happened in the past, 50 years ago, has nothing to do with now.  <br>  <br>  Now, for any of the halfway decent Yankee fans, not talking about you, so don't just give me a thumbs down for the stereotypes, because, you have to admit that a good portion of Yankee fans are actually as I described.|`|AA10987824	Here's an answer to your question:  The yankees are what is wrong with the world.  If you defend them, you become part of the problem and not the solution.  <br>  <br>  Now time for a comment:  You and your question are stupid.  You may report me for calling you stupid, but while I can just change screen names, you will never ever be able to change the fact, that you are in fact, stupid.|`|qq1fSV2daa	its not that they have the highest payroll (which is still outrageously higher then anyone else)<br>  <br>  but its the fact that they dont consistently win in the playoffs with so many all-star players <br>  <br>  and all those "excuses" that you wrote above aren't excuses but rather reasons that they do in fact suck|`|qivUrJ3Naa	I think you answered your own question, they did finish behind the Rays and Sox last yr.  I don't hate the Yankee players just their owner.  The Steinbrenners are a bunh of idiots.|`|J1w0Ewy0aa	It's just a way to make them look bad if they hate them. People say things "suck" all the time. Even if they don't. And Yankees Suck became a way to rally the anti-yank troops. The only teams that have come close to their success is Manchester United and the Montreal Canadiens. I understand people that hate the Yankees because they're jealous, but they obviously don't suck.<br>  <br>   Now the San Diego Padres and Washington Nationals, they suck.|`|Av74719Qaa	The only REAL answer for why people hate the Yankees is:<br>  <br>  Jealousy and envy<br>  <br>  There is not a single real baseball fan out there that, if their team had that kind of money, would'nt want them to spend it on the product on the field.<br>  <br>  The Yankees carry a lot of clubs through luxery taxes and revenue sharing, and a lot of fan of those team are ignorant to this fact or resent the Yankees for just that.|`|VeJ1niiMaa	I think most people say they suck is because they are jealous and just like what they say "the louder they boo you, the more they fear you" And to bucs0312, the Yankees have a decent farm system not the best and not the worst either. Remember these two names Jesus Montero and Austin Jackson.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	One word:  JEALOUSY|`|414b7351b200219e50b4bef935b60195aa	I agree with you.|`|3QELIOU7aa	The Yankees can suck it.|`|aEwd0f5Waa	This is my opinion and I don't think the Yankees suck but when other people think they do they think of the current Yankees ballclub.  If you're talking about the Yankees since the Ruth era and even brfore that then no, they don't suck.  They have the highest payroll in the MLB and they are expected to win a World Series every season.  They are in the paper most often, they are on national TV most often, and you should expect that from a WS team, not a team that hasn't won in the past nine or so years.  They have no farm system whatsoever and can you name one young player that has great potential besides Joba Chamberlain?  All they do is sign the players with the biggest last names and still don't win.  Sure they might have a winning season, but it doesn't matter if you don't win the championship.  That's why people think they "suck".  I don't though and this is my opinion.|`|syzMIfLLaa	Well look at the last time the Yankees were really great, they had a blend of veterans, and young guys who they brought through therre system, Jeter, Bernie, Soriano, Posada, Pettit, Mariano, etc.  They were kind of like a team that did pretty well last year, the Tampa Bay Rays...so I think the problem is they keep buying the best available player at each position, and then end up with holes or have to trade their talent every time a vet gets hurt (trading for pudge last year)  Old guys get hurt more, young guys on the bench push the starters to perform and are trying to prove them self as a player.|`|fJ4nYzVWaa	People hate the yankees because of their excellence over the years, and people tend to blame the blank checks due to their deep pockets. People try to say that they just buy their team, but over the years, the best yankees have come from the farm system and development. Derek Jeter, Robinson Cano, Jorge Posada, Bernie Williams, Joba Chamberlein, Mariano Rivera, just to name a few off the top of my head. <br>  <br>  go yanks|`|MG6bYy6Qaa	Jealousy.  Not just the immense success, but deep down, they wish their owners cared enough about baseball success to make it one of their primary business ventures.  Many other owners just see baseball as a side job, and don't want to put too much money into it.|`|i9eAnKsBaa	i agree|`|sIIsWMElaa	People that hate us usually don't live in the markets that we do. We make a lot of money, and a lot more than other teams because we are in NYC. People just hate on us. The Red Sox can afford to spend a lot of money too, and they do,Not as much but still. Its just the fact that we have so many championships and as of late we've brought in other teams BIG guys.
bmlIg6vRaa	Lots of weight lifting, focusing on legs. Leg press, leg extensions, squats, hamstring curls, etc.. If you want to try to get an extra edge, u might want to try creatine too. It helps your muscles have more energy during short periods of time. <br>  <br>  Also the most difficult thing for sprinters is getting good at block starts. The only way to get good at this tho is to actually use blocks. <br>  <br>  On off days from weight training, do some running too. Interval training is good for sprinters, like run 100 m, then jog or walk 100. This works fairly well for the distance you want to do. <br>  <br>  Good luck, hope this helped.|`|wKVlQTAOaa	run like 2 miles a day.<br>  even though it's more distance, it gets your endurance up.<br>  Also, do like lunges and stuff like that.<br>  <br>  track kills you...trust me. haha|`|sQ3bgquzaa	to make you faster you need to build your hamstrings. the hamstrings are made up mostly of high twitch muscle fibers, while the quads are made of mostly low twitch. as you can see low twitch better for strength and power, and high twitch better for speed and endurance. do some hip stretches and work your hip flexors, look online for exercises to do this, careful to not do leg exercises that overwork your quads.
8qZrlz07aa	I prefer Spandex because it holds the muscles in place and you get more power out of the same amount of effort.  Nothing says you can't wear a hydration pack with Spandex.  <br>  Just don't try to look like a full pro team racer if you can barely do a track stand.|`|uXdx9vuBaa	i prefer the spandex b/c they fit on tightly and dont get in the way while you ride road or mountain.  The baggy ones probably are alot cooler (not as hot) but i just like the spandex b/c they slide easily againt the seat of the bike.  My bf loves the baggy ones and hates spandex.  He doesnt seem to complain. I think its all a matter of preferance.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Baggy seems like a good idea until you try riding in them.  Spandex is much superior.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	For mountain biking get the baggie ones and for road get the regular ones.  I just use the regular ones for both.  I think the regular ones are much cooler.
92df82e95b3b1086d69d36994ca2effdaa	In tampa bay?  No-where really.  however just off the coast of clearwater, or st pete there are a bunch of sites.  And dive operators that will take you there.  <br>  <br>  If you prefer shore diving, There are some sites off Anna Maria, and great sharks tooth diving off of Venice (1 hour south of Tampa) <br>  <br>  Also look in to the FL springs.  You have king's spring in crystal river (1 hour north) where you can dive and then snorkel with the manatees.  Also Ginnie in High Springs.  (and devil's den and blue grotto)<br>  <br>  If you are not a member, this question may be better asked on scubaboard.com  There is a florida message board (florida conch divers) and a Tampabay Sub group.  There are a lot of active divers in the area, and it is the best way to get insider info!<br>  <br>  Happy diving!|`|16vMIGPiaa	I did some research but haven't actually been.  The dives sites maps I've seen show some diving offshore.  Keep in mind, sponge harvesting was done out of Tarpon Springs (just north of Tampa) for a lot of years so it seems to me there'd be some interesting things to see if you got out where the sponges boats worked.  And, all the maps I've looked at do not show any dive sites of note in the Bay or close by.<br>  <br>  You could contact one of the several PADI dive shops in the area to see what they offer.<br>  Captain John's seems to be big in the area <a href="http://www.scubatampa.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.scubatampa.com/</a>|`|bGDXrMU8aa	i don't know man
W4LGDVsIaa	You can buy OTC drops to put in your ear to fix your ear right up.  Just go to CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, whatever you have, and look for the ear drops for swimmers.  Those have always worked for me!  The ones from the doctor are probably a lot stronger I would guess?|`|iTtMQud1aa	hey reese I use to swim all the time and use to get water in the ears i found the best way to cure was to lie on your side with the ear that bothered you on the pillow till you felt the fluid run out good luck never went to the doctor.

It would be awesome to see him go up and fight a guy like Linares or Soto. A match with Luevano at featherweight would be fun also, can't wait.|`|IJfUZeBUaa	Are we talking about the same Chris John who got the HOME TOWN decision when he fought a horrible fight against Marquez and the JUDGES still managed to give it to "The "GREAT" Chris John after really losing that fight, that Chris John?|`|0S0wRN0haa	Very underrated but he needs to fight in America and that will change him from being underrated to top star. I think he should fight the winner of Marquez Diaz.|`|l4WEwTWwaa	He's a great fighter and the fact that he has held a title for five years is a testament to that, he also has 43 wins before thirty. He's a good fighter but what kills him is rarely taking fights in America. He only takes fights in Japan and Indonesia. His refusing to leave his comfort zone fails to expose him to more of the American audience. I mean really how many people know he beat Juan Manual Marquez?|`|AA12325046	He is without a doubt and outstanding fighter and the WBA Champion with a sterling record of 42-0-1 (22).  He is quick, elusive, has great hand speed and is an accurate puncher,  His weakness is he fights too many second and third rate opponents and hardly ever fights outside of Asia.  Unifying the WBA/WBC titles with a fight with Larios would help a lot and he is supposed to be making his U.S. debut against Rocky Juarez which will give him more exposure.  It's not the first time that a lighter weight fighter hasn't gotten due recognition.  The truth is that a lot of folks just don't know much about him or have even seen any of his fights.
0cLj35Fgaa	Even if you do find them, switchblades are not going to be that cheap.  They cost much more than that.  The only way that you will be able to get one of those (if they are illegal in your state) is on the street.  Personally, I don't think it's worth getting in trouble with the law over one knife.  If you want, you could try to ask your parents to get you a regular fixed blade knife.|`|QrjuueMCaa	I just purchased a Kershaw with open-assist and it is super fast opening. It is the 1660CKT with the 3.5" blade. The downside to your question is that my knife was $80. Save up. It is really worth it!!|`|RRFbDou9aa	Switchblades are illegal.|`|f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	Randy is correct.  It's probably illegal.  Check with your state laws.  <br>  For example, in my state (Tx).  A knife is illegal if<br>  1)  The blade is more than 6" long.<br>  2)  It's sharpend on both sides like a dagger.<br>  3)  It's designed for throwing.<br>  4)  It can be opened without touching the blade (like a switch blade).  <br>  Exceptions for the 6" rule is a hunting knife.|`|AA12243350	switch blades are illegal in most states, and those that allow them require you to be over 18. Some states only allow you to carry them if you have a concealed weapons permit. Sorry, can't help you.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	you already heard illegal so save get kershaw i have a 1550st it's one of the fastest. an takes next to no pressure to release.|`|cu7LUXNCaa	There is no knife that is under $20 that is worth getting. Save up a little longer and get a good quality AMERICAN knife. Any knife not made in America is going to be inferior quality and a knife isn't the kind of thing you want to skimp on. A good knife is worth it's weight in gold. Get a Buck knife with their patented ASAP technology. It is as close to a switchblade as you can get yet it is still legal and made in the USA using 154CM steel.|`|yTkNT3OSaa	I'm not really a fan of assisted opening knives so I don't really know the market.<br>  <br>  I do know the Gerber Fast Draw should be around $30-40, and Kershaw has one that should be about the same price (I forget what it's  called; Chive or Scallion or something like that). Also, the new Kershaw OD-1 is an inexpensive knife, but I forget how much it costs exactly (this actually looks like a really good knife for the money). The SOG Flash I & II is probably in a similar price range too.<br>  <br>  I don't think you're going to find much at $20; if you double your budget to $40 you'll have much better options.|`|AA10628709	Switchblades arent even legal. Now if your talking about a open assisted knife then they are legal. I would recommend getting a SOG Flash II for an open assisted knife they are excellent knives|`|PcOEPKfIaa	stay away from all switchblades knives! you can get spring assisted knives from Kershaw knives co.around $30.00 these are quality,and a lot safer to use.
DOVbF4Piaa	Cheap and not so cheap are in the same family. Don't buy a bike from Walmart or other department store.  Look for something used that came from a bike shop.  Getting the correct size it the most important thing. look for a hybrid or a comfort bike, they are cheaper the a road bike. Most bikes have 21 speeds, more then enough to get around.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.coloradocyclist.com/bikefit" rel="nofollow">http://www.coloradocyclist.com/bikefit</a>|`|8qZrlz07aa	I would suggest either a hybrid bike or full on mountain bike for campus.  <br>  <br>  Compared to road bikes a mountain bike will have:<br>  <br>  On the plus side<br>  Wider tires - smoother ride, less wear on body<br>  Suspension (even some entry level models) - less wear on body.<br>  More upright seating position - important with backpack on.<br>  Lower gearing - you aren't racing across campus are you?<br>  Steeper head tube angle - quicker steering to avoid walkers.<br>  <br>  On the minus side<br>  Wider tires - more weight<br>  Suspension - more weight<br>  Generally higher rolling resistance due to wide tires.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking a mountain bike or hybrid is a better choice for campus because you can maneuver it better at low speeds, climb hills with less effort in a seated position (less sweat) and offers more comfort with the wider tires, upright position and often softer seat.<br>  <br>  The amount of rolling resistance you will encounter on your mountain or hybrid bike really won't be enough to matter unless your commute to campus and back is a long distance.  Over 20 miles round trip and you might want to consider living closer or taking the bus part way.  Either way, the comfort the wider tires will offer is worth the resistance trade off.<br>  <br>  The entry level Trek and Gary Fischer bikes can be had for not a lot of money and will adequately service a wide range of riders that don't plan to do full blown racing (not you is it?)<br>  <br>  See a local dealer in the town where you plan to go to school.  They will appreciate the business and should give you better service from a brand they sell than from a brand you bought on the Internet|`|6251c889a1808c0e16733fc6df04427eaa	Follow the advice given, but don't spend more than you can afford to have stolen. : - (      I'm a prof at a major U and have seen many students lose their (locked) bikes and get very upset.  On the other hand, my kids live in NYC, buy used bikes, and consider them "disposable." They get stolen, they buy another.<br>  Very sad.|`|d2eaad10908206b3f9ffef8a3ea78011aa	My brother went to Indiana university, so a bike like the ones they use to race in the little 500.

uQi9RuWhaa	To my knowledge, it wont effect the qualtity but more of the life span. For example, if you have it on a 10% battery charge when it gets memorized by the battery, and you have the battery in a airsoft gun, the gun will shoot poorly just because the battery is low, not because of the NICd battery itselt.

mwxKnUleaa	Make sure you have 8 or more. When you get enough sleep you are more energized and can do much more then if you were tired, so gets some rest.|`|3Jd9dGJgaa	You should definitely get between 7-9 hours of sleep the night before the game. The day before, eat plenty of proteins and complex carbohydrates (pasta, beans, rice, whole wheat, etc.) for long term energy. Do not stuff your self with any high fat or sugary foods, they will make you become extremely tired between or during the game(s). Also drink plenty of fluids before and during games to retain fluids lost through sweat. Stretching is also good right before game time.|`|Xbgd5h8zaa	you should sleep about 8 or 9 hours so you feel refreshed. Then you could have your normal meal and eat a banana and take Gatorade to the b-ball court.That's what I did and It worked just fine..|`|uoIV59V6aa	1 second|`|Y7cZC9KYaa	ALOT?!|`|bABkMrADaa	9-12 hours|`|d62609feeef052232f9aa56525f7e0bfaa	Before you even go to sleep you should make sure you're well hydrated. Drink lots the night before or day before, it will help make sure you're hydrated the next day. You should just get 8-9 hours because that's normal recommended amount. Too much is not good for you, and not enough is just bad. Food, just stick to a well balanced dinner, meats and carbs, like rice or bread. Don't forget your veggies. Breakfast, well eggs are great for energy and oatmeal is another great thing.

3IQq3FPSaa	Practice and use good technique. Catch the ball with your hands and not your body. When catching the ball, put your hands up so that your thumbs and index fingers make a diamond. You should allow the nose of the ball to come through your diamond and wrap your hands around the ball. Start working on that standing still, then while running routes at half speed, then at full speed, then add someone covering you. It helped me out a lot. Just repetition until you're comfortable catching the ball and eventually it'll be easy and natural as breathing. Good luck joe!|`|uWRPbJQ1aa	Focus Focus Focus!<br>  <br>  The worst thing ever is being pressured btw.|`|SmpwggLQaa	Run drills for practice. Wear gloves when you play.

tzrLDbHWaa	Never actually worked for me in baseball.  I've gotten some back in the NHL, from Pat LaFontaine and Mike Gartner.  Also kinda in the NBA, from Shaq, though his was just like a postcard with a printed autograph, so not a real signature.<br>  <br>  Just because it hasn't worked for me, doesn't mean it won't for you.  I mean, the players I listed should show how long its been since I've actually tried (well, yeah, Shaq still plays, but it was when he was on the Magic).  I'd just keep trying, write to them that you're a big fan, and would like an autograph.  Don't only target the stars, since the stars get that a lot and are used to it, so its nothing special to them.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	I usually send a pre-typed letter in care of the players name addressed to the team's ballpark, stating that I am a fan or baseball card collector & autograph collector & say something like that your(player's name) autograph would be a nice addition to my collection plus I don't do this with the big stars cause they get too much mail to handle. . I only send cards that aren't worth much & duplicates plus I send maybe a 3x5 index card & I always say thanks & include a SASE.  Good luck.

The definition of a "martial art" is a system of codified practices and traditions of training for combat.<br>  <br>  A lot of people associate martial arts only with Asian techniques, but that view is not strictly accurate.  A martial art can originate anywhere.  The key point is that it is codified, meaning that there are particular forms, positions, and moves associated with it.<br>  <br>  Everything from European style fencing to western boxing to African obnu bilate to Japanese karate fails into the category of martial arts.|`|nRBC4E5saa	I consider boxing a martial art.  For years in the West it was called "The Manly Art of Self Defense", and if you look at the old-school boxing manuals you see many recommendations for young men to learn it so they can defend themselves.  It teaches physical unarmed combat skills, the strategies associated with those skills, and though less pronounced, a certain life philosophy is also taught.<br>  <br>  Not all martial arts come from Asia.  That's a poor stereotype.<br>  <br>  As for other types of martial arts:<br>  <br>  Karate has many different "schools", including Shotokan, Kyokushin, Wado-Ryu, Isshin-Ryu, and Goju-Ryu.<br>  <br>  Hapkido is a Korean art specializing in locks and throws, that includes punches and kicks.<br>  <br>  "Kung Fu" is an inaccurate term that's used in the West to describe Chinese martial arts.  Different types of "Kung Fu" include Wing Chun, Choy Lay Fut, Hung Gar, Lau Gar, Eagle Claw, Mantis, and White Crane.<br>  <br>  Tang Soo Do is a Korean striking art.<br>  <br>  Japanese Jujitsu is a precursor to Judo.  It emphasizes throws and locks, but also tends to include some strikes.<br>  <br>  Capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian striking art known for its acrobatic kicks.<br>  <br>  Jeet Kune Do is Bruce Lee's interpretation of martial arts.<br>  <br>  Muay Thai is a kickboxing style from Thailand.<br>  <br>  Shuai Jiao is a Chinese form of wrestling.<br>  <br>  Krav Maga is an Israeli form of self-defense that's taught to the military.<br>  <br>  Greco-Roman wrestling is an Olympic sport that actually originated in France, and only allows the upper body to be grabbed.<br>  <br>  Cornish Wrestling is a wrestling style native to England that, like Judo, uses a jacket to throw the opponent.<br>  <br>  Sambo is a Russian martial art that is similar to Judo.<br>  <br>  Tai Chi Chuan (Taijiquan) is a Chinese martial art that is considered "internal" due to its forcus on body mechanics and building internal energy.<br>  <br>  There are plenty more, but that's probably a good start.|`|gBO908P6aa	Think people think.  <br>  Martial arts encompass any fighting skill, not just Asian.  There are Russian martial arts, English martial arts, Korean martial arts, Brazilian Martial arts, Hawaiian martial arts, African martial arts, etc etc.    <br>  <br>  Martial = war<br>  Art = skill, craft<br>  <br>  That means any war skill or fighting skill is a MARTIAL ART.  Even shooting a gun can be considered a martial art, but most people associate martial arts with unarmed combat.  So yes, Boxing is a fighting style utilizing the hands.  It's a martial art specializing in the punching range.|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Its a style of fighting, but no I wouldn't. Martial arts were originated in Asia.|`|35ca96dfe65df4ee3ff9a38263deb1b1aa	Yes, it is.  Sort of.  It's under the "striking" category of martial arts.<br>  <br>  Striking<br>  <br>      * Punching - Boxing (Western), Wing Chun<br>      * Kicking - Capoeira, Savate, Taekwondo, Kickboxing<br>      * Other strikes (e.g. Elbows, knees, open-hand) - Muay Thai, Karate, Shaolin Kung Fu<br>  <br>  Grappling<br>  <br>      * Throwing - Glima, Judo, Jujutsu, Sambo, Shuai jiao<br>      * Joint lock - Aikido, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Hapkido<br>      * Pinning Techniques - Judo, Wrestling<br>  <br>  Weaponry<br>  <br>      * Traditional Weaponry - Fencing, Gatka, Kendo, Kyūdō, Silambam<br>      * Modern Weaponry - Eskrima, Jogo do Pau, Jukendo, Shooting sports|`|NnsizqH2aa	Yes, Boxing is considered a "martial art." Although it is better known as a sport today, it has not always been practiced the way it is today. Back before the days of round limits and 16-ounce gloves, men died in the ring. It was actually those deaths that lead to all of the rules and regulations that we have in the modern sport.<br>  <br>  Early in the 20th century, female Boxing matches allowed the use of elbows and knees (up until some strange men decided that this was not the way they wanted to see the "fairer sex," since the females moves would allow women to win when they jumped into club fights against males). Boxing actually allowed blocks exactly like those seen in Karate, but that was ruled "over defensive" when it started to affect the ring-side betting. The old palms-in fight guard was intended to protect the veins and muscles of the forearms against knife-wielding thugs. For this reason, the military taught Boxing for decades to most of the servicemen, and it is still practiced by Rangers as they go through their training. So, much of what was once the reality of combative Boxing is nearly lost today.<br>  <br>  However, there are quite a number of books that exist to share the old ways of Boxing. Paladin Press has put a number of them back in print, as well as releasing some new ones. Mark Hatmaker, who has trained a number of MMA fighters, has actually written a couple of books on Boxing and its many dirty tricks.<br>  <br>  If you really want to know how to punch correctly, how to flow and counter-punch with economy of motion against a moving resistive opponent, and how to chain those strikes together in fluid and responsive combos, there is no better art than Boxing. It has proven to match Karate in power and Kenpo in speed. So, it is the hallmark for developing hand techniques, bar none. This is why Bruce Lee drew so much from it in creating his JKD, and why he quoted Muhammad Ali and Joe Louis so much.|`|u56i1p0Qaa	Yes, boxing is a martial art.<br>  <br>  <br>  Read this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_art...</a>|`|ot0WW8lZaa	No.|`|EpORUGreaa	no|`|3XACILp8aa	No - even if its striking|`|hAFmWIBTaa	No, it's not.

8f80c8533b8f2468123f479bf7436638aa	this is what you call interval training.  you do different efforts for short periods of time, some people do say 10 x 1 minute with 2 minutes jogging between, some people may do 20 x 30 seconds with 1 minute in between, obviously the shorter the effort, the faster it will be.  you can start doing say 30 second efforts, then when you get to the point when this feels easier, then you could increase it to say 40 seconds, or you could increase the amount of reps you do by a few.  <br>  <br>  as for jogging, jogging with your heart rate at around 60% of its max is best for burning fat.<br>  <br>  When you say effective, it depends what you mean?? Are you training for something in particular?  If you are just tryna keep fit then its best to do some fitness raining 3-4 times a week ,say jogging for 40 minutes one day, rest the next, then maybe do an interval session the next day, rest again the next, then maybe cycle/swim one day ...etc.  if you are aching more than normal one day then its best to rest, eseicially if your not training for anything in particular - theres no rush - besides you could injure yourself by doing one more session, which means you could miss the next 10 or so.<br>  <br>  Its best to warm up and cool down before and after.  its best to do 10 minutes of joggigng first, to getr your muscles warm to prevent injury - plus do some dynamic stretching (this is different to standing still and stretching your muslces - do stuff like high knees, heel flips, side-to-sides...etc) then start your session.  <br>  <br>  If you're jogging for fitness as it sounds like your already into the swing of things,  try jogging for 30 minutes a day 4 days a week, then if thats well with in your capability (if you feel fine after it and feel you can cope) why not try jogging 5-6 days a week for 30 minutes? or try doing longer runs but at the same speed? or the same run time-wise but try doing the runs faster?<br>  <br>  To answer your question in a nutshell though, its probably best to do a bit of both.<br>  <br>  Why not set yourself a challenge - e.g. a 10K race in the area - target one in about 6 months time so that you have a few months to improve for it, then maybe a few months after try and beat your time.  a good thing about running is that its you against yourself, and when you do manage to beat yourself - its a very good feeling which you have achieved all by yourself, and is well deserved.<br>  <br>  You will soon become fitter and faster and you will deffinatley feel better in general and probably be happier.

"Non Athletic Sport Centerd Around Rednecks"|`|4f39b99c52a20630de221dd45e127722aa	well you kind of answere your own question with tht last statement. that is the attraction for many fans. but nascar has the same appeal that wrestling has. namely, fans get behind a driver and they don't have to worry about him going to another team because he is the team. <br>  also, i don't think the south/midwest lacks sports attractions. those regions are the mainstay of college football and are followed ravenously by their fans. <br>  but mainly it's the allure of the car chase. just as in movies nascar races are basically 4 hour car chases with occasional great crashes. no one cares about a good pass or pit strategy except the most loyal of fans. as in baseball where fans go for the home run, nascar fans go for the crashes. they're rare but often spectacular. and that's the big payoff.|`|QUivr7uVaa	as said above the is plenty of sports in the south. one of the great things about nascar is u dont have to root for one team there is 43 to pick from. how many times is a baseball football basketball game out of reach by halftime? wont happen at the track!<br>  the other is the people i always meet great people at races.<br>  also the camping when do u go to a football game for 4 days? great times|`|VKt82jIEaa	I live in Dallas, and we have tons of sports down here!

Darchinyan is a fluke exposed by Nonito Donaire. kb|`|CG7Z4Oz5aa	mijares will make darchy look silly . i cant wait|`|nbHRfwAjaa	Mijares is one of the best Mexican boxers there is. Probably the best in his division.  He may not be a heavy puncher but he is a a very skilled boxer.  He has proven that by beating Arce.  And who is Darchinyan?  He is a Fraud.  A boxer who relies on his brute strength with no defense at all.  His aura of invincibility has been exposed by Nonito Donaire who knocked him in their fight.  If he is such a great champion, he should have ask for a rematch against Donaire.<br>  <br>  Mijares will win.  |`|qiicHybEaa	If Nonito Donaire can outbox Darchinyan, Mijares will box circles around him.  Donaire beat him by timing him, not getting hit and landing a nice, clean hook that knocked him out.  Mijares is a better boxer than Donaire.  I see him dominating this fight and stopping Darchinyan in six.|`|K0eCc1giaa	Of course Mijares will win... Darchi is always relying from his power shots, but no skills at all. Im pretty sure Mijares will school Darchi if this fight push thru... Anyway the better fight would be Mijares vs. Donaire.
P93I8CHtaa	the team that choked last year|`|xIfvXy4waa	Actually, I agree with you. The Phillies haven't improved their team this offseason, if anything it's gotten worse with the loss of Burrell. Now that the Mets had a big offseason I see them as a big threat. In fact, I predict their choking days are over.|`|mwxKnUleaa	I think the Phillies. Even after the mets go out and get some good relievers I think that wont be enough to overcome the champions|`|FfIqGrdkaa	I am a Mets fan but eh all I am going to say is it is going to be a battle. An all out battle. Way I see it this year there is a possibly that both the Mets and Phillies win 94-102 games. And the Marlins like to fight, and the Braves are improved. It will be a a four team race going into August but come September it will be Mets-Phils again. With the Brewers dismantled, missing both their aces, I think the team that comes in 2nd place in the division will still get the wild card.|`|00aaPLCjaa	i say and think the Philadelphia Phillie's will win the nl east this year with a awesome team this year with cole hamels|`|ak5A435maa	look at my avatar, it says the answer in it|`|sIIsWMElaa	Anything from Philly winning anything is an embarrassment to the sport. Though I'm a yanks fan I pick the Mets to win. The Phillie's don't scare me or anyone else as of now, thats why I'm still shaking my head that they won it. Congrats to them, but that fairytale is over, the losing streak will start again.|`|aEwd0f5Waa	How can you say they have it secure?  The season hasn't even started yet.

The Mets have rebuilt their pen but it's still filled with ?'s. Sure they added K-Rod but he's not great and Putz is better than K-Rod but will be setting him up, so how will he feel about that? The Phils are the team to beat the Mr. Met so lets see how it all pans out. I bet the Mets dont even win 86 games ans miss the playoffs!|`|WzQdqOtPaa	First of all I Feel very sorry that you are a mets fan<br>  <br>  Phillies- have won the past 2 NL East Titles and won the World Series<br>  <br>  Mets- Have proven to be competitive but have had infamous chokes in the past two years.

Any mets fan that says the phillies suck and the mets are going to win know nothing about baseball.  The Mets choke every year.  Its funny how you say the phillies suck.

They have no good or bad storyline connection to each other. As for Undertaker vs Kozlov, I doubt it. Kozlov is still a rising star in WWE while Undertaker is the greatest legend. Since it is the 25th anniverasry WM, Undertaker won't be involved in such a relatively low profile match. More likely it will be the WWE's two biggest legends in a singles match - HBK vs Undertaker!|`|3o8jPdWQaa	They better not have Kozlov go face Taker and win, That would be the gayest thing ever

QYfvgFsXaa	Gloucester, Bath and Leicester all have great atmospheres during the game but in terms of facilities, Northampton has one of the best club stadiums I've ever been to. London Irish is another good one for match day events; last time I was there, they had gigs on around the stadium before the game.|`|dB2BRGRAaa	Kingsholm - great atmosphere on the Shed side, great facilities in the new stand.  Very friendly fans (but aren't all rugby fans?).|`|H5Jrd0siaa	Got to be the Shed.Best atmos,pitch,and good old grumpy glos supports who tells it how it is.<br>  For a big game reading is ok.

DOVbF4Piaa	Are you letting up when you shift ?  You can't shift gears when you are pedaling hard. The chain tension is controlled by the rear derailleur and should not be anything to worry about. If the chain is coming off the smallest sprocket the high limit screw needs adjusted.  It will be marked with a "H" on the rear derailleur and it prevents the chain from moving too far to the outside.  You can turn it in 1/2 turn and try it, if it wont go into the 8th gear or jumps back out you went too far.
EKF2HdZKaa	yes,honestly alot of teams would want him<br>  i do know that the celtics and the cavs are really interested,i personally think the cavs should get either him of smith cause they lack paint usage and a good pf|`|H8u7gMAYaa	I don't know why the cut him. I think he is an awesome player who brings alot of energy and veteranism to his team.<br>  <br>  I think the Celtics will be the team to sign him. They need another big, and he fits that role perfectly.|`|xg4NjusZaa	The Celtics would be the best fit, we desperately need another big man|`|0eMQDINbaa	We could use him. Right now we got freakin Jake Voshkul and Patrick O'Bryant as our reserves lol.|`|8HunHw3Uaa	NO!|`|aupDanleaa	he had1 great year with the nets|`|kYBlgFQAaa	He can be a valuable player off the bench.  I'm not sure what the salary cap implications are for each team, so I can't say where he'll end up.  But, he can be an asset for any of the playoff teams seeking a high energy player off the bench.  What he lacks in skill, he makes up for in effort.  I wouldn't want him as a starter, but coming off the bench he would be great.  Definitely overpaid, but could be a perfect fit for a team like the Celtics.|`|dDhTMacAaa	I think someone actually will.<br>  <br>  Either Boston or Phoenix as the front-runner. <br>  <br>  No doubt the Kings overpaid him after he had a breakout year for the Nets, but he can still be a valued player for a team. He is a tough presence inside and will fight for rebounds and tip-ins.
AA10206865	Looking at the wicket its likely to be a draw but you never know about Pak team..they are so unpredictable....they loose a winning match and again they can tie or win a loosing match.  Bottom line pitch for test should be more balling friendly and challenging for batsman.|`|d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	Looking at the pitch, it could turn out to be a draw...but Murali and Mendis can both turn the ball square on concrete, so it won't be quite as easy for Pakistan as it was for Sri Lanka. Pakistan may end up following on, but they should be able to bat for long enough over two innings to draw the game.|`|dRED4DvNaa	Pitch is looking quit good for batting, and also pakistani batsman have to play extra ordenary cricket to draw this test match. because pakistan is without yousuf, who great pakistan middle order batsman.|`|7oHt9fTkaa	good facts and i think this will be a great farewell to MJ.<br>  SL will win|`|ipt8qUbKaa	6. wicket in each day and 2. wicket in every session,<br>  nice observation kashi-cool|`|8q7WvNxgaa	you can watch live match at <a href="http://cricbrain.com/" rel="nofollow">http://cricbrain.com/</a>|`|wnZ0N3wjaa	Sri Lanka has the best opportunity to win this match and let's see how their bowlers perform.|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	in my opinion,....<br>  with tight fielding  and M&M,...SL can pull this off<br>  <br>  <br>  cheers~

16JetWj3aa	Of course. Personally I was pretty dissaopointed in it. I mean for how many years have they danced around Hunter and Steph really being married, and finally they come out and admit it, and it sucks so hard. Triple H looked like he was going into roid rage - akin to a Bruce Banner transformation into the Hulk. It had a lot of potential to be something special, and new - but to me came out in the end looking like just another promo.<br>  <br>  And yes, VERY rarely will you ever see a shoot on WWE. The last one I believe was Paul Heymans on Edge, JBL, and Triple H at ECW One Night Stand....and it was greatness.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Yes.<br>  All (Well , 99%) Interviews & Promos Used on WWE TV are Scripted or are "Works".<br>  <br>  VERY , VERY Rare You'll EVER See a Shoot Promo on WWE TV.|`|wM9D9w8xaa	YuppYupp :P .. Scripted!|`|OGPW7xZ2aa	yes it was|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	Yes and No. They don't tell the bigger stars what to say in promos generally, Jericho and HBK during there feud where given the general feel of what they should say and they would go them self. <br>  <br>  The questions during the interview with Triple H where scripted but i don't think what he answered was. just a great performer in character saying what he would say in that situation.|`|G9LSZQcaaa	Yeah, everything is scripted.

JD5NQxeNaa	So, as a Knicks fan. I do not care if we get LBJ23 or not. Granted, IMO LBJ23 is the best player in the NBA. But, even if salary cap permitted it LBJ23 to me would still never leave Cleveland. He has a chance at a title in Cleveland and he does not need to go to a large media market to get endorsements. He is LBJ23 for God's sakes he can go to Memphis and still get all the endorsements he desires making it easier to stay in Cleveland. I mean he is 2nd only to Tiger Woods in $ generated by endorsements in Cleveland, so why would he leave if he can make $ anywhere?<br>  <br>  The Knicks still have an excellent shot at signing CB4 and making him the focal point of the team. He seems, like he has lost all motivation in Toronto and he does want the endorsements brought forth playing in a large market, like NY. Then we have the luxury to sign another All-star for the price of 1 and get Michael Redd. He also would not mind playing in a larger market. He had a chance to sign onto Cleveland last time he was a FA. But, decided to stick around Milwaukee cause they made the playoffs that year and played good against Detroit, so he thought they had potential. The Bucks currently are a surprise, but they do not have the $ to hold Redd and at this point of his career would, like to be w/ a All-star and win something. Redd can be the focal point of the offense. He makes more sense than King James in NY cause he would be a better fit for the Knicks than LBJ23 being that he fits Mike D's system perfectly being that he has the quickest release in the NBA and is great in creating spacing. 2 things a D'Antoni team looks for.<br>  <br>  Redd has been top 1-5 or 5-10 in PPG ever since Ray Allen left the Bucks, so because the Knicks shoot a lot of 3's and he will get more FG attempts Redd has a chance to lead the NBA in scoring. <br>  <br>  Not to mention Bosh and Redd are cheaper than James and whomever, so the Knicks would have a great chance to resign the future, which is David Lee so he can compliment the future 2 All-stars by serving as the double double animal he is giving the Knicks a big 3. Knicks can also resign Harrington w/ a vet minimum, Wilcox w/ a small guaranteed contract so he can serve is off the bench, Duhon to start as our PG, and Chandler and Gallo whom will continue into progressing into very good players.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I think LeBron may still consider NY.  While he may have a better chance at winning a title in Cleveland now, who knows what its going to be like in 2 years.  While winning a title in Cleveland would be big, turning the Knicks around to be champions would be an even bigger accomplishment, given their current state,  I mean, as big a market as NY is, bringing a championship there would be a much bigger deal than winning in Cleveland.<br>  <br>  Secondly, endorsements are huge.  Most endorsements do have clauses in them that would pay significantly more if the player moves to a high profile market like NY or LA.  Lebron could sign for the mid level exception if he wanted, and would still make more money in NY just due to the boost in his endorsements.|`|OzDVtamDaa	Only think new your can do is get good role player that dont have large salaries. I think Lebron do want to go to New York but i think that he want to be the first billion dollar althelte more.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	u read the article too huh<br>  well lets face it....the knicks WONT get lebron and they might be stuck not even gettin a decent player lol<br>  this is maybe the first good thing that happened because of the bad economy :)|`|wXxJUnLJaa	LeBron James will never leave Cleveland.<br>  <br>  Hopefully! :)|`|Lxj6kMklaa	If that happens I would be so pissed off, Knicks deserve to get someone like Lebron =]]]|`|HIfs0vgzaa	LeBron James' goal is to win a championship and so far, his best chance to do that is wih Cleveland so I doubt if he will go anywhere else. Money won't be a factor as to whre he would go because no matter where he go, he can get as much money as he will possibly get. Cleveland can also offer the maximun contract for LeBron so his criteria is to where he can get a championship and as of now, it's nowhere else but Cleveland.|`|iCRFNPg9aa	Knicks fans should stop worrying about lebron because there will be plenty other players to go after who you can win a championship with|`|Rhk35LUcaa	new york is playing for lebron but for sure there will be two stars coming to new york and it doesn't have to be lebron.|`|QVDJi2GTaa	Do you beleive in miracles YES!<br>  Haha.<br>  I hope he signs a long contract extension next year.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Honestly doesn't matter. James is staying with you guys for awhile.|`|kmBdx2koaa	nope lebron will stay in clevland just wish he would come to orlando.|`|QRtXp4Fraa	He Should Goto The Celtics|`|eF60R7DPaa	knicks still gettin him
7Xridrxaaa	^^^^^<br>  <br>  hahaha carlos ochoa<br>  <br>  there was never anything good enough about him to get into Europe in the first place. There is forwards in mexico that are 5326325 times better than him. He is overrated and has always been for the exception of like 2 years where he really marked his name in the league. It was a mistake going to Europe in the first place. Now he is running back. Word to all players that go to Europe. If you go to Europe... stay in Europe.|`|HZ8KkQKWaa	he blows anyways......chivas is the only team he will be good in, maybe chivas should of went after him instead of carlos ochoa<br>  <br>  but anyways tigers will blow, there problem is in midfield not in offense<br>  <br>  i think his career is finished he should of never left chivas but i hope he proves me wrong<br>  <br>  @:rafa-great advice "If you go to Europe... stay in Europe."....come back only to retire though<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:will any chivas fan stand up for him?...i hope so becuase omar has done alot for chivas|`|KmMRHKTNaa	I agree with nate, watching tigres play their problem is in the center. i think he should finish this season at deportivo. By the way deportivo is doing pretty good in la liga, he is playing in the best league in the world. i think they are 5th place, which means he can play in the uefa cup next season. this will be a step backwards, and also any romours of giovanni going to america should be false. hes young but he cant make it in barcelona,now tottenham, he should be loaned to the dutch league.|`|3uOv4gOYaa	Come down 'Senoritas' it's not Official YET !! and even if it does become official, its Deportivos LOST, I believe that Omarcito is a PROVEN player just becuase he couldn't  ENCAJAR with Deportivo that doesnt mean his a TRONCO like u AMERICANISTAS are saying.  Do you guys honestly believe that he scored those '100' goals with Chivas by CASUALIDAD or that those 55 games that his played with EL TRI have being CASUALIDADES too.  <br>  <br>  Come the **** down, his only 28 years old his CAREER aint over, how many MEXICAN players wish they could even play ONE game with El Deportivo.|`|GDL00jbIaa	no|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	I havent seen anything on Mediotiempo or televisadeportes, BUT if its true...<br>  <br>  Well it sucks for him, pero what he need right now is that our fowards stay in the rhythim of playing, too much bench time does not help them, I think it shows in our Seleccion. I think Omar has the talent to be out there and do better, but from what I saw in the Deportivo games the coach only plays with one foward, and how u say with out Guardado el Depor aint nothing....<br>  <br>  Well it sucks, no mucho porke aiga salido de Chivas porque es Mexicano and he has the capacity of making it out there....oh well he still young see what happends.<br>  <br>  EDIT: ill admit I was a Chivista saying that he was going to do good out there, and im here!! unlike many Chivistas that talk smack and hide when things happends....i'll admit he failed out there....should he be the one to blame 100% for the lack of playing time? idk...well Lapuente is out of Tigres, see what happends with Omar.|`|ZWyKCsqBaa	Hmm Kikin was playing good in Europe, just lack of playing time. So he then goes back to Mexico. He signs with Tigres. Everyone is saying how good Tigres is. 1st game Kikin doesn't score. 1 year later he finally scores. Now is this going to be the same for Bravo??|`|G3wZfv3Aaa	Omar bravo was a good player, in chivas though. With the mexican team he had he's good runs and bad runs, he just didn't get enough playing time. Sucks cuz I liked this player but to me he's going to be the next kikin fonseca|`|KUDM3Q4Uaa	He could of went to a dif team in Europe<br>  If he came back to Mexico he should of went to Cruz Azul<br>  Tigres is a bad club for him|`|yS9DjJvnaa	haha! I called it. I said he was going to last a year at the most..<br> <br> <br> now he's gonna be a mediocre player for a weak mexican team..|`|8ucq6SEjaa	Noooo!

CutogVC1aa	Well, depends on what you like. Most people will say it's between A Marlin Model 60 to a Ruger 10/22, I've never shot a Marlin M 60, and I have a 10/22 but the only problem I have and many people will agree with me, is they jam very easy, you must keep them pretty clean and well maintained to keep them from doing this, and you can by 25 and 30 round mags for them as well, where will a Marlin M 60 you have a tubular feed magazine that hold 18, 15 or 14 depending on what kind you buy. I believe there Marlin jams less, however one advantage the Ruger has is that it has many aftermarket accessories where the Marlin has few to none. I have a Marlin Model 20 7 rounds clip and I love that thing, fits me fine. If you want to talk about Zombies sometime E-mail me, I've read Max Brooks' Zombie Survival Guide too. Hope this helped.|`|OrvTG44laa	Marlin makes good rifles for good prices.  The Marlin 795 is about 140 dollars.  The Marlin 60 with a scope is 170 dollars.  Save your money.<br>  I've also heard that you have to do a lot to the Ruger before it's the great gun it's supposed to be.  A lot of costly repairs.  But I never owned the Ruger so I don't know if that's true.|`|uzNm9KtYaa	Both guns are excellent!  I have owned them both and can highly recommend both from my personal experience.  You won't find fault with either manufacturer.  They both have high standards and a life-long reputation for quality.  Both companies have my utmost respect.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	I believe Marlin has the market on accuracy with their Micro-Groove  barrel.  I love my Ruger 10/22, but it's not as accurate as my Marlin.|`|HUQMqdDqaa	Ruger 10/22 is one of the best .22's ever made. Marlins are hit and miss, their higher end are good rifles.|`|xKuozocFaa	i have heard very good things about the ruger but i have the marlin and its great|`|AA12211483	marlin|`|FuZIsyYAaa	u pay for quality get the ruger|`|YrxLbfiIaa	The quality is equal ----- BOTH are a fine rifle.....<br>  <br>  That being said -- The Ruger has a box magazine which I happen to like more...<br>  <br>  There are many more aftermarket parts, upgrades, custom parts for the Ruger than the Marlin..... I don't happen to care much for the aftermarket stuff so that has no bearing on my decision......<br>  <br>  Both are decent but I prefer the Ruger because of the magazine... If you just want a simple no hassle rifle either will do.....|`|51jR2Lmlaa	the Ruger 10/22 is one of the most fun guns ever made. It is reliable and has a ton of available aftermarket upgrades.|`|KMASS2Gmaa	This is like telling a virgin about sex. I own both of them and have for years; however, I own 18 Ruger 10/22. I bought six of them at one time when a sporting goods store closed in CA. I teach people basic rifle marksmanship using the 10/22. I personally love the Ruger. Last I looked you can get a Ruger 10/22 at WalMart for less than 200.|`|nBUDjyhgaa	Marlin any day.Ruger is okay in a bolt-action.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* Marlin *|`|5mxy4WaMaa	Both are great.  The Marlin 60 is more accurate, but the 10/22 is more modable.
iO12Vjnvaa	I never watch the prerace...it stinks. I wait until the green flag drops before I ever start watching. Tonight I watched a UFO hunters marathon on the History Channel before the race. Alot more entertaining than the 2 hour pre-race garbage.<br>  The reason they have it is money....nothing else. They aren't doing it for OUR benefit....they are wanting/making more money by doing so.<br>  <br>  Just an opinion as always.|`|n55igpCUaa	If they absolutely have to make more money... START THE PRERACE EARLIER!!!|`|VxN4tnJtaa	$$$ promotions $$$<br>  the almighty dollar|`|jLvlcoFBaa	Money Money Money Money|`|PGlZn1wEaa	Come on Zalex.  Just do something else until the race starts.

tLLWMy7iaa	NEVER!!! The Warriors were THE WORST possible matchup for the Mavericks, Avery knew that and he still refused to try to beat them at the end of the season and knock them out of the playoffs. Don Nelson knows Dirk's game (and weaknesses) like the back of his hand after coaching him for so many seasons. Plus, the Warriors double and triple teamed Dirk the entire series and no one else on the Mavs stepped up to help him. Man, our chance at the title is fast disappearing.|`|4bWUiIVdaa	I'm a myav'rick|`|4640d40d01e0436257faa1bab92bb238aa	LOL what kind if question is that? I loved that series  and only because Mark Cuban  is an arrogant prick who thought  he can buy a  championship<br>  I like Dirk though , poor dude , and I don't know what the hell has happened to him in the past  couple of years  maybe that  Warriors beat down ? I don't know but that was crazy   the MAVS were 67-15  home court advantage and everything   but the SPURS  took it all that year , GO SPURS GO|`|NJtjJA8Baa	Go Warriors.<br>  Idk, but they are probably doing their best to make up for that.|`|NRiSJewTaa	the mavs can do nothing to redeem themselves... they are forever remembered for that|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Come on, why hate?|`|5FypDafWaa	NO!|`|fAMpj8s2aa	wow a few years ago? that's the best thing a warriors fan has? hanging on to a playoff series win and they didn't even make the finals. how sad for you, lmao.|`|4rURc0roaa	They probably do, cause look at the Warriors now, they are complete garbage this season(no offense) LOL

IHh8WaB5aa	You should join because it is very good experience because you get a lot better,but if you do lose a match that means that you just need to work a bit harder so if you face that person again you'll be ready.Also don't get frustrated if you do lose because everyone loses in games.|`|tHQvVgnhaa	its up to you. playing USTA will help you get a lot better. i would advise it|`|KJ58Xi4Kaa	You should join now to get the experience.  If you lose every time it wont hurt your rank that bad.  then when you get to 16 and under you will be able to win more.

After finding out about their interests away from wrestling and the spotlight, then I'd figure out what to do for a date. Probably start off with dinner or a picnic in the park and go from there.|`|pLYY0SlFaa	Well if i could go out on a date with a superstar it would be Evan Bourne. Then id wanna have a walk by the beach and find out about him and his life. Then have a picnic by the beach during sunset =) and then.......<br>  But as long as its with Evan Bourne no matter what were doing ill be happy|`|1qkSumbDaa	diner and a movie|`|iOICjcZcaa	I'd go to a minor league hockey game with them.

wEMlgh6Taa	It's 6:05 EST. and they just got finished with the prayer, singing, etc. and they are belting the guy's in now. Now 6:10 EST. and the command to "Start Your Engines" is finally given, (by Hugh Laurie of "House").  It was supposed to start at 5p.m. I don't know what the delay has been, here or Daytona. Has anybody e-mailed Mike Helton to find out why it keeps getting later and later? If there is a safety issue, I have no problem waiting, I would rather the guys be safe then get hurt,( they could run a scroll across the bottom of the T.V. to let us die hard fans know why the race is running late), but if it is just for FOX to be able to put on the Digger cartoon, then something needs to be said and done. They could even run Digger earlier if it just has to be on the air. Does Nascar even realize how many people are upset with this? We ARE the fans and we are the people that pay to go to the races, and buy the merchandise, and we should have a voice or at the very least an explanation. I think that is only reasonable. Maybe someone at FOX can ask Mike Helton for us!  Now they have a caution for what else- RAIN, it's sprinkling..............|`|sTcuS0G8aa	Dude, I cant believe how long that took. Its already 4 pm. Man. Go Kyle Busch. Jimmy J. was first, and Waltrip last....situation normal folks. Kurts pulling second. We re gonna win this Kyle was sixth!|`|n55igpCUaa	No, FOX wants to promote their crap ;)|`|jLvlcoFBaa	Yes. It is planned for today.|`|b2e454d13dcb8c58423bb1cc2b44f33caa	I agree, Fox screwed up the 500 last week promoting their stupid Digger cartoon. If they had start the race during that prerace show, they would of been close to going the full 500!<br>  <br>  Now they are gonna do it again this week??? Fox your idiots!<br>  Whens the Espn coverage start??|`|9OVm1hL0aa	Gotta leave time for those digger cartoons!<br>  (crap if you ask me) I'd be embarrassed if I were Fox, this is a sporting event, not cheap children entertainment!!|`|VZRJZQxKaa	I dont know but an hour and a half of pre-race crap is tooooooo long.|`|B1fpMEfGaa	fox wants to be promoted

e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	No, there are knockout rules. You don't have to win both games. There are a set of rules, and I'll list them in priority order for you.<br>  <br>  A team progresses to the next round if:<br>  <br>  (a) It wins both games or wins a game and draws the other.<br>  (b) Wins a game, loses the other but scores more goals overall. (Aggregate rule)<br>  (c) Wins a game, loses the other, and if goals scored are same, then the team that has scored more goals away from home progresses. (Away goals rule)<br>  (d) In case of everything being equal, the second leg goes to extra time, where the aggregate rules and the away goals rule apply.<br>  (e) If extra time is goalless, a penalty shootout decides the winner.<br>  <br>  And don't worry mate, Chelsea will win!|`|66dfFiqJaa	Good question! The Scores of both matches will be added together.<br>  Example, Match 1. Che 1-0 Juve<br>  Match 2 Juve 1-1 Chelsea <br>  Score Che 2-1 Juve <br>  If a tie the winner will be who scored the most goals away from their home stadium.|`|QTMCQ55Laa	the score betwen 2 match r added together...ex: if chelsea wins 2-0 n lose 1-0...they still go thru because the combined score is 2-1<br>  <br>  theres is also teh away goal rule...so lets say juventus wins 2-1 at home...n chelsea wins 1-0 at home...the combined score would be 2-2...but chelse go thru because they scored an away goal|`|YLarhhLJaa	it depends on goals, if it's tied then whoever has scored more eway goals win. Chelsea doesn't have to win both game. he may end tie both and still win like 1-1 at home and 2-2 away.|`|feohrngaaa	chelsea have 2 play better than they played against aston villa im a liverpool fan but prefer chelsea than man u but chelsea gonna beat juventus.|`|zjLmhVb4aa	no just win "aggregate" which is they have to score more than juventus in the two games combined, so they can win 4-1 and lose 2-0, but still advance|`|WRwgKZiwaa	The scorelines of the two matches are added together to decide who goes through to the next round.
16vMIGPiaa	No.  Just a movie fantasy notion.<br>  The only way to do this currently is with a pony bottle and that's about the size of a small thermos.
hg8ExtsNaa	yes apples can slow you down.  You are better to have a coffee and a cigarette as they will get ya pumpin|`|v15npNiUaa	Makes no sense.<br>  Apples are fruits, and unless they are secretly injected with anti-protein chemicals then they are good for you in every way!|`|4zSS6IE5aa	Im not sure. But my coach gives the team oranges for sugar I guess. But Im really not sure about that one. Do your own experiment lol.<br>  <br>  :]|`|ubIjMK6Gaa	No, apples are actually healthy for you.|`|82JPSNwpaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  No, what possible reason could it. It makes no sense at all.|`|WCEHUYwXaa	Well it might do if you try and eat the apple while your sprinting|`|ri4Y9Lmbaa	If you are eating them while running a race then yes, they'd slow you down!|`|At6ZJka0aa	Hmmmmm... NO!|`|AgsFlQdJaa	hey. no apples will not slow you down. try eating a banana 1 hr after a race. that'ss good..potassium..energy|`|ThdFMIFUaa	Umm no! Unless you eat one right before you run.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Most definitely will, if you eat them during the race, wait until you cross the finish line to bite into it.|`|rJgrwIodaa	I run every other day and I eat apples every other day.  Each time I run, I cut at least 30 seconds off my two mile minimum.  That should be an adequate answer.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	I don't believe so but a heavy lunch or calorie laden junk can inhibit your performance on the field.|`|44ab537503b323dcb61fd2a3b8221f88aa	come on, think about it, that doesn't make any sense WHAT SO EVER. Its not like when you eat an apple it attaches ten pound weights to the bottom of your shoes.|`|VZFEB85Iaa	hmm never heard of that one.  but i would much rather have grapes :)
kqP7GwOcaa	Galento didn't have the conditioning necessary to beat George Chuvalo, George may not have had the speed and lateral movement of the better heavyweights of his day, but he was tough, had a granite chin, and came in shape.  Physical conditioning makes up for a lot of technical flaws in a boxers style, and even though "Two Ton" Tony was a heavy puncher, he was also just plain heavy.  Chuvalo would have worn down Galento with pressure and eventually KOed the big guy.|`|AA12325046	While it lasted, this would have been a fun fight.  Chuvalo is one of the toughest fighters of all time and he was never knocked off his feet in close to 100 fights against some of the most devastating punchers of all time.  He was also a pretty darn hard puncher with good endurance.  Galento was a short and powerful left hooking specialist with a nasty attitude in the ring.  But he was also quite easy to hit and did not have the stamina of George.  The first few rounds Galento would land some good shots to the head of Chuvalo who would shake them off and throw some hard ones of his own.  Finally with Galento tiring badly in round 8, Chuvalo would deck him with a series of punches.  Galento would get to his feet, but the referee would mericifully halt the fight.|`|osPstl3jaa	George Chuvalo all the way. Chuvalo was a fierce body puncher and he would have attacked that spare tire that Galento carried around his waist. Problem with Galento was he had power but he threw his punches too wildly and he was susceptible to getting countered.Chuvalo would have countered him with a right hand or a left hook and good night Tony!|`|910875de6723862c69bd16bf9f5b2249aa	Chuvalo win.  Galento has to knock Chuvalo out and that isn't going to happen.|`|dh48AkbCaa	chuvalo stops two ton tony in the final rounds.|`|CDeZOLmgaa	Chuvalo wrecks Galento, it would be exciting while it lasts but at no point in the fight would I see Chuvalo getting hurt, he would be taking shots that would look good but he would feel no ill effects, Chuvalo land more, land harder and boxes a little more then Galento and ends a battle weary Galento inside of 8 rounds.<br>  <br>  A big tough puncher with an iron jaw beats a smaller tough puncher with less of a jaw every time out.
NR5LhOpPaa	Try it!  A lot of people like putting powerful strings on a controlled frame.  You might not want to string it fully with the luxilons, but using them in a hybrid set is quite popular.  <br>  <br>  There's no formulas for what strings are good on what racquets.  It comes down to individual preferences. And it never hurts to try something out.  Worst that happens is you don't like it, and you try something else the next time.|`|0x61Cyhsaa	You simply get a balanced racket, instead of a power racket or a control racket.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	THE WORLD GOES OUT OF BALANCE AND WE COLLAPSE INTO A BLACK HOLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  It'll just end up being a in between racquet, so good power and good control. If its meant for control, then its for people who want control. But if you want a bit of both, then yea control racquet with power strings make a balanced racquet.
HqQmZfA6aa	The thing that beats you in tournaments is lack of technique and lack of fight stamina. Road work is fine, but at this point I don't think it is specific enough.<br>  <br>  Two weeks out, I would spend the next week rolling with intensity every day, as much as possible, concentrating on defense in positions you are not comfortable in. And don't give up. Just keep going until you are dizzy with exhaustion, then go again! Win the mental game! Have your partner get you in positions you hate or that you are weak in and work to regain dominant control without giving up more points. <br>  <br>  When you feel exhausted, tell yourself that it is time to go harder, because he will also be exhausted and chances are he is teetering on the edge of giving up just like like you might be. So that is the time to strike!<br>  <br>  The second week, I would roll lighter but work with your coach to tighten up technique. Don't try and add MORE because you'll waste your time. Work on deepening the skills you already have. Ask your coach where he thinks you need to work on and do that whilst you also work to make you strengths even stronger.<br>  <br>  After the tournament, win or lose, take notes about how you felt, how the mind was, what was good and what needs improvement.<br>  <br>  From your first tournament, if you develop the tenacity to never give up and always be mentally tough, your whole career with skyrocket.|`|ySz84fB5aa	well, i am a wrestling coach. but in my opinion i would continue to run every day and work on your cartio. and some people say that you should not lift a week before.but being a high school coach lifting is a very psychological boost for them. about a week before the match you should lessen the time that you practice the sport but increase the intensity. anyway man. i hope it works out for you. this is my advice that i would do so take what you will from it.
WGGZ1frKaa	You haven't competed in any BJJ tournament yet and you're almost a blue belt? Get yourself signed up for grapphlers quest/NAGA it's coming up in March/April!

In my school/gym we have a team (TeaM Carlson Gracie) and we have like a team uniform and go to competitions all together.|`|rh4MS9Rvaa	wen you are ready|`|ySz84fB5aa	that sounds like a choice that every man has got to make for himself.
bGuVAltxaa	John O'Shea will play centre half if Evans doesn't make it, Rafael at right back then Ferdinand and Evra.|`|FFE9Qztzaa	They have no "options". Inter will take fully advantage of that and win the encounter.|`|mK06dus9aa	... panic ...|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	We could always play 3-5-2 or 3-4-3.That way we can go all out on attack and push Inter so far back in their own half the only time they touch the ball is when they pick it out of their own net.<br>  <br>  I'I guess Fletcher would have to fill in at the back if none of them are fit.I'm hoping Sir Alex plays all our big guns,and especially Berbatov,Rooney,Tevez and Ronaldo,with Giggs as the playmaker and Carrick to hold down the fort.That'll be awesome.|`|QuWgt3Aeaa	IF john O Shea is fit then he will take the central defending role but if he is not then SAF said that he will rather play James Chester (uncapped defender) or somebody might play out of position.

lKQPPifDaa	You have four quarters fifteen minutes each. At the beginning of the game their is a coin toss. You choose to either receive the ball or kick it to the other team. On offense a team has four tries to pick up 10 yards or a first down. Then the cycle repeats. They can either have somebody run the ball or have the quarterback pass it to somebody other than the offensive linemen. Defense is really basic: stop the offense from moving forward. When a team gets in the end zone it is 6 points. Then they have the choice of going for a 1 point kick or a 2 point conversion in which they need to get into the endzone again. Also, at any time a team can put their kicker on the field and if the field goal is good it is worth 3 points.That's a basic explanation, just watch some more and it will all make sense.|`|15qceXaOaa	First the game is 60 minutes long. The game clock starts when one team kicks off the ball. Then the recieving team catches the ball and tries to run it as far as they can. then when the other team tackles the runner the quarterback, wide reciever etc. come out onto the feild and try to run or throw the ball for a 6-point touchdown. If they make the touchdown then the kicker tries to kick the ball through the feild goal posts for an extra point. If they dont make it all the way to the touchdown then they try for a 3 point feild goal. If they dont even make it that far the they punt it for the other team to recieve. and it just keeps going on like that until time runs out.|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	check out|`|1bAFv3Yqaa	if the shoe fits ...|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	offense<br>  you throw the ball to the end of the field and get someone to catch it each time.  Or run it to the end of the field.<br>  <br>  <br>  defense        <br>  prevent above from happening|`|3BB8EtdNaa	lol neither do I, but my bf(sorta) does =]|`|IiscnSGGaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football</a><br>  <br>  <br>  their that should do it|`|wyGbmN9Taa	It is too complicated.

Fat6h6aRaa	because their team sucks|`|uxregJ0faa	Well their ignorant. You will see what  i mean<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: yea ^^ pretty much sums it up. Sad.|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	i guess people are jealous of your team and i dont think you are a bandwagon i am a heat fan so yea|`|yt05KPhBaa	People love to hate. That's like saying people say you're a Kobe Jocker because you think he's the best basketball player. That's why I'm a fan of Trevor Ariza. When he becomes the NBA's all time greatest Defensive player, no one can say I bandwagoned him.|`|9UhoUcM2aa	cause those people who assume are bored with their lives and like to start drama because their team sucks.|`|R8N2QTU9aa	why does it matter!? u like what you like should u care what other people think,,, unless u really are on the bandwagon....|`|Zt1VDawZaa	Cause I said so.|`|AOtnoozdaa	You should cheer for whatever team you want.  It's like voting for who you want to have as president, it's your choice.  I just hate it when people get all pissy because you choose to cheer for a different team or vote for a different president than them.  I'm from southern Wisconsin and cheer for Milwaukee teams.  Are they good most of the time, no, do I lose my sanity watching them every now and again, yes, but I'm not going to lose sleep and get all bitchy and jealous because the Celtics and Yankees get all the attention and are successful franchises.  They have earned the right to recieve the attention they get.  If you want to cheer for the Celtics or Yankees it's your choice.  People take sports too seriously and some judge people based off simple differences like the sports team they cheer for or what party they vote for, and that's what sets this country apart unfortunately.  If you want to cheer for the Celtics, Lakers, and Cavaliers then it's your choice.  It's not up to anybody but you.|`|h9ZRYMWzaa	well if you liked the Celtics before they got good and made those blockbuster trades then your ovbiously not a bandwagon fan|`|NmXKPDoIaa	I could care less who's a bandwagon fan or not....<br>  <br>  but it is easy to tell who is and who isn't
aiBSMFWmaa	If you need SP hes a great bargain. He feature a 93MPH+ fastball and is worth your time. The new mets bullpen only improves his value. Look for a nice year out of the undervalued Mets fireballer!!!<br>  <br>  -No question, pick him up!
OHs8yJiOaa	Yes, they really honor the 60-day perfect fit thing. They simply clean and resell the used shoes at a discount at their stores (and at race expos) to those who want them.<br>  <br>  Last I checked, I think you only get one "free" exchange by mail per year though, and have to pay return shipping yourself on anything thereafter (if being sent back under the perfect fit thing). If you have a physical store nearby so don't have to return by mail, you don't have to worry about that.<br>  <br>  They do keep track of what you've paid initially for shoes, so you might have to pay a little more or get a credit when you exchange for a more or less expensive shoe rather than just changing size or something comparable.<br>  <br>  The VIP thing is usually a good deal, especially if you indeed buy 5 pairs in a year across a family to get a 6th for free. It's also nice to combine the VIP 10% off with the other discounts they constantly have available.<br>  <br>  I will note that they've recently been doing free shipping for everyone -- that's normally just available via the VIP program. Also, last fall, they were letting people sign up for the VIP program for something like $1.99 for the first year.<br>  <br>  Finally, do be aware that they actually have two VIP levels -- one if you sign up in store, and a more expensive one if you're signing up via website. The more expensive one includes free shipping on all orders, the in-store one assumes you're doing all purchases in store and doesn't include the shipping, but is otherwise the same. (And they're doing free shipping for everyone right now anyway--if you have a local store, you'd likely want to sign up there rather than via the website.)<br>  <br>  Anyway, if you're looking to try some different shoes out beyond what you'd be able to do in a store somewhere, yes, they do what they say. Especially if you have a RoadRunner nearby so you don't have to worry about return shipping when you exchange under the perfect fit thing, it's a great way to find your shoe.
n1eSGvN6aa	For 7th grade those are very nice times. Actually, that 100m is very impressive!!! For HS you will want like 15-16's for 110m hurdles and low 50's to high 40's for 300 hurdles. I think these times are very good!

vnzSTerjaa	neither, both are great QB's and ur stupid for even thinking up this question >:O|`|PVe6jK78aa	I would say Leinhart. And the people who said tom brady are just pissed because he's so good its unfair. He went to 5 AFC championship game in his 7 years of starting in the NFL (not counting 2008 for obvious reasons). 2001,2003,2004,2006,2007. Which lead to 3 superbowl rings and 4 superbowl berths so hes clearly one of the best QB's to ever play the game. Those punk bitches complaining are jealous D-bags.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Everyone who is saying Rivers is saying so for reasons unrelated to being a QB.  Yelling at fans, taunting a QB, whining about something, what does that have to do with someone's ability to play QB.  The question was NOT who do you like more, it was who is a worst QB.<br>  <br>  Anyone who says Rivers to this question is proving they know nothing about the game of football.  When someone leads the league in passing by a considerable margin, thows more than 3 TDs per INT, and throws for 4,000 yards, how can you say he's a bad QB.  Personal feelings aside, no one can honestly think that Rivers is a bad QB.<br>  <br>  Eli, on the other hand, really is overhyped and is nowhere near as good as Peyton.  This was easily his best season statistically, and he was roughly 20 points lower in rating than Rivers and about 800 yards fewer.  Eli is known for throwing a lot of INTs, as this was his first full season with less than 17.  Rivers' high is 15.  Eli has a career passer rating of 76.1, which is considered below average, at best.  I'm not saying that Eli sucks, but he is overhyped because his last name is Manning and also partly because he plays in the huge media market that is New York.<br>  <br>  In reality, there is no comparison here.  Rivers' numbers show he is far the superior QB.  On top of that, he's doing it in San Diego, a place that Eli thought he was too good to play in, because he didn't think he could have a good career there.  He pretty much hand picked the team he went to, and Rivers is outperforming him in the place Eli said he couldnt have a good future in.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	Both are very good.<br>  <br>  But Eli is nowhere near as good as he is hyped up to be. He cannot carry a team without a dominant running game or his top receiver; as evidenced by the Giants losing four out of their last five games last year with Brandon Jacobs banged up and Plaxico Burress out.<br>  <br>  Quarterbacks in years past like Brett Favre, John Elway, and Dan Marino won under similar circumstances.|`|9Zbh8HZxaa	Peyton Manning was the M.V.P  .<br>  Phillip cry me a Rivers  team went 8-8 ? i dont care what your Q.B. rating is he didnt do anthing but lose, he is a loser and always will be! he will never be in the same company as either Manning. Plus Rivers is a whimp! (fact)!|`|KTp27Fokaa	As much as I hate Rivers, he is much better than Eli.<br>  <br>  Eli is only good because he has a good running game. Without good receivers, he's nothing (and he was exposed heavily when Plax was off the team)|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Eli is seriously overrated just because of that ring. I have to admit Phillip is the better QB even though he is a douchebag.|`|15wwA3jjaa	Eli Manning, he rode the coattails of an excellent defense all the way to the Super Bowl in 2007, and after losing Plaxico Burress he fell apart last season.  Philip Rivers on the other hand is putting up huge numbers with a receiving core made up of players nobody has ever heard of.|`|DvKpx0Reaa	LOL @ the idiots who said tom brady. <br>  Eli manning is worse. at least rivers has the stats to back up his trash-talking. shoot burress in the leg and ELI is the one who's screwed.|`|62WH4QoAaa	WOW YOUR AN IDIOT MANNING WAS A PRO BOWLER THIS YEAR AND RIVERS LED THE NFL IN QB RATING, IF THE PRO BOWL WAS DECIDED AT THE END OF THE SEASON (WHICH IT SHOULD BE) THEN HE WOULD HAVE MADE IT|`|8wmjYlfaaa	What Todd said.<br>  he doesn't take responsibility for his own accidents, he blames his receivers and/or offensive line.definitely the crybaby of all the QB's.|`|2CuuIT70aa	Eli, Rivers has proved himself to be one of the best QBs in the league.|`|AA10225723	As a Viking fan, I'd love to have either of those "worst" QB's on my team. Especially that horrible Eli Manning. LOL.|`|hVwqWQRoaa	It's Va Jay-jay Cutler the only QB to lead a team that was in 1st place alone the whole season and not make the playoffs!<br>  LMFAO|`|54587a005ce491d9b4862a09ef7af9acaa	I think We can quickly eliminate Eli "I got My ring 4 years faster than My superstar brother" Manning so, that would leave Phillip "I talk a lot of smack but, can't back it up with a ring" Rivers.|`|9gIsxKdWaa	How many of you guys can even make a highschool team much less the pro's? I don't like a crier either. I think Eli cried his way into the game for going to daddy to get out of going to the Chargers. I may not like him but he has a job way better than mine with a lot more stress than anyone of us. Imagine having to do your job in front of millions every week and to read what others who could never qualify say about your short comings. It's a tough job. Do better than they can, then you can talk your talk. Nothing personal but show a little respect to these guys who lay it on the line every week. They have dedicated most of their lives to get where they are at.|`|qnREirWSaa	Rivers definitely half his throw he was sacked and just threw the ball in the air and he got lucky a receiver was there and then he was like YEA! but he knew he was thinking damn luck or wtf? oh and he dissed a prow bowler QB Cutler that's a slap!|`|Me2R46RZaa	Lets see one already won  a Superbowl and the Other is already a Top QB in the LEAGUE so neither one of them is the worst QB in the league<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The worst QB has to be Carson Palmer. He didnt do S*** last year hes waay overrated|`|xgBNImTHaa	Jamarcus Russel<br>  <br>  <br>  eli and phillips are good they have their days|`|vPGy21vMaa	Philly , because he cries during the game.

It is pointless though when the commentator just uses it for social purposes.
HVpeJzM4aa	why you even brought up skateboarding is beyond me...it's a completely different practice than snowboarding. <br>  But to answer your question based on your WEIGHT, get a board around 156cm in length or higher...the higher the number the faster you will go but also keep in mind if the board is too long for you and your skills are sub-par it will be hard for you to turn. <br>  <br>  also it depends on what type of riding you want to do...park, mountain or a combination of both. parks require softer boards, while mountain boards you want them on the stiffer side, and if you do both probably a mid-flex. (bindings should match style of riding as well.)<br>  <br>  lastly...you never want to get DECENt snowboard clothing..you want something definitely waterproof, keeps you warm but doesn't over-heat you with activity, etc: my suggestion...avoid burton, and go with the North Face triclimate with hyvent technology. It's comparably priced to any good jacket with the exception that it has a lifetime guarantee of waterproofing, it's lightweight, and it's extremely breathable. The other jacket companies out there are waterproof but the more you wash them or wear them the faster the chemically treated material loses it's water repelling abilities. North Face is definitely worth the investment! Ditto on the pants.<br>  <br>  And most importantly select boots based on your style of riding...again they come in stiff, mid-stiff, etc. good brands are 32, vans, ride just to name a few. Boots are the second most important part of a snowboard package.|`|GH0B7GLCaa	CLothing is just a preference, find something comfortable and water proof.  WAter proofing is totally key, especially if its breathable.  TAking it to the next level means your gonna fall a lot so get clothing that will keep you dry, riding wet is the worst thing ever.  AS for a board cheaper (200) dollar Burton, Firefly, Morrow are alright.  Bindings, go with Ride if your just getting into some tricks, theyre uber light and its less weight to get off the ground, good luck
Lv9rLFgwaa	I was googling this question a few weeks ago, as i wanted to increase my stamina(which is already quite good) so i enjoyed football more.<br>  <br>  And the best way seems to be interval training? i think thats it.

Run a bit everyday. Make sure you cant twist your shoes around this means they have better support. Most of all don't try to beat the other people try and beat your personal best.

Also drink lots of water.|`|ZC5VTd5caa	okay i Have emailed you and you haven't replied yet and that was over a month ago!!!! i get the message u dont want to talk to me. but 1 question why?|`|VCzsfVM5aa	set goals and time yourself. Like everything practice makes perfect, in the instance of running, the more you do it will only improve your cardiovascular system.  Start with a mile and time how long it takes you to run it, from there keep doing it until you improve your times.  After a while you will be running 5-10 miles without a problem, at the same time you will improve lung capacity etc.  Its very important to warm up before and after to prevent cramping, also keep hydrated.|`|wTfEYPsIaa	You never should run as fast has you can you have to pace your self!|`|2gz6ad5kaa	hey first buy a nice pair of running shoes. and just go on a nice 30 minute run with a friend. never run alone and use the buddy system.|`|o55k9RVVaa	try running alittle at home. one day run for a minute without stopping and then each day increase the time and that will hopefully improve your running :)|`|cUqvqkkJaa	First off, how do you suck?<br>  <br>  Are you just slow in general?<br>  Do you get out of breath easily?<br>  Are you on the heavy side?<br>  Is it long distance running or sprinting?<br>  <br>  If your average height and build as all the other kids then all you might need is a little guidance from you p.e teacher on technique and pacing yourself. Speed is achieved with good momentum and rhythm. Arms and legs should move in harmony, arms tight, legs loose. I find that once i have rhythm, the faster i move my arms, the faster my legs move! Don't take huge strides either but find a good balance for landing and taking off. Take off from the ball of your foot and land on your heel. Breathing is also very important, try keep it too the rhythm of your stride. If this is a problem, only practicing will help keep it controlled. Warm up and stretch before you start a race, get the Adrenalin pumping!<br>  <br>  Your best bet is asking your teacher for help. Try practicing at home, run round the block and time yourself. Doesn't have to be far, 5, 10 Min's everyday. After 2 weeks you'll see yourself getting fitter and faster. Momentum and rhythm...and breathing! I'm no athelete but i love to run, sprinting and long distance.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps, its hard to describe without showing someone!|`|UAaEbc32aa	when you're running, you mainly use your arm muscles and your stomach muscles. when you run, you pump your arms, and they give you more momentum to go faster. try doing 20-40 sit ups a day, and about 20 push ups a day. when i started running, i was bad too. but once i started doing sit ups and push ups, i became a stronger runner.<br>  <br>  Also... Just practice. Run a bit everyday. Make sure you cant move around in your shoes, that way they have better support. Most of all don't try to beat the other people try and beat your personal best.  Also drink lots of water.<br>  <br>  good luck! hope i helped ;P|`|ubIjMK6Gaa	Try running on your own, that will improve your endurance and stamina. As for sprinting, you just need to build muscle.

gAftPN59aa	Here is the real answer. Way back when (1904) the Okland A's formerly known as the Philadelphia A's was the first place team in the newly formed American League. The National League champions at that time was the New York Giants. <br>  Even though in 1903 both league came to the agreement that the two league champions would face in a "World Series". the agreement wasn't binding. The manager for the Giant's John McGraw refused to play the A's because they weren't up to a "Major League" standard, and called them "White Elephants".<br>  (Why that is an insult is another question) however Connie Mack the manager/owner of the A's liked the conotation and started to use it as a defacto mascot (teams back then didn't have masscots atleast not the ones like today) And ever since than the elephant has been an important symbols for the Philadelphia/Kansas City/ Okland A's|`|cuqHAp8Qaa	You can't have a giant walking "A" as your mascot|`|qivUrJ3Naa	Why is the San Diego chicken a mascot, or the Philly fanatic what is that?

lVGHhDn1aa	Yea, I never knew that baseball was supposed to be run like a communist nation. I always thought the point of having and making money was to spend it and improve your product.|`|ftidgUNXaa	I think the Yankees addressed most of their problems this season.  They needed pitching and they now have an extremely strong pitching rotation (and they still got Rivera as their closer).<br>  <br>  I personally believe the Yankees will win it all this year, the team is much stronger this year than it has been in years.|`|NpqAbZqpaa	Watch the chain reaction.<br>  <br>  Yankees bid on Free Agents<br>  Prices for free agents goes up<br>  Prices that other teams sign free agents for go up<br>  Payroll for other teams goes up<br>  Ticket prices for other teams go up<br>  Ticket prices for Yankees goes up<br>  Less money in the pocket of fans.<br>  <br>  So, while the Yankees may not get all the free agents, they bid on most of them and agents know that they sometimes only have to mention the Yankees and the price goes up.<br>  <br>  Teams aren't in business to lose money, so that is passed on to the fan, directly (ticket prices, concessions) and indirectly (the cost of advertising comes from a sponsor who is advertising so they can get more money so all that cost is put into the products/services they sell)<br>  <br>  <br>  So, when teams spend money like the Yankees, it affects EVERYONE that enjoys baseball and even those that don't (corresponding increase in product costs)<br>  <br>  Does that make sense?|`|frDcAqyWaa	it hasn't worked in almost a decade.  they have not addressed their needs, they still don't have a bullpen out side of the hall of famer at the end of it.|`|0B75Q81jaa	All the money they spend hasn't paid off in a while. The winter they signed Mussina was the beginning of it. The Sox "settled" for Manny that winter and the rest is history. Sox are adding 1-2 young home grown players every year while the Yanks have nothing but Joba to brag about. Papelbon, Lester, Pedroia, Youkilis, Buchholz, Lowrie to name more than a few and there are more just waiting in line.|`|cfmbN4pPaa	I personally think its because its to easy for teams to loose fan favorite players. ya cant put tags on them or anything like that...so people get ticked and its usually the yanks or my beloved Bosox that sign them:) it does how ever really make it difficult for a low budget team to be competitive and can make it a long and boring/miserable season for their fans. just cause ya buy up a bunch of free agents doesnt mean you gonna be sports a ring anytime soon. the yanks/mets and dodgers have proven that.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, its because most teams don't really see it as "fair"  Case and point, the NFL has a salary cap and every team has to play within the same guidelines, so the playing field is considered fair.  Every team can essentially compete for the same players, because they're all given a certain amount of money to spend.<br>  <br>  In baseball, there are no guidelines. A team like the Florida Marlins has a whole payroll less than A-Roids salary.  They can't even compete to keep their own players.  The NFL has franchise tags that will allow you to keep 1 player.  The NBA will allow a team to go over the cap to sign their own free agent, and they have max contracts, so one team can't offer more than a player's current team can offer.  In baseball, its not like that.  <br>  <br>  Essentially you pay your scouts to find good talent, you grow them in your own farm system, then they come up to the majors and you get them for 6 years before they go to the Yankees for $20 million a season, and you can't even afford to compete.  You can't really blame the players for selling out and taking the money, I mean most people would.  Its just, how would you feel if you're a fan of another team knowing you can't even keep your own players because the Yankees will offer them way more then they're worth.  Its like you're playing catchup constantly.  Look at Cleveland, they knew last year there was no way they could keep Sabathia, so they were forced to trade him.  Milwaukee decided to trade for him cuz they figured they get him for a playoff push, and even if they lose him, they get a first round pick as compensation because he's a type A player.  Then they get royally f**ked in the end because although they lost a type A player, Texiera was rated higher on the list than Sabathia, so the first round pick they counted on went to the Angels.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	NO If you the Yankees you get the Most Profiled Players available, like A FRAUD, Pettitie and Now CC none of them will win a World Series for the Bronx Bombers because they are all a Complete Waste of Talent and Money.

cVBSsbodaa	It's mostly about personal preference - I know many people who like to use the foamy thick kind - I personally do not like it at all.<br>  <br>  The reason I like regular grip tape more is that I bought my racket based on how well the grip fit in my hand, and the thick tape makes the whole handle larger, so I have a hard time holding it as well. The thinner grip tape is more true to the size of the racket and is more like the original grip you had in the first place.<br>  <br>  You could always put the grip tape on, and if you don't like it, just put the thicker tape over it. :]|`|BJnv2PSkaa	I like the thick grip.Its much more comfortable,so after a long match it comes in handy.|`|NR5LhOpPaa	If you are replacing the grip itself, you need to put on the thicker Wilson grip.  <br>  <br>  The thinner tape is meant as an overgrip.  Overgrips are actually placed on top of the regular grip, in order to increase the grip size slightly. They can't function as the base grip.<br>  <br>  Two big reasons for this:<br>  The thicker grip has adhesive on the back, to adhere it to the bare handle.  The grip tape does not.  If you put the thin grip tape on the bare handle, it would slide around.<br>  <br>  The other reason, is that the grip tape doesn't provide enough cushioning to be used without a real cushioned grip underneath.  It would be very uncomfortable.|`|XGWAGbw3aa	spongy grip is besy in my opinion|`|u5cn9tOEaa	you should go with a tape grip for overgrip but for a base grip make it spongy|`|KJ58Xi4Kaa	get the tourna grip.  it is easy to put on and it wont drasticly change your grip size.|`|8a211ed91fb541b0e17339ca2249b9a6aa	i prefer tape grip

They haven't scored a goal in the Premier League since January 31.  That's almost a month.  If they can't score a goal against West Ham, Tottenham, and Sunderland, they can't get a goal against Roma. Also, Fabregas is injured and he won't come back until March or April.<br>  <br>  Liverpool:  I think they will lose against Real Madrid.  They just drawed against Man City, a team that has been struggling, at home.  Real Madrid haven't lost since Barcelona beat them in December, which is no surprise.  They are on a roll, but haven't faced Liverpool, who has had success in the Champions League almost every time when Rafa Benitez was manager.  But I think he Rafa is under heavy pressure and he won't handle it like he used to.<br>  <br>  Chelsea:  I think Guus Hiddink turned this team around and he's much better than Scolari.  I think they will win against Juve.  Chelsea's hopes in the UCL are much brighter.<br>  <br>  Manchester United:  They are always good, but they always struggle against Italian teams.  They are better, but not by much.  I would say they would win the aggregate against Inter, but they won't win at San Siro.  Both teams are paired unfairly.

Surfing wetsuits are made to be very flexible.<br>  <br>  The Surfboard Man<br>  <a href="http://www.thesurfboardman.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesurfboardman.com/</a>|`|xhPKkkELaa	There are lots of wetsuits that are sport specific, but quite often, they can be fairly generic. When I started surfing over 40 years ago, the wetsuits we wore were all designed for scuba diving. They had front zippers, and metal snaps, that damaged both the surfboard, and sometimes very delicate portions of our bodies.<br>  <br>  In general, surfing wetsuits have zippers in the back and are made of differing thicknesses of neoprene. Many diving wetsuits are one thickness throughout, because they don't have as many 'flexibility' panels. I haven't dived for years and years, but I still snorkel sometimes, and do a lot of shopping at a neighborhood dive shop. Scuba Max, Henderson, Mares, US Divers are scuba oriented brands. O'Neill Billabong, Hurley, Quicksilver tend to be surfing styles. However, most of the big manufacturers make suits suitable for both. <br>  <br>  DON'T buy a wetsuit on line (see the question from the guy who asked about one he bought on-line that didn't fit right). Whether you go to a dive, surf, or general sports shop, the folks there will help you get the right suit. Good luck.|`|KkkugCJ0aa	i think they're called drysuits for scuba diving because they dont let any water into the suit

I will say that in most bars, your opponent looks for any nit-picky way to end your turn and thus the double kiss is generally considered an illegal shot.|`|UNUJNgHxaa	first off there is official rules for this game. One rule is the ball must go in the pocket called. If the ball hits a rail it must be called that way. the que ball can do anything AFTER it hits the intended ball (as long as it does NOT hit the intended ball again). But before it hits the ball, the que must do what has been called. For example it the que hits a rail it must be called that way. There is also a ruled called the shooters rule. That rule states that if a shot was called, and hit with perfection then it is ruled as good. If the shot was made and it was NOT the way the shooter had intended it to go, then it is mandatory that the shooter state it as a "slop" shot. I can tell you that if it looked like a slop shot, then it most likely was a slop shot. I have been playing pool for a very long time and In most cases, For me to INTEND for the que ball to "double" kiss another ball is extremely hard to do, and extremely rare to be able to do.

Aluminium alloys can oxidize (analogous to rust, which is oxidation of iron/steel).<br>  <br>  That all said, a bike can last for decades if kept clean, oiled and protected from weather / moisture during storage ... or be destroyed quickly if poorly maintained. The critical "component" is therefore the rider/owner.

svEdo4FBaa	Loveland Ski Area is the nearest lift-ticket ski area to where you're going.  It's a good mountain too.  But just half an hour past that you've got Arapahoe Basin, Breckenridge, Copper Mountain, and Keystone, and those are world-class (A-Basin is the smallest of the 4 but has a high percentage of advanced terrain).<br>  <br>  Depending on how late your spring break is, there might be enough snow in the backcountry to have a great time for free - Loveland Pass (close to Loveland Ski Area) is an awesome spot that's very close to the greater Denver area.  Go west on I-70, get off at Exit 216 for US-6 West, and drive up the hill.  When  you get to the top, there's a small parking area, and a driver can drop off everyone who's snowboarding, drive back down a couple of miles, and pick everyone up that's just ridden down the mountain.  It's incredible, especially considering the price.|`|b384db6ad40e335e34a6b836f0c3ea3baa	Hank is right. Also look up Winter Park. It is a large resort as well. You might want to try looking up Eldora, I've never been there, but it is a bit cheaper. Also, Echo Mountain is a small place with only 2 runs and the mountain is all one big terrain park, but it is the closest place to Denver (only about 30 minutes) and is cheaper than the big mountains as well. Prices at Copper, Breck, Keystone, etc are 90+ dollars - not cheap! If you decide to go to Copper or Winter Park, email me and I may be able to get you a discount depending on when you are coming out.

d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	You think a supercross race is too long? Have you ever watched NASCAR? The reason that the Lites class is broken up that way has nothing to do with the size of the class. Only 20 guys are going to qualify no matter how many show up. The reason they do this is because the young kids coming out of the amateur ranks are not ready to race an entire professional season, so by making an east and west division they each only have to race half of the season. As far as the LCQ, it is just like the other guy mentioned, it is for riders that may have DNF'd their heat and to give more riders a chance to qualify since you have 3 gates of riders instead of 2.|`|qK1w972yaa	The 250 class was sooooooo big that they broke it up into 2..east and west..<br>  <br>  You have to remember all these kids need a shot at the main..they all have alot of money wraped into this sport..<br>  <br>  If they only had the race it would all be over in about 20 min..People paid big money to get to the show....I think it should be longer...longer races...|`|5a1aa56c6591c1edf54e7a20cf077fc4aa	Yes it is where the races are held, plus the 250 class is so huge that there would be to many riders at each event so it gives it a chance to split it up.  As far as the LCQ  if a rider wrecks or get taken out in his heat then it gives him and everybody esle an equal platform to make it into the main..  i like it personally... I think they could do away with qualifying  to shorten it up...

We can order tickets now through Phase 1 of ticket sales and they will tell us which matches we get in April.

However, less people are thinking about the World Cup now so there is a higher chance to get tickets in this phase. <br>  <br>  As far as selling tickets the month of, it all depends on which team is playing in the game. From the last 2 World Cups I went to- Brazil, England, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Japan, and Germany team tickets can get you the most money.

sptrtwxlaa	yes<br>  what the heck, NO!<br>  and yes<br>  <br>  Tennis is amazing and fun but takes so much hard work, suicide sprints, footwork drills, and endurance runs.<br>  <br>  The mentality for tennis is gonna be new for you because it is unlike any other sport. It is all you out there and only you (I'm a singles player) -there are no timeouts, no halftimes. That can only be learned from experience of matches, after you hit 50 you will get much better. <br>  <br>  Tennis requires so much skill and technique in every shot from the forehand, backhand, volley, overhead smash, drop shot, semi-volley, swinging volley, and most of all the serve. You need to have a good feel of the raquet in all your shots to get the depth, placement and power.<br>  <br>  keep in mind tennis is hard and something you need to be comitted to, not just to do for fun or to be on a team. <br>  <br>  I say the pros definitly outweigh the cons after playing tennis for 4 years.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	Nope, its a pretty simple concept, And you just need to know a few rules/things to play. If someone explained to you , you could probably learn it in like 5-10 minutes. However, mastering the sport, is very difficult.|`|d9hzMrzwaa	tennis is like every other sport its difficult at first than after you have been playing it for a while its easy. i have been playing it since i was 4.|`|ToZer2Adaa	I don't think tennis is really easy. I don't think any sport is really easy. Tennis is far from being really easy..I've played basketball and I play tennis. I like tennis alot better because it's an independent sport, but that's just my opinion. You need alot of mental strength to become a good tennis player. You also need physical conditioning, and you should get lessons. There are quite a few rules, but they are easy to follow (not like basketball.) The hardest thing to develop in tennis is the serve, it takes most people years to develop a good serve.<br>  Tennis is a really fun and rewarding game :)|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	well yes and no.. it depends on your hand and eye cordination your ablity to hit a ball and make stragey.. and run around the court...<br>  fitness helps. but its also mental just as much as physical..|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	everything is hard to lean at first|`|R8nxkVJSaa	Hmm there's not a ton of rules<br>  If you take it for a while it's pretty easy<br>  I took tennis when i was younger and it's a lot of fun.. nothing like basketball.. better in my opinion!<br>  Hope this helps!|`|KJ58Xi4Kaa	The rules are fairly simple and easy to learn but it is very difficult to become good.|`|GNq2rmrNaa	no not really theres not that many rules and you can pick it up very quickly :D|`|tHQvVgnhaa	not really. keeping score can be really hard at first but other than that its really easy|`|JpOH6mR7aa	for my friend it is

A cheap board will cost you about $150 and good bindings another 150-250...so you do the math.|`|mGTeNxpJaa	Answer is YES! 5150 is a sister company of RIDE snowboards.

sd65CtLYaa	Excellent Question - always good to identify your weaknesses and work on them...<br>  <br>  There's a few things you can do to develop quicker feet:<br>  <br>  1. Jump Rope (speed rope, obviously)<br>  2. Do line jumping drills <br>   - (quick jumps back and forth over the line or a jump rope)<br>   - with your feet together, parallel to the line, <br>   - jump back and forth laterally as fast as you can) <br>  3. Perform defensive conditioning drills like the defensive figure-8<br>  4. Do some dot drills<br>  5. Improve your core strength<br>    - your core is involved in every athletic movement, <br>    - the stronger it is, the more efficient your other muscles work.<br>  6. get some training aids like jumpsoles, lateral plyo boxes, etc.<br>  7. Foot-fire drills will also help<br>  <br>  Basically, a lot of lateral movement as fast as you can repeatedly is what's going to help you out the most.<br>  <br>  www.basketball-tips-and-training.com has more detailed descritptions of the information above; It would be too long of an answer to provide all the detail here|`|yt05KPhBaa	Do defensive slides and run alot.

eI0KeqR3aa	Well, I asked the same question on yahoo answers. I'm 13 years old and I really want to play air soft. But, i'm sorry to brake it to you, but you have to be 18 years old to play air soft. Trust me, I, too, can't wait to be 18 to play. <br>  <br>  To find some more info on it (pictures, videos, and links), go to my website: www.wix.com/gamereviews/grsr <br>  Once there scroll down and click Air Soft. You'll find all you need there.
OOeoFvB6aa	I agree with everything Sara said, and Willie.  Just wanted to add a few things.<br>  <br>  First, if you're teaching him how to ski, then you're going to paying for a lift ticket while accepting the role of babysitter.  Do you want to shell out $60-$100 to spend the day on the bunny slopes yourself?<br>  <br>  The beauty of a lesson is it will give YOU an hour or more of free skiing time so that you don't resent being on the bunny slope for the rest of the day.  <br>  <br>  We also have a rule at our resort, that we never, ever teach friends or people we love how to ski, that is a job for another instructor. Really, it's best for your relationship, even if it's just a friendship, if someone else does this.  Paying for the $25 group lesson might be a nice gift you can give your friend.<br>  <br>  That said, if you're still set on doing the teaching yourself, this is what we teach in a beginner lesson:<br>  <br>  1) Familiarity with the equipment, how to get in and out of the skis.  Specifically how to put a ski back on once it's come off.<br>  2) Gliding wedge<br>  3) Breaking wedge<br>  4) Turning to the right and left.  We teach a 90-degree turn on the hill with the magic carpet, and a 180-degree turn on the bunny slope.<br>  5) Riding the lift, lift safety<br>  6) Reading a trail map, where the bathrooms are, first aid/ski patrol, etc.<br>  7) Skier responsibility code, who has right of way, where it's safe to stop etc.<br>  <br>  Start to finish it takes about 90 minutes from walking out of the rental shop to the student taking their first run on their own.  Athleticism is not as important as coachability when we're talking about ability to learn.  It's easier and faster to be coached by a stranger.|`|OEqxVXYVaa	throw her / him to in after all thats how i learned how to swim and isnt that the same?|`|rUk58ywKaa	Don't overcomplicate this.  Just start with the basics and advance at whatever rate he learns at.|`|cOFWJWdQaa	If you must teach him yourself,<br>  Always give lot's of time to grasp the concept.  Don't move on to the next thing if he doesn't totally get the first.  Spend  A LOT of time on turning.  And of course stopping.<br>  When you teach him to stop and turn, teach him that it's the edges of the skis that make you stop.  Tell him to feel the edges on the snow.<br>  Make sure his weight is in the front of his boots.  Beginners usually lean back if they are hesitating or trying to slow down.  That's really important so that you don't lose your balance.  <br>  Don't let him use poles the first time.  <br>  Teach him how to put his skis sideways on the slope to get up if he falls.<br>  And don't get on the lift is he doesn't have really good control.<br>  Make sure his boots are pretty tight so he can feel more control of the skis.<br>  Make sure he is wearing the appropriate clothing for the weather or he will just get cold and want to go inside.<br>  <br>  And be patient most of all.<br>  Have fun!|`|e1zvb2ADaa	You probably already know this, but at all costs avoid the no turn snowplow. i would suggest making that the first ting he learns. Also, make sure you are sure he knows how to stop, otherwise he is just a recipe for disaster. Also, you might want to have his hands out for balance, that way he will be less likely to fall.|`|7XRI6s14aa	pizza and french frys<br>  <br>  pizza to slow down(turn your feet in to make a triangle or pizza)<br>  <br>  french frys to go down a slope(keep feet pointing straight like a french fry)|`|qyATAaeXaa	If you are that sure of your teaching skills, why are you asking us? <br>  <br>  15 years in ski school taking lessons? Was that age 1-15? If you haven't been in ski school in the last ten years you've missed some stuff, especially better ways to use shaped skis with never-ever 1st timers. <br>  <br>  While knowing how to ski is important, and most people could teach a novice the basics, try to remember not just what you were taught, but HOW it was taught. Soft skills are just as important as the hard skills when it comes to skiing. <br>  <br>  How old is the "student"? Is this your 27 year old BF or your 5 year old child? Teaching an adult is one thing, teaching a kid is another.|`|AA11441385	Do you remember how you were taught to do a snowplow turn?  I don't, but an instructor will know.

You can find decent used boards on eBay, and many people overpay for Burton boards just because of the name, but that doesn't mean they're not good.  Once in a while, if you look hard enough, you'll find one that's a steal.  <br>  <br>  If you're new, you don't really need a good board, even.  I would definitely buy a used one if you want to save money.  Get it on ebay.  Then when you've learned how to snowboard, you can probably re-sell it on ebay for close to the same price you paid for it, and buy yourself a better board new at that point.  You'll also have a much better idea of what you're looking for at that point than you do now.|`|mGTeNxpJaa	Go here <a href="http://store.atticskateshop.com/snowboardstuff.html" rel="nofollow">http://store.atticskateshop.com/snowboar...</a> email them and ask them the same question.

q6S0R70caa	Interesting question. I recently watched a short documentary on bats, and they discussed the exact method you did.

mwxKnUleaa	Because if they have a huge contract they don't have to pay anymore it frees up cap space so that they can get another player or in other cases sometimes they sign average players to contracts that don't pan out and the team is just glad that the player is gone|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	2010 that is my reason|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Free agency.  If your team isn't doing too well as it is, getting an expiring contract means you're freeing up money to spend on players that will make your team better.  2010 is supposed to be a big year for free agents, and a lot of teams want to free up money so they can spend it on big time free agents.|`|yt05KPhBaa	You can get a player who can help your team and you can resign or get rid of them in the offseason.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	because then they can accquire another player in the offseason,especially since there will be many free agents this offseason,|`|Rhk35LUcaa	because it pretty much gives you spending money in the off season.|`|GOMKQ8MXaa	with the nba's salary cap it is good to get money off the books so that a team can get free agents.|`|aupDanleaa	becuz 2010 is coming up

DpfJfK6Baa	No, in ancient cultures, religion and science went hand in hand...  each scientific discovery only enhanced the mystery of the Gods.<br>  <br>  Only recently has the mistrust developed between the two, perhaps, as you say, due to fear from the church, but also down to disdain from 'enlightened' men of science.|`|2Y2AFV7Kaa	Yes because religion is based on a belief system without proof, whereas science always strives to provide answers that can be tested and proved time after time.The early church greatly feared science because large amounts of land and money was given to the church to smooth the pathway to heaven. Science upset this rather lucrative applecart which is why early scientists were convicted as heretics(non-believers) and executed.|`|e09a597d17f68a940b1872c2db3579b8aa	<a href="http://www.4shared.com/file/88800690/88ec9231/wwwCHITBcomAidenfromGlasgowdomesticabuse.html?err=no-sess" rel="nofollow">http://www.4shared.com/file/88800690/88e...</a>   stan collymore hook ,line  and sinker|`|35ccc8ce58bda98ad049f1093b5a126aaa	Because the religious used to kill the scientific.|`|7XoMIlJeaa	Ask this question on science and culture|`|AA12299132	Because religion is afraid of science.  Science said the world was round - the Catholic church only admitted this in 1999!<br>  Religion started by putting fear into the uneducated e.g  the moon has disappeared - God must be angry?  No it's an eclipse!  Science proves there is no God and that is where the conflict lies.|`|yXay0Tdjaa	I guess i'm not sure, they don't fear enlightenment they just have conflicting beliefs. I suppose the conflict (more of a disagreement) didn't develop until science had come far along enough to prove these new theories (ex. evolution). I;m sure someone else has a better answer if they studied it lol.|`|A0G6Ye8Qaa	Yes there has always been conflict. Things that are proved (somewhat) by science sometimes are not believed to be true by religious people. E.g. The theory of evolution, the big bang.|`|bwjf8D31aa	no they just replaced the bulb!|`|bej55wxUaa	Look in:<br>  <br>  History<br>  Religion<br>  Philosophy<br>  Anthropology<br>  <br>  As opposed to the Scottish football section ?

cOPCNP7Laa	Hahaha the guy who said that is a weirdo and a loser. Don't pay attention to them. You could probably blame ALL Liverpool, Arsenal and ManU fans (and others of top Spanish and Italian teams) of being glory hunters, considering these clubs have been at the top one way or another for the least 30-40 years... (AC Milan, Inter, Juve, Real, Barca, etc).<br>  <br>  So I guess about 80% of all users in this section are glory hunters with that reasoning, which just goes to prove it's BS. Especially when they claim someone is a glory hunter bc they do not support their home team, more so when they are from another country. They don't get that it's their OWN club's marketing, merchandizing and publicity that puts them in the spotlight abroad, resulting in fan bases creating in countries other than where they play. An American who gets into football is hardly going to start supporting Wolverhampton when they are not even broadcasted or promoted outside their own area...|`|EIsnATLxaa	I'm not saying your a glory hunter but if you didn't support them before they became a billionaire club then you are...and that goes to all Chelsea fans|`|Maja0Gzdaa	So do I...! <br>  <br>  Finally, we have something in common! ! ! :P|`|uXXbegw5aa	Omg so do I :)<br>  Woohoo|`|HxET88bDaa	I know how you feel, i have supported Utd since birth because my dad supported them.

DOVbF4Piaa	The bottom of the derailleur will move when you change gears. It is spring loaded so it keeps the chain tight enough so it wont  jump the gears.  I don't think that is your problem though.  There should be 3 screws around where the shift cable attaches to the derailleur.  You have to look closely and they will be marked with a "B", "L", and a "H".  It's hard to see sometimes, use a magnifying glass. If you can't watch the video look at the picture below it.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_da-o.html#derailer" rel="nofollow">http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_da-o.html#...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://bicycletutor.com/adjust-rear-derailleur/" rel="nofollow">http://bicycletutor.com/adjust-rear-dera...</a>
mxA0tYppaa	he'll be remembered for exactly the same as all the other Pool managers.....<br>  <br>  so near but yet another manager who cant win the Premiership for Liverpool...|`|adef29031513d305e63fae0bd1584e09aa	For triggering a golden age for Liverpool F.C. You will see. The day he leaves Anfield, Liverpool F.C will go back to the nineties. You know, when Liverpool was that 4th or 5th team in England that nobody cared about.<br>  <br>  Finishing second after Manure is nothing to be ashamed of (should this happen). Rafa placed Liverpool among the big european guns, coached Liverpool to CL glory, and has slowly made of Liverpool a serious candidate to the Premier. I remember the kind of challenger Liverpool was to both the CL (when qualified) and the Premier before Rafa's arrival. How long took Ferguson to put Manure on the map of european football?? I remember the days when Generalissimo Ferguson could only sit and watch his team being regularly d€stroyed by Barsa, Madrid, Milan, Juve, etc... but nowadays is a different story both for Manchester and Generalissimo, isn't it?? Napoleon Wenger is still trying to make the ultimate break through after, uh, how many years?? Still a great job, Arsenal is a much stronger club now than it was before Napoleon landed.<br>  <br>  Whenever LFC wins, all credit to the players, when they lose, or draw!! blame it on Rafa. What kind of team you think you've got?? You've got Gerrard, Torres, Carrragher, and that's it boy. Do whatever possible with that squad and the money we are willing to spend signing in new players, Rafa; finishing 4th or 5th in the EPL and, if possible and lucky, try to make it to the quarters round in the CL. Oh well whatever, fire Rafa. We'll see how Liverpool is doing next year.|`|mn7cIHCxaa	for liverpool fans winning the champs league<br>  for us man.utd fans making liverpool into<br>  the worst challengers to united's title<br>  3 in a row|`|tfotPdeZaa	Nah.

"YOU WILL BE SACKED IN THE MORNING!"|`|O5KOwhovaa	Liverpool's problem has been with excessive draws, mainly due to the fact they don't have a deep enough squad to compete in the Premier League at least with Man Utd. One can hardly say Liverpool have "fallen apart" since they are still second in the league, still to play Man Utd whom they beat earlier in the season, and still have only lost one game out of 26 in the Prem.<br>  <br>  It had nothing to do with anything Rafa Benitez said regarding Manchester United or Alex Ferguson.<br>  <br>  The Keegan thing was also overstated. Newcastle were a team without experience of winning titles and their squad was also less talented than Man Utd's established championship winning team.|`|Scq7n4dkaa	All these stupido euro managers need o be sacked they make the english game look bad!!!!!|`|1611a17a4b0cd6610c45b73de16234bcaa	hahaha...yes<br>  <br>  but...but<br>  <br>  our lads have work very hard in January...a very pack JANUARY.....<br>  good job lads....<br>  kudos<br>  <br>  GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED|`|p6E7g6CWaa	rafa's gotto go home to spain.. <br>  he's gonna be sacked soon for his mistakes|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Haha I said it was the turning point of the season!! :)|`|uXXbegw5aa	Ahhh Rafa, He needs help :P|`|cjNtjOZtaa	I had a feeling after that rant that they would fall apart  , Rafa humiliated himself as well as losing the title|`|QuGTZJIVaa	And after he defended us over our transfer policy, i feel almost bad.....<br>  <br>  <br>  ......okay i'm good again! WOOHOO 1 POINT AT ANFIELD, with OUR squad!|`|RSJbqioUaa	And Chelsea fans!<br>  I would like to say thankyou to Mr. Benitez :P|`|XU1KaWXwaa	stupid rant. but it seem that big of a turning point for me
08sqi8cYaa	Very good idea, i like it!|`|QTMCQ55Laa	i like tht idea n i actually thought of it before...but then think about it...lets say the team of the injured player faked the injury...for example...kaka fouls a no name player...n the no name player fakes the injury for 3 months...so then kaka would have to be banned for 3 months too...<br>  <br>  unless u can get around it...it seems highly impossible|`|9d792c6e2da6e5b53a036baec7115b43aa	What happens if a player makes a tackle that ends another player's career completely? Would you ban the tackler for life? I do not believe that most players would go out to injure another player (Roy Keane excluded) intentionally.|`|OYYYNCyCaa	how can you prove it was deliberate for a start<br>  <br>  Nolan it was a bad tackle thats for but deliberate i cant say yes or no|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Yes I like your idea.|`|6JEgauSdaa	i think its a beautiful game :D<br>  yea i no was shocking, but players get caught up in the moment, you no what its like sureley when your chasing someone, wind in your face, crowd shouting at you.

Either way what comes around goes around, so i say let it be part of our enjoyment for the game =]|`|mtlYMbs8aa	Well if Anichebe broke his leg and was only out for 6 weeks it'd be a miracle.

0c0vbhLfaa	I am not japanese myself. but honestly, i have to say the best fighters come from Japan.<br>  <br>  you can just see the sheer determination and their fighting spirit. they are willing to die in a fight, just to win pride and honor. for example. in the first kyokushin karate championships, a japanese karateka said he would kill himself if japan lost...obviously japan won that year, but that just shows how seriously the take the martial arts. <br>  <br>  the japanese fighters in mma today for example, may not be the best in the world per se...but to me the definition of a fighter is portrayed by the japanese perfectly. <br>  <br>  and lastly, you have to remember that alot of the world's martial arts have all come from japan- jujitsu, judo, aikido, karate. that's saying something about their fighting spirit.|`|HqQmZfA6aa	Every dog has its day.<br>  Roman soldiers were good in their day. So were the Spartans. <br>  The Vikings were good at sea.<br>  The Monguls knew their stuff. The Japanese samurai were bad mofos with a sword and a bow.<br>  The Maoris were kings of their world.<br>  The Viets were impossible to beat at guerrilla warfare in the seventies.<br>  The Brazilians were good at BJJ once. Now the US mixed fighters with a wrestling background are winning.<br>  The Japanese dominate Olympic judo.<br>  In Africa, the Zulu warriors were masters of their domain.<br>  The Brits won the Battle of Britain against all odds with the trusty Spitfire. They also gave birth to the skinheads.<br>  The Japanese had their day at Pearl Harbour but got smashed at Midway and New Guinea, not to mention Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br>  Mexicans have some great boxers, as do the Cubans.<br>  Iranian wrestlers are always hard to beat. <br>  The American Indians are renowned for their courage.<br>  A good sniper with the right weapon is deadly, regardless of his nationality.<br>  Every country excels according to to the needs of the time and place. <br>  You gotta ask the right question to get the right answer.|`|xlvnryb3aa	china and thialand, has best fighters as they have centuries of learning these skills.  but that all fades compared to a loaded 45.|`|6QyQQnWmaa	USA.

America has the biggest guns.|`|lCPQNlWoaa	Well each country has their own art. Brazil has BJJ. Thailand has Muay Thai and other countries have their arts such as karate and TKD. In my opinion I'd say the USA because they incorporate every style and blend different arts together to make different spin offs of other countries' fighting styles. Certain countries are great at their one art but the USA isnt great at anything(on average) but it is good at everything.|`|sBdOzbx5aa	America or Russia,  pound for pound Thailand.|`|sLVGdCOTaa	I'll go with Brazil, USA, and Russia in that order.|`|5KjvNg2oaa	as of right now brazil

Don't get me wrong he's a good player but the last kind of player Arsenal need. Imagine a midfield of tiny players (Fabregas, Nasri, Arshavin, Silva) - all flair and no grit. Players like Vidic, Skrtel, Terry, Mascherano etc will murder them and away from home they'll continue to be bullied by the likes of Stoke, Bolton, Everton etc.|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	hahaha Silva would go to a big team. arsenal is a relatively big team but there are giants amongst them like Man U, liverpool & Chelsea.<br>  He would want to enhance his career so he would go to at least a top 4 team anyway.<br>  Wenger wouldn't spend more than15m and he's worth more than that anyway|`|583630813856412488308836bad3d46caa	Of course I would want him, anything that give us goals!|`|buPeIIreaa	yesss. i will love it if we get him. but i truly dont believe that wenger will bid more than 16mil for him. thoough i think he's worth 20mil if not more|`|MUERDKyzaa	Daily mail dude, it's the daily mail|`|oPYw0QYqaa	Surly a fan of any club would want him...

IWM1khX7aa	The best game in Euro 08 was Turkey vs Czech Republic.  Turkey came back from 2 goals down, and they scored 3 goals in the last 15 minutes of the game. It was so funny how Petr Cech dropped that ball.  That changed the whole momentum of the game.  Nihat had a great performance.  If Turkey didn't win against Czech Republic, then they wouldn't have played against Croatia and Germany, and both of those games were good too.|`|ie5AKYToaa	I agree, I loved Turkey when they were playing in Euro 08. Because of the way Germany played crappy against them and they way they beat them, I now hate Germany's team with a passion!!!|`|mvJXPDLgaa	That game didnt go to PKS, Turkey won it 3-2 in normal time.<br>  but i agree it was the best game
XsXWnV3qaa	okay,i know for a fact that more people would rather see taker vs hbk over taker vs kozlov,i mean do you realize how short that match would be?and the wwe has gotten letters from fans(me for example)saying they want to see taker vs hbk.ever since royal rumble 07 there has been something going on with those two,you can see it in their eyes when they face eachother.and i think it is time for the wwe to use that to their advantage...i mean face it,we could easily see kozlov vs taker as a main event for smack down,but not a main event for the grandaddy of them all<br>  espeacilly at the 25th anniversary|`|WQGvE60waa	Herat Break:<br>  <br>  I agree with you.

What a dumb sh!t the WWE writers are|`|hoZxIQkkaa	It will be HBK Taker. Although, if for some reason Koslov got the match and won. WWE's fans would be so pissed, but Koslov (if he won) would get a major push. He can't even speak English so how can they expect him to be a champ? A champ needs to be charismatic.

l4zWHv4Daa	Dale Jr. because  Rick Hendrick is giving Jimmie the best equipment. If he would give Dale the good equipment then Dale could win too. Plus Dale Jr has Tony Eury Jr as a crew chief which is a thorn in the side. Jr would have won last week if Brian Vickers didn't pull his crap at Daytona.<br>  <br>  I wish Dale Jr would quit trying to take care of his family and just concentrate on winning. He tried to help his greedy old step mother and what happened? She gave him junk engines. He tried to bring his cousin with him to Hendrick's and what happened? Tony Eury Jr makes mistake after mistake in 2008.<br>  <br>  Under the right circumstances Dale would out drive Jimmy with one hand behind his back.|`|21cf85dc961b3d03a8c5bb2f231c50aaaa	its not even close JJ is WAY better.

AA11694178	Yes, I have done it many times.  Why, just the other day I had this zombie enter my house and I had nothing at hand except a .22 pistol.  I took careful aim, fired ten fast closely spaced rounds which made a hole in his forehead about the size of my fist.  I stuck my fist into his skull and ripped out his brains thus ending his attack.  There are more lurking out there......I just know there are..........I can smell them now.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	It's supposedly a favorite for hit-men.<br>  I've actually seen BB's inside a skull, and I'm not even talking about a .177 pellet but just the normal kid's BB gun. Under the right (or wrong!) circumstances, it doesn't take much, and it's best not to take the 22 LR too lightly. It's more powerful than, say, the 25 ACP.|`|Hxttt7G0aa	Absolutely. It's one of the most used gangland rounds for hits. It penetrates and bounces around, very effective, but you need to have flush contact because an angle is very likely to make it bounce off.<br>  <br>  With a Zombie though I would rather use a fully jacketed .357 so you could go through 2 or 3 in one shot ; ).|`|fUDlbOP0aa	yes<br>  Google ".22LR lethality". <br>  the first result, a sniper's hide forum post will answer your question. <br>  <br>  7" penetration at up to 300 yards is more than enough to penetrate and destroy a zombie's brain. Closer ranges -> more penetration.|`|51jR2Lmlaa	From a relative short distance (under 100yds) it would penetrate a human skull once, meaning the bullet would not go though the persons head but it would be lodged inside.|`|4SF4KGu4aa	If hit straight on it will penetrate and then bounce around inside the head making a mess of things. This used to be the caliber of choice for  suppressed guns and for "hit-men" . They would usually shoot more than once but if suppressed, it doesn't make much noise.<br>  <br>  I don't know the current data but at one time there were more people killed with that caliber than any other.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	It didn't penetrate James Brady's skull<br>  <br>  There is a good chance that the bullet will just follow the contour of the skull and never actually penetrate<br>  <br>  There was a girl in Florida a few years ago that was shot with a 22 at contact range<br>  She was shot in the head five times three bounced off her skull<br>  <br>  She lived and completely recovered|`|fcc5487b88b4303d263e3ddb1df9a865aa	yes it can-any bullet can-a .22 is small but they can fly fast and far-if it was a cheap .22 short rifle round maybe not,i bought a box of them one time and it wouldnt even pierce an old burn barrel(just dented it like a big bb)but yes a little .22lr is alot better than most folks believe it to be|`|1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	Zombie skulls are weakened due to the chemical reaction that occurs during the zombie morphing process.  Be careful about over penetration when using the .22 on zombies.|`|YIbELNRBaa	Yea i'd say so. .22's are tricky because if they go inside someone they can bounce around off the bones and cause major damage. Zombies beware. Get a shot gun if its Zombies.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* Yes * it is deadly.*|`|nBUDjyhgaa	Plain & simple......Yes|`|oZpqEdI7aa	It would penetrate but not that deep|`|CutogVC1aa	yes it could, from a close range though, from a distance is possible if it was to enter from the eyes or nose you may also be able to disable it from a mouth shot if it hit it's spine. A .22 makes for a great anti zombie rifle or pistol, but only for close distance. Would not be wise to use it as offense caliber to hunt or attack zombies, for that I would recommended the .223, 7.62x39 or 30-06 or 308 anything thats a powerful hunting round that you can still buy fairly cheap for that. I'm a zombie nerd too. =)|`|OrvTG44laa	It depends on the range.  I'm no expert with velocities, but I do know that a 22 long rifle might not always kill a fox.  So I'd have to take a guess and say no.  It might do some damage to the skull, but I doubt it could go through.  <br>  But don't underestimate the 22.  While it may be one of the smallest cartridges, it is the deadliest cartridge available.  That is because of how it ricochets.  The 22 cartridge was designed to ricochet.  When John F. Kennedy was shot, the bullet went in somewhere near his head- I think the head, neck or chest- and came out of his foot.  So in an attack of zombies, the 22 should do the job.|`|SeLytr1Uaa	yeah it definitely will out to 75 yards at least i shot a deer right in the head with one at at least 75 yards dropped like a rock, but anyways it went through and kept on traveling. I dont know what these people are talking about it wont kill somebody it is a real gun and should be treated like one. Oh and by the way follow the golden rule, treat every gun as if it where loaded if your going to be handling one.|`|rARWalPmaa	The best way to kill a "Zombie" with a .22, is to shoot them in the eye, that way it penetrates the brain. <br>  PS. It is also the way the Mob in NY used to perform Silent hits.|`|UrNVuFx6aa	Yes, it can. There have been a number of people killed by this diminutive round, either intentionally or accidentally. Either way, they're just as dead.<br>  Always handle with care and be safe.|`|69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	Through-n-through, but what's with all these 'can .22s kill, etc.' questions???<br>  <br>  H|`|VZRJZQxKaa	I would imagine so, but I don't think you can kill a zombie because they are already dead.

vzH7f7V5aa	The Nets. They will find A hot Streak soon until the Cavs come and ruin it.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Why would the Jazz be a surprise team? They have been neck and neck in the standings w/ the Blazers and the Nuggets. When they have been unhealthy all this year losing valuable players in D.Will, C.Booz, AK47, and Harp for a considerable amount of time. Yet, they are a half a game beneath the Blazers for 4th seed and 4 games in a half from the Nuggets and the division lead for home court advantage and the 3rd seed.<br>  <br>  This is no surprise to me they are deep and when healthy and possibly before then they will climb up the standings easily. They are deep and if they do damage in the playoffs also not a surprise. In the last 2 years they made it to the WCF losing to the Spurs in 7 games. Meaning, they were only 1 game away from the NBA Finals and last year they lost in 6 to the Lakers. NBA Finals representative for the WC - Jazz were the only team to put up a fight against Lakers in the West last year. So, because they held their own for the past 2 years there really is no surprise if they do damage in the playoffs.|`|6siaPhyKaa	Im gonna have 2 say Atlanta Hawks mike Bibby always steps it up and Joe Johnson is a defensive nightmare|`|ZtoXM6jbaa	i'm gonna go with the sixers for maybe a first round upset.. for one last yr they took the pistons to six games in the first round

Jimmie wasn't 19/20 when he started winning Cup races, Kyle was. The younger the driver, the more hype surrounds them. (esp. when they're good)|`|5faa7df1dbf6be8d22c72f7cca966e7baa	I can think of maybe one good reason he is being given more credit now than Jimmie Johnson,  Jimmie has never won 2 major races in one day.  Kyle did that yesterday by winning the Craftsman Truck Series yesterday afternoon and then the Nationwide Race last night, setting a new NASCAR record.  Here are a couple of more reasons.  He makes things happen.  He is controversial.  He takes chances on the race track.  Love or hate him, Kyle is just the shot in the arm NASCAR needed this year.  If he can win today, he will set a new record in NASCAR history! <br>  GO KYLE!|`|yt4PN1R4aa	i don't know. everyone thinks Busch is this amazing super driver, which he is, but the truth is that he's never won a championship in any series, whereas Johnson has won 3 in a row in Cup.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	Jimmie Johnson is the top guy on the totem pole (so to speak)<br>  It's true.

Yes he had a bad chase last year but he won 8 races out of the first 26. I am biased because I really don't care about either Jimmie or Kyle. I think they along with Jr. and Gordon are over inflated drivers. I think they are all capable of winning races but you must remember that Jimmie had a crappy Daytona. If your driver isnt doing well they are not going to talk about him.|`|l4zWHv4Daa	Because Kyle is under NASCAR's wing. Media hype. Trying to creat a WWF super hero. The media coverage like FOX are scared they will lose NASCAR coverage so they because NASCAR has spread out the coverage through other stations so they will not speak the truth any more. They say what NASCAR wants the public to think.|`|VxN4tnJtaa	looks to me like he's dong pretty well for himself...look how many laps he led at Daytona before being took out in wreckage... and UM, yesterday he led a massive amount of laps, and he WON TWO RACES!!!!  Truck race and Nationwide race, on the same day.  I think this shows why he's being given credit.|`|Xava8Jabaa	Kyle Busch ISN'T doing what he was doing at Hendrick.<br>  He is far out doing his performance with that team.<br>  Mr. Hendrick made a BIG mistake dumping Kyle for Dale Jr.|`|a8EndhDmaa	Jimmie did not just win the trucks race and nation wide race in the same day

AA12325046	I have always felt that Palomino was an underrated fighter.  He did lose a close split decision to Wilfred Benitez and a decision to Roberto Duran.  He was an above average puncher with solid boxing skills and was never knocked out.  Starling was a marvelosus defensive fighter that could stand right there in front of you and still make you miss him and would throw good counter punches.

Its gonna be tough though in high school most soccer players have played for a while but have confidence. Im 15 and a sophomore and ive played organized soccer since i was 6, and ive played with a soccer ball ever since i was 4. Don't be intimidated if you see some people who are really skilled. Try to stand out to the coach in a good way. For example, have a good attitude and respect him as well as all of the other players. Soccer tryouts usually consist of a lot of running and technical evaluation. Then it usually progresses into small sided games. You kind of made this really last minute, but if you have enough time, try to play keepy ups. This is also known as juggling, use any part of your body but your arms to keep the ball from hitting the ground. Watch videos on youtube and do research on the rules. If you're really serious about this start playing soccer now and try to get better. If you don't make it keep playing and you'll make it next year. Do your best and don't worry about the other players.<br>  Good Luck, I'll be routing for you.|`|un1ddMEHaa	talk top the coach and tell him youve never played team soccer before. if you have some skill and/or potential, he may teach you after or before practice. i recomend being the manager, and watching them play fro a while, and then learn the rules to heart.<br>  btw, try reading a soccer for dummies or wikipedia rules on soccer. if you have an Xbox, PS3 or a computer, buy a game called FIFA 09. if you play itlong enough you will learn to play soccer. thats how i learn.|`|HCVFXuclaa	Every school is different in mine we did the following<br>  <br>  5 laps around the Field<br>  climbed up and down the hill<br>  pacing<br>  passing<br>  shooting<br>  a game<br>  jumping<br>  sit-ups<br>  push-ups<br>  and we ended with a lap<br>  <br>  <br>  I suggest you bring the following<br>  pain relief<br>  lots and lots of water<br>  ice pack<br>  towel<br>  and don't come too tried come relaxed<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck and have a great time=]]]
CmOvLKnAaa	I do. These two are the faces of the NHL and any rivalry between them can only increase interest in the sport. <br>  <br>  Ovechkin is the more complete player and is definitely stronger and more physical than Crosby. <br>  <br>  I hope the Caps and Pens meet in the playoffs and this rivalry intensifies. It's great for hockey!|`|42ef902b67cef343060a46d1d7776268aa	Crosby is a total $hit piece of trash. The NHL should be ashamed of itself every time someone goes on TV and says Crosby is the next Wayne Gretzky.|`|hv8ytdaoaa	I do because these guys are both daring.|`|r5V3ZNGfaa	If YOU saw it, Ovechkin didn't turn around and rag-doll Crosby. Crosby was either ducking towards Ovechkin from under his hand or he got a little shove from the Caps' bench.<br>  <br>  Here you go: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM98JHZac6s" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM98JHZac...</a><br>  <br>  As for Crosby starting his "whining"? If he were mic'd up I'm sure it would sound less like whining and more like a bunch of words they could never put on TV. Plus, as Pierre McGuire pointed out, (yes, I know he's a tool, but still) the Caps were excessively yapping at Crosby a good part of the game. What's the difference between Crosby's jawing and their jawing?<br>  <br>  I would take Ovechkin head-to-head in hitting if you mean checking. It's not just that he's got good upper body strength (where Crosby has better lower body strength) but he's just good at making really nice big hits. However... as far as dropping the gloves goes, I scoff at how people consider Ovechkin to be the Russian Georges Laraque or something. What are they basing this on--- all of Ovechkin's fights? What fights?<br>  <br>  I've seen Crosby fight, and I fully believe he's got some toughness. From what I've seen, I'd say he's not Iginla... but he's also not bongo-playing Semin. You can lump him in with Semin for the Valabik incident, but Crosby's always used his fists and never an open-palm slap.<br>  <br>  I think Capitals coach Bruce Boudreau got it pretty much right concerning Crosby when after the game he said, “I think he got frustrated because he wasn’t getting the freedom he’s had in this building before. It adds spice. It’s entertainment. It gets your blood boiling a bit."<br>  <br>  The Pens are down 3-0 in this season's regular season with the Caps. Ovechkin slamming bodies around only further frustrated and already frustrated Crosby, who hates to lose and his team was down in the game. I'd prefer a passionate captain who cares over one who doesn't. Also, as a hockey fan, I love the emotional games. Who doesn't?|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	Of course the rivalry is sweet. Who doesn't like some bad blood between players? It makes the game even more interesting.|`|WnQ3fhVhaa	I like that kind of rivalry.

But seriously , Those two being rivals and in turn pushing each other to out do each other can only be a good thing for hockey.  I would also take Ovie in a hitting match up .|`|DvBPLP4saa	NOT ME. <br>  <br>  It's hard enough for me admitting I'm a Penguin fan and a Capital fan as it is. <br>  <br>  I was so relieved whenever Kovalchuk turned into the love guru and solved the Ovechkin-Malkin feud.<br>  <br>  Anyone knows Kovy's number? Maybe I can call him up and he'll resolve Crosby and AO's bickering. They bicker like an old married couple....God.<br>  ...I'm kidding. :P <br>  <br>  I just ignore the whoooooole thing. The 4 games a year when the Caps and Pens play are the worst 4 days of my life. I recieve a greater beating from people than Crosby or AO recieve from each other.|`|HJuOSvmdaa	I like it, sure they are both the faces of hockey.  Doesn't it make hockey even more interesting if there's a huge rivalry between two very skilled players who are more popular than most other players?  It's good for hockey to have rivalries...professional football isn't as exciting as college football because the rivalries are just not as epic and intense.  IMO|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	!<br>  <br>   <br>   Strange.....this Q won't accept my answer??<br>  <br>   Well, the gist of it was that i totally agree, it's great for the game. Head to head I'll take Crosby. Ovechkin has not done well in altercations. Don't you remember the smacking that Crosby put on Ference? (who is pretty tough)|`|O5Q4GP59aa	^^^This dude knows what he's talking about.|`|FEIXGtQyaa	I think it's weird that Crosby was smack talking more in this game then any other game this season, and it was to someone who is a lot bigger than him haha.<br>  <br>  “What I can say about him?” Ovechkin said. “He is a good player, but he talks too much.”<br>  <br>  <br>  “Like it or lump it, that’s what he does,” Crosby said. “Some people like it, some people don’t. Personally, I don’t like it.”<br>  (talking about ovie's showmanship)|`|jBXutMblaa	I love it.  Rivalries are good in any sports.  Ovie should go at Crosby like he went at Malkin that one game, except actually hit him. (:  Crosby just talk shi.t the whole game.  When he pulled that shi.t at the Caps bench, Ovie just waved his stupid asss off and the bench joined in.  I think after Brooksy scored, he was saying some crap about cheap shots from behind.  He's just a big pus who can't match Ovechkin's skills.<br>  Besides, we have better fans. ROCK THE RED!|`|oJsrGmmPaa	I wish I saw that instead of doing my errands....like grocery shopping. Yes, I would take Ovechkin over Crosby in any hockey-related aspect, any day of the week, and that includes physicality. Just from looking at them and their play, Ovechkin is obviously stronger than Crosby.|`|CPzICVa2aa	if anything...i think this fueled sidney crosby's game. I'd watch out for these last 20 or so games that the pens have becuase i think this incident will up sid's game to another notch. did you see the look sid gave ovechkin at the end of the game when ovy flapped his arms(like a chicken) towards him? eyes of determination.|`|rMOQ9xe9aa	i hope ovechkin does try to go for crosby. then cooke or gill or godard will go and beat him down<br>  crosby's a baby, but i root for pens. plus don't like ovechkin. don't he and malkin have a rivalry already?|`|Hki3AoL5aa	love it, here's what ovie had to say in Russian after the game about crosby<br>  "What, I can't play hard against him? What is he going to do, cry?"<br>  haha|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	I do because These Guys are saving Hockey Everyday.|`|2VYjOqnpaa	Loved it. Makes for a storyline going into the playoffs.

01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	Good infield, outfield is pretty decent you should trade matsui and crawford for someone like sizemore. also watch for pronk (hafner). he may struggle coming out the gate. the pitching is a pretty sound.|`|AA11073512	Your team might struggle a little with batting average, you might want to keep an eye on that. You could also try and upgrade Zimmerman or Cabrera, I'm not very big on either of them. Maybe package one of them with Bret Myers in a trade, who is inconsistent. Overall the team looks pretty good though.|`|faf42318f3fc2bbe429706ae27cc12a9aa	Overall, your team has some major question marks. If some of those players, play at 2007 levels, you will have a great team. If they are not recovered from injury, then you have some huge holes. <br>  <br>  1. V. Martinez - you might want to get some extra catching for your roster. <br>  <br>  2. Matsui - he will be limited. Unless there is a trade, the Yankees have Matsui, Posada,  and/or Swisher-Nady for the DH role. Dont expect a lot of at bats from Matsui. <br>  <br>  3. Hafner needs to have a good start or Cleveland will look towards Martinez as the DH and Garko at 1b. <br>  <br>  4. Zimmerman has a bad year last year. This year he will have Adam Dunn protecting him in the lineup. I think his stats will be better. <br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  remember - fantasy players are like stocks. Trade and move them around. Never just look at a player because of their name. Look at what they can do to get you a win.|`|rvyvF3KAaa	Your team looks pretty good. You have a good combination of power and speed. I would probably trade for a better outfielder. Matsui probably won't do very well this season and Choo isn't a very good player to have on the bench.|`|eFQXl7uyaa	In a 10 team league you can improve the offense - Chopsui is old and won't play full time, they have too many OF and they want to give playing time to Melky. You may be able to find some little known upsides in a 10 team, check for Juan Rivera on the Angels. He gets a full time gig this year with the release of GA - his last simi full time he pounded the ball. If they get him 140 games at OF he could easily hit .290 with 30+ HR's, 8 SB and 100rbi. <br>  O-Cab still doesn't have a team and when he does he will have to go to a team that won't put him in a good hitting position - his last good offensive year (fantasy wise) was in Anaheim where they turned him loose and let him steal bases. You can feel free to speculate at his position without a loss of production, Edgar Gonzalez is available in almost every league - I wouldn't mortgage the house and go out and get him yet (or even drop O-Cab) for him but he is one to watch, a lot of strength and may develop into a .280 hitter with a little power. But you can get the same production out of the wire with more upside than OCab.<br>  You have 2 starting pitchers that you can count on, Webb and Beckett, the rest are a guess and would make me nervous. Why you have Scherzer in a 10 league is beyond me.. You must be a D-Backs fan because they are the only ones who think he is the second coming of christ - but only Jesus walked more people through the desert than Max. He has not demonstrated control yet so I wouldn't jump on that train or bet my year yet until I see 3 straight quality starts. If you want to take a flyer on a young pitcher you may still be able to get Clayton Kershaw in LA - he is a good young pitcher in a great position and plays in a stadium that took 2 points off Derek Lowes ERA last year. Play him at home, bench him on the road.<br>  <br>  Other than that, you have a team to start with - now it's about adjusting after the season starts. I wouldn't go out and make drastic changes until people start playing.
YIbELNRBaa	Possible yes. It may be hard. I feel its all in your head. I race the 1 mile and 2 mile sometimes for high school track. I use to run a 5:04 mile then once i hit the 4:50's im able to run it constant and i think its because i know i can do it now. It has a lot to do with your head telling your body to keep going and push yourself.|`|J6xmZqj1aa	No.  Unless your previous time was super easy for you, but you can drop 3 minutes in anything in ten days if you ran hard both days.|`|b0cde47d880d7a3c3c2c43b06f9b6458aa	make sure to stretch good...I did the same thing for the mile run....I dropped my time by about a minute(which was good enough to make the team) but since I didn't stretch good and I wore wrong shoes the intense training caused me to get shin splints and other problems....so all that work down the drain|`|CO9Taq3Qaa	of course it is possible just eat VERY well and work SUPER hard and you should be able to do it. good luck!!!!!
0Dm3WEMcaa	now the McMahon's have a full time wrestler to confront Orton i don't think anyone else is due a punt. Linda is rarely involved on screen as it is and i can't think of a plausible reason why she would be any where near Orton for her to get an RKO or punt.|`|JiCfYfLraa	yea i hope its a punt to linda to make things more exciting. the feud will last another 6 weeks i think. these kind of feuds doesnt last long.<br>  <br>  the feud with triple h about his wife stephanie will build up real good i know that.|`|9Us6XYg8aa	he will punt and RKO EVERY Mcmahon.<br>  Even HHH.<br>  The Age Of Orton will live for about 10 years.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	he can go as far as he wants he is the future off the wwe|`|T13xM9iJaa	No he won't get that far and it all because of one person her son-n-law Triple H|`|fmUGHvgHaa	all the way up to wrestlemania|`|PsGNDuJ8aa	Im think its possible for Linda to be added into this feud but its not neccesary.<br>  All they really need to do now is build up the physical interaction between him and hhh now he has been introduced into the feud.<br>  The final Raw before wrestlemania will either have Orton punt HHH or Triple H battering Orton.<br>  I predict Orton succesfully challenging HHH for the WWE title at Wrestlemania 25 with interference from the McMahons(maybe vince returns at wrestlemania instead of earlier) and probably Orton brings the rest of Legacy for backup.<br>  Maybe 1 rematch at backlash (hopefully the long awaited hell in a cell match).|`|VkFDAQ46aa	If she appears on the show then yes it is possible linda could get punted. or atleast recieve an RKO. Honestly i dont know how far it will go. the feud with the mcmahons is unpredictible. i do however have a feeling that down the road orton will turn face and the mcmahons back to the heels. and it will be a rivalry simiilar to the austin mcmahon rivalry.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Keep Linda out hopefully. The way she sold the stunner was horrible, she jumped out a long time before the connection and made a visible fake. If she gets a punt, she might sell it worse than Shane did....<br>  <br>  I think that he will try to get a punt on Stephanie soon but Triple H will interrupt and there will be a shift in storyline...there are no more McMahon targets remaining.|`|GExKoh1Gaa	by my standards orton has done nothing.<br>  the "punt" is wayyyyy wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy overated.lets get real here any fan with a brain who has watched wrestling over the years have seen people get tombstones,pile drivers...all the hits and bangs you can imagine and still come back the next day.<br>  <br>  linda is an old woman..she wont get involved.<br>  <br>  i think randy and the legacy should beat down triple h when he returns .maybe RKO him through the annouce table..then triple h should get his back on randy by giving him a sledge hammer shot..|`|4j92pzJxaa	He has done enough to get Triple H's attention. Linda most likely wont be around. But i know that its going to be Orton vs Triple H @ Wrestlemania.|`|bPJk3yrXaa	how far will he go with linda?<br>  idk i can see him and linda picking up a triple and but orton tries to slide into home and gets tagged out.. if you know what i  mean|`|YyEOi1Tpaa	Up to Wrestlemania because I see that HHH will be the champion Randy Orton challenges|`|bE5fG9vDaa	no further, becasue hhh will destroy him, before he touches another mcmahon|`|743d4bhsaa	He will punt as many McMahons as it takes to get the title back.<br>  On a side note he should punt Cole too.

E563RzW2aa	Not bad.  I really don't understand why everything was complaining about how bad a card it was.  It really wasn't.  While I admit the main event lacked the lustre of a PPV event, the rest of the main card was actually pretty good.  <br>  <br>  I think the Kos stoppage was too early though.  I do  admit he looked out until his head bounced back up.  He was ready to defend.  <br>  <br>  And Maia was REALLY impressive.  That BJJ is godly.<br>  <br>  The finish of Gouveia was really intense.  Real nice combo by Marquardt.  The spinning backfist reminded me of a martial arts movie.|`|sLVGdCOTaa	A pretty good card overall, Not of the magnitude of 94 but certainly better than 93 I think, Maia, Dos Santos, and Hardy all looked very good, and the finale was entertaining, Hopefully Sanchez will take on Florian after he beats Penn (I hope).|`|j3OwcG6Maa	Indeed it was a great night of fights.|`|5KjvNg2oaa	way to many early stoppages|`|AA11517536	Yeah, Maia's bjj had me in awe of his skills.|`|O9NHDTj3aa	i hate to dissagree but i do i think there was nothing but missmatches the whole card,any1 that won apart from sanshez won by a country mile bring on 96 rampage jardine should be a good fight.

Use caution.|`|bGlZ8I2iaa	The 'Marine' knives are 7" Bowie blades...you don't need that much length/weight...Any of the military contractors...Ontario, Camillius, General, Imperial...in the 5" Bowie is a good choice...check out their websites.<br>  <br>  Personaly, I carry a 5" Russell butcher knife...it cost about $3.50....|`|WX1b747Iaa	Let me give you a link to a source for inexpensive knives that I would consider more reliable, Bud K. <br>  <br>  Edit: That's what a good cheap knife is for, to stick into some jerk who calls you a loser. ; )<br>  <br>  <a href="http://budk.com/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://budk.com/default.asp</a>|`|sjAut2FKaa	Might I suggest something a little off beat in the way of an answer here by suggesting that you pick up a magazine called BLADE or KNIVES and read up on some of their articles on making home made knives from scrap metal (truck/car springs, old files, etc..).<br>    It's not that difficult and any young fellow interested in the outdoors would benefit greatly from this knowledge. It's also a good way to make a few bucks on the side from discarded scrap that you can pick up for free.<br>  <br>  P.S.; Other than reading a few magazines I just stuck to it and by the 3rd blade I was getting pretty good at it.I now turn out axes along with fillet knives,skinning & survival blades. Good way to pass the cold wet days too next to a wood stove or homemade forge.|`|OrvTG44laa	First one is bad for hunting.  It's too big.  Hunting knives should be small.  Larger knives are harder to cut the animal with.  Second one also looks a little big.  You need a small blade to cut the animal open.|`|TvARYVRJaa	get a k bar with steel fore end sheath ok  carry other stuff in a weather proof bag ok|`|CutogVC1aa	I can't say right away. You need to find out if they're full tang blade first, if the blade goes into the handle and is one solid piece of metal. If you have to choose one of them take number two the MARINE COMBAT KNIFE Black USMC survival trench fighting knife. Looks better, and that hollowed part on the blade means it should be stronger, if it's done correctly. Also the type of steel maters too. High Carbon steel is favored more than high Stainless Steel, High Carbon holds a edge better. Hope this helped.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh by the way Jedidiah smith, shut up|`|PcOEPKfIaa	both knives look the same, knife will need to be sharp, sturdy and quality . it looks like they would be good survival knives.

oPYw0QYqaa	hee hee nice flip switch.. i almost bought the first bit!|`|66dfFiqJaa	Hey!<br>  Rafa Benitez, is not the greatest manger in the transfer market. For example Robbie Keane, who he lost a great amount of money on. He just took a dislike of Robbie Keane who is a decent player. He gave him a chance against Arsenal in a big match and Keane delivered scoring a great goal. He seems to like the nobody players who he has signed who aren't good at all, eg. Aurelio, Arbeloa, Dossena, N'gog. If Gerrard and Torres get injured Liverpool (I have to say) are goners.|`|O5KOwhovaa	The problem is mentality. Liverpool have no instinct to go for a win and tend to settle for draws. Of course, the fact we only have one quality striker is a sign of that attitude.<br>  <br>  Even I as a Liverpool fan don't get the logic of replacing Riise for example with the utterly crap Dossena.|`|mn7cIHCxaa	they need to sack rafa|`|XU1KaWXwaa	you need to spend money to make the squad better just look where he has bought us in the last five years.|`|Rds4eGIyaa	Losing 16 million pounds a year ain't all that bad. You're always going to lose money when you're trying to build a squad. If you compare him with, say, Ferguson. Now Man Utd spend a lot of money on players but usually only one or two each window on top quality players. Ferguson has done a good job building his squad over a long period of time but Rafa doesn't have this luxury as in this day and age people demand instant success.  Being loyal to your manager as Man United have done reaps rewards with stability. <br>  <br>  Rafa has had to buy in bulk because of the almost total lack of quality that he inherited from Houllier. He has built a decent squad but now he has to spend top dollar on quality players this summer instead of more squad fillers. Another summer of Keane and Dossena and I'll say yes its time for him to go.
WItdtl0Vaa	It means run for 1 minute and then take a 1-2 minute rest. Do that 10 times. That workout should help build speed. To build stamina, go for long runs. Just jog 5-7 miles on the days you're not doing speed workouts. Good luck in track!|`|fo2E0NOLaa	Congrats on joining track & field, it's a great sport.<br>  <br>  As for your question, 10 x 1 minute probably means to run hard for a minute and then rest for 1-2 min. Repeat this 10 times. I'm pretty sure that's what he means.|`|GElfG0Vlaa	Thats what it means but that isn't what everybody should do. It depends what your event is.

xQFWjFyZaa	Span is more of a complete package. Hermida can provide some power, and maybe a decent average if you're lucky. Span has good speed, decent power, and a good average.<br>  <br>  I project Span's stats to be around .285 14 HR 83 RBI 90 Runs 26 SB<br>  <br>  That's if he plays the whole season.|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	This a toughy...i would go with span for now but don't expect either OF to give you much production even if they're on your bench.|`|ea5d3bd72b30b35cee341b84c4025d7baa	Span has a higher value than Hermida, but the problem about Span is having a starting gig. Currently, Delmon Young, Carlos Gomez, and Michael Cuddyer are the projected starting OF, and with Jason Kubel as the starting DH, Span is once again regulated as a backup OF. Unless one of these four players gets injured, I only see a spot start for Span and probably not matching his 2008 numbers. <br>  <br>  Hermida is not an ideal OF to pick up, but at least he has a starting gig in Florida. Despite mediocre seasons, he's still only 25 and is waiting to shine with a depleted offense. The indication that he was avaliable in the trade market this past offseason means he still has value. If your not comfortable keeping Span because he doesn't have a starting spot in Minnesota, feel freely to pick up Hermida.|`|faf42318f3fc2bbe429706ae27cc12a9aa	Keep  Span<br>  <br>  Hermidia will lose playing time to Maybin|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Span

4uf044sFaa	My favorite memory was the California race back in 2000.  Matt Kenseth lead the most laps and pretty much had the victory wrapped up, but there was a late caution and Matt took four tires and Jeremy Mayfield took 2 tires and got out front and won the race.  I was upset, but I was happy at the same time because it was nice to see Matt run good and contend for the win.|`|YHYT8qMKaa	Pretty cool idea.

aym20hIgaa	Yes i bet they gave Rubio  5 million dollars more to lose that fight.. Rubio said he didnt want to come back out and fight. He said he had enough. That match was rigged . I believe Rubio did sold himself out. How he didnt want to fight no more , Rubio wasnt even hurt. Man he looked like he didnt want to fight from the beginning of the round 1 ,  look like top rank owners told him well give u extra 5 million if u make believe u swinging and get hit alot and just quit. Wow thats a wrong way for kelly palvik to win.|`|036906b3ee1ba2b6f544c6c2610a7cebaa	I never seen a Rubio fight but I think he gave Pavlik a hell of a fight.  Pavlik won by ko but he didn't look that impressive to me, which is a credit to Rubio.  As for Rubio being paid off?  Why would he lose intentionally for a few thousand when he can make so much more having  the Middleweight title?  That makes no sense to me, I think he just couldn't take Pavliks power and thats why he quit.|`|xgBNImTHaa	not even has he fought any one with the class of kelly nope kelly is the real deal your just tryin to find find ways to put the ghost down he had more class then rubio and everything|`|vFthoB6Haa	that's ridiculous..he just found pavlik's punches too strong i guess..|`|CDeZOLmgaa	In boxing with promoters I would never rule out a payoff, to do so would be naive. But I think in the case last night Pavlik just had to much power, he hit too hard. I think Rubio tasted a few shots and decided that if he throws punches at Pavlik he leaves himself open to be hit back. Where as if he just leaves his hands up he can take his payday and not get hurt.<br>  <br>  Pavlik was just constantly in front of him throwing hard punches, I think Rubio lacked the heart to risk getting hit by fighting back.<br>  <br>  Either he took a bribe to not fight which tell me that he has no heart or pride, or he was scared to throw back for fear of being hit by Pavliks big shots which also lacks heart. Either way Rubio fought with no heart and deserved to lose.|`|I9Y6fxguaa	I do not think so. Pav is a good boxer. Even though Rubio was able to handle Pavlik's fire power he was outboxed every round.

I suggest using the side of a car so then you can ride off the end of it. But do not get descoraged because it took me a year to learn just practice as much as possible and i wold suggest timing your practice minutes so you can know how long it took you to learn. It usually takes about 30 hours of practice so practice about an hour a day or more if possible don't give up.

(ie go skiing not in the EU, but still in Europe and UK?)<br>  <br>  Never been skiing in Scotland - but pretty much hardcore in terms of tolerance and lift facilities - hardcore as in have to tolerate much.<br>  <br>  New potential mates - go to the party places, ie Verbier, Val d'Isere, Meribel St Anton, etc. - problem is that cos they are popular, they will be expensive<br>  <br>  New ski mates - I can recommend Club Med: all inclusive lessons and passes(prices seem steep to start with, but you don't need to spend a penny once ou get there!) parties, all you can drink, lessons are structured.<br>  <br>  If you are a beginner, you can't cheap skate on!

Punuw2Ktaa	Must Know Info. on TaeKwon Do:<br>  Do you want to compete or better self-defense?<br>  Hello, my name is Ken--pre-black belt in TaeKwon Do and i think the answer to your question depends on self-interest. <br>  <br>  Genuine?  <br>      I have discovered in the past years that there's only a few places that actually teaches the "Genuine" form of a art. Thus choosing the right place might be more important than the art itself. <br>  <br>  Masters?<br>      A student observes his/her master from every aspect, when they are learning from them, because martial art is not just about fighting or sparring, but about morality and enlightenment - Reason & Logic. Make sure to find out the history of your master, what he or she use to do, why, and from who they learn their art(s) from.<br>  <br>  Reasoning & Logic behind TaeKwon Do:<br>       Your legs are the strongest part of your body because it carries your weight and is used the most in your everyday activity -- so it already has endurance. All you need now is to practice enough to use your legs efficiently out of instinct. And aside from the controversy of the usage of legs, it can be as fast as your arms or even faster. <br>  <br>  4 General Types of TaeKwon Do:<br>  Intro:<br>  Korea, with its main separation between the North and South, economically, and cultural wise. The South have more nutrition and grows taller, thus the south has more emphases on kicking. <br>  <br>  The North of Korea has less nutrition, tend to grow more horizontally but more body mass, thus they emphasize upper body movements. <br>  <br>  TaeKwon Do exists on both sides, so make sure of your choices of lower body (waste, and kicking) and or upper boddy (punching), so it's crucial to ask your master of his origin.  <br>  <br>  There is the Olympic Taekwon Do that's is widely known and referred to, and then there's Street Fight Taekwon Do (very rare), developed to be practicing same moves, but different ways to strike using different part of the foot, and having different extracting method of each kick/punch. <br>  <br>  Example: The difference in a Round-House Kick:<br>        A perfect Round-House Kick (even though your foot comes from the side, your knees are to come from the front, perfectly aligned with your head) in the Olympic TKD uses the insteps (the part between your toes and ankle) of the foot to increase speed and makesound.     <br>      <br>        But in Street Fight TKD, they will teach you that a Round-House Kick must be done by the "ball of the foot" which is where the toes joints with rest of the foot. Kicking with the same part of your foot as if you would do a front kick. <br>  Different Colors of Belts In TaeKwon Do:<br>  There are 2 types of places using different colors of belts. <br>  There are places where there's many belts, including orange colors, brown colors and so on. Needless to say, those are places that wants more money since getting a black belt is prolonged. <br>  <br>  Then, there's the official places where you go from:<br>  White - yellow<br>  yellow - high yellow<br>  high yellow - green<br>  high green - blue<br>  high blue - red<br>  red - high red (might be optional in some places)<br>  high red - pre-black<br>  and finally pre-black - black <br>  *You'll know it's official when you add up each amount of time to obtain each belt, and it should come up to about 4 to at most 5 years to obtain a black belt. <br>  *The highest belt you can obtain in US is 2nd Degree Black Belt, because TKD Association requires higher ones to be obtained in Korea. <br>  I have no knowledge of Shotokan, so i can only tell you about TaeKwon Do, hope it helps :-D and good luck.|`|J13nj1N3aa	How does tkd and shotokan have anything to do with each other.......Shotokan is wrong.....|`|SaZNFfknaa	tkd totally|`|LUnscegvaa	It's down to what you prefer.<br>  <br>  Personally I'd choose Shotokan, solely because I've studied it previously and I'm more familiar with it and the Japanese terminology.<br>  <br>  Best wishes :)***|`|04224b55dbe6d25a34730fdddf5252b9aa	Shotokan

9Kt7p7Vfaa	Shorter skis are easier to learn tricks for two reasons, first there is less swing weight while spinning and secondly you have less ski to land on meaning your balance will need to be better. If you haven't tried any tricks its not really a good idea to challenge a friend. You'll end up pushing yourself beyond your abilities and cause injury. Start slowly on small jumps and low boxes and if you can head out once or twice before this challenge.

Tights also have a place for your feet. Breeches are just pants.|`|NCjR5efGaa	Breeches are suitable for use in shows and are warmer for winter.

wNI6W8sdaa	Im not entirely sure about how much AC Milan should be paying. It all comes down to how much they want him. Personally, i think that Milan should pursue him because with the accuracy that he has with his passes and crosses, they can use him and be able to harness inzaghi's ability to get to the ball and score more goal and contend for the scudetto.

Ditch Bernier. Maybe do something about Ohlund.
B3tSfWM1aa	I'm a girl too and 16, so I kinda understand the feeling of being scared of being too old. But don't worry, you're never too old to start a martial art.<br>  I train Go-Shin Ryu Jujitsu in my local area, and absolutely love it. I was nervous at first, but suprisingly the class had a wide variation in terms of age groups and skill levels. <br>  Our sensei is extremely helpful, and the other students are very friendly and willing to work with me, regardless of rank or experience.<br>  For example, a black belt, twice my size and far stronger than I am currently, had to carry me around the dojo on his back. But of course, as soon as he was done, I was expected to carry him around on mine too, no matter how long it took me!<br>  We really do a wide variety of things, one day we will be practising kata, the next we'll be working on fitness and stretching, or just getting our throws right, or hell, spinning each other around and seeing if we can manage to run straight! That's why I enjoy what I do. Everything isn't rigid and stuck to one routine, and if I'm ever stuck or confused, sensei and the other students are always close by and willing to help.<br>  But really it's all about you. Look around, try out a few classes. Alot of MA classes in my local area offer the first lesson for free as a taster for new beginners. Try see if any places do something similar!<br>  Do different things, and don't be afraid to step back and admit that a certain style is not for you! I first joined Kung Fu, and whilst it was perfect for my dad, I had a hard time getting into it, and eventually found that jujitsu was what I truly enjoyed. :)|`|9acecfe013688b42e34dc45164da13cbaa	well if you want to compete, then judo would be great, or also brazilian jiu jitsu, at the school i train at the BJJ guys are always going to grappling and submission tournaments and one judoka made it to the paralympics, she was on the news.  Or if you like hard martial arts instead of soft, you could do karate again or tae kwon do, but thats limited contact. But whatever you enjoy doing, maybe you are a striker or a grappler, just make sure its a good school, not those mcdojos that promise a black belt within a certain amount of time, or that require an expensive contract.|`|O9NHDTj3aa	try brazilian handbagjitsu its good for a saterday nite on the town ah no just kiddin,i would do jujitsu of some sort maby judo|`|VSfLpXIPaa	wing chun ( kung-fu )|`|YDGaB4GAaa	for a girl? it makes no difference honestly! you want to be just as good as you are on your feet as you are on the ground! so take both BJJ (brazilian jui jitzu, submissions, grappling) and muay thai( striking, kicks, on your feet)|`|apr9gsgjaa	WING CHUN!!!

This is true no matter how well build the man is. A sissor (done with the stronger legs) will be much more effective and most (evenly matched) competitors can survive that just fine.<br>  <br>  Between two reasonably well-matched opponents, it is not going to be very effective.

The follow are the requirement to become a lifeguard as bare minimum:<br>  *Bronze Cross<br>  *Aquatic Emergency Care/ Standard First Aid<br>  *CPR C (or getting replaced to be called Advance CPR)<br>  *National Lifeguard Service -Pool (Really its not that hard, if you could tread water for 3 minutes with wrist out of water you're pretty much good to go)<br>  <br>  Recommended:<br>  AED <br>  National Lifeguard Service -Water park<br>  Pool Operator Level 1 (People would love you if you have it, however, from what I know its hard to find the course, and even harder to pass)<br>  <br>  Honestly I would try to apply in City Pool as first choice, DO NOT choose water park usually you get Also more problems associated with it, such as West Edmonton Mall the recruiting of lifeguard is like dog eats dogs.

EGe0k8P6aa	Before people here can help you, we need to know what do you want to do with it (target shooting, hunting, plinking...) and how much are you willing to spend (the last can be relevant because in general the good quality, high power guns tend to be expensive, IE in the $200-$1000+ range). It also helps to know what kind of gun you want (multi-pump pneumatic, spring piston, precharged pneumatic, co2) since that determines what we should be recommending.<br>  <br>  In general, PCP and magnum spring piston guns deliver the most power. Top honors in the power department go to PCP guns. You'll get some who disagree and claim that a specific springer, like Gamo's Hunter Extreme, should take top honors, but springers can't compete with something like a .22 caliber Airforce Condor's 55+ ft-lbs of muzzle energy (much less what a DAQ big-bore delivers) in terms of power.  Multi-pump guns tend to deliver less power than the previous powerplants, though they're still powerful enough for hunting at reasonable ranges (20-30 yards or so) and some customized/tuned multi-pump guns can rival magnum spring piston guns in terms of power. C02 guns have a couple issues that affect their use as hunting weapons (low pressures and the impact ambient temperature has on point of aim) so they tend to be relegated to target/plinking guns.<br>  <br>  If you simply want the most powerful airgun possible, you're looking at a custom made pcp big-bore. Currently I think the Barnes Justice holds the top honors there with a 900+ grain pellet and over 600 ft-lbs of muzzle energy. Runner up is the DAQ .457 Outlaw shooting a 420-430 grain pellet at over 500 ft-lbs of muzzle energy. The Sam Yang 909 and Career Dragonslayer are currently vying for the title of most powerful production airgun.<br>  <br>  If you want a powerful gun for hunting small game and plinking, you've got a lot of choices. Those include powerhouses like the PCP Airforce Condor, Evanix Hunting Master AR6 / AR4, Sumatra 2500, and Shinsung Career 707 (all of which should give you well over 30 ft-lbs of muzzle energy, and some of which will give you more than 50 ft-lbs of muzzle energy) to more modest PCP guns like the Benjamin Discovery (20-22 ft-lbs of muzzle energy). Or Spring piston guns like the RWS 34, RWS 350, RWS 460, Gamo Big Cat, Gamo Hunter Extreme, Gamo CFX, Beeman R1, and Beeman HW77 MKII Carbine. If you like pump pneumatic rifles, you can chose from the Benjamin 392, Daisy, 22SG, Benjamin 397, Crosman 2100, Daisy 880, and Daisy 901.<br>  <br>  If you want to target shoot you'll need to find out what the specific rules for your competition call for.|`|39d77d396b6018aac260eb632b7665f9aa	>>High powered pellet gun<<<br>  <br>  How powerful and what's your price range?<br>  <br>  Around $60<br>  Crosman 2100 - 9fpe<br>  Multi Pump Pneumatic<br>  <br>  Around $140<br>  Benjamin 397(.177) 392(.22) - 11fpe<br>  Multi pump<br>  Gamo Big Cat - 13fpe<br>  Break barrel springer<br>  <br>  Around $200<br>  RWS 34 - 15fpe<br>  Break barrel <br>  <br>  Around $400<br>  RWS 350 Magnum - 25fpe<br>  break barrel springer<br>  <br>  Around $600<br>  Evanix Hunting Master AR6 - 60fpe<br>  AirForce Condor - 60fpe<br>  Precharged Pneumatics<br>  <br>  Around $2,000<br>  Daystate Air Ranger - 80fpe<br>  PCP<br>  <br>  Airgun sales<br>  <a href="http://www.pyramydair.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pyramydair.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.airgundepot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.airgundepot.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.airgunsbbguns.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.airgunsbbguns.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.airgunwarehouseinc.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.airgunwarehouseinc.com</a><br>  Take a look, maybe you will find what you're looking for in your price range.<br>  <br>  Production pellet** guns<br>  "Generally" speaking, Pumpers are the weakest followed by Springers with PCPs being the most powerful..<br>  <br>  **.177, .20, .22, .25 <br>  Airguns above .25 caliber are considered to be big bore airguns...|`|OrvTG44laa	Depends on what you mean by high powered.  I consider any pellet gun that's 1000 fps to be high powered.  But some people might not.  The Gamo Hunter Extreme, for example, shoots at 1600 fps- fastest pellet rifle available, besides those $2000 big boar air guns.  <br>  I'll assume you are hunting with it if you want a high powered pellet gun.  The Crosman Quest shoots at 1000 fps in .177 caliber.  This would be adequate for birds, rabbits and jackrabbits, squirrels, mice and rats.  It costs about 100 dollars.  It is made of all wood and metal, except for the trigger guard and sights.  It is very accurate and a good small game pellet gun.|`|LbHyZksdaa	The Gamo Shadow Sport..ive owned this gun for about 2 years and use it every weekend during deer and goose season. It has never failed me yet and it comes with a very good 3-9 scope. its light durable and shoots about 1200 fps with a 30 pound cocking effort. Most reliable gun on the market. always go with gamo.|`|Hxttt7G0aa	I like the Diana by RWS from Germany and a couple more RWS guns, or Benjamin pump in the US for good reliable guns. Those made in China, even for other companies, tend to be CRAP! There are some good English ones too, but they tend to be really expensive.<br>  <br>  Gamo and Crossman suck. So do the new Mexican guns made in China, I forget the name.|`|oSakZ1asaa	If you have the cash, wait for this...<br>  <a href="http://www.crosman.com/airguns/new2009" rel="nofollow">http://www.crosman.com/airguns/new2009</a> Marauder will cost about $500 with pump. Then a scope will run another $100-150. That's my idea of high powered.|`|UrNVuFx6aa	Without knowing what the air rifle would be used for there is no way to make an accurate recommendation. An air rifle used for only target shooting would not be the same as one used for hunting. One used for hunting would not be the best choice for Olympic 10 meter shooting. I will make a recommendation based upon what I would use the air rifle for: hunting small game and target practice. In that case I would recommend the Air Venturi Avenger 1100 in .22 caliber. Some game can be taken with .177, but most will require the added penetration and larger wound channel afforded by using the larger .22 caliber.<br>  Just my two cents: the final decision is what makes you happy. Enjoy your shooting and stay safe.

Hxttt7G0aa	Depends on the state if in the US. I think some of the most liberal states like Cal or Illinois and  some others I would want to know specifically.|`|OrvTG44laa	In the Us, no.  In Canada, I believe if it's over 450 fps it must be registered as a firearm.  In the UK, I don't think so, but I am not sure.|`|oSakZ1asaa	NJ, IL some other communities. NYC, plain old not allowed to use it.|`|EGe0k8P6aa	It depends on where you live. In Canada any airgun with a muzzle velocity over 500 fps is considered a firearm and must be registered as such. In the UK, any air rifle with over 12 ft-lbs of muzzle energy is considered a firearm and must be registered as such. In the United States air rifles are usually not considered firearms and as such are normally not required to be licensed (though this varies a bit). There are a couple states (New Jersey comes to mind) and cities NYC which insist on trying to regulate airgun sales. Whether these restrictions are legal... That's another debate and one that requires a lawyer to answer.

AA10702710	I once special ordered a gun through Walmart because no one else had them in stock and no one else seemed to want to special order for me.  The Walmarts that sell guns usually have a "book" behind the counter with all the long guns they can special order for you.  Ask to see it sometime; they have some speical relationships with some of the larger firearms distributors in the USA.  I wanted a Remington 870 Express in 28 gauge, and they special ordered it for me.  I think it cost me about $275 plus tax.<br>  <br>  Having said the above, I had no problem with the gun that I purchased through Walmart.  The only thing I will say is that many of the Walmarts that I visit have the cheapest crap on the shelves for sale.  Of course, the only problem with special ordering is that you don't get to see the rifle/shotgun before you buy it (they require a down payment before they will special order for you).  I personally like to check-out the wood grain before I buy a rifle or shotgun - but with a Rem. 870 Express, it's all pretty much the same birchwood anways.<br>  <br>  I recall many years ago when Kmart was having a sale on the Remington 760 rifles.  A guy at one of the gun shops told me they were so cheap because they were "factory seconds" and that the holes that were drilled and tapped for the scope mounts would not line-up.  At the time, I believed him.  Much later I got involved in the firearms business myself and learned that gun companies are not going to knowingly sell "factory seconds" to the public; it would be a customer service nightmare for them.|`|EGe0k8P6aa	Based on past experience, I'd avoid buying from Walmart unless they're offering an extremely [emphasis on the extremely] good deal. Its not that Walmart doesn't have good guns. They do. But as you said, Walmart doesn't allow you to return firearms so you have to deal with the manufacturer which can range from extremely pleasant to a royal pain in the bum... (I finally wound up selling a Henry .22 lever action with broken sights I bought at Walmart since the company was being a mule about fixing the gun and I was tired of dealing with them. And that is why I never want to buy another Henry.) The local gunshop on the other hand has a vested interest in keeping their customers happy and so if there's an issue they'll help you resolve it, either in the shop (if they have a gunsmith) or through the factory.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	The warrant (if any), for any firearm is from the manufacturer, <br>  not the dealer.<br>  A local shop with a 'smith' in residence will fix small problems as a courtesy to the customer.<br>  That's not WalMart.<br>  AFAIK Wallmart only sells american makers, so you're safe <br>  enough dealing with Marlin Winchester Remington etc.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	Their guns are cheaper but no they will not help you out if you have problems<br>  <br>  Your warranty is with the manufacturer not the store you buy it from<br>  <br>  The difference with a gun shop is that there may be knowledgeable people there that can help you with a small issue and they usually will help you ship it back to the manufacturer<br>  <br>  Personally I like to save the money <br>  There is a very small chance that there will be a problem and it isn't hard to get on the internet and contact the company yourself<br>  <br>  =========<br>  The myth of inferior Walmart guns has been spread by gun shops that can not compete with their power buying<br>  There is absolutely no basis to it<br>  Ruger and Savage are not going to risk their name selling inferior guns to anyone<br>  There was a Ruger 10/22 made specifically for Walmart<br>  It is considered by most to be one of the best examples of the gun<br>  And yes you can return defective guns to most reputable gunshops and they will at leat work with you to get the problem solved|`|4Uaiy4Ejaa	It is impossible to return a firearm to any place you purchase it unless they sell used guns also and then you will take a cut in what you paid for it.  Firearms are non returnable.  If you have a problem with the firearm you will have to send it back to the manufacturer for warrenty work.  Be prepaired you will have to inform them of what is wrong and if they find it is your fault it voids your warrenty.<br>  <br>  Also most poeple do not know this but if you worked at a gun shop you would.  Walmart guns may have the same name and model as the ones sold in gun stores but they are not made from the same materials and actually have completly different product codes.  They are the same weapon just not built the same.  Very little quality control.  Same with their ammo.  I have seen an entire 100 round box of Walmart Winchester White Box in 45 ACP pressed in backwards and the store cannot take back the ammo.|`|vea6mqPZaa	No problems.<br>  <br>  I know of no dealer that will allow returns, although a "Shop" will do adjustments for you or send it to the manufacture for work at no charge.<br>  <br>  The key being they send it for you.<br>  I just spent $50 sending a rifle in for a ramp job and to have the barrel re timed.<br>  <br>  This is is $50 i would have saved if I had bought it from a dealer and not walmart.<br>  <br>  Then again it was $80 less at walmart...|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Yes that's the Policy anywhere regarding Guns & Ammo.*|`|lT8MEI6Raa	I bought a shotgun from walmart and I love it.

ed267479f27546042f4df709b0f24f80aa	well in Europe it's referred to soccer , but American football is where you have 11 players on each side of the ball (offense and defense). The offense can run or pass against the defense.  The defense is just there to stop them.  The offense has 4 chances known as downs to get 10 yards at a time known as a first down.  You get as many first downs as you can until you come across a 4th down.  Now depending how many yards it is and where the offense is at on the field, they can either go for it or kick a field goal(worth 3 points).

The most popular of these world-wide is association football (also known as soccer). The English word "football" is also applied to American football, Australian rules football, Canadian football, Gaelic football, rugby football (rugby union and rugby league), and related games. All of these codes (specific sets of rules) are referred to as "football" by their followers.<br>  <br>  However, it should be a crime calling European football soccer.

The object of the game is to score by manoeuvring the ball into the opposing goal; only the goalkeepers may use their hands or arms to propel the ball in general play. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is tied at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extended time, depending on the format of the competition...<br>  <br>  KICK OFF  following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play. <br>  THROW -IN:  when the ball has wholly crossed the touchline; awarded to opposing team to that which last touched the ball. <br>  GOAL KICK:  when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by an attacker; awarded to defending team. <br>  CORNER KICK:  when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a defender; awarded to attacking team. <br>  Indirect free kick: awarded to the opposing team following "non-penal" fouls, certain technical infringements, or when play is stopped to caution/send-off an opponent without a specific foul having occurred. A goal may not be scored directly from an indirect free kick. <br>  DIRECT FREE KICK: awarded to fouled team following certain listed "penal" fouls. <br>  PENALTY KICKawarded to the fouled team following a foul usually punishable by a direct free kick but that has occurred within their opponent's penalty area. <br>  DROPPED - BALL  occurs when the referee has stopped play for any other reason (e.g., a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective). This restart is uncommon in adult games. <br>  <br>   Fouls and misconduct:<br>  A foul occurs when a player commits a specific offence listed in the Laws of the Game when the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of "penal fouls", punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick.<br>  <br>   Offside<br>  The offside law effectively limits the ability of attacking players to remain forward (i.e. closer to the opponent's goal-line) of the ball, the second-to-last defending player (which can include the goalkeeper), and the half-way line.

WGmob26jaa	I also took surfing lessons in NJ but in Surf city and I also couldn't get enough of it (2 years ago). <br>  <br>   First of all you weren't wrong to try to learn on a short board it 's possible but harder than a longer one. I do reccomend learning on a bigger board so you can get the basics down and not get frustrated over not being able to stand up. <br>  <br>  Secound- The fins of your surf board should be fine if you take good care of them. If they break for some reason of get a huge chip in them they should be replaced. If you aren't sure of how to do this you can probably take it to a shop and most can repair it for you. If you want to do it yourself you'll need: a Hex key, Replacement surfboard fin,Cotton swab, Light lubricant. Then follow this:  <br>  1 Locate a place where you can perform the work without damaging the surfboard. You will need some leverage when using the hex key, but you don't want the surfboard falling onto a hard surface while changing the fin. <br>  Step 2 Insert hex key into hex screw and begin unscrewing. <br>  Step 3 Take out all hex screws and remove the fin. If the fin has broken off, then turn the surfboard over, fin side down, and gently tap over the location where the fin was installed. The fin tabs should fall out. <br>  Step 4 Using the cotton swab, clean out any sand that has made its way into the fin slot. <br>  Step 5 Insert the new surfboard fin and screw in the hex screws.<br>   (remmber if the fins don't have a problem with them you don't need to change them, do not attemp to do it yourself unless you are okay with possibly damaging your board).<br>  <br>  <br>  Third- Wax is pretty simple your gonna have to go to a local surf shop and pick up to differnt types of wax a base coat and a cool coat. The Base coat goes on first and you move your hand in a up and down motion along your board to apply it. After your done with the base coat you should apply the cool coat this protects the basecoat from melting, you apply it the same way and when you do you should see almost little bumps on your board. If the wax on your board it melting off or covered with to much sand when takes away from its grip then you can buy a wax comb which will help you remove the wax from your board so you can replace it with new wax.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also when your not surfing I would reccommed to kep your board out of the sun beacuse it can change your board into a darker yellow color. Also i would recommened getting a grip pad for your board this is for your back foot you may have seen it on some other boards. I'm guessing you have a leash if not then buy one of those if you can. The accessories I'm metioning aren't need but they can help. Also a wet suit can get warm in the summer if you are surfing from all of the activity if this happens you can get a rash gaurd which will help prevent getting a rash when laying on your board or moving on your board.<br>   <br>  Just so you now to slow down on a surf board you put your weight on your back foot to accelerate you put your weight on your front foot. To turn you put weight on your back leg and turn your leading shoulder in the direction you want to turn.|`|N7CiDYmUaa	Go to Malibu they have really good waves!!|`|Op1WIwyPaa	Fins- If they are in boxes than they are removable, most commonly FCS or Future fins.<br>  <br>  Wax- just buy the right type for your water temp. <br>  <br>  The Surfboard Man<br>  <a href="http://www.thesurfboardman.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesurfboardman.com/</a>|`|M6fzLJtmaa	Just get in the water as much as posssible, if you have a friend who surfs go with that person. you can also ask people who you see in teh water for advice, check surfline and find a good spot and have fun
jDwX2HE2aa	yes you do need a visa and you can go without your parents however you will be inducted into the youth program first. and you sign a contract saying your with this club. FIFA will know you made a contract when you sign with the FIRST TEAM and your chances..i advise you to work hard before you try out i also advise to spend about 2 weeks down there practice before your trial so you get use to the pace and style of the game its much different in N.A then in europe pace is faster|`|dFgC0cN1aa	I think that it is a legit rule but there are probably loopholes. And yes, I am pretty sure you can sign with their youth development team without your parents moving in..you obviously still need their consent though and a visa and so on<br>  im sorry i cant tell you much about anything else...i think if your really good you have a legit chance of making it. however, you will need a few more years to be actually even on the reserve roster<br>  good luck|`|KmMRHKTNaa	This is ur second time asking ur question...wow...

I38WF5aFaa	I don't know hobie kayaks but I have been very happy with my Wilderness Systems Pungo 140.  Its stable enough so I don't feel nervous when the wind kicks up 3 foot waves. Mine is set up with 2 rod holders,  a fish finder and an anchor.  I fly fish out of it as well as troll on some big lakes.  I don't recommend a sit on top kayak because you will get wet,  mostly from water dripping off the paddle.  A spray skirt will keep you dry which is nice when the water is cold.  It effectively adds a month to each end of your fishing season.  Don't skimp on a paddle.  A good paddle makes the trip more enjoyable and the traveling more efficient.  Another necessity for fishing is a paddle leash.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	get the widest one they offer. it will give you more stability. this is the one with the foot operated fins for propulsion, right? l've only heard good things about these except for the price. a bit high. but l guess it's worth it. <br>  l use a cobra fish n dive. it's a good one too.<br>  enjoy. and good fishin' to ya!

2C8Kjj78aa	I'm not sure exactly where you are located, or what your league's rules are regarding transfers, so this is a hard question to answer.  In the high school league where I used to coach, you couldn't play if you transferred after the league season had started, but you could the next year.  <br>  <br>  My advice is for you to talk with your current school's athletic director and get the story on how transfers are treated in your area.  <br>  <br>  Find out if you can practice with the team to keep your skills up, and maybe help out taking stats or something so that the coach gets to know you as a team player.|`|PO5Q7POuaa	Well as far as I know juniors can play on the varsity team it's just you would have to be really good and able to keep up with the competition.

Then you can pull the net over the boot and fasten with safety pins or sew on a hook.

J2IWbhSvaa	You could wear a blister plaster. They are really good at stopping the rubbing.|`|PU6VpvEIaa	hahaha this may be dumb but if it s only one foot..make sure there is nothing between the strap of your binding and your boot. A friend had the same problem and after many days of boarding i finally figured out that he actually always put the strap over the clip that holds his boot to the board. The pressure dagged the clip into his foot and he had this horrible pain just like the one you have described. If this doesn't help... simply try things like:<br>  Try losing up the binding a bit (sounds dumb but sometimes simple things help) <br>  Mess around with how high or low on your boot your bindings sit on your boot<br>  <br>  And dumb things like that... guarantee one of them will help. Let me know if you need anything else  :)

I say ALMOST impossible because I have seen it done once or twice.
qZ23brcwaa	If you're very sore, you should rest. Muscles build when resting not training. I did a bit of research not too long ago on working out. All of the sites i went to mentioned it was bad working out when you're sore. Not only can you hurt yourself, but it turns out to be pretty pointless. you just end up burning your muscle. thats why its recommended to work out 45min-1hr. if you work out for too long it just comes to be pointless and you can hurt yourself like i said. you don't want to over do it. <br>  <br>  What you should do is have like a workout plan every week and see what days you can/should work out and then leave 1-2 days to rest.|`|J6xmZqj1aa	Rest.  It is better to be in not as good shape but to be healthy, than it is to be super fit and injured.  I know from lots of experience.|`|AA10745377	In your case rest.  Being that you'll have a soccer practice or something like that to shake the soreness out it would be unnecessary for you to run.  If you don't have practice maybe try light stretching and/or running for 5-10 mins to shake the soreness and latic acid out of your legs.|`|8M1pYeeoaa	well you shoukd probably be resting and its <br>  sore bcuz you probably pushed your self <br>  and  your body is not used to it.  and<br>  i also hear that oranges and <br>  peanut nutter help<br>  but i dont think<br>  you mix em <br>  together well<br>  i hope that i helped<br>  you good luck and feel <br>  better............................=)|`|4ab39422c7923ec245fd8bc42df199c9aa	sorry hun, the ony real cure for that is to keep conditioning them <br>  it will get easier with time but for now just soak them in water and try to kind of massage them<br>  it worked for me during my soccer season|`|5UT0fV2Laa	you need to give your body time to rest and heal. Keep stretching so that your muscles don't tighten up as much, that'll lessen the soreness

LIKkt8djaa	I think so, specially compared to the non rockered www, I've heard nothing but great things on the Jibpan, great pop, good soft flex in the nose and tail. Just a great all around board and from one of the people I've heard from he rides it everywhere. It's actually one of the boards I'm considering picking up for next year since they'll also be bringing a reverse camber design for it.

oCAZxBNYaa	It sounds like you may be having a problem with your planter facia (the bottom of your foot).  If the pain is on the inside of the flat of your foot it could be a start of something more serious unless you let it heal, get the right shoes and work on your form a bit.<br>  <br>  Onre thing you can do if it is Plantar Faciitis is whn you are at home you can roll a frozen water bottle under your feet as you sit down.  This will help strech and sooth the long band tendons that hold the foot together.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend that you go to a good running shoe store and get fitted by a pro.  Also, I would look up running form on Youtube watch some videos on correct running style.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a Little,<br>  <br>  Dennis|`|2gz6ad5kaa	you could go to a place called Running Lab. they will get u a perfect shoe. and if u want more cushion u cud also buy insoles that u cud find at Sports Authority or any store.|`|Ck6Q7FWNaa	i think you might need a bigger shoe ... just from my experience or maybe athletes foot but idk have you been to your docter but then again try using icey hot..or bena freeze|`|ubIjMK6Gaa	It's most likely your shoes. Although they are only 2 months old, they are probably not the right shoe for you. Go to a store where you can speak with a professional who will examine your feet and give you a shoe that is right for you.

b6409d0698e9c6583a1669074645c787aa	In my personal opinion I believe it would have to be Jordan Larson of the Nebraska Huskers or Jordan Larson of the Penn State Nittany Lions. If you've ever watched them play they are the essence of volleyball. Plus, they're teams are very highly ranked in collegiate volleyball.|`|a5u9ceV0aa	Well the most obvious would be either Kerri Walsh or Misty May. However, i believe they're both taking a break from playing beach, because they both want kids. <br>  <br>  The next i would say would be Nicole Branagh or Elaine Youngs. They too were partners in the Olympics, though they didn't get as far as Misy and Kerri did.|`|GBzz7Wkzaa	Everyone says May and Walsh.<br>  <br>  I must disagree and say Dalhausser and Rogers.<br>  <br>  Now i'd bet that dalhausser and rogers would absolutely slaughter may and walsh in a game.  <br>  <br>  You said BEST player, sex shouldn't matter.  And the best player is gonna be male.<br>  <br>  Lloy Ball, the setter for the US mens team is one of my favorites though|`|n9R8r8Siaa	without a doubt the best hitter is Leonel Marshall, his vertical is 52 inches standing look him up on youtube, incredible, and im sorry if he's retired but i dont think he is , also look up Dante, Giba ,Matey and wlazly.|`|ctcjmYYqaa	no one gives a flying **** about girls vball,  but the best player in the world is GIBA because he is so quick and he can cut off sets like no other|`|9WJ1mYkwaa	Without a doubt Misty May.

LIKkt8djaa	You can't find a proper size without your weight,riding style and shoe size. Picking one on just your height alone is a rookie mistake.<br>  <br>  SNOWBOARDING STYLES EXPLAINED<br>  <br>  Freeride: longer in length, and semi-directional. Moderate to stiff in flex. Used for long, fast turns in various types of snow from groomed hard-pack to soft powder.<br>  <br>  Freestyle: Generally shorter in length with a Semi-directional or twin-tip shape. Moderate to soft in flex. Incorporates a deep sidecut for quick/tight turning. Used in the pipe and in the park on various jumps and terrain features including boxes, rails, and tables.<br>  <br>  All-Mountain: A hybrid between freeride and freestyle boards. The 'jack of all trades, master of none.' Normally directional in shape with either a twin or directional flex. Moderate in flex for various types of terrain.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Alright well I would look anywhere from 143-147 for a freeride deck at your size, You could continue using that 143 it works Some simple guidelines you can follow is remembering that the longer the board the more stable it will be for you during high speed carves and it'll have an easier time floating in powder, the shorter the board the easier it'll be to maneuver around and butter.|`|WTw9BSOYaa	Id say you are really looking at about 138-144, 143 would be pretty well right where you should be, I wouldn't go too much bigger than that at all, biggest board you should look at would be a 145 in my mind.|`|HVpeJzM4aa	good, thank you for including your weight because that's the ONLY important factor in choosing a snowboard...and since you are fairly light 143 is ok for you but try going with something a little taller, maybe even a 145...unless you intend on gaining weight anytime in the next few years., then you'd want to get something bigger.|`|NMhKIe5Qaa	go with what jake m says he definetly knows his stuff personaly i prefer freestyle

NASCAR sold the right to make that decision to FOX, yell at them please..<br>  Anybody here see me write "I hate Rupert Murdock" on posts that<br>  are about SPEED, or FOX?? He owns them both...<br>  He uses Lawyers to put contingencies into contracts, such as agreeing<br>  to advertise NASCAR, and then interrupting a race to do it.. Does that<br>  even make sense to any of you??<br>  FOX ads are automatic, so no matter what happens during a sporting event of any kind, they have no ability to override a commercial..<br>  Result is we get a "cooked" version of what happened.. That is, they show it again after the commercial, and pretend it's happening when we see it.. This could lead to editing...<br>  I hate Rupert Murdock, he is a slime ball..|`|LpR9sLSlaa	I'm not sure just what the question is, <br>  but if you are complaining that the race starts too early,<br>  most will NOT agree with you.<br>  <br>  NA$CAR has historically run MOST of the races in the day time.<br>  <br>  Late starts also hurt the chances of finishing the races.<br>  <br>  Just look at last week...<br>  <br>  They started the Daytona so late, then when rain came thru the area, it was too late to wait the 3 hours for the rain to move thru, then wait ANOTHER 3 hours for them to dry the track, in the cold night air.<br>  <br>  There is a slight chance of rain again today in Fontana.<br>  The later you start the race, the harder it is to finish, if there are any "problems".<br>  <br>  As the day gets later, the temp drops, which makes it a LOT hard to dry the track, then in the warmer air, and sunshine.<br>  <br>  edit <br>  <br>  dxmmm, I knew it !<br>  a rain delay already, and it just started<br>  THIS is why they should should them earlier|`|v6zuCAJ6aa	My husband is deployed to Iraq and yet he still finds a way with an 11 hour difference from the west coast to watch EVERY race.

No, second thoughts don't tell me!|`|LReOvHEdaa	Well ..sure hope for liverpool it happens..<br>  <br>  Finally you unblocked me..I wonder why you blocked me in the first place?lol|`|uXXbegw5aa	Predict that Liverpool will win the League :)|`|Maja0Gzdaa	Good luck... :)|`|puBtuMcHaa	you should have predicted a win for today!<br>  and yeah, that one is definitely worth a go ;)<br>  make a prediction liverpool win the league AND the champions league while you're at it please (:|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	That's wishful thinking,but hey,why not?If Liverpool do win 17-0,you can be a professional pundit,you'll be making a lot of bettors happy.|`|569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	You're not the only one to put a spell on them.<br>  My dreams are always the opposite of what happens.<br>  And I dreamed that we won the City match.

This is the 4th time this has happened, and its starting to freak me out.<br>  <br>  And yes we must do all we can and hopefully it will work :)
96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	Andy Johnson wanted to leave and get back to his family in London , if a player wants to go the manager has no choice but to sell him , so no David Moyes was not wrong to sell him|`|LoFCv31waa	They seem to be doing not too bad without him, though he would probably be welcome right now given the injury situation at Goodison Park.|`|1f5996779efb6a4589f7767428fbc708aa	I liked Andrew Johnson but felt that he did not suit Everton's style of play last season. I wish that he had been a skillful midfielder with a greater ability to control play rather than rushing around like a 'headless chicken' at times. It was with deep regret that I learnt of the injury to our greatest player. Arteta, today and we can only hope that the injury is not as bad as first thought. Without Arteta we lack purpose. I believe that Andrew Johnson was sold at the right time at a reasonable price but at times I wish he was still at Goodison.|`|rzPMzoxzaa	Andy johnson looks good at the moment.he started well at everton but faded after 3 months.He is another nick barmby.Flatters to deceive.|`|c65125310c801112d2ca421b6ef869edaa	he was well liked at Goodison by everyone, i sometimes wish he was still with us but Moyes knows best.<br>  He will always be made welcome at Everton.|`|v0P0vay0aa	Yes|`|ejJukRBcaa	David Moyes is one of the best managers in the prem at the min with the money he has to spend there is no manager better than him he is the best with one exseption Sir Alex Ferguson.  Come on the blues.  Yes he was right to let AJ go he was to fast but good luck to him and us as well.|`|USuUMIlHaa	Birmingham City were wrong to sell him!<br>  And Wilson Palacios.<br>  <br>  I sense a theme occuring|`|OBE7yC5daa	david moyes is over-rated

Not quite accurate at one stage but good nevertheless.<br>  <br>  FQ: Maybe. If Dossena and Lucas don't play. It's the lowly teams who come looking for a draw that give us problems, so it's possible we could snatch a win.

JiCfYfLraa	well lita cheated on matt in real life<br>  <br>  matt found out by checking litas phone and found messages from edge(love messages).<br>  <br>  after that matt got upset and kicked lita out of his house and he was threating edge saying that he was gonna kill him. so the wwe suspended matt until he can cool off.<br>  <br>  so thats when the wwe decided to turn lita heel after the kane storyline to be with edge. then after matt cooled off they brought him back to the wwe business and decided to make him and litas PERSONAL issues into a storyline.<br>  <br>  this is what pissed lita off and caused her to retire because after she cheated on matt in real life and the wwe putting it in the storyline she fans hated her for it and she didnt like being called a slut and a whore.<br>  <br>  matt got over it though(so he says) and they patched things up and are great friends.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	First, Jeff was in TNA at the time if I remember correctly so he had no role in this.<br>  <br>  Basically, on screen Lita was with Kane but in reality she was in a long -term relationship with Matt Hardy. Matt Hardy soon discovered that she had been having an affair with his close friend Edge. Matt broke up with Lita for this and eventually made it public on the internet. Matt was released from World Wrestling Entertainment soon after but fans started shouting at Lita and Edge due to online exposure. Vince was forced to rehire Matt and he developed it into a storyline between Matt and Edge.|`|PsGNDuJ8aa	From my knowledge, Matt was out injured and during this time Lita cheated on him with Edge and to make it worse he was fired while still unable to compete.<br>  Matt found out and due to complaints from fans to wwe, he was rehired and the real life feud between edge and matt was brought to tv.<br>  I dont remeber Jeff playing a part in this storyline. Actually this is probably the same time as when he was competing in tna.<br>  Hope that explains it well!|`|c1VbXxYGaa	Well Matt & Lita loved each other she was a member of Team Extream & The Hardy Boyz Kane liked lita & Edge then debuted and liked her Matt & Kane had a match befor Edge debuted the match was who ever won got married to Lita Kane Won & got married with her Edge stated to like her & Matt & Edge & Kane Started fighting again then Matt got her again then she left him for Edge one time Kane and Lita & Matt were in a match and Lita had a broken leg or ankel & durring the match Lita tried to help Matt but she was with Kane and he lost i think and Matt & Lita Ran off together Edge and Lita got to gether not to long after that that sucks!!!|`|bE5fG9vDaa	well, matt was going out with lita, then kane tried to steal lita, then matt, and kane had a rivarilry. but edge wanted lita too, so matt edge fought for her in a 2 year feud. they had great matches too.<br>  <br>  they had a cage match, a ladder match, a street fight, and other match types as well. at the time jeff was in tna.

7Tw7s6HSaa	No, he's really patriotic but at the same time he eats and sleeps Man Utd.<br>  Wouldn't want the alky w@nker to manage the team|`|HxET88bDaa	Probably.<br>  <br>  It's only because he is at Utd that he hasn't managed Scotland...i mean which would you choose? lol<br>  <br>  He is still very patriotic, he always seems a bit guarded when people ask him about England etc and obviously has fallen out with English NT managers in the past, so i don't think he has disregarded the Scottish NT job, it's just that he has one of the ultimate jobs already and i guess he is stepping in the footsteps of a fellow Scot in Sir Matt Busby at United....|`|El7C2JsMaa	no i don't think so, its purely because he has unfinished business at Man Utd, i don't think it would make any difference if he was Brazilian, his goal since joining Man Utd has been to break Liverpool's league record and he wont leave untill that is done!<br>  <br>  Also personally i really can't see him in International management i don't think it would be enough for him, he's the sort of manager who likes the day to day running of a club in all areas, he wouldn't get this at International level.|`|cq2XIko9aa	i am liverpool fan and there are two things that are the best one fergie that i hate and other whom i love.Most Naturally gifted footballer ever and 3rd greatest Footballer who destroyed his carrier Name George Best.he said if i was born ugly you have never heard the name Pele|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Would probably have been a drugs or crime baron|`|WdOAxQmoaa	use are basically saying scotland are crap. which we're not. sir alex has managed scotland before but it was for a friendly years ago. <br>  <br>  he would only ever leave utd to manage scotland,and he wouldn't choose england over scotland that's for sure,only reason he's not been scotland manager(for a long period of time) is because he's brought success to utd.<br>  <br>  we all know man utd were nothing till he came to the club. he'll manage scotland after next season, trust me ;)|`|JCRdicqXaa	If Fergie was Brazilian born and managed the NT he would have been declared a God.|`|efGx6z3vaa	there are alot of good manger here in Brasil<br>  <br>  Zico, Cuca, renato Gauho, Muricy, Tivelini, Joel Santana. he will have a hard time|`|n18Q7t11aa	If he was Brazilian,would he be managing Man U anyway ?|`|LdJFFvSVaa	Nah he's not THAT good he's just got a good team and good staff
IWM1khX7aa	Ashley Young is way better than David Beckham.  Has a lot more speed and ball control, and he crosses good.  But I think Young should start on the left side and Theo Walcott on the right.  Both will give England a fast paced attack.  England does not have a lot of players like that and they should use them because England is not a fast team. <br>  <br>  Ashley Young is the best Left Winger in the prem and he's in his prime (23 years old).  Theo Walcott is as good as Joe Cole, and he's 19.  David Beckham, who is 32 years old is not even close to these 2 players.|`|sztJ5dhPaa	Ashley young can get better in years ahead. He definitely has done well to earn himself a place for England when he we have witnessed him scoring superb goals and plenty assists to his strikers. Beckham has done great things and knows that he now partially plays in order to give the younger players to carry the torch.<br>  <br>  Young needs to maintain his work to give himself a chance to be picked and played by Capello in games, as you observe the situation Ashley is not been put in the starting eleven so it suggests Young has got some way to go before he becomes Capellos favourite right sided midfielder.|`|zW530mElaa	Both quality Young will be a big name soon Becks has experince and a free kick master but is getting old now but i see them both playing regulary for england now they need them both after wat happend v spain|`|WdOAxQmoaa	^^who is bojan?|`|nJ5kceMBaa	I would take Young any day of the week. I'm not a fan of Beckham - I think he's only in the England squad for his fame and past glory.|`|EIsnATLxaa	I think young is better but beckham has so much more club and international experience so i'd have to pick becks|`|zprMdpxZaa	i think david becham because he got more experience|`|Maja0Gzdaa	^^Beckham may have more experience but how can Young gain experience if he's never played...?|`|uXXbegw5aa	I'd pick Young. I reckon he has a lot of potential. I think Beckham's getting a bit to old now :)|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	Who is Ashley Young????
uWUyrRFxaa	No it wouldn't it would be pretty much the same as every season.|`|EIsnATLxaa	I'd miss arsenal more they've been a top 3 team ever since i can remember but chelsea haven't...***** chelsea!!!!!|`|LReOvHEdaa	Seeing the number of fans for Arsenal worldwide..def Arsenal would be missed.Chelsea cannot afford to miss for their star studded lineup.I think they will make it.<br>  Arsenal is in danger.|`|583630813856412488308836bad3d46caa	U know wat I will be one Arsenal fan to say that we had a ******' bad season this year and if we don't end up in the Champions league too ******' bad cuz we desrved it and that is the end of it! <br>  The only thing dat will mess up the team is if hat will make our big time Players want to leave that club that'll be garbage, but **** happens so it'll be too dawm bad!|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Villa should aim the Champions cup or getting into th CL quaters and with the money they can add a few players, that will again make league more interesting because with $hitty and Arsenal ( Spurs in paper) we will have Seven teams playing to get into top four, and dont ever forget Everton.|`|RSJbqioUaa	Yes!<br>  It's the CL, like a little club init!|`|uXXbegw5aa	No, I wouldn't miss them :P|`|arjadO5daa	I am a Birmingham City fan and we are Local Rivals with Aston Villa, so it is obvious I dont want them to get there. They wont even win a Champions League match, never mind getting through the knockout stages. Arsenal will perform well in the CL next season, because they will have some time off to think about the previous season.|`|nwwhfuADaa	Yes defo. i would miss Arsenal and hope that during whichever year Aston Villa will be participating in the CL,whether it be the following or the one after as well , will be complete flops|`|KmMRHKTNaa	No! cuz its not like they will actually contend to win the CL! They will get knockout anyways in the knockout stages!<br>  Arsenal is overrated they are happy enough finishing 4th! ha losers!|`|xLyNsywiaa	I don't know about other fans, but imo, No, I really don't think I'll miss any other team in the CL besides the one I support...|`|wurimjbnaa	No, It wouldn't make a difference because they hardly win it.|`|N7fNwIQSaa	Victory through harmony...what happened to those days...all this shouting at the ref business...<br>  <br>  I would miss us!

As long as they can make people in the crowd of any kind HATE them, then they are doing their job and doing it well. It doesn't matter what their moves are, though cheating in matches help, but I personally put any way to get fans to hate you is the way of a true bad guy in Pro Wrestling.|`|qUQnsqnsaa	Attitude man, ATTITUDE! <br>  <br>  <br>  It's Randy Orton's attitude that makes him the Greatest heel on RAW today! It's Edge's attitude that makes him a great Smackdown heel, and the World Heavyweight Championship. It's all about how the certain Wrestler asks and how they want the fans to see them.|`|0esJ5Yfdaa	be able to start a good feud prepare to attack the lead face or cheat and good taunts and mic skills|`|1yOdrYiHaa	a good heel has the ability to make the crowd despise him and a great ring presenceIn my opinion a great heel, is they know how to work the crowd, they know how to make the crowd angry, they know how to get booed out the building and they know how to cheat, a great heel, needs to be able to speak well on the mic, wrestle well, cheat in the matches sometimes and like i said know how to work the crowd... in my opinion thats what makes you a good heel. Chris Jericho has done this well during the year of 2008. On SmackDown, Vickie Guerrero gains more negative attention than Edge. On Raw, Chris Jericho successfully made himself a great heel by admonishing and mocking his competition, and making a total enemy of the crowd.|`|zNajmAYFaa	I think Randy Orton defines a heel wrestler. For instance, Stone Cold had destroyed the McMahons like Orton. But, they still don't cheer for Orton as loud as the did with Stone Cold. Believe it or not, Stone Cold was mostly a heel. He said it himself. "I tried making the crowd hate me, but they would always cheer". Randy Orton should be like that. So, Randy Orton defines, not a good, but great heel wrestler.|`|v7WLVxR5aa	I think personality is the key. Edge is a good actor he brings out the emotions of all the fans causing them to interrupt with his rants. Edge is annoying to most fans. It certainly can't be his in-ring ability.

They need to give a believable amount in each segment that shows his feelings toward a situation. In - ring presence is also a huge deal for a heel. The crowd needs to "worry" about what the hero can suffer at the hands of the heel and the heel needs to place themselves as a large point in the match at all times. The finish shouldn't be too flashy since people want a hero to win or lose by just seconds. They really need to have the personality that is believable and must show that at all times when on a show. Whether it's a promo, match, or just making way to the ring the heel needs to remember that he's supposed to be insulting the fans and makes them hate him.

oWYs6Btgaa	I would have never guessed that Brodeur would miss almost the entire season or that Clemmensen would step up his game the way he has.<br>  <br>  In the pre-season, I had the Atlantic division picks:<br>  <br>  Pittsburgh<br>  New Jersey<br>  Philadelphia<br>  Rangers<br>  Islanders<br>  <br>  <br>  Boston seems to have hit a brickwall as of late, but look for them to finish strong with a solid March. I just don't know that I'm convinced they can get by teams like NJ or Washington.<br>  <br>  My sleeper in the East- will be Philadelphia. It seems every year there is a team that no one expects much from and I thought they played Pittsburgh very well last season as a 6 seed advancing all the way to the Conference Finals by handily whooping up on top seeded Montreal. I look for the Flyer nation to have something to smile about this year.|`|6cHwnaCZaa	I have learned to never underestimate New Jersey.<br>  <br>  I envisioned the Atlantic looking something like this...<br>  1. Philly<br>  2. NJ<br>  3. Pittsburgh<br>  4. NYR<br>  5. NYI<br>  <br>  If you mean by coming out of the wide open Eastern Conference, who will be the number one seed, then I have to go with Boston, they've kind of locked that one up.<br>  <br>  But If you meant who will represent the East in the SCF's (which is what I thought you meant), then I think it's hard to bet against one of the 3 division leaders. Each one has looked pretty good all season. Other than those 3, Philly has looked good, as has Florida lately. I guess I will just narrow it down to Boston and New Jersey, and no further.|`|lYnkvRASaa	I had them third in the division (behind Philly and NYR) somewhere around 6-7 overall.  When brodeur went down I thought they were done.<br>  <br>  Now I am wondering if rumors of the NJD defense demise with the departure Rafalski, Scott N, Scott S has not been exaggerated.  Clemmenson has played well but he is not supposed to be this good, they are still playing great team D.<br>  <br>  Now if Brodeur returns healthy you have to think they have a shot to come out of the east.  Caps and Philly don't have the goaltending to be considered favorites and AI still don't trust the Bruins in the playoffs.|`|Pq5Ds8F2aa	I'm feeling good with the roll NJ went on, I look forward to Marty coming back, and hope the step up a little more with his return and maybe some trade deadline Magic.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anywho, back to the question if Carolina edges out the the Rags I'd be a happy man. Also I'd like to see the Blues slide in out West.|`|AA11674745	I think I had it as:<br>  <br>  Pittsburgh<br>  Philadelphia<br>  New Jersey<br>  NY Rangers<br>  NY Islanders<br>  <br>  I would have had Brodeur in 70-72 games.<br>  <br>  I still think the Capitals will be heard from.|`|UIcItboeaa	Actually, no. I had them in the top 4. I think the standings, to this point, are pretty much where they're going to be, but I think the battle for 7 and 8 is going down to the wire.|`|nNDKyQjeaa	i think they win the east, and i had them as the 7th or 8th seed, losing in the first round in 6 or 7 games|`|42ef902b67cef343060a46d1d7776268aa	Usually I have New Jersey wedged between Pennsylvania and New York. :- )|`|206hmFyRaa	I thought they would be out of playoff contention as a devils fan. Then I saw some hope in the first win without Marty. With all the injuries the Devils have had they really surprised the NHL. When I saw they were 8 points behind the Rangers I thought to myself that if we finish behind them and lose to them we'll be a laughing stock. Then at the game I went to the AMAZING 8-5 WIN VS. THE RAGS I thought we could finish first. Then my prayers have been answers! The Rags fell and are still falling and the Devils never stopped winning! I think with Marty we can surprise the Bruins and Sharks and take home the cup. With Clemmer as a backup ( by the way he is like 2 wins from tying Queen Henrik! ) we could go far!|`|AA12103453	I honestly had them battling the Islanders for last when Brodeur went down. Although at that point all I knew of was Weekes was going to be in net, so more I expected them in last.|`|m6lDXAmoaa	I thought as soon as Brodeur was out of the picture that New Jersey would be one of the worst teams in the league for sure. I didn't think Parise would be one of the top ten scorers and I didn't think that the Devils could rely on their backup goaltenders. I was incredibly confident on those beliefs. <br>  <br>  I just took a look at the standings in the Eastern Conference and I think that the top 8 will probably be the ones heading into the playoffs. The Pens may have a turnaround towards the end of the season and sneak in past the Rangers but other than that, I don't think it's going to change much|`|64LZW2y8aa	I had the division like this:<br>  <br>  Pittsburgh<br>  NY Rangers<br>  Philadelphia<br>  NY Islanders<br>  New Jersey<br>  <br>  I thought Jersey would be last in the division because when Brodeur was in net, they weren't really scoring, and I thought it would stay like that, but I was mistaken. They tuned the offense up.|`|DvBPLP4saa	I had the Atlantic like this:<br>  <br>  Pittsburgh<br>  Rangers<br>  Philadelphia<br>  New Jersey<br>  Islanders<br>  <br>  ....So I guess I was pretty wrong about the Devils, eh? <br>  <br>  It truly is amazing what they've managed to do without Brodeur. It truly is.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Me I had them like this<br>  <br>  Pittsburgh<br>  New Jersey<br>  Philadelphia<br>  NY Rangers<br>  NY Islanders|`|G33E41IBaa	At the start of the season, I still believed the Devils would be a good team.  I had them first or second in the Atlantic.  But when Brodeur went down, I was like...crap!  I thought we would JUST make the playoffs with his absence (fight for 7th or 8th place).  Not to mention, at the same, about 7 other Devils players were in and out with injuries.  I felt the Devils were gonna stink without Brodeur, but then pull through for a playoff spot with Brodeur winning a lot of games in his return.  I was happily proven wrong.<br>  <br>  I thought we were gonna go WAY down hill because Weekes didn't play so well last season in his few appearances, but I knew Clemmensen was capable of playing well (but not THIS well).  When Clemmer was Brodeur's backup, he had almost no playing time/experience so he was pretty rusty when he was called upon to play.  This season, he had a lot of playing time in the AHL prior to being called up.  Also, as he played more games in the NHL he just started to get better and better (he shutout both the Rangers AND Bruins back to back and has had a lot of one goal games!)  I'm really pleased with the Devils' consistency and ability to win, despite losing their franchise goalie for about 4 months.<br>  <br>  I still feel the Bruins are going to dominate the East, with the Devils in second, and the Caps at a close third.

He would probably say something like "Well Kobe was starting his career, just as I was ending mine, but Kobe Bryant is definetely one of the top players in basketball, and I have nothing but respect for his game, and when I played against him, he was one of the fiercest, and toughest competitors out on the floor and was very hard to defend, when his career is over he will be one of the top players in NBA history.|`|EdDLydH7aa	I think he would probably say you can't compare the 2 b/c they went into the league differently, it's totally different than when Jordan was playing so I think he'd say Kobe is a great player, which is his, but he's no Jordan but I don't think Jordan would say that, he's to classy, he might think it, lol, but I doubt he'd say it out loud|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Jordan has already been taped saying Jordan would destroy Kobe one on one.<br>  <br>  You heard it from the master, I'll try to get the video for you guys right now....<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWhRsvb6knc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWhRsvb6k...</a>|`|h9ZRYMWzaa	i think he would dodge the question but common really everybody keeps comparing every good player to michael jordan but there's no way we'll ever get another MJ he was just so amazing|`|NALuet7Zaa	I think he would chuckle and then say<br>  <br>  "kobe is phenomenal player and one of the best players to ever play the game, but as good as me, probably, but not now."|`|Fat6h6aRaa	he would say both their styles of play are different|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	I seriously think that he would say:<br>  <br>  " Kobe is awesome, but u've heard it, Im the best"|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	"what the crap are you talking about kobe better then me is that a joke no he aint better then me" and ya i have ask him that same question and that was his answer the one i just gave|`|yt05KPhBaa	He probably would dodge the question and talk about how you really couldn't compare the two.

ypB3QDWNaa	This is impossible to answer without more information on your boat and equipment.  If you have a proper vessel, outfitted with at least minimal necessary safety equipment, then sailing across the Atlantic is only a little harder than falling off a log.  It just takes a little longer than falling off a log.  But you must be prepared for, and equiped for, the unexpected loss of your vessel during the voyage.  Me and my sailing buddies down in Key West had a saying : "Even beer cans, bathtubs, tennis shoes and coconuts can cross an ocean."<br>  <br>  About sailing solo, well then you better have a functional autopilot or windvane.  Two weeks strapped to the helm or tiller will give you a little backache.<br>  <br>  Read my link, then read his book.  And buy or rent a type 406 EPIRB for your trip.
86cf8078d236374316794f7c3867ec19aa	Unless they are completely brain-dead they will have it be Undertaker v.s. HBK. JBL is way out of shape and if they actually do Koslov he is going to turn out to be another Giant Gonzalez. I forget his real name but Vladimir Koslov should never have become a Pro-Wrestler. He has the genuine martial arts skills and should have done MMA. He is a good fighter he just doesn't know how to choreograph a fight which is what Pro-wrestling actually is. I think if they do put Undertaker v.s. Koslov then Undertaker could possibly carry him to a decent match. But even Undertaker isn't good enough to carry JBL to a decent match. The guy should have stayed as an announcer. The problem with having HBK as the opponent is that you will have two of the biggest egos in the WWE in that ring and neither of them wants to job out in that big a match. Plus while every kid wants HBK to win, no one wants to see Undertaker lose his streak.|`|bc5EELGhaa	Undertaker will face <br>  JBL,HBK and Vladimir Kozlov|`|AA11234053	it would be more entertainig if he face HBK|`|ULSUqmeZaa	yup..HBK|`|DZQtBFXYaa	First, let me say I disagree with EVERYTHING Smackdown GM Vicki Guerrero says and does <with the exception> of what she said on Smackdown 2/20/09. Undertaker is on Smackdown and HBK & JBL are on Raw. Now in my opinion (and I've been saying this here on Yahoo Answers for about 2 months now) Undertaker should face Vladimer Koslov. He's undefeated in singles competition and even tho I don't like him - he would be the best choice to try to end Undertakers streak.|`|c1VbXxYGaa	I think John Cena should face him I think John Cena mite have a chance of beating him but i would rather have Takers streak to stay..|`|J5PLpdOuaa	I think Taker vs HBK Shawn Michaels vs JBL vs Vladimir Kozlov|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	I think it will be  three way match between UNdertaker, HBK, and JBL.|`|lGO7XlyBaa	HBK Shawn Michaels|`|voDpSabcaa	HBK|`|bE5fG9vDaa	i want hbk, but on smackdown (2/20_ vickie said it would be kozlov vs taker at wm 25.|`|j73UqP4Yaa	v k|`|GN7gZkVeaa	i think that the undertaker should face the great khali|`|PrpLmZoRaa	definitely HBK, because both Taker and HBK are from Texas|`|22f82d8d45e6cb20bd3007cf1b7900f2aa	If it is HBK and he wins I will be pretty mad. The Undertaker should continue his streak and HBK is an idiot now anyways.<br>  <br>  Orton, Edge and Santino rule
Dilobt5gaa	No, Lee and Granderson are better than Dye,Thome,And Gordon and you're already good at OF and 3B. BTW Granderson is Curtis Granderson.|`|7sI4TtEIaa	that trade sounds awful, don't do it.|`|faf42318f3fc2bbe429706ae27cc12a9aa	Why do the trade?<br>  <br>  1. Do the three players improve you in any way?<br>  2. Do their stats improve your situation?<br>  <br>  Thome and Dye are getting older and will contribute HR and some RBI's. I love Gordon, but you already have a great 3b.<br>  <br>  You are giving up a top 10 1b and top 15 OF for players that you probably find on the waiver wire later.<br>  <br>  Always be careful about the 3 for 1 or 2 for two trades. Do they make you better?
eR74jKbhaa	I think pretty much everybody who answered this question didn't watch the Celtics-Suns game today, including that MVP retard. Yeah, he is the best PG in the East. He can clearly score when he needs to (32 points today, sans-KG). He has the best assist, rebounding, and steals numbers out of every other PG in the East. He has absolutely owned Devin Harris (twice), Jose Calderon (twice), Chris Duhon, etc in head to head matchups.  <br>  Its funny how people say he's only good because he plays with the Big 3, and then when the best member of the Big 3 is injured, Rondo has one of the best games of his careers. It just goes to show that Rondo has the talent to have big games whenever he needs to, he just doesn't need to every game because of the guys he plays with. <br>  <br>  BTW, if you want answers on NBA stuff, don't go to yahoo answers. There are a bunch of dumbasses in here who answer NBA questions despite not knowing **** about basketball.|`|KMk4nuFeaa	He's good but, if you think about it, who wouldn't be a good point guard with the big 3 on your team? Im pretty sure that I could do wut he's doin if I had kg, ray ray, and pierce on my side! Lol|`|4xFUhMXOaa	Not yet. He's talented, but give him a year or 2 more, and he'll be one of the best points guards in the East, probably the NBA too.|`|zPYapfm5aa	Mo Williams is the best by far|`|wBq0ERSJaa	Your high|`|uHQmgV9oaa	"mvp" are you retarded? did you just say eddie house owns rondo??? wtf|`|l0iCqzlQaa	MVP are you retarted? eddie house( barley ever plays PG) and mike bibby over Rondo? okay buddy lay of the dope, also Gilbert Arenas over Rondo . i would rather have Rondo over Arenas who hasnt played in forever.|`|9UhoUcM2aa	I will nottttt admit that|`|YJIivf2Haa	Rondo is a good point guard who plays well within the system he is in and he has a lot of talent around him.  But he isn't the best point guard in the east. He can be one day but he isn't now.  I would say Rondo is an above average point guard but not the best. In my opinion the best point guards in the east are Mo Williams and Jameer Nelson.|`|4gJTpitraa	Not quite yet.<br>  <br>  He's amazing, and he seems to get better every single game. In a season or two, I think he will be the top point guard in the East (if Gilbert Arenas stays injured, which probably will happen...)|`|JpvXhgmraa	lol no. The best PG in the East? LMAO<br>  <br>  Devin Harris<br>  Derrick Rose<br>  Mike Bibby<br>  Calderon<br>  Arenas<br>  Eddie House<br>  <br>  all own Rondo|`|Fh0shlVLaa	No way in hell he is the best PG in the East.
UNUJNgHxaa	Let me start off by saying that I saw the race, I saw the slow motion replays. We all heard the drivers talk about it. Now that JR. admitted to his mistakes, that just show's the kind of driver he is. He is not out there to make people wreck on purpose. When cars driving at almost 200 mph and at close range.( bumper to bumper) "STUFF" happens. a little mistake turns in to a huge mistake real fast. The drivers have to be able to make judgment calls in less time it take to say the word "oh crap". As long as a driver can admit when they did something wrong and be willing to learn from it. Well I feel that is what makes them a good race driver. We all know that people make mistakes, we all know that sometimes the mistakes have grave consequences. This is the reason we all like to watch Nascar races. Dale JR. is still the most favorite driver. I don't think he is out there trying to kill people. He made a judgment that had a bad consequence to it. He took it like a man payed his price for it. Now on sunday we will get to see another great exciting race. I hope this answers your question.|`|x1fp1vESaa	well being at the daytona 500 i was listening to the scanner thing and listening to jr at that time so i don't think he really meant to start that big of a wreck i mean his spotters never told him to start that wreck and he even got his team mate jimmie johnson in it so i don't think he was too happy about that cause when i was listening in i heard him say that... "are my teammates alright"  but hey things like that happen in NASCAR all the time so today is just another race so move on and forget about that i think.|`|VxN4tnJtaa	I feel that it is great that he was willing to man up to it... I think most of the guys involved in the incident were upset and blunt to say the least but at least they weren't really rude and hateful about it.  I was more impressed by the way the guys handled themselves controlling tempers after the wreck than the fact that Jr. admitted fault.  JMO<br>  <br>  *Edit:  for "RichardW" that is what manning up means.|`|l4zWHv4Daa	He didn't admit to it.  Him a Brian talked about it and put it behind them during the week but he never admitted he was the cause of the accident. <br>  <br>  Try again.<br>  <br>  Brian Vickers just can't drive. Look at the race at Fontana. He had 75 a foot wide track with only 1 car around and he still wrecked trying to drive below a car that was running on the line. Vickers is an idiot  and may have believed Jr was admitting he did it. Now I'll believe that.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about the article on NASCAR.com then the author was trying to make it sound like Dale Jr was saying he could have caused it. But Dale Jr never admitted it. He said after the race that Brian Vickers wrecked him. It amazes me the extent people will go through to try to make Dale Jr look bad.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  He didn't even admit it on TV. What he said on TV was Vickers drove him below the line then Dale Jr did admit to getting into the back of Vickers on the way BACK ON THE TRACK which was Vickers fault he was down there to begin with. If Vickers had never blocked there would have been no wreck. Vickers even admitted he blocked. The idiot got wrecked. Dale Jr admitted his car made contact but he never admitted he "CAUSED THE WRECK".|`|FtxFrqalaa	I feel that this is a different week and I wish him better luck! What happened is already done!|`|ziVpIxQ9aa	nice to see someone man up.|`|JIvvg6f7aa	I think its about time now he just needs to admit he lacks any real talent and he will be on the level|`|mIdcJEJNaa	I don't care if he did it, or not..<br>  I don't think it's relevant anymore..<br>  That isn't "manning up", that's resolving the <br>  situation to allow the reconciliation process to begin.. lol<br>  If someone said that to Jr that way, his response would probably be<br>  Huh...|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	He manned up, he doesn't cause a lot of wrecks. I still say if it would have been BIffle & Vickers, or Burton and Vickers, we would not be talking about this all week, it was Dale Jr and it was like the dang world was coming to a end.  No driver has to walk on water like he does, I swear if he wins a race, he gets ripped, gets in a wreck he gets ripped.  So lets move on, please.. This was so last week. Its Fontana today.<br>  <br>  Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|zii6IWHoaa	All those Jr fans most fell real good after defending him and then he goes on TV and admits it was his fault and he used poor judgment<br>  <br>  <br>  Apparently Joe Dirt doesnt read NASCAR or just doesnt believe Jr coudl do anythinig wrong.<br>  <br>  Hey Joe, Do you work for NASCAR?|`|YIWKPXokaa	Not much<br>  <br>  Today is another day.  <br>  <br>  I want to wish the #14 and the #18 car the best.  I love those guys.|`|UAHjJpC0aa	you mean Vickers<br>  <br>  he tried to block a car that ALREADY had it's nose under him

PvIFahGjaa	You have to follow through all the way. Thats why its going up instead of straight. Also make sure you arnt releasing to late.|`|O3oqZsR3aa	sounds like you might have a rising fastball so 1) aim at a lower target. 2) grip the ball across the skinny part of the ball (where the space between the seam narrows). This will prevent the air from catching all four seams and the ball rising on you. 3) check your release point. have someone closely watch you while you throw and see where you are releasing the ball. Generally you want to release it out front and at about eye level to keep the accuracy max.|`|oMtPzJqoaa	Most answers here have been somewhat right so far, except for the rising fastball one (it's impossible until you hit 120 mph). <br>  <br>  However, you might have a problem most people don't notice. You might be dropping your elbow.<br>  When you throw your arm should always be at a 90 degree angle from your body (<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2301522_throw-side-arm-curve.html)." rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2301522_throw-si...</a> If your elbow should drop your arm will slow and your wrist will usually lay back. this will cause your throw to go high. <br>  also make sure that your wrist snap is in front of your head.|`|n2toGLaYaa	wait to release. make sure you're arm is going over more and farther before you let go of the ball. if it keeps hitting the ground, then you need to release earlier. <br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|lQYR7I9Taa	Wait to release the ball.  Don't wait to long to release, because then it will fall to the ground.|`|3mE3w1Toaa	when u release the ball release it a little later and throw alot to get better|`|MiWJ1QbSaa	think about getting your hand on top of the ball and always finish down

v7WLVxR5aa	Good Question, Let's see.<br>  <br>  Well back in 2005 when Kurt Angle was GM ( what a joke ) and he had that poll on WWE.com and who ever got the highest percentile of votes got a shot at the WWE title. John Cena won, BOOKER T came in second.<br>  <br>  If you remember JBL then showed a video of him on border patrol and Kurt Angle thought that was " Really American" so JBL went on to win the WWE Championship and hold it for the greatest months in WWE History.<br>  <br>  I think if Cena was never around BOOKER T would be the most popular wrestler, I think JBL and Booker T would of been a good long feud and Booker T could of gotta that WWE Title he deserved.<br>  <br>  I hate Cena, he can go make another shirt for all I care, it's all he's good for.|`|9mQC5Vihaa	That is THE question my friend, if answered all man kinds problems will recede and fade away.

pmjOiQFvaa	yeah i agree wwe is very low on TNA made talent vince has a motto which is he likes to make the starss himself not ready made stars. They mite just giv him a stupid stereotype gimmick it would be nice to see sonjay dutt and evan bourne lock horns would be a good match for ecw.|`|e19298ebe749b74cc076d9cc6ffa4b88aa	I agree with you.  I think WWE signs these guys with the intention of not using them just to get them off of TNA's roster.  The WWE roster is ridiculously long the way it is.  There is no way the effectively use that many people and not have some get lost along the way.  Am I wrong or didn't Chris Harris and Christoper Daniels sign with WWE?  Where are they?<br>  <br>  I also think Christian was an idiot for going back. He went from being a major part of a smaller organization that seemed to appreciate and use his talents (I didn't like him until he went to TNA) to going back to being a small part of a huge organization who will never use him to his full talent.  Obviously, he is only in it for the money, not the love of the industry as he claims.|`|U6tE9LhJaa	ECW would be good for him and WWE needs some culture|`|lGIL36faaa	its not even true man,y r u chatting $*** for..there is no way thats going 2 happen...|`|AA11528760	As a Singles competitor, there's a strong chance of Sonjay get buried in the WWE. In the past, WWE has never really made good use of TNA Original wrestlers (Chris Harris, Alpha Male, etc)<br>  <br>  But, putting Sonjay together with some established superstar will work well for his WWE debut & I see no better star than Khali, for him to be with. Sonjay can be alongside The Great Khali as his manager/tag team partner (instead of that exaggerating Ranjan Singh). IMO, it'll work well for him, atleast for WWE's Indian Market. The WWE has done a great job of promoting Khali in India, whereas TNA did very little to make Sonjay known to the Indian fans. Because of this Sonjay's Indian fan-base is really very small as compared to that of Khali. But, it is Sonjay's in-ring skills, his atheleticism that has earned him his Indian fan following.<br>  <br>  The WWE has recieved a lot of profit from their Indian Market with Khali's arrival in the WWE. The number of WWE fans in India have increased immensly. Now, we even get the WWE shows in the same week as in the USA. <br>  If the WWE do sign Sonjay Dutt & use him effectively, it'll really boost their ratings in India. And if given a chance, we know that Sonjay can prove himself very well.|`|xJ1qhXwVaa	There are different opinions, But i think he would be good on ECW. As you mentioned WWE would bury his talent, But with the lack of talent on ECW i don't think he has much to worry about. And i even see him doing decent on Smackdown, Either way if he has no chance of signing with TNA then there's a huge chance he will be on WWE.|`|1JywgkyMaa	i can imagine it now,wwe ruining him with some indian giimick,i know tna did,but you just know wwe would exaggerate it|`|Q1MI6L96aa	The remaking of ECW will continue and there will be plenty of talent from TNA on the market in the coming months....the contract renewals are for significant pay cuts and talent can't get out the door fast enough.|`|smcDn76jaa	You know if they are considering on signing him  Dutt would lengthen the list of cruiserweight in WWE. I think they might be considering bringing back the CW division on ECW.

kYBlgFQAaa	I didn't realize you were such a Rajon jocker.  Just kidding man.  It's true Nash can't play defense, but that is no secret.  Rondo has really stepped his game up this year, but with KG out he is being asked to look for his shot and score a little more.  With the 3 all stars on the team, his main duty has been to take care of the ball, play defense, and act as a facilitator.  It wasn't that he couldn't score, it just wasn't required.  It looks like he is right at home playing this high tempo, transition game.  His quickness is being put to great use.  Imagine the kind of nunbers he could put up playing for D'Antoni or Nellie.  <br>  <br>  BQ: Kentucky|`|jjzK1pOaaa	okay...he's a decent player...still too streaky...but keep this in mind...phoenix is not at all known for their defense...and he is getting to the hoop every time...if he was relying on jumpers...these numbers wouldn't be the same...|`|BfwzbKSoaa	He's owning this game up.

3cd675f8a0783955763670d5ea211808aa	As much as it hurts me to say this, it would have to be A-Rod. He has brought a lot of embarrassment and unwanted attention to the team. He is going to be a major distraction this year. It is a little unfair that he was the only player named out of 104, but he was still named and he is going to be a target all year long.<br>  <br>  He's a great player, but with A-Rod, the Yankees have gotten out of the first round of the playoffs only ONE time, and he is a major reason for it. When the Yankees won, they had Scott Brosius playing third. He wasn't a superstar, but he was a great TEAM player who did the little things. The Yankees could use that.|`|zyRueriwaa	i would love to say luis castillo but now he has given me some hope.  i dont really know i dont think that there is anyone in particular that i would really wan to get rid of on the mets(however that was not the case last year)but i would love to add some players, allah Manny. <br>  but i guess if i had to rid my team of one player it would be luis castillo. that way we would have pusrsued orlando hudson|`|m4geUBLTaa	i agree with Kei Igawa he's by far horrible, worst pitcher. i cannot stand this guy. i would say giambi but he's gone now too. so im pretty happy with the team now. but igawa has got to go. everytime he comes up from the minors he sucks. bad. i cant stand him haha<br>  ------<br>  how about you?|`|cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	No one on the Yankees yet.

I1w0HfQbaa	You are correct. The problem with these greats such as Greb we have to read and listen to the old-timers talk and brag about how great Greb really was instead of looking at the visual evidence for ourselves. The problem is, old-timer boxing writers like Jack Fiske have a tendency to talk about how great their generation's fighters are so great and tough and this generation of boxers are pansies and have it easy....blah, blah, blah. The best we can look for in Greb is hearsay and secondary sources.|`|3q8LkLLDaa	i think that if u knew much about boxing u would know that this position is occupied by the greatest Middleweight of all time named Laszlo Papp (to some greatest boxer period)<br>  go do some research son :)<br>  <br>  Greb was great tho NO DOUBT!<br>  definitely top 3 of all time<br>  <br>  edit<br>  <br>  from what u just added u proved my point!<br>  so like i said go do some research then come back ,apologize and i might forgive u:)

Some people say that he is better at the left wing but that is not true. Ronaldo is forced to play on the left when Ji-Sung Park (a winger) is playing and Ji-Sung's Park's left foot is worse than Ronaldo's left foot so SAF will simply put C Ronaldo on the left and Ji-Sung Park on the right. Ronaldo can also play as a centre forward but he is better on the right wing.|`|7x4VtGtFaa	That's easy:<br>  <br>  He plays on the left<br>  He plays on the right<br>  That boy RONALDO<br>  Makes Liverpool look shite|`|efGx6z3vaa	The 69 position with Sol campbell|`|svU3xeotaa	honestly all those positions are his best, he can cross using his left/right foot and hes the best goal scorer.|`|ab2c491e6bca420e2c45c21f91d16208aa	in front of the till at boots.|`|wurimjbnaa	Lol you lot are sad.|`|AA12324825	on the wing.he's best when he's taking ppl on|`|fe4de024b75923a09899e2e2db104cb3aa	On his back!

He did say he wants to come back though!|`|wNI6W8sdaa	There are a lot to choose from, but i would say that Guus Hiddink would be a good choice. since he probly wont stay, most likely it will be Frank Rijkaard. He seems to be the best choice compared to some of the other names going around.|`|6kkXEpMKaa	If Hiddink proved himself this year..he'll be good Choice next season,Don't Think Mourinho will ever come to Chelsea again (Although I hope) because he has serious issues with the owner|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	I want to start a petition to bring back Avram Grant.I missed his bulldog face and monotonous nature.|`|7x4VtGtFaa	Rafa Benitez!|`|nIbN4jb3aa	i definately thing gianfranco zola look what he did w/ west ham not bad at all 10 games w/out a loss and 1 of those games were against chelsea
wurimjbnaa	Only if he performs well in those positions then yes.|`|LdJFFvSVaa	Generally yes|`|EIsnATLxaa	Of course just look at Gerrard|`|Maja0Gzdaa	Dean Windass! ! ! :P|`|bNykcEVXaa	Yeah ...a really good one<br>  doesn't mean he'll be any good in them though ...lol<br>  <br>  <br>  dR bad|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Not always. It depends on the players size and speed as well as ability|`|FFE9Qztzaa	If I can do it, then i'm sure they can ;)|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	I must be a pretty good one then,lol.<br>  <br>  A good footballer might be able to adapt to most positions and do an effective job.I personally hate it when I'm played out of position,because I have to fight my natural tendency to attack when I'm supposed to sit back and defend.I'm pretty sure most footballers feel the same way,only they're doing it "for the team".|`|7x4VtGtFaa	I remember John O'Shea playing in assorment of positions:<br>  Striker, Centre Mid, Left Back, Right Back, Centre Back, Goalkeeper.<br>  <br>  And the good news, he made Liverpool miserable by scoring the winning goals.|`|efGx6z3vaa	look at me, I can play Right back, defensive midfield, Center Back Forward and can be used as a goalkeeper in my school team|`|HkqiGEMuaa	Y U P ! !|`|nwwhfuADaa	it depends which those positions are
fmUGHvgHaa	u mean the game svr09...yes u can....when your opponent is down u press the triangle and left arrow at the same time...|`|3nN1vTTuaa	ya, you just need to have the move, and you can get to kickin.<br>  <br>  <br>  my punt senses are tingling.|`|1JywgkyMaa	yea,the ironic part is,i've punted both kane and undertaker in two different inferno matches|`|Df64c82Yaa	Hell yeah.
gAftPN59aa	Definenlty i would actually say it would be almost too big i have a 13 but i use it when i play outfield and when i pitch i use my friends 10.5 primo i wish i pitched more often to say the least|`|2N6oTOLQaa	That sounds about right. For SS you might want to go even a little smaller, but for 3rd you might want to go up just a little. 11.25 is a good in between size that will work fairly well at both positions.|`|O3oqZsR3aa	Eh, you should be good. I would have to say get a 11.5 because at the hot corner you'll need something somewhat large to knock down all of those liners you will get. Generally for an infielder 11.5 is a good size.|`|0L7nSkaqaa	No way. In the infield, you want a smaller glove so you can find the ball easily and make a quick transfer and throw. The infield is probably the only place where you want a small glove, but, hey, that's the way it works.|`|5CLx01G1aa	No, you usually want a bigger size glove for the outfield.|`|vuh0i3Axaa	whether you play infield or outfield...<br>  <br>  you don't want a glove smaller than 12 inches...|`|FkCGr335aa	Actually I believe it's not too small. I have an 11 inch Gold Glove the GGP217-2 which fits me fine. Also I have two 11.25 inch Gold Gloves, the GGNP2B and GGPNP3-2 and they fit me fine and will probably for years to come so I think it should fit you fine.
bNykcEVXaa	Looking forward to this one...<br>  <br>  <br>  dR bad<br>  can't be bothered to research it myself though... but can't wait ?|`|efGx6z3vaa	Check Wikipedia, or research your self, don`t trust evrything you see in this section
YYqrT4jBaa	When you shoot a paintball gun, CO2 has to expand to a gas because it's a liquid in your tank. The reaction of liquid CO2 and the atmosphere is endothermic which means it takes in heat.

sLVGdCOTaa	Who are these people answering saying he hasn't fought anyone? Do you watch UFC, EVER? If you don't think Bonnar, Franklin, Sokoudjou-(OK not a superstar but not a gimme either) Ortiz, and that beating he put on a previously undefeated Silva aren't above average guys than you need to check out mmaroot.com, mmashare.com, mmascraps.com, cagepotato.com, and affliction.com for starters to get up to speed on the last ten years of fights, Machida will be a stud for years, He fights an awkward style and is very good at it, I think he would beat Evans without much trouble-no offense to Rashad. He among the other 9-10 light heavyweights make that division easily the deepest.|`|nRBC4E5saa	He's got some skill, but hasn't yet beaten a contender.  Tito was hardly relevant to the title scene when they fought, Sokoudjou was still a relative unknown, Silva hadn't fought any bit names, and Franklin was years ago and hasn't really made his mark at 205.<br>  <br>  With that said I think he's got the skills to take the title whenever he wants.  I wouldn't have a problem with him getting the next title shot, but if he doesn't, it'll be hard to say no to him after another win, no matter who it's against.  Two or three really good fighters has to equal one contender, right?|`|KzpZBMVOaa	Sure he does, but Rashad would tear him in half. Lyoto in all fairness needs one more fight before the title shot.<br>  <br>  edit- remember Rashad is undefeated too, I think.|`|5TIX6PH3aa	I personally don't think he does.  Machida is skilled but has only beat 1 top 10 fighter (Sokoudjou).  I think a fighter has to beat some contenders before he earns the title shot.<br>  <br>  Right now Rampage definitely deserves the shot 1st.  He had a controversial loss to Forrest to lose the belt and has KO'ed Wanderlei and basically knocked him right out of the LHW division (he dropping to MW).  If Rampage beats Jardine, that would mean he beat 2 top 10 ranked opponents since losing his belt - which is more than Machida has beat in his career.|`|3WzvuPB4aa	From what I've heard, Lyoto is getting the next Title shot so long as Keith Jardine does what he does best and pulls off the upset and beats "Rampage".  If Jackson wins, he gets the next shot, with Lyoto getting the next one after.<br>  <br>  One thing I know for sure, though, is that Rashad better hope and pray that Jackson beats Jardine.  I think Rashad has what it takes to beat "Rampage".  I think Lyoto smokes Rashad, though.  <br>  <br>  Overall, though, I think a Title shot for Lyoto Machida is long overdue.|`|d94kkVLwaa	He defeated two of the most popular UFC champions: Tito Ortiz and Rich Franklin (by KO this last one). He also KO Thiago Silva for the first time  (who was undefeated 13-0-0 with 10 KO's), and in the first round.<br>  <br>  Of course he deserves the title shot. And if he get's it, he will win most probably. This boy is becoming better and better each time he fights.|`|01cIxqiAaa	I'm 50-50, I think he does by default. I would like to see him fight one top guy just to cement it, but if he does then we can see how good he is against a tough opponent. But again, I would like to see him fight a top guy first, but if he doesn't and he gets the shot after Rampage, I'm fine with that too.|`|E563RzW2aa	He has beaten some big names, but they've all been pretty much out of their prime or not at their best.  One might argue Franklin was, but he hasn't made much of a mark at 205, although still a low-top contender.  <br>  <br>  Regardless though, going 14-0 is tough and I do think he deserves a title shot after Rampage, that is if Rampage wins at UFC 96.|`|CdAE4nXcaa	HE DESERVES A TITLE SHOT FOR SURE. HE'S DESTROYED EVERYONE HE'S FACED HE'S LIKE THE ANDERSON SILVA OF THE LIGHT HEAVY WEIGHT DIVISION BUT HE KEEPS GETTING TOSSED ASIDE FOR BIGGER NAMES. HE DESERVES TO KICK RASHAD'S ***, AND BECOME THE CHAMPION|`|36u3Ml0kaa	He deserves it and should get it but I think he will need to win one more fight first.|`|AA11517536	Hell yeah, he deserves a title shot.
0qu36suxaa	Rest assured that this is not a problem that only beginners have.<br>  Even golf professionals will feel nervous when hitting important shots, it's how they handle those nerves that makes the difference.<br>  <br>  By and large all good golfers will have what they call a "pre-shot routine".<br>  A pre-shot routine is simple, repeatable system of mental and physical preparation that each golfer will go through prior to hitting a shot.  The simpler the better as it will hold up best under pressure and will not result in slow play.<br>  <br>  Key elements are:<br>  - the trigger/cue.  This can be a simple gesture like shrugging your shoulders or putting your hand on top of the club you're about to hit.  This signifies the beginning of your preshot routine and once you've done this, you're kinda stepping into a bubble where nothing exists but you, the ball and the club<br>  <br>  - mental preparation/visualisation & practice swings<br>  all good golfers will visualise the shot.  They will see it in their minds eye, flying to the target, they will visualise and feel the swing necessary to produce this shot.  The number of practice swings you take is not important, what is important is feeling that the last one you make is the right one.<br>  <br>  - pick target and set-up to ball<br>  you need to pick a specific target.  The brain responds better to small targets, so don't just aim "at the fairway", pick a specific tree on the skyline or even better a branch on that tree and set-up square to the target<br>  <br>  - take one last look at the target and then repeat the practice swing you made.  Try not delay too long between your last look at the target and beginning your swing.  The longer you stand over the ball, the less likely you are to make a smooth takeaway.  Think only of your target and try to avoid thinking about any mechanical aspects of the swing ie. make sure I keep my left arm straight, keep your head down etc.<br>  <br>  Hope this is helpful.  If you are interested in the mental side of sports performance, particularly regarding golf, check out Golf is not a game of perfect by Bob Rotella.  It's an old book, but it's timeless.<br>  <br>  As with all sports, no books or advice/tips can replace quality teaching from a reputable PGA professional|`|Au1BaZqPaa	Just remember that it is simply a game and that you are out there to have fun just like they are. Then when you are about to hit focus on the ball. You should be starting straight down at it as you are hitting. Try keeping your eye on the location the ball is/was sitting the entire time.<br>  <br>  Check out the site in my source if you sign up you get free lessons.|`|VktsT8Dwaa	The best thing is to find one swing thought - my thought on the first tee is to take a full relaxed swing.  <br>  <br>  Don't place too many expectations on yourself, tension will only make things worse - stay relaxed and have fun!|`|AYkEwqRXaa	You're focused on the wrong thing.  Focus on the shot.  Don't focus on who's watching you.  Focus on the kind of shot you want to hit.  You'll start to do it more as you play more.|`|VIhNt19taa	go back to your fundamentals<br>  make an effort to watch the ball so that you dont lift your head<br>  and take a good rip at it to make yourslef look good :p<br>  ....ok maybe not the last part, unless you want to that is.

yk4S7uuraa	There is a pssoibility that he may be ready by the end of August, but there's no telling how effective he can be.|`|lBhkWpDoaa	Yes, thats why they picked up K-Rod|`|lQYR7I9Taa	He is out for the season.  He is probably also finished with the Mets now that they have Krod.|`|ST5oxGpOaa	yes he is|`|WPH6O73gaa	yep
lBhkWpDoaa	The Wizard<br>  <br>  LMFAO @ who ever said Honus......i dont even consider that real Baseball back in those days<br>  <br>  "Whites only" Baseball in Wagner years was a joke<br>  <br>  Real Baseball started after 1947<br>  <br>  Babe was for sure ahead of his times but his numbers would not have been so inflated if Latino and Black players were "allowed" to play against him. just my opinion|`|xIfvXy4waa	These are all opinions, there isn't just one set in stone. If I had to choose, I would give it to Ozzie Smith.|`|qivUrJ3Naa	Whoever said Jeter and Tony Fernandez is an idiot.  I would say Wagner just ahead of Banks.  Ozzie was a great fielder and Cal Ripken Jr. was a great hitter.  Fernandez ha ha not even in the top 25.|`|2wgEsVmsaa	I won't say for sure, but Jeter and Tony Fernandez deserve a look. All I will say for sure it that if we were counting on fielding ONLY, Ozzie Smith would deserve a look. But since a shortstop carries a stick, too, then he isn't even in the top 10. Yount and Ripken were contemporaries who challenged him with a club and passed him standing still with the all-round play.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Wagner, and if you don't know why, you should.<br>  <br>  If there was an MVP award in his era, he'd have won four or six.|`|FSDjC3Uyaa	Honus Wagner in the dead ball era and Ernie Banks in modern times.|`|AVeKMM5Taa	The Wizzard<br>  Ozzie Smith|`|FkCGr335aa	Well many people go by the team their a fan of and you'll probably think I do too. I'm a Yankee fan and I think Jeter is a great role model and all around player. Many might say Jose Reyes but hey all he has is speed and an arm. Now Reyes has a little advantage but when Jeter was in his prime Jeter would smoke anyone of today's baseball. He does a little bit of everything so well. That's today but back in the day there were many insane Shortstops. Phil Rizzuto, Tony Lazzeri, Ozzie Smith, and Honus Wagner.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	Honus Wagner is considered the best of all time.  Over 300 hits, Career .327 BA, Over 700 SB's, over 1700 RBI's.  Never saw him play.  Cal Ripken is the best I ever saw play.  He changed the way the position was looked and played.|`|joJhbkX4aa	The position of shortstop is based alot more on fielding than hitting so in this case its Ozzie Smith and after him is Omar Vizquel.|`|aEwd0f5Waa	Honus Wagner<br>  <br>  EDIT: Lol, then what did they play, pretend baseball?<br>  <br>  So I guess Babe Ruth wasn't one the the best players ever?|`|AA11865915	Even though he played more seasons at 1st than at SS, I'd have to give it to Ernie Banks. He was as great with the stick as he was with the leather.|`|AA11720887	Ozzie was the slickest fielder but his hitting won't give him your answer. Cal Ripken absolutely was the best.|`|WeEjc79Uaa	Id have to say ozzie smith, the wizard.

tzrLDbHWaa	You can go straight out of high school.  The D-League requirement is 18, whereas the NBA requirement is 19 and 1 year out of high school.  The thing is that if you really want to play in the NBA, you're much better off going to college than trying to make it to the NBA via D-League in most cases.
0Dm3WEMcaa	Because in the overview it will always be predictable just like Ric Flair losing last year was, the difference is how the match is worked. We all get into the matches when they are done well with a lot of close near falls that have you genuinely believing "how the hell did he kick out of that?!" that's what they mean, they want moments in the match which are so close for the few seconds of the count your thinking "holy @#$% the streak is about to end!!!" The outcome can be as predictable as anything we have ever seen but it's how they get to it that matters.|`|JiCfYfLraa	i agree because come on its gonna be so predictable 17 and 0 at wrestlemania??? the wwe needs to make undertaker lose his streak because its getting boring now.<br>  <br>  i respect undertaker and all but come on that streak needs to go its so predictable.|`|gVlTlpb2aa	taker will never lose the streak|`|T13xM9iJaa	I feel the same way you do If he lost to someone I would want it to be hbk|`|oAjbBLDpaa	What does HBK gain from Undertaker losing to him at Wrestlemania?<br>  Shawn Michaels is a well decorated superstar that has left his mark all over WWE especially with the fans. The Undertaker is over with the fans quite well but he didn't leave much except for the Streak. He has done so much for the company backstage as a locker room leader but he hasn't received anything on screen for it. Undertaker's character would die without anything left to remember him by. The Streak should continue because it is the last legacy of the greatest asset of WWE history.<br>  No one should take a legacy away from someone. Should Ric Flair not be remembered for his 16 Championship reigns that displayed his amazing ability? Undertaker's legacy couldn't be championships, instead he was given an honor as the only man to be Undefeated at Wrestlemania for 16 years.|`|1JywgkyMaa	i would be kind of mad if the streak ends,but it will still be a good match. most people these days only care that taker won and is still undefeated rather than focusing on what a good match it was,like his match with batista,all the fans could talk about was that taker was the champ and 15-0|`|47ddda29b6896ce72acab50c6bef43fdaa	Undertaker is going to win again this year, and like always, he'll make it a long and exciting matchup. Personally I'll probably stop watching WWE when the Undertaker retires.|`|S7GqsRWDaa	I completely agree!  I mean I have total respect for The Undertaker but wouldn't that be awesome if his streak did end?  That would be the most shocking moment in WWE history probably.|`|pZJPz6CGaa	Undertaker is Overated, Boring and an old man that needs to be put in retirement. Dont worry, HBK will destroy his miscery.|`|TzCu3igraa	yeah, it will bring back the unpredictability to WM|`|MFGouPgoaa	If it was John Cena I would cry|`|U6tE9LhJaa	I agree wit the first post|`|qbEeecndaa	i agree with you 100%|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	I think the Undertaker will stay unbeating!
VlsaWHebaa	Well they need to show matches because Wrestlemania is in like 2-3 months so they need to show a couple of matches involving them to build up some drama and make a good promo. Besides we all know it's going to be Taker vs HBK, (HBK lose to JBL?? Seriously?). And Vladimir is a boring wrestle so he can be stuck in a match with JBL. lol.|`|OpCYOra3aa	i know<br>  but this is gonna happen<br>  vickey will announce that koslave will face taker on smackdown this week.<br>  and koslave will beat taker with a clean victory <br>  trust me this will happen<br>  <br>  <br>  but at mania i am thinkin it will be hbk vs taker becuase taker and koslave have already faced off at smackdown and koslave beat taker<br>  so this week on smackdown it will be koslave vs taker and koslave will win with a clean victory<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  but it will be HBK Vs UNDERTAKER AT MANIA|`|47ddda29b6896ce72acab50c6bef43fdaa	It's going to be HBK vs. The Deadman. It's in the script. Also proposed are John Cena vs. Hulk Hogan and Chris Jericho vs. Mickey Rourke (if that doesn't happen, Y2J will have to go against former Hall of Famers)|`|1JywgkyMaa	its because half the wrestlers in wwe today suck,with a few exeptions|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Relax, it's going to be one on one at Wrestlemania with Shawn Michaels and the Undertaker and perhaps a guest referee but I doubt it.<br>  <br>  The WWE probably can't develop a good storyline so they decided to tease us with the possibility of JBL or Kozlov but I guarantee Shawn Michaels will finally meet the Undertaker at Wrestlemania.
AA10263761	Nate by far<br>  Marquis daniels is a pothead|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Honestly, speaking as a die hard Knicks fan. I would go w/ Marquis Daniels. I have been trying to see ways the Knicks can get him while in the meantime still resign Lee. The way is let go of Nate this summer and work in Curry's contract and trade him upfront for Daniels and Diener. It could work out, but I do not know if the Pacers would even touch Curry's contract.<br>  <br>  My reason for stating Marquis > Nate is because w/ Nate you know what you are going to get points & athleticism. He can not pass, rebound, or defend to save his life and his size plays into all of that. He does not know whether he is a PG and SG and can play SG w/ minor errors and can not play PG as he gets major errors. He forces the action cause he does not have high basketball IQ and he acts immature and showoffish at times, which shows he does not seem to want to improve his play.<br>  <br>  Daniels can play SG and PG and does not make much mistakes. He can score w/o making mistakes or @ a low %, like Nate. He is also a versatile defender and can rebound and is athletic as well. The Mavericks have really missed this versatility as it was from when they traded him they were never in the Finals talks again.<br>  <br>  Nate did have 3 straight 30 point games this month. But, he shot 15% from the field for a whole month and a half this season too. He is very inconsistent. Daniels is a very good all-around player and the better bench spark plug. But, the best bench spark plug is Manu and then Barbosa and Maggette.|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	nate robinson he is doing pretty good this season if you ask me|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Kryptonate, though I think he should start.|`|ZdNSSm0waa	I would say Nate|`|fZ38PPgSaa	Nate|`|WU9q4wNXaa	Neither!<br>  The best is obviously Manu Ginobili.<br>  But if i had to pick either Daniels or Nate, I'd choose Nate over Daniels anyday!<br>  Nate is starting to show that he's a force to be reckoned with. I believe he had either three or four straight games with 30+ points earlier this year. Anyone who can do that (especially with the Knicks) is a beast!|`|bgiPoiLDaa	DefiNATEly, Robinson. He can handle and dish the rock way better than Daniels. Also, Nate has much better range and finishing ability as he showed when he dunked over Dwight Howard haha.
1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	The only time I can remember is during a tournament for the vacant WCW World Title Bret forced Sting to submit to the Sharpshooter.  Sometime in 1999, if I remember right, on a PPV who's name I can't recall.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I remember the name of the PPV.  It was called WCW Mayhem, held late in 1999.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	0<br>  Zero
NXktxy8jaa	Andre The Giant<br>  El Medico Asesino<br>  Bret Hart<br>  Eddie Guerrero RIP
WifhQyD4aa	I feel relieved when we don't get any injuries or reports.|`|7Ek9YkUhaa	West Coast do terribly in preseason games, that is known to all and probably have the worst record,  but are one of, if not the most successful team in the AFL, since the AFL was founded in 1990, they have won 3 premierships, played in 5 grand finals, made the finals 16 out of 19 years, have never won the spoon and have produced 2 brownlow medalists. Then look at like Carlton who have gone pretty far in nab games in recent years but also collected 3 spoons in that time. So it does not bother me one bit, if they underperformed in a preseason match.|`|4wRyTY9Raa	No, it's better to win than lose in these practice matches, winning is a good habit to get into.|`|YcvKwRqiaa	Not at all.<br>  What a strange question. Why would you feel relief if your team lost?<br>  Hang on a minute... You went to the TAB and best against them didn't you?|`|jpI3EfGpaa	Well I don't know about feeling relieved.  My feeling is mainly "couldn't care less" as I think this competition is just a bit of a practice and some teams (like the Swans it seems who under Paul Roos have never won one of these preseason matches) seem to take it with a grain of salt and leave out some of the good players or pretend they have slight injury problems as the main season is a long one and that is when it is important to really try and put your best team forward.  Mind you I thought Port Adelaide looked very good yesterday and very fast - They were awesome and it sort of looked like the Swans were trying??? and if they were then I would have big concerns about them.|`|NMDUPd8paa	NO|`|mXFOru11aa	no becuase i always wonder if that was our best|`|2s244jGgaa	Im so used to the eagles loosing it doesnt affect me.
3nN1vTTuaa	I don't know, that match last year was just about perfect.|`|mDuiiVN7aa	I do not think so. HBK and TAKER are THE household names in the wrestling business. They both are the hardest working superstars in the wwe and future hall of famers, no doubt about that. HBK is a real threat for TAKER in that ring, HBK has much more heart  for the wrestling business then Edge will ever have in his entire life. HBK vs. TAKER should be one epic encounter that you could not  miss!|`|NXktxy8jaa	Tough, But I Don't Think It Will. Don't Get Me Wrong, The Match Was Great, But The Fact That Shawn Michaels And The Undertaker Are Both From Texas, And Wrestlemania Is Going To Be In Texas, And It's The 25th Anniversary Of 'Mania, So They Have To Make It Good. Last Years Match Between Edge And 'Taker Was A Good Fight, And Edge Proved To Be A Worthy Opponent, But It Was A Little Too Predictable. So This Years Match At 'Mania Should Turn Out Better.
PsGNDuJ8aa	Edge|`|v7WLVxR5aa	Orton, he was in a choke slam and reversed it to a RKO. Even through we all new the Undertaker was going to win, Orton made the match exciting.|`|1JywgkyMaa	randy orton,he got an rko,his dad's cast,and a lot of other close calls|`|RgCxHYUDaa	Edge|`|gVlTlpb2aa	edge because he had help|`|T13xM9iJaa	That a hard one but Orton had taker twice|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	Orton.

VkFDAQ46aa	I think it is very possible that he could. he is the Legend killer. and if the streak isnt broken soon i think that orton will be the one to end it sooner or later.|`|4cd000d6f79b5642fde7df2f56049e31aa	taker is gonna win this year and retire undefeated|`|TzCu3igraa	yer, i think so, randy has been on a roll for about 18 months now.|`|qbEeecndaa	no way|`|hkza2dKjaa	It might be possible. Randy has that move he did to Shane and Vince and he might do it to the Undertaker if they do wrestle each other. He can even take him out like he did to Vince.|`|c1VbXxYGaa	No Randy couldn't if he couldn't be for I doubt he would be able to this time.|`|bc5EELGhaa	obviously|`|x4CDslrDaa	noo|`|NXktxy8jaa	I could see him winning, but I doubt that the WWE would ever do that. If it was a regular fight, Undertaker would win, but Orton would put up a good fight.|`|zprMdpxZaa	well idk it is up to the director or who ever is in charge becasue wrestiling is fake...
NXktxy8jaa	Both would be nice, and Edge & Orton are both some of my favorites, but I would honestly say Edge beating Cena would be better. They can't just give John Cena the title back AGAIN when he doesn't deserve it. Edge has proved to be the better superstar because he can draw attention and heat towards himself which is good.|`|T13xM9iJaa	I think that Orton is going to walk out of Maina champion|`|VkFDAQ46aa	both will be victorious.|`|PsGNDuJ8aa	I would like 2 see Orton beat HHH which i think will happen and also that cena will beat edge.|`|5j81EoVXaa	orton|`|TzCu3igraa	i wanna see both win, but edge has had titles for a while, so i'm gonna go with orton|`|1JywgkyMaa	orton,i wanna see him beat hhh for the title and humiliate him again|`|bc5EELGhaa	both will win
YN93QRdyaa	People in the States have always just seen UFC as being MMA. To the casual fan, PRIDE never meant anything. If they had bought the UFC (which obviously would never have happened since the UFC haven't bankrupted themselves, and PRIDE couldn't afford to run themselves let alone buy out someone else) they would most likely have kept the same branding, since it was known to American audiences. UFC dropped the PRIDE name because it doesn't need it, the UFC is much better known in Japan than PRIDE ever was in the States. <br>  <br>  As for what else might change, I can't see too much. The rules are set by the Athletic Commissions so head stomps and what not wouldn't happen. Probably most of the freakshow fights wouldn't happen in the States for the same reason. Questions would still be asked about why so many PRIDE fighters look horrible and out of shape in the US (hint: they do drug tests in the States). Hopefully the PRIDE habit of letting their champions not bother to defend their belts wouldn't transfer over.<br>  <br>  Basically PRIDE would have had two options, keep the UFC as a seperate promotion (like UFC and WEC) or run more PRIDE shows in the states to cover the UFC's schedule. Which would raise interesting questions. Would PRIDE have kept using American rules for US shows and their own rules in Japan? Would they move the Grand Prix's to the States? Who knows? MMA in Japan is slumping though, whereas it keeps getting bigger and bigger in the States, and generally the popular fighters in the States are already in the UFC or have been recently. Unfortunately, the likes of Takanori Gomi doesn't mean anything to an average American audience. So if PRIDE wanted to run more PRIDE shows in the states they would need those the UFC 'stars'.<br>  <br>  Even if it was the PRIDE brand that people saw, they'd still just view it as they do the UFC just with a new name and a Japanese flavour. Ultimately it's still two guys kicking lumps out of each other. Actually, something like Fedor vs. Zuluzinho isn't going to make MMA look good to the average viewer at all. Frankly, given that PRIDE couldn't run themselves and their alleged connections to some rather dubious elements of Japanese society, I'd rather MMA be represented by the UFC all told.|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	I think the most obvious change might be they would be fighting in a regular ring as opposed to the octagon.  Besides this you would probably see a wider variety of fighters from different organizations and less control exercised over their contracts of who they fight for along with fighting under Pride.  As for the rules the state athletic commissions set those and they would be the same as what they are now no matter if it was Pride or the UFC here in the States.  I do think you would also see more fighters from Australia and Asia making their marks here in the states as well.|`|E563RzW2aa	I disagree with the "n00bs view of MMA".  There are a lot of people who don't watch it because they say it always goes to the ground and it's "boring" or it's "gay" because they're hugging each other up and rubbing their nuts on one another.  I admit, there are some boring times on the ground, but it's usually because most people don't understand the skill it takes to be a wrestler.  <br>  <br>  If PRIDE bought out UFC, it would probably be called mma.  PRIDE doesn't have the same ring to it like UFC.  However, I think it would probably be a lot flashier.  Everyone would be like Akihiro Gono (not to his degree, but you know what I mean).|`|sLVGdCOTaa	I loved Pride and was very disappointed when Dana "egomaniac" White closed it down, they had better fights overall I thought, The catchweight fights that pride had would be great in the UFC, Imagine if Anderson Silva actually fought some good light heavyweights (not the guy ranked 26th The Sandman) or if Rampage would gain a few pounds and fight Fedor, Or maybe keeping pride alive would of created two "major"  leagues that would of had super cards every month (with all the fighters available it would of been great) The popularity would be greater than today, Pride was the other half of the worlds MMA, and this half has UFC, now the other half has Dream and thats it.|`|M0qoqvJbaa	MMA as a whole would be dwindling, nearly dead.  Fighter pay would be in the toilet compared to where it is now, and they'd not be as widely known, which would mean many of them would likely not be able to train full time and the quality of the fights would suffer as a result.<br>  <br>  It's easy to criticize the UFC because Dana White and the Fertitas have a lot of faults, but even your question betrays that MMA is where it's at today because of spearheading efforts made under the UFC brand name.<br>  <br>  At the rate other organizations are springing up and even the rate those upstarts are collapsing at, you can't think the sport as a whole would be any better without the UFC around.|`|DsF05nHZaa	I was kinda bummed when PRIDE was bought out.<br>  <br>  What I miss most:<br>  The stomps to the head <br>  The kicking/kneeing of a downed opponent <br>  The spikes (when fighters landed on their head)<br>  <br>  None which are allowed in UFC|`|nRBC4E5saa	I don't think the Japanese would have understood the US market any more than Dana & co. understand the Japanese market.  There might have been a few UFC shows under the new ownership (DSE, right?), but I think the production would have been changed.  The US public seems less receptive to big productions in MMA fights, like music, rappers, huge entrances, etc.  Such attempts by Affliction, Elite XC, and the K-1 show that occurred in the US have been pretty universally panned because it's unnecessary and over the top.  US fans don't seem into that pro-wrestling type of quality in their MMA shows.  I think due to the uncertainty of things, "The Ultimate Fighter" would not have been renewed, which would have limited the exposure of MMA.  The show itself would be considered a "failed experiment".  Eventually the UFC as a unit would cease to exist.  Some fighters would be lucky enough to get a Pride contract.  Meanwhile, in the US, other upstart companies like Strikeforce and the IFL would have been given an opportunity to shine.  However, given the financial mismanagement of a lot of the newer shows, I doubt any of them would have gotten to the level that the UFC has.<br>  <br>  People were calling every MMA event they saw "Ultimate Fighting" since the 1990s.  I doubt a Pride buy-out would have changed that.

bQqkdPL9aa	hahaha i had him but i traded him for joe johnson =)|`|UMVWQiYJaa	yup, right when he was startin to get hot. thats some bullsht, i had to pick up ryan gomes.
bQqkdPL9aa	As long as Bosh is there Bargnani isn't going to improve dramatically. They pretty much do the same thing but bosh is obviously gonna take more of the shots. maybe in 2011 he'll average 19 ppg 8 rpg|`|wuDplG1qaa	Not with that shooting percentage.

DfPyyDssaa	Yes,legally,Vince McMahon can run for President.<br>  <br>  Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets the principal qualifications to be eligible for election as President. A Presidential candidate must:<br>  <br>  1.Be a natural born citizen of the United States; <br>  2.Be at least thirty-five years old; <br>  3.Have been a permanent resident in the United States for at least fourteen years.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	no maybe shane...but it will be cool..|`|3nN1vTTuaa	Just what we need another person buying their job, he could, but he would be terrible. Plus WWE is a stereotype, they think everyone who watches or is in the wwe, is a stupid redneck. He would not win, nor would i vote for him.|`|mDuiiVN7aa	He could be if there are enough people out there to vote for him.

KmMRHKTNaa	1.Obviously use ur head, ones shorter and ones longer. 6yd is the goalies are and where he has to kick it from. 18yd line is inside the pk area.<br>  2.Thats good defending, the forward should try to outrun him in opposite direction then chip it over. its only a foul if the defender is holding the forward's jersey for a long period of time and draggin him down.|`|BSqDYs1eaa	the 6 yard line is just to tell keepers where to take goal kicks from it has no other purpose. The 18 yard line is where the penalty box ends and if a foul occurs in the box there is a penalty given; And the defender blocks the attacker to stop him getting the ball so it will run out for a goal kick to the defenders team the referee does nothing because it is not really a foul because the defender is just using his strength <br>  hope this helps develop your understanding of soccer|`|arjadO5daa	1 - The 6 yard line is there just for goal keepers to take their goal kicks, and the 18 yard line is for where the goal keeper can hold the ball, they cant go past it, otherwise its a free-kick inside the 18-yard box.<br>  <br>  2- It is ok, they are just stopping them getting to the ball, and there is no rule saying players cant do that, so it is perfectly Soccer Legal!|`|KyGhcrzLaa	i can only answer the first question, i dont understand the second<br>  <br>  the six yard line in where you kick the goal kicks off of<br>  the eighteenth yard line is where the goalie can hold the ball and also if there is a penalty in there you get a penalty kick

YDpT2ClBaa	as pugpaws2 said you are better off buying a cheap one. it will cost you more in the end to make one.<br>  <br>  www.awma.com|`|r5AMG8g7aa	It is called a Bokken. They can be bought so cheaply that unless you just want to make one, it would be much less trouble just to buy one. A cheap one can be had for $8 to $15.00. There are also really expensive ones that you can easily pay $100 to $200 for.  The cheap ones are usually strong enough for most people. They don't break easily.

3yqZnu9Vaa	if your going to get into some jumping it really depends on what you like ex. natural hits, or park jumps. The brand of snowboard i would suggest is either ride or Nitro, they are very well made boards and most of them are relatively light. Look for boards geared more towards freestyle and stay away from directional shape boards as they do not work well riding switch. Board suggestions: Nitro: team 159, Nitro misfit wide, Ride: Antic 158, Prophet 162, these should get you started, and in the mid range price but very well made again. Boots are the most important in riding, i really like thirty two, either the lashed or the prospect boot, and also nitro, look at the anthem or team boots. they are very light weight and help with jumping. As for bindings i like raiden and ride look for any mid level binding such as the ride rx binding or the raiden bolt. These are very sturdy and will hlep support you in and keep you upright on rough landings at first. All Companies make good clothing, just stay more with the major brands, and DO NOT get any clothing that is rated under 10,000 in water proofing  or breathe ability. I really like holden and Ride. For goggles look for anything that has a mirrored lens it will help out in the day and a lens that is not dark so that you can wear them at night. A Helmet is essential even though most people don't wear them, they help a lot especially when trying something new, one wrong hit on the head and you wont be able to snowboard or anything possibly for the rest of your life. Look at Red, and giro, they make the lightest helmets i know of. Gloves are also important and i like any that are warm and still allow me to use my hands so i usually go with either celtek or grenade. these are a little expensive though and any other also work, especially dakine and defcon. Hope this helps, oh and for starting jumps keep your board straight and level it helps with the landing.|`|rbtO73eZaa	burton everything|`|YNVevUBuaa	Start off with getting the clothes.  You need long underwear, a warmth layer and then a good jacket and pants.  Outerwear is rated for waterproofness by mm.  10,000mm is great, 5,000 would probably do you just fine though.  <br>  <br>  It's important that you have warm waterproof gloves.  I'd recommend a neck gaiter (tube of fleece or some other synthetic material) that you can wear around your neck and pull over your face for warmth.  A hat and goggles are good too.<br>  <br>  For your first trips up the hill rent your gear.  There's no point in putting money into equipment to learn on.  When you've got your turns down then consider buying a board and bindings and boots.

They wouldn't put up an extra 2 mill. to match what NY offered him, but i guess is also the publicity in NY that had a factor in his decision.|`|iHYf76jHaa	I think he signs with San Fran for 2 years 45 mil but 6.5 mil in stat goals.|`|AA10274353	I think he would take it! he said he wanted 3+years
eSL9tWnQaa	Yes, Beltran trumps Ordonez in fantasy baseball with his speed.|`|xQFWjFyZaa	I think so. Beltran is a top 25 pick in my opinion. His Power/Average/Speed combo is nice for Fantasy owners. Magglio is becoming more 1 dimensional every year. Even better if it's a keeper league.|`|AA11519561	Yes...but I highly doubt the other manager will approve it.|`|eFQXl7uyaa	No. Everything is about the same for both players. You will get more SB's out of Beltran but for me Maggs is just more consistant and I can put him in, leave him there and he will score in some category every day. Maggs also goes in cycles that if you have had him enough times in fantasy you have to put up with - I let him go last year. This year I think he will be a demon again and put up big numbers.<br>  <br>  I don't think you will hurt yourself if you trade but this one is almost pointless (except beltran is a little more fragile and may play fewer games).
svU3xeotaa	ronaldo by a thousand miles. why?<br>  <br>  ronaldo can play on the left, right, and a striker.<br>  <br>  messi can only play on the right.<br>  <br>  ronaldo is good in the air.<br>  <br>  messi is too short to header any balls in the air.<br>  <br>  ronaldo is faster and stronger.<br>  <br>  messi is just fast.<br>  <br>  ronaldo has good free kicks<br>  <br>  messi is horrible a free kicks|`|IWM1khX7aa	Lionel Messi, no doubt!<br>  <br>  Infact, he's the best in the world. He's the fastest player, so he can easily beat his opponents. He's also less selfish with the ball. Cristiano Ronaldo is better at free kicks, but Messi way better as a player. People don't like him for his looks or anything else, they like him because he plays total football.<br>  <br>  Messi has the potential to become better than Maradona, and that's saying something.|`|9XxQJLqUaa	both of these players are awesome but right now ronaldo is better he is in his prime and is dominating soccer, messi is very good but alot of times messi cant finish but he is still very young so maybe in a few years messi will be better|`|cq2XIko9aa	Lionel Messi he reminds of George Best.For me i think no one was near to him even he destroyed half his carrier and still called the 3 greatest and most Naturally Gifted Footballer ever|`|66dfFiqJaa	Great question!<br>  Lionel Messi has great potential and I think will be better than Maradona.<br>  Ronaldo, (Now in his Hay-Day) is a good player but unfortunately such a great player is also a great cheat. He dives to much and sometimes is selfish. He has great tricks but sometimes they get him no where. The difference is Lionel Messi knows when to use his tight control and tricks. Ronaldo is better and Dead ball situations but not as consistant. If he is to be the best player in the world he must play his best week in week out.|`|1ctvaBRmaa	I am from portugal(half), if u asking me which player i like - i will tell u ronaldo, but when we come to the reality it is messi who is more likable than any other player in this planet, i wish he is from portugese too.

It's hard to compare old timers with the present game. Back in Ruth's day, they knew heat was coming and it was down the middle.

The other scenario is HHH comes out with a McMahon, likely Stephanie and she ends up helping Orton and therefore joins Legacy.  Then comes out later and says the whole thing was a plan to get back at HHH for what happened a few years back.<br>  <br>  If Orton wins, then Cena wins, if Edge wins, then HHH wins.|`|AA11847482	Triple H & John Cena but Undertaker is going to steal the show as he should on such a huge night for WWE!|`|PrpLmZoRaa	Orton and Cena|`|mDuiiVN7aa	RKO<br>  CENA
GLd6cmlcaa	Well ive played center mid my whole life until recently ive been switched to right mid. Ive learned that most power comes from hitting the ball properly. If you do not have proper technique when shooting i would say to develop this first. Learn how to hit the ball with all parts of the foot. If you're already comfortable with this well then i would say to build the strength in your quads, the big meaty muscle on your thigh. You can do this by plyometrics, and weight lifting like squats and leg presses. Once you do this well then practice shooting again, but try to extend your leg faster. Its simple physics the faster your leg is moving when it hits the ball the more force that is transferred to it. If you put all three together your shot power should improve. Good Luck!|`|S0VK07o3aa	Exercises like bike riding, running and squats should increase the muscles in your legs and lower core as well as your stamina, however it is in my experience that simply kicking balls more will increase your shot power because, unlike the other suggestions, only the important muscles will be strengthened. This method will reduce the development of unnecessary muscle mass (weight). The best method that has been taught to me is kicking deflated balls. This is because deflated balls are heavier than pumped up balls and so your legs will have to worker harder to kick them. Gradually deflate the ball more and more to make it more challenging. Continue to do this and you WILL have a stronger shot.|`|wNI6W8sdaa	well the best way to get a stronger shot for soccer would be to work out and focus on your thighs and learn to kick the soccer ball in the sweet spot.|`|zmkTPwgoaa	Its football not soccer. Plenty of jogging cycling ect should help

Of all time, however, I'm not so certain. I can think of many who would argue that it was Edgar Martinez. He played with the Mariners, and before he was injured, was a decent 3B. Once injured, he became a DH permanently, and he was terrific. That is why I think it is; Edgar Martinez.|`|hv8ytdaoaa	IDK.

As far as Griffen shutting down Blair, they said Taibeet could do that as well and you saw what happened.  Plus maybe Griffen will man up and play in a big game.  Oh that's right he had a concussion from a graze to the face.|`|cR4W88GYaa	No they are not the best team. Look at who the Big East and ACC teams gotta play not a push over game in their conference.

t3rmVomeaa	So youre planning to wear a long sleeve base layer, with a hooded sweatshirt on top of that, then going to pile on a fleece and coat?  I doubt that you will be able to move, let alone ski effectively.  <br>  <br>  The coat is fine.  Nort Face makes some good stuff in my opinion.  Depending on the temps outside, you will probably be able to get away with just two or three layers.  The baselayer should be some sort of wicking material that will draw the moisture away from your skin and let it evaporate off.  Under Armour makes some good stuff, but you can get cheap wicking athletic gear at Wal-Mart.  Forget the hoodie, you dont need it.  Its probably cotton and will be too bulky.  Go with the fleece on top of the base layer and then the coat, and you should be just fine, as long as its not -25 outside.  <br>  <br>  More important that all of this other stuff...Dont be stupid.  Wear a helmet.|`|cOFWJWdQaa	It depends where and when you ski.  If it's under 25 degrees you will probably want an insulated coat.  But you can get away with lots of layers.

At this point, noone looks like challenging his superiority at middleweight, the biggest challenges come from Abraham, who Pavlik will be able to beat on points with his control of length, similar to Taylor. Anthony Mundine may also challenge Pavlik but he lacks the power and agression to beat him. Pavlik to stay on top<br>  <br>  Light-Heavy - Chad Dawson is on his way up and will be peaking as a superstar headline PPV fighter in 3 years time. A fighter id like to see him take on is Kessler who definitely has the size to go up and the power and skill to cause Dawson trouble. Think Dawson would overwhelme Kessler though similarly to Calzaghe<br>  <br>  Heavyweight - David Haye isnt smart enough at this stage to challenge the Klitschko's, his fight against Barrett was just i hit you, you hit me, Vlad or Vitali would outbox him. I think the $$$ on offer for the two to fight each other will force them into over the next couple of year, id have to back the toughness and experience of Vitali. Never seen Povetkin but i hear he is good and may be the toughest challenger to either Klitschko over the next 3 years if they havent retired by then|`|8xyFCsMRaa	three years is a long road. <br>  <br>  here is my forecast.<br>  <br>  1. Juan Diaz or Gamboa. simply because pacquiao and marquez would have retired by then.<br>  <br>  2. Id give this one to Ortiz.<br>  <br>  3. Andy Lee. <br>  <br>  4.this one will be cottos future turf<br>  <br>  5. ward will have a chance <br>  <br>  6. its still the klitschkos.|`|fwWO14fIaa	lightweight - joan guzman<br>  <br>  Welterweight - andre berto<br>  <br>  Light middleweight - ricardo mayorga <br>  <br>  Middleweight - arthur abraham<br>  <br>  Light heavyweight - chad dawson <br>  <br>  Heavyweight - david haye <br>  <br>  these may not be up there at the moment but i do believe that these fighters will be top in a 2 years max.

I think athletically its obviously Harris and Harris has a big future in the NBA. As far as basketball I.Q. its Kidd he has a lot of experience and is one of the best floor generals in the NBA.  If Kidd was still in his prime then this would be an easy answer because Kidd would be better. But since we haven't seen Harris in his prime yet its hard to tell.  At this point of time I have to go with Kidd but if I was looking to build a team I would take Harris.  It's to bad Kidd hasn't gelled with Dallas hopefully in the future he can go somewhere like Boston or LA (Lakers) where he has a chance to win a championship.|`|aupDanleaa	now harris<br>  all time obviously kidd|`|YeNp4m8haa	harris is better at<br>  points<br>  ft%<br>  fg%<br>  min|`|ETfgBxUbaa	right now harris is like 2 years ago kidd was better|`|fZ38PPgSaa	kidd when he was in his prime , harris now

Fontana BABY!!!!<br>  <br>  Although I believe the race should of kept going. I think mostly everyone feels hat way. I am a Kenseth fan, and I wanted the race to keep going.... But there was nothing that Nascar could do. The radar didn't have the rain stopping. And it didn't stop after a while. But what I have a problem with was that they started way later than usual.

So, they gave their tickets to a neighbor-guess what- the rain began JUST LIKE IT WAS FORECAST. NASCAR wouldn't start the race early because it had been sold out the day before! They had their money. Plus sold T V ad revenue.<br>  Best to move on and forget it-it's the new bland ruined version of the Winston Cup.

If you were going to use it for hiking, the recommendation probably would be different than if you were going to use it for travel, or carrying books to school. <br>  <br>  If it's just for books nearly anything will do. Find something you like. Look for features like padded shoulder straps, internal key pockets or clips, iPod friendly features,  and pen and pencil compartments,  and maybe even padded section for a laptop.  LL Bean usually sells several very nice book packs for students, so check out their website. <br>  <br>  If it's for hiking, then go to a reputable outdoors store and try on a few models. Don't worry so much about color as you would about fit and function. <br>  <br>  For travel look for a backpack with fewer external straps and pockets, the kinds of things that might get caught in doors and on luggage carousels.

KzpZBMVOaa	Man I hear this question ALL the time, and I will tell you the same thing that I would tell someone of any age: start with one art. Be it wrestling, Judo, Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, Kung Fu, Karate, even Tae Kwan Do (make sure they spar though). Anything. Just go watch as many different styles as you can at the local dojos (its free to watch), and then pick a class. Pick ONE at first. If you have the discipline to go regularly and attend, doing well, you may join another one, but not until you have done just one for several months, maybe even a year at least. THEN you can cross-train. I think wrestling is a great start, and so is Muay Thai. You could join the high school wrestling team, or if you don't like it, try the local dojo. This is the best way, trust me.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	If you want it for sport and competition, yes.<br>  <br>  If you want it for a martial art, no.<br>  <br>  You'll learn how to fight in competitions, but it's not very practical for real life self defense.|`|J1kJb98Maa	sure|`|FVfBm86Caa	think you want to learn how to fight not the art of fighting. but 15 is good with any hobby would of been better if you were younger|`|25xZMjmTaa	Perfect age.

rr6IpMQBaa	About a lap and a half of a 25 yard pool|`|WJdN2zXVaa	i could probably do a lap and a half in a 25 yd pool if i didnt do a workout before and i did a good breathing exercise. because at practice we do 10x25 nobreathers. and i do that.|`|SD4VtziKaa	i can breathe for like a minute out of water but like 45 seconds out of it. its weird|`|UNUJNgHxaa	I did an experiment before I decided to answer your question. Here is how my experiment went. First I grabbed my official stop watch. It is a timex. Then i grabbed a buddy to hold the watch and push the start button. At first he was skeptical, after understanding that in no way he was supposed to let me die. We made it clear he was to do CPR, call 911, or run and get help just in case something bad happened. Now you can see why he was skeptical. After all this was agreed upon. The experiment was to start. I did my official breathing exercise that i seen on the discover channel. I love that channel by the way. Then I gave him the official start nod. he hit the button, I held my breath. Now the experiment was on. All of a sudden  I hit the floor, flopped like a fish out of water. Hit my head on the corner of the coffee table. Bleeding like a stuck pig on Christmas dinner. My fearless buddy ran out of the house, got a neighbor and put all this on youtube. So to answer your question about how long a person can hold there breath. I would have to say. they can hold it till they pass out. I hope this answers your question. Good luck and don't try this at home.|`|AlJ557gHaa	like 3 minutes
dcNT65mTaa	The worst possible choice is Kozlov by a hair over JBL. Kozlov is unproven, exaggerated, and push excessively. He's undefeated in singles competition but loses plenty in tag matches, fatal four ways or triple threats. He's got no title reigns, not a very big fan base, and they'd piss off a bunch of ppl making him accomplish a feat so many greats could not.

AA11080680	Well it depends if your worried about heading the ball and getting a concussion than yes. However if your wondering if heading the ball or using your chest to block the ball than no it's what you have to do at times during the game. You can't be scared when your out there you have to play tough and have a I can attitude. Good luck to you and keep on keeping on.|`|nwpzO9w5aa	no thats a pretty average way of blocking the ball|`|TPQ3Sz7iaa	No, as long as you're not just getting in the way of the ball instead of actually trying to control and trap it. Chest traps are very effective. But if a ball is flying at you and you just want to sacrifice your body (so it doesn't go in the goal, etc.) then turn your back towards it as it hits you. And it's not bad to head the ball as long as you do it correctly.|`|kuBqJ0QBaa	well it depends never let the ball hit u in the back of the head because u could die bit watever else is ok|`|KJ1wcVf3aa	i don't know

Your profession doesn't affect how you feel (in most cases, but some people tend to be indifferent and don't let work and emotions get involved) but in the end we are all human. You can pretend you don't feel any emotions, but it doesn't mean it doesn't affect you. You still feel it, you just ignore it.<br>  <br>  The reason I say "most likely", is also because it could just be an unhappy marriage so when the said wrestler moves away they wouldn't really get depressed at all, or there could be some other exceptional circumstance where they don't necessarily feel depressed.|`|5f6844845b26a0fc8726ed3e3624ab19aa	Maybe, becuase being a wrestler is no easy and you might get really hurt and it is really sad when you think that might be the last time you ever see your family.|`|CVk2dWiDaa	it doesnt really matter if their a wrestler or not; depends on what kind of person they are, not their career path.|`|AA10562507	Sure they do !

1yov0JF9aa	it does not shoot farther, it shoots more accurately.<br>  <br>  if you can hit the target at 500 yards without a scope, you can hit the target at 800 yards with a scope.<br>  <br>  a scope only magnifies the target allowing for better aim.|`|lcg1u1U7aa	No, it isn't true and you are essentially correct the scope only enables the shooter to see the target at a greater distance and improve the accuracy of aim.|`|dda37e592e7a473ae883df834ad9805faa	Having a scope does nothing to increase either the range or the mechanical accuracy of rifle.  It only allow the rifle to be indexed to the target with a greater degree of precision.<br>  <br>  As indicated, it does server the purpose of decreasing human error in sight alignment and sight picture.|`|eFW5O92Yaa	What the one guy said is the best possible answer. It doesn't increase the gun's accuracy. It decreases human error. When they say their rifles can shoot farther with a scope, it's probably more accurate(and this is probably what they meant) to say THEY can shoot farther with a scope.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	how is the gun being altered by the scope?  I do not think it is possible.  I would agree with you that it would only increase the 'person's' accuracy and not the 'gun's' accuracy nor range.|`|LUKcPy24aa	even to say that it increases accuracy is wrong.<br>  <br>  It increases the SHOOTER'S accuracy. It's decreasing human error.

fKco44yxaa	3 ways<br>  <br>  <br>  1) Youtube. Look at videos and imitate - visit www.youtube.com/parkourblog and start learning from there<br>  2) Friends. Friends who know parkour can teach you. You have no friends who do parkour? Well then get on a forum and ask some questions and maybe meet some people, or at least ask them when you have problems<br>  3) Get out there and jump :). That's how i learnt. Find some obstacles and then get around them however you can ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  Start with jumping between gap, precision jumps and so on and 'monkeys' + simple vaults like that|`|DOShS8q0aa	Well i have been teaching myself of the foundations i learn from a friend and im doing fine. The important thing is that you're practicing the right movements and technique so that you don't hurt yourself later. When starting it is important to get a good foundation. Find someone else with more experience in your area and learn from them. Most traceurs are more than willing to introduce a new recruit to parkour. Depending on how seriously you take it you can progress at different levels. Good luck.

I respect him though because he wasn't for giving up even though it was inevitable he would lose. I think he faired better than Gomez did against Cotto, he moved well but should have kept the jab up.<br>  <br>  I like Cotto as a boxer, he's smart, accurate, powerful and entertaining to watch.

AV4CYfGDaa	In all cases, you replace your ball and the other player plays his ball where it ends up.<br>  <br>  If both balls are on the green before the stroke, the other player would get a two stroke penalty in stroke play. If it is match play, there is no penalty. <br>  <br>  If either ball was not on the green, there is no penalty.<br>  <br>  Rule 18-5 covers the ball that was at rest.<br>  <br>  Rule 19-5a covers the player who hit the shot.|`|0qu36suxaa	You replace the ball as close as you can to it's original position when it came to rest.  Your partner's ball would be classed as an outside agent that moved the ball.  Were you not to replace it, you would be subject to a two-shot penalty as you are not playing your ball from where it came to rest.<br>  <br>  If both your ball and your partner's ball are on the green, he would normally ask you to mark your ball.  If he did not and he hit it, again he would be subject to a two shot penalty.<br>  <br>  I haven't looked up the rule classifications in the R&A rulebook, but I'm fairly confident in my answer.|`|AA12283403	Here is the rule from the USGA Rules of Golf:<br>  <br>  18-5. By Another Ball<br>  If a ball in play and at rest is moved by another ball in motion after a stroke, the moved ball must be replaced.<br>  <br>  There is no penalty to either player|`|AA10206865	No penalty for you if the other player has hit from outside the green, but 2 shot penalty for you if he played on the green and has asked you to mark your ball and you did not.|`|ERo2gNxUaa	play it as it lies.|`|AYkEwqRXaa	The latter mane!  Just replace it approximately where the ball was prior to it being struck by the other ball.  I say approximately since it wasn't marked previously so you may not know exactly where it was.

AA11526639	Seems fairly simple really. Get your horse and stable it somewhere else.<br>  Failing that, she can't be much of a friend if such a little thing would come between you, so ditch her!|`|8lsBBK62aa	Listen to loanshark!|`|6JE0mcrLaa	I agree with the first answer. She doesn't seem like a very good friend if she's going to let an issue of boarding a horse come between you guys. Do what you want. It seems ideal to board the horse across the street. Hopefully she'll get over it.|`|dC4qmz8aaa	Sounds like she's taken a fancy to the owner (is he male) and she thinks you and your horse will get extra attention from him and she would be left out.  What does she have a lot of fun doing that she can't share with you!!<br>  <br>  I think you two need to talk the whole thing out she seems to need a bit of reassurance...if that fails, do as loanshark advises....look forward to the next chapter..Jac x Agony Aunt.|`|s4zxGI4naa	yeah It's a private but you're friends, right? If you and her are really friends why would she be jealous about such thing?... she got your attention all the time that's because your friends and it's fun to be together with friends. why don't you ask her about it again?|`|qj1AxtH6aa	I wouldn't call that a friend. Its your choice whether where you should keep your horse there. It would be better for you, and your parents, since it is close.
Y4mz8BShaa	CQB = Close Quarters Battle.<br>  CQC = Close Quarters Combat.<br>  CBQ and QCB are just incorrect, either through stupidity or typographical error.|`|xMSESsGQaa	Simply put:<br>  <br>  CQB and CQC (Close Quarter Battle/Combat) = Fighting in confined spaces <br>  <br>  ~Requires a compact gun for best playing<br>  ~Handguns, SMG's, and other compact rifles are prefered. <br>  <br>  I understand your new to airsoft, so if you need any more help, maybe help you find a gun to your liking or answer any odd questions go ahead and email me.<br>  <br>  [Update]<br>  <br>  Trem (guy below me), if you dont know what your talking about dont answer the question.|`|eFW5O92Yaa	If it says qcb it's just a typo, the real one is a CQB.

Wrestlemania X: Luna Vachon and Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Doink and Dink. <br>  What happened at the booking for this bout? "Okay, Vince, we have a dwarf and a freaky woman, and we will put them in a match against each other." The whole Doink thing was about the worst idea ever, and I have yet to hear who takes credit for the idea. Bigelow and Vachon won this bout, but unfortunately did not put Doink out of permanent commission. <br>  <br>  9. Wrestlemania I: Tito Santana vs. Executioner. <br>  No, this was not one of the legendary Executioners fans had seen in the past. This was fat Buddy Rose under a mask. What a great way to start off the first Wrestlemania. McMahon knew he had to put Santana on the card. Santana was young, electric and popular with the fans. Rose was never seen before or after under the mask, and that is a good thing. Santana should have been given a better opponent. <br>  <br>  8. Wrestlemania I: King Kong Bundy vs. S.D. Jones. <br>  I guess the match was used to show the domination and size of Bundy. Does it really take size to show domination over the infamous jobber Jones? Bundy would have been better off fighting a handicapped match. The high point of the bout was that is lasted all of nine seconds. <br>  <br>  7. Wrestlemania XV: Butterbean vs. Bart Gunn.<br>  This boxing match was the chance for Gunn to make a name for himself. He shocked everyone in the wrestling world the year before by winning the "Brawl for All" toughman contest the WWF put on. Gunn was never seen in a North American ring after this debacle. Butterbean smashed Gunn in the time it took for me to eat a Twinkee. It looked like Butterbean was eating the same thing. <br>  <br>  6. Wrestlemania VI: Bolsheviks vs. Hart Foundation.<br>  I guess someone realized after they booked this one that it was a mistake before. By the time I got back from getting a soda, the match was over. The Hart Foundation shut down the Russian team in about 30 seconds. <br>  <br>  5. Wrestlemania II: George Wells vs. Jake "The Snake" Roberts. <br>  Roberts was a new employee of the WWF, and they rushed him into the Wrestlemania bout. George Wells was a former football player who had not had great luck in his short WWF stay. So why not throw these guys into a Wrestlemania bout? Wells was squashed, and he was not heard from again. Even the drooling Wells at the end of the bout could not save this match. <br>  <br>  4. Wrestlemania II: Velvet McIntyre vs. The Fabulous Moolah. <br>  Planning for this match was non-existent. Every move seemed awkward and poorly executed. The only reason why this match is even remembered is because McIntyre almost lost her top trying a move off the ropes. Moolah won, but the fans lost in the long run. <br>  <br>  3. Wrestlemania XII: Goldust vs. Roddy Piper. <br>  The match was shown intermittently throughout the pay-per-view. Dubbed a "Hollywood Backlot Brawl," most of the match was pre-taped. Following the real life O.J. Simpson chase on the highway, the WWF did an exact rip-off with a helicopter watching it all. Finally, the two met for the live part of the match. Maybe they should have taped this part too because they would have had time to edit out seeing Dustin Rhodes' in a thong. Welcome to the greatest wrestling event of the year, now welcome the fat butt of Goldust. This match broke a record for the most people that threw-up during a Wrestlemania bout. <br>  <br>  2. Wrestlemania VII: Demolition vs. Koji Kitao and Genichiro Tenryu. <br>  Let's take the most dominant heel team in the WWF over the last four years and put them against some Japanese wrestlers. McMahon was thinking hard when he put Demolition against these unknowns (to most American fans). Oh, it gets better. Demolition lost. Great way to bury one of the most profitable wrestlers at the time. <br>  <br>  1. Wrestlemania V: The Red Rooster vs. Bobby Heenan.<br>  Nothing is better than seeing Terry Taylor dress up in a red mohawk to wrestle a fat, out of shape manager. Luckily this match only lasted a minute, and we were spared of what undoubtedly would have been a true snorefest. Oh, the Brooklyn Brawler was there to help manage Bobby Heenan. Without him, the match would have undoubtedly been better. <br>  <br>  Well, I hope the WWE learned from the past. Let's hope they do not make these mistakes again, but I doubt they will. Let's pray they do not offer some lame gimmick match facing Rikishi's big *** against Pat Patterson's stained undies.|`|AA11482019	HBK vs Undertaker at WM 25|`|JiCfYfLraa	damn im gonna say giant gonzolaz vs undertaker
SBBnWsJJaa	I would recommend perhaps cutting back a little on the cardio - stick mainly with the biking and running.  These activities (esp. running) will give you the most bang for your buck with regards to cardio fitness.  Be careful not to overtrain and risk injury.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend adding some strength training in the gym - concentrating mainly on your legs, but do some upper body too to help you carry a pack.<br>  <br>  Also - doing stuff once a week is not a good idea.  Again, you risk injury and you probably won't show a lot of improvement if you don't do it consistently.  You will probably spend a lot of time recovering from these ginormous workouts.  Try doing stuff (cardio and weights) 3 or 4 days a week and then a nice hike on the weekend with a pack.<br>  <br>  Oh and...you should start training about 5 months before you want to climb.<br>  <br>  I recommend the book "Climbing: Training for Peak Performance" by Clyde Soles as an EXCELLENT resource for training and nutrition for climbing.|`|QeALCWbqaa	alot|`|yvpfphQNaa	That sounds pretty good, but it'd be beneficial to do some stair climbing, as a lot of it will be trekking uphill - this definitely uses different muscles to cycling and running, even if it may not seem like it. So if you have some sort of stair machine in your gym use that, or find a tower block nearby and go up and down those stairs, or do all the stairs in a football stadium or so.<br>  Will you be carrying all your stuff? I've not done Kili but I've had long hikes in the Alps with full kit on my back (tent, sleeping bag, a tonne of metalwork for climbing, cramp-ons, ropes etc.) and it's a very hard slog, especially in the blazing sunshine.. So yeah train with the amount of weight you'll be carrying to get used to it. <br>  Oh and nearer the time you'll want to start doing it with your boots on instead of trainers. Again this will use different muscles, especially if you've got winter boots on (what's the weather on kili like? hot at the bottom, snow at the top? i guess you won't need winter boots), and to get used to the extra weight on your feet.|`|Hacoibteaa	you may want to get some experience climbing, the things you mentioned are good for general body training- you need to take lessons in climbing and climb small mountains to prepare.

qsWk3Fo6aa	I think Thome will play more.  Shef is always hurt at some point in season.  Thome doesn't play the field so he probably won't get hurt.  Thome will hit 30 HR's guarranteed.

fjKDEGAQaa	Ok for me its between Andrus and Snider. Andrus will not make an immediate impact and neither will LaPorta because they are both just coming off the minors with no MLB experience. So the odd man out is Snider. Snider not only showed that he could hit for power but he showed that he could also keep up an average. Although it was just for one month he put up numbers that impressed me and should be a no duh in a keeper league so take Snider cause he is going to have the biggest impact.|`|xQFWjFyZaa	Is Andrus the Rangers new SS? I definitely like LaPorta's potential, but he might still be a year away. I expect a mid season call up at this point. Spring Training could change my mind though. Snider is a guy who figures to get playing time early this season, and in the long run as well. If you're willing to wait, I think LaPorta has the most upside, but Snider could have an immediate impact. <br>  <br>  I don't really know a lot about Andrus. I've heard he can hit, and run as well, but he lacks power. I'll have to see more.|`|7sI4TtEIaa	Snider is the best keeper of these three

It's a basketball game, so it may be the exercise, and his body is trying to cool him off. KG does play with a lot of intensity.<br>  <br>  It might just be the way his body is, though.

tzrLDbHWaa	Depends.  Its supposed to be 2 if you're moving, but it's rarely called in the NBA.  I mean, being a Knicks fan, I remember the days of Patrick Ewing taking like 4 steps across the lane and never being called.<br>  <br>  In your case, it would be a travel.  You're allowed the 2 steps if you're moving. like driving to the basket.  If you completely stop at the foul line, you can take 1 step in any direction as if you were pivoting, but you can't take a 2nd step.<br>  <br>  Here are the rules, as stated by the NBA when it comes to traveling.<br>  <br>  Section XIV-Traveling<br>  a. A player who receives the ball while standing still may pivot, using either foot as the pivot foot.<br>  b. A player who receives the ball while he is progressing or upon completion of a dribble, may use a two-count rhythm in coming to a stop, passing or shooting the ball.<br>  The first count occurs:<br>  (1) As he receives the ball, if either foot is touching the floor at the time he receives it.<br>  (2) As the foot touches the floor, or as both feet touch the floor simultane- ously after he receives the ball, if both feet are off the floor when he receives it.<br>  The second occurs:<br>  (1) After the count of one when either foot touches the floor, or both feet touch the floor simultaneously.<br>  c. A player who comes to a stop on the count of one may pivot, using either foot as the pivot foot.<br>  d. A player who comes to a stop on the count of two, with one foot in advance of the other, may pivot using only the rear foot as the pivot foot.<br>  e. A player who comes to a stop on the count of two, with neither foot in advance of the other, may use either foot as the pivot foot.<br>  f. In starting a dribble after (1) receiving the ball while standing still, or (2) coming to a legal stop, the ball must be out of the player's hand before the pivot foot is raised off the floor.<br>  g. If a player, with the ball in his possession, raises his pivot foot off the floor, he must pass or shoot before his pivot foot returns to the floor. If he drops the ball while in the air, he may not be the first to touch the ball.<br>  h. A player who falls to the floor while holding the ball, or while coming to a stop, may not gain an advantage by sliding.<br>  i. A player who attempts a field goal may not be the first to touch the ball if it fails to touch the backboard, basket ring or another player.<br>  PENALTY: Loss of ball. The ball is awarded to the opposing team at the sideline, nearest spot of the violation but no nearer the baseline than the foul line extended.|`|FCLqETmNaa	unless you are doing a lay up, none. but you are aloud 2 if you are doing a lay up.|`|ZOoLgSSFaa	2
Y4mz8BShaa	There aren't any. 6mm paintballs are all terribly made, only like to break on hard, solid objects (walls, not people), and love to destroy your airsoft gun. They'll break inside the hop-up chamber, just in front of the air nozzle, in the magazine, or as they travel down the barrel, and what internals you can't clean will have to be replaced.|`|2mxbb6ULaa	These will work with paintballs really well.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&item=280316710138" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?Vie...</a>|`|Rkw7vLhPaa	I agree with Dmitri on this one.<br>  <br>  The only airsoft guns that actually shoot 6mm paintballs are cheap spring rifles and pistols.<br>  <br>  Automatics cannot shoot paintballs, and frankly, trying will only void warranty and lose you money.<br>  <br>  Just don't buy the paintballs, it is only going to cause you grief.
WV5cwIoTaa	hey im a blue jays fan i think they will do just fine|`|nDzenpkwaa	Chances are slim.  The division they play in is full of juggernauts.  It wouldn't be impossible if injuries stay low and their pitchers come to win games.  Halladay would have to go like 24 - 4 on the season and everyone else would need at least 10 - 15 wins.  They are good, don't get me wrong.  But the teams they will play the most are very, very good...<br>  <br>  "Tampa Bay Gays"  very creative, how is that working out for you?|`|1ccf88691a66115cf513dd74553d6309aa	Saying this only out of complete selfishness, I hope they have a horrible start to the season. <br>  Just in the hopes that it would make Halladay available via trade to another team outside of the AL East. Maybe the Angels, maybe the Dodgers.|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	Honestly, not too great. Here are my predictions for the AL East:<br>  1.y- Red Sox<br>  2. x-Yankees<br>  3. Rays <br>  4. Blue Jays<br>  5. Orioles<br>  x-Clinched Playoff Spot; y-Division Champ|`|T9vs3asQaa	You better watch what you say about the other AL east teams. Jays rhyme with gays too.|`|NpqAbZqpaa	So, you look at that lineup and you can say at least 2nd in the division??<br>  <br>  Marcum is out for the season, McGowan is out until June.  Accardo is a reliever, Purcey is a 2nd year guy.  <br>  Overbay is NOT a good hitter, <br>  <br>  I'm a Jay area resident, but they can't beat Tampa or Boston.  They should finish 1-2.<br>  <br>  Also, making your own cute little names for other divisional teams makes you the worst kind of fan.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, they aren't winning anything while JP Ricarrdi is there.|`|z4Vpi48Raa	Manny is a fantastic hitter that can produce some big numbers.I would say his fielding is average at best. One big problem with  him is $$. He is gonna want a lot of it , especially after his strong finish with LA. Honestly, I think the AL east is too powerful for the Blue Jays at the moment. I Think the sox and yankees will probably be the 1 and 2 teams (Hard to tell which one will be on top) and the Rays got a young team with a lot of talent.|`|dAM2o5lTaa	sorry to say, but the chances aren't too good.......at least in the AL East--pretty tough division.  Now not only the Yanks and the Sox, but the Rays too.  <br>   <br>  If they were in the NL west tho, they might make the playoffs at least.  <br>  <br>  I'm a big John McDonald fan tho!!! <br>  <br>  Going to two Blue Jays games this summer!!! :)|`|PqY0xNxHaa	Honestly, not too great. Here are my predictions for the AL East:<br>  1. Yankees<br>  2. Red Sox<br>  3. Rays <br>  4. Blue Jays<br>  5. Orioles<br>  My thoughts- Blue Jays will get 85-86 wins. They will be surprise contenders in the beginning of the year, but kind of collapse after the all star break.|`|aEwd0f5Waa	Those are creative nicknames...the Jays must really suck if the Yankmees, Blowsox, and Gays are all better than you.

Absolutely loathe NYY and Boston and went to Jays spring training games when I was younger.  Jesse Barfield was the man back then.<br>  <br>  Cito Gaston is a pretty good manager I agree, I mean he did win a WS or 2, right?  I know Franconia won 2 and he "lost" Manny in the middle of a hotly contested division race last season.  Can you imagine Manny playing for a team that is 10-18 games out going into September.  I'm not really sure any manager can handle him at this point of his career.<br>  <br>  Almost forgot.... where's the nickname for the 1 team the Jays are actually better than in the Orioles? I know Baltimore and Orioles are kind of tough to make fun with those kind of names, but you appear to be so clever with Gays, Yankmees, and Blowsox.
r5AMG8g7aa	Extremely dangerous. It is very possible to cause serious and permanent injury. not something to be done in a fight unless your life is in danger. One of many problems with a strike there is this.  The edge of the bone of the eyebrow is thin It is porous. It can easily be broken off. Many times it will get pushed into the eye causing serious injury or blindness.  It is just to risky for most situations. most of the time nothing that drastic is called for.<br>  <br>  EDIT: CollectorX  And your experience in this is what exactly?  I do not feel that I'm being overly cautious. I have had first hand experience in what i mentioned. I also had an instructor that did also.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	In Muay Boran, the head is one of the striking surfaces of the body. Even so, it can be very dangerous. If you get K.O.-ed in a real fight, there's nothing you can do to stop that person from killing you or doing whatever while you're taking your little nap. Avoid using headbutts.|`|KzpZBMVOaa	the guys above are being overly cautious. I will tell you the naughty little secret that teachers don't want their students to know: headbutting is great. In fact, it is so effective it is illegal in the UFC. It is dangerous, it is true, but remember: the skull is the hardest bone to break in the human body. It can withstand 500 lbs or so of pressure. I have headbutted a few folks here and there, but usually with my forehead to their face. The nose is the best place to headbutt someone in my opinion. Trust me it will hurt them way more than it will hurt you, if you use the right part of your head.|`|Y26eOD9Caa	If you were lucky enough to get a full on headbutt to land on someones temple, it would be lights out, game over for them.  That being said, it would be pretty difficult to be that accurate with a headbutt.  It's an unreliable move, in my opinion; you're just as likely to hurt yourself as the opponent.  In a situation where you're in close, and your arms are occupied, you could use one to break free, but I wouldn't go full force.  You might knock yourself out.|`|04224b55dbe6d25a34730fdddf5252b9aa	when you head butt you should turn the head and headbutt to the side of the jaw,cheekbone or temple.in this day and age you would be foolish to headbutt to the front of the face,aids,hiv,hepatitis ,etc,etc,etc. it always amazes me that some teachers are stupid enough to teach there students to headbutt to the face.|`|5KjvNg2oaa	one time i fought a whole vale tudo match fighting with just headbutts and i won the match but the other guy got to use anything but i was so skilled with my headbutts he ended up getting knocked out it was sooo crazy

The problem however is that Spain are notorious for slipping up in important competitions (prior to their win in the Euro's) and so it might be a safer bet going for either Germany or Brazil - teams who consistently reach the semis and finals of most world cups.

Since you are pretty small and light i haven't seen the board go below 152 too often, but i could be mistaken.

This board was first sold for the 2007/2008 winter season under the Lib Experimental branch - the same people who brought you Magne-Traction a few years earlier. The 2008/2009 Skate Banana is the same as the previous years' board. Lib Tech's rocker is different from K2's; the reverse camber is between the bindings, and from the bindings to the tips, the board is flat.<br>  <br>  Pros: Perfect amount of reverse camber. This board carves well, is solid on jumps and in the pipe, and it presses really well - the best of all worlds! Most boards are either great for jibs because they're soft (sketchy on jumps) or great for jumps because they're stiffer (hard for jibs). This board does it all.<br>  Magne-Traction holds really well in hard-pack, even if the edges are detuned for rails. <br>  <br>  <br>  Overall Impression: Definitely my favorite snowboard. Great on rails, jumps and halfpipe. Perfect stiffness so it's solid on jumps, but still great on rails. If you like snowboarding and having fun, you'll like this board!

aRy2ZvT9aa	Its free for some races. But its only like 29.95 for the entire season or 2.95 a month something like that. You can do it for 14 days for free but then you have to cancel it or they will charge your credit or debit card at the end of 14 days.. Most of my friends all get the scanner for a yr, thats why when we have a race party at my place we have like 6 or 7 drivers on scanners when they bring their laptops over.

ZpH2PFF9aa	bench warmer|`|2N6oTOLQaa	You don't mention your age, but if you are in high school then you're pretty small. Typically, 2nd base is the place for a guy who is small, but is quick enough with a good enough bat to justify being on the team. The reason for this is the fact that its the position where throwing velocity is the least important because most of your throws are short. If you have a good arm and can throw just as hard as the guys who are 6 feet tall, then there's no reason why you can't play another position. You'll probably never be able to play 1st base though. That's one position where you need to be tall with long arms so you can reach high throws or grab throws that are wide without taking your foot off the base.|`|g4cYFVrmaa	2nd base|`|eFQXl7uyaa	Based on what you given me to go on, John is right - 2nd base.. not the defensive position but the bag itself. Just lay there.<br>  Position for the most part is determined by skill not measurements. Youi usually want a tall player at 1B for a larger target, a stocky player at C to cover more plate area (and the inevitable collision). Pitchers are more desireable if they are tall (release point is closer to the hitter giving them less reaction time)... your true position is utility, you need to understand every position and be ready to play any of them. That way you can just play the position your team needs.|`|AA11720887	Bobby Shantz was a Yankee pitcher in the 50's. He was 5'6" and was the best fielding pitcher of his time. In 1952 he won 24 games. You can play any position you want if you work hard at it. I wouldn't recommend catcher. It will depend on how fast you are, how much of an arm you have, and how can you hit.|`|nH8AV9Soaa	2nd base. if ur quick and can move and got a decent arm.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	If you are young, then try em all and see which one you like best.

Also if I were you, most of GI's websites' carbines are pretty pricey. So either find a different website(pretty much anything except airsplat.com) or settles for just a plain AEG.|`|AfNeQxOfaa	you say you want to add on a lot of attachments just remember what you'll be doing with the gun though. if your going to be outside in the woods then a laser is going to be pointless because you wont be able to see it. a flashlight will also be ridiculous obviously if its not dark. just remember this is all... a lot of the red dot scopes are crap also. just stil with iron sights on your carbine.<br>  <br>  heres a really good brand and good for the money also.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hitguns.com/JG-G36C-Version-3-Metal-Gear-Box-Airsoft-Electric-p/jg-g36c.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hitguns.com/JG-G36C-Version-3...</a>|`|AA11765920	Alright, well today I got my airsoft gun that I've been wanting for a while. It's the R34 Stinger Carbine from Crosman. It has a sight that you can add on, and a stock that you can add on and pull out. It has a strap, and isn't pricy at all. I got it for $32 from Walmart.<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5913347" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a>
Ucbnl7VJaa	The Tikka is a very nice rifle. The Rem 710 and 770 are not. The lowest cost rifle I can recommend that comes in a left hand model would be the Savage Model 10/110 series. Those are often under $500 in the package versions. They make synthetic and wood stock models both but I think the only left hand package rifle w/ syntheic in the catalog is a youth model. <br>  <br>  The scopes on the package rifles are Simmons and not bad for a start. Anything you can buy new for $100 isn't going to be signifigantly better. If you were spending 150-225 there are Swift, Sightron, Weaver V-series, Bushnell Elite 3200, Nikon's Prostaff or Buckmaster, and Burris Fullfield II models to choose from. If you start with the package then when ever you can do it just set aside a little money Even if it's just 5-10 bucks it adds up fast. Once you have say $300-350 then go buy a Leupold VX-II, Nikon Monarch or another really good medium-high price scope. Mount it with good rings & bases such as Leupold or Millet and you'll be set for several decades of hard use. <br>  <br>  You really don't need a scope over 40mm on the objective for 99% of American big game hunting. Even a fixed power like a 4x32mm can handle 90% or more.<br>  <br>  Mil-dots won't help much unless you really know how to use them and have the practice time in at long range to really be good. One of the best rifle shots I know uses a 3-9 Leupold(I think it's Leupold anyhow) with a plex reticle and he has the skill and experience to make clean kills to beyond 400yds on deer and antelope with his .308 Winchester.  Plus Mil-dot reticles aren't generally available in the medium price range scopes. Mostly they are offered on cheap scopes(not usually worth even the low price) or high end optics.

It's a trademark thing.<br>  <br>  John Cena is known for his Five Knuckle Shuffle.

WWE waters down movesets because they want the wrestlers to be known for a few significant moves.<br>  <br>  CM Punk, for example - He can do an awesome move - a Pedigree from the second ropes, but they don't let him use it because it's too similar to Triple H's move.<br>  <br>  Jeff Hardy is a high flyer. That is a style and he is a good wrestler. You seem biased towards hating Jeff Hardy. I read your profile and you're very judgemental. <br>  <br>  You said in your profile:<br>  2. Jeff Hardy looks like an emo granny when wearing makeup.<br>  <br>  3. Jeff Hardy looks like a dehydrated granny without makeup.<br>  <br>  4. Matt Hardy = spoonface<br>  <br>  7. Randy Orton ate Jeff Hardy's drugs, that's why he hears voices in his head, while Jeff Hardy sees writings on the wall.<br>  <br>  <br>  That's pathetic. Let go of the fact that he did drugs. He made a mistake. Big deal. Everyone makes mistakes. Everyone can end up repeating those mistakes.

My theory is that fans of different faces usually don't get along. Cena's fans hate Jeff's fans and Jeff's fans hate Triple H's fans who in turn hate Cena's fans. This don't apply to everyone but it's general.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, fans of different heels usually get along. Edge's fans, Orton's fans and Jericho's fans usually (but obviously not always)get along with each other even though they each have their favorite heel. <br>  <br>  And you face fans call yourselves the "good guys"?|`|kgTllrk3aa	You feeble humans!|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	Haters in general are wrestling's biggest hypocrites, for every reason they give to hate they nearly always have a favorite that does the exact same thing.

cK6x9FBBaa	9, very good players but you will need a backup catcher.|`|pdu0ZEfIaa	I think its and 9 out of 10|`|3QELIOU7aa	4\10|`|iHYf76jHaa	I give you an 8/10.  You can improve the pitching like you pretty much stated in trades.  Look into trading Frucal as your offense is still great without him for some pitching.  And also Abreu would be a good trade chip.  Finally I know he is one of your few good pitchers but look to deal Harden.  He is too injury prone.|`|AA11720887	For my opinion your outfield is solid. Harden just might be your ace so unless you can get a major player for him, keep him. Furcal won't give you a lot of stats but if they sign Manny, their lineup will see a lot of opportunities. You have 2 good closers. Your bench is weak but I don't see a lot of trade bait. I would go into it with those players. Watch for free waivers. Pick up anyone you can there. Good luck but I think you can compete.|`|T9vs3asQaa	7/10 You need an ace|`|Md0KbK3Taa	9/10..however sit kelly johnson and start orlando hudson. you have fantastic depth at first so play that to your advantage and use it as trade bait for an ace. be a little cautious with bedard however. big injury last year and an interesting team he has behind him this year, he's either gonna sink or swim. also get a back up catcher. someone consistent who will split time with another catcher. a team like the phillies, giants, marlins, etc supply a good amount of back up catchers. Your outfield looks fantastic as long as Pence and Abreu stay consistent and Shane stays healthy. so look on the free agent wire at some good back up outfielders (Endy Chavez, Jayson Werth). But other than that your team looks great.
r5AMG8g7aa	When Van Damme first came into public notice years ago he was investigated by some martial artists. He had claimed several championships overseas. The investigations could not find the organizations he named. The one that did exist had never heard of him. There was fr years also a rivalry between Van Damme and Steven Segal.

NJMzhcKhaa	Most JKD schools are McDojos that sell Bruce Lee's name to wide-eyed people who want to be like Lee.<br>  JKD as martial art is a misconception anyway since there's no martial art called Jeet Kune Do in the first place.

Z5BLfE9faa	It depends on your preference. As far as training goes, sprinting is usually a lot more tiring than distance, as for our team, sprinters do a lot of HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training, i.e. timed 100m, 200m, walk jog sprints, etc.) but us distance guys usually go on a 45-minute run drills and call it a day.<br>  <br>  As a distance guy, I find the mile the most fun event because its the easiest by far because for half of the race you run at your pace, but the 2 mile most boring. My fellow distance friend finds the 2 mile fun for no apparent reason.<br>  <br>  I find the 400 the hardest event because they way it is, its one lap. Therefore, you can never slow down or you'll lose the race, and you can only speed up, an I have found no place in the 400m where I can pace myself. Most of the sprinters find the 200 the funnest because it involves a curve, while others love the 100m because its a straightaway. It all depends on what you want to do. Also, as Im not a natural sprinter, I find sprints the least fun because of the simple fact that I cant sprint hard for more than 50 or 60m, which makes me useless for the 100m - 400m, although because a 400m shouldnt take more than a minute if your decent, many people like it as opposed to the 5 minute miles.<br>  <br>  I would say go to a track with a buddy and try all the events (except the 2 mile, because its so boring and long, unless you'v run XC you wont find it fun) and run all of them (100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1600m)|`|u8CFwtyMaa	My advice is to try all distances, and see what you feel you are best at. I have coached athletes for over 15 years, and have known people try a different distance, and find they are good at it.<br>  One athlete I coach has spent most of his life running road, between 10K and marathon, and last year he tried track. He was ranked first in the UK in his age group over 1 Mile, and did well at 800m.<br>  I've also known a marathon runner break the club record at 400m.<br>  You don't know what you can do until you try it.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|Aq0QQnxeaa	it depends on you... usually one or the other comes more naturally, I am a long distance kind of person, if you are not sure practice both. it will only help you :)|`|ubIjMK6Gaa	Honestly, it depends on what you are into more. I sprint, I think the race itself is easier, but the workouts are hard. Long distance, is running for a long time, so if you can handle that then do it, but I myself get bored. Both of them are fun, because you are with your team. But I also think sprinting is more fun to watch too.|`|ckriDuxJaa	Alright, after doing both I would have to say sprinting is more enjoyable and an easier practice.  Especially the 100m and 200m.  400m is nearly as hellish as long distance.  One other thing you might want to consider, however, is jumping.  That was easily the most fun and easiest of the events I have taken part in.  Hope this helps.|`|V3TQOp0aaa	It all depends on how hard you want to work. Me i'm good at distance so i run distance. but sprinting is probably easier. but you might want to see which one your better at. I've been doing track for four years and cross country for three years and my favorite events are the 400 and 800 so you might want to try somewhere in the middle distance range.|`|TZWkf59Daa	the 400.<br>  its one lap around the track<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090219162414AAnA6Ww&cp=23">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  please answer!<br>  we are looking for best answer!|`|xC88yOHsaa	There is no easy run in track. The distances may be shorter or more comfortable to run through, but it definitely is not easy. As for being fun, all track and field events are fun. I am a long distance runner and i love long distance, but i also really enjoy sprints. It all depends on what you are determined to give up time for or what you would rather push yourself further for. <br>  <br>  I know this is a really vague answer, but it is also the truth. I was put in as a long distance runner because that's what my coach saw i could do best. <br>  <br>  For now, i would say just to run a few (2-3 if you're comfortable) miles a day or every other day and see how you like the runs. You shouldn't be training at a fast pace because you are just starting out. Time your runs every mile or so to see how you are doing. After a few weeks, pick up the pace a little and see how far you will last. Long runs are beneficial to both sprints and long distance because it builds up your endurance and strength.<br>  <br>  I don't want to push you in either direction because I don't want to seem biased. Whatever you do next year though, i hope you have fun doing it and try your hardest.<br>  Good Luck!|`|AgsFlQdJaa	it depends what your intrests are. i run cross country which is long distance, and track. i think its fun, but the workouts are hard. for cross country we would run 10 miles at a 7 min/6:30min pace on long run days. then we would do speed workouts on other days..but its fun..and track is the same! the workouts for both sprinting and long distance are hard, but you can try them out and see which one you like. but i love distance! try it.|`|GElfG0Vlaa	more fun- distance. easier- sprinting.

iOICjcZcaa	You're a little on the skinny side. 5'11 and 125 lbs. is pretty skinny. You need to start building up. I'd recommend going to the gym and building up. Talk to some of the employees there and tell them you'd like to start building up muscles. If you stay at the weight you are now, you're about the same size as Colin Delaney. He actually weighs about twenty pounds more.<br>  <br>  Also, wrestlers are required to have a VERY high cardio, so I'd run as much as possible.<br>  <br>  First thing you need to do, is graduate high school. You can go to college if you want, but that would make things a lot harder. A lot of people like to go because they want to make sure they have something to fall back on. I'm not planning on going though. I'm just going to start training.<br>  <br>  After highschool [or college], you need to get into a wrestling school. Just google "wrestling schools in [insert city here]."  I'd recommend doing your research. Make sure you don't choose a school that is run by someone who doesn't even have an idea what they're doing. <br>  <br>  A good wrestling school generally costs up to $3000, not including tryouts, which cost $500. The tryouts are basically them making you exercise and workout to see if you can take it.<br>  <br>  Wrestling schools generally last a year, and if you've got a good trainer, he'll start taking you to independent wrestling promotions in the area and get you booked for a match.<br>  <br>  Take every job you can get. Some jobs pay $20 a night. Some pay none at all. Send your resume, pictures of you, and videos into FCW, which is WWE's officialy developmental center in Florida. They only accept wreslters with a good amount of experience, so be prepared.<br>  <br>  After that, continue to send in resumes to WWE. They might accept you; but they might not. <br>  <br>  If you have any more questions, you can e-mail me. I'm starting training next year.|`|xUsUNGYyaa	Get into a good school that will help you and not just take your money.Then train right and lay off any of the steriod type stuff cause you won't get respect if you do.Mae sure you want to be away from your family a lot because you will be on the road a longtime before you get to see them again.You need a part time job of some kind cause your not going to get paid a whole lot of money when you start.|`|4Q2IvBxoaa	First step is to find a wrestling school in your area, find out what age you have to be to get in and when you can get it.

BK1GjPT6aa	You're bringing up my memories. I'll be honest and tell you that I can't remember the street names anymore so ask for directions or use a map of the area. I'll give you as many clues that I can remember to help you out. "fishing requires detective work, It's not always about the fish but the water we fish from that makes it the greatest catch." <br>  <br>  * Long Horn Dam: Stripers, Bass and Catfish. It's next to a base ball field near Garden Ave/st.  Walk down the dam edge and fish the deeper water. When the dam is wide open, fish from the top for Stripers. When it's closed, you can walk the shallows looking for pot holes and fish them. Watch out for the water Moccasins.<br>  <br>  * Decker Lake: This lake is in Manor and there's a bait shop right outside the entrance. You'll have to pay to get in the lake. Fish towards the dam or go to the opposite side. You can fish the boat docks as well for big carp, catfish and bass.<br>  <br>  * Round Rock: there's a park in round rock that has the original rock formation that is round. It's on the same road the round rock  hospital is on.  There's a park right off I-35.You will see a gas station, follow that road down and it leads you to a park. It  has a base ball field. This creak/mini river leads you to 3 different fishing areas and 2 other parks. Walk the entire area and take bread....carps there are huge and can be caught on bread. Although most of the area is shallow, you can catch bass up to 5 pounds here. You will run across a small water fall on both sides ( opposite ends of the park) , fish these areas well.<br>  <br>   * Gator Hole: this is a med. sized duck public duck pond in round rock that is in a residential area. It's known as the "gator hole " by locals but not so on a map. Legend is that some guy caught a huge Gator Gar there that weighed well over 100 pounds.You can catch catfish ( well known for this) and bass. <br>  <br>  * Pflugerville: there is a small creek here that's part of a park. The area is shallow but there is a few deep holes with big cats and bass.  It's right off killingsworth lane. This is a great place as well to catch shiners as it has 3 small water falls. Watch out for the snakes.  It's a small park but constantly over looked. Oh yeah, it's right across from a huge church. <br>  <br>  Note: looking for free bait? Try going to Fiesta Super market at night. Crickets by the millions. You'll look goofy catching them but does it really matter? You'll be catching fish and well worth the effort.<br>  <br>  You can also travel to Bastrop for a camping trip, they rent cabins and the fishing is good. It's past Manor on 290 to the left.  They have a lighted dock and you can go for cats at night. You can also continue up past Bastrop and find another lake on 290 but I can't remember the name of the place. If you feel adventurous, there are several creeks near that lake that produce big bass. All I can remember is that right outside that lake there is a bait shop.  It's a long ride and it's to the right on 290 on a very small dirt road. You'll miss it if you blink, I know, I blinked.<br>  <br>  Sorry I couldn't remember the roads and names of the places, It's been a while but these spots are solid. I gave up alot of places and probably pissed off some people.If you have google earth, you can use the info I gave you to help you locate the spots faster. ,  Go get those fish.~good luck catchin'.|`|GQfasfjiaa	Have a look at Texas Fly Report.<br>  <br>  They have a forum section which can probably help.

5v1krJWeaa	I also have been using X-Bats as well as other not well known brands. X-bats prove to be the most efficient in games, as quality bats. The bat seems to drop a little when I swing, but that's just me or the model I have. Louisville Sluggers are good when they are priced above $59.99, as these are not players bats i.e Alex Rodriguez, Manny Ramirez. They do tend to break more often then not but the ball does have a better jump. Overall I would go with the X-Bat, but it just seems odd to me swinging wise.|`|ZBCoim4Raa	I prefer the Max bats.  But they tend to break a little more often then other bats I have used in the past.  The company that I feel makes the most durable bat is Old Hickory.  You might pay a little more, but the bat will last and last.

G9LSZQcaaa	Hell Yeah, It would be better but the Ratings would stay the same.|`|E7TkNO00aa	Yeah, he's got the attitude for it. He backs down from nobody. The matches can be more exciting.|`|OGPW7xZ2aa	Hell Yesssssss !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|m68HTA4paa	no
OQEZbPv7aa	I have always found that bridgestone balls work just as well as titelist balls. I use the e6 golf ball. I am 15 and I usually hoot high 70s low 80s. The nike juice is also a good ball for a low price. Have fun and good luck!!|`|32lHJiSWaa	The Titleist NXT Tour is the best out of these except for the Titleist Pro V1. There are some places where you can get used golf balls. So instead of spending $10 per ball for new Pro V1's try finding somewhere to buy used balls and save several dollars on Pro V1's.|`|IRsIdiKJaa	I have some friends that are pro golfers. You might have heard of Bob Estes? Hes a good buddy of mine. Ok. Let's get to what you were asking. I prefer the Titleist. They are a little expensive but they will improve your golf game alot! Hope this helps you out! Good luck in your golf game (:|`|syzMIfLLaa	Ok, everyone is yelling Titleist, but i have another idea for you, you swing hard enough, faster than most average golfers, but your obviously not very consistent and likely loose a couple balls a round.  Your likly hitting really basic shots, or should, so you don't need pro v1's.  try a soft ball like the top flite d2 feel, or a noodle, (the new noodles at wal mart in the card board colored boxes for 10 bucks are actually really great)  Then play a lot!|`|AYkEwqRXaa	The NXT tour is the best out of the ones you mentioned except for the Pro V1.  It's categorized as a high spin ball so that should help you around the greens.  I wouldn't use any of the other ones mentioned except for the Pro V1.  I know you don't want to pay a lot, but sometimes you have to pay to play....well that is!|`|PRx6j6YQaa	let me get this straight you want to drop 2-3 strokes with a different golf ball but you want a cheap one only one answer buy used
GZpwkL1Vaa	thats how football always works in high school in university, you pay your dues when your younger to improve. the reason you tolerate sitting on the bench for those years is to work towards being a difference maker on the team as a senior. those years sitting on the bench are meaningless if you dont play your senior year.|`|1bAFv3Yqaa	if you think you are not going to play you have to weigh that against the positives you'd have sitting on the bench|`|9gIsxKdWaa	No matter what you say will not matter. If he isn't playing the game because he loves it then maybe he shouldn't play. If I were coaching a team and a player had to be talked into playing for me, I'm not all that sure I would want him. If he isn't starting, maybe he needs to hone his skills so the team can't afford not to start him. It's in my opinion that everything in football is earned. If he doesn't have the heart for it then maybe you should let him sit out. Give him a pep talk but the decision has to be his.|`|Xb1R1KOFaa	I also play football, and I didn't start for 2 years. It maybe the same thing for your friend. If he is athletic and good at the position he plays he should definitely give it his all and will have a very good chance of starting. If he isn't very good at his position then maybe football's not his sport and he should try a different sport.|`|hUWGGzToaa	maybe you could tell him that there are alot of ways to become famous and maybe could tell him there are a lot of opportunities to go into college because they look for someone who is really good and he could totally have a scholariship to that school and maybe he could go into the nfl if he is lucky you know...like yesterday i was talking to one of my freinds and he aked the same thing  and i told him all these things and it worked. try it... it will work...|`|O0pb1F3gaa	if hes good tell him if hes important to the team yell at him and if hes un stopable threaten him till he starts playin (unless he huge)|`|n0qG9ptzaa	You could if you want but if you do you could get hurt or break something. My uncle played football and he got tackled really hard and some water got stuck in his head. He had to go to the hospital and get surgery. So if you do play football make sure not to get tackled so hard.
PRx6j6YQaa	wear two pair of socks and tighten the laces very tight|`|3y8YIs3raa	do them up as tight as possible although you should be able to fit your finger down the back of them and always do them up to the top <br>  good luck hope i helped :]|`|EmYNUZcXaa	are your skates new? are they rentals? it could possibly just be your skates having weak ankle support. if they are rentals...then theres not much you can do. but if they are new or yours and the ankles aren't broken down then you should be lacing them so they are snug, and not too tight but then not too loose. tie them just tight enough so you dont loose circulation in your feet. the skate should still have a little give when you bend your knees and squat down.|`|8RCOlWdMaa	There is a special way of doing up skates for comfort and safety. You should lace them firmly round the foot, tightly round the ankles and a little looser round the top - so that you don't chafe your shin!<br>  <br>  Mind you, they are not reknowned for their comfort!!!|`|lnRMmSeyaa	your always want to wear your skates as tight as possible without them hurting, if they are too lose it will be very hard to skate and you could trip and really hurt yourself<br>  <br>  figure skater of 6 years <3|`|A5D62Ycbaa	I've always worn mine as tight as poss, especially round the ankle for support, but I suppose its personal preference|`|akA3oJx6aa	Relatively tight at the bottom, pretty dang tight around the ankles, and the top where you hook them around the hooks shouldn't be too tight, especially at the top. It shouldn't be loose though.<br>  <br>  If it's too tight at the bottom, it could cut of circulation. Too loose would be inconsistent and your foot will move around too much.<br>  <br>  Too tight at the ankle, no circulation. Too loose, you are more prone to ankle injury or falling in general.<br>  <br>  Too tight at the top, no circulation and difficulty bending your legs. Too loose, ankle injury is possible and it will move around in the boot too much.<br>  <br>  DON'T wrap the extra laces around the ankle, go back over the hooks again. As long as you won't trip over them, it's OK. Wrapping them will cut off circulation and knee bend.|`|MjtmHraHaa	It's better to have them tighter in the ankle area, as that's the part of the boot that provides the support.  They should be comfortable for you in the top of the foot.  Too tight in that area my cut off circulation; too loose in the ankle and you may have trouble staying on top of your blades. :)|`|gR2XHU1Faa	Have them tight at the ankles, but loose at the toes so you'll actually have blood left in your feet when you get off the ice lol.<br>  <br>  Are they new skates? If so, you need to break into them, I used gel pads on my ankles to help me skate without injuring myself.<br>  <br>  PS: DO NOT USE RENTALS!!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps?|`|1XiTBn28aa	I suggest very tight, if they are loose, you will end up with severe chafing and blisters. I speak from personal experience - it happened to me two weeks ago. Wearing them tightly also allows for more control over the blades.<br>  Hope this helps and enjoy skating!|`|YhGQ2Omnaa	if you haven't been skating for long, it could be that your ankles are weak.... but i know that you should tie you skates just tight enough so you can fit a finger between your skate and your ankle. :]|`|LBZcfkwpaa	I always do very tight when I go Ice Skating. Hope It Helps!

z7JsVzcnaa	You can start by dressing out. Even if you do nothing else, at least you get credit for that. Then with whatever sport it is you're doing get a ball and throw it around like you're playing. You don't have to play with the kids who are really getting into it. Just look like you're doing something related: throw a football back and forth a little bit, shoot the basket ball, whatever.|`|pC6KstvHaa	Just have fun with it.  Don't take it so seriously.  No one cares what you look like in shorts and no one is going to make fun of you.  If you are bad at sports be super bad and make it funny, just laugh it off. Gym is actually really fun so go for it =]|`|pdu0ZEfIaa	Just live with it! It is very hard to fail gym
QPZrnwP3aa	There were many games we played as kids that I haven't seen anyone play in years, even decades.<br>  1) Jacks. Do you know what I am talking about? Played with 10 jacks and a very little rubber ball. <br>  2) Tiddly Winks.<br>  3) Red Rover, Red Rover.<br>  4) Marbles.<br>  5) Flip Cards.<br>  6) The card game "Old Maid", and about a million other card games that are so obscure they are not played today.<br>  <br>  To give you an idea - I once listed 45 games that was played with a ball. From the biggest (Beach Ball) to the smallest (Jacks) and all sizes in between. Many are not played today. <br>  Good luck with your project.

MR9jlurbaa	Last year they spent $207,108,489 just on their players<br>  But it's very hard to see how much they spend on the ENTIRE team because it's a private company and they don't have to release all of their information, plus their stadium and all that is paid by in part by the city so it is really really difficult to get a number on how much they spend overall on the team.  Payroll is the only solid number we can get.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	100 million dollar bills............................|`|AA11720887	Last year they spent $209,081,579 on payroll. This year is still to be determined. Funny thing is that Tampa paid $43,820,598. Big payrolls aren't always the answer to buying championships. Second highest payroll was Detroit with $138,685,197. Huge difference.|`|BruAqXjDaa	280-310 million. they had liek 220 mill last year, and they spent about 60-90 on tiexera, sabathia, pettite, and the other dudes name? so more like 280-310?|`|8Ph8Rsd1aa	thye just spent 423 million or so this yea|`|AA10274353	waaaaaay to much
