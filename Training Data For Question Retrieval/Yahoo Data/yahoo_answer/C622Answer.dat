2b0a3200c0db672cf39c688cc41d456caa	You're taking it too personally.  He wasn't referencing your current situation, he was referencing the fact that as a baby, you didn't learn to crawl, you went straight to walking.  He meant lazy as in skipping steps and going straight to walking.  Lighten up a little.  Sounds to me like you're afraid people will view you as lazy (which no at home mom is...I know this), and you're projecting that fear into a harmless statement made by your husband.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Overreaction. Why didn't you just tell him it wasn't appreciated last night? He's probably not even talking about you staying at home. <br>  <br>  In a moment of anger my husband called me a parasite when I was pregnant. It really hurt. In fact that child is 18 and I still don't like that he said that to me, but he didn't mean it.<br>  <br>  Talk to your husband about it and let it go. I'm sure he didn't mean it.|`|hOWNwpCLaa	It sounds like an innocent comment to me.  He was probably just saying it in reference to you not crawling.  I doubt it had anything to do with you being a stay-at-home-mom.  If it bothers you that much, talk to him about it.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	You are going to have to talk to him about it. And see what he meant about it. And why isn't he paying you to do pt work at his side business? If he were, then you'd both have a better understanding of worth.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	I think he only meant it about you not crawling. It seems you are reading way too much into an innocent comment, he didn't actually say you were lazy for not working!|`|TiaoTFecaa	Honestly I would have taken it as a rude joke.  Get over it and move on life is short sweetie|`|sAhAEC2qaa	yes my fiance says things like this to me too and sees no proble min it|`|SR1FN2nqaa	id confront him about it if its bothering you that much. dont let it fester and bring you down. the only way to deal with it is to talk to him and let him know how it made you feel . he was probably joking but you never know.|`|jddIJeLWaa	ummm yah my boyfriend of 4 yrs<br>  says im lazy all the time.<br>  <br>  when he is the one who plays video<br>  games & doesnt help w/ <br>  anything<br>  <br>  its a guy thing<br>  they're all a$$holes<br>  deep inside<br>  <br>  its the male gene|`|8s94YE9haa	yea i agree with mrs G. he didnt mean it about your work ethic. he just meant it as a joke about you not crawling.|`|B24KqmgGaa	Whew...you are being way to sensitive.  But if it bothers you that much than tell him.  Im sure he will apologize and not say something so stupid again|`|DRDdUhQ2aa	Men are clueless about how much it takes to run a home,one piece of advice,go on a 3 day holiday,stay with a friend,or visit your family and let your hubby run the home for a change,he just might get an appreciation for all the work it takes to cook,clean and run after little ones.I would also tell him up front that his snide comment hurt your feelings and you didn't appreciate it.Let him know how you feel,communication and open understanding are key here.|`|Xa39FlV0aa	Wow, I think you are reading WAY too much into what he said. He was talking about when you were a baby, you were too lazy to learn how to crawl, then just went on to walking. He didn't say you are Lazy NOW. If it upsets you that bad, ask HIM what he meant. If he is thinking you are lazy now (I don't think is the case), then explain to him what you do during the day. Any reasonable man will understand all the hard work we do by staying home and taking care of the kids.<br>  Calm down, and ask him nicely when he gets home. He may not even remember saying it.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Words always cut deep and honestly I don't think he was saying that you are lazy. He was referring to when you were a baby and not crawling.  If it continues to bother you I would calmly talk to him about how that comment made you feel hopefully he can clear up what he meant by it and make you feel better.  A stay at home mom's job is a job in itself and it's alot of work more work than alot of men realize.  Don't take the comment to heart just talk to him and get your feelings out in the open.
65ojSBXgaa	If you want her back then do it. Don’t lie to your self  I’m sure she realized she made a mistake when she broke up with you. Best thing to do is talk to her in private; let her speak because she is the one that broke your heart then listen to what’s inside her heart. Look at the positive signs: she tells you I love you, she can’t be with any one else but you. I know what you feel right now and you have the right to be nervous you are afraid of getting hurt again and that’s normal but be calm she’s the one coming back to you. Listen to what your heart desires and wants. If you love her you will put things behind you and start all over again. Some times when a partner departs from someone is because they are not ready or are not sure of the relationship (many things) but in your case it looks like it made your relationship & love stronger! Awesome !!!! Sometimes it helps your love grow. Follow your heart and goods luck!     Gail|`|AA11988503	Don't let emotions get the best of you. Make sure this is what you both really want. You're on an emotional high right now because she's back in your life and it's stirring up a lot of old feelings and she's making you feel very wanted right now. But when those emotions fade will you still want her?|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Well the only way you are going to find out is to talk to her and ask her. She is giving all the signs that she is interested in getting back together so why not just talk about it with her and stop wondering how she feels find out!|`|w1kxVQqzaa	IF SHE SAYS I LOVE U IT MEANS SHE LOVES U NOW GET BACK HER AND GET UR GAME ON(UNPROTECTED)|`|AFjehuZ5aa	Words of advise..... If she broke your heart once then she will break your heart again. You can sit her down and ask her what she feels but remember that she may not be speaking the truth to you. She may be telling you what you want to hear and when the time comes she will hurt you once more. Never back step with an old flame. Always put your foot forward and keep moving. Learn from it the first time never the second.|`|jddIJeLWaa	you have to talk to her<br>  tell her how you feel<br>  tell her that you miss<br>   her tell her that she<br>  broke your heart<br>  <br>  <br>  tell her everything if a guy would<br>  tell a girl that in my perspective<br>  i would know that he has<br>  strong feelings for me and i would<br>  be shocked & realize man he realky<br>  does love me & such|`|Wy3wddFlaa	You need to talk to her about anything, your past relationship and how you feel now. you will never know how she feels until you ask her!|`|BbrXZLoBaa	Settle your psychology first. Perhaps by seeking expert consultation if that helps. If not, sit aside, take the players out for a thought and be clear to yourself on what you want your future to be regardless of your feelings. Then put back the reality the way it is and try to think which way fits best with what you want. If you need more input to think realistically you ask people around you and you don't have to say why you are asking. <br>  <br>  I think the problem is not in who did what as much as it is psychological discomfort. No matter how much we like each other, if we can't fit psychologically and feel secure with this person perhaps it may not work for us. There may not be one correct answer but use the fact and add the experience to it, Start with yourself. If you were able to solve your internal dispute , you probably will be able to solve the external dispute.|`|CM0C65dtaa	You will only know if you ask her if she wants to try dating again.  It sounds like she is into you.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Sit her down and talk to her. Tell her you have feelings for her, but you were very hurt by her last time and don't want to be hurt again. Then take it from there.

PujesDcIaa	Well one I'm really sorry and i feel bad for you and two I'm going to help you.  OK so if you have  myspace and he is on you rtop remov him from your top. If you have a song  that reminds you of him find another song that makes you feel better. For example, when me and my boyfriend broke up i listened to so what and it made my day a whole lot better. Another thing is if you have like a nick name fo him that is in your phone change it to just his name. If you have things from him put it away wher you cant see it or throw it out. GET RID OF ANYTHING THAT IS A REMINDER OF HIM! The more you see or hear things that remind you of him the worse it is going to be.

I think what you're getting over is just infatuation. You could try to talk to him, but I wouldn't. At least not now. He may not have accused you of anything, but he may suspect it. Plus you don't forgive someone who's given you an STD...<br>  I say cry it out for now. Spend time with friends, get out of the house. Don't try to see him, don't call him. Just live for you right now, and in time, you might become friends again. And who knows, maybe that will lead to something again in the future.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're getting THAT DRUNK at parties, I'd consider cutting down. Chlamydia is really not the biggest of your worries. And always carry protection in your purse, just in case something does happen.|`|qTm7WV6Taa	well you messed up his life
0c774aaeee4e54a788cc95214c3dafbdaa	Sure you can!  Especialy if you make it clear right up front that you are not interested in any kind of intimate relationship.  We you meet females ask that question the moment your converstions start to become more personal.  If they hesitate or say they not sure they can't make that promise then you need to move on.  In my case I dont want wnay more children after only having one and so I ask up front if the persn wants kids or more kids.  If they dont give a definate NO I know I can not proceed.  It hard to have to let someone your interested in slip away but its fair.|`|2RP20lMjaa	Errrrrrrmmm no i dnt think so if there is then there must be such thing as sole mates lol. <br>  <br>  Ignore the people that have sed get a man thats ridiculous you dont like your body not your sexuality.<br>  <br>  Go on how to look good naked Gok Wan will sort that oconfidence out.

If that person really loves you then she will do anything to be by your side.  Even if it means no physical contact.  I,for example, was in a relationship were I didn't want no physical contact, yet it was a love relationship.  It didn't work out good but it was because my partner wouldn't resist touching me.  The idea here is that if I would've gone out with someone similar I wouldn't mind the "no touching" part at all.  It just depends on what the other mate wants.|`|Mj8EP8bIaa	. . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-‘”. . . . . . . . . .``~.,<br>  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-”. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .“-.,<br>  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ”:,<br>  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,<br>  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}<br>  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}<br>  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:”. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .“~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./<br>  . . . . . . /(_. . ”~,_. . . ..“~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/<br>  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .”=,_. . . .“-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~”; /. .. .}<br>  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .”=-._. . .“;,,./`. . /” . . . ./. .. ../<br>  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..“~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../<br>  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-”<br>  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\<br>  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__<br>  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,<br>  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`|`|BdeoYKokaa	Get a boyfriend.

I have even heard well someone gave it to me I am going to eventually die I am gonna take everyone I can with me. this is just criminal and should be charged with sexual assualt with intent to murder in my opinion. <br>  <br>  If you have an STD that is not curable or is reoccuring it is absolutely your first priority to protect the people you are planning on being intimate with. And get tested regularly for other diseases like HIV and AIDS because having an STD compromises your immune system making you more susceptible.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Yes and No.  It all depends on the person, and how they contracted the illness.  One of my good friends discovered she had chlamydia, which was given to her by her boyfriend because he cheated.  That's not her fault, and beyond her control.  They were in what she thought was a monogamous relationship, and she trusted him.  I don't think less of her. <br>  <br>  A friend of a friend got something else (gonorrhea, I think?) because he was a man whore.  He has no real idea who he got it from, and who he may have given it to.  I think less of him because he's a man whore, not because of the STD, though.  That was just a consequence of his lifestyle.|`|e86df6aeda098a41020c4baf4c81dcddaa	no.<br>  <br>  even if its their fault (knowing they weren't using protection) or if it wasn't (not knowing the person had an STD)<br>  <br>  it's not something to judge...|`|OJXfV529aa	No, my brother has an STD<br>  they just had sex with the wrong person.

2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Our habits and patterns have changed somewhat as a result of 1) moving in together and 2) the passage of time; but I don't think that much of it can be attributed directly to the signing of the marriage license. <br>  <br>  We lived together for over a year before getting married, and it was definitely a period of adjustment for both of us; our social and emotional lives now included each other, and it does change your routine compared to when you are single and unattached. But (for us at least) this change was for the better - we are very happy to have each other's companionship.<br>  <br>  Also, as time goes by, every individual evolves. Habits may change, hobbies come and go, priorities get adjusted. I think, in a healthy relationship/marriage, people evolve together, and this natural gradual "drift" is not a problem. Both my husband and I have abandoned some old hobbies and developed some new interests since we've been together, and it's normal. We support each other in our pursuits, even if we don't always participate ourselves.<br>  <br>  I think, another major point of change for any couple is parenthood; kids introduce a whole new dimension into the relationship. I don't have children, so I have no personal experience with this, but it's something I hear over and over from other couples. Again - this change in dynamics is not something bad; it's a natural evolution of the relationship. <br>  <br>  This is not to say that things don't change for the worse - they do sometimes. But again, I don't believe it has anything to do with getting legally married - it has more to do with general attitudes, dynamics and circumstances of each particular relationship. Laziness, lack of affection, lack of intimacy can manifest themselves in any relationship, whether married or not - especially as more time passes. Given long enough time, I'm sure every relationship goes through a tough stage. I don't feel that the marriage certificate is the cause of that, but being that in our society most long-term couples are married, we naturally see these fluctuations mostly in married couples.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Yes , people change over time.  Cost me 2 divorces.  Part of staying together, is being able to change together, over time.|`|6PhSENcXaa	I've been married 31 years and we're both still the same as we were 35 years ago when we met.  We both still put in a 100% and work together around the house.  We raised 8 kids now enjoying the grandchildren.  <br>  Nothing has changed with either one of us, I didn't get lazy and neither did my wife. I think a lot of couples change as in growing apart from each other.  Their not keeping their love for each going, so it ends up that one does everything and the other just doesn't care and sits back.  That's not good you need to keep the fire burning in your relationship.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	It happened in my first marriage (24 yrs), he turned into a stay-at-home bore who never wanted to have fun.<br>  <br>  But this time, we were straight with each other, no BS and no games, no pretending to be who we aren't. So we knew EXACTLY who we were marrying. We are very happy, too.|`|hOWNwpCLaa	Yes, my husband did change.  He turned out to be much more affectionate, and romantic than I had previously thought, and I can't say I'm complaining...|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	Yes, she and I both changed, we grew and are growing together. Compromise can bring about change in ways that are good for both.|`|5DJcir9saa	I think it just depends on the person.  One thing that changes after marriage is you can no longer just "break up."  If you choose to no longer be together you have to divorce and that usually gets pretty messy.  So some people might feel more comfortable in their relationship and get lazy or show their "true" side.  Or others feel the pressure of, wow this is the real deal and make a big deal out of things that never really bothered them before.  I have to admit, that I was not in anyway nervous prior to getting married, but after the honeymoon I got a case of, "am I really married now?" and it freaked me out a bit.  That subsided shortly after and I have never regretted getting married.|`|qmLjEXlDaa	Things change after your married due to the following.<br>  <br>  1. When your dating the other persons credit, bills, spending is not your problem.  When your married it is.  <br>  <br>  2. Once your married and have a mortgage, kids, work your life style changes and your not spending $150. on dinner like you did when you are single. <br>  <br>  3. Some men think the romance is over.  After the I Do, they don't.  No longer bring flowers, cards, or look to go out on a date just the two of you.   <br>  <br>  If you know your soon to be spouse well enough and are smart enough to have a conversation on who is going to shop, do bills, clean, etc is it wife, hubby or both.  Don't assume that house work is the wife's job and yard work is the hubby's job.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	Here's the deal.  I don't think my wife changed, I think she FAKED it while we were dating.  Then after marriage she got comfortable with the money and the situation and she stopped faking that she loved me.  <br>  <br>  When I searched for a wife, I wanted someone that I respected and I liked as a person.  I wasn't thinking much about future sex.  Well, I got what I looked for, a person who I like and respect and who doesn't think much about sex.<br>  <br>  If I were to do it over again, I'd look for a romantic and sexy woman who wanted a lifetime of sex... and I would go find friendship with the guys.  You can always get friends elsewhere but you're not supposed to go elsewhere for sex.  If you get a dud spouse, you're sunk.|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	Well, my husband and I lived together for 5 years before we got married.  He was the same after we got married as before.  I don't think the change in behaviour has much to do with getting married, I think it is to do with getting comfortable in the relationship and maybe a bit lazy.  At least that is how it is in our relationship.|`|WKtakdsOaa	No we are exactly the same as we met except we dont go clubbing really anymore after having our baby. We still have lots of sex, go places, are affectionate and both of us help each other out. We work as a team and we have always been like this.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	It depends on the person. He and I both did not change after marriage. Some people fake who they are to get a spouse and then after they are married their true colors show. I have been married for almost 16 years and still we have not changed for the worse.|`|45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	Well it may not because they got married. Once you are married other things come into play like stress from money and kids and other things so it can not be said it is only because they are married. It does happen though but not to everyone. IT has not happened to me and my husband.|`|xPeIvywdaa	everyone changes in their lifetime, thats what happens when your in time<br>  <br>  the thing about marriage is, you love each other, and work to continue loving each other even through the changes|`|Xa39FlV0aa	I think any time you are around someone so much, or learn things about them you never knew. No matter what ages we are, we change. Just part of having experiences. <br>  My husband was a lot more calm once we were married. He was more selfish (with his time) when we were first married. He now realizes how that hurt me (he would leave me alone for hours to visit family, when I had no one in a new town).<br>  I changed in a LOT of ways. I learned to stop thinking of only myself. He taught me that even if we don't have a lot, we can still help others. I learned to actually communicate my feelings (we didn't do that well in my family growing up). <br>  Affection changes, dates change, your attitude, the way you think of different situations. But it isn't necessarily bad. In my case, all these changes were definetly for the better.|`|aQB7IJcZaa	Having 14 years in the hole, I can tell you that people change, this is a normal part of growing old, and maturing.  I certainly know that I am not the same person I was when I was 21, so people change, the important thing is that you change together, expand and open your minds and communicate otherwise one goes forward and the other is left behind.  Just my two cents.|`|i15KoiJhaa	My Husband did change... <br>  <br>  He became a better Man, a better Dad...<br>  <br>  I think the commitment we made made him really settle into his life and enjoy the things that make life worth living.<br>  <br>  I suppose I've changed as well... I also feel more settled into my life and happier that he is in my life... and I know it changed our Kiddo's lives in making them feel more secure in the arms of "Family"|`|ygw1KFWSaa	I feel that we are the same people we just grew stronger. You grow so much together. I feel that we are closer now then before we got married. We did change, but in a good way. We changed in the fact that we are older and more mature in our relationship.|`|b03002dca550628194ee370158b39412aa	Things didn't change for me and my husband.  I think it helps if you both have jobs or hobbies so you get a chance to miss each other and cherish the time you have together.  I think it also helps if you live together before getting married so that there are no sudden surprises .|`|KPYQwyeraa	im not married never have been but even in just bf/gf relationships your partner changes during the relationship as you get more comfortable with each other|`|YyVGXt83aa	She did a complete 180.  She started lying, cheating, and spending a ton of money.|`|izJpnOONaa	yes i did... sometimes it has to do with life experiences and  how you handle them.sometimes partners just grow away from one another|`|ALtOHBC6aa	Im not married, but I ALWAYS hear that the males tend to get lazy...|`|SmSJ9uZ8aa	I wouldn't say things change when you get married.  You do settle into a comfortableness. <br>  <br>  I gained some weight and lost all my girlfriends.  My husband has packed on a few too.  I think that happened because I am happy and we both like to eat.  I lost all my girlfriends because when my husband and I first started dating, I spent all my time with him and ignored my girlfriends.  We were in high school.  Now if we got a divorce I wouldn't have any friends because they are all my husbands friends first.    <br>  <br>  We still do the same stuff but now we have even more fun and do cooler things because we have more money.  We go out and ride our dirt bikes, our Harley, go to bars and concerts and hang out with friends, and make new ones too.<br>  <br>  If you hear folks talking about losing the "spark" or putting on a few pounds and that affecting their relationship, they should not have married each other in the first place.  Everyone is going to get old and wrinkled.  When you marry someone you do it because you want to get wrinkled together, to grow old, to have good times, and bad.  That "spark" that happens when you first meet someone is very short lived but if you can find someone who can light a torch with that spark you are truly lucky.<br>  <br>  Marriage should be committing your life to your best friend.  Even best friends change sometimes.|`|zaIPpr9naa	It's funny you should ask! My ex-husband was always lazy and I always did all the house work and worked on top of it while taking care of the kids.....Then I got sick of it and his mother pushing her religion on me day after day! Have you two tried to living together? I would think that would be the best thing to try out first and see how things are from there. Leave dishes in the sink, or your dirty cloths in places they shouldn't be and see if she picks up after you and then complains if your the type of person who is a neat person then you two are a match made in heaven and things will go well otherwise don't get married people don't change for the better they always change for the worse. <br>  <br>  Exp. seeing how your not even married yet and your already asking then something is not right...... already. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps don't ever doubt your self. It's good to ask but you've got something on your mind that's bothering you about him/ her and it's not right so don't go with what you don't want or question....
va4dh98baa	If I have spend a lot of time with that guy in those 6 months then I probably trust.  And the time can be in school or outside of school.  I am definitely shy but I still open up to guys and it takes me a few months if not more to trust them. She probably does trust you if she will tell you that|`|tRNxT55caa	I don't think being shy has anything to do with trusting people. I am very shy myself, but, if a person shows me that they are trustworthy, i will trust them until given a reason not to.|`|SmFVG8eXaa	Yes.. it takes me years to completely open up and be comfortable around people.|`|FSMpMA9saa	as long as you dont do anything to make her not trust you, you'll be fine|`|OGIuahPNaa	If I really get to know him I have no problem, but I can't talk to guys unless they talk to me first and even then I have a hard time saying things. She probably trusts you but she might be afraid that she will say something wrong.<br>  Good luck!!! :)|`|1pL6sg0vaa	i used to be very shy right when i moved to a new school. but i think it is actually pretty hard to trust a guy because you never really talk to anyone. so if she trusts you that is a really good thing. its pretty hard to win a shy girls trust. GOOD JOB!|`|aVbWrsVOaa	if she feels comfortable around you then you must be doing something right. she can trust you of course as long as you don't betray or go behind your back. you must be and awesome guy if she trust you so much :] hope that helps|`|ynWDXyg4aa	ya for me it is hard to trust them, it takes awhile. and its hard to open up to them really too..so if she can do that then she must really have feelings for you|`|UtR6D3UZaa	no some are just more insecure then others some are just looking for a friend while others are wanting a relationship but don't know how to get one or how to act around someone they like.|`|NqTi3sOtaa	its hard to trust anyone. but 6 months is a good amount of time to earn someones trust. i guess|`|OsvD4wJnaa	It depends on how the boy acts and how well I know him.|`|bPDrN9NTaa	as long as we have become pretty close and he has never done anything that would lose my trust in him.|`|7THgBSvfaa	It is hard for me to trust anybody at all..|`|hLozB0MUaa	if i really get to know him, then no i don't find it difficult to trust him

jbPptRhlaa	Well, it all depends on how he acts.<br>  If this guy your crushing on treats it like a date ( Holds your hand, buys your ticket, etc.) then it's most Definitely a date!<br>  But If he treats you like a friend, and takes you too one of those wierd comedy movies(Like StepBrothers, or something) then its probably just as friends.<br>  Chances are that this IS a date. When i guy asks you "to go to the movies with him-alone", then he's probably looking for some one-on-one time with you. You Go Girl! Good Luck!|`|Wju7rLSSaa	Well depends how the Q was asked, an if there was any body language on his side indicating that he liked me, an to be fair, if a guy who knows you like him, asks you out..Then truthfully dose hanging out even come into it? unless its a girl that is your friend an likes you but u just want to be friends, then i say..Make sure she knows your just friends or better still, just say it an if u cant dont mess with her head , cause it will..an just dont go..but if you do like her go 4 it an if its from a girls veiw then again, i dont think even a male friend would ask a femail friend to movies if he did not like her that way! So if your a chick<br>  I THINK YOUR IN THERE ;)|`|rhH1nsPtaa	Depends.<br>  If he is a friend, and does not know that you like him and you are going with other people, it is most likely a casual hangout.<br>  <br>  UNLESS: He is just trying to make you like him so you can be more than friends.<br>  <br>   OR: it is a date.<br>  <br>  OR: it is a way for you to get to know him and him to get to know you so you can be BF/ GF and have a date.|`|vhlORK4Waa	Date......but despite being 21st century woman and all that, I wouldn't take it for granted that it WAS a date, and  would wait to see how the evening developed (thought sitting watching a movie is not exactly made for conversation is it - but then again, saves any akward silences!!)  <br>  <br>  Halcon  :-))<br>  <br>  ps-anyone want to come to the flicks with me? (for our American cousins, British slang for the movies)  :-D|`|HDwu220haa	casual, because when you go to the movies, you can't talk and get to know each other. if he wanted to get to know you better, he'd ask you to dinner or something like that.|`|yVDaoZTpaa	just you guys its a date!<br>  but a whole group just a hanging out thingy.<br>  :)<br>  answer mine?<br>   <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqB2m1s5ugBBAOxQFbdKx7kazKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219122559AAxvaJ0">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|w1kxVQqzaa	DATE U FRIKKIN RETARD!!!!!|`|sNKJDBhgaa	if he starts to finger you, you know its a date.|`|tHwXESv1aa	To some guys, it's just casual hanging out.

KILFoc6kaa	Eh, to each his own.  Why does it matter to you what other people think, what matters is what you think.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	What's bizarre to me is that you ask people what they think of a term, and when they tell you the longstanding meaning of that term, you get upset by them.  Call yourself whatever you want.  Maybe partner to you is synonymous with spouse, but it's not to most people.|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	Gays don`t say I have a domestic partner or life partner, they in fact do say "partner". It is neutral and unbiased. Historically speaking, a wife being a subordinate may be true, but in most relationships today, that is not the case.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Partner is when you don't have a wife or hubby.  I don't know it as any different. <br>  <br>   If your gay, sorry, the other person is a partner. They are not known as a wife or hubby.<br>  <br>  Society has made it that way, not me.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Takes the explanation out of the conversation and on legal forms and anything else for that matter. <br>  <br>  You are completing a form it says "husband/wife" Would it have to say male partner, female partner or partner 1, partner 2? Just makes things too complicated. <br>  <br>  When you say husband everyone knows it means you got married and he is a man. Simple to me really.|`|GeruGGOQaa	While the idea of partnership and 50/50 is a nice fantasy it just doesn't work in real life.  Unfortunately real life requires someone be able to make a final decision.  So no matter how close a partnership some may believe they have in the end 1 person in the relationship still has a controlling interest.|`|AA11988503	Partner doesn't sound as loving or endearing to me. Plus the term "partner" can apply to so many other things, like a business associate or the person you stretch with in gym class. Definitely not a way I would want my husband to think of me!|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	Huh? <br>  life partner and domestic partner are just usually used as reference because either a couple can't or doesn't want to get legally married.<br>  If you are legally married then why not just use the term wife or husband or spouse.|`|88bDvyiwaa	Partner sounds like a pole smoker.|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	It is possible to go with tradition and still be thinking. You asked earlier if people found the term partner offensive. I don't but for my own life I use the terms husband and wife. Personally I look at it as showing that we belong to each other. I have NO problem with belonging to my husband...he has NO problem belonging to me. That was kind of the point of us getting married.<br>  So while I don't find the term partner offensive I do find your attitude to be. What is it with you supposed "open minded" people that you get so bent out of shape at how others live their lives? Oh and btw my gay best friend HATES the term partner. He said that when he gets married he will have a husband.<br>  <br>  Edit: You know what? I DO belong to my husband and he belongs to me. It does not imply slavery as neither one of us is the master over the other. You don't have to look at your relationship that way...no one really cares if you do. But don't act like you are morally superior b/c that's how we view ours.|`|jCMSybAnaa	The term partner isn't specific.  Wife and husband imply that there are roles.  If you choose to look at roles as being functional (think about roles at work if you will) rather than subordinate and insubordinate, it may help.  Also the terms wife and husband imply gender.  I personally don't want anyone to be confused by saying "my partner."|`|p75ZEmjXaa	My wife hates the word "partnership" because that implies cooperation and equality and compromise.  She wants everything her way and will not do anything for me or with me.  I am equally at fault... I am too accomodating and I liked her in control of a lot of things.  Unfortunately I found out the hard way that she didn't like sex.  So, she controls everything so that we never have any.  If it were a partnership she would need (and I would hope, want) to have sex with me and not for me.  Right now she thinks every time is for me... she will not admit to having any sexual needs or wants of her own.|`|jddIJeLWaa	to me partner is like a guy/ bi thing.<br>  <br>  or just someone your effin.|`|G2auAv1Saa	Don't ask what a person thinks of a term and then label their answer as non-thinking, traditionalist and lost in the proper convention and rituals of marriage. <br>  I am traditional and conservative and when I hear the term partner I think of gay couples or an unmarried man and woman. If you are married, to me, the correct term is husband and wife. Far as the term 'wife' meaning ownership by the husband, I believe in the bible and what the bible has to say about marriage and I understand he is the head of the household and I am his subordinate. Back when people believed like this, the divorce rate wasn't over 50% and parents weren't raising their kids alone so I don't think it was a bad thing.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Did I mention finding fault with someone for wanting to call his or her spouse a partner?? No I didn't, read my response again. I respect people have different views and opinions, unlike yourself, and I will not insult them for it as you have. I respect marriage and what it stands for, it is tradition and in my beliefs the term is husband and wife. If you don't respect it, then don't. If you don't want to be head of your household, then don't be. <br>  I didn't come here find fault with you because of the way you feel, you asked peoples opinion. So in the future if you are going to wrinkle your girly panties over someone else having an opinion that is different than your I suggest you stay in your close minded liberal world don't ask for my opinion.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	I don't consider the term "wife" to mean my husband "owns" me in any sense! I'm proud to be called his wife. I think using the term "partner" is a little more confusing as it doesn't specify if you are actually married, just living together, gay or straight. So if you don't want people to know that part of your business (which, why wouldn't you?) than by all means, go ahead and use the term partner. <br>  <br>  Historically, that may have been the true meaning of wife, but we do not live in those days and anyone will tell you that's not what "wife" means.

Like, she's not as religious, and you aren't as wiiild.<br>  If after a while, she doesn't change, try talking to her. Be like, "I still want to go out and have fun.

Although she has had sex was married and divorced she was probably saved after going through all that and realized that she wants to wait until God brings into her life the man she will be married to forever. You leave many earthly pleasures behind in your beliefs porn, gambling, swearing, drinking alcohol etc. they are considered sins because they waste the resources God is giving you and hurt the earthly body he has given you.  And porn sex should be something shared between a husband and a wife. Christians can enjoy life and live a full happy life because in the big scheme of life they are small unimportant pleasures if the skin and the reward you are given in the after life is a promise of eternal happiness and peace. small price to pay not drinking alcohol gambling and Pre marital sex  for a life of eternal Peace.... my family is christian my second husband and I lived together for almost 9 years before We were saved and decided we needed to live the Life God intended for us and our children and  get married from the day we decided this until the day we married we did not sleep in the same bed or have sex. As strange as that may sound it was a small sacrifice that to us symbolized our commitment. <br>  <br>  I think if you watch the Movie "Left Behind" you will really get an understanding were she is coming from emotionally. You can rent it at Blockbuster. <br>  <br>  Good luck if you love and care about her stick it out. will be worth it! Try going to church with her and learn about it and understand her.
3NoQuoWuaa	I have no idea weather or not you are stuck up but, It doesn't make any matter what I think or what any one else thinks. People will be jealous of you for your good grades. More importantly, I seriously doubt every one thinks your stuck up. Some people just like to think the worst about others in an attempt to cover up their own deficiencies. Just stay friendly with those who matter to you and those you wish to associate with. Stop worrying about the others.r|`|nNYBhelGaa	you dont sound stuck up to me at all you just sound smart and there is nothing wrong with that at all... she is probably just jealous (which is a very good thing) so keep up the good work|`|2S2onP86aa	Hmm, yes it is irritating when people don't understand simple stuff.<br>  However, I don't know why they called you a stuck-up.

FWPSzFVhaa	1)  Take a deep breath.  Something like this was bound to happen  (all kids have to grow up)  ;-)   At least it is not as bad as it could be!<br>  <br>  2)  After you are calm- take your daughter out to dinner or lunch - to a neutral place.  Then talk with her (not to her).   And do it as one adult to someone who will soon be an adult.  Explain how you felt and why you felt the way you did at what occurred.  And explain your fears of having something hurt her.  <br>  <br>  3)  LISTEN to her without judgement.  Make a point of just being ears - as if she were your best friend and you are catching up.  <br>  <br>  4)  Come to an agreement at the end of the open conversation on what will happen in the future or what needs to happen.  You have to give her some space to be able to not tell you every single step she takes.  But at the same time, you need to know what you need to know so she can be protected still.   And let her know that even when she is 30 - you will want a phone call from her once a day just to be sure she is ok - and that it is the right of every mother to have that daily call :-)  .<br>  <br>  By being honest in this way, your relationship will transform.   Best of all luck to you and your daughter.|`|2S2onP86aa	Ground her for one mistake?

Say if she is ever leaving the house to go somewhere again she should call you and make sure it's okay first. She may not have known she wasn't allowed, but I'm sure she must have felt after that she shouldn't have done that. After that maybe you could ground her, but not for too long, after all she is just a teenager and they do things like that - plus the long grounding only makes them want to do something like that again in result of anger or frustration from the punishment.|`|0fE4qkPyaa	Ground her for the weekend.<br>  Take her cell.<br>  <br>  It isn't that big of deal really.She sounds like a perfect teen,that just feel under pressure.Tell her how bad it would have been i something happened to her and you weren't able to find her.<br>  <br>  Teenagers do stupid things.Be glad this is all she did.|`|4EWCegiRaa	She sounds like a great kid that made a mistake.

I say you ground her for either Friday or Saturday night, not both.  <br>  <br>  I think it's important you explain to her why she's in trouble and if she makes the same mistake again, really let her have it.  But we all make mistakes and she's a good kid otherwise... don't be too rough.|`|XuoT57Idaa	Why is your daughter allowed to hang out with a 19yr old boy? I have a 17yr old dd and she cannot hang with a 19yr old.<br>  <br>  I guess she is grounded and I would not let her hang with her gf for awhile saying you guess she is a bad influence.<br>  <br>  Being totally good then to go off with a 19yr old boy 1hr away seems like a big change. Hard to imagine there weren't other smaller steps along the way. I guess I would talk with her and see what her reasoning was. It's not the end of the world if this was an isolated incident! Good luck!|`|sy7ytm9Kaa	I can see she broke your trust, but you do not state if she broke any rules.<br>  <br>  I would ground her or take away privileges for a period of time.  It's important she understands what she did wrong, what could have happened as a consequence of those actions and how it impairs existing trust.|`|OJXfV529aa	Uhm okay? One mistake? Dont ground her at all, its ridiculous.|`|xRUZkFU9aa	I can't believe some of these answers and I am sure their kids are NOT good if they just "take their cell away" for a weekend. What does your kid have a cell for to begin with? What  has society come to?<br>  <br>  Well, she obviously broke your trust, so I would just make her do a lot of housecleaning and not allow her out for the month. Once she gains back your confidence, just forget about her mistake so long as it isn't a normal thing.
aITWZoQzaa	Some girls just don't want to see their ex's happy.  Not all of them want to get back together, they just want to make waves.
yQfaj7c2aa	First of all, I am so very sorry! This is a very difficult situation. My in-laws all seem to be against me too -and often it has nothing at all to do with you (it usually seems to be their own issues that get in the way). I would feel very betrayed by my husband and I would also be angry. You are his immediate family now, and even if you had done something to deserve a situation such as this he should have at least stayed out of it. Does he seem truly remorseful? Often, it is more difficult to get over a betrayal such as this if the husband treats what he did in a cavalier way and attempts to justify it. He owes you an apology that is heartfelt and true, not one that is followed by a 'but'... (this only negates the apology). This could be why you haven't gotten over the situation. If he has truly apologized and meant it (admitting his fault in the matter) then I suggest you do some soul searching and maybe talk to a counselor. Often a betrayal such as this brings other issues to the surface (maybe there are other issues in your marriage, maybe somebody else -from your past, betrayed you and you haven't' gotten closure) there could be a multitude of reasons. A therapist will help you to put it into perspective, often there is a lot of shock that goes along with a betrayal like this; making it very difficult to see it objectively and to put it into perspective in order to move on!<br>  <br>  Hang in there!|`|CzNxbsmsaa	You're right,do it for you.This suggestion was passed on to me a few years back and has worked when I've been willing to do it'.If you have a resentment you want to be free from,pray for that person,place,institution,whatever.Do this every day,do it for 2 weeks,.Even if you don't really mean it ,pray anyway.Pray for them the same good that you want in your own life,health,prosperity,security,etc.You will find yourself praying and sincere before 2 weeks are up,continue to pray.At the end of 2 weeks you will find yourself free from that resentment.Good Luck!|`|iPFUJXvpaa	IVE HAD SIMILAR SITUATIONS ---THIS WAS ONE SITUATION----LIFE IS TO SHORT TO HOLD ON TO GRUDGES .ITS NOT GOOD FOR YOU OR YOU'RE KIDS ...WE ALL MAKE WRONG CHOICES ,BUT SHOULD WE MAKE THE ONCE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO LUV SUFFER FOR IT THE REST OF THEIR LIFE....|`|aicgxiYtaa	U DONT..U JUST LEARN FROM IT SO IT WONT HAPPEN AGAIN..TAKE EVERY DOWNFALL AZ A LEARNING EXPERIENCE|`|iaF9ABhnaa	I wonder what is it that they tell you. Its pretty vague on the info that you gave us but most definetly Id suggest to be strong and like the 1st person who responded below....learn from the experience and learn to forgive. Just me nice to them and one day they will realize that you have never been a bad person to them. Now that doesn't mean....allow them to toss you around. This means listen to what they have to say to you and you don't have to agree. Try to say if they are right, if they aren't then just listen and say thts your opinion. Its not easy to forget but you can always forgive. Maybe try talking to your husband about the problem and hearing in in what he has to say. Maybe he's right maybe hes not. Good luck!|`|zaIPpr9naa	He married you not his mother! He needs to tell his mother to back off and enough is enough. Nobody can undo what has been done but you don't need to be treated like crap either. Unless she's paying your bills or you depend on her for anything don't even bother with her whatsoever! Let her come to you. It's going to be hard but wait it out and see what happens, if you need to vent go to your husband and be nice and SWEET so he takes your side back and stands up for his WIFE. <br>  <br>  A son will always stand by his mother but he will also stand by his wife if he loves his wife so keep your eyes open and keep us updated? <br>  <br>  hope this helps?
AA11363680	it would likely stop the thoughts of other girls. Since it's obvious you're not going to have sex with him, and he still has the urge, his mind is bringing up other possibilities.<br>  <br>  Now, depending on the guy, these thoughts of other girls could come back. If he's the kind that always wants more, or what he doesn't have, he may start fantasizing about other women if he's not getting enough from you. Now, enough is by his standards, so even if you do it every day, he may still want more.<br>  <br>  I'd say stick to your guns. You've made this arrangement to wait, so wait. If you decide to do something later, that`s up to you. But don`t feel like you have to. If he`s willing to wait, he`ll wait. If not, you`re better off not being his play thing anyway.|`|JCdBSULraa	No, absolutely not.<br>  If you had sex with him, he would have very little reason to stay in the relationship and commit to marriage.   I know you think he's not that shallow, but believe me, a lot can happen in two years.  Believe me, even the best husbands in the world fantasize about other women, but it doesn't mean they would ever go through with it.  It's perfectly ok to be upset at him for this, it's not excusable, but you need to understand that it's his problem, not yours, and having sex with him can't make him more faithful, only less.|`|TpBHi8S2aa	Yes probably.  It is only natural for humans to want sex.  And if he knows you won't give him any he will at least think about it with others.  But if you did give it to him his needs would be met.  Also something to think about.....  You will learn that sex is an important part of a relationship. What if you wait until you get married and the sex is terrible?  Then you are stuck with him and bad sex forever and you will be wanting out probably.  Its just like test driving a car before you buy it....|`|L3HJ4Gpaaa	Guys need sex every once in a while to be satisfied.  I mean...like need.  If you don't give it to him, he'll just find somebody else.|`|GkCTGTCCaa	sex can cure anything for a guy /ya it could but guys will always fantasize about having sex with other girls|`|p8fpxlQBaa	it should be fine but you're not supposed to|`|abc74a7841250ed8830346d501f162a7aa	he has 2 HANDS I hope ,tell him to use them !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

d29M7lGKaa	Rachel, It sounds like it bothers you a lot about his absence. A young man with benefits, at his age, is only thinking with his di#k. Now he wants to check out her benefits. Try not to feel bad , as I mentioned in your other question, you could get a new friend in no time. I'm sure there is one out there you have already been looking at, so go for it...so kiss kiss,,,hug hug ,,, go shopping, if you know what I mean !!!
KPYQwyeraa	i personally don't however there are girls out there that do|`|auUeI2Vnaa	yes, if they are immature.|`|vz3GtM72aa	depends on how friendly.  like do you smile and laugh a lot? or just smile every so often?  do you look her in the eyes when you talk?|`|hLozB0MUaa	hmmm it depends on how friendly they're being. guys need to be careful to make sure they're not too friendly if they just wanna b friendly because in a girl's mind it can be passed off as flirting and she could end up having her heart broken... be careful (:|`|c3d9621b66bbf4d52837a662d4822489aa	Depends on the girl...<br>  <br>  I myself think everyone is just being friendly and not flirting...<br>  A girlfriend of mine thinks everyone is flirting and not just being friendly|`|tOoJL7sYaa	It depends on what they are doing.

At least I don't.  I have plenty of male friends who are friendly to me.  I'm pretty good about not mistaking that for being flirty.|`|8grZo1E9aa	sometimes it can be mistaken for flirting yeah|`|YbEQ8Wv5aa	no|`|3vxEXXeUaa	sometimes|`|BZiZr4Hcaa	no, not necessarily, it just depends how they are acting.|`|0wf8Q1Raaa	yes|`|FSMpMA9saa	some do, yes|`|7SkQPoeSaa	gawd, thats a gay question. guys are NOT friendly, they are flirty. wow. all of them are. if theyre not, theres only one reason, they are gay.<br>  <br>  so are u a dog or a pig?|`|HRNKJUYuaa	no- they'll think you're nice.<br>  unless the girl is ridiculously over-confident. in which case they'll think anybody that remotely resembles a guy fancies tem, so yes- THEY will think you are tryng to flirt.<br>  :) xxxxxxx|`|LVDV6PjKaa	Yeah and if your too friendly it can get you in trouble...trust me.|`|o6WJDYFSaa	If I like them, I'll wonder if they are... but possibly just because I want them to be!<br>  <br>  If I don't like them in that way, then I probably wouldn't take it as flirting.|`|wvVPMjfjaa	depends if they are friends with the guy or not. if they are friends most times its no.|`|rduazivPaa	I think it depends on whether or not they're your friend and on how often they talk.|`|HKui8pyMaa	sadly yes.<br>  most girls make a bigger thing out of it<br>  so watch out|`|MTPoGd1qaa	some do, if it is a randomer, we think like 'why on earth is he talking to me'<br>  <br>  So ye! sorry.|`|7ohHC4DUaa	yes sometimes|`|z43aCy7oaa	Not really...it just depends how friendly the guy's acting.|`|6Hv8ThWqaa	Depeneds<br>  On<br>  The<br>  Girl <br>  =]|`|ElEUK8fcaa	i usually do|`|032467f7118afdbd53ad18573df6ce42aa	no|`|YsNDkPd4aa	stop being so cool

He could still be gay, thank you very much, or it could be medical.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	And you're marrying this person WHY?<br>  <br>  If he isn't willing to give you what you need sexually, in what other areas of your relationship will he refuse to give you what you need?  Think about it.  He's not just pu**y shy, he's overtly refusing to recognize your needs.  This is the kind of man that, no matter how much he loves you, is going to start ignoring other needs you might have.  The longer you let him get away with it, the more he'll stop caring about YOU.  <br>  <br>  Either let him know that the relationship isn't going to work unless the relationship is equal on both sides, or simply end it now before you get beat down and start to lose your self-esteem.  I know from experience that even a woman who has great self-esteem will start to doubt her self worth when a man thinks he doesn't have to give her what she needs.|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	He may have gay tendencies, and you have the wrong anatomy.

Some can smell very pungent and that can be a turn off. For me? All day long, anytime. I love pleasing my woman.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	My ex was like that and it's most of the reason we broke up. Sex IS important. You went all out for him and he pushed you away...that is very hurtful.<br>  And no, it will not change. I think you should reconsider marrying him.|`|a2390e6e9406ac2ed8d818754e58f0e7aa	He is definitely avoiding you because he is either intimidated by you sex drive or afraid that he will have to perform oral on you or he is seeing someone else or he could be bi or gay.  Maybe he grew up in a home where sex was treated as a sin.  I think you should find someone who you would be happy with.  Find some one more sexually compatible.  Or suggest that he sees a Dr if he is depressed or has low testosterone (which he will not). Good luck.|`|AA11363680	What exactly is the attraction here? You don't seem to have any real relationship at all.<br>  <br>  You say it didn't work with your ex because you had no compatibility beyond sex, but how exactly are you and the fiance compatible? You seem to live separate lives, you just live together.<br>  <br>  And there's more wrong here than a low sex drive. When he is in the mood he doesn't give a rat's *** about your pleasure. He just lubes up and rams it home. He doesn't see your needs as important. If you're honest, this is likely a common theme in your relationship, it's just the sex is the most extreme example.<br>  <br>  I really think you need out of this travesty of a relationship. Let's face it, even if the sex thing is the only problem, you're not going to be able to keep faithful in the long run like this. Eventually his lack of interest and your lack of satisfaction will make you weak at the wrong moment.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck finding happiness, just don't settle next time. If it's not working out like gangbusters, don't advance the relationship.|`|9t1taTCtaa	OMG I have sorta the same problem, except my bf likes sex but the same way and thats it, he does not like new exciting things and he won't let me give him oral sex unless its with a condom, we were also engaged till last week, I just can't think of my sex life going so down for the rest of my life. You really need to think can you live like that your whole life being faithfull?? It is something you need to think about. Good luck|`|3Hm5eJfVaa	If he's 19 and not trying to jump your bones like every 5 minutes there is something wrong. With him not you. Even if he doesn't like to perform oral doesn't mean he doesn't like sex or getting oral. My guy isn't to big on going down on me but he LOVES to receive. We just work around this because he pleases me in other ways. I had to laugh at the comments about him being gay. But I am hoping you would figure that out after 2 years. Has he always been like this? or were you two hot and heavy when you first started dating? Because yes sometime people have sex less often after the newness wears off. I cant help but wonder if he just isn't interested in you anymore but doesn't have the balls to tell you. Or perhaps he has met another. My ex started not being interested in sex and would do it just to get me off his back. He was also not involved as much in my life in general. Turns out he had met another women and was getting his sexual desires fulfilled at her house before he "had" to come home to me. He was always to busy or too tired.  And why would your BF's email be more important then you? Sounds fishy. Maybe he needs to see a doctor about his problem. Maybe he is embarrassed or scared he cant please you. But I have NEVER in my life met a man who could turn down lingerie or nakedness. I don't care if they are 19 or 90. And he should be at the peak of his sexual drive at his age. I just cant stop thinking that something is going on with him that h eisnt telling you. Fix this issue before you marry him or I promise that your marriage wont work.|`|rawz0RJuaa	either he is gay or he is getting it somewhere else.<br>  my husband is not sexually motivated but every 3 days or so it has built up and he will go to town<br>  at 19, this dude should be jumping you at least every couple days!<br>  i have never met a 19 yr old boy who wasn't horny all the time.

If you marry a guy who consistently leaves you sexually frustrated, you are seriously going to regret it.  I recommend you not deal with it - find someone with whom you are sexually compatible.  You sound awesome to me, and I am sure there are some low sex drive women reading this also thinking how great your fiance sounds.|`|orowZaIUaa	There is definatly something wrong.<br>  Perhaps he has troubles with self esteem, self confidence or believes that he lacks in the sac (although clearly he does). <br>  Perhaps he is gay. Try the gay test that somebody above me suggested,<br>  because it seems like quite a possibility that he is just not admitting it to himself yet, and that is why he loves you, but does not initiate anything nor act as though he is sexual attracted to you.<br>  It's one or the other, problem or gay, because normal men will typically hint/say if you are unkept/smell... and if you don't, many/most would be more than willing. <br>  when he went down on you those limited times did he seem into it/ seem to care about your pleasure?|`|onVUS2fGaa	You two need to get some pre-marriage counseling, because this is obviously going to be a problem area for you two. It will only change if you take action to change it, if you leave it alone it's only going to get worse. If he refuses to get help, then you may want to re-think whether or not you want to spend the rest of your life with him.|`|ygw1KFWSaa	If you think he's going to change you're wrong. Different people have different sex drives, and his is low. You can't force it. I think you should really think about getting married to this person.

YraPn46waa	Frankly yes. The fact that you haven't had the curiosity/drive/initiative to have sex by the age of 27 would be a concern to most women.<br>  <br>  But guess what? Every single one of us has flaws that if shared with the opposite sex up front at the start of a relationship, would be deeply offputting. Fortunately, you're not going to be telling women about your virginity are you? <br>  <br>  People will write to you and say it's sweet and charming that you're a virgin - I disagree. Women who say this to you will also pat you on the head, say that you're lovely - and date someone else.<br>  <br>  I suspect that you're a thinker, a person who analyses and tends to watch life from the sideslines, rarely taking an emotional risk. But therein lies the risk; that you're life passes you by, unlived. <br>  <br>  I'm going to make an unconventional suggestion; go out to a club, drink plenty and simply get it over with. Once done, you'll realise how messy, fun and uncomplicated it is. You can hone your skills later - but for now - just take a deep breath, switch off your overactive brain, stop censoring yourself and criticising your lack of confidence and accept that you are as deserving and as capable of sex at anyone else. And just do it.<br>  <br>  Walk on the wild side. It's about time.|`|yJTaBGoEaa	I don't know about other women, but to me it doesn't matter.<br>  When I meet a man, and he tells me he isn't very sexually experienced or he's a virgin, I gain a lot of respect for him. As for your case, you stated you studied rather than hit it off at night, it tells you a lot about a person. To me, you come off as very decent and intellectual. I'd have a lot of respect for you if I was looking to be in a realtionship with you. And you not being sexually active would not turn me off AT ALL, rather I'd be very pleased to know men like you exist =]|`|g8qHXXxtaa	Mate, don't worry. She will respect you alot. And all you do is jig ur hips, job done (Y) i could probably bet if you had sex with the women and didn't tell her you was a virgin, she wouldn't know! :D|`|K6rZmVmAaa	No, just be honest. As long as your willing to learn off the women it will probably put you in front as you wouldn't of picked up any crap habits like some younger men do x|`|UatcpQjraa	ha u ugly
vy2x8khiaa	you're almost completely wrong.<br>  curvy refers to PLUS size women.<br>  who are a bit over weight, and definitely NOT slim.<br>  but yes, their body parts are supposed to be proportional.<br>  like Whitney Thompson, the first plus size model to win America's Next Top Model.<br>  if you don't know her, google her.<br>  if you're referring to women with flabby bellys and gross legs,<br>  THEN you'd have a point. but that's not always true.<br>  i've seen overweight girls, who are, of course, are not SLIM, like you say,<br>  but they're really cute and beautiful.<br>  CURVY, means to have curves, as in HIPS.<br>  but if that's not your taste, then STFU,<br>  and stop ridiculing people. just leave us be and mind your own damn business.<br>  <br>  look at people like Whitney Thompson, Lily Allen, Tyra Banks..<br>  if you think they're ugly, then you should be shot in the face.<br>  <br>  and FYI, NO ONE is naturally slim, with huge breasts and a big "***."<br>  you're a jerk if you think women should look like that to get your approval.<br>  NO one wants your approval, mate, and that's a fact. <3|`|abc74a7841250ed8830346d501f162a7aa	HAHA funny what else are they supposed to say ,another dumb saying is "BIG BONED "haha ,,well for one thing everyone woman is made to have breast period .yet their are some women FAT AND SKINNY that have and I mean have NO AZZ  hence no CURVES !!|`|yDY66mEKaa	yeah, they think their all that, but their not. its really irritating. their all bishes|`|8WYFLp1Baa	Ugh, I agree! Round women always try to make it seem like it's great being fat, and they think it's sexy being fat, so they go around criticizing  all the skinny/average sized women. Curvy is NOT what they should be calling themselves. They just need to call it what it is, Not curvy, not big boned, just FAT.<br>  <br>  They also need to stop squeezig themselves into clothes that are 10 sizes to small for them, seriously. Muffin top is not cute.|`|JCdBSULraa	Seriously, whenever I see the word curvy, I get the mental picture of Rosie O'Donnell.  You would think "curvy" would indicate more than one curve, otherwise they're just round.|`|AA11363680	Why do arrogant people act like they're trying to help?|`|7edl5u1oaa	Yeah, some of them are just plain out of shape! I'm not trying to be mean though!|`|9NfLuHo9aa	if you're a straight guy you got issues, even though u may think it..asking is just a female move son. you gonna get on the internet to hate on a woman? regardless of size..its just wrong son...grow up fast..fat curvy, whatever..woman are beautiful not only on da outside but also on da inside..you dont need a mirror you need to get a life rather than stay behind a PC talkin out ya *** and nope i'm not a woman, just a guy with a mom and women in his family of which all arent skinny but some are "curvy"..damn idiot|`|80AowpkWaa	Depends on what you consider fat. Obviously if their belly is as big as their hips, they're not curvy. But if they have huge hips, huge breasts and a normal/thick stomach, they're curvy.|`|OyWVqe23aa	hahaha i agree!!! and fat bitches say im too skinny and im like ***** lose weight!!! haha|`|OB8KPPIQaa	they are curvy... on the opposite side|`|8AOgHjH0aa	because they don't want to call them self fat
IPj3GRoxaa	I know it probably seems hard to tell them but if you don't and they find out you knew the whole time and never said anything they'll be even more hurt. <br>  Trust me Ive already been through this on both sides of this. Ive been cheated on and Ive known about someone cheating too.|`|w6DJj1a8aa	girl you have been cheated on by two other girls|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	She needs to know. Just tell her straight up.|`|sCr2iTczaa	I would just sit her aside and let her know... but i wouldn't do it in front of Altot of people just so it doesn't make a scene. Maybe if you walk up to her and say i know i don't know you, and then let her know that you know something that she needs to know and ask her if you two could talk privately, and then let her know what is going on.... but make sure you at least have some kind of proof before you do so, just so she won't flip out on you ok. so if you have any pictures, or know the girl, just get something that will show the boy is cheating.|`|AA11596133	NO I would not.  What happens when you stick your nose in to everyone elses business, is it comes back on you big time.  YOU will be "the bad guy" even though it is not true, and all the attention will be focused on YOU instead of on them.  <br>  <br>  I was stupid and told someone that their husband was a cheat - she could even go through his wallet and find proof - what ended up happening, is he lied and accused ME of wanting him, and my husband ended up beating him to a pulp and getting arrested over it.  It was NOT worth it, (she did not believe me anyway) and I will NEVER do THAT again. <br>  <br>  Mind your OWN business.|`|nbBbRFxbaa	Look if you tell her she will think you are hating on her ... Just set the guy up so he takes one of his mistresses , and take her along with you , and surprise his *** . <br>    This way she will see what is going on for herself without you having to tell her ... <br>   Or stay out if it .. <br>  What ever .|`|707gOCvbaa	You have 2 choices? Te her flat out or mind your business. She will find out soon enough and maybe she's aware but some people prefer to turn the other way. Do what you think is best but as humans we live and we learn at our own pace. good luck.|`|G2IoZpeqaa	always a difficult thing to do, I did it one time and my girlfriend didn't believe me we ended up falling out over it, she later apologized to me as she caught him in the act...honesty is the best policy...if it were you being cheated on. would you like to be told...there is your answer|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Unless it's your super close family member (a sister) or best friend, you don't tell them.  Unfortunately, it's none of your business really, and it's up to her boyfriend to come clean.  <br>  <br>  Chances are she knows, will deny what you've told her, and cause nothing but drama.|`|5a6e74148a3ae8aafbeabe8aa23b975faa	A "Double Dear Jane" letter... from a friend.|`|PZGYOjvOaa	write them a letter.|`|3vxEXXeUaa	id just do it..|`|4dXcZhuTaa	just tell her whats up...|`|kb2q03jvaa	jesus christ that is crazy lol. call cheaters the tv show|`|WjZ5Hpu0aa	Take the girlfriend aside, alone, and make sure the situation is appropriate (not at a party or at a place with crowds or too many people).<br>  <br>  There's never a right time, so you'll just have to pick the best time you can. <br>  <br>  Tell her that you care about her, and that you'd want someone to tell you this too, and then tell her she is being cheated on. Tell her that you're there if she needs to talk (careful though, you might end up with a ten hour sob-story every day).|`|Nt1Tz3zuaa	if your friends with her you should just break it her softly because if you were my friend i would want to know, but if your not friends with her you shouldn't tell her or become involved, she might think you're lying or worse think that you're one of the girls! i would say dont get involved unless you have to|`|R3WAqTCHaa	I'd tell her. If you are afraid to get involved, write her an anonymous letter to her locker or her house. Give her all of the details but say you want to keep out of it, just  letting her know.<br>  <br>  That's the only way I would know to tell someone unless you want to just sit her down in person.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Just ask if you can talk to her and tell her straight out what you know it's for her own good that she know.  I know I would want to know instead of continuing to look like a dumba**!  Wouldn't you want someone to tell you if you were in that situation?|`|JScCYZ8daa	i no how it feels to be in this situation , but you really cant say anything because she in to him and it will break her heart but if you don't you will watch your friend be played . the most you can do is drop hints. good luck|`|7SkQPoeSaa	i would say,, <br>  <br>  " hey uhm its hard to tell you, but hes playing u, like a deck of cards. and ur not the only queen. yes, there is two other bitches involved in this realtionship"|`|TDmj9Wsfaa	Ooh. That sucks. I'd just tell her outright. It's going to be painful for her either way, and it's just best that she knows.|`|wi6mkT30aa	Yes, she deserves to know the truth and not be lead on! That's wrong. Please let her know! I'm sure you would want to know the truth, you'll feel much better! GOod luck!|`|FSMpMA9saa	haha text it to her.. or leave a secret note, or take pictures of the other girls as evidence|`|iov5rqedaa	you need to tell her right away but do it in person don't write a note b/c someone else could find it.|`|BdeoYKokaa	I bet one of them is you.|`|YsNDkPd4aa	scream it out loud and then everyone would find out|`|Faetahqfaa	Yea she might want to know about that so just tell her. what if it was you|`|nhzdNEIqaa	LOOK I SO SORRY BUT YOU BF IS CHEATING ON YOU!|`|H3h4j4aKaa	just do it|`|032467f7118afdbd53ad18573df6ce42aa	I would not tell its not my biz|`|Y3hcLQdIaa	theres no easy way to. you just have to be honest and tell her and even after you told her she may get mad at you and not believe you, because she thinks that you like her boyfriend and that your just trying to break them up.|`|cOBsDBgqaa	tell them<br>  there is no other answer<br>  you dont tell them it ends up hurting worse when they find out by themselfs.<br>  they find out that you knew and didnt tell them they will be mad at you<br>  just make sure that you have proof.|`|VFdC2wPlaa	Tell them your sorry, but that you would want someone to tell you, so your telling them. It's gonna suck, and they are probably gonna be mad, but they'll get over it.|`|UFT0WXCwaa	I would confront the guy and yell at him....You dont need to get involved in their relationship at all.|`|41JhpCRpaa	been there, i told the girls it didn't help at all, but if you feel it will make a difference then tell|`|eYa3XnTFaa	Just say it. At that moment she might not appreciate it but she will later.|`|ptcio9k9aa	Yell it out in front of all of her friends.|`|DmFyG1Sraa	tell her, but dont be blunt, but dont beat around the bush. do it in person but privately. good luck|`|AA11237283	its best if u just dont tell them so that time u wont end up being the story teller

tRNxT55caa	If i were to walk up to you and notice a tongue ring, i would think nothing of it, but that's because i am not as judgmental as most people are. Most people believe stereotypes and view tongue piercings as a negative/sexual thing. The opinions of others shouldn't affect your decision to do what you want as long as you are of age to make these decisions.|`|u49dfBkDaa	I'm a 19 yr old girl and i think they kind of make you look a bit slutty (sorry), it's just a stereotypical preconception. But that's what i think when i see a girl with one. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, if you like it then get one. Just make sure you 100% want one before you do it. I think you should listen to your dad though, friends and boyfriends come and go but your dad always has your best interest at heart.|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	You boyfriend has the right answer.  You should do what you feel is best. I'm a huge fan of tattoos and don't really care what everyone else thinks.  You get piercings and tattoos for yourself and not to be socially accepted.|`|JScCYZ8daa	ok i think nothing of it cuz i want mines done to but i had second thoughts about because of today's society . the see you with that the first thing that comes to mind is that she gives head . these days you cant do anything with out people saying something stupid|`|OJXfV529aa	Most people find tongue piercing trashy, and automatically assumer the worste in the person.<br>  <br>  I would suggest something like maybe a lip piercing?|`|YWdNTZU3aa	peircings other than ears look nasty|`|9NfLuHo9aa	plz dont curse me but the way i see it is that its if u wanna give great pleasure to your partner during oral. Unlike a nice earring or whatever, there is nothing cute about piercing ya tongue. I had a girl like that, kissing was wierd with this hard object interuppting all the softness..sometimes it kinda felt cold idk..it wasnt hot at all and not only her i just dont see something inside ur mouth as being cute..sexy cause of what u can do with it but to say oh that looks nice nope...outerbody piercings i can understand but inside your mouth? what you gonna stick ya tongue out whole day? if i saw u with it i would think u a freak (sex not wierd) who likes giving head nothing more or less|`|vhlORK4Waa	You ask how a "normal " person would feel - what's normal - you can't tell anything about a person from clothes - I look corporate all day, yet my faith is rather unconventional, but you would never know unless I told you!  <br>  <br>  However, if you had your tongue pierced, I wouldn't think anything worse of you as a person, it's up to you. I might ask you why you had it done, and you wouldn't get a job in certain industries for sure!!  I'm not saying that's right or wrong, but it is a fact.<br>  <br>  Some people will think it, and therefore you by default, are trashy when they see a tongue piercing. Some people will think you're trying too hard to be cool (tongue piercings were so 1990's), other won't care.l<br>  <br>  It depends how MUCH you care about either other people, or your career prospects...like I said, it SHOULDN'T make a difference, but regrettably it does. It makes a statement about you....you have to ask whether it's one you want made.<br>  <br>  Conversely of course, you can have it done, and take it out as you get older, if you tire of it. It plays merry hell with the enamel on the back of your front teeth, hurts really really badly when you have it done, and you won't be able to talk properly or eat at all for several days afterwards.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, enjoy!<br>  <br>  Halcon<br>  <br>  ps  - a lesbian friend of mine says it's rather good for umm,...can I post this phrase.....well use your imagination......!!!|`|i1Qd4BeNaa	I wouldn't get it. Most women who gets tongue rings get them to do "special performances." But some people get them because they think they look cute. If you truly want it, no matter what people think, then I say to go for it. But I wouldn't. It's just not something I would do.|`|jbPptRhlaa	Meeh, do whatchu want.<br>  It'll get infected real easily though.<br>  Man, i always wanted to make-out with someone who has their tongue pierced, it'd be sweeeet.<br>  But it doesn't hurt my friend has it and she said it's fine, you just have to take care of it.

I've never actually met a girl or woman who has had one. The only time I see those piercings are on porn movies. Not a good recommendation is it?<br>  Although tattoos more acceptable now, piercings aren't. Most tattoos. are usually hidden, under clothing.<br>  You have to realize that having your tongue pierced will put out a message of what kind of person you are, whether or not, that is the real you.<br>  Many employers,won't hire someone like you. As it will make a bad impression on many of their customers.<br>  So think very carefully, as it seems you are doing now, about having it done.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Unfortunatley, there is no such thing as normal. But as a professional adult, I think that facial piercings are tacky, trashy, and well, stupid.  Tattoo's are fine, as long as you can cover them when in professional environment, but anything that is visable limits you from any real "grown up" carreer.  Your father is right to an extent, but I think that it's not just girls that should not be all "tatted and pierced". The same goes for guys.  People perceive you as irresponsible, and immature.|`|AA11363680	I think the most common first impression is that the girl is sexually active. Not necessarily that she's a total whore, but that she has an above average sex drive at least.<br>  <br>  This may be a stereotype, but that impression hasn't been helped by the girls that actually do get their tongue pierced for sexual reasons and are quite vocal about it.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend you give it some serious thought.|`|dQCZDAqgaa	as easy.|`|xy9JYtkTaa	crazy a*ses.

The same thing happened to me, just date the other guy since you really like him more...
L52KUW3daa	I must say, you two sound like you'd be an adorable couple.  The thing is, she seems very hot and cold.  Or rather, she seems like she can't make up her mind.  One minute she's practically screaming, "I WANT YOU!" and the next, when you reciprocate her feelings, she seems to be saying, "i want you, but i can't do this."<br>  <br>  I think what you should do is you should have a conversation with her about it.  try to see if she'd be willing to give it a shot because you really care for her.  and most importantly, find out WHY she's afraid of falling in love.<br>  <br>  Some people, like me for example, are very afraid of being in a relationship because they're afraid of something bad that's happened in the past to happen again.  If it's something like, "I've been cheated on," then reassure her that you'd never ever cheat on her.  and that you'd always let her know where you're going.  If it's something deeper, like, "I have a wall up," or something of that nature, then tell her you're always there for her.  If you really liek this girl or even love her (I think you do because you said you'd spend your life with her) then showing her how amazing you can be will draw her to you.|`|6xwXf3tEaa	If you really love her, and do want to spend the rest of your life with her, you gotta give it all you got. Put your heart on the line, and show her how much she means to you! Come on man! Be a hero!|`|AYy9da7laa	i dont know, there is a lot going on here that is not making sense. i don't think it is a good sign if she is afraid of a realtionship/feelings, when girls want to be with someone, they will , as the same with guys, there are no excuses. <br>  also, don't tell her you miss her so much unless she misses you, it looks kind of pathetic. sorry, its harsh..just trying to help.
XuoT57Idaa	I agree with your Mom. Don't talk daily. The more you "chase" her the faster she will run. Just take a step back and give her some space. Try not to sound needy or clingy. Have activities in your life that you can chat about with her. Don't always talk about your relationship and where it is going or the phone calls could cease. As long as she is willing to talk on the phone, you guys have a chance. Good luck!|`|w1kxVQqzaa	SHE NEEDS A BREAK LEAVE HER ALONE THAN SHE MIGHT COME BACK JUST PLAY HARD TO GET AND SHE MIIIIGHT COME BACK MIIIGHT!!!
AA12384954	Hi again.  <br>  <br>  Hope all is well.  <br>  <br>  I did answer your question, although you posted it in Small Business, so maybe that upset some people.  Please check again for my answer - I actually gave a good one I think.  I gave some examples for myself, and some I knew.  Didn't see any really rude replies, but maybe they have been deleted by now, or quite possibly I have become immune to some of the comments by the trolls out there in Yahoo Land.  Often nick names are in total contradiction to a person's character.  I have been called :<br>  <br>  Bright Eyes, by "Big Bubbas" Keith<br>  Weasel, by "Ferret" Shane <br>  Janet Off The Planet, by "Storm" Norm<br>  <br>  and I don't see anything there that really describes me, except maybe Janet Off The Planet, and I left him a long, long, time ago!  Ps. I am well and truly old in the tooth what is left of them) now, and the above is 30 years of nicknames, but why did I think I needed to say that ...<br>  <br>  Cheers "Lefty" and let us know what sweet name is uttered by your gf!  I hope it's not Roger, as us Star Wars fans here would be calling you <br>  <br>  "Roger, Roger" all the time.
f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	What should you do? Stop being a douche!  If you want to date many people then don't lead a girl to think that you are seeing her exclusively and remember if it's ok for YOU to date other people then it's ok for her to date other guys and then... what's the point? You would both be seeing other people and that's hardly special is it?   If I was her I woulda kicked you to the curb. Either you want to be with her or you don't, you can't have it both ways.  <br>  <br>  I love how you say "try out other girls" like they are candies or something.|`|HJrTuihcaa	Okay, I don't blame her for not taking it right. But you did the right thing to saying that you could take a while off, but the bad thing you did was you said to come back to her if you didn't find anyone. That kinda hints at like "oh, I want to see if I can find someone better then you and if i can't then you will be fine. "|`|cgQrQSvDaa	i dont blame her you lied to her for one thing she probably will never trust you again. I'd say all you can do now is move on.|`|ndZiyvWRaa	Well she's obviously hurt because you basically told her to her face that you wanted to do things with other girls then come back to her after everyone else.<br>  <br>  I don't think many, if any girls, would take that well.|`|TrEYixLXaa	You shouldn't of LIED.  Honestly is the best policy.|`|yyvcryrbaa	you lied & now you want to break up with her. tell her you're sorry.|`|o6WJDYFSaa	Ok, if a guy said this to me, I'd be pretty annoyed too... Girls want confident guys... And ones that don't say that they want to "take a little while off so I could date other girls, then come back to her"... It makes it sound like you want sex with lots of girls, before you commit. Turn off.|`|6xwXf3tEaa	2nd, and last gf if you say something like that again! Seriously tho, I kno where you are coming from-you want to test the waters before you get heavy with the relationship. From what you said, tho, I'd say its over. Looks like you will get to meet other girls, but I doubt ur as happy as you thought you'd be....|`|ghtRbCdnaa	she is not a toy man!! what where u thinking?? if u love someone u know it and u dont need 'experiences'!! u obviously dont love her and u just want to know that someone will be w8ing for u in case u wont find something better, ur pathetic.|`|8mYH1kuOaa	no wonder she didnt take this well!!! how much more hurtfull could you be!!!! the damage is done, shel not trust you. consider what you want from this relationship, you cant really go back on your word now!|`|pM4OJ4iwaa	no wonder she didn't take it well you are practically leavin her for another girl....that is not a good way...but if you are going to feel tempted with other women then maybe you shouldn't be dating|`|Gdyvdcqxaa	are you serious!?<br>  saying "lets take a break so i can make babies with other girls" is COMPLETLEY whack|`|QUmqfjSuaa	**** her, lls.<br>  she doing all that, so it's whatever =]
TrEYixLXaa	She DEFINITELY likes you and yes she is flirting with you :]|`|5BOV76bmaa	John, you already posted this|`|YUjVFkocaa	Sorry this is a guy, but:<br>  <br>  1) its flirting<br>  2) not only that, but its not mindless flirting, shes actually really pressed over you<br>  <br>  3) girls who are this openly pressed USUALLY have at least slight confidence or social issues... and she is VERY LIKELY to move on to somebody else at some point.<br>  <br>  4) With #3 said, you HAVE to make a move quickly!  She is 100% PRESSED right now, and the last girl I was with like this, we had sex within a couple weeks!  SOOO get it while the gettin's good... while shes completely on your nuts, ask her to a movie, just to your house when ur parents are out, to drive with u somewhere, etc.<br>  <br>  Make sure that its someplace fun, but also where you can "snuggle" and things can happen, and sparks can fly.  The girls who don't OPENLY FLIRT LIKE THIS (which is most girls) usually prefer to go on a more ACTIVE date, and one with of course less kissing on the 1st date....<br>  <br>  but a girl like this is just waiting to get down and dirty, so keep your A game up, dont act 2 much like u like her back lest she get bored, joke about her a tiny bit to make her like you more.... but also, be talkative, funny, and flirt with her.... and when it comes time, dont be afraid to look her in the eyes, put ur arm(s) around her, smile, and kiss her as you're talking, or rite after you say a good line.  (This should lead to making out)<br>  <br>  oh yeah- have good breath! look good and smell good (but not too strong) that night! brush yo teeth! drink lots of water! make sure your lips arent chapped!<br>  <br>  good luck, son. best answer please! lol|`|K8OjmMUAaa	It's a lot easier to be open online than it is in person. I'd say that she's really hinting around at liking you. Next time she says something like that on messenger, just take her up on it. Say something like "Yeah we should, I bet we'd have an awesome time!" or something like that.|`|DXLfbKUBaa	Seems to me that she has giving you enough opportunity to ask her out, so yes i would say she is flirting, so if you want to ask her out then the ball is in your court|`|yDY66mEKaa	definitely!|`|AA11596133	Either that or she is just a tease.  Take her up on it and see for yourself.|`|eLRQal4Raa	Yes it is flirting, and she is really interested in you!<br>  <br>  Some people feel more confident talking on msn, as you can't see them and it's less intimidating. <br>  <br>  So the more you two get talking when your not msn, the more comfortable she will feel around you. So get seeing her more often, and ask her out to the cinema. She's really interested in you so why not? <br>  <br>  Good luck! x|`|HJrTuihcaa	She's hinting that she wants to hang out. After she says that next time be like, or we could see a movie instead(:. that would be cute. But some girls are just really out going on the computer because their too shy to talk to you in person.|`|tbKoPNbDaa	most definately its flirting but shes shy you should ask her out in person! <br>  good luck :)|`|5ypdHLtGaa	yeah she clearly likes you and wants you to ask her out. She's probably just nervous around you cause she likes you. She'll get over her shyness when you guys hang out more.|`|K6rZmVmAaa	Definitely :) x|`|cgQrQSvDaa	yeah she is hinting to you that she wants to hang out. ask her out sometime.|`|LjV0MTQYaa	it sounds like she may like you. Some people feel more confident online and that's probably why she's shy and quiet around you in person, but it seems like she does flirt with you.<br>  <br>  Go get her ;)|`|OnX0kfNpaa	Sounds to me like she is flirting, maybe you should make a move lol|`|jbPptRhlaa	Kay, she is DEFINITELY flirting. and im positive she likes you. and normally on MSN people are more confident, when there NOT face-to-face. Like on msn if she says something embarassing then she can say "Oooops, that was my little brother" to cover it up. but in person, there's no such luck.<br>  And if you do like her, Tell her you're interested. She'll be thrilled! Then aske her to hang out, and get some alone time. she'll be much more confident around you after that .<br>  Good luck, Hun :)|`|OyWVqe23aa	its alot easier for girls to not be shy when they arent in person because they can have time to think of what they will say.  i think she likes you she just needs to talk to you more in person to get more comforitable.|`|va4dh98baa	Yes I would consider that flirting.  For some people it is just easier for them to flirt with out the person in front of them.  She will eventually open up.  But if you like her too then you should make a move.|`|ALtOHBC6aa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApSUB01CUqRLex3ZK2P7yWXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219123321AAI4R9a">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  come on girls answer the lad's question.|`|8mYH1kuOaa	definatly! she is just embarrased to say it to your face, therefore msn is much easier! you do your part and break the ice with her face to face, shes waiting on you to do that :)|`|tHwXESv1aa	Yes she's flirting. Or maybe a schizo? Flirt with her in person and see how she reacts and responds.|`|AlTL4kEwaa	heck yeah!! <br>  <br>  girls do it all the time we say things on the computer or through a note that we wouldn't dare say face to face.<br>  <br>  she really likes you GET A CLUE!!! lol <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|wi6mkT30aa	Well it sounds to me that she is being cutesie, sweet, funny, and flirty with you! =)<br>  <br>  That's sweet, Good luck!|`|QP975trWaa	Yeaaah!<br>  <br>  = )|`|AA10081728	yes, she is flirting with you. She probably is very shy but on MSN it's easier, ask her out!!|`|OJXfV529aa	Yes, ask her to hangout.|`|ghtRbCdnaa	jus ask her out at a movie or smt she likes u for sure. trust me.|`|rulABcARaa	your yummmmmmmy <br>  yah , she is flirting x|`|lNjoI4QMaa	hell yeah my ***** BEAT DAT BEAT DAT|`|S4VVE0onaa	yes and she really wants to hang out with you|`|g8qHXXxtaa	That's not flirting mate. But i'd bet my money she liked you :)<br>  <br>  If she's shy with you round school "GOAL SCORED" you've hit jackpot mate, compliment her, your dominant, you show her she can be herself round you, go up to her and say heyaaa and hug her or just "heyaaa" and smile and then tell her you like her later on.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped - even though i'm a male.|`|QsL33Gylaa	ya ur getting hints. just make sure not too rush on them, go at the pace she is, like flirt back if she jokes about going out you should joke about going out too, but keep it at the same level until it feels like shes really really putting the flirts on. just dont flirt with her at a higher level.<br>  <br>  u can email me if u still are confused|`|46EXjDgLaa	yes she does lyk u cos she doesnt want to look stupid in front of u so she says it wen she cnt c u n u dnt c her tht way she can tell u how she feels. also she myt of bn heartbroken b4 n she myt not want to get hurt so she is tryin to tell u she wants to be wid u bu she doesnt want to get hurt.<br>  i no this cos i no ppl tht r lyk this so u shud tlk to her find out wot she wants bu dnt hurt her.|`|WjZ5Hpu0aa	Whoa! I'm -exactly- like that. I'm this really witty person (har har) on MSN and then I freeze up completely around my crush.<br>  <br>  It is flirting! Or, she could just really like you and want to spend more time with you.<br>  <br>  Either way, it's a good thing! You should try to get to know her better. (:<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4juunPpoaa	Awwwwww :) It sounds like shes got a lil crush on you:) <br>  She's hinting she wants to meet up and do something with you. <br>  If you like her invite her to town or something :) <br>  But if you don't like her, don't lead her on by flirting. <br>  <br>  Good luck deary :D|`|xiK7347Eaa	Yes, definetly (: <br>  or she could just want to be friends.<br>  just go ahead and ask her <br>  dont be scared.<br>  girls like guys that tell them how they feel.<br>  and please for the love of all things holy,<br>  dont get someone else to do it.<br>  confidence is key :D|`|iup3ZrS7aa	totally flirting! its alot easier talking on msn than it is in person, especially if your shy! just go full force and plan something with her! and make it happen. just give her time to feel comfortable around u andget to know each other!|`|OVL6FZg8aa	Yes, definately.|`|JpyjecHuaa	im like that too, cuz in real life, its more ... i unno<br>  just make her feel comfortable around you when your talking to her<br>  and when you know shes flirting, FLIRT BACK =P|`|0PPgi8xpaa	YES!! im am soo like that i can flirt with a guy om msn or texting but am VERY shy and quit in front of him<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|A4CELh8Xaa	she doesnt know what to do or say around u in person she likes u but its easier for her to express he emotions writing cause she can think if its really what she wants to say before she does she doesnt wanna say the wrong thing|`|oiseJcBoaa	Yeah, no duh! If a girl says stuff like that, make a move.<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|Gdyvdcqxaa	SO FLIRTING!|`|HZ5oY0sOaa	(I'm a girl, I just like the name Alphonse.)'<br>  <br>  It sounds like flirting to me.|`|OB8KPPIQaa	ya|`|xPw1pJB1aa	She definitely has a thing for you.<br>  Since you like her so much, you should ask her out.<br>  I bet she'd be really happy.|`|KSDsVhc8aa	mmmmmhmmmmmm, i'd say she likes you :) x|`|izrX9Lveaa	just ask her out to help her out a little she's just shy that's all she is having a problem expressing her self to you in person because it's much easier not to do it face to face or on the phone so I do consider this flirting unless she thinks your gay and wants you to hang out like girls do who really know right,just ask her out or talk to her about it or you'll never know if she is really flirting with you or not.Good luck<br>  by the way do not think i'm saying your gay please do not be offended by that.
FmvnC8keaa	It doesn't really matter, but there has to be some physical attraction. I would say maybe the woman because usually guys only ask out those who he is interested in, and usually women are not the ones to ask out the men. It could be vise versa though.|`|QYA2dWmTaa	It depends at who is looking at the couple, I think.<br>  But, I'm a woman, I think the woman should be more attractive.<br>  She spends more time on looking good for the man, she should<br>  get the fantastic credit and compliments. (:|`|rM9Oqy68aa	The woman would argue the man is and the man would argue the woman is.|`|umoK1CMBaa	Depends on if you're a guy or a girl.|`|4e5b3604525939a6fa0e40c9b5f5bf7aaa	the most attractive one will be the one with the most friends, hot clothes, cool ride and the most money. The one that others will envy.......don't tell me I'm wrong....|`|mTFfFZCnaa	Woman of course. Not because I'm a woman but because simply we are attractive.|`|dQh1YzV0aa	woman, cause when a girl dresses up. its not to impress you its to impress other girls that might be there|`|h8mTcbjIaa	woman|`|JpyjecHuaa	women =P|`|Vka09geaaa	woman kus we are amazing hehe :)|`|5ggdqEsLaa	erm i think the woman..|`|BdeoYKokaa	ME|`|3ByYhstxaa	female becauce she has the big boobs=)|`|VFyERjSSaa	IDK it depends on if ur the boy or the girl?|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	Woman.|`|abc74a7841250ed8830346d501f162a7aa	ME|`|qRM0r7eVaa	The woman..so many hot women with ugly dudes its rarely vice versa.|`|7THgBSvfaa	The woman..duh|`|3vxEXXeUaa	the woman fo sho|`|qcs33X6naa	Man|`|iLQ87NSUaa	i think it depends. but i remember reading a study that said a relationship is more likely to be successful if the woman is more attractive than the man.|`|GOUgocyAaa	woman because men base stuff more on looks and women base it more on personality when looking for a partner.|`|UxbjvAaRaa	It can go either way. <br>  But i think the guy is more of the like 'woohoo shes hott!'\<br>  And the girls are more like 'he is so beautiful/handsome.' :D|`|d5dKlgEPaa	The women. Though it may not seem it, men can be more shallow...they don't act it but when it comes to dating, they are more particular than girls are|`|bjuVcxN8aa	If the guy is looking better than the girl, then he is definitely batting for the wrong team.<br>  <br>  He's gay!|`|61xjSkboaa	it depends, if im in it, its me  :P<br>  <br>  but really, its the woman|`|73Qzi3vVaa	Both with enough make up or vodka.|`|QP975trWaa	why can't both of them be attractive :S
3NoQuoWuaa	Well perhaps both. It is her house and the boys are her sons so she is entitled. She might also be asking for trouble but consider she may be an avid naturalist (nudist) and raising her sons the same way. These people don't believe the human body is "dirty" " and while they enjoy nature, they make it a point to not be "exhibitionists" outside the home or the nudist camps.r|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	I think it's weird she's going into a 6-7 year old's room with no shirt on. <br>  It IS extremely strange.|`|4EWCegiRaa	Unfortunately, there's no way to stop ignorant people from having kids.  It's her choice to ask for trouble but there's nothing he can do about it.|`|xRUZkFU9aa	She's a pedohpile in the making.

AA10874773	your dreams are projecting your feelings for him!  its what your subconscious really wants!
Gdyvdcqxaa	dump her! if she wants to cheat, dont let her.<br>  OR<br>  tell her this in PERSON:<br>  "WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF I STARTED CHEATING ON YOU WITH MY FRIEND?! YOUR AN A$$ AND NO ONE EVER SHOULD CHEAT! YOU MODA FUKA!"<br>  <br>  hope this helped XD|`|707gOCvbaa	She would not lie if they were only friends. I think she has feelings for this guy and now you are sliding into the number 2 slot. Confront her about the mall issue and if she gets tiffy then I suggest you dump her because it's only a  matter of time before she gets the guts to leave you. 4 yrs is a long time but sometimes people outgrow their current situation and out of habit refuses to leave. I think she wants you to break it off so she feels less guilty. good luck buddy.|`|1c76b6914c5a81657e108fb7a9d57143aa	Maybe shes lying to you about hanging out with her guy friend because she knows you'll be upset about it. If she acts like shes not with you around him then obviously you should dump her because she likes the other guy.|`|kb2q03jvaa	talk to her about how you feel, if she wont listen stop talking to her altogether. wait and see what she does, if she doesnt call you for a minute, call her and ask her why she hasnt called you. trust your instincts, if you feel like she has been with that other guy and she has given you a bad excuse/lie then confront her about it. if she refuses to cooperate then tell her that it is over and she can finally be with that other guy. then move on and find someone else or enjoy being single.|`|PZGYOjvOaa	i dont know dude, sounds like she would rather be with him. tell her how you feel. if she knows it makes you uncomfortable and she continues to do it , she does not really care about your feelings or you for that matter.|`|TrEYixLXaa	BREAK UP WITH HER.

izrX9Lveaa	you just have to tell him that your shy and your sorry but you don't mean nothing by it you just need to get used to being with him,I'm the same way so I understand where your coming from.|`|707gOCvbaa	Life goes on. Either you are ready to go back into the dating world or you're not? I do not think you are really that afraid of holding hands but you are very sensitive to other peoples energy and it overly excites you. Try rubbing your hands together very quickly and then hold his hand. Turn it into a joke and ask him to do it before you touch him. If he should happen to ask just say you shock people sometimes and it helps to rub your hands. Do not cheat yourself out of happiness. good luck.|`|LqLs6otzaa	It depends on what you mean by shyness.  If you mean you aren't wanting to sleep with him, then please be a prude.  I wouldn't want a guy who only wanted me if I would "put out". <br>  If you are just insecure because of the other relationship, realize that this guy has apparently seen something in you he likes, or he wouldn't have asked you out. <br>  Be yourself.|`|9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	Give him and chance, and if you're really worried - be honest.

You just have to let your self go.  Think about it this way, do you want to lose him? NO.  So, just tell your self you HAVE to get over the shyness & you will see, little by little, you will overcome it.  Hope everything works out =D|`|032467f7118afdbd53ad18573df6ce42aa	just be up front with you and if hes a real mature guy he will understand help you break out of your shell|`|WwVHWz5saa	Oh I'm the same in relationships. For like the first few weeks I can't even hug them back or initiate any hand holding or anything. If you can, try to talk to him about it. I know it's embarrassing and stuff but he might be worried that you don't like him, and you need to set him straight. My ex talked to me about his concerns so he asked me after the second date what was up and I explained all. It'll be harder to bring up the subject yourself I know. You will feel much better onve you explain. And give it time, after a while you'll wonder what all the silliness was about (:|`|ze4Gt1araa	I'll say forget about how shy you are if you really like him it'll go away just grab his hand. And also, tell him that your a shy girl and that you need a little bit of time to have to get to know him more before that occurs.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope this helps! :)|`|uM8O5Q5maa	Just let yourself out of your comfort zone. If you don't let anything happen and keep rejecting him then he's just going to get tired of it and break up with you.|`|uUqPOppoaa	You may be not over the other guy, It really depends :/|`|AA10081728	That will happen in time.....or talk to the new bf.|`|YsNDkPd4aa	go see a doctor and tell him what is going on|`|Gdyvdcqxaa	get to know him! ask him his fave color and see what u have in common! :-)
NupISjnRaa	WHY IS HE STILL YOUR BOYFRIEND?|`|YraPn46waa	Gut instincts are usually accurate but ask yourself if you have a tendency to get jealous or dramatise situations and if you;ve often felt left out in the past.<br>  <br>  Having considered your own neuroses, here are the signs you should be looking for:<br>  <br>  Does he talk about your friend a lot / bring her name in conversations for no real reason?<br>  Is he tense or nervous when she's around?<br>  Does he gaze into her eyes, or do his eyes follow her around?<br>  Is he constantly teasing her/making fun of her?<br>  Do they stand unusually close to each other without even realising?<br>  <br>  A quick test: casually refer to her boyfriend and mention how much she fancies/loves him. Watch his face - does he seem upset or irrationally angry/iuncomfortable at the thought of them?<br>  <br>  Finally, your friend may say she doesn't fancy him...but she is texting him back. She must be giving him some degree of hope. Be careful. Be sure that you can trust her.<br>  <br>  Should you consider all of the above and find that none of it relates to your situation, ask yourself why you are plagued with jealousy. Those text messages he erased may have been about you and him...and have nothing to do with your friend.
m3Y3KkRmaa	Get really close to him by giving him a hug. Then look up into his eyes. Say a small comment (maybe a complement) making your lips closer to his. And then he will get colser and you'll both be close enough to kiss :D!|`|YANN4mXNaa	If he's your boyfriend then you could ask him if he was planning to kiss you before you reached retirement age or was he waiting for you to kiss him.<br>  <br>  He should grin and kiss you.<br>  <br>  If not, kiss him.|`|EyaqiWPwaa	you should make him a sandwich ...then you can kiss him|`|OhQHvBCCaa	while hugging him<br>  brush your face against his, keep on touching him above the chest<br>  keep on getting really close to him aswell<br>  hope i could help <br>  <br>  :)|`|hLozB0MUaa	idk i have the same problem. if u find any good ideas please send them my way (:

For example, you said that he likes to sing.  Does he sing in public?  Do a little research, find out what he does.  If he sings in public then after he's finished, walk up to him and tell him that he has an amazing voice.  Follow up with what type of music he likes?  If there is chemistry the rest will happen on its own.  However, be warned.  You're rather young and there is nothing that hurts more than a broken heart.  Take care and good luck.|`|clnFe3aCaa	if i were u i would like by accident(but not really) bump into him and then tell him that u r going to school with him and ask him if you could hang out and stuff like that<br>  <br>  boyz like prettyness in girls also the way they look after them selves and stuff like that u have to show out u'r good stuff and hide u'r bad ones|`|iLKnmyAMaa	Since I don't know the person, it's hard to tell what guys like him like in girls, but just be yourself. <br>  You can try sending him like a bumper sticker or comment on a photo of his on facebook to grab his attention. <br>  However, to be honest, I don't think it would work out. Besides, he's a lot older than you, when you're going to be a freshman, he will be a junior. That's a HUGE age difference at your age. He may expect certain things from you that you aren't willing to do, and you don't want to put yourself in that sort of situation. I suggest finding a guy closer to your age!

AA10032971	The perfect thing to do is, by all means, put forth honesty. Most times, you will triumph and be a winner. Think about it, What is more comfortable and natural than to be yourself?

Also, I don't believe for one bit that you love him, if you did you wouldn't have hurt him. It's a huge dissapointment. He'll be heartbroken if you tell him and you obviously don't care about his little feelings. That's sad. I'll pray for you because you need it, that's a shame really. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you don't want to hurt him that badly why would you do this? You're heartless.

If you break up with him randomly, he's going to feel you got bored with him and he did something wrong, THAT will shatter his confidence. You need to tell him the truth so he can move on. My last girlfriend broke up with me and won't tell me the reasons clearly. I would just like her to be straight with me and tell me what was up, not knowing makes it harder to move on.<br>  <br>  So just sit him down and tell him everything. Then let him decide, and if he says he needs to think then give him some space but don't let him be driven away. Text him and that, be friendly. But if he says he can't make up his mind i think it's best if you leave him because you're right, he doesn't deserve this.

Just bring up the fact that you heard she was talking about you and you really wish if she had a problem that she would come to you. Other than that I wouldn't say much because then she will go around saying that you were trying to start something with her and then that will just makes things worse.|`|6VGQXQ3Daa	forget her. forget everyone that's ever made fun of you or talked bad about you. today my friend took my clarinet and i didn't notice until the middle of class. I was looking for it saw kiana with it and gave her a warning death glare and the teacher saw it stopped class and i told her kiana took my clarinet. SO the teacher and the rest of the class started laughing at me all because i was asking kiana for my clarinet back. They all said they weren't laughing at me but im not stupid i know when someones talking about me and when some one says she freaked out because of her instrument THEN STARTS LAUGHING AT YOU! then any idiot can put two and two together. But i know that doesn't have anything to do with someone talking about you BEHIND your back but it sorta is kind of the same. the teacher laughed at me. they made me run to the bathroom crying where a teacher walked in and thought I WAS SKIPPING! which i wasn't i was going to go back once i was done crying like an idiot.

Let them know how you feel about the situations you believe they are taking advantage of you in and be sincere. Beating around the bush does nothing but cause misunderstanding and sometimes hostility. So, an example of explaining to them is: "Lately, I felt as if my kindness is being taken for granted and I want to make sure that is not the case." Or "I feel as if my efforts are unappreciated." And the wordings goes on and on. Just let them know how you feel.<br>  <br>  Also, if they intrepret it wrong. You gave it your best shot to be sincere about it without hurting their feelings. Sometimes just being frank but apologizing early for it may be your best solution.|`|SVuTVNVhaa	You need to tell them straight up.  If you don't appreciate it let them no.  If they are hurting you inside then they aren't real friends.  My advice is to tell them how you feel.|`|eMCCQD8Faa	I know how u feel.

You can be flattered if you'd like, you're obviously someone she wants to be like.  If you don't like her doing it, try talking to her about her interests.  If you act interested in the things she likes, she will realize it's okay to be herself.  Especially if the person she emulates is okay with her being herself.|`|384509079b461e09cb5a404a23a5946faa	It sounds like she might be insecure. Sometimes when a person does something for an insecure person that person feels the need to reciprocate because if they don't they might lose whoever their with.  How often do you tell her that you like something about her?  For example, the next time she makes you laugh say, I love it when you make me laugh.  If she feels secure in whatever relationship you'll have, the copying should decrease.|`|8PYYdP6Faa	ugh..people like that annoy me..lol..reli badly..i have a huge problem with the best friend twin look as well unless its like dressing up or somthing..<br>  <br>  it is quite wierd....but im sure it will pass...if not..do something reli wierd and creepy, f she copies you she'll get embarrasses and you succeed..if not the then you win too =]|`|fnk27F8xaa	Maybe she wants you|`|7KOeu1gLaa	She probably just thinks you're cool and idolizes you, in a desperate attempt to be as cool as she thinks you are herself... just think yourself lucky you have an idol... if you get sick of it just stop talking to her, she'll loose interest and leave you alon soon.|`|bIRAxcLkaa	u should b flattered. it means tht this girl wants to be like you. if it annoys you tell her. i know it would kinda annoy me. now another case could be shes making fun of you. but thts usually not the case unless the girl is a *****.|`|NBDbjNiBaa	She is probably insecure with her own personality.

If it hasn't been that long, then no it's not weird. He only says it because he's excited to have a great girlfriend and he sort of likes to show it off to his friends and people around you. If you've been together for a while, it is a little strange, but not a lot. It seems to me that you're nervous and get butterflies in your stomach when he's around. It happens to me all the time when I'm around someone I like or the guy I'm dating. After a while you'll get over your fear and just come right out and say it. Just let time do it's work. ;)
vZhVSYDMaa	Well, the only thing that I can say is, if you're unsatisfied with yourself, change the things that you can change, and don't worry about the things you can't. If you wanna lose some weight, then do it. Go work out. But obviously, you can't grow shorter and you can't magically start sprouting hair. So stop thinking about that.<br>  <br>  As for the girls, there's no way to control which girls fall for you and which ones don't. However, the more you meet, the higher chance you'll have of getting what you want. Yes, there are lots and lots of needy, lusty, phony women out there, but if you let yourself be discouraged by that, you have no right to complain about it. It's good that you give each woman a chance to make sure you're not making rash decisions, but once you realize that she's after you for the wrong reasons, move on to another one.<br>  <br>  All in all, I think you need to get over the things you can't control, and go meet more women. Instead of limiting your choices to the women who like you, try going after women that you like. I don't think it's possible for someone to love themselves the way they are fully, so don't try that. Just make do with what you have.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped a little and best of luck to you man|`|YUjVFkocaa	I'm not gonna tell you that, bro.  All I'm gonna say is that if you can get girls who LOOK GOOD to have sex with you... who CARES if they like to be dominated?  Enjoy it as you f*ck their brains out!!! IDK why that would bother you! ahaha i mean come ON<br>  <br>  ps if you start dressing preppy instead of dressing ghetto/however you dress now... and start talking like a jock/prep instead of like an army guy or however you talk now... you might be able to pull different types of girls, u know|`|Ja2VSS1saa	if you're concerned about the physical aspect, start working out and being healthy.  you have to decide to make that change.  once you start to see results -- which take time -- you will begin to gain confidence and women appreciate that confidence.  you may never get your hair back . . . but there are plenty of bald sexy men!  it doesn't have to be a bad thing.  and you're always going to be 6'3 and broad-shouldered, so get over it.  i don't know what kind of women you like, but i'd find that attractive in a heart beat!  and start opening up to women you don't think you'd like.  maybe the *type* you think you like least is really the type you should be going after!

OWjbg4GYaa	Confidence. Hey, read the book "why men love bitches" it will help you to know exactly what guys are looking in girl.
dd6rgtL7aa	I guess I don't care. I'm used to being with men who have been circumcised, but that doesnt mean I would prefer it. I've heard there is more sensation for both the man and woman without circumcision, so maybe I'd prefer that? Don't know. Most men in America are circumcised unfortunately, so I may never get the chance to experience an uncircumcised penis. Bummer really.|`|DTBbQbfLaa	I dated a guy that was uncircumsized and yes, he was much bigger than a circumsized man (or at least ones I have been with).  Still, I would say I prefer circumsized because I am pretty petite myself and bigger isn't always better with me!  lol....regarding the uncircumsized man not being "clean"....that USED to be the case, but seriously, it's not a big deal if they shower every day like every other person on earth.|`|sCr2iTczaa	I would prefer a circumcised because for the simple fact that men that aren't circumcised happen to carry a lot more bacteria, it is harder to clean it because you have to pull that skin down to clean it, and if you don't clean an uncircumcised penis properly it tends to have this awful fishy smell.|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	There is no difference in feeling when the penis is inside the vaginal. The only difference that I know is that they look different. I prefer a man that is circumcised because I feel there is less chance of catching something from him. The extra layer of skin has a tendency to trap more bacteria and therefore can cause infection and possibly pass it on to his female partner. To me they just look better circumsized.|`|NtCya5NYaa	it doesnt matter to me. i've been with both and i've liked both. i think alot of girls, especially north american, will say they prefer circed because thats just what their used to and uncirced it considered gross or dirty. i dont think so though, to me a penis is a penis and i go for guys based on personality not for their junk.|`|2xtRI2Ogaa	circumsized|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Hands down for circumsized men!!! Some girls don't really care but I have experienced both and I definitely am all for the circumsized! It is just cleaner to me especially when you are going to go down on them.  Sometimes if the uncircumsized guy doesn't have very good hygiene <br>  it can be a bit nasty and have a unpleasant smell to it that is totally a turn off and it's just too much extra skin for me personally!|`|dWmT9pBhaa	Well I am not cut, but in my experience American chicks tend to get a little weirded out because they don't often see em. If you go to Europe though, barely anyone is cut. Also being uncut makes it easier for you to stimulate the G-Spot.|`|BZiZr4Hcaa	I've only had one uncircumsized and it didn't really seem like much of a difference to me...|`|Rujt27CFaa	Circumcised is way better|`|GVlzdZKsaa	It's not circumcised that matters, is is how many inches do you have.|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	I don't think it makes a difference, its what you do with it that matters|`|YTXoBgVsaa	If we like you enough to have sex with you, we won't care if you're circumsized or not. We like you.|`|Vka09geaaa	i dont care|`|uTNKfpV6aa	Honestly, to most chicks a penis is a penis. Uncircumsized penises look a bit bigger, but it's really not a difference, once it's inside the chick. The main different is that a guy with an uncircumsized penis will feel more pleasure, because the nerve endings in the penis are hidden by the foreskin, and therefor due to not rubbing against pants and boxers, blah, blah, blah, are more sensitive. But most chicks will tell you, if use correctly (if you're good at sex), a penis is a penis, it doesn't matter if your circumsized or not.|`|R7FtrsMQaa	personally this is an individual thing, but in my opinion as long as the guy has good personal hygiene this should not be a problem.on the other hand if hygiene is not good then that would be a problem and I would not deal with it.|`|mBdXuNRDaa	I have never been with a guy that isn't circumcised, but I think it's gross that guys aren't circumcised!  I think I would much rather NOT have a non-circ. :)|`|pZu6Mk42aa	if your used to uncircumcised then it's a little bit of a shock, but as for pleasure it more depends on the guy not if they snipped his junk|`|1qWAWQnFaa	i guess circumsized is cleaner, but in my experience uncircumsized guys have way bigger things
gBfxL1ucaa	Girls like to be called pretty.  And if you do not have anything in common with her why are you even going out?  First of all tell her how you are feeling.  If she gets mad or upset leave her.  But if she understands how you are feeling and if she is thinking the same thing that is one step closer in your relationship!  And if your ussually the one that askes the questions all the time.  Ask her what she likes!!!!!  You are very likely to find something!  Then start from there!
dlfAj0nxaa	yes hes interested however hes also not making it easy the first sign for you that he was interested was the fact that he was staring at you. most guys when they someone they are interested in will look at them more then once.

IydgPKRoaa	Let me start by saying I know alot of how you feel by being a mother myself. I've put up with alot of **** that my babydaddy has put me thru with other women. My advice to you is to focus on yourself and bettering yourself for you and your child. You his first babymama and yall will always share that bond. From the sound of it he knows he got you where he wants you by telling you some game but not backin up what he sayin. But if he really loves you he wouldnt be having unprotected sex with other females and putting you at risk.  I know you love him but as soon as you stop chasing him and start chasing your own he is going to be chasing after you especially if his new babymama slackin. Maybe then you can question what he has to offer you && your child.   And even if things dont work out he still gone be in your life...once you start being independent (emotionally or financially) you might actually attract some men that will appreciate & deserve you. I hope this helps && Much Luck!
GVlzdZKsaa	Until my hand gets tired.|`|dQh1YzV0aa	matters if its with a girlfriend or not but.. hmmm. as much as possible|`|xdnZd7WBaa	not very often
IPj3GRoxaa	Okay well first of all it kind of sounds like you don't like her appearance not just "her". And you need to not judge people ...who are you to cast the first stone...(what makes you SOOO much better) ...sorry if it sounds like im trying to be mean to you b/cuz im not but just try to be nice with the way you talk and word things plzzz...<br>  anyway straight up tell her how much she annoys you. BUT be nice about it otherwise its not going to work. She'll just try harder to be your so called friend. Take her aside from (other) people and say look insert friends name.. and I honestly think your annoying and that's why we dont want to be friends with you. When you blank blank blank (whatever it is she does) it makes us feel blank blank blank.<br>  Hope this helps|`|a6p6zaYFaa	Awwww I feel bad for this girl =[<br>  By reading this I'm assuming that you guys arent in highschool yet. This girl prbly has no friends and that makes me feel bad for her. Just try suggesting friends for her and try to make her like other people. You guys are still young and your still soul searching so she is just trying to figure out who she is. She may be the weird girl now but by the time you guys get to highschool she's probably going to blossom into one of the hottest girls in school, or become famous...so being friends with her now can probably boost your popularity later. And maybe you can help her improve her look...give her a makeover!|`|smbWnuHEaa	Ignoring seriously doesn't work.. i've tried<br>  <br>  try the opposite, reverse psychology<br>  <br>  maybe be really friendly, or even a bit too friendly, start coming onto her, just like being a bit obsessive with her, and she should freak out and never wanna hang out with you<br>  <br>  if you really hate her, it's worth a try.. just be a bit over the top, so that she gets annoyed by you, and leaves of her own accord.. rather than feeling like she was forced<br>  <br>  and good luck!|`|5ith7Qyoaa	back off her. just let her tag along, it obviously makes her happy. dont go out of the way to be her best friend or anything just be nice. some people just tag along sometimes and you just have to deal.
be0YaDUPaa	Ex's that are totally over each other might be able to do it....ex's that have unresolved feelings, it would just be a disaster.  How can anyone move on when you live together and can't date others?  Maybe you can't afford to live alone, but there is some girl out there that needs a rommate as much as you need somewhere else to go.|`|wi6mkT30aa	Living with an ex is so diffcult because this doesn't give you any time to get over him and MOVE ON! This is goign to be hard because hes already wanting to date other woman....can you bare seeing him doing that? I couldn't or wouldn't even want that at all...I know this is tough because of the money but stay with a friend or relative this would be just too heart breaking for me!|`|EyaqiWPwaa	as long as you dont make him a sandwich you should be fine....cuz if you do he might want you again|`|sy7ytm9Kaa	I think both you of need to get relationship counseling.  It seems pretty obvious you both still want to be together.  There are always other options... you two chose this option.    You two still love each other and want to be together.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	That's a bad idea living together.  Especially if there are still feelings for the other person from either one of you which it seems you still have.  Also how is the person he or you would be dating feel about the whole living situation...living with the ex!!!  I would be pissed!  You all need to figure something out cuz this isn't going to work out at all.
wi6mkT30aa	My boyfriend and I have been together for a year now. We do everything together. We go to the movies, go out to dinner, play board games, make dinner, watch movies at home curled up in bed, go to concerts together, walk our dogs together, go for car rides together, kiss, hug, love eachother! WE do everything together, I love him!

vCTMZKrgaa	It means he's got, or thinks he's got control of you. Don't let him run you like that. Ask him what's going on, get to the bottom of it.|`|VYMxtHpoaa	He's got your love lockdown, your love lockdown. He has your love lockdown, your love lockdown. He's not loving you, like you wanted to...|`|iaF9ABhnaa	I really don't know maybe....it means he has you close enough to him that he might be ready to try a further step on you. Lockdown to me means getting something really close or tareted. Im not sure if im making sense. I wonder what tone he used when he said it. I dunno maybe he plans sex in the near future....??|`|z43aCy7oaa	He probably means that he's controlling you.  And that's NOT GOOD.  Unless you like to be controlled...
1oKkHe0jaa	I wouldn't necessarily call it "using you" unless it's just a physical relationship, but you didn't state that, so im not sure. I do believe that if he cared about you like he said he does, then he would come out of his way to come and see the person he loves. When you love someone, you're bound to want to spend every minute of the day with that individual. If I were in your shoes, I would tell just tell him how you feel about the situation. Communication is key. If you bottle it up inside, you aren't going to get anywhere, and things are probably going to get worse. Tell him exactly what you just told us. After, if he is still not changing, then you just need to take the next step which is not going to see him. Don't go over there anymore. Don't call/text him and say that you want to go out.. don't do it. Its his turn to step up to the plate. And I think that once he sees that you aren't calling like you used to, and that you can be alright without him, he should start calling and asking you out. Good luck.|`|gXG3bRwaaa	hes using u, sounds like a lazy mooch, tell him that if he doesnt shape up ur gonna rip is balls off|`|y05dLJfYaa	Ask him whats up.<br>  Most boyfriends would be more than willing to go out of their way to see their girlfriends, if they really "love" them.<br>  Also, you said you've been on & off for quite awhile. Look at the reasons for why you broke up so many times. <br>  If he beats around the bush when you ask him about it, dump him.<br>  <br>  Honestly, if you're in a relationship where you feel used, the best thing to do is get rid of him.<br>  You can definitely do way better.|`|dlfAj0nxaa	let me tell you something, most guys dont think like women do. he is not using you, he just doesnt think about going the extra distance. so my advice to you is to gently remind him if does more he will get more(doesnt have to be sex) from you. most guys need to be motivated in order to go more then they have to|`|ssVPKXhFaa	1st of all u should break up with him becuz  it looks like he doesnt loves u and he doesnt even tries 2 be with u  !! y u just move on and look 4 someone better who can give u love !! or talk 2 him about it!!|`|4qbYf6YVaa	its because you are disguisting. no guy likes fat slobs like you. he also has 634065093409 girls at his house when you aren't there. and there is **** EVERYWHERE. dump his ***|`|A0e9JyS8aa	here's my advice, if he doesn't want to take you out, you take yourself out. make things that will make you more attractive, dress up, go shopping, do a make over, and once he sees that you are more desirable  and men give you attention believe me he wont let you go out by yourself. ;)
Nt1Tz3zuaa	i think he's definently into youu! all the stuff he's doing is sooo cutee i think you should just wait for him to make some more moves and i think things will work out!! let me know how everything goess|`|hLozB0MUaa	awwwww i think he likes you (: good luck & go for it!|`|AA11687142	I think it was totally Flirty, You can never be too sure though, so I wouldn't advise that you make any real moves yet but continue to be receptive to his gestures and maybe things will just fall into place. He sounds like a sweet guy, I hope that it works out for you!|`|t5N9QQntaa	The first thing you should think to yourself is that has this happened only the twice between you guys?  and if he just waved you off then that conversation was not to important.  and if he waited out side too, maybe his friend told him to wait out their so he could get him..<br>    so my best advice is never assume that he is into you, however just continue to talk and flirt back if he is doing it then why cant you, and see where it goes from there. dont jump the gun though.|`|YVIzCzJGaa	aaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwww<br>  hes in love if he would do that!

Y es you are extremely lucky. You should be on the pill and use a condom as well. Apparently you cannot trust him to not get you pregnant alone so make sure you take something else, it cannot hurt.

Nt1Tz3zuaa	okay first of all you have a wife? and you going on a blind date? wow thats really messed up. second of all you cant get herpes from a hot tub, and she probably didnt tell you about it sooner because thats probably not the best way to start off a date. but you need to get your life straightened outt, stop cheating on your wife!|`|z43aCy7oaa	i can't believe you cheated on your wife...You deserve herpes...too bad for you you can't get it in a hot tub.|`|uFlrbRbXaa	yes she should have been open with you sooner.  stall the hook-ups with your wife by telling her you are sick and contagious until after you get your results.

Also, in the past I've made him a scrapbook, it's a pretty meaningful gift. Then for Christmas, I made him a jar filled with strips of paper each saying a reason that I love him. I hope these ideas helped you any.|`|UlgPHf6haa	Create a scavenger hunt... put clues around town on places you like to go. just tape them on the side of restaurants and stores (I do it all of the time) and have it end at your house with a present waiting for him....... you could also make him dinner, guys love it when you cook for them :)|`|PIVWTdzOaa	make him a memory book  of all the time you've spent together and let him know how u feel.. go out to dinner together and then go back to either of ur houses and spend some quality time together maybe watch a movie or something romantic. have fun (:<br>  <br>  <br>  please answer mine<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgG_DJpDtfKKE6KGs2xqemXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219122122AARWGQA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|49gugL8maa	Just hang out with him. If you are party people then go out, if not then you should just chill at his place: turn the temp down at the house, get a blanket and watch a movie.|`|VWRufnniaa	Make him a card and pour out your heart in it. Tell him how much you love him:)|`|06O8FaOjaa	GIVE HYM THE BEST SEX HZ EVER HAD
WXfGnnzKaa	Okay, well i think if you love him you should stay with him. You say he is trying and is showing you that he has changed. So now its your turn to do your part you need to forgive and forget. If you love him like you say you do you will be able to do it if you don't then you need to let him go and move on. I know it's hard but if you think you can't trust him anymore then it's going to be hard to have a relationship, trust is  really important. Either you give it to him little by little or just let him go if you just can't.
3IhHcSfeaa	just decide what is more important to you, either starting a relationship and seeing where it leads you and maybe wrecking a friendship OR staying friends but always wondering what might had happened<br>  <br>  i say go for it!! you only live once!
UxbjvAaRaa	Well first give it a try. If things just aren't working out then i would break it off. <br>  But don't go and party it off, find some friends to hang out with. You'll probably find a life long companian in college anyways.|`|AA11841749	It's an hour and a half away, not in Africa.  You can visit him on the weekends, or he can come see you.  It's not that big of a deal.
1P3qpF5saa	Chemistry is usually either there or it isnt.<br>  It's like that magnetism you have with someone. A sort of feeling that you get when you're around someone you're attracted to.|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	Chemistry is when you get along with someone easily.|`|LjV0MTQYaa	Chemistry cannot be forced. It just means that two people connect real well, on a more intimate level (other than basic common interests). It may involve sharing beliefs, experiences, a "special" connection, or even love.<br>  <br>  You can't make chemistry happen because some people are just not right for each other.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|n8Db77zbaa	your compatibility/similarities.|`|JpyjecHuaa	your relationship with tht person|`|zjxr6fRsaa	that, you get along with her.|`|rApcoDk5aa	It's pretty much when you just "click" with a person, and get along really well with them. You can't force it unfortunately, either you work with them or you don't.|`|VSXjfvd1aa	to have chemistry means to connect and have 'likes' for one another.|`|iGlXhQw5aa	You have things in common.

U0pwzNYqaa	Nothing is wrong with you wanting to date older women. But be careful with who you loose your virginity to. there is so many diseases out there and it would be ashamed with you being innocent and being a virgin then hooking up with a girl who has a disease. make sure she be checked. better safe than sorry.|`|3rDbLSZBaa	being a vergin isnt just someting you say i dont want anymore. being a virgin isnt that bad. just think!|`|NqAzcrtsaa	Just date one or more of your teachers, the English teacher is usually good-to-go.|`|2xtRI2Ogaa	um.. there is nothing wrong with you its just your hormones acting up again.. since you said you were quiet.. you should open up more and try and fit in with all of them, you will never know what mite happen life brings weird things to you boii|`|IcUsSPeUaa	No 16 year old should have sex.|`|06O8FaOjaa	NOOO JUS FIND A GIRL WHO DOESNT HAVE A BOYFRIEND|`|SIbM5uebaa	wow older women are hot|`|uTNKfpV6aa	Honestly, I don't understand why being a virgin is a bad thing? I'm seventeen, and a virgin. I'm not the kind of girl who's saving it for marriage either. But waiting for the right person is important to me.<br>  <br>  Anyways... If you're going to have sex be aware of the possible consequence's... You can get some chick knocked up, you can get an STD. If you're going to have sex, be ready for all that ****.<br>  <br>  Now, if you're looking for a quick hook up, which I think is a bad idea but you want an answer... Go to parties, there are usually quite a few drunk girls, who will do anything that walks. So start there.|`|zjxr6fRsaa	i don't think there's something wrong with u, unless if by saying older women you mean "grandmas" but probably you just want someone experienced and since all the girls of your age are taken,that's the only thought that comes on your mind....but let me tell u something....one thing is having sex with someone older than you and another is to fall in love with her....so, be careful and just wait there's always someone special for each of us in this world so, just be patience...don't lose your virginity with the first girl u run into...let it be special and always use protection (condom)|`|mINsmx78aa	Don't have sex till you get married or some girl will be on JUGDE MATHIS screamin "HE'S MY BABY'S DADDY"  and i don't think you want to mess up your life for 2 minutes or not all that good sex!!

You sound like a decent looking guy when they come around they will don't be to eager.|`|Z1irqgc9aa	just take it easy man, it will happen soon enough. slutty girls are everywhere.  just try to be fit in shape that makes it easier, girls will come to you when you look good. that's my favorite way to fish. <br>  <br>  and always wear a condom fool. i know you're new to this whole thing but always wear a condom. <br>  <br>  WEAR A CONDOM WEAR A CONDOM WEAR A CONDOM|`|ze4Gt1araa	No there's nothing wrong with you but I'll say wait for the right girl to come to you and have sex when you do have a girl friend because it won't mean anything if you do it with an oridinary girl you don't know.<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope this helps. :)|`|D0eiqUNDaa	Dude you got to trust me.

sZMa0s7Baa	Well I'm a girl, but honestly both look great on you. But I think the short gives you a little more character, and you look older. But if you keep it long you should always curl it like that, it looks better then just straight.|`|49gugL8maa	I think you look good with the short hair, but that is just my preference.|`|E2NyoJkvaa	I think you look good with long hair, but i personally love the pic with you of short hair.|`|MmjGvTSfaa	you look good with the curl.
atCtfNQyaa	well obviously yes... if u can read. youd be able to decipher that out...<br>  <br>  and why do u care if he has feeligns for you, if u dont have them for him.
7Mro3gfdaa	The guy doesn't ALWAYS have to ask the girl out. I mean, if only guys asked out girls, that would be boring and so cliched. If you want to ask him out, go for it. Who cares if other people think it's lame?|`|gEd1jlOEaa	No it's not! Go for it!|`|9ggcctbSaa	The same thing happened to me today said 'I really like you so want to go  out' and some other stuff he said i would love to and wee kisses but yeah ask the guy it is so wrong for people to say girls can't ask guys if likes you he will say yes|`|GjssWLQSaa	No it is incredibly good and modern for the girl to ask the guy out. You should go for it as he is probably very shy!
rJgrwIodaa	As long as you want it to.  An hour would certainly be a goal I'd shoot for.  More would be great, less no worse.  I guess what really matters is how much you enjoy it!  Slow, lazy sex could last all day.  Hot, intense sex could last only minutes.  Depends on the mood really.|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	Should or does?<br>  Should be about a half an hour.<br>  Usually less than ten minutes.<br>  I have done without for 16 years so maybe a minute and a half in my case:)|`|AA11363680	It's different for everyone. Some can go for an hour, others can do it a few times in an hour.<br>  <br>  But a lot depends on how active you are. The more you get, generally the longer it takes, up to a point.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	Depends - do you mean I/C at a gangbuster pace for an hour straight?    You need to be in pretty good shape but that's good.     <br>  <br>  We sometimes take our time, touch each other, kiss, start, ease up, change positions, etc.... and then the only reason we stop is for a meal or because someone has to be somewhere.    Sometimes we kiss for a few minutes and then just attack each other and it's Ron Jeremy style for a good hour, on the sofa, in the window, on the floor - one standing up and one bent over - - we're in very good shape and even we tire after a few hours of that.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	I've heard the statistical average put at around around 10 minutes.

It shouln't take to much or it might hurt ur private part but if ur doing it for fun and not to be pragnet get some condons and do it for two hours or how much u want|`|7Y0a2G6Vaa	Of course it depends on the situation, but I'd say minimum 15 minutes not including foreplay and no maximum. Sometimes you both want a marathon and sometimes just a quicky. It's all great though, just make sure everyone's satisfied.. mmmm..|`|vEVtXftTaa	There isn't any set time... I can't stand it if it lasts for more than 20 minutes to be honest with you.  Some people can go all night, though. It all depends on your taste & stamina.|`|06e3b455c42895168ee7096710ade50daa	not long if virgin but an hour or more if not virgin|`|hOf5qAOEaa	hahaha what ever floats your boat or you but im not sure with what...... like 3 hours or however long until u get tired or bored|`|Tae1XZq5aa	it would be close to a hour!! y?? lol!!
jdah4ZA2aa	From what my guy friends tell me:  Some guys just love to do it because they feel like its a special skill.  Some guys just consider it part of sex.  Some guys only do it on girls they like. <br>  <br>  Similar to girls and giving bjs.  I enjoy it and consider it a normal part of sexual activity, but some of my friends have to be begged by their boyfriend to do it.
oE1eCjRtaa	As long as you like him, does it matter?<br>  I would suggest that you Try and get them to all spend time together so that they can maybe become friends?|`|2M4tNISgaa	Maybe your friends are jelous us. Or not.<br>  I think you shouldn't if you really like him.<br>  But if you doubt your relationship with him you shouldnt lead him on.|`|Yqzr82i3aa	is there a good reason why ur friends don't like him?<br>  <br>  if he is mean to them.<br>  <br>  well if there is a good reason they don't like him.....Friends before boyfriends!|`|X7z0KWXbaa	dont be shallow , u sed either, does that mean u dont even like him?<br>  <br>  and ignore ur frends, if they dont like him its theyre problem
uPbTsr9eaa	I think that maybe you were just bored and asked this, hopefully next time you convince her to play against each other or something :) good luck :)
sZMa0s7Baa	No... I wouldn't find it offensive. I would find hctib (it's backwards) offensive though, of course. Haha.|`|EyaqiWPwaa	i think that if you make me a sandwich then you are a woman....but if you dont then your a chick!!!

fKYi3IJ2aa	Just act like the way you were before. Dont leave hints that you like him like sitting to close to him or touching him ect. If he says anything just explain that the person who told him was mistaken
QGU3kURjaa	Just go to sharif uni, they'll have something to help u!! or go to ur highschool! <br>  wish help!
V4ONcH1Daa	Depends on what kind of signals she's giving you. Maybe she broke up with her boyfriend to be with you? It also depends on how long they were going out. If she's bummed then wait a while. If she's happy, make sure she even wants a relationship. She might be pumped about being single.|`|W1AIkx9Eaa	i would wait a little bit since she just broke up with her boyfriend n then maybe ask her
KHic5rAaaa	It's a lack of maturity on both of your parts, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I'm assuming you're both in high school and still very young, so of course you're going to do immature things like ignoring each other for no apparent or significant reason.  It's totally normal and fine.<br>  <br>  However, you're obviously not okay with the continual cycle of getting into petty disagreements, not talking, then finally talking again.  The only way for this to change is to either voice your opinion and tell him exactly how you feel about it OR when this happens again, be the bigger person and say what's the deal, this is stupid, we're great friends and should never ignore each other because it's immature!  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps : )|`|V4ONcH1Daa	Apologize to him and tell him you really hate when you guys get into disagreements. Make sure he knows you don't mean for them to happen. Tell him you just want to be friends with him without drama and see how things progress. If nothing gets better, maybe it's just him.

He must be someone who likes revenge, because if he had sex in his dream with another girl, then he really was mad.<br>  <br>  hope this helped :)|`|CX27uSAgaa	if your partner has a dream about you cheating on them then it means you that you miss them and have stronge feelings for them. so it means you miss your boyfriend and you love him alot. :)|`|dVlLahozaa	It means that he is testing you to see if you would cheat on you and then letting you know of the vengeance that he would take you know by sleeping with those chicks|`|IeeaLYubaa	he is probably cheating on you and his guilt is starting to get to him a little bit|`|v32IEjpsaa	He has his own insecurities!

7PGxqRfZaa	It would not matter to me personally. it depends on the guy. I would not go and see her at work though if she did go back to being a stripper. Personally it would not matter to me. I'm not the jealous type, unless she gives me a reason to be jealous. Good luck.|`|YUjVFkocaa	id break up with her<br>  <br>  thats just me<br>  <br>  i dont want stds|`|srAP6Vzvaa	I wouldn't care if my Girlfriend was a Stripper. But that's just me!!!

1k2IbKKzaa	You can tell that he likes you by his verbal and visual cues he is giving you. If he is always trying to talk to you or leaning his elbow on his desk it shows he is flirting with you. If you like him, maybe you guys should go out and do something fun together where you can get to know him more.|`|0oSAY54Laa	he has interest in you!! i think that you should flirt with him and if he flirts back than i think that that's a great sign and i think that you should hang out sometime and see what happens!! get to know him better and see what happens!!|`|AqVYvpIhaa	i think so!!!!
eO4y3m1maa	honestly, first time..nothing will happen they will just be ban from the mall for a year and have to pay for the clothes.<br>  <br>  soooetimes they may have to pay fines but teens that age they dont bother with.
jO7FtMreaa	Your friends probably had their parents bail them out. Ask them if ou think they'll trust you. Most likely they won't do it again if they felt so scared at school. Yeah they would maybe have been fined but normal for just some clothes it would about $200. You can calm down, you're not physically gonna lose them.|`|45UTKuamaa	What your friends did was just plain stupid and though I would not like to see them in juvenile hall, I do hope the judge and the experience scares the living hell out of them and that they are smart enough learn from the about consequences of their actions. and I hope you learn something too.|`|85vDqn6naa	probably just a slap on the wrist if it is a first offense, lol prison that was not prison!|`|qr4j0oKxaa	i got caught too! khols will jus fine them! n if they dont pay the fine right away it will get higher n higher. dont worry! they arent goin away! its jus gunna b a fine!
7PGxqRfZaa	Well its a good thing that you used a condom every time, but condoms are not 100% effective and there is a slim possibility that she is preg. If she is there are abortions and there is adoption. and there is always getting married or just paying child support. It depends on you two and what you two think is best if she is. Good luck and I hope she is not pregnant.|`|9RtdvLEKaa	If you just took a home pregnancy test, that's not a very good indication, they can be very inaccurate.  One of the early signs of pregnancy is spotting, though, which could have been what happened on Tuesday, believe me, I just went through the same thing.  Just stay cool and wait until the blood test comes back!  Good luck...|`|SR1FN2nqaa	first of all id like to know how a person can be 56% pregnant and secondly if you used condoms and they didnt break i doubt she is , unless she has a special friend you dont know about. good luck with that one.|`|T272vObnaa	Of course there's a very good chance she's not pregnant.  Don't worry.  And while she's at the doctor's she should look into birth control.|`|Ftz9UWPEaa	can u post the pictures of the baby when he/she is born?|`|06e3b455c42895168ee7096710ade50daa	it could b that she isnt pregnant somtimes periodes are just off usually u should use the prego test that give u 99.99% accuracy becuase itll most likey b more accurate gl! and just dont worry to much till u kno|`|6h0eCVwpaa	Yeah i think that there is a good chance she's not pregnat.

You need to chat with him and see how he responds.  If he's into you, he'll show signs of liking to talk to you and continue to.  Its just silly to watch him from afar and wonder how you know if he likes you or not.  First, he has to notice you.
lbvE1bMqaa	prank call people.<br>  tell scary stories<br>  bake something<br>  play board games<br>  just sit and talk/gossip<br>  <br>  when someone falls alseep duct tape them to the ground and take a flashlight, shine it in their directon and yell "tracks" like a train is coming when they wake up start screaming and it'll freak em out :)

b35c80d41df8eace848e7c91a0b869c2aa	Honestly, i think you consider what your first kiss is.<br>  If you didnt actually kiss back, and you didnt really like it, then i think it isnt considered a kiss.<br>  To me, your first kiss is the kiss you share with someone who likes/loves you just as much as you like/love them. And that you both agree on kissing.<br>  NOT just a spur of the moment quick peck.|`|iH6XOY0zaa	I would say that it is your first kiss. Technically. However, when you get a real kiss that you enjoy, that's one that you should refer to as your real first kiss.|`|Zm3QIw4Taa	no not really. its only a first kiss if you want it to be and if you were into it.|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	it's only your first kiss if you want it to be, but if you didn't like it because he's a jerk and you didn't kiss him back, forget it about it and look for a better first kiss!|`|uvcqPfuNaa	He may have regretted it because he realized he was taking advantage of you. I don't think he was regretting like saying why did I kiss THAT girl. One a one sided kiss can't even be really called a kiss. You have to kiss him back.
gVYfFSpRaa	No, it's not creepy, but make sure you've had some conversations before you tell her that or it would be really weird for her.  If you get to know her a little bit better, then you can say that she's pretty.  But DON'T say "A pretty girl like you will fit in just fine here" because it just sounds like you're only talking to her because she's hot (which is not a good thing).|`|ykPN1GCPaa	it would be kinda weird if we just met. so get to know her a little more, then it wont be weird, it will be cute.  ^.^ good luck.|`|IcUsSPeUaa	That'd probably, almost definitely creep a girl out. I've done it many times without even trying and that's the kind of hting that does the trick. Say something like "I like your profile picture. You look pretty." or  when you see her in person "Hi, you look really pretty."|`|Qxexz4mEaa	Oh gosh no! Don't say that if you just added her. Maybe comment a picture and say something like "pretty picture" or whatever...|`|ibR6jJgHaa	tbh, the wording would annoy me ha,<br>  <br>  not too creepy..|`|XasLRQnXaa	dont say that lol...|`|b35c80d41df8eace848e7c91a0b869c2aa	Honestly, I cant quite answer that.<br>  It really depends on the girl and the type of guy you are.<br>  If the girl thinks you are good looking or cute then it would be a compliment buttt if she thought you were wierd, THENN it would be creepy.|`|EsKB9A64aa	A tiny bit creepy, but mostly I would appreciate it.|`|x0R1UKhWaa	well it kind of sounds like your talking to a little kid.<br>  but i don't know it wouldn't really be creepy unless your ugly.
gVYfFSpRaa	Ask her what she's interested in- that's always a great conversation starter.  And if the conversation doesn't flow enough, keep talking about her interests, and that will eventually lead to her getting to know you really well.|`|PKVKpzDdaa	dont tell her on facebook!!!!!! Every woman alive knows that myspace and facebook is the new booty call ;)<br>  The best thing to do is tell her to her face, tell her you think she is the most beautiful girl you have ever met, and that you like her.. That would work on me..|`|0yaQQSwoaa	Well its a great start by talking to her on face book it sort of eases the tension of talking to the girl in person, maybe then after a bit if it goes well or if you want to be courteous you could invite her out for lunch, not dinner!! remember.|`|smrUVwckaa	u seem like a sweet guy. be urself. n i say don't try 2 hard, n drop little compliments once in a while, n listen 2 her. then do wutevr
BRur3Vzgaa	u must be hott cause he is #$*!^%@ sexy|`|CXNr6ZBxaa	yes I think he used to be one and still is a good looking guy|`|eKGwK6rKaa	HE LOOKED GOOD WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER BUT HE IS NOT NOW, HE'S GETTING OLDER.
b1b6e3d33b1a99da35a245dd5c6cae76aa	Im telling you it's not easy but honestly this has happened so many times before and everyone goes through it. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  -jaimie|`|8000008da995a7f2941cb90d17250013aa	Move the #%^ on...ok??? Go date someone ELSE!!!
Xpj8Mn2laa	Gross chick!<br>  <br>  He can't fire you or anything - he should NOT have asked you to do that - and he really shouldn't have taken his shirt off. He could be in big trouble if he fired you and you decided to tell employment protection about his little request. <br>  <br>  Maybe start looking for a new job - get away from the werido|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Ew I hope this is made up.  I would have filed a lawsuit for harassment.|`|IDnIo7wYaa	that is really gross.<br>  why would he even ask a freakin co-worker to do that.<br>  i wouldnt go back if i was you.|`|BtxQogSzaa	Oh dear, bad situation. you did what i would have done tho, did it hard to punish him.<br>  <br>  thats pretty ooooky|`|P8Z9rZNSaa	lmfao!|`|sbovNcMBaa	that is just plain DISCUSTING|`|sR6NlPsDaa	Go up to your boss and tell him that you are sorry. You thought it was a little gross, and you really don't like the sight blood and it makes you feel kinda sick. Tell him you didn't mean to do it so hard, you just wanted to get back to work because you really like your new job. Ask him if he'll forgive you and that you promise never to do it again.<br>  <br>  Yeah, this DOES seem gross. But if  you want to keep your job, do it the right way. If you decide to pop the pimp, then do it nicely.<br>  <br>  Your boss also seems a bit sensitive. Just try to be careful around him :) focus on your job and do what's right :)

i5Ey9stBaa	Hmm when I like a girl, my friends go finds information on her, whether <br>  I want them to or not. But they naturally just go look for information without the girl knowing, so I don't think they are actually interested in you or just trying to get you to like their friend, your crush.<br>  <br>  The reason may be that they are just trying to get to know you, if they are protective of their friend, and see whether you should go out with him, or they want you to get with him, or they are just jealous of him that they don't want you near him, out of jealousy<br>  <br>  Hoped it helped|`|zxpH9va6aa	Nena trust me he already knows you like him. Because i'm sure his boyz already tolded him guys" us guys" pickup on those things faster then girls think  and, they get around even faster so yeah.Now hes probably shy knowing whats the situation and his boyz are probably waiting for him to say something to you and, he probably starts feeling uncomfatable thats how it is with us"GUYS" sometimes unfortunate. and,probably hes scared he will say something wrong in front of his homies and he might think it will make your interest turn elsewhere. Thats what he probably FEARS...You should just tell him yourself alone somewhere that you feeling him . You be surprised what can happen out of that (SMILES) Good Luck|`|CyWEam38aa	yes we do|`|41oBq4Djaa	im confused myself.<br>  try talking to him and getting his attention. see what he does. if he doesn't pay much attention, try moving on, hes not worth it.|`|5OzUocVQaa	dont flatter yourself...|`|Hcc9fxqJaa	maybe he liked you before but now he doesnt because he know his friend likes you so he decided to step back
TIVrZ2I8aa	Hey....<br>  <br>  I already answered a similar question.  <pondering>*Humph*<br>  <br>  Of course, I think people should get to know each other before consummating a relationship.  I think too many people don't get to know each other.  Then the relationship fails, miserably many times.  People become distraught and, unnecessarily, stressed.<br>  <br>  You should at least know their first And last names.  LOL|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	That could be taken different ways, including sexual.  But, sometimes you just wanna get laid and even finding out your partner's name doesn't really matter at those times, it's just sex pure and simple.  But if you want a relationship, then getting to know each other first and figuring out if you can be friends first is important.|`|71EwzPSlaa	well i think what it means is that you should basically get to know the person that you are considering sleeping with....i somewhat agree because if you are looking for the person you want to be with forever then you need to know that conversation is gonna be there when you cant have sex anymore lol....and yes it could be totally taken the wrong way lol
CceiP7q5aa	id rather have more peace and be siingle|`|Xmr76hGJaa	someone else said they would rather be single and happy than partnered up and not,<br>  I think you can have your cake and eat it too,<br>  For myself, I would rather be together and happy, Which I am.|`|AA11447210	That's why I'm single now. I 'settled' once (years ago) and found out what a huge mistake that usually is. I've been single most of the time since then (over a decade).<br>  <br>  Better to be single and happy, than in a relationship and not. There's someone in my life I care a lot about, and if things work out with us I'll be thrilled...if not, I'm not boyfriend or husband hunting. Life will go on regardless, and will be as groovy as I make it. ???|`|tXrtRFoNaa	I'm a man and am single / divorced and I have never been this happy my whole life, I eat what I want, when I want , where I want, and go out drinking and to strip clubs, and sports bars, and eat fried foods, and stay up singing utill 6 in the morning, and playing guitar hero, and all the video games I want, and watch all the best shows on tv, and I'm never going back to being in a relation ship again, one night stands and booty calls for the rest of my life, its ******* awsome|`|Bv3Dm11paa	No Way, I'd rather a full life with all its ups and downs. No one said relationships were meant to be easy. It's something you have to work on every day! Its better to experience life and love then stand back and be afraid. <br>  But if your looking at dating someone who's abusive or who's personality is abrasive then look elsewhere for a more calm and well balanced person.|`|Tmr7f3Xgaa	You bet!|`|AA11457477	I would rather stay single, and be happy
AA11447210	I don't directly associate penis size to masculinity...a guy might have a peanut but be a very 'manly man'...or he might have a tree trunk but be very effeminate.<br>  <br>  Your penis doesn't dictate how manly you are...it just has some bearing on whether your sexual partners will find it a satisfactory size or not (and even then, you've got to know how to use it).|`|Wwxqwjf5aa	its not about the size its the motion in the ocean .|`|mSt1LGfjaa	i think its how you use it,,you can still satisfy a woman with other methods,,it doesn't all have to do with the p***s size..and i guess it depends on who your with,,cause some women are different sizes too,,if you know what i mean,..sometimes the shoe fits and sometime it doesn't,
EQeX35dWaa	Lick your lips and just stare at him with those sexy eyes of yours.   I did that and now I am married to the shy guy. My guy was so shy I had to make the first moves in the beginning.  Now he calls the shots !  I am not saying the you will get married and have kids but I am saying SOME GUYS NEED US GIRLS TO MAKE FIRST MOVE.   <br>  Good luck ?.|`|crZg76Hpaa	Keep looking in between his lips and his eyes; make your eyes and look like you want it and slowly move in for the kill!|`|YPNdv0pSaa	put your head on his shoulder and just keep looking up at him and smile, then kiss him on the cheek and smile. He'll get the hint :)|`|3904b92344e2d1148197d40e2c09f3fdaa	Just look at his mouth a lot when you guys are talking and get very close to him. Then he should really get the hint! If he still doesn't make the move, maybe you should! Good luck! ?|`|Wgv2KFT0aa	most guys want you to make the move... so when your nitting next to him or something pull his head in and kiss him... it will flo from there
Dg5qbQtJaa	Haha well a shy guy would do that. He likes her but he's so nervous he afraid to say "hi" or anything. Ya know?|`|Mp2r9Ul5aa	Don't listen to people that say no. Just recently, i read an article about how guys are SOOOO scared of rejection. If he is the shy type, then he will probably ignore you if he likes you. But if he is the type that is very open and talks alot, is confident, etc.,then im sorry...he probably does not like you.|`|6uzhVE0aaa	no that makes no sense<br>  thats something someone would do if they thought the opposite of liking them|`|AA10313222	no unless he is really weird|`|GR4O3Gdgaa	well i dont think so cuz wouldnt he keep tlkin to her to get her to like him. and if it is for that reason then there has to be somethin else. or he's just weird|`|Qxexz4mEaa	Maybe...some guys might be embarrassed by the situation or confused for their feelings, So that's how they cope.|`|Hk3VmZszaa	you need to go see that movie he's just not that into you, lol, it will tell you. it's a good chick flick|`|aKEK24o4aa	you should watch the movie "he's just not that into you"<br>  <br>  sorry hun but ignoring you really means just that.

NO|`|TFdQMOMoaa	depends what u mean by "ignore"|`|qlz2BSycaa	yes lol cuz he may be scared he dont like her back so avoiding the situation will mean he dont haveto find out or he might be lookn for attention from her by makin her think he dont need her friendship or .. and make her think hes busy so she thinks his cool lol|`|4X13FhBcaa	if your kinda being annoying then no hes ignoring you because your being annoying. but normally guys go through hard times and stuff so they ignore people to get through them, not because they like them.<br>  <br>  if this helps can you give me 10 points?|`|Gn23IX6naa	it depends what type of guy he is<br>  <br>  info: you should put up there what type of guy he is and maybe we can answer your question a little better.

SIE3HuHRaa	Make a pro or con list and sooner or later your mind will be trying to tell you which one you truly like. Like if one of the guys picks their nose in public or something, you might see that as more of a turn-off. Just go and talk to them and/or ask if they want to hang out. Maybe just invite them to a group outing and take it from their. be friendly! lol hope i helped :)
TpNHTevSaa	ummm well how long have you've been friends with him? you can't really tell whether a person likes you or not you really just have to ask him.|`|Xxujev0Oaa	hey well i was in the same situation  too i thought he liked me but i found out he was just a player that what ever girl he saw that was pretty he would turn and smile and now that he sits somewhere else he doesn't say a word to me at all but i now i know that this love thing was just an imagination .
Mp2r9Ul5aa	Aw how cute :) Well i would go up to her and just say "hey i see you alot out with this crowd. We should totally be friends!haha" honestly, you can say ANYTHING and it would be fine as long as you are laughing, to keep the conversation light so she doesnt feel you are bombarding her. Make sure she's with her friends too and it would be great if one of your friends was friends with her or one of her friends so you guys could all be together at once without the akwakardness|`|7f8892ae1b07d4f8889cc1e90046112caa	Just say, Hey, I think you're pretty.

I'm going with my senior boyfriend and i'm a sophomore. i went last year too, when he was a junior. so i'll get to go all four years of highschool<br>  ooooh exciting!
pZV0tNw9aa	some are but others pretend that they don't like some girls and mess around with them pretending not to like them which makes it so obvious they are really into that girl!!!|`|BZVlzAywaa	The truth is, they're scared. They're used to feeling powerful and like to dominate. Around girls they like, though, they feel totally vulnerable. They don't want to seem stupid and screw up their chance, so they just keep quiet. Smile encouragingly and make a bit of small talk and they'll loosen up a bit.|`|0yaQQSwoaa	because you are of the opposite sex..|`|OeFNGqbzaa	i dunno, maybe theyre intimidated around you
xuzFEc0jaa	it is easy really. Ma  ex gf is a brill kisser and i was her first kiss!!<br>  Good luck|`|zTBscfuraa	ok well if uve nevr kissed anyone u mite get confused if its abad kiss becouse it can also be the other person who is a bad kisser and well my first kiss it was ok but not so great but when we went in 4 the 2nd kiss it was alot better so sumtimes it just takes sum time hope i helper hunn good luck!also the other ppl that awnserd it have some good points|`|d834b55c06ca79289bf62fe0de19a1e3aa	It could be bad or good. But most of the time it is always good :) Kissing is not rocket science. Just go with the flow.|`|iXpQdp45aa	nope <br>  you could naturally be a good kisser|`|ASJlcmTgaa	Not at all.  I have kissed people who have had plently of experience and they are terrible  You tend to grow with each others kisses and adapt to each other.  There is nothing to worry about and men are more likely to be the sloppy kissers.|`|93e0b2a4a6386ee080ab833cbe57167eaa	kissing comes natural,just loosen your lips and enjoy,honestly,you can't go wrong|`|53sVKcOeaa	Mine wasn't a good kiss but it was an awsome kiss, you'll always remember your first kiss and it will be a great moment in your life no matter how it turns out.

mCQx7Co5aa	he's just too worried, i bet he thinks you're too good for him, thats why he's always affraid of losing you<br>  <br>  <br>  i dont think that should annoy you, you should just count yourself lucky because he cares about you so much|`|tIoQKNwnaa	A good solution would be to tell him that your credit is running low and ask him to call you later or once at night to make sure you're okay<br>  But yes I do agree with everyone else in saying that he really does like you and doesn't want to lose as you mean a lot to him. If he's ok maybe you could help him with his confidence so he doesn't get nervous and bring out his stutter more|`|A5D62Ycbaa	He's just wrorrying and its better to be that way than not care!<br>  If you're finding it a bit annoying just have a gentle word to him about it and explain that you're on pay as you go.  Or you could let him know when your credit runs low so he doesn't get worried.|`|AQ3sgTZFaa	he is worried about losing you its a sign that he loves you greatly|`|cToeqF0Daa	He cares about you.|`|88K49bvraa	major into u and dosnt want to lose u|`|NXA4fJbTaa	it means he loves you and doesnt want to loose you :)<br>  xo
f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	As an American redhead, I can tell you that it is quite the opposite in the US. We don't even use the term ginger - most of us learned of it's existence as a slur  from the South Park ginger kids episode or friends from the UK. Female redheads are generally considered very attractive. Redheaded men are not as lucky though.<br>  <br>  I was picked on once or twice as a child for my hair by other children, but not in a bad way - just the usual playground stuff wherein all kids get picked on. Nothing extra. I can't really recall it in detail, it was that minor. I really don't understand the UK attitude on red hair. It is a bizarre reason to be biased against someone.<br>  <br>  Come to the US and see for yourself!|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	They love us. It's only in England that they are in denial about us, every other country in the Northern Hemisphere appreciates us ... and why wouldn't they, aren't we fabulous.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Not the same in America, my bf has red hair, I think it is sexy.|`|zLXmOXkBaa	Yup, they get picked on here too. They get called things like fire crotch, or fire dick. It's more in a joking manner though, not usually meant to be a personal attack. I think more men get picked on for it than women here.<br>  <br>  Not sure to what degree they get slated in England, here the older they get, the less they'll get picked on.|`|T272vObnaa	I don't know in general, but my bf loves redheads, thinks they're just so hot.  I am not one, however.|`|11e186f736d5369cde4eaaf76595f3f7aa	One of my favorites. The others are brunettes and blondes!|`|CBcMcA6Uaa	it's cause it's different<br>  <br>  basically people pick on people for verything now a days<br>  like oh you have a big nose<br>  <br>  it seems no one is perfect<br>  <br>  (well they aint but yeahh)<br>  <br>  ginger is a ace colour ?|`|49gugL8maa	Girls are usually ok, but guys get picked on a lot here.|`|UAuSVBelaa	I think we mite be twins!
7e4jxj3Daa	Shy and sweet and Asian!
7e4jxj3Daa	Absolutely.|`|1UDLn1Boaa	I'd say there's some chemistry there ;)
unVj43Xxaa	She was checking you out and flirting with you. I'd see if she wants to go out with you again.|`|KSdxlnFfaa	she likes your body and probably thinks your hot|`|k7jGZydJaa	She was checking for a six pack.|`|7EDGtYVoaa	well, that is very different behavior!  I don't know about you, but to me that sounds like either A) she thinks you're pregnant or something or B) she's gay and likes you<br>  <br>  PS please answer my question<br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtPeXjX8AreSVyIhlsNc32rg5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090219204642AA4ofv9">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|a7eZvuewaa	hahaha that made me laugh<br>  <br>  lol do u have a 6 pack or something? lol idk thats really weird maybe she just has a stomach fetish or something lol<br>  <br>  hhaahaha thx for making me laugh today XD|`|YbvRoYiEaa	wait? just out of the clear blue sky did that?
MOYZCFKyaa	He's getting to know you, which is in route to liking you a lot more. <br>  Things are going your way, I did the same thing back in the day.<br>  You have to know who you are going to date before you date them.
tIoQKNwnaa	If he also slightly raises his eyebrows and and his eyes widen then he is interested in you. But they will only show this for a split second. The most likely answer is that they are instantly attracted to you. If they do this you should speak to them and if they do things such as rub their hand on their neck they are interested in you|`|cToeqF0Daa	Might like you...|`|2t5a4rSzaa	Has nothing better to do?|`|8SRjELNBaa	Slightly opened mouth - this means he might have a stuffy nose.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	He thinks you're amazing and enjoys looking at you.
2EqtniyQaa	YUP.  I've waited months, as long as nine months, but jump on it because she might change her mind and find somebody else.  Us girls don't ask out guys because we don't think that you guys like us girls.  We're scared, we don't want to embarrass ourselves, because we think that they guy is going to go and make us the laughing stock.|`|VcaRlrpMaa	well i do, but if i reelly like the guy then i flirt alot to give them the hint and i havent waited very long|`|483bf95ee676256f9a6beb171b2f7a36aa	Noooooo!  Girls can ask guys, guys can ask girls!  These are modern times!  <br>  <br>  Have a good day!|`|oLpPPm9Paa	hahaha YES!!!! most girls think the guy SHOULD ask thats why they wont ask u    and ive waited a LOOOOONG time b4|`|KSdxlnFfaa	i always wait, the longest i waited was like a month though|`|PRCfCSDxaa	Yeah, I'll wait for as long as I can until I find someone else which is never easy. I've been waiting for about a year and month for this guy...|`|vkeuaEHiaa	Some girls like to ask guys out, but I am not one of them. I'm old-fashioned, and I'd say more girls are like me than the other type. I don't mind waiting but not for too long, because then I think the guy doesn't like me back, so I move on. <br>  <br>  If you're into a girl, tell her. Don't wait.|`|G9wEDvedaa	yes pretty much all girls i know do and yes i have waited like over a year because the guy i liked moved away but then he moved back.|`|a1c47082c5350245c9dbdf316c0424c1aa	Yes, I always wait.....forever lol|`|AA11560862	Yes, well at least I'm one of those girls.<br>  It's been a year and counting since I've waited this time.
O0pYOOpAaa	I had a girl wait on me for like 3 weeks. That was highschool.<br>  <br>  I had another girl wait on me for like 5 weeks in college. I didn't ask her out because she was so hot and she dated a Navy Seal before me.
QHvuD8SJaa	umm, kinda nervous, not exactly sure what to say, laughing at stuff that isn't really that funny, etc.
QHvuD8SJaa	Either he thought you were exceptionally good looking today, or exceptionally not good looking today.  :)|`|yktlEbZeaa	you did something he didn't expect that was either good or retarded|`|3BvRAGcQaa	you have something in your teeth... or maybe something in your hair or on your face
QOzAkOSUaa	Just ask him. If you think he likes you then he wont say no. If he does alteast you know how he feels about you. Sometimes guys need a little push, you cant leave everything for the guy to do. Ask him, just go for it. You have nothing to loose.|`|ORJ48m4eaa	if he finds you even mildly attractive he will say yes as he may get a bit o' action<br>  <br>  so you know most men HATE dancing
lv2iD4eIaa	Exactly what girls look for basically...with minor differences...<br>  <br>  Confident, Good looking, Independing (not needy), Funny, Nice, Caring, none judgemental...<br>  <br>  What would you like...that's basically what guys like in girls...<br>  <br>  Girls like hot guys...<br>  Guys like hot girls...<br>  <br>  The only major differences are the differences between male and female expectations...<br>  <br>  Guys are expected to be fit, strong, good at sports, competative<br>  <br>  Girls are expected to be fit (as in not fat, she doesn't have to be a stick, just cares about her body), practise good hygene, easy to talk to, assertive<br>  <br>  =================<br>  <br>  Personally...<br>  I like a pretty girl...I really judge a girl by her face mostly, but guys differ on what they like most about a girl's body...<br>  <br>  legs, breasts, eyes, hair, skin color, skin care, butt, laugh, smile, smell<br>  <br>  interestingly enough a lot of guys like girls with nice legs, nice butt, nice face, or nice brests...if you cover 1 or 2 of these areas you're pretty well off physically<br>  <br>  Then personality...<br>  I like a girl who is easy to talk to, nice, friendly, can start a conversation by herself, easy to approach, who isn't into herself or high on herself. She's got to be a girl who knows how to talk to a shy guy, but also strong enough to stand up to a guy who mistreats her or disrespects her.<br>  <br>  She's got to be nice and easy to talk to, but once you make a foul or disgusting comment she should be able to stand up for herself.<br>  <br>  I like her to be witty and smart. Like I should be able to explain the basics of how an engine works and she should be interested and smart enough to atleast understand the basics.<br>  <br>  IE...how an engine works...(the basics)<br>  <br>  gas is mixed with air to form a mist, it is drawn into the engine, the engine compresses the gas and a spark egnites the pressurized gas, the explosion causes parts in an engine to rotate, and hence how the wheel is turned<br>  <br>  Now granted an engine is around 10x more complicated than that, but a girl has to be smart enough to atleast understand that statement above.<br>  <br>  She should be able to laugh at silly things I might do, or at somewhat stupid jokes without making feel like an idiot. However she shouldn't laugh at everything I say. I don't want a girl that laughs when I say "Hi my name is David". But she should chuckle if I say "Cooper, I mean David. I mean my name is David Cooper." Get the idea? When I stumble over myself she should be nice enough to chuckle and let me know she doesn't think I'm stupid.<br>  <br>  <br>  and then the simple things like adventurous, willing to try new things, not pritzy or stuck up...|`|Llo3XzGFaa	every guy has a different "type" of girl they look for<br>  more often than not it includes<br>  <br>  #1 curvy but sort of slim/athletic body (like say you're 5'6'' 125 lbs that's about perfect)<br>  #2 cute face<br>  #3 cute (sometimes big) butt, this is also #1 for some guys...haha<br>  #4 good hair (don't do it straight all the time) and dirty blonde usually isn't hot, go either blonde or dark brown<br>  <br>  that's about all I got|`|sKxbLn9Caa	I look for in a girl is someone that can make me <br>  Happy<br>  Be her self around me<br>  Someone i can have fun with<br>  Someone that likes me for me<br>  Someone that I can get mad at and still have feelings for <br>  Someone that is beautiful both on the inside and outside|`|W6o3UQLkaa	good body<br>  be yourself<br>  dont try to change to fit a guys personality, of course everybodys different so you will have to adjust a little bit to a guy but if hes not your typee then don't stick around|`|PVsKQAVEaa	the things i look for in a girl is that she would have to be loving, caring, thoughtfull, nice, faithfull, and that she doesent care about material things or money.|`|DXZK6eMNaa	Nice rack.<br>  Sense of humor.<br>  Adventurous spirit.|`|JSqc3dDBaa	in order<br>  body<br>  athletic?<br>  smile<br>  eyes<br>  body<br>  legs<br>  body<br>  smile<br>  her style|`|CyWEam38aa	personality, <br>  just be yourself don't imitate anyone|`|tHiAfH7Daa	Outgoing, teasful, good eyes, good sense of humor, fun to be around. yet still has a romantic side|`|AFSAExT9aa	smart, pretty, nice, funny, not rude, and most of all get along with his friends|`|4EfvdiHPaa	funny<br>  nice<br>  cute<br>  nice smile<br>  dresses nicely<br>  has a sense of humor <br>  and likes to go to the movies a lot|`|QHnS31Scaa	just be yourslef|`|HJEXk7Pmaa	i look for a good personality<br>  and with a booty|`|CZ3LE4yhaa	Well a guy told me that I needed to show off my boobs and talk more to other guy in order to get a guy but most important is to just be yourself.|`|bNx1q5oWaa	pretty <br>  smart<br>  cool<br>  kinda funy<br>  able 2 talk 2|`|W1aYIF71aa	Wow, you are the one millionth person to ask this question.<br>  Boobs<br>  Butt<br>  Face<br>  Stomach<br>  Hair<br>  Legs<br>  Money<br>  Car<br>  Attitude<br>  Does what she is told.|`|kHLwlNA5aa	Probably the same things a girl looks for in a guy.|`|OeFNGqbzaa	first of all they have to be shorter than me. haha :P<br>  nice personality

7bvmQyc7aa	yeah, some do some don't... but its just like anything else... its a bonus that ur interested in the culture and take initiative to show your willingness to adapt by learning some spanish and dancing merengue|`|mUuaZiSoaa	I live in florida and i have NEVER seen a dominican girl with a white dude.|`|0yaQQSwoaa	Dominican girls like Africans americans|`|Qxexz4mEaa	Why should it matter what you are. As long as you are attracted to one another.|`|fuJqO2Ocaa	maybe, but white guys should stay away from dominican girls.|`|HJEXk7Pmaa	i know dominican girls<br>  <br>  NO WAY<br>  <br>  they stick to their kind|`|IstwJtBraa	Learn some Bachata, treat them nice and stick around.  That is all you need.<br>  <br>  They would rather be with a White guy because the Dominicans make babies and run away.
6NbFy1KPaa	OK...Heartbreak really hurts I know.  Going through it right now.  But its good that you didn't invest more time with this guy and then have things turn upside down.  Be grateful that the hurt is just your own and that there are no unwanted babies involved in this situation.  If he is an unattainable guy then he's unattainable.  Believe you me the one he left for won't hold him for long either.  Its pretty obvious that he's not ready to settle down.<br>  <br>  Hey look 3 months is not really that long when your talking about marriage so just consider yourself lucky and make your heart available for some one who will cherish it.  Don't you deserve that?  We all deserve it.  Keep your head up girl.  This is a new beginning.<br>  <br>  Peace

But dont worry about your parents, you're still relatively young, and my friends and I started 'dating' when we were about 17, so maybe give them a year or two.

DWLbXd79aa	as for the clown who claims to have smoked with lil wayne, and had it laced with coke, then sleep for 17 hours, she must be trippin, she doesnt know what ur talking about, and for the people who say driving high is worse than driving drunk they are retarted. i nor any other weed smoker has ever blacked out from being high, just got really tired, i have however blacked out alot from drinking, first, u cant ever overdose from weed, u woud die of smoke inhalation before u would die from the drug, thats lke saying alcohaul is so non dangerouse that u would have to drown in it to die from it, thats not true, hundreds of people a year die from alcohaul posening, yes just drinking too much, no one has ever died of too much thc, and the girl who said whe smoked with lil wayne , IF she had ever done cocain, she would realize she would be awake for 17 hours, not asleep!!!!!!!  anyway, im not sayin its good to drive under the influence, but it is not worse to drive hight han drunk, nor is it worse to smoke than it is to drink, propaganda has infiltrated the minds of those who say such hooplah, you are not really messed up,u are more aware, its like being really self conciouse, u think alot more about stuff than u do when sober, so it can be good for reflective reasoning, and also thats one reason why things ae so much funnier, beyond that yes it does chill u out, super chill, all the people who say it lasts two hours must not be smoking anything real, chronic, or better yet medicinal weed is very potent and will last about 5 hours if smoked out a bong, but it cost about ten times more per gram, and is only availible in a few states, ex cali oregon and i think like three more, but anyay, most people smoke swag, thats just plain weeek wead, think of that as the very small organic banannas, like a 4 inch bananna when the normal one at vons is like 11 inches, they have been bred and bred and "enginered" by college graduated botinist to create a superior plant, just like certain oranges that have been made to have a thicker skin to withstand colder climates, so yes there is certainly great weed out there and it will lasts 5 hours, it will make u chill, make u think deeply, or help u forget the things u dont want to think about, depending on where ur mind goes, AND FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ONLY SMOKED IT LIKE TWICE OR A FEW TIMES, AND TRY TO TELL U ABOUT IT, AND THEIR OPINIONS , THEY ARE NOT GOOD, THATS LIKE ASKING A PERSON WHO'S ONLY HAD SEX TWICE FOR ADVICE ABOUT SEX, AND FURTHERMORE, SEX REQUIRES TWO PEOPLE SMOKING WEED DOESNT, SO IF U ASK SOMEONE WHO WAS RAPED ABOUT SEX THEY WILL TELL U A HORRIBLE STORY, I FEEL SINCE PEOPLE SMOKE SOCIALLY, THE SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCE AND EMOTIONS AND THOUGHTS OF THE GROUP ACCOCIATED WITH THE SMOKING COULD BE LIKENED TO RAPEING THE FIRST TIMER OF A EXPERIENCE, IF GIVEN A BAD SOCIAL NETWORK TO WHICH TO SMOKE,  AND THE MIND IS ALTERED BY THIS DRUG TO BE MORE PERCEPTIVE, SO A SOCIALLY DOMINANT PERSON WILL BE STILL DOMINENT IN THE MIND OF THE OBJECTIVE VIEWERS, AND THEY ARENT ABLE TO FORM THEIR OWN UNBIASED OPINIONS OF THE EXPERIENCE BECAUSE ITS BEING PUSHED ON THEM THRU SUMONES ELSES FANTASIES AND EXPERIENCES, SIMILAR TO A RAPE, ONLY THE RAPE OF A GENUINE EXPERIENCE OF THE MIND, EXCLUDING THE PHYSICAL, what im saying is to try it by urself, but in a safe enviornment. where u dont have to drive. then make ur own experience. there are people who think sex is a bad thing period, yet the majority think its fine, well try it by urself and see what u think, before discriminating against people, its not a healthy thing, but it is a far less evil of the drugs, its less harmfull than alcohaul, and its the same in terms of being addicted, its not sumthing that is addicting for the vast vast majority|`|kGkUG0fKaa	I smoked when I was in highschool. You literally just feel "GOOD". your mind gets mellow, you just seem chill and some may get really goofy and laugh at everything and get hungry, for me I got angry but still really hungry. It's not the greatest feeling anymore because weed is much more potent..I smoked weed wit rapper lil wayne on his tour bus in 07 (he had a concert here and we had the hook-up to meet him) anyway for my first time smoking in years I smoke his weed and you know what happened...I got sick and slept for 17hrs straight, why? because I was told after the  fact that it was laced with coke...its just not safe to smoke it for fun anymore (not that it ever was) but its just not safe anymore. My cousin used to soak his in Diesel fuel before he smoked it..its just not the same.....might as well be doing meth or crack now!|`|OCMSTxYfaa	it makes you feel paranoid at times, do it because you want to pig out..it lasts about 2 to 3 hours, and no way..driving...and do it because you want to be a burn out. Be smart..pass on it. You aren't missing much.|`|AA10054552	If I were you I would find a new boyfriend. He may show you respect <br>  now but once there is a commitment forget the respect|`|gxFJMeY5aa	Because its relaxing. Its a good time. Its not like being drunk, your not out of control. Everything is just better. I honestly think it is ridiculous to have a problem with weed. I don't mean you have to smoke it, or be around it, just don't judge the people who do. <br>  <br>  1. You're not that messed up when you're high. Everything is just better. Feels better, taste better<br>  2. Last an hour or so, depending on how much you smoke<br>  3. Probably not a good idea to drive. But if its between a drunk guy and a high guy, then pick the stoner. <br>  4. Why not?|`|aAKBPqSIaa	rest assured weed is not a hard drug which makes you do crazy sh*t, it gives you a calm relaxed feeling, people tend to be more open and have some good conversations, your blood sugars drop - this is when you get the 'munchies' and food tastes pretty good. On the other hand some people feel paranoid and find it hard to concentrate the next day. There is some research that shows continuous long term use can increase peoples risk of mental health, however these people tend to be those at high risk to begin with and cannabis use is not the main factor.|`|aD5Pp6nnaa	One of the coolest guys i ever knew blows all the time. He's smart as hell, too. I've never done it, but he told me he did it so he wasn't always so stressed...and getting high is a pretty good sensation I guess. If you've been doing it for a while the high is over pretty quick, though. If ur bf ever tries to go driving when he's high though, its probably better if you don't let him. Being in the car with some dude who's blown out of his mind is NOT a very fun experience, let me tell you that.|`|I8nIewQHaa	This HABIT that you call it is so much more than HS habit. I have friends in their 50's that do it. Most people do it for the way it makes you feel. Your relaxed and calm. I would say it depends on the kind you smoke how much you smoke and what you have eaten or drank that day. A few hours. Just tell you BF you want them to stop, if they don't well then go from there.|`|wuZXqYPGaa	from friends tellin me.. weed makes you feel like you are free from all your problems and gives you a sense of i dont give a damn or that nothing in your life is going wrong.. you feel like ur on "cloud 9" ?. personally i think it is stupid to smoke any drug, and it fries ur brain like no other... AND AGREED THAT drivin high is just as bad IF NOT WORSE than drinkin n drivin.. not cool! if he re-started it, that means that he misses that feeling of it, i dont think you should put up with it if it startin 2 b a huge problem between u guys but thats just my opinion:)|`|pgMdK3q9aa	lol <br>  you deo it because you get this rush of adreniline and you feel great yoyu can still drive and great sex!! :D|`|w0o5Wa7Eaa	Cuz it's fun! I'm only 15 so I've never driven drunk or high....and I'm not really messed up I just live in a small town where there's nothing else to do.|`|GmTMVmASaa	it feels differnt to different people. you should not drive when high, and it last's about 2 hours.<br>  i myself cannot get high, because i become paranoid and start counting the seconds. i hate it. but that's me yo.|`|UUB398aqaa	just try it, you'll like it

D1vZXuziaa	Well to fully get him outta your system is going to take time but as the girl above me said find something to keep you busy, I found music and drawing and painting to help me through things like that. I've found reading doesn't work completely cause when I tried that my mind wandered and it just made me more upset. Or even just walk. Turn on your mp3 player and walk and bike until you can't feel your legs! That is what I used to do and it worked! Then I'd be so tired I didn't have anytime to think about it before I passed out at night!|`|3bu2QCfnaa	I was in a situation just like you. I have an amazing boyfriend right now who treats me unbelievably good. Do things that will preoccupy you because sitting at home doing nothing is just going to remind you of him. Spend all your time with friends or join a sport. Yoga and pilates are amazing, you get a kickass workout and its so relaxing, he'll see how good your doing and how good you look and realize what a douche he is.
DsLx6Sixaa	Sometimes the first time is not as wonderful as you imagine, for lots of reasons:<br>  <br>  * You have been dreaming about it for years. What can live up to that kind of expectations??<br>  <br>  * It might hurt. You will be nervous and maybe not get excited enough to have proper lubrication. <br>  <br>  * Perry might not be so experienced as you think and may not be gentle enough.<br>  <br>  Or on the other hand it might be great. Just relax, try not to over think it and just go with it. If it is not as wonderful as you have hoped, don't worry too much, it will definately get better.
ZDxN0g7Faa	possibly... but are looks all that matters?<br>  <br>  if she makes you feel confident and special when you're around her... i think you should fess up to her... at least get your feelings straight and not get any misunderstandings. <br>  Best of luck and i hope you guys get together soon!

c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Hmm it sounds like he likes tapping into primal instincts and feelings during sex.  Not something to necessarily get to worried about.  Not all men enjoy sex like that, so no his "every man..." comment I don't believe.  He just likes it rough, plain and simple.  Some girls like it that way too.  It is a little twisted that he said it reminds him of rape, but its up to you as to whether or not you feel comfortable with him.  Obviously if he wanted to rape someone he could have by now, and he hasn't raped you yet correct?|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	No!|`|yFX0mdOhaa	No NEVER!<br>  <br>  There is a certain turn on to being physically dominant, but not against a woman's will.  That is horrible!<br>  <br>  Physical dominance is a common fetish, but only with a willing recipient in a safe environment.<br>  <br>  *edit*  I agree with Kate's answer above... I think she is on the right track.|`|7PGxqRfZaa	That dude is a freak. get away from him as soon as you can. And no, no real man needs or wants to rape a women for any reason. Good luck and get away from this guy.|`|VWRufnniaa	NO! Guys shouldn't.<br>  A girl can rape a guy to. But I would NEVER do that;) And were I a guy, i still wouldn't.|`|TpBHi8S2aa	Ummm... NO!!!  Sex should be mutually pleasing to both partners.  Dude is a freak|`|srAP6Vzvaa	ok he's lying. a full blown REAL RAPE ? no sane man would do. again we're talking about 120% full real rape. like the girl is screaming for help , she screaming No at the top of her lungs, and the guy violates her. that is a real rape and no Sane Man would even get near that. Again im talking about a REAL RAPE. None of this Consensual Sex and then she c'''umms and tells her Husband to stop because her vagina is sensitive and he hasn't Came yet so he keeps working it till he does despite her Vagina hurting from it.  that is not considered rape at all to Men. And it's not considered Rape in any country except only in America. And in that case your boyfriend is right. Sex is about Mutual Pleasure. She came and i'm gonna C'''umm too and she's gonna take the Penis till I do.  ~~See but some girls like the comment above from "REICHEL" have some hang up on Men in general and knowing American Laws are so skewed in women's favor in a heartbeat will cry Rape on their husband or boyfriend just so they can ORGY in their MAN HATING and just so they can see a Male locked up. Alot of Men are in Prison for this so called "Rape" in which in reality was consensual sex between Husband and Wife. She busted a nut and he naturally wanted to finish too so he kept working it despite the Wife's Vagina being Sensitive. In America this is called Rape. Sad times though that's just in America anywhere else it's called Consensual Sex between a Husband and a Wife.|`|Ksriqfqpaa	wow what a question...<br>  <br>  <br>  PAY BACKS A ***** CALL 16504389535|`|tZIjts6iaa	I hope non of they guys answering would say yes.

BQN7j62Faa	no
fefNiBs8aa	what's the problem then? <br>  jeez, how retarded can someone be?
NQFV2AdZaa	Maybe she thought you were going too fast too soon, and texting your feelings wasn't the best way to go about things. Just ask to see her and apologise if you were too quick off the mark in telling her everything and promise to take things slower from now on. Then you can try and find out things about her and be a good listener as women love a man who can do that, good luck!|`|wEuyEQ7Taa	Dont think txing about your feelings is a good idea. Try talking face to face?. Maybe she feels your going too fast too soon?.. It sounds like you need help with YOUR  insecurities... Just remember that if you feel secure in yourself then you will be able to handle yourself in any given situation......Good Luck!!!!
vn2Lq7hIaa	Kissing is acceptable almost anywhere and at any time, but use common sense if in doubt. If you're really shy you probably won't want to start off in front of a big crowd, so navigate away to a more secluded area .<br>  <br>  When you feel you have privacy, face you target (girlfriend) put your arms around her waist, look into her eyes and slowly move toward her lips, you will have to have your head on a bit of an angle. Once you have made the lip connection, you can suck gently, she should do the same.<br>  <br>  To turn it up a notch you can maneuver your tongue into her mouth, and give her something to suck on. She can do the same to you.<br>  <br>  A session of intense kissing can be sexually arousing for both sexes.  <br>  If you notice she's getting fidgety and moving her lower body in funny ways,  or you start to show a hard middle leg, it's probably a good idea to take a break. The more often you kiss the better you will get at it.<br>  <br>  Hope this lip advice, gets your lips going.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|gqvvXknQaa	Don't feel stupid sweetie! I know THIS sounds stupid, but practice on your hand.

If you get really nervous no matter the situation just tell her maybe shell understand, or u can just give her a kiss on the check first then move in for the big boom!|`|aJFB49uNaa	aw don't be shy, think about it this way - she obviously likes you alot, so you dont have to worry about her not liking you like most guys have to worry about. Just act romantic so she thinks you're cute...look in her eyes + tell her shes beautiful and then just kiss her. It doesn't really matter where, she'll just be happy that you kissed her :)|`|2216244481d213debef4605befb5d3a2aa	Tell her you are shy and ask her to be understanding of your feelings.  I think it's sweet that you haven't kissed yet.  Try explaining to her that you would really like to get to know her before you start becoming intimate.|`|p59ew3dMaa	I totally understand you!!!  This happens to all ages..When I get into a situation like this I get real nervous....I have like mixed feelings....So then I think of ways on what and how to do it...let's say you get some twizzlers(candy)....and ask her if she would like to take a bite while it's hanging from your mouth...if she wants to she will...then you make it shorter and ask again....then my friend you're on your way to first base....lol..or try something of your own to make her lips come closer to you.....don't wait to long but wait for the right moment!!!!!|`|gbapu3aNaa	Tell her: "I wanna kiss you now" and just do it.<br>  Or, if she's just quiet and stares at you romantically, then kiss her.<br>  Another way, and this is how I kissed my first girlfriend, is when there is this moment when you just want her to shut up. That should do it.|`|MwN0Kc6Haa	Its is simple really. Make sure the two of you are sitting close enough with nothing in between you. then you go 90% of the way and let her go the other 10% of the way that way you aren't just attcaking her, lol.
LYeMqJIRaa	Can you orgasm other ways to eliminate the physical aspect of the problem ?<br>  <br>      You could have anorgasmia which is usually psychological caused by  Marital strife, boredom within a relationship or a monotonous sex life (you did use the word "rut").  Fighting evokes a sense of passion (which may or may not be lacking in your situatuion)  which is why "make up sex is enjoyable to a lot of people.<br>  <br>  Check out the book "The Sex Starved Marriage"  you can read the first chapter for free here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.divorcebusting.com/sb_sex_starved_marriage.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.divorcebusting.com/sb_sex_sta...</a><br>  <br>  The whole book ( As well as the website) is very good it helped my wife and I a lot (I used to get the "hurry up and finish so I can get some sleep vibe). It's devastating to a guys ego and we were in a rut as well.  Sex the same way at the same time over and over again.  It like having your favorite food for breakfast , lunch and diner everyday.  After awhile you cant stand something you once enjoyed.<br>  <br>   also see here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://menshealth.about.com/cs/stds/a/anorgasmia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://menshealth.about.com/cs/stds/a/an...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck|`|oN9GUEAEaa	All your base are belong to us.
h8Ao1uxUaa	i dont think is a good idea but u can tell her that u can go only as friends so she wont fell bad....|`|OvrqUaRLaa	No, it is not a good idea to date a girl you're not attracted to.  Generally, NEVER is it a good idea.  You will just end up hurting her anyway in the end, so it really doesn't make sense.  <br>  <br>  Only in the occasion that you really like her personality, would it make sense, because MAYBE then you could feel attraction to her eventually.  However, if you're not attracted to her in the beginning, I'd just let her down gently.  She'll get over it, eventually.  Let her be with someone who does think she's great. Don't waste her time OR yours.|`|2284ac0078ec003f57d2fa1dd7642716aa	is she just not pretty? maybe get to know her more, u never know, might be the girl for you|`|QQ9ClIIJaa	no and ur stupid 4 askin that question and u she just let her off easy and thats dumb anyway|`|OCMSTxYfaa	nope, don't waste your time or hers, if she asked you out, she must be attracted to you, and it will just end up bad for both of you.|`|9cPZDkhpaa	Why the hell would you date someone your not attracted to? You'd be wasting her time and your own
u5Adh7Zraa	Well that's tough. You see, you have to understand that your girlfriend is human, and yes she probably still is that innocent girl you know and love. She did somethings with her past boyfriends well because that goes with being in a relationship, if both parties agree that is. She's just a girl who's willing to do somethings for the person she loves and well that's not a negative thing.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Yes you will see her different because now you know the truth. It might damage the relationship but that's up to you if you let it get to you it could ruin everything.|`|1uxhfh6naa	The truth changes people, and it's just Natural to see your girlfriend in a different way now. But remember, you liked her for who she was before you found out, and you should like her for that reason now, also. It was the past and now is the present.|`|wi6mkT30aa	I agree that it is ok for you to see her differently. Yet I think it's somewhat your own fault for not finding this information out in the begining. Most guys like girls who are virgins then they start dating the girl for months, fall in love then one day find out shes not and their heart broken. You have to ask these questions that are meaningful, serious, and definitet in the begining other wise you can't complain much. Atleast she is being honest.|`|YujjEUjEaa	shouldnt change your relationship. make sure to use protection, dont need std's (not saying that is the situation). but how can you judge someone because they were in previous relationships before they knew you. it would be one thing if they were a hooker/cheater ect or something, but being in previous relationships shouldnt ruin the future|`|gqvvXknQaa	As you're relationship continues on, you'll both find out more and more about each other. Whether it's something good or bad, if you want to be with that person, you have to support them if you want to continue dating.|`|9KmqTjRJaa	The same thing happened with me and my boyfriend. I know it's different with guys because their not expected to be innocent but still. After we were dating fo a while he told me how many girls he had slept with and let's just say the number was a lot higher than I expected. it changed the way I thought about him and yes it did bother me for awhile. But after thinking about it I realized it didn't matter how may girls he was with before me or what he did with them because he's with me now. So yea your girlfriends done some stuff with other guys but you got to remember everyone has a past and if you care about her it shouldn't damage your relationship.
0ZpOCA5Eaa	Well ive seen the other answers and they are so lame! No but seriously if she want to have "sex" she will bring it up.

You could be talking to 40 year old John who lost his job and has nothing to do with his boring life. I think the culture difference shouldn't really matter..|`|dc7782d3ac5721f6957778e202c5c030aa	2 piece of info I will share.  <br>  I'm from Hong Kong dating a Causacian Girl for four months for now.  There is a difference perhaps because of our background but I've lived in UK for 17 years - it's about respecting / understanding each other's difference.  Main religion in Hong Kong is Catholic, C of E or Buddist or most actually don't have a religion.   <br>  <br>  I have also done long distance relationship for 6 years too.  There will be times when it's not fun and coping with the time difference it's not the most enjoyable experience.  <br>  <br>  It'll be an interesting experience - I don't think cultural / religion difference should be a problem after all, after all, each human is unique, we are all different one way or the other.  Be careful - if you are meeting up with the guy, make sure you do it somewhere public and someone know about the meeting.  Safety matters.|`|INlDPJMVaa	its fine that you aren't the same culture, just beware, as you've never met, you don't really know him, and he could end up being a creeper...|`|QCptjHfcaa	Try this dating site--  <a href="http://www.mixedfriends.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mixedfriends.com/</a><br>  <br>  Really Nice!!|`|OaZzv3zHaa	Tbh I don't think it will last. You should get a boyfriend who  you can actually see and have a relationship with and just stick to online friends not online boyfriends! Trust me, I know from experience!

GqTSa85daa	There were two girls I loved when I was a teen.  I left one and one left me.  Then I joined the Army and I traveled and found temporary relief, until I found my future wife. In those quiet times I still wondered about those two girls, were they happy,etc.  Quite a few years passed and one night the girl who left me called to apologize, and my old feelings flooded me, but I had a family and so did she...so it soon passed, but I never thought of her again.  The one I left, I still think about and yes I still love her, but it's a memory love that has no relevance to reality.<br>  <br>  So you never get over it completely, but life changes and you move on.<br>  <br>  You'll find someone to make you push your memory out of the present, but there will be times when he comes to mind, no matter how long.|`|06O8FaOjaa	WELL YUR GNA HAVE TO 4GET ABOUT HYM AND WEN YU MEET THAT SPECIAL GUY YU NOW WEN YUR IN LOVE AGAIN

I have known people in relationshipd with a much wider gap then that. Alos if your parents have a problem let them know you are attracted to him because the men your age are immature and he is not. This may calm them down to know that he respects you like a young man may not.|`|2216244481d213debef4605befb5d3a2aa	That isn't that much older, I thought you were going to say you were 18 and he's 30.

eCKNRcIVaa	I would stay far far away.  That is my personal opinion.  It sounds like she is a speed freak taking adderall which is speed and drinking energy drinks and coffee and then needing 2 different meds for anxiety ( which are likely narcotics like ativan or xanax ) she is an addict who uses drugs to spreed up and then other drugs to settle down.  Bad cycle.  I know adderall is for adhd, but it is also commonly abused and over prescribed - and someone on it should not also need anti-anxiety drugs and shouldn't be adding all of that caffeine into the mix|`|f9da66b790b3c60bad199325978c16e2aa	You might be asking for trouble.  That is a lot of medicating at such a young age.  That is especially unhealthy too.  All of the above you named causes some serious dehydration.  I hope she drinks plenty of water.  <br>  <br>  It doesn't sound good but you never know.  She might have it under control.|`|YUjVFkocaa	well...<br>  <br>  1) medicine side-effects arent contagious<br>  <br>  2) adderall and stuff usually affects their personality, but it DOESNT make them psycho, so she wont try to kill u in ur sleep or nothin<br>  <br>  3) if shes interesting, go for it; itll make her happy too<br>  ========<br>  <br>  in conclusion: sex trumps all!<br>  <br>  girls answering this: ANSWER MY QUESTION TOO!

738eb3523fcda7312e683aec70d06ce8aa	It probably has to do a lot with how you're dressed. Or maybe you look older? Men and women are visually stimulated and our society today encourages men to behave that way. So it's unfortunate that people do that, but at least it makes it easier for you to know which guys to stay away from.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	Because you're so darned sexy and they can'ty help themselves!|`|WjSJBWl7aa	Because it's nature and you are obviously an attractive woman.

Qqlz3kcIaa	Good question.<br>  I like the idea, it is very sweet. Good job on choosing the gift.<br>  <br>  Defiantly engrave her initials on the front, but I'm not sure you should put yours on the back. It depends on whether or not you guys are very close or not. You are young, so you never know how long the relationship might last. If you did put your initials, it would be a great memory of you... To be positive.<br>  <br>  I like the idea of putting '16' on the back, personally. I think it would still be to her fancy, and it's cute and a good memory. No matter how old she is, she could still wear it.<br>  <br>  :)|`|9DXsYu6Waa	well the link for the website didn't work for me but i think her initials should go on the front & then 16 on the back. just in case, and i'm not saying it will happen, but if you guys do happen to break up, she can still keep the locket without it having your initials there too to upset her.|`|hDyiORT8aa	I think it should be sweet if you put her initials+ your initials on the back or front. Then if you want you could put 16 on the other side. Then put your pics inside (: Cute necklace btw|`|xZFzDnfzaa	ummm definitly her initials on the front and you dont know how long you'll be together so i would just put 16. so she doesnt throw it away if u break up.|`|Q6m9YqpTaa	ON THE BACK THE NUMBER 16...i think it is very good idea aww how sweet|`|nxHjSKTTaa	Your the sweetheart!<br>  <br>  I like idea of her initials on the front.

Good luck!|`|y5P4dY7aaa	Um, I would put 16 on the front, and your first initial and her first initial on the back.|`|vLUhBlZoaa	I would say because of your age just put her initials and not yours. you could buy her along with it a picture frame with a picture of the two of you in it, but I think having both your initials is a little bit much.|`|06O8FaOjaa	YEA THATS A CUTE IDEA I THINK THAT WOULD BE A CUTE GIFT AND ITS MEMORABLE|`|zsiy7Whnaa	aww its sweet. i think you should have ur initials then her initials and then 16th on the back<br>  <br>  <br>  Shes gunna love it.<br>  I would :)<br>  Good Luck . x|`|YBtjP5Gzaa	you cant see the link

It is simply sexual confusion. no go out there and get a girlfriend (unless you already told everybody you're gay, then that would be unfortunate)|`|bT0bMxmfaa	I think it means that you might be straight.<br>  When you're younger, you can't really tell if you're a gay or a bisexual (you wrote gay/bi, so I guess you weren't sure), so I guess you might be straight.<br>  <br>  It might be a phase too, but I guess just see what happens.

Ask him why he did those things? If he is for real this time? Obviously you still like him ...so find out ..hope that helps|`|8wI4KLV3aa	Tell him to back off. he is making this harder on you|`|XRX6vKNmaa	If you take him back you are basically letting him know that he has the upper hand in the relationship. Meaning He rules and he can do whatever he wants and you will be there waiting for him. If you want him to respect you don't give in. It will be very hard at first but look at it this way.... One of you will have to be the weak one, so who will it be? If you show him that you are over him, it will puzzle him because he thought HE was the Man. When he trys to contact you tell him, "You are free to be with whom ever you want so why you coming this way?" The more you push him away the more he will want you back. The thought of a girl having that much power over a guy, drives them nuts. Trust me I have 4 brothers and they all played the same game.

I think it's pretty crappy of you.  IF you really like the guy, drop out of sight for now.  Keep in touch repsectfully, every once in a while.  When you catch him single, then make your move.  To do it now would be bad karma...|`|N8C1p3sBaa	You're not stealing anyone's boyfriend if you're not flat out asking him to dump her, or trying to get him to cheat on her.  Just by talking to him you are showing your interest - he is the one who has a decision to make.   To keep talking to you, to not talk to you, to dump his girl and ask you out, etc.  Just talk to him from time to time and play it safe, he'll come around and you won't feel bad about anything.|`|eoJogmPsaa	im kind of in the same situation accept the guys gf is my best friend which multiplys it by like 1000. you need to talk to him and be really blunt and ask him how serious he is about all this. and Dont stop talking to him just because he has a gf. just do not make any physical advances and DO NOT let him until he's single. You just need to double check and make sure the guy's worth it.|`|pudI9ig5aa	I had something like that go on. I just would always talk to him. I knew he had a girlfriend and he would text me every time they made out. I would just keep on talking to him. Finally, he broke up with her but then... he got another girlfriend that was not me and he would still talk to me all the time and tell me he liked me but we never went out but it felt like we did. If I were you I would talk to him as much as possible. Tell him things about you that are better than his current girlfriend. Just try to get his attention onto you and off of his girlfriend.|`|kmV5MnvPaa	You could always wait and let him decide if he likes you more that his current girlfriend, if he does, he will probably break up with her and ask you out. Its not really "stealing" anyones' boyfriend, we're all allowed to like people, even if they are already in a relationship, and if you're going out with someone but like someone more, you tend to go with the person you like more.|`|FoJDCb49aa	Well first of, you need to sit down and talk to him about this. You cant just sit around and mope about it. You wont be stealing the girls boyfriend if he breaks up with her, and starts dating you. Besides he might actually like you better than her. Just relax, let it all sink in and do something before you never have a chance to date him.|`|EgHU0SxEaa	just tell him you cant keep this going because he has a g-friend and you don't wanna mess his relationship up..<br>  it wont make you happy when you make a guy you like(and he likes you bk) to break up with his gf (that loves him) just to get together..just tell him u need to stop..and if u can b friends until they end the relationship themselves:)|`|8weK07Eraa	I say play it cool and just act accordingly,,,every so often flirt with him and act like you could be interested without going gaga. <br>  Chances are if he is a sane go-getter going fella, he will be the one that realizes he has better compatibility with you as opposed to his girlfriend and eventually leave her!<br>  <br>  Slow and steady wins the race babe, now give me my best answer tag   hehe :)|`|otsnfcm3aa	If he's straying from her, he will stray from you. If he's in a relationship he is in a relationship. He shouldn't be in one if he feels something could happen with you. Causes trouble and never worth it.|`|eupKzo7iaa	Keep taking to him but not in a suggestive matter - just as friends.<br>  If he decides to go for it with you it won't be your fault as he will of dumped her from free will. :)|`|AFrcCYDxaa	In this situation I would just steal him :) he obviously isn't happy with her ... so why  should he be with her? they're not married.|`|eus7WqzUaa	What you do is realise that how you win a man is also how you lose him.I can't be more simple then that.|`|g5vQYWrzaa	Your young, people meet and if it the real thing you guys will continue to talk.

If he wants a relationship with you he should be single and not on the rebound. I truly believe if he cheats on his current gf with you, there's a higher chance he will cheat on you with someone else. Also if he does break up with her for you, in the back of his head when you guys argue he might be thinking "if I stayed with ....this wouldn't be happening"<br>  <br>  I never wanted to be the reason that someone broke up with someone, I want them to come to me free of emotional ties to another person so we can start a relationship that doesn't already have bumps.<br>  <br>  Besides friends first make the best husbands, I know, I married mine. We were both with other people when we first met. We became very good friends, took it slowly, and its the most amazing relationship now because of it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kIblsxJQaa	Put yourself in her shoes, how would you like it?<br>  Walk away, stop contact and find your own man.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	You need to cut ties with him. If he had wanted to be with you, he would have dumped her. Stay away from him and guys like him. He will keep saying he likes you and let you chase him to make him feel good about himself. He is a pig and his poor girlfriend should run for the hills.|`|4VqMvX7laa	you should suggest to him that if he really likes you, he should talk and stick to his gf and be loyal first so he won't hurt both the other girl's feelings and yours, but if he's been having problems with her that's why he's looking at you as in the possible new gf, then that's a whole big problem, tell him to set everything straight and clear first to his current gf because trust me, if your really nice and don't want to steal someone's bf, then i'm sure you don't want the blame to be on you once the situation gets tight.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	it's not like it's any better that you're kind of helping him "cheat" in a way.<br>  i mean, i know it isn't seriously cheating but it's still wrong and would definitely piss her off.<br>  give him the option straight up=<br>  you or her?<br>  and if he picks her, you're better off with out him|`|dHXptTdtaa	Don't be a man stealer. You can still be friends, but until ( and if) they break up don't be anything more.|`|huHOpRLLaa	if he likes you then why stop talking to him<br>  yall could have a possible future relationship/<br>  and if his gf gets mad tell her its not your fault he likes you.|`|kRh3slhdaa	Just because he has a girlfriend doesn't mean that you have to stop talking to him, as long as you stay friends and don't get in between their relationship, I don't see anything wrong with it. I would suggest just staying friends with him for now, the last thing you want to do is cause drama for yourself because the gf thinks there's something going on between you and her man. I know it's hard, but patience is a virtue, and who knows, maybe you'll just be best friends, or maybe they'll split and he'll end up with you.|`|fA42bQHraa	If you don't know her and she's not your girlfriend/sister/cousin, then it's between the two of them.<br>  <br>  You're not "stealing" him because he's not an object, he is a person that has responsibility for his own choices.<br>  <br>  The main thing for you to worry about is him seeing you while he is still with her. Make sure he knows he has to break up with her before you'll get romantic with him.<br>  <br>  Most people have several boyfriends and girlfriends before they meet the right person. It's not stealing to be interested in someone and it's only wrong if there is lying involved.|`|OJIZQYDcaa	What a nice girl. She doesn't want to steal someone else's man.<br>  <br>  If the dude was a cheater he wouldn't have said he has a girlfriend.<br>  <br>  If she was Angelina Jolie she wouldn't give a crap if she was stealing someone's man.<br>  <br>  If I was the other girl I'd have steam coming out of my ears if I ever found out my man was talking to another girl.|`|AA11356977	Take him if ya want but a guy ttht weak is a turn off to me. You want a cheater??? Think hard because karma will get you. How would you feel if it was your boyfriend. Have respect for other woman even if their boyfriends dont. It makes you a better person and helps build your self exteem. Doing bad things knock it down.|`|IHwMbLX5aa	Talk to him, if he flirts with you or hits on you just tell him you are not comfortable to go there because he has a gf... if he didnt have a gf you would... that way the decision is his.|`|OWjbg4GYaa	Are you Angelina Jolie|`|VSXUa9lraa	Just don't make any moves as to where he feels like you're crossing the line.<br>  Be friends for now.|`|AA12244965	Well, let's see. He's in a relationship but seeking something outside of it, so that's already poor boyfriend quality within him. You're single, so you're not technically doing anything wrong, but he is. However, you're contributing to it and it will probably either destroy his current relationship, or he'll cheat on her with you. So... seriously, use your best judgment. There are plenty of single guys out there that you'll have "chemistry" with.

sCCjAKllaa	You would probably be better just not involving yourself in this. Maybe if you told her initially how you felt, there would be a chance; now it just seems like it was too long, and the timing would not be good for you to tell her how you feel. It might even frustrate her and make things confusing for her.<br>  <br>  However, you never know unless you try. Perhaps you should tell her. At least it's better to see where you stand then to not try at all.
e80aa9c0a25afc548ff200fc3f1000dfaa	You never say these things face to face.   Romantic conversations never succeed by making statements face to face.  It needs to be natural. So when you guys are doing some activities together, slowly start touching her.  Like if you guys are jogging or biking or just walking near a beach or some appropriate activity , then slowly touch her hand (palms).  or just hold hands and see how she reacts.  NEVER NEVER look at the place your touching when you do it.  Just be very casual, and give a short glaze into her eyes.  Do that for a bit, and then when you guys sit and chat, just touch her legs, (not thighs) as part of conversation and hands  and then lean towards her, nudge her, give a funny conversational hug (shoulder to shoulder).  Watch her eyes carefully yet dont' stare.  See her reaction.  If she approves, then next time when you guys are alone sitting somewhere in a beach or some scenic place, just touch her hair casually , if on a ouch put your hands slowly behind her shoulders and caress her hair.  If you got that far, she likes you. <br>  <br>  NEVER JUMP AHEAD.  Touchign should be palms, hand, legs, shoulders, hair, thighs, neck etc.,   <br>  <br>  If she doesn't approve or withdraws a bit in any state, then go back one step and repeat until she approves (non verbally). <br>  <br>  Romance has to develop by touch and feelings not by statements.|`|9QYAW437aa	Start flirting with her, <br>  then if she flirts back...<br>  then there's a possibility of her liking you.<br>  just strike up casual conversation<br>  <br>  If you want to tell her,<br>  just straight out say it.<br>  "Hey [insert.name.here], I like you..."<br>  Add whatever you want after that. <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  GOOD LUCK(:
AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|xwNgEhKCaa	yes yes|`|MxPBjQAEaa	MARY HE SO LOVES YOU NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT <br>  <br>  GIRL YOU NEED TO GO FOR IT :D

He doesn't seem to have a problem and even if he doesn't like that he is doing it for you that should be more than enough.<br>  Also your just being self councious about this something will always be too small, large, uneven or disformed. You can consider getting it fixed but honestly just sit him down and ask him. I know it will be embarrasing but his answer and im sure it will make you feel much better because if he knows it bothers you this much he will be 100% honest.

If it has come as a complete surprise and you were really into her, it will wreck your head whatever you do. However, in the long run, it is always better to retain a bit of dignity and try and behave like an adult. Face up to her and try and sort it out with a clear head (don't go and get pis*ed beforehand for example). Treat her like an adult and don't get upset. All of that is impossible of course but you will feel much better in years to come if you gave it your best shot.|`|bvwYVGJOaa	the only way you can do this is to end it and be happy because it's immoral and wrong including with your best friend. <br>  <br>  But as times go by, you will be able to forgive both of them but its down to you if you wanna continue being friends with your best friend and also wanting your g/f.<br>  <br>  if i were you i wouldn't be talking to them and have my closure forever. in good terms.|`|8K3IucU3aa	that isn't your best friend. a friend wouldn't do something like that to you. why date someone who is obviously lying to you and why befriend someone who can't keep their hands to themselves. you can tell her that you know, all she's going to do is get mad and deny it or say you shouldn't have been looking but either way she's wrong. find someone who isn't childish. find someone faithful.|`|1hpctY4saa	I wouldn't come out and just say it.

Deal with it, but don't let her know. You don't want to 'pretend' you don't know, you want to know without giving her any suspicion that you're onto her. Understand?<br>  <br>  So now you're ready, everything remains the same as it used to be, don't let her detect any change, you know? You want to keep this going and study what a girlfriend that is cheating on you is like, so you will be an expert in the future. <br>  <br>  Keep doing the bf/gf thing, but you're really only going to enjoy the sex anymore because you're starting to dislike her more and more every day, which if you split up right away you'd probably miss her and be sad that she cheated. From now on, you're single, flirt with girls and everything. When they ask about your g/f just tell them that you 'have one', but you caught her cheating on you and she doesn't know you know, so you're kind of riding it out instead of making a big scene and stuff. Tell them that this guy on the internet had this idea to stay with her so that you'll grow apart while you're still together instead of breaking apart and wishing you were still together..  or something, bare with me.<br>  <br>  After about a month, tell her that you found out a month ago, cite the specific evidence, she'll probably deny it. Give her a chance to state her case, then tell her that your buddy told you about it, so she'll be pissed at him! Then make your verdict and be out! They'll both learn her lesson better this way, and you will have made out 100x better than if you had blown up and everything that people normally do! TRUST ME! Please email me bro, let me know how good it works. <br>  <br>  Seriously, trust me, I'm 3rd party, my emotions aren't in this, I'm thinking clear. I think you understand me, because you haven't already confronted her...<br>  <br>  Keep us posted!<br>  <br>  BEST, MORE REALISTIC, ALTERNATIVE:  Break up with her on your own terms, just say that you've had a change of heart and that it's not going to work out, but that you've enjoyed everything. Maybe say, "It's not you, it's me". HAHA, don't give her much more explanation than that, that'll throw her for a loop. Then start blowing off your buddy, tell him that he's just a douche and you wanna chill with him anymore. I still like the first thing though.|`|lFk4JAlcaa	Firstly, you have to make sure you are 99.5% positive that she is cheating on you. Reading her text isn't good? Talk to your best bud about it ... but one way or the other you have to find the truth to your situation. Otherwise you are also lying to her face, by loving her one way but not trusting her the other way. Do you truly love her? Try to get this organize with her, make sure she isn't using you or anything. The best way is to tell her by not telling her that you have read her text, for example, say that heard from a friend that you have been going out with your best bud. The two possible way to end the situation is that you brake up or keep the relationship. Good Luck :D|`|Asrxi2ZQaa	My advice to you is to come clean and tell her you read the texts and know that shes cheating on you with your best friend. Let your best friend know that you know as well. End your relationship with her, you dont want a cheater and end your relationship with your best friend. Friends dont go behind friends backs and date their best friends girlfriend. Its a fact!!!|`|qQP1lhZ8aa	Tell her you know what is going on.  Ask her about it, what her feelings are towards you and your friends.  Be cool about it and pretend like you care.  Then break it off and go beat the sh** out of your friend.  Make him so ugly that she won't want him.  She will ask for you back and that's when you say "%$#@ NO, B%$#@!!"|`|0yaQQSwoaa	uh, don't tell her because it makes you look a bit bad, trust wise but yeah, you should end it and sooner or later you can just knock you friend out. I mean all men know the rule dude Bros before hoes and of course all girls know the rules too Chicks before Diks. you getting this?|`|906eAhBTaa	Shes not worth your time!!<br>  confront her see if she admits to it!<br>  don't tell her you read the text see if she keeps denying it!<br>  If she does, then dump her she doesn't really care about you!|`|dSTQnHPraa	Kick her to the curb, and beat the **** out of your best friend|`|JJAYUSBnaa	break up with her don't stress yourself with this and tell her why and tell your friend about this too|`|D3LqgeoBaa	take some photos - then post them everywhere|`|vPzA4eqzaa	Leave the cheating cow...you deserve better!|`|4pANb6Epaa	talk to her about it dummy<br>  dont let it go answered|`|P8Z9rZNSaa	tell her then break up with her|`|KrfVPJZSaa	tell her shess a punk hater and then run away|`|zrdCCq4zaa	punch her in the head...nah jk confront ur bestfriend and ask him...|`|Hcc9fxqJaa	No wait dont tell her yet<br>  <br>  wait untill she is going "shopping with her mates" and follow her and then catch her in the act|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Why would you want to stay in a relationship with a cheater?  And why would you want a friend who will go behind your back like that?|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	Its time for a change, a cheat is a cheat and a leopard can not change it's spots, dump her and move on, there are loads of really nice girls out there and why your at it a new best mate would be a wise decision.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	end you're relationship<br>  when she asks why and acts dumbfounded<br>  tell her about the texts you saw<br>  she maytry to turn it around on you for going through her stuff<br>  but what she's doing is far worse<br>  good luck|`|3qLIRorjaa	She's still your girlfriend?|`|zIoWCX7vaa	cheat on her with me|`|DXLfbKUBaa	You cant pretend not to know as it will eat away at your self esteem, let her know, you don't need to say you looked in her phone, say that you have heard the rummer through the grapevine and that you have a right to know the truth. Whatever the out come remember that once the trust has gone your relationship will never be the same with her or your friend|`|u9PxChF2aa	Tell her in the calmest way that you know and how. Ask her why didn't you tell me. Then end the relationship and never forget there are way too many fish in the sea to waste your time on and you can always find another girlfriend.|`|hFnkvO9taa	Tell this b*tch to take a long walk of a short plank , If she's cheating with one of your so called mates , how long will it take her to go through all of them , It's better to move on the next one could be the right one .|`|xreWOKBYaa	Dump her cheating ***, you deserve better. Beat up your "friend", cause trust me - he isnt your friend if he would do this to you.|`|EZdRYJXraa	It's your own choose, but I personally would never forgive and forget, cheating with my best friend is the worst thing he can do to me.|`|zH7VuQhtaa	Okay yes you must confront her about this immediately! You might want to keep to yourself that you looked through her phone though. :)|`|O8XjkCjxaa	I'm so sorry to hear that, that's shady of her. Leave her, she's not worth it and you can find someone much better... like me ;)|`|PXimiZCdaa	dump her, but dont tell her, just make her wonder. dump your friend too
fpGroPpzaa	He thinks of you as a friend right now. Try flirting with him and see how that goes, he may start thinking of you as something more.
BZVlzAywaa	He was checking out your profile, obviously. Guys only do that when they like a girl; they stalk her (we're talking low-key stalking here). They want to know your interests and who you talk to and what you say to the people you talk to, mainly to see if you're really their type. It's a bit creepy and flattering at the same time. He likes you. Or he just wants to get to know you better. Either way, its a good thing :D
znJ3UGyzaa	Why don't you tag him in the photos of you two?|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	I think you need to tag him in the pictures you have on your page of the two of you.  Frankly I'm shocked that you haven't already.  Some people don't care about technicalities like their picture, or current updated status.  He probably just signs on to talk to people and doesn't worry so much about making sure his profile is correct (unless other parts are very detailed in which cases its fishy).  First, tag him in some photos of the two of you and see what happens.  If nothing, you're worrying over nothing.  If you still feel this way though, talk to him about it.  He probably figures that he talks to you often enough that there's no need for facebook interaction.|`|YPNdv0pSaa	Yeah honestly...it's not that big of a deal. Is he still figuring out how everything works? Maybe he doesn't know how to upload pics. or doesn't have any good pics. And why does he need to talk to you on Facebook when you're his girlfriend and he can talk to you face to face?<br>  <br>  Just my thoughts lol|`|AUHsZvavaa	Yes, if he's committed to you then just let it go.|`|wuZXqYPGaa	i dont think its supersensitive and insecure at ALL. and we both know that on facebook, you can untag yourself. yes its understandable that his ex-wife is part of his past, however you are a part of him now and he should recognize that and be proud to show that he is with you now. seems to me like you should give him a talkin-to. and tell him how u feel bout it all, i know it sounds pretty lame to be talkin bout f-book but whutever.. its bout you guys and if its buggin u in ur relationship you shouldnt b afriad to say it..

FkunZ9q4aa	Common Law marriage means you have lived together for 7 years and it's only in some states.  I think you need to do more research before you make this decision.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	He won't get a greencard that way.<br>  <br>  Obtaining a Green Card through marriage can be complicated. Each year over 450,000 thousand United States citizens marry foreign-born individuals and petition for them to obtain permanent residency status, or a Green Card, in the United States. Spouses of U.S. citizens are considered "immediate relatives" under immigration laws; therefore they are excluded from all numerical quota limitations. This means that there are an unlimited number of Green Cards available to foreign nationals who marry U.S. citizens. However, the process of completing and submitting a request for a Green Card through marriage can be both costly and confusing.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Sorry, but you must do a 'legal marriage' to get your boyfriend a green card.  Any 'common law' marriage must be between citizens of the US only, and you must 'live together as man and wife, and present yourself to the 'world' as man and wife at all times' to be declared a 'common law' marriage.|`|vXa7IeDiaa	they can only find out if you tell them or someone else does..also if they claim you on their taxes..it will show up that you are married and they can't claim you..also it will take about 2yrs for your bf to get a green card. Please re think this situation.I had a friend that did this..over a yr ago..now she is still married to the guy but she left him in guatemala and she lives in the u.s.She is really lagging on getting a divorce and she has a bf in the u.s...Rethink your situation..good luck|`|jlZZbdIjaa	A green card....ooh is he French? Anyways i think that's kind of stupid. Sorry but it is....i mean no matter where he's from it's still kind of wrong and i can tell you right here right now that your relationship will never last.|`|Dj5f1SRfaa	There should be no way your parents can find out about it except by accident, if say a public servant mentioned it because they saw it on file- make sure you dont change your name|`|P7bNXrlOaa	you're an adult. they don't have to know if you don't want them to.|`|IhPesNcWaa	i think the question you should be asking yourself, is why does he need a green card so quickly, cant he get one himself?<br>  <br>  it sounds like youre doing this for the wrong reasons, he wants a greencard, not you. sorry hun but its true, think about it<br>  <br>  you should be honest with your parents, they do things for a reason, and they'll always love you, you need to include them in something as important as this.<br>  <br>  they'll be more upset at the fact you didnt talk to them about it x|`|HKkbqlIuaa	Why don't you just file for a marriage license and get married at the court house? It's easier and faster. Anyone that you don't want to know, won't know. (unless they call the city and specifically ask, which I doubt)|`|tkuTno5gaa	i don't think they can find out, paper marriages are pretty quick... have you ever considered that he just might be using you to be civilized?  Lol jk jk jk jk! nahhh I doubt that lol... i think it will be easy for you! <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|908b0790cd51aa2d22433510f21b1e39aa	Why not just move to the country he's from.  That way your parent's won't be mad at you for getting married, and he won't get deported.|`|KSdxlnFfaa	dont do this.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	I think you are confused.  "Common law marriage" is a possibility in certain states, where if a couple lives together for a certain period of time (years) and call each other husband and wife, the law treats them as married, even without the paperwork.  That would take time, and would take being in a state that recognizes it, so that can't be what you mean.  And if you mean "a paper marriage", as in, you technically get married but you don't actually intend to live together and act like a married couple, then that is fraud, and there are people who check up on that.  <br>  <br>  You may just mean a civil wedding, in front of a justice of the peace, but you actually intend to live as a married couple?  First you have to figure out what you really mean before we can answer any of your other questions.|`|XJSOToRGaa	First of all, examine common law marriage laws in your state - many states do not recognize common law marriages (they may recognize them if they were established in other states, but not necessarily if you're trying to establish one within your state).<br>  <br>  Your plan is a poor one because a 'common law' marriage is not something that can be done quickly - it requires time.  A better suggestion would be to apply for a marriage license and let a justice of the peace marry you.<br>  <br>  However I echo a previous responder: getting married for a green card is a bad, BAD idea.<br>  <br>  And can your parents find out?  Depends on how suspicious and determined they are...generally speaking however, stuff like this always comes out in the end - and you'll be the one left to answer for it.|`|23xC6I2Gaa	I'm not going to go into any details about the situation or about the decision you are making... but just be sure that you know what you are doing!<br>  <br>  But to answer your question... no, your parents don't HAVE to find out if you are already independent. If your parents claim you on their taxes, pay for your health insurance, etc...then they will need to know because all of that changes once you become married. If you are completely independed - support yourself totally - then no, your parents won't need to know...the courts aren't going to tell your parents.<br>  <br>  And it's not called a Common Law Marriage - Common Law is something different... what you are doing (in a court house) is equivalent to any other form of marriage, just without the ceremony or religious aspect...|`|YthSOifBaa	Please don't.  You are young and the older you get the more fun you would want to have (being single).  Trust me I know.  How long have you been with this guy?  What if he marries you then when he gets his green card he ***** around on you?  Now you have to get a divorce and that is a process u will not want to go through.  Do you even know how to get a divorce?  Take your time.  If he is in a hurry tell him to go offer some one some money to marry him.  Believe me when I say parents know best.  May sound corny but trust, you are going to say the same thing once you find out who he really is|`|Z771jOf8aa	Wow, this is really hard. First, you have to make sure you are the one that check the mails. Second, you have to lie to your parents in many occasion. There will be time for greencard interview. There will be time for your marriage paper work. If you manage to make up a perfect lie,then it will be ok. MAKE SURE your bf didn use you to get his Greencard please, please.|`|RDOrTix5aa	ew y would u get married and try to hide it from ur parents because then if u ever actually wanna get married to this guy in a church or have a big celebration or w.e....there going to see on your records that u've alreay been married and your parents are going to find out! duhh(i) and dont do this because if u ever break up after he uses<<(oops didnt want tht to slip out:O)..u for this...then u guys r gunna have to go threw a divorce and theres no way in hell tht ur parents arent ever going to find out about this its impossible!|`|Ob9PRJevaa	OMG. DO NOT DO IT.  If you never listen to anyone else in your life, at least listen to all these people who are telling you know. <br>  NOT saying that this is you, but I have a friend who did that same thing at 18 years old. She is 21 now, with a one year old and a two year old, and he TOOK off. He seemed like the greatest guy, too. <br>  I'mm 22 and i KNOW myself that you are too young.  GROW UP AND LIVE A LITTLE FIRST!!!|`|mjxvYNruaa	please! dont do it!!! you will look back on it and regret not letting your mon and dad be involved in your wedding. and if they find out they will be crushed and there will probably be nothing you can do to make it up to them.

You are responsible for what you do, therefore, you won't need your parents permission. I would still think about this. Also, it depends what state your in.|`|pTBR5PIkaa	dont do this, at least talk to your parents about it, it wont be that hard, if you love him, you parents will understand why you are marring.|`|L3TKLQQ6aa	Marriage records are public in many (if not all) states but your parents would have to go to your state's public records website and specifically put in your name to see if a marriage license had been issued to you.|`|zTBscfuraa	umm ya you can get one ur parents finding out they mite if ur not carefull and thats really sweet hopefully that not ur only reson 4 getting married|`|yktlEbZeaa	if you live in your parents house or if you give your parents information den dey will find out easily. but why do you want to marry omeone just so he can get a green card.|`|DlGV1xv9aa	i think you have to live together for 7 years or something to do a common law marriage|`|DXZK6eMNaa	Marriage is a public document, there's no way to keep it from them.|`|EKoRHgdgaa	You do know that for him to get his green card that you have to actually live together...how are you going to do that and not have your parents find out?  Do you actually want to stay married to this guy for the rest of your life?  Immigration will dig into the situation and if they see that it was just a marriage of convenience then they will not give him a green card!  You have to be married for at least 2 years to file for a green card and then you have to prove that it is an actual marriage...not just one for a green card!  You could get into some serious trouble, so make sure you really take this into consideration!  Do not do this for the wrong reasons...and yes, getting married just for a green card is a bad decision!<br>  <br>  To answer your question, you can get married at the court house and not have anyone know, just make sure you have your marriage license delivered somewhere where your parents will not accidentally open it.  :o)|`|JoU7WTadaa	Common Law is not a "paper marraige" whatever that is. Common Law isn't a real marraige anymore...it used to be. <br>  But I think what you're talkin about is goin up to the Justice of the Peace at the court house with like 5 people & gettin hitched.<br>  <br>  If you're 18, and you don't live with them, your parents don't have to know. But if you live in their house & they claim you on their income tax, I think that could lead to breaking the law if they don't know you're married. So check into that.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how easy it will be to hide it, though. As long as you keep it quiet, don't wear rings & don't put it in the papers or on Myspace or something, they shouldn't find out.<br>  <br>  Also, I hope he's not just using you to get the green card...That's what it sounds like to me. So just be careful babe.|`|rRvoOPvzaa	A common law marriage means that you have lived together for 1 plus years. You can't do one quickly.|`|fbPWn3q7aa	There is no reason for your parents to find out but be careful. If you enter a marriage for this reason, you WILL end up getting divorced.|`|HqhuW74Jaa	Not if you're 18. If you were under-aged, you would need their permission, but if you're 18, there's no way of them finding out unless you tell them.|`|3LjsqLacaa	you may love him but dont do it i dont care if hes not a citizen dont do it you still are young and you dont want to get marrired at 18|`|2TkGJFAkaa	If he's the one telling you not to tell your parents, there might be a chance that he might just be using you to get his greencard. Think about it.....|`|OYz4f8Ywaa	yeah youre an adult but they're your parents . they deserve to know.|`|cm8G7AiCaa	if i were u i wouldnt........just tell ur parents they wont mind?? would they<br>  and just DONT DO IT! <br>  bad idea they will find out!|`|SnL5dfN0aa	IF you werent 18 they would have to contact your parets. but since you are, the only way they would find out is if some one that knows slipps up and tell them. good luck|`|9UQlhzitaa	alright let me answer your question<br>  <br>  a common law marriage as far as i understand it to be is a marriage grant to 2 people after they have lived together for 7 yrs or more.<br>  <br>  So even if you do qualify,yes your parents and anyone else who knows your name can look you up in public records or search your name.<br>  <br>  How fast can they type?<br>  <br>  personal opinion here dear but marrying for anything less than true love is a very bad move;You 2 will have to be together as a married couple for at least 7 yrs.and they will follow up to see if you 2 are still together or not.If you 2 are not together I have heard of them pressing fraud charges and the like for it<br>  <br>  the choice is yours and you will be the one to live with it and should you have children one day what will you tell them about this part of your life
YpJuHsOOaa	Wow, you seem like a nice guy putting up with that girl's shizoo! ;) i think you should have a good talk with your girl, let her know that you want<br>  your relationship to be about TRUST, that way she won't believe rumors you know? And that way she realizes your not in it for sex.<br>  Maybe that girl is jealous of your girl for having you or something? gosh that is soo messed up of her telling your gf that.  Get your girl to kick her butt or something lol :)|`|P6bObowEaa	I personally think that you should first try talking to her but then if she persists then just have your girlfriend beet her a**! And if that's not an option then you can tell the police that she's harassing you (which she kinda is) and file a restraining order on her.|`|KpO4UtElaa	just keep reassuring your girlfriend that these things are not true and prove it by your actions that they are not true. then the rude girl will just look like a lying fool. i don't think getting up in this girl's face or insulting her back is going to help because it may just egg her on more.. she might like to get a rise out of you. so just keep your cool. your gf will see who's right in time if she doesn't already know.|`|y7MsBXdmaa	Wow tough...<br>  <br>  Maybe you should ask your GF to step up & make this chick shut up.<br>  If a girl was trying to tell me her opinion of my boyfriend I would definitely jump to his defense & tell this particular female to back off because she knows nothing about him or our relationship.<br>  <br>  In a weird way, I think this girl may actually be jealous & might like you.|`|wuZXqYPGaa	i vote you talk to YOUR girl.. tell her whut u tellin now..<br>  she will probably understand, and shes pretty much the messenger between you and that chick you hate, so most likely your girlfriend will tell the other chick to BACK OFF<br>   :D|`|BtxQogSzaa	Tell your girlfriend to ignore her and tell her you would never leave her etc... then totally ignore the girl, if she sees shes getting to you she'll carry on. <br>  quick and smart answers are whats needed. if she gets answers thrown at her she'll be speechless.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA11982696	DO NOT HIT HER!! Just insult her and tell her "b**** mind your own f***** business"|`|QHvuD8SJaa	tell that to your girlfriend|`|PxLhryHyaa	that girl is retarded. don't listen to her! i understand that you're a fighter and such but if she's telling stuff to your gf...you're gf should be ignoring her as well lol i once had a girl that spread rumors about me to make my life miserable and would tell my bf stuff but i would ignore her along with my bf and friends....so eventually she felt stupid because no one was giving in to her stupidities lol<br>  <br>  if you feel like you need to do something then i guess say something? i dunno...i'm not much of a fighter though lol|`|DSHi6xmUaa	Tell her that you really love your girlfriend and that you would kindly like her to **** off. If that doesn't work, talk to your girlfriend about it.|`|goMgkYRTaa	wow - I'm the same way with the whole crossing my path thing. I'm a nice person until you cross me. But I've been through this, except with a boyfriend. Just tell her what's hers, b*tch her out, and tell her to back off..|`|GR4O3Gdgaa	well first tell her to back off and leave your gf alone and to stop tellin her lies cuz its not true. and if she dont then just tell her its really not cool and that she wont have any frineds if she keeps it up cuz noone likes an annoyin ***** like her. so yeah|`|MY7k5rRlaa	You just need to tell her to back off. <br>  If not well, you could talk to a teacher.|`|fQVM8OHmaa	It sounds like she likes you and is trying to make you two break up.  Tell her firmly to stop.|`|tLOUuf3Maa	go up to her and totally b*tch her out :)|`|g0j5Vstgaa	Ask her if vast knowledge and life experience (how old is she?) and all her perfect relationships leads her to her conclusions or is she secretly in love with you and wants to break you & the love of your life up?  I would say it, pretty much like that.  Let her & everyone around including your girlfriend hear that you are a one woman kind of guy. <br>  <br>  Your girl knows better & nothing this girl or anyone else says is going to stop her if she decides to have sex with you.  If you're still in high school, I wouldn't recommend it of course.  <br>  <br>  It's just a bunch of words with no meaning and no real basis.  You could tell her if that's the way she thinks she can get to you it's not, and leave it at that. Less words.   Look, don't sweat the small stuff, life's too short.  Enjoy your relationship, be happy, be yourself.|`|AA12392755	Sorry, you are not going to get my permission to hit her, even though you say all the things that let everyone know you want to do so.  Man up and just ignore her.  What difference does it make to you what she says anyway as long as it isn't true?  Ignore her and she will stop, or you can keep on letting her push your buttons and making yourself miserable for her amusement.|`|rJrWQWKJaa	tell your girlfriend how much this is bothering you, and that none of it is true. at least that way your girlfriend will know she's lying and won't believe the stuff she's saying<br>  <br>  other than that there's not really much you can do, except try and get the both of you to calm down and have a civil conversation<br>  this girl seems really immature, but eventually she will back off<br>  <br>  good luck(L).|`|J6WSMpTlaa	Go up to her and straight up ask her<br>  why she is being a little *****<br>  and tell her to stay out of u and yr girlfriend's lives!<br>  and tell ur girlfriend that u love her and won't<br>  trade her for the world.<br>  tell her how u really fell of her and tell yr girlfriend to <br>  tell that girl to leave u alone!<br>  Good luck!|`|iNvGnl0Xaa	Accidentally hit her.|`|dxeOlRBfaa	insult her and tell her to keep the f out of ur business! u need to let her know she is messing with the wrong person!|`|aNIiGpzeaa	she sounds soooo jealous. get your gf to kisk some @$$
HKkbqlIuaa	Unfortunately, words probably aren't going to convince him of this, but it's always good to let him know. You just need to keep reminding him and prove it with your actions. I would sit down with him and have a talk. Explain to him how you feel and that you will always be there. Even if he is not convinced, tell him you know it's just words, but that you ask him to believe in you and let you show him with your actions. I am sure he will take you seriously. Well, good luck with everything! Hope I helped.|`|O7Gkyk0zaa	Reassure him. communicate. Communication is the key. If you do love him back them talk to him saying you do.

Talk to her about it.|`|qutrUpFxaa	maybe she just doesnt know how to do it?<br>  send her an invite.<br>  you can just put in a relationship with(hername) and then it'll send her something to accept or deny.
yFh9G4FIaa	well hun let het know wht u think that u think shes spending alot of time with herr girl frends an not enough u an her time cause i mean it doesnt matter how long u 2 have been together she has to put time into the relatiionshp but u should let her know because she doesnt just assume ur not happy with that
jdah4ZA2aa	I read all of it ... but I'm still not sure I can offer a great answer. <br>  <br>  I think sometimes the one we love the most can't give us what we need.  Fulfilling relationships take work on behalf of both parties.  You've got to think about what you want out of life as far as relationships go, and what you're willing to sacrifice for him.  Think about this part rationally.  We as humans are capable of falling in love more than once, though it may be different each time. <br>  <br>  Sometimes a great physical chemistry can lead to very intense feelings, but doesn't necessarily lead to committment to working at a relationship.  If you find that you're carrying on doing the work one-sided, you might be better to cut your losses and move on.  But if he is trying and you are trying, and you both feel like you want to put forth the effort, keep at it.|`|uJLmbINyaa	i haven't read your story but yes, trust it!!!!!!|`|umqWDs5Aaa	ALWAYS TRUST INSTINCT!|`|AA11333480	He must make his choice and then stick with it.  Using his child as a reason for not being with you is feeble and untrue...many men are living away from the child and they see them regularly, having good relationships with them.  <br>  That is an excuse.  Based only on that excuse I would say he's still playing games, and hasn't grown up a single bit.<br>  But, if it's genuine, then he has to choose.  If he chooses you then fine he can sort it out with the child, but if he chooses to stay there then you must accept that.

And because of the fact that humanity isn't really taking care of our world like we are sopposed to. Many things like that are the reasons why people think that the world is going to end. <br>  <br>  But hey! Don't worry! if this really does happen its bound to happen in a lot more years than they say so :)|`|ycNxVrUfaa	It's supposed to end 12/21/12 (or 12/12/12, not sure). That was the final date on the Mayan calendar and other well known prophets have predicted it. Some point to the bible, especially Revelations, and say there is proof. But if they really knew the bible, they'd realize that there's also a scripture that says NO ONE knows when the end will be here. Don't ask me to quote that scripture, I just remember my Sunday School teacher reading it to me.|`|TBDOSpwraa	i wouldn't believe everything you're hearing about the end of the world.<br>  god has a specific plan on when the world is going to end, no one else can fully predict that stuff.<br>  :)|`|FQNfXgvFaa	scientist have been saying about 2012 because thats when the aztecs calender stops i think its all lies but you never know..|`|2378db63a64d3b0b43810373b0a58b65aa	ru serious? the world is not going to end atleast not in this lifetime|`|AA10875113	Run to the hills, run for your life. 2012 aaaah!|`|IazSysIhaa	u actually believe that stuff???

It's called a break up, because it's broken"<br>       -Somewhat sad, but it really helped speak for me when I couldn't describe my feelings after a breakup.<br>  <br>  2) Champagne's for Celebrating, I'll Have A Martini - by Mayday Parade<br>       -Part of lyrics: "So why'd you have to go? Is there something I could say to make you turn around? Cause nights like these I wish I'd said don't go. Is there anybody there? Can anybody help to get me out of here? Cause you're walking down a road that I can't go."<br>       -This song is about a broken relationship between one who wants to let go and one who does not.<br>  <br>  3) If You Wanted a Song Written About You, All You Had to do was Ask -by Mayday Parade<br>       -Part of lyrics: "And I hope this makes you happy now, that the flame we had is burning out. And I hope you like your pictures facing down, and even broken hearts may have their doubts."<br>       -I LOVE this song. It's really good if you're in that angry stage of a breakup. It definitely helped me get through one.<br>  <br>  4) Jersey -by Mayday Parade<br>       -Part of lyrics: "I'll have you know I'm scared to death that everything that you had said to me was just a lie until you left. Now I'm hoping just a little bit stronger, hold me up just a little bit longer. I'll be fine, I swear..."<br>       -Speaks for itself; talks about the hurt of a heartache and describes a heart that still hopes for a chance to get back together with the person.<br>  <br>  5) Something I Said -by Safetysuit<br>       -Part of lyrics: "I’m so confused, I must be losing it, this can’t be right. I never knew that you could choose to love someone then change your mind. So I just wonder why, and was it something I said?"<br>       -Such a beautiful song if you listen all the way through it. It definitely speaks for my own feelings towards a certain someone.<br>  <br>  6) Down -by Safetysuit<br>       -Part of lyrics: "Is there something inside me that I don’t see? Is there something wrong here with the way I love? Down, you can’t hold me down. Cause when no one is around I won't be standing here, just waiting for you to come back home again. Down, you can’t hold me down because I finally understand that what you did is not so bad, in fact, it’s better for me."<br>       -Love this song as well; it's a strong song and it shows. It describes a person finally realizing the fate of the situation and is accepting it with pride.<br>  <br>  7) The Moment -by Safetysuit<br>       -Part of lyrics: "And I don't understand what happened between you and me but you will probably end up with someone half as good as me so..."<br>       -Another strong song that the artist sings about being confident and strong throughout the unfortunate situation he's in.<br>  <br>  8) Step Right Up -by The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus<br>       -Part of lyrics: "There is no time to waste, well if "I love you" can't hesitate: step right up, shoot an arrow at the target- my heart is an easy thing for you to hit. Don't worry, if you miss I'll let you shoot again. My heart is an easy thing for you to win."<br>       -More of a love song, but it gives hope- if that's what you're looking for(:<br>  <br>  9) The World Has its Shine (But I'd Drop it on a Dime) -by Cobra Starship<br>       -Part of lyrics: "I'm not one for love songs. The way I'm living makes you feel like giving up, but you don't. And I want everything for you but disappointment."<br>       -Cute, pop teenage love song about sacrificing things, even the world, for those you love.<br>  <br>  10) Thinking of You -by Katy Perry<br>       -Part of lyrics: "You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter, like a hard candy with a surprise center. How do I get better once I've had the best? You said there's tons of fish in the water so the waters I will test."<br>       -BEST song by Katy Perry in my opinion. Has an upbeat tune that can't help but make you happy even though you just broke up. I don't know, it's just one of those songs for me that, even though it's mainstream, I just can really connect to.<br>  <br>  11) Never Gonna Happen -by Lily Allen<br>       -Part of lyrics: "I don't wanna hurt you 'cause I don't think it's a virtue, but you and I have come to our end. Believe me when I tell you that I never want to see you again."<br>       -Quirky song with odd music but gets straight to the point in the subject matter of being over your ex, even if you're not.<br>  <br>  12) Kiss Me Thru the Phone -by Soulja Boy<br>       -Part of lyrics: "Baby, I been thinking lately so much about you. Everything about you, I like it, I love it. Kissing you in public, thinking nothing of it, roses by the dozen, talking on the phone..."<br>       -R&B song with a hint of rap, it's more of a song to a girl from a boy. But who says that girls don't need a constant reminder that guys actually do fall for them?<br>  <br>  13) If I Only Had the Heart -by The Maine<br>       -Part of lyrics: "But it's just fine, no you can't save me, it's no fault but mine, p|`|dxeOlRBfaa	well it would depend on whether she broke up with him for doing something bad or if it was mostly a mutual thing.

Jeff Buckley The Last Goodbye<br>  My brother and I love this song. Buckley's voice was beautiful (he died in 1997) and the song's orchestral sound really captures the "I can't believe it's over" sentiment.<br>  Favorite lyric: "This is our last embrace/Must I dream and always see your face/Why can't we overcome this wall/Well, maybe it's just because I didn't know you at all"<br>  <br>  4. The Cure Pictures of You<br>  Okay, so this is pretty obvious, but how could I leave it out? Robert Smith is the break-up king.<br>  Favorite lyric: "If only I'd thought of the right words/I could have held on to your heart/If only I'd thought of the right words/I wouldn't be breaking apart/All my pictures of you"<br>  <br>  3. Love Spit Love Am I Wrong<br>  I used to play this song in my free spots when I was a DJ at KTRM. One version of this song is featured on the Angus soundtrack, with my friend Julie's high school marching band accompanying. <br>  Favorite lyric: "There's too much/that I keep to myself/and I turn my back on my faith/it's like glass/when we break/I wish no one in my place"<br>  <br>  2. Pearl Jam Black<br>  Oh, Eddie, how many tears have I shed listening to your songs??<br>  Favorite lyric: "I know someday you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a star/In somebody else's sky, but why/Why, why can't it be, why can't it be mine"<br>  <br>  1. The Psychedelic Furs Ghost in You<br>  I have the Counting Crows cover on CD--until a month ago, I thought the song was theirs. This site shows that I really should have known more about the song, and the band (given my fascination with Pretty in Pink and the aforementioned Love Spit Love). <br>  Favorite lyric: "A man in my shoes runs a light/All the papers lie tonight/but falling over you/is the news of the day"|`|6JeBVUwPaa	so what -PINK<br>  over it- katherine mcfee<br>  single 06 - natasha benefild<br>  forever & always- taylor swift<br>  picture to burn- taylor swift<br>  best days of your life- kellie pickler<br>  <br>  please answer mine??<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219150350AALjk7p">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|IazSysIhaa	White Horse by Taylor Swift<br>  Better In Time by Leona Lewis<br>  Should've Said No by Taylor Swift<br>  Forever and Always by Taylor Swift<br>  What Hurts The Most by Rascal Flatts<br>  Picture To Burn by Taylor Swift<br>  Goodbye by Miley Cyrus<br>  Hate by Plain White T's|`|m8GpkmVuaa	secondhand serenade!!<br>  ludo -goodwillhunting by myself<br>  3OH!3 there not really love songs but they keep your mind busy and theyre funny|`|KpFLNr9oaa	you dont want to listen to love songs after breaking up with someone... that just makes you more depressed....|`|sX49htKsaa	"i hate this part right here" pussycat dolls|`|Ahu79Bbnaa	love story , and hey stephen by taylor swift

If there is one thing I learned in the experience of relationships, in order to have one, You need to act yourself. Don't try to impress him, because eventually he's going to know your not acting your fullest. Just have a normal conversation with him - I know you may be too shy or something, But.. It's probably the best thing. It's not like it's a crime to start a conversation with a boy. And, If he gives you the "look" and starts the conversation, he probably do like you. But if he walks away, which I doubt he would, Then.. Well, you know. <br>  Remember honey, If he doesn't show interest there's always one person in the world right for you. Don't take it too seriously, Pretend it meant nothing. He'll just forget you even liked him if your worried about embarrassment. Good luck, darling.

Plus if you have kissed her on the cheek then it wouldn't matter if you made it official. (depends on your age, junior high- make it official, HS- doesn't matter)

Most 16 year old guys like 14 years old girls. They like girls younger usually. When you talk to him try to be friendly and don't take it too fast. You can talk about things you two like to do. Ask him if he wants to hang out somewhere. It doesn't have to be for a date, maybe just ask you hang out. I think he will be interested in you.|`|rlOcRW0Faa	Well it depends. If he has made eye contact with you he's probably attracted to you but he is not sure. I'm in the same position but with a girl. We are both in the 9th grade. I get really nervous around him no matter how hard I try not to. It's all about CONFIDENCE. I just hope somehow we'll strike up a conversation and i will not let the conversation go. If the guy you like like you he'll probably notice everything you do and will respond to anything you say. If he's trying to show off around you he probably likes you.

RlVt6vLlaa	Well, if he said that he just likes you as a friend, that's pretty much it. Although there's always ways to make someone like you, you just have to show them your personality and have some things in common with this guy. I mean, it'll take some time and everything though so you'd have to be patient and sit on your feelings for a while but hopefully it'll be worthwhile in the end, though. Best of luck.

Uyiw7bECaa	Its YOUR choice.  are you really going to let the fact that somebody else fancies you ruin what you really want?  Think of how much you'll be hurting Geo's feelings if yiou turn him down.  Think of your own feelings if you turn them both down.  Kevin is an outsider in this relationship.  If you and Geo like eachother then you cant just refuse him.  Kevin will find the right person for him, too.  If you turn down Geo for Kevin, then does that mean you will turn down every boy int he future just because you dont want to hurt Kevin? No! So just give it a shot with Geo! Go for it girl!|`|tLOUuf3Maa	yeah this has happened to me plenty of times.<br>  <br>  go for the guy you like and don't worry about kevin.<br>  tell him you like him no more than as a friend.<br>  if he gets hurt, then he has to deal with it.|`|VsXWA8CCaa	wait a week and see if Geo asks U out, if he does say yes, if he doesn't ask keven out.  I've been in plenty of these situations.|`|6yXlP6kfaa	Stick with Geo. Can't say it's really happened to me but sticking with Geo would be the best choice.|`|ae2ad2cc5ede49f9d7d19d7e5a930320aa	Go for Geo. Kevin will have to sadly deal with it. It's called life. He'll move on. Do what will make YOU happy.|`|Dm2TnQKKaa	go out with geo, and break it to kevin nicely. you can't do what makes other people happy in a situation like this, you have to think about what makes you happy. same thing happened to me, and i went with the one i felt worse rejecting. i broke up with him 3 weeks later, though, for the other kid, who i had liked for months.
OM7naICBaa	listen girl if he really cares about you none of that matters! but no i dont mind a prickly yaya but not hairy hairy little boobs he shouldnt care sex should be done when you are in lovee if your in love nothing matters except that you are sharing that moment with them!|`|8yncQq62aa	shaved and smooth... cause if he decides to go down on you, it will make his experience alot better, which will result in a better experience for you.<br>  <br>  and boobs arent a big deal. as long as he can grab them, your good to go. but really, it makes no difference.|`|dSTQnHPraa	I'm 18 haha, as for your question shaved is the best and its okay if its not totally smooth. Boob size doesnt really bother me either way.|`|m1PQZLXTaa	doesn't matter and doen't matter.|`|fN23bHi0aa	If you have sex with him he can go to jail|`|zHI6z5FZaa	a very smooth pussy is extremly sexy. shave it right before you do it to be safe. i like small to medium boobs. its just personal preferance
NMtwjGsTaa	well us girls REALLY like it when you guys smell good! or at least i do! lol! if this girl is really outgoing then she might say it flat out that you smell good! But theres a HIGH possiblity that she may like you! and for your thing about talking to girls, just go with it okay?  just be yourself and see where that gets you! Maybe compliment her on something shes wearing? Or saying something nice? Just go with it and BE YOURSELF!! thats my advice for you! :]<br>  Hope this helps you! :]|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	girls like it when guys smell good and her actually telling you was probably her way of trying to flirt.|`|lme3wCWWaa	omg we go crazy in our head. if they smell so good. omg yes
7e4jxj3Daa	Nix the tat and forget the piercing.|`|SszvBQUvaa	Tattoo on your back, and I personally don't find the downstairs piercing hot.|`|CqzxTGpKaa	its hot on you i know trust me, get the tattoo on your right shoulder<br>  <br>  why you being shady girl. you said i was soo hot|`|6d7ad32c5c3c2f0927eb6d84735a5d0caa	Getting your vag pierced is probably the most disgusting thing that you can do.  You must be a real whore
aalejwccaa	well follow your heart
0KXiwjDbaa	Do you know what it means when someone says, “you shouldn’t wear you heart on your sleeve?”  There are a lot of nice people in the world, but it only takes a handful of jerks to make it seem like the world is overrun with mean people.  When I was a teenager I wanted everybody to like me, too.  That’s just not possible in the real world.  <br>  <br>  You seem really sweet and you should never change that, but please be aware that people often mistake kindness for weakness.  When someone says something mean to you there are three options: One, you can ignore it.  If you are confident enough about who you are that is probably the best option.  99% percent of what comes out of other peoples mouths isn’t worth the air it took to say it!  <br>  <br>  Two, you can defend yourself.  If someone says something about you that isn’t true you have the right to call them on it.  People respect others who know when to stand their ground and when to let something go so be sure to choose your battles carefully.  <br>  <br>  Three, you can retaliate and sling mud right back at them.  Some people try to do this in a humorous way, but in my opinion, it’s never worth stooping to their level.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	You're very lovely hon. The guy's a jerk!|`|3e6a7b1f3e03a56ef0cc271441e2531daa	Okay this guy wants you and he thinks he can control your by putting you down until you think you are dirt.  That way he will be able to pay you a minor compliment and have you act so happy.  Its a manipulation ploy.<br>  <br>  Just tell this jerk that you find his stench disgusting and walk away.|`|pFHIWMYiaa	No you're not ugly at all. No offense, but this is just constructive criticism. You're nose is kinda big, but other than that you have really nice teeth, pretty hair, and a nice body from what I can see. Just walk by him in the halls with your head held high. Who cares what he thinks there are plenty of other boys in the school who probably think you're gorgeous.|`|B0nTbAkwaa	He's obviously blind you're really pretty! He's a jerk and it's best to forget about him because he's soo not worth your time.|`|poNwDl4uaa	No, you're not ugly.|`|933YqFLNaa	he wants you to think about him - so he has accomplished his objective you're totally enthralled with him!!|`|K89wOGSbaa	that doesnt look like its you...i think its a model that u copy and pasted...try showing your real picture then maybe people could give u a real answer|`|1ngp0jgxaa	if that's really you, you're gorgeous!
oEAkNniDaa	watch videos of people doing strips and do what they do. go to youtube|`|gqHy3821aa	Just ditch the condoms lol. If you think there won't be an accident. :)
b2j5AE1oaa	well here is what you do first:<br>  <br>  #1.break her and her bf up so that leaves and an open slot for you<br>  <br>  #2 ask her out and if she says yes go get it on!!!|`|Hp1rNHduaa	lol join the club<br>  I want a boyfriend, but don't like anyone =(|`|dSTQnHPraa	Then just wait, you dont need to constantly have a girlfriend. Besides usualy when you ask random people out like that it doesnt workout between you two
8McA6xqPaa	perhaps take the upper hand and start introducing him as your boyfriend? <br>  Leave subtle hints perhaps?
Xpj8Mn2laa	Can you meet her at her house and walk to school together? If so pick her some flowers and greet her at her house with them. <br>  *Could buy a cd with some songs on there that makes you think of her and put a post it note on the cd saying something "number 2 / 3 remind me of you :) " <br>  <br>  *Get her a cute birthday card and her fav choc / lollies<br>  *Take her out to lunch on the weekend - pack her a picnic :)<br>  *Stick a balloon in a card and say I wanted to take you hot ait ballooning but couldn't find one - so I got you a hot air balloon seed :P <br>  *Get her a cute teddy/chocs and sweet card<br>  *Write all the things you like about her on post-it's and put it in a little <br>  jar. <br>  <br>  Any girl would just love that her crush thought of her on her birthday so I'm sure anything you do will be a hit.  :)<br>  <br>  Calling her at midnight is a cute idea -  :)|`|KSdxlnFfaa	write her a letter or something cute and give it to her at school,|`|suoY5vxbaa	Why would you call her at midnight? I wouldn't. She might be sleeping! Haha. I would get her flowers and a necklace or a bracelet or something nice like that. Then maybe ask her out if you want to! Good Luck!|`|HOVvKqxsaa	ask her out on her birthday!<br>  if she has plans do it friday as a belated birthday dinner but dont tell her its for her birthday
RlVt6vLlaa	He probably found someone else and didn't want any "suspicious" facebook comments on his account. Or something. Guys are just weird like that though. Just move on with life and find someone new as well.|`|cH3l3myKaa	Hes probably hurt by the fact that he wont be in ur future relationship wise & having u on facebook and tlkin to u nonstop might be a constent reminder of wat could have been but never was.
T891gsHraa	my opinion sweetie is dont txt him let him txt you first,and if he doesnt then you know he isnt interested and not worth your time to be worrying about it,please dont txt him :0) best of luck|`|Rtj0tPTDaa	aw stupid boys don't ever know what they want.  Don't fret about it, doll.  Just know that if he doesn't get his crap together, then it's his loss and not yours.  It COULD just be a situation of him being too nervous.  Since he didn't hear it from you, personally, he might think everyone is playing a joke on him and he might not think that you actually like him.  Just relax and breathe ok?  I hate that you're crying because I know how boys make girls cry.  I've cried over so many guys in my lifetime.  I've been dumped and just screwed over.  Don't let one idiot boy get your down if he's just playing games.  He was supposed to text you, so don't text him.  Just wait until tomorrow, pull him aside and ask what he thinks of your friends gossiping about your business.  Act subtle about it though and joke and laugh like it doesn't bother you that he didn't text you.  Make sure you flirt. Like touch his arm while you're laughing and hug him before you separate.|`|6a23d4378fc62f24a25913afcd956609aa	well.........to tell u the truth....i was acting just like u a few days ago, and the advice that i had gotten, was the best advice.! it actually worked!<br>  i say u should ignore it. u know u shouldnt actually be the one running after him, instead u should let him be the one running after u!!! think positive!<br>  but my quest is, do u think he likes u?<br>  <br>  if so then he surely will text u......u should not act depressed! u  should act like nothin has happened....it'll hurt but it'll work.!!<br>  trust me, u'll be the best couple!!|`|KdRjx7bCaa	he is probably nervous,  dont freak out. he is sorting out his feelings. he needs to find out if he wants to risk his friendship with you. because relationships dont last as long as friendships. so dont worry, give him time. if he decides you just a friend. dont be insulted, you guys can still be buds. the akwardness will die down.|`|D2gs1e8Baa	well you can ask this advice at jamrie.com<br>  its more of a personal advice website.<br>  people over there might be able to help you out.<br>  <br>  i go there all the time!|`|jwfH1rFSaa	Well just take it easy, and eventually you should talk to him about it. Be confident, and just bring it up casually...hope i helped Good luck!|`|ffe5b4e9d8d943a550d12ff1c8245b78aa	i say you should go for it if you really like him thats how i got my boy friend hahahah good luck though i hope it goes well|`|HXuQwpaNaa	give him time 1 to 5 days them you text
BKr3y30maa	I'm a woman...I will not date a guy that is a drunk, druggie, or a jerk....no matter how good-looking he is.  Please don't put us all in that category.  Yes, some women are like that.  But not all of us.  You'll find someone eventually.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	I'm very fullfilled being that type man, I must admit
eO4y3m1maa	Do things like + and - magnets...u can wear a sexy black number red shoes and a plus sign on your dress.. and the guy can wear a nice black suit with a minus on the front!
SIE3HuHRaa	It seems like he likes u...but the whole rubbing thing is a littl creepppyy....he could be trying to make his girlfriend jealous for some reason so be careful on this one!|`|HWF5SnCdaa	I would say so, do you know his girlfriend personally, if you do, you should talk to him in private about it, before anything happens.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	Absolutely!|`|nVdYIHhzaa	i have a girlfriend and i flirt like that<br>  <br>  not the rubbing but i know guys who do and their girlfriends don't even care.
SQ58FR8Laa	After your friends with a girl for a while the grow to trust you. so they know that if the two of you go out she can trust that in the end you'll still be friends and thats what a girl cares about. So ask her out|`|ykcgrOBzaa	Start small, so you can see her reactions. Like give her a flower, not a rose, but like a daisy or something. See how she responds. You can also do some digging, and find out who she likes. Since you are good friends she probably won't suspect anything. Eventually, you will have to tell her your feelings, but if you are shy, tell her on like the last day of school or something. That way, if it goes wrong, you won't have to see her fdor a while.|`|oXZlkLXSaa	OMG, this is incredible, my friend Erin has this friend Nick Espinoza, and he likes her and she likes him, sorry, though, thats the only thing that attracted me to this question. Same name, same problem!<br>  But, um, I guess, just wait 'till ya'll are alone, then kiss her. Make yourself blush, (if you can), then leave. What happens next is yours!|`|bAnyRNZUaa	You don't ever want to be friends with girls, man....not only to they never give you any ***, but they generally make HORRIBLE friends when it matters.  If you like her, make a move, but she'll probably shoot you down.  But so what?  If you need a another friend, buy a dog.|`|9NF2UGYOaa	just come out to her slowly you never know she could be feeling the same thing you are but she dosent want to ruin a friendship if you dont like her|`|mCQx7Co5aa	you'll only find out if you asked her, go ahead and ask her...but also tell her how much her friendship means to you, and tell her if her answer is a no that you'd like to stay friends|`|DmFyG1Sraa	if you been friends for a while you may be in the friend zone and she may jus like you as a friend, if it hasnt been that long you still got a shot but it may move to the friend zone soon, good luck.
qZVlDHBTaa	Just around my 3 month with my boyfriend, I got him little trinkets that meant something to both of us. They were pretty much tangible versions of our inside jokes. He loved them. Good Luck!!!|`|bcO9G7C8aa	You should get him something he would really like hmm....<br>  get him a 25 dollar gift card for starbucks and put it in side his dream video game/book.
VsykS80xaa	It depends on who you ask. Guys have different views on what is the perfect girl/woman. It all depends on who they are.|`|riC03pclaa	A perfect girl is understanding and maybe a little funny. And the virgin thing is a plus because that only makes you more trustworthy. Looks don't matter.|`|FLAtdWrmaa	Virgins rarely know how to make their partners content, never mind happy.  There's nothing special about virgins (gals OR guys), unless you get turned on by the mere thought of being someone's "first" -- like that's some sort of sexual achievement.<br>  <br>  6 billion people in the world, and every single one of us was born a virgin.  What exactly is the big deal?<br>  <br>  The only virginity that really counts is your own. Having sex with someone else who is a virgin guarantees you exactly nothing.<br>  <br>  So: do you still want to find the perfect girl?  Then you'll have to be the perfect guy.<br>  <br>  But you can't be a perfect guy?  Then forget trying to find the perfect girl.  Or perfect sex, either -- there's no such thing.

tQs3nrhxaa	na i think its just the feeling after you do it, <br>  you have to think sometimes when having sex,<br>  like if any and i mean any circumstances *** up? Will you the man of the relationship step up or shut up and leave??<br>  <br>  and if  you like children you have 3wonderful ones<br>  if you dont like children then you have 3problems lol see my point

If she's young and you two haven't been dating long she probably doesn't love you either. She's probably mistaking being happy for love.

If she's older and you've been together for awhile then you should tell her your heart isn't in the same place and end things.|`|LjHjVcfHaa	dont text back...dont play around and tell her that u love her too|`|6oMF0EIpaa	THANKS!!

You might have been talking when he was around and two weeks later he'll say, "Well, your favorite food is pasta..."<br>  <br>  *His voice changes when he talks to you in a group. He may say "Hey." to everyone with you, but the "Hey." to you is a little different.<br>  <br>  *His voice gets softer when the two of you talk.<br>  <br>  Sometimes he stares straight into your eyes.<br>  <br>  *His eyes get 'soft' when he looks at you. They change slightly or get relaxed around the edges. It's subtle, but you can tell if you watch...<br>  (You may already be aware of it at a subconscious level - that's what made you start wondering if he likes you...)<br>  <br>  When he's near you or talking with you, his eyes travel in a little circle around your face and land back on your eyes. (Like he's looking at your whole face - then back to your eyes.)<br>  <br>  *He watches your lips. (Dead give away.)<br>  <br>  *His friends start asking you questions - if you haven't met him yet - they may ask what your name is. Or may ask you what you think about 'him.'<br>  <br>  If his friends are paying attention to you after he's been staring at you - it can mean that he's been talking about you.<br>  <br>  *He tells you that you smell nice...<br>  (No hidden meaning here - it's a good thing.)<br>  <br>  *He might act weird around you or seem very nervous. His behavior may just plain change when you're around.<br>  If he's normally quiet, he may get louder, or vice versa. It's the difference in behavior that's the clue.<br>  <br>  If you ever need anything else feel free to email me @: godsbaby42@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  *Much Love* ~God Bless~
1ZeNgdUaaa	Was it the first time he was over for dinner?  If so, he was probably just nervous.  It's quite nerve racking to meet the parents for the first time.  If he's already comfortable with your family he may have just been stressed out over work or something.  I wouldn't look too much into it.|`|H1qpJc6Daa	he was nervous like a little boy at Michael Jackson's house. ( ohh that was bad wasn't it?)
e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	Means he likes you, at least a little.

Not the ones with all the piercings though, thats weird, but i do like tattoos|`|1utgyP5waa	the one who give me some *** fast and easy!|`|PVsKQAVEaa	hmmmm i personally like a girl that is herself, a simple girl who is nice, caring and loving. what she wears is not really important, its her personality. but i do like a girl just in jeans and t shirt. iam not really pick when it comes to that.|`|tc5rX4dhaa	I prefer city girls who wear casual stuff, like T's and Jeans|`|CyWEam38aa	surfer chick, city girl...|`|AA10337794	human - born a female - breathing on her own - and legal age|`|JdhvctGeaa	hot sluty ones call me 1626 822 0949|`|mKtnY4Lhaa	i like girls that are fit and dress well
mZa4EwFqaa	you need too tell her how you feel. i wish my ex whom broke up with me not too long ago would ask me back.. i miss him like crazy. im sure she still has feelings for you.
SweWC8p1aa	She likes you, for a fact. Just to try make a move on her more.|`|H1qpJc6Daa	maybe ur over analyzing. But you should see if there is any vibe between you two, then make ur judgment from there
opJ2V7Jiaa	Well, eventually people break up, that's just the truth, so support your friend in doing what she wants, and you keep everyone as a friend, and then if you still like the guy when they eventually break up, you can have him. <br>  <br>  but a lot of things change in a short period of time, don't get too caughtup in this. :D<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!
oAPSJnSEaa	Mexican food...iuno if thats good if your planning to get nookie its hard on a full stomach. Do something light like sushi or fruits and veggies maybe grilled chicken.

GA5BAhaRaa	I don't really believe in it.<br>  Maybe that's just me being cynical.<br>  But for the time being I'm thoroughly convinced its just a thing people invent to delude themselves into thinking they're happy.|`|bvwYVGJOaa	Well you havent been there yet that intense feeling for someone so it's okay take your time and you'll get there. <br>  <br>  find out what you want, in life, career and in a woman. Then date her and get to know her more. As relationship grows you'll develop the feelings deeper and you'll say those special three words yourself without realising it.|`|lq2Ewg5Zaa	I dont believe either...<br>  i mean i do absolutely anything for this guy,i love him with all my heart,i still care about him even after everything that happen,im there for him im sweet and i do whats best for him...but that still not enough i mean WTF? what am i supposed to do then?|`|k7jGZydJaa	I don't believe in love. Sex sounds fun though, but I don't believe in sex before marriage. I'm going to be a virgin forever. :(|`|CyWEam38aa	there's plenty of people like you|`|rTvCXF94aa	Here's the thing, you may not be the only one who doesn't BELIEVES in love, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. God still exists even though people don't believe in him. Just because I don't believe in oxygen doesn't mean we're all going to all start gasping for air. The reason you don't believe in love is because you've never experienced it or because You did and you lost them. So I hope that someday you find your true love so you can believe in it.|`|0yaQQSwoaa	Love exist you just haven't found it.. let me tell you something, they say most people that look for an ideal partner usually look for some or most of the characteristics that their Mother/Father have that they like, now as for a perfect love, that their is no such thing being the fact that we are all human and none of us are perfect overall in anyway.|`|rRvoOPvzaa	You really haven't realized anything. You've just closed yourself off. Love is real, it's just not easy. And if you can't hack it, well, i guess it just "doesn't exist".|`|Llo3XzGFaa	that's very possible<br>  I believe in it<br>  I've been in love...<br>  why don't you believe|`|AA11560862	I do believe in it, I just don't believe that everyone can have it. <br>  Does that make sense?|`|ronomgTIaa	I was like you before. I too believed that there is no such thing as love and that its just a chemical reaction in your brain (which technically is the scientific way to explain love). But then i found a boy and well realized that love really does exist. You just need to find that special someone. Then you'll stop being so cynical about love.
DWLbXd79aa	why is ur name ariel? u from the little mermaid?<br>  <br>  she has a bf, back off, if she wanted u she'd let u know, do u have any tattoos? do u get in fights? its not all about looks ariel, its about personality!!!!!!!! and sumtimes bank account, so ariel there are many more fish in the sea<br>  <br>  u seem like a dork and a vagina

Just think of all the good things about her and what made you fall for her...be truthful.|`|rRvoOPvzaa	The truth. The reasons she makes you happy. Why you can't wait to see her. Just tell her the reasons why you said it.
dHID1XDoaa	Well (If she has classes with you) ask her if she finished the homework. Well of course if you had homework. Or ask if she gets something. She'll most likely say "Uhm, yeah. Did you want to see it?" Just say yeah. Then just ask her if she could explain it to you. She will and just try to start up a joke conversation. I have really no idea for starters but they usually just come. And the worst you could do is she won't seem interested. If she doesn't seem interested at first, go to her each day. Not with the same thing but just a hi. You should become more comfortable and just let it come.
F0oxB10aaa	no dont tell her just bang her and get out lol but get sum practice firts like on a sex doll or sumfin|`|47Ou1oq3aa	yeah tell her she'll appreciate you for telling the truth.|`|eifnAdTtaa	she could be lying to get your attention. don't tell her - don't fall for it. just wait.|`|gyixPyOsaa	ah ya! duh|`|3eNxDmp1aa	Tell her. trust me we would want to know!!!|`|vjnUENK0aa	honestly, IF  you want a serious relationship with her, you should start by being honest with her even before you date.|`|lq2Ewg5Zaa	so good looking and so ignorant!!!|`|tQs3nrhxaa	yes, because you want stuff with this girl always to be special.<br>  if you want things to stay right you want a thing call trust and honesty,<br>  to get these things i think you should even tell her the stuff that is in your heart.|`|NS57cIo1aa	honesty is very important in a relationship|`|weE5FxCfaa	from a woman's stand point i would say tell her.  it would probably make her feel closer to you.|`|CyWEam38aa	ya<br>   be honest if you really like her <br>  if she likes you too then she will be fine
pvZZ9Jzmaa	depends...if either or both of you are very involved in your religion.  Then, yes, it will be a horrible problem.
aTBCXt8Taa	Hey thanks for sharing!<br>  <br>  I suggest you try the following steps and is guarantee to work. You may look for another girl but I know the one you really want is her.<br>  <br>  Break her attitude- <br>  <br>  This is a situation where by she is experiencing an ego boost where she thinks you are readily available to her and she can play around with you as and when she pleases. The best way to break this is to completely stop all modes of communication. Yes if you are after her than start going out with someone else. Don't even look at her when she passes by. Doing this would normally lead to her ego being shed and she would feel somewhat insulted with you paying no attention to her anymore.<br>  <br>  You don't need her anymore- <br>  <br>  Pretend as if you don't want her anymore and you have many more options now. This would make her feel rejected and this is the feeling that no one wants to experience. Once she starts feeling somewhat ignored and rejected she would automatically come back to you.<br>  <br>  You have better things to do- <br>  <br>  Don't give your time to her anymore. Try to act as busy as possible even if you are not too busy. This pattern involves reverse psychology and is known to work on almost every human being.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|AA10330963	Ignore everyone answers!  Chase her. guys are supposed to do the chasing. Now, I do think it should be a little equal. When you both say to each other that you are interested in the other, than , you both should call each other, it should not be no one playing hard to get. <br>  <br>  how do you know this girl is playing hard to get? do you call her? email her? text her? talk to her in person? do these things first and ask her out plainly and you will know. ok. im not sure how old you are, but if you are 18 and younger , well you got a long way to go...<br>  If you are 21 and up go on a date with her first. yes try harder!!<br>  <br>   Attn: all guys: chase a girl who tells you that she likes you. and you like her back! It will feel good that you did the initation first!|`|wr2uiZk7aa	That girl wants to make sure you're geniunely interested in her.  She doesn't want a guy who is like a playboy going to different girls.  You can try harder and see.  Go for another girl if she is too reluctant.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	Have your eye on another one<br>  so if she is playing hard to get and she sees u backing off<br>  she'll come back on lol<br>  and if she doesnt come back on<br>  stay off and check out other girls lol|`|BZVlzAywaa	Girls play hard to get because they want you to chase them. It's nothing personal. If you win the game, you get them. It's like they're way of seeing if you're really worth it. Girls like to feel wanted. However, be on your guard. She could just be leading you on, and that would suck. Give it a week or two. If nothing happens, it's time to move on.
dkGnUPM9aa	I'm a skater and i say:<br>  <br>  Embrace the power of the board(not literally, just dress like a boarder.<br>  <br>  Wear tight jeans, and you may not think this is important, but boys love it when girls wear converse shoes!!<br>  <br>  And don't go for colored jeans, unless there pink tight jeans other wise go for regular black or blue jeans.|`|2B7gs9RIaa	Tight pants for sure.<br>  And tight colorful shirts.|`|yTYjMlbUaa	iam a skater i get girls all the time be your self and dont act like you know how to skateboard or talk about it like you know about it ok
72a759eadcb04ef83b501e2c3dcde213aa	I'm not gonna lie to you; sex is a really big thing - it is important.    but bear in mind if I don't like the girl, i can easily dump her or not even bothered to go out with her in the first place.    In another perspective:  I do want someone who is interesting, spontaneous to talk to  I do want someone who is not a complete pain in the neck and don't dwell on every moment on despising  I do want someone who is fun and playful to tease and I can 'play' with  I do want to be understood by someone who can understand me and is considerate enough to take it all in  I do want to be supported in the tough times and help support the other person back  I do want someone who I can enjoy my time with and do things together that few of my mates would appreciate  I do want someone who I can keep warm and comfort  I do want a woman (in the distant future) to have kids with me and be the fun mum that she is with healthy growing children    Of course, the woman has to be pretty damn special with all the right things that I look for in a woman.    If you're advertising for sex, then chances are you will get it (they call that a self fulfilling prophecy).    If you want a relationship, then you should go and find a person who is looking for the same thing.    hope this helps|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	It depends how old they are, young kids say between 16 and 24/25 will want it as much as they can get it and they dont care who with and then you will get the older more mature ones say 25 + that will appreciate a woman for other things besides sex.  If you are attracting the wrong type of man, change the bait, there are some decent guys out there but mostly they are prehistoric losers that think a woman is just a porthole for his steamer.  Its up to you to say no.|`|ijeninncaa	Some of them are actually out for a relationship with someone till the day they die, believe it or not.    I know some of them are self centred and stuff but there is some good out there still...|`|aCdya2qkaa	Sarah, I dont even want a woman, how is that for an answer. Women are poison they are like black widow spiders, they use the man, have babies, kill the man, and do the same to the next man. I am not even making this up, I really truly feel this about women, I wont be in another relationship till i find the right woman.At the moment,women are pure venom!|`|YyFexhd3aa	yep just SEX .....hell no do you think we are all that superfical of course not|`|IkWcwsj8aa	NO not only one thing but that one thing is important aswell!|`|zoH6rMCPaa	Three things:    Cooking  Cleaning  Sex|`|F4d89iRMaa	majority of the young ones do bc of their hormones! of course, when there are feelings involve that one thing isn't what they're always after. we're all human. we all have needs. sex gets lonely if thats the only thing they want and the older you get the wiser you are and more important things start to matter rather than just sex. but there are those who just stay that way, like sex addicts.|`|4ebfc96012aef4fc15dc59c42ecac5a7aa	I don't think all men are the same.  Men feel the same way about us when something goes wrong with a relationship.    I think it is easy to say and sometimes calming for the injured party to categorise all men/women as being the same.  We tend to follow the same methods sometimes, but there are usually reasons why we did what we did.    The most unfaithful man can marry a woman and be faithful - it is because she is the right one for him, same with women.    I think we all have similar traits when it comes to dating, some think of others feelings more than others, some just throw themselves into the world of dating without a care in the world on who's feelings they trample on.    We are a pretty predictable species - but not all the same, that is what makes the world go round.    :)|`|d8yrvK4waa	NO.    You know why i can't convince you? You've already made up your mind    SteveC|`|hqdpFrltaa	i cant sorry love|`|3WCONjyfaa	not every guy wants the same thing. You just have to find them. I think they are somewhere in Italy.|`|dJ0fC0ORaa	no they arnt all the same u just havnt found the ONE|`|K8j8MRGwaa	sorry but its usually one thing every once in a while you will find a guy who likes u but other than that they just wanna hit it|`|A2HRe2c4aa	of course not. my boyfriend's nothing like that, you've just gotta meet the right guy,|`|ZkEicvapaa	well that might be the way you look at it i am sure everyone likes sex. man come on i bet you like it too. i mean you should be happy you get to get laid. lol|`|sK73UzbUaa	no!!|`|4b26cb1a8069288001778a663299498baa	There's no way i can convince you because i've never been able to convince myself. sorry chica.|`|FOtNl2Lxaa	nah i think once you get past a certain age the reality of it all starts to kick in no one wants to be alone for the long run so you start to desire the things needed to start a family... some guys tend to wait a little too long and miss the boat|`|4UAZ6O2Daa	I'm sorry for being cold, but we can't stop you from believing what you want to believe. Once you have found that special someone (like I have), your mindset will change totally.|`|dVxdDYrdaa	haha!      well many do but few are serious|`|pdcnH6haaa	NO! I think you're talking about sex. The best thing to do to know if a guy wants you for more than sex is what is his conversation centered around, is he always trying to make a move, and if he has history of cheating (ask straight up.) If he's not willing to wait at least 6 months he may have a motive. So don't give it up so easy if you feel like you love him. If he loves you for real, he'll wait as long as you want.     Believe guys who say they aren't ready for relationship and just want friends or friends with privileges. Unless they change their mind, they will do what they say. Don't believe that you can change their mind.     I for one have never cheated on a girlfriend and was always up front with what I wanted. If it was just friends/friends with privileges than I told my friend/mate. If a man is up front with you, at least you can respect that. Some men aren't into that, and there are a lot of religious guys who are cool too who are looking for just one woman.     Also think about where you're picking your guys up. Certain places like clubs, certain bars etc will get you those guys looking to get laid because that's why they go.     And finally, there is no sure fire way to know if a man will cheat, use you for sex, or sway twenty years down the road. Work at your relationship and MAKE HIM WAIT!!! Keep the mystery alive. Wait a year. If he's after you for sex, he'll crack or he's just willing to wait as long as it takes.     Hope that helped a little.|`|hAMLMYL8aa	not all men are the same some men (only a few lol) are not after one thing.|`|rHibi83saa	no not all guys but if you find a guy that does want sex your lucky you get to be in a non relationship and have sex anytime take it as a blessing not a curse|`|AA11618168	no there are at least 3 (maybe 4) things we want.|`|aIakDSstaa	If you mean cooking then no, most of you are rubbish at it|`|MHg9JhEKaa	There are some guys out who aren't like this.

Just as there are good and bad women so there are good and bad men.  And most certainly dont want them for one thing only - they want them for cooking cleaning ironing and changing the TV channels as well!  Joke !  Trolls before you start thumbing down.  You may have just been unlucky but there are a huge amount of decent men out there and you do them an injustice by saying this.    Be careful in your choice is all.

Its so fun when you turn the tables!!|`|4HoVVCenaa	They are a type of "player" and players are easy to spot when you know what to look for. The biggest sign post is they don't ever let you "inside" the real them. They don't let you get to know who and what they are. They are manipulative and are skilled at making you feel good. But then, if you have enough money, does it matter?     And having been there and done that, sex only is the frosting, and it can be rich frosting, but after a while, one starts craving some substance, some true friendship, some true companionship.
L4Rlvxnhaa	Well 1st off i think its great that you sent her a poem and flowers on valentine's day =] that shows that you really like her cause you gave her something original instead of  something store bought. She does like you.

I'm going through a quite similar situation too. Here I am waiting for him and begging for him back because we both cannot deny that what we have lived together in the relationship has been great. Now, all this drama you're recently going through is just a phase, it will pass. Work things out between the both of you and I'm sure you'll be his fiancee again in no time.    Good luck and congratulations on your wedding! =)|`|YmYLp2xBaa	Love hurts doesn't it...! You can move on, sounds like your lacking a little self dignity and you maybe a little insecure about yourself. But im 24, Iv been engaged and had met some amazing women in my time.     Life does go on and you got a lot to give. But to be honest even though sex and love are separate things both of you shouldn't of slept around while you still had emotional attachments to each other, which has messed it up even more, but that comes with experience and time. So basicly... move on, there are plenty of more fish.
60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	No one, no couple, no relationship, nothing is perfect. People who expect that out of you are unrealistic, will cause you a lot of headaches and pain, and eventually you will leave because the truth is that those are very unrealistic expectations that are based in fantasy and have little to do with the reality of a person or the relationship.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to postpone the wedding indefinitely. You have many valid concerns that could cause both you and your daughter a lot of misery if you marry this man. It seems like you have many reasons to take more time to get to know him, and to explore if sharing your life with him is what is really best for you, daughter, your happiness, and well-being for a lifetime.<br>  <br>  I know you must love him to have gotten engaged. But if I were you I would take these feelings as a serious warning sign and put the breaks on. You don't have to break up, but 16 months is not even 2 years and you are already seeing and feeling many issues that are red flags.<br>  <br>  I have rushed into things in the past, only to regret it. I know everyone is different but I really have come to learn that you don't really know a person until at least 2 years have passed. Even more can be needed for a lifetime commitment.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your fiance has some major disrespect and unrealistic, unloving, and just bad habits overall. You need to be sure you are making the right decision. This is your life and your daughters life you are dealing with.<br>  <br>  I also think that if your fiance is not interested in your daughter that is going to be a major problem and issue for all of you, and certainly not a man I would consider marrying if I were you.<br>  <br>  Please take your time to work these things out before tying the knot. You don't want that knot to become a noose.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	You should move out.  Once you move out decide whether or not he is then worth anymore of your time.  He sounds like a taker and not a giver.  Once you do this you may realize it's not a good idea to live with a man prior to marriage for many reasons.  The foremost reason being a poor example for your child.|`|XLsnuAqmaa	a leopard never changes it's spots.  acceptance is key.  sit down and have a heart to heart with him.  if he can't put in a bit of effort and help out and appreciate you more tell him you are rethinking the marriage because who wants to live like this for the rest of thier lives....|`|mCM363I9aa	stop taking him so seriously, ignore the stupid comments and go on about yourself. He will eventually see what an a** he is and may change.|`|r2Xi9kASaa	He is controlling you. You need to take a stand and stop doing all his work for him. Maybe then he will realize what he does have. If he does not listen you need to move on. You can't let him treat you like that. Take a stand and lay out the rules and if he does not like it... time to move on. I know you love him, but sometimes things don't work, but it always ends up ok. I hope for the best for you.|`|5ca74cb9e6d3604c2c41d86d59b901beaa	you have to accept this is how its gonna be, that that is how he is.And you guys are only fiances, so if you feel he wont change and ask yourself this question seriously..don't try to kid yourself and say he will if you honestly know he wont, then maybe if you don't want to deal with  'til death do us part, then you need to look out for yourself and maybe end it.|`|CWVBfaPwaa	Stop doing everything for him and make him do it himself, regardless of what names he calls you! Tell him to do the things himself so he can see all what you really do. Maybe then he'll appreciate you more. Stop laying his clothes out, he's a big boy he can get his own clothes. Make him grow the f*** up!|`|4DDSD9Syaa	First thing you are doing too much. Back off. Let him carry his own weight. What is he 5 years old that you have to put out his clothes? He can do that for himself. If he really wants the relationship he WILL make the changes. Speak your mind to him, don't be afraid. Fear is what holds us back. If he doesn't like it he can go. You have a dtr. as a priority not him. Look after yourself and her first. He is a grown *** man. He needs to put in the responsibility. Before you marry him get what you want or else you will be signing divorce paper quick.|`|65ojSBXgaa	What you are sweetheart is a caring, devoted loving woman who deserves better treatment from a man. What you are doing is loving too much for this man and he pays it back with hurtful things. Talking to a person as such wont work believe me I know. I use to get treated like that as well I tried talking (even tough I knew what was expected) finding solutions reading articles but nothing work. He doesn’t care about nobody but himself I understand he is ill but that’s no way to treat someone. Believe me what you are feeling is what it is and it comes with soo emotional things like pain, loneliness, used etc..<br>  My advice to you is to let go if this person aint willing to change for you and realize the mistakes he is doing then you have no choice but to let go other wise you will be sad forever. If he loves you he will do whatever it takes to make YOU happy. You have done enough it’s his turn. If he decides not to love you? Always remember to love yourself. Ask yourself that question; Doyou love yourself? Is his love worth all the pain?        Good Luck   -Gail (Dr. Love)|`|UKqJiIlGaa	take care of yourself and prepare yourself to start letting go.....|`|xNkmK0SHaa	" He is quite immature and I have to be the adult in the relationship."<br>  <br>  A relationship is doomed from the beginning unless both are mature.<br>  <br>  I'm sure his behaviors aren't new, so I wonder why you have accepted them up until now.   I suspect you don't love him, but are fearful to be without him.<br>  <br>  Leave now.  Things will not get better.  They haven't, have they?|`|elhcuN19aa	I left my ex gf who took me for granted....<br>  I hope she realized that I was good to her but oh well life goes on lol<br>  maybe later on down the road we can be friends but not right now<br>  <br>  My advise to you would be stop doing the good stuff for him.....<br>  He is a taker and not a giver....<br>  He will continue to take and then take your heart for a joyride....
fZw6ImUGaa	It's not in our nature. We don't talk about feelings, we act. Secondly, let me asssure you that it is not in the least bit avaisable to be open about your feelings unless they are exactly what the woman wantst to hear.|`|wovoZ5Z0aa	Men ARE honest about their feelings.  It sounds like you want him to feel something that he is not feeling.

Just as some women cannot.    It all depends on the person.    The example you give is somewhat silly indeed.  Apparently, he wants nothing.    In that case, give him nothing until he tells you something.|`|Cf8GBWTkaa	why are you stereotyping males? I am open. I never shut up.    I dont cry much though. I dont have enough estrogen for that but I do open up myself to my girlfriend all the time.|`|KxZN2E2Aaa	it makes them feel feminine and they dont like that feeling|`|ad153b7afea3d1e4c3bb669e8b8bf28faa	some men can ..... maybe your not obvious enough! try being direct.

Let him think what he wants and move on. Concentrate on your education/work/family/friends (I don't know your age-sorry!) and move on. I know it hurts but you WILL get over it, it happens to everyone at some point. My first boyfriend was really cruel to me and contacted me years later on Facebook! Some days he's nice and other days he's really mean for no reason! But I'm old enough now to just ignore him. He's pathetic, much like your ex-partner I assume.|`|MuVKeK8faa	He is just playing mind games with you.  Do not answer his call and move on. Do you really think he was faithful to YOU? He sounds like a player to me.
KPXwwwMMaa	when people ask how you are doing, that's a perfect way to lead into another conversation. Just have an answer ready to go. <br>  <br>  Here's an example:<br>  "How are you?" <br>  (your reply) "Oh, I'm good, but a little tired. I went out to watch that new harry potter movie last night, and got home a little late. Have you ever seen those? I've read all the books. they're really good. etc..."<br>  <br>  Normally you can't get more than a few sentences in a conversation without a response. Just remember to ask lots of questions... and not just one-word answer questions like "how are you?"|`|YzS16M9daa	Hey,<br>  Do you think there is life on other planets?|`|4b67623de920c421c21d4a2a84b84023aa	Do you mean that you wanna mix around and have friends? Well, in order to start a conversation is just start with a " hi" and keep on going. like age, birthday ( maybe birthday turns out the same horoscope and will talk more about it), where he or she live etc.. there is allot of things you can ask... like saying how are you, I sure say fine, ok , good that's all i can say... you will get along I promise! <br>  Good luck!|`|b757ceb4732a43e3be21f65805e76e72aa	"hello"
l9aXZ3poaa	Why should you feel all the guilt?  It takes two to tango!<br>  <br>  Sounds to me like your feelings of guilt are more about what you did than about who you did it with.  Apologising to him won't change that.<br>  <br>  No-one can tell you whether casual sex is morally right or wrong - you have to make that call for yourself.|`|h35ssdmpaa	I don;t think you should apologize if he didn't even care. But if it will make you feel better, then do it to get that out of your head. <br>  <br>  Just learn from this experience, and don't get used, and don't use people, then you won't feel bad. I feel like you should only have sex if you're in a serious relationship, or in love. Then there is no guilt.|`|srAP6Vzvaa	your reaction is very Normal and Common. your not alone in this. just do what u have to in order to Move On.  i hope u feel better|`|1wDkKyLCaa	don't feel bad for him, i'm sure he's not feeling bad as you stated he doesn't respect you.|`|hYZAqeLUaa	you dont need to apologize.<br>  im sure he enjoyed it hah|`|7De8SjDnaa	was he atleast good|`|eLRhPpD6aa	seriously what idiots say you need to be married first its not like the 1950's is it!! just apoligise if u feel bad..but next time consider how u might feel afterwards|`|Ou7Qt3emaa	Why on earth do you want to apologize to him when you openly admit that he never respected nor cared for you before or after the act? That is ridiculous. Also, why would you aplogize for something you BOTH did? I was NOT like you hurt him or forced him to do it. Was this your first time? Either way, if you feel bad then stop doing it with him because you will only hurt yourself emotionally. It is better just to not be active, or please yourself then to be with a guy such for pleasure. Don't lower your standards and you need more self-esteem and respect. I do not think you shoudl apologize because you both are EQUALS in this situation.|`|zfoLTzzuaa	You don't need to apologize to him . You know that he was also using for sex and you were also doing the same thing .

It sounds to me that your struggle is with your own actions.  You won't be able to find acceptance of your choices from another person.  You need to be okay with it - or stop the behavior, on your own.|`|uo4Ky2sfaa	ummm dont apologize.<br>  You need to him that you <br>  regret that. You know everyone <br>  in the whole school is going to know now<br>  so, you better be nice. apologizing just<br>  makes you look stupid.|`|e1J4yrO2aa	you wouldnt feel bad if you were married!!|`|W1aYIF71aa	You should apologize while naked and riding his ****.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	You feel bad about sex? Wth. This all should have been explained before it happened. If you have to do it after its just going to seem like an insult. if you are still his friend and i guess you can let him know you found somebody else. Saying "it was just the right time and right place" to somebody is a slap in the face and they probably wont be your friend. In some cases honesty is not the best policy. "i used you for sex" doesnt go over to well either.|`|m7O5Nyx1aa	You didn't use him hun =)<br>  if you use someone, then they think that you're in a relationship, when really you're leading them on/using them for money, sex whatever<br>  <br>  Maybe you just feel kind of guilty for having sex outside a relationship (not that there's anything wrong with that, as long as you took precautions and its not against your religion or anything) - some people just don't feel comfortable with it, its no problem =)<br>  <br>  hope that helps!<br>  x|`|vkeuaEHiaa	Well the fact that you guys were having sex and weren't even in a serious relatinship...that's a no-no.

1W5tU3R4aa	Sex is sex.|`|kUZEYNmNaa	Anal sex has entered the mainstream in the last couple of decades. There's a few possible reasons one being that its down to porn, the porn industry having only a limited repertoire needs to keep pushing the envelope hence the anal sex s&m etc. Porn is a trillion dollar industry and it does influence even indirectly mens sexual appetites.    Another possible source is the Gay community, Due to gay liberation people became less likely to criticise anal sex because it was seen as being derogatory about the Gay lifestyle. A lot of the hints and tips for having anal sex safely came from the gay community. Nowadays incidentally a large proportion of gay men don't even have anal sex.    So those are some of the possible reasons that your bf wants to bum you.
ipWRgKetaa	I think you're thinking way too much. It is unusual, but not unheard of. When I was younger I usually didn't 'assume' the girl wanted me to kiss her. One of my wife's favorite stories is the fact that I didn't kiss her on our first date. She wondered if I was mad at her or something, which wasn't the case at all. I was merely being considerate....and giving her something to think about. ;o)    But if this really bothers you, ask him. Talking will help a whole lot in that recovery. Why folks don't talk about things like this is something I'll never understand. It is like you believe there is a formula and x + y does not equal z, something is wrong. Love is not a science. Stop thinking and worrying so much and go with the flow. If this sort of thing upsets you and you don't know how to deal with it, I promise you will have much bigger problems in your love life.|`|oNb8RqTEaa	You recover by kissing him the next time you feel you can squeeze it in there.|`|yy45iAbtaa	how did you blow it.did you try to kiss him and he backed off. maybe he respected you that is why he did not try he must of liked you if he took you on more than one date.don't get to upset just waite and see if he calls .do not call him that will surly ruin everything waite for him to call you good luck.|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	Surprise him with an unexpected kiss at the right moment. That will let you know if he`s into you or not.
b6a9a995d901f4cf962d62d2ef5eb525aa	and ur fking question is!?|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	not weird to me. my best friend married a guy 12 years younger who was a grandpa at 26. beat that! He's apparantly a good man who has the capacity to love someone elses child like his own.Have fun with it.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	I think it is great.    So many fathers don`t actually take the trouble to be such an active part in their charges life (son might be too much here).    And yes, to me it does make sense.  He has a caring and loving man willing to be his father.  You should be happy for him.    Just because a 'dad' does not fit into what you thought he would be, does not mean it`s bad :)|`|QMhl2DGQaa	and your question is...?|`|n0cJVKYEaa	do u love your bf? a lot? if u do this is a key opportunity...tel ur bf that his dad is a cool guy. personally i think its sweet of him because he is bonding with his son's mates.|`|eii7o9Poaa	no it isn't really weird. He did a good thing by giving your boyfriend a home and making him his family. I think its cool that he has a parent he can relate to. He must have been devastated for his wife to die so young and maybe he found that adopting a child eased the pain?|`|8UWHeFmIaa	Take what you get! It's kind of weird, but not really!|`|tJ2A8fuTaa	I find it cool... I wish I had a dad like that... My father is always working on something,or building things,and not even when I was young he hardly had any time for me...
4MtR8MLpaa	Does it have to be good or bad? I think it just is and as to judging is good or bad is like asking is pizza good or bad. If both people are comfortable with it and want to do it then go ahead. But if neither wants to, then don't do it.
6EztfzkEaa	Yep, he's droppin hints.  He doesn't want to (or doesn't know how to) ask you out or anything, so he's trying to make sure you know that he is available to get at.      I'm pretty sure he probably thinks you have a thing for him, as either you do or he's misinterpreted something.  Either way, he's thinking his announcement is something of interest to you.|`|gwUMipsUaa	*and* and *conversation*    It means he's interested in you.  But you don't sound interested in him, so he'll eventually find someone else.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	He's expecting you to say something like 'how come? what happened?'|`|dBDxfrLFaa	maybe his asking you out  if it's that and you want to go out with him you can say like would you like me to change that or something like that|`|mHWsuqjZaa	uhm. that he is single? maybe idk it's just a hunch.|`|3694eca278728fd0a36c2ea7419c2fd1aa	Hes tryna imply suming  by saying him saying im single he probs wants you to know he is single or wants a response from u like "oh im single too"|`|19TSkwaKaa	Thats he's single!!!!    Lol    Just reply with. Wooo me too!!|`|cr2KKT6Naa	he wants you to ask him out. so if it dont work its not his fault.  seems to me every hour. he could be single of  not.  he must think he is something else.|`|8rM5W0EBaa	babe he wants you trust me he just wants you to no that he is single. he wants you to make the first move if you like him ask him out what have you got to lose. xx|`|wE2etBzbaa	he just got out of a relationship.  what's hard to understand here? and what's unnatural.    but maybe he means he is single not double|`|ad153b7afea3d1e4c3bb669e8b8bf28faa	that you are the poo....|`|kSWV0tlxaa	he wants you badddddddddddddddddddddddddddd ;)|`|DFSHoO4uaa	well he wants to no if ur single as well, if u want to go out with him just say so am i! see what he says he wants reassurance, now u no the rest is up to u, hope u make the right choice take care!|`|xtrdlyJHaa	It IS kind of an odd thing to say...had he been relating stories about girls he was asking out? If so, maybe he was talking about the success of his last invitation. For example, if a girl moved on to someone else and he had spoken or IMd her the night before, he was trying to get you to open the conversation about what that means so he can talk about girls.     Maybe some friend of him gave him bad advice and told him to say that to you to let you know he was available...and since it didn't work the first time, he tried it again.    Does he do it when you are talking about guys? He might be saying, "helllooooooooo I'm heeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeee!"    I was hoping someone here would have a clue if this is some mystery code...but so far, no luck...hmmm...you may have to do the unthinkable...ask him.|`|ymXa9xe4aa	Wow  u got a lot of hits for this Q: huh    I know this story dont I lol I reakon u should choose the dude: The nature boy o8 as Top answer.....................|`|KxZN2E2Aaa	he wants you|`|Sme8zvmDaa	that he's available?|`|GTT7qFeeaa	he wants to tell u, that he is single, so u get the hint, and might give it a go.|`|MEr99qKraa	he's happy to be single....what r u really trying to find out|`|ngoeL5Rpaa	Darling it means that he doesnt go out with any1 nd he wants u 2 go for him     But there is always a point in askin him coz if he does say yes then you have a bf     if he says no then give him a little more time coz he will be in devestation about his last gf     Belive me xxx     I hope i helped xxx|`|vh0yVJ7daa	He wants to get into your panties|`|d86b2f03db6baf10abae1a77da9c0cb8aa	That he is available and looking.  If you are interested in something more, let him know he doesn't have to be alone.|`|fDhOFwX9aa	A lot of possibilities, could be that he is trying to tell you that he is available again if you are interested. Or he is just too happy that he is single again and enjoying the freedom again.Or maybe he is pretending that he is ok and open with his recent break up. So?|`|U6rCN4R8aa	i'm pretty sure it means hes single|`|trhMszD1aa	that he likes you and is afraid to ask you out
AG3dYL84aa	Too little time to know.  But it might be the case that he just came to ask you a question and was struck by your beauty.    May or may not be the case, but you can dream of it that way if you want.  Sounds like how I met most of my ex girlfriends before I went to university.  Good luck.
hNa5oHxQaa	not at all really.<br>  my cousin is an A cup<br>  don't worry bout it.|`|66e03546d71298a34daadeb6dce02da6aa	If you have great boobs, be happy.  Many girls wish they had what you had.  Yes, guys care a lot about boobs!|`|o6xLWwZvaa	boobs, butt, legs, are big sex appeal for guys. There is nothing you can do about it. Men stare. Live with it.

And the other part, we're pervs.  what else can i say?|`|ajgC0KPhaa	Honestly, you shouldn't have to use all these numbers/letters to describe the size of your chest. Some guys (like me) were probably raised AWAY from knowing these terms.<br>  <br>  Anyways, NO, boobs don't always matter. The people who stare at you when you're walking, are most likely *very nice guys* who don't see any problem with taking a long stare at a total stranger's features. But they would definitely treat you with more respect if you were actually their friend/girlfriend.<br>  Boobs definitely don't matter for people in a serious relationship.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AinzwVQsVwT.H1baqD3FS9Xty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090212210557AAl3UEa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  Thanks.<br>  <br>  .|`|gyixPyOsaa	i was a small c when i graduated high school and had Absolutely no curves. after about 23 i grew to a DD and i have some killer curves. so i bet you will still keep growing. you don't really get your women's body until you graduate. think about it. how many girls in your class have a body of a 30 year old?|`|vivUQkwOaa	Well genetically guys tend to look at stuff like that for better mates or something it's not anything we can help it just is.

And whats more he sounds like a really good guy. The whole friends thing is pretty artificial don't you think? Well he certainly will. I can tell you as a guy that has been in his boots it can make you irrational - hence the complaints about not getting emails from you. My advice is serious and I recommend you take it seriously. It is a bit out there but I think it is perfect for you. Marry him immediately. Yes you heard me. Stop messing about. Life is short and messy sometimes. I get the feeling you like him as well. Marry him, have sex with him, have kids with him. You will never regret it. Nothing is more important
bA5FOMOBaa	Usually you go to a funeral to pay respect for someone you've lost and miss. If you never met him, you shouldn't just go because you're blood relatives. Would it make a difference to your family if you went?<br>  if you want to show respect to the family, send them a card.<br>  if you haven't spoken to them in ages, it could just make the service worse, because everything would be awkward and people wouldn't know what to say. It could just make your day bad too.<br>  do what you think is right.<br>  but if it was me, i would not go.|`|t43nZEkeaa	I am sorry to hear your cousin died....Even tho you never knew himm..but still...<br>  Maybe you should go..just to show your face and show you kind of care...but then again you didn't even know him..so is there any point..??<br>  i would properly go..but if i was you..i would talk to your mum and dad about it aswell..see what they say....<br>  Gurd Luck x|`|niNRqrDkaa	Hmmm..... If I were u i would go. U should go because even though u never met ur cousin, he/she is still from ur family and family members r always close. And if u don't like 2 of ur uncles just don't talk to them. stay by ur self and show sympathy... and u should also go because He was ur cousin....|`|XGPML3Lsaa	dont go, funerals suck :/|`|McJ18CN0aa	Go to the funeral. That'll show you have more maturity than your mother who won't go. And I feel like your cousin would want that. What goes around come around and you wouldn't want someone to debate whether to come to your funeral, would you?|`|R4rjpdKraa	Funerals are for the living. I would only go if your Dad needs your support. If he is fine, then I would definitely skip it.|`|qeVqBMVraa	Go to his Funeral.. give him the last respect even though you two were not close|`|01kEoI0Oaa	that sucks|`|lVGOFmAZaa	I wouldn't go if I were you. It would be different if you did know him, but the fact that you didn't know him would make the funeral awkward. If you need an excuse to not go say you have to go to school for a presentation or something.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	If you didn't even know the guy and your dad is asking for you to go to support him, then you are not required to show. Your mom in no way is obligated at all.
mK4vT8mZaa	woah poor thing that must have been super awkward.    i really think you need to have a serious talk to him about it.    of course...he could also have fallen in love with you, but he's still your cousin.    please talk to him...im so confused as to why he did it!!|`|QMhl2DGQaa	not being funny but how did it feel like i really want to kiss someone so badly not from a cousin|`|zoH6rMCPaa	Your family must be inbreeds|`|IkWcwsj8aa	STOP ASKING THIS STUPID QUESTION!!    YOU ASKED THIS LIKE 10 TIMES ALREADY!!!!|`|bS8Lzb9caa	oh get real!!  he made an obvious bid for you, to show you he wants  you more than a sister, and he was waiting for you to step up and   tell him the same, but you didnt, so he assumed you werent interested  in anything more than a "brother".    forgive him.  he made a mistake.  are you perfect? nope?  then forgive  him.  at least he had the good sense not to push the issue.    if you want anything more from him, now would be the time to let him  know.  you are 12 years apart, and you are not overwhelmingly swept  off your feet by him, so i would say that it working out between you  two would be questionable.    if you dont want any more of these attempts, then tell him you didnt  appreciate the french kiss and not to try anything like that again.    mothers?  give me a break.  you are 33, he is 21 and its time to grow  up, boys and girls.  saying anything to moms will only hurt everyone  concerned.  bad idea, dont go there.|`|1H56FPt8aa	Thats weird. Talk to him about it.|`|3WCONjyfaa	EEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... INCEST!!!!!! GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SICK AND WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|6MHuI3NXaa	ew,  get the hell outa there like now.|`|K8j8MRGwaa	thats sick you LET your cousin kiss you are you ashamed of yourself i think you liked it you freak!!!|`|6iR7Mvc5aa	Hey,you where lucky he was going to **** you and a good **** looking at the time you gave him because 5 seconds  is just too much.Just sit down and talk to him,it being immanuture telling your parents.Some of the things its not always necessary that we have to tell our parents unless he does not listen to what you are saying.Next time,if tries to do that,tell him off without hesiteting.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	I think you should avoid him  that's too disturbing
X7rPWJU8aa	forgiving and forgetting are 2 different things. i always think a person should forgive( forgetting is something we as humans can't seem to do very well). i would tell him and myself that its forgiven. and that it is done and can not be changed. but forgiving don't mean that there is going to be a party in the future where all is well and fine.  forgiving also doesn't mean that the consequences are any different that is not up to you it has to do with the legal system.|`|AA11603468	If my brother killed my husband, I'd probably lose my mind, but to answer your question, no, there would never be any forgiveness on my part.

And btw hypothetical questions are really dumb.|`|IcH5gMICaa	Technically, you would go to prison along with him, because you obviously covered up your husband's murder at the time in order to keep your brother from going to prison in the first place. So unless both of you are ready to take that ride, I think I'd try to live a straight and narrow life and pray God has mercy on BOTH your souls.|`|3gMytPXhaa	Nice story. u have nice creativity try to write scripts for movies. with u good luck.|`|v2a220YWaa	start paying him to kill other people you don't like.
SMecBzPZaa	If you want to marry this man sit him down and talk to him about it. Make sure you get his real feelings on it no matter how hard it could be to hear them. Also don't interupt him or argue. Let him speak his peace. Then after that conversation decide where you two want to go from there. PLEASE DO NOT rush into a marriage if you  both are not ready for it. Because it will only lead to disaster.|`|7ko9czaaaa	aways put your babys frist,and that is a baby someone that will aways love you and care about you and put you frist. this man that wants you to kill it will never do that,|`|S5x6KNHraa	sounds like he is concerned without a job its hard to take care of the baby its a lot of stress marriage is more than likely the last on his list give him space he will come around take care of your baby its a blessing u will love it nothing else will matter when u see your baby he will love the baby everything changes u are young but old enough to manage|`|5uLENOFlaa	LOL|`|OAYaeW22aa	get laid
DS21ekeJaa	Better yet, just pay for your mom to come and visit you! She would probably enjoy the treat of a vacation and you could visit with the one person that truly cares for you and not your bank account from your past.|`|vi4JlnJvaa	I agree with dizzkat!!  It's not like it's selfish, it's self preservation.  I'm in the middle of making the decision of going back home to a seriously messed up alcoholic family who disowned me, but my little brother - who I had to raise - is getting married and wants to "show off" my son whom my family sometimes acknowledges.  I have to protect the both of us from being around them, and you need to protect yourself from any guilt and pain from an absent father and resentment towards the rest of the family.......see where I'm going?  Just fly your mom out and MAYBE one of her friends and have a loving, joyful, stress free time!!<br>  <br>  I wish you well.|`|fc9ecb5a900817a0bcf8f6fa3590baf3aa	Sounds like you have a very greedy family. If none of them call,text or even send you a card for your birthday, then don't bother with calling, texting or anything for theirs. As far as them asking you for money and other things, you are not required to give them anything. You could tell them you don't have any money to spare-a white lie but with leaches like that you shouldn't really care. For your visits go ahead and visit your mom and friends-you are under no obligation to visit everyone else.|`|lXpGlAm3aa	Yes,I would visit Mom and take her out with you.=(I'm sorry that your family doesn't acknowledge your Birthday or the holidays.Sounds like they are so ungrateful.And you train others how you want to be treated.Ever heard of that saying?(ha,I need to take my own advice=)<br>  But,that's not cool.Your not a bank account.|`|cOce5YbRaa	Sounds just like my family. It isn't the fact that I expect something from any of them but at least a phone call would be nice but I am now 47 years old and it still doesn't happen so I don't waste my time on them either anymore. If I was you, I would do just what you said. I would just go back home to see your Mom and your friends and tell your Mom not to tell anyone you are going to visit so you won't be bothered and just flat out used for money and material things when you go visit. My family is the same way. They want this and that and I would always buy it for them and they wouldn't even say thank you. Enough is enough. Family is supposed to be all about LOVE-not using each other for whatever you can get out of them. It's not fair and it hurts. Most of my friends are the same way as my family, only call when they need something or want something so I try to screen my calls now and don't answer most of my calls anymore. Just go see your Mom and treasure what you have with her and your true friends. Forget everyone else. They will still probably find out you are there or have been there but if you can pull off not seeing them, maybe they will learn to appreciate you at least a little bit and maybe won't take you for granted or take advantage of you as much. Good luck and I hope everything works out better for you. This really does hurt-I know!!
AIr5mQ7aaa	When we love someone we want to give them the best. The person I love said she wouldn't mind living in the streets with me, but I love her too much to give her such a life, no way.

No.  You are not emotionally, physically or mentally mature at this age.  As much as it may feel like love, what you are probably experiencing is the rush of hormones that come with puberty and a huge crush.

Well, it is.|`|iTyLs2S6aa	Love is mysterious.....and it works in mysterious ways.|`|Cvlf7arlaa	ita int love, its too early of an age to know what real love is,|`|9xVwpZ0faa	it is a crush|`|svg71dazaa	Yes it's OK but will it last -who knows? A 13 year old is young and things change. I say wait a a bit and enjoy life while you can. Adult life is not as fun as it seems.|`|OAYaeW22aa	its probably a crush|`|l5NzJZ6Zaa	nooooooooooooo  ur so small to get into these things         just cocentrate on ur studies|`|UPfuK18jaa	yes, most people fall in and out of "love" many times before they find the one person they TRUELY love.|`|c0XZx6tuaa	it's perfectly normal !|`|V7jRP00yaa	not at all. you are way to young to fully comprehend love or anything close to it. wait awhile until you're older.|`|jDIaJJDGaa	yeah thats fine      but I doubt its LOVE    probably more a crush|`|y07MGbLcaa	not love little girl, its a crush, you need to be at least 18 to be in love hahaha =]|`|BJwhdvjoaa	absolutly if your sure its love and not just lust go ahead fall in love that every girls dream.|`|dFQSXFfjaa	Yes, but you have to be careful of it.  Since at the age of 13, it is still very young.|`|wohGR1Nkaa	infactuation dear.|`|M0GoGVHXaa	you can be in love at any age, its a feeling only you can describe.. but as 13 is a very young age, and hormones kick in ..kids at that age dont know what there thinking.|`|6EztfzkEaa	Sure, just realize that the type of love you feel right now isn't the type of love that you come to understand when you're older.  If you love someone or something at 13, then you love it.  However, don't get that confused with 'Real Love', because it's not the same.|`|edaf5d2064f28d318ed6f3e11e8b141caa	It's inevitable. In fact, I think I fell in love with the first 5 girls I dated. Then I became 15 and took the feelings for what they were.... a new experience that comes with puberty.    Go with it but try not to make too many bad decisions that will impact you over the long term (ie. getting pregnant, dropping out of school, giving up your friends, doing anything illegal to keep him/dump him, etc.).|`|y2nC8BUGaa	Sure, just don't expect him to be 'the one'.  You can love people all your life and never find the one you're really meant to be with.  Enjoy the feeling while it lasts but don't get too caught up in it.   Everyone changes a lot while they're growing up and you've still got a lot of growing up to do.  By the time you're in 10th grade there's a  very good chance you and he will have nothing in common anymore.  When it's over, move one and fall for someone else.  That's how things go.      Just remember:   NEVER revolve your life around someone else, especially at your age. If you miss out on all the fun things about being a kid just to spend all your time with him, you'll really hate yourself when it doesn't work out with him.|`|KDNrbnZVaa	Puppy love is so precious. You'll likely remember this event the rest of your life, regardless of how long this episode lasts. I'm nearly 51 and remember my first love. As fate would have it. We broke up at 17 and reunited 30 years later. We're still together too!!|`|tX0Iczsaaa	You're 13..  You dont know what love is.|`|IPMr6zEJaa	You may feel like you love someone, but unfortunately, 95% of the time, you'll be over them before you're through high-school, if even that far.|`|N4JUrdbsaa	Well, as I am also 13 (I'm under the assumption that this question is about you) I cannot give the best advice, but I am the one experiencing right now, so let me say this: I truly doubt that you are falling in love at this age, even though it may seem like it. However, if you feel strongly about this person, go for them, just know that you might--and probably will--end up with a broken heart.
bZvlm6G8aa	If you guys hang out with the same people get a friend of his to see what his feelings are for you. so you won't look like an idiot or just talk to him yourself, but don't tell him how you feel just pick around the subject to kind of   see what he's thinking. if he say something about getting back together then you can tell him how you feel.|`|Rn7zkS52aa	well, i think you should just talk to him about it. your feelings are probably pretty obvious so just talking about it would be the best way to go. just tell him you had fun with him the other day and it made you think about the time you had together before. tell him you still kind of have feelings for him and was wondering if he felt the same way and would maybe consider trying again. If you stay calm and get to the point, it should work. Good luck!
vejHKjEDaa	If your home-life was fairly harmonious, before the arrival of your grandparents, don't you think you should talk with them about these issues within a family conference and have a discussion based upon the points you mentioned? It seems your aunt and uncle should be involved so it would be wise of you to first discuss this with them. Ask your sister to be there also - tell her what you're planning to say and ask her to be supportive by verbally agreeing with you.      You need to let your grandparents know that, although it's nice to have them sharing the household with you and the other family members, their negativity isn't a welcome addition to your life, or your sister's.  Tell your grandfather you love him but you don't appreciate living with someone who is critical and complaining - let hijm know it's demoralizing, depressing and stressful for you and your sister and every time he does this, he is lowering your opinion of him.  I would, also, say you believe this is a contagious bad habit and you intend calling this to his attention in the future (tell him, :"You're doing it, again").  You'll need to, also, :lay it on the line" with your grandmother -  It's very unkind to tell me I'll be a failure when I worked hard to be on the honor roll at school - as my grandmother, you're supposed to encourage me to fulfill my goals and I don't want any more negative comments from you or from Pop-Pop because these are  destructive instead of positive. What I've said applies to "Heather" (your sister) as well.  Right, "Heather"? Tell your gransmother, also, "You're doing it, again".      Type a list of your grievances to refer to which includes comments you wish to make in reference to their attitudes  You may, also, want to make copies of a list which has only the subjects for discussion on it.  If you think it's not going too far, (I don't think it is ...) tell them you and your sister were living in an "agreeable household" until their arrival and as they are the newcomers, it's up to them to fall into place with what had been working for the four of you until they arrived. And - as far as household authority goes, to you and your sister, it's your uncle who is in charge.  This isn't being rude/disrespectful as your complaints are legitimate.    I realize you'll be very nervous when considering doing this but it must be done.  Moving out is NOT an option for you - it's allowing them to win the battle and, if you don't stand your ground now, it will be 100 times more difficult for you to do in the future.  We all must face conflicts at various times in our lives and it's healthier to face the conflict and deal with it rather than avoid the issue.  Taking charge when it comes to difficulties is cathartic - avoiding issues of conflict gives anger and bitterness a foothold in your heart and then, you end up being like your grandparents!  Moving out will leave your sister very vulnerable and will, also, cause you to suffer financial hardship so I, definitely, advise against this.    Here are some Bible quotations for you to keep in mind.    Psalm 37:8 - Don't get angry. Don't be upset; it only leads to trouble.  James 1:19-21 - Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.    Try to have your thoughts organized and approach this as a business meeting.  If they become angry and won't discuss your grievances, you may need to shun them to protect yourself from their emotional abuse.  I'm sorry your life has been disrupted by this situation and hope all works out well for you and your sister.    Are your grandparents working?  If not, are they actively seeking employment?  Has one, or the other, considered going to night school?  Many courses are offered at little or no charge.|`|l5NzJZ6Zaa	i think u should talk to them about how u and ur sister feel                    i think being ur grandfather he would ur feelings|`|SnQvsOPwaa	There is nothing you can do about your grandparents. Go to college if your able. If it's really that bad and you leave make sure you still see and support your sister. When you leave all the crap will be directed her way. I left when I was 17 and my younger brother viewed it as i abandoned him. So try to remember to build up and support  your sister.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Why did they move in?   Whose house it it?  I'd move.|`|7ko9czaaaa	move and take your sister with you,|`|V49nP5ZHaa	sound like My grandparents they don't live with me but i always have to see them, every time i see them my nan says im anorexic and i need to put on weight and it really upsets me, i come form a really skinny mum and i just follow in her genes  so it is not my fault,  i reckon as your old enough o move out you should give it a go and take your sister with you then they will see how much they have hurt you. and then if you want it is up to you whether you move back in or not,|`|ReH5EoR0aa	I'd say time to move out with your sister.   You will be making your own life, and that is healthier.       You can always go back later if they leave.      Unfortunately, oldsters get that way sometimes, (drugs cause chemical and personality changes)  and that negativity is not healthy to be around.      That is great you are an honor roll student!   You seem very capable and should do very well on your own.
oeCIzoF9aa	They are all about "black pride".  It's really stupid.  They look at color as if it's a big deal.  If they can have a black history month, then we should have a white history month, right.  Well not according to them.  This is why we have the KKK, because blacks are so racist!|`|T8ksKCWCaa	racism is not just for whites you know|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	I am sorry you have had to experience that. As someone with a very diverse family it makes me sad to see it happen. It could be the part of town you are in, or even the city. When I was in Kansas it was very acceptable and extremely common to see a variety of couples. Where I am now people get stared at for it. It hard to say exactly why because there are several reasons why it's disliked. Very sad indeed in this day and age.....Love is love.....|`|AA10294903	Ive seen the type of white women that black men date.|`|Mt3KpoxOaa	They are jealous.

But black men don't want them hoes.|`|VEi3R0craa	They always say all good black men leave for women of another race.  Well I am puerto rican and my husband is black.  my sister in law was okay with us dating but when she found out that he wanted to marry me she flipped talking about her brother is to good and he needs to be with a black woman and how all good men leave black women.  But I took her to the side and told her if she was not in my relationship so much maybe she could find a man who was not kicking her ***.  Now I am tired of people asking me if my kids are mixed and last time my daughter had me dieing.  My husband took our 13 year old and our 3 month old to the doctors and a lady said you have beautiful kids are they mixed and he said yes half human and half German Sheppard.  Don't worry about the looks do what you do.|`|83TkWic3aa	Why does it matter? White people are snickering at you too honey- whites just aren't obvious about it. Racism is stupid, love doesn't know color or religion, and until people see that love isn't bound by color, things will always be said.|`|WP36jh6Zaa	WHY?... because his mothers black..<br>  <br>  9 chances out of 10 she took all she had to raise him into a strong black man FOR a strong black woman. so its not tht we care anything about you, we're disappointed in him. We work hard to make our race a better race & we feel he failed us.<br>  <br>  and dnt think u have somthing great, when surveyd, most blk guys say the reason theyre with a white woman is because the dnt "tlk back" (voice their opinion) and do any and everything theyre told without question...<br>  <br>  so if this is ur husbands view, u can have him.. a black woman wouldnt want him anyway.|`|RZl7aPxnaa	I will tend to tell the facts, as some people may not like to hear the truth. but blacks are raciest more than any other race. as they do not like to see a black and white together. but this is the facts of how things really are.|`|8PmgWto5aa	I don't get mad. I get mad mostly at the the white girl though. Not the black guy. Black guys will date anyone.|`|AA12320776	jealousy..it doesn't bother me.

That doesn't happen to often in these 'black women' world. So all this time has passed and there just to the point where they don't like to see any white women with black men period.  <br>  <br>  I'm sure that there are more white people that stare and make comments. Its just less obvious and quieter.<br>  <br>  I'm a black woman and all I've ever dated is white men because that's my preference. So I know where your coming from.<br>  <br>  As far as the comments that I've read there are more ignorant people out there than what I thought there to be.
dHID1XDoaa	Oh wow. That sucks he found out you like him :\. But life goes on I guess. But for the conversation thing just ask him about the homework. Tell him to explain it to you even if you get it. Actually ask him what he's doing. Like "So what are you doing?" And usually he actually says what he's doing. And don't come back with "oh," because it will go back to awkward. And ask what he's doing after whats up. If you do it before whats up it will seem just like whats up. But you dont want that. Hopefully I helped. (:
W0KQTXrvaa	don't have sex until she will do the first move|`|b26NgqOFaa	Ignore her.|`|CCFhjtNBaa	This is just the way she is. You could try the approach another poster said, kiss her and then back off and see if she comes after you. But really your just going to have to accept it|`|IF95rI2aaa	Looks like you may have to hold out until she makes a move! If you dont keep initiating it, then she may come around. Good Luck|`|pDptioSNaa	Maybe her wanting you needs your own particular brand of loins !|`|F4d89iRMaa	****. I wish my husband initiates! I love sex and I love initiating so there's no problem there with people who likes to! Now, since she doesn't want to there's really nothing YOU can do. I've tried this talk with my husband too and it sucks. So, I feel ya pain =/. Ask her why she doesn't want to and then go from there. Does she not feel confident enough to initiate it? Questions like that can get the ball rolling. Well, Good Luck!!|`|OntO6wE4aa	Try teasing her. Don't just find her in the mood then go at it. Get her going then act like you weren't intending to have sex. Make her play the game with out her knowing she's playing. If she knows she probably won't want to act. Make it a game. You might find alot of fun it. good luck|`|AA11961759	Just wanted to let you know I am in the same boat.  Her idea of initiating is saying "So do you wanna do it?"  and then just lay there until I make the first move.   Like you I don't mind most of the time to start things but love it when she comes on to me.  I have been battling this for over 7 years.  She does not think that it is her place to start things.  "That is a man's job"   So no matter how I beg, or wait (I have waited a month and nothing) or try to compromise or pray, NOTHING works.  That is her personality and she WILL not change for me.  That is just something she is not willing to do for me, it is not in her personality.  So you have to decide how much of an issue it is going to be in your marriage and whether or not it is worth the aggravationn.
skFguzQWaa	Oh girl I am in the same situation. I know what you are going through and when this other guy finds out someone else wants you he is more than likely going to start texting calling and being so sweet to you, this happens to me with the guy I know all the time. He gets mad cause he didn't show me any affection until i found someone else and now he is all over me. I ask a question almost like yours and one answer I got said I would waste my whole life waiting on the other one.|`|e8Nz2jiraa	It does always seem that the one you want doesn't want you and the one you don't want loves you like crazy. I think a lot of people have this problem and all I can tell you is to follow your heart and don't start something new with one person before you finish something old with the last person.|`|JNc4Xzfgaa	ha, that's how it always is. it's human nature to want what you can't have & push away people that want you. make up with the guy you really like, you won't regret it. you'll just constantly think about the guy you really like if you're with anyone else.|`|sCCjAKllaa	It sounds like they're just telling you what you want to hear. I don't think you should put too much stock into it, though.|`|Zjjl7hrOaa	looks like both of these guys just want to get in your pants...a guy that dosnt take u out isnt serious with you and a guy that talks about marriage when you recently met is a idiot

You will never move on with someone still hanging around in your life.|`|vp4xjqbLaa	Maybe he too is going through some hard to deal with feelings.<br>  Its like all of a sudden you have to stop feeling and acting a certain way about someone you once were in a relationship with .<br>  And he probably felt a little frustrated about you logging on and off msn<br>  i mean its isn't such a big deal just a little annoying.<br>  Send him a very sincere msg if that is how your communicating and explain again that you were in a strange mood that day and it wasn't anything to do with him and you regret taking it out on him.<br>  Tell him how much he means to you as a person( a friend) and so on<br>  if he still isn't satisfied then just leave it be.<br>  You can only do so much to get him to be your friend ...don't force it or it wont be genuine on his part. GOOD LUCK !|`|jIkaapKQaa	Stop being a baby honey.  Don't you know that it's not possible to be friends with an ex after a break up?<br>  <br>  Learn to be without him for a while, and when you no longer feel the attachment in him then that's the time to be friends.<br>  <br>  For now, it's obvious you haven't gotten over him, so stop kidding yourself.

4JrDGW7Taa	After 42 years of a happy marriage I am of course an advocate of a long-term relationship. But let me warn you that it takes a lot of back and forth, controversy and compromises to reach that stage. For to get along with another human being you will not be able to get your way most of the time. Everyone has a different idea on how to live their lives.<br>  <br>  What you need to look for is likeness. The more you are alike your partner, the easier will it be to get along. Read more about relationships that are successfull in the book recommendation in my source.<br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.compatiblelives.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.compatiblelives.com/</a>|`|sVNWdW50aa	You are young and have been with him since you were just kids. It's only normal to outgrow this relationship and want to move on. I do believe that it's possible to be with one person forever and to be happy. Not that you are always happy, no one ever is. You can't throw away a great relationship for fleeting happiness. Only you can decide if you have outgrown this relationship and are only there because it is familiar and comfortable, or if you two really have what it takes to be committed to each other forever.|`|93ix6nyvaa	Your doubts are completely normal. You guys are both still so young, and there are still so many things in life that's forthcoming. Every single person has a different mindset when it comes to various things, and it's neither right nor wrong. In the perfect world, I definitely hope to be faithful and hope my other half is faithful to me forever, but nothing is predictable in this world. Just live for the moment and let things flow naturally.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	Your first and last questions are phrased differently.  Yes, you can stay forever and be happy.  Is it possible to stay faithful the whole time, maybe not but if you stay anyway then c'est la vie.  Life isn't perfect just roll with it.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Yup, I believe it's true that you can be happy.  <br>  <br>  Whoring yourself out won't make your boyfriend propose any sooner...Just a thought.|`|9yurQ85Eaa	I'm not much older than you, but I've been with my hubby for 6 years and I can't imagine my life with out him. It's different for every one when your that young.|`|wia9SXCPaa	Yes its possible.  But, the statistics say its not likely.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Your doubts are telling you something. It IS possible to be happy with one person forever. But it has to be the RIGHT person. Yes, relationships get old, the person your with gets old, the same thing day in and day out gets old. BUT if you are with someone who you truly love, admire and respect the love you have for them never gets old. People who are with their "soul mate" know what I'm talking about.<br>  If you are feeling like you are missing out, than I think it's a good idea for you to get out there an experience different people before you commit yourself.|`|zL1sggpCaa	So, you're playing house and you didn't bother to get his last name??<br>  <br>  I'll never understand why women will move in with their boyfriend THEN talk about marriage and then accept the whole "I'm not ready" as a response... Why should he marry you when you're living like husband and wife? Without getting married that is... You're living together and playing house, sleeping in the same bed, cooking, cleaning.... I do all that and then some for/with my HUSBAND. <br>  <br>  Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free...|`|KRE5oflKaa	Your doubts come from living together without being committed in a marriage first.  Its seen alot when people live together without being married.  Stats indicate that the vast majority of people who live together first do not last forever.  They are separated, broken up, divorced within 5 years if they make it through the first.  <br>  <br>  Good luck though.|`|AA10447831	If you still want to date, do it now. Tell him you want  a break. I have been married 34 years and never really want to go elsewhere though. Fantasy is one thing but the reality is another. Marriage is not easy. We have worked at it and both are content and happy.|`|ymWkGqm7aa	I feel the same as you so PLEASE let me know when you find the answer!|`|J74Y5LKxaa	I think that your love changes and evolves over time.  People who have been married for 10,15, or 20 years do still love each other,  but not the same way they did during their 1st year of marriage.  To honestly think you're going to be MADLY in love for the rest of your life and make tender candle-lit love three times a week is just setting yourself up for a LOT of disappointment later on down the road.  Eventually I think compatibility becomes more important than passion, since passion eventually wears off.  Sad, but true.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	It is possible to stay with one partner for life.  Your doubts are normal, in a way, but I do honestly think you should probably test the waters.  Sample a few other fish.  If you think you might have to struggle with "what might have been" with other people throughout the course of your marriage, you may not be happy.  Although no marriage is 100% happy all of the time (marriages take work, and stuff happens!), I do think it's important to know for sure, going in, that you truly feel certain that you would be content to spend the rest of your life with just this one person.<br>  <br>  Edit: It's kind of tangential to the question you're asking, but user Beatngu (above) raises an excellent point with which I agree 100%.  Of course, I am the father of 3 daughters so maybe I'm prejudiced, but I think girls need to watch out for themselves more than you are.
zTiaGyuMaa	I am an adult now, but when I was a teenager I had the same problem. My mother and I don't get along at all. She is not an easy person to get along With. I had a eating disorder since I was 14 on and off. I had to confide with someone else other then my mother. I knew I couldn't keep trying with her cause she did not want to try with me. It sounds like you want help. You should be proud of yourself. Only you can make a positive change. If she doesn't want to be there you have no choose but to do it without her.  Do you have a friend or a teacher you can trust.    Good Luck! I have been where you are and I know it is tough.|`|mN9AUoDjaa	I would write her a little note or send her an email.  Tell her exactly what's wrong and can you see her about it.  Sometimes people get so busy with surface things they dont see whats underneath.  You may be surprised at your mum's reaction - she will probably be much more sympathetic than you think.  Dont worry about the ups and downs of a mother-daughter relationship at your age - its normal.  Wait and see - in a few years time you will be on a different level of your relationship.  She is your mother and the only one you will have, and you are her daughter.  Good luck.  (And try and get your head around the eating disorder - it makes you cranky and a grouch !)|`|VdaQ2Vo0aa	Wow.  I felt like I was reading about my mother. I know my mother would blame me or say it's not that big of a deal or make it about her.    If it were me I would talk to a counselor or a teacher. They can steer you in the right direction and get you the help you need.    As far as your mother you will have to tell her at some point so I would enlist the help of a family member who knows "the way she acts".  They can help be the buffer and give you support.
Haa3KJxZaa	It should be 4-door, 4-cyls, not sporty. I would prefer Honda or Toyota... First time drivers usually have much more expensive car insurance, and it depends from car. You should compare insurance rates while choosing the car - for example here - carinsurance.yoll.net|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Good luck .. we all look for the great car from time to time ....

Give him some space and he'll probably come around.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Dear child, what he's wanting is to fool around with someone else and not have to feel guilty about it. No man with both test!cles leaves his girl with plans to come back later unless he's looking elsewhere. Sorry.|`|ip7mlDmDaa	Girl, I think he is just letting you go easy, I think he is moving on he is not coming back to you, don't be surprised if there is someone on the side, but give him time and space and see, but have room for disappointment, if he is back its a bonus for you then enjoy! either way be happy remember love yourself first.|`|BJwhdvjoaa	Im a guy and i've heard my friends use that line too many times I think he's playin you for a fool.

3AAJqErnaa	I am going to be very superficial because I want to be at this moment:    I love the tortured soul type. The one who battles with his emotions over life and the state of the world, the struggling artist striving to find his feet and his place in the world. The writer, actor or poet who feels so deep he become an introvert to try to capture the essence of life.    I like Gothics and mystics types.... guys who don't like the heat and the sun... and who love the cold.....|`|flqAr30laa	the single ones.  the ones who can hold down a job, the ones who are humble, the ones who treat his family and friends in a kind manner, the one who doesnt have to think twice about doing the right thing and the man who can keep his word.|`|WWNWtzvDaa	a guy that has a pulse =)|`|YyFexhd3aa	?|`|m7O5Nyx1aa	funny  good taste in music (doesn't have to be the same taste as mine, as long as its decent =P)  good taste in clothes  likes my taste in music/clothes  easy to talk to  doesn't judge me (or if he does, loves me anyway =P)  slightly random (comes under easy to talk to, cos im slightly random too)  Good looking helps too :) but it doesnt have to be goodlooking in the traditional sense  Gives good hugs :)|`|HQ1t2ayLaa	I would like a guy that have respect for others.

Better way if u spend more time with them , tell some jokes to your mother, speak to your dad about what happened in your school, do chores, be busy and interactive =) Love your parents, if you didn't have them you would not even be able to access the internet..|`|BZ8Rlp9uaa	Good grief, your parents must have blown their tops off about your dude if they're acting like this to you. I would suggest that you just talk to them about it, say how annoyed you are and ask them to cut you some slack! :)|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	First - calm down.    Then, when you are calm - talk with them.  Be reasonable, and ask why they seem so panicked.  If nothing happened - there is no reason to.  Ask them how they expect you to have a social life, if you cannot talk with your friends, see them outside school.    Yes, they will argue you are just 15 - but then how would you learn to grow up, if they don`t let you make some mistakes? Because, that is how people learn.     Getting angry will work counterproductive, so hence the 'calm' bit.    Ask them what you need to do for them to allow you to see friends, talk to the 16 year old etc. If you believe something to be unreasonable, explain WHY you think this is (btw - the arguement 'just because' or 'it`s just unfair' will not make any kind of impression).    Most parents can be reasoned with - provided you do this respectfully, and you show you have actually thought this over.  Explain also that the controlling and picking up at school is making you uncomfortable, and other kids at school are making it hard (commenting on being daddies little girl etc.).     Maybe you can ask them how they did it around your age (but that could end up being a sermon).    Lastly - make sure you TAKE the time to have the talk. This will not be done in 4 or 5 minutes.

Like a car wreck.<br>  That's only because if they had a wreck or something and they didn't have a will, you might have to go in a foster home with strangers.<br>  Your parents are going to be OK. They are also very smart for making the will and very lucky that you love them so much.<br>  Maybe you should tell them what your fears are and they can put you at ease.|`|R04XOC5Uaa	You really shouldn't worry about this subject. The more you think about it the worse it will become. Your parents have gone their entire lives without becoming seriously injured as far as I can tell. I'm sure they will be fine.

Your parents weren't making their will you to scare you, they were planning ahead which was a brilliant thing to do.<br>  They just want to be prepared for when the time comes.<br>  Now,  Talk to them. Tell them how you feel. I freak out completely when my parents talk about dying too... so i know how you feel.<br>  Just relax, it's not going to be for a while okay.<br>  Talk to them. Otherwise, if you need anymore help or someone to talk to, you can always talk to me. <br>  Email me whenever you need a friend.<br>  I don't know how old you are, but I'm 16, just so you know, so I'm not some  creeper! ;)

Rn7zkS52aa	I would talk to him about how you feel, and he should want to make plans with you! Not 24-7 connected at the hip kind of thing, but he should be into hanging out with you..and it doesn't seem like he is. He shouldn't be apathetic all the time about hanging out with you! It obviously bugs you, and who could blame you. If you talk to him, and he still doesn't put in the effort, he may be into you..but he's way more into his family, friends, video games...and all that stuff.|`|g1hqC0zEaa	This might seem bad but maybe he just needs time alone. But if he has never ever made an initiative to ask you out to see you then maybe something is wrong with him. I would ask you to go ahead and talk to him about this before it gets bad. Communication is good and it helps.|`|UAuSVBelaa	I had that problem with my ex, it was eating away at me and every time i would say im not asking him or arranging things but i would give in cause i wanted to see him but he simply was just not that into me
7ko9czaaaa	run like hack something is wrong with people that thank like that and you or someone you love could be next,run move get out of town,,,,|`|VdaQ2Vo0aa	Yes, serial killers cannot physically or mentally stop their actions.  They are a product of their emotions or lack of them. They kill to fulfill a hole inside themselves. You have to be a very sick person to want to stay with a person that can take a life for no good reason.    I am a criminal justice major and have had to study and write papers on why serial killers commit the crimes they do. Take a look at the book "Psychology of Criminal Conduct".  It explains why people commit crimes.|`|S4QBvAaGaa	Well, I haven't killed anyone so we'd really have nothing in common...  I value life too much to be with someone who can find it so easy to destroy it. It's not up to me to forgive them. it's up to me to accept them and that I cannot do. If they wouldn't surrender, I'd turn em' in.  Good Luck! :)|`|AA11108018	I would not trust or befriend that person no matter what they claim|`|ifC1aFHxaa	I'd tell them to surrender to the police. There are families out there that desperately want closure on these tragedies and a "vow never to do it again" just isn't good enough.  Regret and repentance are a good start, but now would be the time to talk about atonement and restitution.|`|AA11307468	Even if that person is truly reformed, he needs to pay the consequences for his actions.  I would immediately turn him in and cut off all contact.|`|N3U7xWAPaa	if they are ever caughyt you will be charged as well . its a  crime to not tll the police about it its like you are a serial killer too . murder is murder and its a federal crime . its not worth risking your life ,

hoBREUGLaa	The only way to find out if she feels the same way about you is to ask her. The worst thing you can try to do is try to make a move before you know if she's even interested. Also, there's nothing worse than trying to kiss someone and getting slapped in the face =). If you think you have the balls to make a move on her, you should also have them to ask her how she feels first.|`|VVbZzAVLaa	Hold her hand|`|xsvDrtrRaa	first things first... ask her what she thinks about you.. then after getting whats her answer you decided what you will do. its all in your hands..|`|KT0UTX8taa	IF YOU REALLY LOVE HER....

Ask her.     You don't want to ruin the friendship if she doesn't like you in that way.|`|L1bLe24qaa	If it's long time, what did you notice? do you think she has the same feeling and think about you in the same way (like you but wait for your move). any inductions from her side? this would help but even if she didnt show any feeling about you, you should do the first move if you are truly love her.    Its only about the right wording. Be direct & honest. Short but efficient    Like:   I want to talk to you in person (in safe place). Look at her eyes for a moment. Lady, I love you. The thing is that I respect you, like the way you do every thing and want to keep the friendship for ever but found my feeling goes beyond this and fall in love with you. Plz dont response now, just think about it and whatever your decision is, I will accept it and respect it as a part of my love to you.

I would suggest a Casserole, They are very easy to make, feed quite a few people, and are Very good to eat. I would suggest something that most people like. say hamburger stroganoff, chicken& rice etc. That will be a big hit with him and his family.

I think love should be shown every day! a simple phone call, saying I am thinking of you, or a little note in the lunch bag or briefcase,   Wouldn't like any of these done for you? Most people would say yes, and my thinking is, if it is something that would put a smile on my face then why not do it for someone I care about
POJNnWhDaa	Not fat!!!!<br>  Someone who is in good shape says to me: I care about my health, and my appearance. I have the determination it takes to get in good shape and stay that way. It reflects on what kind of person they are in general.<br>  <br>  Someone who is NOT in good shape says the exact opposite. If you are not one of the rare medical cases that cannot lose weight for various reasons, then the only reason you are fat is because you are not motivated enough to do what it takes to lose the weight.<br>  <br>  edit: I take responsibility for my own slight pot-belly. My arms are in good shape from weight lifting, but I don't do enough cardio and I can't lay off the cookies, so I have a slight beer gut going on. I could lose it in a few weeks if I had enough motivation, which I don't, and I accept that. I wish all the fat chicks out there would take responsibility as well, and stop blaming "genes."|`|7e4jxj3Daa	Hot legs!|`|C7CaNLGlaa	It's usually a quick succession of eyes, face, then hair.

I didn't say BIG breasts... just breasts.  If it looks like she's shoplifting a pair of watermelons its actually a turn-off, no mater what the media tells you.<br>  <br>  Athletic body, or slightly chubby.  Yes, chubby can be totally cute on a girl... unhealthy and too skinny isn't attractive at all.<br>  <br>  Nice skin... If you're white, this means no tanning!  Nobody like dried out, crispy-cardboard skin from the tanning beds.  Other than that, just clear healthy skin... the color of it doesn't much matter... though I'm partial to really pale girls.<br>  <br>  Nice wardrobe.  A girl doesn't have to be wearing heels and a skirt all the time... in fact, I prefer girls who dress like tomboys, with cargo pants, hoodies, etc... but make sure your outfit really matches, and that its clean and fits.|`|VkzmH1GKaa	Hair, eyes, smile, and then her voice.|`|Un9CElCaaa	i like tall brunettes|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	-Short ( I'm 5'5'' and I think girls taller than me find my height a turn off)<br>  - Curvy, don't find skinny girls attractive generally.... <br>  - busty, I didn't realize it until recently, but all the girls i have been with have been at least a C-cup... i must subconsciously be attracted to big breasts) <br>  - I tend to like tanned girls<br>  - I favor brunettes, but i also like redheads a lot, and blonds of course. <br>  - Obviously she can't be ugly... i tend to prefer cute and sweet over sexy. <br>  <br>  But then again I've been with girls that didn't have a lot of this... so this is only ya very rough idea...<br>  <br>  Really, and i know you don't care, personality is key.

No worries, obviously it must be a misunderstanding. I am pretty sure he has heard of Twilight by now. If not...he should. lqtm. If he wont listen to you for any reason, try giving him a clue then...like somehow getting across to him to look into the movie called "Twilight"...or researching it heh. Or! I am pretty sure you can find a way to talk to him personally. Have you told his friends of what you meant? They should know that the Twilight series is pretty big amongst females. Be assertive! Take action! Don't let anything stop you from obtaining the things you desire...unless they are bad for you lqtm. (laughing quietly to myself).|`|qUDas0R4aa	well try to explain it to him in a few days or so. or explain it to one of his friends and tell them how much you really like the guy and that you werent cheating on him. Thats just your way of saying hes great or whatever. It's not like you said "Oh your so great, you remind me of this guy EDWARD" I mean if you refered to him as an edward than explain to him or his friends that its like that book twilight or something (ive never read them myself so I have no idea what u mean by that) Say its like how some people refer to square people as melvins just to set up an analogie to it so he understands, and say like how I would call a great guy like you an edward. But that sounds almost feminine he must be very sensative. No offence.|`|g7M1DxFCaa	Maybe you could highlight the sections in the books and post them with a letter to him, so he'll see he's being silly?  At least you didn't call him a Richard.|`|QSodlfMraa	wow, you could talk to his friends and ask them to talk to him for you, sorry for that girly.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	Ha Ha, Wow. I can't believe this situation!<br>  If you're in school you need to set him aside and explain to him that Edward is a perfect, fictional character and all.<br>  If you're out of school, you need to go to his work & suprise him & explain things.<br>  <br>  I know you're trying to be sweet but those books tend to make people a little crazy. tell him that he's your _______. whatever his name is, and that you think he is perfect in everyway so much that it is unreal, like with the book, twilight. :]|`|KhGkc2QGaa	Guys don't like to be compared. It's a simple fact. They want to know that they're the #1 boy in your life. Of course, most guys hate the twilight series, so comparing him to some super-human character probably made him a bit upset. Just wait a bit until the whole thing blows over. I'm sure he'll get over it in a few days. Don't bother him too much right now. Let him get all his emotions out.|`|vKmzcZZvaa	Interesting. Mine gets offended because I call him a dick_head.|`|8SKpsVG7aa	You told me you didn't have a boyfriend
iPNOVR6Gaa	There is nothing wrong with having a minimum level of expectations for people with whom you have friendships.  One of the reasons I chose the friends I chose was because they are good and honorable men.  So are you saying that I am not a good person because I don't keep any dishonorable scum bags as friends?  I hope you're not saying that!    But that's what you're saying about yourself, that if you give up friendships with bad people it makes you a bad person.  No, it doesn't - it makes you a wise person!  You asked, "Will leaving a friend in times of need be good even if she did you wrong things?"  The answer to that is a resounding YES!|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	once a friend betrays u, its best to cut all ties with that person, u seem to be so focused on helping others, and maybe u need to think about yourself. when your seeing someone and in a relationship, keep others out of it, and maybe u need to take a good hard look at the men your allowing into your life.|`|1cfd872dd5ef0781fe0d37b36f1027faaa	a friend wouldnt do those things 2 u.i think u need new friends|`|sB9xp8wraa	Fools never listen to advice.|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Ok then ... Your too trusting ... A true friend won't hose you like that.  A good choice in boyfriend material won't leave you for a friend ....  Ya gotta remember alot of the drama your suffering from comes from the age bracket of folks your dealing with.    Face it... the high school set isn't done learning or growing yet ... and most have little social grace ...     Choose a better ...well at least older set of people who value you and your input as a friend. If the people your associate with trust, value and like you they won't hose you over.    And try to choose a "BF" who cares about who you are and not you cup size.    Happy Hunting .... get out of the kiddie pool to do you fishing !|`|qxgkhN8aaa	Hi Xena, is me again and I would like to suggest a comment from jude,  that is , she said that, next time when you do have a b/f you leave it out  and not to introduce him to your friends, but my conscience tell me not to bother about it, as in a deeper level, you'll need to find out exactly whether   your current b/f is really falling in love with you.  If he leave's, shame on him for dumping you and you really don't need those  scumbags, do you ?  And this jerks totally got no guts and is not worth all your time to actually spend on them, for , if they at least happen to discuss their new found  relationship with your friend in hand, I'm sure things can be better handled,  but no, their doing all this things at your back and I simply couldn't take it,  I mean, what am I, a GARBAGE ? No , right ? So no worries for all who dump you and keep on the spirit and always be alert and if someone really dump you,  you have to always tell yourself that is their LOST, and not yours, OK ?    And for the advise that you're giving your friends for, I'll suggest that, since  their so smart to prick and dig your b/f for themselves, so you should just tell them that their smart enough to handle their own problems and simply say that you're not in a position to give them advise anymore and this will   save you a lot of time to look for a much much better b/f.|`|SMecBzPZaa	You are letting your "friends" walk all over you and you know it. I know it is hard to walk away from someone who you thought was a great friend but this person has stabbed you in the back and didn't think twice about doing it. You need to walk away from these people no matter how hard it is and Surround yourself with people who love you. Hang out with you family or try to meet new people at work. A real friend would not treat you like garbage by stealing your boyfriend. Real friends would look at you and no matter what stand by you and never cross that line. So please stand up for yourself and walk a way from them. It will hurt and it will be hard. And I guarantee they will give you guilt trips but plug your ears and keep walking. Do it for yourself. When the dust settles and you have new and better friends you won't be sorry. Good luck. I will keep my fingers crossed for you.

Well, I love my kids dearly but condone NONE of the above actions, so my first step would be to pray and ask God to show me where I could be stepping up more to fill the obvious voids in my child's life. Then I would talk to my child personally about that and hopefully have a calm and open conversation about it and see what my child needs from me.<br>  Then as much as it sucks for you, I would have to enforce so major boundaries -this is done for the child's safety. These boundaries would basically be the equivalent of being grounded, but I would be using this time to strengthen our relationship with one another and to help my child find fulfillment in good things as opposed to dangerous things. My child would be performing chores or getting a job, and would not be allowed out of the house for a period of time. This in addition to any other logical consequences that would need to be determined case by case.<br>  And lastly, counseling. My child is more than likely going to need a third party to talk to, so I would ensure that while I did the first three things, my child had a counselor to help them sort through these issues.
5JAy0fucaa	No, because us guys in general don't understand what women want or how they think! We pretend we do because it's cooler. <br>  So in fact if you play hard to get - most guys think that you aren't interested and just stop pursuing you. It's the safer option because if it turns out that you actually aren't interested then we would technically be classed as stalkers if we continue to chase after you!<br>  It is really hard trying to work out whether a girl likes us or not!<br>  From the above you might be able to understand why this sort of thing confuses us and drives us crazy and annoyed!<br>  You can act mysterious but don't go hot and cold, leading us on and then ignoring us or toy with us (which playing hard to get is).<br>  I personally don't like mind games because it makes me think that people are hiding things.|`|qKpgMkjSaa	I'm sorry I have to disageree with the other guys, it would and  it has made me work harder to get the one I wanted, which in turn showed how much I cared = good relationship.

It seems like he likes you..because he is always talking to you, and wants to make you laugh. so probably. maybe hint that you should hang out someme and see his reaction is he looks really excited about it, then he probably does. but if he makes up an excuse really fast..then no.<br>  he probably does..go with ur instinct!|`|HyKmB5jmaa	He like you because he try to make to laugh and he talks to you.

Dump him honey, you wil feel so much better when you do :)|`|AA11841749	You can't pressure someone to do that.  That's mean and unfair.

Before we moved in I lived at my parents and he lived on his own. I really wanted us to move in together, but he was totally against it. I had the same problem where he said I was "pressuring" him. My boyfriend was thinking about moving to a new apartment and then just out of no where asked if I wanted to move in. I think that it's just going to take some time for him to move towards the commitment you are looking for. I know it's hard to wait for him to stop being a slow poke, but it's worth it! Maybe moving out of his parents and in with you is too big a step for him. Try getting him to think about moving out on his own first.|`|zeFUwg6Zaa	Some guys have exactly that problem, fear of commitment. It sounds like both of you want different things out of your relationship. Is there a big age difference, if not then maybe you just too much out of him. <br>  <br>  If he still lives with his parents, then i assume that he doesn't feel financially secure to move out and start a new life. I am sorry to say that perhaps what you want is not going to happen as long as he is dependent of other people. Moving out with your girlfriend is a tremendous step from living with parents...especially for guys|`|lYjweuZmaa	sounds like you answered your own question. you know what you want so you need to go ahead and find your life partner. no matter how much you want this guy to be it i dont think he is from the way you described. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|kl1kzlzXaa	Sounds like you're not that compatible right now...

I would probably find someone who is on the same page as me.|`|5IO1JEY1aa	Sounds like your dating a big kid.  Guys mature so much slower than girls do.....Were so immature!|`|6fa2568b75c06da2670c61858c9441ceaa	Most marriages where people lived in beforehand end in divorce.<br>  <br>  So maybe your boyfriend is doing the right thing.<br>  <br>  Or he might just not want to live with you that badly. Stop pressuring him, you won't magically change his mind. If you don't like it, break up with him.
QUmqfjSuaa	yeah, that means you really care for them.|`|Ypm0OMXnaa	of course! it means u care for your friend, and like spending time iwth them so much that you feel you're missing out when you aren't spending time with them. always a good sign. cheer up :)|`|KzDwZfLBaa	I do. I have met an amazing girl when I was to London, but I had to come back to France and then we stopped seeing. Sometimes I think of her, she was the most kind girl ever!|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	enjoy the day|`|BaNrweQ4aa	yeah i hate it when you organize something; and things get in the way of your plans and you can't meet anymore. things like that annoy me so much; and i do end up getting a bit down but hey... there's always another time or another day right? :) why don't you text them first? show them how much you care :)

But when I'm single I like to call girls I'm flirting with Baby too.|`|CyWEam38aa	That's my name don't f****** use it|`|rRvoOPvzaa	My boyfriend calls me princess, because he says i deserve everything in the world. But my favorite is when he calls me gorgeous.<br>  <br>  I call him fuzzball. He's got a hairy chest.|`|y7MsBXdmaa	my fav. is beautiful.|`|cKDBwNITaa	my bf calls me baby, sweetie um lots of stuff. lol|`|0mFB78Pvaa	i like to call my gf  babe or boo or snookums or her name
tQIPt9z4aa	Is this guy a better friend?  Do you want to pursue a relationship?  I would make a move if you think you could make this grow.  Ask him over for dinner, with your parents, go for a walk after.  Try to hold his hand and see his reaction.  Don't ruin a good friendship if that's all there is.  He may like you too but is shy and scared to ruin what you have.  Be honest and open and willing to take a risk if you really care for him.  But don't have expectations to high and set yourself up for a disappointment.  I am not sure on your age, but being honest is powerful, just don't be overwhelming and shock him, you know him well, and this may be something great.  Be kind and good to each other and see what happens.  Good luck
qAcrK4KTaa	Shelly and Kate are both wrong in a lot of aspects and Cow has a good point. But lets be honest if she’s in a relationship then you should step off. That’s disrespectful and of course is a good way to end up in trouble. I’m sure you’re probably smart enough to know who you can push your luck with and who you cant and this guy is obviously someone you aren’t worried about. But he probably has something you don’t lol especially if you are saying he looks bad and she’s into him. That’s just a surface assessment. You say he looks kinda scholarly which probably means he looks like he has some cash. And as you know green is the new muscle. But anyways more important than these superficial things is the fact that they are in a relationship so if she wanted to find someone else she knows how to break up with him. <br>  Now a few facts that are FACTS and not mentioned to encourage you is…<br>  A) Just because she hasn’t said anything to you doesn’t mean that she isn’t in to you. Girls know the game and they are the prey that’s just how it works. Plenty girls see something they like all the time all day long but they don’t “stare” and they don’t make the first move. Guess girls aren’t as smart as they want to think they are. But that’s the game.<br>  B) She sounds like a good catch and if she is/was a import model then I’m sure she has the confidence to let you know other wise buuut she could simply not do anything because of the guilt that would come from making the first move. (Though that’s unlikely)<br>  By the way whats her name? I have a pretty firm grasp of the Import world. lol and you know if she really is a hot import model you could always tell her to e-mail me. Just another Great Idea for you!|`|wr2uiZk7aa	Ask....otherwise you'll be frustrated not knowing what is possible outcome.|`|6NgDHZEEaa	I replied to your question but, ended up pasting it on the ask question section by mistake. Anyway, you're a loser, and judging from the answer you left on my page, that girl that you like thinks you are to. Why don't you follow the yellow brick road and get a heart/brain. Cause you're an idiot.|`|Rn7zkS52aa	more than likely she's not interested you anymore than just a nice person she tutors. trust me, if she was interested, she would go out of her way to let you know, would keep her boyfriend on the DL and not mention him, and would more than likely mention hanging out. i share information of my life with jewelers, dental hygienists, random people....doesn't mean i'm interested in any of them. <br>  <br>  and the fact you think your looks makes you better than him is just bullshit. women care about looks, but we care alot more about personality in the long run. seems like you have an ego..which again...turns off women in the long run. the link didn't work to the guy, but you need to but out. she's just being a friendly tutor, nothing more.
AA11841749	That's problem number one, you being concerned with what "other" people think.  Do what you think is right, and who cares what anyone else thinks.  It's not their business whether you're a virgin or not.  If you firmly believe you should wait till marriage, then do just that.  But whatever you do, don't go and give up your **** to just anyone.|`|GfCRiueRaa	Of course not. I am one too. Plus, I am in college. d:|`|iCqfmRC3aa	Making love with the person you love is the most beautiful feeling in the world. Having sex just because you think you shouldn't be a virgin anymore would feel cheap and unrewarding.<br>  <br>  Wait for the one you truly love. I found mine many years ago and still find that "most beautiful feeling" when we are intimate.<br>  <br>  You'll never regret waiting for the right guy, you'll only regret if you didn't wait for him. Your virginity is a wonderful gift that you can only give once. Make sure it's a gift to a person that will appreciate it.|`|HNycdO3Raa	yeah if your a virgin its a good thing guys would see you allllottttt more positively. If your a slut you will have no respect and guys will want sex only. I am a guy so i knoe
4YK4tBW5aa	Should you call your doctor, or should you ask the folks in "Singles & Dating"? Hmmm...
XRMNQPUIaa	Alright, well a few months ago I was going through the same thing. I didn't want to let him go even though everyone told me to. Eventually I began to try and move on.. And when he noticed that I moved on, he realised how much I really did mean to him, and he asked for me back. So now were back together and happier than ever :)<br>  Just don't beg for him back or continue to text or call him if that's what you're doing. Gooluck :)|`|W1aYIF71aa	What makes you think that we know enough about you, about him, or about your relationships problems to give you good advice.  Therefore, let him go.|`|8Zj1Dd4Haa	make him see you kiss or hugging or whatever to another hot guy. it will make him jeaous and he will want you back...or just appoloqize and tell him how you feel(lolll)|`|R04XOC5Uaa	The only thing you can truly do is tell him. Write him a letter or text him if it would be better. You just need to tell him your not ready to give up without a fight. Making him jealous might make him resort to the same idea, which would not be good for you. If you truly tell him how you feel and he still feels like he doesn't want the relationship than maybe he's not good enough for you !|`|rOuWeRrjaa	what ever you do dont try hard to impress him or make him jealous cause thats just hard be your self and live your life . then talk to him face to face in private . tell that he can tell you anything and your feelings wont get hurt. so when he tells you something hurtful just hold your tears back till the right time and what ever you do dont be friends with him it'll make it worst trust me|`|7De8SjDnaa	money and head|`|XYspe5RTaa	oh my gosh, i was just here!<br>  it sucks, i know!<br>  i'm just gonna say just tell him how your feeling.<br>  and try not to argure wit him! or point out the things you hate about him.<br>  in fact, do the oppisote. and make sure you tell him your feelings.<br>  and be willing to work on things. <br>  <br>  good luck. if it's meant to be, it'll work. :]|`|hpBfRdqhaa	You don't want him back; move on. I know you think that you want him but you shouldn't go back to your ex. I've learned that from experience.Don't try to make him jealous. Whenever a girl tries to make me jealous I just get mad and like them less.|`|xRFhWMFSaa	why did you break up with him in the first place?  Do not go up to him and say, "Lets get back together!"  Well, you could, but you will sound lame.  Tell him that you feel bad and maybe that you could have a reign check.|`|5kTl3NJ2aa	Get him jealous(if he still is single) and he may want u back.|`|zpstEG5Daa	One Word:<br>  FLIRT!!!
Wo5Ezmwiaa	Ah, he has trouble controlling his temper. When he apologizes, tell him that you really care about him and your relationship, but that you are not the person he can just dump all his anger on. Tell him that when he gets angry with you, and when he says those mean things, it really does hurt you - even if he doesn't mean them. Tell him that he will have to try harder to control his anger. Tell him it's okay for him to come to you when he's stressed and upset, and that you'd love to talk to him about whatever is bothering him so you can make him feel better, but that you do not think it's right for him to just go off on you whenever he is stressed. Some guys just have a real problem controlling their temper. When they can't say the mean things to the person they really should be saying them to, they'll instead say them to the person who will put up with it. So all you can do is tell him how you feel about it, tell him its a problem, and that can work on it together. If he doesn't change, then you'll have to just decide if it is something you can put up with or not.
Wo5Ezmwiaa	I really feel for your situation. I went in your profile and answered the question. I really meant what I said, and think it's the best thing for you to do. If you have any further questions, feel free to email me.
hjLzSGV0aa	haha jus call him a lot <br>  and when they for example go to the mall jus be there too ;]<br>  very simple <br>  jus be everywhere they are ;]<br>  haha<br>  trust me its fun<br>  me and my best friend used to do that when he ddnt wanna be with the girl anymore or if i ddnt wanna be with the dude anymore
ZAz7SEcfaa	i said milk and cookies alot and hooked up with her that night.
KTqdwG3Xaa	Just delete all contact with her, be in phone numbers or MSN or whatever.
g1hqC0zEaa	That is very sad. Get a hold of him some how. Did he break up with you or are you guys together? But anyways, I understand your situation. You have to talk to him somehow. Try and talk to him. Atleast he will have someone by his side who cares about him. you wana give him comfort and support. It is really sad what has happened. Get a hold of him, through someone who knows him.|`|s1leABaSaa	Omg sweeety, im so sorry that must be so hard for you aye.<br>  I wish I could help but I dunno. maybe if you cant talk to him or see him.. its not worthit anymore. you cant beat yourself up for the rest of your life.maybe for what hes going through.. you both need a break at this point.<br>  Im so sorry about that i wish I could do summin =[|`|B3cPFhssaa	Stop listening to the sad songs for a start.<br>  Pack all the pictures of you and him away,and anything else that reminds you of him,until you reckon you can look at them without crying.|`|BWFXbm35aa	Take the time you need to get it out, but not too much. After that, it's up to you to have to willpower to go on with your life. When you're ready, you'll find someone else who won't have to leave you.|`|FSjuYJqJaa	hey if hes only moved not far away youll see him again right?  try to keep thinking positive, the more positive you think the better youll feel.  try listening to some funny pop music too|`|Qu9dYb95aa	To be honest, you cant just stop crying and let go, it will take time. But the number one focus you should try, is to make sure that he is ok. When you know that he is safe and secure in some way, that a great load of relief off your shoulders. After that sense of relief, you will feel much happier, and less stressed and less worried. For now, stop listening to the slow and sad songs. Take a bath and just relax. Do something that calms you down, perhaps reading or drawing, whatever relaxes you. But maintain your emotional health because it can end up very bad. Just relax and take it easy, this whole situation will take a lot of time to overcome.
pdbc4souaa	Going to the prom is not your idea, you feel pressured to go by adults. The one thing that appeals to you is anesthetizing yourself with alcohol before you get there. <br>  <br>  You probably don't enjoy dancing.<br>  <br>  You don't feel like you fit in with most of the other people from school.<br>  <br>  If you were an adult, you could just say, "Sorry, I have other plans."<br>  <br>  The only dance that I ever enjoyed was the Homecoming Dance when I was in college. I ran the spotlight and my date poured punch.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you feel like you just don't belong here. You know what's worse than that? Feeling that you do.|`|lkxFy681aa	Proms are stupid.<br>  <br>  I plan to do something useful with my time instead of wasting an evening drinking and then eventually throwing up.|`|lRNAlYyXaa	Aren't you cool! That was like a novella. Not all makeup is green and blue. And almost no one actually wants to go to prom.|`|0cbb40121ecb55749f5e531e945f28c3aa	NEVER compare yourself to other ppl...You are simply not them.<br>  I admire individuality.<br>  So what if you arent excited...If your not, don;'t force youself to be...<br>  BUT<br>  just keep on open mind for the time being. Who knows, you might actually have fun and enjoy yourself. Just dont go to the prom with a bad attitude, thinking you are going to hate it...<br>  As for the party afterward, yes of course go!<br>  Like you said, he's like your big bro...<br>  Just try to have fun, but don;t pretend to have fun...<br>  Good luck!|`|hXdt1lntaa	dont worry i didnt go to my senior prom last year...i guess im not normal then....|`|wTP4kX07aa	honestly in your situation you shouldn't be asking the internet for probelms like these, you should get a best frined and ask them stuff like this, they can help you through a lot, that's all you really need to make it through school is one close close friend that you can talk to. good luck|`|kEjiYLSmaa	Let's put it this way. Your obviously being forced into something your not comfortable with. But If you do end up going, be careful. I never went to prom, but there are a lot of crazy things that happen after prom.(If you know what I mean). So if you do end up going, be safe!|`|2hV2fmZEaa	your just different. and you dont HAVE to listen to your principal. if you really dont want to go to prom, dont. i would go for the drinks too.|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	Just sounds like your head is in a different place, some people only have things like prom to look forward to while others find it trivial and have more interesting things going on in their lives|`|4cIh8wPTaa	I doubt there will be drinks at a high school prom with high adult supervision.|`|prdLQhAdaa	I am DREADING prom but that is just me.<br>  <br>  I hope you have fun tho...|`|I4f7cqHbaa	It seems like you have no social life what so  ever.......|`|uknsalXdaa	idk wat to say cuz ur a complete opposite of me :]|`|08ff27fe3110ddd7da36736daaf4c2dfaa	i felt the same way when my prom was coming up. i went though just for the hell of the experience. my prom was ok, but the after party was the real party! i'll say go to ur prom, u really dont wanna miss such a special milestone of your life juz bcuz. it's celebrating u putting 4 years into school. just go!! and at the after party, really party!! you want to reminice on that nite, even if it sucked! lol. good luck!|`|DyviGDAwaa	ahhhh I HATEEDDD going to my high school prom. But i went and I made the best of it. Go out, try and have fun because i promise you when it's all said and done maybe 5 10 20 years down the road you'll look back on it and be happy you went. Plus goin out after is always the more fun part and it sounds like u have a nice plan. eh don't stress it'll be fun|`|lO1abIcVaa	Even though this event is a little different form the "norm." (especially the attire); think about it like this..... this is the only prom and sooner or later you will look back at the moment and question yourself on why you did not do certain things. LIVE THE MOMENT. Dress up!, Wear Make-up, do not wear your motorcycle jacket! please =]=]<br>  Impress the class of 2009. Show them a different side of you. Trust Me, all of this will pay off in the end. <br>  <br>  P.S- the after party at that apartment sounds cool =D|`|Stwj8CRmaa	Maybe you just aren't into the hole prom thing and want to blow it off instead but who knows some people are into it and some people are not in to prom's .

She likes your personality....that's so much better than liking someone just for their looks because personality is forever, looks fade.<br>  <br>  She OBVIOUSLY likes you. You shouldn't compare her to other girls or to the previous relationships you've had. Why do you automatically assume that the two of you will never go out because of the differences in the color of your skin?<br>  <br>  Ask her out.|`|SIE3HuHRaa	No it isn't. You're human and in this cruel society, looks make first impressions. Some people are born beautiful, and some people are born ugly.

But she never said she didn't find you attractive, did she?|`|2Fi3EmI8aa	Its not a bad thing, but i think it is a bit misguided.<br>  Girls find different things attractive than what men find attractive.  Personality is VERY HIGH on out 'dream guy must have' list.  What is weird is that a guys personality can make him very physically attractive to a girl.  <br>  For example: have you ever been walking down the street and seen a really good looking woman with an ugo dude?  Its becuase his personality has made him physically appealing to that woman.  Yet it is rare to see a good looking guy with an ugo woman, becuase men base alot more importance on physical beauty than women do.<br>  She may say she likes you for your personality, but it is your personality which is making her physically attracted to you.  Does that make some sort of sense?|`|UyB1gXEraa	no not at all!jus make sure u look extra hot nxt time u see her! if she wasnt attracted to u at all she wouldnt say anything like that!and she seems pretty into looks and stuff right! who cares about her parents in sure they would prefer a real guy rather that some loser who wears nail polish!!!:D go for it!!...

Maybe it's their way of trying to make amends - by pretending you are now bosom buddies!|`|bO2rzfISaa	They have grown up and now treat others decently. You don't have to be their friend, just be pleasant. Your perception of how things were back in the day may not be 100% accurate.|`|n8lXItGraa	Because they grew up!  Be thankful and not resent childhood antics.|`|JcwjDpY8aa	.... this hasn't happened to me.  Perhaps they are jealous of your success no and feel as though you are more "fit" to be friends with??<br>  For whatever reason, if someone DID act like this to me, I would probably immediately call them out on it.|`|sx0PpjvAaa	You probably think you were the best and most caring of children too. Our views and memories are flawed.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	To make them selves feel better about the way they treated you.|`|MVxFOI5naa	They feel guilty|`|HLkH0uKMaa	I know, they will ask you to come over and visit and things of that nature. I never go, I just figured it was karma coming around and biting them in the as*. I think that in their adult life they are now the outcast or the person that no one wants to be around.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	Their probably burnt out from too much pot smoking!!  Can't remember crap!<br>  PHONY PEOPLE!<br>  <br>  They probably don't have any friends  and are in hopes they could have you as one now.|`|Pj81dRTAaa	It may be that they realized that they have done wrong to you and are feeling remorseful for it.
L8IaTsewaa	Definitely! there are hundreds of limo companies anywhere you are, its just a matter of finding a good one that matches your budget and needs. I cant exactly suggest a good limo company for you since i dont know where you're at but i suggest you get all the info you need at <a href="http://www.limoquoter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.limoquoter.com</a> - you can get a free quote too and get results instantly! :) by the way, limos are $70 or more per hour, have fun!|`|MYilJDb5aa	Yes you can just go to a site where you can contact multiple limo companies at once instead of calling them one by one and getting discouraged. I use EZ Limo Rentals and they should have several listings in your area. But I think they only operate n the states??
KJxwNfsaaa	Well it could be a misunderstanding.<br>  but he probably got caught up with something<br>  or it might have slipped his mind to call you.<br>  dont take it to personal.
e8yt5PrGaa	give him to me Eli ..i wish i had a brother .i have an older sister ill trade ya ...<br>  <br>  he only wants attention and i know it gets on youre nerves ..the way to solve this is to give him a certain time when you can play with him or talk <br>  but then make it clear that when you are busy with things that he has to give you space and privacy ...<br>  <br>  Andy|`|sr7jX2wYaa	Can't  help you much about your  little  brother , unless you take the time once a week to do  something  with him that he really likes  to do even if you don't. So that he gets to where he looks forward to it & then when he starts to bug you tell him, you aren't gonna do that with him if he doesn't  stop. But really that is pretty much  what all brothers & sisters do is bug each other. <br>  As  far as your  mom goes  she is just  trying to communicate with you, so instead of  getting aggravated  tell her what you did , like had  to do a chapter in history, or  about  an out fit  someone  wore you really liked. It will get  easier as you do it , & make her feel  better as a mom. Some kids  are not so lucky,  they come home & their  parents  aren't even there to ask, or  are home   but are  drunk or high & don't care  what their kids do . You are a lucky girl who has  a mom who cares , so give her a little something from your day. When you  are older you will understand , & be glad you did*|`|mBTKYRPPaa	well.. im 16 and my bro is 9 and i feel the same way about him that you feel about your brother so your not alone! I haven't found a solution to the problem besides creating as much space between us as possible.. and I haven't really tried to have a relationship with him.. but i have let him know that I WILL NOT take verbal abuse from him - he used to be verbally abusive, telling me everything my dad used to tell me, and my dad is an all around abusive person.. that may not be quite the situation you are in.<br>  <br>  just fight the urges to annoy him and create as much space between you two as you can, but maybe not as much space as me and my brother have lol... but a healthy amount of space as you are a teenager and teens neeeedd space. <br>  not too much though. <br>  try and improve things with your brother but older siblings aren't really supposed to absolutely adore every minute of being older.. and its the younger siblings JOB TO ANNOY US. its very normal (in my opinion) for you to be irritated reallllyy bad, i mean come on your 14!!! thats what being 14 is all about. just try not to let it get too out of hand.. <br>  i have a little sister thats 6 and i love her to death and we get along great but just living with her gets annoying, its natural!<br>  as for the mom thing,  i really don't know what to tell you.. if you have any ill feelings towards her just talk to her about it on your own terms..|`|Wf8PbTraaa	to your question about your mom......thats called being a teenager. just try to be a bit nicer. kids don't realize how hard it is for parents to raise kids until they see it themselves. i don't have kids but i was one of those "help mom out" kids but i have a sister who went thru that hellraising stage and i saw what my mom had to go thru (i'm 19, btw). so just try to be cooler to her.<br>  <br>  as for your brother....ahhh idk what to tell you i WAS that brother for my sister when we were younger. i don't really know how to deal with it except try to hang out with him more. talk to him and ask why he likes to bother you.|`|fFjqHi5iaa	Its just how life is with sibblings. And as far as your mom asking you those questions it happens to me too its so annoying i try to cope with it by saying things like it was fine i have homework and walk away as quickly as possible my little sister is annoying to telling ur parents WILL NOT WORK just try to deal with it as best as you can it just means he looks up to u :)|`|l0xnIquFaa	im 14 too. i have a little brother who is 12 and two older brothers that are 20 and 22. <br>  <br>  basically my little bro bothers me to, i just ignore him and go to my room or outside. your 14 tho u shouldnt need to aggravate your little brother sorry thats immature, i dont do that. just ignore him, block him out with music or tv or somthing.<br>  <br>  everyone gets crabby at 14, i do somday when my mom says somthing to me. its just natural. try taking a deep breath if u start to feel crabby and count to 10 that helps me
64bTqqfCaa	go get your closure girl...and tell him off if u have to your never gunna see him after tommorow anyway and it`s not loseing your dignity if u dnt cry...u have a right to know what happened and why he did what he did.if u dnt find out then you`ll spend forever wondering why he did it.i say go find out and get your closure|`|Bnl7z8pBaa	Whatever will give you the fewest regrets.  If you're never going to see him again, what's wrong with risking your dignity (it's not like you'll have to deal with him again if things go poorly)?  But, if you're really not that invested, it might not be worth the effort.  Do whatever feels right.|`|k8YXA62Saa	Get closure,<br>  other wise it will haunt you.<br>  be friends with him<br>  talk to him<br>  get his phone number<br>  dont just blow him off and be like"oh im never gonna see him again blah blah blah"<br>  talk to him!!!<br>  before it's too late.|`|RZJOvxcNaa	I didn't even finish reading this and all i can tell you is that he is really immature and he will only hurt you if you ever date him try aiming for more maturity|`|O6pgbGMhaa	If he said "lets be friends" so quickly he probably thinks your fat/ugly or he found someone hotter then you.|`|Dty5zrMCaa	idk what you should do... he probably just freaked out and got scared of being rejected, so he changed his mind... I would talk to him!|`|q1Ty3nk6aa	I think you should talk to him.|`|3kCQDUUGaa	Forget about it...hes obviously not worth anymore time. let him go|`|fb0e6ee443fc42488c552557d2231b78aa	thats why because he is leaveing duh|`|gTB86Ydmaa	That's what she said. Lol|`|Sg0gCtEAaa	That's what she said.|`|hQ7y7sQZaa	well it depends on how you truely feel abt him. like if you reall like him and really want to know then ask to talk to him and mayb you guys can become friends. you guys can still talk on myspace, messengers, email ECT.i would go with your gut tho. sistuations like these r hard. Good Luck!|`|XGgPhaDbaa	OK - for starters, NO ONE can love you after one date.<br>  For second - the dating process is to go out with someone to see if you really like them outside of school or work or whatever. If both people feel they might have a connection, then they go out again. <br>  If they don't, they don't. No one should need closure after 1 date.<br>  It usually takes about 3 months to really get to know someone.<br>  He didn't click with you on the first date. So what?<br>  Just leave it alone and tell him to have a good life.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Blow it off. Your dignity should remain intact. You didn't do anything wrong. He probably doesn't even know he acted like an azz.|`|IARYnu6zaa	Leave it alone.<br>  There are plenty of other guys out there :)|`|2B7gs9RIaa	Go for the closure<br>  Would go better in the long run..
Z5gAR2saaa	im not being mean but this sounds like something out of a movie, but all i can say is that no one can really answer this question for you because only you know the answer so you need to ask this question to yourself|`|R75tldc8aa	No one can really define love or know what you're feeling.<br>  If you think you're in love, then you probably are.|`|2hhGgKBZaa	That is definately not lust...and it sounds like love to me! Tell him how you feel, dont hold back or be scared as it sounds like he feels the same! I'm so happy for you :)|`|X05GAaLeaa	I think maybe......ughhhh im not a good person to ask im only 15<br>  so I don't really know what love is , but I do know what lust it..|`|eSDNSq4zaa	im guessing its love if its this long of a story..|`|9r1zw0evaa	HELL YEAH!!!  Sounds like a sweet relationship, eek u had sex :O jk lol|`|A13guVSCaa	LOVE!  Someone who finds such a bunch of nice words to and for each other. Thats  love. Lust is more sexual compliemnts, like if ud said that u get horney and ...when you hug him kiss him ect..but u havent....<br>  talking about csreaming it out loud...thats sound love<br>  <br>  i am married and i am still exciting insanly in love with my baby. i wish i could tell everyday, juist what u just said about ur bfriend.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK FOR THE FUTURE!!|`|bc999a4e25e815eab170bb839ca3863eaa	how old are you?<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  saying "I Love You" is only as big of a deal as you make it, you're giving power to it by not saying it, so say it.|`|mrkJZ2Pnaa	puppy love because your both shy of saying you love eachother and stuff bt wonce you get past that and spend more time with eachother it will be love good luck!|`|fXedgFmIaa	ITS LOVE!|`|rLvOOuPhaa	Totlal drama-book love! Girl, you are IN LOVE!!! No question!|`|MJC2owYLaa	oh yeah girl! go for it!  get him before he gets snatched!(=|`|Go47yYm1aa	I think the question I'm really tempted to ask is that after saying that mouthful, do you really still doubt that you feel love for him? Whether your old or young, it's a pretty simple feeling. You don't indicate how long the two of you have been together, and you really don't give anybody an age range to work with, but to be fair, you seem to be in high school. (on a cynical note, you've already had sex with him, but you feel afraid to say you love him?) I'd say you've got it figured out, and saying I love you isn't anything so sacred that you need to be afraid of saying it even if you're unsure.|`|wXOGqZxJaa	it sounds really cute.<br>  sounds like a freaking lucky girl if you ask me?!<br>  sounds like you found your prince charming.. <br>  that once-in-a-lifetime guy. REALLY hard to find.<br>  i'd really like to find mine.<br>  <br>  it sounds like love to me. but i think that him telling you face-to-face and you telling him face-to-face that you love each other will really sum things up and once you have it out there.. you cant take it back.<br>  best of luck. hope everything works out(:
bc999a4e25e815eab170bb839ca3863eaa	bro, your 16, take your time, I didn't start dating until I was your age too, if girls are asking for your digits then you'll be fine. But realize YOU need to ask the girl out, not vice versa, and don't get in a relationship just to have sex/make-out/kiss/whatever|`|GQpTI2GWaa	The chances are slim to none...|`|ih67wfUWaa	id do u! lol im 16 2 and female and i would  lol
o4JRsfOdaa	Some friendships are not to be fixed. It seems to me that you are more mature in this friendship than your so-called friend. Sweetie, there are better friends out there for you. Just look around.|`|AA10731562	Just kiss Geoffrey!!!
i6tyscumaa	Ahh, you two sound really sweet :)  If you live somewhere where its warm, have a late night picnic under the stars :D  Even better if you live near a beach! xx|`|1968df56bb4d12221cfe3e719b7c1488aa	WOW! I need to find me a gf like you...you such a great gal! ul *** up wit sumthing! Make it from the heart...|`|XorzA99saa	sounds like you are already doing romantic stuff:)|`|KxZN2E2Aaa	Meee tooooo!  kiss his neck and stuff|`|7vJdFEPQaa	hi invite him over for dinner and cook something nice for him (with mom's help) we would like that.....    hope it helps|`|9jr5QaE5aa	just dont know wat to say to kids ur age already making out  sorry i sounded like m too old skul.m just wondering wat i wld say to my younger sister whos two grades above u    gudluk
59HXAtRHaa	nOT ON THE 1ST date thats a NO NO!!  It should be strickly business!!  With a good solid firm HANDSHAKE!!      LMAO!!  Of couse the shld be some action..   he should tease a girl to get her wanting more!!!|`|6iR7Mvc5aa	Just hug him i think that's enough.kissing at the first time is dangerous. However,if you know him better their is no harm.|`|19TSkwaKaa	A hug. then  Kiss on lips or cheek. Which ever the girl is up for.
e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	It never hurts to be on friendly terms with a prospective mother-in-law.    So far, i would not worry, but keep your eyes open.  Unless things change, why talk about it and make him think you are paranoid?|`|vh0yVJ7daa	He is scum a player he is wanting you and wanting your mother aswell,Why not just tell your mother he is your boyfriend?I take it your just bonking buddies right?Well sorry girl but in his eyes he thinks your a whore and he thinks your mothers one too,You say he has a sexual past,He sounds like a perverted loser who can't keep his snake in his trousers,Keep away from him,He is American you are African how can you trust him?
3gMytPXhaa	not wrong. it is great to love such people until we die.|`|zhaHc4FAaa	Wow...you sound just like me.   It's never wrong to love someone...it just shows that you are human and that you have the capacity to give of yourself in the the most spiritual way possible.   My ex left me almost two years ago and yet I think of him every day.   I sometimes cry but it gets a bit easier with time.   He got married about 6 months ago and it tore my heart out.   You never forget them but you have to move on.    I try to view like this - The cardinals and the steelers went to the superbowl...each team had a chance to win but the reason that the cardinals lost is because they made alot of mistakes that cost them the game....they cannot relive this superbowl experience nor can they change the outcome as the game is over forever....all that the cardinals can do now is focus on what they need to change in the future to not make those mistakes again and maybe one day they will achieve a win in the superbowl.    Good luck to you as I understand the pain that you feel.|`|hBDwpwvKaa	if you love someone how can you stop loving them. if you do stop loving them, in the first place you never did.|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	not wrong as you can't just turn feelings off.  But you should move on and find you will fall in love with someone else.|`|eUUcriANaa	you may never get over her but it will get easier with time. You need to start dating again and having fun. You will meet someone else and things will be much better. Best wishes to you|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	u can't help who u love but if someone is gone and married to someone else, there is no gain to keep loving that person, just keeps u in the past, and u relive it and haven't accepted it yet. its always best to try to move on when someone won't be coming back, if u don't it can make u emotionally sick and cause allot of pain that u don't have to be in. its how u accept whats happened not what happened.|`|YVJw7vvHaa	I'd say it's not wrong , i was in the same position as you ..But somehow when more years pass by ,you start forgetting the person .Get to know some new girl , take her out for a drink and stuff , Find out everything about her ,tell her about your self and you wont even notice time going by .. and then 1 day youll think of that girl and youll say to yourself , I dont even want her back , I know my new girl so much better  and shes way closer to me .. Just get the right person! Keep your head up :)|`|y4SUDnpaaa	It's not right or wrong..it is what it is. But not accepting the reality of the situation is very bad for you. You have to accept she doesn't love you anymore, she loves someone else and has married them. You are out of her life and you have to get her out your mind.You are probably torturing yourself with visions of how happy she is and making love with her husband.  You don't need a new girlfriend, you don't need friends telling you to just get over it, if you could you would. You need a professional therapist or counselor to teach you some coping skills and help you to accept what has happened. There is no reason to suffer if help is available.|`|BuTl5EyQaa	It's ok to still care about her but you need to move on at the same time.|`|7uVjp0QKaa	As long as it's platonic , it's O.K. Move On.
19TSkwaKaa	Be flirty with him!  See if he flirts back.  Then gradually build up the flirting and who knows.|`|gwUMipsUaa	It doesn't matter.  You really don't know the guy, only met him once, and he tells you what he wants you to hear.    Date guys in your own area.  Or maybe he could move back and further his education where you are and then you can start dating.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Obviously you're friends, but you want to know if you can be more than friends? You should ask him.|`|6wYD6Z7Faa	ask him then whether he likes you or not its the only way to find out.|`|8t0DlWf8aa	i think you cant do nothing.you cant leave your home-country to go find him and make a releshionship|`|xga5qH2Iaa	I prefer the indirect way. Tell him how you think about him like "You are so smart, etc. " loll. Then ask him if he likes you =P. o man dont listen to me i'm confused..|`|ip7mlDmDaa	Hi,  If you don't want to tell him then show him, being a true friend that you are and being there until he realizes that you are the only person or rather woman that seem to understand him and genuine with him, and pray that he doesn't meet someone who will feel and treat him like you do, and they let him know before he realizes your true intentions.  Good luck!
PLbmKNpvaa	Don't be afraid to smile or laugh, don't take yourself too seriously, and show that you respect people, and girls will find you irresistable. It has nothing to do with your looks, it all has to do with being confident in who you are, and having a sense of humour.|`|htWw0OlCaa	I think you are very handsome, and you have a nice body as well. Buy some guy magazines and get a sense of what the fashion is like and go and buy some new clothes. Let your hair grow out just a little longer and get a cool hair cut to go with your new clothes and your new look. Believe me, once you do all this, you will really have confidence. I hope this has helped. Best wishes|`|BuTl5EyQaa	I think you look totally fine and I am sure there is someone out there who will be right for you.     How about you buy a girl that you like a dinner at a nice restaurant.|`|x02jsjg6aa	Your appearance is fine.  What is preventing you from meeting women is your shyness.  Maybe a way to start to becoming more confident is by watching how your peers talk and interact and try to mimic it to fit in with the culture.  Look at what they wear, also.|`|FI4Z0jYcaa	The first thing you should know is that there is no real "quick fix" to your shyness (not your appearance).  You may suddenly find a tag that will bring everything out, but it is unlikely.  You can:     - Start talking to people about something you both enjoy, and see where that takes you   - Find a totally different hobby, start as a beginner, and discuss things with everyone when you are having difficulty
DFSHoO4uaa	NO NO NO!! u like him being his friend is where ut starts let him get to no u make sure u be ur self around him let him see the real u and who knows where things will go! take care and i hope everything goes well take care!|`|N3U7xWAPaa	naww he just wants to get to know you better . you have not broken the ice yet .  become more of his friends let him trust you as a good friend / not just a friend   .. he wants to keep his options open . and maybe your too much of a friend to him to want to wreck your friendhsip . boys are weird for giving mixed messages . just keep being his friend and keep being yourself ! . and small talk a little flirting and hopefully he'll feel the same way soon if not it was not ment to be .|`|OpOm35gJaa	No just make him want you more, Then when he ask you out say"I'll think about it but lets just be friends..... for now"|`|wE2etBzbaa	not ignore him, treat him really like a friend, but not too close,  that will piss him off if he little at least interested in you.    That might teach him lesson not to say friends for girls who are interested|`|jI4O0eFmaa	Maybe he just doesn't understand, don't ignore him. At least you are still friends, don't break up with him. If not, it wouldn't be nice.|`|8rM5W0EBaa	get your hair and nails done get a make over and look really hot dont talk to him as much but every time he makes eye contact keep it for a few seconds then lose it. he will be running to you in a few weeks|`|gQtbwpyCaa	yeh man treat them mean keep them kean|`|v5nRQZtpaa	you can't like him to much if you just want to ignore him because he wants to be your friend ^^ lol|`|Aqjvzjdlaa	Definitely not!  Liking him a lot is reason enough for you to want to get to know him better. Friends know things girlfriends never do. Start from there, maybe as he gets to know you better he may find you to be a girl he would not want to lose the chance of being with. On the other hand you may also find out if you really like HIM or just what you thought he was. Friendship is always a good start in any relationship. Good luck.|`|0l7pyBSTaa	usually when someone says just friends for now, it means just friends for always.....they just don't want to hurt your feelings.....|`|BJwhdvjoaa	No if he calls it friends then be his friend friend can turn into so much more!!!!!!! TRUST ME|`|UGXp9g7Iaa	Seriously, i've made this stuffs lots of times.. Sometimes it's a way to show that he doesn't like u, cuz he things that u don't like him... and he doesn't want to live alone with this "love"|`|CvjRmk6Eaa	Well if you ignore him, it probably won't bother him unless y'all are really close friends. It probably won't make him like you anymore, he'll just think you are being immature or a total *****. All you do is stay friends with them and maybe become better friends than you ever have. You may have to cut out some of the flirting so he won't feel to ackward with you.
GsrLh50laa	No, you don't need full custody, and you can get everything you need to change your child's last name on your own at - http://www.legalformsbank.biz/namechange...|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	don't mess with changing his name. Let that be your son's decision when he is older. Nothing good comes out of using the kids as a weapon. Doesn't matter how much you despise your X, remain friendly for your kids sake. It will show him that you are the bigger person if you remain nice to your X.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Why do you want this?|`|50zbKv0jaa	so your using your son as a weapon against your ex husband  you have an argument with him so , you dont care how this effects your son , no matter what the cost as long as you ca express you hate and anger, its all good    its good to see despite being a mother you dont let it effect your hatred|`|jNQbVDHSaa	ask your son if he wants to change name|`|kbIkVS0raa	Good luck with that but to my understanding it is very hard to do. If your sons last name is the same as his fathers then unless the father agrees to let you change it you can't. Why would it matter anyways. I split with my daughters father and it never even crossed my mind to change her last name. I don't understand why people worry about such little things. I mean I see fighting for child support and custody but gosh let the name thing go.|`|KxZN2E2Aaa	i hope your not changing it to his step dads last name or somthing  Go after his for more child supports

W0KQTXrvaa	wake up we all come with baggage's|`|E3yOmel9aa	kissing is a big deal and i'm sure your fiancees friend will tell her eventually if she has not already|`|tzbYqdj6aa	yes it is..it is the start of foreplay..which will only lead to bigger and better things..:)....mildred is my leader|`|oeEsnwSMaa	Sorry but she is going to tell!!! good luck|`|zZ8kHajcaa	Its not a problem.|`|gu3GAFC9aa	Well I would say it is a big deal. I think cheating is terrible. It is hurtful, disrespectful, and affects the trust in the relationship. I would never marry a guy who cheated.|`|BfDM12ptaa	if u r fiance is like me.......u ARE in a big trouble!|`|YrK7S8xtaa	of course its a big deal    would you be ok with it if you found out she had done it|`|oNb8RqTEaa	Come clean to her first, it is always better to hear it from the SO than another person. I am sure if she loves you she can get over it. My dh did.|`|7e8NN8saaa	Kissing someone isn't an affair. Heavy kissing might be considered the beginnings of one and someone may have been hurt if you broke it off without explanation or good reason.     If you have issues with your fiance's best friend it could be a problem just because you have issues whether it involves the kissing or not - depending on the girl and how good a good friend she is.     But don't anticipate problems that you don't have. Be sure to keep the lines of communication open with your girl friend and tell her yourself before she finds out from someone else.|`|6k3mwKthaa	Yes kissing is a big deal. I love it! Don't you worry, though, it is the most common expression of one's affection for another person. Your girl friend, or your wife-to-be wouldn't expect you to just shake hands when you had a crush on someone in your college days, would they? If so, you better think carefully before you get further involved with your fiancee.|`|3gMytPXhaa	No problem at all. be happy. even though she tell no problem.|`|SCg3kDz2aa	Not, even sexual experience is not a big deal. The best is that if you come before and mention this to your fiancee.|`|5Hb20PZKaa	Its probably not too big a deal. its the past and it was college and there wasnt any sex so you should be fine, and your "friend" doesnt really have any right to try and ruin your relationship with your fiance based on your past|`|qLaw1VELaa	it depends on wether your gentitilia made contact with her anus|`|ask4MdtEaa	Depends.|`|AA11023855	It will be a problem in future if she disclose|`|0CHoZRk3aa	nice broo, oh well, just say that if she cant trust you then its not going to work, idk|`|03mWWuhoaa	that was all in the past. i really wouldnt worry about it, if your fiance does have a problem, the best thing to do is sit down & talk with her, tell her thats all in your past :) hope this helps x|`|AA11171280	Let me get this straight--- are you worried that if someone tells your fiancee that you had girlfriends in the past that you kissed, that she would be upset?     Good heavens, she didn't expect you to be a monk before she met you. If you'd head relationships with these women AFTER you were dating your fiancee, that would be different.    This is noooooo problem    Good luck and God bless!|`|b24WMflsaa	it totally depends on how ur wife is   just tell her about this and tell that ur not in good terms with her friend  if she breaks up just think she's not ur's and if she understands be way good with her!!|`|0f5d692c2ddaae1a325f6df3f3c8059baa	if there is a need for you to raise old issues with your to be rather do it now before someone else do it cause its better from you than the third party, even though i personally don't think its a bigger issue as it was past her/his life. not that you cheated but had affairs while still at school.|`|AA10135724	personally, i dont think its a big deal at all. i mean, they are part relationships. EVERYONE has them. i can see her being upset if she discovered u used to hire prostitutes or something lol but if she gets upset about an innocence PAST realtionship, especially when didnt go all the way, then there is something wrong. dont worry about.|`|N4vDuY74aa	it will be a problem if ur would be is 4rm a Orthodox family.  how it will be for u if u hear the same things about your1 "would be " from any 1 of ur close friends??i would be a nightmare wouldn be it??:(  ane ways be +ve.Happy married life.life has to go on what ever happens|`|6JPiNGdfaa	nope|`|AA11089526	NO.....that is your past.....everyone has one....good grief...should the subject come up....just pass it off and ignore it....who cares what you did  in the past...that is your business and not your soon to be wifes....she wasnt your soon to be wife then....so dont even acknowledge it even if she does find out...just shrug it off......LORDY....hello we have other things to worry about right now....we are in a RECESSION!!!!|`|xmmX3JTRaa	I looks like it all happened some times ago, before you were with your fiance.    I do not think it will have any consequences now.    just make sure you do not do anything now.|`|GckVXU4Paa	Since u r not in good terms with her, she might tell.  Y not take the courage and tell it urself. So even if ur "would be" comes to know about it, it wouldn't harm ur married life. If she comes to know from other sources, then perhaps she might think that u were covering it.    Now-a-days, no big deal with girls. Everyone tolerates immature childhood activities. Nobody cares for the past anymore.    Best manly thing will be to confess it in front of her before she comes to knuw about it through others.|`|0Cl70eDKaa	I think that was past you are not doing this thing in present with anyone na?  if you could'n do in present so don't fear too much if this disclose to your would be wife say that all was past but ur my present & future no one there expect you  ok dear don't worry  any way congrats
BeZlyOqGaa	You have to just trust what you feel deep inside.  It's good that you show your significant other that you care but then you may cross the line and become possessive and jealous.  Try talking it out with the person and if there happy to be with you even when you do act like that then it's a sign they love you, just calm down.|`|ReH5EoR0aa	Jealousy is wanting to help someone and feel they can't.   Too much jealousy causes problems - time to let go and find someone else who wants your help.     If you have a feeling of wanting someone else to fail because you aren't there to help them,  look at who did that to you.      Possessiveness would be controlling someone, not letting them make their own choices, telling them what to do.   Not a good thing.  Who did that to you?     Find a group where you can help others.   I mean, really help them.   Like Red Cross or nursing,  Peace Corps, an old folks home, child care, teaching, YWCA clubs.   If you are busy helping others you won't feel jealous or possessive of anyone.

Here's an easy one:    Write your name in braille, japanese, or some language that you know they won't be able to figure out.    Or, you could always just tell the guy since you like him anyways. I bet part of you really wants to tell him, which is probbly why you took the dare to begin with.|`|K1iUzewyaa	Like nike.. just do it...|`|Z7kEGg4uaa	Well if you don't want him to find it's you, just write your name with a UV pen lol.|`|YXcN4C8Aaa	Spell your name wrong? :P    Only put your annitials

I think you shouldn't be with either of them as you will just hurt them both.    How can you say you love someone else when you have a boyfriend?    Be with none.    Save them heartbreak.    The 18 y.o just wants sex.    Tell your boyfriend whats going on!

You will know when you are happy and this is obviously not it! Good luck!|`|7w2kCTDJaa	The first person to answer was right on. You do not love him. You're just used to him. Big difference. Break it off once & for all. You will break up with many men if your life before it's all said & done. He will be fine & so will you.

498JdszFaa	Uni, you haven't written a word about what YOU get out of it. Do you even enjoy it yourself or are you just putting up a show for him?    Good (sex-)partners get off by the exitement of their partners, but it must be mutual. If you don't get real pleasure out of this he'll notice some time and that could be a turn-off.|`|F4d89iRMaa	if you give a kid candy too much eventually he'll stop wanting it. you got to, yes, tune it down or do something else. mix it up. i understand your concern but thats the only way, i would think.|`|JZjE1K9Baa	Ya, you have to let him do a little of the work.  Even all that greatness will get old.|`|Ps7uyaomaa	of course he will get bored. i sure as hell would get bored of you|`|zAoKd2DBaa	hmmmmm i had a similar problem, in that i ALWAYS used to dress up in sexy underwear for my partner (now my husband). Of course he loved it but i stopped doing it all the time because i thought he'll take it for granted, get bored even ! so now i save it for an occasion.     give him regular sex, i think, but leave the trimmings for special occasions, not rare occasions but maybe just once a week instead of every night.     Also, what does he do for you?     Think this is a question that men should answer really - i still wonder that because i always want sex, will that become boring?? should i make it a treat rather than an almost daily occurance?     Interested to read other answers.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	My wife does it like that to me.  After 20 years I still have passion for her.  We are both 46.  We both stayed in good shape though.  Not to be a pig but if she had done what some of our friends wives did and gained 50 pounds I would not be a happy man right now.      So it is both what you do, and how you take care of yourself.    PS:  I do my best to rock her world also.  We connect twice a week on average now.
rkZhVpvgaa	I have no idea why grand father should object to your daughter's marriage.  You need to convince that your daughter loves the boy very much and it is a question of whole life.  Ward off any misgivings or misunderstandings of grand father about the boy.  I am sure he will come round finally.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|2vSxgAkDaa	just say:  _Insert name here_  She loves him and if you don't respect her enuf to let her make her own decisions than fine don't come to the wedding but don't take it out on her! (you gotta act mad and kinda cry at the same time)|`|pNqjsJn7aa	dont get into all this..u never know..what may offend him..rather ask ur husband to talk to him & make him understand..|`|AA12324252	Don't you think your daughter should be happy? Grandfather has had his life so let her have hers. Tell him you respect him but she is your child and you will give her YOUR blessing.|`|thoMmZAvaa	I'd suggest just letting your husband speak with his father. Let him know that while the family understands his views, that his grand-daughter has decided to marry the person she loves and that you and he are standing by her decision and choice in a husband. He may never be happy with her decision, but most likely he'll work past it with some time and getting to know the young man. Once they start the next generation it won't be an issue.
1Z0Lmrk1aa	Are you going to be working too? Either way its possible, but it would help if you both worked. The prices of homes are down right now all over California so if your looking to buy, its the best time. I was born and raised in Los Angeles and live alone in a middle class neighborhood.|`|AA11108018	You have to look at how your going to be making.  Can you afford to buy a house that costs that much..  Is the company stable with so many companies cutting back I would make sure I made a personnel services contract spelling your job is it guarantied.  Those are things you should be doing
ShaUAySvaa	Ok I am in 8th grade I am 14, I have plenty of experience with "do boys like girls who are sporty, preppy, peppy, casual, smart, or like a tom boy?"and " like this boy but i don't know if he knows i am alive" He should like you for you, I have tried to be different to make other people happy and you become unhappy very unhappy, be you and if he likes you great if not that is better (why?) because you are way too young to be worried about this, I know, I know you are mature and everyone else has a boyfriend... well guys only want looks and stuff 5th graders or even 8th graders shouldn't do, so just be friends, hold hands, talk and save the rest for later, love sucks it hurts you, it ages you - it is better to be young and naive while it lasts, DON'T have low self confidence and never think you aren't pretty! okay...? don't! trust me, once you start thinking that way, and if you don't change your world flips upside down... email me if you need advice ok sweety!? please, about anything - ambervee@rocketmail.com|`|4kcXEwtTaa	well for one your in 5th grade !!!! it doesnt matter your not in highschool or even middle school yet !! guys will like you for YOU dot change yourself to make a guy notice you cause then he"ll like you for something your not !!!|`|YyFexhd3aa	OMG fifth grader ont you have school tomorrow honey good night FS|`|abDyYtLhaa	i would like a guy who'd like me for me, not if i was pretending to be preppy or a tom boy|`|ugy5wjftaa	this is too much of a generalised question...  every guy is different and likes different traits in people ... be grown up and ask him out, if hes interested he'll say yes, if nhe says no, you get your answer ...good luck xx|`|TOnK6Yt0aa	come on likkl girl its past ur bed time, go  do your homework instead of talkin bout boys|`|OAYaeW22aa	i like preppy gurls tht are like hollister. or abercrombie|`|Ps7uyaomaa	most guys dont care about what they where. they care about how they can work what they got.  but your only in fifth grade so you will learn about that in a couple years.
q6NGnYjJaa	Im sorry that you have contracted this std, but no matter who you choose to have sex with if its not your husband never have sex without a condom. std symptoms may take time to develop so you may not know that you have it until weeks later.I definitely think you and your boy friend need to have a talk. It might hurt but you may want to get out of this relationship if he transmitted this disease to you. I Hope everything goes well... Good Luck!!!!|`|RLXP4kwnaa	I hate to say this, but the only way I think that could have happened. Is if he had sex with someone else. Im so sorry, If you try to talk to him about it he'll deni it all. Im so so so sorry.    : ( hoped I helped    xoxoxxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo|`|c7go9FI4aa	Depends on how long you have been going out. If you only just met him, maybe he already had STD's but it took a while before anything showed up on your end. Some STD's take months or even years to show symptoms (Chlamydia, Gonorrhoea) and sometimes they might not even show symptoms on some people (like your boyfriend) and might have passed it on to you with out him or you knowing.     Ask your doctor about the symptoms of the STD that you have (I don't know what BV is?) and whether it has any notable symptoms (like a rash or whatever!) and see what he says.|`|goP5E0Kxaa	WOW, what an *** hole. So many women get cheated on, was he your dream guy bad boy ?    Sorry  I have an envy of relationships, but seriously discover the causes of your STD, some STDS can be obtained from sharing sly via, touching things, or sorts of things. More likely than not though he has cheated on you.    I am sorry that this has happened to you, I am . I hope that you can get back to health soon. I would not have sex with him again for a while, see if he leaves. You are being used, because you let yourself be used. If he loves you it should not all be about sex, grow some standards woman.    Give it distance see if that guy leaves, he might catch on, so tell him you are thinking about absence , see if he freaks out . If he wants sex shortly after to try to swade you different then be strong, don't give in.    After all the guy could be diseased.|`|VjBciucZaa	SUE HIM|`|OAYaeW22aa	aybe he had sex wit someone else|`|lhMpqDS3aa	The symptoms could have been late, or, he cheated in between those two weeks. D: Sorry you got it, though. I trust my boyfriend but I think you should always wear condoms just in case.|`|sEwoF3ocaa	hmm yeah maybe he did have it with someone else
pcI25NXzaa	Idk how old you are, but personally i would say look, i love you mom and im sorry i cursed, hug her, then say i know you had a bad day at work but i don't understand why that has to be taken out on me from you not letting me do (whatever it is you were gonna do).|`|vi4JlnJvaa	Give her some time alone, maybe make her a cup of her fave tea - ask her if she wants to talk about her day (hopefully not!), or ask if there is anything you can do to help fix dinner when you get back from your friend's house......good luck honey.|`|DdEzv3NCaa	Give her time for her to start talking to you again. If you keep speaking she'll get annoyed and break free and you'll have another row (that's what happened to me!) okay?<br>  <br>  Thinking time is all she needs. <br>  <br>  Lol good luck xx
KPXwwwMMaa	If her husband is well enough to talk and communicate, he really should communicate to his parents to back off. he should tell them that if they don't start treating her better, immediately, that they would not be allowed to see their grandchild anymore! That will get the attention of most grandparents.<br>  <br>  And when your friend is home alone with the kids, she does not have to legally let the child's grandparents come into her home. She has to stand up for herself, but her husband should ultimately give the order to his parents.|`|4DDSD9Syaa	You need to step up. Take control of this situation. First off does the huddy even care about his wife? If not, you really can't do anything but to get your friend out of there. And if the hubby does care he just needs to grow some balls and tell off his parents, cause he is not living with them anymore and especially he has a wife that he choose to spend the rest of his life with.|`|SP59iAcmaa	Your friend has ALL the rights over the parents (in-laws).  So what if they say he was bewitched.  That should not stop her from getting him to a doctor and medical help!!!  If he gets worse/dies, she could be arrested for negligence!!!  Not the parents.<br>  <br>  She can also call the cops and have them meet her to get her phone back!
a984cQjKaa	tell her she can wait, she should be more responsible for her things.|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	Tell her you are not responsible for her. If she hadn't of forgot it, you guys wouldn't be in this mess in the first place. She can wait, she won't die.I bet next time she won't forget it.|`|AA11447210	It was her negligence that caused it to be left behind. While it would be appropriate for you to help get it to her as soon as possible, if you have other plans today already and can't do it, then she'll just have to wait. It's not your fault she left it behind...but do try to help get it back to her as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  In reverse, wouldn't you want yours back quickly?|`|20iKbSTFaa	just till her to get over it. it's not your fault she forgot it at your house. or be nicer and tell her you'll get it to her when you can. good luck|`|AA11506593	Your friend left here cell phone charger at your house and she's made a you?!?!<br>  <br>  Get a new friend.... this one needs to learn about responsibility!|`|hfqUp1IBaa	Tell her to come get it and leave it on the porch or in a mailbox!|`|YKCWTYRxaa	Its her fault she left it. Tell her to eff off and you will get it as soon as you can. She shouldn't be mad at you.
VP7KAe12aa	Yicks you need to tell her to get out of that relationship if her boyfriend his hitting her and not treating her good. You shouldn't of told her that you were going to Puerto Rico she may be upset that you lied and be affraid if you would lie to her all the time. Maybe you should explain to her how you feel and tell her you won't treat her badly that you only lied because you wanted her to think about it for a while. I don't know about if she wants to be only friends with you. If her boyfriend is hitting her it may make her feel useless and you wouldn't want to go out with her. Just tell her how you feel towards her. Make her feel like you could be the guy of her dreams.<br>  Goodluck...<br>  Summer

My point here is if your girl had sex behind your back with a mexican it was what she wanted ,she said yes to his advances,she said yes to going back to his shack, it was up to her to allow him to take her clothes off so if anything be mad at her and get rid of her! because as she is saying yes to him she is saying no to you!good luck and move on! on Oprah once she had a group of women who cheated on their better half,boyfriends etc.. and the one thing they all had in common was they did not feel guilty about what they did and they would do it again,this is what i found very strange and that was how many women would keep going back for more so i think once a woman cheat you might as well walk away because it could take them months to realize that they want you back because the wrong sex is so good!|`|p7Z5H8ftaa	when someone cheats the only thing to do is break up. that means they were willing to risk you guys breaking up which means they dont like you enough. Which means it can quite possibly happen again even if they say it wouldnt. tell her that when she decided it was okay to kiss him she also decided you werent special enough to stay faithful to, and you deserve better|`|Zjjl7hrOaa	a mexican?does that make a different wat race she cheated on you with<br>  <br>  she cheated get over it and leave her alone|`|hnnMVO39aa	the same thing you would do if she cheated on you with an american... dump the girl!|`|Y95mhtUnaa	pendejo lol.

Withholding sex, intimacy, and this hanging out with another guy, same thing happened to me.  Then she dumped me for one of these other guys.  Its been pretty hard on me, but she is getting along just fine with the new toys and gifts and sex.  You either want a long term exclusive relationship or you dont, if you do its gonna take work and compromise and communication from BOTH of you, some people think its worth it if its what they want, some dont.  Up to you, but dont expect your new guy to be any better in the long run.|`|y4wFTXlBaa	Sex doesn't make a relationship work, communication and respect does; therefore, you should end it.|`|HPtpfqFJaa	Dump the jerk and be with the guy thats a gentleman and makes you happy of course! Don't waste time in a dead-end relationship, we only live once, you will regret it if you stay and are fighting and miserable all the time! Live your life to the fullest and have fun. This guy clearly has lost his thing for you and you've lost it for him, so why bother trying to fix something that can't work.|`|MZWH11w1aa	Are you worth more than this?  That is what you need to ask yourself.  End the relationship.  Get your life in order and then start dating some good guys.  As far as wanting a baby, I have to tell you it makes me cringe.  I know you don't want one anymore, but you need to re-evaluate your thinking.  A baby should come when you are 1. married 2. financially stable 3. settled in a career (or able to stay home)  Anyone who intentionally does it sooner is just ignorant and selfish.  By the way, any man that won't wear a condom is a pig.|`|sZ1vyyiQaa	Two years is along time to let it go with out trying to make it work. Don't leave one relationship and jump into another one so fast. All guys are nice when u first start dating. Leave ur bf but slow down with the other guy. Don't want to make the same mistake twice
bwxWJ0nVaa	Give it time see where it goes I'm 22 years old and have been with my girlfriend for a year and a half and I have never been in love before this...but there were many times that i thought i was...he is very young to be in love so are you so my suggestion is just to give it time and see where you end up!|`|MZWH11w1aa	If you loved him you would know.  Trust me.  You are very young and at the age where you should be single.  13 is a little too young to be in a relationship, but my son is 13 and he has had a girlfriend for a couple of months too.  I think at this young age you should enjoy talking to different boys and liking a new one each week.  That's the fun of being young.  You should break up with your boyfriend.  Blame it on your parents or something.  Say that they don't want you dating someone so much older (which by the way I would kill my daughter for dating a 16 yo at 13).  Trust me, this is not the guy your going to spend the rest of your life with, so don't worry about "losing" him.  He's not really yours anyway.|`|6UgFvIqoaa	well lets put it this way. You guys actually You know..... Because thats how boys are. they wanna have you know and tell you they love you and they really dont. if he really loves you then you have to solve the problem. If you can, just remain as friends because you never know. and if you do love him, you might have to be careful. your the only one to control your feelings. You might break up and love someone else.  your young and need to be well awear. www.beingirl.com|`|a9LYDdT2aa	I do believe that your boyfriend has alternative motives telling you he loves you. Seeing that your younger than him, he believes if you think he loves you, you'll do exactly what he wants. I'm not trying to judge but when a 16 year old is with a 13 year old, he wants something. I know this from my past.|`|TZvZ7ZXJaa	I'm not sure if you're in love. I knew I was in love with my boyfriend about 3 months in. I'd say give it a little time, you're still young and you have time to sort things out. talk to him about it, tell him how you're feeling. Just don't let him rush you.|`|dmqiHVxsaa	Just tell him your not at that place yet, and see how the relationship rolls on if you don't want to break up with him that is. Hopefully he loves you enough to keep going with the relationship. You never know in a few more months you might feel that way too. Good luck!!! =)|`|13b04ed9f4bea5d86d3c03ebc05b3123aa	I have a friend in the same situation as you. He told her he loved her but he really didn't. I would not stay with him.

Good luck.|`|G2QNC22eaa	well for sure you have feelings for him other wise you would not be bothered on losing him ,<br>  you could try and ask him how he feels about you and when he tells you see if you feel the same way as he does about you <br>  <br>  <br>  ANSWER MINE PLEASE :)<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220074548AA3TA4k">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|4Ql5vKfraa	you're not emotionally ready, obviously. tell him you don't know if you love him because you don't even have a concept of what love IS<br>  just have fun for now :)|`|y4wFTXlBaa	All the help you'll need: <a href="http://ihatekaty.com/?id=2605975#6dzz5z54fsdq7ez78z8d" rel="nofollow">http://ihatekaty.com/?id=2605975#6dzz5z5...</a>|`|V0iGdZDSaa	your so young you don't have to be in love and that is fine. just be honest with him and tell that you guys maybe to slow things down a bit. be sincere and truthful. good luck|`|mTRnOIodaa	If you don't love him don't lie to him by pretending that only hurts the both of you!|`|4a935e7214c87d8ea74ee87e5ba46224aa	do it    do it|`|01kEoI0Oaa	break up with him|`|UHIscXDUaa	hi der....if ya wanna hear ma suggestion, u both jus be good frenz....n' tat too u r still an immature person to follow this kinda track....i suggest ya both to be only good frenz.....|`|sZ1vyyiQaa	You need to see what else is out there before u get that serious.|`|a917VeNIaa	just be friends, i mean if u dont really have feelings for him wats the point? and well if u dont want to lose him, ask him if he wants to be friends, if he really is inlove with you he'll be ur friend in the end.|`|POHWTDPRaa	If you only think you love him, you don't love him. If it was love you would know it for sure. But if you aren't into him after 6 months, it ain't gonna happen. Break up with him because right now you are wasting your time and his. And don't date anyone else for a while. You are doing yourself a disservice by trying to be older than you are. At 13, you are still a kid. Be a kid.|`|lYjweuZmaa	tell him that you aren't ready for love ...you'ree younger than him by a lot btw... 13 and 16 is kind of a big jump ( for me anyways) wellthat'ss your business andthat'ss not what you asked about so.. tell him youaren'tt ready for that kind ofcommitmentt just yet... good luck|`|p7Z5H8ftaa	Well take a good look at him from other peoples points of views.

You don't really figure it out till toward the end of high school. I'm a junior, and I just barely found out how love really feels. That junior high crap is just trying to prove you're more mature then you really are. The girl I'm in love with is my best friend, and she doesn't have feelings for me, but I don't care, I just want her to be happy, even if that means with another guy. She thinks Im trying to talk her out of the guys she likes cuz I want her to myself, but I'm trying to protect her cuz the guys she likes just want her for some action. They don't give a rats *** how she feels. I don't want her getting hurt. Hate to break it to you. What you're feeling, is just a crush. <br>  <br>  Just break up with him. No relationship lasts untill about 18 or 20. Stay single, don't get tied down by a boyfriend. Life's too short. Wait till high school, or better yet, when you graduate untill you get a BF.
DzAFT8VDaa	I think you were right to say 'leave it alone.' Name calling and disrespecting your partner is never right. Your HUSBAND needs to grow up. He can't beat you into submission to make you think he is right. I think you were hurt and did what was right for you at the time by leaving and sleeping at your cousin's.<br>  <br>  You have a true problem on your hands because your husband is more interested in being right than in being heard and listening to you. I think you guys (more specifically him) needs counseling. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	You shouldn't have left probably.  My fiance and I have an agreement to never leave the house or go to bed if we are still mad.  Either we talk it out until we both feel better or we go in to different rooms to cool off until we can make nice.  Walking out on the problem is a bad way to go, but it's not the end of the world.  It just extends the problem instead of resolving it.  I know we are all sometimes guilty of not listening and wanting to prove that we are right, I know I've done it at the expense of my partner.  I think you both owe each other an appology, if you go in to the room cool headed and appologise he'll likely do the same and things will go back to normal :)<br>  <br>  Name calling is also never acceptable, once it gets to that point nothing productive is coming from the conversation, but just going in to another room usually works.  Also.. I've never heard someone call someone a noodle.. I know it wasn't done nicely, but I must admit I giggled a little at the idea..<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I understand your desire to leave to get away from him, but it also shows a weakness in your desire to maintain a relationship.  It shows that your willing to bail out when the going gets rough.  Apologize to him about leaving, then you both need to come up with a cool down word, that you can use in any argument, as soon as someone uses it, you both retreat to a different place in the house to cool off.  Give that a try and hopefully he will be man enough to honor your request.  Good luck.|`|B12E4rYiaa	You may have over reacted but we all do that at some point don't beat yourself over it. Going to the couch would have been good enough or to another bedroom. Next time try to not let some small argument get blown out of proportion and if it does try to maintain your cool and think rationally not act out of emotion.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	Doesn't matter right or wrong, you did it, you learned from it, just forget about it.  Don't apologize just move on.<br>  <br>  I've gotten into those ruts before and there's no good way out.

seMXuWwxaa	It's okay, it's happened to me before.  Get out there and meet new people!!  You may not be the outgoing type, but if you have any sort of extracurricular activities (I'm assuming you're still in school) you can meet people that share your likes!!  Go to concerts, go to church, get involved in a youth group.  All sorts of things can help you!!  And don't worry, you aren't the only one who's felt that way.|`|0PkFuZMwaa	dust yourself off and start all over again.they wasn't your friend from the beginning. friends are forever. watch you will soon have real friends just open your heart.|`|mIY4ev9waa	Well, how exactley did they abandon you?<br>  <br>  If they said it right to your face: This has happened to me before, if they said it right to your face, then there not true friends. I say you find another friend, i just ignore those ones when you walk by them.<br>  <br>  If you realized from their actions: Hmm, try to find a way that they will HAVE to talk to you, like: call their cell, ask them how they are, and blah blah blah,, and then at the end ask them why they have been doing these 'actions' to you. Another way is, you can ask your teacher to pair you up with her,, it can be any class, but the important thing is that you have to work together in whatever subject your gonna be paired in.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped! :)

iPNOVR6Gaa	Unless he also sees it as cheating, apologizes, and presents you with a workable plan for preventing himself from looking at it anymore in the future, you can't forgive him.  So, ask him to do those things.<br>  <br>  Good luck with that, though, because your attitude is highly indicative of a control freak.  There is no way I would agree that looking at porn is cheating, and I'm glad I married a woman who doesn't have such a strange belief.  I suspect you'd feel a lot happier and more relaxed if you stopped expending so much effort to control your husband.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	You're very young, aren't you?<br>  Guys like looking, no big deal unless you MAKE it a big deal.<br>  <br>  Would you rather he go to a strip club & get lap dances?|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Listen, a lot of people are telling you that he's not cheating.<br>  <br>  HE IS CHEATING!<br>  <br>  Study morals and ethics and figure it out.<br>  <br>  Now to you I would say that he needs to live up to his moral and legal commitment to you ie your wedding vows. Forgive him? Don't. He needs to be aware that what he has done is wrong.<br>  <br>  As a side note: Adult (mature) love is 'conditional' and you both have a legal and binding agreement. Love for a child is 'unconditional'. There is a difference. You can forgive a child, and help them learn, but a husband is supposed to be 'grown up already'.|`|G02cCLXJaa	You are correct. The marriage vows specifically prohibit this type of behavior. They do it for a reason. For a married man to look at another woman's naked body, whether for real, on paper, or film, is just wrong. His covenant is to hold you alone in that esteem.<br>  <br>  Pornography is a highly addictive behavior. If he is willing, there is a software program put out by Promise Keepers referenced in my source below. It keeps track of every site that has been visited on the computer. You, if you were his covenant partner would then have access to this information. The online software also flags websites that are of concern.<br>  <br>  If you husband does not consider this behavior to be a problem, you will have to decide whether to live with his deception or divorce him.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, he will accept that it is wrongful behavior within a marriage covenant. I would then recommend that you get some marriage counseling to work on the issues of trust.<br>  <br>  Pastor John|`|iQqsdl5yaa	how do you figure it is cheating?  He is merely watching a screen, he is not talking to these women, he is not physical with these women, do you think it is cheating if you watch a woman on TV and you see her boobs or she is half or fully naked and he is there?  the only way to move on with your marriage is to grow up and not be so sensitive towards this subject...it is only on the computer screen...he does not know these women, he will never know these women, he is married to you and loves you.  about 99.9 % of men watch porn at some point in their lives whether they are married or not and same goes for women...its a  part of life.  Deal with it!|`|q791er1naa	Well, its going to continue to happen.  Men look at porn.  Its only natural.  Do you think he is going to be faithful when he has to look at the same body and face, EVERY single night for the rest of his life? Probably not.  I know it sounds brash, but its the truth.  Its not cheating, and if you cant accept that then you will never be able to forgive him.|`|68ba39b41ac6268adc7bf60c1cad1538aa	I think you should sit down & tell him how you feel. I also think it is cheating even if it is just looking. It says in the bible that lusting is the same as committing adultery. Of course, the world will tell you that's not true. I hope you have God in your life & that you will lay this burden upon Him. If your husband is truly sorry, he should ask for your (& God's) forgiveness & turn away from doing it any longer. This is a serious matter that can ruin your marriage & your self-esteem. If he is truly sorry, you will need strength to forgive him & know it's forgiven. You will then need to let it go. I will have you both in my prayers.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	Though I feel you are acting irrationally to the "incident" I have to say you need to cultivate a more forgiving and understanding personality or your life let alone your marriage will be lived in misery.  Forgiveness is the foundation of most religions even.  If you can't forgive something such as this you aren't living your life to its full potential.  You forgive simply by trying...so begin with your own internal statement that you are hurting yourself more than anyone else since it's hurting you more than others in your life.|`|93ix6nyvaa	If you want to forgive your husband for looking at porn, then you need to learn to let it go. It is not cheating, and it is nothing close to cheating. It is so very natural for a guy to be looking at porn regardless of his marital status. Just accept his normal behavior and let it go.|`|Wpulf29Maa	Just try to forget about it. Act like it never happened. I'm the same way too. My husband asked me if we could watch porn one day......I said I'm not like that. It's disgusting and I think sex should be between only two people. So, anyway, just keep in mind that you love him no matter what and you want to be with him so just try your best not think about it and upset yourself.|`|mMBzpldbaa	how about watching it with him and quiting being such a prude? people who say porn is cheating are pathetic. we watch it all the time together. it gives us more ideas for better and more challenging positions =]|`|gjaPNWbTaa	Good lord.  All he's gonna do is get better at hiding it.<br>  <br>  Go ahead. Divorce him.  Your next husband will look at porn too.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	You sound controlling, he's a grown man and can decide what he want's to watch. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean he can't watch it.|`|MuVKeK8faa	Watch it with him!  I think porn is funny!|`|XukScWE3aa	Not enough info .Well it depends on what kind of porn it is.  Some is good and some is not.  Is this the only time he see's a woman truly nude and dose the things that he would like to have done to him self. Are you the one that is causing the problem. Do you walk a round in the house in the nude. Are you good in bed. Or are you a dead head. I have been with a lot of woman that think they are good in bed and could not even tell they where there. So are you the problem not him because you do not take care of his needs. You have to forgive your self first.|`|mfbKe04Xaa	I feel you on that.....it is cheating....you need to make it clear to him that you don;t like it and if he dont stop...do what you need to do...it kills me that people are so acceptable of it....stand your ground with it....it's wrong...and that's it|`|ba68b7d25060c3e787c80b35c1ab4f14aa	dude! u r trippin girl.. porn is not cheating. its just a guy thing! if anything u2 should watch it. cheating is when he actually is or has had sex with someone other than u.. get real n get over it cuz u r over reacting. porn is porn hes just watching. oh and if u catch him masturbating , thats normal too! dont push ur husband away over something this small and pretty silly. but thats all u. ur the one getting mad.. i promise u he is never going to stop n ur just going to make him promise something he cant and wont keep and thats when secrets r going to happen n he might even end up cheating on u with a "real" person.. so just get over it n have some great sex!... while watching it, it should turn u both on.. u'l  learn n enjoy
3iNobwVraa	That's awful.  Although it is unnecessary, I have always felt if lashing out is going to happen, it should ALWAYS be directed at the other adult.  Period.  Honestly, if someone was mentally abusing (kind of trying to define/understand this term, these days) my child they would have a pretty serious problem on their hands.  And, it WOULD stop.  You do NOT tolerate or allow abuse of a child--on any level.<br>  <br>  Your mom should get the girls in counseling, immediately, and she should discuss her specific concerns about their dad.  The counselor will be able to help her a. determine the severity of the situation, b. help your sisters emotionally deal with the situation, and c. validate any action that is required to prevent further abuse.  I would also speak openly with each of their teachers so they can be apprised of what may be affecting them emotionally, and can keep an eye/ear out for anything that may be relevant.  Often, teachers are a tremendous ally, because they have a different vantage point than the parent, and their insight can sometimes prove invaluable.<br>  <br>  You sound like you are a good sister for trying to get involved.  Stay present, and good luck to you.|`|ymWkGqm7aa	Your mother can take your step-father to court. She will most likely get custody of your siblings because of your step-fathers drug-taking.

Yes, it will get very annoying at first but when she stops saying like it will all be worth it.|`|QGy0fBRJaa	Reminder her of other words to use that have the same meaning as "like" and let her know that it gets annoying when people use the same words all the time.  Tell her that people would focus on the word "like" and not really be listening to what she has to say.|`|McJ18CN0aa	Treat her as if it was a curse word and scold her when she does. I can't even say 'freaking' in my house cuz my mother doesn't like that. She calls my name and glares at me when I do say it. I haven't said it in weeks.|`|uJ88gPgQaa	Just explain to her what you just said.

Get it now! It will only get worse.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could even have her learn a new vocab word each day (maybe at breakfast) and challenge her to use it at least 4 times during the day.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	Unless you correct her, she will not even know she is doing it. Keep on it. She is talking like that because her peers do. She is going to hear her friends all day every day. You will need to bug her till she bursts in order to break this habit. Don't give up.|`|qeVqBMVraa	darling shes still a child..<br>  shes still learning..<br>  children use words to explore intellectually<br>  let her grow up, dont try changing her..<br>  <br>  its only temporary, she would grow out of it|`|QIYHApEkaa	I agree with lisa g. keep on her and if that doesn't work start punishing her everytime she does it, you don't have to beat her but take away certin privliges and use grounding too
sCBJHVtzaa	So why do you care if she likes you or not if it's clear you don't like her?  Just don't give her the impression that you do or she will like you more, just be a friend and if she goes too far then back off.|`|p7Z5H8ftaa	yeah tell her its kinda annoying how she always hangs around but then make it playful by being like "but your starting to grow on me lol" like through text.

If you want to keep a friendship with her but just not romantic.  I'd talk about another girl and how you think she's pretty and stuff. She will get the point with out you having to maybe directly hurt her feeling|`|YgSrgTFzaa	I think she likes you but tell her in a kind way to give you some space.

It will clear things up. If you're not looking for a relationship with her, then tell her before she thinks you "like" her back.

p7Z5H8ftaa	wow dude. you just dont get it. you showed a serious disrespect to her by making her pose nude when she said no. and she trusted you, thats why she came over and drank and you took advantage of her, doing what she said she didnt want to do. Just that alone is enough to make you look like the biggest creep in the world. but taking her virginity? Shes 24! shes been saving that for someone she loves and now this "creep" goes and gets her drunk and fucks her. Seriously. I want to answer this question but it sounds like your just being manipulative and your just trying to finda way to get her again.. I dont know if I wanna help you, Im not trying to make you feel bad but truthfully I dont even feel like I can trust you. I think you need to learn from this mistake. what you did was dirty, and it should never happen again, you kinda deserve this.<br>  <br>  On the other hand if she lost her virginity to you then the only thing that would make her feel better is if she ended up with you, so im doing this for her. Tell her truthfully you love her. Tell her truthfully you are the sorriest bastard for hurting her so bad. Tell her you will do anything to make it up to her. Tell her youll leave her alone, because if thats whatll make her happy thats what you want, but you will always love her and always regret what you did. Then apoligize and prepare for the worst, cuz thats the best you can do.|`|ENZVi0Ptaa	Sometimes there is nothing you can do...this is one of those times.<br>  <br>  I think you should leave her alone.

Buy her a gift and send a note with and and just leave her be. After about a week, ask to speak with her in a mature conversation and if she doesn't listen, I apologize, but forget her. It wasn't even that serious (I mean I'm still a virgin and would hate to lose my virginity while my mind wasn't sober and I would kick that man's ***), but if it hurt her that much, you CANNOT turn into a stalker and you will only make her pull out a restraining order and make it a hell of a lot worse.|`|aaoWVDxMaa	That is really disrespectful to her. The fact that you made her drunk to use it to your advantage. No wonder she no longer wants you in her life. If you haven't apologised, then do so immediately, whether it's a card....phone...face to face. I say FACE TO FACE because what you did is really really awkward to her and I'm sure it's affecting her. When you said she agreed to pose nude, okay, that was her choice, but the fact that you took things the next step instead of going professional, I think that is where she was upset. Either way, you should apologise to her. And yeah, even though you love her, she may not feel the same way, no wonder she's not responding to your calls either. :S|`|wzAhxdpKaa	You may very well love her, but you certainly love yourself more.

I don't know if she'll ever forgive you for that (since she was a virgin and you took that away from her), but if I were you I'd give her what she wants and respect her decision. If she feels the same way for you, then she'll come back, if not then it's pretty clear that she only saw you as a friend ever since.|`|rvCbwX1Paa	First of all getting someone drunk and taking advantage of them is RAPE.

NuUdCz0Laa	Okay J.J., I have waited a few hours to answer this question.  As a sun worshiper and former nudist, my advise to any new or younger nudist is to buy lots of high powered sun screen.  With that said, just go to the colony and strut your stuff, and tell your husband to keep his thong on to hide that monster.  Tell him it is for the protection of all the others, they do not want people tripping of that thing.  He will be so proud that he will go with a smile on his face.

We have clubs and resorts.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you try visiting an aanr sanctioned resort. You can find a list of some 270 of them at aanr.com <br>  <br>  The only way your husband would be rejected from one of our resorts (because we are tolerant and inclusive) is if he had a "prince albert" and if that is the case, you can call around, there are some (not many) resorts that will allow jewelry of that type.  Chances are any club you visit that is not comfortable with the appendage can refer you to another that may find it ok.<br>  <br>  aanr sanctioned clubs generally are "family oriented" and I'm sure you understand that certain types of adult piercings are not really compatible with young people (kids).  We want everyone to feel comfortable when enjoying their nude activities. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps you with your question and I wish you many days of sunshine.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	This is obviously fake because nudist communities do not have policies of accepting only attractive members.

If she gets mad, then im afraid she is just wanting to live off of you anyway. Even though you are both young, she has taken on adult responsibilities in marriage and needs to step up.

The longer an abusive relationship goes on, the more damaging it can be to your self-esteem and self-worth. It sounds like you don't want to be in this relationship anyway, so cut yourself loose. If you love him (I mean truly love him) then things will work out after you work on yourself and get that confidence you need. If it's meant to be, it'll be. Otherwise, you already know the answer. All you have to do is follow through with it. You'll be ok. If you're afraid of being alone, find comfort in your friends and yourself. Do something that you've always wanted to do. Volunteer for your favourite organization. Pick up a new hobby. Take a fun class (Yoga, pottery, whatever you prefer). Prove to yourself that you deserve better than what you're going through and that you are an independent woman. All you have to do is recognize your strengths, and confidence will come with every step you take to take care of yourself.

When you stop ALLOWING them to treat you like this.    Think of it this way. Could he have cheated on you if you had stopped seeing him when you first noticed his lying behaviour?  Could he have used you if you didn't answer his calls?    Let me simplify it further. Women don't naturally 'choose' to go for losers or bad boys. But you can continue to envoke the same behaviour if you let it happen. Don't waste your time on someone if they treat you badly at all. If he loved and respected you he wouldn't lie, cheat, use, steal, or abuse you in anyway.    You're hoping the next one will be different? Well, make sure he is. At the first sign of any dodgy behaviour- stop seeing him! Don't wait and see if it was a one off and he turns out to be a prince. A good man isn't going to act like that, and if you keep letting men treat you like that, it will keep happening.|`|UdUNvtIyaa	You'll find the right person - but not now , not yet.

NJVm6dTiaa	For us, I would say technology has been helpful, because we really love keeping in touch with each other through texting/cell phone contact when he's at work, especially when he's working very late at night and I miss him. It would never be a replacement for hearing his voice or being with him though. <br>  I think you have accurately identified that in your case, it is not technology that is causing the problem; it is the lack of time spent together. Texting can be fun and intimate, but it seems that in your case it has become dry and unsatisfying. I completely agree with you that you do need to hear one another and have the opportunity for much more time spent together in dialogue. It's sad that your husband is failing to recognise that the time apart and the lack of real, satisfying communication is creating a barrier between you. I do hope you can eventually reorganise your schedules to spend more time together. I understand how much of an aching need the absence of a partner creates. My husband has recently decided to undertake a different shift because several days were elapsing in which the children were not seeing him at all. I hope your husband will also come to see that his relationship with you needs to be nurtured, and he must make that a priority. It seems that you are willing to do so.|`|y9CgveCGaa	I think it is mildly beneficial.  I just got back from a business trip.  Having the cell phone is nice.

My husband and I don't have the problem of working opposite schedules (although he does work a lot), so we get to spend lots of time at home together. Keeping this in mind, I would say that technology definitely helps, because it's very convenient to text or e-mail throughout the day if one of us needs to ask something; plus, it's way more private than phone calls in the office. But yeah, if we didn't see much of each other, I can see how we could start drifting apart - but I don't know if technology per se would be a contributing factor, or if it would simply become a self-reinforcing circle: we don't see each other much, so we drift apart, and as we drift apart there's less motivation to make an effort to spend time together. I feel that even if you take away computers, cell phones, etc, working opposite schedules and not seeing much of your spouse is a tough situation to be in.|`|IXskJPlVaa	Technology is just a tool and it depends on the user whether he/she makes good use or bad.

Yeah, sure its hard, but in the long run, I'd much rather just have that to share with one person. Its hard to explain, but its just kind of a relief.

5QeDCBZDaa	What your feeling now, is the most normal feeling in the world. Of coarse you feel depressed! A mother is a really important figure in any ones life! And it sounds to me she was REALLY important to you. I know you don't want to see one but a therapist is the best thing for you. You are dealing with a mount load of pain, you need help and the only way your gonna get by this is by talking about it. Have you talked to your siblings? you didn't mention how they felt? Maybe you should talk to them as well. They are probably going through the same thing as you. And your father is he alive? If he is then by far go over to him and talk this through him. Im really sorry to hear this about some one who obviously cares about there mum a lot, but really you need to get someone to talk to.  You also might want to take up some hobbies.  Try getting out of the house.|`|JdmwlvSRaa	Oh **** I hope that never happens to my mom. It will happen some day but i hope it doesn't.<br>  <br>  i am sorry to hear that.

I think this could be something to do with your self esteem.  Stop panicking, just be yourself.   If you start acting like that, he will get fed up and you wont do anything any favours.  Just let him know that you are there if he needs you and thats all that needs to be said.|`|sEwoF3ocaa	i dont know|`|iG0nAZKGaa	Be patient if he has issues he probably thinks he needs to handle them himself(guys are like that)just let him know that you care n if he wants to talk or needs you you'll be there.
cGbTJobeaa	How do you get your ex to recognize boundaries?  Easy...by setting firm boundaries and not blurring the lines.<br>  <br>  Quit having your ex husband provide for you by doing stuff for you.  That's for your husband to take care of NOT your ex husband. How would you feel if your husband's ex-gf/wife/whatever came into your house and cooked dinner for your family on a recurring basis? I bet you wouldn't like that at all.  So...quit having your ex be your provider.<br>  <br>  Your ex should not be coming into your home.  When it is time for his visitation, he should stand outside the door or wait in the car. You should not be inviting him into the house long enough that he has time to take his jacket off...especially when your husband isn't home.  You are not obligated to have a 30 minute conversation with him every time he comes to pick up or drop off your daughter. You can be nice without being so nice that boundaries are crossed or blurred.<br>  <br>  Limit conversation to your child. If he veers off and starts talking about something else, don't answer him and direct the conversation back to the child.<br>  <br>  BTW, the answer to a personal question is:  "that's private." No further information or explanation is necessary.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	You share a child. You should treat each other with respect. Show your child the right way to be. What you can do is talk to him.

You are not respecting your current husbands wishes.  He feels left out.  You could lose him.  Your ex and you share a child.  NOT A HOUSEHOLD.  He should not be allowed to just "drop over".  And you need to face the fact that either you are still in love with him or you risk losing the man you do love.  You love having both sides to the middle and are acting as though it is about your child.  NO NO NO.  Grow up.|`|AA10065812	*** Did you even consider that in this economy that perhaps he's concerned with where you are financially and how that may affect the child if the economy completely collapses?  <br>  <br>  My ex-wife and I have no children, but I ask how they are do, and what steps they are taking in the event things get all bollixed up.  Last December, she told me that her boyfriend of the last 12 years said he wanted to consider buying a large house for them.  I told her how to convince him otherwise.  In January he had a heart attack.  He had a blockage, though he's big on exercise and healthy food.  <br>  <br>  Being that my own heart's not in good shape, after his operation and he was feeling better, I spoke to him and said that if he up and died, leaving her alone, I was going to kick his butt from here to eternity in the next life.|`|goY0JHzlaa	Your current husband needs to understand that this man is the father of your child. There for, you will have a relationship with him concerning your child. There is nothing wrong with attempting to be polite. You and your child's father should be able to communicate without fighting when it comes to your child. Your child needs this. Your current husband needs to come to terms with his jealousy. Talk with him and tell him that you need to have a peaceful relationship with your ex for the sake of you child.|`|W0qFAIVuaa	All I hopped for was her to raise my daughter with a little common sense.Let me see,teenage girl.Maybe go to school ,do homework,don't get pregnant at sixteen.So far the X is zero and three.|`|tZkHHy5jaa	Sounds like you and your ex might be making out. That is why your husband is not to fond of the relationship. What do you want to happen?|`|rLLyJtqNaa	Remember this person is your ex and he's an ex for a reason.  He's your past and your husband is your present (and priority).<br>  <br>  Your job in this equation is to ensure that your ex has access to your child; not to be friends.  It's alright to be amicable, but it's not alright to allow anyone disrespect your family and home (no matter how subtle).<br>  <br>  Make your home and family unavailable to this manipulator.<br>  <br>  From now on, he will pick up your child in a neutral zone.<br>  <br>  Get a relative, friend, or neighbor to function as an intermediary.  Have your ex pickup the child from one of them.<br>  <br>  Should he ask why or what's going on, you can always say you have an engagement, plans, etc.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Being nice/civil with your ex is important.  But he has no right to ask you about your finances.  Being nice does not include sharing personal information that makes you uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  This is not about your ex recognizing boundaries.  This is about your inability to differentiate between being nice and being a pushover.
U5zcbHuZaa	Don't know. I wish I had a chat room to talk to my wife, we are not in same place right now and have not seen each other for awhile and still need to finalize our marriage even (we're kind of half-married right now -- we accept each other as married, at least I do, but no nikkah, for which I can't find any requirement in the Qur'an), but she is too Muslimah, she still thinks she cannot send me an email and yet she can provide no Qur'anic evidence for that (neither has anyone else). I don't know, I think there are some Muslim marriage sites out there you can meet Muslimahs interested to develop loving relationship, but I have not tried any of them of course.|`|6zblh7Tiaa	vs? looking to argue?
ca106532e616edadb064105bc89011e7aa	It appears that you have harbored resentment throughout the years because of his no care attitude about marriage. What this did was devalue the meaning and so it made you lose interest. If he wants to marry you he is going to have to convince you that his image of marriage has changed. Be open about how you feel. Let him know how much he has discouraged you from viewing marriage in a romantic love that bonds two people by the vows they make to love and cherish each other forever. For him to have discounted it has a mere contract is something he needs to change or he will not be in a serious state of mind when and if he does make his vows. Talk to him and get it all out in the open. Good luck to you!|`|10knD5g0aa	After 11 years i think you owe it to him to at least be honest.. tell him the same as you have explained it here.. it might cause heart ache but at least its honest|`|QRSRJ7U1aa	You two really do need to sit down and talk.  Bring him close to you as your friendship will allow.  Tell him what you saw in him in the early years and how you made the decision to have children by him even tho he didn't seem to want to be legally married to you.  And then tell him why that desire to become a legal family has changed.  I don'tunderstand what your real reasons are but before you begin this conversation you need to examine them. No one's perfect. And it is time to stop being surprised about this. The question is, Why should you take this bundle of faults over some other unknown bundle of faults? Or maybe you dont want to ever marry.    Do you think the relationship will not last and that it will just be a sticky mess down the road?  Do you not want him to have any more voice or control of your decisions about the children?  Is it based on financial considerations such as the mortgage on the house or the titles to the cars?  I am not saying you need to be absolutely honest with him about your reasons but you need to have some good reason that you can give to him for the sake of explaining the situation to your children in the future.  This is an important decision and your kids will ask why at some point.  Plan now what you will be telling them then.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	"I am not having anymore kids with you and I don't want to get married.  I am happy the way things are".|`|GeruGGOQaa	Just like you told us.  Men do best with short simple direct answers.  We don't do well with hints, tips and long drawn out statements.  Be simple and direct with men and you'll get the best results possible.
aw23GfR4aa	now I deal with this all the time, my fiance as sweet as he is has some crazy anger problems, i say to just try to get him into therapy, someone different to talk to. An outside person who would be completely unbias. We are planning on doing it. His father has always been this way, so I know exactly where he gets it from, but contrary to what every other woman says, I also know from his father's actions and talks with his mother that he doesn't know about, I know his father has never laid a finger on a woman, and I know my fiance of four years has yet to ever lay a finger on me. So just because they get angry doesn't mean they will beat you. Not every person with a temper is out to beat you up. It gets annoying becuase he looks like a little bratty child when he does it, but he doesn't really know what to do otherwise. I'd say to just try for therapy, maybe even go with him. That's what I'm going to do to make it more comfortable. It may take a while, it did with me, but now he says he really does want to help it better without drugs. Hope this helped.. ;)|`|MkErhX7Haa	Sounds like your family sees the situation clearer than you do.  I know it's hard to respect your parents opinion given the way that you feel about them, but there are some definite red flags that you don't seem to be seeing.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	yes his family history could be the cause of his anger issues.    you have 5 red flags that you are involved with a potential abuser.  1.  he has a hot temper that he doesn't control  2.  he damages property when he's angry  3.   1 and  2 combined w/ the fact that he is a law enforcement officer.  The brotherhood will cover for their own in domestic violence situations until it becomes obvious that you are in real danger and often by that time, it's too late and your family is left dealing w/ a Drew Peterson situation--you're missing, he's claimed you ran off with some man and he's divorcing you in your absence and engaged to marry someone else.  4.  he's always so nice and over attentive and showering you with gifts after a blow up.  5.  He has a father who was violent and he witnessed and possibly experienced that violence.    What you have going for you is that he lets you walk away when the two of you are in the heat of an arguement.  When he stops letting you leave, that's when you are in real danger and need to end the relationship.    Listen to your family's and friend's objections to him.  Seriously consider them.  Don't run into auto knee-jerk defense mode.  Really HEAR what it is that they are trying to tell you.      DO NOT MARRY OR MOVE IN WITH HIM UNTIL HE TAKES ANGER MANAGEMENT CLASSES.  If you're already living with him then make anger management one of your requirements for him to complete BEFORE you get married.    I've also attached a link so you can check out other red flags for domestic violence. And the cycle of violence. Read through them and if you see more red flags that describe your relationship with him then RUN, do not stop, do not pass go, get the h*ll away from him ASAP.  Your very life could depend on it.    If you don't see anything other than what you've listed already, then stand firm and demand that he seek counseling to deal with his anger and his childhood trauma    sidebar:  when I lived in Virginia, 25% of our domestic abuse cases that we saw and were reported were military or law enforcement wives and girlfriends.  These are 2 occupations w/ high incidents of  suffering post traumatic stress and PTS makes many people more prone to violence.  Combined w/ his already low violence threshold, you could be just a victim waiting to happen.|`|pMsMx817aa	i like the best answer that was chosen the last time you asked this   :)|`|sGP6s7uraa	Police have always had the bad reputation of having anger issues and abusive problems.  When I was in the dating world, I ALWAYS steered clear of them because you just never knew.  He's angry because cops are taught to be hard asses in the Academy.  It's unfortunate but I'm pretty sure this is why he's a hot head.|`|9AUmp5jWaa	He needs anger management.  He does not know how to control his anger which is not a good thing.  Just because he does something nice after he acts like an A$$ does not mean a thing.  If he doesn't get professional help for his anger, who knows what may happen later on.  Don't let the good things he does shade the not so good things.  There's nothing wrong with getting help for an issue that could be a problem later on in your relationship.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	It sounds like your fiance is emotionally abusive, and you are so blinded by love that you can't see it.  But when more than just a few friends and family members have a problem with the same guy, it's kind of a red flag.  I dated a guy in high school that I thought was wonderful, but all my friends and family members basically told me that they didn't want to be in my life anymore if I was with him.  I finally realized that there must be something wrong if everyone I care about didn't like him.  Rather than just walk away next time he snaps at you or displays temper, stand your ground and tell him that you refuse to be treated that way, and he will either need to shape up or kiss you goodbye.  You're setting yourself up for a lifetime of pain if you let him treat you like that, just because he's "so gorgeous."  Also, you say he treats you well, but it doesn't sound that way to me at all.  He sounds controlling, manipulative, and dangerous.  Maybe if you can persuade him to go to an anger-management class, it would help him out with the issues that so many people besides you find problematic.
HTfGZTUyaa	If your father is having that much trouble finding work and really cares about you, don't you think your father would rather have you not go through the same thing?  Finish school, get an education so you can get a decent, hopefully stable job.  You can be there for your father in other ways, call and make sure he's doing ok, send a card or something to lift his spirits.  As a parent, I would rather have my children make good use of their opportunities and get the education that will last them a lifetime.|`|AA11280073	Stay in school. He is an adult and he needs to figure out how to handle his dilemma. By leaving school, you will limit your opportunities and there is nothing much you can do to help him. When you graduate and get a good job, perhaps you can assist him financially. Make sure he is not using you, however.|`|VhrUtQc2aa	I know how hard it is to hear your dad being depressed and all but this is your chance to grow your knowledge in more education which could help you get into more and bigger opportunities.    Its for free who knows if you would get another chance in free education.    i say stay and study     your dad will find a way to solve everything and who knows you could finish and work  and then you could send money to your dad and go on holidays when you can/want.
QRnVLT6laa	I honestly think you have some self-esteem issues.  You claim you want to be alone and promiscuous, but it probably is because you have some underlying fear of being rejected that you are unaware of (well you are somewhat aware of it when you said "I want someone to love me for me, but it never happens".  You can do one of two options if you're really serious about getting help for your addiction..<br>  <br>  A) Seek therapy.  Speak to a psychologist and they might help you overcome your addiction by getting to the root of everything<br>  <br>  B) Go to rehab.  Sex can be an addiction..and rehab facilities do help people overcome their addiction.  I can't recommend a therapist, but I have a webpage which I'm leaving in the source that provides a detailed overview of sex addiction and how you can get help for it.  Hope this helps and good luck!|`|mJbwemH8aa	yr normal, dont worry, come and c some here<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ..|`|d3IcVDNFaa	Wow! I have the same type of problem, but since the past 2 years of being single, I started liking this dude out of my recent casual encounters. All the guys say I seem like a player, but honestly I know it's not lady like. You have to find the right guy for you with the potential that you need from him.|`|3ISGQ4Csaa	Just because you have a lot of sex doesn't mean you have an addiction to it. Being in a relationship doesn't mean that you're going to have horrible sex. If it's boring then play some games or try role-playing.|`|sCBJHVtzaa	So just find a man whore that also wants a relationship. or something.|`|OyWVqe23aa	get a boyfriend and invite other people to have sex.|`|MZWH11w1aa	I don't think your crazy or anything, but you do have issues.  The best advice I can give it to seek the help of a counselor/therapist.  Find a good one that you feel is very open.  Maybe a female so you don't sleep with him...sorry just kidding....kind of.  If you have health insurance it should pay for at least most of your therapy, if not then I still think you should invest in yourself.  I feel like you should face your problems head on instead of brushing them under the rug.|`|AA10764251	I had the same problem but got away from it.<br>  Im going to tell you a story that made me stop being promiscuous. <br>  i was 15 years old and i LOVED sex. i couldn't get enough of it. i would sleep with a different guy a week. Well one month i missed my period and then the next month the same thing. i got really scared and then found out that i was pregnant. i didn't know who the father was because the week that i got pregnant i slept with two different guys. i got really depressed and i wouldn't eat. then about two months later i miscarried. my body wasn't nutrition and  enough for the baby to live inside of me. after that i ha vent had sex since. im just afraid that im going to get pregnant. <br>  this changed my life completely and it opened my eyes to the things that i was doing.<br>  i hope it dint get that far for you but if you dont want anything like that happen to you i suggest that you slow down a Little bit. <br>  the little thing about this story is that i used a condom and i didn't sleep with the guys a second time. i dont think that i ever have slept witht the same guy twice. <br>  please i hope this will help you with your problem<br>  if i could get over my problem then i hope that you can as well.|`|sD7d3Wgpaa	wow! this is A lot to answer to lol but anyways.<br>  <br>  you may not be ready to be in a full out relationship yet, maybe to make you feel better kinda get to know the person before you sleep with them. like ask a few questions about them, maybe find out what their name is...lol<br>  but otherwise just make sure to use birth control and a condom you dont want diseases. and if you really arent ready for a baby which i dont think you are if you arent ready for a relationship use spermicide also you can never be to carefull<br>  but with the lonely part i cant really help you because you have to be ready to be in a relationship, but i can tell you maybe get some real close friends that may fill in some of that empty hole.<br>  <br>  hope theis helps you out.<br>  and good luck with that all.<br>  be safe!! =)

If you think there could be some issues then just talk to Bob and tell him you kinda like Bill and you want to see where it goes with him and that it isn't you trying to make him jealous or something.|`|p7Z5H8ftaa	no this is perfect. If bob gets mad then you can tell him you are honestly sorry, but he had his chance and he didnt chose you. If he does mind then tell him you hope hes happy its with his brother who he knows instead of some random guy. Tell him you still wanna be tight, but he cant expect you to wait around for him. but dont tell him this stuff until ur sure u and his brother are gonna have a thing|`|lSag21xbaa	you cant exactly "help" who you like, and you like bill for a reason. im sure bob wouldnt mind because he moved on, so why shouldnt you?? just ask bob be like would it bother you if i have feelings for your brother (bill) see what he says before you and bill get to serious :)|`|Q49EEdzbaa	No that wouldnt be wrong because he didnt feel any guilt for telling you he wanted to be with someone else. i would go for it, what do have to lose. if he would get mad (but why) it would be for jealousy of the brother not for you. He might just get jealous seeing you smiling and having a good time with someone else|`|Xu71saGaaa	None at all. Lets say Bob really likes you as a friend..not as an intimate other.. than he would be excited that you like his brother. Lets say a few years pass and you and Bill get married.

Tell him you will not pursue it if it is going to cause problems.|`|yFeOTk3Baa	I don't think it's wrong... "Bob" is your ex, and he left you for another girl. There is nothing he can do if you date his brother.|`|zhWdG63Baa	well he left you for another  girl i think it's fair to date his bro if he doesn't like you why would he have a prob. with it, you should talk to him bout it|`|sZ1vyyiQaa	I dont think he would be mad.

It would be more complicated if Bob wasn't already dating someone else and if you two weren't already both totally okay with the ending of your relationship.  There should be absolutely nothing stopping you and Bill from moving forward.|`|KM50wTbHaa	I don't think its wrong since he was the one that met the other girl so theoretically, you dating his brother should be no problem at all.

The only time it would cause a fight is if bob isn't over you but as he's got another girlfriend, it should be ok.|`|2f7MEQMiaa	Bob shouldn't care at all. I mean he liked another girl and went out with her. He got what he wanted. Shouldn't you get what you want to? Bob shouldn't care because he's "happy" with this other girl.

Before you get into any of these please confirm from Bill whether he is really interested in you as you should be in the situation where you end up nowhere. If you believe Bob is mature enough then he will understand your feelings and will let you do what you want. <br>  <br>  As far as the rift between two brothers is concerned, if completely depends on the individual and you need to take a judgement by understanding Bill and Bob and potential reactions to the situation.<br>  <br>  I hope you will get what you want. <br>  <br>  Take Care and Have Fun.|`|XLjSYo67aa	OMG i have the same problem!! ok so i live in a small town and everybody has practically dated everyones brothers! so im the only one that hasnt and i became really good friends with my ex's brother and now i think i like him and dont kno what to do! but for you i would have to say its ok! cuz your friends with your ex and i think he would understand, plus your ex likes someone else so he shouldnt get mad bout it! i would confront your ex if you plan on dating his bro tho cuz he was honest with you so you should be honest! :) sorry it was long but hope i helped lol|`|iDTrTvg4aa	that's the critical question u asked  !!!  first  ask bob   that  "if u like to have any other boyfriend what u do " ? then slowly let him know that u like bill  by sending ur some other friends  c what is the reaction is  then proceed|`|xWl8IJIhaa	When "bob" can have a choice why not you???
0HYG8PlNaa	Because women look sexy in them!
ZSznCJhSaa	I would think that that means he still has feelings for you. Playing with your hands is very intimate and a sign of affection.    But be careful, don't play with this guys feelings. If you mean to go after him and tell him you like him back, really commit to it!

I know it's not right, but the women's rights movement has a lot more money to oppose legislation of this nature.  In the two states, it was only achieved by appealing the cases all the way to the State Supreme Court, but could still be overturned on appeal to the federal or U.S. Supreme Court.<br>  <br>  I will give you advice on visitation below, but a little history on the DNA/Child support problem.<br>  <br>  If he's not the father, your best bet to get out of paying the child support is to challenge for custody.  Except in Pennsylvania, though the father cannot enter DNA evidence to stop child support, the mother can enter it as evidence that he's not the father and thus cannot have custody of the child.  But, in doing so, she forfeits her claim on all future child support.  Sorry, you can't get back what has already been paid, but she can file retroactive child support against the bio-dad.  <br>  <br>  In Pennsylvania, non-biological fathers can get custody regardless of DNA evidence.  There's a father there that learned he was not the father of his three children during the divorce.  He not only got custody, he gets child support from the mother AND the bio-dad, whom she married after the divorce.<br>  <br>  In Michigan, the father of a 15-year-old lost his custody challenge, during the divorce, when the mother provided evidence that he was not the father.  She than file retroactive child support against the bio-dad, whom she had sex with when he was 11-years-old.  At age 27, he was ordered to pay over $80,000 in retroactive child support.<br>  <br>  Since he's not likely to stop the child support, he can go for his access rights and prepare for a custody challenge.  The prep work for the custody challenge should take two years, during which his contact with the child will help.  If she refuses to obey the visitation court orders, the challenge can be done sooner.<br>  <br>  I’ve been a Father’s Rights Advocate for 20 years.   <br>  <br>  Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.  Also, learn how to make sure the judge is being balance is his decision by using Court Watch.<br>  <br>  Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.  <br>  <br>  Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  You’re that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  Take the time to learn what you can and should do.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/DadsHouse/">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...</a><br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.parentalalienation.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentalalienation.org/</a>|`|gSBco9oaaa	Four years ago, when the child was born, was the time to challenge paternity. If he was married at the time, the presumption, legally, is that he is the father. If he wasn't married, then he agreed to be named the father. So, from then until now, legally, he is the father and responsible for child support.<br>  <br>  Be very certain before you challenge paternity. If she has a lawyer with any sense, the cost of the paternity testing, as well as the legal fees she incurred for the challenge, will be his responsibility as well.<br>  <br>  Get a bilingual lawyer, if you must, but be aware, those legal fees will be his responsibility as well. Since he is not working, the chances of him getting and being able to pay for a lawyer are slim. If someone 'gives' him the money for an attorney, the opposing attorney can and will argue that he can come up for the money for this, but not for his responsibilities. <br>  <br>  He may be best off simply paying the support he owes. THEN, if he is sure he is not the father, go for the paternity. IF he can then prove she knew all along he was not the father, he may be able to get the money back. But this is a very expensive action to undertake. Figure out the dollar value. Will it cost more to go thru all this and lose than it would cost to just pay?<br>  <br>  As far as visitation is concerned, that is a seperate legal issue. Visitation and support cannot be linked. In other words, just because he didn't exercise his legal rights as father doesn't absolve him of the responsibility of support. On the other hand, he also needs to file for joint custody and a visitation schedule. Again, that will cost money, but, often, mommies decide it is not worth the hassle of dealing with visitation, and they are then much less likely to pursue support. That would be a big 'tell' to her motives. Is he the father and she just wants the child supported, she is just looking out for the best interests of the child? Or is she using the child as a meal ticket? Again, the answers to all of these questions would weigh heavily in a judge's eyes, particularly if he goes thru paternity and proves the child is not his and she KNEW it.<br>  <br>  Let me repeat this part...there is nothing worse than a man who fathers a child, then, when forced to support the child suddenly says 'It's not mine'. Nothing worse in the courts' eyes, or in society's. If this is the case, he is in for a world of hurt, and rightly so. If she needs help raising this child, and he doesn't pony up, she will or already has ended up on WIC and other public aid programs. That means the rest of us, thru our tax dollars are paying for his refusal to man-up.|`|0LHRBaRSaa	You should get a lawyer. The courts are trying to screw your brother over by making him pay money for a child that may not be his.

If someone does not listen to a soft or normal tone, they will sometimes pay closer attention to a loud voice or a shout. This is obedience by intimidation. However, it does not work with most people. In fact, it only makes things worse. Because no one likes to be yelled at, and no one likes to be humiliated in front of others. Some people just get into the habit of talking louder to prove a point or yelling to assert authority.

It's simple really.<br>  <br>  My husband has had a vasectomy (12 years ago) and it was a scalpel and it was not too bad. The key is to do NOTHING afterward for days while you heal.

But if a woman wants kids, obviously she would rather date men who are willing and able to do so at some point in the future.  I don't feel negatively towards a man who has a vasectomy, but when I was looking for a man to marry and have children with, I looked for men who were open to having children some day.  That is only common sense.  You admit that you have negative feelings towards women who want children.  Why?  If you are not married to/dating a woman, what difference does it make to you if she wants to have children.|`|1PXkhhzQaa	You sound paranoid and you have "negative" thoughts towards women who want children (the vast majority of women want children, although remaining child-free is fine too). What is that about? Did someone try to sue you for paternity?<br>  <br>  Vasectomy is permanent. Around 10% of men later regret having had one due to a change in life circumstances or relationship status (like after a divorce). In addition vasectomy can cause chronic testicular pain (around 10 to 15%) or pain during sex (around 4 to 5%). If a man knows this risk and wishes to have the procedure, then so be it.<br>  <br>  The problem is that these issues are not featured on the vasectomy consent as they should be.

I run a support group for these men, so I've heard it all. No man is going to tell you that his testes hurt after sex or that he has painful orgasms. They suffer in silence and 500,000 more vasectomies are performed each year, creating another 50,000 victims, many of whom are not warned of these risks.|`|LYeMqJIRaa	I think a man can tell a woman he does not want kids and if she does she can always hope he changes his mind or there is an "accident" where she can get pregnant.  Once he has the vasectomy she knows her chances are almost zero.<br>  <br>  I had the no scalpel done in June and am currently sitting on an ice pack as I had more surgery last week in attempt to stop the chronic pain I had been suffering these past few months.  To add insult to injury I have lost a lot of sensation too.  If you go through with it research your doctor carefully and still be aware of the potential downsides (they are often downplayed).

He will also explain to her in the letter that this behavior is against the law and she can be given jail time if she insists on ignoring your requests to leave her alone. <br>  By doing this you show your bf you have given her more than ample opportunity to leave you alone.  <br>  Good luck.

If you're paying for it yourselves but still wish to include your parents' names on it as a gesture of honor, that's fine, but you don't have to.  It is perfectly acceptable to say,  "Together with their families, _______ and _________ cordially invite you to attend their wedding..."

And it doesn't matter who is paying, we did it and we were paying for the wedding.    My father had died two years before we got married, so we dealt with this as well.  We used 'the late...'  The only thing I would change for your situation is since it's your mom and his dad who have passed away, just change around the order of the genders for each, like -    Lisa Marie,   daughter of Henry and the late Mary Smith  and  Mark Frank,  son of Helen and the late William Green,  request the honour of your presence....    There is an alternative which can be used, it may be dependent upon your religion if it's appropriate. It's putting in a (+) to denote a cross for the deceased person.    Example -  Lisa Marie,  daughter of Henry and +Mary Smith,  and  Mark Frank,  son of +William and Helen Green,  request......  ----  *Note - it's not the parents who are doing the inviting, if you read the wording. Having the parents' names included simply states who you are the son and daughter of....|`|AA11312653	You are 100% percent correct in thinking that who pays for what is a private matter and your invitations shouldn't even hint at such a private thing. I think the best format in most situation is     The honor of the presence of   [write in up to two names]  is requested at the marriage of  Bonnie Bridely, daughter of  Elizabeth Bridely Newman and  Brian Bridely, to  Gregory Groomston, son of  Gordon and Gretchen Groomston,  on Saturday etc etc etc    That Gordon Groomston died 2 years ago is not relevant. Gregory is still the son of Gordon. It is not only a matter of respect for the families but to help people know who you are. For instance and elderly aunt like myself might be thinking "I don't know any Bonnie or Greg. But wait, I know Liz. That's right, she was married before and has a grown daughter."    If the invitations are only going to small group of people and your certain everyone will know who is who, then you could get away with omitting the parents' names.

You'll be ok to put just your names, especially since you're paying for it yourselves (like another answerer said, yes it does matter.

If you want to include your parents on the invitation even though they aren't paying for anything, you can say together with their parents,_____________   and ________________ request the honor of your prescence.... and how ever else you want to word it.
d36f7c4fb8b8952c08aa3139dc2554b9aa	Well, I am assuming you have recently been married within the last few years or so.  I went through the very same thing you did with my wife.  I did not do as many surprises as I used to.  I began to get concerned because I noticed a lot of things begun to change in the marriage, we both were acting differently.  I felt like a certain part of the love was missing and she was not being as affectionate.  I talked to my dad about this and told him everything.  He has been happily married for 30 years so I thought what better advise.  So, he told me that once you get married, you now enter a new part of your relationship together and the "bells and whistles" feeling will eventually disappear.  It disappears because you are now getting more comfortable with each other.  That feeling you both had while dating is now gone.  Yes, you both still love each other very much, but that feeling you had while dating is gone.  Try new things together.  The dancing classes together is a good idea.  Hint at him that you would like a nice back rub.  If he does not get the hint, really lay it on him by getting into some nice looking underwear and hold a bottle of massage oil up to him and tell him you want a back rub and that you will also give him one.  This could allow for a new thing to happen, it will certainly keep it in his mind about this and may want it again if he really likes it.  Just an idea.  Go for some walks together, bike together, go to the movies together, etc.  Also, just sitting and talking about it may also really help as well.  Be open. with him, communication is key to any relationship.  Hope this helps.      The Pauper.|`|GSKMX47Haa	LOL, LOL, LOL, at Mona, very funny|`|jSMiLEDJaa	Most likely those were things that he didn't REALLY like to do in the first place. He may have done them because he felt like they were things he had to do in order to get you. Now he's "got" you and may no longer feel like he has to try. You might want to make sure that you haven't slacked off in any ways too. Be honest and talk to him about things you would like. Make sure you're nonconfrontational. (Don't say you don't do XXX anymore--- Say something like I really love when we.... ) Maybe you can even set up a "date" for the 2 of you. YOU get the concert tickets dinner reservations etc. There's nothing wrong with a woman taking the lead sometimes too!|`|Eu7IZlF7aa	You sound like you're asking too much. But have you ever even thought how much you have given? It's a give and take process honey. You're lucky enough he's still showing LOTS of affection and love. Count your blessings.|`|QS1cQEdaaa	Have you ever asked him?  The thing is We tend to forget the little things too when we get married, like the kisses on our foreheads or the smile they have on their faces when we get home, which to our partner's, means so much more than going out and sending flowers.   If you want a back massage or to go see a performance ask him..."Don't you want to surprise me and take me dancing sometime?"|`|vFCX50DZaa	You can also get things going again for him by surprising him and waiting for him in a sexy outfit once in a while.  Get him back into that stage in life by leading the way.  I also get complacent with my wife, but its not entirely my fault.  If she would do what I said above then that might get me back into doing those things again.|`|fbc51fefdf8f90a690cd87fb91f16194aa	He's probably complacent because you've been together for a while and he doesn't need to impress you or win you over.     If he won't take you dancing or out to places, you organise the outing and take him with you. Arrange surprises for him. Perhaps he'll remember then how nice that sort of thing is and be more willing to reciprocate.|`|d6zcA1NYaa	Unfortunately men start to fade when it comes to the romantic stuff. But the problem is partially on our part as women. We expect them to act and think like we do. I know I get excited about valentine's day weeks ahead thinking about what to get my guy and I'm sure he grabs something last minute. Men just don't have that intuition on what to do when. So when you're back hurts he says " I'm sorry honey", right? His brain just doesn't connect your statement with something you want him to do. I would suggest the less subtle approach. The next time you want a massage just tell him "you know what sounds really good? A massage. I always feel a lot better after you work out the kinks". See if massaging his ego a bit will help. If all else fails sit him down and talk to him. you are married and if he's amazing enough to deserve you for the rest of his life he'll be willing to sit down and listen to how you feel and how he can help. If you think he won't be down for that you can always ask him some things about you that he would like to change. It'll make him feel less attacked and more included.    I hope that helps|`|7a29609061cc85b8213f55d1598f7a9aaa	You make him sound like a really crappy husband.  Why has he stopped noticing you?  When you really love someone, you don't just stop bothering with them.|`|zAoKd2DBaa	he's doing what all men do, taking you for granted - without meaning to!    he needs a gentle kick up the *** !|`|mN9AUoDjaa	Maybe its time to make him sit up and notice you!  All women need attention.  So, do your make up, dress up and go out with your friends once a week.  That will soon make him pay attention to you.  Sounds like he's got a bit complacent.  Or maybe overworked, tired, etc... put the 'flirtiness' back into your marriage - men like chasing!  Good luck.|`|79wOWoM0aa	For the same reason that most wives stop giving BJs... because they often stop doing the things that landed the spouse in the first place because they don't feel it's necessary to keep making the efforts.    Tell him in plain English the kind of attention you want from him and that it's upsetting that you don't get it.  In the meantime, do not stop giving him attention.  Retaliation won't fix anything.|`|Sxlcyua5aa	Men are hunters by nature.   When they are dating, they are trying to find that special someone to spend the rest of their lives with.   When they found that special someone and marry them, then the hunt is over.   He's on to other things.   That is why you see many people gain weight after they get married, because they got what they wanted and they don't have to look their best anymore.   You have to find other ways to rekindle the marriage.   One good way is to go away with your husband for a weekend, or for an over night stay at a nice place.   Get alone together so that the only focus he has is you.   If you do this every so often then you will be his focus.   Just keep in mind that you also need to do things for him that please him.   So come up with something new that will excite him.   It is a never ending process in a marriage to keep that spark going.    Good luck.

uPL3e3tyaa	I really like you too...I just don't understand why if we like each other and both enjoy the time we spend laughing and holding hands, you need a certain name to place on the relationship!? Is that what makes it real for you?? Why can't we just be together and see where it goes from there???|`|SJX3jMh9aa	Cause he don't feel the same about you?  I had plenty of girls give me that one, so i am sure it can go the other way too.|`|2AAhiwgnaa	cos he has issues with commitment, or he just wants sex from you?|`|sEwoF3ocaa	because he doesnt feel the same about you
AA11515948	Haha, everyone gets addicted to Facebook, that's why it's so popular!  And seeing what your crush gets up to must be about the most common activity!    If you want to stop, suggest finding something else to do when you're bored, like read a book, play a video game or find another site (freerice.com or Miniclip or something)  Also limit your Facebook usage to once a day, for five minutes - time yourself!  You can do this gradually if it's easier|`|K2dxDdyqaa	Yes, are you stalking him?|`|MkRRQ0T3aa	No your not a freak, alot of people like to check out their crushes facebooks, bebos or whatever.  Read a book, like a really good book that you can get into.  I did that, and it stopped me going on my laptop as much  x

IQ50BJ0Waa	Ask the bride if the dress can be made for the flower girl. If there is only one flower girl, it won't have to exactly match anything. I had a friend make my flower girl dresses and they looked the same as the ones at David's Bridal. <br>  <br>  Wedding shop dress: $112<br>  Home made: $12 worth of fabric (and that was for two dresses!)|`|l43NSgHyaa	I would speak with the bride and let her know that financially, you're having some difficult  I think most people will understand, given the current state of the economy.   I would, however, let your daughter be the flower girl.  What a great memory for her!  <br>  <br>  I would simply tell the bride that you can only afford to pay for your daughter's dress and you still want her to be in the wedding.   But, that you can't afford to buy two dresses, at this point in time.<br>  <br>  I think just being honest is graceful enough.  Plus, letting your daughter remain flower girl, shows you aren't doing this to be mean or spiteful.|`|g0BI8bJzaa	I don't have an answer as I just asked a similar question...just wanted to say that I really feel your pain.  I wish people who plan these elaborate weddings would realize that there is no universal loan source for friends and family to cover their expenses out of obligation. ..sigh.|`|AA11380378	Please tell the bride as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Tell her that due to unexpented and critical changes in your finances, you will no longer be able to purchase two dresses on that budget. Tell her that you would like to decline the honor of being in the wedding party and that you wanted to give her ample notice so she can replace you and your daughter. Tell her that it's nothing personal and that you still would like to participate and support her as a guest.<br>  <br>  Do no stall on this. You have to tell her as soon as possible<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|emKXU1QFaa	Just talk to the bride and let her know things have changed for you financially but you still want to participate.  Tell her your suggestions and ask her if she has any others.  She may know another girl who could be a flower girl, she may help pay for part of the dress as her gift for being in the wedding party, who knows.  Make sure you do it sooner than later because you don't want her rushing around trying to find someone else and getting stressed out!
OqjNyUgDaa	Well depends on your age, some of these wont be applicable.  - Going out for a night on the town with your girlfriends.  - Hire a hummer/limo/party bus, i did this on my 15th birthday it was amazing, a mini party on wheels. You can just get driven round the city for a hour or so.  - Ice Skating / Rollerblading  - Bowling  - Cinema  - Go out for a meal. You can have such a great time|`|sEwoF3ocaa	eat cake|`|seB7nC9Waa	It depends upon ur age|`|Xc5gLdx2aa	If you want just a nice quiet party then just invite your girlfriends round and watch a movie and a have a pampering night in.    But if you want something a little bit more exciting then maybe go out for a night on the town with Your friends.|`|4hjs31HJaa	depends on ur age.....|`|1OxiOk2taa	It really depends on your age:  How about ice skating or roller blading  or  you can have a party at a restaurant  or  how about a swimming party  these are all good for most ages... if I knew your age I could find more|`|MkRRQ0T3aa	Cinema and then like a resturant or pizza hut or something.  Invite like a few friends round, watch movies, pig out, play games.  How old are you? If your old enough get some booze!x
uBssj3Znaa	if they are truely your friends they will put behind the differences and help you enjoy your birthday.|`|AA10277384	It might be.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, friends of friends might try and get along for the sake of their friend. Sometimes they become friends, sometimes they don't. <br>  <br>  You can't force them to hang out and have dinner together if they wouldn't normally hang out together.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest asking them separately to see what they'd say. Ask them to tell you what they'd honestly say to coming to a party with _____ there, and see their reaction. Then you'll know whether to invite them all to the same party or not.|`|Ev07jBmYaa	well girly, even i have some of frenz like that. but u dont worry. ur party will be a hit, unless the host makes it so. just believe on ur other 3 frenz and the 4th one will automatically have to indulge him into the party. but do not be surprised if he doesnt njoys too much. just let him be within him. thats what they like....|`|3rkpcXodaa	have two different parties if their your true frinds theyll get along just for you :)|`|Cadyoy2Vaa	i have a friend like that. she does like the other cause he called her a slut or something
FdRGuMKraa	Well, don't jump to conclusions so fast. Perhaps you are wearing some glasses that give you the perception that grass is yellow and the sky is purple. I know you are joking but actually it's not that random. Purple is a shade of blue and yellow is very similar to green. Just something to think about. I'm your friend by the way.|`|SQj8bZ38aa	Hi Butterfly,  Can we be friends, that's a big question. The sky does have a purple tint at sunset sometimes and the grass can be yellow if it's dying.  As for the friend part, my heart can be broken and my soul I give away through what I write, which is in poetic form and inspirational and motivational. I myself would , as we all would, and that's to have a best friend we can trust, share our feelings with, and maybe help one another accomplish our dreams.  Are you that friend ? I am a man who's 46 and still going strong, to help do my part to do some good in the world. Do you believe in God, I hope so, because without my faith in Him, like He has in me , I would never reach my goals.  You are my friend if you meet the above. Have a great day Butterfly and may you keep your wings beautiful and free.

8746b03b21f468d92426aa69e46cee78aa	Lexapro is an SSRI, or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, meaning it works by ensuring that serotonin in the brain remains available to it rather than being re-absorbed by receptors, thus improving mood and reducing anxiety.  (Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, meaning it is a chemical in the brain used by neurons to communicate with one another; it has been implicated in mood, especially depression and anxiety.)  The full effect does take several weeks to occur, but it is also not uncommon that people experience an initial burst of energy (and thus mood) as a side effect of the drug - the same reason people sometimes have insomnia as they adjust to the drug in the first couple weeks of treatment.  It sounds like she has learned to use that effect to her advantage, but the medication won't work properly unless she takes it consistently.  Also, once a person takes it consistently it is not good to stop it suddenly.  The drop in serotonin can trigger depression, unless one tapers off it gradually.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	You don't need to skip a day when on anti-depressant pills and she need to take it like the doctor prescribed!|`|prqrQcd1aa	I too have taken lexapro. I did work right away for me, like within the first couple of days, my depression is not strictly chemical though, it's situational. So yes it did give me more energy as i wasn't depressed and laying in bed all day not wanting to do anything... but... You shouldn't take more than you are prescribed, i took mine every other day as well, but not for the same reason, i took mine every other day because when i'd take it every day i'd get shaky. The doctor told me it was ok to take it every other day.

ikXRqWxUaa	credit scores/reports do not combine when you get married.  the only thing that is on your credit reports are accounts that you are listed as borrower or co-borrower on.  that being the case, if you keep completely separate accounts, theoretically speaking his bad credit won't affect you.<br>  <br>  the reality is that a spouse with bad credit does affect you in some ways.  can you qualify for the home loan based on your own income?  if you cannot, than his debt just effected you, as you might have to get a much much cheaper home.  his debt and bad credit means more money spent by him in interest.  this means he has less to put into things that you might want to have.  if he continues to wreck his credit, than this will be a sword of damocles that will hang over him, and by proxy, you.<br>  <br>  you are wise to be worried about this before you get married.  too many people don't.  it's a good sign that he's working on his problem.  show encouragement and help him achieve that goal.  the good thing is that the negs will be off his reports in 7.5 years from first delinquency.  keep your eyes open though.  if he doesn't show improvement, consider this a huge red flag and you might want to reconsider marriage to this man.|`|Yleae8hiaa	Yes it will effect you. My ex had bad credit and I'm still paying for it. Been divorce over 10 years. And believe it or not, in January a bill of his found me!. I'm paying for it. Can't find him. I tried to fight it and lost. But look into. Get a good look at his credit and get some credit counseling on how you two can fix it. It might not be as bad as you think.|`|AA10097443	Keep your finances separate..wait until he re-builds hes and even then wait ten more years.. with this economy..it will be twenty years before we get out of this one..maybe more..if your young 20's..plenty of time to work out his credit problems..by the time your in your 40's.. you can then decide if you want to combine finances.|`|93ix6nyvaa	I would presume it doesn't affect you, unless you guys have joint names together, say for a car or an account. It would be very unfair for you if you guys have a "combined" score just because you're married.|`|fE1GFxbRaa	If your credit score is all that matters you should marry a financial consultan! What ever happend to marry a motha****** with a bus pass?|`|qpS8Kbzxaa	people that don't manage there credit usually don't manage there lives well either.i would look else where.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	Honestly it doesn't take that long. My credit score was 500 due to ignorance and just not paying bills in my early 20's. After just a year of paying my bills on time, I bought both a brand new $25,000 car and a $200,000 home (with a traditional loan, not an ARM) on my own, no cosigner or anything, with my credit score. So it's not as bad as you think. <br>  <br>  HIs credit score will affect yours. If he's that awful with money and if you think he will continue to damage your credit, don't marry him. Money matters are the number 1 cause of divorce, and if that's your biggest concern now, it's not going to go away.|`|P1KbWHImaa	only if you apply for things together. same situation w/ me and ex. i had the credit, he didnt. it didnt stop me whatsoever..|`|J74Y5LKxaa	UN-FIGGIN-BELIEVABLE.  To actually think that there used to be a day in age when it was the MAN'S responsibility to work and take care of his wife.  Sad state of affairs these days when a man's reputation, his credit, and his ability to provide for a wife means absolutely nothing anymore.  He must be really really cute and amazing in bed to make you overlook his ability to take care of business.  (and people wonder why the divorce rate is so high)|`|5r2Csdzwaa	Unless you want to see the repo man allot, leave a bad credit having DOLT alone.

XBTzRVuBaa	Good fathers are not only in fairytales. I have a wonderful father who I was always close to growing up.     I am still close with my father and I am 22 and out of the house.     He has always been wonderful to me, and is now wonderful to my daughter.     I'm not sure what you want to know, or if you just want to know if they exist. They do. And its nice to have someone. I am blessed to have two wonderful parents who help when I need it. My father is always willing to help, and always thinking of us.     I hope there were other figures in your life that were loving to you as a child as everyone should experience that.|`|oKExTm8paa	I don't know what it is like. Many fathers do not know how to be a good father. I did have an example of a neighbor when I was a child. He was a good family man and great with his wife and kids. That is the only wonderful father I've ever seen.    I have read books where the father is an inspiration and good and kind.  These good fathers might only be in fiction, though.    Don't let this get you down or it could ruin your whole life.|`|EeYpsEipaa	I don't know either - my dad does nothing for our family...|`|YWKHleqraa	Thats quite a difficult question. There is no perfect dad out there, but there are lots of different ones.   Even if you say your dad is hateful, maybe he still loves you, but he is just going through a rough time at work and is bringing it out on you? or he wants to discipline you?  MY dad is really strict, but he also has his good side and can be quite funny. But when I was younger he was scary, because he told me off alot and shouts soo loud, so at that time I really hated him. As I get older he is not like that with me anymore and is proud of my achievements as my mum tells me.   I really love my dad, but I dont think dad's show it as much to their kids for some reason, they are too manly maybe.lol.     However if you're dad treats you like this regularly I think you should ask him nicely to have a word with him, and just explain to him how much its affecting you and that you want him to treat you better. Ask him how he is, like for e.g 'HOw was work dad? did they give you a hard time? Do you want me to make you a cup of tea?.  If you are like this with him and show your concerns towards your dad, he might catch on and start being nicer.  If not well I dont know what his problem is then.     oh but wait oops, sorry but you don't have a dad anymore? or he left the family? If this is the case Im very sorry for this. Look life is never perfect and the same with poeple, but there are some nice dads out there, who show kindness and love towards their kids,go to watch their game at school etc. They are somewhere out there. hope that helps.|`|qqnMvAs8aa	don't be afraid....    Maybe you just like me.  you only have 2 option :    1st. be patient. becouse if we hate him back. just remember if he died we canot do anything for him except blaim your self. and remember every thing you weared, you eat, your collage its from him.. and you became a real woman because his money.. i know we as kid need more than just money. (my mother's said)    2nd. be patient. when you have a change to get out from the neighbor, i mean you can feed your self. just get out from there,fastly. fight back and dont ever to meet him again.    that's all ist about your self. what you must choose.  and always keep tell this to your mom, or your sister or brother, not your boyfriend becouse he not a your intern.    don't keep it alone. or somtimes you crying to your mom.|`|YqNSqUPvaa	Well honestly....

FgxQVeitaa	sux for you, u shud stop begging her and show her that she misses you, and shaving and stuf is a good idea cuz then u show her that u like her and are trying, in a not pushy kinda way|`|sCCjAKllaa	That sucks. I think you should respect her wishes for now, and just give her some time to think on it by herself. If you constantly try to get her back, it might have a reverse effect, and push her away more then it does bring her back. You don't want that to happen, so just give her a break.|`|pMmOXlZ6aa	you definatly cant act like it didn't happen. Then shell think your a duche. Just dont try to bring back memories, and make her laugh alot!|`|BDjBVdtRaa	oh yes. do everything that you did while dating like hanging out all the time talking on the phone. everthing then she will want to get back together or she alresy does? but dont give up. but also try  not to argue with her.|`|tfh2qF6jaa	I am going through almost the exact same thing right now but flipped around.  You deffintly will have a better chance and I can tell that you really do love her.  But are you doing all these things JUST to get her back, or to start at a new begginging and start doing all these things for her no matter what.  And if she doesn't want to get back together, then thats her, and I know that it willl be hard.  But just wait, I gurantee if you back off (which is really hard to do) and stop treating her like shes still your girlfriend, I know for a  fact she will misss youu and she will realize  that she really wants to be with you and she loves you incredibly.  Good luck and I hope you have fun =]<br>  <br>  p.s- Im hanging out with my ex today too=]

It's a turn off for me since I have a cousin who used to sniff his finger after scratching his butt. :D|`|p7Z5H8ftaa	im really sorry but yeah thats a huge turn off. and im sorry I just laughed. really. idk what to do to help cuz i know how hard it is to stop something when you have a condition. try putting this really yummy smelling stuff on your hands and at the begginig of the date and having her smell it then if she notices just be like "i just cant get enough of this scent" then when she gets to know you explain the problem|`|lSag21xbaa	well, for a typical guy yah it would be way wierd. but you have ocd( witch isnt a problem : ] ) so its not a turn off at all...explain to your dates before you go on them so they understand your problem :) it'll be ok and work out : ) be honest and striaght forward from the begining and your dates will be better.........|`|sr0vZPQqaa	If i knew it was because you had ocd then i'd be ok with it.|`|aaoWVDxMaa	It can be a turn off. But maybe you should get some help from the doctors etc. Good luck|`|2f7MEQMiaa	Those girls are rude. If they know you have ocd, they should accept it. Ignore when people laugh and ignore what they say. A good girl wouldn't care and would try to help you get through your ocd.|`|McJ18CN0aa	Honestly...yeah. That looks kind of disgusting. I wouldn't even touch you unless you explained the situation.|`|sZ1vyyiQaa	To be honest it would be something a girl has to get use to but, if she cares then she would except u sniffing ur fingers|`|mTl9l3aMaa	Hey, I sometimes sniff too|`|vlOtkGu3aa	every 2 minutes?  that doesn't sound like ocd.|`|20039aba7a36cb3e425af1248cd6ad5daa	if i knew it was because of ocd then no cause you cant help that|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Could become a turn off to me...but its not as bad as other ocd habits I know some people have.
YJVmL9Ubaa	It can cause you to have health problems,stomach problems and the gut is connected with the brain,mentally you could have panic attacks,or not be able to quit thinking about things,it affects your nervous system and causes you to shake,the brain,stomach,nervous system are all entertwined.|`|6Bh32zqFaa	stress is the number one cause of death. it can really bring a toll into ur life. you will have no appetite you loose sleep, catch headaches, you start to feel different in life. the best medicine is to not let stress take over ur life take over the stress....|`|fqboOITjaa	Well from personal experience when I'm stressed I can't sleep properly and have absolutely no appetite! <br>  <br>  It depends on what I'm stressed over, if I'm stressed over work then I usually can't sleep but if it's over my love life or something then I'm off my food!|`|SszvBQUvaa	It can make your face look much less attractive. And you will be tired all the time.|`|49aOELCWaa	when im stressed i act a little weird but most of the time i can hide it which i guess isnt good <br>  its normal to get stressed sometimes just find a healthy way to deal with it like exercise|`|eoQoCcz5aa	Myself when one is stressed  it always messes up my concentration it is horrible that is how it affects me . What I do to get rid of it is play my guitar or I listen to a certain song , this song is called " River Man " by Nick Drake . After hearing that song my worries seem to fly away . Check him out sometime on Youtube ........RIP to him aswell , kindest regards , cheerio .|`|ff545BLyaa	Well in the Army and let me tell you stress can make the difference between living and dying.  But t can also have very bad influences on life as well.  Stressed people make more hurried bad decisions.  One who is stressed does not think clearly.  It can also lead to paranoia and other mental issues.  In the army we were put through terrible stress training mentally and physically so that we would not be affected so bad by it.
d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	Having a BF/GF usually implies that you are taken or your partner is taken as per social rules.<br>  <br>  Having a lover usually implies that both people are free to do as they please with other people if they want.<br>  <br>  You could be lovers and be faithful to each other but have no real commitment beyond the notion that you share something such as the feelings and/or intimacy.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	most likely your ages.  there's a point that you eventually reach where it just sounds stupid or juvenile to introduce someone you are having a physical relationship with as your BF or GF.|`|b9ff940610f4c3ac65317b30bae44184aa	Commitment. Emotional involvement. A future.<br>  <br>  "Lover" is a poor term for it since love is not involved.|`|CQsD09D6aa	A lover is someone you are definitely having sex with. A boyfriend/girlfriend may be either but it connotes an emotional involvement as well. People sometimes use 'lover' to mean someone you are having an affair with while married to someone else.
ek6FQFiZaa	TALK TO YOUR MOM, not your dad on the issue of your mom's affair.  Since you are Christian, remember "judge not lest ye be judged" and the Commandment to honor your father and mother.  Your mom's affair is unfortunate, but that's not your business, that's between your mom and your dad (and ultimately God).  You can still let her know your personal pain and hurt from it, without meddling in their marriage.<br>  <br>  TALK TO YOUR DAD,  for how his support has been for you as his child?  As an example, if you feel he hasn't been there for you personally, let him know.  As another example, if your dad is saying mean remarks to your mom in your presence, you can let him know how his lack of support is a buzzkill to the entire family, without meddling in the details of their marriage.<br>  <br>  TALK TOGETHER AS A FAMILY to let both of them know that you want them to be happy with each other. You might want to do this when the 3 of you are all together, maybe over dinner at a restaurant.  But realize that they may ultimately decide to divorce, etc.  Just provide your support to them.|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	Do not tell your dad.  you need to talk to your mom about it. tell her that you know and tell her that she has to tell your dad. simple as that.  they are the ones who's marriage is in trouble.  all you can do for them is pray.  and try not to follow in their footsteps.    the only biblically approved reason for divorce is adultry.  so if your mom has cheated and they choose to divorce that will be their desicion.|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	Yes tell your DAD but first try talking to her|`|eXTMwatMaa	I think your mom should seperate from your dad because the marriage isnt going to work out if she isnt supportive.<br>  <br>  your mom should talk to your dad and tell her what she wants.<br>  <br>  <br>  let your mom know it is wrong and she needs to end her relationship with your dad<br>  <br>  im sure you love both of your parents and dont wanna see none of them hurt but this cannot continue.<br>  <br>  you other siblings most understand that your parents arent right together anymore..|`|WY7HJDpgaa	overlook.<br>  <br>  it is her problem, her religion and her call.<br>  <br>  she is your mother and you have no moral rights over her. u dont own her.|`|189233d5651c6d19d5903bb45454ecd9aa	Talk to your mother, NOT your dad.  Tell her exactly what you just said in your question.  If she realizes that you know, it may be the "kick" she needs to do something about what's happening.  She certainly should not be committing adultery, but on the other hand, you may not be aware of everything that's going on in their marriage.<br>  <br>  Be prepared that this may mean a difficult time for your parents.  They may have a trial separation, and possibly even divorce.  If that happens, try not to let your religious beliefs intrude on your parents' need to figure their own lives out.  These things take time, and ultimately, your mother and father have to do what makes them HEALTHY.  Sometimes that means going against what others believe.<br>  <br>  And by the way, "staying together for the kids" never works.  Your parents need to figure out another reason to stay together... otherwise they're making their children's lives miserable, which is an even bigger sin!
4POGapREaa	The only thing I'm thinking about is the cost of a professional film crew for that many days.  VERY expensive.  But, you didn't mention finances, so if you've got it that good, go for it.  Sounds like a great way to capture the experience.  My husband & I pretty much did what you're thinking of.  We planned the big wedding but we were just so over it after a while that we flew to Hawaii instead & got married on the beach by ourselves.  We did have a photographer & a friend that shot the video so when we got back we played that for everyone.  I wasn't getting a lot of input from anyone either during the planning, and I just felt like it was all on me & too much stress.<br>  <br>  Arranging it shouldn't be difficult.  I booked everything online & our hotel had wedding packages so they set up the whole thing for us with the officiant, photographer, etc.<br>  <br>  You can plan the party when you get back.  Nothing says you have to do it immediately upon your return.  You can do it a month later if you want.|`|Xp2De933aa	hmm sounds original. if you don't want to have a ceremony, then id say its a great idea. personally i could'nt imagine getting married without a ceremony. but that's me. and my hubby wont help me plan either =( he just says" its all up to you" "its your wedding" and " if you like it then i like it" i wish he would be as excited as me. but like your hubby, he just wants to be married to me, he could do without the ceremony.<br>  good luck and congrats!|`|2x41IPGcaa	ok. i will be your bridesmaid. so lets make it a big do. how about a hen week in benidorm?|`|h3NJO9dWaa	That's a good idea, I like it. You can also have it broadcast over skype so that friends and family back home can see. It may feel awkward having to make a movie out of the honeymoon that you know people will want to watch.<br>  <br>  You could always just get married out of town, have the honey moon, then come back for a reception and don't worry about filming it. That sounds stressful and who would want to watch a movie for that long anyway? Maybe just take lots of pics and do a slideshow. That way everyone at home can see what a good time you had without being bored.

Hang with your other friends    Suck it up princess !|`|8e373a7bc6b3c784f2bae9cc02a6cf20aa	Well, you don't say how they are annoying you -- but I would say -- ignore them.  Or if it's something that really is bothering you, and they are truly your friends, you should be able to tell them without ruining your friendship.  Just be diplomatic when you do it!|`|0Nfr3leOaa	tell them to shut up there annoying  lol always works for me|`|FORX7yfQaa	Say you are annoying.|`|Lq7xvTqVaa	It mostly depends on your age and gender, I believe. If you are no longer teenagers you just have to make them understand that you still like them but they are way all over you and that makes you uncomfortable. The thing is you did not put details that would help one to understand the situation you are in and therefore give you a more appropriate suggestion. Good luck.

Qbhuj5a3aa	1. People who have to copy everything you do e.g., have the same clothes, hair style, furniture, etc., the list is endless.  I  have two girl friends who are both very well off (money wise) who cannot help themselves in always copying whatever I do in my life and my environment. Yet I am not well off, nor do I own my own home (I rent) I am usually very frugal (but no mean) as I have been a single mum to my son since he was nearly 10 years old; to me I am very practical.  2. My son (who is getting married in Oct'09. That I have great skills musically. That I like to make people laugh and have Cheeky Sense of Humour plus I always try to see the bright side of problems that arise and realise these happen for a reason.  3.

2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	It depends- if you've got a friend or relative who is a talented seamstress, then she could probably make you a beautiful dress for a lot cheaper than you'd pay for a store-bought one.  But if you have to hire a seamstress, it will cost a lot for all the labor and material, and it might be more cost-effective in that case to buy one at the store.  Also, you have to take into consideration the amount of detail and embellishment you want on your dress.  If you have very simple tastes and just want a nice, off-white silk sheath dress with no bows or ruffles on it, a seamstress probably wouldn't charge so much to make it.  But if you want all kinds of intricate beadwork and lace and a long train and all that, be prepared to pay a seamstress top dollar for all that work.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	It depends on what you want. If you want a gown that would normally cost $1500 +, it may be cheaper to get someone to make a knockoff. If not, there are beautiful gowns you can get off the rack for a reasonable price|`|NyRBCufpaa	It really depends, you should call a few places and ask them what the ball park would be to get your dress made. Some wedding dresses you can buy for cheap but some are expensive. I'm thinking about getting a dress made as well, I have looked at at least 500 wedding dress pictures online and can't find anything that I like. Good luck and Congrats!|`|sGP6s7uraa	Buying is cheaper.  Couture gowns are way more expensive unless granny can make it for you :)|`|4fdeb5e83b0e4e59d0ce45d49190dc78aa	It depends on if you know a person who will make it for you.  Obviously the material will be cheaper to buy and make.  If you don't know someone to make it for you or live in a big city then it will probably be cheaper to buy one.  A bespoke designer dress designed exclusively for you could cost as much as 4,000 depending on who is designing it for you.    You should also be able to allow around 4-6 months for it to be made.    Here is a website for a bespoke dress designer to give you an idea:    http://www.melaniepotro.com/yourdress.ht...|`|RmIeoU7raa	I think if you have one made it's cheaper but it all depends on who you have make it.|`|4WOCDS9taa	getting one made but i no that cybergown.com has alot of reasonable prices, gorgeous dresses.|`|C0yagFFoaa	buying one is cheapest, sometimes when you go to the shop they have ones that someone had mdae but never paid for , and they are cheap, but also may look real nice.|`|crKCWOxXaa	I bought my dress and only paid $400 for it on sale at David's Bridal otherwise it was $600 I looked into a friend of mine making one for me because it would be mine and something that's not out there on the market she priced all the material and everything it was going to be more than a dress at Davids Bridal so I would say just buy it even though your only going to wear the thing once.|`|ge3meKYEaa	Things that are mass produced in overseas are always cheaper then having someone hand make one thing.  Unless you find someone cheap and you do something soo simple with no beading- that would be the only way it would be cheaper.|`|ZadDprTxaa	Buying is usually cheaper (unless you personally know the person who will be making your dress).  When you are buying a dress, you are normally buying from mass production and that drives the price down quite a bit.  When you have one specially made you are looking at a custom job and that can get pretty expensive.|`|JZabWXGpaa	It depends on what you want.  If you want something that is totally unique, then perhaps you should condsider having one made just for you.  Here is an online wedding dress shop that makes custom made wedding gowns.    All of their dresses are under $500 and shipping is included  http://www.mybigfatbeautifulwedding.com/...    Hope this helps

AA10729675	Whatever you decide to do like confronting them (which I think is useless), do not mingle with this crowd again.  Make new friends.  Being with thieves makes you a thief, even if they steal from you.  It is like you are helping them commit those thefts.  And it is like you are condoning what they do, and you have for 1.5 years!  Just break away from them: there are other people.  Even if you have to be alone for a while, it is worth it!  Do not mix with them.

Intellectual growth will facilitate successful school and work ethics.  Mutually supportive friendship is a lifelong benefit.    Developing into adulthood prepares for the responsibilities sex.  There are many pre requisites that do not require intimacy.  The beauty of all that you do on the road to maturity will facilitate appreciation for the journey and the wisdom acquired along the way.    Have this conversation with parents and teachers.  It will demonstrate your readiness to embrace the knowledge of the future.  Your interests will define potential responsibility that prepares you and boyfriend for greater expectations.

Life is a thing that you experience in your youth.  Sex is something that you do to enjoy each others company when you mature, and to procreate.  If you want to have babies, (and what normal person that doesn't have a job and concept of responsibility yet hasn't experienced life yet) then go for it.  Personally I think there is so much more to life then what you are worried about will happen next.  If the guy you are with is pushing you to have sex then you need to re-evaluate your relationship.  15 year olds should be worried more about school then sex.|`|o1cfYWKiaa	there are plenty of things you can do together!!!! for example why cant you just enjoy each others company? perhaps a stroll on the beach or a walk in the park...if you feel you cannot wait until you are married theres nothing wrong with a bit of kissing and cuddling!!AS LONG AS YOU BOTH FEEL COMFORTABLE.. listen to some music or go to a gig..... watch some movies or go cinema.... if you feel there is nothing you can do together except for sex or that he is pressurising you then he probably is not the guy for you.. or if you really like him just compromise... im sure he will understand completly if he is half decent... good luck hunny!!! p.s a bit of home baking never goes amis...

YSzNTo4Haa	i understand i started when i was eight. im now soon to be 17 what slowed me down is having sex.even tho i did'nt really enjoy it but it helps get the edge off.also sometime when i masturbat i feeel sick to idk why but i uess it normal..|`|ZSznCJhSaa	You can not get bacteria in your stomach from masturbating. I don't know if you are aware of this, but, your vagina isn't connected to your stomach.... there is the uterius in the way. I suppose its possible to create problems and infection of the cervix, but you would have to be doing some crazy stuff to make that happen.    You are right, you can get UTIs from masterbating... but only if you aren't careful. I used to get UTIs a lot (not just from masterbating) and I thought something was seriously wrong with me. But really, you just have to be cleanly.    First of all, wash your hands or whatever toy your using. Second of all... uhm.. if you do anything with your back door make sure whatever touched that goes NO WHERE NEAR your other area. Third of all, try to take a quick rinse off after you masterbate or get some baby wipes and wipe down there if you dont have any time.     As far as not masterbating as much... I don't think you need to stop completely. Just find something else to take your mind off it. Exercise is usually the best idea because it is physical and releases endorphines similar to the good feelings of an orgasm.     But yah. I don't see how masterbation is making you SICK, you might want to go to a doctor and make sure there isn't anything else wrong.|`|rsIyLZHKaa	get a man .that would help|`|izbAdDUraa	how does it make you sick? masturbation doesn't cause illness.|`|6mBrJ2EGaa	yes it can make you sick...you need to just think about the consequences instead of how it would feel at the time...|`|6lGpDk93aa	yea i dont understand how it makes u sick unless u dont wash ur hands/whatever u masterbate with.... i think u should find something else to do that u enjoy.... try staying around people and it will take your mind of of doing that... also it depends what age you are.... ifs not good if u are 13 and doing this but if ur older there is a difference|`|911c5486ad6f6c3cef4af6c4ca5e728eaa	it wont make you sick, unless you are using dirty toys or not wahsing your hands.   it is natural to masturbate.
5ad48390d67eef1bf45ef9d3d3c02fe2aa	I've always thought the "rules" were stupid. Be true. Be yourself. Go with your gut. If you feel good with someone, go for it. If you don't, let them go. Stay strong, stay true. The chase can be fun. Don't play with someones emotions though.|`|nZ49ukJvaa	well im outgoing, and girls i like are outgoing. I love a girl who plays hard to get, but they have to flirt here and there while doing it. They cant ignore u completely, they have to expect you to flirt, and theyll flirt back, and it goes from there, but always have a smile on ur face, positve hard to get, not negative hard to get.  Adn yes, the chase is awesome, its boring if a girl just hands herself to you, cause its not as rewarding, but sometimes its awesome to have a girl whos really into you like that.. shes gotta have attitude to pull that off though|`|tIez5HWBaa	no, playing hard to get makes me question the motives and honesty of the girl. if i have expressed my feelings and she shares them then that should be it, those who play hard to get are manipulative and that is not a good way to start a relationship.<br>  <br>  texting should only be used when at work or in class, in all other cases a phone call should be made. at the begining of a relationship i think the guy should make contact first, but after you are comfortable togather it shouldnt matter anymore|`|BkA6xGXzaa	you have to play cool ... <br>  there is no standard in girls ..<br>  first type ..<br>  <br>  not so hard to get and suddenly ignore you .. ignore her .. she will come crawling<br>  hard to get from the beginning .. show her that u care .. o great respond or change .. ignore her she will come crawling ...<br>  Playing really hard to get ... ignore !!<br>  <br>  so basically .. ignore :p ... <br>  but not soo much to the point that she leaves ya :p !!<br>  <br>  start the first text !! and always end it !!!|`|ekrTfdFlaa	sometimes. depends how long it drags on.<br>  <br>  both people should text whenever.<br>  <br>  basically if it's too easy they don't feel like they accomplished anything, so when you do it makes them feel a little more "victorious" and they will probably brag about it to their friends...|`|2aE0BxfFaa	No. Thats only in movies. Some guys aren't outgoing as others and more sensative than others. If a girl were playing hard to get to me, I would think she didn't like me and move on.|`|GFiKQIGpaa	the chase is a b**** for dudes it sucks like hell and it doesnt matter who txts first|`|HOVvKqxsaa	not really|`|763ce153f7628cfd4764c25b6a7ce844aa	Personally  I don't care for the chase, I prefer when women come after me. I feel that if a woman comes after me than I'll be the #1 man in their life.It makes me feel wanted. All this crap about the man having to ask the woman first is old fashion.|`|d8uJaLXYaa	I know I'm not a guy - sorry - but I just have to say... hard to get's just another way of phrasing 'awkward'.|`|G0mtkuDvaa	sometimes but if you keep doing it when you know that hes going to give up in a month then no we don't|`|O97IVzIhaa	We enjoy it to a certain extent.  Don't take it literally though.  If a girl is to hard to get guys will just not bother with you.  You have to actually show some signs that he is getting somewhere.  As for girls ignoring me i can't stand it.  If a girls a little unavailable then that is a different thing.  If he asks for your number then you probably should wait for it and if you do text him keep it brief.|`|yBnmqLZ7aa	Well, don't like melt in his arms with everything he says, but to be completely honest, guys hate it when girls play games with them. I had a girl who was playing hard to get from me, but she was doing it so good that I thought she wasn't interested. So I moved on to my current gf. She came to me crying when she found out I had a gf saying "I really liked you I thought you liked me" and stuff. Don't play hard to get, just get into a relationship already. That doesn't mean be easy though, there's a delicate balance....Alright, if you want to play games though, this is something that you could do. Text the guy first, this shows you're interested right? But make sure that you're never the last one to end the conversation. That doesn't mean blow off his question or anything, but if you're kind of flirting via texts, just don't continue the conversation. This shows that you're interested, but also that you're a challenge....I guess what I'm trying to say overall is, if you don't show a guy something, he'll won't pursue you. So its fine to play hard to get, but that doesn't mean ignoring him and stuff. Make it a challenge but reward him along the way with your kindness and stuff.|`|30BcAMXYaa	Let me answer lol.<br>  we play hard to get becuz we don't want to play easy to get becuz if we're easy yall think yall can get yalls way.<br>  and sometime playing hard is to much there is playing hard and playing hard in a stupid way..<br>  playing hard=him asking to date her and her saying haha nope.<br>  playing hard in a stupid way= him asking to date her and her saying LoL in your sweetest dreams followed by an insult.<br>  what i mean is playing hard with insults and being rude is just girls trying to show off belive me i know lol.<br>  and playing hared by being ok and normal is a '' shes gonna be yours but not that esay''<br>  some of us women don't like to give our selfs up that esay.<br>  hope i helped yall LoL.|`|ifC1aFHxaa	Personally, I hated these sorts of games and appreciated very much when a girl / woman let me know she was interested.<br>  I think the best method for girls is to BE hard to get until the guy she likes approaches her.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	I love the chase. It's much more titillating in my sexual conquest once I bed her.|`|33e18371c231caed609d57632064134caa	i freakin hate the chase.
JYgJD0Rwaa	This used to be very uncommon, however with the current economy more and more divorced or "separated planning divorce" couples are living together because they cannot make it on their own financially.<br>  There are non stop stories and articles about this very topic, nearly everyday on the news/internet.<br>  I don't imagine it to be a problem as long as "rules" are set as far as their relationship, and they understands that each may date or have friends over...|`|RPVl5jvIaa	I know a girl whose parents are divorced, but live in a 3 room house.

21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	If anything is expected of you, the bride or groom should be telling you.  There is no standard function for you to have.  There is also no specific supplies you need, unless they request something of you.  If you're concerned about not having enough information, you should be asking the bride or groom about their specific ceremony.|`|VpCtXEMGaa	You will need several things for the hand fasting.   1: Cord-it's a very thin rope. You will need about 2-3 yards  2: Candles: Red, Green, Yellow, Blue to put into the four corners when calling the old ones. And a gold and white candles to call the Lord and Lady.   3: Something red: This signifies the binding of blood and magic. My old HP used a lovely circle of rose petals.   4: An object to exchange if rings are not being used    Are you performing the hand fasting?     Here is a hand fasting ceremony: http://www.handfastings.org/ceremonysugg...    good luck. :)|`|c425bd77add075a97bdceeb9591a73bbaa	We had a handfasting.  We did not use candles, we used earth, air, fire and water to mark the circle.    We also did not use capes, that must be something specific to your friend's wishes.  Ours was nude.      After the handfasting, we had a loving cup ceremony, which was wonderful.    The officiant will likely direct everyone in what they're supposed to do, so don't worry too much about messing up.|`|g6Vci5SUaa	I attended a hand-fasting about two years ago.  It was a beautiful ceremony taking place in a woodland and I loved it.  The participants called the quarters, basically, and had a few lines to say.  For a cape, look up new age shops in your area, you might find some there.
6k8GJBRPaa	Yes, I guess so, but maybe he's affraid that you will reject him. Nobody likes that, but maybe you can give some subtile hints.|`|SBjV8GlFaa	Yes, he likes you. Make you feel better now? Just play it cool.

We are on a league, but yet we still rent shoes every week.  I think he wanted some for Christmas, because the week after when we were at the bowling alley I heard him and his friend talking about their shoes, and he said "yeah, I thought I was getting some for Christmas, but I didn't"....so yeah, I'm thinking he wants them.  Plus, it will save us money in the long run, and it's something I know he will use.  I cannot stand to by a gift for someone that they never use.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	We are taking each other to the NY Aquarium, then driving into Manhattan to eat at Peanut Butter and Company, and walk around for a little while, maybe even hit the Central Park Zoo.

Your husband that is.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	so every dollar he spends from here on, that is not your ring, is gonna put you in sour and foul mood?<br>  <br>  i'd say your marriage is to a great start. <br>  lol.|`|qpS8Kbzxaa	only thing that doesn't make sense is why did you marry such a loser.get out now for you waste to much time on this loser|`|H3WHxCgaaa	If you aren't going to wear it - don't bother buying it.  You can always get one later down the road...If you weren't up front about wanting a ring to begin with you have nobody to blame but yourself right now.  <br>  <br>  We married at 21/25 respectively and had nothing ourselves.  My husband did know that it was important to me to have a small ring - and that's what I got.  On our 10th anniversary we upgraded it!  By that time in our lives we could afford it.<br>  <br>  Consider holding off until you are both more financially secure and then finish what you started.|`|ze7xiJwTaa	I'm not a big jewelry person either. And I don't believe in spending a lot of money on things like that, especially if things are tight (as they sound like they might be for you). But he said he would buy them right? And then he bought video games? That would bother me. <br>  My ex-husband and I had a quick engagement and wedding too. But I went out and bought him a ring and surprised him with it at the wedding. I would have been thrilled if he bought me a $20 silver band at a street stand. But he didn't and I was also disappointed. It's really the thought that is important and it made me sad that there was no effort on his part. <br>  Funny thing, after a week he didn't like the ring so we took it back (it cost $1500) to pick out a different one. He ended up trading it up...for a Rolex. Yep, he used the money towards a Rolex for himself and paid the difference. That should have been my first clue...<br>  <br>  Talk to him about it and tell him it's important to you. Go pick out cheap bands together.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	I don't think it's selfish. The ring is a symbol of a commitment to the other person. I would think he would want you to have that.<br>  Maybe he doesn't know how you feel. Sit down and tell him that you feel sad that he didn't even offer to buy a ring, tell him it means a lot to you, and see how he reacts.|`|qczTENowaa	Well, it sounds like you didn't marry for money, that's for sure.  <br>  <br>  I guess when you marry someone who can't even bother to make a decent living and provide for his family, then you really can't be too disappointed when they don't.<br>  <br>  But heck, at least he's good at video games!<br>  <br>  If you wanted a MAN you should have married one.|`|CURyGQZ8aa	I can understand how you feel. you should let him know that it is something important to you.  Sorry I believe it should have been top on his list.<br>  <br>  I heard a song the other day something about if you don't want to put a ring on it you don't want it.  I'm going through something kinda the same|`|xQnkYyocaa	It's a status thing to want a ring. Without it we feel that noone knows we are married without a ring on the finger to show so. Start saving a little every week and buy your own. Show him how much it really means to you. If you wait, you could be waiting for ever.|`|Sy7CxAyiaa	i don't think you are being selfish, you are just asking for a token of his love, he should be putting you before those other things, was he like this before you married? this is not how you want your marriage to start off, doesnt sound good|`|TZpFcx47aa	No its not selfish at all. It sounds like he is still spending money like he is a single guy. If that was "his" income tax refund ( and i think there is no "his" and "hers" in a marriage) but if he thought of it as "his", he prolly wanted to buy toys with it. Maybe his one last splurge or something. Most guys, it never occurs to them to buy their woman some jewelry, even the important kind. You arent being selfish, he is being a little clueless.
bID1Pd7Gaa	Do to the fact your statement confused me you should just move on. Don't run with her, run away from her.|`|q2AsDnjpaa	All you can do is be honest about your feelings. There is no magical way to win her back.     I think you have to remember why you broke up in the first place.

r1D9P4Vyaa	From a Guys view, I think your gut felling is right on this one. Love is something that will build over time. Say about 2-3 months over time, if Just you and Just him dated for that long, maybe he does then. If not, He is just saying what You want to hear. He is basically just playing you. It sounds to me he already knows what girls want to hear. So he plays with there minds so he can  get what He wants. I`m not saying to break up or go out with him, that is Your chose. Oh and to date behind your parents back, yes, do it, you are only young once in life. Just be safe, yet sneaky about it. All this from a guy on the outside looking in. I hope this will help you some, Good Luck Girl! :)|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	Why are you not in school?|`|gLXzVbm8aa	men always know the right things to say to get girls in bed|`|YRsCMVvnaa	It seems like this guy will say anything to get what he wants.

You will never know if you don't try. And even you he breaks your heart you can never know what true love is until you've had your heart broken.|`|qfv4VAc9aa	Ask yourself this, Do you care about him enough to trust him? A big part of relationships is trust, and if you don't trust him do you truthfully think it will workout? Love is a strong word, and if you know his past, how many girls has he told he's loved? You may have a reason to not trust him, but if you guys are going to be in a relationship you will have to trust him.|`|c64339464988241688f21fe6fe705dcbaa	honey u should think about all the thing he has told u in ur friend ship has he ever lied major to u before if so he is lying if not hun your best guy friend has liked u fo a wile but hasn't told so he did ruin ur friendship|`|Wn3EJ03baa	He's  a player    leave  him   alone|`|8KxurcApaa	He sounds like a Casanova (good for him :D) and as such he is probably charming you & two others as well.  That said, he could be telling the truth but more than likely (presuming he's in high school) he doesn't know what he wants.     If you insist that he is utterly & completely in love with you (which I wonder if either of you can say that about each other) before you DATE him then I would recommend against it.  But the whole DATEing phase is to get to know you.  If you DATE him he could learn that he does like you more than the others & then he will push them away.|`|oPEzV2EGaa	theres two ways to go with this one. ive dated behind my parents back and it lasted for almost a year. its not to hard if you know how to work it. but in the end when he broke with me and i thought about it wasn't worth it. i risked my parents trust for a dumb boy that in the end wasn't worth my time and it hurt when we split but life goes on things happen for a reason. or you can trust your gut and not believe him when he says i love you. guys usually say things just to get in your pants. i learned it the hard way but im still innocent. just don't give up your innocence if you haven't already because you don't wanna have any regrets with the you supposedly love|`|KBU2X921aa	I would recommend not believing him. You think he has a thing for two other girls already and how could he possibly love you if you two aren't even dating. Saying "love" isn't just something you should throw around. I would understand if he said it in a friend way but as you explain the situation i think he means it more. I feel that this guy is trying to have his cake and eat it too. Meaning, he wants to have something with you (thinking your naive enough to believe his "i love yous") and have something with his ex. Don't get yourself caught up in a situation that could really hurt yourself and your friendship with him. I can guarantee that there are many guys out there that are more committed to a serious relationship with only you in mind than him. You explaining the situation already seems like he is a jerk and is trying to use you.     I hoped this helped.
7SzADsVSaa	It could be a number of things, I would say if you KNEW about the 'other women' that it's a  subconcious choice. That possibly you are choosing the men who are already involved as a sort of self-sabotage tactic, so that you can only get so close to them, already knowing that there will  be rejection, so you can always blame it on that they were taken in your mind.<br>  <br>   But.. if you don't know about the girlfriends/wives etc, that's a different story! It could be the energy you give off, possibly a care-free, or unattached vibe, maybe they think you are not on a quest for a long-term, maybe they see you as someone who just wants to have no pressure fun.  <br>    I think the only way to really fix this, is for you to reevaluate yourself.  Do some soul searching. Are you coming off as care-free? Are you doing this to self-sabotage? Try to figure yourself out, take notice of the little things you do, the gestures, the way you come off to people. I think it might help.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	When I was single I had the same problem.  It was creepy.  I don't know what it was and, frankly, at this point I don't care.

Some woman subconsciously want what they know they can't have.  I suggest you break this cycle ASAP by asking up front, any guy whom you are interested in or is interested in you "are you in a relationship of any kind with anyone??"  and get a straight answer out of him!  If he's involved, move on.  Why don't you try doing the "picking" instead of waiting for some guy to pursue you?  Then you'll be in control of the type of person you get involved with.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	You must be good for them to want to risk what they already have.|`|0AShsMsoaa	buy a book called ' the rules'.  and another called 'he's just not that into you'.  and, 'why men love b#tches'.  these are real books.  <br>  <br>  perhaps it is insight that you need so that you dont do this over and over.  becoming more aware of the rules of the game will help you avoid being made a fool of over and over.  <br>  <br>  there is also a site called 'askmen.com' that has a section called 'dating and love' it is for guys, but, oh, what you could learn from reading it.|`|4wHjtkJXaa	maybe its your personality. maybe your morally filled self makes for a great person to talk to?|`|sVdQSMvJaa	That's a very good question have you ever asked one of your married pursuers this question?|`|29hcn9JRaa	You didn't mention your age? however I am going to assume that you are a grown adult woman, but fairly young? Not to sound shallow but in my lifetime I have dated many men, married twice and basically have been their done it. At any-rate some women, myself included, don't like a guy who is easy, you know the type, the guy who is following you around like a lost puppy? the guy who calls you 24-7, these guys are so boring, and this is when the married guy, or the guy who is in a relationship becomes quite attractive, as he is a challenge. I as a child was the little girl who if her parents told her not to do something, I would rebel and do it, as it was a challenge to me, so my advise is to take your great quality's with a grain of salt, as your quality's while they are admirable, are meaningless when it comes to finding the right guy, the right guy is going to come your way when you least expect him to, so stop looking and start keeping it simple, simplicity is the key to Mr, Right coming into your life when you least expect him to.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	I have been single for a while and I experience the same. Statistics says that about 35% of men posing as singles are in fact married or in a relationship. Most of the time those men are very forward, they are assertive, confident and they find a lot of satisfaction in hunting for women. I am sure all of these men approached you...and not the other way around. The only thing we can do is being careful. I usually smell something fishy by the 3rd date. This is when I ask question if I have not got the home number and only a cell number....4 months you were a bit naive but take this as life experience and start being more suspicious.
gKuHTs1Caa	although friends say they understand your situation,they really don't...<br>  it's "their day" so try to keep it as close to that. <br>  here's an idea on pleasing both of your situations:<br>  -making a gift basket to send to them b4 the wedding:<br>  put their favorite candy or lotion, etc..., some old pics of you together.<br>  get creative...<br>  include a card (with tons of mushy stuff in it about how much they mean 2 u & enclose money for them to use however they need)<br>  also, enclose a gift cert. of get her nails done at whatever shop is near them. (the card should be opened when her nails are drying, so you will 2 cards). make it personal,thats what i like to do.|`|a4bd96dcb7b6c4b2e1b26176b088b451aa	I think you should send her an extra big wedding gift to show her your appreciation. :)  It should be something that she will always have and remember you by.  People always appreciate stuff that are sentimental rather than monetary gifts ;) Congrats on your baby and I hope you think of something great to send.  Blessings on your marriage  and new baby as well.|`|7XG5fd5Xaa	Something a friend of mine did was have ppl put money down at a travel agency for their honeymoon, instead of gifts or a money tree, if they were doing something like that, then you could contribute more to that.|`|wWzK6eJaaa	I would say send your friend a bigger wedding gift because her sister may not spend the $$ on the party, u can never be too careful.|`|bKK2fPiVaa	Send her a super wedding gift.  And buy your little one a cute "tux" or dress and take a picture.  Title it "wish we were there too!"|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	you're only required to pitch in for the bachelorette if you're attending.  if you're not taking up space in the limo, why pay for it?  you need to keep your $$$ for your baby duh.  if you haven't rsvp'd for the wedding yet then just rsvp no, you can't go.  it's good you know in advance so you're not shafting her after telling her yes or something.  then send her a wedding gift, $50-100, nothing crazy.|`|76nTvO4iaa	You're not obligated to "pay her back" because she gave you a bachelorette party 5 years ago.  <br>  <br>  Cut out the middle man and send her a generous wedding gift.|`|l43NSgHyaa	Well, I would speak with her sister.   If you're pregnant, then they might not be expecting you to be too involved.  You're obviously preoccupied with your baby and pregnancy.   So, they might have all the plans for the bachelorette paid for and covered.   Her sister might not even expect your offer to pay.     So, call her first and offer to help.   I wouldnt' give her cash though.  I would offer to go out to the store and actually buy something or make something for the party.   Like someone said above, you don't want her taking your money and running. <br>  <br>  If she says everything is taken care of, get an extra big gift and send a really personalized card.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	Send her an extra special gift, along with a DVD of you and your new little one wishing her the best, or arrange it so that someone can bring a laptop with wireless internet card so you can get on the web cam and talk to her directly at the reception.<br>  <br>  Thumbs down? I wonder why... I thought it was great since she can't be there to congratulate her friend directly.|`|q8eue7CRaa	I think the more generous gift is the better route to go - they can buy something they really need for their new life together. Get them something big off of their registry or an extra generous gift, like you said. That will mean more in the long run than extra tequila shots at the bachelorette party!|`|AA11380378	SEND HER AN EXTRA BIG WEDDING GIFT!!!!!<br>  <br>  I'm sure that she will apreciate your thoughfulness. <br>  <br>  Good luck
6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	I totally understand.  You're shallow so marry for money. It's got a 50/50 chance of ending in divorce anyway, so you might as well get rich.  I'm not being a smart ___, just being practical.|`|tcvQwTa5aa	Of course everyone would prefer a comfortable life over an uncomfortable one but love is blind dear.You could fall head over heels for someone with not so much money then what?Your heart wouldn't let you dump him because your ego wants bookoos of money.Money and things are fun,yes,but their just distractions.You need more and more of them to stay satisfied.Like the kid who gets sick of his expensive video game rather quickly and just HAS TO have another one real quick to be happy.(got kids,been there,done that)If you had to pick between having the best guy in the world with no money and one who's a total *** who's rich,who would you pick?That's a bit of an extreme example but you know what I mean.Love is the greatest gift of all and no amount of money can buy it for you,not true love anyway.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Yes I do. You need to become independent and not use another man for his money. Most of the gold diggers I know get dumped. I am well off when it comes to money. I'm in that top 2%. I can spot a gold digger a mile away. I used them then dumped them.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	You don't want people to think of you as shallow, you don't want to be shallow, but you don't want to change how you are?<br>  There is no dilemma, you already have your mind made up.|`|B7kPUmUWaa	Yes. Go for a comfortable life, and end up being completely miserable! Because when he divorces you because you are shallow, at least you will have the money to wipe your tears! And I am being a smart___!!|`|dD5uhH8naa	there is no dilemna just be who you are and tell everyone else forget about it|`|POHWTDPRaa	So if people said you were stupid you would believe that too? You are what you know you are, not what other people think. Honestly, it sounds like you also believe you are shallow so I have to give you points for owning up to it. But if you don't think you are why would you act it?|`|m81dfyOYaa	That's assuming you can find someone with money who is willing to give a shallow wife a comfortable life. Younger guys who work hard to make money usually are smart enough to weed out the duds. Try for an older guy who would be grateful to have a trophy wife.|`|uec7RIhbaa	why do you need to get married?!  if you don't love someone enough to be considering it then why are you feeling pressure to do it at all?!  just sit back, enjoy men (and their money if thats what turns you on) but don't MARRY someone just for their money!|`|SovaFpN8aa	If you marry only for money, sooner or later you will become unhappy because you will feel unfulfilled. Money can't buy you happiness.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	hey, if you're gonna fall in love with someone, might as well be someone rich.  i have no issues with that.<br>  i fell in love with someone hot.  it's all good.|`|f21c4568248ded0eeab01a76d3a81476aa	No problem as long as the dude you marry knows you're just a gold digger.
CmHLKKODaa	Oh Yeah !<br>  <br>  =) !!!!|`|6Q4xh4F1aa	I absolutely am proud of my yougest son.  The other two kids are another story.  He is smart, asks questions, demands proof, rejects the watchtower faith, and plays a mean guitar!|`|JdmwlvSRaa	idk cause i ain't a parent but r u sure he just wants to show up in front of u.<br>  The person who is in top of me is he gay or somethin he looks like a boy on the pic lol|`|3FmO9ACaaa	yes i am no matter what they do i will always be their for them.i will stand my them through thick and thin they are my world.
0c0ywvuRaa	it just depends. sum girls look good without it naturally and some dont. but if its just you and your bf hanging out alone i wud say its ok not to cuz like you said he knows wat you look like it without, he prolly wouldnt care. but if your going out you should look good.|`|196b73911133c4d75053bfa6ae887857aa	Personally I don't care if chicks wear make up or not. It is nice to see a chick put some make up every now and then but it isn't a big deal to me. My girlfriend doesn't wear make up all the time and I'm perfectly fine with that.|`|dH8LGrDkaa	umm it depend on girls's feature .... some girls can look good without makeup ... <br>  <br>  But good makeup and clothes definately make girls better ...<br>  <br>  If I had a choice I would want the girl to have nice makeup and nice clothes|`|qKpgMkjSaa	My soon to be fiance' hardly wears make up, I think she looks sexy and beautiful no matter what. But when she does it is a nice change cuase ti really brings out her gorgeous blue eyes hehe|`|JCdBSULraa	I don't like it when girls where makeup at all.|`|ubsCaEQHaa	I guess for me, it would be up to her|`|S4VVE0onaa	i don't think they do mind|`|5aXKo6uCaa	its how they feel|`|uTNKfpV6aa	Guys really don't care. Most guys prefer a chick who wears little or no make-up for three reasons. One, they know what the chick looks like, and aren't going to wake up one morning, being like WTF. Two, they don't have to wait FOREVER for her to get ready when going out. And three, they don't have to worry about smudging your make up, touch ups, or transfers onto their shirt, or jacket.<br>  <br>  If you still want to wear make up, I say cut it down to mascara, eyeliner and a nice gloss. Either MAC, or if you'd rather just wear lip balm, got for Blistex. It's easy, simple, doesn't smudge or transfer very often, and FAST!|`|OBPL49vWaa	I lovee lovee loveee make-up i own way more than i should, but i do not and have never worn make-up every day.  Make up just enhances features it doesnt make you who your are. Im sure he likes you for you and not what you look like, my boyfriend says he likes me better without it, that he loves seeing the real me =) if you choose not to wear make up dont seem unconfident, be happy in your natural beauty|`|tY1gSfN4aa	no we don't care...or at least we shouldn't if we love you. don't completely stop wearing it tho. its okay not to wear it everyday, but sometimes its nice to see that you take the extra time to look special for us; it shows you still care n stuff.|`|jvWGnq6Laa	well me personally am not a big fan of makeup to begin with, so i would appreciate it if u didn't have to wear it everyday for your bday, it should give him a connection to you, like he gets used to your natural beauty|`|v96pYAg1aa	U dont need make-up to look beautiful Ive always fely natural beauty was better putting make up may make u look better but ur true face is what really matters so no I dont care if woman wear make up if anything I want them to stop hiding behind it!!|`|UHIscXDUaa	usually, i dont like gals wit loads of makeups....maybe every guy has the same feeling...if u r thinking tat u makeup every day in order to make him feel gud bout ya,den u better ditch off the idea....if he complains bout tat then start wit ur work again.....|`|YFXusnT1aa	If it doesn't bother him don't worry, some girls don't need it. To be honest most times we don't notice.|`|sLWC6vEmaa	I dont personally care... the girl i like wears little to no make up and im cool with it.. but again all guys are different|`|Q49EEdzbaa	some people need makeup me personally it gets on my clothes and inside my eyes and i hate that but for men they dont care some men still just care about the heart makeup is an option|`|zhWdG63Baa	you know there's guys who love when the girl doesnt' wear make-up you should ask him|`|utGddhnVaa	yeah..unless where going out somewhere you don't need to|`|O97IVzIhaa	We don't care.  If hes seen you without make up and hasn't left you already chances are your beautiful to him no matter what.  Make up is one of the few things us men don't really care about.|`|AMTYPir7aa	most guys do not care for make up. at least that is what they tell me. i hardly ever wear it and when i do its very little no blush no foundation/liquid just a little to accent the eyes and perhaps cover a blemish. <br>  <br>  if you meet someone and you wear that stuff everyday then i suppose you are expected to wear it just as much.|`|96zZlJVYaa	not really, if she feel like putting it on its ok with me (but not too much) and if she don't feel like wearing make up that is fine with me too. like you said, I already know what she look like and I am very satisfied with her. <br>  <br>  if he don't said anything about it when you don't wear any make up. so stop wearing if you don't feel like wearing it.|`|sCBJHVtzaa	I wouldn't go out of the house with a naked face. BLEH. but thats just me, if you have natural beauty then good for you. lol,but make up is kinda essential, and i dont care what a guy thinks if its fake, then if someone thinks tht their deff. n ot the right one for me, whatever you like is whatever you should expect from your man. if he wants it any other way then boot him.|`|xWl8IJIhaa	It depends on what they intend seeing!!!

WZe1D2jaaa	It usually means she wants to have sex with you and other people at the same time, while keeping a close relationship with you so she can call on you whenever she's in a pinch. <br>  <br>  Ditch her, she's no good.|`|w6r4U7duaa	What do you want?<br>  Friends with benefits aye?, Usually guys say this lol, But Kenny, you must have given her sum'n good or your real hot, cause that is obviously the one thing she wants to hold onto, however she must either have other guys whom are doing there moves on her, and she wants to try them too, or she already is sleeping with one/them! And whats a bet this óther'guy said the same thing to her!<br>  But lets assume she isn't with another guy.... <br>  <br>  A. Just let it be. And walk away knowing your hot (either in bed or just HOT! And be her toy boy <br>  <br>  OR....<br>  <br>  B. Tell her you want more than just benefits thank you very much, that she is more than just a hot bod to you. tell her "Sweetheart, I want you for more than JUST sex, or its a no go. You mean soooo much more to me than just benefits. You enjoy her company, compliment her personality/smile, she makes you laugh, she is so pretty too etc...<br>  This will get her (touch her") if she is half decent, and the other guys will look like nothing!<br>  She may just say thanks all the same but I cant commit.<br>  Stick to your guns, and value your body. Say well then I am sorry, its not gonna work with you. (your self respect will grow)<br>  <br>  Now B. shows respect. Both for you and her. She may not click striaght away, but TRUST ME, she will she that you were right, and she was being selfish. especially when the other guys will just sleep with her, then most likly leave her! (sleazy!!)|`|FhrCLLzFaa	It means that she wants to be able to kiss and screw whoever she wants and she wouldn't feel right doing that if she were in a relationship.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmQNW662dtTn5SFQ6X.XQZHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220084647AATEYJG">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  answer it up!|`|EVSqPbT5aa	if she wants to be friends with benefits and spend time with you, she's probably afraid of the title and commitment.  if you hook up and she leaves right away, you're a piece of meat.|`|K6Ja5SNbaa	she wants to keep it open and not feel guilty if you find out that she is messing with other guys.  she may only like certain things about you but not enough to want you and only u.|`|EqG8KMQOaa	She's a hoe.

ixvzhoGUaa	Sometimes it just takes time to feel comfortable enough to open up in a relationship. this is why a friendship that turns into a relationship is usually successful ! The more you get to know the person, and the more time you spend together, the closer you will become and the more comfortable the person will be with you. you can't just get into a relationship with someone and expect them to open up right away, especially if you two weren't in a friendship to begin with. you have to take things slow, and get to know them. usually people that are shy when it comes to relationships are scared of what you might think of what they say, do, what their hobbies are, etc. Try telling the person about your hobbies and what you like first. maybe even tell them something about you that you find embarassing ! lol this will most likely make them more comfortable to tell you about themself and talk more =] good luck, i hope i helped !|`|zVjCUUAmaa	What I've noticed about shy people is usually they have the best/ most different personalities. Usually when they open up, it's completely different than how they usually act. I don't really know, but if i had to guess, I'd say it's because they're afraid that once they show their true personality, his/her partner will think less of them.|`|BVyZfC04aa	Because of insecurities. They may fear rejection or embarrassment if they do.|`|e59bc254d8339c1ae45e999a109e63e4aa	becuz its just in their nature to be shy and quiet. they can't help it. its just who they are. i am a very quiet and shy person, and I have never had a relationship yet. i think it has to do with fear or lack of confidence or something. but you have to remember that not all ppl are the same. Not everyone will be bold and outspoken. sometimes ppl will open up if they are shy, but sometimes you just have 2 accept them for who they are!!!

6FdAFgXjaa	ahh that always happens to me, except im a girl so with boys haha<br>  and yeah if you know shes interested in you, its very unlikely she'll turn you down if you ask her out. try and find out if she is still interested in you and if yeah then i reckon you should ask her out!<br>  try asking her to hang out again, everyones busy sometimes- it doesnt mean anything, but this time when you hang out do something she really lovesss and then maybe talk to her about your feelings and stuff.<br>  good luck! :)|`|7TcxJqW4aa	Maybe she's shy. SHe might really like you and she just doesn't know how to approach you. You ask her to hang out and she might say yeah but if she's really shy she will need an extra push from you to hang out together. Don't have her meet you somewhere. How about picking her up from her house? Will her parents get mad? This way you're making more of an effort and she might feel more comfortable to hang out. Also, remember that patience is a virtue. If she's worth the wait, be patient with her. Girls love a guy that knows how to wait... :) Good luck|`|traG5uc5aa	it seems like she doesnt like you like that if she cancels last minute. you might want to ask her who she likes so that you know for sure whether or not she likes you.|`|8MpnQSe0aa	Maybe she cant decide. Imagine if she will gonna hang out to you kid.|`|09uvIdllaa	for gods sake! she iz waitin for u to ask her out! just do it already!! damn u got nothin to lose|`|1Lo34oEDaa	maybe she is nervouse give her a good reason to meet you i mean if you are nice and funny she sould want to meet you|`|sCCjAKllaa	She's obviously shy. Tell her that you miss her, and that you really don't want her to cancel out on your plans to hang out with each other. Be straightforward with her and just let her know.|`|yFeOTk3Baa	Well, being a fellow freshmen girl, she probably got bored. All you are doing is hanging out. Maybe she was hoping you would ask her out, for real, and it never happened. So she gave up hope. <br>  Well, if she is busy, she is busy. Understand that.|`|Q49EEdzbaa	Concentrate on your school work and wait on the college girls at least you know you would have a crush on someone that will have a future and career!    And shouldnt you be in school now.|`|MYhQqeV7aa	She's just not into you, as they say. There are lots of girls waiting for the right guy, but you are only 14, and have tons of time to find the right girl.|`|yte0BzXKaa	Wow i've been doing that to a guy for about 2 weeks now.<br>  Its because i'm nervous about him, i keep getting told rumors he only wants me for sex. He's older than me and i'm really shy around new people. I like him and i feel bad for making excuses but i'm just not ready for him.<br>  <br>  Maybe this is how she feels too?|`|XLjSYo67aa	wait im lost is it a internet girl that you have never hung out with yet or a girl in your school? she might just be busy and couldnt hang out that weekend, somethings happen like that! i have made plans and had them changed cuz me being 15 i have had lots of stuff going on lately!|`|rvCbwX1Paa	It sounds like she likes you but she keeps backing out on getting together. Did you meet online? because if so maybe she's scared that your either an online predator or wont like her physically. so maybe assure her on those two things and suggest a very public meeting place|`|McJ18CN0aa	If she apologized, then it must be a serious reason. Talk to her when you get the chance and reschedule. It isn't that serious at the moment.|`|UHIscXDUaa	dude...try to build up the relation between you two....hv some patience....respect her feelings...it might be co-incidental.....or she wants something more frm ya....take her to some good movie or somewhere like that.....|`|5NgBRLuGaa	Well... Depends, Has she seen you penis? Because she may have gotten turned off.. You know.. Your grade 9 penis's are pretty well.. "immature"..|`|OBPL49vWaa	i dont really know maybe she just nervous, why not try making it a group thing for the first time you hang out.. like get your friends and hers and all go bowling or something. might make a big difference|`|H50lXUwIaa	Sedate her with chloroform and take her with you!|`|Ucd9AI0uaa	defenitly scared to hang out with you
c815f0954f0cc607a22f3e49bfd31b48aa	If you love him, give him time to figure things out. <br>  <br>  There's a big difference between the following statements:<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if I want to get married.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if I want to marry you.<br>  <br>  If he's not sure about you, there's a problem but being afraid of marriage is understandable.|`|vHxauOyeaa	Honestly I'm in a similar position, he just isn't sure that you are the last person he wants to sleep with (Probably) <br>  <br>  Don't take it to heart, I'm just saying, that could be what is going on, it is a scary thought,|`|0F8hauikaa	It doesn't mean he doesn't love you, but he may just be afraid of a legal commitment. If he knows a lot of people that have had failed marriages, that could be why he is reluctant.|`|iyL6dyMyaa	<a href="http://dating.personals.yahoo.com/singles/relationships/24225/dating-101-will-he-ever-marry-you">http://dating.personals.yahoo.com/single...</a>|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Move on.

Not saying that you should except this for the next 10 years, but if you are solid as a couple, marriage really won't change it-its on paper, its a ceremony that only lasts a couple hours and its a tax right off, other than that, it doesn't really change the dynamics of the relationship if he's really the one. And it really shouldn't change the relationship-you should be madly in love and be able to laugh, love and trust him wholly before marriage, not after he proposed.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	Is he unsure if he wants to marry you ever or is it not right now?  Depending on your ages and aspirations in life, it is not unreasonable that he would not want to get married right now.  If you are both students, it is a good idea to wait until you have graduated school and started your careers.  If it is because he is not sure that you are the one, then maybe you should initiate dating other people and still date one another. The information you have provided is not enough for anyone to give you sound advice.|`|BO28Mn8haa	"afraid of losing you" were the same words I heard when my boyfriend decided to leave me. he was trying to figure out what he wanted in life. he kept in contact with me and started trying to get back with me about a month after because he realized it was a mistake. i am with him now and we are pretty much married but honestly i find myself thinking all the time that i dont want to be with him anymore, simply because he went off to look for something else when i was totally sure. i guess now the tables are turned. if he leaves you to try to "figure out what he wants", i suggest you move on. also, if you are at a point in your life where you feel you are ready for marriage and he still chooses not to, its best you leave him and find someone who is at your stage of life.|`|ifC1aFHxaa	I'd at least go through the motions of moving on. Tell him you are looking for a commitment and it doesn't look like he is able to give it, so you are moving on.<br>  BTW - if you are actually living together at this point I would strongly encourage you to move out.<br>  Be honest. If you think you can make a lifetime commitment to this guy Then tell him that's where you are. <br>  He's right to be cautious about whom he commits to for the rest of his life, but after three years he ought to know one way or the other.<br>  Good luck, friend!|`|7eaf5c689c77b9c042b4be96ab16b8abaa	All your answers are in the movie "He's just not that into you".  That is one of the story lines (Jennifer Aniston & Ben Affleck).  <br>  If you haven't seen it, take him with you.  Then you guys can really talk about it after.|`|qeVqBMVraa	dont force him into marriage..<br>  make sure u both are ready|`|5hlJwDBoaa	marriage is scary wait a little longer enjoy your relationship|`|bZGv0dvnaa	he's cheating on u....|`|ERUxUjB6aa	your boyfriend is on a state whereby he is afraid to loose you because he has not yet finished using you.you will soon find out that as time goes on he will be taking steps away from you,that is why he can not promise to mary you.Better move on with ur life girl,but i would advise you refresh a while before having your next relationship or else you will jump into a worse one|`|wWzK6eJaaa	Men never know what they want honestly, its the womans job all the time to plan and make things happen. You tell him when ur gonna get married and pick out the date, just tell him to be there with a tux on. Most likely he will show up with a blue tux on but remember you love him regardless, lol.|`|nqK90MGcaa	Hmm, well three years is a long time to be together with no proposal, but you don't tell us how old you are. If you've been together since you were 16 and you're only 19, I'd say give it some time. But if you're like, 24, I might wonder what he's waiting for.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	If you are happy with him then stay with him if you are not happy then leave<br>  <br>  I have a friend who was with his gf for 6 years and still no proposal but they are married now so 3 years is nothing<br>  <br>  have you guys moved in together?|`|kYAIt9fzaa	Can I just recommend the movie "He's Just Not That Into You". Seriously. If he wanted to marry you, you'd know. You'd be engaged or married by now. I don't mean to be harsh, just honest....

AA11525464	Your fiance hates it, and you were going to do it anyway?  Personally, I would stay away from purple at a wedding.  It is a color of mourning.|`|hkwBR1moaa	You'll have to very careful if you use purple green and gold.  You don't want it to look too mardi grasish.  Unless you want that look.  <br>  Also, stay away from the oranges if your fiance hates that.  It's his wedding also.  <br>  And Purple is the color of royalty, not mourning.|`|CM1dfztQaa	The gold, sage and cream with dark purple accents sound nice. Here are a couple of other options you may like.<br>  <br>  Pewter and dark purple with a lavender accent?<br>  Gold, burnt orange, with burgundy accents?<br>  Pewter, burgundy, with burnt orange accents?<br>  <br>  Best wishes, and have fun.|`|7CKipTZOaa	I like your initial combo because it seems very original, you could always choose another complimenting color as an accent and use it for the dresses, on the other hand if the other colors have always been your favorite maybe it would be more appropriate for your wedding|`|sGP6s7uraa	My wedding is actually in sage and ivory.  BM dress is sage with an ivory sash.  She's pale, too, and the color looks really good on her (she's got dark reddish brown hair).  I love an amethyst color.  I think that with orange accents would look really good.|`|Xp2De933aa	what about persimmon and chocolate?<br>  orange and brown so to say. and have the dresses be brown and flowers be orange.? my wedding is in may and our colors are peach and creame =)<br>  good luck|`|50ab85f362cbbddab47844295a4bba7caa	I got married in November and my bridesmaid dresses where dark chocolate brown. I decorated with browns, oranges, creams and gold colors.<br>  <br>  Of what you have listed they all sound okay.|`|by9KuBizaa	Choose a color combination that you and your fiance BOTH like. <br>  <br>  Remember, it is HIS wedding also|`|eF92uM2Saa	The new scheme sounds sophisticated and subtle.|`|sLwmzvi8aa	my dream wedding has a orange color scheme... but i like the purple colors... it would look really nice (then maybe have cream/ white roses) it would look great with the purple dresses|`|xuiSfzgraa	I like your color choices!  I think the dresses would look pretty in any of the colors you have chosen, but I think the purple or green would look the best...I don't think the girls with fair skin tones would look good in the gold...I am sure whatever you do it will be beautiful.
7TcxJqW4aa	Don't let a guy pressure you into a relationship if you are not ready. Take time for yourself.. Are you just getting over another relationship? If so, this is more of a reason to wait because he'll just be a rebound. SOmeone to help you get over the other guy. And that's not what a relationship should be about. Be single for awhile, and enjoy it! Go out, meet other people, and enjoy not having someone tie you down. If after that you still want to be with this new guy, then go for it. You can hang out with this guy without being his girlfriend. Let him know how you feel and that you just want to be single for awhile. If he's the right guy for you he'll respect your decision and stick around regardless... But don't rush into things. Good luck|`|Un9CElCaaa	if ur not ready to date right now it will only ruin things. however im in the same situation as that guy right now. the girl i like told me she can't get involved with anyone right now and that she needs to be on her own for a little while. we both just went through bad breakups so i guess it makes sense. she told me im a sweetheart and that i make her happy. i just hope she doesnt find someone else.|`|13LutlWBaa	tell him you're not ready for a relationship and break up with him.  be nice about it though.|`|MZWH11w1aa	Don't EVER let someone tell you that you are not entitled to your feelings...even if they don't make sense to someone else.  Tell him that you just want to date.  Your young and don't feel like you want to be tied down.  This does mean that he is allowed to date too.  I think it is smart for young people to date and have fun without the commitment.  Then if you really start falling in love with someone it's time for a relationship.  People jump too quickly into the boyfriend/girlfriend thing.  It's not necessary.|`|UHIscXDUaa	i suggest ya better neither date him nor leave him....ya jus continue to b gud frenz....n' later decide bout 'tat'....|`|RKLFYS2Naa	welp that's probably okay, hang in there|`|eTBfsjCUaa	Just take things slow.....|`|KHf82wgraa	I really hate to say this, but you need to do whats best for you. It may seem like your being selfish, and if it really does feel that way, then maybe there is a reason for going out with him, because that means you obviously care about him. But if you dont feel any emotion, then maybe it is best for you to take it easy for a while. I know what I just said kinda makes no sense, but read it a few times and it will, at least halfway. Hope it helps.|`|djUMvICoaa	Here's what I would worry about for you in this situation.  He's pressuring you, messing with your mind and he's going to pass himself off as something that's good for you?  I think he has other plans for you things that you don't want or need at this time.  Any guy who wants a relationship will respect you first.  I don't see any respect.  Send Don Juan packing, you don't need that in your life.|`|OBPL49vWaa	i mean if hes as nice and great as you say he is i would keep him around..you dont have to date him just keep it on a friendship level and see if something develops from there. or just take it really slow, maybe he will turn out to be prince charming =D|`|Xzfj17FNaa	never do something you dont wanna do! it will just make your life suck and in the end all you have is you so live for yourself. if he is really into you it will be hard for him to do but he will respect your decision. if not then he's not worth your time anyways!|`|DzunYgWOaa	If you think you need to be single for a while, then he should respect that decision, it's your choice if you want to date. Tell him you need some time alone.|`|rvCbwX1Paa	If you strongly feel you dont want to be in a relationship then dont do it to make him happy. stick to ur feelings, tell him you know what you want and right now its not him.|`|tRNiXtplaa	tell him to let things develop and see what happens
EKp4Cg0vaa	25 years ago, my dad married my step mom in a small private ceremony, and no honeymoon. This year all of us kids (there is 5 of us all together) pooled our money and planned a renewal ceremony.  2 months from their anniversary, we informed them about what we were planning. They were happy about it.<br>  <br>  Hey if you want to renew your vows, by all means RENEW YOUR VOWS!!|`|cgQqHJtKaa	Don't call it a vow renewal, and don't put on the dog-and-pony show of the 2 of you repeating vows. Have a party and call it an anniversary party. <br>  <br>  Whenever a couple 'renews vows' it always comes off as, like something really bad happened, like cheating, and one makes the other go through the vow renewal to show the world they are 'ok' now.|`|AA11312653	To reaffirm your vows is good. To have a fake wedding -- fake in that there is not marriage taking place -- is ridiculous. By all means have a great party, whether formal or informal. Hire a band, rent a limo, buy a few cases of champagne, and have a great time. But invite your friends to a party, not a vow renewal. If you mention anything about wedding or vows on your invitations, the reaction will be "Do we have to get them a gift?" Just invite them to a party and then let the vow renewal part be a surprise. <br>  <br>  If your motivation for doing this is even partly the hope of receiving gifts, please be honest about your motives and have a RENT PARTY, not a vow renewal.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	well, now you know what the realaity of marriage is so base your vows on realistic marriage issues.
duXQDmTRaa	if you are physically not ready for sex, do not go through with it. men pressuring women into having sex with them stems so far back. but the thing is if you ARE ready for sex, then he should respect your wishes as to not having a kid this young. you are way too young to have sex and have children. and who knows...in a year or so maybe you wont even be with this guy anymore. just think things out and dont make any rash decisions because they could haunt you for a long time. but if you do want to have sex and you think youre ready, tell him he isn't getting it without him wearing a condom. that should be your golden rule at this point with him, especially since he expressed that he wanted children. talk to him and tell him you arent ready for children and the two of you need to talk about if you are even ready for sex|`|S6zEIEZXaa	Do you plan on living at home forever or on welfare? (And no offense here to those who live with assistance from welfare because I myself have) If you are that young, you will end up being on welfare because you will have no job, your mother will be disappointed but will likely take care of you and your baby. Think about the strain this would put on your family?! You are way too young and this guy sounds like a scum bag! Seriously? 13 and 14, having a baby so young can cause you to have medical problems the rest of your life. You'll miss school dances, and may not get a job because you'll be taking care of a baby, you might end up missing out on driver's ed and not have a license, there are just soooo many consequences to this and I hope you listen to the advice that everyone is sharing.|`|rWOKfweKaa	Under NO circumstances should you have sex with this guy. First of all, he is showing no respect for you as a woman, by not regarding what you want nor your opinion in all of this. Second of all, he is showing absolutely NO maturity at all. He is hardly breaking out of puberty and he wants to have SEX.. and A BABY..!! I wonder who's going to being changing the diapers if that does happen. You have a whole life ahead of you and you should not let something like this create a fork in the road for you. You have education, career, opportunities, and dreams all in front of which you shouldn't give up for something like this. Trust me, it isn't worth it. You deserve to be respected, loved and take the opportunity to live YOUR life.|`|8Am8S4qUaa	If you're not ready (which no one is at 13), he needs to respect that. rushing in to this is gonna make a whole lot more problems than its going to solve. Don't let him pressure you - if he can't respect the fact that you're not ready then how much does he really love you? Don't give in, be the strong woman you know you are.|`|WpBiIkh6aa	OMG!! you guys are WAYYY TOO YOUNGGG to even be considering that! ok, im jus 4 years older but i highly encourage you wait, @ least until 16! put down your foot and tell your bf, no. let him know you wanna wait till the right time. unless you really want it to, then its your choice but make sure he uses protection b/c teenage pregnancy is no joke.|`|qIgzwUp9aa	dont let him pressure you into sex, and if he doesnt like you telling him you dont want it, then he can bugger off, cause hes got no respect for your opinions!  <br>  and you're way too young to have children, it'd ruin your options and the rest of your life ahead of you!|`|x4QURjBsaa	Here's what you tell him. "babies cost money, your 14, you have no money and we both still live with our parents"   So when he says "we'll get our own place" you say HOW?? YOU HAVE NO MONEY!    I'm 24, I have a friend who has a kid, she's 22. Trust me motherhood with little money is not pleasent.|`|vBHN2WAIaa	u know what to do!<br>  1.ur too young to get pregnant<br>  2.dont<br>  3.especially if he wont use protection<br>  4.i think u should dump him if s3x is all he wants.|`|a21221013e698e43bde95cb755c9a4aaaa	You are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to young for sex, girl.<br>  Your just about out of your own diaper yourself.<br>  DUMP HIS A$$,PERIOD.|`|SOx6VwYCaa	Walk away and stay single until your old enough to date wiser guys!|`|AK8tGzoQaa	whoa whoa whoa, at 13 you shouldnt be having sex, it shouldnt even cross your're mind|`|DLAkIHsDaa	please do not , I am a elder brother so take my advice - leave that stupid & study something for your exam. Otherwise u will really regret in your later years.|`|yZojKc9Waa	maybe you could stab him. hes a douchey|`|uBssj3Znaa	if he won't wear a condom, don't have sex with him. <br>  <br>  you are WAY to young to have a baby as you are still a baby yourself. <br>  don't let him talk you into anything you don't want to do.|`|DfABElERaa	DO NOT do it! You are wayyyyy too young to be thinking about having sex, let alone have a baby! You need to talk to him and explain this, a baby is a lot more work and responsibility than either of you think! Since he won't use protection in the first place just proves how immature he is. So if he doesn't come around when you talk to him, it's time to move on. You're young you'll have no problem finding someone better =)|`|aaRMPDIDaa	He doesn't respect you if he won't even use protection.  When you have sex, you have to be prepared for the consequences...While when you are young, it seems like its all fun and games, but in reality, it's not.  Its an action with real consequences.  <br>  <br>  My personal opinion.  You should not be having sex at age 13, and especially without protection.  Women who get pregnant at 13 have a higher chance of having complications during pregnancy and after.  Also, do you really want to be a mom right now? You are so young and you have so much to experience.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I wouldn't let him talk you into it at this age.  When you do decide to have sex for the first time, please make sure you use protection.  If he doesn't respect that, then he isn't worth keeping around.|`|rqNb6FIraa	Don't do it. i'm 14 and i know that is a huge mistake that will ruin your life! Babies and sex at such a young age ruins everything. Tell him that you're not ready to have a baby and then point out to him all of the reasons why this isn't  a realilistic idea.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	Say no and if he pursues the issue, tell your parents.|`|bZGv0dvnaa	:facepalm: give him a falcon punch to the nads and dump him....
WzAHKILcaa	It's hard withour a picture- personally I would rather have a .25 carat diamond then a 2 carat simulated diamond. . . Plus they are gold plated- the plating can wear off- exposing the under-layers. To be honest- neither seem like good quality to me...|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I would go with the middle one.<br>  <br>  The first one, a 2ct marquise (12mmx6mm) is going to be so long it will border on the ridiculous.<br>  <a href="http://www.ajediam.com/Sizes-of-Diamonds.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ajediam.com/Sizes-of-Diamonds...</a><br>  <br>  The third one with a 9mm width that is substantial, mens rings the average width is 5mm.<br>  <br>  The pave setting is more believeable, 2ct is extremely big, personally I'd go for something smaller and realistic.  A 2ct round will be 8.2mm|`|7UVJe31Taa	Just to clarify: the first ring  has a marquis center & 4 channel set rounds on each side. That sounds pretty, however, if the ring is just plated, the plating will wear off & you won't be able to ever have it sized if your finger size changes, The 2nd ring is more my personal style. I like the way pave set stones make a ring look more like an antique, of course this ring will have the same problems (plating wearing off)|`|2V0c9PdXaa	I would first do my research with one of the professional online jewelers. You can find better quality rings, better prices for diamonds and better policies with one of the more reputable online retailers like <a href="http://www.jamesallen.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jamesallen.com/</a> or <a href="http://www.diamond.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.diamond.com</a><br>  <br>  Buying at one of the online engagement rings and diamond retailers would probably save you 20%-30% in price for the same quality at a local jeweler.<br>  <br>  Most online retailers also give 30 day inspection period and money back guarantee if you are not satisfied. James Allen also has real diamond images of the diamonds so you can see what you are getting before actually making the purchase.

You didn't and probably still don't know who you are without being a housewife. Being a housewife gave you pleasure and your identity. Find out who you are and anything you do can give you pleasure.

This is crazy and immature to do to your wife. And she only talked to other men because of the bad way you treat her, because if you treat her like a princess and truly a wife, then she wouldn' have talk to other men. <br>  If I were her, I would be done with you already. <br>  Fix this, you're an animal.|`|msGQPrrjaa	Kill yourself of better yet.let me work you over with my fists|`|wia9SXCPaa	Yeah, thanks for the 2 points|`|Yleae8hiaa	Not funny. And if your not being funny. You deserve to be in HELL!!!!!
JlDcVTVsaa	If i were you i would stop talking to her and i wouldn't see her or let my daughter see her until she apologizes. <br>  And I also think you should tell your bf that you dont want to have any fights with him because of his mum, and you just dont want to talk about him. of course he can still talk to her and see her like before but he shouldn't expect you to do the same.<br>  <br>  And if you want, you can have a test to show he is the father, then she cant say she is not his daughter anymore. <br>  <br>  and I also think that your bf should tell her to stop talking like that about you and your daughter.<br>  he should stand up for you. <br>  <br>  good luck:)|`|l1KlZrAOaa	The mother is NOT worth your time.

His mom sounds like a pretty narrow minded person who YOU definitely are not going to be able to change. If she is that selfish that she is pushing away her own granddaughter that's pretty low.<br>  What does your bf say about all this? Doesn't he stick up for you? There is some serious issues here and he needs to be the one to address them. His mom needs to at least be civil, and if she can't do that she needs to stay away from you and the baby. Stand up for yourself, do NOT let her call you names, do NOT accept that kind of  behavior. Next time she does something like that leave, don't say anything, just leave. If she doesn't believe the baby is his, make him get a paternity test, prove it to her. and if she STILL continues to be rude stay away from her all together, and tell you bf that you will not let your child be around that.|`|93ix6nyvaa	If your bf is reasonable, he would have kept a good distance from his mother. This is very unhealthy for your relationship and for your whole family. It's just gonna get much worse if this continues on. Try to talk it out with your bf and find a resolution for this. I'm not telling you to have him pick between you and his mom. But make him understand your points and tell him to put himself in your shoes. If your mother hated him because he was black and would not accept him as a son-in-law, how would he feel?|`|APmRrekkaa	First of all......why are you two not married and have a daughter.<br>  You aren't receiving any respect from him.

You cannot make her like you, but it is up to your boyfriend to make things happen with his daughter.<br>  If he doesn't stand up to him mom then there is nothing you can do. <br>  you cannot force something that isn't there. Some people are ignorant.<br>  pray for her.. she will come around.|`|Yby3loNEaa	well one thing you can do is slap her with the dna teat saying she is his but either way she will find other things to say the only other thing i can tell you is not put your daughter ina situation like that she doesn't deserve to be treated like that so look out for her kill the mother with coynessess|`|AA10838463	His mom will never going to be with you for life.

Of course refraining from activity for at least 24 hours would help, but there are other methods. Drink a lot of water, around 2 liters the 24 hours before the deed. Take zinc, and l-arginin, zinc naturally boosts the reproductive system, and l-arginin increases blood flow everywhere in the body, including the genitals. Consuming orange and pineapple juices not only increases the size of the ejaculation, but is said to make it taste better for your partner. Good luck!|`|8MMP9xR0aa	You have to make your penis colder, in that it will produce more sperm.

They'll all be different.  <br>  <br>  Parents get stupid when they're embarrassed.  They should have handled it differently, for sure.  However, you're no less a great person because you didn't get presents.  Let your mom know that you understand, and it's ok.  It's hard, but honestly, it's only 'stuff'.   Maybe ask her to spend some special time with her yet today?  This day is really all about you and your mother, isn't it?<br>  <br>  To make yourself happier, you can think of the good things in your life.  So many people are having really hard times right now and it may not get better really soon.  You might suggest to your family that you start making something for each person for Christmas - think ahead.  Hand-made gifts are from the heart.  That's really where a gift should come from, not the amount spent on one.   Maybe your whole family will get into the spirit.  <br>  <br>  But today is your day!  HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!<br>  <br>  ((((((((BIG HUG)))))))))))|`|QmSIsUZvaa	hang out with good friends, im sure they will make u feel better about ur bday. wen u go to bed @ night, maybe explain to ur parents how u wud have liked a more appreciative birthday. if that doesnt work, then tell them thanks for a great birthday. not|`|HJrTuihcaa	first off, HAPPY BIRTHDAY HONEY!<3<br>  <br>  and second, I'm so sorry, my family did this to me when I was younger. you just have to remember that it's not your fault and just keep your head held high, your parents and brother are mean and don't treat you right.<br>  <br>  <br>  sorry if that didn't help but i just want you to understand that it's not your fault|`|eXTMwatMaa	wow your family sucksss..<br>  <br>  dam i would be soo mad<br>  <br>  tell your mom how you feel<br>  <br>  thats pretty much messed up<br>  <br>  your bday is the day you were born celebrating another year of your life.<br>  <br>  <br>  Go out somewhere with some friend<br>  <br>  have a good time<br>  <br>  ;D.|`|5c40baa93c7ba8164e45f151f1878025aa	I can understand where you are coming from. I have a son who was born 3 weeks after Christmas. So  what do you get a kid who has a birthday 3 weeks after Christmas?  I really feel bad for him because I don't know what to get him plus I am out of money at that point also. But he is older and makes more money then me so he is ok with it. At 13 though it can be tough. Try to do something you like to do today. Call some friends, read a book, walk the dog.  Whatever makes you happy. It's not all about the gifts.
wia9SXCPaa	WHAT ARE YOU ASKING??|`|AA10408380	If ur not happy, and u can't make it work, and find happiness with each other. If u can...are able to, get out. It makes no sense to live in an unhappy union for any reason. When u have kids, it'll make it worse, and u'll ruin the kids lives as well. Do all a favor and get out. Ur hubby knew ur situation, but I guess he liked u and thought he could change ur mind? Maybe that's y he married u. But now ur unhappy. Talk it over with ur guy and see if he'll agree to a mutual divorce, if not, then seek legal help, because since u entered due to family pressure, I don't think they'll be of any help. I only say talk to hubby because if he really wants ur happiness, and he can't make u happy, then he'll let u go.|`|l1KlZrAOaa	Maybe this will help?|`|NGKwsawdaa	If you really don't want to be in a relationship, just divorce him.

If you are not in love with him, file for a divorce and be prepared to make a life for yourself independent of your family.<br>  <br>  You may try talking to them and letting them know how miserable you are.

So first of all avoid pregnancy.<br>  Talk with your spouse and convey your feeling in a very friendly and politely manner and convince him in a manner that he also co-operate you. <br>  Its not such a serious matter which may poise threat to your marriage.

V3LUv44Naa	Since you and Danile are dating he he probably doesn't think tht he has to ask you.<br>  You did the right thing by telling him you would think about it. Just don't think that guys don't talk. If your firedn knows that you go out with the other guy there is a motive behind why he is asking you first. I know alot of guys that purposely call you there frind in hopes to get close and become friends with bennifits.. It will make it even worse if you slept with your boyfriend. If you slept wit your boyfried the friedn is off limits and I wouldn't eve go to prom with him no matter how much you want to go. It could damgae you rep becasue it looks bad. YOUR REP IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PROM.|`|Kg9fUYOVaa	honstly if daniel doesnt ask you out then hes a playa and get tto know the other senior first|`|lcGriJXiaa	It depends how you define "on the verge of dating" Daniel.  If you think that going to the prom with "this senior" will affect how Daniel views you, and that is really super important to you, then don't . . . when in doubt, don't.  If going to the prom "early" is more important to you than keeping the chance of dating Daniel alive, then go ahead.  Besides, you haven't broken any promises, going to the prom with a guy doesn't mean you are in a relationship with him, and Daniel obviously hasn't made going with you a priority.  In my opinion, you're too young to sit and wait for a guy . . . go have fun . . . if Daniel really likes you, he's not going to let your prom "date" deter him from pursuing you.  In fact, it might "light his fuse".
qGDWbJKpaa	He likes you. Like, i cant be 100% positive, but from what you are saying, has definatlly has an intrest in you. Even if it is your sisters friend.<br>  <br>  Flirt back with him.

Stand by your man baby girl.|`|Xd0jFZhDaa	It's what guys do in all relationships, draw back because they need their space to find themselves so maybe that's the case.<br>  <br>  Or maybe he really likes you. Go talk to him about your feelings and tell him what you want. Do not ignore your feelings, sort them out.<br>  It's even better to sort these feelings out together.|`|ff545BLyaa	Does he know you like him?|`|0fVtHNtmaa	You should stop seeing him. He's not ever going to be ready and it's going to be a constant problem.|`|5V5L9DoBaa	he thinks you only want to have benefits. He probably asked you to see other guys in like a "defence mechanism" so that he didnt show you his true feelings and didnt get hurt.<br>  just talk to him and tell him you like him. surely thats easier than having sex and you've already gotten over that hurdle!|`|IAKbseRMaa	Maybe he is just lokoing for more attention. Im not the best at relationships but I do know that if you truely loved eachother then you would stay together. Dont keep trying with him if hes just gonna hurt you in the end again.|`|5e14c31a3045fe59c0b780a5ca6b7a9daa	hon i think he feels this way because he's already had you.... so theirs no need to get in a relationship with you when he's already had sex with you... have you ever heard of "y buy the cow when you can get the milk for free".... and he doesn't want anyone else to have you because in his eyes you are with him sexually, not as a girlfriend, but sexually you are... guys are like that... they get extremely jealous when you try to maneuver out of these types of relationships... so basically, i think you should get out of it and just be friends without benefits because you are getting hurt emotionally... find someone who want to be with you and wants to include the boyfriend title as well... if he gets jealous... let him... oh well... let him see what he's been missing and what he would have had if he would have just decided to be with you, instead of playing these little games...<br>  hope everything works out!|`|6Bh32zqFaa	okay i know what you are going thru i was in the same situation before i had a friend and we started out as friends with benefits also known as a booty call, well feelings started to arise and the situation became different all of a sudden. its not that he does not have feelings for you beleive me he does. you have to think about this men and women are different when it comes to feelings we like to express and show it to the world men dont at times its an ego thing. anyway my situation went that i had feelings for him and i told him and to my surprise he had the same feelings towards me. but true feelings do end as we speak as well and to this day we are the best of friends the question is do i still have feelings towards him yes i do.. can we get back no we cant for the simple reason we learned to grow apart and become two different people at the end.|`|v96pYAg1aa	Hes afraid of the fact that he will lose u that he will do something stupid thing is he has always loved u but could never say it and is afraid to commit for that same reason its hard on him to tell u to date other guys  when he really wants u to stay with him and if it was really that hard for him to say then u know he has strong feelings for u so what he reallt dosnt want to hurt is the relationship u guys have now
QieRAMLkaa	look for public records and give him a call|`|gAuIixm6aa	You can try searching the local public records for his area. BTW I don't mean the phone book, I mean all the legal stuff they keep. Here it is in the basement of City Hall.
150esu4Daa	Growing up I was physically abused on a regular basis and I stayed silent about it. Looking back I wish I hadn't. When this was going on I know for a fact that there were other people who knew what was happening to me who also stayed silent and now I am very angry at them for not doing anything. It's hard for people being abused to stand up and say something, and I really think anyone who witnesses abuse or suspects abuse should stand up and try to protect the victim.|`|74d8704d3b9fcff9814b477383d60eafaa	No, I witnessed 2 counts of abuse, both sexual, one INCLUDED me.<br>  I called the cops both times.
uBssj3Znaa	as long as you aren't in a relationship with any of these guys it is ok. Keep your options open until you find the one you want to purely focus on.|`|AA10873763	Trying to follow along, but having a hard time getting the question.<br>  Are you flirting with these guys?  Or are they just friends?<br>  Guy friends are great.  Sometimes they make a move and get rejected, but they get over it.  I occasionally feel that my male "friends" are just hanging around waiting for me to get drunk enough to sleep with them, but I've learned it's in their nature to try to sleep with anyone they can (sorry to generalize, guys).  I don't take offense, and neither do they when I tell them I don't fark my friends.<br>  Just make a line and don't cross it.  And if you're flirting with your guy friends to get attention, try finding another source of self-esteem.  Like flirting with strangers.|`|ZWJASyMGaa	You may be 19 (technically an adult now), but you clearly are not mature enough yet to be in a serious relationship. Dating is not about picking a random guy out of all the guys you talk to. It's about coming across a guy who you can really connect with and get along with.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	You are a serial flirter, your young and in college, its normal. How far you take things could be an issue. If your being a tease that isnt cool at all. If its all just talk and there's never any lies used to lead them on don't worry about it.|`|RGxqhxDdaa	You may be subconsciously sending the wrong messages.|`|Rq2tMCQdaa	be nice and all, but don't go flirting around and leading them on. when you feel like flirting. don't.|`|JcV2nn4jaa	Nah, talk to as many guy as you like, girl but i would recommend for you to be open with your feeling about the guy when you talk to him and perhaps you should be honest and let him know that you are also talking to other men too.  I mean i am pretty sure some of those guy talk to other girl too, and beside most guys are only after one thing from a girl anyway.  What i am saying is, you are at age when flirting and dating is fun, Its part of the game, so enjoy it.|`|PWN5rqgxaa	you can slow things down by always having a girlfriend come with you when youre talking to the guys... and making sure the guys know its just friends not something more than that... because it doesnt take much encouragement from the girl to get a guys motor running|`|pIw91uFXaa	just hold out a little longer till you find one that you ReAlLy like and start going out with them. but you DO have to investigate into guys on whether they wanna be more than friends. but as soon as it starts feeling wrong, stop and go back to strictly friends|`|wWzK6eJaaa	No its not wrong your young and at college you have the right to talk to as many guys as you want, plus your not in a relationship and your just having fun.|`|0Opi3SWKaa	youre just not ready and u have no need to be. i was a sophmore and met my first love. I got caught up and dropped out and my grades got messed up. im at a 1.44 now from a 3.2. its not that serious. men will be here when u have ur degree.|`|Xu71saGaaa	Can you juggle time well? j/k<br>  <br>  Honestly having a bunch of friends is not an issue. Just do lead them on. Its rude. If you actually like one them, than get to know him better and make a decision.|`|JxNDTbS4aa	figure out what you really want|`|Xv9AaAl2aa	You are a troublemaker...i pity these fools (said in Mr. T voice)|`|8cCueC5daa	just focus on one you will regret focusing on all of em its wrong and when they find out they may get mad cause they like you and think you are just focusing on them that way just dont get caught in the middle of something really nasty ok|`|SIUdAzasaa	What you should do, is actually see how you behave when you are around these men.  You shouldn't flirt with guys, if you want to be like one of the guys...you can't have it both ways.  You either choose a guy or two that you will pal around with or don't have any as close friends.  Men think differently than women when it comes to friendship...they will always try to get in pants first before settling on anything else. It's just the law of the jungle. I know you wouldn't want to be considered a "sl_t"...but if you keep doing this, it may come up as that.  Be careful with your intentions...know what you want... and stop leading men on, if not intentional.  Dating is one thing, but teasing and hanging around is purely another message.
39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	we need to give them the information that they need to be safe, but we also need to impress upon them that there is more to sex than just the physical act.<br>  <br>  many parents did start younger, but most of them would say that they wish they had waited longer.  why?  because sex is as much about emotional intimacy as it is about the physical.  the fact is, there is a much stronger commitment that comes with sex than most kids realize.<br>  <br>  they have to be prepared, physically and mentally, for all of the consequences of sexual intimacy before we should allow it to occur.  yes, they may continue to start early, but that doesn't mean we ought to encourage it.|`|pRF5LLloaa	It's not hypocritical -- it's called EXPERIENCE.<br>  <br>  ALL parents want their children to do better, and especially to do better than they did.  So, having that experience of having sex before being emotionally mature enough to handle it, they try to relate that experience to their children.<br>  <br>  of course, teenagers being the some of the most ignorant beings on the planet, choose to ignore that advice, and end up screwing up their own lives . . . .<br>  <br>   . . . .which, 20 years later, they try to explain to their own children, who then accuse them of being hypocrits.|`|x851kjHuaa	mean unless your up front with your parents then idk but if you think there is going to be not mistakes like getting pregante or and std then if you want to have sex go ahead you are your own person your parents taught you but now its your choice to make the decisiion|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	You are right there are a lot of hypocritical parents and some that are also unrealistic.  First as a parent myself, I could never answer your question as far as what age should kids start having sex--in a perfect world, no "kid" should have sex.  Just because kids have hormones doesn't mean they should be out having sex.  It means that it is an excellent opportunity for the parent and the "kid" to have a conversation about sex and everything that goes along with it.  No parent can keep their kid from having sex, but we can educate our kids and provide them with information and personal experiences to assist them in making their choice.  And if my kid elects to have sex that is their choice, I don't have to be supportive of it and will not allow them to have sex in my home.  Sex is something that is valued to little with today's teens.
0fVtHNtmaa	I can't believe you let this guy around your children for so long. Make him get out right now. He's never going to stop abusing you. If not physically, it will be mentally. He might kill you and leave your kids motherless. Use your head and get him out of your life. Get a support system, family friends etc and get through this.|`|3sOcD8lBaa	you seem like a smart independent woman... make him leave change the locks and put all of his stuff outside (if anything you should be leave the apartment go to a friend's house the day you change the locks) a man that is two faced is not someone that you should be with just because he is nice right now does not mean that he wont revert to his old ways|`|6sTsDvKmaa	Sorry to say, but there is no good future with this guy. It sounds like deep down you know that he is not good for you, and you're slowly taking steps to get the negativity out of your life.  Change is very hard!  But once he is completely moved out I think you will realize that you're better off without his constant abuse and bad energy.  <br>  <br>  You said it, a man should treat a woman with respect, consideration, and loyalty, even when you're fighting.  If he isn't giving you all of those things (and your kids, too), then he isn't worth the effort.  He's known you a long time, and he knows how to get to you, and a freeloading bum like this guy is only going to be nice to suit his own interests, not because he wants to work things out with you.  <br>  <br>  Please listen to your family on this one.  You deserve better, and your kids do, too.  Hopefully you find someone else that is on the other end of the spectrum as this guy.  (but who still has a job!).  That may be the only way for you to see how bad this guy is for you.|`|JCdBSULraa	That's an insane wall of text.  I picked out a word here and there, but it hurts to look at it.  If a guy is abusive to you, and then comes back sweetly to apologize, he probably has the best of intentions, but he WILL abuse you again, and again and again.  You cannot let him get away with it even once.  Just move on and find someone else.|`|Xu71saGaaa	Honestly I dont think any answer here will be concise enough. If you are at all interested in working this out with him.. I would seek couples counseling. If can really help.|`|eF92uM2Saa	His actions are classic for an abuser and you are a model victim.<br>  <br>  Stick with him and eventually somebody will end up either dead or seriously hurt.<br>  <br>  The children will be psychologically messed up.<br>  <br>  Would his success and your admiration of his accomplishments have been worth it then?|`|eEbqfYUTaa	one thing i know that a woman must be loved|`|g1OoQPraaa	guess he can't be that famous if he is broke!|`|GIs1jMhHaa	I don't know the guy, obviously, but this is what it sounds like to me: When a guy tries to surround himself around you more and more, and gets mad when you talk about going out with friends and family, he's trying to control you. He doesn't want you to have anyone so that he can have control over you and you won't have anyone to turn to if it starts getting worse. <br>  He makes he you think he knows you, but pouts like a baby when he doesn't get his way, then tries to sweet talk you into getting what he wants (which is to be on your good side again, or be intimate with you).<br>  He's a bum who doesn't pay for anything, expects everyone to do everything for him and to get everything he wants.<br>  <br>  I mean, you know, if you're willing to work it out, then yeah get the couples counseling, but it just sounds like you're too afraid to move on, because you're already starting to fall into his trap. Whatever you decide to do, be careful.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|xq2J2LMSaa	Get. Out. NOW.<br>  He is trying to trap you, and you have to get out now; before you move, before you marry, before you have kids.<br>  This will never be "good" for you. He is psychologically abusive, and he needs to learn now that neither you, nor any other woman, is going to submit to this treatment.And how you teach him is by leaving and never looking back. Not when he calls, not when he cries, not when he buys you anything.<br>  He is a user. Even if he weren't abusing you, he's using you to pay for his life, and he is complaining. THat constant complaining will wear you down until you're more miserable than he is.<br>  GET OUT NOW.

The man is probably lying about more things.|`|AA10197672	Tell him you'll go back when his divorce is FINAL! However if you do not see a reason why you love him, as you mentioned, then you are not in love with the guy and its just you got used to being around him. So if no love, then leave him, otherwise if you love him enough that you can not see your life w.o him then tell him you'll be back whenever he is done with the ex and he has the final divorce ppw approved by the judge...|`|xQnkYyocaa	Only your heart can really tell you what you want to do. Me, personally, I would give him a chance to show you what he is really about. What else did he lie about?! If you two are in a state where he has no ties, he is more to be himself. If you really love him, give it a shot. If you have doubts, run.|`|2YX18RE2aa	Please tell me your divorce went through.<br>  <br>  If not all the "you poor dear" sympathy is going to a cheat.<br>  <br>  Whether you are or are not divorced there is enough deception going around for a couple lifetimes.<br>  <br>  Actually it sounds like you deserve each other.|`|Wwt72oPVaa	wow, how can you trust him after that? give him a list of the things that need to be worked out BEFORE you take him back. one of them being to actually get a divorce.|`|QJslTCUBaa	This is the same old story...move on and out of his life.|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	My advice:<br>  <br>  Run like hell. Run hard and fast and don't look back.|`|AA12291090	First of all, if he lied about something this big, then what else is he hiding from you?  It is hard to tell someone to just count their losses and leave, but from your story, he isn't worth the hurt he has caused you.  There are plenty of men in the world who would be honest, loving, caring, sincere, faithful, etc,. who would love you for you, care about you for you, and treat you like you should be treated.  <br>  <br>  It's not fair to you to have to endure the pain he has caused you, but only you can decide what is best for you.  If staying and "working through it" is your decision, my guess is that this "lie" he told you will forever haunt you.  If you should decide to leave, your heart will ache, however the wonderful thing about the human body/mind is that in time, it does heal.  <br>  <br>  It's really your decision and no matter what advice anyone gives you, you will follow your heart and your decision for what's best for you and this man.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your journey.  I wish you the best always.|`|dD5uhH8naa	I say cut your losses and live well enough alone he will do it again its only amatter of time
63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	The simplest way is to have foreplay basically all day long.  You can do this with talk, touch, suggestions. Tell him what you would like to do to him later...  Emails are good as well as notes and the phone.  My husband and I (married almost 22 years) do this a lot.  By the time we can be alone we can hardly wait for the sex.  Very fun.<br>  <br>  One time I left a sexy note for him at home and he came home with a friend - kind-of embarrassing, but worth it.  My husband was pleased.  I have left notes in his car.  Be creative.  It's free and easy.|`|AA11401294	let him shave you if that's what you're into!|`|nfQhsRvfaa	I'm married also and when i wanted to spice things up I bought some new risque lingerie..be a little rebellious and wear something really sexy and "bad". Try a new lube that gives a warm sensation or something. Think of some new moves to turn him on like take control and push him against the wall grinding him and kissing him passionately and "take advantage" of him. Maybe buy like a sexy costume or something and look like "his fantasy girl". Men love to see you "out of your comfort zone" trying new risque things just for their benefit. Push him on the bed and give him an amazing ******* but don't let him go off yet...then you finish him off with sex.|`|rawz0RJuaa	you just have to be creative! <br>  i am a red head with short hair and casual taste in clothes.<br>  one night when my husband came home, i was dressed in a low cut black dress with red spike heels, some fancy over-done make up and a long blonde wig. <br>  he was like "woah whats going on!?" <br>  i talked in an accent (he loves girls with accents) and i played this character, said i saw his wife leave so i could not resist coming in to surprise him, talked dirty, etc. just pretended to be a different person and didnt let the character drop no matter what. <br>  let me tell you- that sex was hotttt hahaha<br>  then afterwards i went in the bathroom, became me again and came back in like "woah what have you been doing?!" like i had not been there haha<br>  it was fun and awesome. he loved it|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Love kills slowly has it absolutely right...dress sexy and show him how it's done.

It is ok to start of on opposite sides with the person but yes over time you will learn more about them and know just how they feel at all times.

You are no longer his wife.There for you should no longer want to carry his name . Leave the past where it belongs.|`|Eug52iQDaa	It's ok for your children to have a different last name.  With as many re-marriages as there are today, it's very common.  I'm sure the children will understand completely.|`|cI19nesraa	Having a different last name than your children in more of an inconvenience than anything.  How is your new hubs about the kids? Is their father still in the picture?  Perhaps as a family all of you would like to use both last names to make a new name that all of you can use.  It costs a bit to file a name change but that could be a great way to create family ties for you.|`|PoMCJSz3aa	I took my new husband's name.  In today's world, it's quite common for divorce and remarriage.  If you keep your X's name you will draw more attention to yourself and your new husband will automatically be assumed as the kids father.  Take the new name and relax.  You aren't doing a bad thing to your children.  They will understand.|`|j3mGR2iHaa	2 times married ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh|`|s7seaaPkaa	why does it matter?<br>  i always had a different last name as my whole family <br>  i think you might be more worried then your kids

But that is just not right.|`|HJrTuihcaa	what does he do with the poop?!!?!?!!?!!?!?|`|LzPOzoJVaa	It definatly isn't something your average boy would do, but he obviously loves you so much that he wants to preserve you in any way he can throughout his life.  <br>  I think that you are very lucky to have found someone willing to take something that would usually be looked at as gross and turn it into something good.|`|0Opi3SWKaa	i had the flu and my baby made me soup and totties and rubbed my back and cleaned my nose and everything. I got sick from drinking and he stayed in the bathroom and held my hair while I threw up. I was cryin and stressin over school and he rubbed and rocked me to sleep. I LOVE MY BABY!!!|`|IO8INC21aa	thats really kind of strange!! but aslong as your happy with him doing that i suppose its ok :S xx :)|`|SGjSk5WTaa	That is freaking messed up I am sorry but I would never want that.. GROSS He is a creep you need to get away from him|`|i5tbDTcQaa	no i havent personally, but im glad it has helped you, as long as he is doing it for the right reasons :)|`|sylXsNX7aa	dating-<a href="http://loverdate.org" rel="nofollow">http://loverdate.org</a>|`|9Or4EQNhaa	this has to be a f**kn joke|`|cgHDDdalaa	both of you are ******* nuts

HAHAHA<br>  <br>  That being said, I have no idea what you are talking about, but I'm pretty sure it's not true.  Depends how you look at it, we all die eventually right?|`|3q3QXQp4aa	Thats ridiculous. Not to undermine whatever beliefs you have here but nothing mystical or superstitious can possibly cause the premature death of someone who is otherwise fit and well. Only illness, accident and deliberate killing can do that, not hocus pocus.|`|wOBZEFXFaa	I wanted to look it up, but what is ayilum? Is that another language or a misspelled word? I'm not being sarcastic...I really don't know.<br>  <br>  Do you mean asylum?|`|31c9331ddcd862c867a5893bba5f2ef2aa	Pls dont get affected by such superstitions. Our grand parents and their early generation used to believe all this, but this is an era of science. what  is the logic behind all this? Have u ever thought?<br>  WHatever is to happen, will happen, because everyone is destined for his/her goodor bad times. If u believe in God,  leave everything on HIm, and do your duties.<br>  If, u have any doubt, dont marry such girl,because for any untoward happening, u will blame her.|`|pYoyycHTaa	There are issues better handles by experts; you can take their guidance from this site on all matters of understanding parent psychology…|`|8bu2p3Ijaa	I am 48 years old and in my 48 years i have never heard of that nonsense believe in the Lord jesus christ and you can't ever go wrong stop believing in that bull crap......
vJphK7cwaa	i have a 6 year old son who is about to start LL. my son was born with a few problems, so like yours, unless i tell people they usually don't know. my son did play soccer last year and i was very worried about the other kids upsetting him, but it worked out great. actually he learned to be a better sport, and that you have to deal with people. i think you should talk to the coach. explain the situation to him so that he is patient with your son. i promise by the end of LL you will see a change in your son. kids are like sponges (not always a good thing), he will learn faster than you think. i hope this ends up being a good experience for you both. good luck
d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	So you are saying you have a more difficult life than other people.<br>  <br>  Believe me! You do not want to be in their shoes!<br>  <br>  Even though the grass seems greener on the other side, the truth is that the grass is synthetic! So you are better off were you are.<br>  <br>  Do not worry about others. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!
EVSqPbT5aa	just tell him you love him...and if he doesn't respond the way you want him to, tell him you don't remember ever saying that to him.  works every time.|`|ivsYJPx3aa	south , south ...big mouth!!|`|UI79JnJVaa	"Run your fingers through his hair."
lIpjuMTHaa	Im sure he loves her but he doesnt respect or care about her feelings. Does his wife know? He sounds like a terrible husband.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	No he doesn't. To him they are possessions, a social standing, like a nice car, a nice house. To him women are objects, they're chicks, or females with breasts to feed his children, a women to keep his home clean, dinner on the table, a date to the office party but never a real life partner.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Do you really have to ask that question? So it's totally cool to cheat on your wife as long as she's the one you are going home too? I think not. He doesn't love anyone but himself.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	NO. It means he loves his house, his bank account, and his comfortable life.|`|NGKwsawdaa	no he doesn't love you bc if the hot chick wasn't worth losing his home for, then why would he even bother getting with another girl?|`|lzooHi0Baa	If feeding a lion is your only means of support, would you quit your job?  Of course not.  Get it?|`|tZkHHy5jaa	Yeah he loves his wife and a stable home, but wants some "hot chicks" on the side. He's looking at your reaction for acceptance of his behavior. You will need to be strict with him like a little child and tell him that you will leave him if he even looks like he's playing around. If he knows that he has no chances to screw up, he wont take them.|`|B7kPUmUWaa	No. He does not. He just doesn't want to have to deal with divorce, child support, etc. So he stays with his wife. You don't love someone if you call them "home" and someone else the "hot chick"! That's very disrespectful!|`|zjuMrDmGaa	No, it means he loves having a roof over his head.|`|2add0927fd432feba092329128fecbcdaa	yes
1Z0Lmrk1aa	Horrible trolling.|`|HJrTuihcaa	you can't get aids from licking your dads feet.|`|oOMWYEyaaa	definately a joke ... you cant get AIDS from licking someone.|`|S0UatyU3aa	hahahahahahahahahaa i can tell ur having a good day today lol|`|NxBYuOzbaa	I'm assuming this is a joke, but if it's true, you are SICK.
IIwhkNZuaa	Once everyone starts cheating like this, there is no fixing it. It's too broken to be fixed.|`|d8623817777998723b27ec9173897535aa	i have been dating my bf for about 3 years and he was lied to me almost every time..he cheated on me, dating other girls for about 4 times..but he told me they are only the 'spare-parts"...i really wanna leave him..but i love him so much..i really likes him..i don't know why..i'm so confused and i'm tried very hard to act normal..but i know..we should just break up..|`|bp6ud1AHaa	well i dont think u could fix things no more really even if u guys try, everytime u guys argue he is gonna keep bringing up that u left him for another guy and all that so yea i dont think u guys should stay together no more but its up to u =] thats like one of the main things u need in a relationship (trust)<br>  well goodluck|`|PxLhryHyaa	if there is no trust between the two of you it makes it hard to make it work. you don't want to deal with the hurt and pain all over...it becomes a cycle. to fix things BOTH of you have to want to fix it 100%..can't be just you giving your all.|`|2eGgbhVoaa	It think it would be better in the long run, for you both, to end it. Trust just does not sping back...In fact it might never come back. Don't get yourself trapped in a poisonous relationship of paranoia. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't be saying this so strongly if I had not had any experience in this kind of thing. I had a boyfriend that cheated on me once at the start of the relationship...Two and half years later...I still worried and I still did not trust him. It is only now that I have been in a trusting relationship for three years that I realised how abnormal that was. I don't worry about my boyfriend with other girls, I know he won't cheat on me and I am not jealous of other girls he speaks to because I know he loves me and only me.<br>  <br>  I regret that i didn't end my last relationship after he cheated on me because I spent so much of my life worried about something I shouldn't have needed to worry about. I know now that when a relationship is right, trust is the most essential thing.<br>  <br>  I know you may love him, and that's ok, but what you need to ask yourself is could you really trust him again? Would you worry about him when he goes out without you? Without trust you will always have these issues and broken trust is the hardest thing to fix.|`|6Bh32zqFaa	you answered your own question trust issues will arrise. see you have to understand when a guy talks to a girl it bothers us as women because our first reaction is not a good one. but you have to understand do you really want to continue this for the rest of your relationship. i am not saying you should leave him because in all realitiy that should be your decision. all i am saying is that trust is important in a relationship and if there is no trust there is no realtionship. it will only get worse and your feelings may be hurt as well.|`|5687JygEaa	Talk to him about it. maybe you did or maybe you didn't, but if you love him and he loves you, you guys have to come to an agreement. If he keeps talking to girls behind your back or taking them to his house, tell him that it bothers you. You do also have to remember that people don't like to feel controlled. Talking it out is the best solution and if you guys can't come to an agreement, then give each other a break to fix your problems before going back to each other.|`|KYJDjEcoaa	I wouldn't say it was too broken to fix, but what you have to do is both of you let go of the issues, the more both of you bring them up, the more neither of you will keep behaving, it's just a fact. I've been in a situation exactly the same as yours, & it's hard, it's a really hard one to be in, follow your heart? or your head? But honestly, if you love him & you think he loves you & you are both serious about making it work & make sure you determine between "comfort" & "love" as sometimes you get comfortable with people, who you don't love anymore, but it's hard to see that when you are in the relationship, you've got to have a hard think about why you cheated & he has to have a think about why he did. Then be honest with each other, talk it out, explain why both of you did what you did & be harsh, it's better that way. & then work it out, it's baby steps, but the more you hold on to whats happened, & the more he does, the more likely you are to break up. I hope this helped, good luck!
1BaeFYnEaa	Everybody worries about length when the only "physical" need would be thickness. Expanding vaginal walls can be truly titillating.<br>  But that doesn't mean that a thick lover is a good one. Men of any size have no idea what to do with their penis. To make a woman feel good you firstly have to want that. Observe her reactions at your moves. At your gestures. The more she "trips" and moans, the better you are and you gotta go on that road :D There's no basic recipe, but, as long as it's fun for both in this "game of seeking sensations", you're good in bed.<br>  Being good in bed is not something you're good at with everyone. Sometimes you can't get along. Just like with conversation. It's all about human connection.<br>  4 years experience of mesmerizing men with my skills.|`|EqG8KMQOaa	19. My first boyfriend was pretty nice in size. When I got with my second partner he was like SUPER TINY. Size mattered, I left him. My current boyfriend, love of my life! Is simply perfect. It's how you work it, but if you only have 3 inches to work with, hard, we notice. I think you're fine at your size. Haha.|`|KYJDjEcoaa	not unless you're a girl who's loose... if not, then size doesn't matter... but you have to realize, it does feel better for a girl when she's "filled" so once again, size doesn't matter, it's the size of her & what she needs to "fill" her. hope this helped.|`|TZj4ZU6Daa	size really doesn't matter unless it's extraordinarily small/big - im 16<br>  <br>  even though girls always saying they want "big" they don't really care|`|rQVA71Vkaa	17 and as long as its not 5 inches|`|BDjBVdtRaa	17. Not really. You just need to know how to use it!|`|EVSqPbT5aa	as long as it's not in the extremely small/extremely large range, you're good.  you are good. i'm  21.|`|6K4YX6ulaa	Well..i'm younger than 18 but  it can't be too too short....enough to make it up the V|`|uBssj3Znaa	you are a pretty decent size (as long as you know what you are doing and how to use it) <br>  <br>  Girls don't want too small and there is such a thing as too big, but really if a guy knows what he doing then I am happy. <br>  <br>  oh and I am 26 ...|`|AA11501437	i am 31..<br>  <br>  ok - yeah, how you use it can make up for a smaller size for sure.  try and think of it like boobs - none of them are bad...but some are better than others depending on size.  Any size is good (within reason) but way too small or way too big isn't so much.|`|O97IVzIhaa	I'm roughly the same size as you and i get great responses from women.  Its really about how good you are.  Just remember you can stimulate her whole body and not just her vaginal area anyway.|`|3ISGQ4Csaa	I don't really think women want the huge ones cause they hurt a lot. Your size sounds fine, but of course, it's also how u use it.|`|d8yrvK4waa	Motion of the ocean.. not the size of the boat<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|TfLPRwFWaa	Nope|`|WpBiIkh6aa	Lol! im 17, not that experienced but ive had some partners. i think size isn't most important, its important, but not what everythings based upon. it depends on how the guy works it! lol, but overall bigger sizes make it easier for girls to get what they want; the o word!|`|6Bh32zqFaa	well i am 34 years old and to be honest size should not matter because you can have a huge one and not know who to work it. it works both ways. what counts is that you and your partner enjoy the sexual intimacy you both share with having size matter.|`|gbCBo6ZDaa	i think that size does matter. i mean if you are like really small then that is no fun. my boyfriend is about 7 just like you and i think that it is perfect. you just gotta know how to ride when she bucks. :)|`|6fa2568b75c06da2670c61858c9441ceaa	Sorry, I've had both, and the size of the boat is definitely way more important.

This child is a person and neither you, nor anyone else has the right to hurt your friend like that.|`|WjRqYf6naa	You don't, even if the little urchin looks just like Winston Churchill. She would just be insulted. Sometimes the truth is unnecessary and cruel.|`|QaT680QHaa	just cross your fingers and say "Aww how cute" and whisper "not"|`|eVK2zZsOaa	You don't tell somebody that, that is not nice. If you don't think the child is attractive just pretend.  If you are her friend, you would not tell her that she has an ugly child. You definitely shouldn't say that if you aren't a parent yet. Think of how you would feel if somebody said that to you. Don't do that because that wouldn't make you a good friend.|`|KmC0K59taa	Grace, you don't mention it!  What good will it do?  It will accomplish nothing.  You will hurt your friend's feelings and she will think you are a b****.  She might not want to be your friend anymore.  Your friend will always think her baby is beautiful.  When you have a baby you love it so much that it is beautiful in your eyes.|`|jDFEo7tWaa	This is not important, you don't have to tell her about it. Just keep it to yourself and don't say anything about it. You don't have to tell her just because it crosses your mind, learn to keep stuff to yourself.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	If you value your friendship and want to stay in contact with her: you don't. You have 2 choices:<br>  a) shut your mouth about the baby<br>  b) pretend her baby is cute.|`|74d8704d3b9fcff9814b477383d60eafaa	Hahaha I love you lol<br>  Not really, but that sounds like something id say.|`|AcmfbJVpaa	I think is cruel to tell a mother that her baby looks like Rosemary baby= just say that he is cute|`|CpNVSJpmaa	Don't do it !

She is lucky to have such a good friend. Come to think of it, I don't think she appreciates you enough for how much you've done for her and how horrible it is that you have to look at her hideous baby. Just tell her that you don't want to be friends with her any more because she's a selfish b*tch!|`|IDZTtipeaa	Try being very subtle.  Strike up a conversation about how attractive you think Keith Richards is, or what a gorgeous woman Helen Thomas is now.  Use that to transition into how beautiful you think her baby is.<br>  <br>  Or you could say her child looks like she/he has a wonderful personality.|`|2b547156005b0d9a920fa39c0304936caa	I think if you don't like her baby then perhaps you don't like her as well.  Please do not tell her your thoughts.  This would upset her.  She will then tell everyone she knows about what kind of a person you are.  Please separate yourself from this woman.  She deserves better friends than you.|`|G2tnn5yjaa	OMG! I feel terrible for you that you have to put up with that! Obviously she knows her babby is ugly and she's just being cruel and inconsiderate by making you look at it when it should really be locked in a box. You poor thing! Tell your "friend" to cease all communication immediately or you will get a restraining order against her and her appalling babby. Good Luck!|`|RKZHGqh7aa	DON'T.

b4c080d0f4c39aa94fde4b1f35a009fbaa	Once you are married according to the religious form of marriage you can,register this Hindu Marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 with the Registrar of Marriages where in the District where Marriage took place or where you both reside after the marriage as husband & wife. A valid Marriage Certificate is issued.<br>  <br>  You can even get your religious form of marriage registered under the Special Marriage Act,1954 under which usually what you call the court marriage or the civil form of marriage takes place in presence of three witnesses by the Marriage Officer. Section 15 of this Act provides for the registration of any other form of marriage wherein the couple can get it done anytime they want,after the due process of registration in the Act the valid marriage certificate is issued & the marriage is covered under this Act for any purposes.<br>  <br>  Edit:- 'Officer' (as you are addressed in Army) you are not going for fresh court marriage under the Special Marriage Act,1954 but only getting your PREVIOUS MARRIAGE ACCORDING TO THE RELIGIOUS FORM THAT TOOK PLACE IN JAN,2008 REGISTERED UNDER THIS ACT. For all purposes you will be considered as married in Jan,2008 but your marriage registered under the Special Marriage Act,1954 now in 2009. As far procedure for the registration under this Act too requires giving 30 days prior notice,three witnesses with proper Photo Identity proof, proof of marriage (Photographs of marriage ceremonies, marriage certificate from priest/temple,wedding card if any), passport size photographs of both,proof of age (birth certificate,passport, Senior School Certificate mentioning date of birth) & residence (ration card,passport,voters' Identity card, in your case the Army station posting documents will be enough proof of 30 days in the district)  & presence of BOTH OF YOU at the time of giving notice & its registration after one month.|`|AA12346188	Yes.<br>  This could be done.<br>  No problem.<br>  You have to produce the relevant documents such as Marriage Invitation and Photos.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Yes it is. If your Hindu marriage was not officially registered then the day you get married in the court and register your marriage will be your official marriage date. A far as your army records are concerned, you can tell them that you got married in 2008 with a religious ceremony but registered later in 2009.
6OxMpo9vaa	hiya, <br>  <br>  i used to have an au pair and she was brilliant were still friends. sorry i dont have any advice i just wanted to share this with you.
d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	hmmm I got a bit lost...but here is the thing.<br>  <br>  You can not control people and people will do as they wish. Accept that others may not feel what you feel. Nothing you can do beyond suggesting something.<br>  <br>  Lastly, if children are involved, they always become the victims of manipulation by either the father, mother or both. Not much you can do here either unfortunately. <br>  <br>  Just pray that things will resolve in the best way when it comes to the kids. As far as yourself, worry more about you than the mental games that other people might do. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!

eVK2zZsOaa	Just come out and put the moves on her. If you think she likes you and she sent you a text message on Valentine's Day (of all days) just go ahead and ask the girl out. They can't be too serious if he is cheating and I am pretty sure that it wasn't one time (especially since she forgave him). Ask the girl out but be prepared to have to deal with him because he might not like it.|`|AA12150589	That's a bad idea! If it's meant to be, it will happen because she will want to be with you as much as you want to be with her!|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Hey amigo all is fair in love and war and love's a battlefield. Look each girl is different, some you just sit down to a chat and then that is it. Some you need to coax out. Some you need you need to use reverse psychology. Look it is a serious case by case sort of thing. So my advice go for it.|`|6286059824182c4e7ff0e287e5969887aa	You like her and yet  you didn't make your move when you could. Women usually like men with attitude and men who know what they want. that's the type of guy who gets everything. You are obviously not that type, and you probably will never be. she won't leave a man ( even if a bad one) for a puss*|`|PK5Elowdaa	You can't steal anyone's girl.

Oh you poor thing, instead of taking care of herself.<br>  Drama Queen for sure, you want that in your life? Down the road you will be the SOB.<br>  In my opinion nothing is worth taking, stealing, those words sound bad ergo it is bad.<br>  Let her leave the relationship wait awhile to make sure she is not going back. Then get to really know her, you may find that the guy she was dating was not what she said.|`|ry59PaDxaa	Just be her friend. She wont respect you if you try to convince her to leave him for you and if she does then one day she will wonder why she did that in the first place.

She will either learn for her self that he is a bad guy and then later down the road after she has been single for a while she might realize that you are the one she wants but never try to get  her to see it. Just let it happen.|`|9fEeteY0aa	A knight in shining armor, come to save the damsel in distress, eh?<br>  <br>  Having been in your shoes, don't. Bother. She's gonna glue herself to this guy while she considers the possibility of leaving him for you...until she realizes she's being "wrong" and will completely cut off contact with you.|`|ze4Gt1araa	I'll say that's pretty low stealing someone elses girlfriend if she's with him is for a reason. My advice will be let her break up with her boyfriend and then you could go for it but stealing someone's girl aint a good idea.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|WZe1D2jaaa	Wait for her to see that he isn't a good guy and to break up with him. Then wait for her to get over him. <br>  <br>  After all of that, if she seems receptive, ask her out on a date.|`|EayT8T5Gaa	EWWW WATH A DUMB BF SHE HAS!! WHY WOULD SHE EVER FORGAVE HIM. BUT HEY IT WOUDN'T HURT FOR YOU TO TRY ASKING HER ON A DATE AND TELLING HER HOW YOU'RE FEELINGS AND THEN JUST ASKING HER FOR HER FEELINGS AND ASK HER HOW SHE FEELS FOR YOU.|`|Ekzym4kYaa	learn to fight really well<br>  and you can seduce her to come with you instead<br>  <br>  the fighting skills is for when the guy come after you
be0YaDUPaa	Well, I don't know if it is crazy to be attracted to your mom.  Some people do have "hot" moms, and your role in the family hasn't entirely been just that of a kid.  So you see her as an equal rather than as someone with authority over you, like a kid would usually see a parent.  I'll say it is probably ok depending on a few things.  First, you probably need to spend a little less time with mom for awhile.  I'm not saying completely get away from her, just cut back where you can, especially with the close contact.  The feelings of attraction could fade just based on that, with time.  If you can talk to a counselor or therapist, that would be good.  If not, try to see if you can get past it just by filling your life with other things (school, work, friends, girlfriend, hobbies).  If you feel exactly the same after a year or two, then you might really need to find a way distance yourself from mom and to talk to a therapist.  You do NOT want to be 30 and married and still fantasizing about your mother.  While it's a little unhealthy now, it would be seriously unhealthy then.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Your not sick or weird buddy and this is actually quite common. Girls will have attractions to there fathers like this if there mother dies. If it bothers you to the point of distraction then you should seek professional help. It's probably best to not  say anything to your mother and keep it yourself. If she was sending signals to you, then perhaps you could say something to her. I think you will be just fine.|`|Eug52iQDaa	There's nothing wrong with you.  You were placed in a position never intended for you.  You do need to sort these feelings out, however, and should see a psychologist.  You're not crazy!  It's just that a professional can help.  Really.  Don't beat yourself up about how you feel.  Just go talk and get it figured out, sweetie.|`|3FmO9ACaaa	you see a women that your proud of and needs your reassurance and that is fine but you must do something for yourself and be with friends. i think if your mother knew then it would probably destroy her. At eighteen your hormones are still racing. May be you need to see your doctor and he could give you some advice. please don't bottle it up there is help out their.good luck to you.|`|7p8ktV0Eaa	I think you need to find a life of your own without your mother. I think she relies too much on you. She shouldn't be doing that to you. I think she knows what she is doing, and I also think she knows how you feel about her, but she's not going to say anything. She needs to find another souce of help. You need to begin to detach for your own good as well as hers.|`|oOMWYEyaaa	i must agree with the 1st comment left .. <br>  <br>  You have done nothing wrong, but i do believe that in your best interest you should go see a psychiatrist, you can vent to them and sort your feelings and thoughts out the correct way ...|`|5QeDCBZDaa	hey, You can't help these feelings. When you became the man of the house you were quite young, just about to go through pubertey. This feelings you are having is because you are like a father figure to your siblings. I don't think you have feelings for your mum i think you have you want to have something like that. Like a family. Maybe you should try seeing a doctor? They can help you. And your right don't tell your mum this. I know this sounds mean but she will get freaked out by it. Whatever you do do not act on this feeling for your mum. It will seriously mess your life up! You spent nine months trying to get out of her thing, don't spend the next nine years trying to get back in lol|`|G64z6K1naa	As many people would say: There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with you! I dont want to go all science on you but it is proven that sons will actually think of thier moms like that at least once sometimes without even realizing it. You probably feel like this because you are the "man of the house" and thats good to be able to help your mom, you should be proud. We all think our moms are pretty, i think myn is because she looks after me and is there for me. And don't worry about the sex thing because girls sometimes think of other guys during sex.<br>  I hope this helps
KmC0K59taa	I honestly think your wife and her sister are both very immature.  I bet you are both in early 20s?  Your wife has a lot of growing up to do.  She needs to be loyal to you and make her sister have some respect for you.  The problem probably is that she has no respect for you behind your back.  She might be trash talking you to her sister and she thinks it's okay to do it too.  <br>  <br>  I love my husband and I don't ever talk smack about him.  I would never let anyone in my family talk smack about him. Respect is the number one thing in a marriage.  If you don't have it for one another, your marriage will not last.<br>  <br>  For now though, I would stop going with her to her sister's.  Maybe go once a week.  Tell her why you won't go.  Say you are tired of being disrespected.  If she wants to see her parents invite them to your place.  Sounds like you need to grow a pair!|`|PZStgtdKaa	Be smart get a job further away and see if she comes with you. Do not give her any ammo by acting up.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Dump her.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	You knew it before you got married and you still married her.  Live with it.  Suck it up.  Be a man.  We all have some family or family-in-law BS in all of our lives - it's part of being married.  Welcome.|`|2mBupx1baa	If she loved you the way she should (as her husband), your wife would DEMAND her sister to treat you with respect.  But you can't expect her to ditch her sister either.  There has to be a happy medium somewhere.  And if your wifes not willing to work on this with and she just takes off to her sisters, than your not really meant for each other.|`|5d47f5c40ed414155d99dfc8626076d3aa	I can see visiting her family 2x a week and yours 2x a week if you have any you never said .and that leaves 3x a week for you and her alone any children.I have been married for 14 years and that's how it is done in my family and his and we are all ok with it.and i have 2 kids that don't belong to my husband before we got together 27 &23 and we have a 13 year old. if your wife doesn't like that then why is she there.if you don't get time together your marriage will fall apart.|`|B7kPUmUWaa	Have you tried talking to her sister? If not, then make a date for the three of you to go and clear the air. If you want to stay married, it sounds like you're going to have to patch things up with the sister. They seem to be pretty close. And no, don't be the jerk. That will only make things worse. Just talk to her sister and let her know how much you love your wife and that it would be best for your wife and your marriage that everyone gets along. The credit cards are a whole other issue!|`|JuqxbJ3Daa	It sounds like your wife has been talking about you behind your back to her sister. And of course she going to side with your wife. The same thing happened to my son. I'm not trying to be mean but your wife needs to keep her business at home. This won't stop unless your wife stops badmouthing you to her sister. I could see going out to eat once in a while but 4 times a week that excessive. She's your wife and she should be spending some time with you not out 4 times a week. Maybe you have to fight fire with fire and start going out with some your friends. Let her have a taste of her own medicine. Good Luck.|`|TDiRmT9daa	You need to have a conversation with your wife and it has to be about you and her, not about her sister or her family.<br>  <br>  It is not your sil's fault that your wife chooses to take time away from you to spend with her. That is a choice your wife makes and it doesn't work for you. Let your wife know what you want and need in terms of spending time together. Then do your part by making that time pleasant and she will want to be with you.<br>  <br>  It is not your sil's fault that your wife chooses to say disrespectful things about you to her. That is also a choice your wife makes and it doesn't work for you. Let her know that complaining to family members about each other leads to difficult and uncomfortable situations and that you need her to be respectful and work out her complaints with you - not her sister or anyone else besides you.<br>  <br>  It's not your sil's fault that you feel uncomfortable around her. That is a position that your wife has put you in by choosing to stand against you. Let your wife know that you want and need her to make choices that foster unity between you and all of her family members. This is the only way in which she can value her family and you at the same time. If she's smart she will realize that she is not getting "support" from her sister. She is making enemies for you so she can have allies and this is poison to a marriage. <br>  <br>  Your sil did not create this problem. You and your wife created it. She made choices that are not healthy for your marriage and you allowed yourself to react and hold anger and resentment towards her family for her choices. <br>  <br>  Now both of you are making a bad situation worse. The more you react, the more she has against you and the more she uses her sister against you. The more she runs off to her sister to avoid working out the problem between you, the more frustrated and angry you get. The more you react, the more you give her reason to run off to her sister and complain about you. Do you see where this is going?<br>  <br>  As long as she keeps doing the same thing and you keep doing the same thing, you will have the same thing! Nobody wins because you're too busy fighting each other to notice you are bombing your own house!<br>  <br>  If you really want to fix this, you need to stop blaming other people and start taking responsibility. You need to make it clear what you want and need from her and be willing to meet her needs and wants of you. You need to both review the choices you have been making and look at the outcomes of those choices and decide whether they are working for you or not. If not, you need to start making better choices - ones that will bring you closer to your goals rather than taking you away from the kind of relationship you want to have.<br>  <br>  But first, you have to decide what kind of marriage you want to have. When you know what you want to build together, then you can start investing in it and judging your choices by whether they support what you want to build or tear it down. So get together and talk about what you DO want instead of arguing over and over again about what you DON'T want.|`|eWMn7dhKaa	First and foremost, that's her sister and her family.  Not to be too blunt about it, but you have nothing to do with that relationship of hers.  It is something that you're just going to have to live with since you knew going in to the relationship that she had a family, whether they were communicating or not at the time has nothing to do with the here and now.  After seeing how much less you care about her leaving to her sister's house, your wife should start leaving less often.<br>  <br>  Second, you should be the bigger person and keep trying to communicate politely with the sister, even if she keeps ignoring you.  Just keep your chatter to a minimum and only on broad non-intrusive subjects.  Maybe eventually she'll get her head out of her butt and actually talk to you a little more often, but I doubt that will happen so don't hold your breath.  What this does is show that you are a bigger person than she is and the family will catch on to this.<br>  <br>  Third, you should take your wife out just the two of you and/or your kids if you have any to someplace a little more often so that she won't be going out with her sister that much anymore.  Obviously don't just spring it on her, because it will be too late.  Plan for it and make sure that she knows the plans.|`|c5UAa65qaa	There are easy compromises to be made here: for instance, she cuts the visits back to a couple of times a week and agrees to make more of an effort to resolve your personal issues together before taking them to other people if you give up on trying to win the sister's approval and worry more about making sure that you can resolve your arguments in a way that satisfies both of you instead of the impression her stories make on other people.  You both just have to be willing to make them.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	Your wife sounds selfish and inconsiderate of your feelings.  She need to cut the time down she spends with her sister once and for all, after all she is married to you not her sister.  Maybe her sister likes you more than a lot or hates you, what ever the reason she sounds jealous and needs to get a life of her own.  Hold your ground even if it hurts.  Maybe you could try talking to your wife's folks about the situation.
KM50wTbHaa	at the end of the walk just go for it but not during the walk because then it could get awkward. Just lean in to him but don't put your arms around him to trap him or anything.|`|1gWQh9tWaa	be bold and  make the  first  move  try grabbing  his  hand and  see  how  he  reacts and  if  he's  holding  onto it  then kiss  him on the  cheek|`|qDpFSqn4aa	Why does he have to be the one to make the first move?  why can't you just kiss him.  My ex girlfriend had never kissed a guy in her life (she was 17) but the very first night I took her out, she kissed me goodnight.  I fell deeply in love with just that one kiss.

What you really want is for him to never forget you, to dream about you at random moments for the rest of his life.  So, try to make every walk home special in some way.  Find a flower, or animal.  Tell a joke, or part of a poem.  Ask his opinion on something important.  Then, no matter what happens, you two will always have treasured memories.  No matter who you two link up with later, and what happens with that, you will always know you are loved.|`|cEIpOQAKaa	Wear a SEX bracelet..and then tell him you cant get it off your wrist, and tell him to help you, then he'll break it and have to kiss you.<br>  <br>  OR..<br>  <br>  You could play spin the bottle with a bunch of your friends and him and his friends :)|`|k4I9dG0Caa	no dint touch his penis give him a hug good bye and then while your still huggin give a peck on the cheek that way if hes smart he'll know how you feel. and when he loks you in the eyes give him a sexy face !!!!|`|oBjQXtxCaa	Find some mistletoe.

2gstVBcMaa	I think it all depends on the child and the relationship with the child's other parent.  Me personally, after having a VERY bad a horrible experience with being in a serious relationship with someone who had a kid, i will think long and hard before i ever do it again. (the child was 9-10 when we were together.<br>  The relationship ended because of the child and the childs mother and her quest to make life miserable.  The child had, as you described, a personality that lacked.  And it all came from the training of his mom, i was not going to live a life being disrespected by a kid and a women who told the child it was OK to do so.  She had a problem with respect as well (as well as a long list of other issues i will not go into)  I know what it is like to be in your position and i wish you the best because i know how bad it really can be.  For me, i am not sure if it is worth it, but you need to do some soul searching and really figure out if this is something that you can deal with for the rest of your life.  I came to the conclusion that i was not going to sacrifice my future happiness, because in the situation i was not going to be happy (and certain people were going to make sure of that).  Good luck sweetie.  If you ever need to talk about it more feel free to e-mail me.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	I married a man with two kids from his first marriage.  They were always respectful and loving, so no problems there really.  As a step parent you are expected to care, love, give as if the child were your own, and that can sometimes be a very heavy load of responsibility, especially if you are also fighting drama with the ex and if your spouse isn't there to back you up.<br>  <br>  I would do it all again, but then my husband was/is a very strict disciplinarian and wouldn't ever let the kids get away with acting poorly.|`|c815f0954f0cc607a22f3e49bfd31b48aa	If you love him, marry him. But let him know how you feel. It's important that his daughter treat you appropriately. Also, if he loves you, he shouldn't be okay with someone, anyone, disrespecting you. But a little extra effort to bond with his daughter would be a good start for you if you want to build a life with him. You may even feel like you're sucking up to her but keep in mind, her parents are apart and she's probably confused with good reason.|`|RGcXgjEDaa	I can understand both sides of the fence on this issue, I was the kid with the step father and mother and my boyfriend has a kid from a previous relationship.  My step mother never cared for me and I always knew it which made the relationship between me and my father rough.  My step father treated me like his daughter and I will never forget it.  <br>  <br>  If you love him and have a problem with the attitude his daughter has then talk with him.  Just because you are not one of her parents does not mean you can't discipline her when she is being bad.  I know it is hard to know where the boundaries are what you should say to her and what not to.  Just ask your boyfriend.  If the 2 of you are going to get married then his daughter will have to get used to you.<br>  <br>  No one said that you have to love your step kids like your own, but the people who do are some of the best people around.  If you really can't stand his daughter then you need to move on from him and find someone with no kids.  That will always be his daughter and he will always love her and take care of her, that is his responsibility. <br>  <br>  I am sure that if you marry him that one day you will want kids of your own, will you be able to treat (not neccessarly feel) his daughter like your own?  If not then I would suggest you find someone that has no kids|`|f204f9a2a08b07906da7fcc16e34e34daa	I would do it over again in a heartbeat.  I am blessed with a wonderful, kind, compassionate husband and two beautiful, kind, very well behaved, and intelligent stepchildren.  Have I had struggles?  Yes indeed.  All of which were/are a result of dealing with their birth mother, who is only a mom when it's convenient for her and she doesn't help out financially.  The kids live with me and their father full time.  I've been able to learn a lot about myself in the years we've been together.  I have no children of my own and don't plan to have any at this point in my life.  I work hard at trying to keep my emotions in check when dealing with their egg donor, but make it a point to never speak ill of her around them.  It's all what you make of it and what you are willing to tolerate.  If you are hesitant now, then be careful.  Don't hurt the child.|`|b80Zhg6Uaa	She's 10 years old...For a lot of kids, that's just a bratty age. She'll grow out of it. It's not expected for step parents to submit to disrespect. If she's disrespectful, then she should be diciplined for it... I was a good kid who had a problem with a very mean stepfather. At first I thought it was because I wasn't his, but I now realize he's a jerk to everyone. I'm not saying you're anything like that because I don't know you... I'm just asking you to not treat the kid terribly just because she's not yours. When she grows out of the bratty phase, you may end up having a good relationship with her|`|3iljgiZRaa	I would NEVER mary someone with kids. My sister is a step mom - and has been in the child's life since he was 5 months old (no, she was NOT the "other woman") ... things do NOT get better. If the mom is still a drama queen and their kid is ten years old, then trust me - that situation is not going to change any time soon. My sister has been dealing with this for almost 6 years now and it is wearing her down. The abuse and disrespect that step parents take from the other biological parent and sometimes the kids is ridiculous. <br>  <br>  I don't recommend wasting any more time on this relationship - I am sure there is someone out there for you that doesn't have a kid and an ex that will forever be governing your life....|`|AA11605393	I have 3 step children and yes it is worth it. If those kids aren't respecting you, your boyfriend needs to be the one who steps up to the plate and makes them. ultimately your relationship with them will be based on how HE handles things.|`|3rkpcXodaa	dont marry himif you dont ove his girl... learn to like her before you get married|`|QvxUDjdGaa	I hate my step dad with a passion......just saying|`|1hpctY4saa	I would do it over again.  My wife has a child from a different relationship, who was three when we got married.  It was a perfect age as she was very impressionable, and her father was never in the picture - so I adopted her.  I do think that it makes it easier for me that she is almost a "clone" of my wife, and looks exactly like her.<br>  <br>  It hasn't always been perfect or the ideal situation.  She was very jealous at first that her mommy wasn't giving her full attention.  She also still favors her in many ways, but that's just something that I have to accept, not get jealous about, and still nurture the relationship along.  It's different because "we" didn't have that strong bond from the start (compared to a typical nuclear family), but it's just something that blossoms with time just like any other relationship.<br>  <br>  Each situation is very unique, depending on personalities, if both parents are involved, and how old the child is.  If she is 10 then you may face a LOT of resistance at first, but may change over time as you earn respect.  But you may never have a real close relationship with her, and you have to accept that.  It's definitely a package deal.  You can't love her dad, but not love her.  She's a part of the picture, and that will not change.<br>  <br>  You also must accept beforehand that the ex will add extra drama to your life.  I was fortunate because the biological father signed off his rights and allowed for me to adopt her, but it could have been a much different story.|`|KmC0K59taa	I can relate!  My husband's son with his exwife was 7 when we got married.  He is 10 now and I've never been really close to him.  He looks just like his mom and he talks like her.  He uses the same phrases and words.  It gets to me.  I'll be honest, it's hard for me to love him at times.  I see my husband's ex when I look at him.  My husband doesn't even speak to his ex he hates her so much.  I have to deal with her about pick up times usually via email.<br>  <br>  We have a 2 yr old daughter now and it's still hard.  My stepson was really jealous for the first year (his mom has no other kids).  He'd make mean comments and would make me mad all the time.  Now he will talk to her in a retard voice and that irritates me.  He is smart, gets straight A's and he thinks my daughter is stupid b/c she can't say her ABC's yet.  He doesn't understand that she is a baby and that he was a baby once too.<br>  <br>  His mom raises him in a way that I would never raise a child.  He doesn't even know how to wash his hair in the shower or pick up after himself.  She babies him so bad.<br>  <br>  I can't say it will get better.  I loved my husband so much that I chose to deal with his son and ex.  Our daughter is awesome and the light of our lives.  I focus on her when he is around and my husband deals with him for the most part.  We only have him on weekends or every other weekend anymore.  <br>  <br>  I have tried to love him more and be a good stepmom.  It is hard to love someone else's child.  Especially when you hate the mother!  I wish I had a big enough heart to love him unconditionally, but I just don't.  I would never hurt him or be mean to him or disrespect his mom in front of him.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, hon.|`|zDhTTGlxaa	of course it is!....the old saying 'blood is thicker than water' is rubbish. your own genetic offspring can give you as much grief as a stepchild....and a stepchild as much joy and pride! Remember that you need patience with any children and the ability to be hard but fair when laying down the rules. Every child will respond to the security that both love and discipline can offer and over time will respond with respect.|`|cIwWng48aa	If you love him, you should love ALL of him. And that means his children. Don't go into it if you don't ... Kids are whiny and have a bad attitude... but so do adults. They are just learning. Do you love him? Do you love his daughter? If you go into this thing and are not 100% in it, you may be divorced before you know it.|`|H24DtUKOaa	I hate my stepmum and that means I have not spoken to my dad in over a month because he refuses to see me. He's made his choice but it's ****** us up forever.<br>  Think about it from her point of view before you get into it or you'll **** your husband and his kid up for life|`|YkseyT7zaa	You're not marrying the child. Your BF needs to set the rules on how his daughter treats you.<br>  If you can take the "Step" out of the relationship, things will get better|`|AA10873763	In my opinion and experience - no.<br>  If you're not in love with the kid, don't do it.  It's a package deal.<br>  You can keep the relationship going without marriage and living together, if that works for you.  The kid will be less involved in a few years, but never out of the picture entirely.
lIpjuMTHaa	I would be there until I knew it wasn't going to change. I would try an intervention or a wake-up call. That's what I did to my boyfriend and I got him to agree to a rehabilitation program which he went to and completed and is now 8 months sober. We have never been better and Im glad I stuck it out, but if he made it clear that he didn't want to change his ways (he was using and selling hard drugs) I would have left.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Add:  lyrebmik that's wrong that its about how much they love you, it has nothing to do with love. The drugs power over the mind is stronger than any you could have without them going to rehab. Either your boyfriend is lying or he wasn't using hard drugs.|`|ev33OxJbaa	No|`|SsfnitjXaa	Sorry but I don't date people that do drugs or smoke.  Drugs are illegal and getting involved with the law is the deal breaker.  It is easier to stop oneself from getting involved early on.  <br>  <br>  I need a partner that will be there for me.  I love many people that are in my life.  They obviously don't love me more then their problem.  Besides people that do drugs and smoke are week people and have other personality problems, best not to get involved with them.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to leave them to their self destruction.|`|o9F9iJ8eaa	yeah|`|6CAsx3jaaa	part of it depends on the type of drugs they use. pot isnt addictive so wouldnt be as destructive. i would break up with anyone that sold drugs though. i have in fact broke off a relationship because they had pot at their house and i saw them come back with loot from a robbery. if the cops broke into the house i would probably have gone to jail too. wasnt worth it to stay .if they use addictive drugs they have to go to rehab or its done. i would suggest watching sober house on vh1 for more info|`|yVKlAQ0oaa	I was in a situation very similar to this, I stayed with her how ever in the long run she stopped for me and we are still together after years. If he can't stop may be you two and sit down and try to talk about some proper counseling that you could go to as well for support.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, Yes, how ever may be you guys could work some thing out.|`|3rkpcXodaa	ask them to stop if they dont go to get help  but i would still love em'|`|zrj8jhssaa	depends on what the drugs are. weed and shrooms, I don't care|`|1o3OqSioaa	If you are already married and have children, then you have a real issue, and it becomes way more complicated.<br>  If you are just dating, then it's way best to walk away now, before you do have any children with this person. Love will not be enough to get you through all of the bad times that I promise you will happen. I've lived that life (was already married and had kids before I found out), and it was hell on earth for everyone. You will end up hating him one day for all that he put you and your kids through. There is no happy ending when drugs are involved. Please trust me on this, get out while the getting is good. I know you can't see down the road right now, and that all you know is that you love him. Everything probabaly seems fine now, but you will pay dearly with your tears, broken dreams, and may end up in jail (like he will) for being associated with him.<br>  This can't and will not end up with a white picket fence, and a warm loving home full of happy children, and a fairy tale ending. It will end, but not without you suffering with unimagineable pain and heartache, and the fence will be a 15 ft. high chain link fence topped off with barbed wire for him. You will end up with emotionally damaged kids, and alone trying to pay the bills on your broken down trailor, and begging for food stamps so that you can feed your kids.<br>  I'm not kidding, and I'm not being a smart a**. I'm telling you like it is, and I just hope you will get the point, and save yourself while you still can.|`|JZMfUDylaa	depends on what drugs if its marijuana then yes i would still love him because marijuana (compared to meth cocaine ext.) is not really a drug. It's a plant grown by God himself. Tobacco and booze are 10 times more dangerous than pot. People are just brainwashed by the media and it's lies about pot like above the influence for instance. All lies when it comes to pot what they really need to tell kids is to stay away from meth coke, heroin and booze. When the kids find out that the media lied to them about pot it's just gonna make them want to smoke. And if you don't believe me then I suggest looking up this site: norml.com it has TRUE facts of marijuana.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	no i wouldnt. I only would want to be with someone i could see myself having a family with. I cant have a family around the fangers of drug dealing or around someone who used them.|`|lBKfmRWCaa	Trouble is when you are in love you will overlook a lot of things. In the cold light of day, I would run as far away as possible.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	I would never, ever get involved with anyone that did or sold drugs.  I'm smarter than that.  I'll date a beer drinker though.|`|QvxUDjdGaa	get rid of Him, if they wont stop using for you then they don't really love you. Selling them and using them could land  you in a lot of trouble.|`|9YAP6MmUaa	not if they were selling them - id try to help them get off it - but theres no clear cut line where love is involved|`|PY160XO7aa	I did get them help and if the refused SEE YA!!!!|`|IAKbseRMaa	I would not love them.<br>  Im straight edge.|`|6xmIPYimaa	yeah but i would try and get them help|`|SovaFpN8aa	I know your reference is a spouse or significant other, but my experience is with my son. He was using and selling drugs, he got busted twice, he was stealing from us, he was destroying our house. We offered to get him professional help, he rejected the help and us as his family. I ended up making him leave, he was tearing apart our family. He has been on his own for 14 months.<br>  You can't make any one change. They have to want to change. They have to want you to help them.<br>  I still love my son, I pray for him every day. His life is hard right now, and I hope he is learning from his difficulties. If he wants to change, I will do everything in my power to help him.|`|goY0JHzlaa	Nope. Because if I told that person I didn't like what they were doing and they weren't willing to give up their habit, then, I would have to move on. Why set yourself up for a bunch of heart ache and turmoil? Because that's where this relationship is going to lead. And quite possible you could be charged with conspiracy for knowing what he/she was doing. It does happen and people go to jail for this stuff. What type of future does that give you?  Or that person? It is a road to nowhere. Well, I take that back. A road to jail or being 6 feet under.|`|j7P5QAt7aa	You love them because you love them not of what they do. But selling and doing drugs is wrong D: so talk to them but if this person does something to you like abuse you call the police immediatly becuz the situaition has gotten out of hand and you cannot handle it alone.|`|gsnYjqKsaa	i have to say do what your heart says but people who sell drugs really aint  any different then the working man , they just work in a illegal way, yes you will always have that fear of them going to jail or something stupid like that, but thats one of them you have to let your heart decide but more in likely they wont quit selling or doing them for you|`|p6XPhIxnaa	I mean it depends if they are doing it around you, they should love YOU enough to respect the fact that you don't approve of the things they are doing. But if you can stand it just as long as it's not around you then you should be good.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	Nope.  If the man I loved did and sold drugs then he wouldn't be the man I love.  I have no room for that sort of crap in my life.|`|KddwYRFRaa	If it really bothered me enough to ask, I wouldn't stick with them. I would have a very serious discussion with them and basically ask what's more important, me or the drugs?|`|gjaPNWbTaa	No.  Love does not conquer all.  If someone I love completely had such a destructive force in their (and by extension, my) life I would turf them.|`|9b5935684568a7cb72fa426091885e25aa	i would ask them to stop failure to which id leave them like yesterday it is an expensive and sad decision to decide to stay with such a person|`|vEiaoR3Saa	Prolly.|`|PncjG3dSaa	Nothing can  get in the way of "True Love" <br>  <br>  if it's really "True Love" you will accept there choices and life styles.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	No, I would dump them. If you are with him when cops bust down his door for drugs. They find some you are going down too.|`|H24DtUKOaa	Yes. I love my girlfriend unconditionally. As long as she didn't do anything else.. like for example whore herself out to get drug money or if my partner killed/GBH'ed anyone|`|o17D9AXBaa	help them stop doing drugs tell them how much it affects you|`|YaC0mpXPaa	You know, if you love someone then you love them. They are going to be who they are and do what they like to do regardless of if you are in their life or not. If you respect him, and really are in love, then you can talk to him about why it bothers you, but in the end its nothing to break up over. Unless its affecting your life in a negitive way or hurting you.|`|cIwWng48aa	Nope. I mean, my mom was in that same situation... and I still love her... she's my mom... but your situation is different. I could NEVER be with someone like that! what if he got busted when you were together? you'd be in trouble, too.<br>  <br>  It's not worth it. You CAN find a guy better than that!!|`|0f3d5635f916732a3a43b98496988bcfaa	Personally I would not because its dangerous and also I could not stand seeing the person I love hurt themselves..|`|g8DqsThiaa	I would but no matter what I would never give up on trying to help him get better. Also,I would earn a lot of money so he wouldn't find the need to sell drugs for money.|`|GhmGtG3Gaa	I would still be with them; being with them no matter what, would mean more in a long run!!<br>  If you truely love them you'll love them with their flaws and all!!!|`|O9GB45Tmaa	I don't think I could handle being around them. I would pobably give them an ultimatum.|`|EFS3VK3waa	If they loved you back they'd stop.  Only if you're more important then the drugs. That's what my boyfriend did.|`|mePNindCaa	Yes, if he/she is a good person. One action does not define a person, it takes many.|`|tZkHHy5jaa	Only if you're willing to go to jail, get robbed, or killed with them.
V6MdE2mDaa	It ranged from guy to guy.<br>  <br>  For me, i look for personality. Many people could argue that. <br>  <br>  But MANY guys look for physical properties. if you know what i mean
GFiKQIGpaa	Its because your gay|`|dFNaSqBUaa	You like this guy but since you guys only know each other from chatting you feel like it is not real. That all he says can be BS. U might say that you trust him at some level, and that he is the one you might run to talk to when you have a problem or feel down...however think about this...would you really go to him? Is he really your best friend?<br>  <br>  If he is then why doen't you hang out in person more?<br>  Why doen't you guys spent more time if you guys feel that you have a strong friendhsip relationship?<br>  <br>  After getting to know eachother  in person then you might your fears dissappear and trust the guy completly.<br>  <br>  If you fee afraid to be alone with him, then i guess go out in public places, the movies may be? a cofee shop? or if you want to be a little relax maybe a bar, but DO NOT drink more thna you should.|`|P6ZFgmq4aa	I'm a guy by the way. It depends really. If you're willing for a relationship like couples, then go ahead and meet up. Just make sure it's in a safe place like a restaurant with lots of people. If you like him(after meeting up), why not? Living life with sex at the right age is not wrong.|`|Lt03NhXPaa	so go meet him and tell him how you feel and you want to be more than friends i would if i were with you and just be careful..|`|vU2UAU96aa	Nah.<br>  cause he could say different thing when you are willing to see him.<br>  there's no guarantee that he wouldnt hurt you..<br>  as he is 49 y.o now, he knows alot more than you
lIpjuMTHaa	He wont leave. And you should no better having been married yourself. Shame on you, his poor wife, I dont care what he tells you about her... it most likely isnt true. Men who would have feelings for someone else while they are married lie about things. Stay away from him and find your own single man.|`|ev33OxJbaa	You are stupid. He is a married man. Feelings come and go.  He will not leave his wife for you and if he does, later he will leave you.  He is unstable, loose him dummy.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	What YOU want and what happens is two different things.  First you know its wrong to be a partner in cheating.  And if he's cheating on his wife with you, he will cheat on you too.  Of course YOU are still married too - and not divorced.   So you are cheating on your husband too. <br>  <br>  Nice to be breaking up two families!|`|gSBco9oaaa	When he gives you the keys to his house, one he no longer shares with his wife, and you are free to come visit at will...<br>  <br>  When he takes you with him to the divorce attorney to discuss proceedings...<br>  <br>  When he has the divorce decree in hand....<br>  <br>  then, give him your phone number and tell him to call at will.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, give him the phone number of a marriage counselor so he is no longer 'unhappily' married.<br>  <br>  Until one of these situations comes about, save yourself a lot of heartache and stay away.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	you will be waiting a long time. married men never leave there wifes. His wife has a head start on you, since she married him and they have a home and a joint checking account. After he bangs you he goes home to her and bangs his wife and tells her how much he loves her. he is double dipping. Dont believe a word of it, he might love you but i guraentee he loves her more and is just telling oyu he is unhappy so you will keep giving him sex.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	and when he does come to you, wait 2 years and he'll be unhappily married man again.<br>  he wont' bother.   he'll never leave his wife for you.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Listen to yourself. You are married and so is he. Just because you say separated doesn't mean you are not married. Both of you should finish one relationship before beginning another. That is probably part of the problem of why you are both unhappily married. You both need to close the book on your current relationships and then see where it goes. He should not leave his wife for you. He should do what feels right to him. Maybe your relationship will not be as exciting if you are both with each other all the time. Nothing like a mistress acting like a wife to cool the jets.|`|rawz0RJuaa	he obviously loved that woman enough to marry her and she obviously loves/loved him. <br>  what makes you think you even have the right to break up a marriage?<br>  all cheating men will say their marriage is unhappy! he wants some a*s.<br>  he will just leave you high and dry just like he is doing the woman he loved enough to pledge his life to!!<br>  why do you think you are so special?<br>  dont be another "other woman"<br>  disgusting<br>  you will always be second best to him. he will always see you as an easy whore if you do that! he will take advantage of you and use you.<br>  he will never truly love you. wake up|`|cDjWONryaa	Unhappily married then he is a WOOSIE!! And should go and tell his wife the truth and you should not condone the behaviour either.  You are going to be the ultimate home wrecker regardless of what he says and how he says their life is. <br>  <br>  And sweetie they all say they are mierable and if he has loved you for a long time he wouldn't still be with his wife.|`|JuqxbJ3Daa	At least that's what he's telling you, that he's unhappy. What a load of BS. If he was serious about you he would have left her long time ago. Sounds like theirs a bc in this picture. Your his fall back crutch.|`|AA11605393	DO NOT BE A HOME WRECKER. RUN FOR HE HILLS BECAUSE YOU ARE BOTH MARRIED!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE! HAVE SOME D*MN MORALS AND SELF RESPECT!!!!<br>  <br>  BOTH OF YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED. HOW DISGUSTING!|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	Five years later, you feel just as miserable as you make his wife feel right now.|`|PY160XO7aa	Leave he is MARRIED.....until that changes...|`|QJslTCUBaa	Jump off a cliff.|`|HRegfSrEaa	It sounds like you really want a geniune answer, not some BS. So I would say, if you both really do respect each other do not do anything together. Allow him the space he needs to take care of things with his wife before he moves on. If he really wants to leave her, let him do that before you become involved. You do not want to be the one that is pictured as taking him away. If I were you I would not push anything and let him do what he needs to do. If he doesnt leave her then I guess he was full of hot air. If he does, then take it slow, too fast and everyone will think he left her because he was already with you. As a married woman, I would be pissed if my husband dis-respected me by being with someone new too quickly. I would also be pissed if I found she knew we were married and proceeded to have a physical relationship...that is completely wrong to know a man is married but still be with him. If you love him you can wait for him....|`|B7kPUmUWaa	Then why hasn't he left her? If he's really that unhappy, what's stopping him? And I truly believe in karma, and putting yourself in the position to break up a marriage will come back to haunt you. If he will do it with you, he will do it to you! When they said their vows, your name was no where in there, I'm sure of it! 'Til death do us part! Not some little home wrecker who can't find her own man!|`|AA11946390	He said he loves you. Now it's time for him to SHOW that he loves you. How many excuses has he given you for not leaving his wife yet? How great could he be if he leaves a woman he vowed to be with for you? I think you both have issues, personally.|`|y4w6ybr3aa	He most likely wont leave his wife, even if he says he will.<br>  wake up, if he does it to her he will probably do it to you too.<br>  Do they have children?|`|jXD8eBFgaa	How simple are you?Of course he is unhappily married because he never felt loved enough by his mom .Save yourself grap a single mate .|`|Cztv8y3Yaa	I don't think you can do anything.<br>  <br>  He has to do something if he really wants to be with you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AA11624887	There is a reason he is still there.... Not mess with him.  Let him take care of business before you even consider it.  As long as you guys are married, your still married.  DON"T DO IT...|`|yI7SIzA7aa	Sorry, but you are delusional! He will NEVER leave his wife.|`|AA11356977	I will never understand that, you will be with a cheater. You will NEVER trust him.|`|sU60NqWWaa	No one likes a cheater.  And I'm with KJ Jr. he'll be unhappy with you as well.|`|wia9SXCPaa	Wow, you won't get any support from me.|`|1ff2f7b473459573b0954ac559bf34c1aa	put your thong in his glove compartment.

When you find someone you do want to be intimate with [because you love them and he loves you of course] he will respect you and understand to not be rough and be gentle with you.|`|grPckwSsaa	it is uncomfortable<br>  <br>  sometimes it does hurt for some, but if you go slow, you will be ok|`|XnNT4l0Xaa	depends.|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	Not as much as you think it will.

Pain or discomfort during the first time a woman has vaginal sex have three common reasons: the inexperience or lack of attentiveness of her partner, the fact that she may be too young and her body isn't ready, and the stretching open of her hymen.<br>  <br>  Many women are afraid of the pain that they worry they will have when their hymen is stretched open during the first time they have vaginal intercourse with a man. The hymen is a thin membrane that stretches across a woman's vaginal opening. Menstrual fluids pass through an opening in the hymen during a woman's period. However, many women are born without a hymen, some have very little hymenal tissue, and the hymens of others are stretched open during sports or other activities, such as horseback and bicycle riding. All of these factors influence whether or not initial vaginal intercourse is painful or uncomfortable for a woman.<br>  <br>  Women who have hymenal tissue obstructing the opening to the vagina can prepare for their first intercourse by slowly stretching the hymen open with a clean finger. In rare cases, women who have very thick hymens may need to seek medical assistance to remove the obstruction.<br>  <br>  Another common cause of pain or discomfort during vaginal intercourse — whether or not it's the first time — has to do with the amount of time the couple spends in foreplay (sexual activity before penile-vaginal sex). As a woman becomes sexually aroused, more blood flows into her genitals (this is also true for men). For a woman, this increased blood flow allows her vaginal canal to lengthen and widen. It also stimulates the production of vaginal lubrication. All these changes allow insertive sex to be more comfortable. Unfortunately, many women have vaginal intercourse before their bodies are fully aroused because their partners aren't paying attention, don't know what they're doing, or are in too much of a hurry.<br>  <br>  Men tend to become sexually aroused more quickly than women. So, often they insert the penis before a woman's body has had time to become fully aroused. If the guy is aware of the difference in arousal speed, then he may be more willing to take his time during foreplay. This lets the vagina become sufficiently lubricated and for the woman's body to become ready for vaginal intercourse. Unfortunately, when people are first having sex, they tend to be impatient, clumsy, and self-conscious — which is why people's first experiences aren't always the greatest.<br>  <br>  The most important key is communication. Let your partner know what is comfortable and what is not comfortable. Encourage him to take his time. Let him know that women need a longer period of stimulation than men to become fully aroused. If partners take their time, are attentive to one another's pleasure, and they communicate, there can be very little discomfort and sex can be very pleasant — even the first time.<br>  <br>  For young women whose bodies are not ready, however, no amount of communication or foreplay will make vaginal intercourse comfortable or fun, which is another reason why so many girls wait until they're older.<br>  <br>  Hope this information helps!<br>  <br>  Take care,|`|AA11635143	Yes, but in a way you have not considered.  You are only 16 which makes you a minor.  He is about 19 which makes him an adult. The painful part is that you could be responsible for him spending time in jail and the rest of his life as a Registered Sex Offender.  That's a heavy price to pay for a 10-second thrill.<br>  <br>  You said you have only been dating this guy for about a month, that's a verrryy short period of time|`|ifC1aFHxaa	If your hymen is still intact then, yes you can expect some pain. If you have never used a tampon or otherwise ruptured your hymen then it is probably still intact.<br>  The other source of pain is lack of lubrication - dry skin rubbing inside you might not feel so great. That can easily be fixed.<br>  Are you ready for this? Make good choices for yourself.|`|Zb7H4B3Xaa	It's uncomfortable.  I remember it as an aching feeling that spread up to my stomach.  It lasted a couple of minutes.  Once I was adjusted, it was fine.  It wasn't mind blowing.  The next couple of days sucked because I was sore.  <br>  <br>  I do have to admit that I wish I had waited until I was married.  Sex is an extremely personal act.|`|4l2q4n1Baa	For girls its different for every one. <br>  <br>  BUT don't be scared.  When you do it your first time you should be so horny that you don't even care.<br>  <br>  And for most girls its just a bit uncomfortable.  Afterwards you get used to it and it will feel incredible =)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wo8B7hnOaa	not unless you are really tense.  just relax and it will be fine, it also depends if the guy is gentle with you or not.  just make sure to do it safe unless you want to get pregnant.  clean up afterwards if no condom|`|adw9SwPoaa	no|`|e066cae0dfb6845e9acc6db2160cffa0aa	hell yea|`|g8DqsThiaa	Depends on who you're doing and how uhm "big" they are. If they're toobig, it'll hurt a little.|`|8bHGjADEaa	It depends on who your having sex with, but most of the time yes it does,|`|9a9wlvqsaa	it depends.|`|GFiKQIGpaa	Not if your the dude and if your asking your too young to know|`|l2iqJbZKaa	Haven't actually done it.|`|bmi4Xlbfaa	YES. It hurts like a b*tch.|`|qZKLDFuWaa	i have sex everyday and im used the pain by now|`|IjkJVJNCaa	if you relax, then no it wont.|`|7awb0wgWaa	Oh... well no<br>  the sex is just too good u dont feel the pain|`|mIS1cB2Eaa	Mine didn't...cause I broke my hymen myself...|`|cEIpOQAKaa	Alot of people says it usually hurts their first time.|`|vaclgwS3aa	Don't forget to use protection and yes it hurts but if you're gentle you should be ok. Go slow.|`|BVyZfC04aa	For me it was okay. A bit tight, but good. Felt sore the next day though. It gets better though so don't be scared off it.|`|PVb3iiaAaa	ive heard its supposed to but idk...|`|CLdM1OsLaa	Nope. <br>  Not really.|`|1S11bh3eaa	depends, but mine didn't|`|sC2WFC81aa	It depends on the guy rofl.<br>  But yes, it does|`|mePNindCaa	Yes, but you should talk to your parents.|`|QHf2Ov6yaa	i guess it just depends on how big the guy is and how big or small you are. i hate to get all detailed on you, but from my experience (and my friends experience back when we were in HS) the part that hurt the worst was when the head went in, after that it wasn't so bad. If you're about to have sex for the first time, might i suggest (using a condom of course) but other than that, use some lube, it might not hurt so much that way.|`|hn2wDu92aa	honestly yes it depends in the lubrication and the size of the penis how much though. normally it does i kno when i lost my virginity it hurt a lot i almost cried but after the 2nd or 3rd time it feels better just make sure you protect yourself and use protection. make sure lsoing your virginity is something ur ready to give up before u do it. make sure you do it with somebody you care about ior even love. good luck :-)|`|p9Ku6RKOaa	It depends on a few things.<br>  <br>  1.) Penis size. If its tiny, then most likely it will not hurt. If its it big, then yes. something big going into something tight isn't comfortable the first time.<br>  <br>  2.) If the movements are bad, then it won't feel good...and that goes for every time you have sex.|`|vGhhoQQkaa	Be gentle and use plenty of lubrication.  e.g K1 Jelly or an approved vaginal lubricant and most of all RELAX if your stressed or nervous your muscles tighten and make it hard for anything to enter that area<br>  <br>  Have fun and play safe|`|g1OoQPraaa	if you are not married, don't do it!  It hurts, mentally, emotionally, psychologically, physically - there are diseases you can get.  stay pure, you will be sooooo much better off!|`|R3cpPH9aaa	It hurts, but only first time. Not too much,still you can enjoy. Don think of temporary pain it gives first time. Think of pleasure in it.|`|0pAczRv2aa	i asked the same question one timee<br>  <br>  some of my best guy friends said it hurts the girl extremely <br>  unless "your loose" haha<br>  <br>  well i think it would. don't you think so <br>  ?<br>  i guess it also depends how big it is...|`|P3LwYllFaa	oui ma copine.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090219162414AAnA6Ww&cp=6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  <br>  please answer!|`|5ZwuIVPdaa	apparently ur first time it does, maybe u can use fingers to start loosening it up though cus im not sure....still a virgin and will remain one tell 18 and probly tell marriage|`|Ekzym4kYaa	some girls it does<br>  becareful because you might bleed <br>  that is the reason i don't like virgins lol no offense|`|Lt03NhXPaa	yes it does but it is like a good hurt feeling i think and if they take it slow and gentle its not bad at all|`|v6UQhGtHaa	NO IT FEELS SO GOOD.

It's not too painful and it stops hurting after a couple of times.<br>  Helps if the guy's gentle, too :)|`|jAQVFrvOaa	It depends on you and the person. Meaning how well you take pain and the size he is. It hurts a little in the beginning but the pain doesnt stay long.|`|iGxEExUhaa	Yes it will hurt. Scientifically speaking your penis will be bruised be if the female entrance is niot that tight it will not hurt as much.<br>  Email me back and tell me what was the outcome.|`|7ObD9tNbaa	depends on how sensitive you are, and if your too tight or loose, please use protection, its in your best interest!|`|T5S7gnUlaa	dont know but this girl i was with last week was screaming and when i jammed my **** up in that tight well you get the story

Give her credit for trying.|`|G64z6K1naa	I feel like this with my dad, lets just say he didn't treat me or my family with respect when my parents were together, and now i'm getting older he suddenly wants to know me when he didn't want me born. It hard to forgive and forget so simply DON'T! i haven't forgiven my dad but to be honest i'm obviously the better person because even though i can't forgive him i can still get on with my life and talk to him etc . . . I think if i was you i would except what she wants to do for you and let her "give a crap" about you because in the end YOUR the better person!<br>  <br>  *Good Luck*|`|AA11377112	I take it you are talking about your mother...<br>  <br>  Well... For one, she probably always has cared about you. Be surprised at how much. And when you turned 16, she probably decided to lighten up a bit and maybe give you a little bit of leeway on things. <br>  <br>  That's what my mother would probably say... Oh well... I ain't her...<br>  <br>  Honestly... though, she probably has cared and has done only what she has known to do. I do the same thing with my little brother. And I'm 20 and I help raise him like how I was raised. And I don't mean to, but it happens. I personally do think you ought to at least embrace it... Don't have to forgive yet, but also, make an effort to try and keep things good between you two. You might need her help on something one day. You never know.|`|67q4ElJtaa	Are you talking about your mother? You left a word out so I'll assume its your mom you're talking about. It's a tough situation you seem to be in, but regardless, we still need to keep Bible principles ahead of you. Jesus was obedient to his heavenly Father. But even on earth, as a perfect person, he was obedient to his imperfect parents.
1ac39fcfa274ce08e7a2111bc679183aaa	Ah yea, he should have been the first person you spoke with. I think it is great that you have taken the time to calm down. She knows that you have seen her, so now she is just waiting for you  to make the first move.  Approach her with love and understanding, you may not like it that she has chosen to  me with another girl, but there is really not much you can do about her choice. <br>  <br>  <br>  OH YOU ARE SO RIGHT SHE IS A TROLL.<br>  <br>    YOUR NAME FITS YOU WELL. GET SOME HELP  SOON.<br>  <br>  YOU ARE A DANGEROUES PERSON.<br>  <br>  IT WAS MOST LIKELY YOU THAT YOUR MOTHER FOUND YOU WITH ANOTHER GIRL HAVING ORAL SEX.<br>  <br>  LUNATIC<br>  <br>  It is ok to let her know that you (do) or (do not )agree with her choice, but you will  be there for you and that you love her.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	You have to stop and think back to when your were her age and the raging hormones that was messing with your head.  She is just being a kid and doing things that most kids do.  I think you should take her in the bedroom and sit her down and talk to her as an adult.  Tell her that missing school is bad, then discuss the sex issues.  Good luck.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I don't think telling your husband is a good idea. That would embarass your child way to much. Instead , since you are her mother, you should sit down with her and talk to her. Maybe even have the other girl there speaking to her as well. Or go to that childs parents and speak to them also. I wouldn't scold her, because this is something that you need to speak to her about and educate her.  I would be extremely upset at her for not being in school like she was supposed to be.|`|m8UEGUaGaa	So you married the 74 year old man you were so disgusted to be pregnant by AND now this? I imagine you would be disturbed.<br>  <br>  Oh, about the girls just talk to your daughter about "not skipping" school and the importance of education. Sexual exploration and curiosity is normal and natural. So advise about safe sex, STD's & if they are in fact gay or bisexual and other adolescent changes they may be experiencing. Tell the other girls mother right away.|`|cdQryr7paa	Well, I know what I wouldn't do.<br>  I wouldn't go on Yahoo Answers and tell the whole world.<br>  The girl definately has some issues she needs to talk to someone about, and if you are her mother, you should be the one to help her.<br>  I have my doubts about whether this post is true or not, but you are going to have a rough road ahead of you if you don't show your daughter you care and you want to help her.|`|lN5d688gaa	talk to your husband.  both of you need to sit down and have a long talk with your daughter.|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	tell hubby but talk to her one on one|`|AA12262106	Whether your husband knows about it or not isn't the primary issue here. The problem has to be addressed with your daughter and as a parent you are as qualified as your husband to deal with it. <br>     Your daughter is obviously at a stage in her life where she's curious about sex. Moreover, it seems like she feels that she's ready to experiment.<br>     Your intervention at this point should focus on making sure that she has enough information to make wise decisions. It is time to establish open and honest dialogue concerning sex, with the focus being on her protecting herself.|`|rawz0RJuaa	wow! this is probably the most interesting question i have ever seen on here haha.<br>  well i would talk to her before you say anything to your husband.<br>  you really need to talk it out.<br>  also, ask your school to call you if your daughter is ever absent to make sure she does not skip. next time she could skip and be afraid to skip at your house and something bad could happen to her and you wouldnt even know!<br>  after you talk to her, then decide whether to tell your husband or not.<br>  i can imagine that is not the kind of thing a father would want to hear about his little girl..... it may put a strain on their relationship and make it awkward between them in the daughters eyes<br>  i would definitely call the other girls mother as well and tell her everything|`|0ulKsvXlaa	No, you should not tell him<br>  You should not speak about this to anyone, not even your sister.<br>  It will only escallate a delicate situation.<br>  <br>  The only problem is the shock it caused you.<br>  Your little girl is no longer so, and wow, with another girl as well.<br>  I bet you were speechless !<br>  <br>  Were they tasting liqueurs ? (Joking but please read on)<br>  <br>  OK seriously, She is 13 and just testing the water.<br>  I also had a similar innocent relationship with a boy when I was about that age. I am NOT homsexual, but at the time one does not think about homo or hetro sexuality, it has no real meaning.<br>  I know of MANY boys and girls that had done similar things.<br>  They all developed into normal adults, just as I did.<br>  All be it, a little more open minded.<br>  <br>  They are examining their own sexuality in a very innocent way.<br>  I doubt that she is Lesbian, she has not yet had any experiences with boys, so she has nothing to compare.<br>  At the very worst she may develop bisexual tendencies, <br>  but I doubt this, based on what others have told me.<br>   <br>  When she starts dating boys, she'll more than likely develop the same hunger for what men have between their legs, as other girls, that did not do, what you saw her doing.<br>  <br>  Just accept this as a child learning about her new found sexuality.<br>  I would speak to her and tell her that you are not angry.<br>  Say that you believe it is only experimentation on her part.<br>  And that this is normal.<br>  <br>  You should now be talking to her about sex.<br>  Not all at once, little by little.<br>  Don't be ashamed about the subject, it is as normal as eating.<br>  Your girl is a young woman now, treat her as such.<br>  Talk to her as you would a real friend, so she feels she can trust you.<br>  Now is the most important time for that.<br>  <br>  Should you achieve this now, you will have this friendship and trust forever. And you will avoid the problematic teen-age / parent breakdown of communication.<br>  <br>  Bye the way, have you never wondered about girls, or been attracted to any ? Not even once, even when you were younger ?|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	Yes i would tell my husband and discuss actions with him. Now is probally a good time to have the sex talk with your child. I think more or less they were experimenting as a lot of young girls do, dont take it out of content. Ask her what was going on. be more upset that she cut school.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	read her other questions she's a troll and not a very smart one at that...nice try troll don't you have homework?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AshzwNV32mgcsSYQyMl_vozsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090217171625AAf7Lpe">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aiw_NkPIcw46I_9SKhDtveDty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090218120415AAqKlAt">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiAFvybI.YokOmiP1lDScnvty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20060625134128AAa0vPi">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|7eaf5c689c77b9c042b4be96ab16b8abaa	Yes, no secrets.  Your heartbreak should be his.  It is a problem for the whole family.  Cutting school is bad.  Sex at that age isn't good, but when did you start experimenting?  Sounds like a lot more parenting needs to happen - and two parents are better than one!|`|TUNvbXbgaa	you need to tell your husband but you need to talk to her along one on one.  and you need to love her for who she is and not make her feel guilty for being gay if she is..|`|sGP6s7uraa	Oh, .... wow.  Um... I would tell my husband but I, personally, would talk with her one on one.|`|WDS2DASnaa	i think you should mention it to your husband but make sure to keep him calm. no matter with whom, your daughter is way too young to be having sex. and she missed school. so you should definitely talk to her about it and let her tell you how she feels about this girl. also stress that school is really important and it's against the rules to miss it. <br>  <br>  maybe try not to make apparent your feelings about her having sex specifically with a girl, just about her having sex in general.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	I think you should talk to your daughter before you tell your husband. She is probably really embarrassed and your husband will only make her more uncomfortable. I would just drop the skipping school part and focus on her having sex with another girl. Did you know that she had feelings for girls? Once she gets past the initial embarrassment, she will probably be relieved to tell you how she really feels about girls.|`|goY0JHzlaa	Once you calm down, go talk with her and ask her why she wasn't at school. Take care of that one first. Next, the sex thing. You have to remember, she's a kid, and maybe she's attracted to girls. You may not approve of this, but, she's still your child and you love her. You want her to be able to come to you when she needs to. And, this may not be easy for her to tell you about her sexual orientation. Love her reguardless. <br>  <br>  I truly believe that being attracted to the same sex has a biological component. I don't think a person can help that. You do not have to approve, but, you should try to understand and let her know you love her. Good luck.|`|B7kPUmUWaa	Absolutely tell your husband! I think you should give yourself some time to calm down, and then have a calm, collected talk with your daughter. Screaming and hollering won't accomplish anything. I'm sure you are shocked beyond belief. But you have to get to the bottom of why your daughter is doing this. And being an adult about it will help her open up to you and understand the message you want to convey to her.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	don't act like it's the end of the world.  She's experimenting.  You do need to talk to her and tell her she's too young for sex with either sex and that skipping school was wrong as well.  She needs to understand that sex is natural and all that, but she needs to wait a while and always stay in school.|`|qhM7G38xaa	Hmmm. I would not tell your husband BUT, I would really talk to her. I would let her know this is not acceptable behavior. I would let her know if this does happen again, that you will tell her husband about the future inceddent and the current one. I personally would spank her as well, but I am old school|`|KmC0K59taa	Treat it the same as if it were a boy she was having oral sex with.  She's too young for any kind of sex.  She needs a good talking to and talk to this girl's mother as well.  Yes, tell your husband.  He deserves to know about it.|`|H24DtUKOaa	You should sit down with your daughter and talk about her sexuality, recommend some websites and TALK TO YOUR HUSBAND. If you don't, he'll feel left out and very annoyed. But make sure your daughter knows being lesbian is okay... Although bunking school really isn't!|`|Smv1pNk7aa	Yes, you should definitely tell your husband. All 3 (you, your daughter, your husband) of you should sit down and talk this over. It is up to you and him to give her your thoughts on her actions.|`|GhmGtG3Gaa	WOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!<br>  I think that it should be just between you and your daughter!!!<br>  If she's gay or by it shouldn't matter, but i mean i wouldn't tell him what happen but i'll inform him that is she experimenting!|`|bqkfu6Diaa	You should lecture them both about the dangers of teenage pregnancy. Or maybe just stress the importance of attending school, and not worry about the sex thing.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Calm down first.<br>  <br>  Talk to your daughter second.<br>  <br>  Speak with your husband once you have the full scoop.  <br>  <br>  It may take a few days for everything to settle...dont' give up!|`|5EOLbVzQaa	the girl would be kicked out and my daughter severely punished.|`|ZVqEDvZSaa	wow..so your daughter is a lesbian? sit her down and talk to her about this..tell your husband for sure.|`|8QCOSlNvaa	wow i would tell your husband.|`|qUocgI1aaa	First and fore most a thirteen year old should not be having sexual contact with anyone of any gender. I would talk to your child and the other girl together with the parents. Also there should be some sort of punishment for skipping school. Your husband should be involved. Never talk to your children when you are mad, you will close the doors of communication and she will feel she can not come to you and talk to you about her feelings. Once you have no communication with your child you loose all control with them.

It was pretty amazing considering I thought that stuff only happened in the movies. Everything has to be just right.

y6uKv9GOaa	yeah,all the time! Some were purely platonic (it's even something that makes me feel so special),but some were,well you know..<br>  <br>  it never bothered me,because mostly we're all started out as friends (and never went any further than that) and they know i appreciate *guys,cough* too much that they had no actual chance.<br>  <br>  As for the platonic 'friends',most of the thing they did were so selfless,done in act to see the one they love to be happy-even when it's not including them.Well,lesbian friends are women,too,so their wooing tactic is so well-thought and understanding to the other woman. <br>  <br>  I appreciate it,in fact,sometimes it makes me feel more special than most men can make.|`|A3L0HiNtaa	Yes, and yes.<br>  I have no problem with gay women,<br>  but they cross a line when they start to hit on me...|`|hBDwpwvKaa	yes, it was just uncomfortable|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Yes, lots of gay and bi woman have hit on me.

It use to really piss me off because I don't swing that way. I felt like if she was hitting on me, she should have thought about whether I was like her before doing it(especially in front of other people). It is really rude and disgusting for a person of the same sex to just assume that everybody is like them and that they can just hit on whomever they want.|`|5737f0111f183aa3e07767b0362ccc9caa	Yes.  I was very disappointed because I thought we were doing things together because of mutual interests.  I don't think it bothers me in the same way that being hit on by a gay bothers you.  I haven't felt physically endangered when these things happen.  The women who've hit on me responded to my turndown the same way some men have:  "Well, you just aren't much of a woman."|`|JV6NFr5Raa	i've had older lesbians hit on me sometimes (im a friendly person and smile a lot so i think most people get the idea that im flirting with them) but it doesnt really bother me that they are girls, it just makes me uncomfortable that ANYONE is paying attention to me without me asking. im straight but im completely okay with lesbians and gays.|`|ZoajuFv1aa	Hahah. great question. <br>  Well, I was at a rave and this chick in a bunny suit sat on me and began giving me a full body massage.

It didnt bother me at all. I took it as a compliment.<br>  Its the same as if a guy were to hit on me that Im not interested in. I simple let them down easy. Its not a big deal. They like what they like and I like what I like. How are they supposed to know unless they try? Just bc they are gay doesnt mean they dont have the right to try to pick someone up. They just dont know if you are gay or straight. Its not like we all have glowing signs over our heads saying our preference.....  that would be cool though|`|2IK3PvAEaa	I was approached by a woman while at a club with a friend.

She's a nice girl.<br>  <br>  I think sometimes we are really just looking for someone to communicate with.<br>  <br>  Bottom line...didn't offend me at all.|`|8l4y6gxlaa	NO!!!!! EWWWWW!!!!! Yuck that would be disgusting!|`|jsgKGtdBaa	im 16 - i havent been disturbed yet|`|a8Pq2Lmdaa	Yes and yes it bothered me because she knew that I am straight.  If she did not know, then it would not have offended me.  Her theory was every women was gay or bi, but some would not admit it to themselves.  She even would say that she would try to "convert" women to her side. Her words, not mine|`|eQVvnq7Haa	haha, yes. I usually hate when girls try to hit on me, i wanna fukking punch them in their mouth, but when i need summin i let it slide. Like on 420, i needed some spinach and i let it slide, so i can keeeep smkin|`|7awb0wgWaa	YEah... like today in a bra shop. i went into the change room with a bra and the shop assistant came in with me. I thouhgt.. i dunno.. that its the normal process, but she kissed me and i freaked out and ran out|`|dYK1KPp4aa	No. I mean, my appearance is a little misleading to some since I'm into alternative fashion, I kind of figure it's my fault. (Kind of like when a woman wears skanky clothes to a bar. She should EXPECT it.)|`|VFdC2wPlaa	It's happened to me a couple of times. It was very uncomfortable, and i wasn't really sure how to take it. I don't like it... and it does bother me.|`|2uZivThaaa	Yes! I have been hit on before by lesbians. I always take it as a complement! They were not vulgar in anyway, they are a lot more polite than men are!|`|b4WxO5fxaa	IDK IM 2STRIAGHT TO TELL<br>  AND IF I EVR DID ILL KICK HER *** STRIAGHT....IM NOT AGAINST GAYS OR NOTHING LIKE THAT....BUT I DON'T WALK THAT LINE...EW|`|GFiKQIGpaa	all the time but im a dude|`|KcK8W40faa	honestly yes it does.. im not oposed to same sex relationships but its creepy when another woman winks suggestivly at me or is too forward. i'd much rather have it be a man who does that ya know...|`|N9DFO2lZaa	Yes, I have been hit on by women. I think the atmosphere has to do with whether it is offensive or not. I used to work at a concert venue in Dallas. There would be artists who drew lesbian crowds. Many times women ask me out and I just laughed it off and told them I am straight. I felt that even though I worked there I had put myself into the situation. However, when I am walking through a mall I do not like women or men for that matter to hit on me. That is my time and I am not looking to be disturbed by someone with nothing better to do than bug me. I am not against them either but I am straight, lol.|`|wXVzZGWQaa	didn't bother me at all<br>  i just went along with it|`|FgdJpfiVaa	yes........but you just shrugg it offfff.<br>  does it bother you...|`|AA10639030	It depends<br>  <br>  1. I'll take a compliment from a woman because that means that I look sexy to both sexes....<br>  <br>  2. As long as she gets the hint I don't swing that way it doesn't bother me..<br>  <br>  It actually makes me feel good to know that women like checking me out....makes a woman feel real sexy and hot...<br>  <br>  Just take it for the compliment it is unless they take it way 2 far.....|`|d057d4b205afdf38f32252a846ee418baa	yes and no|`|iGxEExUhaa	Damn it affects me. I love men and the lesbians hit on you hard and will even want to touch you. I think thats offensive. The lesbians know where a woman wants to be touched and if you dont back them off immediately theres gonna be problems. They will think you agree and come on stronger.|`|IjkJVJNCaa	never been hit on by a women but if i did i would hate it, just like a straight guy would hate a gay guy trying it on with them|`|I3jYOT9haa	I've been hit on a lot by girls. It doesn't exactly bother me, but it makes me a little uncomfortable.|`|d8uJaLXYaa	Yes they have.<br>  And it did sort of bother me; I wasn't offended as such. Just uncomfortable.|`|AA11634816	At first it made me uncomfortable. I just had to get the point across that I wasn't interested.|`|A6S5Tx2Oaa	Yes & Yes.  Very strange.  But I have gay associates and its cool to hang with them.

cLPimVR6aa	Thanks for serving our country. If your wife doing everything right than you should have trust in her judgment just 'cause someone wants to sleep with her it does not mean she would go ahead and do it. Also, if there was something going on she would not told you about that guy calling her.|`|rawz0RJuaa	being a USMC wife who has been through some long deployments- do not worry.<br>  you guys really will never understand how hard it is for us here at home while you are gone.<br>  she probably did it because she needed a little good feeling.<br>  i know that when my hus is away, i get joy out of other guys telling me im pretty, or trying to pursue me. like if you go out with the girls or something, you know how it is when girls go out. its the same thing. <br>  it is hard not having the one you love here to give you those small satisfactions. its nice to just feel wanted. i know you still want her from overseas, but we dont feel that. we have to attempt to live a normal life minus you. she is trying her hardest to make sure you are taken care of. it always feels like the girls give and give, and recieve very little when our guy is deployed. you boys will never understand what it is like for us just the same as we will never understand what it is like for you. you just have to trust her and love her the best you can.<br>  i am sure she probably feels guilty even talking to him but i can assure you, it is nothing to worry about! <br>  i have never cheated on my guy. not sexually or emotionally and never will! she is a tough girl and is obviously dedicated to you hardcore. <br>  give her a break.<br>  if she was doing something wrong- she would not tell you!!<br>  <br>  also, thank you for your service!!|`|AA11601031	She can't stop the guy from callling her.  Doesn't sound untrustworthy to me.  Now, as for the guy, you should write him an email and tell him that you heard he was going to pull this ****.  Tell him that if he contacts your wife again (is he in the military?), you're going to request leave to come home and kick his ***.  If he's in the military, you can also tell him that you're going to report him for attempted adultery.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	That is a little questionable that she talked to him, but maybe she was just trying to be nice and not be rude to him. Has she ever cheated before? If not, I would not be too hard on her, because if you act suspicious and jealous, she might end up doing something irrational. It sounds like she loves you and is very devoted, since she emails you so much and sends you care packages, even though she is busy with work, school, and your child. I'm sure it will all work out for the best|`|Smv1pNk7aa	If she told you that he called then she wants to be honest with you and probably doesn't want your friends spreading rumors. I would be more concerned about the guy especially if your wife goes to school and works. Also, she keeps in contact with you and sends you care packages. She is obviously spending her extra time thinking about you.|`|tZkHHy5jaa	Your insecurity is getting the best of you. If she is being honest with you and telling you everything the guy said, you shouldn't worry. If you react badly to her being open and honest with you, she will stop telling you whats going on at home when you're away. Just stay sweet.  She sounds too busy with work, school, and children to bother with anyone other than you.|`|hhRuKIzRaa	Seems to me that she is pretty attentive to you. Don't be suspicious of her for a phone call. And don't think that just because she is good looking that you should be more suspicious. Don't borrow trouble, she seems really into you and you should trust that and her...|`|lY2XI8kUaa	i dont think you need to worry, your wife told you about the guy calling, and she didnt call him. if she is going to school full time and working full time, while still taking care of a toddler then he probably doesnt have much time to do anything else.|`|yy45iAbtaa	if you trust your wife i would not worry about it.you might be insecure if it is hard for you to deal with.i am sure men are going to talk to her all the time.but it does not mean anything if she loves you she loves you.|`|70860a41a58f8d75a2a493037473b6fdaa	Salute. I understand your fears and they're justified. Jody pops up all too often. But I think you have nothing to worry about. I'd shoot the guy an e-mail that contains a polite but firm warning.|`|1U8f6m2Paa	If you two have a very trustworthy relationship, you have nothing to worry about. <br>  <br>  <br>  Thanks for all that you do!!!!!|`|6OXohC7qaa	Men are strange.<br>  She sounds perfect..<br>  Perfect women are capable of anything.<br>  All women are.|`|wfMC742Naa	She sounds like a good wife.  You should trust her.  It isn't her fault this guy called her.  Shouldn't you be mad at him instead of her?|`|aKkDWz5Waa	i think its fine, since she told u, nd didnt try to hide it.<br>  <br>  nd dude, dnt be too controlling over her. shes still young nd wants to live. as long as she doesnt cheat.|`|W0qFAIVuaa	When you come home find him and gut him like a fish. And thanks from all of us for doing what you do.|`|CLdM1OsLaa	It sounds like she is a good wife. <br>  I dint think you have anything to worry about really. <br>  <br>  BTW<br>  Your a lucky guy.|`|15Uz3lO2aa	She feels very alone without you. She'd rather have you there with her, hands down- she's your wife and from what you've said, I can tell she loves you and cares for you very much. When this guy called to "check in on her" it was probably comforting to her since she's alone without you. She probably wasn't talking to him because she's interested, or even thinking of him in that way, but just knowing that a friend nearby was making sure she was doing alright made her feel good. You need to tell her that he's attracted to her, and that that is the only reason why he contacted her, and that he's not looking to protect her or look out for her as a friend, but that he's into her and only looking to get close to her, and that you would really appreciate it if she didn't answer his calls, because he could get the wrong idea. She will understand if you explain, rather than demanding she ignore him. I'm sure she didn't mean to disrespect you, and if you let her know you feel that way, and at the same time don't make it her fault, then she will want to make you happy and prove she respects you by ignoring him.|`|AA10126193	Well, seems to me that HE might be a problem. I think that if she goes to school full time and works full time also and you have a 2 yrd, she doesn't have time to sit on the toilet correctly. NO offense! Well, apparently you trust her cause if you didn't, you wouldn't have left her to begin with. Maybe that was already in effect...if so, think like this, im a female and let me list reason y I wouldnt do it...<br>  1. ur an officer in the army = great pay, insurance, and retirement $$$<br>  2. have child together<br>  3. emails & packages<br>  4. into the marriage 3 yrs already<br>  <br>  I think maybe ur a little paranoid which should be expected but take the neccessary precautions......be honest with her and tell her what was said so that she know that you know. then i would contact friends via email (that u trust) preferably female and ask them to watch out for her. She is ver vunerable right now but all that is understandable cause u arent there to keep her safe, secure and happy. Make sure when u send emails to her that u keep romancing her...love poems, erotic notes, etc... make sure that you let her know that u appreciate the packages...tell her thank you for the littlest thing in the box. Tell her all the things you miss about her all the time. You know, if you have access to the internet..you can send her flowers. Be creative. Enlist the help of friends to do things...crazy things for her to keep her "interested" in JUST you. Oh and i know that this might be a little crazy but it might be the most important thing, but find a girlfriend of hers and tell her to go get ur wife a "toy". I'm sure you know what I mean....so, that pretty much takes care of everything. I hope this helps...Good Luck and God Bless!!|`|NuUdCz0Laa	First off Tony, I want to salute you and your willingness to serve our country.  Your wife loves you, she is an adult and can make decisions on her own and take care of herself.  I understand that your away from her and you have to much time on your hands to think about everything, but you have to trust and have faith in her.  So when those wondering questions come into your mind, stop and think about the first time you met her, the first kiss, the first time, all those pleasant thoughts will override the questions.  Good luck.|`|CM0C65dtaa	When would she have time to do anything with full time work, school and a toddler?   I would be disappointed that she is talking to him tho.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	You need to trust your wife. Being attractive, there would be some guys after her but as long as she loves you and cares for you, she is not going to cheat and be loyal to you.|`|AA10197672	If she truly loves you then she wont do anything with the guy. However she should stop every communication she has with the guy or any other guy for that matter...|`|lN5d688gaa	thank you for serving our country.  please trust your wife.  if you are too controlling she will start to hide things from you.  she is honest and telling you everything.  just love her and your child together.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|lGclixPuaa	Trust your wife. The guy who is attracted to her is a jerk.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	Your overactive imagination is getting the best of you. <br>  You TOLD her not to do something...you are her husband, not her father! You are a control freak and a jerk.<br>  <br>  Thank you for serving our country. She is a saint for putting up with you and doing all the wonderful things she does for you.<br>  Of course your friend called her, she's young and hot, and you are out of town. She was 20 when you married her, still a kid. You were 30, supposedly a mature man, but you let your hormones get the best of you, didn't you honey. Now you're paying the price for your own selfishness.|`|0ulKsvXlaa	So tell your friend to pass back a message to this guy, that he should beware of getting involved with your wife, 'cos you'd told him you would cut off the balls of ANYONE that tried anything on with your wife.<br>  <br>  He only needs to say that you can be a nasty piece of work if wound up.<br>  <br>  I would have someone keep an eye out for what is going on.<br>  I would also tell your wife not to even think about cheating.|`|gfHutvEFaa	she told you the guy called her. she didn't "hide" it. You told your wife she couldn't speak to other men? Jealous are we?<br>  <br>  If you can't handle men looking at or talking to your wife, you shouldn't have married some one good looking. Get over it. She is with you. Count your lucky starts that she told you, it means she is truthful.|`|UZBULUuraa	You know your wife better than anyone on this forum. This other guy does not sound like he has pure intentions. It depends on how strong your wife is because it sounds as if he is going to put the moves on her. People do things in moments of weakness that they would not do ordinarily. If I were you I would get one of my buddies that live near her to check on her and not someone who wants to sleep with her.|`|vyNlyfczaa	you need to chill! I know it's hard for both of you specially for you (my boyfriend - now husband just came from one year deployment) ... you need to trust her! If she writes emails, is sending you packages it shows that she care a lot! You need to relax, trust her and be careful and focus on your own safety!|`|5WtXOl51aa	that's lame<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what you'd be able to do in your situation but i hope nothing goes wrong<br>  <br>  best of luck to you.|`|AA10119874	If HE called her I wouldn't worry.  She is keeping her word.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	Sounds like she is truly devoted to you or she wouldn't be contacting you and sending you care packages. I am sure she was trying to be polite by taking the other guys call, no woman likes to be rude. I say just express your feelings and tell her you dont approve of her talking to him. You should feel fortunate that she does so much for you while your overseas.<br>  <br>  A lot of my husband military buddies go overseas and never hear from there wives until they get divorce papers. She sounds like a good lady. Dont make to much of nothing. <br>  <br>  On another note, thank you for fighting for our country. be safe and dont worry so much, just worry about doing a good job so you can come home safe to your loving wife.
AA12037013	Technically, I believe that there should be several accounts in a marriage. <br>  HIS savings<br>  Her savings<br>  their savings<br>  their checking<br>  <br>  Makes sense.<br>  <br>  Now on to your question. Leave the money from the insurance where it is. He isn't playing fair by putting everything in his name instead of both your names. <br>  <br>  Follow your heart, you won't mess up as often then.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	I agree totally with you. You should have just told him that the money went into a savings acct for your son for college, and left it that. There is no way your husband has any intentions of borrowing and replacing that money. He has a knack of trying to blame you for everything and to make you feel guilty for doing so, while he does no wrong. As much as I hate to say this but with what youve told us about his actions, I sense a disaster coming soon. Im not quite sure I understand why he even has you there by the way he treats you and puts everyone ahead of you. You jsut might need your money to leave when the point of enough is enough and I think that point is very near. He definitely is trying to push you away probably without realizing hes even doing that. Good luck|`|bSiNAsHJaa	girl dont do it. men are all about money, it seems like every year when i get more back on income tax or come into some extra money from something i worked he gets jealous and always tries to find something to be mad at me about so i can kiss his *** by buying him something new.  hes always argueing about money.  im so tired of it. i been with him for 12 years and it never gets better. and we have seperate accounts and he says why do i have my own account so i can hide money and i told him no but of course thats the reason cuz if i have to leave one day im not going to be broke. like i told him you can have all the material things i just want my kids and my car.|`|tcvQwTa5aa	Don't you dare!Don't be a fool!That's just his way of getting the money out of you.If it came from the sale of your car that you already owned before marrying him then the money is rightfully yours.It sounds like he may be a control freak and you're better off without him.If he's able to put the money back in a couple of month(like he says)then he's also able to wait those couple of months and buy his own truck.Don't let this man walk all over you!You are not a doormat unless you choose to be.Stand up for yourself.Why should you trust him if you honestly didn't stash the knife in the son's bag and he doesn't believe you,therefore,he doesn't trust you and thinks your a liar.Wake up.|`|tZkHHy5jaa	If you give him the money, it will not make you situation better. Don't do it out of FEAR either, instead lie and say you paid off student loans or something. You can't give what you don't have. Or, keep the money somewhere he can't get to it. Its rightfully your's! Best wishes!|`|yy45iAbtaa	don't do it leave it there for you and your son your a fool if you let him talk you into it.how is he going to pay you back.he can't even get his own truck and he is going to pay you back.follow your gut instincts.|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	It seems like he is a material guy.  He bought a van, when you two were married and put it in just his name?  Wow, stop the madness and go buy a car to replace the one that was wrecked with the money.|`|6jRexUYHaa	You sound like you dont trust him...maybe you should follow your feelings. Dont give him anything just because your married does not mean you cannot be independent as well. Do the right thing.|`|AA11356977	Wow lots of issues here. you can tell from your kids problems. If you dont trust your husband why are you with him????|`|b80Zhg6Uaa	That's a bunch of bull **it! You should use that money to replace the car you crashed... Not give it to him so he can get a new truck.  Stand your ground|`|JDiHhUeGaa	sounds like an *** hole to me.|`|836vtf9Saa	wow i dont want to read this...|`|1ac39fcfa274ce08e7a2111bc679183aaa	You sound like a smart woman. Go with your first feelings. why would a man take the side of his child without first setting down with the woman that he LOVES  and talk about it?<br>  <br>   Why does he did a new truck when you guys have a van? The van that he is selling why cant he take that money and buy him a  new truck? and if he will have the money to put back in the account in a few months then he can just buy a new truck in a few months when he gets the money!<br>  <br>  This fish has maggots|`|AA11624887	Don't do it.  Tell him, I do trust you and that isn't the issue here.  The issue is how I feel for myself.  I know that what we have is for us, but because I that money was from something in my past, I feel it needs to stay to the side right now....  Let him know that you are not comfortable that all the other family vehicles are in his name only, having this money makes you feel that you actually have something that can't be taken away.  It isn't about him, it is about how you feel inside, about you!!!!<br>  <br>  I don't know if that will be a good enough answer for him, but I sure would not give him the money.  He sounds controlling and could leave you high and dry.  Or, if he does talk you about of the money, make sure the truck goes in your name and your name only.... but, I still wouldn't do it.  I would actually open another account and start stashing money away that he knows nothing about.... something about all of this makes me think you need to protect yourself, and do it fast.|`|FncktQ4gaa	Don't give in to him if he really loves and trust you as he should in your marriage. He so realize that it belongs to you and if in due time you would like to share it with him you will. In the meantime just hold your grounds. If he really cares about you he will get over this.|`|JuqxbJ3Daa	Don't give him money to buy a truck. Sorry but your husband sounds like an idiot. Keep it for your son and you or buy a vehicle for yourself with it. With what you told us here you might need it to get away. Let him get mad, he's trying to control you. RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|wKbRwH3haa	Yes.. sounds very fishy... he sounds very controlling indeed.  The car was your car, settlement from your previous marriage, it belonged to you, i'm English and assuming you might not be, so I cant comment on the law.  But rightfully that car belonged to you, and the money you received belonged to you.  Even if you are married you should be entitled to have some things that are your own.  When you said he accused you of stashing money to leave, that worried me, because he must feel like he's not being a good husband, and that you must have reason to want to leave.  I was financially abused, quite severely, and part of that was my fiancee ensuring I had no money, no independent security, so, he could treat me any way he wanted and I would feel unable to survive independently, financially, without him.  The money is yours... dont hand it over, if you ever wanna chat i'm about, good luck xx|`|NRfqivKPaa	sounds like u should see a therapist. I dont think buying a truck for him should be a problem... put it in your name. You need to get over whatever issues you have about his kids not being your kids and your kids not being his! This is a ridiculous situation. Grow up. Maybe you should not have remarried someone that you dont trust!|`|9M8WY2vJaa	Get rid of hubby #2<br>  he is a crook of so sort|`|B95ksbHDaa	Okay, so the first issue is whether you believe in "yours", "mine", or "ours".  My parents have always had separate accounts wither their individual income, but they also have special accounts that our joint.  They have been married over 25 years, and this works great for them.  They each have their own income, to use as they please.  At the same time, since my dad makes more, they have joint accounts for bigger things that they will buy together.  They own separate cars, each under their own individual name.  But my dad helps pay for both.<br>  <br>  So.  Really, it sounds like that's the first thing you need to dish out, is what system you will go by.  It sounds like in the past he has always had his things and you yours...so if he wants all of a sudden for everything to be collaborative, than he needs to start putting your name under all of his things and give you freedom of access to his accounts.<br>  <br>  If you are having problems, now is not the time to do tests of faith.  Wait until times are better, fighting is less, and the kids aren't making your life a living Hell, and than maybe it would be better to transition into "ours".  If you are having doubts about forever, coughing up a bunch of money isn't wise.<br>  <br>  Sorry about your problems.  Hope this helped?|`|DZk0KXWtaa	Well,<br>  This issue involves a lot of complicated stimuli which make the situation very sticky. It sounds like he's giving you an ultimatum to me: The money or a divorce. If you want to make your marriage work, you need to go to counseling or read a book that I'm reading called "The Five Love Languages." What you need to understand is why he feels like he has to have that money. What is his reasoning behind it. It may be that he's crying out for attention through his love language. Example: You may feel loved by a kind word or a hug and kiss, but he might feel loved by receiving a gift or having things done for him. Whatever your scenario, you need to seek counseling.<br>  <br>  I hope everything gets better.|`|IHZJNZ9waa	that sounds like a relationship you SHOULD be saving money, taking your kid(s), and getting the hell out of. he is maniulative. do not under any circumstances give him the money for a truck. if anything, buy yourself a car in YOUR name and let him drive it. if he really felt the relationship would last, he wouldn't be so worried about it. and it sounds like him and his kids have a lot of problems. be careful..|`|NxBYuOzbaa	WOW, drama, Drama, DRAMA!<br>  <br>  That's the problem with marrying someone with kids. They will ALWAYS take the kids side (i assume you will take your sons side before you take your husbands side, correct)? I know I would. <br>  <br>  Anyway, it does sound fishy. If you want to play it safe, keep the money in YOUR account, but if you want to see if he's trying to screw you over (you'll have to be tricky), say, okay, I'll buy you your truck on 2 conditions: <br>  <br>  1: You put the van (the new one you just bought), and the old one (the one you're trying to sell), under MY name, too -his name AND you name-MAKE SURE YOU PUT IT UNDER "AND" because if you don't he can sell it from under you DO NOT PUT IT UNDER "OR"!!!<br>  <br>  2: You keep the truck under YOUR name until he pays you back.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't want to, then tell him no, and you know that he was just trying to screw you.<br>  <br>  DO NOT LET HIM FOOL YOU BY SAYING THAT YOU DON'T TRUST HIM AND BLAH BLAH BLAH. You have to look after you and your son, forget what your husband says. Your son is more important.|`|c5UAa65qaa	Honestly, using the money to leave sounds like a good idea to me.  At the very least, you might want to consider putting some of it toward counseling.  What with all the unresolved conflicts and the possessiveness and the paranoia, there doesn't seem to be any trust or support between the two of you.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	You have done nothing wrong, in fact what you did was very wise.  Stand firm on this battle.  Your new hubby sounds like he is a little controlling.  Good luck.|`|tbZNMfAsaa	keep the money, it is yours<br>  <br>  don't give in to this crap. you know what is best for you. my boyfriend trying to push me into buying a new car from a lot. he even stopped at the lot on the way to walmart. I was pissed. my car is fine - it runs just fine and it's my choice to decide what to do with my financial future. it's yours too girl!!!!|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	fishy<br>  i wouldnt put anything in his namer or buy him a truck<br>  hes mad that you have a separate account, i think that if i was on my 2nd marriage i would have a separate acct as well.|`|f7c5f574e4f1a6efb425246391dcb433aa	actually I think you are out of line!! Why is his money ok for you but yours is not good for him? one sided It sounds to me like you are gonna bail and want him to feel bad because of it.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Don't do it because it's sounds fishy!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	your right it sounds fishy. i agree that money needs to go toward getting YOU a new car. Get a car that you like not one for him. i suggest doing it soon before he kicks you to the curb or finds a way to get the money. You are doing the right thing by putting it aside .|`|8PDzaAJcaa	Sounds like there are major trust issues in this relationship and you two need to work through them.  If you are married why is there the yours/mine mentality?  I would consider some type of counseling for you both and if he wont go, go by yourself.|`|AA10119874	The car may have been yours before the marriage, but I see a big split with 'his' and 'mine'.  My feelings on marriage is when you take the vows everything afterwords is now shared equally.|`|tqfkHiEQaa	Get out of this relationship.|`|0ulKsvXlaa	You're still with him ?<br>  Tell him to cool off or it's goodbye.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Keep hold of it!|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	sweetie this doesn't sound like a good situation. Stand your ground. For some reason I have a feeling that he would not live up to his end of the bargain.<br>  <br>  He also let's kids' drive a wedge between you, I'm certainly suspicious. My step son tried that strategy and I stood by my wife. He's now out of the house and is full of resentment.<br>  <br>  I don't have a lot of confidence in a positive outcome in your situation.|`|Wv592rOqaa	Before you buy your husband a truck I think you and him need to go over some more important issues – like the children – because children can cause a lot of stress and step-children are a new challenge – people need to think of them before they marry realize that love will not work everything out.  <br>  <br>  If his son is telling such lies on you now, what else is he doing?  <br>  <br>  I would point this out to your husband by saying – we need to discuss “our” children before I invest in a truck, the lie our son told on me could have gotten me arrested and I think this is a clear sign of trouble – the money stays in a separate account until I can figure out if I have a family or not – end of story.  Then you both should work on this and if he loves you and you love him – this won’t be too much to ask on either side.  <br>  <br>  Let the kids know that being in a new relationship must be hard on them and include them in trying to work things out – try to avoid accusing them of things – instead try to find out why they felt it was necessary to behave a certain way.  <br>  <br>  P.S. if his kids hate you and your kids - why did you marry this man? It is not fair to you or your kids to be in yet another toxic relationship - either the new dad helps to fix it or you tell him you need to save your kids sanity and your nerves.
B1sT1t44aa	This man has some very big issues and is an emotional abuser and is messing around with your feelings.<br>  I would not allow him to discuss anything with me unless it was about our child and that would be the end of it.<br>  No matter what you think you may feel for him you know it isn't good and you cannot change what you feel until you change the way you are thinking about things.<br>  He is a narcissist and only cares about himself and makes up lies to get attention so others will feel sorry for him.<br>  If you want to expose the real him to everybody I would tape record the next visit from him and get him talking only to send everyone a copy of what you are dealing with.|`|lN5d688gaa	i'm sorry but he is with another girl right now.  don't be the mistress to him.  if he wants you back he needs to work for it.  i was in the same boat as you a few years ago.  please take care of yourself.  <br>  <br>  don't let him take you for a ride.  tell him to get rid of the girlfriend first then you two could work on your marriage.|`|UZBULUuraa	I think he still loves you. He left you under a false assumption and maybe he finally realizes he screwed up. Get back together with him and give your daughter the 2 parents she deserves. Don't listen to those in his family who want to live your lives instead of minding their own business.|`|5EOLbVzQaa	Don't share your man! tell him too poop or get off the pot, he is either gonna be with you or he isn't, if he is still wanting his tramp he needs to leave you alone...|`|PhYHZCy4aa	It would seem that he still loves you, and is using your daughter as an excuse, so he can see you.  after all, he is your husband.<br>  If you have been married for a while, or even for a shorter time, <br>  you both should love each other.. but what he is doing isn't right at all.<br>  If He really loves you it isn't too late..<br>  He can get rid of the girlfriend, and get back with you..<br>  Please pray for him.. God will help you with your situation..<br>  also,<br>  If your husband and you could both sit down together and watch this film that just came out called fireproof.<br>  fireproofmovie.com<br>  go to that site.. It is a film about people who struggle with their marriage, and even has a refrence to cheating, but in the end everything changes.. if you both can watch it, and get him to watch it with you or even by himself, it could change your marriage forever..<br>  seriously..<br>  God bless you..
zVjCUUAmaa	You fail to realize that women are almost always the victim in these situations. YOU can post YOUR picture. You have no right to judge a woman based solely on her body. You demonstrate your shallowness. If you're gonna pick up a girl, go to yahoo personals.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  jerk.|`|nS83ag9raa	no i will not..<br>  <br>  <br>  get your pecker away from me
YbwDFvEaaa	It really sounds like she just can't handle a relationship right now and knows it. She probably does still care about you deeply, and cares enough not to make you cling to a relationship that would just become more and more strained with the current pressures and emotions she is dealing with. She's being honest with you, but you can't pressure her into giving you any more of her time and attention than she is willing to give openly right now. If you truly want to wait for her, then you have to be very patient and give her time and space to come back to you. Losing one's best friend is a devastating thing, and everyone deals with death in different ways.|`|u7o75zipaa	Wow, I'm sorry.<br>  She has a lot to deal with at the moment, and you need to give her space, but let her know you're there if you need her.<br>  Just give her some time.

Dude her best friend just died!|`|b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	I would suggest giving her some space. But do keep her in arms reach. Send her a little text message every now and then. Or call her and take her something to eat. Just let her know that you're there you just don't want to smother her.|`|a0de1137d747cc90140ed4293c56e3ceaa	well she is going through a really tough time right now...y dont u try to give her all the support u can for now and see where things go and yes i think she is being honest...
HnEcgVGiaa	I knew it! I'm not intelligent! XD<br>  <br>  What about.. you know who.. Isn't he intelligent?<br>  <br>  There are actually many intelligent people around you. They have college degrees and lead successful careers. However, you seek one more thing - a gentleman - someone who can actually use his intelligence in a good, productive manner. Someone that you can relate to and someone that you can find a great connection with. The guy needs to have both manners and be able to spark joy and laughter in you. He should listen to you and provide feedback.<br>  <br>  Seek someone who is authentic and genuine. When you meet people, make sure you take into consideration: are they the kind of person that can be trusted, someone who will come to your aid when you need help, someone who will not cheat, and someone who will not hurt you? Learn more about them before you jump into a conclusion. And once you do, start building on trust and a connection. <br>  <br>  Maintain a positive mindset and have a pleasant attitude towards people. Flash your warm smiles and greet. People will be influenced by your character and they will do the same.<br>  <br>  Good luck on finding him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best,<br>  <br>  Brian|`|CE4hcUmhaa	Your question implies that you are actively seeking an intelligent gentleman.  Perhaps you are either a) looking in the wrong places, or b) not attractive to intelligent males.<br>  <br>  You have obviously considered the situation from your own point of view, but try and see things from an intelligent male point of view- i.e., what do you have that they might want?|`|oS1TBzL6aa	They are out there and you probably know them.  In my experience women say they want a nice, smart, good guy but when it comes down to it they don't go out with them.

If your stable and out going far as a personality goes you shouldn't have any problem finding that one sort of a man. You know what they say, you will meet up with one when your least expecting too. Quit trying so hard. Live your life for you right now and enjoy it. Set goals to go places you enjoy or keep active all around. don't sit around hoping they will come to you. Get out with friends, that are positive and enjoy life. Somewhere down the line you will meet that special person.

afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	i cant count the number of times my husband has seen or made me cry. It is ok, we are human and allowed to have weak moment. It is how we show emotions. He will understand.|`|NgUbzaF9aa	Well, I think of my boyfriend as my husband for all intensive purposes.<br>  Well, we have a long distance relationship right now. Though not for that much longer, and after long talks on the telephone, there's been plenty of crying from my side. When I went to visit him in November, I remember I cried because I was very nervous and uncomfortable about meeting his family, so he took me up to his bedroom and asked what was wrong. <br>  I just started bawling....I've also seen him cry on the day I had to go back home.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Yes.<br>  All the time, unfortunately.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	I don't know where you or he came to understand that crying should be avoided at all costs...believe me, that is so untrue, for both of you.  When insurmountable negative/bad stuff happens and you crack like that, its mighty healthy to get it out, especially in the safe surroundings of the people who love you (i.e., spouse, friends, etc.)<br>  <br>  Just because you broke down in no way indicates you AREN'T strong, on the contrary, it shows that you are true to your feelings and having a hard time coping and need to unload a bucket of tears to do so.<br>  <br>  If the two of you can't discuss this and let each other know your feelings, you should do it NOW...to benefit the rest of your lives...Nothing wrong with tears now and again...not a sign of anything more than frustration/upset and a coping mechanism.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|7royFhIgaa	I think crying is a way of showing emotions. We have both cried over different situations. Showing your emotions is a part of being together.|`|lN5d688gaa	nothing wrong with some emotions.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Don't be ashamed of crying.  There is nothing wrong with it and I'm sure he sees you no differently.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	I think you are over thinking it. Crying doesn't mean you are weak, it means you needed a release. My husband has seen me cry in the 11 years we've been together, for various reasons. When my father died, and subsequently when he's really on my mind or wishing he was here. He's seen me cry when I've just had it and can't take it anymore (bad day), he's seen so mad I cried. I have also seen him cry. I don't think he's weak, just human. I'm sure your husband doesn't think you're weak either...|`|UZBULUuraa	Yes. When my grandmother died and when our beloved pet died. I am not ashamed that I cried in those situations. Crying is not a sign of weakness but rather is a way of dealing with grief.|`|ZVHq9GcLaa	i've cried in front of my hubby lots and he's cried in front of my too. it shows that we're human and helps to strengthen our relationship...|`|tb0NMaooaa	ALL the time. Hes going to get alot of tears tonight too!<br>  <br>  I cry once a week...ok day..jk! I'm very emotional (crying) person and he knows this.|`|8PDzaAJcaa	why do  you feel you have to hide your emotions from your husband? My husband has seen me cry, I've seen him cry, it doesn't make you weak.|`|fnBPI4OAaa	Of course I have. I'm human. He shouldn't mind. Everyone needs to cry once in a while.|`|kHLwlNA5aa	Yes I have. It's no big deal. Would be odd if you didn't.|`|bc70e3a16900c4dd03ebe4dc89b0161daa	Well I am a man and traditionally, I was raised that men do not cry.  I have never seen my father cry.  But I feel that I am just a sensitive person.  I feel pain when I see others in pain and when they cry, I sometimes can't help myself.  <br>  My wife and I both cry with eachother and believe it or not, it is a very good emotional release and when spouses are "in sync" then I think you will find that he will give you much comfort when you are in need of it.  Crying does not in any way signify weakness, jsut that you are human.  Personally I think it will bring you and him closer together because he will feel good that he can help you when you are most vulnerable.  Good luck and God Bless|`|AA10097443	You had a bad day.. you have only been married 8 months..please don't store all you tears inside.. it will be 3 4 5 6 7 years down the road..and you will find your self crying a river..because you are not being yourself..to cry does not mean you are weak.or does it..? ask your self this..some day you will see him cry and you will not know how to handle it..you will think he is weak..or will you uum....... i know pretend that life is a bowl of cherries all the time when you know d$%^m well its not.:D|`|tcvQwTa5aa	Oh I know what you mean.I hate to let my husband see me that way cuz he always assumes he did something to cause it.I say,"Not everything is always about you."Sometimes when we try to be strong something comes along and knocks us on our ***.That's just life.I'm almost twice your age so I've gone through quite a bit of "life crap".It's okay to cry dear,it's a normal human event.What's bad is keeping things bottled up and ending up sick physically because the emotions were held in.Hang in there.|`|jDT8yH7Raa	i think your thinking too hard.  if you are strong, you are strong, even if you cry.  crying isn't showing weakness, it is showing emotions, emotions he needs to know you have, or he will do things that hurt you and never know.  if you can't cry in front of your husband, who can you cry in front of?  over little things and big things.|`|DtUy1IFmaa	I'm not married but I've definitely cried infront of my boyfriend of 3 years (I'm 22..he's 24).  I'm pretty strong too. especially with my emotions and looking weak infront of people but even us strong girls get upset.. we're human.  He's your husband.. if you can't cry infront of anyone you should at least be able to cry infront of your husband.|`|tZkHHy5jaa	Everything is fine. Just because a person cries doesn't mean they are weak. Crying heals. Its therapy for some. As long as you dont cry every hour for 6 months, you're perfectly normal. All human cry, strong and all. Don't stress yourself out. Not a big deal.|`|TWCQCSfRaa	Sounds like you're making a big deal out of nothing.  It's ok if your husband sees you having a bad day.  He's there to be supportive.

Remember, you're only human, you can't be made of steel all the time.  Showing a little humanity should not put off your husband, and shouldn't lessen his opinion of your strength.|`|goY0JHzlaa	A good cry never hurt anyone.

WpCwTxN5aa	Any guy who's having sex with you is using you for sex.|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	That's the problem with most couples...they think they can handle all of the emotions that follow sex but they may not be able to. Sex really IS a big deal...it adds a lot of stress to both your lives and a lot of breakups happen because of it. Him coming to you for sex is showing that he wants the fun parts of a relationship without the commitment. If all he talks about with you is sex, then he probably doesn't really have feelings for you anymore. Until he comes to you begging to have you back and really means it, I wouldn't take him seriously. If he texts or calls you saying "let's have sex", reply back, "let's talk about things". Ask him how he feels. If he doesn't want to talk, just try to forget about him. It's hard, but it's probably just best for you to spend some time alone and figure out what you want in a relationship. You will find a great guy soon enough, you just have to patient. But if you keep dwelling on him, you may miss out on your chance to be with a really great guy.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	If all he talks about is you having sex, then it should be obvious to you what he truly cares about.|`|kRPKG7Nmaa	If you don't have intimate personal talks then he is using you.<br>  If he does talk like that to you, and vise versa, then hes into you.

NqbBjS0raa	This sounds like the porno site so far. A gift certificate to take you out and have fun on the town. A nice dinner and show or place to kick your heels out lol. Also your favorite and his cologne, after shave, body wash to smell good period. (suggestion to add or main items in it. Like any thing else if the gift cert is not the plan) A dvd or game which he doesn't have but wants. (mix that with the smell goods) A lot of ideas but the sex can be the finish later without the suggestions by the rest on here. The mood hopefully will be nice......(romantic)|`|wKXvAAdFaa	lube, dildos, condoms|`|K3snVnk7aa	some candy, maybe some warming lube lol, flowers, and on top a really long love letter    : )|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Resist the temptation to include stuffed animals.

I hope this helped, Good Luck!!!!!|`|SY3aYLMraa	Beer, CDs, DVDs, 12 gift vouchers for a video game store so he can get a new game every month.

Also, try throwing in some condoms and other sexual necessities.|`|qbKc3rViaa	id say go with something he is interested in. im in ti motorcycles and cars and would probably go crazy over something like that.  tho im never really one to turn down candy or anything sweet. if you think he would like it, put  a picture of you two in there for him|`|atNbl4ataa	lol if my gf got me a gift basket i would feel bad for not showing the same effort. i guess just stick with chocolate, i can never get enough to that...|`|bx1PqQRwaa	How about a Ravi Shankar CD?

6mBrJ2EGaa	hi|`|Aoj0qVvsaa	Depending on your relationship with her is to what you should do. Were you very close? Have you known each other for a long time? Maybe she's jealous you have a BF or maybe she feels left out of the loop. Some people segregate themselves from friends when they get a BF and maybe she feels like you were ignoring her with all the school and new things going on in your life. If she won't talk to you at all, let her go. A real friend wouldn't let anything come between them. If you can get her to sit down and talk honestly about how she's feeling and what's going on then maybe this can be salvaged.|`|iG0nAZKGaa	Maybe your relationship with your boyfriend has put a  damper on  your friendship with her.(Maybe how she views it)I'd say keep trying with her,she might come around eventually.|`|KbsLSbvdaa	You should try to talk to her about it before the dinner.. ask her how shes feeling - perhaps it is your boyfriend? From that talk and the understanding, you should know whether to go or not.. xx

kc1IBYMRaa	Last day of February.|`|YQ1Q7XeEaa	Speaking from the guy perspective - who cares?    You are just dating - call it the end of the month and be done with it.    I have never known a guy ever in my life who puts much stock in those monthly anniversaries.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Are you serious? Add 4 months to the day you started dating. You can do basic math right?    How does he feel about dating someone who isn't very smart?|`|xwrLADBCaa	Speaking from a women's point of view....Who cares?
bhm3Z5zoaa	Sorry but....no.    He was probably just being friendly because you're friends. It often means,"goodbye now" / "nice to see you" / "I love your foundation and it looks delicious so I will kiss it". Don't look too much into it or you will just get hurt. It sounds like you're into this guy so I would just start dating him and stop pretending that you are "just friends". Sounds harsh, but it's the truth honey. Good luck and have a good day!!!    XOXOX|`|cG5wZOeBaa	nope    just means you're a slut    slutyslutyslutyslutymcslutslut|`|T891gsHraa	yep absolutely means he likes you ,seems like a sweetie give him a chance ;0) good luck
Pe1gHUMbaa	Just explain it to him and ask what he wants you to do. My bf and I are in the same spot but the other way around. He can call me but I can't call him because hes in the navy.  If you guys reach a mutual agreement then there won't be any problems or questions. Good luck!|`|4VFEkqJiaa	Does he live on the moon?    Why should you call him everytime?  Maybe he doesnt want the phone records showing your number?    If his parents cannot afford the long distance calls then why doesnt he offer them money or he calls you from a payphone?    I find it all a bit suspicious that he will never call you.    I would find out how interested he is in you by telling him that you cannot afford to call him all of the time and see if he then offers to call you.|`|fMEypXDYaa	If he keeps asking you to call him then call him, altho it does seem strange that while he can get calls, he can't call you from his parents house or get any emails to you like you can to him.|`|Aoj0qVvsaa	Don't call him everyday. Why can't he call you? If you can call him he should be able to call you. It's ok to call periodically but I wouldn't everyday since it would seem "clingy"... you have to keep him guessing and missing you :D|`|9178806f6fa86b24e33d7eca2491b619aa	Just ask him.  Next time you got him on the phone ask him how often he wants you to call or at what times since there is a problem with the communication and he is unable to call you I think it would be a valid question.
iCLGHUdQaa	I'd say it's because they expect more out of you because they give you more.  If you're the responsible one, then they expect you to always be responsible.  Maybe they've somewhat given up on your siblings, but with you they know they've got a good kid who will grow up to make them proud.  They're just trying to keep the "good" in you!|`|d2FJBJ8baa	it's because you are the good one that's why they treat the bad ones better<br>  <br>  they know you can handle the responsibility and they think you understand why the others needs to be treated better. they might think it is their fault that the other 2 are acting badly and tries to make up for it where as you are normal and up to their standards and therefore gets nothing special|`|AV49nuV7aa	they dont realize theyre doing it.<br>  im a middle child too and i've been angry at my parents for years. and to this day i regret it. because i realize they never meant to treat us unequally.. they just didnt realize they were doing it.<br>  because they are busy and have difficult lives.<br>  <br>  be patient and give em a break. it will pass. (and you'll save a lot of tears)<br>  <br>  my mom hated me. and today she's like my best friend.  i tell her everything.|`|0ee4534180b167e5480c1b12507f2a0aaa	Sounds like you are whining to me.  Quit trying to gain the respect of your parents and be your own person.  Do things for YOU and no one else.  Now, I'm not saying to go crazy or anything, but you'll be stronger for it when you actually grow up.|`|Aeiouqbsaa	it must be something in some parents because mine are similar. who knows.|`|sSOqEzqxaa	HARD TO TELL SOMETIMES MIDDLE KID GETS BRUNT OF ANGER! WAIT TIL YOU ARE 17 AND MOVE OUT|`|PN7XMglOaa	Wait till you turn 18 , then leave|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	I have a theory about the way we are. When we assume negative things about others, we're usually the same way towards them. Maybe you're rude, mean, and irresponsible to your brothers in the same way you believe they are with you.<br>  <br>  They might be trying to cut costs. You get what clothes your older brother had. By the time it reaches your younger brother, it's been really worn. Most clothes only last so long, so they need to buy new things for him. I don't think anyone but you and your family would know the real answer to this though.|`|epywmmHjaa	because they expect you to help out and respect them. They don't expect your brothers to do anything more beacuse that has never happened. Hope I helped.<br>  <br>  luv Ellen :)|`|HIILWvnpaa	its just because they are little and they are mommy and daddys babys. it sucks cause i am going through the same thing right now. try talking to your rents about it.?|`|e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	Probably because you're less trouble. The less trouble you cause, the less attention you need. It was the same for me, but I never understood it until I became an adult and asked them about it. You should talk to your parents and tell them how it's affecting you.<br>  <br>  When my older bro and I were kids, he never mowed the lawn. Even though I was three years younger, I was expected to do it. When I asked my parents later, they said they told me to do it because I *would* do it without an argument, while my brother would put it off until they threw their hands up in frustration. So it became my job. Btw, my brother's still a ding-dong to this day.  :-D|`|7Q7dFghmaa	middle child. Is your name Jan??<br>  <br>  marsha, marsha, marsha<br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I don't know exactly why they do it, but it happened to me too, and I'm also a middle child. My folks came to visit me one day  and said that they didn't realize how much work I did until I got married and left home, so I guess that was their way of showing me appreciation for all those years. I will tell you something, you are working and being responsible and are setting a pattern for yourself for when you are an adult and on your own. I didn't realize back then, but I became a much stronger person emotionally. You will be able to handle adult life so much better than someone who has grown up rude, mean and irresponsible. My sisters thought it was funny and acted so proud of themselves for dumping the heavy load off on me. Both  have had problems with men, they expect them to be their house-slave as well as making a living, and the relationships don't last. They have had hundreds of sessions with therapists trying to figure out why they aren't happy.  I hope if you decide to get married later on you will find someone who appreciates you and your life will be more enjoyable.|`|vVTmJjJDaa	ever hear of the expression "the squeaky wheel gets the oil"? - well, it sounds like your brothers are both squeaky wheels - and your parents are constantly giving them the "oil" to quiet the squeaking (to get them to temporarily stop annoying them) - whereas, since *you* are not "squeaking", they (unconsciously) have no need to give you anything to get you to behave. <br>  <br>  yet, i don't suggest you change your ways.  as it sounds like you're a lot more decent and mature than your brothers...and down the road, those attributes will pay off for you in life.....and your brothers may still be squeaking long after mom and dad are no longer supporting them.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	Sit down and talk to your parents, tell them you like the way it feels to be respectful and help around the house but you feel like you are not being treated as well as your brothers.  Hopefully they will see their mistake and realize what you do and change accordingly|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Seems like your parents like the other ones better than you!
7CKipTZOaa	I didn't pick out my engagement ring, my fiance however was quite clever, his sister and I get along great and went shopping together, she insisted we go into jewellery stores and we were looking at rings and saying what we liked etc, I never clued in that she would report back to her brother, and not very long after I got a beautiful ring and was completely surprised in a good way, if you have a mutual friend or someone who could do the same I think it being a surprise makes it much more special when you get down on one knee    Also, relax and be yourself :)|`|55bf89b95658e65af7827cede5ad23b6aa	I would definitely find out what type of metal she likes. For example: I HATE yellow gold, so I wanted a white gold or platinum ring. I let my now husband pick out the stone, etc. It was more fun that way.    congrats!|`|bf6c8c12038a0925b13989b7791d0d0caa	I wold let her pick it out. You can take her to the store and ask her to marry you there. Or ask her first and then take her shopping.|`|hkwBR1moaa	I say if you know her well enough to marry her, you should know what type of ring she would like.  I like the element of surprise and as long as it comes from the heart, she'll love any ring.  Congrats!|`|zaSyEcnqaa	My fiance took me ring looking and we picked a couple together that I liked, but I did not know the one he would eventually get for me.     It did take some of the surprise out of it, because that meant I knew  proposal was coming, but he really caught me off guard because it was about 4 months after shopping that he proposed.     Maybe you can look at the jewelry she already wears and then shop and pick one out and totally surprise her. I know my fiance is kinda clueless to the jewelry and stuff I like, so I really wanted to go along.     You cannot go wrong with something traditional, though, like a solitaire. Just be sure to get white gold  if she wears silver. That was my biggest fear, that fiance would get me a yellow gold ring with like a pear shaped diamond or something.     When he proposed, he did it out of nowhere, no fancy restaurant( which would have been a dead give-away). He did it while we were taking a  walk at a marina to photograph boats.  It was a total surprise and very special moment.     Exciting time for you!  Congrats.|`|eCKNRcIVaa	Well you could always pick out the stone and just get it in a plain simple (i.e. inexpensive ) setting and then do the whole one knee bit, but explain to her that you picked out the stone but wanted to have her be able to help you pick out the setting    Just explain what you want to do to whatever jeweler it is you go to, they will know... the can set the stone in sterling silver even so you have the effect of sliding a ring on her finger etc, but haven't made a huge finacial commitment to a setting she may not like.  Besides the stone is the most expesive part of the ring.
f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	in Victorian times a blue wedding dress was just as popular as white (white was usually only worn by the upper classes as it was expensive and white was for joy not purity).    blue meant your love was true.    wedding dress superstitions from snopes.com (the segment on dress color starts in the 5th or 6th paragraph)  http://www.snopes.com/weddings/customs/d...    edit:  OMG, that is a gorgeous dress!  I love it! (I think I still want red, though)|`|sGP6s7uraa	IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING!! All it means is that you are wearing a non traditional, teal dress.  THAT'S IT. This discussion ALWAYS arises and it does NOT mean you are non-virginal or a slut.  You like teal so you are wearing a teal dress.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	All it means is that you like teal better than white.  What's wrong with that?  All those silly myths about white meaning purity and virgin and all that are just old wives-tales anyway.  White wedding dresses became a fad after Queen Victoria wore one in 1840.  That's all.  It symbolized wealth.  I perosnally think you, and all brides, should wear whatever color you feel prettiest in.  My best friend got married in a lavender dress- it didn't make her any less married at the end of the day!|`|7CKipTZOaa	White dresses are really just a lasting trend that started with Queen Victoria, the tradition before her time was to wear your best dress regardless of its color, white fabric was very expensive but as it became more affordable more brides began to wear it to feel wealthy. Wear whatever color you want, I'm wearing a lavender dress to mine!|`|7G4hisdzaa	White was not the first color of choice by brides back in the day.  Blue was the symbol of purity.  (that's why most "photos" of the Virgin Mary have her dressed in blue).  The white thing came about, but it carries the same "meaning".    Honestly it's just become a tradition, as most brides I know are not virgins!  But that's just what people expect.  I would go with what you want.  I have a friend that wore red to her wedding.  Looked gorgeous.  I think we're moving away from the white dress anyway.  Best of luck!|`|i2MlcE84aa	What I've been told is that if you wear a color other than white, you aren't pure. (basically you aren't a virgin.) White symbolizes purity and that you have saved yourself for you husband.     hope this helps!!|`|MkErhX7Haa	People mistakenly think that wearing white means that you ar a virgin and that anything else implies that you are not.  However, that's not true.  The tradition of wearing white stemmed from Victorian times when only the wealthiest of women wore white, because it was a dress that could never be worn again.      Wear whatever you want.  If people comment, you can give them a little history lesson and put them in their place.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  What does it mean?  It means that you prefer that color instead of white or ivory!!  That's all it means.    Never mind what anyone else says....wear what you want and what color you want!  There is no "hidden" meaning to the color you wear.    Good luck and congratulations!

AdoY6wKZaa	If she is really interested in you, she'll break with her boyfriend. But from what I can tell, she is playing a game. She probably knows you like her, and if she won't explain how she really feels, time to move on. Don't waste text messages on a girl who still hangs on to a boyfriend and plays around with you in text messages.|`|Mt4t34KOaa	You see, you're stuck in the friend zone.Just like how every other guy who is NICE did.N , yes, there ain't nothing you can do about it.Get her out of your life, u cant go anywhr far this way.There are thousands out there, y hesitate?

EqG8KMQOaa	Honestly, a man around 30 with over 15 partners would probably make me sick. But I do understand being young, one night stands, COLLEGE, but still. Lie to me I guess? Haha. <br>  <br>  I think a good looking guy of 30 would probably have been with 30 to 35 women during this period of his life. GROSS, but I think so. <br>  <br>  My boyfriend is 25 years old and very good looking. When we first started dating, a girl at the club actually went up to him and asked him to have sex with her!! Just RANDOMLY!! So I know women through themselves at him. He has never told me how many people he has been with, but it's probably because I don't want to know. <br>  <br>  I don't really care anymore, because he's just with me now. And that's all that matters, right now. How is the guy supposed to know he was going to meet a girl one day and she would not be accepting to how many sexual partners he has? What guy sits there before he has sex and goes, wait, my future girlfriend or wife may not approve of me being with this number of girls, I need to go. It doesn't work that way.|`|AA10087362	Good question here is my observation i was watching history channel last year and they were doing human sexuality survey in Great Britain<br>  The took a survey of 50 men and women all ages all background.<br>  The men claimed 26 partners over their lifetime<br>  The women claimed 6 over their lifetime <br>  Immediately I said this does not make any sense who are all these men having sex with?<br>  Then they hook them all up to lie detectors<br>  Men partners went down to 13.5 lifetime average<br>  Women partners shot to about 12 average<br>  Conclusion both sexes lie just in different direction the sex partners of men and women are pretty close on average because if you use logic men have to have sex with women and vice versa  so the difference is going to negligible|`|dixO8N8kaa	honestly as long as he comes to the table(or bed) clean then I wouldn't care what the number is. as long as he doesn't have 5 babys by 4 mothers then i think he might be responsible.<br>  <br>  I don't care about a number. all it is, is experience, which can be learned. you always start somewhat new with a new partner anyways.|`|Xu71saGaaa	Well im 25.. and ive only slept with 2.

I have done the same thing no matter what it allways ends up bad. But to answer you ? 1. i wouldnt want a guy to be with hundreds 2. I will guess 20to 25 partners like you said thats like one every year 3. If a girls rection is negative she is probubly botherd by not knowing how you compare her to the other girls|`|VnHBNJkiaa	How many women has the average man been with by age 30?  I would guess the number to be about 5-6 - on average.  Although I doubt the average 'reported' number is that low.  Despite the number of years he is sexually active, I would hope that most of his experiences would have been in the context of a relationship.  <br>  <br>  How many would be a lot?  That's a relative question, dependent on a lot of factors:  Did he grow up middle class or on the streets?  What kind of environments has he been in - restrictive or with freedom?  There are so many things that impact behavior and opinion.  Each variable flavors what might be acceptable for an individual.  All of that factors into what I might consider acceptable.  I can't place a number, or even a range.  For one guy 10 might be a lot; for another guy I might not bat an eye if he was more than half way to a 100.  It all depends on the details.  When I really think about it, a lot depends on how I feel about the guy and who he is right then and there.  His past might be a totally different world than where he is today.<br>  <br>  What if the number was higher than I expected?  First, I would have a lot more questions.  Concerns about how responsible he is regarding health issues, and about his choice of partners.  Assuming this individual is my boyfriend, (in order to answer the last part of your question), I must also assume that he has satisfied my additional concerns over the higher number of partners in his past.  Reaching that point in the relationship, I must answer:  Yes, it would change the way I feel.  It would make me feel more adventurous.  A higher number of partners implies greater variety and experimentation.  (I suppose it could also impy less than satisfying experiences, too, but . . .)  It also implies someone who is open to new experiences.  A little spice, a little expertise; a lot of spice; a lot of expertise.  Not always, but sometimes it works out that way.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, in most cases where the numbers are high, the responsibility is low.
cGbTJobeaa	Nine years old is not too old to be a flower girl.  Also, given the ages of your other flower girl and especially your ring bearer, I think she would be the perfect balance for them.    Really young kids, especially under age 4, can get very flaky when it is time to walk down the aisle.  Having an older child walk down the aisle with them helps them to have the confidence they need for that long long long daunting trek.    My flower girls were 5 and 9 year old sisters.  They were both cute and adorable.  Because the 9 year old has a tendency to be helpful to her sister, we coached her ahead of time that even if her sister is not dropping the petals correctly, however she did it would be just fine because everyone would just be thinking "what a cute little girl."  I did not want there to be sisterly power struggle going on as they walk down the aisle.|`|E7LQp6VRaa	They say that flowergirls can go up to aged 10...    One of my flowergirls will be just shy of her 9th birthday when we get married.  She is my fiances daughter but I also chose her because my other flower girl will be 3, so she can help her walk down the isle as well...|`|a7364bce10f3534559a9e7a19fe16bcbaa	If she wants to do it, then she is not too old.     There's no such thing as a "junior briidesmaid" - she's either a bridesmaid or she's not. The "junior" title means jack squat. She's doing the exact same thing as the adult bridesmaids - holding a bouquet, walking down the aisle and smiling for photos. Zero difference whether the bridesmaid is 9 or 25.|`|a495b03d41f960c1a8471bd603c42ab6aa	My daughter is 11 and when I asked her a few months ago, she told me that being a flower girl at her age was for "babies". I reconsidered and made her my maid of honor instead.  She's going to wear an age appropriate dress in my coordinating color.  She's going to be carrying a bouquet and not dropping flower petals.|`|mnnvnt61aa	When I was 9 years old my brother wanted me to be in his wedding, so he made me a "Junior Bridesmaid"  It's perfect.  I wore the same color dress as the bridesmaids, just a different style.|`|34f81c6979305be54f12d43fddbed2ecaa	Your 9 year old can be your junior bridesmaid.They can wear the sasme dress as the bridesmaid and walk with the junior groom.|`|68149b1f13e1ba3a68e7e708172ff96baa	I don't think so.    You could make her a junior bride-maid if you want but the fact is, all these "etiquette"  rules.. Don't mean anything. They were made up by people who have no idea of what real people go thru.    Do what you want. Don't let anyone tell you different. Besides it's your day, You really wanna trust us??|`|f7l9byFGaa	My niece was 9 when I got married and she was my Junior bridesmaid.|`|tWD175Pjaa	I went to my moms wedding as the flower girl and i was 10 my little cousin was 4 we were told to hold hands and my mom made it look like i was guiding sara it looked cute. your idea with the dresses being a different color would work completely. but remember its your wedding and with any luck it will be the only one you have so do what you think you will like the best oh and congrats:)|`|662f484d424f72f2a33ec7fc2ec39c16aa	Call her a Jr. Bridesmaid.  I think a light shade of the bridesmaids dresses would be great!|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I was going to have an 10 year old flower girl but she ended up getting sick the day of the wedding.  I don't think 9 is too old, but if you think so then you could have her as a junior bridesmaid.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	no, if she's going to be paired with a younger girl I think that's cute.  and the idea of giving her a lighter color of the bridesmaid's dresses color is great too.|`|YldfngvAaa	Yes. At 9 years old she would be considered a "junior bridesmaid".|`|jZ03Zdjdaa	Given that you already have a 5 year-old flower girl, I think it's better to have the 9 year-old as a junior bridesmaid.  It's a more grown up title and job, and like someone said, I'm sure she'll be flattered to be "promoted" to a higher level job.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I have bridesmaids from age 9 to 14, I think 9 is a little too old to be called a flowergirl but she can be your bridesmaid.  She can either wear the same colour dress as the 5 year old or go with something completely different, she will be so pleased .  Good luck.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I think a 9 year old would be better suited as a junior bridesmaid.    When I got married, we had my husband's one niece that was 5 as the flower girl.  The other niece, who was 7, was a junior bridesmaid.  Worked out great.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	yeah 9 is old for flower girl|`|nBGjPwViaa	Why not call her a "junior bridesmaid".  That's sort of in-between....you can give her one or two things to do at the wedding, like make sure your train isn't in the way when you get to the altar/let her be in charge of giving out bouquets to the bridesmaids, etc.  She won't feel like a baby, but won't have grown-up responsibilities, either.          ************Added after you edited the question--  If this is the case, then I would just let her walk down the aisle  with the younger flower girl (the 5 yr old), and have them both carrying something different -- maybe she could carry "whole" flowers to toss down, and the littler girl could carry just petals to toss.  And maybe she could be in charge of giving out the rice or bird seed or whatever they'll be throwing at you guys as you leave...|`|t3A9qpQIaa	I don't think so.  You would get one who would be better behaved.  You might consider Jr. Bridesmaid which would flatter her greatly.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	if that is what you want her to do then sure go for it.    at 9, I wouldn't have been able to pull off flower girl because I was already 5ft tall and starting to develop.  If she is a mature 9, then shoot for jr bridesmaid
K4lxdAa2aa	That's perfectly fine! I'm doing the same thing. I have a set of twins as my junior bridesmaids. Also, don't feel bad about not involving some of your family, if you have a large family as you say you do and if you involve all of them in the wedding it will look very out of proportion.Think about this, with that number of attendants already adding more should bring the question to your mind, who will actually be ATTENDING my wedding instead of being an ATTENDANT in my wedding.|`|vWEu8GxNaa	Since when did bridesmaids have rank and seniority?!  I had 6 bridesmaids and one page boy when I got married, the bridesmaids ages ranged from 28, 23, 21, and 3 x 3.  My pageboy was 5.  Everyone said I was stupid to have four attendants under the age of 5, but the day passed without a hitch, and the kids were brilliant!    I would have thought that these two girls would be thrilled to be your bridesmaids, but if you feel you already have enough then you shouldn't ask them just out of politeness!  As for offending people who you don't ask - it's YOUR wedding and up to you and your fiance who you have as attendants, they should appreciate that as you come from a big family you can't possibly have everyone as a participant!|`|NyRBCufpaa	You can have them both as Jr. bridesmaids and have them walk down the aisle together. But if you feel like you already have enough people in your bridal party, don't feel guilty if you do not have them in your wedding if there are other cousins that aren't going to be in the wedding . I think that they would understand... or even be excited if you asked them to be your helpers for the day!|`|crxbob5jaa	Having the two of them walking together would be perfect.|`|tvUAO4ioaa	It is perfectly acceptable to have two junior bridesmaids walk together. Congratulations and good luck.|`|MkErhX7Haa	Jesus, if this is stressful, you're never going to get through wedding planning.    Have them in it if you'd like.  I was a junior bridesmaid at that age in my aunt's wedding, and I was so happy.  My siblings were not in the wedding and just attended as guests and sat with my mom, no one's feelings were hurt.  Trust me, being in your wedding is really just not that important to anyone but you.  I'm not saying that to be mean, it's just that it's your wedding and it's natural for you to be excited about it, but to many people it's not as big of a deal as it is to you.
Ybo6HS8Caa	Yeah, I got a job.  Although it really sucks that I won't be able to be with my kids as much, I will still have lots of time with them.  I will be off work by 5pm, and no weekends.  And I have added $500 a week to our family budget.  I am pretty damn proud of that.|`|d20mM90uaa	AWW you are sweet! yeah i started getting some exercise in with my 15 and 3 yr old girls, we are walking every day, i am pretty proud i havent already stopped lol|`|eeGN977eaa	I let my husband go on a 5 day snowmobiling trip with his buddies without making even one remark to make him feel guilty.

I think it set a good example for our children too.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Not much but Im going back to school next semester.

90d0d8923da1d8c56348bd637a3a3067aa	Sometimes such things happen cause we don't wanna get over things which we love. But the fact is you've got to move on. You've gotta realise that you've tried your level best to make things work but you can't as its physically as well as mentally abusive as you said. You really are afraid of being alone cause you've been in this relationship for over 7 months. Jus break out of this and give your self some time to heal and do understand that you'll have better guys who will be more worthy of you in future. Do take care, All the best!!!

You are young and trust me, there are plenty of good, successful guys out there.     Start hanging out with your friends, go to the gym, get a hobbie and with time everything will seem ok and you can move on with your lives. Stop hanging out where he may be and cut all contact.|`|0JgenGPtaa	there' no winning an argument; both side get hurt! bad things happened and i'm sorry to hear you've been through hard times. Life sucks sometimes.     it seems to me he's hurting you because you have hurt him. if he cared for you as much as he said he did, he wouldn't have done that to you. im not taking side. but you hurted him too!    i guess he felt betrayed because you didn't tell him about what happened between you and his Friend. it hurts to find out something like that from someone else.    it's okay, i lived with my parents too:) i go to college full time and i dont work.     you need to talk to him about this situation. you need to clear up the air. tell him how you feel about what has happened; be honest. you two need to find out where you two stand in the relationship.     there is always someone out there for you, you got to keep on searching. believe me, it will get better in time. i hope things turn out well, good Luck:)|`|SZGirUZkaa	He's Scum.

I know even if I were mad at my girlfriend I would at least wish her a merry Christmas and happy new year, I mean come on!|`|oAMDkwtHaa	Well think what did you say to him ? And as you said you are 20 still young  sorry to say this but if it is not ment to be it is not ment to be but try talking to him and how you feel abouthim remember valintiens day is coming you could do something with him then make him remember how you both fell in love.......Good Luck|`|34LR5bcIaa	your only young so this can hopefully be a lesson to not take a man back especially if he's slept with other women.|`|54eb11cfd9f0140d9dde0991ccd213bcaa	try getting over him. i dont think he's worth it|`|JPXgLx6waa	Tell him how you feel. Something inside me tells me he feels the same way. Maybe with a little luck it will all work out. A little optimism never hurts.|`|tU9nt4Gmaa	I know this is the easy answer, but stop analysing it! If he wants to be with other women then that is a sign that he doesn't want to get back together.     I know this is a hard time for you, but analysing it will not help. Neither will getting back with your ex.    What helped me the most in times like this is doing something for yourself! Get away for a few days to a place you've always wanted to go to. Do something you've always wanted to dare to! Do something that puts you firmly in the driving seat of your life again.     Even if it doesn't help, it certainly can't hurt :)

af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	If they aren't sleeping together, they will be soon. He doesn't respect your wishes, so dump him.<br>  He'd dump you in a heartbeat if she took him back, right?|`|ymWkGqm7aa	They may well be just friends. It IS possible. But personally, I wouldn't put up with it. And where are you when he's with her? Why isn't he taking YOU to the cinema? I had a similar problem myself in the past. I told my partner to stop all contact with his friend, but he saw her anyway behind my back! Then months later, I found out they'd slept in the same bed so my intuition had been right! Everyone knew about it, even my boss, but no-one wanted to get involved. He denied actually doing anything with her, but I'll never know. I eventually forgave him and moved on. You need to ask your boyfriend, who's more important to him, you or her? It may sound unreasonable but it's not fair that you're being pushed and probably feeling a little low. Good Luck! :)<br>  <br>  Edit= The answer above makes a lot of sense! Listen to it! Trust your intuition! You deserve better! :)|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	His relationship with her isn't inappropriate. But the fact that it bothers you, if he cared for you, he would make a compromise. Like they only hang out when you are around or something to make you more at ease with the relationship. He can't expect you to sit back while he's hanging out with his X. At the same time you need to not try to control him.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Your boyfriend is playing you for a fool. Don't let him do this. Whether something has happened yet or not it will if this continues.

If he was interested in getting back with her he would have never introduced the two of you. <br>  <br>  I had ex boyfriends that I was great friends with. I valued their friendship cause they knew me well but my jealous boyfriend ruined my friendships with all my friends and I still resent him for it. <br>  <br>  All his actions indicate that this is a bonafied friendship. I know your uncomfortable and your gonna have to deal with it. im not sayng its right but what can he do. What would you prefer him to do. say he dropped her and lie.  <br>  <br>  you know what they say, keep your friends close and your enemies closer.|`|O8TA4tMGaa	Katie,<br>  Trust your inner wisdom on this one.  You're never wrong.  Let's talk about a few things:<br>  <br>  #1- You don't have the right to tell him who to hang out with.  You're his girlfriend, not his jailer and you don't want to be his jailer because that's the quickest way to lose a guy.  No man wants to sleep with his mother.  So, he's right on that one; you can't tell him who he can and cannot see just like he can't tell you who you can and cannot see.<br>  #2- You don't have to be with anyone who doesn't respect your feelings enough to say "I love my girlfriend and she's uncomfortable with the idea of me hanging out with my ex but, as much as I like my ex, I love my girlfriend and wouldn't do anything to hurt her."  If the situation were reversed, you'd take his feelings into consideration and you'd probably, of your own accord, stop hanging out with your ex-boyfriend.  He clearly is not doing that so you have to understand that this says alot about the level to which he honors and respects your feelings.  When a man truly loves you, he will not do anything that he knows will hurt you.  <br>  #3- The fact that he talks about his ex all the time, she moved down the street from him and they hang out alot are 3 coincidences too many.  It sounds like you have a gut feeling that something more is going on.  Trust that!  Women's intuition is never wrong; we just spend way too much time not believing it.<br>  #4- Don't you deserve better?  Really, I know he's a great guy and everything but there are millions of great guys in the world.  He's not the only one.  You deserve a guy who's going to talk about you all the time, a guy who's going to want to spend every waking moment with you, a guy who's going to look at spending time with an ex or another girl as a waste of time when the time could be spent with you.  Don't you want that for yourself?<br>  <br>  Remember: we teach people how to treat us.  How are you teaching him to treat you?<br>  <br>  Final Point: When someone really loves you, you never have to fight for their time; it's always yours 100% of the time.|`|ZQE61wUZaa	You have every right to feel this way, unless they share children that should be cut off.  What happened between them?  If she's so perfect then whats wrong with him?  That's what I would be asking myself.  Plus she shouldn't want to hang out with him knowing your there nor should he disrespect you like that.  How would he like it?  I would discuss this with him, and if he gets mad at you, I'd seriously think about leaving him.  There may be strong feelings between them.  This isn't normal.|`|z5aQccxoaa	She could have him when ever she wants him! That's probably why she dumped him lol. I'm not saying you should break up with him, but he's obviously spending lots of time with her so... just keep your options open and start hanging out with other people too. Don't get too caught up with a guy who obviously still has feelings for his ex. Just have fun with the guy and don't take the relationship too seriously atleast for now.... but if you start to feel like your just a rebound girl, run.

My mother was the same way, and still is, it doesn't stop. although since i moved out of the house to live with my boyfriend and have since moved with him to a different town, she has accepted the fact that i am old enough and repsonsible enough to make my own decisions.    My point is not to run off and move away from your family.  But when she brings up the topic, don't let it bother you. Listen to her and tell her you understand what she is saying, but just because that is how SHE feels, does not make YOU about to change your life because she says so.

Talk to your mom tell her what is going through your head, an tell her you will not watch porn in her house again|`|iJqYC0vkaa	apologize to your mom. remember you are in her home and act appropriately. Your not a child but it is still her home. You know what she approves of. If you need some "alone time" rent a room.     And wash the dang couch if needed, and tell her you tossed the one and only DVD you had. put it in the trunk and don't bring it in her home again.|`|b9ff940610f4c3ac65317b30bae44184aa	I'm more concerned about your state of mind. You said "can't help it that I am alone and I need somebody to love me." Porn can not change either of those. You're still alone and the porn stars on the screen don't love you nor should you feel anything for them. Please find something more constructive and healthy to deal with those feeling. Porn can not do it.     You should wash the couch and burn the dvd. Not for her though. Do it for yourself. She isn't going to change her mind. You should change yours.|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Offer to burn the CD and get rid of the inflatable ... She'll hate that !|`|jITM8Bxhaa	i feel bad for you. Anyway i think maybe your mum is stressed out with your condition so she's a bit harsh. There's no problem with watching porn so tell her your real condition now. i think being a good mum she'll forgive you.     Hope u'll find a girl to love soon!|`|jBxW6ee9aa	Your an adult buddy, you can do what you want. But, your mom has a good reason to kick your butt for watching that crud in HER house. I suggest washing the couch in front of her AND burning the DVD in front of her!!
f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Ask her if she wants to go see a movie or something this weekend.|`|pM4OJ4iwaa	Ask her out and go to the cinema or sumthin|`|AA11841749	Go to the movies, go to dinner, just go out somewhere and enjoy each others company.|`|iAdRYpLEaa	go for it and ask her out :D|`|NiRFYhVDaa	ask her if she could be your constant date...|`|v7GH7ulgaa	ask her out! = )
xWq93Ckyaa	get to know each other; learn things about her. get to know her personality. once you've created somewhat of a relationship, ask her on a date. she'll most likely say yes.|`|ieTOMSbWaa	take her out. Use the bracelet as an excuse to take her somewhere nice so she can wear it!|`|0Ey2UpE6aa	Start going out, get to know each other more. I'm really happy for you mate, congratz =)|`|PpYl2dFVaa	just wait it out dont rush anything take it easy|`|6wxgyGy5aa	Ask her on a date.

v96pYAg1aa	Then dnt go to the party simple as that let her know u dont like her its obvious she does like u but if she is giving herself to u then she is a real s l u t Go for the waitress wait for her thats my advice. Tell the stripper to stay away|`|RAatxTeSaa	i THiNK SHE HAS FEELiNGS FOR YOU! DONT HANG OUT WiTH HER THAT MUCH...

dEFap0Zaaa	Do you believe in karma? What goes around comes around! Or....Do on to others before they do it to you......Which one applies?|`|VNum3TKyaa	It won"t last she sounds like a selfish little skank who thinks more about getting f**ked than being there for her children she'll see that the grass is never greener on the other side go get custody fast and find your self a real women happiness is the best revenge so be happy it'll piss her off.Kids are smart if they think your the better parent then believe it it sounds like it's true.Move on with your life she's his problem now Remember looking great and being Happy is the best revenge.|`|HimBbU6caa	There is always 2 sides to every story, but leaving your hubby and kids to go and shack up with another guy is despicable. In short, your wife sucks man. Let her go and try your best to get custody of your babies.|`|7ewzmiNEaa	Quit worrying about her, and fight for the kids  That will make it all worthwhile.|`|YdjU4KqBaa	your relationship with her is over .. its time for you to move on ..stop bothering yourself by thinking about her ..start planning a happy life for yourself and your kids ...all the best|`|ddP3klT3aa	I don't think you should have let her come back the first time. Are you really unattractive or some thing? Find another woman.|`|gfHutvEFaa	This probably will not last. She sounds immature and selfish. She goes with what feels good "right now". You are better off without her. Keep telling yourself that.    As for the children, if they are a little older, 11 or 12 (and up), then the judge will sometimes listen to them about where they want to live. Keep being their "sane" and stable parent. It'll work out for you.    Good luck.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	You want to know if the affair your wife is having will last?    Let's see she cheated on you with her coworker and left you for him, he cheated on his wife and left her for your wife?  Yep sounds like a solid foundation for a long lasting honest comittment!! Your "wife" lives in cloud cuckoo land and it will be sooner rather than later that her lover will tire of her and move on to the next poor pathetic woman.     You are RIGHT to keep your kids away from this mess!! I'd lawyer up and make sure that the courts know that you are still legally married and that your spouse is shacked up with loverboy.  You should be able to obtain physical custody.|`|VmQBhY6iaa	If I were u I will hope she's happy so she DOESN'T COME BACK!! Now dont worry too much,let her be, most likely,u said her bf just separated from his wife,that will b her issue,if the other wife is a psycho like most! she(the other wife) wont leave them alone(ur wife and 'bf')so dont worry about  if is going to last or not,worry about the things u need to get done for ur kids! Good luck!!|`|1Byis7Flaa	No her relationship will not last.    Your wife is a shallow humanbeing, with no remorse.    Make sure your child order says, that there is family mediation, or that your wife has some sort of counseling for her irractic behavior.    And make sure the parenting plan is like every other weekend from Sat. 9am until Sun. 6pm because of the kids ages.   And do not ask for child support, because you want little to do with her.  Time will show how she will just disappear slowly.    And no matter how much you love her, she will not change.|`|i15KoiJhaa	Karma is a real b*tch and she hits hard!    Your "Wife" is playing a very stupid game here especially involving your Kids in her mess.    Your Kids are NOT ready to meet the new "Boyfriend" for God sake the 2 of you are not even divorced yet! It is extremely selfish on your Wife's part to be behaving in this manner regarding the kids!    She has ZERO idea IF this new found relationship is going to last or not and all she is doing is setting your Kids up for is heartache in dealing with one more situation that isn't stable or reliable. Shame on her!    It seems that you still have feelings for her darling... and I'm sure this has been very hard on you and on your Kids... but I have said it before, you cannot change anyone but yourself and it is past time for you to move on with making your own life happy and your Kids as well.    Your Wife will reap what she has sows.... when this other Guy isn't around anymore (I mean for real! Who wants a relationship with a person that can turn on their Kids all in the name of their own self serving behavior!) and when her own Kids do not wish to participate in her life due to poor decisions she made not only for herself but for them as well!? As far as the "Here's a new Puppy Kids!" If she for one minute believes this makes up for her behavior and selfishness... she is sadly mistaken.    Puke!|`|YBIiEF3Paa	wow she is totally pathetic and disgusting.|`|RtmfVevbaa	Cowboy up my man, she is gone for whatever reason she says, let it be, stop pining over this matter!!!!!|`|f11c2617b2709e882657207faf8c78b7aa	Karam is a *itch have u ever heard of that? the universe is watching and may plan something for her...    whatever she did and the hurt  she put u through she will go through some real bad shii in some way or form. She wants to be a cheating idiot then let her she can be stupid enough to destroy her married life like that then let her...  but don't let it destroy u.  do u and anyone who has ever hurt you would bow there heads in shame if u put the effort in making ur self better, and dont give 2 shiis on her and her f*cking life.|`|JKuTvdfeaa	you can ask this a hundred times if you like,   you're wife is nothing but a cheating wh*re, so dont waste time even wondering, shes pathetic, and the guy is a scumbag, so be glad she is gone, and wipe the slate clean. have NOTHING to do with her ever again.   kids or no kids, shes a wh*re, and if shes done it before and you've taken her back, EVEN once, then youre a damn fool.
6MRjUw0Jaa	i know u want 2 hang out with the other girls but u have to take hats given to u obviously these girls dont want to be your friends but thats ok becuase if u are nice you'll definitly make some friends on JV and just be out there introduce yourself i dont see why they wouldnt accept u as their friend (good luck hope i helped)      :)|`|2JJLYSAKaa	You seem obsessed with NR, KRS and KES.  Forget it.  Enjoy the jv team.  Cultivate friendships there.  You are isolating yourself for wanting to be with these girls that are not interested in hanging with you.|`|lSGNCKitaa	i'm on varsity & one of my friends made JV but i didn't say anything about it.<br>  i don't htink they are real friends.

Seriously, I work in a job where I regularly come into contact with abuse victims, and I can't tell you how many women have allowed a man to beat them black and blue, but finally gotten up the courage to get out the minute he hurts her child or threatens to do so.|`|3e657243a606e14632ec806cc8f3adf1aa	Why would ANYONE hit a baby??  Thats abuse!!|`|TfijWwsYaa	wow kevin g that sounds like an accident, you shouldn't feel bad.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	What sort of moron would do something like that?

YVJQ7Y4jaa	I am the oldest of 4 brothers and one sister. I was always rough, even fighting with my one brother. When some other than a family member tried to abuse my brothers or sister, I defended them. I loved them all. Why in the past tense? Because one brother is dead and my only sister is dead.|`|aXYiOskmaa	yes, my older brother loved me and my other siblings. unfortunately, he passed away this past september.

And sometimes the girl was in a relationship. See from a guy's aim in being cozy with you is that he knows that if your cozy with him sober you will be cozy with him at a party when your tipsy and that's when he puts on the full court press to slide that coziness ever so gently into Sex. Live and Learn Babez... Live and Learn.
Jfo6XyAZaa	Im sorry to say this but this friend of yours sounds pretty childish. She's desperately trying to find herself and until she does that and feels confident with herself she wont be able to find a group of friends who accept her and she is able to settle down.   I'm thinking shes jealous of everyone because they are confident and stable and because she craves stability is trying to control you guys.    If I were you I think I would give her some time to herself, Not to the extent of ignoring her but give her some space, let her contact you and come to terms with herself. When she finally does come back be understanding and patient.|`|OlivXMYmaa	well...i think this girl need support support and support..as you said she s not a mean girl or a wicked one she s just suffering from depression ...high depression ..you as a friend or a boyfriend your job is to make her fell secure and give her as much attention as you can and obviously you care abt her or else you could have left her before but since you re seeking help then try this and try to compliment her and caddle her once in a while and ..just pay her more attention and make it obvious and clear to her that you really care and that theres always someone by her side|`|GBC39wHAaa	You sound too level headed to be played like a yoyo. Why should you put up with anyone's mood swings? Tell her to see a therapist/psychiatrist to get her act together. I would move on, let her go, she sounds too complicated to be dealt with. Keep her as a friend but distant. Be nice but don't let her into your life you really don't need her.|`|QJslTCUBaa	Some people just can't be good friends...move on. :-)|`|UvJCNnURaa	Like you said, she does sound like she is trying to find herself and doesn't seem like she has learned to deal with rejection or commitment in relationships. I think if I were you I would be the best friend I could possibly be to her and don't shut the door if she starts ignoring you. Odds are she will eventually figure out that having a deep relationships with close friends is far more valuable then superficial friendships with a whole bunch of random people all the time. Don't shut the door, remain open, and treat her with unconditional friendship and love. Doing that would say all the things you need to say, it would show her you care about her and that she can trust you.|`|OKifJyUwaa	Well,  there's really not much to do. She would have to learn that she cant be the center of attention.  If it were me i would try talking to her.  You know try getting her to express her feelings.  Try to understand from her point of view.  Then maybe get her to see that how she treats you from your point of view.  Get her to see the whole picture.  I had a friend slash family member like this.
8emYO8DFaa	Typical scenario..... You see, you are in denial. Why not just hear it from the horses mouth? Ask him yourself.... You obviously know him well enough to know when he is lying to you. Skip the middle person. You'll be better off..... And just to let you know a relationship that is on and off like that never works out. Especially since you both argue a lot. Obviously there is some animosity there. Ask yourself this question....... What is the worst thing that can happen if you two break up for good this time? After you answer that, ask yourself this.... Can you handle the worst case scenario?|`|MxHRjPFHaa	you dont care if hes cheated are you crazy...               wow!!!!
CYwha8Baaa	AWWW<br>  <br>  You know this sounds like a crush but I think he likes you... he is showing all signs and that is a good thing for you<br>  <br>  YEAH he likes you for sure<br>  <br>  and I say VAGINA day to lol i thought i was the only one that did that lol <br>  <br>  COOL<br>  well good luck|`|8CueBgEkaa	it sounds to me that he is a really nice guy as u stated earlier. im a guy that is friendly also. i cant really say. the best advice i can give is for you to watch him and see if hes nicer to you than to most other people. if he is, then he likes you. if hes not, then he is just being nice.
AA11591992	It is either one extreme or another, either he really cares about you or you mean absolutely nothing to him.  You need to decide which it is by the way he treats you.|`|wqchA8B7aa	He's nervous, or he doesn't like you.|`|UofhMpy9aa	Well, the probability of this guy having a crush on you exists..  Hmm do you see any other 'symptoms' that we might find helpful in making a more accurate diagnosis?|`|r7qsCMqMaa	Maybe he likes you!|`|BcrYBSJmaa	Perhaps he likes you more than the other girls, and can't find the right thing to say to you? Perhaps he doesn't want to embarrass himself in front of you and thinks too highly of your opinion?|`|72UNDrwkaa	Maybe he really likes you and that's why he can't talk to you like he can other girls, and you probably make him feel intimidated|`|X1YVUA5oaa	It is possible he likes you, I have a way easier time talking smooth to girls I don't like. If it's a girl I like I get nervous.|`|kiwqSVKFaa	Maybe he doesnt like you in that sort of way?  xxx|`|WV36m31Zaa	takes you for granted|`|2pOl8PU6aa	Isn't it obvious?    Well, at least for me. Sort of.    All those other girls he feels superior over and confident.     But with you, he's struck. He's nervous. He's shy. He actually has to THINK before he does something, because he likes you genuinely more so than the other girls.      At least, that's what I would do. >_>|`|cxxbRRl6aa	im like that but i got game.he does this cuz he doest know what to  do w/ him self|`|0j65QDEzaa	cause you a ugly hoe|`|nQbeKFbJaa	1.Might be shy  2.Might not like you  3.He talks to girls he thinks he can get with, maybe your the type thats hard to get?
pW67CYgEaa	It means he's serious about you girl, you have his full attention! Sounds like he's ready to make a commitment, good luck|`|4E53lXMTaa	Don't be deceived  love, the weather is cold. He just needs you to warm his bed overnight and be his blanket, if you know what I mean. It's your choice, but don't think this means the next level or marriage. Nahhhh|`|6XKlW3lyaa	He obviously wants you over more often.  Easy on the "step" thing there.  Some guys dont like taking full steps all at once.  maybe after a while he will realize... hey, you havent even gone home in weeks, why not just move in.|`|YANN4mXNaa	Well he's expecting you to stay over regularly isn't he. Can't be any plainer. Can you cook too?|`|5aXKo6uCaa	yeah|`|cervQlVzaa	He wants to wear your underwear.
SiniSj1eaa	Honestly if your wife has always had a low libido even when you first got together there may be little hope cuz thats just how she is..<br>  <br>  but I have heard that women hit there peak in the 40s..<br>  <br>  a sex therapist will focus just on your sex life|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Menopause! Read up on it.<br>  <br>  Sex therapists help you learn to keep all your 'ups & downs' in bed ;-)|`|ZQE61wUZaa	Mustafah why don't you just pour on the romance and maybe you'll get some more often.  If that doesn't work maybe she's just not into you anymore darling.  You can always get her a buff young man and then when he's not around and she's with you she can close her eyes and fantasizzzzze.  Your sure to get some then.
qHOlnmCeaa	I agree, he is a gym junkie and ticks all the boxes for being a potential abuser. He is controlling and does not seem to have any respect for you. Why are you with him? It doesn'tt seem to me like there is a lot for you like!? You need to address how you feel about yourself, because although it may hurt when you break it off, no self respecting woman would put up with this. If you leave him now, you will have your self respect in tact and this will help you heal quicker. If you leave it, it will only get worse.|`|lDXAA9FKaa	he doesnt appreciate you like he used to by the sounds of it.|`|4ebfc96012aef4fc15dc59c42ecac5a7aa	He is an egotistic pig!  Get rid and get a new guy who treats you with respect.  He is NOT for you.    :)|`|vRk86MYnaa	He's an idiot and wants you to look how he wants you to look.|`|Aoj0qVvsaa	Cause he's an asshole!! Plain and simple. He's a selfish idiot and you need to let him go. There's WAY better more respectful men out there. At your grandmothers funeral no less!! UNACCEPTABLE behavior. He needs to grow up.|`|yRxOZ6Uqaa	Simple: Because he is an a**hole! If  he treats you like that, then he must think that he owns you. Don't let ANY guy own you like that. A girls got to have her independence. If he is treating you like that, then find a new bf, cuz he aint worth it.|`|JmdnlQsHaa	a gym junkie who thinks your dress is a reason to storm out of your nans wake    you can do so much better than that surely?
AA11100518	he doesn't want you anymore.  you can't make 'sense' of it.  'i love you' doesn't always mean what you thought.  you made assumptions that turned out not to be right.  this is very normal.  feel sad, you've been dumped.  and don't listen to what a person says right after they dump you, usually they don't tell the real truth because they don't want to hurt you.  you will never know 'why' just mourn and grieve the loss.  be sad and be heartbroken.  making 'sense' of these situations, well that is impossible.  next time you will be more prepared, maybe not make so many assumptions.|`|pqZAhBLvaa	I think he's just a jerk. You were up front about everything. A lot of people throw the L word around like it's nothing, and I'm sorry it happened to you. You seem like a very intelligent woman who will have no problem finding someone. Think of it this way, at least she got stuck with the mess, and not you. Good luck!|`|ZjuL89XYaa	wow. this guy seems like he just played you. its obvious that (if you were intimate) he must've thought you were just good in bed and he didnt want to give that up. its most likley that he has stronger feelings toward the other woman while he was with you. alot of guys throw around the word "Love" in his mind, love probably sttod for  L egs  O pen  V ery  E asy    lol. but, you should talk to him and ask him what he meant about everything and why EXACTLY he left you. because if he really did LOVE you, he wouldn't chose the other woman.|`|UZhYso4paa	dont take it serious...he's just a net friend...  there r millions of people who say ILU but dont mean it..  take it tht he's one of them...    ya he's a jerk..|`|dwiuV0Hvaa	well u guys commited lots of sin & the biggest was using the L word wrongly & in vain.    the guy is just a player. who dates any fansy or pretty lady he sees online/on the web & u re not suppose 2 b heart broken coz he dont deserve u worrying abt him.    the whole thing was a big mess just 4get him & carry on.    u will meet better & nicer people in ur life so let the ************ GO. he simply does not desrve u(sorry abt using such word but guyzs like this piz me off & i hate players(on line players)).    cheer up & move on.|`|jXblvTG0aa	A**H**E!!!!!!

T1CuRwm3aa	It means sex|`|AA10873763	Commonly it means some kind of casual sexual activity, whether making out or full on intercourse.|`|Z0QvOIH0aa	From watching television shows, I thought it meant intercourse, but I am not a big socializer so I dunno for sure.|`|nKSmgjylaa	Depends what part of the world.<br>  In Ireland? Usually make out on the spur of the moment just for fun.|`|1F6KJt0oaa	Usually it means sex.  Well for me it would mean either a business deal or meeting up with friends.  Then again I am old and a bit out of touch.  But generally speaking on tv in public it is a euphemism for having sexual relations with depending on the activity level of the person saying it can be the indication of the nature of the sexual activity.  Usually it is intercourse sometimes it could be something more like the modern use of the term making out.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	the simple answer you just got together. Doesnt mean you are having sex, doesnt mean you kissed, doesnt mean anything but "hook up" and it depends on how you used it. Yeah, me and this girls "hooked up" today for lunch. thats nothing, thats a regular old date. Im thinking about "hooking up" with this boy. means you are interested in him and that hes at the top of your list on who you want to date. or weve "hooked up" a couple of time, thats just a whole bunch of dates, could mean sex, could not.|`|SIWAL8TSaa	when somebody say they hooked up with sombody that means they either talkin to then or they are dating that person, but what i mean by talkin to them is like they are talkin to get to know each other..........|`|DErBSfZgaa	Hook up means to meet up with a person to have sex, make out, to do sexual things.|`|fj1Tk8Nyaa	sex! Hot nasty sex!|`|y6Myl0Imaa	well it could mean lets make out or have sex or lets chill somewhere but most likely the first one|`|FQxUpc9baa	sex|`|y88p31YJaa	making out and maybe sex|`|fZfVM1unaa	When I was a teen, hook up meant, to meet up with just about anybody, usually a group of people and hang out.  Hook up also meant to get a little something extra from a friend, as in hooked up with a ride or hooked up with some concert tickets cause your friend is in the band.<br>  <br>  Now hook up refers almost exclusively to thoughtless casual sex.|`|CwjDROl9aa	Anything including making out all the way up to sex. Depending on the person and the context used, example The head cheerleader hooked up with her girlfriends after practice usually just means met up with/hung out with. BUT! if it was more like The head cheerleader hooked up with the linebacker after practice....that's more likely to be a sexual thing.|`|HxAkFw30aa	I think it depends not only on the person, but a situation as well :-) <br>  <br>  Hook-up or hook up has several meanings:<br>  <br>      * Making a connection, especially an electrical connection<br>      * An electrical connector<br>      * 'Meet up.'<br>            -Slang term for courtship, especially of short duration<br>            -Casual relationship or Casual sex<br>      * In urban slang, a discount<br>      * In urban slang, a drug dealer<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_up" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_up</a>|`|KMmsj9ccaa	in my experience of hearing guy friendds and guy family members talk about "hooking-up" it means to have sex, Dr. Phil also uses it in this context but I'd say that they are just words so you make them mean what you want them to mean.|`|b7hgwCfiaa	Well depends really,<br>  People think it means different things!<br>  <br>  I think, dating mostly<br>  maybe sex.<br>  But basically something in that kinda category,<br>  <br>  xoxo gossipgirl|`|O32DQvdQaa	none of you are right. it's any kind of physical act you do with someone else. it could be anything from making out to sex and anything in between.|`|9toSox0Zaa	i personally think its sex, not make out, not a date, or any of that crap. i think its sex. buh knows hahaha|`|Mr8YpNOSaa	Sex|`|z6Ha3ATsaa	To me it means meet, hangout etc.|`|yUgGedQpaa	i think everyone thinks of it differently...i would say i was hooking up with someone if we were going to go hang out|`|BnPe68lmaa	make out|`|x2kqq0IJaa	date. chat, go out with them|`|NeTNnvSZaa	I think most people think of it as having sex but I often use it to mean, get together with.|`|YlS8gnCiaa	it depends <br>  it means different things to differetn people<br>  some say it just means met up and hung out<br>  others makeing out<br>  and others sex
Rb087BsAaa	Take a break.  You need to be happy first before being in a relationship.  You don't HAVE to be with someone all the time.|`|znp0vztUaa	Yea that'd def be difficult!   Um you could either take a break like you suggested and be free from them. Or show everyone that you're okay and dress really good and then ask the guy out to show your old bf that you are just indeed Fine! without his little hind end! =) Lol|`|nr1Bt47baa	Take a little time off and see what's around. You don't need to jump back into something. Sounds like you just need sometime to think, so take it. Good luck.|`|02Rrrz47aa	taking some time off after a relationship to collect yourself is always good..it gives you a chance to "get right" with yourself|`|567GxqiGaa	You should learn to be happy on your own and be single for a while. Keep seeing this guy you like, and see how it turns out. you don't have to make an immediate decision to date or not.      And its usually a really bad idea to go from one guy to another, you end up dependant on them to keep you happy, and get with them for the wrong reaons.     Take a break and see where things lead you, hope this helps xo|`|4WXK187vaa	April...    Consider just relaxing with this new guy, explain your concerns, your fears to him.     Consider knowing each other first, without a commitment. This will make him feel he can share just about anything with you.    Consider how much more you will learn about the guy's 'real' personality first.    Know that if it was meant to last...it will. He could make some good calculated observations and give you constructive criticism.      Consider giving this route an opportunity.     I am sorry to hear of your past loss.     You are a strong person and a unique person, give yourself a pat in the back, you deserve the best!       Mystified    I am sorry to hear of your past loss.|`|AYdpkCRUaa	It's ok.

You just gotta be yourself|`|JI5Wc8wVaa	Look, you seem to have had problems with relationships, and I think that the smartest thing that you can do is to forget about dating for a while. You don't need to have a boyfriend to be happy. Enjoy your single life for a while. You need some time to recover. Hang out with friends, watch chick flicks. If after a few months (yes, I'm serious, take a few MONTHS) you feel like you can handle a relationship again, that's great. If not, that's ok too.|`|WJVmrhszaa	From what you wrote you dont have alot of luck with guys. what i suggest is you take some time off from guys, take some alone time, a month or maybe more its up to you and after that time if u feel like venturing out again you can or may you could try woman. just kidding unless thats what you like well i say go for it. hope i helped|`|PCGYll8Waa	I too have problems with dating women. It appears we are all attracted to certain characteristics. Some are healthy like a female attracted to smart men who have family values. Some are bad like women who are attracted to self destructive controlling types. I came to the conclusion I was attracted to women who engaged in risky behaviors whether it be sexual or drug addicted. I have since then stopped dating and focused more on my career and intellect. I would suggest you do some self realization and examine if you need to focus your energy else where.|`|RQ9KdIwlaa	You did not love him with the truth of your heart.Otherwise he could not kill himself.That he proved .

Just let him be, and if he wants to know if you are mad, he will ask you.|`|ODORT37Paa	I don't think he's owed any explanation.  The best way to handle it is when you see him, greet him with a big smile and ask how he's been.  Listen to his response and go on your way.  This way you're not ignoring him and were the bigger person by approaching him.

SS3wZOlTaa	Homeschooling is wonderful!  I schooled my boys k-12.  In high school they started taking one class a semester at the community college.  That allowed them to get used to the system of listening to lectures, taking tests etc.  They have both completed college quite successfully and are now in graduate school.  When you are home schooled you can concentrate on the things you have trouble on and don't have to waste time on things you understand and know.  You can pursue delight directed studies.  There are tons of opportunities for you to make friends in clubs, boy and girl scouts, sports, church etc.  It was great for our family, and no, my kids didn't turn out weird.  They actually were both chosen as student of the year when they graduated from community college.  Because they were not age segregated during all their years, they relate well to people of all ages.  In my opinion home schooling is great!!!|`|2add0927fd432feba092329128fecbcdaa	I think its great. from what i hear the child and the parent have a better loving relationship. Home schooled children are smarter. they spend less time in the classroom per day because they don't have to go from class to class and socialize along the way. There are communities of home-school parents in each city you just have to look them up. You are essentially teaching from the same books as the teachers are only you doing it more efficiently than they are cause they have to teach it to 25 kids at the same time. when it comes to socialization the state requires you to get them into a PE elective which for my daughter will be ballet and soccer.  <br>  <br>  Don't listen to those people up there, they speak from their flawed mind not from actual research. <br>  <br>  IM planning on it for middle school then im going to let her decide for High school.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I've seen good, bad and ugly from it.  Homeschooling to push your opinions on your children and not allow and outside in is harsh.  <br>  <br>  I know a couple of potheads that just couldn't stand the thought of their kids going to school (and maybe exposing their habit?) - they'd rather keep the kids home and get stoned all day...<br>  <br>  I also know a couple of really smart homeschoolers that go above and beyond.  They teach, they socialize with other HS'rs and have kids that test way beyond the norm for their grades...<br>  <br>  I think that it can be very beneficial if done properly.  I think that the majority of the right wingers and wack-a-doodles should just send the kids to public school, but there's no way to monitor mental illness when it comes to a HS teacher.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	From what I can tell most of the time homeschooling is done by religious zealots or people with a lifestyle that is out of the norm with society.  It seems the children that are homeschooled are missing crucial interaction and street smarts learned by attending a school with other people, the outside worlds activity and standing on their own two feet.|`|AA10296268	I home schooled my kids until 1rst grade.The reasons I had were that I had the time and the energy. Socialization is not the main reason for an education. but if they never inter-act with people their own age, or with other people beside family. they will never make it in this society. there are both great benefits and big draw backs  to all of your options just do your homework. I took the middle ground my kids attend a private school|`|4JrDGW7Taa	I totally disapprove of home schooling. But I do not believe that learning is inhibited. Some parents are as adequate in teaching their off-springs as the best of teachers. What the child misses out on is learning how to socialize. For getting along with others is an important aspect of being content.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	i think it's stupid. i think it's crazy that parents want their children to learn what THEY see fit, when most tests are on the majority of what society sees fit.  also, i think homeschool kids are weird.|`|kbz5S3waaa	i've seen the results of homeschooling time and time again, and they weren't good. They're very opinionated to one side of thinking, and not very open to the other (in most cases) - they're sheltered, and don't really know how to talk to other people. It's hard for them going into the real world|`|zL1sggpCaa	If it is a child who has the discipline and responsibility to get it done CORRECTLY, then I have no problem with it. AND, if you have at least one parent that can be there to help walk through any problems or over see that things are done correctly and not half-@$$ed. You know?<br>  <br>  I do see a lot of children who lack discipline or any structure and then the parents complain when their child wont listen. Now, I'm 26 and we have a 5 year old and a 3 year old... I don't have perfect angles, but mine are well behave MOST of the time. That is all I can really ask for at this point. Our daughter is doing well in school (K) - and I know it is because we have a wonderful teacher. I couldn't home school my children now because of financial reasons. But, we have a pretty good school for her to attend. So, I'm not worried about her education - she is thriving. :-)|`|HvFIHu3saa	i think its totally WRONG kids should be with kids their own age and do activities and go on trips if you keep them home all the time they will have no life and neither will YOU. people who homeschool just want to control everything their kids do and not let them have a mind of their own, cut the CORD already.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	It takes a lot of commitment, but it works for a lot of people. They have to meet certain criteria set by the state.<br>  <br>  I believe it should be MANDATORY for those kids who have the life-threatening peanut allergies. Why should the whole school give up PB sandwiches for one genetically flawed kid?|`|heCuvfPSaa	I think it's ok for collage but for kids that are in kindergartner and to senior yr. I don't think it's good because I think kids need to meet people|`|0d0W0nbVaa	you were home schooled, eh?

rWnycDxOaa	he is just a user after he done what he wanted most probably would leave you, which will hurt you more now, the best thing is to forget him, although it may be had but believe its the best for you and you are a lucky girl having a friend next to you supporting you, as others are on their own.

7jp7sTdFaa	Forget her, if she's gonna leave you for something so stupid, then she's probably not good enough for you anyway. And apologize to your cousin; what she did was immature, but she was just trying to protect you and help you, even if she might not have done it in the best way.
fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	Hmm.. I admire  your decision about divorce. You are right, things need to be worked out. I understand where your husband is coming from, I am the same way. I know more than the average counselor. Or at least I think I do, and I hate cleaning my laundry in front of others... <br>  It sounds to me like you guys need to learn how to communicate better.. <br>  There are things that you are sensitive to and other things that he's sensitive to. Both of you don't communicate the same way and both don't listen the same way. The hard thing is to find a middle ground. <br>  You guys need a lot of pillow talk. And a lot of what my grandma called the perfect remedy "holy water". :) She used to say that if you want peace in your family, all you have to do is take holy water in your mouth and hold it in your mouth. Holy water or not, you can't speak a word with water in your mouth. :)<br>  The idea was to really listen to each other. <br>  In a way it has to be this way, and the things that attracted you to each other are the things that drive you nuts. Also with a new baby in the house, you have the disadvantage of more hormones and less logical argument, no pun intended here. You may be tempted to speak 'feelings' when he speaks 'facts' and drive each other insane this way. <br>  Don't worry, though all solid marriages go through that. It's a daily struggle to learn how to communicate, but the more you practice the better you will get. I see it as a healthy beginning. Make sure you fight fair, no belittling, no name calling, and no insults. Make it a point - if at all possible, never to fight hard in front of the kids... but if it comes to that, you need to be able to pick your battles, for the better good. <br>  Also, make time for each other. <br>  Away from the baby. <br>  The more time you spend in each other's proximity, the more you can mush together, if you wish. <br>  <br>  The first 5 years are critical, then you get used to it.. :)) LOL<br>  Seriously, don't take yourselves so seriously all the time. You need to intentionally do certain things until they become second nature.

If he knows more than all of them, I think you have isolated the problem.|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	If he`s looking for excuses to leave because "you" argue too much, he`s going to find them. Don`t arguing is not ignoring the problem...talking about some issues that affect your marriage is different. Acting responsibly is different,. Being married dont mean we have to agree or think the same way all the time, but being able to live harmoniousness in spite of our differences, to talk and negotiate them, to interact and communicate. Of course it should take two willing people but most of the time, only one makes the hard work, and two take the credit.|`|H0vicK8Kaa	I think this new baby may be the cause of the turmoil!... changes affect the way MEN deal with the stress.<br>  <br>  Try to relax and make the best out of things.. humor is the cure to all sorrows.<br>  <br>  It is GOOD that you are aware that DIVORCE is not an option, only easy way out.

We've separated a few times during the past year because of his illness and the affect its had on our marriage.<br>  If he won't attend counceling, then you should separate. You cannot continue living with him the way he's acting, and I believe he knows you will not divorce him so he thinks he can act the way he wants since there will be no reprocutions for his actions. He has to change, period. Don't come back until he's willing to see that.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	your not "stuck dealing with..." anything. Marriage isn't a cake walk. there will always be ups and downs. more than likely it's the WAY you two communicate that is the issue here. i have to say though....a marriage will NOT work if one of the couple is not willing to seek out help. you cannot fix it all by yourself hon. I'm speaking from experience hon. my ex husband wanted NOTHING to do w/counseling. i tried my damnest to make things right, but it got to the point that all i had to do was walk in the room for him to start a fight over nothing. <br>  <br>  Sometimes you have to know when to cut your losses. So continue to encourage seeking out help. if he still refuses then just sit down and ask him very calmly and very seriously..."What do you suggest we do to help our relationship? Because i cant do this on my own, i need your help too? What are your suggestions?"<br>  <br>  and see where that gets ya. if he still blows you off, you might need to re-evaluate the situation and ask yourself if you're prepared to live w/someone for the rest of your life that doesn't give a flip about your happiness or marriage.<br>  <br>  I'll tell ya i don't regret my divorce in the least. We are friends still (we share one child), and he's met his soul mate and worked through his own issues. likewise i have my wonderful hubs of 8 yrs that is my soul mate, sometimes what seems like "the worst" really is the best in disguise.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Divorce may not be an option, but sometimes its the only answer. You feel the way you do because youre putting all this effortinto saving your marriage and yet you see nothing happening and his attitude isnt helping you any here. I can tell your at your very end of dealing with this because youre resorting to bringing your challenge on here. You dont know where to turn to anymore in trying to resolve this. Staying in a one sided marriage where theres little or no hope of ever changing isnt good either as it will slowly eat you up and the situation will only get worse. his not wanting to deal with this doesnt help matters either. So in everyones life comes a point where enough eventually becomes enough and youve had all you can take after exhausting all avenues to save it. Somethings for whatever reason just werent meant to be, no matter how hard we try. Now you must decide whether for you and your child if its better to stay with or without him and then go from there. No one can ever say you didnt try to save it but things just to overwhelming for you and he didnt want to help so you just moved on. Now since none of us can see our future, we dont know what tomorrow will bring. Ive seen many couples in the same boat as you call it quits and divorce only to work out their differences during the divorce period and get remarried and actually live a better life the second time around. So theres no telling what could happen but it may just force your husband into thinking about what he lost and actually do something. Good luck|`|bSiNAsHJaa	girl it will never change. i been with mine for 12 years and i still refuse to get married.  he has asked me a million times but i just dont want to be with him forever cuz he gets on my nerves. but i have three kids and leaving is not a choice since hes not the nicest person he will try to keep the kids and im not going through that ****.  so i stay and deal with it but as soon as i can leave one day peacefully i will so if its not an option for you to divorce then it will always be a problem so you should find a way to cope with it now so you can get use to it.  men never change and if they do it wont last long.|`|4HoVVCenaa	If it is not an option, and he won't change, then your only option is to adapt. Specifically, you need to accomodate, or ignore his issues. In effect, you need to reach an "agree to disagree" position and then live accordingly. Many marriages exist under these terms. That is, they are house mates, but not really in love anymore.|`|IvMPh09baa	Well you seem to be telling yourself that there is no solution to your problems.  What is the solution?

Each couple have their own merits.  It can work for one but not for many more in between.  You do have to take the age factor in when you are thinking about kids, do you want any or not?  But the most important factor in any relationship is what do you have in common?  That may be the one big reason people who are the same age get along better, they do have more in common, but that's still not to say what you present wouldn't work.  I guess for myself it seems a little creepy, but that's mainly because it is so foreign to me, I am used to seeing about the same aged people together.|`|JPApIxo1aa	im 20, and i say yes,<br>  i am attracted to older wimen, physically and mentally<br>  its not wrong, many many people are that way and have really good lives, <br>  dont back out because of his age,<br>  if ur both mature about this then age should never be an object,<br>  only way u feel about each other, <br>  age should be the least of ur worries.<br>  (if its u in the relationship best of luck)|`|jW6E3ffHaa	It's totally fine|`|jkapPqaCaa	to be honest i think that there is too much of an age gap, but it doesn't really matter how old the person is as long as they love each other and are happy to spend the rest of their lives together.

nr1Bt47baa	To be honest, you don't. Seven years is a long time and it's hard to just let someone go you've been with for seven years. I had a girlfriend for four years and it's been almost three years since we broke up and I still think about her everyday. I was even the one who left her. I feel like I made a wrong decision but things are still good. The fact is you wont ever forget her.|`|Iq1R5ehvaa	well babe, a 7 year relationship is gonna be hard to get over and 7 years also gives a since of the right to possession. i've been with my boyfriend for 4 months and when he goes out or away for a night or even a day, it is SO hard for me not to be jealous or act on my possessiveness. and if i feel like i can't control it i simply explain to him the way i feel... ha one time i told him, through my tears and sobbing voice on the phone, "i love you and can't help but feel EXTREMELY possessive of you," and his response was, "i love you too and you have EVERY right to feel possessive of me as I do you. but we are apart right now and i'm not telling you not to go out and have fun... i trust you as you should me." and it made everything better.   if you love her and think that you could talk out her clingy-ness, you should get back together and work through it. but if you really dont want to deal with it then you should move on and not listen to what she has to say.|`|yWROYbZAaa	There is no easy way to get over this....the best way is to not have contact with her...once you talk or see her again all those feelings for her will start rushing back and it will make it harder to move on. Spend more time with your friends, get a second job, flirt with other girls. It really just takes time.....|`|USJD1kdcaa	live and breath. each day is one more day to heal. Dont let what she said stick in your brain. it will hurt for a while. but just live and breath.|`|1pABQIbhaa	u should talk to ur freinds about it mabey they will help console over wit...do u still love her if u do tell her and all the crazy things she do s because she loves u too...jus tell her to chill and mabey she will leave u alone ....get a hotter girlfreind first of all ....put itr in the exes face and show her off....that will definitey help u get ova her.heheheheh|`|uUMLGucwaa	I would keep her as a friend. Tell her u really enjoyed the time together and if she wants to be with u she needs to do some major changing. My hubby was like this too. But after lots of praying and going to church he has changed..not completely but it has gotten better. Sometimes the other partner needs to see how they are treating us too. Mine came from a family full of insecurity, and jealousy. Thank God though...we are still together 13yrs now and we argue but we really love each other and want to make things work.

I'm assuming you are teens with parents still but you are way to young to be carrying a long distance relationship with someone who is in another country. You must live life and not have one guy who you really care about but is miles away keep you from doing so. Just point out that he lives in canada and you wherever and that the both of you are young good people who deserve to be with people who will be with you beside you and feel loved thats all. Its gonna hurt a bit but it has to get done.|`|TrEYixLXaa	First of all, when you LOVE someone, I mean, truly LOVE someone; you would NOT suggest to see other people.  If you love him as much as you say you do or if he loves you, you OR him should be willing to do whatever it takes to make it work.  That's what love's all about.|`|DfWnNwnZaa	If you love him enough then you should move to canada to be with him. Or he should come with you.

3DF7X1mhaa	From my experience it is not very often that when a wedding invitation is sent to a home where there is a couple that only one person out of the couple is invited. People usually budget for 2 people per invitation when they send them out.     Now different rules apply to your son. Some people are very strict about not having any children at their wedding, they feel that they don't want any tantrums to interrupt their special day. But again that depend on how formal their wedding is and if they are on a budget (some venues charge up to $75 for a child's seat) Being that you fiance is the grooms best friend, just ask him to double check for you.    What I am trying to say is ASK the worst thing you can hear is no!    PS Don't worry about not knowing anyone, a wedding is a joyous occasion. It is celebrating the joining of two people and blending of two families, everyone will be having a good time and they want you to have a good time too. Plus I am sure your fiance will be keeping your company. : )  Best of luck!|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	well if he didn't even tell you about the wedding then well dont go.  if you run into the friend ask politely and say  i just want to know if  my fiance can bring a guest or no and if he says yes say are you also allowing  children to the event  if yes or no make accommodation's for a sitter  and you will know your man have fun and dance the night away if you can if you are not invited then well  go get some girls together and have a girls night with people you know|`|yTirNVXyaa	Have your fiance ask the groom what they want. Just say that you two can't remember the invitation wording and would like a little more clarity about the wedding.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	If it was just an announcement, could it have been just a save the date card, instead of the actual invite? How far away is the wedding?    You could always have your fiance ask the groom if he can bring you two. He must be fairly close to the groom, so this shouldn't be an awkward conversation. Most likely you are invited too. I'm not sure about your son.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Your fiancee needs to ask the bride and groom if you were included on the wedding invitation that he received.        If your child's name is not listed on the invitation then, your child is NOT invited.        Grow up - this isn't about you!   It's OK to be quiet and shy since you don't know anyone very well.  If the bridal party is segregated from their partners during the reception, you will probably be seated with the other partners of the bridal party.|`|YMff2MIoaa	just come strait out w/ it and ask|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	make no assumptions.  If his invite isn't him and you or him and guest or you don't receive your own invite then you aren't invited.  the way you know kids are welcome is if the invite says "and family".  If that wasn't on there then no kids.    in general it is considered rude to not invite the spouses or long term SOs of your guests and wedding party but yes, I've heard of weddings where the couple did not invite the wedding party's SOs or spouses.  And I've heard of weddings where the best man and MOH backed out because their spouses were snubbed that way.    I would say that your BF should tell them he tossed the invite and forgot to check if you and the child were invited.  In other words, HE needs to ask.      don't jump ahead of yourself yet and worry about this and that and what have you.  Find out if you were even invited first.    Good Luck.|`|jZ03Zdjdaa	If your fiance is a groomsmen then the invitation *should* have been addressed to him and you.  IMO, it's safe for you to assume that you are invited too, b/c if they didn't invite you, it would have be a huge etiquette faux pas.  But since your son was not specifically invited, he is NOT invited.  Please don't put them on the spot by asking.  RSVP for 2.|`|HRJkHuw4aa	call them and ask, or have your fiance ask. I wouldnt bring your son|`|vWEu8GxNaa	You need to ask the question - or if it's your fiances best friend and you feel uncomfortable about asking, get him to ask for you!|`|URO3gDXcaa	don't assume anything.  call and inquire.|`|AA11946005	No, don't assume anything especially when there is a child involved.  Many perhaps most brides don't want children at weddings.  If your fiance is in the bridal party, MORE THAN LIKELY YOU ARE INVITED, but have him clarify that, and ask about your son at the same time.  Better safe than sorry.|`|TiAK1629aa	Bad idea to bring the 3 year old.  3 year olds and weddings don't mix.  Find a sitter and you go and enjoy yourself.  Use the wedding as an opportunity to get to know other people and extend some friendships.      It's easy to attend the wedding alone.  Just walk in, be escorted to your seat, sit through the ceremony, and you'll see your fiance afterwards.|`|c93ea3c8cf1c3dd9a0e3b461289096d9aa	It is pretty normal that the members of the wedding party will bring a spouse or date. I don't think that would be weird for you to go; all the other partners of the wedding party will be sitting alone as well. As for bringing your son, you should definitely ask, or have your fiance ask, if young children are invited to the ceremony and/or reception.|`|0WASp0bHaa	Your fiance needs to ask the groom if he can bring a guest to the wedding. Never bring a 3 year old to a wedding. It is no place for an active child of this age. Don't bring your son just for your company.  What about the other spouse/girlfriend of  the other groomsmen. Talk to them. You are marrying this man, these are his friends, just chat with the others at your table.
vo7Ws7xtaa	If he wants a real relationship, he wants someone who will be his friend, not his mother.  Someone with similar interests and goals, someone to listen and care about him, someone who will be honest, he just wants a person who's got his back, and hopefully won't be overly dramatic - I think most men just want a strong woman to be at his side through good and bad times.  I'm sure I'm sounding like the anti feminist or something, but I don't think men and woman are all that different, when we're in a relationship we all want to feel comfortable and like we can trust that person to be there through thick and thin, to have happy moments with and get through the bad stuff easier.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|koaVQVnJaa	Some guys just want to do the dirty so they tell you anything they think you might want to hear.

Make sure he knows that he will still see both of you.  You can even pump him up by saying that he will get you all to himself and then he'll get his dad all to himself.

Do not argue in front  of him or have any open problems in front of him though. If you and your husband have a problem them discuss it away from your son.

When one parent arrives for his/her designated time, the other vacates right away, so as to minimize or eliminate the presence of both at the same time.<br>  <br>  At times, bird's nest access can be coupled with specified access with the other parent say, for example, for dinner one night a week.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, this form of access or custody will end when the youngest child reaches the age of majority at which time, one parent either buys the other out of their interest, if any, in the former family residence, or it is sold and the proceeds divided pursuant to the matrimonial property regime or separation agreement.<br>  <br>  The arrangement can be expensive as it generally requires that three separate residences be maintained, the "nest" and a separate residence for each parent.<br>  <br>  The concept is somewhat novel and appears to have as its origin a Virginia case Lamont v Lamont.<br>  In Canada, Greenough v Greenough was a ground-breaker case in that the Court implemented a bird's nest custody order even though it had not been asked for by either party. Justice Quinn, in Greenough stated:<br>  <br>  "In Lamont ... the court made a bird’s nest custody arrangement in which the children (aged 3 and 5 years) remained in the home, with the mother staying in the home during the week and the father on the weekend. I think that the benefits of a bird’s nest order are best achieved where the children are able to stay in the matrimonial home, particularly if it has been the only residence that they have known....<br>  <br>  "Time and time again I have seen cases (and this is one) where the children are being treated as Frisbees. In general, parents do not seem to appreciate the gross disruption to which children are subjected where one of the parents has frequent access. In this regard, I do not believe there must be evidence that the children are suffering before the court is free to act. To me, it is a matter of common sense. At the risk of falling prey to simplistic generalities, I am of the view that, given a choice, I do not see why anyone would select a living arrangement which involved so much movement from house to house."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice</a>
Q1MI6L96aa	He is telling you when you are able to wear your glasses? This is not a good sign at all, especially since you seemingly want to please him by allowing him to dictate to you when to wear something that is not some accessory that should be tossed aside on a whim. And you need to understand that you aren't an accessory for any guy.|`|vTvsgVJiaa	Well the way he goes about it is all wrong.  My husband made a small suggestion when i had my glasses off a couple times by saying things like "I love how bright your eyes are without your glasses" or "Your eyes are so beautiful, I don't know why you hide behind the glasses" those types of things.  I got contacts for my wedding day but now he says i look good either way, glasses or no glasses.  So you never know, maybe he is just trying to compliment you without your glasses but doesn't know how to go about it.    It sounds to me like he is trying to be too controlling though.  Sit him down and say "hey i hate that shirt you are wearing, take it off and never wear it again"  then when he says what the hell was that??  say "that's how you make me feel when you take my glasses and tell me they look bad.  You either need to accept it and smarten up or this relationship can't continue"  If he smartens up you are good to go, if not get out of the relationship.  If he is controlling this part of you he will control the rest of you for the rest of your life.|`|9xgGd9praa	He sounds like an idiot, glasses really make a face, and besides, he should appreciate your beauty as it is, and care far more about your personality.  If a guy did that to me when I was wearing my glasses, I would probably smack him one, I need them to see, without them I feel naked, and they complete my face.  Tell him he's a tw*t.  Just wear them, when he snatches them away, put them on again.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Not normal.    You had them when you met, right?  And, sometimes glasses enhance the beauty of the eyes (which are the most important first point of contact with any woman).    Don`t worry about it.   And, tell him to stop being so controlling - he loves you (he says) so he should accept you as you are.|`|1c98ba0da76082f194ab437ed318f277aa	It sounds like you have a control freak on your hands. You better be careful, it starts with your glasses, then he tells you want clothes you can and can not wear, then he tells you who you can have a friends.  Put an end to his behavior right away, or kick him to the curb!|`|AA12233287	You shouldn't feel that way, if you have glasses it's for a reason or the doctor wouldn't have prescribed them. You shouldn't feel insecure, and you should wear your glasses, if an eye doctor prescribed them it was for a reason. Tell your boyfriend to get over himself.|`|3IXj7jQNaa	tell him to get his f...ing hands off you. he shouldn't snatch anything. and he lets you???? wtf get rid of him. you are your own woman never let any man TELL you what to do.|`|JAEeotdKaa	For me Its Definitely *NOT* Normal|`|X6hK915Naa	ok he dosnt like you fo who u r and i think hes embaressed because people with glasses are considered nerds and he just mite be embaressed of the that so he dosnt like you for you....leave him|`|0OSr4gQDaa	thats really strange its like hes ashamed of the fact that u wear glasses and is afraid someone will c his girlfriend wearing them!! at the end of the day he should be going out with u 4 all ur gr8 qualities!! nooo it aint normal.!|`|AA10809580	Not normal.  Keep the glasses, ditch the boyfriend.|`|qegWdsNLaa	No.  Most people don't care one way or another, but lots of guys think that glasses are actually really hot.  :)  (I can think of at least one message thread on a website that's specifically for women to post just g-rated face photos of themselves in glasses, and every time someone posts a new photo they get a bajillion responses about how gorgeous they are.)    Really, I think that the behaviour that you describe is really rude.|`|8jaqjkWYaa	Well this doesn't sound very good. Personally i think that glasses can sometimes promote beauty cos they outline the eyes and therefore make them more noticeable so as for "hiding" beauty, well that's rubbish I'm afraid...anyways, they are your glasses and it's up to you when you wear them- He's got no right to snatch them off you. Anyway he's not really loving you for who you are. You wear glasses and if he loves you then he should learn to accept this.  How this comes out is really up to you but if you love this guy and this is what's bothering both of you then maybe find out about contact lenses? As i say, it's up to you.  Hope this helps!|`|nlQiRHRJaa	NO it's not right beauty is inside .tell your boyfriend to flush his head  in the Toilette.besides if you have glasses its because you need to see  so dont let him tell you what to do .    take care|`|pGsVIqdyaa	no it is as not i would tell him get your fu*king hands off my face
iPNOVR6Gaa	The way people communicate often becomes habit.  She is in a habit of speaking with anger.  When she does it, tell her that there is no need to get upset, and tell her that if she wants a positive response from you to express her problem again in a calm, reasonable tone of voice.  Begin making doing things for her contingent upon her speaking nicely to you.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	My mother does this to my father. I suggest you go to counseling ASAP.

Go see a counselor|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	I hear you!  i have been acting horribly towards my husband the last few weeks and i have no idea why.   i get mad over nothing and start screaming when he doesn't jump out of his seat to help me. and when he does help me he just isn't doing it right.  he feels like there is just no winning. and i feel guilty for being so evil.   there must be something going on with your wife.  for me it was that i started to feel overwhelmed. and no there is nothing in my life that is really overwhelming in the big picture, but whatever was causing it made me difficult to be around.  Try bringing your wife flowers or something just to show her that you love her and that she is appreciated.   i love to sleep in but my hubby (who is in the army) is a super early riser.  the other day he had left and came back with breakfast from mcdonalds (my fave)  it was such a sweet gesture and i knew that he was trying hard.    sometimes its not that she is mad at you but maybe is mad at the situation and takes it out on you.   or you may not do it on purpose but to her it seems so irritating.  just try doing little things and when you see warning signs of her getting upset take the time to go for a walk or get outta the house for an hour and let her cool off. then show her you love her.  it's not your fault but to solve the problem maybe she needs that little extra reassurance.  good luck|`|gjaPNWbTaa	It's only your fault for putting up with this abusive behavior. <br>  <br>  The next time she does it I suggest you calmly tell her that you are tired of this kind of treatment and that if she wishes for your marriage to be good and healthy she has some work to do.  <br>  <br>  Ask her what she expects from you.  Throw the ball into her court.<br>  <br>  I know you say divorce is not an option, and I am not suggesting you divorce, but if it's not an option than she's got you completely in the corner.  You need something to use as leverage to get any respect back in this marriage.|`|jNFdrkp5aa	I guess my husband has the same complaint. So may be I'm in the best position to answer. I think you should talk to her, you should understand her better in terms of her expectations and her priorities. Make her write down her priorities and you make sure that you understand them. Similarly, you also write down your priorities and make sure your wife looks at them everyday.<br>  <br>  There are two scenarios. First one is that may be the things that she is yelling at you for are of utmost importance to her and nowhere important to you - but you should look at things from her perspective. In this case, meeting of minds is very important. You should understand that something that is important to her should be important to you.<br>  <br>  In the second scenario, if she yelled at you for something thats not even important to her, then its more of a temperament problem. You should calm her down and help her in controlling her anger by talking to her everytime she is yelling at you. I think your best bet would be to hold her in your arms when she is shouting for no reason (as per her and not as per you). She would immediately calm down and soften down her tone. Note that it is important to listen to her (which I know you will as it seems you're a good husband to your wife). Counselling should be last option when you've totally given up on her (but dont as it seems you're capable enough to handle it at this preliminary stage).<br>  <br>  Lastly, make sure you understand that just leaving yourself at her mercy does not mean you're taking interest. My hubby works hard on the weekdays and then leaves him to my mercy at the weekends to make up for the weekdays but he is not interested in things that I want to do - this makes me feel that I'm not a part of his life and otherwise. Make sure you dont do that.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and all the best for a lovely future.|`|AA11946390	Counseling is fine, talking to her about it is fine. But here's what I do with my man. Whenever I feel like I'm getting on his nerves and he starts griping about small things. I say, 'I think you need time alone, I'm going here, or there." You two are married so you can't necessarily leave overnight. But I typically will say, I'm going to stay over my grandma's house tonight, you seem like you need a little space." <br>  It always works. He'll miss me so much. He won't start griping for at least a couple of weeks. <br>  I think what it boils down to, is establishing that you won't put up with her crazy attitude anymore. It's a form of abuse. When she's yelling at you don't indulge her anymore. Tell her that you'll discuss this when she calms down. Let her know that, since you've talked about it endlessly and she hasn't changed, you feel like she isn't making the effort to make your relationship work. If you flat out refuse to be a whipping post, she won't do it anymore, or at least, not as much. Tell her you're not happy. You have to be frank to get what you want. Otherwise she'll continue to abuse you. Good Luck.|`|NxBYuOzbaa	I think you just opened my eyes.<br>  <br>  I've ben acting like this towards my husband, and I feel very bad about it, but there's a reason I do it. It's because I am scared I am gonna loose him, so I think that if I try to run everything my way, he wont have a chance to leave. I am very insecure and I feel very ugly. But all I am doing is pushing him away.<br>  <br>  I think the only way to fix this is to compromise. If your wife is doing it for the same reason as me, you have to understand she can change completeley, but if also, let her know that she is loosing you by being the way she's being... Do something she doesn't want you to do (I know it will make her very mad, because I would explode, too but if my husband left for the night-even to his moms house-it would open my eyes and show me that if I keep being so possesive I WILL loose him), and maybe that will open her eyes, too. <br>  <br>  Also, if she gets irritated easily (I do, too) let her be, go to the next room and just let her calm down for a minute. When she gets mad at you, don't say ANYTHING, just hold her, even if she tries to push away, just hug her.
cILIQBG3aa	Heya am 19 and a few months ago for my birthday i find something out which truly makes me sick to the stomach. I had two girl best friends, now its the one. The other one on the other hand, before she moved back to her home country we went out partying just the two of us. Nearer 3am in the morning she said she needed to meet a work colleague who wanted to say bye before she left a few days later so we did and went in his car to the chippy then back to his which i was uncomfortable about. Either way we went since he was a friend of hers.<br>  <br>  P***ed as a fart she was flirting as she does and chased him into a different room from the one i wa left sat in cause he had stolen her ring and she demanded it back all in a giggle. Hearing the door lock 'oh dear' im thinking 'what the hell' to myself. That girl better not do anything. Half an hour later when they come out and forever after she was denying she sh***ed him in the room down the corridor. We got back to the club to get a taxi by 4am.<br>  <br>  Then on the night on my birthday where they suprised me with a stay in a hotel room she came back from work and after starting drinking admitted that she 'did i' with him. I froze, felt anger, frustration and betrayal, how could she! Just cause she wasn't a virgin means she can go round doing that sort of thing leaving someone like me who was at the time alone, I knew she made out with lads for a laugh and a good time but never imagined she'd go that far. <br>  <br>  Its disrespectful as I had done everything for that child but she is too stubborn and immature to have had admit to her mistakes and when told us had laughed it off. My other best friend and I haven't spoken to her since as she has become a monster. Ever since everyone turned 18, they all think its fine as they can go out and do what the hell they like...for you under 18's just beware of who your friends actually are cause its true that being legal changes them all. You'll be lucky like me if you have the only and one best friend (girl) left at all......|`|9fbefea54b447a6afefb29d589461bf0aa	Yes, I had two. my mother and a best friend betrayed me.  They talk about me behind my back many times. They are just jealous, naive, and idiotic fools that are don't believe in compassion or fair play. That's how the world works, but this showed me that they aren't good for me. Times change and people change. It may time to step forward and find yourself with new friends. <br>  <br>  I used the time after betrayal to find what I had been attracting in my life and what I don't want anymore.   But yes, I've been betrayed.<br>  <br>  My mother wanted me to work at as a waiter after college and threw me out into the wolves when I trusted she would help me. On top of that she had the audacity to say that I was just like my father who called her all kinds of names, beat her, and I performed no of these deeds. I spent most of my life protecting her and for her to say that. <br>  <br>  My best friend slept with an ex-girlfriend of mine, and that is a no no. He just wants to try to fight me about everything. I don't like judging but those people are lost souls that need to find themselves before they can roll with anyone else. <br>  <br>  In my eyes they are pricks and need to get kicked in the chest. But I leave them alone and they don't hear from me as much anymore.  <br>  <br>  Good luck. All you need is yourself and valuable resources that help move you up in life now down.|`|NCOMJkpxaa	Yes, we have all had that friend that we tried to help and thought was genuine.  Truth is there are very few people that know how to be a true friend.  It is only for their convience and when they are through using you, they will stab you in the back and make your life miserable. The trick is to choose friends wisely and hold back personal information (gripes) until you have know them longer.  Never friends with co-workers!  They will step on you to climb the ladder.|`|vbedfwsuaa	yes<br>  <br>  they r too many to name + i m not bit*hy|`|nKSmgjylaa	Answer : Yes <br>  <br>  Her name : Not saying (For the purpose of the story, Friend A)<br>  <br>  What happened : So me and Friend A were best friends for years and my Mum was driving me and Friend A to my Nan's (Who I live with) house. My b-day was coming up and we were talking about my party. I was thinking about inviting Friend B. My Mum said "No, she's a strage child. We wouldn't know how to keep her entertained". She didn't mean it in a mean way, just that she was way louder and stuff than the other girls I was bringing and we wouldn't know what she likes in the way of food, games, music, etc. About a week later in the field at school during P.E. me and Friend B were talking. Friend B said "Your family wouldn't want you hanging out with a strange child, now go away!". I said to her "What? Who said anything like that?". Her reply was "A little birdie we both know told me."  I was majorly pissed because I know Friend A had said it. 1 year later and all if forgiven and forgotten. We're best friends now, and I couldn't live without either of them. Turns out Friend A had been talking to Friend B, it slipped out, and Friend B picked up the meaning of it wrong.<br>  <br>  (:|`|5iXcXlMeaa	I don't know lets see if you are going to give me the BA :) jk<br>  No I choose my friends wisely. Faithful friends like you will never betray me right?<br>  Bless:)|`|ad6YgqZlaa	there's a girl at my school called naomi<br>  and she's so funny and generally entertaining but geeez what a biaatch!<br>  we're both in a strong group of about 10 friends and she got off with 2 of their boyfriends in one night<br>  she ruins all chances of any of the rest of us getting a boyfriend as she tells the guy weeird stuff about us and practically flirts her t*ts off!<br>  Last week she got off with a guy two years older that one of our friends was almost in love with! that was the last straw yet she can still manage to joke her way back into the group.. ohh it just irritates me<br>  <br>  and that Hana girl sounds like a complete twat!<br>  lol getting everything off my chest|`|efzoxU0uaa	1.sophie-found a new best friend and forgot about me<br>  2.megan-got a bf told me she couldnt meet up with me at break time cos she would be with him,then today when i was with her and another girl she asked if she wanted to meet up at break....and i was standing right there! so then i just walked off and havent spoke to any1 of them.<br>  <br>  3.abi-bitches about everyone and then denys it<br>   my list is endless i cant wait untill i leave school and make new friends|`|hZ9Awgf0aa	Yes, I won't say her name and plus I forgave her so we're still great friends. But I told her something out of trust and she (she promised not to tell anyone) went and told someone, who told someone.. and so on.. until it came back to mel!<br>  <br>  Oh well!|`|pJb5RDEDaa	yeah. i'm a vamp, and she told me that she wouldn't tell anyone, and she told her mom, whose now going to either talk to me about it or tell MY mom
ttujpEzlaa	okay, soo I answered one like this a little while ago.  If he stares at you a lot and looks away and blushes, there is a chance.  Other ways to tell is pay attention to his body movement, see where hes looking when he talks to you.  Making you laugh could be a sign of interest or it could just be who he is, maybe he's a funny guy underneath the shyness.  Another sign is if he goes out of his way  to talk to you and doesn't really talk about anything important.  Hope this helps! Good Luck! :]|`|DhwcHdfVaa	Aww I am in the same situation!!!! <br>  <br>  Well the guy I like I work with, so tommorow I am going to try smile at him, maybe you should smile back at your guy too, it can't hurt :) <br>  <br>  As for asking you out, well maybe get a friend or something to find out if he has a girlfriend, or if he is interested in you, and then that will give him the heads up to ask you out because you are inquiring info on him!|`|xuzFEc0jaa	if he stares at you then he likes you or is at least interested!<br>  Good Luck!!!|`|8CueBgEkaa	i'm a guy that is alot like him by ur description. and thats exactly what i do when i like someone. so i saythat he definatly likes you.|`|zYRK0lDRaa	If you're hot and willing to have sex then just about any teenage boy will like you!|`|peKTF4uIaa	the bulge in his trousers|`|8nlZMygSaa	Get his number, pluck up the courage to ask to meet up after school or whatever, get to know him more and when you know the moment is right just kiss him. That will give him the right signal and he will ask you out<br>  <br>  i hope i helped x
f9sL3WgQaa	I usually threaten my husband of his "other options".<br>  <br>  His ex wife house<br>  His sisters  house<br>  or <br>  HIs mothers house<br>  And ask him which one he prefers to live in so I know where to send him...<br>  <br>  And he usually shuts up!|`|OG4410bdaa	my husband and I completely agree with you<br>  <br>  in fact we made a rule before we got married that we would never use the D-word, even as a threat<br>  we feel that even if we use the word in casual conversation that we will become comfortable with the idea as an option<br>  however, if we never consider it an option, then we will always be forced to work through the hard times in our marriage rather than taking the easy way out<br>  <br>  we don't even use the D-word unless its in conversation about another person's relationship (for example, his friend who is currently in the middle of a sticky D-word, and we're both very worried about the poor guy)|`|IvMPh09baa	yeah... the more you make these empty threats the less threatening they actually become.  Your not being serious when you say it, and repeatedly threatening divorce will only make divorce a word to use in anger.  So then the more the word is used the less seriously it is taken... until the argument just becomes who can hurt who more with the words they use.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	One time I said "i don't want to get a divorce but I don't know what else to do" .... <br>  <br>  The outcome was, I needed to shut up and suck it up and give in to her way... again.|`|DTLGuE81aa	yes all the time<br>  <br>  and one day i will call his bluff|`|MZbQ5MPdaa	The next time the "D' word is used, I would tell the spouse "Next time you threaten or use that word, you'd better be ready to take action.I'm not leaving this house, so if you use the divorce word again, you'd better be ready to move out"You can  bet they will never threaten again. Stick with your word though.If the divorce word is used again, then ask them"so when are you moving out,I will not be threatened.This isnt a game, you're using our love and marriage as a game,and it isn't.So, let's talk about the problem and work through it.We're both saying things we don't want to say.Let's calm down and start over"I guarantee this will work.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Yes, she even took off her ring, threw it, and could not find it afterward.<br>  <br>  I agree that it is important to not bring up divorce out of anger.<br>  <br>  In my situation, we somehow managed to patch things up, but her ring was still missing. I found it over a month later and surprised her by giving it to her while down on one knee, just like I did when I proposed. She accepted the ring, so I guess that's a good sign.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I completely agree! me and my husband have banned that word from our use. We dont believe divorce is a option, By always using the we can make it work method no matter what we feel we are keeping our vows of "for better or worse". e never intended for our marriage to be until something better came along or until we got tired of eachother. By not having the word divorce in our fights we are able to cool off quicker and come to comprimises.|`|ze7xiJwTaa	I completely agree. But I think maybe it can go deeper than that sometimes. My ex started doing that in our last year during arguments. It really hurt me and I thought he was just trying to get his way. In the end I guess he was serious because he started cheating on me. He wanted the divorce, but just never had the balls to go through with it himself. So if the D threats are new then I would take them seriously.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	if one spouse or the other states "i want a divorce", you should understand that there are most likely serious issues in the marriage.  hardly anyone would use the "D" word simply out of wanting to get one's way.  are there other red flags here?  better start asking some questions or considering counseling.|`|jDT8yH7Raa	yeah, if that is something they say each time they are pissed, maybe they really want one or they feel it is a way to manipulate the person they are with into getting there way.  i would never respect that, and if my husband said it enough, i would be giving him his wish.|`|07f8af82c44cad0ad314af70c5b88735aa	what is the argument over?  Maybe you are pushing your partners buttons one too many times.  Don't tell half the story and expect us to side with you.|`|4POGapREaa	My husband has used the D word.  He's a very temperamental person who will just throw his hands up when he doesn't get his way so it's almost like a kid throwing a tantrum but the following morning he's apologizing & saying he didn't mean it, which I know he doesn't.  The last time he did that, I held him to making good on it & said that we were going through with it.  He freaked the F out and hasn't threatened me with that since.  People who do that too often are usually just trying to get a reaction or get their way at any cost.  When you hold them to making good on the promise, they back down.
h4TxVSp3aa	Show her this question<br>  <br>  WAKA WAKA WAKA WOOO|`|qkKeBfsJaa	Duuuuude!!! 4 months aint love.....<br>  <br>  Anyway, just hang out with her, don't fight with her or pressure her. Show her you care and can get along. Fighting is the worst thing and no one wants to do that.....especially 4 fights in as many months, You should be in the dream period still.
PzZcR5keaa	i think that he is trying to dump you...he doesnt want to talk anymore....he isnt trying to hurt you but its goin to..|`|kqSTDuA6aa	Chica, it's time to put on your walking shoes. He's making a quiet, slow retreat. If you want a confirmation, ask him about it point blank. Does he want to continue to date you, or not. It's a simple yes or no question. Get ready to cut your losses and move on to bigger fish.|`|nkqaYGMnaa	I am in a LDR to and i am losing aith that they work.He should be doing more if he really likes you. LDRs are hard he should be puttn in the extra effort to make!|`|VwcVGDzsaa	Girl he sounds like a total ***, If my boyfriend was dying the first thing he would think about on valentines day would be me. That's what you need so dump his *** and then see what happens!!|`|dfPqakmsaa	dump his @$$
1YdeUn1Caa	Second base? Hell, go all of the way.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Grab his hand and put it there.

It's the easiest way besides just telling him.|`|QE2GKQWkaa	when you guys are kissing, look at him and say "its okay"
EJWphb88aa	Well if u think so.. then your right.. do what your heart says...|`|qGOxMYpHaa	takes a lot of will power to do this...and it may not be worth it in the end as well lol.  just one of those things...least u wont be the 1/4 sexually active adults that gets genital warts|`|v7Wflu78aa	Look at your reasons for remaining a virgin.<br>  <br>  Safety?  get tested for STDs<br>  <br>  Religion?  most people don't follow their religion in this matter.<br>  <br>  Parents?  your sex life is none of your parents' business<br>  <br>  Might get more attachment to each other?  Would that be a good or a bad change in your relationship?<br>  <br>  Morals?  We all pick and choose our morals - even you do!  this "moral" seems to be getting in your way.  By the way, I eat shellfish, even though it's against the rules, and I REALLY like it!!|`|4YK4tBW5aa	Why would you wait until you have signed a legal contract to share the rest of your life with just one person, and one person only, to experience sexual pleasure? What if it's no good? What if there are other people you wanted to be with before you settled down? It makes no sense!|`|zx0IQ1Fsaa	its hard but its the best<br>  think about the consequences and the good things <br>  in other words, the pros compared to the cons and i am sure u will make the right decision|`|BcrYBSJmaa	Well, if you're doing this because you're religious, then supposedly "God" will give you the strength. Just think about how much more amazing it will be if you wait.|`|PY160XO7aa	How Long before your married ???|`|EqG8KMQOaa	You need to be your own strength. Honestly, when you find your husband and get married, and he takes your virginity, that is one of the greatest bonds you two can have. Do it for God who wishes you too, as well as for yourself, because this way your life will be less complicated, not worrying about STDs or getting pregnant, and do it for your future, because you will make some man very happy. Think long and hard before any temptations about this. You can make it, marriage will be so much more worth it then.|`|2aE0BxfFaa	Me and my girlfriend went through the same thing. Don't worry. If you both have your mind made up you will do so. Sometimes we would go far, but in the back of our minds we knew to not go any further. But when you go on dates just try to stay busy and etc. But its good to hear that your waiting. Sex should be b/n  two ppl who love each other and have proven it by getting married.|`|RpqXuV74aa	Well , he respects your point of view , then why is the rush. Its the good thing to wait until u r married ofcourse. So , it won't be long before u marry. And if u find it hard , then don't get alone with each other in a closed place.|`|2eGgbhVoaa	I would hate do that! I would never marry somebody crap in bed...Marriage is for life...Who'd want to spend their life with a bad bedroom partner?<br>  <br>  There's always anal, deep throat, titty wanks....I think these are dirtier than just simple sex! <br>  <br>  You could get a vibrator...|`|8QCOSlNvaa	no dont listen to that guy anal is even worse...how i keep myself from having it is i have a cousin thats 15 and she is pregnant and that makes me not wanna hve sex till i get married. just think of what might happen if you do.|`|ee5MawLdaa	Girl the power is all in your hands. You can always say no. I know its hard but if you made that decision to wait then stand by it and just say no. Maybe try avoiding somethings that provoke that urge ???|`|bmi4Xlbfaa	Just think about how amazing it will be to give yourself to that one and only person when the time comes. That he will never have to share you. That is the best gift. Not matter how corny it sounds, its true.|`|HOVvKqxsaa	well i just went to gurdwara (place where i pray) and found strength there<br>  maybe you should go to where ever you pray|`|o5WcGUrjaa	I didn't wait until I was married to have sex, and I regret it. having sex is a big decision and while sex is really good, when you both are married you will value your love so much more. you will have a stronger bond. try oral sex, you can both please each other while remaining a virgin.|`|BFjS14BZaa	Try to avoid situations that get you guys all steamed up.<br>  I really recommend you stay a virgin because you never<br>  know what true love is until the years pass by and your<br>  significant other changes.

QNoZjy9qaa	Have u ever told him how u feel? If u really don't wanna loose him u shouldn't do anything about it unless y'all are both mature about the situation and talk about things. I mean, do u want something more than friendship between y'all two? What exactly do u want with him?  Then if you really love him u should let him be happy with his gf. Even if he's not happy with her n let's say he wants to give u a chance then he's gonna do it. Because when u REALLY love someone u let them be happy. Maybe u have mixed feelings for him. If u really feel like he's the brother u never had then u probably just love him  very much that way. Again, what exactly do u want with him? Do u even know?
sCr2iTczaa	I understand it hurts. How do you imagine she felt when that happened to her. That is no walk in the park let me tell you. Cases like this happens when something bad like that happens to a girl. She hasn't found herself she has lost herself. The one thing she had that was so sacred to her was taken away. When people get raped either they become a sex addict or they become someone who doesn't have sex as much. She is sick. I am really sorry this has happened to your girlfriend. I think that you and your friends need to kidnap her and take her to the police... don't get her locked up but at least tell the police about her case of being raped. You have five years after the fact to go tell the police so i wouldn't wait much longer. in fact you don't even need her to go to the police they will come to her. She needs to tell someone she needs to also get checked for any kinds of diseases. I can completely understand what your girl is going through for i have been through it the anniversary of it is coming soon too it has been 2 years since mine has happened. I am sorry this had to happen. If you need any support or any help what so ever please feel free to contact me i would be very glad to help you.|`|f8ON3dRfaa	I feel your pain. And your helplessness in this whole issue. I think the best thing you can do for her is to find professional help. She was raped and now feels that she's already "used" and does not deserve a good guy like you, thus, doing all the despicable things to deter you from loving her.    If you can find it in you to love her still, let her know, that she can try all means to stop you but you will continue to love her. If you realise that, no, you don't think you can continue loving her if she continues indulging in sex with others, leave her to her vices and pray that one day, she comes round.|`|QE2GKQWkaa	OMG I AM SO SORRY FOR HER.....WELL I'M SORRY TO SAY THIS BUT YOU HAVE TO LET HER GO AND PRAY FOR HER. DONT GIVE UP YOUR VIRGINITY FOR HER BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE HAVES. SO LOVE HER AND PRAY FOR HER AND SHE WILL COME AROUND.

If he were to go "half time" which is possible but hard, this will take about 8 years.  Half time means about 10-12 hours a week on average throughout the year.      You sound like a supportive wife.  Why not have him sign up for a on-online degree program, have him take a few classes and see how it goes.      I know this sounds really difficult, but I know several people who combined engineering degrees and sales skills to consistently earn 300K a year.|`|bO2rzfISaa	My husband traveled and wanted to go back for his MBA.

If he really likes his new course, you may have to look at taking a job during school hours while the kids are off at school.|`|GeruGGOQaa	As long as he doesn't mind sacrificing his time with you and the 5 kids it's no problem at all.  When you start to feel lonely and the kids start to feel abandoned by their father is when the problems will start.  That's why it's so important to finish school before getting married and starting a family.|`|ZVqEDvZSaa	If he goes to school part-time it will take him twice as much longer to get his degree.     I understand that he wants to do something he really enjoys and loves but he has to pick one or the other..work full-time now or go to school get his degree and have his dream job. He might be able to talk to his boss about working part-time or around his schedule. Age isnt a issue..there are alot of people who go into school at a much older age for a career change..    Goodluck|`|H3WHxCgaaa	It's for him to decide if he can handle the school schedule.  If he feels he can - you do whatever you have to do as a family to make it work.  That's what being supportive is all about...it will only benefit you all when it's over and he's making really good money.|`|5r2Csdzwaa	Very realistic! In this economy, any additional education that DOLT can get will only help matters. It will take a couple of years but if he studies the right program, it will be advantageous.    The best move right now is a trade school. There's always a need to unplug toilets, fix light fixtures and repair roofs. If you are the owner, all the better.
l60zgb1iaa	I would defitnetly take my chances if you really liked her. It's not always as bad as it seems, the worst she could say is no. maybe you should take her the flowers personally and have the card read your prom question.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	yes marriage is the best way to go, it is hard to be alone, its better to be part of something, but marriage is not for all.|`|hR1cZhJBaa	Well I do... I find men are the reluctant ones!|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	Once they meet the right guy any woman will get married!|`|89dbda5201b9cd4a4f9e174ecf63f9f7aa	Yes, most, but not all, women hope to find Mr. Right, settle down, and start a little family.  It's what everybody does, so it is what we expect to do, too.  Society is very married.  Even when these marriages end in divorce, most people still go on to find someone else.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Sorry to say most women will lie about the fact they want to get married one day and have children. Mainly in a relationship in the early stages women will tell a man they don't want to get married so the man feels no pressure to jump into marriage.     I would say at least 90% of women want the American dream. Married to the man of your dreams and have on average three children. The others who don't want to get married just hasn't found the right man to change her mind. When they find that person they will change their mind.|`|QCmRRbABaa	Yes. Unfortunately, most women believe in a connection between love and papers. The truth is love and marriage has not connection.|`|3FQ4b1Ysaa	i do eventually.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	I can't speak for everyone, but yes it was really important to me to get married.|`|GeruGGOQaa	Most of the women I've met want to get married.  Even the ones that start out saying they don't really care about getting married start changing their tune given enough time.|`|HnGAxJ2uaa	no, they mostly want the ring, the recognition and the party.  you just happen to pay for them...|`|GcvNxfYFaa	i dont want to get married b/c i feel that marriage is not right for me, i think singleness is right for me...lots of reasons like, i'm introverted and i'd rather not have the stresses of married life|`|ze7xiJwTaa	I think most women do want to get married and have a family, but I think that the number of women who don't is growing every year. Times are changing, careers and other focal points in life are becoming more important to women. I've been married and it wasn't all I had expected it to be. I definitely have no driving need to ever do it again, however that may be because I don't want to have kids. I think that's an important decision point for many marriages.|`|1BGwGFQZaa	I desire marriage with the right man that is compatable for me.|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	Personally finding a happy, healthy, loving, respectful, committed, monogamous relationship is much more important in my mind than marriage.    I believe I have found that, and I do feel the urge to marry my love, but it's not a driving force that propels me toward that goal. I believe taking our time to get to know each other (we've known each other 18 years) in an intimate and loving relationship, and having the time to experience many different situations together, and just being together is most important.    At 35 I would love to be able to commit ourselves to each other some day. But the rate of divorce, breaking up, and things not working out the way we expect has tempered my need to rush into marriage and given me more motivation to take our time and focus more on US then the idea of marriage.    I believe we will marry if and when it seems natural. I believe the majority of people would like to be married, SOMEDAY. Many men and women say they don't want to or are not ready, but they will likely change their minds once they get to a different place and ARE ready.    Good for you for being willing to commit, just be cautious and don't jump in too quickly. Give yourself time to get to know someone really.|`|dSMb8JDvaa	Yes. of course.
bID1Pd7Gaa	Then you haven't met the right guy. I had no problems committing to my wife. Some guys are just ignorant.|`|Rb087BsAaa	Or maybe he doesn't like you any more than just friends!  You don't hang out, you don't talk/text much outside of work.  Afraid to commit?  LOL|`|W1hm3SnGaa	Not everyone wants commitment and the people who do might just want to commit later in life cause they may think they're to young.    I've been with my boyfriend for 2 years and it's HIM that wants commitment. We're only 17 and deep down i don't because i'm young and i don't want to commit to anyone at the minute|`|abc74a7841250ed8830346d501f162a7aa	IMMATURE complete turn off|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	It is an expensive life long commitment.  If it's done with the wrong person, it can be a nightmare.|`|NgnbtaORaa	He's not afraid to commit he probably isn't aware you want him to commit.  Just be direct with him.  Ask him out.  Make the first move it sounds like he's in to you... only one way to find out for sure though.|`|DZV4CrmCaa	Hes probably shy. Some people are more confident outside of work/school/college then when they are inside. Some the other way around.    Or maybe hes seeing someone|`|AA11591992	If you both work for the same company he may be afraid that if he does get together with you and it does not work out he could end up loosing his job or you yours.  The economy is tough now so it may not be easy to find another one.  Think about it.
wzXJOSIeaa	All it's a sign of is that you are insecure.|`|6zVISNTZaa	No, you can't tell things through dreams, all it shows is that you're insecure, perhaps he doesn't make you feel secure enough? Perhaps casually mention it to him, so you can get the reassurance you need.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	You're incredibly insecure or have really low self-esteem; that's all it's a sign of.|`|0fZ0TNwhaa	your dreams are telling you what you fear not what is real..  but why do you fear this?I have a book I would tell you to get are you the one for me by Barbra DeAngelis  it so good..
GeruGGOQaa	It's not cheating but it probably would be hurtful to your husband if you sneak around behind his back.  Some guys are really insecure about sex toys so my recommendation would be go with a small toy like the pocket rocket and have him take part in using it.  So many of the sex toys out there nowadays are molded from male porn stars so your average guy could easily be intimidated if you brought one of those home.  The only other advice I would give is don't make the sex toy a requirement in every sexual encounter you and your husband have.  This could also make him feel like he alone can't satisfy you anymore.|`|HnGAxJ2uaa	i'll help you train with them and no, it's not cheating with an inanimate object.|`|uI4Dspi4aa	Cheating? Seriously? You think playing with a sex toy is cheating?    Dude, just get it. You will thank yourself later|`|dDasUgW8aa	I don't think it would be cheating, necessarily, but dishonest.  Maybe talk to him about why he feels this way- tell him it's not to replace your sex life, it's to supplement it.  Maybe start with a vibrator and tell him that you'll use it with him only at first- until he feels better about it.|`|ze7xiJwTaa	Do it! I seriously think it can be incorporated into your sex life with him and he will learn to love it. I don't know why some men are so intimidated by toys but some are. My bf loves playing with it while we are together. I recommend getting a glass one, they are more expensive but totally clean/hygienic and well, you'll love it.|`|rjYOC3Wpaa	get a rabbit you will love it and have fun have him use it on you and no it's not the real thing just add's fun to the bed room|`|DIx2ZD4Faa	CHEATING HA HA. it would be cheating if another man was using one on you. Be serious.|`|55bf89b95658e65af7827cede5ad23b6aa	No, this is DEFINITELY not cheating.     You're not enlisting the help of another person, you're getting a 'thing' - a non living object to get you off.    It's not cheating.    I'm married and I have sex toys in my house. Sometimes I just want to use them, and I don't feel guilty at all!|`|uNJirnYoaa	cheating with a sex toy? thats a new one|`|raWY3hBMaa	I went through a similar thing but in reverse. I wanted my wife to try sex toys. I ended up buying this trojan condom that came with a vibrating ring. it was a easy way to introduce her to toys. she liked it. so we slowly moved onto other toys.
AYrS226Iaa	well, if the one guy makes u feel more loved then go 4 him. hopefully it is the right decision. if it doesnt work out, mayb the other guy will take u bak. but really it is how u yourself feels about the guys. if u feel more loved around the  older one then u should date him.<br>  GOOOD LUUCCK!|`|jkapPqaCaa	i suggest u choose #1 because you've known him longer and you live very close so you can see each other whenever. plus you'r the same age, which makes it easier for you guys to understand each other.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	The childhood friend|`|jW6E3ffHaa	I'd honestly pick the one u like more or just not d8either one
rrWhhiMEaa	It could be that, or it could be he is attracted for you for unknown reasons. It could be you look familiar, and it could be that he is zoned out and thinking about something else while staring in your direction. It could be he is imagining talking to you, or that he likes your eyes. Maybe hes just a weirdo It could be any myriad of things.<br>  <br>  Just take it as a compliment and don't over analyze :)|`|IPS3hWweaa	Yes, that's exactly what it means.|`|XkBjJZAwaa	Either that or you resemble someone from his past...|`|ky82orBzaa	he either thought you were pretty or just a perv.|`|5Thom9Kraa	not pretty i think u r hot,.,,,,,|`|SwzCLNmzaa	may be it depends on wat kind of a person he is... well i wud sugggest u to not take any opinion and just ignore it...|`|962bae911ad61f28d2ffefb0b7da26a1aa	that means he is imagining that is there a chance to take u on his bed not kidding seeriously   i could have explained u but short of time but u can mail me at crazydilip2006@yahoo.com
HhV3asIzaa	Just Get rid of him.... He is trying to make some advantage of your feelings towards him...!<br>  I guess he is alone now...!<br>  <br>  Its better to keep a fullstop for this.|`|5mTKspfYaa	move on.  if it is meant to be it will happen.  reprioritize your life without him and you will be much happier.  concentrate on building relationships with friends, education, and career
AA11447210	He might say anything...he may claim he was joking, he may try to explain, he may change the subject, he may wait for her reaction....there is no standard phrase, especially since the bc could've been ANYTHING.|`|QmXyD7evaa	o.O depends on what the "backhanded compliment" was.|`|ViZrWDtvaa	look at her with a completely straight face, and just say giggidy
UmA4TbDGaa	oh its gross!!!!!!!!  don't waste your time, you'll be very disappointed.|`|UrMqFBjbaa	it doesent matter i kissed a guy with no lips it's not much different but dang i noticed it was a major turnoff.|`|YgZDXDgFaa	i did.. and yes, it was a turn off! Not a good kiss at all, and i had to try and not kiss his face (around his 'lips') coz the thought weirded me out, so just didn't even end up being a proper kiss.     I like guys with lips. Plus my lips are quite plump (im a latina) so it just wouldn't work.    I suppose if both don't have lips then it wouldn't be so bad|`|Bc5v99Zfaa	oh nothing a little antibiotic  don't take care of !     ha ha ha ha !!! but then again I think I got the blame on that one!....NOT!!!!|`|Hwh7Brq9aa	lmao i wouldnt no and im sorry but i never will, crusty lips are better then no lips lol not that i have any of them lol|`|oR8yQXnpaa	Just look past his lips{woops-forgot he don,t have none}But seriously,if you had no lips or ****,forget about you?|`|uQoBeM0Xaa	hmm do you mean someone with  Noma?|`|kjKuaPMbaa	ha ha like there really little?|`|4ffcf26e72dcfacfd8606ac2e0d5655caa	there is not way a guy can have no lips.

3e0IjGsYaa	It's completely normal to be nervous and shy around a girl you like. You state that your "chest gets upset" - is this a painful feeling, if so, it might not be the girl, but a health thing & you may need to get it checked out...but my thoughts on this, is that it's not. It's probably a similar case to "butterflies in your stomach", except that you have it in your chest! ;)<br>  <br>  How I would handle the situation if I were you: Don't go over just to ask her out...go over and just talk to her. It's more likely that if you have it in your mindframe that you are just talking to her, subconsciuosly it will stick in your head and make you less nervous.<br>  <br>  Prolly not the answer you're looking for, but hope it helps none the less!|`|udsWW6y5aa	"chest gets upset"<br>  <br>  Huh?|`|wZmp9mAWaa	aw that's so sweet.<br>  she's probably shy as well.<br>  why don't you try talking to her on msn first? then you can get to know each other well.<br>  then when you see each other in person, you'll feel more comfortable around each other, or arrange for you, your mates, her and her mates to all meet up and go to the cinema or something, and bag a seat next to her.<br>  good luck!|`|3mUaIBffaa	Your chest gets upset?? i've never seen a chest cry before =p Everytime I talk to this one guy, my heart feels thats its gonna leap out of my chest! Is that what your feeling?? Cause if so...thats a good thing! =) Just smile and ask her again trust me she want say no to you. Don't worry =) it'll be ok....thats not a sign your dying! =)|`|lT6WBaWIaa	thats called butterflies. just ask her, hope she says yes. theres nothing you can do about it.|`|2svonkw1aa	just... man up. stop being afraid and just do it. only think about the positive... what happens when you get her...|`|FGMDbhoJaa	I think the best thing to get over being shy is to pretend you are confident and you will be acting confidently for so long it becomes how you are.
yZ7vjv86aa	I don't think it's unreasonable to want to spend time with your new husband, but he can't know this unless you tell him.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like this situation was going on long before you were married.  You and he need to discuss this together and set up some rules for having houseguests.  It sounds like these "friends" are really just freeloaders sponging off your generosity.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	I understand your feelings but really, you chose this life.  This is the way things go.  Years from now you could be alone and yearning for the visits these friends are providing.

Yes, sometime you must risk disapproval but privacy is an important ingredient of a successful marriage. You must tell your husband that you would like to spend some private moments with him.

f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Toxic relationship = where you are the other woman = something I would never do.<br>  <br>  Don't you know that cheaters always have some story about the woman they are with? Either she is a *****, or they are having problems or they *will be getting a divorce* etc. Basically slimeball guys like the one you are involved with will say anything to women of relaxed morals like you to get into their pants.

Hw8P1to3aa	whats the point in having a relationship with someone if your just going to sleep with someone else?  if you really want to sleep around, at least break off the relationship first.  you can't really love the person if you feel you want to sleep with someone else. but i get it - you're at uni, you go out, you get wasted, you want to screw the first person you see.   but going back to the question, no - it's not right to have sex with somebody else just because there's no strings attached and because you think you're never gonna get found out.|`|16vMIGPiaa	A relationship is a choice and each one has a set of agreements both people should agree on.  If the relationship is 'open' and both are on board with that then there's nothing wrong with multiple partners.    What I see here is that you have a particular take on what being in relationship means.  You'd best be sure that your partner is clear about these expectations.    Meanwhile, I encourage you to not judge others by standards you set for yourself.  The same rules do not uniformly apply in all cases.|`|3lVuNfLMaa	No i wouldnt, if people do it shows they are not happy in their current relationship|`|HaJIZFMwaa	NO!!!  i know how it feels to be cheated on.  so why would i wanna do that to someone you are supposed to want to be with or in somecases love.  if you ganna cheat on someone then you might as well end it because to cheat on someone there has to be something wrong with the relationship your already in.  i hate it when people cheat on people!!!       but thats just me i guess :D|`|VnRECJJxaa	i would not! i went to college and know exactly what youre talking about, actually have a male friedn who was with his girl from highschool like 14 years old, now they are marriedm but while he was in college ( i went to the same school as him she went somewhere else) he cheated constantly! i am not friends with her so never felt it was my place to say anything, actually i am married to his best friend, and now they ar ehaving their first child next month, i have no idea what she would do if she found out|`|QIwhMrBraa	i think its a sign that we've become one very sad society that doesnt even value the people we supposedly love or care about right and wrong anymore    if ur gonna exist to just act like an animal and jump on anyone who walks by, then maybe we need less animal activism and more roadkill    no business being in a relationship if ur gonna cheat, end of story
BRXyowHOaa	You could simply tell him that you are not interested in him.  I would probably say something to the extent of "I may be totally confusing signals here but I felt you might be considering me as a romantic possibility and it wouldn't be possible for me to consider more, other than our wonderful friendship" If you do want it to stick I would say something like could not or would not so it's clear.  Saying this does risk a friendship with a man because it's hard to dissociate friendliness from flirting for some men (me included). You could also go a more passive route by simply trying to eliminate things he could mistake for flirting (physical contact, hanging out at places you might take a date) Hope it helps.|`|lX3mM85eaa	just say it to them it doesn't matter if they r a real man they will just move on
dXRrxxrFaa	He can't stop looking at you.<br>  And when your together you just feel that little extra something between you two :]|`|06c2b2bf8d25233ed0327b25ec9921e0aa	C'mon, your a girl, you should be able to tell easily, you women's intuition should be able to read that, you girls are perfect in reading body language, you are able to sense and tell when a guy is desperate for sex, dating, or a relationship.|`|r7LONeiSaa	If he looks at you a lot, smiles at you, talks to you, and tries to get your attention.|`|67115b1163cc8b9c69bf180fdf940ed7aa	he'll spend time with you.<br>  He'll have eye contact with you<br>  he will Talk to u<br>  he'll be really nice to u<br>  flirt with u <br>  :)|`|Dd3sj4n3aa	Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces.|`|ooXzW8Hdaa	Eye contact<br>  Change in behavior or breathing pattern (to see those normally, watch him when he isn't looking)<br>  Abnormal speech patterns (look at the step before to see how you see those normally)<br>  Stalking you or getting away from you (if all the above are true)<br>  Single (Most importantly)<br>  Looks scared when you're around (not HORROR MOVIE scared, Just nervous scared)<br>  CONSTANTLY staring at you (sometimes losing his concentration on everything else around him)<br>  <br>  I should know this stuff, I'm a guy, and i like someone, so i just described myself.|`|Zuj07b5saa	oh honey u will no.<br>  does he look at u a lot?<br>  does he always smile?<br>  is he awkward around u?<br>  does he crack a joke often?<br>  does he follow u around?<br>  do u catch him staring at u?<br>  when u are together does he laugh for no reason?<br>  is he mean to u?<br>  does he tease u?<br>  when he has good news are u the first one he goes to?<br>  hope this helped! :)|`|q9n6qaUxaa	If he looks at you a lot, and he seems interested in you.

No one can be 100% safe in this world, but at the same time, no sense tempting fate either.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	i think that you're just being a good husband.  people are crazy out there these days and i don't think that you should feel bad for not wanting to see your wife on the 6 o'clock news.|`|jCMSybAnaa	It depends on the neighborhood.  If it's notorious, you're being a good husband.  If it's pretty safe, you're being overprotective.  It's better safe than sorry though.  I think it's great you offered to bring her the car at lunch.  This shows her you are thinking of her!  Don't hammer the issue by insisting though if she wants to walk unless it's dangerous.  That will annoy her.|`|7edl5u1oaa	A good husband i would say!

vo7Ws7xtaa	I think being romantic can be a lot of fun between a couple, and can really keep that exciting spark going.  I don't know how long the two of you have been dating, but I don't see anything wrong with breaking out the lingerie if you've already got a sexual relationship going (I wouldn't suggest it if you hadn't slept together yet)   I think your man has the idea that being romantic is about buying flowers everyday and writing poetry, but it isn't necessarily - it's just really about being thoughtful and loving to your partner.  For V-Day, I'd suggest the two of you try a new restaurant (new experiences together gives you that new and exciting buzz) and if you're feeling the vibe once you get home, break out the sexy undies - why not!    Best of luck!|`|KBU2X921aa	The one thing that i feel is kind of bitchy by him is that he brings his past relationship into yours.

0d1ab34e7d8e6be1528a2d3ee4038e39aa	You need to decide if you want to propose privately or publicly.  That will narrow down your places to choose from.  If you decide to propose privately, I'd try to pick a favorite place or a really beautiful private place close enough to where you live.  You could create a romantic setting inside that would be perfect.<br>  <br>  Take a look at the romantic ideas here:<br>  <a href="http://www.sandiego-romantics.com/romantic-ways-to-propose.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sandiego-romantics.com/romant...</a> <br>  One of them will probably appeal to you.|`|AA11678263	I agree with Danielle about asking for her dad's permission if she is on good terms with them, as that shows good manners, and girls are mushy for tradition!  Personally, I'd like to be proposed to somewhere that has sentimental value for me.  My best mate proposed to his girlfriend at the station where he first laid eyes on her, and although that's not a traditionally romantic place, the sentiment is very sweet indeed.  Maybe the first place you saw her, the first date you went on, or the first time you knew you loved her, or just somewhere you've been very happy together.  Get down on one knee and tell her exactly why you want to marry her.  How could she resist?<br>  <br>  It depends what kind of person she is, but you may also want to avoid getting the attention of lost of others.  Personally, I would hate my bf to propose to me on TV, or at a football match or anything like that, but I'm shy.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!! =o)|`|hHndD5SEaa	well for me I think something really romantic would be a proposal somewhere like on a secluded beach - miles away from everyone - with really stunning scenery around....

My husband proposed in our lounge when we were just vegging out for the afternoon and that was perfect for us. Avoid anything too public and showy as a lot of women would find that a turn off and it's too much pressure to say yes.

zfWmQst5aa	You shouldn't rush into sex even though it may seem like everyone else is doing it. I know in today's society sex is taken very lightly but it should be something that you decide to do and have given serious thoughts about. I know it's hard but try and not think about being a virgin...<br>  <br>  and more then anything girls look at a guy's personality. Try to be more confident and if you like a girl, give her looks, smile at her, give her attention so she gets the hint, little things like that can spark a relationship.<br>  <br>  Anyways yea, don't think too much about being a virgin, it's not like you're the only 16 year old in the world that hasn't had sex!|`|b2d574b8a654cff08132b97a7ed59201aa	Don't beat yourself up. There's nothing wrong with being a virgin at age 16 -- if anything, I think it's a good thing because it shows you have standards and are willing to wait for someone special. Be proud and keep looking for that special girl. Don't get laid just to get laid.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you're doing some things right. Keep being fashion-conscious and athletic. Practice talking to people -- any random people, not just girls -- to overcome your shyness. Make friends with more girls. They'll teach you.<br>  <br>  Basically, just work on being a fun, sociable, likable, confident guy, and women will come to you.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	Aww, don't worry, your only 16! You have tons of time!<br>  I'm 20 and i've never dated anyone either. I wouldn't worry too much about it. I know it sounds silly now, but getting  a girl shouldn't be your only concern. Learn to be happy having freedom and being single. <br>  I lost mine at 17, and I must say, I think if I hadn't have done it, I really would have been a different person. It actually gave me a lot more confidence, unlike some people who totally regret it. I DO think I would be miserable now, but of course, thats something I really couldn't know. <br>  You say you've never been asked out by a girl.. Usually, girls don't ask guys out. They wait for the guy to ask them out. Also, it's not like some random girl is going to ask you out, which is what this sounds like. You need to be acquainted with the girl first.. maybe a friend of a friend. Just hang out with girls, and eventually something will develop. <br>  I'm in college and most of my friends are around 22, and to be honest, many of them are still virgins. <br>  <br>  I know it's hard, but just wait it out. I know it seems important now but learn to be happy single. Believe me, your better off being single and happy than in a relationship and unhappy. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|veeC7Rvvaa	Don't worry, your friends probably lyed anyway. you don't have to disclose your sexuality to them! if they insist say you lost it in short term lol.|`|N3fpoUOzaa	dw i have the same problem like same situation,, but dont worry once you get abit older start going out drinking and all that you'll catch up pretty fast :)<br>  <br>  so dont worry about a thing it we'll take its course.<br>  <br>  take care :)|`|voaMM1GQaa	No. Haha<br>  70% of High schoolers lose their virginity before graduation.<br>  Go to more parties.<br>  Or, you could be okay with being the 30% lol :)|`|rQ7dI88Maa	No, you're not going to be a virgin forever. Good for you that you have higher standards.You are not going to be depressed unless you allow yourself 2b. It's okay 2b shy. To overcome shyness, I challenge you to say more than hi to someone and talk about a certain class or something else in common. Your male friends can also help you. I would also like to encourage you to increase your self confidence.|`|ov9bpT3Taa	,  Will you ask any of your friends what they think about this?|`|RuOTJLyvaa	It doesnt sound like your a loser, you'll get laid just give it time.|`|KzDwZfLBaa	You have to turn your shyness into romanticism, i'm sure it'll work!<br>  good luck!|`|HsctHlHhaa	no lol haha your only 16 chill out|`|FPNL7gDaaa	Being a virgin now doesnt make you different you still have a longer days to live and you will find better girls. I am also 16 and also shy. I have nt wooed a girl talkless of collecting a girl's number. So it doesnt make me think i will be a virgin all my life or not.  So a girl will soon come and approch just try to be confidence and approch her. BUT THE MAIN THING IS KEEP YOUR VIRGINITY FOR NOW.|`|W0qFAIVuaa	I didn't read it all,you got a little long winded.Let me tell you this.There is not a man alive that didn't feel this way at some point in his life.Just try to make friends with as many girls as your shy nature will allow and the rest will take care of itself.O and by the way 16 years old and you feel like this.When your twenty you have a reason to be concerned.Good Luck|`|qtlzdtMVaa	OH MY GOD!! Why is everyone worrying about this at such a young age, what's wrong with the world!<br>  <br>  Dude, you have issues stop worrying about "having sex" and dating because you will get to do that when you are 18+. Please please stop worrying and complaining. Who cares if your "friends" have had sex and talk about it (their probably lieing). People older take girls seriously not just to sleep with them, having a girlfriend should be something private between you and your partner, not with you and your friends. Young boys boast about their girlfriends and what they do etc. That's why I always date MEN.<br>  <br>  Oh and seriously dude, your friends probably have AID's...|`|lfUCtkGKaa	You need to start putting youself out there, I know your probably afraid that you might get shot down but hey that's the worse that can happen, and remember to act confident around girls even if your not|`|i8FLbJ4Caa	join the club.|`|KBh6jKCTaa	Oh, bless your heart! First of all people only remain virgins "forever" if they don't want to have sex (priests, nuns, asexuals). So you shouldn't worry about never having sex - even the 40 year old virgin ended up having sex.<br>  <br>  Problem, if you're this worried about never having sex, you probably come off desperate. Girls like confidence. And especially at your young age, girls don't want a guy who's had sex with tons of girls. Your virginity is a definite good thing. No one wants a man whore. Oh and for real, if a girl can tell you just want her for sex (we can always tell), you won't get far. So stop worrying, and be patient. Have a little confidence buddy, and take a deep breath. You WILL have sex one day.|`|d5sAojVmaa	Well don't rush the virginity thing. Some people go out of relationships wishing that they would've just waited for the right person to come along for that. Also, you are kind of shy it seems. You need to find someone that you are interested in and relax take time to know the person and what they like. Maybe go out to a movie. Something maybe that would make you nervous? Well take and make it a group date. Have your friends and their girlfriends come along. It will take the pressure off of the whole one on one situation. For your humor, well everyone is different some women like that humor. Some don't. You can other manage it when your around a woman or you can find someone interested in that humor. I know you haven't dated but any guy should know when what they say is the limit for an individual.|`|fDCRjcR1aa	you should start dating some people weather you like her or not.you need to get used to having girls.if you think you are ugly then try styling up and flirting a little.<br>  join some dating websites get some girlfriends online(be careful with that).or you could just practice being a boyfriend online on chat sites when the girls get horny.<br>  it dosent matter that you are short.dress hip hop style like those cool black people.<br>  get over shyness by reading "How To Get Over Shyness " kinda articles.|`|qkKeBfsJaa	You need to try and relax and not worry about it (yeah if only it was easy eh?). Girls are not idiots and that sort of shyness and insecurity can come across as weirdness. <br>  <br>  Just try to talk to as many girls as you can in just a friendly honest manner. Soon the won't seem all all that daunting.<br>  <br>  And dude, don't worry, you are 16. It WILL happen. At least half of all guys think that at one time or another.
F0NfKljZaa	well i am surrounded by alot of friends to. It is hard, when you like a guy and your other friend likes the same guy. When she is supposed to be your best friend.
dNBXiWGsaa	The problem with good guys is that they like the bad girl types plenty, but they don't know how to act on their feelings.  They always think we would never go out with them because they aren't our type. In the meantime, we end up with jerks.  Your best move is to privately ask him out. It works.|`|UgcPxd4maa	I was a bad girl in the past - my bf is kind of a goodie - I believe that your past makes you who you are today. Give it a shot, it never hurts to try! Good luck!|`|BGTkTNQyaa	You don't sound like a bad "girl" you sound like someone who is walking down the path of life. Maybe you should say that you've matured. If he finds out about any of the crazy things you've done and he holds it against you, you wouldn't have been happy with him, anyway. That being said, some guys like a woman with a crazy outlook/past, and some guys don't. It depends entirely on his personality. SO, give yourself a chance with him, and don't be afraid because of what you've done before. Get to know him...you're worth it! ;)|`|XpKY04Tnaa	Good Guy's love bad girls the same as Good Girls love bad guys. On the other hand we'll not try and change you into 'Good Girls'. But when your past starts catching up to you watch out. We're as good as out of there when the troubles from your past starts. Don't need the hassle and I wasn't going to marry you anyway.|`|4LYasBGXaa	to everyone the word 'bad" is subjective.    by "bad" do you mean getting gang-banged in a bar bathroom by 6 guys and a pool cue?    or    grand theft auto? (the crime not the video game)    or    shooting bottle rockets at your neighbor's dog?    or    stealing cookies from the cabinet and not "telling mommy"?      whats bad?    basically a guy might or might not like a bad girl- or he might want a "slutty bad" girl to get his rocks off- or he might not want to deal with you at all- it all depends what you have done and what is reflected in your attitude. Also is is something that is apparant as part of your personality- like bieng a "psyco bad" girl. did you burn down your boyfriends house because you saw him with another girl that turned out to be his sister? (or even another girl- arson is beyond extreme)    do you wear and act like a "tough girl?".    carry a knife and pretend you can use it or can you actually use it?      if you don't 'broadcast" it- odds are he will never find out about it.|`|rcArdzhdaa	maybe if they complement each other other

You knew that you all were wrong, so accept that & apologize to your friend.

Would you want those things said about you?  You should have stood up to them and told them they were wrong for saying those things.  She does have a right to know her other friends were doing the same thing, and you should tell her, but understand she might not ever trust you or want to be friends with you again.  Take a lesson from this and be a true friend from now on.  You were definitely wrong.  All you can do now (besides apologize) is try to do the right thing from now on.  Take responsibility for what you did wrong, let her know you regret it, then never do it to anyone again.

If my 29 year old child was living under my roof (clue  1) and I told them that they had to be in before the next morning (my rules) then she had better call to let me know she wouldn't be in.  I'm not asking for an explanation just courtesy.  Now if that same 29 year old were living in my house yet paying a full rent, then it's like living on her own and I would not expect her to call.  so to answer the question, does it make sense, depends on the relationship and living arrangements.|`|WV36m31Zaa	yes,,,|`|SivOCxSAaa	no shes probably getting intimate|`|yuDh1Ow2aa	if you are still living at home, then yes  but if you are on your own...then no  your mom should trust you enough to make the right desicions   if you are still at home, then find a way to move out if possible so you dont have to check up with your mom everytime you want to do somthing  "i dont care if you are 45 and STILL livin in my house, you WILL CALL..."  -lecture from MY MOM  good luk  kp

I did get caught in some kind of triangle once a few years ago, but I didn't really like either of them.|`|Un9CElCaaa	yes i did this with 3 girls when i was young and stupid. i was living with one of them but going out after work to meet one of the two other girls. i was trying to make my decision on who i really wanted to be with. one of them was incredible. the one i really liked found out about one of the other girls because they worked together and she ended things with me. i was really upset. i broke up with the girl i was living with and moved out and then i dated the other girl from my job for the next 7 years. she cheated on me so i guess i got what i deserved. i will never play another girl again.|`|9fEeteY0aa	Look, this is gonna make me look like scum. But whatever. This is a phase I'm past now, with a serious girlfriend who I've been together with for a year. Anyway...*sigh*...<br>  <br>  At the time, every girl I was with I deeply believed was easily replaceable, since all it took was a few slick words and the right touch and attitude to get a new one. From the South Beach clubs to the downtown Miami bars, I bounced from girl to girl all over this city.<br>  <br>  Then a girl tried to kill herself because of what I'd done. After talking her down from that, I just couldn't do it anymore. Sent the other two I was "seeing" at the time messages about how I was done, didn't feel like it, etc. (figured it'd be easier to hate me than grieve me), and put it all behind me.<br>  <br>  So here I am, happy and monogamous.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, at the time, no. But I dunno your situation.

AA11706291	Not sure what answer you are looking for, as it sounds like you are pretty much sorted. The money should either go to your children or to a new car for you. The van is in his name and no doubt he will use the money from the sale for his own means (as you pointed out he wants a truck that badly he should use the money from the sale of the van as the truck will be his too)<br>  <br>  On a different note you guys need to sort this issue out with his kids as it's becoming between you, surely he knows how his kids feel about you and your children and he should be telling them to deal with it. If he wasn't willing to deal with this issue with his kids then why did he marry you?! You don't marry someone then make them feel insecure when their child tells an obvious lie... Unless you make a habit of planting knifes on children, perhaps you are in fact completely bonkers and your husband has yet to realise he has in fact married a mad woman.|`|85aWKsptaa	the money should be for your kids. Divorce him|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	Your husband is a control freak and seems like he is keeping ALL his important financial gains AWAY from you. If you're married and he wants to be IN ALL YOUR BUSINESS, you should be in HIS BUSINESS TOO.<br>  <br>  Tell your husband that if he really wants THE ACCOUNT TO BE "OURS," that you REALLY WANT TO BE ON THE LOAN FOR "OUR VAN," "OUR HOUSE," AND PUT ON HIS LIFE INSURANCE AS HIS BENEFICIARY... not his ex or his mother.<br>  <br>  Right now, your husband has TWO families, his family and you and your kids. He is keeping ALL his money in his family so that HIS KIDS will get his money. He knows that with his EX and Mother on his life insurance and with only HIS NAME on the car and house, YOU WILL GET NOTHING IF YOU DIVORCE OR HE DIES.<br>  <br>  Your husband is making it, so he provides for HIS KIDS and HIS MOTHER in the future, if he dies. While he is doing NOTHING to secure YOUR future, in case he dies. Its obvious to me that he isn't in your marriage 100%.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Why are you still with him? It is obvious it is not working out.

In addition to providing information on MS and related issues, they provide referral services and connect people with MS and their caregivers to vital community support resources. Depending on the community, people with MS may have access to a wide range of programs and services such as exercise classes, transportation assistance, homecare and many others.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no charge to obtain information or referral services.    You might find some helpful information on this website....  http://www.msif.org/en/|`|0F3u5RpTaa	HI, I also have MS.  Yes it is scarry.

A Social Worker, GP, other health professional, the Citizens Advice Bureau, any local disability groups, they will all have someone who can help with the forms.  The best way to get the benefit sorted with speed is to be as honest as possible, most people want to play down their difficulties.  IF by any chance there is a problem, your gf needs to appeal as quickly as possible. With a diagnosis already there, it should be straightforward  If your gf has problems in her daily life, she ask for a SW assessment.  Good luck and it is good that she has your support

e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	Your husband is unreasonable.  You were not "dating" him - you had not even met him yet.  You are not a slut.  You are lucky that this kind of controlling man wants out of your life.   Are you American with an American Heritage?  Because honey, it sounds like you are excepting this kind of awful abuse from a middle eastern type man.  Don't take that crap.  Be glad he is gone - so stop crying, and start working on your dreams.|`|VFEjLgvuaa	First let me start off by saying Im sorry youre going through this rough time. Second I dont really think you can consider yourselves as dating when youve never even met therefore it couldnt be considered cheating on him either but if thats the way he feels you cant change it but, if he really loves you and wants to be with you then he will want to talk things out after he gets over the initial pain and anger. I hope things work out for you guys good luck and best wishes on repairing your marriage|`|uI4Dspi4aa	Waaaay toooo much to read.|`|OBCvewW2aa	If I were you I'd be happier than a pig in mud.

Let him find a nice saintly girl who can entertain him with her amazing ability to memorize cereal boxes and let her be the one to soothe his badly damaged self esteem.  Seriously, this guy's elevator don't go all the way up- he's likely to have a mental breakdown if your shoulder brushes up against a person of the opposite sex.|`|QP1ZQqPfaa	I am sorry you are going through this.  I don't think you should feel like a Hoe, slut or any other ugly name. Don't ever let someone else but you down.  At the time you thought it was all good and in your mind you where not dating.  Another thing a slut or a hoe is someone (well to me) that is sleeping around with more then one guy.  That sleeps with her boyfriend and with another guy or a few guys the same night or week. So your not a slut.  The guy you slept with was a friend and well really you didn't even really know your husband at the time.      The truth well yes you hurt his feelings but do you know everything he was doing while you where "dating"?  For all you know he had another girlfriend.  I know he is your husband now but we all keep secrets that we keep till we die.  Yes you where also young and i understand. I have been with my husband since i was 15 now am 22 with two kids and I don't do anything but be a wonderful house wife.  I haven't gone to a club like in 2 years and I've only gone in my life time like 10 times tops.     If he love you he will get over it, he will ask his friend or family what they think and well maybe they will tell him he was wrong to take it over board.  I wish he comes back and that your letter works.    We all go through hard times it's a test of your relationship strength.  I hope it is strong.  And by the way i don't think anyone can ruin anyones future when they choose there own path no one forced anyone.  So just pick up your head God know what He wants for you.

You still acting immature and now realise it when it a bit too late. Sorry if I didn't answer properly..becuase I try to read it fast and may be I have drop something else. Now only the truth can safe you free. (Lucky you don't have kid yet)|`|i15KoiJhaa	You made a mistake.    Period.    You stated that you were "Online Dating" your Husband at the time of this "indiscretion" with Brandon... you and your Husband had NOT even met one another when this event had happened...    So in my mind unless you had somehow lead your Husband to believe you were in an exclusive relationship (which again, would have been ridiculous because the 2 of you had NEVER actually met in person or spent any time together) then your Husband has zero reason to believe that you cheated on him.    I do believe you are BOTH really jumping the gun here... this only happened last night and today you are packing and ready to give up.     I really believe you need to give your Husband some time to really think about things hun. I'm sure he feels hurt and his ego has been damaged but this doesn't mean that he will never get over things or forgive or even see it for what it really was.    Before you start moving your things out, really think about this okay?  It isn't always better to be "right" sometimes it is better to be with the person you love the most in the world.     Can't bail every time you hit a rough patch honey because there will be more to come... it is going to be in the way the BOTH of you CHOOSE to work through these things that will make the difference.

Or if she knows when your birthday is and its no where near now then tell her its your mothers birthday or your cousins birthday and you want her to come over and be there. have her come over and When she realizes that its just you and her she will see the cake.

lvOR401haa	You're not ready to be with someone new yet honey if you feel this way.<br>  <br>  But you also have to try and figure out whether you're in love with him, or the idea of him?<br>  <br>  Two years is a long time, and it seems you have not spoken to him much recently if he didn't recognise you.<br>  <br>  If he did, then he wanted to either let you get on with your meal with your date, or wanted to avoid talking to you.<br>  <br>  I'd say take time out to figure it out and go from there.  It's not fair to lead the new bf on if you're not ready to be with him 100%, but at the same time, don't let the ghosts from the past cloud your life.<br>  <br>  Don't let the past ruin the future - and if your ex was going to be part of the future, he probably would have at least acknowledged you.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds harsh, but sometimes these things give us the jolt we need to move on and let it be in the past.<br>  <br>  Whatever happens, good luck.  It's awful to be in this spot :-(

gUdlaaGwaa	You must talk to your b/f about this. Tell him you heard rumours (don't say from where) about him cheating. He could be acting like the 'big man' by bragging around work. However, you must confront the problem otherwise it will do your head in. I'm surprised he's being so blase about boasting in front of Larry and this could mean two things.<br>  1. He's just talking nonsense<br>  2. He's so full of it he doesn't believe Larry will say anything.<br>  <br>  I hope it works out for you.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Don't move in.

Think of a guy you know who is NOT a cheater.  A good, well-mannered, loving guy in a good relationship.  Would there EVER, ever be rumors about him?  If a rumor were started, would anyone believe it?  Would you even question it?  Of course not.<br>  <br>  If there is room for doubt about your guy, you are in a bad situation.  I can't believe you're even asking this question!  HEALTHY relationships do NOT have any of this drama.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	You should move out and consider leaving your boyfriend.  When you do this hopefully Larry will stay away but I doubt it since it sounds as though he's trying to sabotage your relationship.  Have some self respect and live on your own until you are ready for marriage since it's obviously undermining your relationships.|`|2add0927fd432feba092329128fecbcdaa	Think of this logically. where and how in the world could a man be INCAPABLE of cheating. Never in history honey. they are always capable cause theres always some skank out there. its only if they systematically decide not to cheat.<br>  <br>  Now think of this as logically as possible. Larry is only trying to help. Larry has inside tips and broke the bro code to give you a heads up. this guy deserves an applause and a gift  basket. Do not ever mention who you got the information from.. instead get one of the girls names from Larry and say that you talked to her and she confirmed that you were messing with her. then lets see how he acts.<br>  <br>  NOW that you know he is a cheater you have to make your decision. Are you willing to live a life full of cheating and heart break of are you gonna drop it now. its totally up to you like it was up to him honey... make the right decision.|`|Q49EEdzbaa	Okay sounds like to me that Larry wants you for himself becuz why would he feel free to tell you something so personal. Your boyfriend probabally brags about you and makes him jealous to the point where he wants you for hisself to see what its like. Not saying thats what it is but that is how some men are they dont care they say anything to get what they want and doesnt matter who gets hurt. Now it is possible that Larry have something to blackmale your boyfriend for. Use your instincts; but dont let what one person say be the end. If he was cheating i dont think he would have made a decision to move in with you if he didnt want to be wih you...stop wasting your life worrying about what you think a MAN might be doing. If he's goin to do something he is going to do it. Just love yourself, TIME will tell everything. Trust what your man is telling you is true, and the truth will set free trust me yu wont regret it........good luck|`|zGlvU08Zaa	Hey i feel for you, what an awkward situation you are in. I meen why would your boyfriend brag to someone he knows is your friend so he would obviously tell you what hes been saying! Do you think you friend might be into you? Or does he just think this guy isnt good enough for you? You should keep a close eye on your fella, if he is cheating he'll trip up sooner or later! I was in a bad situation where my husband said my sister came on to him, but my sister still denies it to this day. I will always believe my husband, my sister is a bit of a flirt so she probably did come to him but didnt even realise as its just the way she is!
qIgzwUp9aa	I think she is very lucky :) you obviously like her a lot and she'll appreciate the sentiment that the card was, <br>  but you need to tell her that you like her before you get too far into the "just mates" category.<br>  good luck!|`|bJFJ1l6daa	LOL the fact is you gave the girl a card, and thats already a nice gesture.She probably doesnt even care whats in it because just the fact that you got her a card and remembered her birthday is special.|`|aR2hMZa7aa	I think you made the right choice and that she really appreciated it.  She knows you thinking of her.|`|DWFMM23Caa	oh my, you are soooo cute, that was a lovely gesture.  she is obviously happy with it.  leave it a few days, ... then you could ask her would she like to do something with you as a treat for her bday, like you could bring her to the movies or coffee? if you suggested it as her bday gift and she accepts that is the first step over, you can see from there how you get on and then suggest perhaps a 2nd "date"... let me know how it goes!|`|eVK2zZsOaa	You should have given her the other card but since you didn't that fact that it is her birthday is a huge opportunity for you. If you aren't nervous...you can go and strike up conversation and ask her if she has plans for her birthday. If she says no and you are bold enough..you can ask her if you could take her out for dinner and a movie (or just dinner so that you can talk to her). If you want to express how you feel be bold, women like men who take initiative and who aren't afraid to go for what they want. And the statement you place in the card was really sweet, I think that was a nice touch. Just don't think about it.... go for it. Good luck to you!!|`|hHndD5SEaa	you didnt miss the opportunity at all - you extended a gesture which she obviously appreciated!<br>  xx
GcTNNrRSaa	I think you should, because she might not even know that your that into her, or she might be shy. Be more flirty and ask her to hang out sometime. If she says yes, thats a good sign, maybe ask her for her number. If she says she busy or shes not interested, at least you tried, then just hold your head up high and when she sees you being fine with it, she might start becoming interested.|`|1MxDaH11aa	i think you should go for it. its gonna hurt if she tells you know but its better for her to let you know then be wondering what if...? so just do it.<br>  good luck!|`|TilqqjNMaa	Stop beating around the bush and ask her out already!|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	step up your game, right now its lame

All four of those deadbeats can be prosecuted and should be. they have no morals for sleeping with a 15 year old girl. They are sick-minded individuals.<br>  <br>  At 15 you really need to talk to a trusted adult..and do you really want a baby that you cant take care of, or push the responsibility onto your parents? And what job do you think youll get at 15 to take care of ALL that i needed to raise a child on your own.<br>  <br>  Sex at 15=baby=messed up life|`|AA10358220	love & respect yourself and they should back!!period!!;)|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well, you were moving to fast. Most guys that old know that teens are naive so they are able to get through your mind. If you are sad by it, then report them for Statutory Rape. Although you are okay with it, but in some states, it is illegal altogether. You let them take control of you so that is how they took advantage of you.|`|Uj5kuzoJaa	Stop having sex with guys and make them take you on a date every once in awhile. If they're already getting what they want, why would they do anything else? Try not having sex with a guy until you've dated for awhile. Make a connection with a guy other than while you're in the bedroom.|`|a0Vg5vMyaa	wwwwoooowww..umm the r eason being is because ur a child for them nd they have no other interest in u because they cud go to jail..they wudnt wanna fall for a 15 yr old come on now..u shud use ur senses...y wud older men like that wana be commited to a 15 yr old..find a gud guy around YOUR age and see if it works out..nd take things slo....=]...hope u find the rite one..someday.,|`|PCrh5bOMaa	15???? what you doing having sex? all those guys you slept with could be charged in the UK.

8ff68124c118183235586b4138170059aa	He doesn't want you back,it was only sex.Whatever you did to hurt him is bad enough that he can't see past it,when he can forgive you,then he will want you back.|`|2x41IPGcaa	he is using u. tell him you are in a meaninful relationship and see what his reaction is|`|5hlJwDBoaa	i had sex wit my ex he told me he loved me and he lied again so it means nothing|`|nTU85LLJaa	I guess he is still feeling injured yet gets some comfort by being with you. Give it some time , and he will come along. If he never seems to forgive after you no longer hurt his feelings then he is not a human _ run for it!|`|ed25e3241d18e15b57724f2aebccd9b3aa	because he wants a piece of *** and he knows you are there and its comfortable and easy. dont get your hopes up or you will get your heart broken....again|`|tnF0zxgqaa	he doesnt want to forgive u but he still loves u|`|P0MDLv6naa	sometimes a relationship is a hard habit to break. Its easy to slip back into the old habits - joking around the way you used to, and sleeping together the way you used to.<br>  <br>  He probably still has feelings for you the way you obviously do for him but there's lots of bad feeling between you and sometimes love isnt enough to get past that.|`|ePn6is5Taa	I would sit down and ask him what he wants to do, if he wants to be with you, then why? If not, then why? and If not, what could you do to put it right so that you can be together?|`|FeguWBvBaa	yes he does if he kisses you and eats lunch W/you then he still loves you he will come around just wait about a week!!!<br>     your welcome|`|bpGTFpjOaa	because he wants some ***, and he is taking advantage of the fact that you still love him.|`|6CEDkaQvaa	To fulfill his needs with you while he finds somebody better|`|lPXscuKSaa	Wake up, It means that you both felt horny at that time.|`|0Ikc9jbTaa	men like ' familiar '....he is using you for sex.......don't fall for it!

PNnYTqyzaa	I was in the exact same situation as this a few years back. I was terrified but also felt excited and happy...I'm guessing this is what you're going through now?<br>  <br>  Well, I will start off by suggesting confidence (like everyone else) but I know it's harder than it seems. TRY and feel confident but feeling COMFORTABLE around him is the key. Talk to him over MSN and text and email and ring him more. Get to know him, think of some stuff to talk about when you meet (e.g. music, hobbies, sport, school etc.) and there should be no problem.<br>  <br>  If he's sweet and considerate of your feelings then talk to him about it and tell him how you feel. He shouldn't be freaked out, he'll probably find it sweet and/or cute! If you're open with your feelings then, chances are, you'll have a better time with him and be more relaxed.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!<br>  <br>  xxx|`|BaNrweQ4aa	he obviously asked you out because he likes you for you. just carry on being yourself; but you need to be a bit more confident - so you can show the same amount of love and affection to him :) try and talk about your interests and then you won't ever be stuck with things to say. taking a general interest if your boyfriend will make him feel good about himself, as he will start to trust you and be able to talk to you about anything. there won't be awkward silences and things like that :) even just.. texting him first or saying 'i love you' at random times shows you are being affection; and it's a sign of confidence too. it's natural to be shy around the guy you like - just be yourself and act cool. be you :D|`|aD8Xmhdiaa	just calm down and be yourself. he likes you for that.<br>  <br>  you'll start to feel more comfortable in a few days probably.|`|edfyA9kPaa	OMG i know how u feel when my bf asked me out i freaked out and i was like I DONT WANNA SEE HIM and they were like hes ur boyfriend you have to and i started freaking out more so i just told him he made me really nervous and then he thought it was cute and we've been going out for 3 months now and im not nervous around him anymore i can relax and be myself around him its great. You just needa get used to it it'll take a few weeks or even 2 months.|`|sV4knlUfaa	Just go with the flow, there is nothing to be afraid of and he is probably just as nervous as you. Enjoy|`|JsfSS1o8aa	you will soon get over that just enjoy your self|`|YCQCxrkuaa	Go with the flow with him. Try to talk to him more. Be ur self and try to ask him out some where. Be more confident to talk to him and that should help ur shyness. You might be more shy cuz he's ur first but once u get over it then u will feel better. Hold his hand . hope it helps. x :)|`|1qRJt9blaa	hi im brasilian ;D <br>  hey girrrl dont be shy<br>  why you d be shy?<br>  you just have to try some friendly with him<br>  you have be her friend to be more confidient ;D<br>  kiss and good luck|`|900c79d3b0d2f128c2a0a222200c9d73aa	Be yourself.<br>  Don't try and be anything/anyone else.<br>  He obviously like you for who you are.|`|lPXscuKSaa	Your making me scared as well.|`|IeHd8IU8aa	relax and enjoy being spoilt hope it goes well xx
IPS3hWweaa	"Hey sugar! What are you doing tonight? Want to hang out and get something to eat?"|`|135b47dd06c37bc042aa0969ad35cb25aa	Well, I probably wouldn't be asking out a girl. Haha buut if for some reason I was, I'd probably just say "Will you go out with me?" Then you would say yes..That's how it goes. Haha have a  goood day! :)|`|NrbLdZzOaa	I'd walk up to you, grab your a*s and ask what you were doing tonight.

Sorry.|`|5aXKo6uCaa	hey want to go out?|`|b513111aa3d16b8c4e5fd1ed4f27c4b0aa	I would slowly walk up to you.  I would silently look deep into your eyes.

Then it would be on.|`|W0qFAIVuaa	"Would you have dinner with me some nite"|`|B83DTe78aa	i don't swing that way.
S4VVE0onaa	anything you want! its that simple talk to him like him like you do with your friends|`|utGddhnVaa	don't talk just sex|`|ml2FDYECaa	It's common. Don't worry. Talk about what's on your mind. Talk about something that happened to you. A dilemma you are having about something. Are you into movies? Talk about that. Does he like sports? If he does do some research, and talk about that. Even better, if he starts talking about something be a good listener, and talk about that. That is the most important thing...be a good listener, and you are on the right track to be a good communicator...GL|`|ijSqvq50aa	i felt the same way about my boyfriend,<br>  the best way to talk to him is to start a simple conversation about how his day was ect. and just let it go from there.<br>  that's what helped me most.<br>  hope it helps you too!
f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	clingy:  you always agree with the other person, you never have your own opinions, you only want to do what they want to do, you don't spend time with your own friends, you take up all of the other person's time and you pout, cry and whine when they want to do something without you.<br>  <br>  don't do any clingy stuff.  Live your own life as you see fit.  Your partner DOES NOT complete you.  they enhance and enrich you, but you must be a whole person on your own.|`|DcUoZntOaa	act like you can get by on your own. and give space to others.<br>  peace!|`|XUrgcOMDaa	It takes two individuals to date, to form a relationship.  Although once dating, it is important to "be a couple"... it is also important to remain individuals, to live the life you had before you started dating (pursue your own interests, have time for yourself, hang out with friends, etc.) and not permanently meld into "the couple".<br>  <br>  A clingy person is someone who forgets to be an individual, and who forgets their partner wants to remain an individual as well.|`|AMTYPir7aa	clingy is when you are constantly wanting to be around your partner and not doing much without them like hanging out with your friends and when you are out with your partner you don't mingle with others you are stuck to him like glue. that's about it. if you don't want to be clingy then take a night off and just be with yourself or with your friends without your boyfriend. when you go out with him mingle a little without him if you are at a party or somewhere you know other people.|`|AA11448061	Clingy is like where someone is ALWAYS by your side following you around won't go do their own thing.  Always wants to be around you won't go and do their own things either by themselves or with someone else.  <br>  <br>  Don't hang all over someone like that go do your own thing and give the person your clingy to some space.|`|7vBJGMvtaa	Being Clingy means you don't have a life of your own without that other person to the point of being annoying! get a hobby or find things to do without your better half!|`|iYdyFW3Uaa	Clingy is not so much actions but the result of an emotional state. If you feel that you can't live without the person and the other doesn't quite feel the same way your actions might come off as clingy.<br>  <br>  Examples of standard clingyness:<br>  1 calling just to say "hi, I love you" if the other person has heard it five time already for you are doesn't feel this is relevant this may seem clingy<br>  2 Not being able to go and do things without your significant other (You need to have a life somewhat separate)<br>  3 Getting upset when they do anything together (yes you two should do things together but a boy's/girl's night out can be a very good thing)<br>  4 being apologetic about everything<br>  <br>  There are other things but it is something you learn best by being clung to or being clingy.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Well there is a fine line between clingy and affectionate. So I will give you some examples from my life. I am going to assume it is a guy we are talking about the advice goes both ways though<br>  <br>  I want to go out with my bros for our annual boar hunt (I do it and this is not a hunting debate. You want to talk to me email me) <br>  Clingy girl says don't go and gets mad<br>  Affectionate Asks me not to go but then says have fun and be careful<br>  (AKA worried about me)<br>  <br>  I talk with an old female friend (non girlfriend) from high school  <br>  Clingy girl gets jealous and gets mad<br>  Affectionate girl introduces herself and hangs with us<br>  <br>  How not to be clingy realize that your boyfriend is still an individual and might want to do something with out you. That he is not out to cheat on you with every girl he meets. Just trust your guy if he cheats find another one.|`|ZDC81VjZaa	To appear insecure<br>  <br>  To not give someone any space<br>  <br>  To appear needy<br>  <br>  To smother someone<br>  <br>  To not be able to be without the other for longer than a few minutes with out calling<br>  <br>  To always be where the other is... right NEXT to that person as if glued together<br>  <br>  To have to know what the other is doing every single second the other is absent...<br>  <br>     There is so much more that makes a person clingy.  Just watch a small child (under 2) around his/her parents.  Most are rather clingy.  They need that parent to make them feel safe and secure.  How is that different than when an adult does it?  Except that it's not our parents we opt to cling to... rather, some other being of the opposite sex (or same sex for some).  Do you follow?<br>  <br>     How NOT to be clingy?  Be confident enough in yourself that you can do some things without the other and at the end of the night for having done so... you'll both have something new to share with the other.  Spend time apart and the heart grows fonder... allow him to have his "guy nights" and while he's out with the guys, invite the girls over for a "girls night".  No man bashing though.  Instead, think about how you'd come to meet and share those kinds of stories.  Keep the mood fun.  Be yourself.  Accept that it's okay to have time apart and that clingy crap will go right out the window.|`|50dfad07d8ee2b10b7bb6c48c0f62037aa	I have been known to cling in relationships.<br>  <br>  Examples would be:<br>  Needing to express love every second, constant hugging and kissing, devoting all your time and attention on them, needing to always be with them.<br>  <br>  Basically cling means loving/smothering them to death.<br>  <br>  Some people like it (me), some don't.<br>  <br>  For those that don't, they just need space and alone time.|`|vPbM2F13aa	Clingy:<br>  calling every hour to check to see if he/she is out with someone you don't know<br>  wanting to meet all his friends to see if any of them might be competition for you<br>  taking away his time when he is obviouslly busy and doesnt welcome distraction etc...|`|Wpulf29Maa	Clingy means to remain close; resist separation.<br>  <br>  To not be clingy:<br>  1) Be unselfish<br>  2) respectful<br>  3) confident<br>  4) unattached<br>  5) spacious|`|5hlJwDBoaa	clingy is wanting to be with or talk to someone all the time im only that way when i dont trust someone but its better to not be wit someone you dont trust.|`|AA10764251	Clingy is when someone wont leave your side like a little lost puppy. they are always by you holding you, tounching you etc.|`|tcvQwTa5aa	Clingy is when you don't allow the person you're with the room to breathe in your absence.Or when you can't live without this person for more than an hour.People need time alone and privacy and so forth.Someone who is clingy only "suffocates" the other person and makes them want to stay away.Find things to do that you really like,like some sort of hobby or something.Get your mind off of the other person long enough to live and enjoy your own life and develop your talents and what not.Don't call them every hour or expect them to want to be around you 24/7.Even people who are madly in love need time apart.Also,allow people to make their own choices and be who they are without reprimanding them for not wanting your constant attention.I mean no offense by any of this,just trying to help.Maybe you are clingy because you fear to be alone?Try to find peace while you're alone in your own company sometimes.If you don't smother people they will be more willing to hang around you.Good luck.|`|9aBKmhbZaa	clingy is when your always there and your like a bothersome and it is just annoying when a person is following you everywhere and you have no space at all.. to stop be clingy you just have to understand that the person you are clinging too does need space and you don't have to be there every time they do something.... just don't over step your boundary... don't burst their bubble...|`|8KuYeHUuaa	It's when you give too much time and attention to your significant other.  Everyone needs their alone time every now and then.<br>  <br>  The best way to avoid this is to actually hang out with your fiends for a whole day without calling all the time, texting, emailing, etc...<br>  <br>  Or even hang out with each other with friends.|`|19pRLtvDaa	if you aren't in person, you constantly want to be on the phone/texting your guy/girl... that's being clingy.<br>  <br>  you hold on to him/her every second that you are together... that's clingy.<br>  <br>  you want to be with them 24/7 and never give them any space... that's clingy.<br>  <br>  hope it helps. :)|`|tZkHHy5jaa	Clingy can be good.

And some guys need to feel like their still wanted by other women even when their in a relationship.  I would just call him up and say the other night I was bummed because she was on you and I wanted to be.  Let's hang out just us tonight.  If he gets mad, then he's not the kind of guy you want to be with anyway.|`|VFdC2wPlaa	You should text him saying your sorry for not being social last night, but it was hard for you to watch him flirt with someone else. He will probably get mad and it will start a fight, but at least it will all be out in the open. This way you can fix it and move on.|`|c2uywBsIaa	I would just tell him that you felt disrespected and like he wasn't really caring how you felt.<br>  Bottom Line, that was rude of her and he was an *ss for playing into it.|`|tPRRUs4Jaa	you need to let him know that his behavior in reply to that girls behavior was not okay. he needs to know that you will not accept or tolerate it. i'm not exactly sure what he did but if you're saying that your uncomfortable with it, then that's enough to know that he shouldn't ever do it again and he definitely shouldn't continue it. <br>  i understand that you don't want to start a fight, but you may need to to get your point across. <br>  text him saying that you were definitely not comfortable with the way he acted last night and you didn't have a good time at all.<br>  just be honest, communicate with him. that's the only way to have a good relationship--communication & honesty. those are two key things to build a good foundation for your relationship with him.<br>  good luck!|`|rbloxE6paa	well you have 2 issues here - the girl and him inviting his friends over. if it were me, I'd forget about him because he let her be all over him whilst ignoring you. you really want to be with someone who does that??<br>  let him text you first. hard, but worth it. believe me.|`|IP4ym3Ynaa	hmm.. i think you shouldnt confront him and be angry. just start the conversation asking if he had fun that night. then tell him how you feel|`|Nc7clhzIaa	I would wait for him to contact me first, since he was obviously flirtying or trying to make you jealous of some sort.  Texting is not always the best option for conversation esp. when you need to hear how someone is saying something & if they are truly being sincere.  When he calls you just see what he has to say first & let him know that you felt ignored but don't point out anything as if saying " You were doing this, or You were doing that & I didn't like it"... A better approach would be, " I feel as though... "  It is better to state your feelings towards the topic rather than make them feel like you are accusing them.  You should get a better/more honest response that way.  It's all about psychology.  Good Luck!

You might just ask him if he wants to study together in the library, or something simple along those lines.<br>  <br>  Girls tend to flock toward the nice guys for friends.  I'm a nice guy, and I tend to make friends with women more readily than with other guys.  Out of the friends I have, I've picked one to build a relationship with and the others are just friends.<br>  <br>  But it's been long enough that it appears you'll have to get the ball rolling on this one.  It could be studying, or asking if he's going to the basketball game, or anything.  You should be able to tell in no time if he's into you or not.|`|bp6ud1AHaa	you should just tell him u like him or write it in a lil not and then give it to him if your to shy =]<br>  or tell one of his friends or somethin or maybe just start kinda fliting wit him =]<br>  goodluck|`|JwDhOMRqaa	Play on it for a while, dont act interested and when hes trying to get your attention ignore it. <br>  Get one of your friends to ask him as like a joke, which will make him think about it more. <br>  But dont get upset, hes only a boy and they arent worth your tears. <br>  But dont give him the statifaction of knowing that you like him, because he'll use it to make you jealous, just act normal, and flirt with his friends, ignore him and talk to them. <br>  Good luck, and im sure if its meant to be it will, just give it time.|`|fuQH62V1aa	have your friend ask one of his friends.<br>  <br>  then kill the other "competition".. making sure you dont leave any prints or evidence.<br>  <br>  then.. make your move;)|`|IWO1GTpGaa	Wow you are becoming very emotional over a guy you yet to know if he likes you back or not.  All you need to do is once you get him to walk in the hall with you put your hands around his shoulder and look at him.  Keep walking and doing those of course, and when you build up the confidence say to him, "you want me don't you?" smile, let him go and walk off.  If he later on addresses what you said then you've hooked you a liker.
6K4YX6ulaa	Not at all....if you are old enough and not attending college move with him or close to him...i think that you should go out with him!!|`|b8Mfl9UZaa	I know people with long distance relationships, one goes to Florida from PA almost every weekend to see her guy. That's crazy. They work out most of the time but long distance is a tough thing because then you don't see them often and that can lead to fights and break ups. Really it depends on the individuals getting into the relationship- can you handle being apart from each other for long periods of time? Or are you one of those people who likes to see your significant other almost every day? If you're the latter you shouldn't do it, if you're the former then go for it! It takes a lot of trust and understanding on both parts. Depends on which type you are.|`|bRkhq7Rhaa	why  not, don't miss out on a good chance.  i know a couple of long distance relationships, when they meet up and make an effort to see each other that shows more of how committed they are to each other.  this can also give both of you space when you need it.|`|nfQhsRvfaa	Girl I know from experience sometimes long distance relationships are the best! It's hard being away from each other but when you ARE together it's amazing and you're sooo happy!! It makes you appreciate each other waaay more and you don't fight about stupid little things cuz you always miss each other. Just make sure and check him all out before you committ. Make sure everything he tells you is the truth since you aren't able to see for yourself all the time. Get to know his friends and family and see what they're like. If he's around them all the time I can almost promise he'll be similar to them. If everything checks out goo then go for it! Love knows no boundaries! :)|`|2sMYk9H7aa	Long distance relationships take a lot of work on both people's parts. Sometimes one person puts in more effort and the other doesn't do much at all.

Friends possibly but not likely. If he do likes you as a gf, then he may just have a shy personality about that stuff. Probably, He's getting the right moment to say it. I advise to give him a more revealing clue. Verbally and a little bit physical if you don't mind. That will put his mind at ease in asking you. There are guys with that type you know. Like me as well sometimes|`|37c233fdcf66a7d0f3a3f1d9528d7a4caa	Perhaps he already considers you his girlfriend?<br>  <br>  In my opinion, that's a question that is rarely, if never, asked. If you both share feelings for each other, then you'd know, right? :)<br>  <br>  But if you do feel a bit insecure about it, it doesn't hurt to ask!|`|BoPe4Svfaa	he could be nervous, or he could be trying to make it slow cause he's had problems in the past. their are many things that could cause him to hold off.<br>  <br>  opinions from family/friends. get to ACTUALLY know you, not just think he knows you. all that good stuff.|`|t5N9QQntaa	maybe he wants to be sure, so give him a little more time " all in good time" it will  happen especially since you met his parents already that usually happens when you are a couple.|`|ml2FDYECaa	How old are you???? If you are in junior high then your question is understandable. Don't worry, you two are an item already. If you are in high school then you ask him to be your BF. If you are over the age of 18, and you've met eachother's parents then you he is getting ready to propose. Life is good...don't worry to much about it. Just enjoy your time with him. GL|`|0q5Z5zxIaa	the fact that you're "dating exclusively" suggests that you already are boyfriend and girlfriend.. but he may just be nervous about asking you, especially if you are young.. if he doesn't ask you to be his girlfriend soon, what's wrong with you asking him to be your boyfriend?<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)
52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	Possible?  Yes.  <br>  Likely?  Maybe.<br>  Common?  Enough so that the human race has continued over thousands of years.<br>  <br>  What you are describing is the OLDEST form of birth control in the world, withdraw.  It is effective, but lets face it, it isn't fool proof.  Instead of the millions of sperm he could pump into your body at ejaculation, your only getting a few hundred with pre-ejaculate.  BUT it only takes ONE sperm to make it to the egg to make a baby.  <br>  <br>  btw - how far he entered your body is irrelevant. He could just rub the pre-ejaculate on your outer folds and you could still get pregnant from that.  Sperm are wily creatures with just one goal and purpose.|`|9fEeteY0aa	Unlikely but completely possible. <br>  <br>  Then again, I've heard stories of men ejaculating on the outside of a woman's panties, having it seep through into the vagina, and cause a pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Semen remains viable for as long as it remains wet, the same rule applies to pre.
WZe1D2jaaa	Well, it's kind of racist. In my opinion anyway. What does her color of skin have to do with how stimulating she is emotionally? An asian person can be just as entertaining and fun as a white person. A white person can be just as entertaining and fun as a black person.

You over thinking while kissing him etc. could cause stress and in the end, having sex is actually the last thing on your mind<br>  <br>  Re-think if you are actually ready for sex. If you are sure, talk to him about it, get more comfortable and try and relax.

AA12156890	The property or quality by which organisms are classified as female or male on the basis of their reproductive organs and functions.|`|AA12346188	Activities associated with sexual intercourse.|`|dtlsICGvaa	In biology, sex is a process of combining and mixing genetic traits, often resulting in the specialization of organisms into male and female types (or sexes). Sexual reproduction involves combining specialized cells (gametes) to form offspring that inherit traits from both parents. Gametes can be identical in form and function (known as isogametes), but in many cases an asymmetry has evolved such that two sex-specific types of gametes (heterogametes) exist: male gametes are small, motile, and optimized to transport their genetic information over a distance, while female gametes are large, non-motile and contain the nutrients necessary for the early development of the young organism.<br>  <br>  An organism's sex is defined by the gametes it produces: males produce male gametes (spermatozoa, or sperm) while females produce female gametes (ova, or egg cells); individual organisms which produce both male and female gametes are termed hermaphroditic. Frequently, physical differences are associated with the different sexes of an organism; these sexual dimorphisms can reflect the different reproductive pressures the sexes experience.<br>  <br>  <br>  if u like my answer, please vote my answer as best|`|ekrTfdFlaa	to reproduce and populate the world with the human race to ensure the survival of our species. duh.|`|IjkJVJNCaa	if you listened in sex education you would have found out.|`|QRbCnBgFaa	Pleasure....|`|d7f365854bd1b2b67e0fffd9d1f45472aa	Your wiener in her *****, in n out, until one of you ***!|`|GqL8VD9aaa	....google it, hun. u'll see the pics.<br>  <br>  <br>  ha<br>  <br>  ?Luv me?
AA12398373	Depending on the jurisdiction you live in, you may be past any applicable statute of limitations, where an offender doesn't have to face prosecution for a crime he/she committed long after the time limit has expired.<br>  <br>  However, that doesn't mean that the cops wouldn't be interested in hearing your story. Typically a sexual predator doesn't limit him/herself to just one crime, and they seldom stop on their own. There's a possibility that they won't be able to prosecute the offender in your case, but they may be able to prosecute this person for more recent crimes, and more importantly they may be able to prevent this person from harming another child.<br>  <br>  Plus, you said that your life has been threatened by this person(s). That in itself is a separate crime, and everytime they repeat that threat to you, the clock on the statute of limitations gets turned back to zero for that specific offense.<br>  <br>  So is it possible for you to tell the cops everything that happened? That is entirely up to you. As a matter of fact the more you can tell them the better it is for you, and the easier it is for the cops to determine what charges they can bring against this family member of yours.<br>  <br>  Will it help you any? <br>  I think getting this out in the open can do wonders toward your recovery. I think what would help you the most would be to go make your report to the police without any pre-determined expectations of an outcome, other than the fact that you have done everything you can do for any subsequent, or future victims of this sexual predator.<br>  If you go with the idea that you are going to get a certain level of satisfaction by having this person severely punished for his/her crimes, you may be setting yourself up for a crushing dissapointment if it doesn't exactly turn out the way you hoped.<br>  <br>  Here's something for you to think about. The very worst thing for a pedophile is to have his/her dirty little secret exposed for all to hear. If you think that this perpetrator will not be hugely affected by you going public with what happened unless and until he/she gets thrown in jail, you are greatly mistaken.<br>  If this person has been getting away with what they are doing until now, the simple act of having the police come around asking embarrasing questions will come as a gigantic blow, and will be the beginning of a long period of sleepless nights waiting for the day when handcuffs are placed on his/her wrists.<br>  <br>  As a victim of this kind of crime you already know too well how hard it is to come out with every detail of such an experience even if you do remember everything. <br>  The police are accustomed to only getting details from the vicims in small bit-sized pieces. Did the officers you made your initial report(s) to not ask you to call on them again if you remembered anything else?<br>  I'll bet they did, and they are waiting for you to call them back time and again until you have divulged everything you know to be true.|`|FXeuwkX0aa	lyrebmik  is right- you have to tell before it happens to someone else. You cannot heal while you hold this sick secret inside you. I am sorry to hear you went through that. Best of Luck to you.|`|5c29536e08a5b98c6451c88a20d06461aa	Please see or call a victim's crisis center ASAP.  Yes, you can report it to the cops (they will help you with everything) and ensure your safety!!!!!  It was not your fault for the act nor is it your fault for not saying anything.  But your mental health needs this and they are professionals who will help you with everything.  While talking to them, you can chose to report it or not, but whatever your choice, they will do everything they can to help you through this situation.|`|G64z6K1naa	I am so sorry you went through that, that person who hurt you is pathetic  and has now cause you so much grief . . . so in a way telling the cops would help you'd have the relief of knowing that the person couldn't hurt anyone again, and that would make you feel good but unfortunately i don't think it can get rid of your depression and attacks, it could from relief but in other ways it may not.<br>  Whatever you do is your choice and it would be right for you!<br>  <br>  *Good Luck*|`|6utUL9Hiaa	You should tell the cops because he may be doing this to others and they need to be informed incase something else happens.  I'm not sure if there is a statue of limitations of abuse of that kind where you live so the cops may or may not aloow you to press charges.  But getting it out definately helps- I've also suffered from childhood abuse and had similar depression/PTSD issues in my life- speaking out about it made me feel as if the issue was still there, but I was free from it holding me back any longer...since I've spoken out to family and a counselor my anxiety has gone away.  (((HUGS))) & ~*Good Luck*~|`|EFS3VK3waa	You should tell them before they do it to someone else, not only are you helping yourself but other people alike.  Be strong and I'm sorry that happened to you.
BRXyowHOaa	I disagree you shouldn't make it a joke.  You should simply tell him your feelings without asking anything of him, maybe steer clear of love (example- "I'm starting to have stronger feelings than friendship for you").  If you say it in a joking way you will get a vague joke back whether he likes you or not.  If you want to remain friends if he doesn't like you I don't think it will be hard, but he may very well be the same as you ( in love but unable to say it- I know I'm like that sometimes).|`|4P7N6XULaa	He might be gay,|`|4U76UK81aa	The only way to find out is to ask!  But don't be all serious and deep, keep it light and fun and flirt a little extra...say "you love me dont you! hehehe" in a really playful way and see if he responds by playing back.

mrF6N9fiaa	Leaving someone just because they are leaving to go fight for our country and make a better living for themselves and anyone in their futures is kind of wrong in my opinion. I have plenty of friends in the marines or army who have girlfriends or boyfriends back at home and they are working out fine. You just have to come to an understanding that he is doing what is best for him and you, if you are in his future. If you love him, try to work things out and stick it out. It will be hard but if you love him it's worth it. Good luck!|`|0pAczRv2aa	no, dont if you love him but its up to you. dont ruin soemthing great<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  no regrets|`|tIez5HWBaa	im going to be compltly honest with you:<br>  <br>  yes, you should leave him.<br>  <br>  waiting almost never ends well, and your better off having closure now than spending who knows how long wondering about him, and he of you.<br>  <br>  its best to stop now becuase there will be pain and suffering in the future

I don't know if it answers your question perfectly...I kind of go a little off topic/not the right kind of answer...but I love your question, it made me think and it's really interesting. <br>  10. Clean/Good - Thank you to the guys who are overall just good natured and have good intentions. I mean, flirtatious guys are great...but can we keep it clean please? Plus, nobody likes a criminal. <br>  9. Respect - I am so thankful to the guys who have respect. Those who respect even just their Moms. I appreciate guys who respect me and everyone else around them, and other peoples beliefs, and authority. That is truly amazing these days. <br>  8. Religion - I'm christian, and I appreciate guys who will respect that, who are also christian, or who at least have an interest in my faith. <br>  7. Brains - They can't be stupid. Stupid guys...who know nothing..it just bugs me. They have to know something, and be somewhat educated. <br>  6. Caring personality - I love them...those guys that truly care! They listen. They don't PRETEND to listen, they actually listen and try to help you, and are there for you. Guys who expect you to listen to them all the time, and don't bother even TRYING to understand how you feel...they're either jerks or just a waste of time and need to learn. <br>  5. Health/Fitness - In other words, body...looks. Giant chunky fat guys may have something to hug, but that's about it. Plus you just get squished in a hug. Too squished. Guys who are musuclar...thank you! Muscle...like abs, are so huggable! Plus when you hug back, your strong arms make it so...wow! Safe. Like when someone says "I get lost in his arms, I just want to be safe in his arms..." yeah well it makes you feel safe in his arms. <br>  4. Smell - Ok. The one thing I NEVER forget is how a guy smells. If he smells horrible, I remember that and yeah...they don't get much for hugs or anything. If they wear some really like, seductive cologne...I remember that too...and it gives me the chills sometimes too. Like, it just makes being in their arms an even more thrilling experience. <br>  3. Overall Personality - Who they are! Their personality has to click well with mine, like that is really important. If our personalities don't click then a relationship with them (any kind of relationship) may not work so well. <br>  2. Flirtatious - They have to be someone flirtatious!

eq820Audaa	O Man, I don't know where to start. Have your parents not talked to you about these things? When i was 16 i had a red 67 pontiac GTO convertable that i bought for 2 or 3 hundred dollars, To me that car meant nothing and i junked it for scrape for $50 bucks. If i hadn't trown It away it would be worth over $100,000 today, It's gone, Forever,I could kick myself! Your about to give away for free, something far more valuble than a car! To someone that you admitt doesant love you or care about you, Of course he would do you a(Favor) and sleep with you! thats what most guys do.Have you never heard the phrase(Find um,F**k um,And forget um!) If you do this, You will feel dirty and nasty and be filled with guilt about it for the rest of your life,and this dirt will be on the inside of your very soul,You won't be able to wash it off. And you can bet money that every guy he knows will know too. And one day in a few short years from now when you meet your knight in shining armour and he just thinks you are gods little angel,so pure and inocent,and would die for you,when you have to tell him about it and you will,because thats something you cant hide,he will never get those images of his little angel letting another man do that to you, and Imediatly His feelings for you will never ever be the same. Ive lived it,been there done that! Every word i have told you is the honest Truth. Think long and hard about it, Once you give up the Prize,It's gone Forever, So make SURE that the one you give it to is worthy to have it,thats one thing you can only give to one man in your entire life. Gosh little girl, Where are your parents!|`|jLKcuMNraa	losing your virginity to someone who already has a girlfriend is beyond ridiculous. how would you like it if you were going out with someone and some bimbo wanted to have sex with your boyfriend?|`|xwjoqf81aa	Don't have sex with him! U will regret it trust me!|`|DtUy1IFmaa	Are you serious?  Sorry if that sounded mean.. but I think you already know the answer to this and you don't want to admit it.  Don't do it!  First of all, don't you think you deserve to be a guys #1.. not his #2 girl?  Why would you settle for coming in at 2nd place?  He has a girlfriend already..he's spoken for and he's obviously a jerk if he's willing to sleep with both of you.  Who knows who else he's sleeping around with.  You will remember your first time for the REST OF YOUR LIFE!  Do you really want to remember that it was with someone else's boyfriend who had no feelings for you.  How empty is that?  Save yourself for someone who is really yours.. who really cares about you and won't keep you a secret from his girlfriend. I know you like him and all but have a little dignity and its ok to be picky about who you share your body with.
AA11646252	no just made other choices instead of the married and kids.  Just keep on and you might find the right partner you want to try it with.  If i were to seperate then i would want someone like you or me with no kids or at least the kids out of the house.<br>  <br>  rd|`|4POGapREaa	I don't place those types of judgments on others.  You'll run into people that will think there's something wrong with you, and you'll run into people who think it's fine.  I'm 37 and JUST got married which I honestly never thought would happen & I don't have kids & am not going to have any.  It works for me.  While I'm glad that I met my husband, it wasn't a major criteria in my life for me to be happy.  But I heard all the time . . . why don't you have a boyfriend?  You're so pretty you should date.  Like it's okay for ugly people to not have a boyfriend?  It just made no sense to me.  My life simply never revolved around men which is fine.  It doesn't sound like you have an aversion to it, you just didn't meet the person that you could take that step with and I think that's responsible.  My boss is 44 yrs old & going on her 4th marriage.  It's ridiculous at some point & seemingly meaningless.  So, do whatever suits you & you never know who you'll meet tomorrow.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Not cold, smart.  You knew what you wanted or didn't want and went for it.  I can imagine how much nagging you've had to take from family about getting married and have kids.  If it suits you, then you made the right choice.|`|a2390e6e9406ac2ed8d818754e58f0e7aa	Not cold, just independent and less of a risk taker.

You're so worried about getting hurt or failing, you don't allow yourself to really love a man. Realizing a lot of marriages don't work out, a lot do. You won't know which category you'll be in until you let yourself try.|`|bSiNAsHJaa	no.. just smart.. besides having kids of course cuz thats wonderful but the men are not worth all the trouble they put you through.  so im my eyes you got the easy way out, no stress, no drama, and no asshole to deal with on a daily basis..|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	I am 44 never married and No children.<br>  I am FAR from cold.<br>  <br>  I am one HOT mama!  <br>  <br>  I never wanted kids so there was never any hurry for me to get married.<br>  I am currently with a man now that I could marry.|`|AA11356977	No but I feel sad for you. Kids are the best!|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	Life is taking risks. I.ve seen marriages breaking since I was born...that`s not new, I come from one, but I decided to take risks,,Ups and downs, battles and wars...you win and loose, and that`s what marriage and kids are. I knew I cant go through life taking what I was supposed to win, and only win,,because that would be only the smallest part of the cake and  I wanted all the cake!...But I enjoy risks!..If you`re satisfied with your life as it is,,nobody can tell you what is wrong or right about it, you have the right to live your life as it pleases you, responsible life doesn`t mean no taking any risks at all, bcause often times rewards come within and they are bigger and brighter. But we make choices for whatever makes us happy, that`s called free will.|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	No not at all.  You asked about this the other day.  I have friends that focused on career and just decided marriage and kids weren't for them.  They're not cold people at all and nobody sees them that way.  They just decided to make other things priorities in their life and they're perfectly happy.
AA12370001	Check out The Martinsville Inn (Also in the Bridgewater area).  Ask for Gail or Steve.
AA11646252	Sorry for the rude answer but.  This is why women like guys at work.  They listen and do things that most husbands have done got tired of doing.  He will be happy to listen to what you have to say.  Not saying he has bad intentions but if he knows your situation and has interest he should wait on you to get out of your problem fixed before starting anything.<br>  <br>  rd|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	His age and marital status don't affect what it takes to win his heart.  <br>  <br>  But YOU ARE MARRIED.  That will definitely play a role in whether or not he wants to be with you.<br>  <br>  Instead of trying to hook up with a man and engage him in allowing you to commit adultery, why not act like a grown woman and deal with your CURRENT relationship?  <br>  <br>  It's selfish of you to expect some stranger to "fix" what's wrong.  Deal with your own crap first.  If your marriage is fixable, fix it.  If it's not, end it before even considering hooking up with someone new.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Sweetie he is not going to push, he is going to be patient and wait for you to get your life in order.  I'm sure he wants you as much as you want him, it is that he is mature enough to know that he has to be patient and not scare you away.  So all you need to do, is talk to him and tell him your ready to move your relationship forward. Good luck.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	what apart of being married do you nto understand! FOR BETTER OR WORSE! Work it out with your husband he doesnt deserve to be cheated on. if you cheat on him then later on when you have been divorced it will come back to haunt you.|`|IvMPh09baa	WHoah.... slow down.  your MARRIED. <br>  <br>  Since when is it ok for you to cheat on your husband? <br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you are trying to justify your cheating right now.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Too early to open up to him. At the dinner let him know that you care for him through your actions but not in words. Have a few more lunches and dinners with him to make sure that he feels the same about you. At the same time, you need to change your marital status if you are miserable in your marriage. If this guy has any values then he will not have an intimate relationship with you and respect you as long as you are married. Change your status while getting closer to this guy.|`|93ix6nyvaa	I think you should resolve the issue with your current husband FIRST before you do anything else with this guy. Yeah, maybe you guys are perfect for each other, he loves you, you love him.. age doesn't matter, etc. etc. But be responsible and divorce your husband before you start a new relationship.|`|wia9SXCPaa	Didn't you say you were MARRIED!!!!<br>  <br>  Hello.................|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Wow...you are 28?  Your are contradicting yourself in this question and explanation.  On one hand you say you just want a diversion and then you say you "want to win his heart?"  What's up with that?  You are telling me that you want to use him, but make him fall in love with you.  Are you wanting to hurt this innocent, wonderful man?  And on top of it, you are MARRIED with a child.  You need to learn to love yourself and become the confident, secure woman God intended for you to be.  And not look for yourself in another man just because your husband isn't fulfilling what you lack inside of yourself.  What a chore your husband must be going through.  To have to fulfill his needs and yours too.  It's time to grow up girl and I wish you and your child the best of luck.
u0eTvggDaa	Yeah that would probably be the best way, have them meet her parents. and then let your parents know that you will check in with them, like call or text them when you get there. and keep them updated.<br>  <br>  then they shouldn't have a reason not to let you go!<br>  <br>  <br>  GoodLuck!|`|cdQryr7paa	Well, I don't know how old you are.<br>  I don't know how far away Austin is from where you live.<br>  How old is your friend's older sister?<br>  Does your friend's parents know all the details of this trip?<br>  <br>  I need a little more information.|`|dzbblpjgaa	Depend on the concert!!!

AA10065812	*** Through Child Support Enforcement?  No, the claim would have needed to have been renewed every 24 months past the time when the last child turned 18.  Though I've never heard of this being done, you could sue for financial damages through the regular courts.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	I rescind that statement made earlier as I didn't look at the code. According to the code:<br>  <br>  The court retains jurisdiction to render a contempt order for failure to pay child support  if the motion for enforcement is filed not later than the 2nd anniversary of the date <br>  <br>  1. child becomes and adult, or<br>  2. on which the child support order terminates by operation of law.<br>  <br>  However, the court retains jurisdiction  to confirm  the total amount of support owed and render judgment for past due support if a motion for enforcement requesting a money judgment is filed not later than the 10th anniversary after the date:<br>  <br>  1. Child becomes an adult, or<br>  2. on which the child support order terminates under the terms of the order or operation of law.|`|c4RCWIwgaa	To be honest I think that is wrong. If your child is 35 now and you are still mad about not getting child support you are just after it for the money. Child support  is to help you raise your children not pay for stuff years later. My boyfriend and I have talked about kids and that is one thing I talked to him about was if for some reason we left one another after we had kids we could keep everything out of court and no child support or alimony. People make me sick with their greediness. I am sure I will get flagged for this but that means that people would have to read it and I know other people feel the same way about this.|`|67ThRN4Taa	I live in Katy, Texas.  <br>  <br>  Most likely not.  There's a statute-of-limitations, I think that its seven years but I could be wrong.|`|wmOgseCgaa	Only if you owe the state for financial aid when the child was young.
2GNFQPdmaa	Jeff deserves NO sympathy. He's being a two-timing d-bag, it's clear he's only got his own desires as his priorities if he wants to keep Sara "on the shelf" for whenever he's done using Ashley for what he wants.<br>  <br>  He sounds like a self-centered prick to me. His position is completely unfair.|`|Eug52iQDaa	What grade are you guys in?  4th?  Jeff is extremely immature.  He wants his cake and his 'girlfriends' all to himself with no commitment whatsoever.  Jeff is being a jerk.  Keep your friends and wait for Jeff to grow up some day.  Until then, enjoy life.|`|JlDcVTVsaa	If is dating other girls, then he shouldnt be jealous of Sara and who she is with. <br>  and he doesnt deserve to be with her.<br>  And if he was dating other girls, and you are just friends with Sara I dont know why he would get so mad.|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	Jeff's actions speak louder than his words.  If he can be friends with Sara while dating Ashley, why can't you also be friends with Sara?  You should tell him to check himself in the mirror because his hypocrisy is showing.<br>  <br>  The fact that Sara initiated the conversation with you means that you are in the clear to talk to her as far as I see it.  It sounds like Jeff is just playing her anyway or at the very least is not interested in anything serious.  If he thinks it is okay for him to date Ashley and does not see anything wrong with it, then why is he unwilling to tell Sara about it?  Perhaps he is getting something from Ashley that he was not able to get from Sara...<br>  <br>  And why do you want to repair a friendship so badly if he isn't even going to try?  You can't have a friendship where one person cares about it and the other does not.  <br>  <br>  I know there are two sides to every story, or in this case more like four sides, but Jeff sounds like kind of a selfish guy that I personally would not want to be friends with.<br>  <br>  I think Sara deserves to know what has been going on without her knowledge.|`|NbdZoxxQaa	Well you are first and foremost Jeff's friend, and if he is uncomfortable with you being friends with Sara then maybe you should respect that and back off. <br>  However if you truly only want ot be friends with Sara then no, there should not be a problem with that, besides if you are his friend, then he should want his friend and his girl to be friends anyway. This whole situation is a bit ek, because he was kind of cheating on Sara anyway. <br>  If he doesn't see a problem with dating ashley because sara and him are not technically dating then why didn't he just tell sara that he had a girlfriend? if it was really ok, and he knew it was ok then he would have told sara. <br>  It also sound like if you are looking at Sara as fair game then you might be interested in her as eventually becoming more than a friend. IF your friendship with Jeff means that much to you then maybe you should back off of being friends wit Sara for a little while. Still be nice to her, but only hang out wit her when she is with your group of friends.

I think she just loves you so much and is afraid.|`|62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	Pay for it yourself and go. Then it doesn't matter what she wants you to do. It's not like she'll hate you and never talk to you again. She'll get over it.
JlDcVTVsaa	well she already took the next move, she start a conversation with you, I think you should have talked to her abit more. <br>  <br>  next time you see her just be nice to her and say hi, and if she starts talking to you talk back and dont try to ignore her or make it short.|`|Eug52iQDaa	I don't mean to be terribly unkind, but if you're going to a bar, you're not in the 4th grade, right?  Grow up.  If you want to hang out with her again, tell her so.  Next move is up to her.  If she declines, go on with your life.  Why the drama?  Lordy, sweetie. you're going to give yourself ulcers over total non-issues.  Stop playing peek a boo games!   sigh...|`|AA11479805	That's nice of her to think about you.

Maybe it is his and this girls chance for happiness, even if it short lived.  Does your friend work for the "Make A Wish" foundation and he is wanting to fulfill her wish?   All kidding aside, it is his life and his choice.

It would be better for him to be a FRIEND to this girl, than a husband.|`|AA11531535	Ordinarily no! But, not knowing how long she has, I can kinda see it. It will set him up for heart ache of course, but it would make her happy in the time that she has left. And, I do believe in love at first sight, so it may have been a God send, them meeting.
WW8o8Gdbaa	you made the first mistake by taking it personally,you should have dealt with it in a calmer manner.I don't blaim you though.it isnt my place to judge,and i dont.<br>  Try to talk to his mother calmly,tell her you are sooo sorry but your still going through the grieving process and you know that you didn't help any with their situation.Ask if you can apologize to ryan,take it slow and time will do the rest.<br>  Umm if your heartless you can roll out a few crocadile tears and make yourself look hopeless.But I would hate you even though I dont know you,for it.<br>  And besides your trying to be a role model,so take responsiblility and whenever you are apologizing NEVER say BUT becuase that completly dimisses what you just said.<br>  You got to be a  man and take it ,no retaliation.<br>  I think you can do it ,you strick me as the type to be responsible and tough.<br>  just remember,time heals all wounds.<br>  and patience lets them heal.|`|zQB0kEmcaa	Nothing is ever achieved with aggressive behaviour.  It is a pity you behaved that way with the bully and his dad.  I do understand, however, that your family loss has made you very protective.  You said yourself that you wanted to be role model for Ryan but if he sees you acting aggressively, he will emulate that perhaps.  He has pent up emotions inside of him because of his dad's death and if you want to help him you must remain calm and supportive, and not aggressive.  Go to your family and explain that you were wrong but explain why you did it and promise that it will never happen again.  It is more difficult to control your emotions but if you are able to do it you will feel more in control in so many other ways - anger just promotes anger and gets you nowhere.  I am sorry for your loss - but help this young man as much as you can.  The teen years are difficult enough without a death to deal with.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	Eat Funyuns.|`|lSGNCKitaa	It seems like you did all this to protect Ryan.

Could you maybe write a letter to your sis explaining the situation and let her know you would never do anything to hurt her or Ryan? Tell her you couldn't stand that other kid mocking Ryan for something Ryan has no control over. Tell her you love him and you felt he needed to be defended by this mouthy bully. It may not have been the best of choices that day, But, I commend you on your protecting your nephew.

AA11646252	talk to the girl you are dating and see if she is bothered or if you are doing things wrong.  She will tell you.  Just tell her what you have heard and what you want to know.<br>  <br>  rd|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I would take no notice of her friend, she may have ulterior motives and be trying to split you two, if what you have been doing so far is working then carry on, your girl obviously likes the attention you give her.<br>  Unless you get a warning off your girl I would leave things as they are, her friend does not know the intimacies of your relationship so how can she know what your girl likes or dislikes.|`|IARYnu6zaa	If you're generally worried that you are smothering/bugging her, tone it down a little but still text her.<br>  I know for a fact I'd get upset if someone just stopped texting me.<br>  I think you're right not to change your behavior.<br>  If things seem to be working, I wouldn't really do a lot.<br>  Her friend might just be looking out for her, try talking to her about it.<br>  Goodluck.|`|06739df0d942e1453ff4682201397570aa	She sounds like a *****, my sister used to do that to guys and she was a player.<br>  I don't think you should change, find someone that actually has time for you and is interested in you as well.<br>  And why the hell is she having her friend talk to you for her? that's really immature. If she has a problem she should come talk to you herself.|`|vo7Ws7xtaa	I can understand your dilemma.  I think the best thing you can do as a mature caring individual is to ask your girlfriend.  Let her know that her friend had said that to you and you are wondering if she's feeling a bit smothered by the attention that you give to her.  Do it in a way that she won't feel attacked or that you're upset, just that you are genuinely concerned and you don't want to do anything to make her feel that way.  Some girls don't speak up when something is bothering them, but I think if you create an open dialogue with her, you'll both be better able to deal with things that are bothering you.  Eliminate the best friend whispering her opinion.  Go to the source.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck|`|yYgsyopAaa	You have 3 options: Do as you were told by the friend, back off and wait for her to make all the moves; Ignore the friend's advice and keep doing what you have been; or, Talk to your woman.  Personally, I'd go with option 3. Tell her what her friend said, and be honest, ask her if you are being pushy, tell her you don't want to be, and work things out with her.  Trust someone who has been there, 3 people in a relationship doesn't work.|`|TIqFAXo1aa	Just reduce you qty of text.  The key is make her wonder why you haven't texted her then she will text you- just say you had been busy.   <br>  <br>  Relationships are like a dance- you take 2 steps forward, she'll take 2 steps back,  now it is your turn to back up 2 steps and watch her come to you!  lol!

Talk to your friends about how you feel, and dont be hurtful to them or call names.|`|zFZ2EAsmaa	fighting with friends is always something thats going to happen in life. Helping out a relationship is not easy and it takes time. Girls fight all the time and it's just a common thing we do. Talk to them and tell them that your tired of fighting.

You have found a bad Bestfriend because if she would drop you for another girl then she never really was your bestfriend in the first place. Dont talk to Maria or any of those bytchy girls just make new friends. You chose your friends dont let them chose you. If I knew you I probaly would love to be your friend because you stand up for them and is always on their side whether they are in the wrong or right. Thats what friends are surpose to do you deserve better girl. A while for now Maria will notice what she is missing and come running back.|`|Ukw1JUNcaa	Have you tried to talk to your friend about these two girls? I'm just wondering if she might not understand that they treat you badly. Explain to Maria that the reason you aren't hanging out with her as much anymore is definitely not because of her, as she's your best friend, but because these girls are rude and mean to you and you don't want to put yourself in that kind of unfair environment. You can tell her that if she wants to be friends with them, you'll respect that, but you don't want to hang out with them, communicate with them, and pretend to be friends with them for her sake. Hopefully she will realize that she's just been overlooking these girls treating you badly.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, give her space and time to be with these girls, and hang out with other friends. She might realize over time that she really misses you, and that these two girls are nothing compared to the friendship she had with you. She also might see their "true colors" after hanging out with them for a while. Good luck.|`|c617559266efbc693e901300839114a0aa	when your friends just do ignorant stuff and say stuff just ignore them u kno they just doing that to irritate u its all crazy forreal
AA10494978	OK, first of all, I'm sorry you are put into that situation.  This is not a situation where you should have to worry about hurting your parent's feelings.  YOU are the child, THEY are the adults.  Your best interest should be the overriding factor here, not their feelings, ok?  You are 13, they are grown ups.  OK?  So do not feel bad about making the decision that is the RIGHT decisions for you if you are up to it.  However, normally adult parents should always consider their children before any other relationship.  Although I am sure your dad loves you and cares about you, he did put you in a situation where you have to make a decision you are not ready for.  Is there any way you can talk to him before you have to let the attorney know what you want to do?  Ask him if he is aware of how difficult this is for you and to see what he can do about it?<br>  <br>  I'm assuming he already knows you are allergic to pets, right?  <br>  <br>  Do you get along well with your mom?  That may have to be the case, where you live with your mom for a while and your dad visits you.  You cannot be in an environment where your health is at risk.  OK?  But mainly, see if you can talk to your dad and see what he says.  Explain to him what you are going through.  You sound like a very mature 13 year old, so I think you will be just fine.  Good luck with everything, and remember, none of this is your fault or your problem.  OK?  This si something your parents have to work out.  If You have to choose who you want to live with, choose the option that is best for you.  The adults should consider your best interest at heart and so don't feel guilty about choosing one way or another.  OK?  But definitely talk to your dad.<br>  <br>  Update: if you think it is the right decision for you, then you are right, it is the right decision.  DON'T WORRY, your dad will not stop loving you for it.  Its OK!  You have to take the best course of action for yourself.  Think about it this way.  When school is in session, how would you be able to study if all you can worry about is having a reaction?  Once again, YOU are the child.  They are the adults.  Your dad telling you that he will move away if you don't choose him was wrong of him.  OK?  You made the right decision.|`|zYSiWuy8aa	YOU SOUND REALLY BRIGHT, IT IS ALWAYS HARD AT THE TIME <br>  BUT IT WILL WORK OUT. YOU NEED TO BE IN  A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN BE HAPPY. GOOD CHOICE!|`|AA10072732	better live with your mom. and you can see your dad anytime, right?|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	Gosh, you are in a tight spot.  It's rough when you are worried about your parents thinking that you love one more than the other.<br>  <br>  When the attorney asks you, just tell her this:<br>  <br>  "This is a hard decision.  I love both of my parents so much.  But I feel like I would be better off with my mom.  I am so allergic to animals, I just don't think it's a good idea for me to live around the pets at my dad's house."<br>  <br>  Then, give your dad a hug, tell him you love him, THANK HIM for letting you live with him, and go on living with your mom.<br>  <br>  When you express gratitude, nobody's feelings get hurt.|`|9uIjRBVMaa	If you really want to live with your mom, that's what you should tell the attorney. You can always visit your dad on the weekends. Besides, he should understand that you don't want to be surrounded by cats, dogs, and someone you just don't get along with. Hope you come to a confident decision :)|`|w6v8JnBAaa	Live with Mom & use a phone & web cam to keep in touch with Dad. Be sure to tell him that you love him but, this is the best decision right now.|`|BnOynwgdaa	I think that you should live with your mom and arrange an occasional visit to your dad's. The fact that he did not oppose the cats and dogs which made to go to hospital shows that he is more leaning towards your step mom. But dad and mom are the best thing you should keep in life as long as you all are in the planet. <br>  <br>  I think you should talk to your dad and try to explain how you feel about the situation like about the inhospitable condition with your step mom and you not wanting to hurt him and all. I know its tough to choose, but don't be disheartened with the current situation because they are choosing what makes them happy and you should try and be part of it. Just think of it, what would you prefer a dad and mom living separate but happily? or two people under the same roof arguing all the time. And remember there is no such thing as "PERFECT PICTURE" as perfection is an idea that differs with every individual. <br>  <br>  Teen age is a beautiful time in life, please try to be positive and Communicate and be there for your loved ones... GOOD LUCK!!|`|EQW734wQaa	Here's what you do, you ask to speak before the judge and both families and all. You announce you want to live with your mom because your step-mom isn't nice to you BUT your dad warned you he will move far away if you don't choose him. Then look to your dad in front of everyone and ask him, is this manipulation really good for you? Is this love? <br>  <br>  I would then say you choose to live with your mom and hope your dad is big enough, mature man to not punish you for this. If so, then he isn't the dad you want right now, until he can mature.<br>  <br>  Say all this aloud and record it with camcorder. Tell them all you want to keep this and see how it plays out and want to remember.<br>  <br>  <br>  THIS IS HARD BUT....you don't want to say 10-20 years from now...why didn't I call my father's manipulative/unloving behavior out before all!!!!!!!!!! Just think, if he gives you ultimatums like this, imagine how crappy a father he'll be when his new sexpot wife goes against you!!!! If he can't wake up in the courtroom and apologize and not move away because you chose mom, you won't be happy living with him and his new wife!|`|1179ac1ef69ec53031ff43e46bee7a38aa	While it's good to care about other people's feelings, you should base your decision on what is best for you. Clearly your dad is not providing a safe place for you to live if you have been sent to the hospital because of pet allergies more than once. Letting the possibility that your dad's feelings will be hurt influence your decision is a way of taking care of him emotionally.  It is his job to take care of you, not the other way around. If you want to live with your mom, you should say so.<br>  <br>  Additional: Just read the additional part about your dad saying he'd move away if you don't live with him. This sounds like emotional blackmail to me. Is he willing to get rid of the pets and keep the stepmom in line if you live with him? Your mom is your best bet.|`|vn2Lq7hIaa	The question really is not which parent you want to live with, it's which parent can you live with due to your allergies. <br>  <br>  Your health has to be the most deciding factor in your choice. It is not a matter of not wanting to hurt your Dads feelings, you could die with a severe allergic reaction, and he has to understand that.<br>  <br>  Since your Mom has no pets to affect the allergy, you must stay with her.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  God Bless<br>  <br>  EDIT;<br>  MELISSA,<br>  I AM PROUD OF YOU! Rest assured you did make the correct choice. You are very mature and responsible.<br>  I wish you the best of everything!<br>  Bill

You cannot make another be happy.  Happiness is a choice.  She chooses not to be happy.  You cannot change that.

If you do well at school, help at home and don't get in trouble, then you're not doing anything to make her unhappy. That's a big difference from making someone happy. She may be depressed or have other issues that are beyond her control and they're certainly beyond yours. Unless you're making her miserable, which I doubt you are, there's nothing you can do. Mention this to a relative and see if they can talk to her about getting some help. If she doesn't there's not much you can do except keep on being a good kid and tell her you love her.<br>  Oh, and just because she doesn't seem happy, doesn't mean she's not glad you're her child and happy about having you.|`|r6ok7NbEaa	Be the best daughter / son you can be.

8FbOtXAXaa	Just tell them to knock it off, this kid didn't do anything to them. Why should he be picked on for something he has never even done to them? Maybe you could have a casual conversation with the kid and make it seem like he is a cool guy and just talk to him and maybe those two kids will see that either the kid isn't so bad after all and they will just stop picking on him or else they will know you are being friends with him and you already said they won't mess with you.

Make it short, light and entertaining so it is giving her something. Don't ask for anything, including a date. Be the one to end the call. Continue this as long as she responds.

Tell her that it's pretty disappointing that she has to play these games and if she wants to find you, she knows where to look.  That way you do not return the favor or chase.  However, she now has to chase you if she wants you.      Put your foot down; don't stoop down to that level, it makes you seem like a girl.

If she does but she's playing some sort of game with you, then you're better off without her anyway.

It doesn't matter if they think good or bad of you. And, really the only people that should metter to you are friends and family. trust me when i was in high school i did the same thing and was miserable but by my senior year i had a solid group of friends and stopped caring so much, thats the best thing you can do. identify who your real friends are and just stick with them because true friends will always be there for you and never judge.     Also, you probably are an amazing person, everyone is, and if you realize that you are trying to be conceited then stop what your saying or doing immediately.     Really, just try and relax, your young and its normal for you to feel this way. Find something you really enjoy doing and when ur feeling down use that to make you happy, hope this helps!!|`|0fVtHNtmaa	You're being a typical teenage drama queen. Stop trying so hard, relax and enjoy being a kid.|`|AA10901855	Get yourself a journal and vent your frustrations in it|`|G3DY39luaa	i know! i was once and still am concieted! hahah...but i tried my best everyday to impress boys at school got up early every morning to get ready! i liked to make girls not like me! i was selfish!  make your self feel better by helping out others!  it will change you alot!|`|QOzAkOSUaa	Nobody like someone fake. Why dont you just be yourself, then people who are genuine also can start to get to know you. I think you have a lot of insecurities about yourself. Its not just you, everyone does at some point. You could alternatively move schools and start a fresh leaf, then people will get to know you for weho you are rsther than judge you like in your curent school. Dont be something your not. Im sure your a lovely person anyway.|`|Mu6E3SF2aa	look, im really self conscious too  im seeing a psychologist because it got to the point where i was hurting myself  talk to you parents about seeing a shrink  i think it helps   fourteen yr old to fourteen yr old|`|3jmD09zAaa	Just be yourself.  Don't get me wrong I have my days too when I think someone is thinking bad about me but you have to tell yourself everyday that you are all that and a bag of chips and when you build that confidence other people are going to see that. People would want to be around u more expecially the guys they love confident women.|`|rQ7dI88Maa	Don't try to impress people, just be yourself. Be positive about yourself. If you feel you are ugly, change your hairstyle or something to make you feel pretty. Then work on your self confidence and tell yourself you are just as good as anyone else. Most of all, believe it! It starts with a lot of positive self talk. It's easy to tell yourself what you think others are thinking but why be negative about it? You're only causing yourself to feel bad. I challenge you to not walk down the opposite side of school. Walk with the rest and smile. Just smile and hold your head high.When people stare at you, continue to smile and walk confidently even if it scares you. After awhile, it will come naturally.

Listen to that voice inside you!|`|1lEuIu23aa	I don't think you should put yourself through this emotional roller coaster that he has created.  I wouldn't answer the phone when he calls.  It sounds as if he is very insecure with himself or is bipolar.  Why would you ever want to be with someone that is monitoring everything you do?  I just hope if you decide to leave the relationship, he doesn't become more obsessive!|`|YVO3WyU1aa	In answer to your first question.  Both.  You are crazy for staying in it and he is just crazy.  The basics for a relationships is trust and communication.  You do not have either one.  As for the victim part, the term for him is "attacking from the victims position".  In answer to your last question, yes, then say the Magic words, "Good Bye".|`|RDweOt4gaa	Bi polar

dwiuV0Hvaa	if u dont get married the waiting will not and can never be in vain. it will only make the both of u respect each other for ever & where ever u see each other.    and that will make the both of u friends for life as long as u break up in peace.    because u love her u shd stop thinking abt negative thoughts.    just respect her wish & try 2 get over the sex issue.    the only way a distance relationship can work is if the both of u always communicate. make sure u call her every day & also email her as long as she calls back & email u bck. ur relationship will work perfectly.    my first relationship was distance that did not work coz i was young & naive then. & that made me 2 run away from guys that stay far 4rm me.    but my present boy friend travells often coz of his Job. some times for weeks & even months, but we try 2 keep in touch. he calls me like every hr & txt me like very minute & i always make sure i reply his txt messages & i call  him every time i think abt him & any time i misses him. thats like, some times 2-6 times every day. & we make this long nite calls for hrs we will b on the phone talking abt how our days was. coz the country i am, nite calls are cheaper.    so the only way u make ur distance relationship 2 work is by communicating & always being in touch.& being sincere to each other    any girl that bothers u abt sex just tell her u have been taken & that u are in a relationship u cherish & ask her hw she will feel if her BF cheats on her if she is going 2 like it. if she says no she wont like it, then u tell her ur girl will not like it 2 & that u both can be friends(thats if u like her as a friend)     good luck|`|jJ6WZADXaa	long relatjonship..and no sex....move on.   i dont think ur gonna be able to wait that long. but if u really love her then i guess....cheating is not ok. never will. tell her ur feelings .      good luck=|`|I9mEKOhVaa	decide what you really want.  depending on your age if you are not ready to get married i suggest find another girl.  later down the road you two might hook up again and the situation might be different by then|`|ptQJ7EwYaa	First of all if you truly love her then you should be willing to wait.

Long distance relationships almost never works because people need physical attention to keep a strong bond with a girlfriend/spouse. It doesn't mean just sex it also means seeing that person everyday. Hearing there stories they tell in person. Things like that. I'm sure you care about her but I bet you mind wonders about other women alot because she is not around. If she is worth keeping at least move closer or vice versa. Other than that your chances aren't good in the long run. Sorry for the bad news but it's the truth. Good luck|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	if what you want from life doesnt match with what she wants in life, it wont work out. Havent you heard that long distance relationships never work out? Its TRUE!!! If you never see each other, whats the point. You're both young...move on|`|8pw8qDjPaa	If she doesnt want to have sex you have to respect that. Sex isnt everything in a relationship and especially in a long distance relationship that shouldnt be the first thing you think of when you see her. It doesnt sound like its going to work out for you guys, I'm sorry to say that, but it just doesnt sound like you're mature enough to deal with a relatioship, especially a long distance one.|`|fEuBJ3ZNaa	stop being selfish.|`|AA12176471	First of all, sex isn't everything. I wish I had held onto my virginity longer than I had. Secondly, the wait wouldn't be in vain because you'll get married someday, and it will mean a lot for your future wife that you held out for her. It makes her special. From my personal experience, long distance relationships don't work. We were both young and head over heels in love with each other. Four years of my life was dedicated to him. And I lost him. Don't give your virginity because of peer pressure. Give it because she means something genuine to you.|`|vTkAre7zaa	respect what she wants if u cant then u dont truly respect her
58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	It sounds like this guy had some issues with a previous relationship and he felt like he wouldnt be able to commit to you until he could let go of his past. Sounds like he didnt want to put you through any drama and if he did get with you, he didnt want to screw it up! If he wants to meet up with you, I'd go meet him! Be honest and tell him how you feel and tell him to be honest too. Dont get your hopes up. He may not be ready yet. ask him whats going on in his life and try to be supportive. But, yea, it kind of does sound like he's interested in getting to know you again, since its been so long since you last met him. It sounds like he has a lot of respect for you too, wanting you to finish school, and not wanting to get you mixed up in his drama. Sounds like a good guy.|`|HRJkHuw4aa	he is just as interested as you are, and probably feels just as weird about the situation. just take it little by little, dont jump in to quick.|`|vTkAre7zaa	yes go for it if u dnt u will regret it...wht have u to loose?|`|z0nLFAL9aa	Possibly but don't get your hopes up. You still have feelings, so you don't want to get hurt.|`|769a32433d976cd4dfb46f538f6485eeaa	Yes he is interested in you. Based on what you've said it really sounds like he was telling the truth and just needed some heal time to get over an ex. I say go for it and you'll be glad you did.|`|AA11886887	It sounds like he was getting over a prior gf and did not want to lead you on. He wanted to wait until he can really get to know you and connect. It sounds like he has reached that point. If you still like him, meet up with him and see where things go.|`|EZp1gOhYaa	if you love something let it go, and if it comes back then thats how you know, ig ot up to the stop light then i made four rights, now im back where i started and your back in my life ..    i think you do still have feelings for him, and i think he also has feelings for you,|`|ptQJ7EwYaa	He may be intersted but he doesnt actually want to be in just one relationship....But he does like you or care...It may be hard from him to settle down|`|23221fc5800c194352dec2cc606aa4e0aa	Hmmmm.... Looks like he is a very good player.... Well... Better be real careful ya?    (*_^)
g6Ln2Ayraa	Guys lie about stuff like that because they are skeezy jerks. This guy probably just wanted to hook up and figured that you would not be into it if you knew that he had a girlfriend. Obviously if he is talking bad about asians/filipinos and his girlfriend is one this guy is a SUPER jerk.|`|AA10855383	I can tell you exactly why. Most women (with sense) will not go sleep with a guy if they already kow he has a girlfriend.   He will lie about being single jsut so he can have other women in his life, too. (for example, YOU).  Why?? I wish i knew........|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Welcome to the world of tools and douchebags. Happens all the time.|`|CqfQI5NSaa	Maybe he is a little racist, so by pretending to have a filipino girlfriend he will appear as if he is not.|`|ziSXXqWUaa	for me i lie about having a girlfriend because i get made fun if they found out i didn't have one. I still don't i'm such a loser :(
JPBh5WT3aa	I am so sorry you are dealing with this. It is heartbreaking to love someone and see them suffer this way, and it also brings you to your knees with suffering too.    There is no help for him. Your father is very sick. He's been through the system many many times. He knows the steps. He just can't take them. He is overcome by his illness. There is nothing you can do to make him see the light and change. He is the only one that can do that and at this point....it is probably not going to happen.     I have been down the same road with my son. Serious addiction, many rehabs, relapse after relapse, and suicide attempts. My son is a wonderful person, he will do well with the 12 step programs initially, and at about 6 months he too will relapse. That is when the "honeymoon" period is over, and it is very common for relapse.    Suicidal thoughts are very common in the rock bottom part of addiction, and you can't hold yourself responsible for your father arriving to this kind of thinking. You can however continue to love him, and to listen to him and show that you care. You may not agree with what he says, but you can still listen, unless it becomes too painful for you. Then you have to back away. You need to take care of YOU.     No matter what, he is still your father, and you still feel for him and love him. Don't take your love away from him. You can always tell him that you do not condone his alcoholism, but you still love HIM. You can protect yourself by backing away, but still let him know that you love him. Don't let him manipulate or guilt you into doing more than you are comfortable with. That IS loving him.     Unfortunately, the way the system works......most people are thrown out of rehab long before they have the tools they need to survive. Experts say that an average person will relapse several times, and that rehab is not effective unless it is at least SIX months. Who can afford that? Our society doesn't want to help these people and families struggling with addiction, yet our jails are filled with them.....using our tax dollars.     So, even though he's already been down this road....you can try to get him back into rehab which you can do through your hospital emergency room. If he is actively suicidal and makes a threat.....call 911. Leave the professionals to deal with suicide threats! Remember though, the criteria for him getting FURTHER help is that he has to be an IMMEDIATE threat to himself or someone else. And with all the cuts in economy, he probably will be kicked to the curb. At least there will be a record of it, so if it is a re-occurring thing, authorities will eventually have to stop kicking him to the curb. This is basically the only way to get him into rehab, unless he can go willingly, and has the financial resources to do so. Most don't....by the time they need rehab......they've already lost everything.     For you, I would go to Alanon. If you don't like going to Alanon, they have online groups and meetings. I know how hard it is always waiting for the other shoe to fall. Read some books on Alanon principles about numbing and taking care of you. Melody Beatie has several very good books.    If you need a shoulder, feel free to write to me. I know how you feel.
1WqU4uAeaa	I would have to say...learn from your mistakes. You said the last one was a disaster, why on earth would you even consider it again? I understand that in other countries there are certain traditions but, on the other hand, in your defense, you went along with "tradition" and look how that worked out. I would stand firm and follow your heart on this one, good luck|`|lzooHi0Baa	You need to stand up for your happiness.   Don't fall into the same cycle again.   Love and relationship is not something to be arranged like a deck of cards.   Feelings, chemistry, respect and passion are some of the ingredients necessary to make it work.   You can arrange for a job, a hobby, a vacation, but not for marriage.  Dont let others live your life for you nor make decisions.    It is your life, your decision.  You have total control of it.   Take your time knowing yourself better and do not rush into a relationship.   You will attract what you are in time.  Get rid of any insecurity, love and respect yourself and you will see that prince charm appear when you least expect it, unarranged.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Don't rush into a loveless marriage again, If you can take care of yourself and are independent.

Or is that not possible?|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Don't stress about it and the man of your dreams will come.  Your caving under because of the pressure your family is putting on you to get married.  Ignore them and keep your eyes open.  Take your time dating and finding the right man.

Now go out there and find it!!!|`|ByUS0k8waa	My husband comes from a country that are still very common to arranged marriages. He's cousin is about to enter into a arranged marriage and is very happy about it. However, I think its better to wait for God to hand you that person that is made just for you when the time is right. It will happen when you least expect it trust me that is what happen with my husband and I. I was raised to wait for that love and God will give him to you when you need him the most or when the time is right. Some people wait til they are in their 60's and 70's even 80's when they find that person and get married. Just wait it out. However if your parents want to set you up on a blind date they may find the right person when you would think your parents wouldn't find the right person for you. Your parents may find someone who has the same background and that way you have something in common and that might help. Just hold out for that true love!|`|iD4ejChZaa	a Christian marriage is about Christ so if you are from an unChristian family make the decision to put Jesus first, now that is the number one Christian view. speak to a pastor.|`|lN5d688gaa	my parents had an arrange marriage and they've been married for 52 years.  with every marriage comes work.  whether you fall in love with them then married them or arrange marriage.  you must work for it.     nothing is easy.  the greater the conflict the better the reward and appreciation for it.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	Some of the most beautiful lifelong committed marriages are arranged.  No it's not for everyone, especially is American culture.    If you're waiting for your one true match than I suggest getting on your knees and starting to pray for him.  Pray for God to reveal him to you.  Be patient and wait on God to bring him to you.      It took me 5 years of waiting and praying.|`|OBCvewW2aa	I can only wish I came from a culture of arranged marriages. Seems that arranged marriages work better (except in your case).  I read that only 1% of arranged marriages end in divorce compared to 50% of love matches. With those chances you're better off going the arranged route.    First comes marriage, then love.  Makes sense to me.|`|rX8MkfBJaa	I have to say that my sister did the eharmony thing and has been married about 6 years already and still happy.  she relized her choices we not sufficient to find the right man, so she found a person on eharmony that had 90% of things in common with her. they clicked great after meeting and were married a month later.  try it. it is worth a shot.
ct300nsOaa	Yeah as long as he knows what to do just in case something goes wrong|`|zL1sggpCaa	Yup... legal age is 12.

So, yes....|`|HRJkHuw4aa	if the 16 yr old is responsible enough, but legally you should check what the state law is. where I live a 16 yr old can watch up to three kids under the age of 12 for up to 12 hours but no more.|`|AtJgXB59aa	yes if he is responsible|`|hhL1G3Ofaa	There is no law against it, but everyone knows their own kids and if they teen is responsible enough to handle that.|`|nJ33E233aa	Yes, if that teen agrees to be responsible for the younger children.

Best things that happens is that you break up succesfully and you don't feel like any of this was your fault, to me its sounds like you need talk this over seriously with your girl. Ask her if she loves you or not, and tell her that its hard for you to believe that you are the right one for her if she is hanging out with this other guy. I know that I wouldn't accept it. Cheating is just ugly. It makes you jealous right, and angry. So tell her this, and tell her that you can't go on like this. To me she sounds like a friend, not girlfriend. Maybe this is the case, perhaps she regards you just as a friend :S|`|MYbRICxqaa	How did she make-out with a guy that lives so far away? I thought you said they have not met. What have this other guy done to her? She should have asked for advice and not you from Yahoo. The blame is all on her. Why will you continue to call her you girlfriend when I got the understanding that you are through with her. Well, you should finish this lease with her and then move on with your life. If she can do what she did then she don't 100% care about you and your feelings. I don't understand this if you are unhappy with someone then let them go and then have your lovers or what not. If you love her and want to be with her then take it slowly. She is not to be trusted.

Love is full commitment.|`|GaxJ5Qiwaa	love hurts|`|QTZ3MZqbaa	liking someone means, that you like them, but you could also let that person go very easy. loving someone means that your crazy about that person, and its not easy to let them go.|`|Q33dbzAdaa	If I cry when they die, I loved them.  If i'm like "oh man. thats too bad. shame" and then turn on the ball game, I liked them.

JoaIqg0laa	It depends on the guy, Id have to know more about him and what you mean.  But generally guys all have a sensitive side, and like you're saying most cover it up with toughness.  Men like to protect their women and feel dominant...show her that she can feel safe with him.  So if he sees that you like it when hes tough he will be more.|`|sDOXS5KRaa	we have to act like we're not crapping ourselves inside or girls will just think we're the "cute best-friend type".    Society is pathetic.|`|YMQAziI3aa	well it depends. if someones gonna hurt u and we stop them, then were not gonna say were scared
PgbPCUtnaa	A lot of people take risks in life because there are adages that say, "you only live once."  and "live life with no regrets."  But if you hate the person you have become, change.  Sure it may take a while, but sitting down and thinking what you want in life and what you want to stop in life should help you.  You don't have to eliminate everything, just the things in your life that you feel hinder you or get you into more trouble.  Good luck!!  Hope I helped.|`|y2Uks58paa	The adrenaline and endorphins you get from doing things with risk. Its kind of like your personal high. Its the same kind of high runners get after a run, or a body builder gets after a workout. You addicted to the feelings, well at least your brain is. Find another way to get your kicks, thats pretty simple|`|K3NxiEKJaa	I think you need professional help before you go kill someone for the thrill of it.|`|ac5mKd4caa	Im 19 and i know what you're saying... Its as if the risks and thrils that once used to scare me just feel normal now, because im so used to it. You're old enough to judge and make decisions that are best for you, i think you're still at that stage where you want to get it out of your system and have a good time... But i think you should get it out of your system before the system screws you over.. There's a line that needs to be drawn and i hope you know where that line is
7QaASZzEaa	LOL she prolly didnt really notice. dont make an issue out of it. just let her keep it|`|ALXOZzssaa	LOL, this is hilarious!

If he doesn't get the message, find another friend.
3irrWRUWaa	It doesn't matter what race you are; it happens to a lot of parents in all kinds of backgrounds. all three of my kids slept in the bed with me. the oldest sleeps in his own bed but the two younger ones is hard to get them to sleep in their bed.the youngest one gets up in the middle of the night and gets back in the bed with me while i'm sleep.|`|DsgNMpEsaa	I slept with my (single) mother until I was 5. (:  I'm american btw.|`|gP0gYbBaaa	im a white american.  when i was little my parents wouldnt let me in their bet no matter how scared i was. i always slept alone. im 16 now.  my sister always slept w. them. shes 11 now and wont sleep alone.|`|odj23SKzaa	The reason i bet the married woman does not want the kid with them is because the toddlers get the habit of that and it is VERY hard to get rid of it so what my aunt did to make my seven year old cousin to stop getting in the bed with her and my uncle, is getting my cousin a new race car bed,(which was expensive) And also, what if they want alone time? You cannot have alone time with your child sleeping.
cCymTwdcaa	My mister proposed with a gorgeous necklace, and a short time later presented me with a ring. We had discussed ring styles, but nothing beyond that. It was important to us both for the ring to come from him, and to be a surprise. After all, it's a gift, and I have never picked out any of the other gifts he's given me. As it turned out, he chose the VERY one I wanted without so much as a hint form me =]  The kind of jewelry she usually wears, or enlisting a friend to help in choosing, would be a good way of choosing something she would like.|`|wncxhyf0aa	well now days there are many options you can choose the ring, she can choose one with you, you can buy the diamond and she picks the setting. sadly its not as easy as it was a decade ago lol. But if you have a fair idea what she would like, I'd go with that (as you asking her to marry you is a way better gift than receiving the ring) and I'm sure she would love it no matter what as it is from you :)|`|5412173baed2a21884761c1f6bde287baa	I picked out my ring. I found it and immediately knew it was the ring I wanted and so I told my then boyfriend. He later thanked me because it took the pressure off of him worrying about if I would like the ring or not. He showed me what he would've got if left to his own devices and I would've liked that one too, but I had sort of already fallen in love with the ring I eventually got.    Every woman is different, but choosing my own ring certainly didn't make it any less special to me.|`|btNUf7rcaa	my fiance wanted to pick out my engagement ring and i thought that was sweet, we went to a jewelry store one time and i told him, so what would you pick? and he showed me and i smiled lol because i didnt like any of them! I mean, they were "pretty" but not what I would have liked at all. So i ended up picking my own ring, because its such an expensive purchase and i really wanted to love it from day 1. No point in paying so much for something you dont like, or like a little bit, you need to love it!|`|pQCod7aOaa	I would want it to be a surprise, but I would definatly be giving my boyfriend hints on what I like if we were in a serious relationship.|`|yD3x1dzyaa	i think you should pick it, it would mean a lot to her knowing its from her man and no one else. the ring means a lot to the girl, it represent your love for her, so does the wedding ring:)|`|3y5oA67Waa	My advice is just buy the rock (diamond) and let your wife to be choose the setting.. You will be the best,wonderful man who broke all traiditions !! PS; Make her yours  Forever , at least 7/8 cts|`|W8lQ2g9Gaa	Dude, you should never ask the woman's help in an engagement ring. Unless in casual talk u ask what type of diamonds she likes or she never wanted a diamond in her ring when she thought about marriage.  Dont make it seem obvious. But if you have an idea of what to get, think a few times about it.|`|NoQSMahJaa	I agree wth 'mis' and if you're stil struggling 2 make a desiscion maybe ask her best friends opinion!! Congratulations on the engagement!!! x|`|CnLL5ENmaa	I would want a big say in it. She can tell you the style she likes andall, but she may not like the setting, or how high it sticks up, theres a lot of factors.|`|duSFnHeQaa	shiny and diamonds all im saying ;)|`|93a3cd690b6ab97234e9c87b1716e25baa	I will say that when I was in that situation, I really wanted to have a big say in what ring I would get. (after all, the girl will be wearing this ring for a very long time so she needs to like it) I wanted to narrow it down to the two or maybe three rings I loved the most and then let him decide on which one to surprise me with. My boyfriend actually went ahead and picked one after just a short time of looking at rings. I was really kind of worried, because I knew I hadn't found any that I truly loved yet. He wouldn't change his mind or budge b/c he had found the one HE thought was perfect. Had we stayed together and actually gotten engaged, I hope he would have let me have more of a say in my ring. The thought of receiving one that I didn't truly love was hard, but I'm sure I would have been thankful for any ring that he picked I suppose :)|`|n4d7rqr4aa	In my ideal world, my future fiance would ask a friend to talk about it (subtly, of course!) so that he doesn't pick out something completely not my style, but I'm still surprised.  The friend would transition smoothly into the topic, and be like "You and (insert name) are pretty serious, eh?  You think he's the one?"  and the conversation would stem from there.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	I wanted a choice in the ring. My husband did things pretty much exactly how I would have wanted him to do it. One day when we were out in the mall, he suggested we try things on so he could get an idea of what I liked in the future.    Then, afterward I emailed him pictures of rings that I liked. I picked from among the ones I sent him and had one custom made for me.|`|82023d32c67aacffdd25314a33b1ea50aa	Let her pick a few rings out, and then you make the final decision on another day.  That way both of you played a part, and she's still surprised.|`|AA11791157	That's a tough one.  If you know for sure what she likes, then I would just pick one out, but if you have doubts that she will like it, then I would have her help pick it out.  My sister just go engaged and she absolutely hates the ring that her fiancee bought her (he designed it himself) and there is no way that she would ever say that she didn't like it to him.  Good luck!|`|AA11315360	Well you just need to know if she likes round diamonds or square (princess cut) diamonds. Ask someone close to her (female) that knows her very well.   Then get a BRIDAL/WEDDING set. It is an engagement ring that comes with the matching wedding ring. It saves you money than buying them separately.      Or go to a store and pick out several bridal sets (like 4) and tell the manager you will bring her back at a set time and date and then have the manager hide the prices. And show her those 4 you picked and say "pick one from these 4 that you like" And ask will you marry me?|`|94464c65a3cf331abd994f1207860d7eaa	Talk to her friends! Girls discuss this kind of thing with their friends. I, for instance, KNOW what I like, and it's a little off-beat. I personally don't like princess cut diamonds. I'd really like to have a marquise or oval diamond, which is not what you typically see on an engagement ring. I also really want a SMALL stone - absolutely no bigger than 3/4 of a carat, and preferably smaller.     All of my close girlfriends, and my mother, know this. My boyfriend will probably ask them for help with the time comes, because he knows my friends, and they will be able to tell him. So it will be a surprise for me but I'll still get what I want! =]|`|v3niqZyAaa	It would mean more to her if you picked it out. But, keep in mind--get a wedding set. It's easier in the long run!|`|k4tf49Phaa	I just got engaged myself and my fiance was intent on picking it out himself. So we went preliminary shopping just to get ideas - he picked out a few rings he thought i'd like and it turns out he has really terrible taste. he was so freaked out that i hated everything he picked that i ended up picking it out myself. if he had good taste, i'd have been fine with him picking but it's pointless for him to spend that much money if we have such different taste and i'd likely end up not liking it|`|zdWJUWk8aa	This may not work for you, but as an idea to throw out there. If you are unsure what to get, but you do not want to let her know what you are doing, you could always propose to her in front of a jewelry store (with her back to it, so she didn't know where she was, or casually walking by one in a little place in town that you guys like) Then tell her to pick out which one she wanted :) You could also warn the jewelry store ahead of time and tell them to pull out some from the case for her to look at that fit in your budget so that you could avoid the whole " That's not an option". Whatever you do, I'm sure she will be happy and excited. This is an idea if you are really stuck, that will still really surprise her.|`|61b0b3e188a7a3a5fc593f37ab4e74fdaa	A great way to find out what type of ring she likes is to stop by a reputable jeweler at your local mall with her. If you are trying to be discreet consider, looking through the internet, or bridal magazines. Another great way to choose a ring is to find out what she likes is to talk with her girlfriends or her family members
Kt1fTwCLaa	to get out of the awkwardness you probably be best just laughing it off.  Or just say something like "gee- you get along" just something funny sarcastic.  :)|`|LrAw9Hpqaa	I excuse myself and leave for a while or permanently.|`|bPI0wAk1aa	Use that time to take a dump.
ViZrWDtvaa	do you trust her? if so let her go, if not then just dump her anyway. If you can't trust the person you're with, whether or not you love them, then its not worth it.|`|tEEMpfFtaa	Your a boy , naturally were all jealous when our gf's go to partys but you have to not let this get to you and make her see that you trust her even if you dont , because if you do then eventually you will start to trust her alot and if you dont then you shouldnt be together anyway , just let her feel that you trust that your the only one she likes :) otherwise you being jealous to her could look to her like your trying to control her and no your not a bad person every guy thinks the same    hope i helped :)|`|fNrcy0ifaa	it you love her as much as you say you do then you should be able to trust her.  and if she were to cheat on you then that means she doesnt love you enough and you deserve much better|`|vq5LQ7pCaa	The question is do you trust her?  Does she have a history of cheating on past boyfriends?    if you do trust her and she doesn't have a past of cheating on her boyfriends I think you have nothing to worry about|`|kzCHA1cFaa	If she's a party girl I'm sure it's hard to stop her.  But no, that doens't make you a bad person at all.  You are just thinking of how amazing she is and all the guys that'll wanna get with her.   I don't think it is particularly right to go to a party you weren't invited to  but if you really don't want her to go alone that bad   you should go as her date  when you ask someone to something   it's generally implied that you can birng your significant other.  Especially if a guy invited her  that means he either wants to hook up or has a freind for her  so if you go with her   you can supervise her  and her perimeter so guys cant get too close.|`|DS5GoOnQaa	No matter the reason. If her partying hurts you that bad to the point where you feel like it will tear yall apart and you told her and she didnt care to compromise. Then it probably isn't worth it. BUT it isn't good to give ppl ultimatums though, it may backfire|`|TnWrfbzXaa	You should either let her go party and if she loves you she'll change. Or ask her what is more important..her parties or your love. She can't have both without everyone being happy. If she's not willing to change its her own fault..because if she won't change she'll regret it when shes drunk at a party and her boyfriend isn't there to go pick her up.  she'll realize she lost out.|`|IGeYlBHJaa	You're not a bad person and your not being insecure!  You just don't want to look like a little ***** and get cheated on.  The fact that you dont trust her at a party by her self should tell you something.  Dont go spy on her like some stalker... That's lame!  Just trust your gut feeling...it may be harsh but its always right!!! Just for the the record every girlfriend i let go to parties alone ended up cheating on me at them.  Good Luck!!!|`|qfSCcyySaa	You are being way to insecure. Just let her go. You can't expect to be with her every moment. Just let her have some fun and go out with your own friends too.|`|NDr5DMxQaa	let her go party if u love each other that much u can trust each other that much!!|`|n0BjDJqraa	let her go and spy on her......gets em everytime....jsu dont let her catch u   cause she will flip it and make you the bad guy|`|PbDaxHZtaa	breaj up with her i guess. she obviously doesnt care if your relationship goes down the toilet.|`|PylZ74Z1aa	im afraid you are a bad person im sorry to have to break it to you.|`|AxPzYjvraa	well according to my calculations.

If she cared about ur relationship at all then she would listen to u and agree with u wen u guys tlked about it.|`|AA11307468	Do you trust her?  If so, what are you afraid of?  If not, why are you even with her?|`|109a6dfea08822c4b720a3d5f9fa6b9eaa	Amko,    This is tough. I understand your feelings completely. It is threatening enough having a partner who is putting herself in an inhibition-free environment when she is away from you...but going to parties (plural) to which you are not invited? Sounds like she is either needing space, or selfish or addicted or some combination of the three.     You don't want to break up but the relationship is not very high on her list of priorities right now. No amount of "explaining" is going to change this. Take the opposite tact: Let her do her thing while you pursue something that you really like that doesn't involve her in any way.     Maybe she will wake up and smell the coffee, drink some, and sober up, or maybe she won't. If not, breaking off from her will be easier for having reclaimed some of your independence.    Hope this has helped.|`|9o7KlfvKaa	Are you sure you aren't being a little too possessive? She's a party-er and you aren't. Can you put that behind you? Do you trust her?|`|76835e9a544163134ce35716229cd8f0aa	you need to stop being so over protective and let her breathe kuss if you dont i assure you it wont take long for u to lose her..you can't expect to change a person..you need to trust her otherwise whats the point in having a relationship..|`|JoaIqg0laa	You can't hold her down because you can't keep her from being someone that she is not.  That will tear you apart and leave a scar.  You are insecure and perhaps depend too much on her for your happiness.  If she's going to parties and cheating on you then thats one thing but she probaly just wanst to have fun. Try and show her you want to have fun with her, take her places and/or take her to other parties r bring the party home.  If you love something you cant hold on too tightly because youll crush it...let it go and if she loves you, shell stick around.  But losen up...spend time doing things both of you enjoy|`|KCucX9JPaa	If she can't get used to the fact that you'd rather she not party without you, and you insist on her not partying, then it's obvious you both don't deserve each other. While I agree with others here that you seem possessive, I also believe that if she loved you enough, she'd listen to you. It's a lose lose situation here, you let her party, you lose, you get her to stay, she loses. If you can't compromise, you need to either break up, or at least separate for a while until you can trust each other again.
2keIEMFUaa	I feel that you need to find a lawyer over there because me or anybody else who is not an attorney can not give you legal advise.  sorry! I wish I could help more other than tell you and your wife to seek council
AA10693260	Michelle, if you have the courage to discuss is on this forum then, obviously, you will also be able to discuss the same to your husband to be. He should be the most trusted person for you. So, go ahead, and just say the truth that you have found those bikinis and swimsuits, and you do not feel that you can carry them in public.<br>  <br>  Initially, he may try to talk you into it, but once he understands, he would not insist. Trust me, I have a shy wife too.|`|6cpx0eZOaa	if u feel so strongly about it, tell him u cant put it on! however, try to put them on if u can manage it. it wont kill u!|`|D2g0XSLTaa	Where are you going on your honeymoon?<br>  <br>  Most women don't like their bodies.  You husband loves you and your body.  You might think they are skimpy or inappro[riate, but when you are down in the islands and the sun is warming your body, you will see.  <br>  <br>  Ask him.   You put away his ironing normally and not snooping were you?  Tell him you found them, love the thought but they are not you.  Go to the store and get something that is you.  <br>  <br>  Unless they were for someone else.  Congratulations!|`|fnBPI4OAaa	You have a good figure, chill out. You'll look great. Maybe wear board shorts/a loose top if you're on the beach in a bikini. Trust me, act confident and no-one will know the wiser. Your husband will appreciate your self-confidence and will find you sexier. Maybe reserve the bikini for just you guys in private?<br>  Compromise but feel comfortable. But don't be afraid to try new things and push yourself.|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	Wel, if you are too shy to confront him about it...<br>  <br>  Just give him a hint: "Gosh, our honeymoon is coming up, and I need to buy a new swimsuit.  It's just so hard to find swimsuits that I like.  I don't think I could ever wear one of those little string bikinis that all the stores sell.  I would be so uncomfortable."|`|z2cysiEhaa	Explain?<br>  You shouldn't have to explain anything. Just tell him that you find wearing those types of garments uncomfortable and they are not your thing - full stop.<br>  If he tries to talk you into it ask him if he'll wear a mankini like Borat or a male g-string in public?<br>  I doubt he would?|`|yt4RRTkpaa	He obviously wants to show you off or else he would've bought you lingerie and other "bedroom wear".  You should take it as a compliment :) ..  But I think you should just be blunt with him because you are getting married and communication is key.  Maybe tell him to get you lingerie and stuff instead so you can still look sexy in front of him without 1000 other pairs of eyes staring.|`|fWBLCPX2aa	Be frank with your husband to be.  tell him what you like and what you do not like, he too  should tell you what he like and don't like be fair to each other, do not panick. Marriage is a life time journey if you pretend you will be caught up in the middle, start it now.|`|7Yzgoowkaa	both of u r correct, but dont say no. at least u can wear them in private. and may be u may be going to a place where evryone is wearing those so u may not feel awkward there.

Not much else to do. Hanging onto hate will only bring you resentment. Don't expect the website you joined to bring you comfort. Lean on real friends for that part.

The reason she didn't know is because his wife and kids lived up in Connecticut, but he also had an apartment in New York City which she had stayed at many times. They both traveled a lot with work, so usually didn't see each other more than twice a week. The way she found out is when she called him at work, which she used to do, and his assistant picked up and asked how the planning was going for their 5 year old's birthday party (assuming my friend was his wife)<br>  <br>  You are feeling guilty, but you have nothing to feel guilty about. You didn't do anything wrong. He duped you and lied to you. It's normal to feel upset about any breakup, even when the guy is a jerk. It's good that you are in therapy and time will eventually heal this. It's not going to be easy and you might have problems trusting other men for a while.|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	Ok ... you've asked for what you do to get over someone. I have your answer.<br>  <br>  Are you ready?<br>  <br>  First, you need to know that there is no closure. Even if you went to his home and destroyed his car, it won't make you feel any better, and you'll probably end up in jail because someone will hear and see you. Even if you wrote him a letter and poured out your anger, bitterness, vitriol and resentment all over it, and he read it and wrote back saying he's sorry again ... what purpose would it serve? <br>  <br>  There is no closure - other than focusing on your future. To that end, here's how to get over this pig who broke you heart and committed adultery, and who made you commit it, too (even though you didn't know it):<br>  <br>  The next time you start thinking gooey thoughts about him and start to miss him, you need to vividly imagine him in the throes of passionate, hot pleasure ... on top of his wife ... AND LOVING IT. You have to remember all the lies he told you, how little he respected you and what a slimeball he is for doing this to you. <br>  <br>  You have to get angry.<br>  <br>  WHY AREN'T YOU ANGRY YET !?!!?!?<br>  <br>  You should miss this jerk about as much as you miss a migraine. Your entire relationship - from the first hello to the last good-bye - WAS A LIE. You were his lie. He used you - plain and simple.<br>  <br>  Somewhere inside of you, there's some strength. Tap into that strength and get over this lying, cheating, selfish, disrespectful ape. Right now, you still sound weak, which is understandable because you didn't know it - but sincerely, you've got to get mad. Once you become mad and angry, it's easier to deal with because you can direct it somewhere. <br>  <br>  You need to get this d**kh**d out of your system, and I am, in fact, going to suggest finding a way to stay busy, like volunteering somewhere. Shelter for abused women? Hospital reading to the elderly? Soup kitchen? Working with animals, perhaps? Do you exercise? Maybe taking more walks would be a good idea.<br>  <br>  WHY AREN'T YOU ANGRY YET ?!?! <br>  <br>  You might also consider a few sessions with a therapist, or someone in the clergy if you're religious, to find out why you didn't see it. There (I swear to you) are always signs, and you need to find out why you missed them this time, so you can recognize them and avoid this next time it happens.<br>  <br>  *big hug*<br>  <br>  Best of luck, hon|`|nBQeSu2faa	I can understand this must have come as a terrible shock. The only thing I can say to you is...count your blessings..you had a very narrow escape..this man was a nasty, mean, totally selfish , and very disrespectful to you and his wife. It's going to take time to get over this but you will get over it, and you will learn from it...remember it will pass.<br>  It's important to stop going over it in your head , it doesn't serve any purpose at all..in fact it will  only serve to lock you into his betrayal...you must remember if he did this to his wife then you should  have  no doubt he would have cheated on you somewhere down the line.  His wife would not have made him do anything if he had really loved you...it was just a big game to him, a distraction from his life as a husband... If he didn't want to be with his wife , he have got a divorce but sadly he wanted the best of both worlds and you happened to be part of his game. Find a way to stop yourself going over and over and over this betrayal ...it's not going to happen over night but it will happen if you work hard at it.|`|Zca1PGERaa	gosh thats shocking you must feel so lied to and cheated - of course you miss him he was part of your life and suddenly he has disappeared out of it. But no woman needs a man to make her happy concentrate on yourself and have a look at the talent keep yourself busy.|`|ZvtNQTELaa	Go to his house slash his tires and break his windsheild it works wonders|`|EQW734wQaa	Hi Jem, tough thing you went through<br>  you're like slammed for being the other woman, you feel like you've been thrown away by a man you loved...and all the time, you were just trying to be a good person<br>  <br>  Well, forget those women at the infidelity group, they're idiots for not trying to understand! They probably are mad you didn't figure out any clues for 1 year he was taken! BUT a really sly man could pull it off<br>  <br>  That sly man probably talked his wife into you were the one who seduced him and he'll never do it<br>  He kisses her butt because he probably can't afford a divorce<br>  Hell yeah, she made him cut all contact with you!!!!!<br>  He's probably scared to see you now!<br>  <br>  Men like him are king jerks!<br>  He'll do it again to his wife, he doesn't love her!!! But he feels trapped!<br>  <br>  <br>  Of course you feel pain, you truly loved and found you were duped by a con artist AND you ended up hurting and angering another woman!<br>  <br>  You need therapy to talk about this and be reminded you were the victim!!! But tricky situation!<br>  <br>  Let yourself heal and get back out there again. Don't let one stupid con man get the rest of your life. It can happen to any of us!!!!!<br>  The man who conned me turned out to be a level 2 sex offender who raped two minors and he put his urine and blood in my drinks when I didn't know AND he was married! So crap happens. I moved on and got a new bf, 6 years now - it has some problems but it isn't bad at all.<br>  <br>  Yes when it happened, I wanted to jump in front of a car. But the old sex offender got a stroke and partially paralyzed so crap eventually catches up to people!|`|Q2MLikeUaa	Sweetheart I am sorry you have to go through something like this, but take comfort in the knowledge that he will not be going back to a comfortable life with his wife, believe me she will make him pay and if she has any sense at all she will make him suffer for a long time to come. It is right when they say you have to do what you have to do to get through this, so if it makes you feel better send her a letter, telling her all the things he said to you, for instance about being single, it may exercise your 'ghosts' and it will certainly add to her armoury when she starts to make him pay. I wish someone would have done that for me. One thing you have to remember sweetheart is that we cannot choose who we fall in love with and sometimes we end up getting hurt, but there are many men out there and they are not all like this one, you will eventually find someone who will love and cherish you as you rightly deserve. Good luck to youxx|`|WzKrZoHQaa	Actually this happened to a dear friend of mine some years ago.  He was the nicest guy and very considerate towards her.  Her father was in Police and this guy used to say that he respected her and her parents too much to have her out all night (wouldn't do her reputaion any good etc)  so she was home around midnight - 1am.  They were together for approx 18 months.  He had own bungalow and there was nothing female about it at all when they got together.  He was 9 yrs older than her but it didn't seem to matter.  Then one day she had a visit at the bungalow from his "wife" and the twin boys aged 10 months old !!!   I remember that phone call even now.  The shock was unbelieveable - we all asked same thing - but you must have suspected something.  No not at all.  He used her father and the so called "respect" approach to hide the fact that he had to go home to his wife everynight didn't he?   The wife thought he was working a second job but it was a friend of hers that saw him out with her and the wife then started to do some of her own investigating and traced him back to this bungalow and her own family home (she was 20 had a good job and lived at home)<br>  <br>  So yes it can and does happen.  You cannot change what has happened my dear and I'm really trying hard not to type any cliches here as well.  But you do need to get a grip - my friend went to 6 stone and took ages to get over him - it was just awful so please I know you are feeling awful but what is done is done - No going back.  If you know where he lives then write to the wife and get yr side of the story over.  Send it Recorded Delivery so you know she gets it.  She has right to know YOUR side too not just his lying cheating side.<br>  <br>  Can you move away and make fresh start ?  New job, new area etc?  Spring is round the corner and that is start of new fresh life - my heart goes out to you Hun.  Work is the way forward so brush off that CV and get yourself out there looking for new area.  It is over and is now in the history vault I'm afraid.  You can surely see if he cheated in this way do you honestly want a tosser like this in yr life?  NO YOU DESERVE FAR BETTER|`|claUGpVRaa	You know, my ex cheated on me as soon as I told him I was pregnant and is still with this 'other woman' now. (We have formally split now)<br>  I often wonder what he has actually told her, and what she thinks as I am full of blame for her too, which is possibly not right I know.<br>  Men are deceitful and you have been well and truly duped by him.<br>  He has chosen the coward route and has ut contact to make his life easier so his wife forgives him. I'm sure his wife is suffering too on finding out he was cheating and now he is behaving pathetically.<br>  Getting over him will be difficult as you really didn't know about him being married. You are worth more than him, so do what I have done to my ex, get revenge on him. Publically humiliate him as the jerk he is. Then try focusing on everything else in your life and try and move forward. You will get there in the end but only when your head is ready for it.|`|fyKFnxCnaa	Well sister, take comfort that he is more the likely not going home to his cozy, happy little home and wife.<br>  <br>  This is going to take them years to get over.  If they ever do.<br>  <br>  I am willing to bet that his wife will make him pay for this much longer then it will hurt you.<br>  <br>  Since you really didn't know that he was married - then take comfort that you really didn't do anything wrong.... and don't worry about being "the other woman" - because you didn't know.<br>  <br>  You trusted someone and that is a natural instinct.<br>  <br>  People want to see the good in other people.<br>  <br>  So, that leaves you with the hurt of leaving your boyfriend.  The betrayal and lies.<br>  <br>  You have to face it as a breakup.  Someone hurt you and you have to work on healing yourself.<br>  <br>  That can involve a lot of things.<br>  <br>  Talking about it number one.<br>  <br>  Which you are doing right now.<br>  <br>  Confide in friends and family.  Maybe counseling.<br>  <br>  I mean - painful break-ups are just that.<br>  Painful.  You have to work through it.<br>  <br>  You will miss him because you had someone you cared about and all of a sudden they are gone.<br>  <br>  But not to sound cliche' but you have to do what you have to do to get over it.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry that you are going through this, but don't beat yourself up about any other woman crap!!!!!|`|q4tTabfjaa	A year is a long time, but thank God you are out of the situation now.  It could have been longer and maybe children too.  <br>  Yes you will miss him and look online for how to get through this grief. <br>  After all you have to see that it is dead now, but you are alive and have a wonderful future.  You just can't see it at the moment.<br>  You are rid of a horrible liar.|`|AA11814313	As the wife of a needy man...I can tell you they r never happy...they need and need and need till all the kids needing and the husbands needing gets too much...That gives them the excuse of my wife doesn't understand me...it should read I need a mummy.<br>  <br>  This guy lied to you (he doesn't respect you)<br>  He is married (he doesn't keep his word)<br>  He is a cheat (normally a person who has no self respect or control)<br>  u deserve better.<br>  Get out and meet people who r available you deserve that.|`|AFFmSyhTaa	I am so sorry for the betrayal you have encountered. During my last huge breakup I found that I am in control of my feelings. Sounds crazy for you now I know. This is how I started.... Everytime I would think sweet thoughts about him the next thought had to be- Yes, I may love him, but he does not love me, if he did he would not have lied to me. If he cheated on her to be with me then he  will cheat on me if he were mine. I deserve better. I deserve someone that loves me for me and only me.  Do not allow sweet thoughts about him. He lied to you. Took advantage of your feelings and emotions. Everytime a sweet thought comes to mind think about the betrayal and pain he cause you. That you refuse to accept this, you are better then that.He played with your mind.  Say to yourself," I will not think about this." over and over as much as necessary. My mother taught me to take it one second at a time. Then one minute at a time. Then eventually it will be one day at a time and so forth.. I promise it will. Also, another thing that helps is to remove anything that reminds you of him. Anything he bought you. You don't have to throw it away, but at least put it out of sight for the time being. Move around your future. I know this sounds nuts, but again, my mother did this for me and it helped a bunch.  It wasn't you. None of this was your fault. He is and always will be a cheating player. I know it does not feel like it now, but one day you will think how blessed you are that you are not his wife. He will cheat on her again. You deserve someone to be faithful to you and only you. You will find another man. One that is better. Give your heart time to heal. And remember repeat these things over and over again. Yes, I suppose it is a bit of brain washing oneself but it worked wonders for me. I hope this helps in someway and again I am so, so, sorry for your pain. It will ease.|`|GuNBgiEWaa	don't you think that you should be angry at him for lying to you and disgusted with yourself being such a fool?<br>  <br>  the only thing you said about being mad gave me the impression you are only pissed because he went home instead of to you.  that kind of thing makes it hard for me to be sympathetic along with the fact that even if you were clueless before, you know what's up now-and you still want to be with him.<br>  don't you think that you deserve more?  don't you think that guy's kids deserve more?   i doubt that you were the first or the last for him, so do yourself a favor and forget about him.<br>  respect yourself and find a man you know is available|`|SOv6I9Wfaa	Well, here's an off the wall suggestion. There's one person who understands what you're going through better than anyone, and that's the wife. Both of you loved this man and were lied to and cheated on. You know his address - why not send her a letter explaining that you didn't know he was married? Seems to me you've got nothing to lose - and if you're looking for revenge, nothing would be scarier for him, I think, than to know that the two of you were exchanging confidences.|`|UDInHk0jaa	I feel your pain.  My heart goes out to you.  It is rather annoying to hear "take up a hobby" or "keep yourself busy", etc.  You have much healing to do for so many different reasons (end of a relationship, trust issues, confusion, feeling used...), but only you know how you can start the healing process that is best for you.  It is not easy and will take some time depending on you...everyone is different.  Counseling can help some.<br>  <br>  Please, don't feel ashamed in any way as you did not know...it is not your fault.  You keep your chin up no matter how hard it is.  I know you miss him, but remember what he is (liar, cheat, coward) and what he has done to you as well ashis family.  You don't need nor do you deserve anyone like that!!!  Just remember those words every time you feel down/sad.  Your eyes are wide open now.  I wish you the best.  Take care of yourself.|`|e02a5360b1712f5d02d32dc18794063caa	Sorry to hear that,<br>  but do be strong for yourself.<br>  Its normal for you to miss him, after all you had loved him for the past 1 year or so.  if u dun miss him, you won't need to be in this state of mind anyway.<br>  <br>  accept the fact that he is gone,  move on with ur life.<br>  i'm sure you can find someone who really deserve you.<br>  <br>  best wishes|`|iogL3GFVaa	You have already taken the first step to recovery by asking for help. You still have feelings for him, which is natural, you were the one that was dumped. But you do have to realize that this man used you. You need to get over him quickly and then you need to find someone else to place your feelings on. My uncle said that the best way to mend a broken heart is to give it some one new. I have used that advice and I found that it worked. You have to let go of the jerk though. The thought of him and wanting him will ruin your next relationship if you don't let him go.

It should matter whats on the inside rather than what he can do. <br>  Second a man that can cook any one knows would treat you better than a guy that can dance cause the dancer would most likely dance with ANY ONE and that would not look good. so therefore a man that can cook is so much better.|`|QAGaQUDRaa	The way to MY heart is through my stomach, so a guy who can cook has a much better chance.

xIB7Aujdaa	awesum 3sum!|`|4UAZ6O2Daa	I'm sorry to have to say this to you, but you're going to have to choose before you lose them both.|`|3e0IjGsYaa	You're close to the line of cheating when it comes to this - that is, if your current bf doesn't know what you're doing, and visa versa (meaning, this new guy doesn't know about your bf).<br>  <br>  It's all about personal preference I guess, but I personally wouldn't do it. I will say that when I was younger, i DID do it. At the time, it was fun, but in the long run, not only did it hurt the two guys, but it also ended up hurting me too, because they both left, as well as leaving emotional scars.<br>  <br>  If you're considering doing this, just a few things. I think you need to sit down with your current bf, and tell him that even though you love him, you need a break from him, some time to figure things out. I would let him down as easy as possible. Maybe you should consider asking him how he feels about an open relationship, and seeing other people. He may surprise you by telling you that he's been having similar feelings. This is something you definitely need to think about before just jumping into something...remember, the grass is ALWAYS greener on the other side of the fence...but once you switch, the grass sometimes turns brown, and isn't as attractive as you thought...and then when you go to jump back to the side you were on, that person may have done moved on.<br>  <br>  Take your time and think about what you're doing. You also need to tell this new guy that you have a boyfriend. Perhaps you two should enjoy friendship first before jumping into something that you may regret later down the road. Above all else, you need to be 1) Honest with your current bf, 2) Honest with this other guy, and most importantly 3) Be honest with yourself!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	if you are talking about about real love, i think it's wrong to love 2 people at the same time. if you wanna love someone truly, you should just love one and one person only and that is your boyfriend. the guys that loves you can continue on what he's doing, but i personally think you should stay away from him.|`|udsWW6y5aa	If this helps you answer, if I was your boyfriend I'd be pretty pissed if you were with another guy, even if you told me.|`|4QiUnFMgaa	let him kno... duhh|`|LnibEXzHaa	no. unless they are ur kids/family. duh! dun be greedy. wld u want ur bf to love 2 girls at the same time? see who u love more. u can't have divided love.

If you've only talked to him a couple of times in the three or four years you've known him, he probably doesn't know you all that well. Get to know him a little better and maybe you will realize if you truly like him, or if it was just his looks/kindness you were attracted to. Also, make sure he doesn't already have another woman in his life, you don't want to accidentally mess up something he already may have going. One more thing is that he may have to be nice to you when you ask for help because that may be a part of his job duty that he needs to fill. On the plus side, if you do start talking to him more and get to know each other a little better he may start liking you too. I'm not saying that this will definitely happen, but it is a possibility. Whatever you decide, you must decide fast though. If he is leaving in a few months, and you want to know him, than you need to use this time wisely. On the other hand if you decide you don't want to do this, that's ok too. Another guy will probably come your way, and who knows, maybe it will work out better. Remember, everything always happens for a reason! I wish you luck with all this and may it work out in your favor!

ihxUZI3Haa	Well I'm in a long distance relationship&I trust my boyfriend. Obviously not 100% though.. <br>  <br>  Things he's done to allow me to trust him are:<br>  - Randomly texts me.. <br>  - Calls me a lot..<br>  - Has female friends. (I can trust him around girls)<br>  - Introduces me to his friends<br>  - Tells people I'm his girlfriend<br>  - Opens up to me<br>  - Wants me to be with him.. (At night, Through the day)<br>  - Wants to treat me. <br>  - Hasn't used the L word falsely <br>  - Doesn't lie to me. <br>  <br>  There just some of the thing my boyfriend does in order for me to trust him. Although you should never trust your partner 100% until your both in love with each other.. As s/he may start taking advantage of you. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped.. :)|`|x7uYAPaSaa	I trusted mine. Its the fact that he came out with he has girls that are friends, and he is going to go out with them. He just reasured me that he wouldnt cheat. I remembered his saying. 'never have, never will' I think it all depends on the person to be honest. He was honest with me, i was honest with him, and we asked questions like that at the start of our relationship|`|eXSy6IwMaa	for me, i dont really 100% trust him.. coz, we are both far away from each other.. what we only have is the communication.. trough cp, chat or to watsoever.. i think its about 70-30%. 70% dont trust him and 30% trust him.. we dont know what is our whereabouts.. and, i cant look out for him, coz he far away..|`|Mubj1o2eaa	Well, if you love someone and they love you, you just have to trust them. I have a long distanceboyfriend, and I trust him because we love eachother :} Good luck :}|`|lT6WBaWIaa	that thing with long-distance relationships is the idea that one day, you will eventually meet, and you will be inseparable from that day on.|`|CCTjTMQgaa	yes, because if he promise something, and someone told me that he didn't do his promise real, then I'll broke up with him. if it's for the fifth time he did it.|`|D9QLM6sRaa	If you really love him, you should trust him.<br>  " I'm in the same situation ".|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	yes i do because he has earned my trust.
Gb8cl8n2aa	just wait 4 her answer..but i really think she ist intrested in you for now..|`|xIB7Aujdaa	dude! wht a long ques. i m feelin sleepy...zzz|`|PHC2gnjwaa	I can fully relate to that. My girlfriend is going through the same stage, only we have been dating for only 4 months, but we are both deeply in love (real love). She started to question our relationship, and the only problem that she is bringing up is that she and I have different religion. And I came to a concusion if you have a different religion, then you have a different view on world, and life. If you wanna know I am an Atheist, and she is a strong Christian<br>  My suggestion for you would be, just give her some time, give her space. You guys been together for 2 years, try to remind her of all the good times you spent together. Get her those flowers that you got her on her first valentine’s day. Remind her that you love her, not how you love her now. But how obssed you were with her when you first met. Talk about the time of how you met, how you first kissed, how passionate you were during your first sex, makeout, etc. <br>  <br>  JUST REMIND HER WHY SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU
wfhO2Iapaa	all you can really do is wait for them to break up...if you make your crush break up with somebody, and he truly likes that person, he may need time to get over the relationship...If he breaks up with the girl when he is ready to do so, then things will probably turn out better.|`|JHMK2g6taa	nasty rumor, or it tell him how you feel mabey he'll brake up with her <br>  ps: who looks better|`|uqSpDgy9aa	And then have him come to you after he breaks up with his gf? So that he can end up leaving YOU in the future for someone else? Because that is what will happen. If he is willing to leave his gf for you then he will be willing to leave you for someone else, too. This is a very dangerous road you're going down. Tread carefully.|`|lT6WBaWIaa	try to make the guy become uninterested in the girl, or vice versa.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	that's not very nice you know. if you succeeded in breaking them up, one day it will get back at you.
O3EtP4vOaa	The left 2 girls look like they are fun.  But they all look nice!|`|Gb8cl8n2aa	the blond girl in the middle|`|tpfj8XJoaa	the one on the very left|`|0Ey2UpE6aa	Bottom row, third from the right. Her smile is adorable =)|`|71VRvldJaa	The one who took the picture!|`|Po2UqfvWaa	the one on the way left with the big mouth. don't think that means best laugh cuz i can hear a picture. just a big mouth. lol
dwhPolzbaa	you can't turn gay, its not like a disease you catch, it just something you are.<br>  If you haven't had a gf yet it doesn't mean that you won't have one in the future, to be honest your still young and im sure that in the next few years you'll have plenty of chance to kiss a girl. i didn't have my first kiss until i was 15 and now im in a happy and completely normal relationship. don't worry to much at the moment it will happen soon.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Yep! You should start shopping for some leather pants! :)|`|pM4OJ4iwaa	Normal: ur past the stage of turning gay really.|`|Ks0BrqHBaa	wow for one your WAY over reacting. your not even in high school yet and your freaking out about not having a gf and never kissing anyone. im sorry but you should be worrying about more things than your sexuality at 14. you have a whole lifetime to figure that out. and no that doesn't mean your going to be gay when you grow up! that's just ridiculous. i didn't kiss anyone until i was almost 16 and im fine. im as straight as a pole!|`|udsWW6y5aa	No it's not abnormal.  You won't turn gay.  Homosexuality is genetic.|`|q1Ty3nk6aa	Bless you, no.|`|tJqG2q9uaa	its normal ... not unless youre into guys
36Ya7X66aa	Then he likes you, even after he says i hate females and he's still friends with you and treats you the same, he likes you, now go talk to him damn it.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Wait for him, he'll come round. He's just hurting from the break up, I don't think it'll be long before he likes females again. And in the meantime continue the friendship as it's often the best basis for a relationship. <br>  <br>  On a separate note, could it be that your feelings of jealousy about his ex, were perhaps to do with with him spending less time with you? It's easy to get jealous if you used to being such good friends with a guy, and then another girl comes along, and all of a sudden you're not his 'best girl' anymore? Just a thought.|`|hfr9rLjkaa	You gotta tell him! He'll be so happy! Did you ever get over someone you liked but never had? No well neither do men!!! xx|`|ieTOMSbWaa	Carry on being you? He's a bloke aint he, its the big man thing to do hate woman. If he fancied you once he can do it again you just need to let him know that you feel the same this time. Flirt a little, that normally does the trick|`|lT6WBaWIaa	you felt feelings for him, and now you want him all to yourself. if he hates females, but still talks to you, you might be the only female that he might want to go out with.|`|djUMvICoaa	Wait.  He just came out of a bad relationship, he needs time to let the dust settle and get his head on straight.  When he does he will finally see that you aren't one of those females he's suppose to hate, he already doesn't.  Don't push anything, it can ruin something that can be good.  When his head clears he will see how comfortable you made him and how good it feels to have you by his side, that things will start down a new path then.  Be prepared to wait a few months, it will be worth the wait.|`|Ks0BrqHBaa	when people say that they hate men or women they don't mean all of them. they just mean the one's that are like the one that hurt them. so in other words he doesn't hate you hae hates the people that are like his ex. so i wouldn't be worried about it. take the chance see what he says. the worst he can say is no. if he treats you like a princess and your not even together then he must like you as more than a friend because he is trying to make you happy.|`|tJqG2q9uaa	are you into him now cos you cant get him? something to think about ... would you still want him if you could have him? if the answer is yes .. next time he talks about how much girls suck ask him if he feels that way about you .. then be coy and smiley .. you'll be making out before the night is through.|`|EqcC5Ad9aa	this is a great postion to be in.. its killer.. belive you me im in it right now...<br>  listen your mind always tells you about the negatives (most of the time) for instance what if i tell him and he takes it the wrong way.. or if we mess out friendship up.. but alot of pople dont focus on the positve.. i e if something was to happen.. (not just sex) but a next stage of feelings ect ect it will turn in to something muc hmore beutifull than what you could have imagined.<br>  <br>  it does matter also on how old you are. im 19 and ive had STRONG feelings for my best firnd who is a girl around my age. we fooled around when i was 14 15 but since then weve been best firneds. its obv that there is feeling ther but we or i choose not to say anything just in case.. but i dont no if i lvoe ther girl and i dont find her like sexualy attraceted.. i just wan whats BEST 4 her. may be 5 yeard down the line we can speak about it.. but  there is somehting in the air....<br>  <br>  point im tryin to make here is unless your 1000% sure on the love you have for him.. so much so that its bringing you down then sit him down and tell him the FULL truth everythiing that you feel.. <br>  dont say iwant to be with u spent the rest of my life ect ect.<br>  but something like...<br>  <br>  " BLa Bla.. i have to tel you how i feel and its not because your free and single but its because i cant keep it in any more.. now i dont want you to take this in the wrong was and think i have a crush on u but i have strong feelings.. i care about u almost as much as my mother lol. and i want u to be happy because it makes me happy, i lvoe spending time with you and i think you feel the same way as me..<br>  only reason im telin you this is because its killing me..i need to no. because i feel like there may be somehting here bla bla.. i dont want things to change between us but sometimes the path needs to be set sr8 type of thing"<br>  <br>  obv nto word 4 word but take out the fundamentals of what ive said and use it.. ull get somewhere..<br>  dont be a wimp like me lol!
Gb8cl8n2aa	what did you mean by that que?|`|IPS3hWweaa	Human?|`|O88ja9GZaa	A girl friend is a person you love ...|`|DLAkIHsDaa	guy u all may have aleast one GF but till now I donot have any one now I am studing in college 1 year help me|`|0Ey2UpE6aa	Human Female, you?|`|Vq1pCqMuaa	fuckin *****|`|ysWYJPgTaa	YOur sister
rrWhhiMEaa	I was going to take my time and give you a well thought out answer... UNTIL I checked your past questions. Apparently, you have been a boy with a gf, a girl with a bf, a gay man who likes your friends gf, a crush on your stepsister, and more. So what is the truth?<br>  <br>  Now I feel like you are trying to get some girl in bed and looking for tips. I wont indulge you. If you are really gay or bi,  you need to come to terms with your feelings. Otherwise, grow up. If you are really married, I pity your wife.|`|cWuumdy7aa	Is she worried about pain while having sex or she may not have enough knowledge of sex you need to support her to come out of all misgiving about sex. she should talk to some lady who is common friend of both of you and she can convey your feelings.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	She's not interested. I'm sorry,but she would have made a move if she was. Why the heck did you get married to someone just b/c there father wanted them to?? Really,this is wasting your time. Just file for a divorce and try to move on.<br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless!!|`|QV5E70e6aa	Two month time is not long enough to decide for separation.All other things are ok like she is not get romantic etc.<br>  <br>  But how you decide that she is not honest?What factors you have considered for this point  are important.I don't think you can decide that she is not honest within two months of period.Does she have/had affairs with some one whom she really love?If answer is YES then go for separation and if answer is NO then<br>  <br>  Wait and watch her for some more time.|`|ijeninncaa	You don't deserve this and I think this might have been a bad idea. It sounds like she needed more time to think about the marriage even though her dad accepted it before her.<br>  <br>  For now, don't talk to her about sex but just talk about your relationship. How do you feel about not being close to her? Let her know about your feelings. <br>  <br>  She doesn't deserve you if she isn't honest and caring for you as you are of her. Please let her know you've got these thoughts on your mind, something is wrong here and you should have a serious talk with her. <br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|AA12197561	Well, sounds to me like she's avoiding something. Maybe she has something that's she's to afraid to tell you. <br>  <br>  Ask her father, if she has anything or maybe its just her problem. <br>  <br>  I'd say if your not truly inlove and maybe you should divorce. <br>  why marry some one you don't care for?|`|6URBv5xfaa	i think she loves someone else|`|O3EtP4vOaa	I am assuming this was an arranged marriage due to your culture?<br>  <br>  If this is the case you really need to give her time.  She probably only married you to please her family and she may not be attracted to you or feel intimate feelings toward you. <br>  <br>  You have two choices either give her time romance her wine and dine her, and hopefully she will learn to love you like that or you can end the marriage.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|djUMvICoaa	Liked her is not the same as loving her.  She evidently has some very mixed feelings about the situation also, but more to be out of it than to be in it.  But she is trapped.  You are trapped.  Neither of you is reall going to understand what true love is under these circumstances.  The most you could do is learn how to put up with each other.  Is that what you want in your life?|`|veeC7Rvvaa	Give her time.. put your feelings aside and be there as a friend. Stop being so sexual, care about her without sex. she needs a friend and she probably hates being married to you, i think she was forced to marry you. she is very very sad. just leave her alone until she gets better.|`|tVVLtMHGaa	Wow. Why did u get married just because her dad wanted u to? She obviously ruined her life and have made her miserable. Maybe u should explain why u had to get married and then i can help|`|5acf40d2aa61e65eff15834add1f7bd5aa	How old are you two???????|`|f75x8aI3aa	get a divorce|`|WiFVIq3Iaa	i think you r in trable|`|YSq736cpaa	You got married because her *dad* wanted you to?<br>  <br>  Since when is her *dad* a parner to the whole marriage? If he's the one who determined that you two get married in the *first* place ----- what *else* does he dictate in the marriage?<br>  <br>  This situation is a messed-up one. It'll be a tough one sorting it out. Next time ---- get married only if the two people getting *married* want it. Now that you're *in* this situation --- I suggest that you go have an honest discussion with your wife, get to the bottom of this, and go from there.<br>  <br>  Heck --- this situation is so messed up that, for all we know, the dad may have had an ulterior motive for wanting his daughter to get married.<br>  <br>  For example ----- maybe she's gay --- and he's hoping marriage will turn her straight? Which it won't ---- rendering her thereby just as sexually uninterested in men, only married to one.<br>  <br>  That's just one of a TON of possibilities.|`|rnL04k7waa	Spend your most of the time with her. Take her out. Make her feel that your are not a stranger but a husband.<br>  Go to candle light dinner which lightens up romance. Make her feel comfortable with you. <br>  Even if u feel that nothing has changed. Then ask her wht's the problem if she doesn't liked you why she married you. Keep on questioning her why why. <br>  May you people live happily.|`|udsWW6y5aa	Why did you marry her?  If it's because of her dad, why would you marry someone because someone told you?  It's not the middle ages.|`|xIB7Aujdaa	well, i m seeing sumthin like 'rab ne bana di jodi' here. is this the srk makin his avtar. by the way, dont wory dude-do it haule haule. tel her tujh me rab dikhta hai...n all tht crap.|`|jLBw92IXaa	Sometime you gotta just take the p***y.|`|lT6WBaWIaa	she is seeing another guy.|`|6qT9jJ85aa	just take her for dinner or shopping. she will soon come near to you.|`|Rqz6I4g3aa	i dont think shes in love with you...she doesnt want o be married...yet alone have sex|`|Z1po12EXaa	I'm wondering how old you are?  If she is a virgin too, she might not know much about it and may be nervous, scared it will hurt, or so on.  I'm sure being pressured in to marriage before you are ready is a very stressful situation.  I think you need to have an honest talk with her about -whether or not she really wants to be married - how she feels about you - why she isn't interested in intimacy.  If you don't feel like you can talk to her, maybe try writing it in a letter and letting her write back to you.  Maybe she just does need time.  Try being romantic without pushing for intimacy.  I think that in this situation, communication is the key.  You two have to be able to share your feelings.  Good Luck!
oGCcPQ1Xaa	heyy .... <br>  <br>  theres alot of way's you can get a girlfriend basically you just need to go out to partys etc <br>  <br>  good luck <br>  <br>  charlea<br>  x
AA11662302	Yes, it's called sharing his interests.
0Ey2UpE6aa	Take some notes on your common interests, have that list when you while you speak. Once you start talking more and more it will be easier to know what to talk about. Hope this helps =)|`|0JGFv5PXaa	as long as you dont talk bout her ex
jyjrSzw9aa	lol i know how u feel!!! lol, well try something like, "i would love it if u were to start kissing me on my neck and work ur way down. i would love it if u were to put ur hands on me..."idk lol, stuff like that! :] hope this helps!!!|`|0Ey2UpE6aa	Since you can't really use your looks as an attraction at the time, you have to do it all with your voice. Just talk dirty to him, not too dirty, but if know any things that really get him off, elaborate on them.
sjERiFeNaa	realise that she obviously wasnt woman enough to say it to ur face. ppl who dump over txt are cowards, as they can get it over with, without having to hear wat the other person has to say, or deal with an emotional scene.<br>  i say, dont waste ur time on someone who couldnt be decent enough to end it with u the adult way, and have fun being single. just learn from this situation, and perhaps dont go having such high expectations so early on in a relationship. (that may have also freaked her out) <br>  anyway, u were obviously too good for her mate. just forget about her.|`|KHiNdxGJaa	I've been through the same thing. Just hang with your friends and have fun. Maybe find another girl and try going out with her. Get rid of things that remind you of her. Do things that interest you and don't even think about her. Tell someone you trust (your best friend, friend, sister, brother, ect.) about the situation. Ask them for advice. Go see a movie or go to a party. I hope I helped:)|`|Tt61Vp92aa	it sucks but busy yourself and whatever you do dont call her.if you can make it 2 months without calling her you will feel so much more relieved|`|QuSDef6taa	Move on, you are lucky she dumped you in the early stage of your relationship. You should even be thankfull for her being honest with you.|`|veeC7Rvvaa	Get drunk and have a good ol' cry. Then wake up, pick up the pieces and move on.
6wxgyGy5aa	If you want to get back together the best thing to do is contact him.  Keep it casual though. Don't blurt out your feelings for him right away.  He may have moved on with his life and you don't want to cause any problems for him.  If he has moved on and his feelings are gone, you'll have to accept it and move on as well.|`|1hciyvKdaa	He doenst want to hear it hun, work harder on forgetting him ok. Its doing you no good. Hes chosen not to stay friends. Hard to take but you must ok.|`|eW3QCsKFaa	I think you should just tell him flat out.<br>  Not in person, that might be harder if he tells you he doesn't.<br>  But I don't think you have anything to loose. Just text him. Or write him a letter. I feel like it would be harder to take it in if he doesn't feel the same way if you hear it directly from his voice. Just say "I think I still have feelings for you" I think you'll feel better knowing what his thoughts are rather than not knowing. Well at least that's what it's like for me.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|83TkWic3aa	you broke up for a reason didn't you? If you want to tell him, fine, tell him, call him, whatever-but even if he feels the same way,odds are, it won't work out to a happy ending, because whatever made you two break up in the first place will reel its ugly head around again because you broke up to fix the problem not solve it.|`|xWq93Ckyaa	just straight out, tell him that you love him. it's going to be hard but that's the only thing there is to do. you could always have a friend do it but it's not the same thing. maybe if you tell him you still love him, he might feel the same way.<br>  GOODLUCK (=|`|SgaUGKoUaa	facebook him|`|7dfa1a36a3ba55081399e73bed8603f1aa	This same thing happend to me. You probably arent speaking because you want things to air out.. or basically you want to let the anger settle... What i did was one day out of the blew i texted him and started saying hi and getting back in touch and everything. Then, before i knew it he asked me how i felt about our breakup so maybe you should ask him how he felt and then he will ask you how you feel about it and you can tell him that you still love him and you want to be with him. You basically need to initiate conversation. I hope i Helped!|`|owxYkIySaa	It is always rough when there are break-ups. One thing to avoid: ICE CREAM!!! Yes you see it on movies to eat it after break ups. But that is not the way to go. You should get out with your friends more, do things you normally wouldn't do when you were with him. You will be okay, just try not to think about him and try to constantly have fun!! :)|`|wD9dXmgqaa	Summon the courage to tell him in person, he won't know that you still love him unless you tell him! <br>  <br>  If you need help approaching him, just approach him but don't come across as desperate - it's as easy as that.|`|pj2toj2raa	my ex broke up with me 7 months ago i still love him and he nows i do but he wont get back with me im sure he would have called etc if ur ex had feelings for you<br>  <br>  you just have to move on ino its hard <br>  gd luck <br>  x|`|K2wqVB27aa	say hi to him when you see him or start texting hiimm or even have friends talk to him about yu idk thier are plenty of ways but dont just stop talking to him cuz then yu will always regret it
W6LGsQC8aa	First off, if he is a guy and he received food for free, I am sure he ate it.<br>  <br>  Secondly, what is your company's rules on inter-company dating? Make sure you don't lose your job for this guy!
nspaGCh9aa	It seems like she's playing hard to get.  But if you notice that she is not stopping this "game" well then you know that she doesn't like you.  And yes girls do lie.  I liked a boy that went to my school when I was younger.  So someone that was supposed to be my friend told him.  He asked me if I liked him and said no like it was never possible for me to be with him, but I only said this because I thought about all the other girls that he had been with and how many of their feelings he had hurt, so I lied, well more like changed my mind.  I really don't regret that I said what I did.  But my point in telling you that was to tell you this from a girls point of view.  I thought it was similar to her and your story.  Good luck.|`|482e02ed9008d4730d65a08467cdf9d6aa	first of all yea girls lie, but by your story i see where this girl is trying to get to, i mean if you really like her just keep showing her the real you, since she doesnt totally ignore you or anything like that, i mean it doesnt hurt if one way doesnt work out at least you guys can remain friends|`|tC6bKxRAaa	Pshhh I use to lie all the time to guys telling them I liked them alot... I was good at leading them on too.. That's when I was in high school though.
xWq93Ckyaa	a guy will usually show signs if he likes you, unless he's really shy.<br>  <br>  if you like him, you make the move. be different, be your own person.<br>  tell him you like him & maybe he'll feel the same, if not, so be it.<br>  GOODLUCK (=|`|pGf4mIw9aa	Ask him. Don't ask us, we don't know you and we don't know him. So how can we speak for him?|`|kzFDDiJeaa	If the guy likes u he'll show it & tell u to ur face. If he doesn't like u<br>  -he won't talk 2 u <br>  -give u I contact|`|Rez2nbWHaa	hey listen don't be afraid to go for it.. What is the worst thing he could say?? No? Well then that is his fault and he is missing out on something that could be wonderful, so i say go for it!!!|`|V2iRZysgaa	He stares at you and smiles really weird, like a creeper.  In fact, he might also use a gay-voice around you.  That's the big signal.|`|DyORD0Zkaa	ask him if he is shy but if he is not shy give him signs that will make him realize that you like him by blushing and hanging out with him a lot|`|6bQbkRDMaa	call me old fashioned but I think a girl should always wait for the guy to make the first move<br>  if he likes you <br>  he will look or stare at you at lot, go out of his way to see and talk to you, it is usually pretty obviously<br>  I wouldn't tell him you like him, because if he doesn't you might get hurt|`|BQPD0XEaaa	I'm really an old-fashioned type of girl.  i believe that it should really be the guy who would be doing the first move.  if he truelly loves you, then he'll go out of his league just to let you know how much he likes you.|`|FnBpFB4Laa	You should get him to like you. Show him what a wonderful person you are. Hint to him that you like him and then after a while whenever you think it's the right time express your feelings.|`|7HYJG7q9aa	ya well if u think its a good i dea now to tell him u like him than ya but i mean if u two have just been tlaking for a bit then no uunless u dont like where its going or if u just really need to but if he doenst like u back then just move on|`|UOdlnw6Xaa	if he likes you he will have sex with you.
gs8MSMs3aa	ok, girlfriend you should give yourself a mani but other than that they are actually fine i mean no one really pays that much attention to hands. i think  you go with at least a clear/pink coat and if it chips it is stil better than nothing.  i mean othr than that i dont know what else you could do your hands are not ugly theyre just hands :) lol|`|IPS3hWweaa	Your hands look fine. Don't worry about it, if a guy likes you, he'll like your hands as well.|`|GfCRiueRaa	I think they're fine. d:<br>  <br>  Don't worry, the fingertips on my left hand are calloused and rough from playing guitar and my ring finger on my left hand has a calloused patch because I taught myself how to write and now I hold pens in a weird way. I don't let it bother me though. :)|`|q1Ty3nk6aa	For a start, more people than you realise have that bump on their finger - I do, for example. But they really do look fine, you have nothing to worry about. In fact, you have nice slender fingers! At least they're not all podgy!|`|xuzFEc0jaa	they look alot like ma gf's hands so dont worry|`|tpfj8XJoaa	...no?|`|7HYJG7q9aa	um rerally u shoudlnt be worrying bout ur hands u cnt change them so just live wit them and foucus ur attention on something more important
2sBzrxxfaa	Well buddy, a good friend of mine has always told me that it is better to Focus on your schooling than to Focus on the Girls......<br>  <br>  I have always been the Later of the two, but I would say that you need to try and move on. The best thing you can do is work hard and after a few years try to reapply at the other University. And keep trying, if you succeed at the present one then they can always accept you.|`|hHndD5SEaa	you pick yourself up - shake yourself down and get on with life. You made a mess of things over this girl - you wont have been the first and you certainly wont be the last!!! <br>  Life goes on - just knuckle down and concentrate on doing well for yourself now!<br>  xx
PxPvs7lhaa	If he really is a "best" friend then you should know in your heart if he is someone that will treat you well and not run if things get rocky.  You sound really young, but sometimes the best loves start off childhood friends.  And a boyfriend that starts as a friend will remain a friend no matter what.  My husband and I were high school sweethearts and if we had of given up all those times one of us freaked we wouldn't have our two beautiful children and strong marriage.  Remember it's not the end of the world, but maybe a new beginning.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Wants<br>  Don't feel<br>  Constantly nags <br>  We'll see<br>  Rejected you<br>  Nagging again<br>  <br>  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!|`|gs8MSMs3aa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that is all a crock of ****.  he doesnt want you, he says he does but what he wants is a girlfriend.  he changed his mind because he didnt want to be tied down but then changed his mind when he got no one.  move on!!!!!! you deserve more.  and Dylan is not more|`|hHndD5SEaa	tell him you gave him a chance and he blew it - so to live with it and stop asking you to go out with him!<br>  xx|`|6wxgyGy5aa	Sounds like he doesn't know what he wants.|`|zZiWxkiGaa	ugh|`|5agXk9ldaa	i think he is just waisting your time so my advice<br>  NO<br>  woof woof  AWW<br>  no mercy|`|djUMvICoaa	Don't settle for something you don't know if you're ready for or to just get him off of your back.

Dont buy him hella unnecessary stuff. Try to go for sentimental value.|`|qixr0HKfaa	i dont  know where u  are doing your celebration but my point is cut a lot of heart shape or star shape quite big and the star shape write like happy birthday something like that and the heart shape u can write something or dont write at all.

How you can make other people feel, how you make them laugh and see the good parts of life, of how they feel about themselves.  That is hot.|`|3Z4YFz29aa	look at Ashley Tisdale, Kristen Chenowith, Kristen Bell, etc. <br>  <br>  Just smile, don't wear skinny jeans (they only look good on tall women with well toned legs), don't wear too much make up, have facial piercings, visible tatoos, etc. <br>  <br>  be fun and flirty.

0AYPgUQIaa	There is nothing wrong with some fantasizing.<br>  I mean what else could he do? Most men watch porn because they can't be with their woman 24/7 and most men are horny 24/7.<br>  If I couldn't masturbate for a day I would just go crazy!<br>  Men don't watch porn because they don't find their girlfriends attractive anymore, they do it because they have certain needs that need to be satisfied.<br>  I get very cranky if my needs aren't satisfied, it's like when women have their periods. I just become irritated.|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	Jump his bones, And if he still doesn't want to do it, ask him what you are doing wrong that he prefers porn over you. Otherwise I wouldn't worry about it, most men look at porn. Tell him you want to watch it with him. See what he says, I bet he will want to do it with you then.|`|AA11447210	You NEVER read sex scenes in steamy novels? C'mon....it's the same thing (and there's nothing wrong with ANY of it). It has nothing to do with you.<br>  <br>  You are completely unrealistic if you think you are the only woman he'll ever look at sexually again. Watching porn doesn't mean he wants to be with someone else. It means he can't be with you every time he's aroused and the porn provides him with the desired stimulation to make masturbation more pleasurable...or it's just curiosity. Guys are visual and they enjoy looking at sexual images.<br>  <br>  Many women watch porn (I have a small collection of my own). It can help arouse us when we need a little extra stimulation...it can give us new ideas to try with our partner...unless he'd rather watch porn than be with you, it's harmless.<br>  <br>  Trust me, you'd MUCH rather he watch porn than cheat. Porn is entertainment. He can fantasize about chicks on TV too, but that wouldn't bug you. Don't let the fact the chicks he's watching are naked make a difference. If his watching porn interferes with your time together, then it's an issue.<br>  <br>  Talk to him about it when he returns and ask him why he does it. Don't accuse, don't get mean, and don't try to demand he not do it...just talk about what you found. It may help you feel less threatened by it.|`|hHndD5SEaa	hun - men watch porn!!! Its part of being a guy!! Isnt it better that he watches it at home and doesnt go out looking to get his sexual kicks elsewhere though? Its not that a big a deal honest!<br>  xx|`|Tt61Vp92aa	block the stuff and confront him|`|0Opi3SWKaa	i watch porn wit my man. is just a fantasy, thats all.|`|x7uYAPaSaa	My boyfriend joined the group that was called 'Internet Porn' i got terribly upset, but i never mentioned it. <br>  I left it until after we made love so he couldnt avoid the question and i asked about it. He said that he only joined it because its what men do when they miss they're girlfriends. He said he could easily go downstairs now and bring up some girl on the internet but it would never be as amazing as my body ect.<br>  <br>  Instead of crying over it, ask him about it. Demand answers. Its never a great thing to find out, but its a pleasure for a guy... its only natural but it isnt fair on you. But wouldnt you rather prefer you guy to be watching porn that going out and cheating on you?<br>  He doesnt know these women, there just women who make him aroused.|`|chHPoiThaa	All you nee to do to get your own back is in Tools> internet options of the internet browser that you use, just find a lesbo site, copy and paste the URL on the top of he screen to the default open page and set ok!<br>  The next time he switches on the computer, the first page that will open is the lesbo site.|`|UTxt6tOGaa	my boyfriend watches porn all the time when Im not there, and sometimes when i am hehe! <br>  <br>  At first it really hurt and I thought it was me... like maybe I was bad in bed or something. But its nothing like that.<br>  <br>  I think half of it is the sneakin around part that men like! <br>  Its just fantasy hunni. Nothing wrong with that!<br>  <br>  Maybe if it would make you feel better you could try and spice things back up in the bedroom. watch some porn together or indulge in a real fantasy x|`|0Ey2UpE6aa	Some people don't watch porn for the sake of seeing a hot chick get nailed. Some people watch it for the act of sex itself. Don't beat yourself up over it and you shouldn't be so quick to judge him.<br>  <br>  When he gets back sit him down and have a chat about it. Best of luck =)|`|W0qFAIVuaa	I don't see the porn itself as a big deal.But him not giving you the attention you need and deserve is unforgivable unless he has some medical or mental problem.Sorry and good luck.|`|iDqVy21gaa	Chuck him and all his stuff out and wipe your hard drive<br>  <br>  Don't even bother telling him why<br>  <br>  <br>  You should be everything he needs<br>  <br>  <br>  You need a new man|`|CP5T4G5Maa	Poor you.  I've been in this situation before and all I can tell you is it has absolutely nothing to do with how he feels about you!  He still loves you and finds you attractive but some guys (well most) just get off on looking at porn,doesn't mean he feels any less for you.<br>  I know you feel hurt and betrayed because he was looking behind your back, but he is only LOOKING!<br>  Wait until he comes back from London and ask him about it.  Tell him how it makes you feel, spend some time this weekend to have a think about it rationally because you are just reacting without thinking just now.  Be honest with him and if it's something you really don't want him to do, he should respect that and stop.<br>  Why not suggest you watch it together, get some girl friendly porn or even just look at a few adult websites together? You said you hardly have sex anymore, perhaps work together to change that? <br>  It's natural to feel threatened by this because it's something he did behind your back but it doesn't mean you aren't good enough so please don't think that.  Talk with him once you have calmed down a little.|`|veeC7Rvvaa	I'm not worried by the fact that he's watching porn, i'm more concerned that he's watching it while not having sex with you. It could be about him, does he feel sexually anxious when you're together? Did you make a comment about his performance that might've put him off having sex with you and seeking ''relief'' else where? <br>  I don't mean to sound like i'm blamming you, but we need to examin all the ''evidence'' to understand his behaviour.<br>  I wouldn't appreciate him going on a trip in london at such a time.. <br>  Has he ever cheated on you? Do you trust him? <br>  i think you should have a little chat with him, say something within these lines:<br>  While I was looking for a website link I didn't quite remember, I noticed that the history has repeated porn websites. I can't help but link the two with us not being intimate lately. Please, do share any concerns or worry's you have regarding our relation as I am doing with you.<br>  <br>  Wishing you best of luck<br>  P.S: men watch porn just to ''release'' not because they don't find you attractive.. they don't really care about the women there, at the end of the day you're his partner! don't take it personally, please!|`|AA11881071	Yes  dear you are not  the first.. Always  remember that most men are visually stimulated while   they say women are more  emotionally stimulated.. <br>  Just because he looks doesn't  mean he  cheats.He must  appreciate beauty because he is staying with you. and if he  never ever looked  he wouldn't have a pulse... <br>  The main thing is he may look at her but he  goes  home to you...|`|a1gad9Ebaa	Its just the way us men are.

037gXpUvaa	All I can say is Wow! Sorry to hear about all of this, but it does seem like you guys are wanting different things. Have him over and start of by telling him you love him, but that the time that is needed to give to him is not available and you would like to focus on your career. It will be hard on him but keep repeating that you will always be around him because of the surroundings you guys have, and you will be there when you can for him. Repeat that you do NOT want children so that he may know, well maybe this is a good thing. <br>  <br>  I did this with my husband and we get along so so good now.

Good Luck!!|`|rQ7dI88Maa	I'm sorry you're going through this. Perhaps she wasn't with him when you guys went out. Whatever the case, since it's affecting  your work, I'd write her a letter expressing your feelings. It will be healthy to get your feelings out. It sounds like she wants to remain friends. I commend you for not making any moves when she enticed you.|`|HO5lWoNDaa	If you respect her brother so much then talk to him about your worries :)|`|AfnOU04paa	You spent a long time not corresponding with her.  I know you were "busy", but being too busy for her was pretty much of a slam.  When men are too busy to spend a few minutes chatting with me on the phone or email or IM, then I know they are just not that into me.  Also, your being "busy" let's others know just how important you are, and that's why you have no time for them.<br>  <br>  Obviously, she's had and has somewhat of a social life, and luckily for her she did not wait around for you to come around.  My idea is that the night she dimmed the lights and put on pretty music, she was hoping you'd make your move then, if you were ever going to.  I think that was your last chance, and if you were really into her, you blew it.<br>  <br>  I doubt you're madly in love with her.  The respect for her brother that kept you at bay was most likely because you knew he would question you about your motives, and if you went on to use her as an experiment, you'd have him to answer to.  Men know how men are.<br>  <br>  I think you are just feeling jilted.  If you are not going to make a commitment to correspond or date her, you should simply continue to be an aloof friend.|`|d5sAojVmaa	Sometimes you realize that you just want to leave her alone because you think that you will be interrupting her life. Then you say it and you think, well I want to not get in the way of her but its just too hard just to say forget it. Your best advice would be to ask them whats up. Tell them how you feel. Sometimes people hold things back that they feel in their hearts and they end up regretting it the rest of their lives. Would you want to sit back and forget it? Or would you want to take the time to figure out if its best for the two of you to talk.|`|jSwtmhmVaa	go for her why wait time is flying do things which you won't regret in your life please do what your heart  is telling you to do forst rget about why she did not tell you about the boyfriend she wasn't sure you will be there for her cause last time you did not reply her message as for the parents why rush sort your stuff first with her i wish you the best good luck

8p31dENPaa	If you re in a committed relationship you are not single in the social world.

88bDvyiwaa	You can go to school and study something that is guaranteed to give you a good job.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Not sure where you are in your life.  If you are in your twenties all I can do is assure you that this too shall pass.   We all start out struggling.  It takes time to get to a point where you are comfortable.  For me - about 7 years after school to get into a comfort zone.  I am a reader by nature - so I'd kill a lot of time at our local library and borrow books, dvds, and sometimes computer time too.  <br>  <br>  You are right though - the weekend evenings are tough!  Some nights I'd just go to bed early and then spend the next day hiking.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
EyaqiWPwaa	yes its quite normal for women to not wanna make sandwiches for men....mostly cuz after they do they start popping babies out....so just stear clear of the sandwiches and dont worry about other people making sandwiches and youll be ok kid|`|2b39e12aad73ae2fda69e018286d6baeaa	Honey, it does not matter if it is normal or not.  As long as you know what you want, or don't want, stick to your ideas and goals.  Do things your way, and you won't live to regret it.  Hange in there.  What do you want?|`|421288574b7a52a5ba8268e608253dfbaa	That's perfectly normal. I'm 31 and pretty much in the same boat as you.|`|4d52d758f45db34f29370d8ba6d5ec41aa	yah its normal, but u do need to think about it. i am also in kind of same situation.|`|tnYCL8yFaa	I applaud you. I think a lot of women - single or not - wishes they had your amount of security and independence.<br>  <br>  It does seem like most women feel like they HAVE to have a man now a days, when you would think with how the world is nowadays that it would be the opposite.
8P6MmLv0aa	sorry he done that to you not all guys are like that, relationships are hard some times and some guys just don't know how to handle some situations and they can make a right mess of it all.<br>  He shouldn't have called you and said about his new girlfriend that was bad of him specially if he new it would up set you, checking to see if you are alright is one thing that shows he Still cares but to brag about a new girl that's just cruel it sounds like you are better of without him.<br>  you sound like a very nice girl and you need some love in your live so don't wast time thinking about him go out and enjoy yourself.|`|v1uNUcwCaa	ITS NOT YOUR FAULT!!!<br>  <br>  if you didnt cheat you havent done anything wrong!<br>  sounds like he cheated on you and felt so insecure that he might get caught so he started accusing you of it.<br>  <br>  he is still insecure asking you if you were with a guy just coz you were busy. <br>  <br>  my advice would be to get a new number and have nothing more to to with him and his mind games.|`|KM50wTbHaa	i think he's doing this to feel good about himself and to do exactly what he has done... hurt you. Don't let him and try to get over him as you had before he came back.|`|PmWzhGP3aa	Hes a coward who couldn't be honest to u, i think u will soon realise you are better off without him, if he calls again, dont answer|`|AA11349881	I'm in same situation,hurts when they dont give a damn,thats the worst part,time is a healer.|`|bb01f866958672a3a6f5b84585896d33aa	ok i understand your situation<br>  <br>  You seem have a big problem with your bf. i have a solution for it .<br>  <br>  in fact, your bf is very concerned you, and this feeling is turning to extreme case that you are owned by him. <br>  Your should bear in mind, that you should tell me you are not his slave ...<br>  <br>  <br>  To sum up, you can tell him and clarify that you are his maid. afetr doing it , i do think your life is better .|`|AFkjkqcSaa	1st  of all delete this guys number from your phone now and get rid of any gifts hes bought u, sell them on ebay and make some money. 1 thing I cant understand is why girls hang on 2 an *** hole...has he really got a g.friend?

H3WHxCgaaa	I think that if your boyfriend was not interested - he wouldn't be picking up the phone.  He needs to put a stop to the contact.  If you are this bothered by it (why wouldn't you be - she stalks him at work!?) then you should have a sit down conversation and communicate about it.  In the end - it is he that needs to tell her to stop contacting him.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Your boyfriend has the power to deal with his ex..legally..etc..if she is bothering him|`|LJ2OqF1saa	seems to me that she is fishing to see if he may still be interested in her, or maybe getting ready to try and cheat on the baby's daddy.  There really is not much you can do, except hope that he understands that she cheated on him, and that she apparently did not care about him.<br>  <br>  It is up to him to tell her that he is not interested, and that he would appreciate it if she would not call anymore, because he is in a relationship with someone else.  BTW, was his car outside of her work place, or is she just trying to start something?  It could have been some one else's car and not his.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	i think that your boyfriend is full of it.  like transformers, there's more than meets the eye here and you should definitely be concerned.  his excuses about not "recognizing the number" are crap.  he's picking up the phone because he isn't completely over her and wants to talk to her.  the fact that she is w/ someone else and has a kid are irrelevant.  she's apparently not as stupid as you thought she was.  remember, she isn't the problem, your boyfriend is.  if he really wanted this to stop, he would stop answering.  she wouldn't be doing this if she wasn't getting some kind of "payoff" from it.  <br>  <br>  put your foot down and tell your boyfriend that if he still wants to talk to his ex than he can do so without you.  time for him to decide.|`|bIimm8fSaa	Tell him to put a stop to it or else.  And if he doesn't, then you tell her.  And while you are at it, let her boyfriend know as well.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	He shouldn't be answering her phone calls or texts, this tells me he does still have itnerest in her.  It's always bad news to be the dumpee, because they are always left feeling stuff for their ex.<br>  <br>  You gotta tell him you're not comfortable with all the chatting they're doing.  Out of respect for you, and for himself.  <br>  <br>  She could just be trying to be friends because she misses him that way, or she could be up to more.  Who knows?  You could always ask her!|`|SsfnitjXaa	Her number should be blocked from that phone.  What do you mean he doesn't recognize it!!!! He just puts her in as a contact, her name comes up and he doesn't pick up.  The problem is with him.  He likes the attention.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Ok I would seriously wonder why your bf was talking to his ex, if he cant tell her not to contact him again because its over, then maybe its not over for him yet and you are being ignored, maybe he doesnt want to tell her not to contact him because he cant let go, its his problem dont make it yours, you are obviously more free than he is.<br>  I wouldn't hang around but thats me if I smell a rat there usually is one.<br>  Tell him goodbye and move on, you are worth far more than this so dont self yourself short no matter what he says.

You could even try joining some groups or clubs in your school or local community college to try to make some friends. Being shy is not the end of the world, as you get older you will begin to become less shy, and maybe even more outgoing. Just try to strike up conversations with some people when you do go out. Try meeting people in a chat room maybe on AOL or even Myspace or facebook. Online can be easier to help you with being shy, as online you can feel a little more free to be yourself. Plus you may be able to find some people that like the same things you do. Hope this helps. Good luck to you.<br>  <br>  PS.<br>  If you need a friend you can email me from my profile on Yahoo answers.

l2E4qEsAaa	Read Steve Santagati's The Manual.  I saw him on Oprah, where he offered tons of advice to women unlucky in love.  Some of his advice was:<br>  <br>  Dress to get noticed.  Even if you go to the grocery store, look your best.  This doesn't mean high heels and a short skirt.  It means you should wear makeup and clothes that make you look attractive.  Always play up your best features.  If you have nice collar bones, wear a shirt that shows that off.  If you have nice legs, show them off, but wear a conservative shirt.<br>  <br>  Be confident.  Easier said than done, right?  When you walk into a room, tell yourself that you are hot and interesting and those who get a chance to talk to you are incredibly lucky.<br>  <br>  Practice flirting...with everyone.  Flirt with the man in the elevator, the check-out lady (this doesn't make you gay; it makes you friendly).  If you practice trying to get strangers to laugh or smile, you will be better able to use flirting to attract men.<br>  <br>  Some places to find men:  Home Depot (go up to a man and ask a question about a drill bit or something).  The golf course.  The grocery store.  Starbucks.<br>  <br>  Finally-- this is my own advice-- watch Sex and the City reruns.  If you don't have a man, at least you can always have Manolos ;)|`|5aXKo6uCaa	<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4504653_boy-like-easytodo-steps.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4504653_boy-like...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.more-selfesteem.com/self_confidence_tips.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.more-selfesteem.com/self_conf...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|J3A1JbvEaa	try being a girl next door.....simple,sweet dat types!i guess it wll work.best of luck|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	flash them|`|Ve48V97Baa	first answer is the obvious correct answer...but i still dont see why this bothers you|`|A8AiwYXNaa	the reason why you have not been ask out by a guy is because you have not try to talk to them. why dont you try to talk to him so he can get to know you.|`|SqDXxAeGaa	be spontaneous confindent show guys you don't need them, then they think it's kinda like a game you be confindent they come running, trust me it works|`|962bae911ad61f28d2ffefb0b7da26a1aa	they do not notice u because u notice them be away from them whom u r colse to then see the effect they r many more tips i dont have time now u really wanna know just mail me at crazydilip2006@yahoo.com|`|WiFVIq3Iaa	what have you done in your life|`|R4F05z4Faa	MS Beautiful <br>  Here are so many stupids to shake hand and I am one of them <br>  surely I never disappoint after friendship.

He can be immature about a lot of things.<br>  1). Does not manage his money well by the time he should be moving out of his parents house. <br>  2). Lacks taking care of himself. <br>  3). You as a girlfriend have to tell him to do the things that he should do but is too lazy to take care of without someone having to say something.<br>  4). Finally, has no future plans of what he wants for his life.|`|9dbea44d655a5ffde954039fd784f978aa	Wears spiderman jammies.|`|lNjN8bdLaa	dating-<br>  <a href="http://datemaker.info/" rel="nofollow">http://datemaker.info/</a>|`|AA11394554	his age and the way he acts dose he act his age or his shoe size?|`|uw2lRgmeaa	Picking his nose in public. lol.

LhafPeY1aa	Yes definitely, if I had a girlfriend who told me she would like to do that to me I would go along with it for sure, it would be great fun!|`|d940b613c72e65dceb131f078c7f061eaa	I wouldn't normally have realized this, but I don't think I've had a partner as an adult with whom the question had not already come up before that stage, so that this question puts my cart before the horse.  I've been game for pretty much anything that's been asked of me.  I would ask for a safe word even if one were not proposed.  It's not that I've ever used one out of necessity (though I have out of charity when I could tell my tickler was ready to stop but didn't want to disappoint me), but just its existence is a nice reassurance.|`|lNGGCEYtaa	Anytime you like!!!!!!|`|WHifY90Caa	In a heartbeat!!|`|jbGsNRh8aa	I would have to be really comfortable and trusting with them to do this.  And it would help if their fantasy was one I enjoyed.  I actually like the idea of being tied up and just letting myself be taken over, but you may be different.  Maybe you can trade.  Tell him one of your secret fantasies and agree to take turns.|`|JbKerMCkaa	Oh yes, I would....that would be so much fun :->  I wouldn't really have any conditions (except maybe be naked or she has to be in bra and panties) he he.<br>  <br>  I am not turned on as much by it myself, but I LOVE to do that to a girl...I think its so sexy....her is what I would do:<br>  <br>  - Tied her to the bed....slowly pull her clothes off and kiss her as I did....then find her ticklish spots and go at it!! <br>  <br>  - Make her wrestle me and we could have a tickle match<br>  <br>  - Blindfold her and get her by surprise|`|INJSpV4haa	Not a problem for me.<br>  <br>  There's actually very little I would not do in order to please a woman I adore.  ;)<br>  <br>  Translation: very few limits.|`|41t5e7yMaa	hhaahah sounds good. i would let them do it. for sure. how long how ever long they wanted. conditionss dont stop :) ahahah good questionnn|`|emKXU1QFaa	No, I don't think I could handle the tickling for very long.  I'd probably pee my pants.|`|iNC2Yimlaa	Bondage and tickling can be a very sensual and pleasurable activity, especially between two people who truly care for each other. I have personally engaged in this activity on several occasions during my time. Although, I should say in those situations I was almost always the tickler. However, I can say that the experience can be very rewarding for both parties involved. I say to anyone who has been asked by their partner to participate in this sort of thing to approach it with an open mind and definitely give it a shot. Just make sure that you truly trust the person you are doing it with. Also, have a safety word in place so that you can stop things if they get too intense. You may also want to get your partner to agree to giving you brief rests in between the tickling. A good rule of thumb is to tickle for five to ten minutes then take a five to ten minute rest.|`|AA11808800	I LOVE to be tickled but I don't like being tied up. I tried it, and I'd just much rather be pinned down. I don't tickle back or even try to escape, so it works out about the same.
112aa4d1238ca81c154d56b623aec1dcaa	Ok!!!   Tell her you'll only break up if she takes you out to see the girls, her girl friends !! hahahaha|`|3FUzRANPaa	Most likely bcuz your a lesbian.|`|hftCJdZZaa	Most likely bcuz your a lesbian.
UtS6Uesqaa	If your ex is all about you and only you then he should block them from being able to make passes at him....He should also have there phone numbers blocked from his house....I mean there are mean and vicious bitches out there that have nothing better to do then **** around with men that are no longer available...And there is only one name for them, "WHORES"..I mean they need to get lives...What you can do  is ignore the bitches, they are so not worth your breath or time....You shouldn't feel horrible or like a victim..What you wanna do is enjoy your man, forget the other girls, what's important is you are with him and they are not and that's what you should be focusing on.....There are just jealous...Enjoy your man girl, show him love...Hope this helps!|`|bNuuxJv1aa	Because they are probably just jealous of what you two have or they might just want to date him again as well. As long as he isn't contacting them you shouldn't have anything to worry about. Just tell him to say something to them about leaving you two alone.|`|6XKlW3lyaa	Is he married or engaged?  If not, he's still available for pursuit.  Can't complain about a woman trying to get what she wants.|`|VCz1CtiLaa	Because they are probably jealous. My brother's ex-girlfriend is doing that to him and his new girlfriend right now because now she realizes that she loves him and wants to be with him.  My brother just finds her annoying, she didn't want him when she had him....|`|YtSGbYqEaa	they are jealous of you they tried doing that to me just blow them off feel good about yourself  hold your head up and dont let them make you feel bad show off your man and let them know hes yours there will always be girls like that trying to get what you have dont worry about them
6a20a722662e646b9861b6c3014628a6aa	I am a girl but I would say that you would make a good girlfriend. Just because you dont drink, it doesnt mean you are no fun... You can go drink, and have a beer or two and not get trashed.... also being a virgin is not a bad thing... I wish I still was.... Not only that, but you are going to college and have goals set for you self. That is something that is admirable. My mom and I are very close too. I tell her pretty much everything... except for sex topics lol but I would cosider her as  my best friend too... and there is nothing wrong with being close to your family. You will find a guy who will appreciate you for who you are, and if these losers are giviving you a hard time, then they are not worth your time!!!|`|JW9w8JkOaa	U wud make a great lover and mother, a girlfriend yes but to be a great girlfriend u have to know just how to have fun. guys like girls who can make time fly having fun without borin them. another aspect is people love people who like themselves first. have great confidence in yourself. and another thing is that friends is not all about fun. u have to be for ur friends when they need someone to support to.|`|5wtQWxbeaa	....in all sincerity(not sure it is the correct spelling).....you are just perfect....who ever said that all dudes like to drink?and who said we do not like girls who just love their quiet time....let no one bring it forth that you have issues....wish you al the best.|`|sQtx12RHaa	Huh, there's nothing wrong with being a virgin or not having a boyfriend or whatever, I consider those to be good points. You sound like a nice girl though and I think you'd make a good girlfriend.|`|AA12011409	ur listed bad points arent really BAD<br>  what makes u a good gf depends on ur personality traits and also the kind of bf u looking for....who might or might not like ur personality the way it is.........|`|Aon6Mx7waa	email me sanchezsk8er@yahoo.com|`|IPS3hWweaa	You are perfect!|`|AA11812015	I think you would be a good girlfriend for certain guys.  It depends on who you are trying to get.  You will find that a lot of the people who do those things like drinking and stuff get into trouble and are forced to grow up.  You have just skipped a step.|`|AcsML4Leaa	i'm not a guy but i just wanted to say that being a virgin is not a bad point! lots of guys would really respect that! and not drinking doesn't mean your no fun, tbh i agree with the second answer, your bad points aren't even bad. :] x|`|pvZZ9Jzmaa	to tell you the truth, the "bad points" that you mentioned are also your good points!|`|d861778018432f5f26321e9fa06ec7faaa	Probably would be a great girlfriend after you graduate school.|`|HrDcaocMaa	You sound like you'd be a great Mom someday too!  ?

It is good that you have something in common too. I would date him if I were you. I know what it feels like to get your heart broken. But you have to live the moment. You will only be 19 once in your life.

She sounds like hard work.|`|05SbMDA6aa	Timing can often be key to a relationship. You both need to be open about your feelings for mutual understanding and progression. If she is not ready to be open and honest with you then that's not a good basis for a relationship to start from. I would recommend moving on & finding someone who is ready to form a good solid relationship grounded on honest communication and affection.

OkCrlU7Aaa	I think everyone is different (obviously) and some might look younger for their age or older. Not really a certain age where you'll look just like your age. I'm 19 but everyone always thinks I'm 15 for some reason. It can be annoying because my family treats me like a little kid and when I act real bubbly I think some people see me as younger when I'm not >:\ But I think we should be glad that when we get older we'll still look young.|`|LWvh2g2maa	Hopefully Never.|`|oSfXwfnfaa	I really want to know that myself; i'm 20 and can pass for as young as 12. Not kidding. plus i'm also quite short and skinny. aside from trying to look older with makeup and stuff, which doesn't always work out, i just try to accept that i'll always look younger than my actual age. and i also tell myself i'll enjoy it when i'm older, which i guess is something all of us babyfaces should look forward to, since at present it can be quite annoying.|`|k7PrrAlgaa	your lucky

I'm much older and all the single guys are either drunks or gay. . .or both. . .LOL. . .Try places like the library, the laundrymat and join a few groups to donate your time.  Those groups are full of women and you'll find some that are doing something rather than sitting in bars.  Start talking to everyone. . .datable or not. . . and gather a lot of female friends around you and they'll shake out some women for you too.  They are the ones that know those girls that aren't out on the "scene" so are hard to find but worth the look.  Use your imagination and go places that women go, not men.  I see women together everywhere and they would love to meet you.  Try flower shows, museums, grocery stores. . .and on and on.  And say you go to a flower show. . read up a bit so you have something to talk about to everyone.  Good luck.

AA11447210	Cheating is cheating. In my world, work stress wouldn't be a valid excuse. He was out of the country and decided to have some fun...that's what it boils down to.<br>  <br>  What STDs might he have brought home to you? When his stress was over and he'd won his deal, he cheated again (but with 2 women this time).<br>  <br>  Up to you to decide how to handle it...there are beautiful women everywhere. When's he going to see another one he wants to phuque and decide life is stressful and he needs release?|`|AA12262106	Your bf has demonstrated that he isn't loyal. Given that fact, all he needs is opportunity in order to stray again.Opportunity can present itself at almost any time, so you would have to be constantly on the lookout.<br>     The fact that he did it twice with the same hooker leads me to believe that he's not really repentant; there was no remorse or guilt after the first time(had there been , he wouldn't have done it again)and him saying he's sorry now is probably just a reflex designed to appease you.<br>      Assuming that you're faithfull, you deserve the same.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	If he would have grabbed a colleague or a random woman while drunk - then you might forgive him<br>  <br>  But, getting a hooker means this was planned, and thought about - and no, stress is NEVER an excuse.<br>  <br>  And, to add insult to injury, he did it again - planned and thought about.<br>  <br>  And some italian girls may be beautiful - but isn`t that besides the point? If he puts his parts in every woman prettier than you are - what kind of 'man'  is he?<br>  <br>  I think you may need to consider getting a new boyfriend.|`|BrSDvWacaa	In fairness to him you should allow for "out of town rules."  If he did this while he was still at home, I'd say he was being inconsiderate.  However, as long as he only resorts to this kind of behaviour when he's away you should keep an open mind.  <br>  Italian girls are beautiful; so are Brits, Swiss, Jamaican and many others.  What's a man to do?|`|hHndD5SEaa	Eh - I dont care what his reasons are - he hired a hooker - not once but twice - and then brought her friend as well!!! I would ditch this guy so fast he wouldnt even see it coming!!!<br>  How could you stay with someone that does this??<br>  xx|`|quul8Qkoaa	for me.that's cheating.how did u find out bout this?he told you?wow.if i were in ur situation,i wont forgive him..his not sorry.if he really loves you he wont do this to u.hired a hooker?that is not a solution.i hope this will help.how long u guys been together?|`|6e17209667f5095dbf74ca7bd2427f10aa	When come to love, it's you should be the one to make the decision. Her may have cheated on you, but at least he did tell you the true. There are many guys out there who did that but didn't tell their gals.|`|WO3dtNB5aa	you need to leave him asap. i'm under a tremendous amount of stress and i would NEVER EVER cheat on my boyfriend. think about how much you deserve because it's a lot more than this. just read what you just wrote--he has no respect for you.|`|QIqPwcH6aa	You shouldn't have to match anything here. He is an idiot! You should pack your suitcase and move the heck on!|`|Zjjl7hrOaa	yeah he will moset likely|`|mQn7JXsEaa	he will neva stop havin sex wid her ...|`|wHTErwGgaa	I understand your jealousy, stress or no stress - if he's in a relationship that doesn't give him the right to pay to get a ******* off some random italian lady. <br>  <br>  Although I do understand you are confused, there will be answers such as 'leave him, forget about him, hes trash' etc. But these people don't know how you feel, I know what it's like to go crawling back to an X even when you know it is bad for you.<br>  <br>  If he truely acts as if he's sorry then give him another shot if you really feel as if you love him. When he says he's sorry, is he just saying that to satisfy and reassure you? Or is he actually telling you that he regrets it? If you end up forgetting about the whole thing, perhaps search up some tips on blowjobs & stuff etc. So much so that you'll turn him on so much that he won't have to stray off anywhere else ;)<br>  <br>  I understand your problem, I hope this helped although there's not much else I can say. Just discuss it with him, a lottttt!! Tell him the possibilities that you might just leave him & your thinking about how no woman deserves to be treated this way. See his reaction then HA<br>  <br>  Hope this helped xxxx|`|0d7c42bc05e5b089e4e0d1fe9ce315a8aa	This is your Red Flag.  Run honey run.  He will think its ok to do this all the time when he is away.  Since he has been honest with you and you accepted the answer.  Then it is ok.  And every time he goes on business, he will have a reason to do what he does.  Next time it will be deal was going bad and I had to get relief.

A great way to do this is to gently move his hand to the spot(s) you want him to touch, and let him know this is what you like by letting out a moan, or telling him it feels good.<br>  <br>  If he is giving you oral and not hitting the right spots, just tell him "a bit lower", or "a bit higher" or whatever direction you need.  Again, give him positive reinforcement (moan, grab his head, tell him it feels good, etc.) once he hits the spot you like.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|GpNxs1ggaa	you can do it in a sexy way by showing him the next time you do it!<br>  just slowly start masturbating and ask him to help you and then continue to your activity ;D|`|c325AREXaa	to me,it's too early.how can people say that 'a couple of weeks' is already enough for sexual attraction?since u added ''is it too early to say anything?'',i think you and me are quite alike,where we do not take a relationship or love as only-about-sex.moreover,if the guy you are dating is not of those types who only like to be sexually attracted,you'll will probably spoil your good image if you ask him about that this quick.no,that's not ''no such thing as too early'',but yes,there's never too late.when your relationship with him is more stable,maybe you can try to open up a little bit to him,but not too over.not telling him everything you like,let him have the curiosity to try and check out what you like,keep yourself a bit mysterious to him,it'll be nice.don't you think so?|`|xyQRD8ahaa	to intimate him that you have sexual desire for him.. communicate with your eyes...<br>  <br>  if you can talk to him with your eyes and your body language! he would understand!!|`|R0U4qy6haa	boy you do not waste any time-a few weeks and already having sex-just tell i would like for you to try this for me|`|5aXKo6uCaa	rub him

The pressure to look good for women is so unreal and unfair in our society. It causes women to doubt themselves, even when they are pretty.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	No, most girls don't say it is only guys. It is girls as well. They have people constanly telling them that they are ugly and it is hurtful. How would I know. Because I had to deal with it. Even now when I would think I was pretty, I would remember a time when someone said somethingn mean and I wouldn't think I was pretty anymore. Now I am trying to break out of that. Also, not all girls are like this, because you have never met every girl, you have never met me... Not all of them see if guys want them, some of them ask for their opinion so they can feel better, instead of being told that they are pretty by people they know who will say something nice so you don't feel bad. I mean, I had females say "ew" right to my face and girls would laugh to a boy saying that he was going to take me to prom and the boy's friend saying that he should wear a bag on his head because he wouldn't want to be seen with me. Yes it crushed my self esteem and confidence, so when girls ask if they are pretty on here, I know how they feel and it is bad. It does hurt, we are not "whack jobs" because we do not think high of ourselves, we were just told we were ugly so much that we start to believe it. Please, you are not level headed. You sound like the Greek Mythology story of Galatea.|`|AA11841749	Ohhh, someone sounds bitter.  You're blaming your low self-esteem on women.  That's not very nice.  Not all women are shallow.

0ulKsvXlaa	Hey there, you are not shy with guys you don't fancy are you ?<br>  So there is a psychological decision made inside your head.<br>  The attraction that you feel for some boys is simply your brain emitting chemicals, after responding to sensurary input (like visual for ex.).<br>  This is a natural function of reproduction, which, since you are post puberty, your body is ready for.<br>  This shyness that occurs in boys and girls is a side effect from this chemical cocktail that floods your body. <br>  The only difference between you, and someone who doesn't appear to be shy, is how their "conscious self" deals with the signals their body sends shooting through them.<br>  In effect you are shy of these chemical signals within you.<br>  Other people accept these with ease. <br>  It is these chemicals that make you blush, make you tongue tied etc.<br>  <br>  So try this. When you see a guy you fancy, attempt to think and concentrate about someone you don't fancy, or even think about something completely different, like a sandy beach, or a past holiday etc.<br>  <br>  If the guy approaches you, imagine him 40 years older, with a "beer" belly, unshaven and balding. Try NOT to laugh at your thoughts. If you do and he asks you why you're laughing, tell him the truth. At least you've made the first contact.<br>  If he asks how you expected he would look like, then repeat what I just described, you should add that he would still be cute even then.<br>  Men like to be complimented just as much as women, but not so directly, and this approach would be ideal.<br>  He would know that you were flirting with him, maybe he'll reciprocate, who knows.<br>  In any event the ball will have started rolling, and you would not feel shy in this moment.<br>  It is just an example of how you can trick your own mind. <br>  You can consider other ways in which to do this also.<br>  That is all that "non shy" people do !<br>  <br>  PS  Most guys like shy girls, check out the answers|`|xWq93Ckyaa	i'm pretty shy too. i've dated plenty of guys. you just have to work at it every day and try to increase your confidence in yourself. eventually you won't be as shy anymore.<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ap5WGI7XOuOWY9X8zWYM7GPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220073521AAqoVQr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|RyYV3aXlaa	your a girl and we love all girls, shy,tall short,skinny,fat,blow up doll we don't care. we're men we're pigs and we're proud of it.|`|AA10857451	If i liked her in the first place then i wouldn't care how shy she was i'd still date her.

But, I wouldn't accept your true apology until you really sat down with me and looked me in the eye and really apologized. <br>  <br>  I think that everyone grows as a person and they learn from their mistakes. As for the girls who accepted your apology, it's hard to say if they truly forgave you. I bet most of them did, but a lot of people move on and can easily say "I forgive you" without actually meaning it. <br>  <br>  I hope you really did learn from what you've done and I'm also happy that you met a girl who you actually fell in love with.

AA11447210	It's fine really. No one has any commitments to anyone else, and who knows each of them may be considering other options as well.<br>  <br>  Keep getting to know each of them...you may find on a 2nd date with one of them that you like her a lot and may not want to see the other again. Or you may need another date or two with each to decide.<br>  <br>  You may ultimately choose one of them, or enjoy going out with both (or either) but not desire anything serious with them (so would need to make that clear).<br>  <br>  Right now, you are doing nothing wrong...just don't try to get either to think they are the only one you are seeing until that becomes the truth. It shouldn't come up at this point, but if it does be honest that they aren't the only person you are seeing but you wouldn't be going out with them if you didn't feel there was potential.|`|6XKlW3lyaa	As many as it takes.  Dating is dating, its not engagement.  Just make sure they understand its not a committed relationship YET.  Be careful exactly how far you let the dates go.  SCrewing 2 ladies is going to piss one off eventually, whichever you choose.  So screw with caution.|`|OGkPeww1aa	Umm, it is not nice to go out with too people. In the end, I cant help you. I really can not understand you can be interested in two women at the same time! Basically, you are going to choose on looks it seems.......|`|AA11786477	Listen, dating is about getting to know people and looking for the one who's most compatible with you. You don't owe any of them an explanation YET!<br>  Did you give them the impression that you were exclusive? If not, then there is nothing wrong with going out on one or 2 more dates to see which one you're more compatible with. Just don't continue to do it if you feel that they're under the impression that you're only dating them. This is coming from a woman, believe me, it's too early to tell which one you should pick...<br>  The other option you have is to slow one relationship/interaction down until you see where the other one goes.<br>  Example, go out with one twice in one week, make your decision, then go out with the other one if the 1st one doesn't work. You can also be honest about the whole thing. I would rather have a guy tell me that than play me for a fool.
tRNiXtplaa	im 26 been there done that. i had my first real boyfriend at age 21. things did not work out and ended up on a not caring about anything phase with guys and ended up the one hurt in the end. You have to look out for yourself because no one else will.

The guy who has a girlfriend is a dog|`|fBdtvrWdaa	I agree with that guy. You have low self esteem. You feel bad because you haven't had a boyfriend and you want to feel attractive but you do not need a guy to make you feel good about yourself.

It is a small and temporary fix that will balloon out and cause other problems and it will never fill that empty space. It is a cycle that will continue until you want to change it.<br>  <br>  He wants to sleep with you to use you…but he won’t have a relationship with you because he has a girlfriend.<br>  <br>  The best way to start a relationship is to go out and meet and mix with other people and start to get to know them and start dating and then progress up to the more intimate stages of a relationship. <br>  <br>  Do some research…..and find out what is involved in a healthy relationship. There isn’t a shortcut to building one and you need to take a long hard look at what you want your goals to be and then outline how you want to reach those goals.<br>  <br>  It helps to know what you want and how to go about reaching that goal.

Obviously it will take time for you to heal that wound, but I find that erasing anything and everything to the with your ex helps a lot. Otherwise you're only holding on to memories, which will hold you back.

Try to do things with your girl friends, like going to the movies and parties, because immediately dating another guy will most likely be painful. Slowly you will move on, as with any other break up, but you will probably always remember the boy who took your virginity, so it usually takes a little longer to get over|`|ukVNUgPFaa	just get over him. the guy that took my virginity is still my bf and is quickly on the way to becoming my husband so ive never experienced that. i guess you should try to get a new bf. you dont have to sleep with him to have him either. youll find someone who truly cherishes you and youll know that hes perfect. think of your past ex to be a stepping stone you had to get over to get to a happiness in your life.|`|LjxQv5TBaa	definatley just keep living your life. dont change anything you would normally do. because it will just take alot longer to get over him if you mope around all the time. act happy even when your not. <br>  try to hang around ppl that make you happy, so that you can keep your mind off things. focus on other things like friends, and school or work or something. <br>  i dont suggest dating for some time. because i know all i do is compare the ppl i am dating to that one special guy.. and it doesnt really help much.

But on the other hand if they know very little of her and you are attracted to her, i'd go for it.  Remember this, as you grow older, your mates will be doing their own thing and soon you may end up by yourself, or you can be with the person who has made you happier than you ever expected.  It's your choice.|`|LjxQv5TBaa	yes you should still date her<br>  your friends are there to support any decision you make.<br>  unless they dont like her for a good reason like she is trashy or a playerr and they are just watching out for you, then maybe you should rethink your decision. but if they just dont like her, and dont know her too well then their opinion shouldnt matter. its not like you need to bring her around to hang out with you and your friends.|`|ieTOMSbWaa	Yep i did, lost all my mates. 15 years later we split up and all my old mates got back in touch on facebook.

fBdtvrWdaa	Some people just don't want to date. She can still be pretty and well liked without having a boyfriend. Or maybe she was just waiting for a guy that was actually worth her time rather than dating a lot guys that she didn't have any interest in. I don't think you should really judge this girl just because she didn't date. Frankly, it's none of your business. She gave you an answer and you still keep wanting more drama? Grow up a little maybe?|`|IVjOPymhaa	yeah why is it not possible that she never had a boyfriend before.doesnt mean she didnt have she was not hot before and it is normal that some girls dont get attracted to guys easily.not all girls fall for guys easily|`|6fa2568b75c06da2670c61858c9441ceaa	Because not everyone was a slut in high school.|`|ov9bpT3Taa	,  Will you ask any of your friends what they think about this?|`|VSb6S6muaa	i really don't think that should concern you. everyone's different.|`|xKgZAp1Oaa	maybe she honestly just didnt like anyone there.

Make sure you give her a lot of eye contact, especially if your going to comliment on her eyes!

Just say she looks extra nice today or something. Girls don't really like it when you get all poetic while your asking them out. Save it for when you are out with her. That's a better time to say stuff like what you were planning. When you do say the quote "beautiful" things to her, pick the most unique thing about her, and then describe it in a way that makes her sound beautiful or perfect. Good luck!

I dont know exactly what you look like, but if anything your on the skinny side. 93 LB's and fat, your kidding me. Stop looking at magazines with models in them, its all BS. As for what I like in a girl, I like her to be smart and intellectual, now everyone thinks they are smart so, thats not a vague thing like it is for most people. I want her to be able to talk about real things in a prolonged conversation, and have her own opinion and be able to support it. Also, I like them to be nice and not shallow at all. I like them to see me as kind of more important than their friends, but not to abandon their friends either (If they go out with me that is). I like girls to be kind of more on the skinnier side, but not too thin, and I am not that picky either. Heightwise, I have no like rules, I have seen attractive women in all the spectrum, but, I typically like 5'2-5'6 for women, maybe weird since I am 6'4. I like them to be funny, but usually I am the person that makes people laugh, so I kind of want someone else who can make me laugh also. I am 16, so, what I look for in a girl might be different than your classmates, and I dont see girls objectively at all, which is almost unique.....|`|rH3OW2vQaa	that is not fat and girks always think that u guys a re fat but u need to get over your self and and that is okay|`|vJztD104aa	thats DEFINATLY NOT FAT! you should care about their personality. c'mon dude seriously......|`|5aXKo6uCaa	what i like in a "girl" is confidence and out going|`|pR0pJNJkaa	You shouldn't worry about what guys like. Be who you are. Take care of you. If you are heavy don't worry about what a guy may think of it. Worry about your health and work on it for you. You are 13 and there are grown women who couldn't answer your question. Many magazines claim to know btu that's nonsense too. Also, every individual likes different things. I like might like a woman with Mariah Carey build. The next guy might like the Calista Flockheart skinny type. Another person might prefer a "thick" woman like Jennifer Hudson. One person might like a blonde. One might like red head. What are you gonna do, change yourself for each guy you are involved with. Be you and be the best at that you can be and someone will appreciate you...the right someone.

I see them as weak and needy.|`|uSiTwFqwaa	Trust me if its real love, you can't be in love with 2 people, so think to yourself long and hard about which one of the 2 men you actually love, and then go for him, regardless of reason in my opinion, the worst feeling in the world is being apart from one you love.
AnfbrZFuaa	There's no real way to describe it. Trust me, you'll know. <br>  <br>  For me, I'd do anything for her, always be there for her, and do whatever it takes to keep her safe. I always want to be with her, but be willing to let her go if it would make her happy. All I want is for her to be happy, even if it's with someone else. I will always be the one she can turn to when she's in trouble. I'll always be the one to comfort her when she's feeling down. And no matter what, I'll always be there for her when she needs me.<br>  <br>  Physically, it feels like an adrenaline rush. My senses get sharper, by knees get weak, my hands shake.

ae06239e62818780ae57b9ae07468d3caa	Wait, but you weren't dating her right? In that case I honestly don't think they did anything wrong. I personally think it's stupid to "claim" someone that you like even if you aren't dating them. I think if two friends like the same girl/guy, then they should be mature about it and both pursue said person or forget about her/him altogether. Furthermore you even said that she wasn't even a good match for you. <br>  <br>  Granted, he should have told you that he was interested in her, but overall I don't think they did anything wrong. And they didn't keep it from you for malicious reasons, so while I think it would have been better to tell you, I think their intentions were good.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you were dating her and she started cheating on you with your friend, then I would definitely dump them both and move on with my life.|`|hHndD5SEaa	Its never easy knowing you've been lied to but i think that they did it with your best interest at heart. Are you sure you're feeling this way because they lied to you - or is it because you're hurt that she didnt want you but she did want him?<br>  xx|`|veeC7Rvvaa	Are you sure you're angry at them protecting your feelings while you were going through an already difficult time or the fact that she chose him over you?<br>  At least, they cared enough and thought about you before they did it.. you said it yourself, you wouldn't have been a good match anyways.<br>  <br>  You lost the girl, don't lose a friend too. Grow up.|`|b4199464cc3098e9c0df20d7671bd92baa	So you are saying friends should pity each other and so hiding important details from each other is ok.?<br>  <br>  You may have been upset at the short run, but would you have felt this angry as you did after you found out by "accident?"|`|ov9bpT3Taa	Hey there,  I've seen this question before, , I think you have to figure this one out yourself. Do what works for you.|`|15e58edf21f33dd475298413b3cd6d8caa	u feel betrayed & was lied too! think r these the friends i want if so go 4 it|`|AA11394554	life is tooooooo short to not forgive and forget put it bluntly how would you feel if you didn't forgive them and they got hit by a bus and you had never forgiven them now it would be too late and you would wish you had right?|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	It seems to me that they were keeping from you for you.  They had it in your best interest.  Remain their friends.  If you feel awkward around them just tell them you would rather be told the truth then be lied to.
iP863XM6aa	I would just ask him about it the next time i talk to him. <br>  But when i say ask, i mean ask, not b*tch at him about it lol If he was really tired, then there is a pretty good chance he just forgot to call you back and might have just hit bed. <br>  I wouldnt worry about it too much, im sure it wasnt his intentions to forget and hurt you. It probably just happened. Just ask him. Cant hurt.|`|DU72Bf5Caa	just ask him why he didnt call you back he probally fell asleep my bf has done that before|`|1VZzQs5Saa	ofcourse its normal babe, we're girls, we have emotions.<br>  i know exactly how you feel, i get that cut feeling all the time when my boyfriend is out and never calls.<br>  <br>  and it is a big deal for us, to them its nothing at all..<br>  i dunno i guess guys will just never understand.. but i reckon the best thing to do is talk to him about it and ask him for time a time to talk to you..<br>  <br>  you shouldn't keep this all to yourself you should confront your bf about this situation aswel in order to work things out.<br>  <br>  goodluck babe.|`|GvTg2jDfaa	You focus on it and bring it up, believe me you, all it will serve to do is make you look needy and drive him away. Think about it, either he did it to be mean to you (in which case...screw him), or he fell asleep and simply forgot (in which case focussing on it will only drive you and him crazy). Learn to deal with it..its life.|`|PzZcR5keaa	i usually get mad because he sayed he was and he didnt ...but i wouldnt get super mad at him...it happenss
ae06239e62818780ae57b9ae07468d3caa	Your boyfriend sounds like a real d-bag. Just talk to him and tell him it hurts when he says things like that. If he continues, leave him and find someone that will respect you. Trust me, there are good guys out there.|`|8j7FCEOraa	Smack him!<br>  I've got a big booty too!<br>  I have gained, and lost weight, and gained again all my husband could say is how sexy he thinks I am either way<br>  Tell your 'boy-friend' to either **** off or grow up!|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	well until he told you that you needed to do squats, I would have said he's a butt man and he likes the big booties.<br>  <br>  If you know you're fine then ignore the comment once.  If he says it a second time then tell him to kiss your booty and take one last look at it as it leaves his life forever.<br>  <br>  (honestly, what is up with the losers who have a fine woman they adore naked next to them and they feel it's necessary to pick apart her appearance?  Are you in So Cal?  The only place on earth where a 0 guy can get a 10 gal and he still thinks he can do better?)|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Bridgette, judging from your picture I think your so called boyfriend is a jerk and he thinks you have to be perfect so he can cart you around like a trophy girl friend. You should  have said something the minute he offended you. Be careful dating guys like him, no matter what you or how much weight you lose, it may not be enough for him. Unreal.|`|puMU4dIwaa	idk he's probably joking|`|oojO4WAraa	Dump him.  He is an insensitive *ss.|`|EmMxNWyLaa	tell him to grow one..|`|I6BBptQCaa	Black chicks *** is a comment. And if your avatar picture is really you, then he is a total d bag because I would never dream of calling you fat or ugly in a million years. Tell him he needs to go to the gym or something.|`|R0U4qy6haa	the next time he makes a comment like that just say oh i have been meaning to ask you this-does your d**k come in adult sizes also -or did you just get the small version|`|GpNxs1ggaa	you shouldn't do anything for him unless you feel like it!<br>  he's a dick and i would definately be offended and might even dump his a$$ ...|`|RsUEC74qaa	maybe he was just joking,but maybe he was serious,if i were you i would have said check yourself first !|`|qNDh5U0Haa	Is that you in your avatar?  If it is the guy is nuts.|`|KpO4UtElaa	yeah this guy sounds like a shallow loser. dump him!!!|`|ASLbRwQ8aa	wow not evenn.. tell him hes not man enough to handle ur fat ***|`|Wl0ZBIrDaa	It's fine I'm pretty sure she was just joking around you two act like you love eachother I don't think he would mean that seriusly after he said he loved it. I have the SAME exact problem I have a HUGE *** and everyone tells me and cAlls me speedbump I know pretty fukced up but my boyfriend jokes with me about my weigt all the time I have fat on my thighs Also it's pretty norMal.maybe you should talk to him about it to male sure if he was serious of not|`|Gabo2Uc7aa	I'm just really curious as to just how perfect he is or thinks he is!<br>  <br>  At the same time, sometimes it's good to listen to "constructive" criticism, if that is indeed what it is.  It would still have offended me even if it was contstuctive.  Also, he's a NEW boyfriend, not someone you've known for a period of time where it might be easier to accept that comment.  Probably ditch him.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	It sounds like he thinks you are getting a little chubby. That's rude and insensitive, especially if he knows you already have a large butt. If you haven't gained any weight, then just brush it off and try to forget it. Sometimes guys just say stuff like that without realizing that its hurtful. But if he continues to make comments about your appearance, and you know that you don't look any different, confront him about it and tell him that it hurts your feelings|`|djUMvICoaa	I don't know, you may have to rethink this relationship, as you already seem to be doing.  It's nice to get compliments about our body, but there is something about comparing it to someone else that gets creepy.  It's like a guy is getting hung up on looks and the rest of you doesn't matter anymore.  I think he hit rock bottom when he made the last statement.  It was like it may have been on his mind all this time, but he didn't have the b's to say it or he's now feeling that he is in the drivers seat, so to speak, and he is ready to rule.  And that this is going to be a hangup for him.  Sorry, I think you deserve better and someone who loves you for you the person inside, not just the outer wrapper.   good luck|`|GB3MVI1Maa	Tell him you dont like him doing that to you, and you are happy about you own weight nd  hell have to get over it cos you aint changing just for him.. <br>  say "Well if i do loose weight.. it wont be for you .. itll be for me!"#<br>  you do not look fat AT ALL to me on your picture .. i would be proud to have a body like you|`|pUNWFSDfaa	Maybe a few squats would help with the firmness of that awsome azz.

Give him time to evaluate what he really wants.  Don't tell him "i need space" or something dumb like that.  JUst chill out, have a good time with out him for a while.  I bet once you back off, he will come running for you.  If that happens, then the ball is in your court.  Don't make the same mistake again.  Let him come to you.  Relationships are like a scale.  For it to work right, there has to be a balance.  If you REALLY care about him a lot and you show it ALL the time, then he is going to back off because he feels too secure.  If he was ALL over you all the time, I am sure you would just want a break for a little bit!  you can care about eachother, but the root of most problems is that one person cares more about the relationship than the other.  There has to be desire on both sides and the only way to make that possible is to have a really healthy and fun PERSONAL life.  Trust me.  16 is still pretty young and there is a lot of fun stuff you can be doing at your age.  Don't pour everything into your relationship.  He should be chasing you and nipping at your heels.  Not fighting with you and ignoring you.  If none of this works, then break up with him.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I am a damn guru at this kind of stuff.
TN9mPQSyaa	Um, so what?  Is there such thing?  Well, you seem to think you're living proof - so I guess so.|`|QQv8f1vRaa	well liking chubbier girls aint a bad thing...ur attracted to whoever ur attracted to....it actually shows that ur not shallow like most guys but the fact that ur askin this questionl like this, kinda makes u look like a jerk cause if ur ashamed of it then dont do it!
PzZcR5keaa	be strong and dont back down....maybe you guys can be friends??|`|X8n4Qnkeaa	ok. i guess all these ppl suggesting to be "friends" have never broken someone's heart or had their heart broken. take it from the break up queen in highschool. i dumped em all! =/<br>  <br>  let her feel like she has a part of it. like it is kind of her decision. don't be super sweet about it bc that will make her keep on loving you. i don't at all mean be a total *** about it. just tell her how it honestly is. say that you can't keep going on in this circle of fights. and ask her to think about how she honestly is feeling with you. chances are she is probably worrisome/anxious all the damn time. she can't possibly be happy either not being loved. tell her she deserves someone who can give her everything she needs. and NO do not agree to be "friends" bc trust meee she will never ever fall out of love with you that way and she'll get crazy jealous....<br>  <br>  good luck!! :((|`|3vBALAlaaa	Listen- I know that it's hard for you to hurt this girl, but if you don't like her as much as she likes you, then it's not meant to be. Just think of it as bringing her one step closer to her meeting the guy that she's meant to be with! Tell her what you told us, and here's how to phrase it; <br>  <br>  "Hey babe, listen. These past two years with you have been wonderful. It's just that, I don't feel anything. I  think that we should part ways. We'll both find someone new, someone better. Love you! " or something like that.  <br>  <br>  Oh yeah- If she's BEGGING to be with you and throwing a pity party, you should have just dropped her. It's disgusting to beg someone to go out with you- it's sad. Don't take her back if she begs, she's not worth it. GL|`|ov9bpT3Taa	, Are you going to  surf the web to see if you can find other people with a similar question, sometimes the answer might already be out there. That is my opinion|`|AA11982696	dont be with her just because she begs.|`|LjxQv5TBaa	thats tricky.. definatley do it in person. and let her down as easy as you can. bcs that will be a really hard break up for her. dont completley leave her life bcs that will make it so much harder for her and for you to see her like that. so when you do it.. stay friends and try and hang out once in a while. maybe now suggest her to hang out with one of her girl friends. so that when you do break up with her she can have someone to go to. also try not to get with another girl right away.. bcs thats the point where she will really snap. and it suckss. good luck!|`|xyQRD8ahaa	if you have solid reasons to stay away from her.. talk to her and let her know - what you have inside you!<br>  <br>  try to bring her to a comfort zone and then put all that you have in you to her in the best way and diplomatically tell her that its the best choice for both of you..<br>  <br>  also tell her that she has to face this reality one day and let this day be it...<br>  <br>  tell her that you have come up to this decision keeping in mind that after talking to her, she would understand and do as per you tell her to as she would do anything for you!!|`|81jCGbj8aa	suggest being best friends. you can't stay with someone just because she begs you too. she's probably just afraid of being alone. she was with you for 2 years so your all she knows. be best friends at least then she knows your still there for her|`|i8FLbJ4Caa	just stay with her for the sex. you owe it to yourself.|`|JW9w8JkOaa	Its a pity, ur situation. The girl literally beggin u shows onething, u mean everything that keeps her life together for the fact that u put it together for her. It means one thing no other guy suits her bill like u do. She feels protected with u and hopes that u love her. She's loves but wat keeps her to u is like wat a child would do to her mother. you since u want to break up there are two points once how do you help her even while u break up? The answer is simple introduce her to  ur really true friends, fix a blind date tellin u want her to meet a nice friend of yours. By doin so u can certainly help breakin up with her with out shatterrin her world.
hI4m3Pnqaa	NO! Because you don't need to go through the stuff couples go through until you ready to get married, and enjoy life being a kid as long as you can. It doesn't matter if everyone else has one. It is you and your life that matter because one of your friend may get in trouble for tryin to have a BF and they're gonna be messed up for the rest of their life.|`|PmNGnHU8aa	idk i do. i've had a few already too.|`|PzZcR5keaa	i think you can but dont get to serious or dont do anything sexually with him...

M3pRAe7Vaa	No, I don't think that you will be single or have a poor relationship.  You just need to look in the right places for someone who shares your interests and is willing to give your lifestyle a try.  In addition, when you do find someone who shares those interests (non-smoker, non-drinker, prefers to stay home or visit friends for entertainment, loves to read), allow yourself to give his/her interests a try too; it's how relationships work.<br>  <br>  Some great places to meet people who share your interests are libraries, museums, coffeehouses, bookstores and bookstore cafes, etc.  You absolutely do not need to meet someone at a bar, those relationships are often developed over alcohol and may not be built on a true foundation.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|N3fpoUOzaa	well its not going to help you with the skills you need.<br>  But you'll always find some one.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|Z8rKLmh6aa	that's silly don't worry I'm like that too and look at me i have a boyfriend just wait for it there is a someone for everybody :DD
SapgcOZXaa	Whenever you spend any decent amount of time with someone, there are likely to be things they do that annoy you. There are probably things you do that annoy him, too. It doesn't mean you like each other any less or you should spend any less time together unless it becomes a constant thing. It's just the natural ebb and flow of a relationship, nothing to worry about. Also, depending upon where you are in your cycle, you can be more sensitive to things. If you're about to start your period, or you're ovulating (mid-cycle), you can have weird mood fluctuations and you can react more strongly than you normally would. But like I said, I really doubt it's anything to worry about.|`|djUMvICoaa	Katie, I doubt that it is out of the blue that this is happening.  I think something happened that upset you or you witnessed something and it made you uneasy.  Our minds can be sending us messages that the heart doesn't want to hear.  Almost anything else as far as incompatibility would have shown up long before this.  Check back to when this first started, was there something he said, something he did to someone else that was a warning sign that something wasn't right?  Those warning signs are usually the things that haunt you, telling you to be careful.  You usually have peace of mind in a healthy relationship.|`|HrDcaocMaa	Maybe because all those annoying little "quirks" are coming out...  You've been together for 5 months now, so he's probably feeling like he can be himself around you without having to impress you so darn much - You are entering the "relaxing" part of your relationship....|`|Jb2PZpMVaa	i feel the same way, is he doing something that you dont want him to do ?? <br>  <br>  is he not paying that much attention to you ?<br>  <br>  good luck ! <br>  <br>  hope this helped :) <br>  <br>  xxx|`|W55tjTcbaa	i get like this about once a month...ya know that certain time...ugh. usually it's right after my period or during it...don't sweat it! you will hopefully be feeling back to normal soon.|`|81jCGbj8aa	maybe your spending to much time together. that happens a lot. suggest a day for yourself. go hang out with your girl friends. you never no you might miss him after wards|`|EyaqiWPwaa	well you prolly havent been making him enuff sandwiches....|`|9EkFrApiaa	hormones or you are no longer in love with him|`|N3fpoUOzaa	maybe its out side factors that are stressing/annoying you which then puts you in a "cant be stuffed mood" and you then dont care to much about him. <br>  <br>  Good luck with it :)|`|AA11638999	I go through phases like this too. My guy and I will get along great for a while and I love being with him, but then all of the sudden he starts getting on my nerves and I don't even want to be in the same room with him. It's not really anything he's doing, just being himself. It really irritates me when he whistles songs, he thinks he some master whistler, but it really hurts my ears. Then a bit of time will pass and we'll be doing great again. Give it a little time, every relationship goes through cycles. If you don't start feeling better about him in at least a month, maybe it's time to move on. Good luck!|`|vuDE5TPbaa	Do you guys hang out alot? Because close proximity to a person for long periods of time eventually leads to frustration.<br>  <br>  I would suggest seeing him a little less. Maybe some days out of the week hang out with your friends AND Him. Or just your friends.<br>  <br>  Absense makes the heart grow fonder. (lame I know, but it applies)|`|224598c2e3c1d07cad06c082f551c456aa	that has happened to me...it was just some sort of phase i was in.<br>  maybe its your hormones? or maybe there is something building up that he did that you didnt like.|`|l8Q3n8WUaa	ITS NOT U ITS HIM!

I flirt with girls in front of my girlfriend - it makes her feel more special when I start and end every day with her. <br>  <br>  Tell him you've made your mind up and he looks like a fool. And he'll probably chat **** about you behind your back. If he starts some rumor or something, just go with it and get with someone else.

In my opinion|`|AA11982696	its not really cheating but its still very wrong . tell him its over and let it go .|`|uuKrtkTmaa	well yes its considered as cheating because at the time you was with him and you flirted with some other guy which is cast as cheating on your bf obviously thats cheating ... well if he still loves you and your sure about that you should go back and tell him that you are really sorry for what you did and you will be sure that you will never make the same mistake again this only counts if you love him aswell and want to be with him|`|qRaMZi6Baa	Flirting is not cheating, but it does some times lead to that. If you do not feel the same way about him then just tell him that you don't want to be with him.

lKZrpqwQaa	I guess it all depends on your age. I would suggest Silverado Country Club's bar. If you are more up valley then maybe Pancha's.

Now as you imagine that, and how great it would be, can you think of the ONE and only thing that this magical relationship will definitely lose, no matter how good the relationship is?<br>  <br>  The answer is: Butterflies.  <br>  <br>  After those first few dates, and first few kisses, its gone.  And hardly ever comes back.  <br>  Humans, men AND woman need to realize that and not be too hard on their mates when situations like this present themselves.  <br>  Now, I know I do not everything about your relationship, but here's what you've given me so far:<br>  A) He came out with this email and SHOWED IT TO YOU.  This tells me openness, trust, etc.  Sounds like a good thing to me.<br>  B) Another female had sexual dreams and/or wants YOUR MAN.  This tells me you have something that is desired by others.  Sounds like a good thing to me.  Would you want to be that other person, or be you, the one who gets it?????<br>  C) You have insecurity issues. Which generally leads to jealousy and all that crap no one likes.<br>  <br>  You asked what he was trying to accomplish.  I'm sure you love your man, and would never cheat on him.  But you need to go into a quiet room by yourself and ask yourself this question:<br>  If an attractive fella told me I was his dream girl and he fantasized about me,  how would that make me feel?  If you say "Eww, I would hate that" you are either lying or lacking a sex drive (which would explain a whole lot about this question in the first place).  <br>  Now, if you said "That would feel incredibly good, and it would make me feel sexy and beautiful and wanted." then you would understand what or why your boyfriend enjoyed hearing that another woman fantasized about him. <br>  You should be happy with what you got, don't be the jealous type and be happy he told you about it.|`|VilT7P2saa	It sounds as if he was most likely just interested in the details of the dream. On the other hand i'm sure that he was a more than a little flattered that she was having this sort of dream about him in the first place. It is more than likely that it was her intentions that were less than noble. Keep an eye out on this situation... and her.|`|s8yCwPedaa	It sounds as if your boyfriend is being honest, if he was doing anything behind your back, he wouldn't have said anything to begin with.<br>  So I'm thinking you got yourself a good man there, and you should be proud of his actions thus far.|`|rz7GfvPNaa	Men think from their trousers, most of the time if he hasn't done anything an apologized he means it, he probably just got excited about the fact some woman was talking about sex with him. from what you've said its nothing to worry about.|`|pn2t0gejaa	He told you that is a big deal. Not hiding it should say a lot .we sometimes like to feel sexy just like lady's do it is a big ego trip|`|67QVKHQ3aa	it could be either but i find that when a man really loves you and you have been in a relationship for a long time, occasionally they feel the need to reassure themselves that they..." still got it" so unless you get that real uneasy feeling in your gut that most women get when their man is cheating then i wouldnt worry about it..maybe try doing something un-expected like dress up real sexii for him one nite and rock his world, (you know get a babysitter, cook him a meal, candles, the whole 9) it worked for me, so i dunno give it a try!|`|Fo1Gm4Xnaa	A good example of ego inflation and one to forget about,|`|zfWmQst5aa	I'm sorry, but this guy sounds like complete garbage! how can he do something like that while he has a kid? i know he may have been honest but that could have been because he knew that you wouldn't over react!<br>  <br>  I think he wants out :/|`|AA11278694	yeah I would say hes just trying to get you to trust him. So mission accomplished!|`|15e58edf21f33dd475298413b3cd6d8caa	he told u about it so don't worry,worry when he doesnt tell u|`|jVUEohsNaa	Once I got married my wife and I dumped all friends of the opposite sex.  It would be TOTALLY inappropriate for me or her to email in a social manner a member of the opposite sex.<br>  <br>  We want our marriage to last, and are being careful and loving.<br>  <br>  You aren't married yet, so this is your chance to decide if he is going to be the one... it doesn't sound like it to me.
6rvzeOsqaa	ditch her.  she doesn't really know what love is.|`|Z8rKLmh6aa	um write her a love letter by telling her everything she means to you if she's still bad to you then forget about it go find a better one|`|laOQ1OAQaa	talk to her about it. if you love her and she loves you back you should be able to convince her out of doign the things she does.|`|XRX6vKNmaa	BOUNCE OUT OF THAT RELATIONSHIP! If she loves you, she will NOT hurt you period. Love should Never hurt so please do not mix them up. My mother said she loved my father but she almost Killed him. Please be careful.|`|56zYVjdTaa	Sometimes people tell lies...|`|tkUCHhAdaa	Learn english and ask the question again.|`|6PdQELgdaa	if you really love her , love is blind, so ignore all her mischief|`|V6dz395kaa	um, take her to a nice dinner and show her ur love 4 her.|`|QMpCqZZnaa	It depends on what she is actually doing to you.  I find that 90% of any arguments that I get into with my husband are actually misunderstandings because we have different views on what is happening.<br>  <br>  If there is any kind of physical abuse, or cheating, that is disrespectful to the idea of your relationship, and probably not love.  Also, if the relationship is emotionally abusive, it is something you'll want to get out of.  Sometimes it is hard to tell what is emotional abuse and what is just arguing, so I included a site to help you find the warning signs.|`|YKCIubvKaa	Anyone can SAY they love anyone. You have to weigh whats going on. Do you truly believe she loves you or is she saying it just to cover up for what she did wrong? Can you stay with her if she keeps doing this bad behavior? Is she going to continue doing this bad behavior even when you ask her to stop?<br>  Honestly if you talk to her about her and she doesn't change or get better in some way than she may not love you as much as you think. And although you love her your only going to be hurting more later on.<br>  No one can tell you to stay or leave her. I wish you luck.|`|uskqX5bNaa	It all depends on what she is doing.<br>  Does she know how much you hate it?<br>  Have you tried telling her?<br>  Maybe she does really love you,<br>  you guys just have to get through the bad things.<br>  Its hard, yes, but there is a solution somewhere.<br>  Its all what you feel in your heart.<br>  Good Luck!|`|WB7sFVxAaa	no, but she can say she loves you and then USE you like an old rag<br>  <br>  if she doesn't show her love to you, get the hell outta there|`|el8yX5q3aa	Give her up.  Get some self respect man.....and stop being a doormat.  She isn't going to respect you anymore no matter what.<br>  <br>  She does not love you.  People that love you treat them carefully with respect because what you feel is important to them.<br>  <br>  Man up dude....dump her and find someone who is good to you.|`|oojO4WAraa	Dump her.  Don't waste your love on someone that is mean to you.|`|GhETSRdUaa	She do bad thing to you? Aw....<br>  <br>  How terrible. Any ***** in the world can SAY they love someone. You are capable of telling a stranger that you love them, with the proper vocal chords. <br>  <br>  It's the actions that prove so.|`|nYEwK5FNaa	Ok? Well it depends what she does to you... If you're gonna ask a question like that, you need to provide more information! Speak with correct grammar as well please.|`|Po2UqfvWaa	love is only a 4 letter word. anyone can say it. it's actions that show love. there truly is no love if actions lack showing|`|Vp83Fuakaa	the more you suffer the more it shows you really care
FR1SoLteaa	I'd leave, your gonna be paying for her retirement, and she will be banging somebody else|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Don't propose. She is scum and you deserve better. If the child is yours, take care of it. You don't have to be married to her to do that.|`|oeEsnwSMaa	No you do NOT ask her to marry you! I think you know this|`|BMEMH7JLaa	April of 2020 maybe|`|gYWDrHVFaa	No, do not propose.|`|0ulKsvXlaa	You will never be sure, even if she never cheats again.<br>  Before you think about proposing, get conformation that the baby is indeed yours.<br>  Only after this can you decide.<br>  During this time you can learn more about your girlfriends promise never to do it again.<br>  The biggest problem is your girllfriend is aroused by dominant men. This is obvious, because she so easily succumbed to the advances of someone that had previously misused her.<br>  This hunger which attracts her to this kind of person is part of her nature.<br>  She wishes to marry you for different reasons, you give her security and love.<br>  I believe she will one day cheat on you again. A dominant guy will take her fancy and "use and abuse her" the way she likes it.<br>  Perhaps I am wrong.<br>  Maybe she did it just this one more time to get it out of her system.<br>  People can change.<br>  Can you learn to trust her, if not the marriage will not last ?|`|GpNxs1ggaa	no .. even if you forgive her , this was too bad to go on and marry her..<br>  at least wait until you are really sure that you love her enough .. <br>  but my oppinion it that cheating is unforgivable .. and she will most likely do it again .. and in those situations , it was even worse. .|`|H3WHxCgaaa	That's a deal breaker.  Move on and let it go...<br>  <br>  Nest time - try marriage prior to trying for children...it really does make a difference when you already have a profound commitment to each other.|`|CWVBfaPwaa	Sounds to me like she is playing you. If you're always going to have this distance between you two then I'd reconsider the engagement if I were you.|`|AA11278694	I think you have lost touch with reality! No you should not marry her unless you don't mind her doing different guys every few months . Maybe your the type of guy that gets off on her habit.|`|6XKlW3lyaa	dump her, forget her.|`|15e58edf21f33dd475298413b3cd6d8caa	if this is what u like...get real girl|`|qKpgMkjSaa	Your relationship trust has been seriously comprimised at this point. It would be silly to ask her to marry. However, we can all sit here and give you advice, but ultimately YOU know HER better than anyone here. Personally, I wouldn't propose (not yet at least) also, try break that distance barrior. Girls and guys need to be held and comforted and yes even being intimate, and if she's not getting it no matter how much you guys are when you're around, she's going to look for the easiest way she knows. At least take comfort it was her ex, and not some stranger she met at a bar who couldv'e given her an STD. Not the best way to look at it, but I guess things could be worse.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Dude, a DNA test is not meant to strengthen your bond. In the words of Vito Corleone, "You can act like a man!". Raise your right hand high over your head and slam it down with great velocity straight into your groin. Then follow which ever path results;<br>  <br>   A-If it doesn't hurt then go ahead and propose, you have no balls anyhow and you'll be lucky if this little bone smuggler will take you. <br>  <br>  B- If you find yourself in great pain, you must not propose you do indeed have balls and they are in great pain right now. You are capable of pulling yourself together and finding another female that wont spread her legs like soft butter on hot toast every time you turn your back. Move on and enjoy the beautiful and trustworthy women that are out there looking for the damaged but good hearted man you seem to be.|`|1pjyJq1iaa	Does this really need to be spelled out for you? <br>  If you don't want to deal with your wife to be sleeping around with this guy, (because a ring on a finger or paper in the courts only makes things messy when they are breached).<br>  You decide.|`|tLuALLwQaa	chances are if she done it once she will again,what will her reason be next time you went to work and i got horny?|`|ERjrzGwGaa	are you crazy??!!! how can u be in love with someone like that? she will be SO much pain to you in the future!|`|gAC9Ish8aa	You have a big situation. I think once a person cheats on gf/bf will eventually do again.  Once a cheater, always a cheater. She could say that she is sorry but you don't know if she is going to do it again. I think you should see if she is really pregnant. And if she is wait until she gives birth. But wait, if im not mistaken I heard you don't have to wait for her to give birth and take the DNA test. You can do take the DNA test while she is pregnant. I think you have you have to wait a couple of weeks or couple of months. <br>  <br>  I hope that is it your child and not her ex. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|ycVaqjc4aa	You would be stupid to ask her to marry you, first off once a cheat always a cheat, and if she is used to be treated like crap then she will always be drawn to people that will treat her the same way. I think you should find a new chick and hope that she's not prego... your asking for a life of unhappiness.
1YGFphjMaa	Give him a chance, everyone deserves a chance, what will it hurt? tell him to lay off a little, if he really cares about you it will be well worth it.|`|FmhUZLgoaa	No it sounds like he might have a issue with girls.|`|R0U4qy6haa	no you were fine -he is just to over anxious|`|laOQ1OAQaa	Nope he is the one bring his own doom You are in the right, you tried doing what you could and what you thought was appropriate and he shut you down, he isn't worth the trouble.|`|z3g6G4cTaa	its him =/<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=As3L9_SN2r6F1kx7ms8EbMPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220065039AAyM2Yv">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ahs_rB1jW7b0foaEPca_LQDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220064750AAEjN7m">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|a984cQjKaa	the kid's a psycho.  i mean, really, telling you he loves you after knowing you a week?  get real.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	You did not do anything wrong. He just needs to grow up a bit more and gain some self confidence.|`|iTJWopCRaa	if you're asking if you led him on.... then probably yes. If you can tell the guy is desperate, make it CLEAR you're not interested. but the guy has some issues. he's being very insecure and hence rushes everything. if you still want to be his friend, explain to him that you just don't do that to a girl, because you'll end up pushing them all away. Trust me, he'll listen to you now.|`|zvifDjJQaa	I wouldn't waste my time worrying about him! If he's clingy like that before you ever started dating imagine what he'll be like *after*. Although we are all responsible for 1/2 of what happens in a relationship, I would say he's the one with the prob!|`|NekOuxFEaa	It's not your fault that he's obsessive and overreactive, that's probably why he doesn't have a girlfriend. Cling and obsessive and over-emotionally connected = not good. Sorry, but don't worry it wasn't you.|`|TWm5Smlaaa	no, you didn't do anything wrong! haha sounds like he's crazy and clingy.|`|12gvcc2Daa	no. but you shouldnt let a blind man stumble to his death. why don't you tell him why he's an idiot.|`|81jCGbj8aa	haha sweetie he sounds like a weird one. its him not you! clingy guys are the worst|`|Vrdi2gL6aa	na he did..u needed ur space and he didnt give it to u..thats his bad:p
crZg76Hpaa	Move on, he's done with you.
fP46meSmaa	It would be easier to answer if I knew what kind of group it is.He must really be afraid of his sister.Maybe try to be friends with her.**
JlDcVTVsaa	Maybe he just didnt think that valentines day is important for you, and didnt buy you any thing. <br>  and after he saw you got flowers he realized that he should have sent you some thing, but he used the flowers as an excuse for not sending you any thing.<br>  <br>  if you are on a long distance relationship, he should have sent you the gift before valentines day... and at that time he didnt know about the flowers, right?<br>  <br>  I wouldnt bring up the flowers again, but if you want you can tell him that you were expecting a valentines gift from him, and it hurt you when he didnt give you any thing.|`|c2uywBsIaa	I would just let it be. Any man would feel the same. In a way you are lucky because most men would also bring it up every time he had an opportunity. Bottom Line, you have done nothing wrong. His reaction expresses that he cares for you. He does not want any other man to get it the way of you two.|`|5fbEEzjoaa	Tell him you sent them to yourself since he was so far away and you miss him, that you know he would have gotten you something if he were closer so you took care of it for him!|`|xDZ3lqMIaa	he apparently cares for you and i would bring it up if you are worried that hurt him.|`|d5sAojVmaa	It is not your fault that someone had given you flowers. Especially, that they did not put their name on the card. Why is he punishing you and ruining your valentines day together when it wasn't your fault. Its not like you asked someone to send them to you to get a rise out of him. He needs to know he ruined the valentines day for you and it was selfish of him to do that. He could have made it sweet but instead he allowed his insecurity of himself and the trust in your two's relationship to ruin it for the both of you. I WOULD BRING IT UP AGAIN!|`|ed3eK4mHaa	I think you need to see the red flag waving in front of your very eyes.<br>  <br>  He most certainly does blame you for this, otherwise he would have given you a nice, "I love you" gift for Valentine's Day. Other than whatever he has told you, do you know why his marriage broke up? It sounds to me like he harbors bitter feelings, and I wonder if he used these punishing techniques on his former wife. Most women want to believe the former wife was a real loser, but most of the times, they're women just like you who have been mistreated by their men.<br>  <br>  I think this is a red flag, my friend, and I hope you proceed with dire caution. He seems to be a very passive, vindictive man, and my guess is in time you will see more of this petty little behavior on his part. Most men who are single/divorced by his age, are that way for a very good reason. Women will go to the wall for their husbands. Wonder what the wife had to endure with this man?<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|vIsLImzbaa	Thats strange. I think you are right for feeling hurt. Its not like you did anything wrong. <br>  Cut the ends of the stems & put them in fresh water & just enjoy the roses. Who cares who they are from. Its not like youre cheating.

dcf4c1dec6ae1f9fba85b09be4c45028aa	I have always said that until you walk down the isle, say I Do and Kiss, all is fair in love and war.  Now is the time to let him know how you feel, not after he is married.  What if he is thinking the same about you but is afraid to say anything to you because he doesn't want to look like some scummy pig who is hitting on other girls while he is engaged to be married?  <br>  <br>  If you feel that strongly toward him you need to sit down and talk with him, heart to heart.  Start off your conversation with an apology saying "I sorry if this comes across to you as inappropriate or makes you feel uneasy but I just wanted you to know that I have strong feelings for you.  I wanted to tell you now because once you get married it would be inappropriate to say anything."  Then stop talking and listen to what he says.<br>  <br>  Be careful, if he says anything like he wants to be with you without canceling or postponing the wedding all he wants is to have sex with you on  the side.  You don't need that.  If he does change plans with his fiance then move forward, he may be your future spouse.<br>  <br>  Remember that having this conversation could also end any relationship you have with this guy.  But if he is not going to be your guy then it really doen't matter, does it?<br>  <br>  Have a great life.<br>  <br>  By the way, you will be doing this couple a favor if you do have this conversation with this guy.  If you can easly turn this guy's head then his fiance really will not want to be married to him.|`|vTx6BVQDaa	if he knows he wants to settle down with this girl (which thats exactly what engagement means.....) let him be. nobody likes the girl that breaks up happy couples. move on. and find your own man to find a happy ending with.   why hurt innocent people? plenty of fish in the sea|`|vIsLImzbaa	Wow you really need to back off. I am engaged & if I found out some girl was trying to go after MY fiance, girl you'd be in major trouble. <br>  Just move on. Theres a million guys out there & its pretty low to go after a man who is already taken.|`|NpTPZ175aa	You can't have him, he is taken.<br>  And even if you won him over, he would be breaking his integrity toward his fiancee. Would you really want him then? Or trust him?|`|vJrrcPJGaa	ganga|`|5mTKspfYaa	RUN AWAY!|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Nothing wrong with liking him but I suggest you stop wasting your time. Your only headed for let down and heart ache.|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	I hope his fiancee is black, puerto rican, or Dominican so when she finds out what you are doing she puts you in a hospital where you will be sucking all your meals through straws.|`|lvOR401haa	Leave him alone - don't even TRY to win his heart.<br>  <br>  He loves someone enough to want to marry them, and you're on here plotting a way to win his heart???<br>  <br>  If you were engaged and found out another woman was trying to win your fiance over, how would you feel?  Pretty bad I would imagine.<br>  <br>  Respect his choice and respect yourself - to try start a relationship this way shows you don't respect relationships and it sets a bad example to how yours (with him if it worked) would be.<br>  <br>  Find another (single) guy.|`|Cv2h6n1Raa	Hes not married yet. Until theres a ring on his finger I say go for it. People call off engagements all the time. What if you are ment to be?|`|rAbp4qaXaa	Walk away.|`|xDZ3lqMIaa	Yes yes you are DON'T do that!!!!!!!!!!

oFzPbcsnaa	For the UK you need to be at least 16 to "legally" have sex with them.|`|QUmqfjSuaa	yeah fourteen.|`|6XKlW3lyaa	depends where you live.  some states you have to be 18, some its only 14.|`|hNwqqn3Waa	The general rule to remember is, if the person you are interested in is under the age of 24, then you have to be 16. If they are 24 and older, then you MUST be 18. The safest thing is to wait until you are 18.|`|d53507ff674901cfc353ab962084cae7aa	If you mean sexual "stuff", then you have to be over 16, the "age of consent" in Great Britain.|`|kckLAUzhaa	18 or 14 depends on where you live
NQFV2AdZaa	It's sad i know, but you have fallen out of love with him. It's rare to have a lasting relationship with a childhood sweetheart. You obviously need to talk with your husband and decide finally what you truly want. Of course he'll cry as he still loves you, but you need to do what makes you happy before you start to totally resent him. Good luck.
sgRDJUXqaa	Your relationship with M is not over.  Just go talk to him and ask him out on a real date, with no other couples.  If he won't do it because of his friend's feelings, so be it -- but you won't know until you ask.<br>  <br>  As far as S is concerned, he's a lost cause.  I don't think he was ever really over his ex, and I think he does like you and was hoping he was over his ex so he could move on.  But he can't, and therefore he is undateable.  You should choose to not have a relationship with him at all.  You can't control who he is friends with, and your comment that "if he does choose me I am planning to speak to him about making sure she is not always in the background" shows that you are not ready to date a man like him.  You would be coming into the relationship without trusting him, and that means it will fail.  So forget about S; that relationship is done.<br>  <br>  Now if you can't get over S, do not hurt M or you will be exactly like S has been to you just now.
T7qgrOJzaa	Then what's the problem? It's agreed you two don't want to be with each other, so just let it go. <br>  <br>  The fact that your a virgin still is a personal choice you have made and you should never feel bad about it. One day you will not be a virgin and the smartest thing you can do is wait for the right guy. The right guy will want to be with you, whether your a virgin or not.<br>  <br>  Tell your friend to stop pressuring you. When your ready you will know. Just go with the flow and follow your instincts and ALWAYS be true to yourself. It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. Keep your chin up. Good luck! :)|`|joo2Y8HAaa	It will be okay. I know lots of people who are around their 20's and are virgins. you want to save something special you have for someone special.|`|qrv7kEzfaa	then do that! lol y r u spending time listening to stupid ideas? u r jus fine! some ppl arent into the relationship thing and wanna be independent and have their own fun which is totally cool. right now u dont report to any1 and have ur own space. keep it that way till the right one comes along. dont force it|`|TWm5Smlaaa	good for you, wait for someone you love and feel completely comfortable  around and for someone who won't judge you based on your sexual experiences. My first time was a huge mistake!
zfWmQst5aa	She's wiping off your saliva|`|b8tqTXFdaa	She was probably really happy when you kissed her. When you're attracted to someone, you touch parts of your body you want them to touch, or you touch yourself because you're making sure you're looking good for them :) Perhaps she was trying to savor your kiss too, i dunno.|`|D5AepfDkaa	It is just a reaction I wouldn't be that worried about b/c my boyfriend asked me the same thing but it is kind of a flirty thing
HrDcaocMaa	maybe he feels more secure in your relationship that he doesn't feel the constant need to check up on you....|`|ed3eK4mHaa	He's just not that in to you.<br>  <br>  Get the book. It will open your eyes to the truth behind this kind of behavior and save you a whole lot of embarrassment and heartache.|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	Because he's too busy with me.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	That's not normal.  I talk to my boyfriend a minimum of 2 times a day if I don't see him.  He doesn't have an attachment to you, it speaks volumes about your relationship.  I would call him and tell him it's over. "He's just not that into you."  Sorry.<br>  <br>  Haha not to laugh at your situation but all of our responses sound like the movie "he's just not that into you." I didn't even notice it was everyone elses response also.  But it's true. Great movie go see it.|`|V6dz395kaa	Maybe because he wants a break and hang out with his friends. Guy hate calling girls too so yea. Hope this helps!|`|sIAiKAZuaa	Cuz he's too busy wit Jane S.|`|AA10745032	he is not into u|`|aYZXi6ffaa	In some relationships the significant other thinks they have other person wrapped around their finger.  What I would do first if I were you is pull back.  Don't call him, see if he starts coming around.  You'll be amazed at what a little bit of ignoring a person does for you!!!  If he doesn't call or come around unfortunately you will have your answer and its time to move on.  Good luck!|`|uskqX5bNaa	Well if you guys see each other<br>  then you don't always need to call each other,<br>  but if you don't see each other that often, or at all<br>  maybe he's not worth wasting your time.<br>  4 months isn't that long after you've been together for 2 years.<br>  I wish you well with your decision!|`|vGhhoQQkaa	Unless he has life or family issues then move on... he sounds like a waste of time.<br>  <br>  Don't ask guys to call you, it makes you look desperate!<br>  Move on, get a new one...there's plenty of them.|`|QyxLVNCWaa	He may be busy.<br>  <br>  He may be feeling tired of this relationship.|`|y4w6ybr3aa	Sorry honey, but sounds like he may not be that into you.<br>  I would stop calling him and move on.|`|vIsLImzbaa	Maybe he wants you to call him.|`|Vrdi2gL6aa	bcuz hes probly a lil to busy.. ^^^^<br>  and or he has alot on his mind|`|SSqwm7Vnaa	He's probably ju8st busy, no need to worry. (not busy with that prossy, but just being a bit more laid back with other stuff?) :)<br>  <br>  Take him to a themepark ^^|`|kckLAUzhaa	he's just not that into you any more. Have you ever seen that movie? Go watch it, its called he's just not that into you. Good movie, I loved it :]|`|svrrbZU0aa	You have included little information. Did you have a fight of offend him ect. If not move on he could be seeing someone else.|`|xKgZAp1Oaa	maybe he just thinks he does have to anymore. Or he's busy. Just tell him you really like it when he calls you and see if that changes anything.|`|HosJ3bNgaa	there a film that express your problem its called he just not that into you|`|YZafHtVKaa	hi heaw anada girl|`|w986xFOpaa	maybe hes losing interest (not tryna b rude)
oUcLSDZ6aa	First of all, I think that you're having a really hard time explaining the circumstance, which makes me think you're pretty young, not to mention him bringing his mom into it. <br>  <br>  You told him you wanted to be friends. You need to ask yourself something very important. Can you be his friend, and nothing else? If not, then you need to let him go, being dishonest about your intentions will only end with him being more upset, and you getting hurt again. <br>  <br>  The only thing you can do is give him space, and use the time to focus on other things. School, your friends, and yourself, once you are in a better place emotionally, you'll have a better view of the situation, so you can both move on. <br>  <br>  Besides, if he does come back to you, which he might, wouldn't you rather it be because it's what he wanted for himself, not because he felt sorry for you? <br>  <br>  Leave your friend out of it, she'll only make things worse.<br>  <br>  Stay strong.|`|LbqIo9H8aa	hard to say but it sounds like u really love him i think u should text him and tell him that u really have a strong love for him and tell him u messed up and ask him to give u another chance and that you'll wont make the same mistake|`|NrmdwT8Baa	FIRST OF ALL!<br>  <br>  What did you do wrong? Valentines day is not a friggen family day its a person that your dating. He should have spent Valentines with you. <br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  But the problem is guys don't like when girls are too clingy. He need to stop asking to be his friend. Being friends with some when you have feelings for NEVER work. It only bring more pain and extends the healing time. True love comes from both sides and not just one. So if he doesn't love you then in reality, he wasn't the person you were meant to be with. The guy needs to chase the girl not vise versa. You can live without guys so just move on. I don't think he will come back but hey! I don't know him better then you do.<br>  <br>  Wish you luck,<br>  Aly|`|jhNUuz0maa	Probably not. He went out with you when he ended it with his ex. You were the rebound girl. I doubt it would have worked out at all. What you need to do is just ignore him. Just let him go and let him do his thing and you do yours. If you have a chance to get him back, you need to totally ignore him. Once he thinks you are out of the picture, then he will probably start thinking about you and once that happens, he will contact you. Once he contacts you, he should be yours again.|`|k7SOs18raa	i am very doubtful that in two months you could've fall in love with him and viceversa...also, if this was the case that he was in love with you then just simple arguments between you too cant destroy the relationship...love is a strong feeling that just doesn't disappear from night to dawn...you were wrong when you inmediately took him after he broke up with that girl, in other words you were just a re-bound...this you must learn to avoid this kinds of problems in the future...i am just confused how you think you blew up the relationship?
Q3DfmT5Gaa	well that kinda sucks i would suggest throw a party and try and connect with him there and see where that takes you
9UNZHnt4aa	look you know my opinion of this girl<br>  but if she's causing you this much pain <br>  then you need to just focus on your friends<br>  and your family, get a job, try to get your license <br>  try to better yourself..hey maybe if she sees you all <br>  put together with your life all sorted out <br>  she'll come back to you .|`|GpNxs1ggaa	it's called depression honey .. you can get help for it.. i did and feel a lot better. <br>  and to answer you question , since you hit the rock bottom , the only way is up :)|`|6XKlW3lyaa	I had a crash like that once.  After a few hards weeks i started to do stuff again.  After a few months i started to enjoy doing stuff again.  Then sooner or later i realized what i wanted and started looking for a sweet kind woman to be my wife.  Ended up finding one that fit the description sooner than i expected.  Been uphill ever since.  It just takes time.|`|inK7e8VXaa	I know what you are going through my wife of 2 years left me for a 18 year old punk! (she is 32) Ihave been going through mortal hell but its starting to get better. I find joy in knowing they have just broke not for sure how things will work out between us just glad we still talk!|`|y78miRvQaa	You sound depressed. Do you have any opportunities to help other people,also you need to do some dreaming about what you want out of life from there you can set some new goals to get you there.
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	uh...maybe learn to speak English...
pubzTL1Kaa	Hmm He Would Probably Come Up To You Or Like Always Be Some Sort Close To You.|`|S0XPrJ2laa	if he smiles at you a lot.|`|QJ19OBCbaa	That's a tough question. Mainly because all I know about him is that he's a guy and that he may or may not enjoy staring people down. On the other hand, I know even less about you. So there we have it - 2 people of the opposite gender (assuming you're female) engaging in a stare-down. Well I have all the information I need.|`|V6dz395kaa	Well, if u keep doing this, he'll lose intrest in u. so, make an approach by first saying hi and introducing yourself. Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|AVYuZ9uIaa	ususally a guy'll give you attention like hugs or just trying to talk to you a lot|`|Bf8PVFSSaa	You ask him. I hate these questions.<br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.|`|e7a5a3e802c87fca0253811255c9ab2baa	yes i really wannaknow that too|`|ocnIU67caa	next time you see him try and hold eye contact, if you really can't then walk up to him and jus ttry and make small talk. For example, in the canteen "The food looks gross today.. what are you thinking of getting?"<br>  <br>  once you've spoken you can greet each other whenever you see each other and not just look away. For example you see him walking towards you in the hallway (not in a hurry) "Hey, aren't you the guy in the canteen? I'm (name) by the way"|`|OntO6wE4aa	You need to practice being more bold. First try staring at yourself in a mirror and give yourself compliments. It doesn't matter what you say, just do it till you don't feel silly or stupid or embarrassed. You may find what you say may be true. Next step up and say compliments to a friend. Don't go way out like you did with yourself. Make sure it's a good friend. Do that till you don't feel embarrassed. Next compliment a stranger, but use good judgment. Like saying something nice to an old person. As you may know shyness is an overly concern about what people think. You think more than the other person does. You find out if a guy likes you by communicating with him. People don't gain anything by not say anything. Don't wonder. Find out where you stand. I was shy, so when I liked someone I'd send notes. That can sometimes work for you and it can backfire. Documents of what you feel. Learn to go after what you want. Rejection won't kill you. Found love will make you grow feeling some what good. good luck|`|EyaqiWPwaa	if you make him a sandwich he will like you...everyone knows that if you make a man a sandwich he will love you for the rest of your life!!!|`|5aXKo6uCaa	<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Know-if-a-Guy-Likes-You" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Know-if-a-Guy-Lik...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4451775_likes-signs-out-guy-likes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4451775_likes-si...</a>|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	LOL that is just so cute.

Just get to know him. no pain will come from just saying hi. and if you do become his friend than maybe you'll find more reasons to like him and witht hat courage to tell him about how you feel. It's easier said then done though. I know that only too well.|`|jxBVAEpGaa	depends on the guy. here are some things:<br>  <br>  he goes to you for help<br>  <br>  he looks at you every once in a while<br>  <br>  he asks you out (kinda obvious)<br>  <br>  he talks about you to his friends<br>  <br>  he tries to impress you<br>  <br>  he tries to get your attention ( teasing/bugging)<br>  <br>  he gives you stuff<br>  <br>  he will do things for you that he wouldnt normally do<br>  <br>  etc|`|xJKJDyyMaa	dont stand around for him to make the first move because if yall both wait for the other to make a move then it doesnt work best thing is to start talking to him and see if hes interested its really a 50% chance so you cant go wrong just work up a little courage and you will be fine|`|OE8Yoam9aa	Try smiling at him, and when he looks at you smile before you turn away and if he likes you he is going to want to talk to you.|`|GhLEsDwwaa	well first you should get to kow him and be his friends. guys dont bite=] then once yall are friends mybe start hinting around that you like him??|`|kckLAUzhaa	just start talking to him...just think of him as a friend and act natural|`|jlXCnN7Uaa	become a lesbian and forget boys or get yourself busy with summin else love no true|`|fb1pXn7Paa	How can you tell if a guy likes you or is interested? You noticed him when you were standing and talking with a friend. You think he noticed you, but maybe it was your imagination or just wishful thinking. He looked at you at about the same time you saw him. Your eyes met for just a few seconds, and then you looked away. When you looked back up, he was talking with some other people. Was he watching you as you mingled? Or were you making that up? How can you tell if a guy likes you? Why are guys so hard to read?<br>  <br>  Here are five signs that he is interested in you too. If any of the following happens, he is probably trying to get close enough to ask you out:<br>  <br>  1. He tells someone<br>  <br>  Is he interested? He likes you if he tells a mutual friend that he wants to know more about you, or he asks other people who you are and where you're from. He is trying to act like he's "just asking" but his questions indicate more than a casual interest. And when he tells someone that he finds you attractive, he probably knows that it will get back to you. He's hoping it does.<br>  <br>  2. The look<br>  <br>  He gives you a look that betrays his calm exterior. Even though he is across the room, "that look" he has says it all. It is sweeping, from your head to your toes, and then his eyes linger on yours. You think you notice the beginning of a tentative smile.<br>  <br>  3. The conversation<br>  <br>  Does he like you? When he manages to get close enough to you, to ask you questions, he is interested. He appears to be listening and responds to what you say. He's moving in to the ultimate question, which is: "Are you seeing anyone." He would only ask this question if he wanted to date you, and he hopes the answer is "No." Never ever wear a ring in public. When a guy is across the room, he cannot tell which finger it is on and he may assume incorrectly that you are taken. If he doesn't ask you the question of whether or not you are attached, he may ask someone whom you both know.<br>  <br>  4. He appears unexpectedly<br>  <br>  He likes you a lot if he shows up out of nowhere. He can only do that if he has been asking people about your schedule, or he has been paying attention to where you are going and at what time. His face may turn red when he sees you. A sudden, "Oh, hi," is his way of saying, "I don't want to seem obvious, but I am interested in you." If you feel the same way, do not act shy. Stop and talk to him.<br>  <br>  5. EVERYONE likes you<br>  <br>  Is he interested? When you are well liked and a happy person, why wouldn't he like you? Of course he does. If you don't have a great life, however, now is your time to start working on one. Take a look at your career possibilities, body image, future, plans, and resources. You may be naturally talented at something, but it won't matter unless you work on your strengths. Misused or unused talents fade away. School and training do not.<br>  <br>  These are the five signs that he is interested and he is on the verge of asking you out. Make it easy for him and be friendly. This is where relationships begin.<br>  <br>  Do you want to know more secrets about how to attract men? Do you know how to dress, what to say, what to do, and the body language to use when you go out? Do you know the 5 steps to take to meet any guy anywhere?

GTeGDGzKaa	Just be straight up<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Considering your in the same group of friends that can awkward, but its best to just tell him the truth. Chances are he didn't feel the chemistry either.|`|zRvt68ZYaa	I was dating a woman who gave me this news face to face and I really appreciated it. However, you've only had one date, so a phone call should do. Via txt is a no no and will blow your friendship. Be honest and tell him you don't have the feelings you need to have in order to continue seeing him romantically. He'll understand.  Good luck!|`|vTx6BVQDaa	honesty is the best policy, just tell him how you feel.  Tell him you think he's a great guy but you don't feel anything for him romantically.  and tell him it doesn't change anything that you still wanna be friends|`|2636e57579f5ced8e339342c5fb42318aa	Yeah nancy..just tell him...call him if you have too.|`|5mTKspfYaa	you pretty much just did it.<br>  <br>  the BEST way is to meet him, if you can't then do it over the phone, NOT email...<br>  <br>  Just say you you know I had a great date the other night.  I do see commonalities between us, but I really didn't feel a relationship connection.  I absolutely do want to be friends with you that's why I wanted to tell you in person.  I think we could have a great plutonic relationship.  Do you feel like we could be just friends, if not I completely understand, but I really value you as a person and I like the thought of having you in my life
hHndD5SEaa	If I really really loved him then yes I would - and I would ensure that his last 5 years were the best of his life<br>  xx|`|AAivZMMOaa	love will cure them all...<br>  <br>  <br>  unless he got HIV...|`|UAfAtaVwaa	Yes. If you love him, you love him till death do you part. <br>  <br>  Sickness doesn't come in the way of true love, dear. But be careful that you're not going into the marriage because you feel obliged to, what with his condition. You've got to base the decision on how much you love him, and how ready you are to commit.|`|jlXCnN7Uaa	depends on who you are mate<br>  don't believe in marriage <br>  marriage is fake and filthy|`|SW17FGBoaa	If you love him, TIL DEATH DO YOU PART.
AfnOU04paa	Honey, you are blue because he took advantage of you and treated you like dirt.  Sadness is a self protective act.  Soon you will be angry, and that is a good thing.  Obviously, you are glad that he's out of your life.  I'd love to talk with you but I'm working a lot.  I suggest that if you can't find an ear, write it all down.  Everything in the most minute detail.  Just rant about what a dirt bag he is and how you didn't deserve to be treated that way.  Use a 100 pages if you need to.  Then reread it, and burn it, literally.   God Bless you.|`|509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	you can post the story here, people love to read all kind of dating stories, good or bad.<br>  <br>  you can add me and message through Yahoo-Answer.  I will be happy to read your story.|`|UAfAtaVwaa	Add me. I'm ready to listen, cos i'm going through something too. Bring it on. I'm here for you.<br>  <br>  bluefaerix_62@hotmail.com|`|qkKeBfsJaa	It really is the ultimate betrayal, so it is not surprising that you feel like that.<br>  <br>  This happened to me with a now ex. You feel so worthless, you gave this person your trust and they threw it back at you. All I can say is that time is the only thing that helps. It's probably a massive cliche, but it is not the end of the world and you will move on and be ok. <br>  <br>  The best piece of advice I got was someone said to me "You know it will never feel as bad as it does right now." I could have cared less at the time, but it was true....|`|GmTMVmASaa	i'm sorry you feel so blue, perhaps you need to move on sweety. so what if people are tired of hearing the same ole same ole, it still obviously hurt's so put your story on and i will read it, after i answer you then delete it. but, i am a woman of experience and you may not appreciate my response. i just think you need to lift yourself up and don't allow it to chase your joy. in other words, harden your heart.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	Ah!  I feel so sad for you!<br>  You must stop letting this man treat you this way.<br>  <br>  I allow e-mail if you need an ear.

WI1Mz9YTaa	you have nothing to loose and everything to gain!! just think how much you will regret it if you don't talk to him.<br>  <br>  he obviously likes you since you talked so much at the party so he already knows you, that should make it a little easier on you.<br>  <br>  but oh Gosh, I know it's hard! I know where you're coming from, I am super shy!<br>  <br>  mm... here are a few ideas:<br>  1. check if you have friends in common and let them make it as a setup. So they are having coffee, you happen to pass by and perfect, you just sit with them. After the conversation he'd give you his number, etc. done.<br>  2. see what classes he is taking or has taken and pretend to want to ask about the professor or whatnot since you're considering taking it<br>  3. check if he's going to any parties or whatever this weekend and try to make it. and this time ASK for his number! or else he won't know you're interested.<br>  <br>  Good luck! And remember, you have NOTHING to loose|`|dHDe64FUaa	say hi, whats up, how are you or something.|`|1zvRAAl0aa	I've had this problem before about being too nervous to ask this girl who I care for very much to the prom.<br>  Take Deep breathes and practice on how you would approach him in private or with a friend who you can trust.<br>  Find a moment when he is on his own and just go up to him and talk about the party, talk about what made you like the party and ask if there is another party coming up.|`|fb1pXn7Paa	Next time you meet him, ask him for his number, or msn addy.
XBSShH11aa	It's simple just cut your boy friend cook..........|`|8j7FCEOraa	You can get BC anywhere without your parents knowing. Seeing a doctor is confidential, he isn't legally allowed to tell your parents. Even child planning centers in your city might give out birth control.<br>  And if your really worried<br>  Take bc and use condoms. There is a very very very small chance that you can get pregnant using both of those precautions.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Tell him its best to wait until your married you have too much on your plate right now. That saves you from taking pills and also shows you if he really loves you or not.|`|1LxK1Grcaa	If you don't want to risk it then don't have sex.  You can give each other pleasure without having sex.  I would not advise birth controll myself, it messes with your system but if you go to the doctor or a health clinic they cannot release your info or chart to anyone without permission so it would be confidential.|`|4IVWMgp7aa	If you're in college, I'm assuming you're an adult/over 18.  You can get prescribed contraceptives from any doctor, and its totally confidential.  There are side effects, and some women choose to use condoms or other barrier devices.<br>  <br>  As an adult, you should be making decisions for yourself now, and not worring about your family as if you were still a child.|`|AA10358220	go to parent hood clinic birth control should be confidetail..and just think smart girl.. love & respect both parties peace and good luck...|`|AA11447210	Assuming you are at least 18 then your medical health is your business and nobody need know you are on b/c except you.<br>  <br>  You'd be foolish to have sex without it if you don't desire pregnancy. There are a number of options out there so go see your doctor and find out what is right for you.<br>  <br>  Only you can decide if you're going to live your life for you, or for someone else. Will you ever be happy trying to be the person others want you to, even if that's not what you really want?|`|AA12159712	If you are of college age, your parents shouldn't have to get involved at all. Your doctor who would prescribe them is obligated to you to keep it confidential. Even from parents since you are an adult now.  If you don't want to go that way, then advise your guy to use condoms. And to make it a bit more comfortable for you, at least use vaseline or K-Y jelly. Condoms come lubricated as well.|`|xKgZAp1Oaa	use a condom, and as for birth control, i think it depends on how old you are, but it doesnt hurt to try, go to a clinic and ask. I know a lot of people my age that use birth control without thier parents knowing. and i am also in college and dont plan on getting knocked up|`|7ocvtrZnaa	Correct me if I'm wrong here, but I'm not. If you're in college, you should be at least 18. That means you're an adult, you could maybe buy the birth control, I don't know, and screw what your family thinks.|`|yMZWqVQGaa	just use protection!!!!!|`|AA12392393	You need to listen to yourself.  You are not ready to do this again right yet.  I had those same feelings after my first time.  I waited for more than a year to do it again.  You will know when you are ready, and it may not be until you are married.  As for the birth control there are many places you can get it without your parents knowledge.  You didn't give your age?<br>  My advice is to listen to the little voice in your head and that will let you know when you are ready.  Tell the guy how you feel, but don't let him pressure you,  It will be great when the 2 of you are ready to go to the next step.  Also if he is not willing to wait then he is probably not the one for the long term.|`|hhFp7jZSaa	If you really want to have sex,for yourself,use condoms.If you want to take birth control pills go to a family planning clinic,they can give you birth control pills and wont tell your family,or go to your doctor.If something goes wrong with a condom,or you miss a pill,or anything happens where you might get pregnant,get the morning after pill.If you get sick,or have food poisening,or take anti-biotics or some herbal stuff(st johns wort) this can stop the pill from working.Maybe use condoms as well as a back up?Also remember you ovulate about 2 weeks after your period(if your periods are regular every month) so you could be extra careful around then.Good luck.|`|vTx6BVQDaa	I am getting married and I think it's best before marriage but we all make mistakes.  I had sex with my fiance before and now we havn't for 8 months and we're getting married in 2 months.  Trust me...you know what it feels like now and if you like it with him....and if he's your soulmate then he'll respect you and wait for you.  I hated the feeling of always wondering if I'd get "knocked up" even though we were engaged...lol  but yea...it's a scary feeling.  um...idk how old you are but I had implanon put in my arm.  they say it's more effective than birth control.  I know 3 girls that magically got prego on the pill. and my sister too....my neice is a result of the pill/antibiotics that counteract birth control and she didn't know that.  I'm 21 and I just lost my v-card to my fiance a year ago after we were engaged.  Think about it, and the consequences and just realize if you're going to "do the deed" get ready to sow the seed,
GmTMVmASaa	i don't understand the fears of dating, but hey, what do i know?<br>  during a conversation, say hey are you going to the prom? see what he say's and ask with who, and then say i'll go with you! goodluck.|`|5aXKo6uCaa	say hey want to go to prom with me?|`|gMjAxd4naa	Give him some food like a Burger or Candy Bar and after some friendly chatter, ask him who's he taking. If he says no one or says he's "thinking" about taking a girl, just cut him off and say "I'd like to go with you". Done and done.|`|AA11841749	You have to ask him.  He's probably just really shy, and maybe he's afraid to get turned down.  I'm sure he would be flattered if you asked him.  Also, try talking to him more in person or on the phone.|`|rrWkWHutaa	ask him.."hey whos the lucky girl ur taking to prom??" <br>  he probably will say.."oh no date yet."<br>  u say.."Oh that makes the both of us. wink wink"<br>  and he'll get the idea!<br>  <br>  <br>  ;)|`|KsPbIxq1aa	i think you should ask him to hang out outside of school see how it goes and then ask him then. (as long as it goes well) hope this helps. good luck!|`|Kk9f3MdRaa	you simply walk up to him and repeat after me:<br>  <br>  "Hey, you wanna go to prom with me?"
QK7ssy2Xaa	Aww that's so sweet. The guy I've been seeing lately has said that to me too. It just means that he thinks you're amazing and that he's happy with you. Maybe he thinks you're "the one" too.|`|5IO1JEY1aa	Are you serious?  You can't possible not understand the meaning of that.....Gosh!<br>  <br>  Its means he likes you!|`|RyYV3aXlaa	just talking/ he enjoys you its a good thing.|`|R0U4qy6haa	it means that he thinks you are really great-special-one of a kind-all nice things|`|Kk9f3MdRaa	unmmmmmm....i think he means he really likes you and was saying that he wished you had come into his life sooner..<br>  <br>  Do you have low self-esteem though? I mean if you are worried about something so dumb and simple as that....wow|`|uUHZlpMkaa	it seems that he really likes u|`|UI79JnJVaa	"We could have started doing this, <br>   back when I was too 'chicken' to<br>   ask you out."<br>  <br>  "Close enough?"|`|fBdtvrWdaa	I think he's saying like how could he have lived life with any sort of enjoyment without you.
O88ja9GZaa	Yes..first you need to get to know the person..<br>  Be practical..theres nothing like love at first site..thats only lust..not love<br>  Once you are friends...you get to know each other and its up to you to take it to the next level|`|MnjnkcNEaa	Not every relationship..just the relationship to find that perfect partner of your life or someone whom you can be enemies with(seriously I've experienced it)|`|UHIscXDUaa	hmmmm....maybe...yes....coz,every person who has crush on somebody always tries to approch the person in a friendly manner...|`|Pl9lY7qCaa	Not always & not necessary that a relationship starts with friendship.|`|wrHh16tcaa	no, sometimes as soon as you see someone you feel that connection with them. Most of the time, yes, it does come through friendship but not always.|`|fBdtvrWdaa	No. My current one did and I think it really helps our relationship but it's not always the case.|`|R4F05z4Faa	yes you are right
AA10604300	Lord Jesus open the eyes of this lady to see that <br>  she needs you, more than any other man or thing on this planet<br>  <br>  I tell you, that the pain and nightmares you experience are best handled by <br>  the Lord Jesus, who <br>  <br>  promises to heal and mend your broken heart.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ask, plead, pray to Jesus and ask him to forgive you of your sins, so that you can get on with your life.<br>  Jesus will give to you peace untold and <br>  eternal life in heaven,<br>  <br>  Just ask Jesus the Lord.....|`|ov9bpT3Taa	, Have you  surf the web to see if you can find other people with a similar question, sometimes the answer might already be out there. That's my suggestion
YVmAKb8Eaa	Probably because he thinks that you were acting lame, and didn't even find you attractive in That way.|`|RZl7aPxnaa	was he on a cell phone? you know at times they do lose connection. after says something about leaving him with you underwear and lost connection. he could have seen this as to say here you can have these to remember me by, and then hung up on him. I know you did not do this. but he may think you did. as to him he would feel as if you told him that he can have them and that is all he will have. it would be best to call him back and tell him he lost connection as you also did not mean for things to seem the way they did. I may be wrong but I think this is could be the only reason for him to act in such a way.|`|1428502c1a684763dee468a8340ff479aa	When he said something to remember you by, he probably meant sex.|`|4ltupRctaa	he must be gay!
AA10065812	No and Yes ??<br>  <br>  The base amount will not change, it simply means the custodial parent has less money to spend on the kids, which they may or may not have been doing anyway.<br>  <br>  You obligated portion of the cost of any extras, such as insurance, daycare, etc. may increase.  But, she will need a valid reason for why her income has decreased, just like you would.|`|onbwN4csaa	He can file for reduction of pay modification<br>  he can lower the child support that you get to reflect his lower income. he can file a no income modification and child support will stop if he looses his job..  when he gets a new job.<br>  then child support will resume under he's new<br>  pay level.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Yes, most states have a 'significant change of circumstance' clause within the child support guidelines. The party wishing to have the amount reviewd needs to file a 'Modification of Child Support' in the state that has juridiction over the original order.|`|6XKlW3lyaa	Well its always possible to get it changed, but it may not be fair.  You might have someone decide since you cant afford the children, they go to the other parent.|`|2add0927fd432feba092329128fecbcdaa	no it can only change if the non custodial parents income changes.<br>  <br>  If his income goes down so can your payments.<br>  If it goes up so can your payments.

QIqPwcH6aa	sounds totally sad an pitiful.|`|hHndD5SEaa	well I guess it depends on how long you've broken up for!! After a recent break up yeah Ive often wondered about what my ex is up to or who they're with - but after that I dont really give them a second thought!<br>  xx|`|eTO0ZIGvaa	When you are in a busy place with lots of things going on (especially fun things), you are just preoccupied with every thing's around you. But just let your mind be idle for a second and reality kicks in. So, if your reality is, you're not over a particular person yet, then you feel miserable all over again. I guess, we all wish it's not supposed to be like dat, but it is.|`|DooJ5iDGaa	spirituality is for committed people pfff<br>  lol , If its recent and you hold some type of grudge against your ex, or you haven't closed that gap ; of course its going to happened. Unless you are blacking out from how drunk you are you are least likely to even know your name, other wise with no closure/holding a grudge yes u will think of your ex. You might want to confront them from either prospective .|`|G2QNC22eaa	sounds like you still haven't got over ex and the drink brings back the times you were with her it's sad i no but its because you haven't got over her not being there <br>  <br>  <br>  PLEASE ANSWER MINE :) <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220074548AA3TA4k">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|BE5kLrgVaa	Avoid drink and be spiritual then everthing is ok
BYQ2kHPjaa	To be honest, you both want different things and she obviously doesn't want a relationship so the best thing for you to do is to forget about her and move on. And the fact that you have both only been messing around for the last few months tells you that she doesn't really care about you or wants to be in a relationship with you.|`|xWq93Ckyaa	tell her your sick of just messin around.<br>  if she doesn't listen to you, just let her go. she's not worth it anyways.<br>  GOODLUCK (=<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ap5WGI7XOuOWY9X8zWYM7GPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220073521AAqoVQr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
XJ0Nux6Naa	Thats really cute. If you do meet up with him again, you should get his phone number or email address :D Its perfectly normal, and you arent too young, youre getting to that age where you like boys. I dont think hes a flirt, but i dont think he truely loves you. like true love. he just really really really really likes you :D but thats awesome, if you see him again, you should totally exchange numbers.
elhcuN19aa	Because she is in love with him still.<br>  True love forgives....<br>  As God forgives us all of the time even when we do God wrong...<br>  It is complicated|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	What a messed up situation. I wouldn't tolerate disrespect like that. He'd be out on his azz if he cheated on me.|`|mCM363I9aa	If he really "loved her deeply" he would not hurt her this way.<br>  <br>  He knows that she knows, he is an a#$|`|uI4Dspi4aa	What?<br>  <br>  If a woman keeps a cheating husband around she is stupid.|`|ov9bpT3Taa	Hey you,  I honestly always lookup different sites online to see if I can find any forums or blogs with info as well. Good Luck with that|`|6XKlW3lyaa	I'm confused.  If the wife isnt mad, why are we even talking about it?
d8yrvK4waa	I think it will be okay except common interests<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|uBkvqcY6aa	Hayden is that you?|`|wV3Fs9Ebaa	age shouldnt matter<br>  the luv is wat really matters<br>  so follow ur heart|`|5IO1JEY1aa	Its not going to work out.<br>  <br>  Sorry!<br>  <br>  You to young for him.......Forget what you read about love has not boundaries or follow your heart.  <br>  <br>  BS!<br>  <br>  You need to experience what every 18 YO experiences.....He has already experienced it.  <br>  <br>  I think your wasting your time....I speak from experience!|`|aMGfRum0aa	I don't think so. He is almost twice your age, it might not work out so great in the end. It's probably a waste of time. Find someone who is closer to you in age.|`|4d52d758f45db34f29370d8ba6d5ec41aa	he is just using u for sex. move on girl|`|DWFMM23Caa	you haven't said if it is a relationship or not? you are an adult now, but the whole "he has experienced his twenties" thing might be an issue.|`|nOIpS2Ccaa	Dating,chat & affairs-<a href="http://masti4india.info/" rel="nofollow">http://masti4india.info/</a>|`|aR2hMZa7aa	I think there is far too much of an age gap.  Maybe wait a few years until you are at least in your twenties|`|KzDwZfLBaa	If you love each other then I think you should not end it.|`|tRNiXtplaa	follow your heart.
