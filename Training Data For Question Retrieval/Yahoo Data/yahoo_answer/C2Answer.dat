g8CsCKpGaa	Marine option ROTC students wear the green Marine PT gear.  Navy option wears the blue.  The working uniform will be the same for both options, khaki.    Marine option PT is usually more strenuous.  In my unit, everyone PT's together one day.  The other two days, the Marine options do their own thing.  Usually it is a long run (4-6 miles), or obstacle course, or combination of running, push-ups, curl-ups, etc..  It will depend on the Marine Captain in charge of your ROTC unit. The demands on the Marines will be a lot more than your average Navy demands.  Its just part of the job.

Sounds like greed.|`|Wn4d1DWiaa	Democrats do pay their taxes. I've never met a dem who doesnt.    The question for the tax-cutting republicans is this:  If you love your country so much, why are you less willing to pay for its up-keep and maintnence?|`|rUNlmQG5aa	Actually it is the wealthy who refuse and the IRS has increasingly refused to pursue them owing to their legal help, where with all. Its' much easier to pursue the middle income group because they are more likely to give in to persecution for a lack of sufficient legal resources. If you want to understand the corruption, follow the salaries. A Republican legacy.|`|ffJcrsmLaa	Do you have any statistics from a reliable source showing that republicans are more likely than democrats to pay their taxes? Didn't think so. The question is invalid, because the premise that democrats don't pay taxes is unsupported, and most likely untrue. I know many democrats who do pay their taxes, which is a counterexample to your claim that democrats do not pay their taxes.    Edit:  Of course somebody gave me "thumbs down"... Here's my question : why don't republicans ever cite any reliable sources, and just make things up and talk without thinking? Now I know that's not true of all republicans; I'm just showing how generalizations (like the one you made) usually aren't true.|`|i5Sxh2v5aa	Actually, dipshit, the amount you owe is penalized at 5% per month of non-payment. The amount you owe is penalized at a whopping 47.5% when you fail to file - 22.5% for late filing, 25% of the total for late payment. And don't forget interest, which is compounded daily until the tax is paid off.  So, unless you're implying that all democrats owe THIS much money, shut your damn mouth, and get your facts straight before you accuse people of something you OBVIOUSLY know nothing about. Go ahead and click the 'thumbs down', you know I'm right. :]|`|ofP7bbX7aa	Because we do.|`|4bb99c41576ff3f2f8e3b5fc75e5945baa	They don't want to spread their wealth.

Basically all america is doing right now is policing Iraq. That's the iraqi government's job not America There can't be victory because your not conquering it.     The HOUSE ( meaning not just him )just passed a huge 800 +  billion bail out package infrastructure. This is includes companies buying steel ONLY made in America. ( I know this because i live in Canada and some canadians were annoyed). They might include Canadian steel but right now just trying to keep jobs in the country not going else where.    Taxes: From his debates and election campaigns if you make over $250,000 you will see a tax increase? Now how many of us make that much. Companies like Exon Mobile , AIG , Walmart etc. make that kind of money so they will be taxed more but that's because they can afford it.     Thats just a jist of what he wants to do. I dont see why people our whining oh bail out plan. That's pretty much they only way your going to get out of this! and if the previous 8 years weren't so bad then we wouldn't be in this mess.    oh and going back to the Iraq war on Terrorism. The amount of money the US has spent on that war has been sooo much! It's enough money to pay for all the 3rd World Countries debt! and some more!

P2UHQQehaa	go with your instinct, take survey which identifies you as a liberal/conservative, talk to you parents, try to understand why they hate obama, try reading a book on political stands. maybe this will help you indentify with one party or the other. but never committ yourself to the party your parents belong to, just because of pressure! follow your gut.|`|u9ewvqJuaa	I have seen many, many people torn between what their parents believe , what they believe, what they THINK they believe, and what society tells them.    I am going to assume that your parents are Republicans - so are mine. My boyfriend and his entire family are Democrats. During the election I was extremely torn between the two candidates. On one side I had my parents talking about Obama's flaws while on the other side I had my boyfriend talking about Obama's strengths. What each side was saying simply didn't match up.  So I did my research to find out for myself which candidate was better, and which I agreed with more.  That would be my suggestion to you - do your research. Find out what Republicans stand for, and what Democrats stand for, then find out what Obama stands for. Once you have the facts, you can make an informed decision.    Also, I will be the first to tell you that your parents, while older and possessing more life experience, may not be right. OR, they may not hold the opinions that are right for YOU, it is very common to be on VERY different ground from your parents. Don't get caught up in thinking that just because they are your parents, they are automatically right. However, don't completely disregard their opinions either.    Politics are very complicated, and both parties have the extremists that will bad-mouth the other side. Keep in mind that neither is the better party - they are simply different. One may work in a certain climate while another won't, and vice versa. Large government or small government, it just needs to work - and what works in one era may not work in another. The two parties are like yin and yang - they balance each other, so don't feel that one is superior to the other. The same as cliques or stereotypes, the parties are labeled by who TENDS to flock to which party, however each individual party member doesn't necessarily follow the party's beliefs perfectly.    In the end, you have to look at the facts and decide for YOURSELF what governing style you agree with most - democratic, republican, independent, green, etc. THIS IS KEY: When deciding whether you like Obama or not, look at what he STANDS for, not what party he belongs to.  I hope this was helpful. Political orientation is a tough thing to figure out, especially when it seems like you'll be going against your family! Good luck!|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Hate is a strong word. Why don't you do a political survey and see where your ideas match up? Individualism is a good trait. Just because your parents teach and agree with hate doesn't mean that you have to be them or think like they do. It's called being an adult and thinking for yourself. http://www.politicalcompass.org/test|`|Zp93fab3aa	You shoudl do your research on you feel on how he stands on issues, of war, eocnomy, abortion, job creation etc. and see if your views are similar.

I'm sure whatever reasons they have for hating him are completely irrational, most are.  And, there's nothing wrong at all with being a Democrat.

Oh yeah, your parents are right.|`|ybLErb9caa	So what? You should form your own political opinions. No,it doesn't make you a racist if you don't like Obama.

Then ask yourself if those issues are important to you and if you feel the same way.  Remember that the best way to make a decision is sometimes to just ask yourself, "What is the right thing to do?".  The right thing to do is that which is best for others, not necessarily for you.

But despite this latest dire warning from Chippy....errrr, Cheney about some more upcoming gloom and doom, which also seems to go hand in hand with a certain V.P. saying how Obama would be tested within a certain time frame, I think we all have been a little wavering. Torn between living on the fault line as in ready for the doom and gloom to come true, to being very complacent... and not worrying at all.....well, maybe a wee bit.     Mighty interesting that these claims keep popping up yet no one will go any further into what they have heard.....except to put out doom and gloom tidbits...to attempt to scare Americans into that Halliburton frame of mind....    Yes, we are worn.....and I suggest.....take the fighting and lies out of Congress.......stop paying your elected representatives for speeches.  Why can't elected officials work on a performance based scale. Can't pass a budget? No pay.  Can't Balance a Budget? No Pay..  Can't show up for work? No Pay...  Can't account for your per diem? No pay.  Can't work in a compromising style with the folks from the other side of the aisle? No pay.  Can't put the interest of the country before your lobbyists? No pay.  Can't let go of holding and spewing the party line andholding poor, starving Americans hostage? No pay---and maybe move to Iran.|`|5Ho518J9aa	Not quite there yet.

Just makes sense to me.|`|cMHxg372aa	What is this? Don't believe anything the government tells you without verifying the facts. If they aren't willing to disclose the facts, then they could just as easily be making the "threat" up, and their claims are without merit.    Interestingly enough, this actually did happen when the righties attacked Clinton for launching Tomahawks against Bin Laden's training camps in Afghanistan. They accused him of trying to "wag the dog" - though the reality was that the threat was very real, yet the military actions took time in the news cycle that otherwise could have been used to run the absurd spectacle of one set of serial philanderers (Gingrich, Craig, et. al.) accusing another man of immorality.|`|r2JPcUN8aa	We had eight years of the boy who cried wolf.|`|ujIinLzGaa	Quite possibly.

And quite vague... it depends on what kind of warning they issued. Normally they are so general and worthless that there is no way we can possibly react... I'd hope people would be smart enough to evacuate New York if the government told them Al-Qaeda was gonna detonate a nuke in 2 hours or something though... but I see your point, certainly.

It was the use of fear tactics and half truths that got us where we are now.  I think if we were able as a group of educated voters to force term limits on both houses and eliminate lobbyist, we could get the upper hand.    Until we as voters demand honesty and integrity from our elected officials, and hold them accountable, we will get the government we deserve.    One way to do that is to start now, tonight.  If you don't like what is happening in congress, email your Representatives and Senators and let them know you don't like it and want to work out something better. Give them an idea of what you want, and not what the special interests or lobbyists want.  If you don't speak up for yourself, why should others do it for you. If enough people Speak with one voice, you will be heard.

3DOQG6hEaa	Yup... by far.... only woman to ever even finish second in the primary of the two major parties.. won't be surprised to see her in 2016    *Edit* not 2012 certainly, as she is a member of Obama's cabinet. The only time that a different prominent politician from the President's party runs in the primary is because the President is incredibly unpopular. In this case, though, if Obama were really so unpopular at the end of 4 years, she would be, also, as she will be associated with him.    "Godwill" since Ferrero ran as the VP candidate, and wasn't even elected, I'd argue that she was further from the Presidency than Clinton. Had Clinton won the primary, she almost certainly would have won the general election. The public was just tired of Republicans, and McCain didn't have a great base support|`|UkKGsHU3aa	technically yeah|`|EPObVPzVaa	Doesn't matter.

63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	I believe it should be, but the forces against it are too strong.  There are too many powerful people who oppose any legalization.  The fact that it the only relief from pain for some people yet is still not permitted as a medicine in much of the US shows that it is unlikely to be legalized any time soon.    Imagine if all the drugs Americans take every year were free and available to all just by growing them in the yard like tomatoes.|`|ofP7bbX7aa	Yesterday it was 4 years. To much prejudices against it for the older folks. You will need to wait for a the next generation to do it.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	Only if it will benefit the Democrats|`|9AY68T6Eaa	I think what you mean, actually, is "de-criminalized", which would mean no longer illegal. "Legalized" would mean it would be regulated by the federal govt, which i would not support.    It's a states rights issue, and may very well come to a head sooner or later. but any product like weed that supports the prison industry and the black market so much will be hard to mess with.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	Nope!

6nS62bB8aa	Class warfare. That is why we don't have a flat tax.    The idea of a flat tax has a long history in America, just search the term "flat tax" and see how many hits you get.    And, back in the 90's, Steve Forbes ran for President, the flat tax was one of his major themes. Before his campaign, Mr. Forbes wrote out his proposal and it won almost ninty percent approval in the Senate.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	How did they make that money? by working little children in Nik+ factiries over seas. Please save you pity for those who can't afford basic needs.|`|1nt5jpZraa	Don't you get it. We are suppose to swallow political correctness but not question class warfare. We want everyone treated equal, unless you're rich. Exemptions: politicians. They define rich as 125K while they forget to pay taxes on millions!|`|fd3474ea06ab0211e7639d147ef1b384aa	Because people who know how to make money can afford to pay more money, or so does the government think. Flat tax rate is more fair assuming tax loopholes can be closed and offshore bank account could be taxed.|`|ofP7bbX7aa	Next time put your untaxed money in a bank in Luxembourg. They won't let anyone else see the accounts, or give out information to a government.
WyCmQBuvaa	This is what I would do.    I'd take dragon lady to lunch.  Explain to  her your situation and your schedule.  Your school is very important to you but so is your job.  Is there any that you guys can work something out.  I wouldn't pry, but tell her that you are confused why she won't change days with you.  You have always been able to work things out in the past.  I'd tell her that it is only temporary for this semester (if that is true) and once this is over, you can go back to the old schedule.  She might have a reason for taking Mon & Wed off.  Maybe something she doesn't want to discuss with everyone or make public knowledge.    It is worth a try.  What do you have to lose?      I worked with someone that just hated working Mondays. They refused to work Mondays.   It was always a mad house.  You had to get caught up from the week-end.  All the calls, the mail, etc.   It was very stressful.    Since you already talked to your boss and he is not stepping in here, I don't see what other option you have if you can't convince dragon lady to switch.  You really need to get on her good side here.    Hope this helps.|`|kwYxQp0Maa	Well you certainly don't have any legal basis to do anything.  You can talk to your boss, but the bottom line is you were hired for certain days, unless your boss hired you with the knowledge and understanding that your schedule would change, you really don't have much of a complaint.    The issues about you co-worker should have been addresses as separate issues as they have nothing to do with your need to change work days.  Also just because she hasn't given you a reason doesn't mean she doesn't have a reason to not switch.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	I always thought swapping was an option, and I see no reason she is obligated to do this. She has been there longer than you have, which counts for a lot. It has nothing to do with the patients liking her or not.   If you seriously would put someone's job in jeopardy over your expectations, personally, if I were the boss, I'd let you go.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	How about explaining the situation to the office manager, who has the authority to revise the schedule or "persuade" the other receptionist to agree do so and has some tools at his/her disposal to make it happen (raise, days off, etc.)|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Why does one of you have to leave the job?  Holy crap. Is this the best you can do at problem solving?    She doesn't owe you any explanations.  Her age, likeability and work ethic have nothing to do with anything.  You have the right to ask her to switch and she has the right to say no.      Your option is to explain to her the impact of not being able to switch days, and then OFFER her something in return for doing you a favor.      If she won't budge, you will have to decide if you quit early, or perhaps talk to your boss about your scheduling difficulty.   You had to have known that you had classes starting in three weeks, and yet you waited until now to do try to change your schedule?|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Talk to your boss that you need your schedule switched.  Tell him or her that you may be forced to resign if you can't get the schedule.  Let your boss try to figure out how to make it work.  If he or she can't, I guess you'll have to resign.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	just quit and be done with it! You don't need the money!|`|A6YaJzecaa	The only option I see is to ask your boss and go from there. The problem with that is, if your boss makes your co-worker switch days in which she's always worked, then she may take her resentment out on you and do things to try to get you fired. She does have more seniority than you, you may want to take that into consideration, as well.
4bb99c41576ff3f2f8e3b5fc75e5945baa	It just shows Obama is just a figure head. He wont buck Nancy Pelosy or Harry Reid. Other wise he would do whats right for America. I don't think we will ever elect a president that will do what is right for us.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	He has proven he really doesn't know the meaning of the word bi-partisan. He probably thought it meant Democrats sitting with Republicans at the annual bi-partisan picnic. (There IS such a thing as that in case some of you didn't know lol!)|`|yAsLhdp2aa	he is a totalitarian type of president.  just like the last one.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	Obama didn't ignore the Republicans.  He made changes to the plan.  The House GOP members still played politics rather than dealing straight.    I suggest you do some research on the history of this bill...not just listen to partisan claims.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	He asked them what it would take to make them pass the bill.    He gave them what they wanted and took some stuff out of the original bill.    They still won't vote for it.    As far as I'm concerned, he's done enough and doesn't need to pander to them any longer.  It's not like he needs their vote.|`|6kCws524aa	Dumbocrats are just repaying their Wall Street pals. Remember when Reid and crazy Nancy claimed of it wasn't passed in 25 seconds the country would collapse. Then they gave it all away to their banker buddies. Obammma.|`|LVZdzPmpaa	His plan is to expand the Dependency Class and move towards a Socialist government. The "stimulus" plan is just that. It simply won't work and to top it off, more the HALF of it is NOT for stimulus, but rather to get the dependency off to a rolicking start. It's ridiculous. Further, there's tons of pork attached to the bill, including some $340+ million for the prevention of STDs (?) and more than $60 for new fed government cars. The figure was plucked from the air.    In addition, you simply do NOT stimulate the economy in the fashion he proposes. All his plan will result in is instant inflation and a long term payback (increased taxes).    It's not about "differences." Obama needs to get some of the GOP on his side so that when it fails, the blame can be spread around. He doesn't need a single GOP vote to pass his doomed plan. So think about that. What does he care what the GOP has to say?|`|AA11947951	republicans suck big time big babies|`|iLTlJszaaa	I agree completely.  Barack Hussein Obama is being a liberal hypocrite.|`|MczmTftTaa	everyone isn't going to have exactly what they belive should be the law, actually become the law. it will be a median of all ideas, the whole meaning behind a democracy.|`|rWdYBmPmaa	I am not a supporter but can tell you why they want Republicans on this.    This way when it does nothing they can blame the Republicans. I say screw them. If they like it so much pass it without the Republicans after all they do not need us. And how was it put, OH that's right "WE WON"      So go ahead, what are you afraid of.|`|cRDbeUDvaa	I'm an Obama supporter, and I can't give you an answer.  His version of bipartisan seems to be that he smiles when he says that he won.  So far, I am not impressed.|`|rUNlmQG5aa	The ease with which nearly a trillion dollars was swiftly dispatched prior to Obama's inauguration for the financial melt down with few questions asked - and 19 billion of which has already gone for corporate bonus's while 13.5 billion were the bone of contention in saving millions of US worker jobs in the automotive sector leads me to believe, somehow, I don't know why, that the Republicans would seem to be seeking to line their most fervent supporters pockets prior to anything involving a common persons well being. Fair point, or not?|`|WP5dSiCmaa	It just floors me that people still think there's going to be some change in the way politics are run on Capitol Hill. I VOTED for Obama, knowing full well he was going to take care of the people that got him elected. Hell, ACORN and its offshoots are getting nearly a billion dollars in this plan. Seriously, if you think there'll be 'change'...well...I truly feel sorry for you.|`|84871326f6678fb2f9c40486796e4ebbaa	I dunno...It seems that the GOP got a lot of stuff into the original bill, but then they failed to vote for it.  Besides, all they want is tax cuts for folks that already had massive tax cuts and since then everything went to hell.  We've had cuts...guess what?  Big corporations invested their cuts in OVERSEAS production, not US production.  They also used their 'cuts' to buy up other corporations to increase market share and lay off US workers.  Guess what else?  The hired FOREIGN workers at lower wages to replace the AMERICAN workers that they fired.  Something isn't kosher with this entire business.  Tax cuts that will help the wage-earner directly may be one thing, but this fable about 'trickle down' economics is just that...a fable and a rip off.  Obama's idea of putting as much money at the bottom and allowing it to trickle up is simply better bet than some outworn and proven worthless idea as the current GOP seems wedded to.  As far as 'unnessary' spending is concerned, who knows what that means?  Basically 'unnecessary' spending is what the 'other guy' doesn't want...there's no real objective definition for the term.  Let's be real.  We tried it the GOP way, now we have to go with plan 'B'.....Barack's plan!  No kiddin'!|`|HQMb14hUaa	obama 2008!|`|SxAOmZJnaa	Because he is a politician they lie for a living never trust them.|`|dUWqW27paa	Let me get that one for you.............no.    OH BTW I love the pork set aside for honey bee insurance......rrrrright.|`|zR0Dcdevaa	Because it's not illegal for him to disagree with another individual.  You know it's not only republicans who are shooting down the stimulus plan.    Just because he's not doing every single thing that every other person says, it doesn't mean he's not listening to them.|`|ItleV9qeaa	he wants everyone to be together and let down there guard so he do what hes really planing to do with america (im not joking)|`|ohxiNOFjaa	President Obama has made many concessions.  Republicans simply can not be satisfied.|`|nM2k6geEaa	I don't know where you are coming from,  Obama meet with all of the leaders at the White House and a special dinner party with the republican their ideas were put into the stimulus package that went to the Senate.|`|IhhDwGBmaa	why would you listen to people who want to bail out gas guzzling car giants?.. nah.. how about writing me a 7 thousand dollar check instead.|`|HL1t2OhDaa	**** obama. **** obama. **** obama     Hes ruining our country more with what hes doing. he wants to spend more money to get jobs but what he has to realize is if he does less spending and actually build up the economy the fired people will get rehired cause there companies doing good again! I can prove every point about Obama wrong. He brainwashed everyone with change because they are desperate for change.|`|AA12325475	Because he's the president and therefore he gets the final say. He's not ignoring what the GOPs have to say; he's taking it into acount in making his DECISION. And what is wrong with calling for both sides to stop their petty bickering? Count yourself as fortunate that you finally have a grown up in charge of your country.|`|F33GQCuFaa	Because he is the saviour we have all been waiting for.  Everything he does has to be right, and everything he touches turns to gold.  Do not ever question anything that he does!!  How could you

Democrats are the rich elite, their friends are billionaires who own nearly all of the media and entertainment industries. They like to say republicans are the rich elite, but if republicans don't pay taxes they are screwed, Democrats don't have to pay unless they are under close investigation, which doesn't happen much as the news media isn't going to do it.|`|Z7a9BiCeaa	Demorats are all for them and none for us!|`|dUWqW27paa	What a Democrat who isn't on welfare who still doesn't pay taxes.

They're liberals, they don't make sense.|`|YqcU7O0Faa	To answer your question;    Democrats are elitists and feel they do not have to live by the same rules they impose on others....They feel they are above the common man.|`|AA11963685	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-hogar...

Both of them have admitted their mistakes and paid what they owed plus penalties.  What else is there to say?  Either they'll be confirmed or they won't.  But some Republicans commit crimes while in office. Just like some people forget to pay some of their taxes.  It happens.  So, given the history of things, I'm willing to trust that these two exceptions to the otherwise squeaky clean cabinet will be ok.|`|8ed1c4b4b5ab2e0f6329de8048b39995aa	And you are using, as an example, 2?

Obama's got a lot of great ideas for this country.  But before he can work on most of them he's got to clean up Bush's shytpile.  That will surely take up most of his first term.  Just because Bush has left doesn't mean he took the problems he has created with him.|`|1TJ5v6Xzaa	What is really interesting is the fact that the democrats have been the majority in congress and senate for the last two years.

From now until the 2010 mid-terms, the Dems will have a free hand at getting whatever socialist agenda that they can dream up.    But in 2010, the voters will see what kind of scam the Dems have been running, and vote Conservative to stop the social spending.    It's all about the hate now. The Dems just want America to keep hating President Bush so that America won't pay attention to the facts.|`|zzO6Qalsaa	It`s because they want us to feel some guilt I suppose.They have nothing to offer now and most their nominees are being shown to be hypocrites i. e. unpaid taxes, illegal immigration help, lobbyist.Only thing they say is we won and tack on more pork in bailouts than a memphis barbeque.They believe by hitting America with Bush over and over we wont notice their big government policies that have never worked before and will not work now.|`|9HvHmwTNaa	snort, snort, ...oink, oink,....don't mind me, I'm lost ...can you give me directions to the stimulus package?.....my name is suuuuuuuuuuie, I am a modern porker......I bring home the bacon...fry it up in a pan and .......oh that was my sister,  anyways if you would please inform Mr. Obama that I am on my way.....|`|hMLmrPbgaa	Bush may be gone but many of the people that cheered him on as he drove this country into the ground are sadly still with us.|`|NqNbIp2caa	Learning from the screwups of the Bush administration is not bitching about it.

9d087LM8aa	not having the phone would have been the best thing here but if there is a school law that states a teacher can't trespass into the phone then I would first get a hold of that law in writing in the form of public school rules & regulations, then seek out legal help like an atty that will work the case pro bono (free). A good place to start is with your parents for help & guidance. That phone being present will come into play though & maybe 2 wrongs wipe the slate clean and all start over again fresh.|`|EPqnB7Epaa	They may not be aloud to do this, but then again, they may be allowed to do it.|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	Abuse of civil liberties I believe.|`|UkKGsHU3aa	Uh forget about your school rules, that is against the law.

Some schools have a search-and-seizure waiver meaning they can search your bag, your locker or your belongings.  Often they sneak it into school rules that are sent home to parents and guardians to be signed.  If you signed it, yes, they can search your phone.  However, if the rule is that only the office can search the phone, tell the office.  Likely the substitute will have some explaining to do.|`|89qgMZjiaa	Unfortunately, regardless of whether it is against the rules or not there's very little you can do.  If you lodge a formal complaint with the principal, then the most he can do is take that particular sub off the list of available substitute teachers.  Since she(?) was a sub, there's not even the satisfaction of getting her(?) fired.  There's no way you can "take back" the experience.  Best advice is to follow the rules in the first place and not have it in the classroom.  When (if) you get to college, you'll lose grade points for having a phone in class.|`|T1OqmFHsaa	OH NO!!!  that would have never happened to me! i can be a very bitchy person so i would have given her the biggest attitude and refused to give her anything. you should definitely tell someone of higher authority because i think its illegal to go through someones things without their permission unless its to find drugs, but this certaintly wasn't the case. she shouldn't have had it out, but she had no right to put her on blast like that. i encourage you to tell someone. Please do so...i would love to hear the outcome of this problem. :)

You did the right thing by bringing up the price discrepancy to your manager.  As an employee who knew something was ringing up wrong and then buying it at that price yourself, you were being dishonest.  I have seen this exact situation many times.  Had you bought it and not known that it was ringing up wrong absolves you of any wrongdoing.  The mere fact that you knew of the discrepancy and took advantage was wrong.  They could have legally fired you and even pressed charges.  All you can do is to tell your supervisor of the problem and let them handle it.  If it is still ringing up wrong, sell it at that price.  Make the customer happy.  Once they know about it and do nothing, it isnt your problem.    I have seen employees fired over 50 cents.  It isnt about the money, it is about integrity.  Do the right thing.  I do have some experience with AAFES and I know that it is not the best place to work.  But not as loss prevention.  They can be a pretty ruthless organization.

He should decline the position and if he refuses, the other executors designate should request a court order disqualifying him.

NO, he was not convicted and removed from office!    For those of you - and judging by the answers so far, there are a LOT of you - who are ignorant of the impeachment process, it goes like this:    Whenever a sitting President is accused of having committed a crime, the House initiates the impeachment process by hearing testimony and viewing evidence.  This is the same thing as a Grand Jury in the civilian world.  If there is sufficient evidence to charge the President, then the House votes to impeach.  And the President is then impeached, which means charged with the offense.    The next step is the trial, which takes place in the Senate.  At the end of the trial the Senate members vote, and if a majority votes to convict the President is then removed from office.    Only two Presidents have been impeached; Andrew Johnson in 1868 and William Jefferson Clinton in 1998.  Neither was convicted and therefore remained in office.  Nixon resigned before impeachment hearings began, but they were on the way.  He just beat them to it.|`|AA10206116	Yes he was, for perjury, but he wasn't removed from office.|`|e4J0OfjDaa	Yes, he was impeached, but wasn't removed from office.|`|xoK87yuGaa	No    With all the hate thrown at Clinton, are you blind of what Bush has done, or it doesn't matter because "Party first, country second".|`|OlCr3iNFaa	I don't think so really.

a243bdff28f8938b1553bc0befe479d8aa	Each state decides their voting method and from that method is how votes are counted, for example a state that votes using the bubble scanner and computerized voting booths count by machine.

If enough people do that, our local mayors and governors offices will over time be full of people who actually care about doing a good job.

Considering that this group is dwindling in power in their own party I think that the evolution of the Republican Party will eventually reject her... her chances of clinching the 2012 nomination is getting slimmer on a daily basis.    Is she talented?  No question that she is but she is not moderate and with new strong demographics showing that the youth and a new generation of immigrants are willing to participate I don't see her reaching out to those people... Even if she reaches out to them I think that voting block will reject her.    Palin will always have a seat at the dinner party for the Republicans but she is only fully embraced by the base of that party.  She has to win the fringes of the party... McCain was rejected by the base but he clinched the nomination by the fringes of the party.  His nomination was actually the showing of a weakened social conservative movement within the GOP.    Of course, anything can happen but I seriously doubt that the social conservatives will ever be as powerful as they were in the first term of Bush.|`|mp6F8a6Oaa	Yes, Palin is Essential to our border security, especially when it comes to Russia.

VUgCSQ6Daa	1969 under Nixon.....and no Clinton's false surplus was just that. Verifying this is as simple as accessing the U.S. Treasury (see note about this link below) website where the national debt is updated daily and a history of the debt since January 1993 can be obtained. Considering the government's fiscal year ends on the last day of September each year, and considering Clinton's budget proposal in 1993 took effect in October 1993 and concluded September 1994 (FY1994), here's the national debt at the end of each year of Clinton Budgets:      Fiscal  Year Year  Ending National Debt Deficit   FY1993  09/30/1993  $4.411488 trillion     FY1994  09/30/1994  $4.692749 trillion  $281.26 billion   FY1995  09/29/1995  $4.973982 trillion  $281.23 billion   FY1996  09/30/1996  $5.224810 trillion  $250.83 billion   FY1997  09/30/1997  $5.413146 trillion  $188.34 billion   FY1998  09/30/1998  $5.526193 trillion  $113.05 billion   FY1999  09/30/1999  $5.656270 trillion  $130.08 billion   FY2000  09/29/2000  $5.674178 trillion  $17.91 billion   FY2001  09/28/2001  $5.807463 trillion  $133.29 billion|`|stEUrlwjaa	When we had Bill Clinton in the White House.|`|EbsekS7yaa	When Clinton borrowed from social security to make it appear as such... or did you mean an ACTUAL budget surplus?|`|399be115381734eda49e566fc563731aaa	I think it was under George Washington.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Bill Clinton had a budget surplus during his last years as president.

Clinton is the right answer, depending on how you define a surplus.  If you do it like the government does, Clinton is the right answer.  I define it as (spending - revenue), just as most accountants do, and using that simple formula, it is easy to verify that Clinton never generated a budget surplus.|`|X6gNuSS6aa	Not that long... 8 years ago before Bush took the Oval office, during Bill Clinton period, to be exact!!!|`|PjW3Yo2saa	it was awhile ago...  jackson comes to mind|`|UqWIh5tAaa	2001.|`|5JVik1E3aa	When Bill Clinton Was In Office.

It's not like America produces much anymore.    The stimulus package should contain about a trillion dollars to rebuild the American manufacturing base - factories and infrastructure.  As new factories are coming on line, only then should we institute protectionist policies.    Protectionism did not work in the past because we were a net exporter back then.  when most imports and exports were cut off back then, america was on the losing end of the deal.  Today they will work because we are a huge net importer.  Cutting off all imports and exports today would be huge gain for America.  We would go from a net loss of 40 billion dollars per month up to zero loss.    But to do that, we need to be able to produce those things which we currently import.    We currently don't have that capacity.  Thus, we need to rebuild our Mfg. capacity before we implement protectionist policies.    Simple enough, no?|`|bmCInR5qaa	I work in America manufacturing and I DO buy American.    Sometimes I even pay more for it and am usually glad I did because the quality is 10 times better.

Ironic that the religion of peace shouts "Allah Akbar, and Fatwah" (which is basically a death threat) when the whole event was about peace! lolz It's amazing how arrogant people can be!          http://www.cafepress.com/foolishwear|`|drmaGe83aa	The way I understand this is that by instituting a buy american policy, the cost for supplies can be increased by american companies. This can happen because the competition won't exist between american suppliers and foreign suppliers. The increase in material costs will result in an increase in project cost.  I don't think they are against buying american. I believe they are against higher project costs.|`|9dEotvVwaa	I don't believe in spending my money on something just because it comes from a certain place.  I look for the best value money can buy and then I buy it.  If that item is made in the USA then great, but if is not then tough luck.    Years ago I worked in a shop where I worked on cars.  American made cars came in by the truck load with trim falling off, leaking windshields, doors that wouldn't shut, electric windows that wouldn't work, rusted out bodies (in the south), and the list goes on and on.    We rarely worked on foreign cars.  I myself bought my first Toyota about 27 years ago and drove it to about 200K miles, then I traded in on another, and put 200K miles on it also, I now have a 2003 that has never been to the shop for ANYTHING.  I also have a 2006, never had a problem.  My mother-in-law bought a brand new 2008 Buick Lucern(sp).  Two months later the door handle fell off the car.  The front wheel bearing went bad, and I constantly hear new noises.    So you ask me why buy American, and I say, at least for the Auto industry, I DON'T because the only thing the American Auto Industry is interested in is making as much money as possible for their "Union Brothers", translated, their Socialist Workforce.|`|AA10565336	1.  What can you buy that is American?  2.  How many hundred times more expensive is it?  3.  Why should I suffer?  This country and its leaders could care less what any working man thinks.  If you aren't on welfare there is absolutely no reason to court you.  HeII even military hardware is built overseas.  How is that going to work when maintenance and spare parts are needed?    And BTW:  Stimulus spimulus, SOCIAL ENGINEERING.  Like you I am not a Republican, they are far to Marxist for my taste.
kDtxqHlWaa	ever since the civil rights legislation everyone been afriad to upset the miniorty races  mainly black race.  right or wrong civil rights has been used against anyone that they feel should be, and not when it should so civil rights has been worn out before it time, we can not even say a guy does not do his job when he not on the job, because we are afraid he sue   so this shapes lots of everything on it all

None of these in the context that you wish for them to be seen in.  Obama is not going to turn the nation into a socialist or communist state.  And to think that shows that you don't know much at all.    By the way - the United States government has basis in socialism already (hate the break the news to you).  It was based on egalitarian socialism, which believes that all men are equal (". . .that all men are created equal. . .") in the eyes of the nation and government.  There is more, but this serves to prove my point just fine.    What am I saying?  You want to blame someone for putting socialism into our nation, you have to look no further than those that composed the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.  I really don't think Obama was alive back then.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	10|`|QsQj8jO7aa	None. These are all terrible ideas. 10 is too.

Is 19% high? Yes.  Did unemployment decrease under FDR? Yes.  Saying FDR caused high unemployment is like saying Truman caused the US to enter WWII, Reagan was responsible for the Carter recession, or Obama is responsible for the current crisis.  They inherited what their predecessors gave them and in the first 3 cases made it better, we have yet to see what effect Obama will have.|`|ujIinLzGaa	Another attempt to bring socialism to this country.|`|OnWmqs4paa	Old Crap...|`|MUcINsQ3aa	The raw deal
ABmZYbDZaa	6-8 weeks AFTER you start BCT is when you will get your first pay.     So if you start on the 10th of Feb do NOT expect to be paid on the 15th of Feb because it is NOT going to happen. The SOONEST you will see any pay will be the 15th of March and even that will be pushing it. It will more likely be the 1st of April before you see any pay at all. You will receive back pay to cover from the 10th of Feb til the time that you actually start receiving pay into your account.|`|Cp502oJNaa	i was told on the first and fiftenth of the mounth but your first check should be late|`|8b53e713d584ea5dc9761aeed373f037aa	you should receive a eagle cash card ie a prepaid debit card with a portion of your first pay advanced to you on it so that you purchase the necessities after that you will be afforded the opportunity to open a bank account so that you can receive the rest of your pay|`|v6l3o2kvaa	Pay is on the 1st and 15th unless falling on weekend or holiday.

They are running up a huge credit debt for our future generations, for them to be nailed for taxes for decades to come, to satisfy their own greed.  The economic woes, deftly and unfairly blamed on the Republican Party, was caused by their greed, first and foremost for power, by buying the votes of lower income families through home ownership, then blaming their home foreclosures on the Republicans, although McCain DID try to fix the problem.   Bills, even for lower income families, must be paid. It was an obvious financial time bomb, blatantly for political gain.  Now the Democrat politicians are, one after another, being caught for tax evasion. Are they all doing it?  Obviously.  If Republicans were doing it, those politicians would have been found out long ago, through the scrutiny of an extremely biased media.  Again, the Dem. message is "Everything that the Bush Presidency did was bad, but don't look at us too closely, because we are doing it too, .....but also screwing up foreign policy and international trade, while letting out the terrorists of Gitmo Bay."|`|A2qbzxrfaa	The 534 people that run this country have special provisions that they wrote for themselves that make their taxes next to nothing. So YES all they have to do is write a law for themselves and pass it.
EbsekS7yaa	Love the sinner, hate the sin.  BTW- being a Christian does not mean to act like Christ, it means to follow Christ.|`|8b53e713d584ea5dc9761aeed373f037aa	It is not that we want to go to war or that we want to kill some one. It is simply that we feel an obligation to serve our country and to protect the rights of our countrymen, you know like the one you are exercising in asking this question. Our primary objective is not to kill but to bring peace and sometimes violence is necessary to facilitate peace. In response to your Jesus never went up to a bunch of Islams, if you knew your history you would know Islam wasn't even a religion a the time of Christ for Mohamed said that Christ was a good prophet and since Mohamed founded Islam he would have had to come after Christ and What's more is that Christ did display violence in his life when He cleared the money changers from the temple. I am proud of my MIlitary service as well as the service of my Father, Uncles, Grandfather, and Great-Grandmother. If you don't like our country there is another right you should exercise -- the right to leave!!!!!!!!|`|AA12100081	You are misguided, Christians don't go to war, physical violence is not the way of Christ. Jesus never advocated the use of violence and early Christians never resorted to violence despite often facing certain violent death/persecution themselves.    Warriors who may believe that they are christian are deluding themselves and are wholly misguided. Warriors dying in combat cannot expect to go to heaven.    The idea of Cristian warfare came from a corrupt pope (Urban II) in 1095 who called for crusades to colonise the holy lands and to repatriate the entire wealth of the region (Christian orthodox or Muslim) back to Rome.    His motivation was to plunder and his message appealed to warrior knights and mostly to criminals who were offered spiritual absolution (and a share of the plunder) in return for the ethnic cleansing of Jerusalem and surrounding lands.    As a result, tens of thousands of innocent Muslims (and indiginous orthodox Christians) were killed by the crusaders, and the Catholics even admitted cooking muslim babies on spit roasts before eating them (due to excessive hunger after a long campaign).    It seems that in recent times little has changed (other than the fact that western forces don't eat the muslims any more, but the slaughter goes on).    A similar corrupt ideology (violent defence of the faith) is used by a small number of Islamists and you have Al queda as a result.    George Bush (not Catholic) called for a crusade and no Muslim was in doubt that his mission (again) was to plunder.    Tony Blair (Catholic) however called for a just war but of course he was aware that he had no legal justification and so he simply lied to parliament.    Everyone has the choice to take up arms and pacifists and true Christians either escape their military duty or else sign up as pacifists and often have become medics (often in the front line and amongst the bravest in WW2) without carrying weapons.    What America calls insurgents are simply ordinary people in their own land who would wish to protect their property and country from invading American imperial forces.    Simply there is no place for violence in Christendom.|`|Ln5XNno3aa	WOW!! get a life. So now I have to listen to one more A** call me a baby killer, or tell me i'm going to hell because I went to war. Yeah you could be retarded!!|`|35BLOIgOaa	GROW UP|`|dVQdswtTaa	Jesus never fought "a bunch of Islams" is your example?

And if they didn't come here and kill American "wives and kids" then we wouldn't have been forced to go there and harm theirs.|`|AA11130104	If you look at the ten commandments in the original Aramaic, it does not say "thou shalt not kill".  It says " Thou shalt not murder", and theologically, there is a very big difference.    Catholicism does not dictate that you simply roll over and become  a dhimmi.  There is such a thing as a just war based on Catholic doctrine.    Also, Islam is supposed to be a religion of peace as well, how do you explain the suicide bombs on mentally retarded girls, beheadings, stonings, and all those other fun middle eastern recreational activities?|`|SkWzsnuxaa	As evidence by your question you are rather clueless about religion and war. There is ample scholarship to show there is a difference between killing and murder. The predominant writers of the Just War Theory which has been confirmed as recently as 2003 by the Catholic Church were themselves Catholic saints. The best known is St. Thomas Aquinas.     You have proven nothing but your ignorance. You have proven you know nothing of war or religion and you have shown that you are likely a pacifist willing to allow others to fight for your freedom. In other words, a coward.    Pacifism is freedom's welfare.     Prove me wrong.|`|7f8a9117f8c2b42578a0ea7c3db4fa29aa	opinions are like anuses and yours smells just as bad  but you are entitled to it ,just as I am entitled to mine  human nature is what it is and there will always be some conflict as long as there are people on this earth

You have to be able to understand orders and follow directions.    I don't know about the Army but the Navy has classes for people to improve their English skills. I bet the Army does too. There are a lot of foreign borne military personnel. If you are willing to work on your skills then you should do fine.|`|SkwdQLdVaa	as long as you pass the asvab and you'll be fine.  it's better if you try to get better so you'll be able to communicate with your fellow service members.  sometimes it is frowned upon by other service members, but a lot of americans that can speak fluent english wouldn't even consider serving even if the country wants them to(vietnam war dodgers).  So come on in and we'll help you out on your verbal skills|`|1HLPznZhaa	barbabma- ( Hope I remembered that ) has given you a great answer..As I am ex-navy , would suggest you discuss this with the recruiter  of the branch of service you are interested in ..Good luck|`|yuDyMGmaaa	Yeah, as long you can pass ASVAB, if you good in math, then you will pass even if you score low in english, however there's a catch, for those those who score low in english section, will has to take the english section of asvab alike test in bootcamp again, if they fail they will has to take weeks of english learning class (cause delay of your graduation) You will be in that class as long if you don't pass.

They say they are "Christians" but do the exact OPPOSITE of what Jesus would do. They scream at liberals for trying to take care of their brother or neighbor. They call liberals "whiney", "sissies" and "tree-huggers". They are full of hate and judge everybody harshly, even though Jesus said, "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone." They rally against gay marriage, then get busted for being an in-the-closet-homosexual. They are the ultimate hypocrites. They say they are pro-american all the time, yet slap our great forefathers in the face by tampering with elections, abusing their power, and bringing religion into politics.

The capital flew into a bit of a tizzy when, on his first full day in the White House, President Obama was photographed in the Oval Office without his suit jacket. There was, however, a logical explanation: Mr. Obama, who hates the cold, had cranked up the thermostat.  Hes from Hawaii, O.K.? said Mr. Obamas senior adviser, David Axelrod, who occupies the small but strategically located office next door to his boss. He likes it warm.

Then for the Democratic Party questioning Sarah Palin about her leadership capabilities when it was learned she had a teenage daughter that was pregnant.  There was no reason for the media and the Democratic Party to use some of the terms that the used during the election about Palin and her daughter.  Palin has been a role model as the governor of Alaska, where she hunts and fishes to the dismay of the media.  Meanwhile Obama sits in the Oval Office and keeps saying that relief is coming, however, thousands of people daily are losing their jobs, while Obama sends billions to foreign government to provide abortions, instead of extending the length of time  for the unemployed to receive benefits, or providing training or jobs for those people.  Many of the manufacturing jobs are being done robotic while other jobs were sent to China and Mexico as a result of Bill Clinton signing NAFTA, causing further unemployment and foreclosures on homes.|`|Y7RbTYNvaa	Wow, there are so many. Lol.  I tend to be most annoyed with the people in both major parties who refuse to acknowledge their own party's responsibility and culpability in our current problem's and govt. failures.  On Obama's part, for one, he promised transparency,etc. and "a change in the way Washington does business."  But now there a two tax cheats, among other things, in his admin.  But the Dems don't seem to have a problem with this.  The GOP/neo-cons, for refusing to hold George W.

I feel this is a mistake. They once thought that there would be no more dogfights too. What they tried to do was take out the machine guns.MISTAKE! They had to re arm the jets with guns after all.  While I don't have long experience with the M-16 I did find it cumbersome and difficult to wield.. Further I would rather have a larger round.Actually there was nothing about it that I did like.  You are right about the pork thing though.  Short story here.  Back when I was in the Air Force we ordered ONE nut for an aircraft. It had to be a "special" nut too. Anodized and hardened and all that.  It was ordered in quadruplicate forms.  A while later a forklift came with a 55 gallon steel drum with a lead seal on the closure to indicate if it had been tampered with.The drum was filled with these special nuts.The form has either been filled out wrong or misread.  There was some discussion about what to do. The shop chief wanted to just keep them all in the shop. The delivery guy said that since we had only ordered one, that's all we were allowed to keep. OK said the chief and said no matter because the rest of the drum would just go back to the warehouse and we could order another one if we needed it. The driver said that wasn't going to happen. He told us that there was too much paper work involved in re-stocking the now opened barrel.  The whole barrel of these very expensive aircraft grade nuts were to be dumped and sold to a recycler as scrap metal for pennies.  Outright stupidity! I was there and saw this with my own eyes.  I know we need the best equippment to save our lives and take as many of the enemies as possible at the same time. They go too far sometimes though.

A new global government is poised to take over and as the US, under Obama, relinquishes it's protective position (US bases in Europe will be turned over and staffed by EU military personnel), expansionism is imminent.      Eventually, due to economic crisis, and Russian agression, mostly everyone will run to a now-forming global government for relief, including the US.|`|NPymuePEaa	Expansion as in Imperialism? No thanks, nobody is or wants any of your "business" especially not by force.
oOly8Wj2aa	No. When people say "pro-choice," they typically mean, "for the ability for a woman to make the choice to abort a fetus." "Pro-life," conversely, means that a woman should not be able to make this choice.    They're both weasley terms for what could better be called "For the right to abort" and "Against the right to abort". But by using terms like "life" and "choice", both sides attach powerful meaning to their arguments: after all, EVERYBODY likes the ability to live and to make choices!|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	You can be against abortions put believe in a woman's right to choose. Is that what you mean?|`|AA10168935	I'm pro-life.  That's why I'm Pro-Choice. The life of the pregnant female is the only life involved in this issue.|`|WDWtHcK4aa	Pro choice = killing babies  Pro life = not killing babies  The democrats try to make pro choice sound  like you are   making a purchase|`|GbLmBcIoaa	Neither "pro-life" and "pro-choice" mean exactly what they say.  They are commonly used to mean "pro-life-for-the-unborn" and "pro-abortion-choice".  In the usual senses, then, No, you can't be both.    If, however, you are looking at what the terms *could* mean instead of what they do mean, then the answer is Yes, it's easy to be both.  One could favor peaceful coexistence and liberty for all.  Or one could favor the right to choose to abort a child and support the livelihoods of abortionists.  The options for what the terms could mean are endless.|`|LkHzsRcDaa	When you are pro-life, you are really making abortion illegal, but that does not stop women from getting back-alley abortions, which are more dangerous than abortions done in a professional clinic. For pro-choice, abortion is legal, which is safer for women in general. I don't see how you can make abortion both legal and illegal, but maybe if you just don't care.|`|de5bda1b9dad2b1e94d22f6f86adf6beaa	Those who are Pro-choice have to admit the choice is for both choices not just one.  One choice is for abortion  the other choice is for life.    When you say choose life is an outrage to Pro-choice or if you suggest that women be given all the information about alternatives is bad that is not choice.    You can't make good choices without all the good information.    The fact is we now have a president who doesn't see that baby born alive as a baby but a choice to be allow to be murder by the mother.    When that baby is born your right to choose to terminate that child's life has ended.    Obama thinks it OK to let a baby die of neglect that is Pro-abortion not Pro-choice.|`|heWtmILYaa	I believe you absolutely can be both.  If I were a pregnant woman I would carry the child to term and either keep it or give it up for adoption.  At the same time, I would not want the federal government telling me what I can and can not do with my body.|`|Aq0QQnxeaa	you can be both, you could feel that there may be some circumstances where it would be appropriate to let the woman decide if she wants to abort or not such as if it is going to be harmful to her health, if she was raped etc. but not for reasons such as she just doesn't want to have a baby.     Also, roman Catholics have had many different stand points on this in the past from the baby not having a soul until delivery to the most common today that it has a soul at the moment of conception.    Then you also have the issue of some thinking that the time line is a factor when deciding on the morality of aborting. Some believe that once a baby's heart beats it is too late to abort. Some people believe that it is always too late to abort or that it is not too late up to the point of giving birth.     Therefor, just being pro-life or pro-choice are very inaccurate and some one who considers them selves pro-choice could hold the same views as some one who considers themselves pro-life. Then there are people like bells3011 said who are against abortions for themselves but think that others should be able to make that choice for themselves.|`|3f8acf9b0e71dce6c6d8361076633a62aa	I dont believe so. Pro-life mean's you are against a woman's right to choose. Pro-choice means you are for a woman's right to choose.    I am pro-life. I am for the baby's right to live. To me the pregnancy is about the baby not the mother. I know people who had babies in both cases of rape and in cases of where the baby wouldnt live after birth. They are not traumatized. I am a mother myself and my children's lives are far more valuable to me than my own.|`|QNE6c77yaa	Can you be pro cow and pro hamburger?|`|56KYR6WAaa	to each there on|`|NSFuIeZYaa	I agree that you can be both. Abortion is a terrible thing, but it all depends on the situation. Everyone should have the right to choose.|`|3eb0DIxGaa	The real choice should be pro-choice, or anti-choice. Everybody is pro-life. Giving a woman the choice between having an unwanted pregnancy resulting in untold misery for all involved, or having a simple proceedure to alleviate the situation. This should be the choice of the persons immediately involved, not some bible thumping alledged christian.|`|vFqUi1CBaa	This is very complicated but yet it's not. In my opinion you cannot be Pro-life AND Pro-choice at the same time.    If you believe that abortion is murder and you believe nobody should have the choice to have an abortion then by definition itself you are Pro-life. To be Pro-choice means that you believe in the right to choose yes or no to abortion. Pro-choice is a nice clean, antiseptic way of saying that you are Pro-abortion. That ould make you a murderer. Blood would be on YOUR hands.    Blood would be on your hands even if you never had an abortion. For every person that even says they are Pro-choice there is blood on their hands. For every person who voted in a Democrat there is blood on their hands because Democrats believe in abortion.   I was visiting the Obama website one day and I noticed that in his platform of beliefs he did not mention abortion or Pro-anything. I think the reason is that everyone already knows how the Democrats believe but they didn't want to flaunt it because they thought they might lose a lot of fence sitters. So they kept quiet.   Abortion is murder and this country will pay the price.|`|cbIxKGZVaa	There are certain circumstances where I agree with abortion    1) The mother was raped and will suffer serious mental anguish during the pregnancy even if she plans on adopting after birth     2) There is a medical condition that either effects the life or the baby or the life of the mother|`|eomrfXrzaa	Yes, absolutely.  I am.  I hate abortion and tell people not to do it, but I vote pro-choice.  My opinion is not fact, and it is not the government's place to tell people what to do with their bodies.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Yes you can.|`|2dke6ChJaa	sure, why not|`|7BVyV4Fdaa	No. Pro-life is believing in life, and standing up for those who can't yet speak for themselves.... not deciding on who is "perfect" enough to walk this planet. Yes, in cases babies do die. It's sad, and out of our control. But I had a friend who was losing amniotic fluid. The Doctor told her to abort, and she didn't. She regained the amniotic fluid and her son was born healthy. I'm not saying that will happen every time, but there would be more children walking this earth if we didn't abort at the first sign of a problem. We should educate more on using protection, instead of using abortions as birth control. If the baby dies naturally, it's not our fault... but if we suck it out just because something "may" happen... it is. It's murder, and it's wrong.     You can't always have it both ways.|`|kCwhs8Reaa	Yes, I think you can ... I feel like I am both.    I think you can personally feel or believe that you personally would not do it, but at the same time you respect the belief that it is EACH woman's choice to choose what is best for her. I don't feel any of us have a right to tell someone else what to do with their body.|`|AA10329269	Sure. I'm pro-choice and pro-life. Make good choices when it comes to having safe sex. Then you never have to make the choice to have an abortion or not....|`|CmG8oTH0aa	Only if you are a Man.  Because you really never have to decide.|`|wtcAK31Paa	No.|`|7zf05NWsaa	Good point.    Obviously you can be both then.. nice one!|`|5d9pCmjyaa	I suppose you could consider me both, since I moderate my opinion.  I'm pro choice in the first trimester and pro life in the third trimester while I'm open to debate about the second.|`|GWz5KDTwaa	Absolutely.  Abortion is just a necessary evil to control the population.  Just like deer hunting is used to control the deer population and keep the overall species at a healthy level, we cannot allow humans to overpopulate either.   Abortion, along with birth control, are the tools we need keep our species healthy.|`|eeaXYyCNaa	Yes you can.      But, people should stop having unprotected sex and then letting the abortion clinics take care of it.  Isn't this why we have sex ed in schools? To teach our kids that when egg meets sperm you get babies.    Rape I don't think is the same.  If someone is raped I think they have the right because they did not make a decision to have sex unprotected.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	I don't think that anyone is "pro-death" if they are for the choice when it comes to abortion.    It really puzzles me when I see how people that are pro choice are "baby killers" and such.  I don't want to run out and have an abortion, and I don't want my daughter to have that, either.  But I am appreciative that the choice is up to me and my daughter if it ever comes to light (I have a few years with my daughter - she is only 3 right now).  But I don't think it is up to anyone to tell another human what they have to do with their body based on someone else's beliefs.  I feel that is a selfish thought.  Unfortunately that is not the thought of everyone.  If it were, then we wouldn't be having the debate, would we??    addition:    To all those that think practicing safe sex is the answer - I have a 3 year old daughter due to sex with a condom and on birth control.  The only way to assure you don't get pregnant is by not having sex.  In this day and age, that is not a reality.  Nothing is 100% effective, and anyone that thinks otherwise is only fooling themselves.  Babies don't do percentages well.|`|Yzb44aV6aa	Yeah, that's when you dont have abortions but think that other people should have a choice in their personal lives.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	No.  Pro-Life want government to ban abortions.  Pro-Choice want people to make the decision whether or not to seek the abortion themselves.  They are mutually exclusive classifications.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Yes, you can feel one way about yourself and another way about someone else.  You can hope for pro-life but understand that people deserve the choice.|`|9qKAy0dlaa	No but you can be pro-life and pro braking the law by imposing to others like a daughter.|`|iZDsMCghaa	No you cant.  You either are a supporter of the right to an abortion or your not. If you think well, in this case its wrong, in this case its right, than your pro-choice.|`|25faf33e24f40cd4a39b1314c62123a4aa	Nope.

He is a token who doesn't truly reflect all the values and beliefs of the vast majority of people who voted Republican lately.

But the leaders think that if they don't compromise (their values), they won't have a future as a party.  The same kind of thinking is affecting mainstream denominational churches.

AA10932453	Farsi is in high demand with the Army, but that ASVAB is killing you.    You need to get your ASVAB score up.  A 33 will get you in, but if you want to leverage your language skills, you need some other things as well.    Air Force is better than the Army for creature comforts in garrison, but can be worse for actual missions.  That depends upon you.  Would you rather be gone every other month (Army) or every other three days (some Air Force jobs).  Better really depends upon you and your family situation.    Do you mind being stationed in the middle of nowhere, like Minot, North Dakota (AF)?  Or do you prefer being stationed in the middle of nowhere, like Killeen, TX (Army)?    Don't let the impressions left by a recruiter influence your judgement.  As a rule, they are slimier than used-car dealers.  Sure, there are nice recruiters, but I have never had one tell me the truth about anything that mattered.  As always, I'm sure it is just 99% of recruiters giving the other 1% a bad name.    Do your own research, discover what you want, then you go in and tell the recruiter you are willing to sign-up for job X for Y years.  You might have to flex a bit -- like wait 6 months for a ship date, et al -- but if you are firm, no recruiter is going to turn you away.  They have their quotas.    I am always going to tell you Army is better, because that is what I picked.  But Air Force is good too, in some ways better.  You need to pick what is right for you.    If you want some help discovering which questions you should be asking, feel free to email me.  But your first step is to start doing the practice ASVABs and get that score up.    Thanks for being willing to serve.|`|4t2kd03Waa	Your best long term bet is to get a bachelors degree from college, specializing in mid eastern affairs, join the state department as a foreign service officer and who knows, someday you may become an ambassador.    If you insist on the military, join the army and request duty on a generals staff with central command or another with interest in Iran.|`|KtwXqIYHaa	well if your going to join the military dont go into the Marines. Then again im pretty sure your going to get cussed at no matter what branch. And you better be able to stand up for yourself because thats not a good leadership trait. You have to be a leader and be able to take anything, make sure you have Bearing too. You probably should not consider the military. But if you do go in and make it alot of branches will give you more money or something for knowing other languages, as long as you pass their exams for it.
6Fsliwlhaa	The Army will take you if you are enlisting as a linguist for a critical language like Arabic.    Otherwise, they are going all you to come back after you can manage to score at least a 31 or 50 if you have a GED.    It's surprising how fast someone will thumb you down because they THINK your answer is wrong before they even research it.  Check out this link about the MOS 09L and you will see that it isn't:    http://usmilitary.about.com/library/mili...    Anyway, you should strive for the highest score since that, combined with your medical and moral qualifications, can possibly get you the best jobs.|`|rulCYZXkaa	The minimum requirements for the Air Force is a 32 QT score.  Waivers can be given for lower scores, but it is unlikely given force reductions.  As a recruiter I would send all my low ASVAB testers to the Army.  I believe their minimum is a 23.    That is a pretty bad score.  If your branch of choice requires a higher score you can retest.  Talk to the local recruiter.|`|gAGMLfnmaa	honestly bro if you got a 29 on the asvab you are borderline retarded.  dont join the service or peace corps or anything else where somebody's life is at stake!|`|Nglm1b1vaa	how the hell can someone get a 29? wow, shameful.|`|IdtzdpqGaa	no, you need to study and try practice exams and do a retake|`|AA10709853	not really no.   even the Army's minimum is a 31.

You will also have full coverage medical and dental. Your dependents will only be covered 80% on dental though. You have 30 days a year for leave (vacations). You earn 2.5 days a month witch totals 30 day a year. It all depends on your job and your company. You definately wont be able to take 30 days vacation at once, but its different for every company. You have to request leave, and sometimes you will get it, other times you wont. Sometimes you will only get to take 1 day, sometimes maybe 3 or 4.
Ulff1hcDaa	"Welfare" is a pretty generic term.    Are you talking about the General Assistance program? This program is for people who are newly disabled but have not yet been granted social security. They get $56 per month.  Once they are granted social security we take back all the money paid out of their retro-payment.    Are you talking about TANF? In my state, a single mom and child can be eligible for up to $535 per month.  We would also go after child support from the absent parent and that child support goes towards the $535 grant so my state only pays if the child support is less than the grant.    Maybe you are talking about food stamps?  If you knew anything at all about the system you would know that for every dollar a state grants in a food benefit they get $1.50 pumped into the state economy. It's basic economics.    The big ticket item is health care.  Lots and lots of $$$ spent there but we also go after absent parents and require they purchase insurance for the children.|`|SpcYCBndaa	too much|`|VSWl45cKaa	where? in a city? in a state? in a country? in the world?

AA10617196	It's such a sad day when Blacks are "expected" by other Blacks and the population at large to support democrats only.  Obama's rise to power has hinged on the fact that he is a Black liberal democrat that PRETENDED to be conservative (aided in this farce by the liberal media).    My refusal to bow to the pressure to "vote Black" before the election and now to "get on board" and support this man REALLY baffles some of my relatives.  They attribute my lack of excitement about the first Black president as my being "too young to understand the struggle" and other such NONSENSE.  Quite the contrary- as you can probably attest to, BC- I understand that their is a struggle between good and evil, right and wrong.   I cannot support the policies nor ideological positions of Obama.  I will not "get on board" simply because my ancestors were once slaves in this country and experienced the injustices that followed the abolition of slavery.  NO!  I will not "get on board" with sacrificing the innocent, redefining marriage, redistributing wealth, for ANY reason- the least of ALL being that the president is a Black man!

It depends how long ago you done seletion whether or not you will have to redo it. I thinks its either 6 months or a year and if its been longer then you have to redo selection.

wFK2vVyHaa	You can be working when you file for disability, but you cannot be making more than what Social Security considers to be a substantial gainful amount.  In 2008 that amount was $940 for a non blind individual and $1570 for a blind individual.  In 2009 the amounts increased to $980 for a non blind individual and $1,640 for a blind individual.    There is also unsuccessful work attempts. If you are disabled to work for 30 days or more and then return to work and earn over the above limits, but the work attempt lasts less than 3 months due to your condition, the work and earnings can be disregarded. This is also true if the work attempt lasts between 4 - 6 months if other conditions are met.    Social Security representatives are sometimes very lazy when it comes to finding the earliest possible date you became disabled.  They usually want to show the date you last worked and this can cause you to lose monthly benefits for past months.    You do not have to be totally disabled to work to get Social Security disability benefits.  You only must be totally disabled to work and earn over what they consider to be substantial and gainful employment due to your condition.|`|21Wk2mu5aa	Absolutely!

People criticise a supposed problem with his position in that he is 'unelected', but in fact this is a regular occurence in all democracies.  Nobody can say that any individual member of the United States Cabinet (apart from the President himself) is elected; and in France, Italy and other countries, it is routine to appoint members of the Cabinet without constituencies.    We simply go one point further and give him a seat in the second chamber.  This gives us the benefit of his expertise (like him or not, he's been in many senior positions and worked in the EU), and is counterbalance by the second chamber's subordinate position to the elected House.    Can't say fairer than that.
0f1dab55ac5d9e5c72db9469d1cff7d3aa	There are three major types of electoral system in use in most major elections, but I will also explain three that are not in use as much at present in the world, although they might actually be better, you decide:    Type 1: Only one person gets a seat in parliament from each district, even if the outcome is A17% B16% C14% D11% E10% F9% G9% H9%. This is 'first past the post'. It gives the win and hence the seat in parliament[/Congress/the chamber of deputies/the house of commons/the council/the senate/....it might even have been the presidential election] simply to whoever scored the most votes in one round of voting. If the outcome above is the same in all districts, then one party (A) would win ALL 100% of seats with only 17% of voters actually choosing this party in the election booth but 100% of seats being won.    2. PR (proportional representation) - all votes nationwide are pooled (with no electoral districts and each party is given the percentage of seats that = the %age of votes they won in the election, so with 11% of the votes, party D would still get 11% of seats, and hence a much greater say (and better representation) than the above system in which they would be given 0.    3. Run-offs system: The top two in each district go on to a 2nd round of voting, in which voters have only these 2 options, so the winner WILL win an ABSOLUTE MAJORITY here (= over 50%). You could even have a pure run-off system, where the 16 who had the most nominations go into 8 matches, the winners advance into the quarter-finals, then there's the semis for the winners of those and the finals.    4. Round robin system: Each voter chooses a or b, and also chooses a or c and also b or c +.... and the eventual winner has beaten all others head-to head (with an absolute majority), hence has a much wider basis of support than in the above systems     - it could be combined with first-past-the-post so that the top three go head to head, while all others are in a 4th bracket, and then next time, the top 2 of the 3 + the winner of the others bracket form the a or b, a or c and b or c decider, while the losers are back down in the qualifying bracket again OR full round-robin, where voters also have boxes on their ballot for e versus f, e versus b, e vs j, e vs k, .....    5. Transferable Vote System: Each voter indicates his 1st, 2nd and 3rd preference and then the candidate with the least 1st-preference votes is eliminated first, and the voters who choose him as their 1st preference are re-allocated to their 2nd preference. The totals are calculated again. Then the next-lowest is eliminated but his voters are also re-allocated according to their next-lower preference, .... until only one is left, the winner (and all voters have either backed him or the 2nd place candidate on some level, and more have backed 1st than 2nd guaranteed).    6. Vote bundle system: Rather than being able only to choose one candiate and give him one vote, you give each voter the right to hand out votes worth 10, 5, 3, 2, 1, -1, -4 points, or each voter gives each candidate points out of five, or something like that, i.e. a points system of some sort is used|`|75NM6Zhtaa	First past the post is the way our parlia|`|jCPM5GJiaa	first past the post is a racing jargon.

In a normal British national election or by-election (i.e. excluding the newer formats that have been used in recent regional elections for devolution), those who wish to fight an election register to do so. When the election takes place, for example a by-election for a constituency MP for Westminster, the person who wins the highest number of votes within that constituency, wins that election. FPTP is as clear and as brutal as that. Only in the very rarest of cases has a re-count been ordered due to the closeness of that specific result, but in the vast majority of cases, FPTP allows for a clear winner|`|uXrQxxWMaa	UK voting system in General Elections.

What the Ministry of Truth does not tell us is that for every Bill Gates "rags to riches" story, there are millions of Americans who put their hearts and souls into success and stay mired in the quicksand of perpetual poverty. True social mobility is rare in gAmerica, and the Oligarchs under Bush aim to make it rarer still. They understand the truth of the maxim that "he who has the gold makes the rules". Oligarchs have most of the gold, and they are strengthening their capacities to make the rules. Media perpetuation of hubris, xenophobia, and homophobia enable the Oligarchs to convince Americans that despite genocidal acts against Native Americans, enslavement of the black race, the internment of American citizens of Japanese descent during World War II, imperialistic policies in the Middle East since the end of World War II, and ongoing discrimination against women and minorities, that we are morally superior to the rest of the world. Despite creating 25% of the carbon dioxide responsible for the Greenhouse Effect, denying its existence, and withdrawing from the Kyoto Treaty; defying the UN and preparing to send an antagonistic war-monger as our new ambassador; and hoarding 35% of the world's wealth when we represent 4% of the world's population, the Oligarchs somehow convince Americans that we were innocent victims in 9/11. America has infuriated much of the world population for years, and someone finally struck back. Rather than taking the rational steps of changing our narcissistic and imperialistic behavior, and taking reasonable steps to defend ourselves, the Oligarchs continue with imperialistic actions that fan the flames of hostility. Perpetuating this cycle of violence creates America's dependence on the Oligarchs' cash cows: the military industrial complex and big oil.|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	If you believe the government can be effective in helping to solve the problems facing our country - you're a social liberal.

Because if you try to rely on charity & self-help alone to solve all problems, you end up with a society where the vast majority of the population has no health, deeply crappy fun&games only education, if any, is one robbery away from homelessness at all times, one swindle also, one accident at work (do you think insurance companies would help you out if you had an accident & if the govt was not breathing down their neck? Palease.), or just a nasty employer who cares not what he does to you - in so many, ways, you would be in a world with no safety net, just a deep, deep fall, as soon as you have a really bad day, sometimes one you could never recover from.    If you take the libertarian approach to do NOTHING about poverty, unemployment, pollution, ... what do you expect the outcome to be?    Sure, a lot of good work done by charities, yes. But it would not help all the people who need it most survive a rough year, and help build a better year thereafter, particluarly the elderly, the very young and the disabled would be likely to suffer + all those who just aren't good at making a stranger love them in a 10-minute job interview, perhaps they are just bad liers/lyers.    I can well understand the libertarian idea of optimism, that things would work out well if the govt did not interfere, and I fully support you in that opinion.    But you wanted to understand the left point of view better.    Think of it like this: we're either all in it for ourselves, all-against-all warfare  OR we work together, learn to share, learn to build things we can all benefit from (libertarians would never have built the highway system for example - only the left can oblige people to work together, through public sector institutions), give money so lots of fight-poverty and build nice-things projects can become reality, and so that there are people who will look after you, even if you lose all your insurance papers and fall-backs along with your house. That, to a leftie, is why you need some social liberalism in your government. A fully lefty government would give everybody TV to watch WITHOUT all the annoying adverts (and PBS telethons) - this is a good example of what could be achieved with the public sector allowed to do things for us (as opposed to the righties always wanting to turn the funding tap off).|`|CmG8oTH0aa	Social Liberalism is what the constitution called for.

67be362fa9bfa1a21547a78f99144ed6aa	The creation of Black History Month has nothing to do with white guilt or reflecting on horrible treatment.  As someone already pointed out, it has spread to other countries and was founded because African Americans were mentioned in history classes only when covering slavery.  There was no other acknowledgment of their myriad achievements or contributions to American life.      White History Month is unnecessary in the United States - all history studies center on the work of European descendants.  If it weren't so white-centric to begin with, there wouldn't be any need for Black - or Asian American (May) or Hispanic American (September) - History Months!|`|jA2VJXzFaa	ye probably|`|nmvgZWvpaa	Black History Month is in name only. Very few people actually celebrate it in its entirety. And to answer your question, white guilt plays a big role in its celebration. USA does not advertise Hispanic History Month because American History will them isn't as bad. We feel like we have to pay for the sins of the past that we don't owe.     It's only celebrated in the USA because it only looks at contributions of blacks that lived here.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	I think we should have White History Month. I get that we have St. Patricks day and all but we deserve more than a day.|`|CsIvy5MAaa	It was created by a black man...So no?    Also, the UK does it too, but it's later in the year.

Whites have taught lies throughout history.   They even had the audacity to say that the Ancient Egyptians were white, when they were clearly black.   Even the Bible counts them as descendants of Ham.  The bible states that Mizram (Egypt) and Cush (Ethiopia) were brothers.  Egypt is even located on the Continet of Africa.   Whites have been trying to disconnect it from Africa for decades.   They have tried to say that it is part of the Middle East without recognizing the Continent in which it resides.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	No, it is more of a rather belated recognition that African Americans contributed to this country and yet were excluded from mention in the history books.

Let it go already.|`|DY9NOh4taa	Absolutely not, In the United States,  Black History Month is held in February, while the UK celebrates it in October. It was started by historian Carter G. Woodson.   Black History Month, started out in 1926 as Negro History Week, held the second week in February, in order to honor Abraham Lincoln, and abolitionist Frederick Douglass.  Some African Americans like Morgan Freeman feel that it serves to undermine the contention that black history is American history.  The celebration of Black History Month sparks debate about the usefulness and fairness of a month being dedicated to one race, while others feel that it is irrelevant and has been denigrated to a shallow ritual.  There are many cities across the country hold parades and parties in support, while many other cities do nothing, because of problems in previous years with gangs and fights that cast the celebrations into a bad light for the community and African Americans.  In recent years people like Jesse Jackson, complains that it is too little too late. Jackson is only one among a group that seeks to cause friction between the races every chance that they get.
Irjopfpvaa	It's not his job to keep you updated, or unbiased.    The current economic situation started way back in 2007...even before October 2008 when stocks start to plummet.     The house bubble starts to burst in 2007. Back then, there was a little news about banks in France which froze their assets. Nothing in media, but Greenspan and the rests in the Bush government are already disturbed by the growing numbers of houses not selling and foreclosed...Yet they did nothing and hide the facts (like the recession) and let the situation deteriorate.

Wow, that sounds like Obama's stimulus plan.|`|9dEotvVwaa	Inflation is merely an increase in the retail cost of goods.  Several things have an impact on retail costs however under normal circumstances costs are mainly driven by two factors, labor, and the cost of raw materials. In service oriented industries, labor is comprises the majority of a company's costs.  In manufacturing, raw materials comprise a large portion of the company's costs.  However in most businesses Labor is the largest component of costs.  Everyone who has a job wants a raise so most businesses factor in an annual increase in their labor expense.  So this in itself will cause inflation as would an increase in the price of raw materials, or energy costs, or any one of a number of other costs.|`|jMOzKFmJaa	In former times it was gold and silver that used to be currencies. They were mint into coins. You could actually mint more coins if you had more silver or gold to use in such a process. But when wooden "cash" came into existence it had nothing to do with actual stocks of gold or silver or other valuables rulers really had at their disposal to support their wooden "currencies". Printing of paper "money" depends only on policies currently implemented by your government (or by Federal Reserve which is even higher than the Government). So, a temptation to print more and more paper money when they are not enough is simply too high. This leads to these money inflation.|`|ZkMfdTgBaa	Usually one of two things or both at the same time  - too much money available, and /or decreasing value of the money on hand.  Usually the government printing and distributing too much cash is the major problem.

That your candidate had less experience than the Republican VP choice candidate?    c] The acceptance of Palin as a VP running mate, rocked the Obama's campaign to its core, and ever since, the liberals, like yourself, are seeking to demolish her for that humiliation....

Freedom is an ability of a person to freely practice those freedoms (in their entirety) given to him by his Creator. If there is anyone who limits freedoms written in the Bible it means he oppresses you and deprives you of your freedoms.

5d9pCmjyaa	Fact: The US trade deficit is currently around 40 billion dollars per month.    If all trade stopped completely, America woud go from a net negative 40 billion dollars per month to a net zero loss.    How is that a bad thing?    The situation is completely reversed from the 1930s.  Then we were a net exporter.  Today we're a big net importer.  Then it hurt us.  Today, it would help us.  Really quite simple.    But in all honesty, you just cant cut off all trade and expect it all to be good.  We currently lack the industry to replace those import items we would be banning.  Thus, simple protectionsim would cause scarcities.  What would be needed, then, is a big push to rebuild the American industrial base before we cut off imports.

I have horrible Dad that did nothing right by my mother or me, he was just an a-hole in every possible way. I tried resolving things with him, getting help for my feelings in therapy, everything...nothing helped until I decided to never speak to him again. What a liberating feeling!    I hated bearing my jerk-off Dad's name, and would have changed it legally. I ended up falling love with a great guy, and changing my name in marriage, but if I hadn't, I was already seriously considering having my name legally changed to my mom's, since I feel she is my true family (I am not at all close to my dad's side, they are like strangers to me anyway.    I don't blame you at all for considering this. No, it's not necessary, but it could help you to separate yourself from the constant reminder of your father and whatever ill things he did. Psychologically, it is such a weight off for me to not see his horrible last name every day, and instead, see the name of someone I love and who loves me!    So, think this through: if you don't mind the legal hassle it is to legally change your name, it could benefit you emotionally. I am personally very happy to no longer have ties to my biological father.    Just my 2 cents. Good luck whatever you decide.|`|4xzl9wGDaa	No he is still your father no matter what.  Life is too short learn how to live and forgive|`|H8ulAiTaaa	Your last name doesn't equate to just your father. It symbolizes the entire family tree on his side. Likewise for your mother's maiden name. Don't change your name due to his actions ... but if you want to change it due to personal preference go ahead.|`|38a6a271a6f3afff0a706e5aae1f9057aa	I think if it's what you want to do, go for it.  It's just a name, and if you are happier without his name, so be it.  My best friend's dad cheated on her mom, left the family and basically had no more contact with them after that.  So she took her mom's name.|`|xhyRWBZDaa	It is all up to you, if you want to change your name.  I asked my mother to change my last name when I was 12 years old.  I hadnt talked to my real father for 5 years, and he didnt want anything to do with me, so I had my last name changed to my "Step" dads name because i considered him my real father.    The military helped out with this a lot, there were no legal costs or anything, but i dont know how it is with civilians.  Hope this helps.|`|6Gfz125Paa	No, that's stupid.      There are thousands of people in the US with the last name Bush.  Should they change it?|`|5YTkGB5yaa	No. That ridiculous.|`|AA11598520	No.|`|e6f57551a9fea96616d64364edaca81faa	It is not unnecessary. But if you want nothing to do with him, then change it.  But you have to be over 18 or have your mother do it for you.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Na the problems it causes is more than it is worth  .  Getting the banks updated can be near impossible   .  And getting store credit cards can be just as hard  .  And then there is the thing of the telephone book number and you  .  You better not have any long lost friends that just might one day pop into town and try and look up your phone number  .  And then there is the bummer of trying to forget who you use to be and who you are  When you hear someone holler out your old name and they don't know your new one  .  And you have some new friends that you are with that don't know of your change you name thing  .  So if you do get ready for a second trip to the court to get things put back the way they use to be  .  I did it one time 30 years ago and the mess I got my self into because of it has cost me a couple of thousand dollars in getting everything back the way it was when I was born  .
0jhzFOV8aa	Yes, all military and defense support for Europe.  WWII was over 60 years ago.  Time for them to pay their own security bills. They have lots of extra cash for nationalized health insurance, worker's comp and 5 weeks paid vacation.  After we have those things for our own people then we can give subsidies to rich nations with skilled workers competing with our own for jobs.|`|Ca8i226Xaa	Yes, of course! How can we justify all that foreign aid while our country has an almost $11 trillion national debt? We are borrowing money to give to foreign countries. Don't count on Congress cutting foreign aid; remember, our president Barry is a citizen of the world, and he wants Congress to pass the Global Poverty Act.    Obamas Global Poverty Act  by Edward Cline  (April 3, 2008)  http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=515...    Congress is proposing, in Barack Obama's Global Poverty Act (S.2433, based on H.R. 1302, passed by the House September 25, 2007), that Americans be delivered into a state of indentured servitude as laborers for the United Nations. Perhaps "indentured servitude" is too kind a term, for as horrendous a condition as it is, there is usually a time limit to such servitude. Slavery would be the more accurate term in this instance, for what Congress is considering is servitude by Americans in perpetuity, in exchange for nothing but the privilege of laboring to "save" the world without thanks or reward, of filling the alleged needs of others, of performing unlimited "community service" for the offense of merely existing.|`|MEReSvZeaa	In a $13 trillion economy, $5 billion is chump change.

rVnTnuU1aa	You are required to pay for you uniforms when going into basic. After your first year, you will begin to receive a clothing allowance to cover those things.    They don't cover hygiene products, but they issue you a advancement on your first pay in basic for all of those needs. They give you a card to use with 250 at first generally.|`|2zhQznahaa	Nah thats bullshit.

You are given a card that has 250 dollars of advance pay from your first paycheck when you arrive. You are brought to the PX to buy hygiene products and other necessities for BCT (you are given a list of things to buy).    Realistically you will end up using barely any of that 250 while in training unless things have changed, which I'm sure they have.|`|v0ZvjE0Iaa	they'll give you a 50 dollar card which is an advance of your first paycheck, which you can use at the PX on base.

JFK, MLK, Bobby Kennedy, etc would be considered Right -Wingers in today's world. Liberals believed that their dollar was "their" dollar and didn't go to those who won't work or won't contribute to keeping this country free. Just look up in the dictionary & in no way are today's Liberals in the same definition of the word. Democrats AND Republicans were completely different than what they are categorized as of now.

I6dcRgD6aa	I have the same question. I though it was going to go to the rebuilding of our infrastructure. I know the levies in New Orleans were scheduled to be rebuilt but once Bush came in office their were budjet cuts & the work never got done which cost us more. There have been bridges that have falling down & killed people so we need this work done. While the people repair them they will get off of gov. assistance & for not much more money they will be able to hopefully spend money which helps other people make money. I know money will go to education which ends up preparing people for jobs that are now going to people in India for example. I know Bill Gates found at one time he could not hire people from this country because they were not educated to do what he needed. I think this was all announced but just like we forgot Bush said if we went to war the military would be home in 2 days, we forgot what the money was for. I know there is a website but I forgot what it was. This should give the real answer which is going to be much better than the rumors & untrue info. the left spreads. To me the whole point is to get the economy pumped up & once that happens it should be able to work on its own.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	2/3 of this bill is pork....its nothing more than an attempt by Dems to exploit the recession in order to push through their agenda.|`|8454b08cd94e39ec6f1c2eb2f2b07a68aa	We do not get checks like with the last stimulus package.

In most cases it freinds of congressman or buissseness buddies! Nancy Polosky drafted this bill and is a major contributor in who was getting what and where! Any time Nancy Polosky has her claws on any thing she makes sure the people close too her such as Lobbist and special intrest groups get alot of un nessesary money from all of us... She is a huge spender on Lobbist and her freinds...   When I heard this then I knew maybe the Republicans are doing us a favor buy really looking into this Stimulus package!     I feel Obama in general terms may have a good idea, but this Bill I think will be so watered down and have last minute pork or ear marks in it that we the People who are hurting wont see much of it! If we do then I am affraid Obama may have pulled the old bait and swich game on all of us... I think if this does benefit you and me! It wont happen until 2011! WHy?

And now he's saying the phrase "The War on Terror" discriminates against Muslims when in all actuality it doesn't have the name 'Islam' or 'Muslims' in it, it just says War on Terror so what part of that offends Mr. Obama so much?    You cannot appease killers it will only get you killed if you do and I'm seriously worried about our future with someone like him as Commander and Chief of our Military.

Not enough Americans care what their Rights and Responsibilities are and let the government get away with too much.  Many of our rights are being or have been challenged by our own government and American citizens have done little to stop it.  It is a good idea to read the Constitution and to understand that the intent was for people to have more freedom than the government, and for it to be VERY DIFFICULT for the government to get more power.  However, by doing things the Constitution doesn't explicitly DENY, Congress has acquired a lot of power over us that it wasn't meant to have.  Income tax is one such example.|`|IW3jmnKbaa	Rights, we have none anymore, the "patriot act" effectively took care of that. Responsibilities, (and duty) to remove from power any government that turns tyrannous.

So, I guess we're off the hook on that one.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Do to others as you would want them to do to you  .  Easy rule to follow  .

The Constitution PROTECTS specific rights of citizens and enumerates the rights and responsibilities of the federal government.

Socialism refers to a broad set of economic theories of SOCIAL ORGANIZATION advocating state or COLLECTIVE OWNERSHIP and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods, and a society characterized by EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES for all individuals with a FAIR or egalitarian method of compensation. [1][2] Modern socialism originated in the late nineteenth-century working class political movement and the INTELLECTUAL movement of that period which CRITICIZED the EFFECTS OF INDUSTRIALIZATION and PRIVATE OWNERSHIP on society    I didn't capitalize egalitarian because I don't think you would understand.    To me it look a lot like the recent attempts for a massive power shift from the private sector to the federal government by "intellectuals" who think the private sector can't handle itself.

DTSUJe2oaa	ESSAYS IN PUBLIC POLICY    Climate PolicyFrom Rio to Kyoto: A Political Issue for 2000and Beyond      Executive Summary (pdf)   Essay (pdf)   Notes only (pdf)  Within the United States, global warming and related policy issues are becoming increasingly contentious, surfacing in the presidential contests of the year 2000 and beyond. They enter into controversies involving international trade agreements, questions of national sovereignty versus global governance, and ideological debates about the nature of future economic growth and development. On a more detailed level, determined efforts are under way by environmental groups and their sympathizers in foundations and in the federal government to restrict and phase out the use of fossil fuels (and even nuclear reactors) as sources of energy. Such measures would reduce greenhouse-gas emissions into the atmosphere but also effectively deindustrialize the United States.    International climate policy is based on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which calls on industrialized nations to carry out, within one decade, drastic cuts in the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) that stem mainly from the burning of fossil fuels. The Protocol is ultimately based on the 1996 Scientific Assessment Report issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a U.N. advisory body. The IPCC's main conclusion, featured in its Summary for Policymakers (SPM), states that "the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate." This widely quoted, innocuous-sounding but ambiguous phrase has been misinterpreted by many to mean that climate disasters will befall the world unless strong action is taken immediately to cut GHG emissions.    This essay documents the inadequate science underlying the IPCC conclusions, traces how these conclusions were misinterpreted in 1996, and how this led to the Kyoto Protocol. I also discuss some fatal shortcomings of the Protocol and the political and ideological forces driving it.    The IPCC conclusion is in many ways a truism. There certainly must be a human influence on some features of the climate, locally if not globally. The important questionthe focus of scientific debateis whether the available evidence supports the results of calculations from the current General Circulation Models (GCMs). Unless validated by the climate record, the predictions of future warming based on theoretical models cannot be relied on. As demonstrated in this essay, GCMs are not able to account for observed climate variations, which are presumably of natural origin, for the following reaons:    To begin with, GCMs assume that the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide will continue its increase (at a greater rate than is actually observed) and will more than double in the next century. Many experts doubt that this will ever happen, as the world proceeds on a path of ever-greater energy efficiency and as low-cost fossil fuels become depleted and therefore more costly.    Next, one must assume that global temperatures will really rise to the extent calculated by the conventional theoretical climate models used by the IPCC. Observations suggest that any warming will be minute, will occur mainly at night and in winter, and will therefore be inconsequential. The failure of the present climate models is likely due to their inadequate treatment of atmospheric processes, such as cloud formation and the distribution of water vapor (which is the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere).    The putative warming has been labeled as greater and more rapid than anything experienced in human history. But a variety of historical data contradicts this apocalyptic statement. As recently as 1,000 years ago, during the "Medieval climate optimum," Vikings were able to settle Greenland. Even higher temperatures were experienced about 7,000 years ago during the much-studied "climate optimum."    The IPCC's Summary for Policymakers tries hard to minimize the inadequacy of the GCMs to model atmospheric processes and reproduce the observed climate variations. For example, the SPM does not reveal the fact that weather satellite data, the only truly global data we have, do not show the expected atmospheric warming trend; the existence of satellites is not even mentioned.    The scientific evidence for a presumed "human influence" is spurious and based mostly on the selective use of data and choice of particular time periods. Phrases that stress the uncertainties of identifying human influences were edited out of the approved final draft before the IPCC report was printed in May 1996.    A further misrepresentation occurred in July 1996 when politicians, intent on establishing a Kyoto-like regime of mandatory emission controls, took the deceptively worded phrase about "discernible human influence" and linked it to a catastrophic future warmingsomething the IPCC report itself specifically denies. The IPCC presents no evidence to support a substantial warmin

The AF is considered softer then the Army, basic is shorter and the focus on physical fitness is not as high.  The quality of life is the highest out of all the branches.  The food is great, you live in a dorm not a barracks and each base has a golf course.  The jobs are usually more compatible to civilian jobs if you where looking to get out after your first tour.    It really depends on what kind of job you want also...if you want to go running and gunning and see action then you would have a better chance in the Army.  The AF has a few jobs where you could get in the middle of the fight but all but two are special forces and wash out is high.    Either way if you join you need to go to school and get a degree, yes school sucks and you'd rather be out getting laid.

I'm supposed to feel sorry for these people?    And who cares if their children were born here.. that doesn't make them citizens. If anything needs to change it's that.     You don't think that one of the reasons the economy is the way it is because a good part of the labor jobs that are filled by illegals are sending all off my money back to their families in mexico? Or coming over here, getting pregnant, getting a social security card since apparently 2 illegals make a citizen then getting on public assistance which by the way, I PAY FOR!!!     Then to pour salt in the wound, they get to go to college...FOR FREE!!! AND I CAN'T AFFORD TO PUT MYSELF THROUGH BECAUSE I'M TOO BUSY PAYING EVERYONE ELSE'S WAY!!!

The minimum wage is not really worth getting out of bed for, but an illegal immigrant will not shout too loudly because he would be deported so with a little bit of cohesion they will get away with it or when in power just not increase the minimum wage.

bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	Pornography is not necessarily only people having sex. What some consider porn others consider art. It is not illegal to have porn. Only to sell. Child porn is illegal in all states to possess and sell.     Non-obscene pornography is protected by the First Amendment.|`|QIQNzE11aa	If we make illegal all things that are addictive... many things would have to go. Like caffeine, alcohol, sleep aids, sugar, junk foods.     Prostitution shouldn't be illegal when it's sex between two consenting adults. I have known friends who marry for money. Every time they have sex it's for the money they live with. Is that no prostitution? How is that legal? Is it legal for a girlfriend and a boyfriend to have sex if he ever paid for anything?     Pornography is an unhealthy problem within our society. Making it illegal will not make it go away. I once read that child pornography is on the rise. Yet that's illegal with true jail time attached to it!     Illegal drugs can be found on any street in any city across this country. I can more easily get my hands on illegal drugs than i can certain sinus tabs!     Making illegal does little and the country makes money off of the taxes from pornography. Think how much money this country would have if illegal drugs became legal and one could charge taxes on them! Not that i am advocating the selling of drugs, but how fun would they seem if they could walk into a store and get it? It's the shock factor and the illegal part that makes so many want to do those things.     Those countries where prostitution is legal keep std's down by making the women be checked out so often and regulating it so much. They also make great revenue off of prostitutes. As long as a person will pay fo sex, someone will give them sex to collect the pay. You'll never stop it.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	I see a lot of porn that doesn't have an sex in it at all - where are you looking?    Maybe you should simply read the First Amendment and try wikipedia as a start for learning the long sordid history of people trying to undermine it in this area.

In Saudi Arabia, Time Magazine is pornographic because it shows women with  exposed calves!  And engaging in pornographic acts, such as holding a man's hand in public, especially often a man not her husband!    How do you define pornography that all people can accept?  The guy may have had a point when he said, "I can't define pornography, but I know it when I see it."  But somehow, you just can't get a legal description out of that sentiment.    Showing sexual acts?  Then a lot of medical literature will be illegal.  Exceptions?  A law so riddled with exceptions will be the entire Library of Congress just to try describing all the porn that's not really porn.    Addictive?  That's a cop-out.  Certain substances create uniformly physical reactions when withheld, but obscure mental incapacitation due to a 'porno fix' doesn't fit the medical description.  And many things destroy families and relationships wtihout being illegal for it.  Otherwise, stinking up the family bathroom would be a jailable offense.|`|vOukAHowaa	Yes it should be.It is just not necessary.BUT it never will be illegal in my opinion.I think its sickning etc. And ppl getting paid for sex will never stop either- The world is going to hell and its sad- MY ex sister in law is a Prostitue b/c she is addicted to drugs and has no money usually so she{As she puts it} "Takes it out in trade" She has two kids that are 17 and 21 and of course that pig dont have them NEVER did- my 60 old rents have had them since they were BABIES.And you hit the nail on the head- That stuff truly does destroy lives- i know all too well|`|sVyH0jTiaa	Yes , I think they should put pornography become against the law.  Because porno movies cause lot of trouble.   Some people couldn't quit watching because they are addict to it.  If you thinking about sex all the time your mind will never go away it will go in your head forever.  Now , let me tell you this one and it is really make sense.  Long time ago I caught 15 years old white boy beat up black man. So , I have to go over there and try to stop him beating him up.  So, later he and I have a good talk .  I ask him if he was prejudice or what?  He didn't give me the right answer.  But later finally he told me why.  It is has to do with porno movies.  Because it has something to do with phallus sizes.  I try so hard to explain to him it is myth; they want you to believe it but it is no use! Because it goes in his mind forever.  That where I starting to against porno.  So now I know where all the hates come from.  I wish I can explain more but it will take forever to explain it.  This is short answer for you.  If you really do understand then you understand me.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	No.  Prostitution should be legalized.   Americans already pay money to companies and institutions that screw us over.  We may as well have one where we will enjoy the screwing over part.    Pornography is only addictive to weak-minded individuals.  I'm against banning things for everyone when they are only causing problems for a small portion of the population.  This is why I think prostitution and recreational drugs should be legalized.  Some people are more than capable to responsibly use these vices in moderation.

You CAN sign up your kids up for German schools, but unless they are very young (5-6, when kids pick up languages quickly) it will be difficult for them.    A four bedroom house on the economy will be VERY difficult to find close by-maybe out by Kindsbach, or Hochspeyer; even then it's going to cost you.  Where you live will depend on much support you'll need: if you or your spouse speak good/fluent German you can live almost anywhere-otherwise you'll want to be within maybe 20km of the base/Vogelweh.  Most base housing is apartment blocks.

a5efe275182115a58cc24e44f27eae2baa	I'm a law student in Ontario who's worked on purchase and sales of professional corporations.    There is no law prohibiting you from keeping some or all of your files if you sell the corporation to another doctor, but some of the value of the corporation is in the patient roster...(this is an issue with dentists at least... I don't know how much it is for doctors with all the shortages).    Most of the purchase contracts have a non-compete arrangement or penalties for taking clients with you, but if you both know what you are getting into and have agreed on the terms, it should be no problem. Then be sure to inform you lawyers as they work on the purchase agreement.    ..Actually, if there are other doctors in your corporation there might be a bit of a fuss about you taking files with you.  Afraid that's what you pay the real lawyer for.

There are plenty of British people in Europe working for less than the local labour, yet the moment someone cheaper comes here everyone's all up in arms about it. We live in a capitalist society, where competition is key. If you're not willing to work for the cheaper wages of others, well, it should be no surprise when people from abroad are taking your jobs. Stop expecting so much, especially in a recession. If people were willing to take a bit of a pay cut, maybe they would have got those jobs at Total, rather than them being given to the Italians (who are earning British minimum wage, so it's not like it's a ridiculously low amount of money).|`|5CI2YHoqaa	Not only has Labour stole our national identity we now have to move out of our country to support ourselves.

7V79OMMHaa	Well, there are plenty of African Americans that have taken advantage of equal opportunities. But the those who haven't are those who still struggle because of the way they were raised.    Look at it like this. Let's say because my great grandmother didn't have the opportunity to go to school (college), she raised her child to be satisfied with only getting a high school education. That mentality that if you just get a high school education or GED is fine, spread through a few generations and as a result there are still not as many african americans that go to college as there are whites. This also explains why black men are known for not sticking with their children. The women chose to have a child with a man before knowing if they are willing to raise their child. As a result, the child is raised with no father and consequently feels as though it is ok to not want to raise your child.    Anyway, we as african americans are still progressing, and we have to get to the point where we raise out children to do something more than just graduate high school. A lot of the time white people motivate their children to go to school after they graduate, the same can not always be said for african american though, and that is my point.      Stay Cool|`|h9PVRHPWaa	Well you seem to be forgetting the first slaves in north america. The American indians.

082vOBNKaa	Skill Level 1 is E1/PVT through E4/SPC  Skill Level 2 is SGT/E5  SKill Level 3 is SSG/E6  Skill Level 4 is SFC/E7  Skill Level 5 is MSG/1SG/E8    To get to Skill Level 2 takes between 2-6 years, I'm not sure about 11B as I am not an Infantryman.    Basically it means that as a Skill Level 3/ SSG you are required to know, be able to perform, and teach all the Skills at your level and below. And as a good proactive Soldier you should have a solid grip on the skills of at least your next higher rank.    As far as getting promoted you'll figure it quickly. Do your job, what you're told, perform your tasks satisfactorily and to or above standard, be in the right place at the right time in the right uniform, good weapons qual/PT scores, be dependable, be ontime, etc etc etc That'll get you to SPC/E4 no problem. And by then you should def know how to be a NCO.    EDIT: a PT test for the Army consists of 2 min of push ups, 2 min of sit ups, and a 2 mile run. You get assigned a score based on how many you do, how old you are, and which gender. You also must meet height and weight standards. See the below link for an idea. The higher the score the better. http://www.apft-standards.com/|`|AA11313983	Skill level 2 is SGT.

AA10301974	CNN is owned by conservatives. It's news is a little to the left of conservatives and a little to the right of liberals.     Right now what they are doing is interviewing the people who are talking the loudest. Those are the republicans who are demanding the entire stimulus plan be scrapped. Some of them don't even want a stimulus plan at all as the marketplace will eventually fix itself someday.     The democrats need to be a little louder and start defending themselves.|`|h9PVRHPWaa	CNN is more of a moderate channel than others. If you want just pro obama news watch MSNBC if you want anti obama stuff watch FOX NEWS.|`|AA11459642	nope, he and his new cabinet are doing it themselves.|`|CpTQagJOaa	can you explain to me how it Would work?|`|HQ4PsETWaa	They are actually trying to bash the republicans.  The people at CNN have orgasms every time they even think about Obama.  If they were trying to sabotage Obama they would have brought in all the economists that say it will not work.  It is over loaded with waste, less than 25 cents of every dollar actually goes to help the economy.|`|cbef2b80ad80c5adc11d61992ee6897daa	CNN is usually bias in favor of Obama.

Now is the time for criticism and debate.   The decisions our country faces are too important.   We can't get these things wrong.    Why does CNN attack Obama's plan?   If they are raising good points, then it's important to listen.   If they aren't raising valid concerns, then speak out and correct their errors.   However, don't expect people to sit quietly by while Obama rules.   That isn't going to help anyone.|`|D4GHgDl4aa	There is no defense for this plan . That's why no republicans voted for it. When the Clinton News Network seems to be against a democrat proposal, you know it's bad.|`|tPjR0SQJaa	So you are saying that we can not disagree with this pork bill?  Even Hillary Clinton said DESCENT is Patriotic!    We Americans are STRONG, SMART, and HARD WORKING people we don't just get in line and follow.

If your a leader, follow orders, do things higher up ranks tell you, you might get promoted to higher rank.|`|25Cu0kjFaa	For the first two promotions it's simply a matter of not screwing up and doing your job. You should make PFC (E-3) inside of two years. After that, promotions come based on ability and available slots.     When you reach the point of becoming a Non-Commissioned Officer, you will face a board of senior NCOs (usually your battalion First Sergeants and the Command Sergeant Major) who will grill you (over a slow fire with mesquite) on every aspect of your MOS and leadership abilities.    Good luck, and thanks for serving!|`|e6f57551a9fea96616d64364edaca81faa	You have to have time in each rank before you can advance. Education such as college credits helps. Also, doing well on PFT's. Also, there are correspondence courses that can be done. They are these online books and quizzes and it gets you points to help you advance in your career.|`|gdW8rZt8aa	I don't think you really can control that.  They do like to see you show leadership ability, if put in that position.   Best thing to do in basic and AIT is to keep your mouth shut and listen.  Your better off not being known.   My fiance got promoted to specialist 4 after AIT.  He started out as PFC because he had college.  Good Luck!|`|neJVRcNTaa	E-2 thru E-4 is automatic. In order to be promoted to E-5 and E-6 you must go in front of a "Board", in which you will be asked a series army related questions. You will be graded by this board in a points system the sum of this is then added to your PT points (this is different than your actual PT score), also added is your marksmanship points (how well you do at the M-16 or M-4 range), you can also receive points from corresponace courses, college credits, medals and awards.   E-7 thru E-9 is chosen by the DOD.

ebuxHnScaa	The courts will take into account the preferences of a child at any age, so long as either party elects to call that child as a witness. In the case you're talking about, apparently her mother did not elect to fight for custody.    If only one parent wants custody and the other party doesn't fight it, then that parent is going to win custody. (Why do you assume the mother even wanted custody? If she did, wouldn't she have called the child as a witness?) It's also possible the mother didn't have competent legal representation (or any legal representation) or elected not to call her child as witness to "keep them out of it".|`|6Gfz125Paa	They always take it into consideration.  That doesn't mean they have to listen.  The judge can overrule the child's will at any age (until 18, which is adulthood).    They usually don't "ask".  If the child has a preference, that parent's attorney should bring it up.

Socialism is a state where the government controls industry. Israel for example is a socialist state. This gets confused with the idea of social programs such as social security or welfare, which is not the same as socialism. FDR was probably one of the most socialist presidents we've had if socialism was put on a scale, but even if he succeeded in implementing all of his programs, we still wouldn't be living in a socialist country.    The reason why he didn't answer yes or no to that question is because such an answer would be meaningless without any context to put it in.    Oh, and at least that is better than Republicans who don't even know their history.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK0d8ENS_...|`|SYpVGGJTaa	Because most of them are new liberals because it's trendy. They don't have any real info or original ideas so they just say a lot about anything to make themselves seem like they know something. (Remember a few years ago when it seemed like half of the female celebs were suddenly lesbians? Same thing, as soon as the "liberals" realize that it's not so great they will fade into the background).|`|LFE0e8Qdaa	It's because it's too hard for them to understand or they understand it and the answer makes them look bad.|`|fsiJJkQHaa	Ok well, Liberals, are retarded, and dont no what they are talking about all they want is power so they can screw up a country and for everyone that lives in Canada watch this video, to see what I am talking about.    http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=p5hoSfvIFF...|`|TKbYavhzaa	No.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	And they are ALL liberals, right?|`|q3E1ouQvaa	Umm... maybe.|`|wtcAK31Paa	And just who do you think you are?

That's what it is by definition:  the taking of an innocent human life, and it is ALWAYS premeditated on the part of the mother and the doctor.    (You can call it "pro-choice" only when you start giving the baby a choice, too, seeing as how the baby is the most affected by the decision.)|`|SWkaGJpgaa	For the same reason the pro-choice side calls the pro-lifers "anti-choice".

Pro choice, although is not ideal it's better than the alternatives available today. Pro-lifers would rather have millions of babies being born into poverty and harsh lives with no social services available, than to responsibly terminate a pregnancy.

xtrdlyJHaa	It would scare me if he was in charge of coloring books.    The only hope our country has is his tendancy toward responding better to Congressional Republicans rather than Dems.    (Isn't it funny that, other than Gates, Judd Gregg stands out as the most qualified pick for the office for which he is nominated? Maybe because Obama didn't select him for competence, but rather for strategy?...this has Rahm written all over it.)    Since Krauthammer is against Gregg's acceptance of the Commerce Cabinet seat (and sees it for what it is; and since Dems and the Media are PRAISING Gregg for his competence...then why not include his ideas in your spending bill? He submitted them along the the Rep's) I say ...JUST SAY NO!     Don't let a Republican be held responsible when Obama fails!!! They just want a way to say, "Well, a Republican was Sec of Commerce...it wasn't us."      Just say no!!!    Write to Senator Judd Gregg at :  submit@issues2000.org    Let him know that he will be MORE respected if he does not give his Senate seat up to the Dems...they just want Rep fingerprints on the upcoming Depression since the House voted the Spending Bill down.|`|b0N9Oh3oaa	No, not after 8 years of Bush.

Nobody could have done it with out the other...  plus all of the other countries involved...  It was called a World War for a reason...    What really surprises me is to the extent  that you have allowed a Troll to control all  of your rantings...    One of the Biggest bottom lines is:  That with out the massive Industrial output  of the USA nobody would have won...Nobody.    Also the almost unlimited manpower resource  of the USA...  The British seem to have forgotten about  the contribution that their Commonwealth  Countries supplied..with out them they would  have never survived as long as they did...    You will also notice in History that it was  always the Commonwealth countries that  supplied the man power for any and mostly  all of the so called high risk British battles.  From Hong Kong to D day...    It was also Montgomery that devised  "Market Garden" against all of the   Allies saying no...Man what an EGO...  Thousands of US and Commonwealth   Forces died in that High Risk adventure...|`|QHu1JcJ1aa	Can you seriously read your own question and understand it? Seems you and your little Brit buddy at the bottom are just starting threads attacking US.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	OK....several questions here.    What battles did the US win in WWII?    Guadalcanal, Peleilu, Taraw, Saipan, Okinawa, Guam....any of those ring any bells?  Not many Brits or Russians there, right?    Second, what weapons did the US supply to the Russians whcih was not obsolete?    M-4 Sherman, a variety of half-tracks, the B-25 Mitchell.  Additionally, the P-39's and other "obsolete" aircraft supplied to the Soviets were put to very good use as ground attack aircraft, instead of their intended role as fighters.  In fact, by the middle of 1944, 15 percent of the Soviet Union's armored forces were of American manufacture, and 18 % of their airforce was, as well.  More significant even than the weapons and equipmentm however, was food supplies (spam, for example) sent to the Soviets.  Without which, their army might simply have starved out.    Now, America certainly did not win WWII on its own.  In Europe, the Anglo-American forces were tied together and carried out almost strictly joint operations from Operation Torch, forward.  Additionally, of course, the Soviet Union was the real deciding factor.  Neither the US nor the British, nor their combination with the Free Poles and Free French and Commonwealth forces can claim to have won the war.  The Soviets broke the Germans back.  But you, like a lot of Europeans, I think, tend to see the war as a strictly European affair, and that's just not accurate.  In the Pacific, the Americans fought the war pretty much on their own, and the British supplied a valuable sideline by fighting to build supply lines to China and defend them.  Britain won several battles in North Africa with minimal US involvement and fairly small amounts of US aid, and they won the Battle of Britain with only a few squadrons of American aircraft and only one squadron of American pilots.  But the truth is that neither the British nor the Americans could have won any battles without the other's manpower and involvement.    Churchill's salute to you, too!|`|ILYEAa9laa	all america provide in war is FRIENDLY FIRE|`|AA12019574	america won all the battles in ww2 if you want to believe what they say , they only came into the war because they were bombed at pearl harbour    they did not give anything to russia and they sold weapons to britain|`|gIqVnbn4aa	America's contribution to ww2 was extremely significant but other contributed as well in fact Britain made it possible for America to fight the germans by standing their ground in africa and the english channel making sure the US had bases from which to operate. Also Russia put an extreme amount of pressure on the German army drawing divisions away from US forces fighting in western europe essentially facilitating the liberation of France. However in the pacific theater of the war the US was the only major contributor to victory with the exceptionn of maybe Australia|`|wlqUMBZbaa	Where was the US Army on the Eastern Front exactly?    A couple of points though: America gave the Soviet Air Force the Bell P 39 Airacobra, which they used very effectively - obsolete or not,     They also "gave" them the boeing B-29 Superfortress, though not willingly - the Soviets capturing one that landed on USSR territory after an emergency landing - they swiftly reverse enginerred it (after the war) and mass Produced it as the Tupolev Tu-4 - one of these dropped the first air burst Russian Nuke.    When it comes to make do and mend, the Russians are peerless!

Pedophilia is a fetishistic sexual interest in children. You don't mention anything of the sort.    But, you do seem to have other issues in your own life that you are projecting onto these other kids rather then addressing.     You are not "stepping up for these boys", you are borderline stalking them. Their family ought to be getting proper counseling from therapists, and if they are going to be going to church in addition to that, then they should be getting pastoral care from those who are specially trained to handle such things. Not all churches have such a person, btw, even the Pastor himself.    The same goes for you - seek out professional guidance from a qualified counselor, and then if you want to complement that with qualified pastoral care, then go ahead and do that.    For all of you, the qualified therapist is the place to start - and not necessarily the same therapist for each of you. I am sure a trusted  adult at school can help you start down that path if you have no other way to get started. Money need not be an issue.    Good luck to all of you!|`|AA10223196	You should care about your life also.  If you love yourself, that love can be be shared with others.  If you do not care about your life, you can't possibly be of help to others.  You are not a pedophile.  That relates to sexual situations with kids.  Take a positive approach to your work also.  If it is a bad situation, perhaps you need a new job.  Work on your inner peace and happiness so it can be reflected on others.

M6n6VOFQaa	Prime ministers are heads of government, not heads of state. To my knowledge, there is no prime minister in any democracy who acts as the formal head of state. As your other question noted, elected heads of state (as opposed to kings, queens, or emperors) are usually titled "president."     The term prime minister, by the way, simply marks the PM as the prime (e.g., central or key) minister in the government. The government will have anywhere from a half-dozen to two dozen cabinet ministers, who oversee the various ministries/departments of a government.    If a country's government is parliamentary (where legislature & executive are fused together as a single branch, and the leadership of the executive branch are also members of the legislature), then its head of government is a prime minister. If a country's head of government is separately elected, and not a member of parliament, then it is a presidential or semi-presidential system, and the head of government will be a president. Any democratic country without a monarch is likely to have a president as head of state, but the president only has real power in presidential and semi-presidential systems of government, because he is only head (or co-head) of government in such systems.|`|VKrePQZqaa	Prime Minister seems to be the term for countries that use a Parliamentary System    President is the term used for democratic systems that are Republics

But to answer the question, click the link...|`|Oh9oFiriaa	just the opposite for me|`|988403b1973d9a49023322e7d2fa115daa	The rectum is of the utmost importance to aliens. Most people would think they would be concerned with looking for life on other planets or answering the universal question, what is the meaning of life. However, the biggest conundrum and mystery to many aliens is rectal. For some people this may be problematic. However, others may find it a break to their monotonous lives. The next time this happens, make sure you have a cucumber or a carrot and some lubricant on your person to help the next encounter to be a less close one.|`|coYARP3aaa	It happens to the best of us. Oh - and the aliens are gay.|`|QC94IKIxaa	They always ask me to take them to our leader.|`|FX4WhQtKaa	they were neglected as children, and ae looking for special attention as adult aliens|`|AA11593971	Were the aliens Mexican proctologists?|`|3TjiJls7aa	It's against the aliens customs to probe each other or themselves.  Because of this they traveled across the galaxy to find other beings with similar anuses and opposable thumbs.  While their society looks down on the probing, if it is done by another life form, it's not as bad.  You are lucky to act as a galactical ambassador...I wish I could be so lucky!|`|004191770d52d2dff11de585b12631dcaa	kinky sods!!|`|uSkNn9YFaa	maybe they want you to tell people that its much better to be an earth citizen..|`|y5i8GIFWaa	WAT!

5Ho518J9aa	Hey Cat.  These ramifications are as follows, in order:  1. Devaluation of American Currency. This means that not only will our dollar be worth less, but almost always employers are slow to make the changes necessary in payroll obligations. Therefore, panic erupts and starvation ensues, thereby creating an Economic Emergency.    2. America's Credit Rating is downgraded. This means that all of the foreign interests who hold our debt (in the form of securities and Treasury Notes) cannot recieve repayment within the time agreed to at the time of purchase. This is the same, no matter whether you're a household or a Nation, it makes no difference.    3. The Treasury (as you stated) needs to loan the money to the treasury once again, just like in the TARP plan. This will send the value of the dollar down into a spiral, and cause rapid and extreme overcorrections in inflation. Much like when you swerve to miss a deer in your car, the result is worse than if you hit the deer head on.     4. The Federal Government goes insolvent. When the currency is worthless, and an Emergency ensues, the Federal government will declare a state of Martial Law, due to the fact (yeah right) that State and Local agencies cannot maintain law and order or feed the populace. It is at times like this that factions lying in wait for such an opportunity (or who made it occur in the first place) to take power in a coup, because the People cannot defend against it in such a weakened state.    5. We The People. This is the time when the populace at large regains control of its own Country, relying on stored food, arms, and medical supplies kept in the home incase of a disaster or extended emergency. I highly suggest going to Wal Mart and buying rice and beans, Ramen Noodle 12 pks, .22LR rounds, a battery or crank am radio and a camp stove. Anything else you can get is gravy. Think like a pioneer. 6 mos. without electricity, gas, fuel oil or municipal water and sewer. If I were living in a city, I would leave for the duration NOW. If there's something you need, get it on the way to the woods. Deep woods. Not a camping area.|`|SlhuFfuZaa	I read someplace the other day that there are only three countries that can afford to buy our debts at this time, China, Japan and India.  If they refuse of can't buy our debt, the Government defaults and is out of business, bankrupt. At that time either the Federal Reserve or a country or countries that have bought our past debts will take over, there by ending the United States as we know it. They, the new owner of the country can then do what ever they want.  The presumed idea, if China takes over is to set the U.S. up as a mostly agricultural system, with some mining of natural resources. Most people will be put to growing food or the packaging of that food. Others will become miners and oil drillers. We will be tested to see what we have a natural ability for and that is your job for life.    Be afraid, Very Afraid!|`|wVik8Fo7aa	An economic crisis millions (or trillions) times worse than the Great Depression.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Good question considering treasuries pay around 0% now.

Money they print up in the basement? If the Fed Reserve is so flush with money already in their possession, why has our government had to borrow from China in the first place? This is just more double speak....and that sort of thing is exactly what put us in this situation in the first place.    If China or some other country is unwilling or unable to fund us, you can expect hyper inflation to occur rapidly.|`|fDuCamMraa	Ever heard of Bernie Madhoff?  Same principle. It should be called child abuse. It is destroying the ability of future generations to have a decent standard of living. Unfortunately, a course in basic economics is not a prerequisite for being a politician and going to Washington.|`|3caq6SFxaa	They would not do that because financially they are too dependent on us; they don't finance we don't import their goods and they are in as bad shape as we would be  The problem with any country trying that at this point in time is inter-dependence; without our market they have no reason to manufacture and we need their financing to buy the goods.  This is what the founding fathers were concerned about with the many warnings about foreign alliances and that can easily be a treaty between countries or the financial situation.  If they did it would cause a world wide depression as stated worse then the 1930's and the way to get out of a depression of that magnitude and with that unemployment is simply put to go to war.|`|4ojHnyZkaa	Immigration stops! Down side None! Catastrophe is inspiring. Your questions bring out the best in answers. Thanks
AA10079277	I think the question makes no sense, because she already is the Secretary for Homeland Security.    Weird how you knew enough to know her name, and her position, but not enough to know she's already in that role.|`|eulMjLtPaa	No, not a nominee, since she took on the role as Secretary of Homeland Security on January 21.|`|aV3bFchtaa	Janet Napolitano was sworn in on January 21, 2009 as the third Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security|`|BRyRtQSvaa	God I hope not, wht a moron she is!

Surely a medical waiver would be issued.|`|rHwE5Rkbaa	If not continually treated, it can end up being significantly more serious.  Without treatment, you can end up with serious infections and more significant problems like sepsis...  And on the battlefield, there is no guarantee that everyone can get regular medications.    A person with eczema is a serious drain on manpower and resources.  The military needs people that we can count on to be there in all conditions - and a person with eczema is already a known drain on readiness.  Sorry.
TFdKrkP2aa	They are scrambling for any crumbs that Democrats might leave on the floor.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Why do you believe this stuff?    Did it ever occur to you that, with democrats in charge of the Senate, republicans don't have the requisite power to pass laws, much less mount any kind of "sweeping drive" to do anything?    With what?  Operatives spreading tracks on the streets of Chicago and LA?    (Do liberals have any control over how stupid their conspiracy theories are?)|`|AA10079277	One of the reasons the republicans have been loosing is because they've been acting like democrats for the past several years.  So for the past several years, everything has been voted on in a liberal/democrat way.  And look where it's gotten us.|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	I saw that too and it didn't surprise me. Smart Republicans know the government must be involved in any plan to save the economy. What does surprise me is the fact that Republicans lobbied intensely against Obama's plan, then came up with their own plan that is very similar.    I didn't think the Republicans were being obstructionist before. But now it appears they were playing partisan politics just so they could look good.    And to liberalAK - We believe it because it's reality - something the GOP hasn't dealt with in a long time.
c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Yes, you make perfect sense, and it's a very pertinent question.  Basically the Marines have the toughest Basic Training of any service.  Every Marine is trained to be a rifleman first, then a specialist.  However, don't let Basic determine your career choice it's 14wks out of your whole life.  It really depends on:  - What you wish to do, the Army since it's larger has many more opportunities in fields like comm/computers, admin, intel, etc.  - How much/where you wish to travel:  The Army has more bases overseas than the Marines-again simply because they are larger  - How much determination you have.  I would not recommend going to the Marines unless you REALLY wish to become one.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	Which is better?  Most of us Army vets will say the Army of course.  And the Marines here will say the MArines of course!  :-)    Really it's up to you, the Army has more jobs to chose from.    Whatever you decide I wish you the best!|`|AA11622716	I don't know what you consider to be "better" and I don't know what you are looking for.  You want more places to be stationed, go with the army.  You want more intensive combat training, go with the marines.  Want to be a medic, go with the army because the marines do not have any (they have navy corpsmen).  Want to get stationed on a ship, go with the corps.  Want to be part of a big outfit, choose the army.|`|wSq80V1xaa	Marines: Tougher training, more Gung Ho, ect.  Army: Same as Marines except not as gung ho, and not as difficult.|`|q3E1ouQvaa	Better in what way?    [edit] Each of the services has something about them that is a bit better than others.    PS: Re: The movie "Zeitgeist". I have seen it and I think it is a tin foil hat conspiracy theory.    "These are surreal perversions of genuine issues and debates, and they tarnish all criticism of faith, the Bush administration and globalisation - there are more than enough factual injustices in this world to be going around without having to invent fictional ones.

But I can say this: In the Army, I got great training, bettered myself, saved a couple lives, (I was a medic), and met the finest people I have ever known. Before or since. True heroes, many of them.  I'm sure a Marine would tell you much the same.   Either way, you can't lose.   Good Luck whichever way you choose!|`|f153f5c587854a64f0b19f95ee388282aa	I personally enjoy this link:    http://buzzcut23.blogspot.com/2009/01/wh...    It was originally posted by Lava Dog on here.|`|gIqVnbn4aa	When picking a service to join you should not consider which service is toughest or most famous, instead you should consider which service is right for you personally. If you want to feel like you are in the military but not have go through extremely brutal types of training then maybe the army is for you. If you want to see the world then the navy may be for you. If you like planes then the air force is for you. If your a really hard core individual maybe the marines are for you.|`|m13CCGc1aa	Air Force.|`|s7njWYEkaa	Navy|`|sfCnE2O4aa	Jenny, darling, please watch this movie and think about the message so that you may best understand WHY the Military is even in existence.    The first 24 minutes of the movie details the money system, Fractional Reserve banking, and then the movie goes on to explain about the "War on Terror" and the way things have always been and the way they could be in the not so distant future.    I beg of you to PLEASE take the time to evaluate the message of this movie.  There are facts presented that will truly enlighten you and place you so very far ahead of so many people.  You will understand things that most people could only hope to dream they might one day understand.    http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/    Watch the Addendum version first.  I am confident that once you make yourself look at "the other side" of the arguments for and against wars and greed, you will find that you are so very intelligent and you will then be able to help your entire nation and this entire planet be a terror-free place for us all to live.    If you will do this for yourself, you will end up helping to put a stop to TERRORRISTS once and for all.    I am proud of your desire to serve your country and this world.  And with the information provided in this video I've sent you, you will be so much better prepared to help mankind than you could ever have dreamed possible.  Please watch the movie.    Good luck sweety.|`|raImBqwraa	Here's one of the few times you'll hear me say Army. 2 reasons...    1) If you are undecided, than you don't want to be a Marine. Marines want to be Marines and belong to the Corps alone.    2) I've met very few Marine women (Bag Nasties :) ) that I like. But there's plenty of Army ladies out there I get along well with ;)|`|IMmHR6CPaa	I am just like you I am 13 and in 7th grade And I really want to join the army. The best Advise I can give is to go om www.goarmy.com and take a job career test and get the best category's and then go to job search and pick the job category and search jobs and to warn you there are not very many jobs open to women. Search around the web site I gave you. that's what is helping me make the dissuasion easier.I am going to join the army to help you a little more, I have researched it all.
AA12212403	I think it's a coincidence, but it sucks.  I'm in my 50s and we lost about 20K from our savings.  We're trying to put two kids through college as well right now.  Times are tough for us.  It was supposed to be a time where we could finally move now that the youngest is out of high school and we are not tied to a school system, but we just can't.  We lost so much that the moving costs and closing costs are just not there for use.  So, yeah, it totally sucks.|`|YbXSNgUOaa	Stress kills. The government wants to kill all us older farts.|`|VgPG5WMsaa	Good observation! Baby boomers in general were big on credit. Credit was so easy over the last decade. It seemed to reach a climax in 07. The problem now is there is no one left to lend to. Most people have maxed their credit. Ad to this an aging baby boom population with a diminishing desire for consumption and you have a long term slow growth economy.
UAW6fd4baa	The truth is the first casualty of war.|`|SsB7aRExaa	It's "due respect".    There is no evidence that the casualty rate is being reported incorrectly.  There are so many reporters in Iraq it would be pretty close to impossible to fudge the numbers.|`|7qxqkjNhaa	The fact is the casualty rates are 100% fact and accurate. How do you hide the numbers of dead and wounded from the parents or the liberal press. The press is all over the place and even a liberal press can do simple math.|`|iHpknoLwaa	No.  With today's media technology, it would be impossible for the government to cover up casualty statistics.  In fact, many times the media, or the family, will find out about casualties before the military even has time to notify the next of kin.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	No cover up on the numbers but they still are not permitted to show the bodies coming back.|`|4VzVfKvdaa	The casualty rate is tiny compared to the number of troops killed in other conflicts. There were more killed during the invasion of Normandy in one day than have been killed in both Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001.    BTW..25% percent of those killed were due to accidents..mostly vehicle (folks still won't wear their seat belts); not due to enemy action.|`|AA11401709	I don't think the government can cover up with all the technology. Yet, there is a percentage of censorship in everything around us. I do agree with the gentleman who mentioned that families and media know about a fallen soldier (in Iraq) before the army can notify the family. That's why they used to shut down the internet cafe in front of all of us until they notify the family.|`|6CfYiabAaa	I dont think they could cover it up. I do know that soldiers are dying over-seas from non-combat related injuries and not being reported. Like the people who are building the barracks. A lot of soldiers have been electrocuted taking a shower from improper wiring. I heard it a few years back and ironically saw it on yahoo news a few weeks ago.

Still a pretty long way from being a millionaire.  And the typical behavior of people in a recession is to save money - not to spend it which is what we need to reinvigorate the economy.  So in short - no.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	That would be about 2300 each.|`|YbXSNgUOaa	I had rather see the government take all money, land, wealth,etc.(personal) from the wall street bankers, oil company executives, lobbyist, the big three, and give to the homeless, and the American Indians.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	dream on, maybe it will happen.|`|GEnKe7UBaa	NO...even if you "say per family", you are STILL not in the "million category"...there are approximately 112 MILLION households in the U.S., if you do the MATH...obviously not your strong point...it only works out to $6250 per "family" or household.     Any way you try to break it down, or try to "think outside the box", NO ONE is going to become a "millionaire" if you divide it 700 billion dollars among the ENTIRE population of the U.S.    HINT: If you divided hundreds of BILLIONS of anything by hundreds of MILLIONS of anything, you only come up with THOUSANDS...NOT MILLIONS!!!!     Period. End of story.|`|1hOTlMvaaa	Would be great if they just gave out the loans for repayment with that money instead.A win win for the people and the govt making minimal interest, say like under 10%.!

If someone stole the car and damages it or your mother has actual out-of-pocket expenses because of the theft (i.e. car rental, taxi, etc.), then your mom could sue to recover her out-of-pocket expenses.    But, could she just sue because someone stole the car?  No.  She wouldn't get any money.

Unfortunately, the Republican Party has failed us and is in need of CHANGE.    www.lp.org  www.constitutionparty.com|`|FY17j1Ajaa	Not at all. One can be a Republican but not a conservative, just as one can be a Democrat and not a liberal. There are people in the political center, but the stinking media doesn't pay much attention to it.|`|UxdjYFJaaa	Not anymore.    The GOP used to stand for certain things, like fiscal responsibility and the government staying out of people's lives.     Now its turned into this political party who starts illegal wars and wants to break down the barriers between church and state and allow the government to meddle in the bedrooms of Americans.    I find it hard to see eye to eye with any of the wackos who have hijacked the GOP anymore. And I doubt very highly I'm alone.|`|u23sBafTaa	NO not by a long shot.

You can be either socially or fiscally conservative and be a Democrat.

I'm a democrat, but I'm conservative about a couple of things (Like abstinence, no non- pharmaceutical -or -caffiene drug use, etc.) since I'm Catholic.

N7AzaX62aa	One of the most dreaded physical experiences at USMC boot camp is the gas chamber. Three weeks into training, recruits begin weapons and field training instruction. During this part of training, recruits are exposed to a variety of simulated battlefield environments, including an encounter with CS gas (a common riot control agent).    Following a lecture on the proper use of gas mask equipment, recruits are taken to a specially constructed gas chamber for a live-fire demonstration. With gas masks on, recruits are ordered into the gas chamber for a 3-5 minute "gas attack." Slowly, CS gas is released into the sealed room. On signal, recruits are ordered to remove their gas masks and breath in a little of the gas. Almost immediately, everyone's eyes begin to water and the first sounds of uncontrollable coughing fill the room. Just as panic sets in, recruits are ordered to put their masks back on to clear for the next part of the demonstration.    Now standing in a completely smoke filled chamber, recruits are again ordered break the seal on their masks, and place the apparatus on top their heads. For the second time, recruits are exposed to the nausea inducing vapor of the CS gas. As eyes completely fill with tears, and the sounds of convulsive coughing fill the entire room, the order again is given to don masks and clear for the third and final phase of the exercise.    Now feeling like their lungs are on fire, blinded by tears, and suffering from gas induced skin burn (very much like a sunburn), recruits are ordered one more time to remove their masks and hold them at arms length in front of them. With a new found confidence in the ability of their masks to protect them from the gas, recruits quickly comply in the hopes of speeding up the order to don their masks again. As the order to is given, recruits waste no time retreating to the relative safety of their equipment.    Upon completion of phase three, recruits file out of the gas chamber with a new found confidence in the ability of their gas mask to protect them under battlefield conditions.    This is one of many physical challenges you can expect at USMC boot camp.    For more information, I found this website - http://bit.ly/zomc - to be a wealth of information on ways to prepare for boot camp.|`|dSbAz63baa	I think it's a cake walk compared to Special Forces. To complete marine boot camp you run 3 miles. Rangers run 12 miles, take a 30 second water break, add 60 more lb's ruck sack and hike 10 miles : ) This is only a normal day.|`|vKxt1i0Faa	Nothing comes to mind.

You hate life about that time.|`|T0wPBwGFaa	Ranger doggy,, the question was about boot camp,, you know that time when you and the girls had to wake up before dawn and march to the chow hall.    To answer the question the gas chamber was hard in boot camp,, later I used it to clear my sinus|`|gDSJpRvTaa	The "Hardest Part Of Boot-Camp" that  I came across was trying to Graduate out of it...    You will be surprised at what you can do.  Always remember that they are trying to  make you crack...it is better for you to  crack in "Boot-Camp" then in Combat.    A lot of the physical has to do with  your mental abilities...  If you say you can't do something...  Then you won't do it, and you lose forever.    Semper Fi !!!!|`|raImBqwraa	You won't sleep the first week (Not receiving, the first actual week), so towards the end, getting out of the rack and putting your boots on is a physically challenging activity.    Then there's always the humps, (Was the 20k in bootcamp or SOI? I don't remember anymore) and of course, the crucible is just a big love-in.|`|OBnNGcfHaa	OK  this is for Rangers up there with is all we are special forces.    1st you have never been to Marine Corps boot camp.    2nd I just watch a special on The Army Rangers on the Military channel. You guys are given 5 hours to run 12 miles and hump 10miles on flat ground. (Yeah try lying they showed it on T.V) Ok I could Run 12 miles hump 10 and still have time to F$%  your mom and take a short nap in 5 hours.    3rd if you guys are soooooooooooo freaken awesome I would like to know how the F you messed up Somalia in 1993. Mkay they even made a movie about it, it was so bad. but let me remind you how steller you guy where in case you forgot.    In a raid, a task force of Delta Force soldiers, ARMY RANGERS, and Special Operations Aviation Regiment ATTEMPT capturing two of Mohammed Farah Aidid's senior subordinates in the Bakaara Market neighborhood of Mogadishu. The mission is led by Major General William F. Garrison AND WAS SUPPOSED  TO TAKE NO MORE THEN ONE HOUR. The extraction by the Delta team  was successful, but the Somali militia, armed with RPGs, shot down two Black Hawk helicopters, and the resulting rescue extends the mission to OVER 15 HOURS.       RANGER Chalk Four, has our  first injury, as PFC Todd Blackburn falls from a helicopter as it maneuvers to avoid an RPG. This is the beginning of the indication that the troops are overwhelmed by the volume of enemy militia.      Two Chalk Four machine gunners who are supposed to return with the extraction team, but miss the humvees as they leave, and GET LOST. One of them is deafened by machine-gun fire, but they eventually make their way back to Eversmann. Cpl Jamie Smith attempts to rescue one of them, whose ammo bag was shot and exploded, but Smith gets shot too, and eventually bleeds to death.      In the end the UN Had to Bail out the Super awesome RANGERS and when it was all said and done 16 ARMY RANGERS WHERE KIA.    You're you guys are sweet when can I join!

If you think the kid is being neglected or abused, you should report it, but if all you know is that the kid is home alone, it's not really your business.

fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	In some cases you can do it, in other cases you cannot    China is not likely to accept anyone- they are a communist dictatorship and allowing a "suspect" foreigner into the army would be a very strange thing indeed. Much more likely to cause a swift execution- just in case...    Israel takes immigrant Jews into the army- same as all Israelis. So there the condition would be immigration/ naturalisation     The French Foreign Legion takes volunteers from all over the world. They actually take one out of 10-12 applicants. Whoever passes the entry tests has to learn French (easy enough with 24/7 tuition)  Such a soldier can become a Sergeant (maximum rank) and obtain French citizenship in 5 years of service    The US army takes foreign volunteers- plenty of soldiers (eg. in Iraq, Afghanistan) who obtain their citizenship while they serve    Very few countries will allow foreigners into the armed forces. However many will allow immigrants who apply for citizenship to join the army.    In the European Union it is now possible to join the army of a member state. Recently the Irish army was looking for medical doctors- and people from other EU countries could apply. So becoming a junior officer in a specialised, non combat branch is OK, but not in a fighting unit    The British Army has foreign units- the Ghurka battalions (who are Nepalese citizens). In Ww2 they accepted foreigners as volunteers (eg US citizens) or as whole units (Polish pilots, Free French, etc)    It used to be posible to join the armed forces as a corsair (a kind of licensed pirate). In this way a private ship (privateer) would form part of a navy of a country which had not enough ships of its own. The legal document was the "Lettre de Marque"- in tis way a foreign ship and crew became "national sailors" for the duration of the conflict.    Most countries have their own laws. My guess  is that it would depend how desperate they were (situation on the front).|`|2zhQznahaa	The Chilean army, so people heard through the grapevine in the 80's and 90s took foreigners to teach for them, and I dont know the rest, but also the French Foreign Legion takes people.  And you can switch from Canada to Britain, or any commonwealth country.  Its just being a mercenary.  But, it is often done.  LIke in a book, by WEB Griffin, a US airforce colonel switches over to the Chinese Airforce (circa WW2), and is a general or colonel for them.  His name was Wild Bill, and its fictional, but i think it might have been stolen from real life.|`|AA11828439	It is possible.

AA11553969	I recommend you call the district attorney's office or the county solicitor's office in the jurisdiction that the crime took place in.

Even Northerners could, for the most part, care less.  Jefferson even had children by one slave, Sally Hemmings.  I believe this has been confirmed by DNA from Jefferson and Hemming's descendents.
60YMS1xkaa	Yes, they are. For some reason people associate brown with Muslim :S. Women who wear Hijabs have it really hard. There's plenty of secret videos taken showing how they're treated as customers. I'll get you a link to this a good one. The cashier is actually a actor and he doesn't let a Muslim woman buy anything; amazingly, people agreed with him and gave him the thumbs up. Though, others were simply disgusted (thank the lord).    I suppose that's just what happens when you're at war with two Muslim countries. I wasn't born then, but I'm pretty sure Vietnamese were discriminated against during the Vietnam War, and Russians during the Cold War. It comes down to ignorance. You have to differentiate between what is their religion and what is their culture. Honour killings are not their religion. The Qu'ran is against suicide, etc. Morons go online and look up verses from the Qu'ran - they're all fake! Only 15% of the world's Muslims live in the Middle East. Smarter people would realize that the extremists and terrorists we are fighting are in minority. Which is good for us - over 1 billion of them could easily take us down if they wanted.     As for the claims that you would be discriminated in a Muslim country; not really. I've travelled to Egypt and Lebanon with my parents and had the time of my life! Most of them are fascinated by foreigners and are very warm and welcoming. It's just their culture.    ~ They're discriminated, although not as much, in Canada too. And in BR.~|`|f9crUDTwaa	Everyone faces discrimination in America ... Including white people .|`|c2hfVjxgaa	Their religion is incompatible with our way of life.  It's hard to trust that kind of thinking.  Look what has happened to France and England after they let too many Muslims in.  Sorry but it is the truth.|`|I6D7xdcVaa	Yes but its the people not the government who display the hatred. Go to any Western Country and you will find the same sentiment.|`|3pK4Gn6Kaa	They face what they face not because of their religion but because they slaughter innocents in the name of their religion.     The world has underestimated the value of muslims--target practice.|`|aQ8utQOeaa	Some people discriminate against other groups or types of people.  Because of prejudice ways people are not truly equal.|`|026b1934d4ff58e232cc4b419808adc4aa	I live in NYC, which is very tolerant. Even here, I think it is at the very least in the back of people's mind that Islam = Terrorism. I know that not to be the case and by and large most Muslims in NYC are extremely hard working dedicated family people. However, there is ignorance everywhere. The difference here as opposed to other nations is that hate crimes in NYC are investigated thoroughly and prosecuted. Prejudice exists, but as long as anti discrimination laws and hate crimes laws are taken seriously, there should not be serious problems.    Remember, after 9/11, there was not an outbreak of hate crimes throughout the nation. Mosques weren't burnt down and people did not boycott Muslim owned businesses. I say that as a country we are fairly far ahead in our thinking.|`|BXbnLxNJaa	maybe  theyd be accepted if they didnt protest christmas, seriously.|`|FDEuHT7jaa	They oppress their women more than Hitler oppressed Jews|`|m3jb9qjdaa	If you lived in a Muslim country, do you think you would face discrimination?    Compare how they are (supposedly) discriminated against in the US to how an American would be discriminated against in a Muslim nation.|`|cr6AQ5aTaa	Absolutely.  it is horrible how they are looked at and treated, look at the evidence.  After 9/11 gas stations were vandilized just because the ethnicity of the people working there.  And even though Obama is a christain, people called him muslim as an insult.  Even if he was calling someone a religion as an insult is discrimination.|`|083d6fafca78da36d20de847faf89803aa	It is an interesting question.  I believe it is possible that fundamentalist followers of the Islamic faith would be the target of discrimination.  Much in the same way that fundamentalist Jews, and Catholics (until 1960s) are discriminated against in society.|`|4fqaQRnIaa	No kidding!    There`s a kind og madness about Americans.|`|a243bdff28f8938b1553bc0befe479d8aa	yes|`|teKeLxX2aa	To some extent, every wave of immigrants that has ever migrated to America has faced a decent level of discrimination and prejudice until American society accepted them. Back during the first and second migration waves from Europe, people of Irish and Italian descent were looked down on as unequals, even though today it would be very uncommon for a white person to call out another white person based upon the country their ancestors came from.    9/11 definitely didn't help out people of Middle Eastern descent in the slightest bit. There have been Muslims living in America longer than white people, who still face prejudice because of what has happened over the last decade. People in general don't like those who are different from themselves, and any reason to incite discrimination among the masses is usually taken in stride. For all the hate that the Germans had for the Jews during the reign of the Nazi's, both of them were white people who spoke the same language.       Discrimination as it is today is a combination of things, when people begin looting and stealing during riots, it incites otherwise normal people to act in the same behavior. When there is a group of people who have been perceived to have done a great wrong against the masses, any injustice done to the individual of that race is typically overlooked. Following Pearl Harbor, there weren't many objections to the internment camps created to house American citizens of Japanese descent during the remainder of the war (even though our government has since apologized and even offered settlements to the families that were wronged).|`|cIheKVRmaa	No, they are discriminated against.|`|AA10481071	As long as they are decent people,  they aren't discriminated against.|`|JWnQM1soaa	Everyone but the majority face discrimination.  It will always be there.    It may not be much but it is still there.    At Least racial Stereotyping.|`|xFeGxPtoaa	every race faces discrimination    get with the program    obamas muslim so i beg to differ    stop caring about others beliefs YOU FOOL! =P|`|AA11091145	America has nothing to apoligize for|`|naijqNojaa	yes they are equal to someone who is Christian or Jewish. i m preety much sure about it casue i am an American and a muslim too. and i have never had any problem (not even a slightest part of a problem) becasue i m a muslim.|`|AA11009322	Yes they do.  Unfortunately when any group is different than the primary group or groups just about anywhere they do find some difficulties that others don't.  The US is at war with Muslim people right now and about ANYONE in a turban faces some US discrimination even if you have a Muslim name.    Now don't misunderstand me.  I do not agree with this treatment and believe each person should be treated by their merit and not their beliefs but I have personally seen American born people that were SIKH and not even Muslim be persecuted because of a turban.  After 9/11 I knew people who wore signs saying I am an American citizen so as not to be a victim of acts that had not performed.    Best wishes,  Daya|`|ec6b4fb07cc60e9ae7bef47000091ab4aa	Unfortunately there is prejudice. Not because of religion, but because of the few extremist giving them all a bad name. Same with any group though, "One bad apple can spoil the barrel"|`|63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	You will always find people who do not like, want our understand people that are different than them.  It is not just religion, but race, country of origin, sex and sexual orientation.  Instead of finding things about which we are the same they find things about which we are different.  The use excuses to hate, so with muslims it is the terrorist, even though we had christian terrorist in England and Ireland not too long ago.  They hate blacks and Mexicans because they are lazy even though both worked or still work daily in the fields, which many "whites" are not willing to do. The hate anyone with different sexual preferences, even though they  just want to be left alone.    But there are many more who will accept you as you are and will be happy to have you as their neighbor.
u6RRgSrZaa	This is for sure pork. Its very sad how we our economy is in the hole and we have our president Barack Obama supporting a bill that would 1 give 246 million dollar tax break to hollywood producers to buy motion pictures, 2. give 650 million for the digital converter box program, 3. Put new furniture in the NEW department of homeland security which they are also constructing with this bill. 4 give federal employees hybrid vehicles at the expense of 600 Million dollars 5. and have 1 Billion dollars for the 2010 census. and many more. Wait i thought this was stimulus package for the economy. Im not sure how any of the things i listed are going to help the economy. Its also sad that people can still deny that there is pork in this bill when its right in front of their faces. They must be the ones that voted for Barack.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Obama decided he wasn't a vegetarian so he loaded up on the pork.|`|xagiOb80aa	It is a spending stimulus Bill, which means, money will be spent...    I can't see how this is "pork" because the intent is to spend.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	Since Obama has went by different names in his life I would like to suggest a new one for him    Porky Obama    I guess he isnt a muslim though as he loves pork too much to be one.|`|c3vPZfghaa	link please  doing a search for what you suggested will bring up nothing but propaganda sites.

R7sGn7LMaa	Haha, I think we are all arrogant. Some of us, choose to hide it (Myself included), others flaunt it. It comes from the fact that we face the hardest Boot Camp on this Earth. We are the first ones in to fight, and are literally the FEW. When I enlisted, there were only like 160,000 marines in the service, over 500,000 soldiers in the Army, so you do math.|`|ylj2PTFFaa	it depends....  More so army than the marines....    Its not necessarily the branch or the military that breads arrogance, its more of where they came from.  From my experience, people from the "country", small towns, or "farm boys" (for a lack of a better word), are more cocky and arrogance than the others.  mainly b/c they dont have very good people skills and have an isolated view of society.    City folk are a little more reserved, but still can be cocky.  Normally they are more well mannered.|`|W3grq6EZaa	Not all of us are arrogant, but we arent anyone to be messed with either. We fight hard, play hard , and train hard. We have every right to be arrogant when your the worlds number one fighting force why shouldnt we be. Anyways looks like you had a run in with a couple of them. Just remember "There are only two kinds of people that understand Marines: Marines and the  enemy. Everyone else has a second opinion."|`|AGZhtzfIaa	im in the army yes i have notice there is a lot of arrogance in the military as for why its simple when u go in to training  you do task u never thought possible   u learn to move and think quicker and they improve your self confidence ...they improve it to a point of over confidence  ...think about it if your confident in you self you will complete your task to standard but when bullets are flying  and death is all around you do you just want to meet the standard HELL NO!!!! you want to be above the standard ...thus what im saying is we  the men and woman of your military are trained to be overconfident that overconfidence leads to arrogance|`|raImBqwraa	"There are only two kinds of people who understand Marines: Marines and the enemy. Everyone else has a secondhand opinion."    - Gen. W. Thorinson, U.S. Army    "Freedom isn't free, but the U.S. Marine Corps will pay most of your share."    - Ned Dolan    "The safest place in Korea was right behind a platoon of Marines - Lord how they can fight!"    - MGen. F. E. Lowe, U.S. Army    "Why the hell can't the Army do it if the Marines can? They are the same kind of men, why can't they be like the Marines?"    - Gen. John "Black Jack" Pershing, U. S. Army    "I have just returned from visiting the Marines at the front, and there is not a finer fighting organization anywhere in the world."    -Gen. Douglas MacArthur, U. S. Army    "The Marines I have seen around the world have the cleanest bodies, the filthiest minds, the highest morale and the lowest morals of any group of animals I have ever seen. Thank God for the U. S. Marine Corps!"    -Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt    "Don't forget that you're the First Marines - not all the communists in hell could overrun you!"    - (Col.) Lewis B. "Chesty" Puller, U.S.M.C.    One of my personal favorites,  "I came in peace, I didn't bring artillery. But I am pleading with you, with tears in my eyes, if you f*** with me, I will kill you all"    - Gen. J. Mattis, U.S.M.C. addressing Iraqi tribal leaders    So, to answer you're question, I'll leave you with one more which states better than anything the answer to your question,    "You cannot exaggerate about the Marines. They are convinced to the point of arrogance that they are the most ferocious fighters on earth - and the amusing thing about it is that they are."    - Father K. Keaney, U.S.N. Chaplain Corps|`|57N8Ls5Oaa	I love Craigger.  Anyway, the Marines are the best of the best.  Why settle for anything else.

PI8VfiY1aa	Well, actually over the last 8 years the free market has run rampant and now our country is the the brink of depression.     During the 8 years of free-market-messiah Ronald Reagan, the nation debt tripled. Did you know that Reagan actually RAISED taxes SIX times after his initial tax breaks brought about huge deficits? Did you know that under Reagan, the government GREW by 65k employees, and under Clinton, the government SHRANK by 400k employees? Did you know that under Clinton, we had the longest period of economic growth in US history, the lowest unemployment rate in over 30 years, and a surplus when he left office? Did "Big Government" stifle our economy then?     So no, I'm not afraid of "Big Government" as much as I am afraid of failed "free-market" policies and Reaganomics running our economy into the ground.    EDIT     Thumb me down if you want. I'm only citing history.|`|mggll8dRaa	Big Government is not the Big Problem;     People must live within their current ability, and pay their debts; Materialistic habits got many individuals into trouble...!!|`|GeyFdO5jaa	Yes   no faith here|`|yiBSvLf8aa	I'm afraid of anything having to do with  "big government!"

Ktvnnckgaa	No, you will be able to make a claim for everything he threw out. Try to obtain pictures of yourself showing the clothes you lost. Do you have pictures online, Facebook, MySpace, friends who might have pictures of you? Then try to remember what brand the clothes were and how much they cost. Make lists on paper.    Same with jewelry. Did you get any as gifts? Explain the situation to the people who gave you the jewelry as a gift and see if they have a receipt or remember where they bought the jewelry.    Document everything. The more the better.     Sue him while you know his home address and or work address. It will be easier to get him served and harder for him to disappear and avoid the lawsuit.    Good luck!

94f7a545cb2df2c615c0690382dec2d2aa	Absolutely.    U.S. military bases and U.S. Embassies are generally considered to be American soil.  Since both parents were citizens though, the place of birth is irrelevant.  The child is a citizen through the principle of jus sanguinis, or blood.      This is what the U.S. Constitution says:  No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.

Anway, we all knew this was coming, didn't we?  It was just a matter of time.    If there was ever justification for invasion of any countries by the UN, England and/or America on humanitarian grounds, then surely N. Korea and Zimbabwe should have qualified years ago.  But then they don't have any oil, do they...    I had a Zimbabwean staying with me 10 years ago.

No-one 'won' the war.    It wasn't a competition we were fighting for our survival.    The US did play a hugely important role, but the truth is you fought in a war your own Congress and public didn't want to join.  You didn't care about the suffering and you're surprised we didn't say thank you?  You forced war torn countries to PAY for supplies in order to keep fighting to keep the Nazis from becoming too powerful for the US to handle.    Old colony?  World Power?  So you want to control everyone just like the Nazis wanted too?  Can't you see the hypocrisy in your own question?  The Empire was before many of us were even born mate, and we've been demonised because of it. I'm surprised you didn't mention something about tea.    The only Americans i respect are the Soldiers, Sailors and Air Personnel of the 'greatest generation' of Americans who didn't fight FOR anything, they fought AGAINST tyranny. The US weren't trying to 'save our a**es', they couldn't have cared less if we'd lost, hardly worthy of praise, pal.|`|AA10444571	You didn't see how it was your fight? well, your president did and that resulted in the promulgation of Lend-Lease because he had relized a naked truth:If England were to fall it would be your turn and let me reveal some more unpleasant truths to you: in 1942 the German order of battle displayed 325 divisions,about 50 of them armoured;USA at its peak managed 90 divisions all told;just imagine that war machine at your west coast while you were fighting agaist Japan(!),a very unpleasant prospect indeed,don't you agree?especially when your chances are close to zero.   Therefore the president correctly decided that it is better to send materials to fight with English and later Russian bodies than face a German army landing in US;it was not really done to save England since "it was not your fight".    Note:I am not English.

Before long he'll be passing bills that say Americans are not aloud to say anything negative about him.    And, no, the terrorists were not from this country, but they were permitted entrance and education here. Terrorists try to slip into this country and/or do harm to this country everyday. And there are still those who became citizens of the US, make their money here, and enjoy all of the freedoms, but who are also secret sympathizers to the terrorist organizations. Those are the people who scare me. And that is who the NSA is supposed to be looking for. So, if you're not having conversations about terrorist or other illegal activities, you have nothing to worry about.|`|TfpeYyuwaa	Thats because the CIA and NSA have a charter to evesdrop abroad, and not on US citizens.

There is no reasonable cause to tap my phone or scan my emails, so why should they be able to do it?

I'll phrase it a different way, had you rather have another 9/11 or have your conversations tapped?"    You have more chance of dying in an airplane accident than in a terrorist attack.  You have more of a chance of being killed by a goat than dying in an airplane accident.  Why should I give up liberty for "security" against something that is not going to happen.  Sure, another plane could be hijacked or a few buildings blown up, but there's nothing that tapping phones and spying on emails can do to stop that.  Terrorists can just purchase pay as you go phones and go through that, or even *gasp* talk in person.  There's also the whole "code" thing so they wouldn't be caught anyways if they had a good enough code (first letter of a misspelled word is good enough to get past the filters).    So I will ask you again, why should I give up my freedom because the government tells me that they can catch bad buys with it, when someone with half a brain can get around the majority of the measures?|`|11dGXLchaa	Under Bush, our Government engaged in warrantless wiretapping of International calls.

If the U.S. government were to engage in warrantless wiretapping of domestic calls, this would violate the 4th Amendment to the Constitution.

Look it up. Wiretapping accomplishes little. Everyone knows it exists, and they can easily find alternate means of communication. Also, there is NO EVIDENCE, I repeat, NO EVIDENCE, that suggest wiretapping can prevent an attack. The government has shown no proof for these past 8 years that wiretapping has accomplished anything in terms of protecting American lives.    Would you like someone listening to you fight with someone over the phone? It's your business and not theirs. Eventually in the future the government will pass more laws limiting our rights, and say they are protecting us. That leads to oppressive governments when the government doesn't trust people. Why would you pay taxes so people can spy on us?|`|5syj6Uzaaa	My freedom is not violated in the least as a direct result of an NSA wiretap.  That is, I will not be restricted in any action simply because an agent listened to a conversation.    If I am a criminal with the intent to harm others, the rest of society might hope to see my freedom curtailed before I could carry out my intentions.  The problem is to define what is criminal.  Potential crimes run the spectrum from plotting to kill thousands of civilians to criticizing the president.    A peaceful person "with nothing to hide" may still be wary of secret wiretaps because of the potential to misuse information so collected.  Even if we doubt the likelihood of abuse at present, we should be concerned about how the power to eavesdrop could be misused in the future.  It is for this reason that we demand checks (such as warrants) on the power.    Regarding the rest of your details:    "Everyone expects the government to protect us..."  No they don't.  Some people accept that there are risks in life and that the government, even if it tries in good faith, can not protect us from every danger.  Furthermore, a lot of people view government as a greater risk than terrorists.  Even if one accepts the protection of a third party (whether it be government or a hired security agency), there is a question of how much liberty to cede in exchange for security.  Government is especially problematic since, contrary to a private agency, it tends to thrust itself upon us whether we want its protection or not.    "...yet nobody thinks the government should be able to employ mechanisms that assist in this protection."  Usually, the debate is regarding warrantless wiretaps.  Many people approve of mechanisms to eavesdrop but are fearful of the potential for abuse when there is no approval or review.    "Can anyone provide me with an alternative to eavesdropping to catch terrorist plots?"  I don't know.  Listening in on conversations is probably one of the more effective methods.    "Does anyone have an idea of how many of these plots are foiled by eves dropping?"  Nobody, I'm sure who will make a public statement.  Assertions by officials in charge of those programs should be taken with a grain of salt.  Their power and prestige is enhanced by getting us to believe that they are protecting us from shadowy threats.    "If we have to have probable cause then for every one we catch a dozen gets through and hundreds or thousands of American citizens die."  That is an assertion that can not be supported.  To be fair, of course, it can not be disproved either.    "I'll phrase it a different way, had you rather have another 9/11 or have your conversations tapped?"  If the surveillance stops at having my conversations tapped, with no further action, I would accept it to avert another 9/11 scope crime.  However, I fear that the ability to intrude upon the private lives of its citizens may lead the government to become more totalitarian.  At some point, the crime prevention could become worse than the crimes that it claims to prevent.|`|d10c7fc96d98c9c741a090a216616361aa	They're not spying on citizens, unless they are placing or receiving calls to or from terrorist supporting counties, like Iran.|`|lHDff8Braa	The 4th amendment protects me from the government indiscriminately listening to my conversations.

Barack Obama started running for President from his first day in the Senate and was only actually present on the Senate floor a total of 143 days because of campaigning.  Translation: He's WAAAAAY TOO inexperienced to be FREAKING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES and it's showing with the horrible decisions he's made thus far.  He gave Nancy Pelosi (certified nut job, seriously) control of the stimulus plan AND told everyone in the free world, via the media, he supported this crazy "plan."  NOW that's gone to you know where and people are starting to see how irresponsible of a decision that was and it's scaring the bejesus out of everyone.  We have gone from an extremely conservative President to someone who was voted the most liberal senator in 2007.  This country isn't ready for the "change" that they so badly wanted because they had no idea what they were voting for.  Really, there's a documentary about people that voted for him that had no idea what he stood for.  That's why his approval rating has dropped and probably will continue to do so.  I have nothing against the guy, other than the fact that he voted thrice AGAINST a bill that would put a stop to voluntary abortions, I'm not big on baby killing.  Oh and I still don't get the fact that he is HALF caucasian and was raised by his white grandparents and mother, yet only claims to be black...or maybe that's the media and Hollywood elite??  Guess it doesn't matter.  Anywho, other than that, I hope he does well and does what is RIGHT for OUR country, not his agenda.

DTSUJe2oaa	This article should explain it for you.~    Gay liberation  In the late 1960s, the more socialistic "liberation" philosophy that had started to create different factions within the civil rights, Black Power, anti-war, and feminist movements, also engulfed the homophile movement. A new generation of young gay and lesbian Americans saw their struggle within a broader movement to dismantle racism, sexism, western imperialism, and traditional mores regarding drugs and sexuality. This new perspective on Gay Liberation had a major turning point with the Stonewall riots in 1969.       Gay Activist magazine June 1971.On June 27, 1969 the police raided a gay bar, which was a common practice at the time. This type of raid, which was often conducted during city elections, had a new development as some of the patrons in the bar began actively resisting the police arrests. Some of what followed is in dispute, but what is not in dispute is that for the first time a large group of LGBT Americans who had previously had little or no involvement with the organized gay rights movement rioted for three days against police harassment and brutality. These new activists were not polite or respectable but rather angry activists that confronted the police and distributed flyers attacking the Mafia control of the gay bars and the various anti-vice laws that allowed the police to harass gay men and gay drinking establishments. This second wave of the gay rights movement is often referred to as the Gay Liberation movement to draw a distinction with the previous homophile movement.    New gay liberation organization were created such as the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) in New York City and the Gay Activists' Alliance (GAA). In keeping with the mass frustration of LGBT people, and the adoption of the socialistic philosophies that were being propagated in the late 1960s1970s, these new organizations engaged in colorful and outrageous street theatre (Gallagher & Bull 1996). The GLF published "A Gay Manifesto" that was influenced by Paul Goodman working titled The Politics of Being Queer (1969).    The gay liberation movement spread to countries throughout the world and heavily influenced many of the modern gay rights organizations. Today, GLBT people commemorate the Stonewall riots by annual marches that became known as gay pride parades and marches. However, the split among gay rights organization between the liberal-reformist homophile versus the socialistic gay liberationist philosophy still exists. Today, organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign follow a more mainstream, middle class-oriented and reformist tradition, while other organizations such as the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF) try to be grassroots-oriented and support local and state groups to create change from the ground up.~
1Rl3zCG1aa	Bro, we don't know.  The President doesn't know. Congress doesn't know.    Basically whenever the job is done, and terrorists are taking care of.|`|6ad710b1b3d9318af1b579f1f46ac105aa	When we finish what we set out to do. If that take the rest of our natural lives then so be it. Unless, of course, you'd like to see another 9/11.|`|05c920c9f1b5e4deb703e24090ba3744aa	Nobody has a perfect answer for that,but the mission there is similar to Iraq. When the country is able to function on it's own,and they're government can handle the situation on they're own.Basically,we need to reduce terrorism down to the extent where its on the same level as a 'hate crime' or 'anomaly'.    We can't ever completely destroy terrorism, but on the temporary note, we can definitely utilize the military to cripple the hell out of they're infrastructure and leadership. But the problem is,no matter how crippled they are,they can always restart because they're an ideology. Look at Communism right now? It's not gone but it barely exists. We want Radical Islam to sink to that kind of level, and after we use the military option, we need to win over the people.     We did a combination of both in the Cold War,doing just one thing never worked. Vietnam soley utilized the military option and no matter how strong we were,public support was what we needed the most. Toward the end of the Cold War,we had the majority of the public's support,and the Soviet Union's actions in Afghanistan and inside it's nation made it less credible.    It ultimately took military action and public support to defeat communism,and the War on Terror will be won the same way.|`|AA11313983	Once no one in the US can fully explain what we're doing in Afghanistan.  So, about seven years ago.|`|ZKZxe1v5aa	when radical islam stops being a threat there, and the country can efficiently run itself|`|QHu1JcJ1aa	Russia could not win there neither would will we, we should leave and worry about rebuilding our military. These Terrorist make an attack every 8 years, Its close for another attack we should keep our eyes open. There will never be victory declared over there, because you cannot change 2000-3000 years of their ways in a few years, Once we leave Iraq it will go back to normal after a few years, because they will be attacked and influenced by Iran, Just leave the middle east be. When the country was founded by our fathers it wasent only liberty and freedom that we fought for but our fathers made it clear that we should also learn to mind our own business|`|HA2IV3r3aa	Why couldn't we train the police or the army?  The Iraqis are just as corrupt and they're nearly read to take over their country.  Just because a mission is difficult doesn't mean it's impossible.  Afghanistan is where the enemy is and always was.  Iraq was a drain on resources that kept us from having a chance of doing well in Afghanistan.  I say we stay until we're finished, and I'm excited that the President wants to focus on Afghanistan instead of Iraq.
AA10476668	Does this amount include the cost of incarcerating the illegals and illegal gang bangers and criminals? In Los Angeles County the rate of illegal births is astronomical-- in some hospitals it's more than half. In June, CA will be gathering signatures to put an iniitiative on the ballot that will end immediate U.S. birthright for illegals. It's about 100 years overdue, but will be one of the most important means to end the mass immigration to the U.S. to pop out anchor babies courtesy of U.S. tax payers, and get on the social welfare rolls. This practice is arcane and absurd and virtually non-existent in the majority of the world. It costs hard-working U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars, when their own medical and primary needs are not even fully met. In CA, they keep saying we need more and more public schools. If the gazillions of illegals in this state were not here we'd have EMPTY schools, and no need to continue tapping tax payers for more and more money. The level of education would also go up, because they now teach to the ESL students who have to learn very slowly. I pay taxes for my public school so my young child gets to sit in an overcrowded classroom learning below his level because our bleeding heart politicians like to spend our hard-earned tax dollars to keep their campaign contributors (Big Business) happy. This is the ultimate in unfairness, and our politicians don't give a crap. Look for signature gatherers before June so you can sign to put an inititative on the ballot to end anchor babies once and for all. When it passes in CA that will be the precendent for all other states.|`|Ca8i226Xaa	I think the CA is in an inevitable decline to third world status. They are mostly responsible for the situation they are in by being so "illegal alien friendly." However, the federal govt has not been doing enough to stop the flow of illegal aliens into the USA and to find and deport them.    Many whites and blacks are fleeing CA to rejoin the USA. Bye, bye CA, hello Mexifornia!|`|bl0RZJrDaa	California was the land of liberals and this is what happens when there is no one to stop them,    Texas is the republican opposite of Calif and you don't see Texas bankrupted don't you?|`|BgExwcvMaa	Proposition 187 was supposed to do away with all of that.

I think it is a lack of political will, and California leaders are afraid of disenfranchising the Hispanic vote.  Most legal Hispanics seem to support illegal immigration.  I've heard possibly two in the US speak out against it in the last 10 years. What they don't understand is uncontrolled immigration will destroy the very reason they came here in the first place, and turn the US into the place they left.     Any Hispanics out there who are against legal immigration?|`|CbeNLpb3aa	No wonder you're bankrupt!|`|t82AcQT1aa	Cali is a classic example of "libs gone wild". Coming soon to the rest of the U.S.
gasquENMaa	I'll take this as two separate questions. Outstanding warrants are NOT published on websites. That is not considered public knowledge.    Criminal background checks can be found all over the web. The vast majority of them are small fees but are highly erroneous and erratic in what they gather and report. Most of them draw information from public sites and do not attempt to verify any of the info they publish. As such, information that should be there is not and in quite a few cases, items are on one person's report that belong on someone else's.    The only criminal checks that are true and accurate are the state level BCI and Fed level NCIC checks. You can request your own background ( state check is $18 to $20 and Fed check is $68) but you can only request another person's check with written permission allowing the request.     The state check can be requested through your local police or sheriff's department. The Fed check can be requested through your local State Police barracks.    Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you
VIhj7ghUaa	Avoid conservatives.    Actually, getting a good education is the best way out of a job where this kind of uneducated person is likely to be found. Not only that, but those who hire people with valuable skills have more respect for them, so if your bosses are pr!cks too, that's a great way to advance to a job where bullsh!t isn't part of the job description.|`|G49lKR56aa	yes.
a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Yes, there's always a future.  I'm not going to lie to you and candy-coat it.  It's going to be tough.  You will be very heavily in debt to many other countries.  We are borrowing at an astronomical rate.      I'm guessing that you are far enough along in school to understand what living in debt does to people.  It limits their freedom.  For example, I could go out tomorrow and max out my credit cards.  What happens next?  Then I would have to work every day for years to pay them off--along with the interest that I had to pay.  As a nation, that's what we're doing.  Someone will need to pay it off.  I'm truly sorry.  My daughter will be paying for it too.    You will have wonderful new technology.  It'll be exciting.  Be careful that it doesn't monitor you and take away your freedoms.    You will live longer than my generation and your quality of life in your later years should be better.  You will also probably work longer before you retire.    Overall, you should have a higher average education level than we did.  However, you will need a college education to work.    You will enjoy the diversity of your fellow citizens more than we did.  That will be fantastic!  Watch for class warfare--it could potentially cripple this nation as much as racism did in the past.    You will live and love just like every other generation.  If you take the time to look through history, you will see that our world today isn't really that bad.  You're gonna have good times and bad just like the rest of us.    Now, stop worrying about things that you can't change and do what you can today.  Whether or not you enjoy your life depends solely on YOU.  My father was born during the depression to a poor family.  They did without a lot including food sometimes.  Due to an illness, he went blind at 7 years old.  He went on and lived, loved, worked, bought a home, had a family, and now he fishes in the Bay about 3 days a week.  He's been alive through the depression, WW2, the Cold War, Korea, Vietnam, Granada, Desert Storm, and now the Iraq war.  He's just so grateful to be alive--of course he never fought in any of these wars, but he's known many people who have.  He's lived through the Carter presidency when mortgage rates were 20.0%.  But every day he wakes up with a song.  Always smiling.  He lost his only son 10 years ago and it was hard on him but he remembers the good and keeps going.    Being happy with your life is a choice.  It has little to do with what's around you.  It's what's inside of you that counts.  What will you choose?|`|XuG5g9Zgaa	Get some counseling!    Good grief.

It's pretty depressing, seeing as though a lot of us have wasted our lives slaving away in school so as to get into college and eventually get a decent job. Once this generation is in charge, what we're given will be in pretty bad shape. Not only the economy, but also the environment and the world in general.    I'm not usually this much of a pessimist, but everything has had me pretty depressed lately.
GMYNuFCDaa	USA, in any objective analysis.     The USA doesn't have to make up assessments to reverse engineer to their strengths and others weaknesses to come out ahead in any over all quality of life study.    Watch, a study from the UK will  come out on this question, one weighing primary aged preschool attendance as heavily as child deaths. The US doesn't do as much primary aged pre school, but their graduates come out and make much more money and have a  much higher quality of life by any objective measure.    A whole bunch of brits will report this answer to shut it up too, watch for it ...     They hate that the US is so far ahead of the UK in standard of living, and live in denial about it, so facts to prove it come up and they swarm to destroy it.    The UK is pretty good, but they have a high level of taxation that keeps them down. The US is probably headed for that situation too, because of the same reasons. The ultra rich elite who control the media and entertainment industry don't want the competition. The worse the economy is the higher up they are, which translates into a much higher degree of wealth and power.    I'll give the UK one thing. Without their lead in the world the conditions that lead to the US coming to be would never have occurred. The UK has lead to a remarkable transformation in the world. We can give some of that credit to France and Spain as well. Of course the origins go back to Greece and the birth of democracy.|`|TfpeYyuwaa	Thats like asking what is the best flavor, Vanilla or Chocolate.

Personally, I'd rather live in the U.S. because we have a variety of people and cultures, but I think the UK surpasses us in many other areas.|`|ohUm00RYaa	Lived in both, USA has the highest standard of living in the world despite all its imperfections.  Don't think UK doesn't have high crime, it does actually, lots of stabbings and people getting thron into traffic like buses and train tracks.  This crime is worse to me because it is so random and can happen to people who have no criminal involvment.  where as people in usa who are victims of crime tend to live either in high crime areas or be criminals.  UK has a generation of kids whos parents are rich so don't work and commit  crimes for fun.    UK can't even find jobs for its own people.  For the average joe, in USA you can live in a mansion in relation to the townhouses that rich UKers live in.  I didn admit it i couldn't live in USA or Canada then UK be my  3.

(Google)    In the past 50 years, the Democrats have done statistically much better than the Republicans.    If you're a conservative that wants a real fiscal party in office, you should be voting Libertarian or Constitution, not Republican. The modern Republican party is pretty far from Fiscal.

yT3ZNEROaa	You have to write a letter of apology to the state who issues your license.  You have to be up front with them first.  Then when your job hunting they will know that the state is aware of it and will be more likely to hire you knowing that you didn't lie to the state to get your license with that on your record.

If you have a record and the job you want requires that you do not have a record, then there doesn't seem to be much that you can do - other than trying to clear your record. Since shoplifting is usually a misdemeanor, in some states you can apply to have it cleared from your record if it's been five years or more.|`|rg5AlVkYaa	First- you may want to learn proper spelling before you apply to have your criminal record expunged.   I am assuming that by Lisence- you actually mean license   I am hoping that you have your agent license not your "agint lisence" and that they may consider hiring you or should I say not "hirring" you based on your grammar and spelling.   Here is how you needed to word your question and follow up "sentence":  I have a shoplifting record and need to know how I (notice the capital letter I) can legally receive my insurance license? I have passed the exams to receive my license and should be getting hired now. Because of the record the company is now calling HR to see what can be done for me. Any suggestions?    If you were to fill out my forms so grammatically incorrect I would fire you very quickly.     Honestly do yourself a favor and while you are waiting to find out; enroll in grammar and spelling classes. That will take you farther in life and you will gain respect amongst your peers wherever you work.    You will have to talk with a lawyer about having your record expunged if enough time has passed since your conviction.   Good Luck.

DTSUJe2oaa	Fairness A Theory of Justice  In his A Theory of Justice, John Rawls used a social contract argument to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness: an impartial distribution of goods. Rawls asks us to imagine ourselves behind a veil of ignorance which denies us all knowledge of our personalities, social statuses, moral characters, wealth, talents and life plans, and then asks what theory of justice we would choose to govern our society when the veil is lifted, if we wanted to do the best that we could for ourselves. We dont know who in particular we are, and therefore cant bias the decision in our own favour. So, the decision-in-ignorance models fairness, because it excludes selfish bias. Rawls argues that each of us would reject the utilitarian theory of justice that we should maximize welfare (see below) because of the risk that we might turn out to be someone whose own good is sacrificed for greater benefits for others. Instead, we would endorse Rawlss two principles of justice:    Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all.   Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both   to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, consistent with the just savings principle, and   attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.~

6od8qaU2aa	paying a fine is usually the penalty for a first offense of abuse of a human also (e.g., simple battery), so it is not inherently unjust.      but the premise of your question is fault: although most first-time offenders in non-serious cases will only pay a fine, animal abuse is punishable almost everywhere with the possibility of jail.

0cc280908f5890dc4f887659d66561b6aa	Jury duty allows people to decide cases.|`|716335ab6ea56965d0cb4b7367b650edaa	Thank goodness I took a law course. I'm a Canadian but since Canadian and American jurisprudence is basically similar, I will explain.    A jury is a panel of citizens, either twelve (grand jury) or seven ( petite jury) called  on by the legal system to hear evidence and decide the  guilt or innocence of accused person(s). Both sizes of juries usually have one or two alternates who can be substituted for any member who becomes unable to continue. The smaller petite jury is normal for criminal cases involving lesser crimes. The grand jury is more often used in murder, organized crime cases, and in the federal courts.     The qualifications are very basic.   1. You must be a citizen either by birth or naturalization.  2. You must be mentally competent.  3. You must be over the legal age of majority  4. You must not have a criminal record for which a pardon has not       been granted, or currently incarcerated.  5. You must be a resident of the state and county in which  the trial  is       being held.     If you are called on to serve on a jury, you will receive a document by mail called a subpoena. This is a legal order for you to be in attendance at  court on a date and time specified in the order. If you cannot attend due to illness, family circumstances, or emergency you or someone you trust must call the court house and notify clerk.     if you are chosen from the jury pool you will be paid a day rate plus mileage if you must travel more than a certain distance. Most times you are free to go home every night. If there  is reason to prevent tainting, tampering or threats, the state ( or Crown in Canada) can request that the jury be sequestered. That is housed as a group at a hotel like was done in the OJ Simpson case. Room, pay  and food but forget about the mail, newspapers , TV, and the internet. Books, puzzles, crossword puzzles, movies, cards and games are okay.|`|eEg5wp8Taa	Jury duty is when the government to take part in a jury calls on you, they give you compensation, though not enough for most people, and if you refuse, they fine you.    First, you sand around with about 50 other people answering questions, afterwards two lawyers stand in front of the group picking people to be part of the jury and vetoing the other's pick.    If you are lucky, you are chosen to be on the jury along with 13 other people, two of whom are backup.    Then you go to a hotel, not allowed to do much of anything until court. Then you sit in a courtroom listening to the lawyers do their thing and then afterwards you get to decide who is innocent and who is guilty.|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	A jury trial is a trial before a panel of 12 citizens chosen from a pool. The panel of 12 is called a jury...  The jury listens to both sides of the argument, looks at the evidence presented and decides who they believe and if there's enough evidence to prove the charge the prosecution is trying to prove...    U.S. citizens in good standing and 18+ are indeed potential jurors...  When there is to be a trial letters are sent out to a number of people in a court jurisdiction (Each county has a courthouse and jurors for a trial in that court house come from that county)..   From those potential jurors the prosecution, defense and judge question and select the 12 they want to sit on the panel (in high profile or potentially lengthy trials alternates are sometime chosen to replace jurors who might somehow have to leave the original panel...  Alternates listen just like the original panel, if a juror is dropped out an alternate takes their place without having to restart the trial, select a new jury etc..  It's a time and resource saving precaution)..      The questions asked in selecting jurors are designed to tell the different sides whether or not the juror may be sympathetic to their side...   Obviously the defense wants people who would be sympathetic to their client and the prosecution wants people who will be sympathetic to the victim...     If you are selected for a jury you are expected to show up at court and listen to the trial and decide as explaining in paragraph 1....
qwaWd14vaa	Rape is a physical act against a womans will. In many states it can be reported as what she states happened.  If she fills out a complaint, or report, depending again on the states statutes of limitations, she could take a person to court.  Without a rape kit test being done, it would be her word against his?  Most women do not report a rape, since the stigma and embarressment of it all. (Easier to clean up and move on, bad part is that it keeps haunting them mentally.) Because of that they have to talk to someone about it for closure of the event. Thank God she has you to talk too some women have nobody to listen or talk too.She needs your support more now then ever before.

Like any criminal case, the longer the victim waits to report a crime, the less likely the criminal will be caught and convicted.|`|AA12109395	Doubtful, without a full confession from the perpetrator. When the rape occurred, there was physical evidence, an evaluation or her psychological state, and hopefully, a skillful interview from police. All lend credibility to the charge. Even with all this, it is sometimes difficult to get a conviction in a rape case. Without that immediate police report, an evaluation of her psychological state, or a police interview, it will be very difficult, if not impossible, unless the defendant is a serial offender and has other victims.     Even though it is " her word against his", she should report the incident. Once the police have this on record, it increases the likelihood for him to be arrested/convicted should his name pop up in future investigations.|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	Absolutely she can.  And as long as she didn't douche she will still have evidence (DNA) that the act happened.  If your the man that did the rape, then turn yourself in and save the rest of the world from hunting you down.|`|NTOZ8Q4Aaa	Most states have a long statute of limitations on rape. Thats why you will occasionally see in the news about a child who is raped and doesn't disclose the crime for 18 years, then they charge the perpetrator. Physical evidence is always good to have, but not always needed. If "her word" is credible and compelling, a jury can convict.|`|NLzYefsVaa	YES.  Most sex crimes there is a delayed disclosure for many different reasons.  It is actually RARE for the victim to report it immediately, if they report it at ALL.  Some people blame themselves.  Some think they will not be believed.  Some just have their own reasons.      Whatever the reason, it has nothing to do with ability to get a conviction against the perpetrator.  The DA's who routinely prosecute these types of crimes are use to it and have the ability to explain to juries the many reasons for not reporting the crime immediately.      YES you can get a conviction even if there is no evidence and it is one persons word against another.  There are many different ways to corroborate  what happened.  We get convictions all the time with children who are molested and don't tell for years.  She should report it.

There may still even be evidence...her clothing for example...often even when it's washed, evidence can remain. Evidence in the location where it happened, etc.

I blame Obama for nominating him and not withdrawing the nomination when his troubles became known, I blame the Congress for voting to appoint him, and I blame Geithner himself for not withdrawing.    The guy who is going to run our economic policies to try and fix the mess we're in should have impeccable credentials.

His stimulus will be a disaster and bring us even closer to another depression. He is arrogant and has a big ego.

If you went to a counselling agency funded by the voluntary sector or the local council, you would probably see a volunteer trainee counsellor.

For Bush's tenure, the estimated total ride in debt as % of GDP is estimated to be in the 13% range, several Presidents have seen overall declines (Clinton, Johnson, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Nixon), even Ford saw an overall rise in debt as % of GDP of only a tiny .1%, which is far less than the 20% range that Ronald Reagan gave us.

Reagan, 1983, 6.0%, higher than ANY year of the Great Depression, which peaked at 5.9%!!!  That is just astonishing.  Do you hate me now?    Edit:  You said Clinton?  Are you reading the graph upside down?  During Clinton's term, the deficit as a percentage of GDP declined every year without fail, becoming a surplus from 1998-2001.    2nd edit:  Say DEBT as a percentage of GDP if that's what you mean.  How did that rise faster under Clinton again?  http://zfacts.com/p/318.html|`|SI8NXzNSaa	looking at the charts, it looks like a peak after WWII which would put that in the FDR-Truman years, dropping to it's lowest point during the Carter years, peaking again during the Reagan/Bush years, peaking during Clinton and then dropping, then steadily rising during the W.Bush years...However, the charts didn't include the last of the W years, so its hard to say where we are now...probably peaking unbelievably.    --------------edit    Just to point out tho, It did peak during the Clinton years, however, this is a Debt vrs GDP chart, which means that the real debt was roughly steady during the Clinton years, but a downturn in  the economy caused the peak, however, twards the end of his administration, the GDP began rising, while the debt was not increasing, causing a large drop, before W took office, which he then began to reverse the trend, and began increasing the debt vrs gdp.    The one thing to remember about statistics is, "Statistics are a loose woman, tickle them just right, and they'll do whatever you want..."

The fear comes from how scientist would grow these organs in order to be transplanted into the patient.  It would be immoral to grow a human being as a clone of the patient so that we may then cut him or her in order to use them as spare parts.      On the other hand, the benefits of cloning could help restore populations of animals listed on the endangered list.  The same process could be used to help feed millions of people who are currently lack food.  This may also be helpful in the future as the world's population continues to grow at a fast pace.      Cloning has some benefits and some disadvantages depending on the motives of corporations.  If governments become proactive on creating laws for cloning then there maybe ways to prevent some of the immoral activities that may occur.

The only welfare they should recieve is a book on the reproductive system and a box of condoms.

XbIoIUclaa	During every war we had journalists that were almost a part ot military units and encountered all the hazards that the troops went through. so the answer is yes.|`|4t2kd03Waa	Ninety nine percent of journalists are self serving and will not expose themselves to harms way if they can prevent it. Most of blood suckers in the sense they write about people that do things that they refuse to do or are not capable of doing.  As far as wartime journalists are concerned, it was the war in Vietnam that they were the enemies number one ally in that they reported the combat with a twist in favor of the enemy.  If you want to be honorable you should distance yourself as far as possible from anybody that calls themselves a journalist.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	Not if they wanted to live to report the story.|`|AA10932453	Your best resource would be WWI journalists themselves.    H. L. Mencken is a great read -- both for his coverage and insight into the war, and his general wisdom.  Read some of his stuff and you should get the flavor you seek.    You should be wary of confusing the 'journalist' with the 'soldier'.  Quite often, people assume that a journalist enjoys (what a great word) the same experiences as the soldier.  They do not.  The journalist is likely to be protected and shielded from harm, often at the expense of soldiers.  Don't confuse the two.

His silly supporters expected The One to make everything better immediately.  It didn't happen.  Now they're on to something else.  Obama is OVER.

Every group is going to have its own "rating" whether it is true or not.   What do you think of him?    Here is what I see.        He is bright and happy, and gives hope to people.   He has a lot of good ideas.  He can think.  A President is mostly a figurehead.  He doesn't make all the rules himself.  There are bunches of people who try and persuade the guy into things and he has to be smart enough to see the long view, and not get blackmailed into wrong decisions.       Obama and his family are good people.  His leaving Chicago left a void that exposed a criminal - that is a good sign already, that his presence raised the ethic level of Chicago, so that a crim fell right out of there.   I bet more follow, too.    Once we have chosen a President we should support him.       I don't believe anything I read in papers or Internet unless I see proof.    And I use my own judgement.

Baby steps Obama, baby steps.    But really, are people really that knowledgeable in this section? From what I've heard from numerous users in their questions and answers it shows that the maturity rate rounds out at about the average of... a 12 year old.    And voting age is WHAT again?

The right wing extremists and racists hate Obama, of course. And they are a vocal lot. That's not surprising, though. They are nothing but mouth. If they had anything of value to offer they wouldn't have to resort to bigotry and racism to make themselves feel important.    Otherwise, Obama's popularity is staying strong g so far. You can expect a fall to some extent over the next few months as people realize he was telling th etruth when he said that things are not going to get petter quickly. but if his economic recovery plans succeed (which I think they will), he'll end up with an extremely strong base of support by 2012.    As for the bigots--being hated by that trash is a compliment.|`|sfCRwcRCaa	I have noticed that about Yahoo Answers as well.  It seems that their is a significant amount of people that dislike him that have an account on Yahoo Answers.  The fact is that he is currently maintaining a a very high popularity rating.  Even so, there are still those that dislike him, or disagree with his politics.

Their collective leg is still tingling!|`|438e26d7b22965d7e9bbd6ed05be2455aa	no, people don't hate him.  but people themselves set a super high expectation of his capabilities, and are disappointed somewhat that he couldn't delivery in spite of these expectations being unrealistic.   bottom line is that obama inherited the presidency at one of the worst times in modern history, and all eyes, ears, and hands are waiting for the answers that will make us recover fastest.  just like bush got blamed, so will people be quick to blame obama, even though they will have no suggestion to offer for improvement.    remember the old expression "buy the rumor, sell the fact."  pre-election was the rumor, post election is the fact.  the newness is wearing off, and that does not translate into less popularity, it translates into less hype.  people have accepted him as president so there isn't as much pressure to accept him.|`|0xRjKlTIaa	Wow! It is very strange to read from people here who have nothing better to say than hatred, jealousy and frustration. Things are not getting better so quickly and the only questions people spend precious time asking is about the in and outs of hatred.    How can you hate someone you don't know ?  How can you hate the person who represent you ?    How can you preach hatred here and say others are practicing a fundamental teaching on hating others. Aren't you doing the same thing here ?    if someone believes that yahoo is the only place where the whole country comes to exchange views, then there's something wrong.   Go to other places, sources (BBS, IRC, FORUMS etc.. and get more information which would avoid a badly mixed and dangerous mentality.    Is smartness not a quality in America ? How comes the ridiculous is paving the way deep into some people's minds ?      Give time for the job to be done and he would accomplish it with your help. People all over the world congratulated the movement of change in the USA, but it's deeply hypocritical to read this type of reactions. "It's amazing that a lot of work is ahead".   Are you not dividing your nation ?    Not everyone uses Internet: Some cannot afford. Do you think about them ?    "This is common in almost every country", but the USA is always seen as a model. The big problem that lies ahead is the attitude developed here which luckily only reflects a few people who have nothing better to do than polemics.

It was the first of three amendments arising out of the aftermath of the Civil War.|`|UufepGETaa	actually the origional 13th amendment says that slavery wouldnt b legal in states fighting against the union so technically it didnt ban slavery at all because it was redundant if you say that if your in a state fighting against the union you are free but your in a slave state during the war so the confederacy wasnt going to let you free and the union didnt care about slavery in the north even though it was rarely used by then

QIQNzE11aa	You cannot shield him from liberal views. He sees and hears them every day of his life. He'll never learn if he doesn't accept that people can have their own point of view. 15 is not a young age. He's not even considered a child anymore. He has the ability to create a child, he has the testosterone of a man.     How do you expect him to be grown up enough to face college or move out in 3 years if you coddle him now?     If you do not want him in class that day, you are doing your son a great disservice. He'll hear all about it the next day anyway. In fact, you'll have to make him blind and deaf with no ability to learn a skill of communication to never hear both sides of gun control. I doubt highly this is the first time it's been brought up. I am betting it has been a contreversy in school so the teacher, at their wits ends, are making it into a learning subject now.     You can keep your teenaged son out of school for the day, but not just remove him for one class.|`|AA11206283	I think your position is both untennable and a bad idea.    15 year olds own guns, kill animals and in some cases, take guns to school and kill students.

I think exposing your kid to different viewpoints is important. He's 15. In 3 years he'll be an adult. He needs to learn decision making and critical thinking skills before that point in time. You make it sound like he's 3 years old. Let him hear what others have to say on the subject and see how silly their argument is. You can't shield him from views that you do not believe in. You trying to do so impedes his ability to develop good critical thinking skills and will hurt him in the long run. He has to make his own decisions; mommy can't have him on a leash forever.|`|CbeNLpb3aa	I think you have to permanently remove him for home school.|`|Z03zgM0maa	Why would you remove him from learning about what other peoples opinions are?

If you are worried that a debate on gun control is going to warp your son's fragile little mind, you had better pull him out of school permanently and home school him. He is going to hear plenty of other opinions that are different from what Mommy and Daddy think. Chances are, he already has.|`|e1z8pHfmaa	Your his PARENT.  You can excuse your son from school for the entire day if you wish.  You can send him to a different school, you can teach him yourself if you wish.    If you do not mind my 2 cents..... why in the world would you make it your goal to keep your child UNEDUCATED at his own school??    He is learning to debate.... even if he has to defend a position he (or you) doesn't necessarily support... this is NOT a bad thing.    What if your son decides he wants to go to law school???  Every attorney's entire career is based upon defending the position of SOMEONE ELSE.  That is.... criminal defense attorneys don't endorse murder.... but they do defend those that have been accused of committing it.      Imagine what would happen if everyone refused to learn about things that they did not agree with??  What if Einstein refused to learn about Physics because his own theory did not agree with Newton's Laws???  We'd have no Theory of Relativity.... that's what.    Being close-minded is not a virtue.... and neither is being only half-educated.... and if you think your son should learn only about things you agree with or believe your son will go through life being mocked by people who are not half-educated... but are rather fully versed in an issue... understand both sides of the debate.... and have come to a principled and educated point-of-view on that issue.    For a great example... see Bill O'Reilly being taken to task over his lack of knowledge as to world war 2 politics/ history by a MOVIE star of all people.  Why.... because he obviously failed to fully investigate the issue he was talking about... and has gone through nearly his entire LIFE believing something that is demonstrably NOT TRUE... like the Swiss being the only non-partisan nation in Europe during WW2.    P.S. I am a very socially liberal.... believing that government has virtually no place telling people what they can or cannot do in their own PRIVATE lives.  I consider myself a "liberal" as the term applies to politics.    However, I believe very strongly that the 2nd Amendment MEANS WHAT IT SAYS.... and that the Bill of Rights lists both rights of the individual citizen and prohibitions as to government conduct.  There is no sensible reading of Amendment 2 which can be construed as NOT applying to individuals.... given the context of the other 9 and the simple fact that militias (at that time) were manned by citizen soldiers who largely supplied their own rifles.    Point is.... not all "liberals" agree with ALL so called "liberal" stances.  The term is non-descriptive and overused (treated as a swear word by conservative pundits).  Do not be what the left mocks.... and know that anyone who toes the party line on EVERY issue makes quite clear that their a lot of issues they fail to comprehend fully.|`|m5FyTeYgaa	If you are serious (I have my doubts), then you should call and speak with the teacher. Find out the purpose of the exercise. Find out how the sides will be selected. What if the issue was abortion, or the stimulus package, or Israel & Gaza, or any other controversial topic? Should your son be protected from any other point of view?    At 15 the idea of protecting your son from different points of view is troubling. He should be forming his own opinions, and be able to intelligently express them. He should also learn that all arguments have 2 sides. My son is 16, and I wouldn't dream of removing him from that class. Even if the teacher is a raving liberal I would still want hi to have the experience. Now if the teacher punished my son for his views, then we would have words!    When I was in college I took a debating class. The prof would purposely make us argue the position we opposed. I once had to argue in favor of communism, and I won even though I abhor the concept. Even if he is placed on the pro gun control side, the research he does will teach him why gun control doesn't work. Try it for yourself. Try to find FACTS that support gun control. It is very difficult.|`|oxmkllnWaa	15 year old boy in Arkansas... conservative parent... he's probably PRO-gun... so don't remove him from class... let him STUDY all the negative affects of gun control (there are no positive affects), the history of the 2nd amendment, etc... it'll be good for him.|`|WubBcqOBaa	obviously you're joking...|`|OwSpVGlbaa	I think you bring a good point with being concerned...I myself am still struggling through a bay area (California) school where liberalism is pouned into my brain.  I come from a family with strong conservative values and have learned to defend myself in debates.  I think that if you really want to you should pull your kid out of school but the better thing to do (that I do and have done in the past) is go home and study up on the facts, and also learn what the liberals say because I know for a fact that in school they do like to exagerate points alot and make republicans look like idiots.  Prepare him, dont shelter him.  He has to learn to debate and know what hes up against, his teacher will respect you and him more.  My contemperary world issues teacher was a liberal ranter and shut down most of my ideas but I would stay strong and not backdown from my points when it was me vs. 28 liberal kids and a teacher.  If he stays strong and doesn't back down and brings up good points, he should be in good shape.  Subscribe to NRA's first freedom magazine or sign him up for InSights, the kids version.  I get  this magazine (at very low cost) and it gives you FACTS about how liberals are trying to take advantage of us and our Second amendment rights.    Good luck

It does not create any new jobs even for building roads. This package simply funds those projects that are currently scheduled to be done. The contractors have all the people they already need to do the work.    If you want to create new jobs, make it easier and profitable for those who have the money now to start new companies and businesses to hire those people who need the jobs.    I have never seen a poor person start a new company and employ someone else. I have seen a poor person start a business and provide fro himself, and as that business grew, he was able to hire others to help with the workload. But if that poor person is burdened with taxes, fees, and extraneous costs to do business, then he never has the ability to let his business thrive.    And that is all because government, federal, state, and local, all want their piece of the profits of the business.    Get the government out of business and let PEOPLE do what they know best.        EDIT:  My God! It is truely amazing to see so many people who have parttaken of the koolaid! Do you people not realize that this "Stimulus" bill is a welfare/redistribution bill? More than half of the thing goes to welfare and social programs that do nothing for the economy. And when those few new jobs from roadbuilders start, how much more do you think they will be paying in taxes to cover the increase in expenses for the welfare programs of this lunatic president. Get the government out of business and your back pocket and this economy will stimulate itself. Reagan prooved it and Bush demonstrated it a second time. Why did we not have an economic downturn after 9-11? Because Bush got out of the way! Go study some economics people!|`|uVggUDWNaa	The stimulus does just build roads but to address your question about road workers. No the market won't crash again.  The stimulus counts on the entire economy recovering  whole and not just the construction section.  Recessions come in cycles and the stimulus will hopefully pull us out of the tale end of this cycle.      These jobs will become permanent if the stimulus works.

Used to be out of pride as Englishmen and thinking of those things as more for dirty foreigners. More recently, they're so used to sucking the public teat that there's little pride. Not that civil violence would accomplish anything, either, but the drunks will always act up a bit.
fL0wHyNNaa	Maybe. I'd have to agree with them at least 75% of the time. But I must say, the biggest turnoff of the republican party is the social conservative nonsense. If they'd give that up, I'd seriously consider it.|`|AA11702773	Well, I've been registered GOP for decades, and I'd leave.

We may end up isolated by some means other than an engineered policy.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Haven't yet.|`|70503caf06f4695beca81e8a95fd439aaa	As a long time student of economics, I am of the monetarist Chicago school of economics. Democrat Keynesian economics had been thoroughly debunked in the 1970s in America and in the 1990s in Japan. Fiscal responsibility should be the cornerstone of both parties, but what we have is neither party engaging in fiscally responsible manner. I can't just rack up debt on my credit cards and expect to get rich off of debt, nor should I expect the government to bring us to wealth by lousy and budget-ignoring legislation.    Incidentally, that is precisely why I voted democrat in 2008. George W. Bush completely blew Clinton's spending patterns out of the water in terms of breaking records for the amount of money borrowed and spent. Inflation is ramping up, hyperinflation looms in the horizon, and Americans are stubbornly refusing to switch from their freewheeling days of borrowing and spending and switching to a savings-based budget, while congress is convinced that it can throw a few billion dollars at the system and we can go back to the good old days when no one saved money and everyone blew every last dime they owned on worthless garbage. Obama gave the more consistent plan for economics. McCain was a bad joke who actually came out and said it, that he didn't know too much about economics (his specialty happens to be in bombing people) and despite preaching small government, turned around an promised an unprecedented buyout of bad mortgages! Republicans have their rhetoric, but after Bush, I've learned that a candidates likely policies seldom match their rhetoric, and especially don't match the rhetoric of their constituents.     Truth be told, there is somewhere that I would like Republicans to become more moderate in.... well, I should say that I would like Republicans to become a LOT more moderate in... the Jesus vote. In the grand scheme of things, abortion and gay marriage are of no consequence to the vast majority of people, and should by no means take the center stage of politics. Come on, guys, if Turkey can pride itself on its secular, impartial government, so can we.     And ideally, I'd like to see Republicans come around to the "strong national defense" thing, too. Bush had wonderful rhetoric in the 2000 campaign season; believing that America should not be the world's policeman, that the U.S shouldn't indulge in "nation-building"... boy did he ever eat those words. Especially considering that the 9/11 Commission Report came to the conclusion that the reason that the terrorists attacked us was precisely for those reasons, that we were indulging in nation-building in the middle east and acting like the world policeman. Pity that Republicans would sooner believe Sean Hannity telling them that Osama Bin Laden wants to eat their children instead of the exhaustively researched, nonpartisan 9/11 Commission report.    I am currently a registered independent. I vote based on the stronger candidate. If Republicans dropped the "Who Would Jesus Bomb" thing, then maybe I would consider rejoining the ranks. If they keep the neocon nonsense or abandon fiscal responsibility in the name of making democrats happy, then I will stay independent.|`|v0PY0UDAaa	Preach it brother.   There are no fiscal conservatives left in government.  I want them back.|`|Qo4V6aVcaa	I'm Libertarian.      The truest Repub.|`|cYuGYhGmaa	Maybe.

My primary motivation in politics is Social libertarianism... really Libertarianism alltogether, but I really don't see the Republicans as being anything except for anti programs that help minorities and poor. They're all for huge defense spending, imposing anti-gay laws, anti-minority laws, etc. etc. and they just want a different kind of big government than the Dems do, and a government I am surely against.|`|XuLVfj1caa	If either party moved to a more centrist platform I think we'd all be happy, right?!|`|ohxiNOFjaa	After 32 years of voting a straight Democratic Party ticket that would be a hard sell for me.  The problem is that many feel the Republican Party isn't conservative enough.  Either that will change or, the Republican party will become obsolete.|`|bqJgdcfLaa	I happen to be a big believer in the welfare state, but I am sure the Republicans would be able to fool more people into voting for their blatantly pro-rich, pro-business policies, if they were able to shift their social issue sideshow with the same rate the undecided bloc moves.    Right now the country is half and half on abortion, so drop the anti-abortion shtick and get louder on the anti-gay bit.|`|NktvqJhlaa	So what you're really asking is..would I vote for a republican if they became a democrat? Well Hell NO!|`|ofP7bbX7aa	Being a moderate means you have no principles of your own, you just go with the flow and hope for the best.  No, and not Democrat either.  As far as moderate or liberal, socialism sucks.  If that is what you want move to the UK.  I vote for the person, not some dumb party stuck in the past.  All either party do now is try and blame each other for the mess we are in.  It was moderate wimps in both parties that did not speak up or stand up to the liberals that has cost us billions.  No body is really fixing it, just giving the paybacks to their big campaign donors or helping out the ones they will work for after they leave congress.|`|nM2k6geEaa	No, I was born democrat(a democrat home) but I voted for  Nixon once, and Regan twice, but mostly Democrat.

And it's really sad that you think I'm a bad person because I:    a)   believe in God.  b)  don't believe in raising taxes to pay for government run programs  c)  don't believe in government run health care because it will tie the hands of good doctors.  d)  don't feel that I should have to pay for some girls abortion.  e)  feel that the Bible needs to be put back in school as an elective like Bible Study. {our children's history books teach about Islam, but mention Christianity and they get hit with a lawsuit}    I'm tired of people thinking that all Republicans are rich. My income last year was under $9000. I have MS, a very painful illness which keeps me from working. And I pay for my own health care, NOT welfare or Medicaid.     I don't always vote for my party. I vote for whom I know is more qualified [Obama isn't], McCain wasn't either, it should have been either Romney or Huckabee. But it was the [media] who decided who'd be running for President not us.     Why judge someone one the Political Party they belong too? If I did that, I wouldn't have married my wonderful husband.

You know they used to be conservatives from what I know.|`|Y4GAddyaaa	I would not register as a Republican.  The Republican moderates in office are far and few in between.  The party has been taken over by the Radical Right Social/Religious Conservatives, and of course the racists.     Recent statements by David Duke, a Klansman and Republican regarding Michael Steele's election as RNC Chair:    "I am glad these traitorous leaders of the Republican Party appointed this Black racist, affirmative action advocate to the head of the Republican party because this will lead to a huge revolt among the Republican base. As a former Republican official, I can tell you that millions of rank-and-file Republicans are mad as hell and arent going to take it anymore! We will either take the Republican Party back over the next four years or we will say, To Hell With the Republican Party! And we will take 90 percent of Republicans with us into a New Party that will take its current place!"    I do not want to be party of the Republican Party.  Changing their views to a more moderate stance is going to take a long time.|`|Om7OhWRUaa	I wouldn't register, but I could see myself voting for a Republican candidate.

As I don't choose to make my decision until just before election day, my views are not known at all nor do they have any impact on who wins or loses the primaries. That is why they always say that it is the Independents who often determine the election results. Personally, I think that people should be able to vote for whomever they like, regardless of party. I might pick a Democrat for President, but a Republican for VP etc. I sincerely wish they would do away with party affiliations entirely...and just let the top four vote getters run for pres and vp. Same thing with the senatorial and representative races. The guy who gets the most votes would be President...and the next guy down would get VP.

Unfortunately, it is not practical. It seems that most everything has at least part of it shipped from another country.|`|0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	Good luck with that. First off, so many things are made in other countries that it would be hard to often even find the products that you need made in the US. The other problem is that often American companies will export their labor force overseas while foreign companies will open factories in the US.     For example, is it better to buy a car from the American company GM who has their factories in Mexico, or the Japanese company Toyota who produces their cars in the US?    Third, even if clearly define what is and isn't kosher to buy and the products that people need are available, you are still assuming people will act against their immediate economic interests in the name helping out the country. If such was the case, places like Walmart wouldn't exist.|`|CbeNLpb3aa	Oh - you mean the way this country used to be run when we had great products and high standard of living. Instead of cheap poison crap from china.    The costs to import products when the cost of oil is high adds to the price - if we were producing locally it wouldn't be a factor.    It is practical - but the people running the country are trying to destroy it - not improve it.
bl0RZJrDaa	have you ever wondered why dems want to give amnesty to illegal aliens?    the answer is simple: they want them to become citizen so that illegals can vote for the democrap party      illegal aliens are mostly uneducated, therefore they are easy to manipulate    PS: I couldn't care less if someone gives me thumbs down, feel free to be annoyed with my answer|`|1TJ5v6Xzaa	No.  Democrats will invite anyone in as you vote democrat.|`|E1gKL2fSaa	This is why I am an Independent and not a Republican.

I can only assume that 1) our government is covering up experimental aircraft, or, 2) is less than willing to admit that they can't do shite about it and doesn't want to panic people in an Orwellian/Citizen Kane way, or They merely want to lessen the degree to which they agreed with "them" that it was OK to harvest DNA for their ravaged ecology- either here (in the future) or there. I mean, someone has done a fine job of BS-ing. I still find it difficult to entirely dismiss the testimony of an Iraq veteran- Dr. Jesse Marcelle's who'se father was the intelligence officer at the Roswell base at the time.

VfjjojiAaa	Without a doubt......Go to the air force academy. I went to West Point for a year. It is an amazing experience; however, the Air Force Academy will pay you MUCH MUCH MORE...You will also have somewhat of a civilian life. At the Navy and Army Academy....It is all military 24/7. And you may think you want that now...But you don't   Go Air Force.|`|RbqbQzzcaa	is extremely hard to get accepted into any military academy, i been in the military for 3 and a half years, i joined right after high school and from time to time i regret it. if i could do things different i would have join ROTC and gone to college. you'll probably have more freedom going to college and doing ROTC, then joining any branch in the military that you desire. Most of the people that i know who join the AF Academy hate it, it's pretty much basic training for 4 years, and you'll only get pay about 250 dllrs a month.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	Helpless is full of beans.  All services and academies pay the same.  Check them all out and decide yourself.  AF is definitely the least military that's for sure.|`|4VzVfKvdaa	If the only reason you are looking at the military is for college, then it probably isn't for you.  Also, the military academies have some of the toughest programs of any universities in America.

If he will punish your grade for not agreeing with him... drop the class and take it with another professor.  If he won't punish you, and you can intelligently debate him, then do so.  The professor will likely respect this attribute even if he does not agree with or respect your philosophy.  If you can't debate him and he won't punish you for disagreeing, then shut your mouth, take the class, and get the credits.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	You should stop trolling.

It is a family plan, it is around 300 a month, but there is also payment from work. It also gives every 6 month dental cleaning, and some coverage for eye glasses.

There is no way on Earth that obama will win a 2nd term. Just look at all his goofs and he has only been in office for 2 weeks.   I really think our President in '12 will be Sarah Palin. She is the Ronald Reagan of my generation. I don't know if you heard her State of the State address, but it was great. She knows first hand how to manage an economy.   Obama is another Jimmy Carter, and Sarah will be our Ronald Reagan that saves the USA.  I think a Palin/Jindal ticket would be perfect. I would love it! They both would be younger,than obama/biden, and have more executive experience than both obama/biden (including their 4 years ruining the country).  I don't know if people will care so much about the whole electoral, red, blue state thing. People, as a whole, will just be ready to get rid of obama in 4 years.      Palin/Jindal '12!|`|6ohMYKjnaa	..."She is a very strong candidate who can hit hard on the main issues."...    LOL!!!!!!!!! Are you serious? LOL!!!!!!!!!    Here is a couple of hints for dingbat to work on between now and 2012.    1) Read a f**king newspaper.    2) Learn what the duties of either the President or the Vice President is, according to the U.S. Constitution.    3) Look at a globe. Then the bag of hammers might realize Putin doesn't fly over Alaska on his way to the U.N.  They trace the path ICBM's would fly if launched.They fly up near the North Pole.....IT'S CLOSER!!!!!!!!!!    4) Stop blaming everyone else for your own stupidity. It's not the press's fault that your stupid.....IT'S YOURS!!!!!!!!!!    And  5)..."Ya betcha"...Learn how to speak f**king ENGLISH!!!!!!!!!! After 8 years of folksy stupidity from Bush, we don't need another illiterate DIP$HIT in the White House!!!!!|`|jlXPsVfdaa	For the love of God, anyone but Sarah Palin.    Sarah Palin represents many of the bad tendencies of the Republican Party and has complete disdain among suburban voters.|`|D8SpQAgLaa	Sarah Palin will be old news by 2012. She'll be in the same category as Ralph Nader. The GOP will have a new candidate by then. Historically, most presidents have been state governors so it would most likely be a governor of one of the other 49 states who hasn't run for president/vice president before. Make a list of the other GOP state governors and the next GOP candidate is probably on that list. I don't think Sarah Palin will be on the GOP ticket in 2012.|`|xoK87yuGaa	Dems dream:   We want Palin! You go girl, 2012 Yeah!      To bad she will only attract the ignorant far right. Real republicans will look elsewhere for a real republican candidate!|`|8PCriC7Vaa	Who ever is most deranged in the party. Palin and Todd work for  British Petroleum, so they have a shot. Arnie ran California into the ground, so he's a contender, and years later New Orleans is still a disaster, so Jindal looks good.|`|NqNbIp2caa	I could not imagine a more delightful situation than Palin as the candidate. She embarrassed herself once ensuring a Dem win - why not again.    If the Republicans have any brains they will listen to moderate America and encompass than thinking with a moderate candidate (don't say McCain was a moderate - he was forced to lurch to the right to gain the nomination and then pick an extremist as a running mate).  Michael Steele's appointment as Chairman of the RNC suggests this may just be possible.  However the reaction of the right wing has been negative so it could be that a counterblow throws the party even further to the right - in which case an extremist candidate such as those you suggest could come through.|`|YIWKPXokaa	Yes    I pray for it.      Dems for Sarah Palin  2012.|`|0lV2C78xaa	I believe Palin is an idiot.    I do like Jindal. I'm a liberal who lives in Louisiana and I would support Jindal in 2012 should Obama fail.|`|Ef9zLkOTaa	Palin - She had what 2 mis quotes and was trashed for it while Obama got away with many misquotes... She is a brilliant women who has more experience then Obummer.  She understand small government, low taxes, and Values..  She had just as much National security experience then Obama... Obama had 1 sub committee for Afghanistan that never met.  Palin currently has the highest approval rating of any US official.    Jindal - Could defiantly run in 2012.  Strong Conservative from Louisiana.    Thompson - He will probably tip his hat into it again just because he got into the race so late last time.    Ron Paul - Will run just because the Internet nut jobs believes he is the answer...    --------------------------------------...    Anyone who says Palin is stupid is clearly uninformed.  Just because someone misquotes over the TV/Interview doesn't mean they are not intelligent.  She is a human being not a robot.  She didn't have prerequisite questions like Obama.  I misquote all the time on just the phone at my job...    Unlike Most retarded sheeple... I don't care how she sounds in an interview or press conference but her actions when it time to get down to business.  When she is passing bills and executive orders that will help this country....  Notice her actions in Alaska.  She is holding off all new state government employment to help her state.|`|AA12187979	The governer of Alaska is a smaller job then the govner of Arkansas.  The New York City police department has a bigger budget,---    Alaska has the biggest natural resources to fund its goverment, oil and pork from DC so they make no big decisions, and she's good looking and a dizbat we all want to hump.    So she's a shoe in.|`|b3640707e483a3b444b16b298a3378aeaa	There are millions who believe that Governor Palin did not acquit herself in the least during her recent candidacy for vice president. She might be able to learn some things about national and international issues, but her appeals to some of our worst elements in 2008 (the terrorist remarks about Obama) no doubt forced many to write her off for good. All she did was energize the far right, and that is no way to win a national election.    I don't think she could head up a winning campaign on a national level. You'd be playing from behind instantly, along the lines of Dan Quayle's candidacy.     I would guess the GOP would have to come in with someone of a much different generation to give the party a new look. And my guess is, we will have barely heard of the 2012 Republican candidate.    (Oh, California is going to be first in electoral votes for years to come. And don't blame the media for her portrayal completely. She was unprepared for her visit to the national stage, and showed it with her response to easy questions like the one from Katie Couric.)
qwaWd14vaa	NOS is illegal to have because of the misuse of the product.  Drag racing events sponsor NOS in some races.  A blue smoke is usually cloudier then the normal oil valve smoke see by a race car.  Superchargers, Blowers, Turbos, all are legal to have.  A turbo, blower etc will produce a very high whine as the gears mesh and send out a whine like a Big rig sounds at 50 mph and shifting the gears on the granny box.|`|AA10206116	I'm not sure about NOS, but turbochargers and superchargers are completely legal.    -----------------------    The only thing turbochargers and superchargers do is increase the cold air going through the intake manifold. There is nothing illegal about that.|`|emNCaAq7aa	Yes, Nox is illegal (in my state) to use in the vehicle or inhale without a doc or dentist. Not turbo's by themselves.   When they see you accelerate at 3 g's they can guess. In fact it is probable cause for a search.|`|AA11694451	Nitrous Oxide (or NOS as you put it) is not street legal in most states/municipalities. Turbo chargers (like Super Chargers) are street legal in most cases.    As for how does a cop know? Well super and turbo chargers give off a distinct sound when spooled up. Nitrous injection kits also give off a distinct sound when firing. Either way a cop is mainly looking at the obvious...How the driver is driving.|`|dTaBXqjyaa	Turbochargers and Superchargers are legal. Aslong as your car passes emission testing (if required in your state) then it is perfectly fine.  NOS is illegal, reason being is that its like an extra boost of gas and when you have it installed in your car, if you car was to catch fire the tank would explode and you might have a chance to get out of your car in time. Basically its like the speed of your car, you should only do 100km/h on the highway, you have the option to go faster but if you do, you risk a ticket, but with NOS you risk your life and other peoples lives around you. Turbochargers and Superchargers have things called BLOW OFF VALVES (BOV) which produce a whistling sound when you let go of the gas pedal which identifies you as having either one. The only way for a cop to see if you have NOS is to see the bottle in your car or if they pop your hood and see the lines connected. At the race track it is legal to use NOS aslong as you display '' N '' with an arrow pointing where the bottle is on your window. Some cars with NOS produce a flame that comes out of the exhaust and your car makes a lot of noise and smoke to identify you have it.|`|MWHJqVavaa	Considering cars come stock with turbos, they're obviously legal. My car says TURBO on the back of it and I've only been pulled over for wearing my seatbelt incorrectly.
oAWEcd5Qaa	Contact the Oregon attorney generals office,and since they took your money and you have proof,it may be a good idea to contact portland police and file a report.The more paper work you can deliver to an attorney the better your case.Good luck|`|Qou0CLwiaa	Hmm interesting.    First, to your main question: if this was a corporate chain, then take it up with corporate. They surely have policies against refusing rooms based on disabilities, including perceived disabilities. They will probably offer you a refund, a voucher for several nights stay, and then go about reminding everyone of the policy and maybe offering specific training related to your diagnosis. All that seems fair based on  your story to me -I'd take the deal and move on.    Finally, if you don't get satisfaction on the refund immediately, take it up with your CC company and dispute the charges. That will take care of that - the CC company will deal with it.    Still, given that you experienced issues at other places the same night, is it possible that something else was going on? Maybe too much or too little meds, or reaction to something else you took, even unintentionally? Is this worth discussing with your doctor to see what might have happened, some new side effect you haven't seen before, or some other signal of change in your diagnosis?|`|AA10620879	You do not mention what state this was in? First this sounds like a scam that the hotel/motel is doing by charging your credit card when you were there and refuse to let you stay. That  I would report it to your credit card company. Next notify the State Attorney General of the State's Consumer Protection Agency and the BBB.  Next contact the main or corporate office of the hotel/motel and file a complaint. You might also want to contact the media as one thing they do not like is negative publicy. Check with the ACLU as far as legal issues.   http://www.aclu.org/

However, if someone is attacking you, you are just as likely to kill them with your shotgun then an assault rifle.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	Obama isn't anti gun.

If you go to any other country in the world , good luck because they make no accommodations for you because you speak English . You are on your own , but we do not want people in America of any nationality have to do such things as pay taxes and or draw social security or any thing else that might prevent them from drawing a check and making good wages . That would be inhumane . We can't do that .
AA11615216	The same exact thing is happening to my best friend currently.  She went to go get help, but because he already filed with his chain of command that she cheated on him (which she didn't) they are taking his side and she is getting no help.  She has gone to JAG, FRG, and even petitioned her congressmen, and there is nothing they can do.  All they have said is get your direct deposit changed and get a civilian attorney.  He had an attorney show up at their house telling her she has to be off the property by March 1st! My husband told me that he is having an affair with another soldier. Are you friends with any of the guys who are over there with him? Can you find out from them if anything is going on? But you need to go get a civilian attorney that has dealt with military issues.  Its really sad when this happens, but you need to be ready if your served.  Go talk to an attorney tomorrow and get legal advice.|`|ABmZYbDZaa	Well for one why are you having a cow over him   possibly having a whole two beers? It's not like they are getting 4 six packs to drink, it's TWO stupid little beers. Also, just because it was on the news that they had them it doesn't mean that he drank them. Do you hear what I am saying to you?  The units OFFERED them to the troops (to ALL the troops over there), there is nothing says that they had to drink them. So, basically he could be telling you the truth. and it is totally possible that he did NOT drink the beers that where offered to them regardless of what's on the news. One thing you obviously haven't learned yet is that just because it's on the news doesn't mean that it's fact or that it effects your unit. This is a prime time for you to learn that.      As for the joint checking he can NOT remove you without your signature unless he has divorce papers.     He can remove you from his SGLI and is not required to leave it to you.     It sounds and I'm just spit balling here but that he's acting out because you're on his *** for things that he isn't doing while he's 2000 miles away being shot at. Ease off of him some. Who cares if he has 2 beers, they are not patrolling after wards and they are not breaking any regs so just let it be. He probably felt like you where attacking him so he attacked back. Just lay off ,let him calm down and then try and talk about things.    ETA: I have to call BS. There is NO way in hell he has that in his room. The situation is that they have to drink them IN the DFAC and are only given TWO each.|`|AA10206116	He cannot take you off a joint account unless you specifically see a banker and sign a release form.|`|63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	I know all branches have stateside representatives to aid spouses when there is a problem.

My husband and I have a joint account and that is the information the bank gave me. I would give him some space and see if he calms down and comes to his senses, it just sounds like he is over reacting about something stupid which i have found is very common among military men. I would call your bank in the morning just to double check, and you need to get in contact with his chain of command if he keeps this behavior up. And in all honesty he cant keep all the money for himself you are his dependent and there isn't much he can do from overseas any way. Hope this helps a little.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	You probably want to have a long conversation with him.  Being deployed is very stressful to some people and problems at home make it worse.  More than likely he is just venting.    As for him taking you off of the checking account; if it is a joint account he can't take you off it without your consent or some type of court order.  He can take you off of the SGLI but if he leaves you with no support it will not go well with his chain of command.  He is required to support you while you and him are married.

Qou0CLwiaa	I disagree with the first two answers that free or bartered lessons are loopholes in a non-compete.     the issue is not if she is getting paid, it is if she is competing with the prior employer. If you stop paying them and you are working with her, that is clearly an attempt to take the farm's customers away.    why not ask the farm for their suggestion on how to proceed? Maybe the nature of everybody's relationship with each other can allow for a compromise in an individual case. One possible compromise might revolve around your agreeing to not have any lessons at all for a period of time, say 90 days, so that you can be said to not be a student at the farm when you go to the new school headed by the old teacher.    Alternatively, the teacher would have to make a legal claim that the contract prevents her from making a living in her chosen field, which is not true as the second poster pointed out, and it would take maybe years to reach a legal settlement anyway, which doesn't help you at all.|`|Yzcptoagaa	That's a non-compete clause.  They are not always enforced, but because this one refers only to students of that particular farm, it probably is enforceable.    Are you paying her for lessons?  If she was a teacher at the farm and took you and your regular payments with her when she left, then she probably is violating her non-compete.    There's no reason you can't still ride together as long as you aren't paying for lessons.|`|Vg43CvEPaa	Yes, do not pay her in cash for the lessons. Try other ways of compensating for her efforts.

RRFbDou9aa	It depends on where the person is shot.  If they are shot in the torso or head odds are there would be no exit wound and the only blood would be what oozes from the entry wound.  If the person is shot in a spot narrow enough for an exit wound there might be spatters, but it also depends on the type of bullet.  A 22 LR with a jacket is going to go pretty cleanly through, whereas a 22 short hollow point is going to be messy.|`|xEOzWSkvaa	Always? No.  Unless you hit the same spot every time and they make the same movement, then yes.   Here is info on Blood projection.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodstain_...      If you are worried about blood, maybe look into a taser gun.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser_gun|`|ftELrRJraa	It would depend on the part of body struck.  A small caliber hole like a .22 would be less likely to cause blood spatter (it's not splatter) than a .45.  Caliber alone will not dictate blood loss, position of body and location of shot to the body all contribute.|`|RISkBw1aaa	Not if you shoot them in the head because the slug isn't strong enough to exit the skull after entering it so it basically turns the brain into a mushy mess that no medical examiner wants to deal with.

The BNP do not oppose reasonable immigration and have never done so. They do oppose mass immigration. At one time the majority of immigrants were black and of course this stood out to the Native community, so the opposition was basically towards the ending of immigration for the swarms of black people entering the country.  Now the majority of immigrants are white so what seemed opposition to black people is now aimed at the numbers of white people entering our country. In other words the word racialism is a word used against the BNP without warrant as the BNP are against mass immigration full stop.    The BNP are the peoples party whatever class you feel yourself to be in and quite frankly the mainstream parties feel absolutely threatened by the people of this country rejecting mainstream hypocrisy.

Yzcptoagaa	There are no constitutional restraints on who can be a federal judge.  Practically speaking, a judicial candidate should at minimum be licensed to practice law, in good standing, and have fairly substantial legal experience.    Federal judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  When it comes to Circuit and District Judges, the President usually gets suggested candidates from the senators affiliated with that state or circuit.    Most federal judges were previously state judges, federal prosecutors, Justice Department big wigs, or partners at prestigious law firms who made political connections.|`|AA11847612	1 - Bribe a politician.|`|CowgOqXTaa	None.

Keep in mind that nothing about the military is easy, and the process with require a lot of work on your part (of course, some of this depends on what exactly you will be doing). But if you can handle it, then you end up serving your country are paying for school!|`|llEdx8Q2aa	I think if it is just for the monetary reward you should look at more options like loans where you do not pay until you graduate so you can save up while in school and scholarships.

As for it being the only way, no that is not true. Have you tried applying for scholarships? The library will have a book on all available scholarships. It may take some time and effort on your part but it may pay off in the end.   There is also the option of student loans (painful and you end up owing when you get done but less worrisome in the beginning).    If you see the military as YOUR last resort I suggest you look into a 4 year enlistment and not 6. Also think carefully of which branch you join. The National Guard may seem safest but they go to war also. There is also the reservists for all branchs, and the Coast Guard usually only sends volunteers to war zones.    There are always options.|`|EEkg0JVSaa	Yeah go for it.|`|AA10495484	Worst reason ever.  I joined the reserves for the same reason and i am now a 25 year old freshman.

93M8Vccvaa	No, your rights were not violated. The police had every right to come into the house without a warrant. You said you were first arrested for resisting arrest. You were probably arrested for underage drinking first. Then when you decided not to comply with the police requests you were then charged with resisting. The police did what they had to do to bring the situation under control.|`|AA10123414	No, your rights were not violated:  1. they don't need your permission to go past the gate.  2. They can enter the house if they see or have probable cause that a crime is being committed. The only thing they need a warrant for is to search the house. Does not sound like a search was conducted.  3. Instead of sitting down you argued with the officer. That is resisting arrest. While you did not admit it, I am sure you struggled with them one you were pushed to the ground.  4. They do not have to read you your rights to arrest you. they only have to read you your rights before they question you.    You should hire a lawyer.|`|hyqf7xR0aa	hire a lawyer. simple as that.|`|RRFbDou9aa	First of all you left out the entire part between 'sitting down' and getting tasered and pepper sprayed.  I think a lot of the answer lies in that part.  People don't get tasered and sprayed for no reason.     If they tightened the cuffs on purpose you have a legitimate complaint to make to the department.  However, keep in mind even if the cuffs are on correctly they're going to hurt; they're not built for comfort they're built for control.    They don't have to read you your rights or answer your questions as to whether or not you're under arrest.  Entering the house without a warrant is legal under many circumstances but again you didn't post enough information to make a judgment on it.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Yes, you were a complete angel and cops were way out of line. For no reason at all they abused you and arrested you, even though you were on your way to church.    I bet if you could watch a video of the incident and see what really happened, you would recind this question.    It's amazing to me how drunk people think they do nothing wrong and just can't fathom how they could be in trouble.     You did the crime, take your punishment and quit making ridiculous excuses. You claim this in court, which of course, every drunk person does, you're going to get stiffer fines for insulting the court.    Learn how to handle your liquor or better yet, don't drink anymore and say way from other felons.|`|AA11117367	Yes, your rights were definitely violated, and the moron who said "Just do what the cops said" ISN'T listening, and must be a COP. My sister was a cop, and her husband as well. My sister was a kind considerate person, and law enforcement officer, her husband, and band of illiterate brothers were not. At the parties I would attend, they would brag about abusing citizens, the very citizens they are commissioned to serve and protect. This idiot brother in law, cheated on my dying sister, who had incurable brain cancer. He couldn't wait, two weeks, honor my sister with fidelity, let her pass on, then get his jollies.  Also, I'm a medical professional, and on one occasion, called the police to escort my daughter out of her mothers house to get a tetanus shot (she had stepped on nail that penetrated so deeply, that the 2X4 the nail was in, lifted up with her foot). According to the law, this was a criminal matter, and listed as such in the annotated code. When the deputies arrived, they didn't want to get involved, said it was a civil matter, (the crime was not providing medical attention for a minor, this is my field of expertise). Suddenly, the officers became medical experts, and would not help me. I asked for their names and badge numbers, which I got. I called their sergeant, but, in the midst of doing so, they came a knocking on the window of my car, and asked me to move 200ft, I did, and more. They then informed me that I needed to call Family Services, because they were not going to help. Again, in the midst of calling, they rapped on the window again. This time, as they were chatting amongst themselves, they said "we have to charge him with something?" So, they started to make things up. They grabbed me, while I was on the phone, and started to try and pull me through the window. I'm over 6 ft and a solid 280lbs, it wasn't going to happen. Did I mention that I have post-traumatic stress disorder? Well they triggered an episode. They maced me too, I sped off, and went a block. I got out my car, in scrubs only, a deputy pointed her gun at me. I told her go a head and shoot, because I was unarmed, and I put my hands behind my back and bent over the trunk of my car. That wasn't good enough, I had to get on my knees, but, they wanted  even more, they wanted me to lie down flat, being in a flashback, I could go only to my knees then I froze. Finally, I heard, "get the taser", so I allowed the deputies to have my arm, but, no, they had to act like an upset five year old, and smash my face into the asphalt and dislocate my shoulder.   When it was all said and done, the sergeant, gets in my face and asks me how many officers did I think it took, to get me to the ground? He said seven. I thought, maybe they ought to invest in a nautilus gym or something.  When it came time for court, who showed up? NO ONE.     All charges were dismissed.    Hmm, if only they would have allowed me to take my daughter and get her a tetanus shot.    I took the matter to their captain, she said the case is closed, period. I then went to internal affairs, showed the sergeant my evidence, and was told that my case was solid. As fate would have it, that very captain, who I first took my complaint to, was promoted to head of IA. She ordered the apologetic sergeant to close the case. Hey, if you have to win by cheating, you must not be very good at what you do.  When, I work the ER, if their are cops around, they always make a bad situation worse, whereas if we just have the paramedics, we have a lot fewer problems. This cop machismo, nonsense has got to stop, we do not live in Old Russia, or the Old Germany.   In Holland where I lived, part of the policeman's job is good PR. They don't have guns, tasers or even billy clubs in many cases.   Where, I live (the metropolitan area), we have had several domestic disputes, which ended up with the cops outside and a severely disturbed husband on the inside, with a gun. The police are so inept, that out of five cases, all five ended in suicide. If the cops just turned off their ego, and testosterone, maybe they could see they're dealing with people, not animals, like themselves.|`|AWSmknxLaa	stop drinking and do as the police order|`|txwfTZBHaa	Get a really good Lawyer|`|1286cbbdaec7b88444188ebc8781d6d6aa	You had no business drinking.

G4Y96LGqaa	Its a right!    And it was Thomas Jefferson I think who said "Fear a government who fears your guns"     You have the right to protect yourself from predators.     In 1936, a socialist guy got into power and promised loads of entitlements and way out of economic ruin, but first he wanted to register all weapons. Then, in 1937, he had a group from the government go door to door retrieving those weapons. Next he terrorized the entire nation with fear and the SS. His name was Hitler.     If you eliminated all guns, the common home owner couldn't defend himself, and to rely on the police is suicide.  A black market on weapons would get even bigger than is already is. Even if you took all guns away, the only one who would have guns would be the bad guys!  Drugs are illegal and yet we still have those? Criminals still get guns, even if they have a felony. If there is a need for it, someone will figure out a way to get it.     Guns are Only a tool, by themselves they harm nobody. I can just as easily push some one out a window 10 stories up or crush their skull in with a hammer. More people are killed each year from automobile accidents, do you want to get rid of cars now?  you can't protect everyone, and certainly their are a few bad apples out there. But taking away a right from every who obeys the law will only help those who don't!|`|SGyRIjCIaa	Please see: "The US Constitution - 2nd amendment"    And plus, if you allow people to kill innocent babies then we can own our guns. Far more deaths occur from abortion than from one person owning a gun. 1.37 million abortions per year in the US > 31,000 firearm violence related deaths per year. (Stat doesn't include suicide, as "Suicides accounted for 55 percent of the nation's nearly 31,000 firearm deaths in 2005, the most recent year for which statistics are available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention." And I believe if someone wants to commit suicide then the availability of the gun doesn't matter.)    If people are allowed to smoke around me, then yeah I can have a gun - they are harming me are they not? If people are allowed to drink alcohol and then carelessly drive on the same roads I use - then I can have a gun because that is dangerous to me as well. We have the right to self defense. If someone wants to go out and kill - they will find a weapon even if guns aren't available. What are you all going to call for next - the outlawing of all knives, "all cutlery must be plastic"?

For example, D.C. had a strict "no guns" policy for years, while at the same time being the murder capital of the U.S.     We already tried something similar with Prohibition. Supposedly, alcohol was the root of all evil, kind of like guns are now. What happened? A massive underground trade of alcohol flourished, and the illegal alcohol trade played a large part in how the gangsters of the 20's made their money. So, basically, people had alcohol anyway, just like they'd get guns anyway.    There are a lot of people, especially rural folks, who depend upon hunting to feed their families. The only other option besides a gun would be a bow and arrow or something. But in my state, those are outlawed as well.    Besides, if people can't use a gun, they can always use a knife, a wrench, a pipe, make homemade bombs, etc. The bottom line is that even if you eliminated guns, a person who's intent upon murder and violence is going to figure out some other way of doing it.|`|AA10314474	Perhaps just as some fervently put Free Speech as a cornerstone of our democracy, the same passion could be expressed in the willingness to not only speak of democracy, but to put ones life at the ready to protect it.

lf5NEDuYaa	I think your chances are very good.     1. he is not paying child support.. When you take him to court to modify the divorce decree he is going to get into trouble for that.  2. your are relocating for work.  3. It is only 100 miles away he can still see his kids it is just an hour an a half drive.  4. Your job is telling you you must in order to retain employment.     Contact an attorney and tell them your situation and get the ball rolling. I don't know what kind of relationship you have with your ex but informing him that because he is not paying child support he is going to want to avoid appearing before a judge might be enough to get him to agree to the move and you would not have to involve the courts. The courts almost always side with the mother anyway so you have that on your side too..

As you doubtless realize, going active duty is a possibility, and attending college down the road.  If you go in under the college first program, there are several things you may wish to consider....    1.  When attending BCT + AIT, you receive the same benefits and pay as active duty personal.    2.  After completing BCT + AIT, you may qualify for the GI Bill. (Drill Pay + GI Bill =$600++ A month)    3.  Many National Guard programs MAY pay for ALL of your tuition.    4. You may wish to consider joining ROTC.  Depending upon the school, a ROTC scholarship may cover ALL of your on campus housing cost.  By being enrolled in the SMP program, you will earn over $1500 a month in the third, and forth years of ROTC.

TdE0J2xVaa	Due to an amendment in 1996 to the Social Security Act, alcohol addiction, by itself, cannot be the basis for a disability determination for social security benefits.  On March 29, 1996, President Clinton signed the "Contract with America Advancement Act." Section 105 of the Act prohibits the receipt of Social Security Disability benefits or Supplemental Security Income benefits if drug addiction and/or alcoholism is material to the finding of disability. This means that if addiction is the person's only or primary disability, they are not eligible for benefits.    If a claimant has another source of disability and secondarily happens to be a drug or alcohol addict, the claimant is still eligible if the other source of disability meets Administration criteria. Further, if the claimant now has a disabling condition meeting Administration criteria caused by life-long addiction, the claimant may still be eligible. For example, if the claimant now has pancreatitis due to years of heavy drinking, the claimant can still collect.|`|808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	Ok first I do feel bad for you or the person you are talking about..alcoholism is a bad disease ...I live in MN and you can get it here, though I don't agree with it, you have to call ss disability office and file and see what happens.

There are nearly as many different jobs in the service as there are in civilian life.  Electronics, mechanics and engineering are all jobs that do not involve a lot of sit down time.  But the military has its share of paperwork.  If you are going to "serve" do not start by putting demands on what you will or will not do.  Normally overseas assignments are tours usually of 6 or 7 months.  But they can and do have assignments that last longer and they insist that you do what ever they want    I found my service in the Marine Corps to be very beneficial and one of the best decisions I have every made.|`|CdBdP2ymaa	You are already homesick my little friend...You haven't even joined yet!

When I enlisted in the Corps, you could opt for a 6 year QEP program.  You also will have IRR time, etc. so it really depends.     Your MOS options are pretty much determined by your ASVAB scores.  Study the ASVAB book (you can get one at the library) and don't gaff it off.      Don't go with the Army.  The Brother (Sister) hood of the Corps is unmatched.

My brother is a Marine Reserve and he signed for 6 years in the Marines, but 4 years are reserve and 2 years are active. His last 2 years are active. You can be deployed anywhere from 6 months to a year. A year is the most I've heard but some Marines stay longer. If you like the Marine life, you can re-enlist when your contract is over. And you can enlist anytime you want...just talk to your recruiter about it. My brother enlisted and about 2 or 3 months after he enlisted he shipped out for boot. So you don't go to boot right after you enlist [if that's what you're talking about.] And when you're at boot, you're going to have to LEARN about the Marines, and memorize a lot of things, on top of that do A LOT of PT, but if joining the Marines is something you want, then you should join.|`|KtwXqIYHaa	it all depends, first off the contract is going to be 8 years unless you can find a way to get it less, good luck. Do you want to go active or reserve, active duty you will be active for 4 yrs and then inactive for another 4 at which they can call you back if they want you. Reserves you are active for 6 yrs and then inactive for 2 yrs, that also depends on your MOS school. Some are very long some arent at all. If you want to go into the military it all comes down to you of when you want too. Basically spend the time over the summer and then goto the recruiters. Now for trying to find something good to do in the military to help you out later in life that depends on your asvap score also. The asvap breaks down into a few different scores which i cant remember what they exactly are. Certain jobs you have to meet certain scores, so you wanna make sure you can get a high score on the asvap if you want something that will pay well on the civilian side. You wont deploy until you completed all your training to do the job your supposed to do, also if you are active dont expect to be home. Active duty means 24/7 so your going to be stationed at some base, now it could be close to home but it depends on where they want to put you for the most part. If you go reserves you stay active until you complete all that training then you go inactive and check into your reserve unit where you become an active reserve thats drilling, basically meaning you have to do your 1 weekend a month stuff. Marines are a tough branch, the army will prolly offer more jobs but it really comes down to what you want to do in the military. Civilian side you might want to kinda worry about that towards the end of your service or prep for it. Once your in the military you will have alot of stuff to do to better yourself and get promoted in the military. Its a career that has alot in it. It is def. worth joining if you truely want to do that and got what it takes.

MERS assets include portable radio towers, repeaters and radios; multiple portable KU Band satellite systems and satellite telephones to help officials in areas where cellular towers are inoperative.    FEMA also has deployed its Incident Response Vehicle, technicians, and radio/repeater equipment to construct a radio network capable of providing communications.    "This is an amazing effort and we have worked long hours to move supplies and equipment. Our working partnership with FEMA ensures we are getting excellent help under difficult circumstances for Kentuckians suffering from the winter storm," said Gen. John W.

The states damaged the worst by the ice storm are all conservative--largely filled with small towns full of people "cling(ing) to guns or religion," according to Obama--and McCain carried each and every one of these states in the last election.    If Obama truly meant everything he said in his campaign speeches, the ones filled with talk of hope and change and being a President for all Americans, he would have immediately been on a plane to check out the devastation for himself. But Obama knows the people in this area of the country did not vote for him and generally do not support his policies, so frankly, they don't matter to him.  I believe if we had seen a disaster in Obama's home state of Illinois or a state such as California where his politics and policies have widespread support, I think we would have seen a much different response.  Once again, a sad portrait of our President's character--or lack thereof.

AA10829482	Once your friend gets done with basic training and tech school, she'll have OJT to do.  However, during that time, she's getting a paycheck, benefits and 3 hots and a cot.      After she's done with the OJT, she can go to school and the AF will pay 100% of her tution.  She'll have her GI Bill for a bachelor's or a master's if that's what she wants.|`|tHKRgH8Baa	I would say just about 100%. The military has all sorts of programs in place to send troops to school, it's up to them to take advantage of them. Just by graduating from tech school she's going to gain credits towards a degree in an accredited college. She will be given 100% tuition assistance while on active duty and not to mention the GI Bill. The GI Bill was recently redesigned and starting this August, offers some amazing benefits. http://www.gibill.va.gov/pamphlets/CH33/...  Be happy for your friend, she's making a choice for her future. Whether or not she takes advantage of her opportunities is up to her but I recommend you support her all the way.|`|jXs6CtWNaa	The military is all about education, they pay for all of it and work actively with you to help you finish your degree|`|wEOJyEw0aa	only if she she is in the Reserve and then if her unit gets deployed she will have to put school on hold she could go in to the Medical field and get it free in the service but for sure they won't put the service on hold for her school|`|lfTYDSmDaa	She will most likely have to go to boot camp and then the schools for whatever her job is while  she's in the Air Force. After she finishes those schools she will go to her first real assignment. When she's there she may be able to go to school; depending on the availability of funds for college for active duty personnel. So it could be 6 months to a year before she starts going back to school. I was in the Navy for four years and had to go through the same thing.|`|KtwXqIYHaa	Military wants you to better yourself through education all the way around. You can even goto college fulltime while serving in the military but i think that depends on branch, and i believe you have to keep a 90 average.

OHfZFR31aa	If you have an MBA, you will have enough points to qualify under the Tier 1 visa http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/workin...    You do not have to have a job before you arrive, but you do need to find a job after you arrive in order to renew your visa. If you are laid off or become disabled or otherwise unable to work, you are not eligible for any state benefits    But it's really the wrong time to be looking for jobs in London. There are over 2.3 million unemployed in the UK and that's expected to rise to 3 million by next year. And Sales and Marketing jobs tend to pay more in NY than they do in London once you take the exchange rate into account. It's worth looking on sites like monster.co.uk to get an idea what's out there as well as salary levels.

I do give you credit for separating paragraphs - usually these long rants don't have that and are very unreadable.

g3h42biwaa	Hey, I just went through a custody hearing (it's no fun, and i feel for you)  I think what you need to know is you can never be too prepared. Whatever documents, emails, or statements proving you are this child's primary caretaker are helpful. You may not end up showing them to a judge, but in case things need to be all laid out and things get nasty, take what you feel will help you win your case. I also had a lawyer, i know it's expensive but he/she will really fight for you, and your child to stay together. Unless your ex-boyfriend can prove you to be unfit, which is very hard to prove, no one is going to take a child away from it's mother. Family courts seem to favor the mother in our society. Your ex will probably be given visitation since he seems to be in and out of the childs life (the judge will decide if they should be supervised) and he will most likely have to pay child support to you.    I had such a hard time when I went through it. I hope you remain strong, being a mom makes you so important, remember that.   Good Luck! God Bless!|`|loy04C98aa	Take anything and everything that you have that shows what you are doing to care for your child.  You never know what will be important or what will resonate with the judge.    Take all the records.  Print all the e-mails and put them in order.  Take all the logs you kept.    Take it all.  You can never have to much information.  If you have financial records, take them.      Good luck.|`|dH6lBcGlaa	Remember not to talk too much about how you feel about your ex, your dislike of him, etc. Judges don't want to hear that stuff, all they care about is who the better parent is, etc. Don't even mention his parents, they are irrelevant, and the judge will say so.      Bring the emails, etc, but I'm not sure if you need the logs from your pregnancy, might be irrelevant too.     Good luck..
AA10163820	Whoa.  You need to work on your facts, methinks.    When you say "Fauls Arrest," are you talking about a false arrest...that being an arrest which was made without probable cause?    And if you are, maybe you can explain the connection you see between a false arrest and/or wrongful imprisonment and any kind of suit, be it counter or otherwise.      Also, I don't know what state you're asking this from, but if you can actually show that a "large" portion of the fines from DUI's are going into the coffers of the same people who are making those arrests, I'd like to apply now.  I think perhaps you want to do a little more research on how fines from criminal convictions are distributed before you start pointing the finger at law enforcement.    And you are aware, of course, that nobody pays any fines at all until they're found guilty of something, right?  That means a judge or jury listens to the evidence against the accused, the accused is allowed to question every single piece of that evidence, and then the trier of fact gets to decide if the accused is guilty or not.  Your question makes it sound like the cops say someone is guilty of DUI and that person is automatically fined and the money goes straight back to the cops.    The rest of your question is nonsense.|`|c30166373f799ccf3b6182600c682717aa	The money obtained through DUI fines/court costs/Rule 8 does not go straight to the hands of those who write the citations.    In our county, the monies received are divided between many different "funds" (used loosely).  Examples are:  Domestic Violence Awareness, Law Enforcement Training, Victims Recovery Fund - but these monies are yes, also put into the funds for Law Enforcement (officers paychecks) but not as much as you think.      How do you think Judges, Court Clerks, Jailers, etc. are paid?    P.S.  You need a warrant to enter a house and bust the meth lab and there is always some Joe willing to flip and do a buy in order to stay out of jail.....Just some food for thought.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Fauls arrest?

fKFvzlzQaa	I recommend that you interview several attorneys who defend DWI charges.    Most attorneys will talk to you about your case for 15 to 20 minutes at no charge.'    This will give you a good idea of whether you have an effective defense or not.    If it appears that you have an effective defense, I recommend that you evaluate each attorney as if he were applying for a job and hire the attorney that you think is best.    Thank you for your service.    I wish you all the best.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Not as bad as the second and it does not matter that you are a good guy and a Marine veteran.  It is a whole lot more than an expensive traffic ticket.  In my state, California, it will end up costing you about $25,000 in fines, lawyer fees, alcohol counseling fees and seven years of sky high insurance premiums.|`|afcd7d949de4a5073f2fc8e97bc1bdcfaa	Try to get out of it. The rule of thumb is a DWI will affect your life for the next five years in many ways.  If you can get it reduced for $1000, its a bargain.|`|fWrygrgMaa	It depends on where you live and what status DWI is and its punishment. If it's a class-A misdemeanor or higher you should definitely hire an attorney. Yes the lawyer is expensive but it can be worth it. Look up the offense for your State, learn how the law views DWI. In Illinois for example DWI is a felony (like rape or murder) and carries a criminal and civil part. There is an automatic 6 month license suspension as the civil part, just for being arrested without having been found guilty of anything. Then there's a $250 fee to get the license reinstated, it isn't automatic. The criminal part entails a fine and/or jail and a mandatory breath tester to be installed on the vehicle, assuming you don't go to jail. The second offense is more severe. This is not a simple speeding ticket. It is serious business. It is in your best interest to force the government to find you guilty. Never admit guilt. Even if an attorney costs as much as the fines it's worth it to try avoiding a criminal conviction record. The law doesn't care who or what you are. Like barstool5000 says, there's some science to the evidence, and there's gray area regarding effectiveness of the testing methods. There is also paperwork that must be in order. An attorney knows these 'holes' and can examine your case looking for ways out.|`|aTLiaEGxaa	This will vary from state to state but if this is your first offense you may be offered a diversion program. If you complete the classes (there are costs involved) the charges will be dropped on the first offense.|`|qwaWd14vaa	Are you still in the Corps? In 1988, the military put a ban on DUI, one and you were out? No tolerance so is this going to effect your career?  I would always fight a DUI as much as possible.(Insurance, License, registration etc are not bad for an effect on the first one, but; when is number two coming and if it is within 5 years, some states have a problem with that?)  Your call Gunny.|`|9y0wrLZ5aa	Pay a lawyer.  There is a lot of science associated with the offense of DWI.  DO NOT just take the fine.  You need the lawyer to tell you the consequences of pleading guilty to the charge.  Here in Texas, a DWI conviction leads to state surcharges starting at $1000/yr for 3 years just to keep your license.    PLUS, if you take a conviction, next time may be more serious because they may use your first one to enhance the penalty for subsequent violations.

All our government wants to do is tax, tax, tax and then tax some more.       They give the money to cronies and special interests, and squander the rest on just about anything they can think of.

The Liberal government stayed in power for a long time using fear tactics-reporting that the Conservatives were "american style".  Canadians love to hate Americans so it was an effective tool.  Canada has also stayed under the Americans protective umbrella as well, (whether they want to admit it or not)  No country would dare attack Canada because they would be in essence attacking the US, so Canadians were safe and smug.   Obama will change all of that, he will "soften" America and make it less secure.  The US and Canada have differing political parties in power now. There will be less harmony.  But this will soon change.  The US media is already courting Ignatieff, he will be the "chosen one" for Canada soon.   The New York Times already has given him a glowing report.   The Canadian media is Liberal friendly also.   So it is just a matter of time for Iggy to take the PMO.  He is pretty, and he is a Liberal.  He will keep the seat warm until Justin Trudeau, the other chosen one is ready to take his throne.  Mark my words.    See, these things are "fixed" already by the media.    It worked for Obama, it worked for the Canadian Liberals until they rotted from the core from corruption, and it will work for them again when they have enough time to get the Iggy face out there.    If you learn anything in your life, learn this:  "A democracy will only work if the populace is informed and holds their elected officials accountable."   And I don't see that happening any time soon.   Not when there is a media bias.    Edit:    Sweetie, you would be far better off reading some good historical novels, study a bit of history.  Read up on Chairman Mao, Joseph Stalin, Adolph Hitler.   Find out what Grandpa did in the war and why he did it.   Watch the news, and not just local CBC or CTV crap, watch BBC news, Fox news.   Get the Globe and Mail and see how their coverage differs from the National Post.  It's pretty amazing how they can manipulate the populace.     watch documentaries about other countries.  See what is happening in the world.  If you don't understand it, google it.   See where curiosity about the world and it's troubles will take you.   The world will belong to you and your generation soon, and you will have to make the best of it.    Think for yourself and don't ask somebody to do your homework for you.|`|VSyKETqQaa	Canada doesn't need to worry. They are not the ignorant people that elected the worst president in US history. Canada may need to worry about an influx of people from the US moving there, but that would be it.|`|tv7DlXWaaa	i heart goe bush jr.
AA11966821	You are going to have difficulty.  You are not "highly skilled" with only a bachelor's degree.  You have already been denied a work visa and that is on your records.  With one strike against you, it just makes it tougher to get a visa application through.    The biggest problem is unemployment in Canada.  Jobs are scarce.  There are plenty of employment agencies which claim to get jobs in Canada for foreign workers.  Check google or the Toronto yellow pages in the phone book.  They make a lot of money off of people like you.  But they cannot create jobs where there are none.    There is a high probability that you have to leave Canada and return to your own country.  The job market stinks and foreign workers are simply not needed.

Actually my three year old granddaughter would not have made such a mess as George Bush.  I will miss the old buffoon to be honest...We as a family often found ourselves laughing hysterically at him on a daily basis- what an idiot....though not at some of the war decisions he made. Obama may have well put many comedians out of a job now...there were so many jokes about Bush..it appears there won't be much comedic material with Obama...well hopefully not anyway.|`|ua2E4WK4aa	Not really. Its gotten to a point where the democrats are gaining too much power, I think there should always be an even balence, and Obama, while his goals are noble I guess, is shooting high. Everyone bags on bush tho... How can you expect someone to be a good president through all the stuff that happened. Anyway I hope Obama knows how to fix us, we need to get back on top again lol. (think of it this way: he wouldnt have won if he wasnt black. Not being racist, but if some white democrat went up against mccain, the fact that he was a pow alone would prolly gimmick him into office)|`|mPNai10Daa	The truth is this is not a question that can be answer this year. It toll Bush jr four to six year to throw the mess around and the american people should give Obama at least four to six years to clean up that mess. No one gives a human baby 100 days to learn to walk when they can not even sit up. Obama is just a newbie, we must have faith that this country will get stronger and better because we have a leader who wants all people to see and feel the strength that comes for being an American. Only time will tell how great we can be as a nation again.|`|ofP7bbX7aa	NO.  He does not know where they keep the vacuum in the White house.|`|VSyKETqQaa	NO NO NO NO NO.  Obama is the worst thing to ever happen to america. If you mean cleaning up by means of the war then helll nooo. Obama wants to send troops to Afgahnistan and eventually Darfur.    Yes let us "spread the wealth" and become a socilist nation.. not.  What was the first thing he did?? Abortion. I am all pro choice but the fact that Obama's bill takes away the choice a doctor has to perform an abortion or not is truly the dumbest thing i have ever heard of.

DTSUJe2oaa	Not in most states it would not but it would depend on the individual state your charges are probably misdemeanor charges rather than Felony so you would be wise to contact the licensing agency in the state where you reside, any community college that offers a nursing program.~     Criminal background clearance   All the local hospitals are now requiring background clearance for criminal history prior to allowing students   access into their clinical facility. Clearance must be obtained prior to participating in clinical activities. If   clearance is not obtained, the program will be unable to place the student in the clinical area. Clinical is a   component of each nursing course. Students who cannot be placed in the clinical area will not be accepted into   the program.   Applicants are responsible for fees to obtain criminal background clearance.   Prior to obtaining an RN license, the applicant must submit fingerprints to the Department of Justice. Licensing   applicants are required to disclose all convictions, misdemeanors and/or felonies. Review page 8 carefully which   discusses this issue.     Please take the aforementioned information into account prior to applying to the program. Applicants with recent and/or significant criminal histories are at risk for inability to complete the program and inability to obtain licensure as a registered nurse.~

Police do NOT press charges - the victim does.  The officer merely completes the paperwork....    The way to end the tedious court dates as you call them is to talk to your MIL about her issue with not being able to keep her hands to herself, plead out and then stay away from the "crazy person".  It's called assault - no two ways around it.      The MIL put herself in that situation - no one else did.  Someone couldn't control their mouth but the MIL couldn't control herself.|`|qwaWd14vaa	Crazy is a medical term for one who is not right in the head. (if one can define right?)

56f857adccfe97c5b5197529fd3759b6aa	Answer is 1 obviously as you see from the responses above. For my part, I shall supplement the facts from an elite source.    Please read the article entitled "Elect among equals" by Ramaswamy R. Iyer, appearing in the Indian Express dated Feb 3 for a candid exposure of the hollowness of the criticisms against the CEC.     Excerpts:    "...That the CEC is only one among equals is a questionable view...  the fact that the Constitution has given to the CEC the power of making a recommendation for the removal of an EC implies a clear difference between the CEC and the ECs..    The objection to a suo motu recommendation has no force. The Constitution merely says that an EC cannot be removed except on a recommendation by the CEC. It does not say that the CEC can make such a recommendation only on a reference from the government....    The argument that it was improper or in bad taste to make such a recommendation against a colleague is strange. It is precisely about a colleague that the CEC is constitutionally empowered to make that recommendation..    The controversy regarding Chawla is not a new one, nor is it entirely a Congress-BJP question. When Chawla was appointed EC, many in the country were dismayed. Some even wrote to the President of India on the subject. ..    The question of timing remains... The CEC, having stated in his affidavit before the Supreme Court that he had the power of making a recommendation for the removal of an EC, could have exercised it promptly..   (on this point alone, I have a difference.. Does the learned author expect the CEC to act on a petition given to the Apex Court..? He acted on getting the same at his office and after getting the replies of the accused on the petition..)    Unfortunate as the timing may be, it does not follow that having examined the matter, the CEC should refrain from acting on his findings. The rightness of that recommendation can be judged only when we know the grounds on which it is based...    Finally, the established legal opinion seems to be that the recommendation is not binding on the government, and that it is the appointing authority, namely the President, who has the power to terminate the appointment. That is debatable, but in any case the CEC's recommendation should clearly be given very careful consideration and should not be rejected unless there are strong grounds for doing so...    it is disturbing to read reports about 'sources' saying that the CEC's recommendation will be rejected and that Chawla will be the next CEC, implying that the recommendation will be rejected out of hand..."    Well. The author has put it in place.. what is going on in our - the commoners without a political affiliation - minds.. Just because the petition was given by the BJP it should not be considered partisan.. in fact, the data on the conduct of the accused EC reflect the gross partisan activities of the person in such sensitive post..!    Unfortunately we don't have impartial media to put these aspects strongly.. except for this lone article.. Even The Hindu had criticised the CEC in most unconvincing and partisan manner.. not to speak of the DC and other expected antagonists of the BJP.. who see the issue as that of a party and not of national consequence..!!?    Jai Hind!|`|5wAAnZPYaa	No congress party is not at all biased but pleased to see Navin chawla behave like this.|`|e4J0OfjDaa	1|`|AKDfOoxCaa	1. Obvious to all except the jaundiced media ever opposed to the truly secular BJP and favourable to pseudo secular outfits.     Because the accused CE was favourable to the party's interests evident in his opinions to fix dates etc given to the E Commission (the point on which CEC found him partisan and recommended his removal).     But the party has the advantage to protect the officer being at the helm of govt and able to advise the President not to forward petitions in the matter to CEC nor have the latter receive and consider any complaint..!     The General Elections are round the corner and the "services" of Mr Chawla who is the prospective CEC is required by the Congress. See the unconcealed irritation of the Law Minister in criticising the CEC..!|`|Ij26w9ataa	Yes. Congress has planted Chawla in Election Commission. He was always partial to wards Congress. If my information is correct he is also active;ly associated with some NGOs. Further he has been bestowed with an honour by the Italian Government  influenced by guess who.There were very few election commissioners who were impartial.Some of them were suitably rewarded by the Congress Party.|`|AA10401098	It is Navin Chawla who is biased to congress. The Congress party only LIKES him for his OBEDIENT DOG LIKE FOLLOW UP ACTION. But if EC/CEC behaves like a house dog you cannot blame the dog. Dog is a WATCH GUARD. It is the TRAINER who trains it to do its job. An OBEDIENT DOG will only wag the TAIL for biscuits and food articles. Chawla wags for many more, because he is a YES MAN.  I hope you get your answer. SESHADRI|`|rCr3uqt9aa	Congress want to contest ensuing loksabha election under Chawla,s supervision so as to get maximum advantage because Chawla is not working election commissioner but like a congress worker   So its well planed conspiracy at the behest of Sonia G|`|vCvsXbOCaa	Chawla is BIASED towards Congress.In past also Congress is used to win Elections with the help of biased ECE and after their retirement are suitably rewarded by congress towards services rendered by them for example look at the retired CEC Sardar fellow Gill Who is in cabinate minister in Sonia government.
9dn1QRfBaa	typically this is done to disrupt or destroy counter-revolutionary forces that support the return of capitalist wage slavery, the dictatorship of the proletariat is established to crush all supporters of the flawed capitalist system.     Cuba is an excellent example which involved large public trials of murders whom had served the US puppet regime of Batista. Another example would be the Cultural Revolution in China when Mao ordered the Red Guards to identify and arrest all reformers within the Communist Party that sought concessions with capitalism.     not sure what you are getting at by suggesting "framing event by killing someone?"|`|ofP7bbX7aa	power|`|cYuGYhGmaa	They see it as righteous retribution for crimes committed against the proletariat by the bourgeois.

When there is a illiberal party in power, they have strong incentive, and the lack of scruple necessary, to murder the opposition.  That being said there is no necessary connection between communism and illiberalism.|`|4lINNvG5aa	If you look at every Communist ( and other totalitarian regimes) the leader does not really ascribe to the ideology.  They just want the dictatorial power.  Lenin, Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler, Mao Se Tung,Ho Chi Minh, Peron, Castro, Pol Pot etc, etc Read history!   They get rid of those closes to them those that got them in power.    Lenin destroyed the the Bolsheviks and the "white Russians" right after the 1917 Revelation.  Hitler gained power because of the brown shirt led by Rhom of the SA.   Hitler killed ( made him commit suicide) and created the SS loyal only to him.  Stalin killed whole waves of supporter throughout his reign.  One reason he could not conquer a very small country ( Finland) because he had killed all his generals.  The great hero of the stupid left (Che) was sent to his death by Castro much like David sent his lover's husband into battle to die!  The general public is uneducated and gives rise to the reasoned support of a benevolent Monarchy!  The masses lack the education to govern themselves!

We got 11 Democrat votes. They got 0 Republican votes.|`|bqJgdcfLaa	I think you have that backwards, why don't the Republicans make an attempt at the bipartisan game?    The stimulus package is a watered down shell of what it could be, but the Democrats are trying to put together something that Republicans can be happy with.  The stimulus package ideally would be nothing but construction projects, that is pure jobs here, now, while investing in the future.  But Republicans would never support that.  So, tax cuts are put in and Republicans still don't vote for it.  It is pathetic really.    Republicans won't participate because it would make Obama look like he is operating in a bipartisan way, and that would be a win for him.  They would rather play the, we're just outside the loop game.|`|YgUXtpg9aa	It is called politics|`|nM2k6geEaa	listen they did compromise on the stimulus package not capitulate!|`|C9QzpcNOaa	I doubt voting No 176 times is very bi-partisan.

I30atLoSaa	It seems that this wonderful country of ours keeps being destroyed by the idealism of Labor Governments. I see we now have the greatest destroyer of all time, Paul Keating, giving his advice to the Government who are of course listening.... they have no ideas of their own! What next? Whitlam and Hawke to be placed in an economic advisory committee?  This Government seems to have the answer to our economic woes though.... give 2,000,000 houses free ceiling batts. That should fix it!  It's obvious where we're heading, and it is a shame for our country that we have a truck load of peanuts in the Labor Government in charge, as they have their own interests at heart, and don't give a rats about the welfare of Australia, or its people.  Another bleak few years, until we can get a decent, qualified Government elected to fix another disaster being waged by the Rudd rabble. God help Australia!!|`|jlXPsVfdaa	Years like it took last time.  Kevin Rudd is definitely a dud.|`|mPNai10Daa	Like in most country when the leaders is going through stuff Australia will have it's ups and downs. The thing is that the people need to listen past the people who only speaks of money and not of it's people. And like the US it is going to take your government at least four to five year to be sure that things are set in place to see people not money so do not expect it to happen over night.|`|ofP7bbX7aa	Longer than it is going to take us to pay for the first stimulus package.|`|4ZdA7wbXaa	I find you coalition fans hard to take.    First it was Rudd's fault that interest rates were going up now they have dropped it is still his fault. Australia's economy is linked to the world economy. What was he supposed to do wait like GWB did and take Australia into a black hole that it may take 10 years to come out of or try a stimulus plan. The first one saved jobs there is no doubt about it, it may have only saved them for a short period but it saved them. The current issue in Australia is that the mines are closing down. This is not Rudd's fault. When 1300 miners (according to news.com.au not the biggest Rudd fan) are laid off in one day that is a sign of larger issues at play. Unfortunately the countries Australia mainly exports to China, USA and Japan are all facing their own crisis these means that Australian products simply are not being bought at the levels they were when Howard was in office. This is not Rudd's fault. He inherited the problems, The housing market was over inflated, as was resource stocks. These eventually had to correct themselves. Quiet frankly I have put off buying a house for the past 2.5 years because I have been waiting for the property market to correct itself. Rudd did not introduce the FHOG he has temporally increased it to get buyers like myself to show our heads in the market. Guess what it has worked. I am seriously looking at buying right now why because 7grand makes a big difference overall. No leader anywhere could have handled what Rudd was dealt but guess what he is doing the best and certainly better then the mob before.
HH5mlAHhaa	You cant be pulled over for looking under the age. Police have to have probable cause to pull you over whether it be no seatbelt or your liscense plate light is out.|`|7KZMMYjQaa	Police need "reasonable suspicion" to initiate a vehicle stop. If you look young enough to be under the legal driving age, then the officer may suspect that you are and pull you over. Look at it this way, If you saw someone driving that looked to be lets say 14 or 15 years old, wouldn't you want the police to stop them and check things out before the under aged driver caused an accident?|`|D8SpQAgLaa	If you're 12 years old, then yes. But they're not going to pull you over because you're 18 and they suspect you might be 16.|`|LxfjzzM2aa	sure you can.|`|ffJcrsmLaa	They can basically pull anybody over for anything they want. They can just say your driving seemed suspicious, and that's considered "reasonable suspicion" to pull you over. In court, if you tried to argue that you weren't driving suspiciously, it's the cop's word against yours, and a judge will almost always side with the cop. If you look young (even if you look old enough to drive), there's a pretty good chance you will get pulled over some time; age prejudice is huge with the cops (not all of them of course, but a lot of them).|`|qwaWd14vaa	Why do you think we have a drivers license?

meVH73dOaa	No, he is not. He thinks because as he said "I won" and him being the President "trumps" every one else, he is a real dummy.     When his self-inflation as redeemer of U.S.-Muslim relations leads him to suggest that pre-Obama America was disrespectful or insensitive or uncaring of Muslims, he is engaging not just in fiction but in gratuitous disparagement of the country he is now privileged to lead.    Will common-sense Americans really support a massive overdose of government run amok? I seriously doubt it.    Last week, every single Republican in the House of Representatives voted against the Obama administration's "stimulus" package  which had stimulated an orgy of runaway spending by congressional Democrats on everything from sports arenas to sexually transmitted diseases.    This was a rare smart move by the Republicans. If the GOP had gone along, pursuing the will o' the wisp of "bipartisanship," then if the stimulus had by some miracle succeeded, it would have been a bill for which Democrats would claim credit at the next election.    On the other hand, if the stimulus failed  which seems far more likely  then it would be called a "bipartisan" bill, meaning that the Democrats would pay no price at the next election for a colossal failure.|`|AA11626262	Isn't everyone these days?

There were no parties - just one party - the ruler's party.    Obviously, I'm not saying that this has happened.  I am saying that dictators do not allow for an opposing voice to be heard, and are therefore "Post Partisan".    Let's hope that Obama is not "Post-Partisan" and those who do not think the way that he does are still allowed to freely express their opinions.    I see that in California, the Pro-Gay Marriage folks are targeting those people who donated money to Prop 8 through the use of Google Maps and the reporting of donations to campaigns.  This thoroughly sickens me.  These "classy" folks are trying to shut up people who don't think like them by threatening them.      Free speech is always OK for "Post Partisans" like this - as long as they agree with you.  If not - LOOK OUT - they are targeting you.|`|VK0brk89aa	The media is still in la la land. And it's fading fast.     Obama can't bring together a peanut butter and jelly sandwich if he had to.     Currently Obama is working on bringing a Rep Senator to his cabinet so he will be 1 step closer in getting 60 Democrat Senators. THEN Obama will not have to blink an eye at the Rep's. He won't need 1 vote for anything.    Does that sound like Obama is a Partisan President? NOPE.|`|AA10691319	he is not post partisan, if anything his election has divided the country even further.|`|XwtmNIMOaa	Obama has been making numerous overtures to the Republicans in an attempt to be post-partisan.

The GOP repaid his bi-partisanship by ordering their members to not vote for the bill.|`|acWyJ3t0aa	No he should not quit the Democratic party , but he should follow up on his word during the elections to put Republicans and Democrats at a fairly even division in his cabinet . Instead , since the election , he has gone back on his word on this statement , He said no lobbyists for his reign in congress , but he has more now than Bush ever had , another broken promise , and he has promised that there would be no more Pork in Budgets , and yet this is the biggest pork barrel budget ever . This thing with interest could cost us up to 1.2 Trillion dollars almost doubling our national debt . He has promised the people that he would do all he could to decrease the load on the blue collar workers in America and yet he has taken some of the funds in this bill and earmarked them for abortion support in other countries . No he is increasing the bipartisanship by demanding not negotiating with everyone , but demanding that it is going to be his way or no way . Now he has even threatened Republicans with losing their position in the next elections if they do not vote his way .|`|3TjiJls7aa	I think he really wants to work with republicans. I hope he does.

7608d8bbef666e373ac9050db58b0ce9aa	In India life imprisonment [umar quaid ( ???? ??? )] used to be widely understood as one lasting 14100 years, depending on the severity and recurrence of the crimes and callousness. However, recent rulings by the Indian Supreme Court, on a case against Jahid Hussain in the state of West Bengal who held a life convict for a period of 21 years in prison, reaffirmed that life imprisonment should be treated as imprisonment of the convict for the remainder of his natural life, unless the government exercises its discretion to reduce the life term of the convict considering his good behavior and a guarantee that the convict will never commit an offense, especially one that could cause physical or mental harm to another human being or innocent animal after being released.|`|Az3ZS1ksaa	state govt has  no competency to release the convict during the tenure of imprisonment on the ground of good behaviour(recent decision of High court of karnataka).It is the order of the court at the instance of law enacted by the legislature.the executive of the govt can not take an unilateral decision of releasing the convict on the ground of good behaviour.|`|vvZDO8WJaa	i think ipc 320 is for murder knowingly.. and if that the case ..the man is in stable state of mind and he has committed a murder knowingly what  are the consequences... so it is either given death penalty or life imprisonment.....      good behaviour is the case...after 15 to 20 yrs...

But in all fairness, blacks are not the only people who sometimes abuse our welfare system. Whites do it too...and so does just about every other ethnic group.|`|AA11995584	Black people who know about the facts on Democrat racism DO vote Republican.  Republicans fought to free blacks from slavery and amended the Constitution to grant blacks freedom (13th Amendment), citizenship (14th Amendment) and the right to vote (15th Amendment).  Republicans passed the civil rights laws of the 1860's, including the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Reconstruction Act of 1867  Democrats fought against anti-lynching laws, and when the Democrats regained control of Congress in 1892, they passed the Repeal Act of 1894 that repealed portions of laws designed to help African Americans. Republicans founded many Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  Republicans  started the NAACP.  Black Republican James Weldon Johnson, was the first black general secretary of the NAACP.     If recent history is more your fancy, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.(a Republican) came against Democrats like "Bull" Connor in Birmingham,  Democrat Georgia Governor Lester Maddox who famously brandished ax handles to prevent blacks from patronizing his restaurant.  Governor George Wallace known for his "Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever" line.    In Little Rock it was  Democrat Governor Orville Faubus that fought against Dr. King.     JFK voted against the 1957 Civil rights Act as did Democrat Senator Al Gore, Sr.  Kennedy opposed the 1963 March on Washington by Dr. King  because it was organized by a black Republican.  Attorney General Robert Kennedy, had Dr. King wiretapped and investigated by the FBI on suspicion of being a Communist in order to undermine Dr. King.    Every major city where there is black poverty and racial injustice has been  held by Democrat mayors the past 40 years.    You substitue true racism for what you call subtle Racism.  I hope for your sake you do some reading on the following website and at least get a basic understanding of Black history prior to your next rant.

Unless you're stupid.|`|1TJ5v6Xzaa	Because despite the republicans actively fighting racism for decades, it is the democrats that were able to convince the minorities in this country that they are not racists, even though they allow it.    Senator Robert Byrd, an Imperial Wizard of the KKK, was given the KKK Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002.  That's right, 2002!  The other part is he accepted it.  Yet the democrats ignores this fact.      The republicans wrote, fought, and passed the civil rights bill against democratic opposition.    Martin Luther King supported the Civil Rights Bill and was a republican himself and helped fight against the democrats in order to get the bill passed.      Democrats John F. Kennedy and Al Gore Sr. voted against the bill.    Don't believe me, you don't need to.  Just click on the links I provided and read for yourself.  Stay away from CNN, MSNBC, and all those pro-democratic news outlets, they will never give you the truth.

It's become a crutch really, an excuse to thwart responsibility and motivation.|`|4YXiG0jWaa	Republicans (as a party) don't reach out to black folks because either they don't really connect with them or they don't care.  Bush admitted that he would do nothing for black folks when he got into office because they didn't "come out for him" in the election so he said "screw them".  A former Bush adviser wrote a book quoting Bush on that.  And look how he responded to Hurricane Katrina?  Republicans know that black people don't like them that much and they probably don't like black folks that much either so it seems like there will never be a huge black Republican constituency.  They act like racism is a non-issue and doesn't exist so they won't really do anything about it.  That's why people can show up to McCain/Palin rallies and say "Kill him!" and "He's terrorist" and "He's the Anti-Christ" about Obama and nobody stops them (well, except McCain).  Why is this the first time anybody has said these things about a presidential candidate?

However, a fairly significant amount of African Americans (along with other races) who are less fortunate think they are entitled to get their money from wealthy Americans, which is just disgusting.    The idea that Republicans have subtle, racist undertones is ridiculous. Honestly, African Americans can turn ANY statement into a "racist" statement if they wanted.

IF, IF the government did set this up, i think its fair to say they would use normal planes because lets face it, if an organisation is going to bring down 2 massive towers which contain over 2000 + people, they arent going to worry about destroying 2 more planes and 200 people.    3) The passangers sadly died in the crash, R.I.P. to them. Why would the an organisation kill 2000 people and save 200 others.    4) proof is there that civilian planes were used. The alleged planes used were found at the crash site and aren't registered or used anymore. and lets face it, planes are commonly targeted in terrorist situations since 1995 +.    5)  UFO???!?!?!? near the twin towers. IF aliens can fly all the way across space to get here, why would they want to stand next to a big disaster area.         Anyway ive seen this alleged UFO. Explanation : either glare from the tonnes of shiny steel frames and tonnes of glass on the side of the twin towers. the ammount of sun light that would of been reflected would be huge.

It is technically possible for the "hijacked fights" to have been commandeered by the ground control system which was designed with the overriding of pilots control in the case of hijacking.     A word of warning, eyewitnesses can get things wrong you know, the best example  being with the Pentagon "crash" where many alleged that there was hundreds who saw a plane hit when in fact all anyone but one somewhat suspect witness saw or heard was a low flying airliner in the vicinity just prior to the explosion, rather than one impacting.    Some  arguments are published by the perps so they can be later debunked in a attempt to discredit all other questioning of the official account.|`|bYwjbsNCaa	Shut up. You sound like a liberal to me, so stfu. We were attacked by HIJACKED planes, I don't care what the media, liberals, hippies, *******, all say. If you have a problem with it, go over seas and fight.|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Eyewitness testimony is the least reliable type of evidence.  The physical evidence (video shot by multiple people from multiple angles, actual plane wreckage recovered from the site, etc.) says these were civilian aircraft and we know exactly which civilian aircraft they were right down to their registration numbers.      You need to stop looking for your answers on Youtube.  Your never going to find them there.      Of course if your so hung up on "eyewitness testimony" here is mine.  I was one of the millions of people that watched the second tower get hit on live TV.  Unlike the majority of your "eyewitnesses" I am an aviation enthusiast with over 200 books in my library on civil and military aviation.  Aircraft ID is something I am really, really good at and I saw civilian planes hitting that tower.  No question.  All of the footage I have seen since leaves absolutely no doubt those were civilian aircraft.|`|1oj4aamaaa	That's the question I always ask when someone suggests that theory.|`|AA11705909	More insane conspiracy bollocks.

6nOMv6aLaa	I don't know what your age or relationship have to do with the question... but...    The requirement of living in the USA for 14 years is very vague. It does not explicitly say whether those year have to be consecutive or not or right before being elected president. This requirement has never been called into question though, so it is unlikely that it will ever really matter.    "No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years, and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States. "|`|Ge6oHWQ1aa	You have to have lived in the US for the 14 years leading up to you taking office.  You also have to be a natural born citizen and at least 35 years old.|`|tueQ0ygKaa	I'm not sure, but are you planning on running for presidency? If so, kudos to you!|`|LLmjucgIaa	what is your question. haha|`|tgh0yJp4aa	ok we get it : you are black and are dating a white chick. so?  you really dont care about the presidency do you?  you are just trying to sound educated, sorry mission failed|`|lRNAlYyXaa	Yeah I'm wondering why you specified your race and age and such. You are allowed to go on vacations and such you have to be a legal resident for 14 consecutive years. Like you can go on vacations and trips as long as your still paying taxes to America for 14 straight years. You can't take residency anywhere else.|`|JQwL50JMaa	To answer your question:  yes, we all realize you are a troll.  Now go away.    Btw, the 14 year requirement is meant more for people who were born and raised overseas (by a parent who is an American citizen) and had to abide by the laws of the country they were living in prior to moving to the United States.  But this is a rare occurrence.    The 14 year rule was more relevant when this country was in its infancy and there were fewer people who had been born and raised here.|`|duAd0Uqzaa	Yes- you have to be 35 to run, but only have to live in the U.S. for 14 years. Just remember to apply for citizenship again once you come back from the UK.  why? are you planning on running for president? :)|`|jHDeIPEfaa	Only native-born U.S. citizens (or those born abroad, but only to parents who were both citizens of the U.S.) may be president of the United States. One must live in the United States for at least 14 years to be president, in addition to being a natural-born citizen. The Constitution is vague on this point. For example, it does not make clear whether those 14 years need to be consecutive.|`|xFm5wzuXaa	What does your life story have to do with the question?

I don't think it is spelled out.  It would probably be difficult to run if you have not lived in the US continuously for the previous 14 years.|`|31fDBuLjaa	This q is scatterbrained.    Is there a 14 year rule? I've never heard of it.|`|wFy2gDdRaa	You have to be a natural born citizen to be president|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Article II, Clause 5, in addition to saying the President must be a natural-born citizen of at least 35 years of age, says only that they have to have resided in the US for at least 14 years. It doesn't say those 14 years have to have been right before the election, or even consecutive. So really, a 35 year old citizen who was born here, and lived every other year of their first 28 years here, is eligible to be President.|`|B79lX9Inaa	That I would like to see.
MEReSvZeaa	The would would not look very different.    The US revolutionary war began the erosion Brit territories over seas.  Had it not happened, Britain would likely still be a world power, would likely have been dominant in WW I and WW II (with it's colonial American support), and the world would likely have seen the development of democracies in much the same way since the Magna Carta and Elizabeth I were the original inspirations of modern freedom anyway.|`|11dGXLchaa	LOL.  Who wants to be like Canada?   Who wants to be part of the UK?   I think things worked out just fine as is.|`|b57ca6a213f670d2f4c464725b3fb119aa	We'd all be speaking German now.  At least those of us who are still alive.  There's no way the UK would have defeated the Nazi menace without American aid.|`|60YMS1xkaa	This is really interesting question. No one can really answer, just make assumptions according to what happened in the past to such countries.    You would have eventually separated from Great Britain, because like all empires, they would have inevitably fallen. The US, I think would be a lot more like Canada (    As for the World Wars, it wouldn't have the same outcome. Remember, you became strong after you separated from BR. You played your cards right, etc and that's why you had enough power to intervene and succeed in those wars.    Other countries would have sought their own dependence regardless of the US - they've been doing it since before the US got its independence. Maybe the French would've have taken longer, though.    Edit: No. Because when you separated, you also expanded. Before WW1, you did plenty of things that made you stronger. If you were under the power of BR you wouldn't have done those things. Also, the timing of your arrival in both WWs was crucial. WW2 - The Allies were simply exhausted as were Axis powers - and then you tumble in, all fresh and new and unscratched.|`|AA11756809	Who said we EVER separated from Britain??

When Democrat voters hear a hand is empty, they won't believe it unless your party starts with R.

Rush isn't the only person saying that Obama's so-called "stimulus" package is BAD policy.  Every day, more and more economists are sounding the alarm.  It won't create jobs.  Period.  It will create massive debt. For sure.  That will lead to higher taxes. For EVERYONE.  There will be terrible inflation. Absolutely.    This is a tax and spend program to fundamentally "CHANGE" America.  Obama and the Democrats are using the "crisis" to enact social programs that would NEVER pass if they were subject to the NORMAL legislative or appropriations process.

Second, the economy was just fine until the Democrats took over congress in 2006. That's when things went downhill. Do some research. Third, much as you and your new President think that we can tell the world we're friends and all will be well as peaceful, we actually DO need the military. You don't have a problem putting all those people out of work, including the civilians that depend on those bases for work? The closing of that base in Puerto Rico was devastating for the local economy but you libbies never think about that. You just think "Military bad." And who's to say which ones are unnecessary--You? That would be disastrous.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Mike you may be too young to remember but a whole lot of unnecessary bases have been closed in the last 20 years.

dbQHlp85aa	I believe he was impersonating Obama.. didn't you know he can walk on water!!!|`|yHwUbD6Saa	That man loves to hear his own voice.  Look up the YouTube video of his rant when he was younger and bald (e.g. "I think I have a much higher IQ than you!", etc.).  He goes on to list his credentials.... which later turned out to be a lie upon fact checking.  Kind of like his knowledge of the Constitution that he displayed during the VP debates.    Every time that douche bag opens his mouth we get more humor ("Barack's favorite 3 letter word - 'jobs' - 'j-o-b-s' 'jobs';  'read my lips.

I campaigned for Obama.  I don't like Geithner and I am completely disgusted with Daschle.  Both of them are like having the fox guarding the hen house.  I have no idea why Obama would have passed up Howard Dean for Daschle unless Dean had even more troubling skeletons in his closet.  Geithner is also a mystery.  He is so dirty in Republican dealings that I wouldn't know where to start.    These guys make how much money a year in salary?  Well apparently it is enough to make them "unaware" that they owed MAJOR taxes on their "income".  All I know is that we forgot to pay less than $30 in fed unemployment taxes on an employee and by the time all was said and done, after they seized everything in my bank account, and all the checks I'd written on that account bounced, that less than $30 cost us over $400. and took us over 6 months to resolve.    This was during the Reagan reign, and I guess maybe I "attracted attention" because I was involved in Central American politics and trying to help bring refugees into the US.  Everyone in our group was audited. One of my friends who, unfortunately, had quite a lot of money in her account, had to spend nearly $5K in attorney fees to get her $7K back.  This is your government at work, people, dog help you should you care about justice.|`|v0G9s9ktaa	It is when your rants include "barack the magic kneegro".

bkav003oaa	I would go with "or what".
QIQNzE11aa	Yes, you'll get in trouble. You can face a few months in jail for doing so. But you could also be kicked out of college and off of campus as well as most schools have their own sets of rules about such things. Scholarships can be revoked for this. The landlord can kick you out of the house as well. Your parents will be contacted.     You'd spend the night in jail and get a heft fine to try to teach you not to do it again.|`|AA11206283	Yes you can.  Penalty will have a lot to do with where and what happens|`|AA11598520	You can get in trouble for being a minor and serving alcohol period, even if those you are serving ARE over 21. So, you're committing two crimes. Yes, they can charge you for both serving alcohol and being underage and serving to underage people. Further, if one of these kids gets into an accident, you're liable for criminal charges and/or civil charges. That kids legal guardian can sue YOU for having served him in the first place, even if nothing happens but s/he is discovered drunk by the legal guardian. You could lose everything you own.|`|AA10123414	The penalty will depend on where you are as it is state, not federal law you would be violating.    However if you are the one providing the alcohol you would face 2 charges while everyone else would face 1; you would get charged with under aged in possession and providing alcohol to a person under aged.    You are an adult and it would be handled in adult court.|`|TPPZp8IYaa	Not if you live in Australia- you only have to be 18..lol... Seriously, I wouldn't recommend serving alcohol to minors anywhere though, it will only land you in alot of hot water....|`|HeoS75kGaa	You betcha!  If youre'a clerk under 21 in a 7-11, and the store sells beer, YOU cannot ring up the customer.  A clerk over 21 must do the transaction.  Silly?  Maybe.  But that IS the law.  The store can lose its license to sell beer for violating that law, so it would be a very stupid owner that would risk it.  Beer accounts for a LOT of revenue in those stores.    In a house full of college students, if there is alcohol present, and the cops come for whatever reason and see the booze, there will be a lot of citations for underage possession.  Whether or not it's in YOUR hands in irrelevant.  Just that the booze is present, and no ACTIVE controls to keep it out of your hands, is sufficient to get you the citation.  On top of that, the people who have legal residential status in that house will (WILL) face further charges for furnishing alcohol in an environment where underage possession/consumption is not controlled.    I can see where you need to share expenses, and it's naive to assume that there will never be any booze at a college party.  But if you hold residential authority (as someone who lives in the house), then you want to:  A) Be far, far away when you have to explain later in court what you were doing when the tickets were being handed out,  B) Have a damned good escape route so you can claim you were far, far away when you have to explain later, etc etc.    Got a drivers license?  Dependent on it?  Some states, you'll lose it for being in such a situation.  Want to get elected President one day?  It will come back to haunt you.  Just need a security clearance for your job when you graduate?  Criminal record won't keep you out of a job, but could make getting the dream job a lot more difficult.    Somebody said it's state law, not federal, about the drinking age, and they're correct.  But every single state, all 50 of them (or 57, if you listen to our current President), have set the age to 21.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	If they're all under 21 - pretty much, yeah, you'll be charged.|`|fCB3pCXaaa	uh..duh|`|QjVVlayqaa	um duh. it doesnt matter how old you are. you get in trouble for serving alchohol to minors or for drinking it as a minor. and maybe even for possesion or something.|`|2p2gnlZyaa	How about not having parties? It's illegal and immature. Maybe you should think about studying instead of partying.    And yes, you'll get arrested. So will all of your little minor friends.|`|uaql88h8aa	Is this a serious question?    No crap you can get charged.    If you knew the law, you have to be 21 to legally drink...you just wasted 5 points.|`|wN1oY7IRaa	Yes, it is illegal.  Expect to see some jail time and say goodbye to your college career.  Also, if a party guest gets drunk, drives home, and kills or hurts themselves or someone else, you will be held responsible and could be tried for manslaughter.  Is it worth it?|`|vFHXrOHNaa	You will not be charged with serving alcohol to under 21 you will charged for dis-orderly conduct only.    that charge is to be liable against the store owner who if knowing and willingly sold you the liquor.     So have Parties which do not wake-up the neighborhood.     Have Fun but be safe.|`|gDuDNeRcaa	someone i know was sent to prison for contributing alcohol to minors when he was 18. so yes.|`|d2sc33lkaa	Yes,u can get death penalty
EnODJeIcaa	TAX TAX TAX SPEND SPEND SPEND ELECT ELECT ELECT.     It was the mantra of the Roosevelt era and it is the era of the new Democrat super majority...They will spend and spend and spend and get little in the way of results...All of the money is going into environmentalist special interest, unemployment, and wellfare and we are supposed to just start consuming again because they are pouring 900 Billion into their special interest lobbies...    Case in point 40 Billion for infrastructure...40 Billion! Our of 900 Billion  for rebuilding America's out of date transportation and infrastructure and yet they are spending almost double that on medicare for low income families.    We are watching our Washington leaders mortgage our childrens future and there is nothing we can do about it, because the media tells everyone it is a good idea, and no one will hold them accountable when they see no real results from it...What jobs does more medicare money get you????None it is an incentive not to work since low income people are going to get gold plated healthcare....but the middle class tax break that Obama swore up and down that he was going to implement???OH THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT.    It is a disgusting abuse of power...If you read the bill it is a pork laden bill for every single liberal program that they have ever wanted to implement and now that they have the economy reeling from their stupid "Community Reinvestment Act" that destroyed the banking system and the housing market...They are going to make a run on every misguided, liberal special interest program they can...    You're right...Our children will either work hard and get good jobs and see sky high tax rates to pay off this era of Washington spending spree's or they will be satiated by the wealth of freebies the government is offering consuming non-producers and stay at home and collect the new gold plated well fare programs.    We have begun the shift towards Euro-modeled mediocrity and soft touch liberalism and forgotten the sweating brow, hard work ethics of our forefathers.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	To be sure Obama and his team will want to get something passed for fear of later being accused of not having done anything and 2 million jobs gained (if it were to happen which I doubt will) is really a net zero gain since we've lost as much over the last year alone.    I like Obama even though I did not vote for either of the two candidates and I do wish him well but something in my gut tells me that when things start going from bad to worst and the American people start expressing that anger that his popularity rating will drop like a scalding potato (or is it potatoe? it's been a while) but I hope I am oh so very very wrong in this.    Deep down in my heart of hearts I sense that they are all just making a run on what money is left so they can skip town when all hell breaks loose, no money left, and they are out of office if not out of country altogether.|`|13KBWzBXaa	If I recall, didn't our last president do something similar? And wasn't he a  republican?    When will we realize that there ain't a dimes worth of difference between the demopublicans and the republicrats?    Read Keynes. The stooges in charge are all Keynesian's; they believe the money never has to be paid back. And anyway, it ain't real money.|`|Y3ZAtgkXaa	you didn't recognize it when bush was spending like a drunken sailor for the last eight years...or when he signed the corporate welfare "bailout".    Why the flip flop?|`|ugW9r4gRaa	Actually, future generations will be better off. I don't know how you can call infrastructure and education "pork" and keep a straight face. The future generations will do better if our roads and bridges are finally back to their Eisenhower-era quality, and with the federal education budget more than doubling we can perhaps eventually get to the same level of high quality education that many of our European allies have.    Our economy is in shambles, and the laissez-faire attitude of letting it fix itself is going to make things worse. Ever hear of Herbert Hoover? He made the same mistake, and Franklin Roosevelt had to step in and stop the country from completely collapsing. This is President Obama stepping in.    Now I understand that you're a right winger and have an unquenchable thirst to hate everything Obama does, but its a good thing someone that actually understands economics is in control of the country, and not you.|`|wfp6xn5aaa	"It is future generations that will have to pay for this pork."

They can move around city to city, state to state, or country to country. They are hard to nail down.  Next, it cost too much to apprehend them, bring them to justice and make them pay up.  They can also squeeze out of it by feigning injury or disability.  If they can't work, they can't pay is their line of thinking.  Meanwhile they go work for somebody under the table and the government can't track their income.  There are so many other ways that deadbeat dads can beat the system.  Some ways in which they are being caught however is when they file for unemployment or go to renew a driver's license or file for anything within local, state, or federal governmental offices.|`|85jy4Mt0aa	The U.S. has over 2 million persons in jails and prisons now.  Courts are reluctant, unfortunately, to jail persons for contempt of court in child support cases.  Adding more nonviolent offenders and persons who violate civil court orders means that some thief or rapist may have to be released early.    My 15 years experience in child support enforcement and my research in graduate school tell me that jailing non-payers is a very useful tool to motivate payment of child support.    Stay tough.  Keep pushing.  It is for your child.|`|C2U8qR8zaa	women dont take the baby daddy to court
QIQNzE11aa	I have had this happen a few times in my life. Mostly because my mind is always going a million miles an hour and i am always a few steps ahead of myself.     One time i noticed at the store that all my meat was on the bottom of the cart and had not been paid for! i went back in and paid for it all.     I once went through check out and bought a bunch of stuff, apparently a phone did not ring up. I didn't notice but later looking at my receipt at home it struck me i had not paid enough. I took the phone back in and said they could keep it. I hadn't opened it. But they said they could not take it back due to inventory. I then asked to pay for it and then return it but they would not do that either. It's still in the box, unopened and i hate having it hear knowing it wasn't paid for.     I had it happen a few times where i didn't notice a thing for a week or two. Those are always harder to handle but most still let me pay for it. It's not always me forgetting to pay for it, but sometimes the check out clerk doesn't ring it up.     Only twice have i not been able to pay for the problem, be it mine or theirs. normally theirs. I've also always returned any extra money given to me by any store clerk.     One doesn't have to be a crook or a thief to have this accidentally happen to them.|`|LzPhdri5aa	Yes.

yHwUbD6Saa	Integrity?  Well, let's see what Obama's done so far in TWO WEEKS....    1) Threw a $170 million party (pre-inaugural, inaugural, and post-inaugural) funded by the U.S. taxpayers (i.e. us), all in the celebration that his skin color is a shade or two darker than that of his opponents.    2) Supported and rushed through Congress a $700 billion bailout that did nothing to stimulate the economy and only increased our debt.    3) Is currently pushing through an almost $900 billion "stimulus bill" filled with things like $200 million for re-sodding the national mall (b/c it got destroyed during the racist, taxpayer-funded party mentioned in  1 above).    4) His nomination of Bill Richardson didn't go well due to scandal, and Richardson stepped down.    5) His appointee to head the IRS (Tim Geithner) didn't pay $34,000 in taxes that he owed, and Obama still supports him.    6) His nominee to reform health care (Tom Daschle) didn't pay $120,000 in taxes that he owed, and Obama still supports him.    7) He spent millions building three (two decoys) new limos despite the fact that Bush had new limos built only a few years ago. These new limos get fewer than 10 mpg for you "green" folks out there.    8) He spent millions putting a basketball court into the White House.    9) Millions of his bailout money to Bank of America funded a large pre-Super Bowl party.    10) He nominated one of the most scandalous, unethical people on the planet to be Attorney General (Eric Holder).  Holder pardoned a terrorist arms dealer in order to impress the dirt ball's defense attorney who was a close confidant of Al Gore in hopes that Holder would be nominated Attorney General if Al Gore won the Presidency after Clinton (Holder was deputy AG under Janet Reno).  He also blatantly lied about how the Elian Gonzales case was handled, stating that no night-time raid was conducted (it was) and that it was handled "sensitively" (despite the pic of a federal agent pointing an MP5 at a 6 year old with his finger on the trigger [violating the first rule of gun safety]).  His ethical transgressions could fill a tome.    11) He nominated a bona fide member of the National Socialist Party of the U.S. to be in charge of the environment. Her name was quickly removed from the Socialist party web site shortly thereafter.    12) He's closing Gitmo while we're seeing former detainees back committing acts of terror against the U.S. and our allies. These 200+ current detainees will likely end up inside the borders of the U.S. as a result. Smart move.    13) We've seen the largest post-election stock market slump in recorded U.S. history.

629034e3339524ef24ac26f37042059caa	I've been smoking for 40 years and feel the same way and have had similar experience as far as non-addiction and remaining in control. My life is far from ruined! It's illegal because of our government's pandering to the big corporations - here's a great link and a good read to explain.|`|EX1GjjJCaa	You are not alone. My friends and I were always straight A students, and we smoked pot frequently. I never had trouble stopping for any period of time. I actually went over half a year without smoking it with no problem stopping.     Who knows why it's illegal. I've heard many stories. I believe it's just because it was made illegal many years ago, and because it was illegal then that it needs to be kept illegal. There is no proof that it hurts your health but their is proof that it can help your health. I also believe that the government has the mindset that it is a 'gateway drug'. Which is very untrue. I would never try anything except pot, and the same goes for everyone else I know that smokes it.    People will continue to smoke pot regardless of it's illegal status. It is a natural drug, and the truth is that alcohol causes many more problems than marijuana. The U.S. would be a better place if it were legalized.|`|vOukAHowaa	Everyone has diff opinions about Marijuana- Personally i never did it and never will.Anyways my cousin started smoking it when she was in her early teens- and became addicted to it almost immediately- and she is now 46 and still does it and everyone in the family thinks thats why shes NUTS- and she is too- We think she has some sort of frontal lobe damage{Brain damage/So to speak} because of it.Matter a fact she grows it right NOW in her damn house and has 2 daughters that know all bout it and one is only 9- other is 21 and just like mom- a pop head all the way- neither one of them have a job/they dont even take showers-they dont fix their hair-they are both totally irrational and always bawling and starting fights w/ people over NOTHING- so i thnk it sure as hell DOES affect a person- maby not in the beginning but eventually it will show it effects,,,,,,,,,,|`|02965963da3f0165b81bd488737cfad3aa	Marijuana is a bit like alcohol. I have no problems about people smoking pot, just as I have no problems with people drinking whisky, provided they do not harm others by their indulgence.    It is illegal presumably because very young people get hold of it.    The best thing that could be done with drugs is to legalise the lot - `Class A and all. If, like you, you can cope with them, and still live a productive life without being a burden on the rest of us and your family, then get on with it. But it will have to be a three-strikes policy - Two hospitalisations, two felonies, two other problems or two combinations of one of these puts you on your last chance - after that it has to be institutional care (health, unless the strikes are felonies), until you are cured or deemed incurable.     The same should be done with alcohol- my sister died of it at 40 years of age.|`|1b6c195ba207883a224264d44c013600aa	Marijuana was made illegal when alcohol was made legal.  Something about keeping federal jobs.  Now that the US is fighting the 'war on drugs', there is a whole narc industry that would be at risk, not to mention all the fine money, prison guards, etc.      "In 1994, it was reported that the War on Drugs results in the incarceration of one million Americans each year.[1] Of the related drug arrests, about 225,000 are for possession of marijuana, the fourth most common cause of arrest in the United States."      Until the US Government can find another 'crime' where the criminal usually has money to be milked, I don't see them giving up this cash cow, even though its costs US taxpayers billions to enforce and any legal action ruins more lives than marijuana ever could.     People can sign petitions and support NORML.  Unless enough people make their voices heard, the laws won't change.  I can't believe people who have tried weed could be against it.  And if they have toked and are still against it, they are proof that weed does f**k up some peoples brain!|`|IW3jmnKbaa	Oh, dude, it gets me so friggin nuts, I like to take my guns and go driving around to find people I can rob ,or shoot, then I come home and kick the dog and scream at the kids for nothing, just cause i like to when I'm high. the cops keep telling me to get off the roof, cause I can't really fly, but I'll show them.  Oh, wait, that's when I drink.. duh.  When I blaze, I'm way mellow, ya know?  And you want to know why it's illegal? Well I'll tell you why it's illegal, it's illegal because...... it's illegal beca....... it just is, okay?  And if you ask anyone in the government that same question, you;ll get that same answer.   Reason being, the government doesn't have the "power" to make laws prohibiting pot.  It doesn't cause harm, the "war on drugs" causes harm. the "war on drugs" is a huge waste of money, resources, life, and a perfectly good medication that can't be duplicated in a lab.  The US government wastes $200 to$400 billion  a year on this "war on drugs", that in itself is a crime. All that money, over a 30 year span, and, if anything, drugs are better than 30 years ago, and easier to get.  Yet, the "drug czar" keeps spewing how they're winning the "war on drugs", nothing is further from the truth.The "war on drugs is an abysmal failure. Besides wasting trillions over the years, the hundred's of thousand's dead, it has done nothing but harm, lots of harm. it's the reason for all the violence associated with drugs. The government is bad for America, they used to be good for some stuff but not anymore, all they do is drive the country down, we got no respect from other countries anymore, they throw our money around like they're feeding the birds.  And the best is yet to come, Halliberten is building "FEMA" camps for the FEDS, about 800 of them, just in case of a "natural disaster" or something. Underground, in remote parts of the northwest, in secret.   The National Guard is conducting training exercises in small towns in the midwest, and their also "mobilized", meaning, against America.  Don't know about you but that scares the crap outa me.|`|QDaaC7ataa	I have friends who smoke.  Some can handle it just fine, like you.  Others smoked because they wanted to self medicate in my opinion.  Which led to them doing more intense drugs, hence the GATEWAY drug reference that marajuana is often associated with.

LNFg5KMuaa	Some Obama voters might have liked Ron Paul because as a libertarian he was for social freedom.  Such as equal rights for Gays and such, but there is an extremely big difference.  Obama as a social liberal believes in social freedom by regulating society, and using government programs and tax money to solve the problem.  Libertarians believe that government always ends up doing more damage than good, or at least not as good as a job, when government does something for the people that people can do for themselves.  In an interview with Rick Warren during the campaign even Obama had to admit that a large majority of private charitable organizations have done an extremely better job, at helping those less fortunate, than any government program has ever been able to do.|`|wVik8Fo7aa	The only issue that Paul and Obama have remotely in common is that of understanding that the Iraq War should never have been fought.
