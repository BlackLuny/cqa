QdQcAHqaaa	I'm not a professional, but you are definitely on the right track.  Bacteria loves to grow in damp, dark places. I used to go to a water camp where almost all the kids got ear infections due to not being properly cleaned out after getting wet, and the nurse would always tell us use a blow dryer to dry out our ears...and you know what? It worked every time.|`|syT3XUAraa	Floppy-eared dogs tend to have ear infections more than erect-eared dogs because the ear is darker and moister. Hanging her head out the window allowed air circulation, possibly helping with it, but I wouldn't let her do this anymore. Its very dangerous for a dog to lean out the window while you're going down the road; objects could get in her eyes, and you could unknowingly drive to close to something, such as a car, and she could get injured. Working with a vet for a year, I have seen several dogs injured because of this. Some states even issue tickets for it. As for the ear infections, I would suggest getting a mild antiseptic or cleaner made for cleaning dogs' ears and using it as often as the vet recommends. Most floppy-eared dog owners have to resort to doing this, and it will really help your dog.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	As the others pointed out how unsafe this action is I won't but I do suggest these sites. The first one deals with what causes yeast infections & ways to prevent & remedies. Definitely read this one.    http://www.dogearyeastinfection.com/what...    This one has a yeast remedy that was done for cockers & their ear issues but you can use it for your dog also.    http://zimfamilycockers.com/EarCleaner.h...|`|FewhKlx9aa	Thats dangerous as something can then fly into the eyes while driving.I don't think The clearing up of his ears has to do with the head out the window,I think it is more coincidental.The vet probably got all the bacteria but it will come back.I have the same problem and if at least once a week I clean them I seem to keep it at bay
UPTu7uIVaa	Kittens take a lot of effort on your part.  Scratching is a main issue.  An older cat will probably be calmer.  I know kittens are adorable but you are very right, a lot of adult cats are not given a chance for the sheer reason that they are an adult.  It is really sad, and kittens don't stay that small for very long.  Cats are also less expensive, as they have already had most of their shots.  When I got my kitten, he had had his first round of shots and been neutered, but needed additional shots.  An adult cat would only need boosters.  It is impressive to see a 13 year old acting so mature, and I'm sorry about your former kitty.|`|ab682b6840784d29891281987e3e32b2aa	I was in this same situation a couple months ago. I thought I wanted a kitten and was partial to an adult, but when I went to the shelter I ended up adopting an adult. You're right, kittens will ALWAYS be able to get adopted, but adult cats tend to get the short end of the stick.     Cons of kittens:  -Can be destructive  -Have to litter train  -More rambunctious...which can lead to sleepless nights.     Cons of adults:  -might have harder problems to get rid of (old habits and such).   -might also be destructive      I say go there, really look at all the cats that interest you kittens and all...and pick one that really stands out to you.|`|ilaAcjGvaa	that's a tough question, its true that getting an adult cat would probably save its life, as most people usually go for kittens. i think its a very genuine thing to do :)   but the draw backs of not getting a kitten is, your kitty wont live as long with you as a kitten would, it is already set in its own ways, and of course the joys of having a cute cuddly kittens udder dependence on you :)   but if you are concidering an adult cat, i really think you should go for it.|`|0hTvKlD5aa	Kittens are cute, but they grow right up in just a few months, and there's a LOT of work with raising them.  If I were you, I'd follow my heart and adopt an adult cat that needs a home. I'm so sorry to hear about your loss! My family just lost our old guy a few months ago to kidney failure.     Here he is at 23 years, a couple of days before we put him down: http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2wel0ut&...|`|A62mhxeiaa	I think both kittens and cats are really good.  However, the kittens do get adopted first, like you said.  There's a really high chance that the kittens will be adopted, and a smaller chance that an adult will be adopted.  If you adopt an adult, you're probably saving it from being in the shelter for the rest of its life.  Either one will be loving, but adults are probably more well behaved.  Good luck and have fun with your new kitty :)|`|msAh2tItaa	i would have to say the answer to your question would be to get a teenage cat they will still have the energy of a kitten just in a bigger package. teenage cats are 6 months to 1 1/2 years old. almost adult but not quite and most shelters and rescues have several up for adoption. i really commend you and your parents for adopting if more people would adopt and fix the animals they have we may not have as many animals in shelters being put down everyday.|`|56415cd786692379c9afc5baefcd0e37aa	go ahead and take the adult cat.  follow your heart. your head is WAY out of it's league here, trust me.|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	I applaud you for thinking about getting an adult cat over a kitten. You're right, lots of people ignore the grown cats because "kitten's are so cute".  Benefits of adopting adult cats are that you don't have to go through the annoying kitten phases of biting and training to use the litter box.  Adult cats are usually more ready for love an affection than a kitten that is more interested in play. I know a lot of people want the playful kittens but if you're like me you want a cat for a companion, not a playmate.  Also, some shelters give discounts on cats that have already been spayed or neutered and sometimes you can get cats that are already declawed. Oh, and just because a cat is declawed doesn't mean they can't go outside. I have 6 cats that came from animal shelters that are declawed and they love it outside and have no problems defending themselves or climbing trees. One of mine was declawed on all four paws and I was asked to take her because she was so antisocial. She warmed up to me after a few weeks and now is one of the best companions I have. She's also the biggest bully to the other cats despite not having claws.|`|YAPYO7L8aa	I'd take the cat as the kittens will probally get homes and the adults often put to sleep as no one wants them. But with getting an adult you can tell what there personality is! With a kitten you never can tell what they will be like grown up. Adults cats will love you dearly for saving them. They do seem to understand.  http://gastricbypass.homestead.com/Anima... (My kids)|`|YMOtXt93aa	How long do you say your home a day?   If its not a lot you should aim for a adult. If its a lot aim for a kitten. Kittens need more attention than adult cats. If I were you I would get an adult. Kittens are wild and keep you up all night. Adults are not as wild but are still very fun to be around.   You should get a 2 or 3 year old cat.|`|hj0aB3uMaa	Well the bad thing about having a kitten instead of an adult cat is that its going to need a lott more attention.Plus if its not trained to go in a litter box yet you would have to be patient and train it which might take a while.With an adult cat you don't have to worry about all the behavior problems that come with kittens and they don't need as much attention as they do. You shouldn't adopt a kitten if you don't have the time for it. If you really want a kitten and are willing to put all that time into it than a kitten would be perfect because they will grow up loving you.I hope this helps!|`|Zyb2MENKaa	I think that you should look at all of the cats and kittens and figure out which one seems to be calling to you. Don't just look at the ones that come up to the bars of the cage though, sometimes the best cats are the ones that simply look at you as you walk by. The ones that say "I'm not coming to you, you have to come to me."     You should go to a high-kill shelter and look at the cats that are going to be put down soon. Cats at no kill shelters don't have to worry about "the room that cats go in and don't go out."     Cons of kittens:  Have to be tought not to scratch and bite  May be too rambunctious for petting  May wake you up in the middle of the night with meowing    Pros of Adults:  Most are calm and love to be petted  Most love to cuddle    CATS MEOW, Chipmunk, and Penny|`|VkXQq2y2aa	I went through the same thing. I went to the shelter intending to get a kitten, but there were adorable house cats that were already fixed, litter boxed trained, and lovable. I decided to get an adult cat because kittens are such a handful, they are extremely fun and if i had more time to dedicate to the kitten, i would of gotten a kitten, but i didnt have much time..so i just got an adult cat that needed to be adopted by friday..it was tuesday that day..or else he was gonna be put down. he is sooo sweet and i love him and i saved his life. its totally up to you though. whichever cat or kitten your heart goes towardds...get that one. goodluck|`|XPB6Ogj0aa	I'd say get an adult.  They are already spayed/neutered and have all their shots.  They can be a bit more pricey than a kitten because all the work is already done, but in the long run a health adult cat is cheaper.    Most important follow your heart.  I have gone to shelters looking for a specific cat/kitten and came home with another one entirely because they grabbed my heart.  This is the one for you.  The one that grabs your heart regardless of age, color, body type, sex, etc.|`|x0WZE0i4aa	I'm not sure where your head is at *G* Most people there head would be telling them to get an adult!  I think the reasons have been covered...     If by any chance you are in S.E England, and might be able to go for the adult AND kitten option some have suggested, then the Celia Hammond Trust have a great policy of re homing any mum cats that come in with one of their kittens.  They also do a 'foster to re home' scheme, where people foster a mum and litter that's too young to re home, then keep some of the family permanently. Also they find black and black and white cats hardest to home, so maybe you could go for one of that colour?    As it's come up in an answer: declawing is definitely not on the list of things needed... in fact it is illegal in the UK for very good reasons.  Cats having it done suffer severe pain (in some cases for the rest of their lives) and lose much of the natural use of their feet.  It's often done because kittens don't know how to keep their claws to themselves: a stage most grow out of.  And cats that have had it done are more likely to bite.|`|Bnkx4Wozaa	Kittens are like a white piece of canvas - really corny but true. You have the ability to shape its future, aide them while they grow into wonderful cat and help them shape their personality. That said, kittens are very curious, playful, sometimes very aggressive (while being pet, playing) and have tonnes of energy. Ever heard of the kitty night crazies? They are a handful but it's good to have them around and they do bring a lot of joy into your life.    Kittens require a lot more work and the cost of bringing up a kitten can be staggering high, depending on where you live. With the regular check ups and vaccinations, it will burn quite a hole in your pocketbook. Also, before bringing a kitten home, make sure she is old enough, 8 weeks - 10 weeks is the general agreement here. If she is from a shelter, she should have been medically certified as healthy, receive all the first round of immunizations and be spayed/neutered. If you get the kitten elsewhere, then you are responsible in getting her all the medical care needed.    Two kittens is always better than one, but I have personally raised a single kitten with not much problems. That said, if possible, bring home two kittens, littermates preferably so they can grow up together and be life long companions. They amuse each other and life can be less taxing since they wouldn't demand as much attention as a single kitten.    That said, adult cat has many advantages too. They are well established and you can tell their temperament. They have a way in the world and will adjust adequately to any new environment. They require less intensive care and can be pretty much self sufficient in terms of attention and companionship.    Adult cat brings along years of experience living with humans and they are less likely to cause trouble. They do well with children and some are very good lapcats, if you have a more sedentary lifestyle. They are extremely loving, if being socialized properly early in life and less demanding.    There is also a category between kitten and adult, and that is a young adult between the age of 2-5. They make wonderful companions too!    It is entirely up to you to figure out whether a kitten or an adult cat will fit into your lifestyle. Whatever you choose, be sure to read up on how to take good care of your cat. It is a huge responsibility and not one that is to be taken lightly. However, the amount of love and affection you receive in return, makes caring for a for cat well worth it.|`|VMY7No0eaa	I would say get an adult... make sure they are neutered / spayed   I just got a 1 yr old after my 21 yr old dies... and he is as cute as a button!   olders cats are harder to get homes for so go that way.|`|d90ff91e5a5e8b266b8723372b08326aaa	If you get an adult cat: you won't have to pay to get it spayed, or all it's needles, and deworming. Maybe it will even already be declawed. So your furniture stays in one piece. Then there is a kitten, who wants to play at all times, even in the middle of the night, needs extra attention, will  claw up your bed, couch etc... Needs to be trained. Needs to be dewormed, shots, spayed, and declawed. That is very expensive to go to a vet. So my vote would be get an adult cat if your not rich, or get a kitten if your rich. Have a nice day....|`|MqYfsYd0aa	you might not have this option... but i just adopted both an adult and a kitten :)    kittens are very high energy and will get into places and things you don't want them to be.  believe me, it can be unbelievably cute sometimes, like my kitten who drags around my boyfriends jock strap around the house.   the bad thing is that she drags it into our bed at 4am.  it's lovely.    adult cats are much more laid back, but their personalities are rather set.  chances are if she's a mean old puss, then she'll remain a mean old puss.    i felt so bad getting a kitten when i adopted, because there are lots of adult cats out there who also need a loving home.  but the best thing in the end is to go with your gut feeling.  but do get out there and see what cats are in the shelters, and get into a room to visit with them.  you never know which of the cats might steal your heart in then end!|`|w1lh1INHaa	A kitten is only a kitten for a few weeks.  A cat is a cat for the rest of its life.    Yes, everyone wants a kitten, and the older cats get left behind and are the first to be put down.    With two exceptions, my cats have been cats when I got them.  There is something to be said for a cat that has mellowed out (no kitten attacking your toes in the middle of the night when you have an exam the next day), you already have a good idea of the personality, and all those pesky and expensive vet needs have been handled.    A kitten will go to anybody's home, but when you find an older cat that says to you, "I want you to take me home," you know you will have a loyal cat for the rest of its life.    Good luck, and thank you for considering an older cat.|`|koJ3bdYTaa	It's wonderful that your heart is open to adult cats!   I first adopted an adult cat (then kittens later) because I felt the same way as you, and it's true:  they're there, alone, and want a good home just as much as a kitten.      Pros of adult cats:  they have more regular schedules so there's less of chance of keeping you up all night.  They are typically less destructive.  And they are often more independent, and can be kept as a single cat, whereas kittens should really be adopted in pairs. (talk to adoption rep about this)    Cons: they may have habits that you can't effect, or have sensitivities that you don't know about (ie: don't touch my belly!) until you get scratched.  They will require a lot of your patience and quiet attention to the cat's reactions and signals so that you can find a harmonious relationship.  You're both getting to know each other, so it takes time.  And you can't punish the animal, you can only do your best to (re)train them.    Pros of kittens:  they are undeniably adorable!  And you can train them how you need to.  You can ensure that they don't become "biters" by only playing with them with toys, reinforcing that human hands are for love and food only.  You can also control how much they are socialized with people and other animals so that you have a social friendly adult cat.  You can play with their paws and little toes everyday so that it's easy to clip their nails, get them used to brushing their teeth so that they don't have health problems later, etc.    Cons:  you HAVE to train them.  They will chew, scratch and rip apart nearly anything if they can get their paws on it.  If they weren't weened properly, they may cry a lot for no reason, suck on your furniture, your earlobes, your shirt, etc, and they might not clean themselves properly either.  (having another cat of kitten around helps with this, as they take care of each other)  They also have a lot of energy, and require a LOT of attention.  If you don't play with them, they will let you know that they are not happy about it at all!    I adopted two kittens (sisters) last summer, but only because I was working from home and I had the time to really bond with them.  I spent 5 months with them for the majority of every day, and it has made a difference because the training was consistent.  If I wasn't able to spend that time with them, I would definitely have adopted an adult cat.    But really, you should try to spend a lot of time with any new animal at the beginning of your relationship.    Hope this helps, and the best of luck to you!  Any feline would be lucky to go home with you!
zpwJR60baa	Hi, I am a cat behavior. Cat at this age have a lot of energy. What you can do is get heavier food bowl, and feed only during feeding time.  Water only half full.  Go get some cat toys, and make sure to have daily play time about 20 mins, 3 times a day.  Best toys is the string, noodles or feathers.  This is use up their energy, and a happier cats.     Good luck!|`|MqYfsYd0aa	my cat used to get food in his water bowl all the time... and even knock it over from time to time.  what i ended up doing was making a separate area for his water, and using the 2 in 1 bowl for dry and wet food.  no water.  try the suggestion of a much heavier water bowl, or even go as far as i did and get the cat a water fountain.|`|b8f5bc89c528383d165158426b57b42faa	Get a heavy water bowl that he can't get under.|`|x0WZE0i4aa	Get a new, heavier food dish.    Get a play ball of the type you can put dry food inside, so he can play at batting it around to get the food out.  Pringles tubes are good too (if you have them where you are: I'm in the UK)    Put the water somewhere else.  Some cats don't like to eat and drink in the same place anyway, so you won't do any harm to move it!|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	kittens love to play with the most annoying things.

Now, being an intelligent animals, I doubt it will go for the "found you in a cabbage patch" bs, so explain the birds and bees...wait...might want to forget about the birds or it will lose focus...then when the cat understands all the aspects of sex, it will be chomping on the bit to get altered (especially if it is a female).|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	You do not have to teach any animal about mating it is not called sex as they do not do it for pleasure but instinct.Cats can become pregnant from 16 weeks of age so who ever said 6 months does not know anything about cats.Cats are prolific breeders and come into heat several times a month and it will drive you mad as they yell and that is called calling.If a male do you really think you need to teach a male of any description what to do it comes naturally.These are not children who do not understand about sex until older han toddlers so l am not sure if you are puling our legs or you are really genuine.My advice if a female have it de-sexed ASAP.If a male it may and will spray unless neutered And the smell is awful.Up to you its your cat not ours and you have to live with it.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	After you take her/him in to be spayed or neutered.

You don't have to teach cats to hunt either, or walk, or anything.     But if you want to know when they are sexually developed:  Some females can start having kittens when they are as young as six months old    Males usually can't have kittens untill they are about a year and a half.

UHv71AN5aa	Ask your Vet for ACE, (Acepromazine) they will know what it is when you ask for ACE. I have to give my dog these during the holidays because of all of the people and action, which makes him very nervous. This is a sedative that goes by body weight. It clams them down and works extremely well. And they are still able to go about their normal routine, just a little slower and calmer. There are no side affects. I wrap the pill(s) in a bit of cheese and give it to him that way.|`|syT3XUAraa	There is a type a mild sedative that you can buy from pet stores that works really well. I can't remember the brand, but it's very popular, so you should be able to find it easily. There is different types of it, depending on what they are going to be used for (car rides, thunderstorms, relocating, post-surgery, etc). It's in a pill form and is relatively mild compared to some of the stuff you get from the vet, but at the same time really calms dogs.|`|vPde97E2aa	Yeah,it's called TRAINING!!!!!  Funny how how so few people have ever heard of the concept & would rather poison an animal than actually WORK.|`|ZqEv8sS1aa	give him a little benidryl,that works.|`|RLvIDudYaa	I'd ask your vet.

Even benadryl can help. I would discuss this with your vet and see what he suggests.  Medications are weight based in dogs.|`|xEGB2rQ9aa	Valium ask you vet about it. I used it on my dog.  she is the same way but worse|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	You have plenty of time to get your dog over the anxiety and shyness before getting on the train. I would work on correcting this before giving him any meds. Meds won't cure the problem. I would enroll into obedience classes to boost his confidence. You would be surprised. My dog was scared when I got her from the shelter. Paience will go a long way. Work in small steps. Try the yard and in front of your house to play and reward with treats, then move to walking him down the street, talking to him and praising him. There is so much you can do, just enroll and read books. I agree to what was said before, what ever happend to training?|`|m57ylQ03aa	As some have mentioned before Benadryl will take the edge off your dog for the trip, but Bach Rescue Remedy will work better.  Do a google search to find where to buy it.  It is all natural ingredients.   I have been using it for my corgi now for gun fire and fire Crackers and it is working to calm him when he hears these things.  It is liquid and works.     good Luck.    there is no training for Fear, just Love.
OWGBAiXtaa	From what I've seen on websites, good breeders often do not list prices.  I'd take that as a sign that the breeder is conscientious.  I'd also take it as a sign that they have a very stringent screening process.  If you just email the kennel and ask how much they charge for a puppy, it may reflect badly on you in their eyes.     If you are serious about buying a puppy from them, email them and ask about upcoming litters as they suggest on their website.|`|oGVWdnHraa	The fact that they dont have their price on their website is a good thing, any site with dogs on it that has their price you should steer clear of because more than likely they are a puppy farm or backyard breeder.     :)|`|Bw18seFqaa	Reputable breeders dont list their prices.. prices depend on male or female, pet, working or show dog..  and can also vary depending on the bloodline as well.. if the sire was a nice multi-titled import, the pups may cost more.    Contact the breeder to find the price.|`|iAnHkVp5aa	about 120 if ur buying from a local kennal (thats how much mine cost)|`|RLvIDudYaa	No.  Many breeders don't list their prices.

AA12083992	Probably both but start with the vet in case there is an obstruction.     Our pets need quality  food. Read the ingredients list and learn what the stuff on there is and what it does (or does not do) to/for our pets. A quick pet food 101. If the pet food contains corn/corn products or by products it is a poor quality food. Corn is a filler that can trigger skin problems. (allergies, skin problems, itching and excessive shedding) By products is anything from an animal not fit for human consumption, including cancerous tissue. Do not pay attention to advertising, they all say there food is great. "Vet approved" means they have a vet on staff to approve their product. In other words, someone paid to approve it. Same with foods most vets recommend. Salesmen "gift" vets then the vet recommends the food. Most vets are not nutritionists! Quality foods have meat as the first ingredient Wellness, Solid Gold, Innova and Merrick are a few of the best brands available.

I'm still working on training my 4 1/2 month rottie. I think some people think well, why is this person having so much trouble getting the pup to go outside, it soooo simple. No it isn't. My pup came from a bad home, she's afraid of everything, when we do have a walk where she doesn't completely freak out she still rarely goes even after hours and waits til we get inside to pee/poop. And on top of it, if she does decide to go where she shouldn't, has anyone ever tried to stop a 50 lb. puppy from going pee by picking her up? Doesn't work. At least mine goes in same spot now and then she whines for me to clean it up;). All I can say is be patient, rotts and chows are stubborn breeds and it could take awhile before he is fully housebroken just be patient and when he gets it right give lots of praise! Good luck to you both!    Oh and I don't know if your pup let's you know if it needs to go out or not like one person mentions but mine never has...only tells me after she has gone. Allpuppies are not alike so you have to work out a plan that works best for you and your pup.|`|OhkY8n7Yaa	I don't know... Try the smacking with newspaper thingy!!!|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Why not just train him to go outside and when you can't be home, keep him confined to an area of the house with uncarpeted floors like the kitchen until he is old enough to be crate trained.  And he is really young still- he probably won't be fully housebroken until about 6 months, so have patience.  Take him for walks on a leash when he wakes up, about 30 minutes after he eats or plays. That should help.|`|UyAGXNCsaa	Don't use the pads.  They confuse the heck out of your poor dog - first you're teaching them to pee in the house, then correcting it later on and trying to teach them to go outside.  Just skip the pads and go straight for outside.  And it's easy.  If you crate train, it really helps.  Take the puppy outside at least once an hour to the spot you want them to go, and pet them.  If they go, praise the heck out the puppy.  If the puppy goes in the house, immediately show it to the puppy (don't rub it's nose in it - just show it to the puppy) and say "NO" in a firm (not yelling) voice.  Then immediately take it outside to the spot you want the puppy to go and pet him.  If the puppy is in a crate at night, it will probably cry every couple of hours - take it outside.  If it goes, praise it highly.  Believe me, in time he'll get it. Be consistent - it's the key.|`|lbXKEKnjaa	Whatever You Do Just Be Patient With Him...He's  Like A Baby And You Got To Treat Him Like One.  Make A Room For Him Somewhere Comfortable, Put Pads All Over The Floor (Even Under/Around His Food Dish) And Week By Week Slowly Take The Pad Off Block By Block (But Of Course ALWAYS Change It When He Makes A Doo-Doo).  Then You'll See The Results Till He Learns To Go Outside (When Then AGAIN You Have To Train Him How To Let You Know He Wants To Go Outside & Use It).  Don't Worry You'll Get The Hang Of It :)  Oh Also If I Were You...I Would TOTALLY Get Him His Shots So He Won't Get Pravo (Very Serious)!!!!!!!!  Cause I Lost My Pitt/Boxer Dogs To It And It Was Very Sad And A Little Too Late.  So Please Get Him His Shots While He's Still Young :)|`|XI7JLX6gaa	maybe u have to be a lil bit more harsh in the way to train him.  lets say he does his thing on the pads. praise him for that give him a lil treat0  but if he goes off the pad.  scoled him for that and put him in his cage and take him out an hr later. point to his nose and tell him bad and not to do that  and even take his toys away from him.  after a whole routine i think he should get the point & learn from it.  dogs are very smart they should get it      & after that for a while take him outside to use the bathroom.  usually when u see them sniffing around alot shows hes looking for a spot to mark up.  its all step at a time|`|eyQBvbzraa	TRAINING HIM ON PUPPY PADS LETS HIM KNOW ITS OK TO GO IN THE HOUSE. TAKE HIM FOR WALKS AFTER HE EATS AND BRING TREATS AND PRAISE HIM AND MAKE A BIG DEAL OF HIM GOING OUTSIDE. BEFORE LONG HE WILL BE HAPPY TO GO OUTSIDE. AND YOU CANT BE LAZY. WHEN HE IS WHINING TO GO OUT YOU MUST GET UP AND TAKE HIM OR ITS YOUR FAULT.PUPPIES HAVE LITTLE BLADDERS. KEEP THE TOILET LID CLOSED TOO. THEY GET EXTRA WATER FROM THERE AND THEN THEY PEE. SORRY ABOUT THE CAPS. MY EYES HURT TODAY.|`|5d1b02ab1bdd8a707c44ed1acdcec31daa	I do not feel puppy pads are an efficient way of training pups. They have to learn that at no time is it OK to go in the house anywhere!    I would start taking him outside regularly about every two hours and 15 minutes after he eats. Praise him if he goes while he is outside.    If he starts to go in the house stop him with a quick no command and take him outside. They learn best this way.|`|kkM8vFfKaa	Don't use the pads anymore. They are a waste of money. As a previous answer stated, they teach the dog it's OKAY to go inside the house. How I trained my puppy was take him out every hour or so. If he went pee or poop outside, we came in, stopped at the door, and I handed him a treat. This way, any time he went pee or poop outside he associated that with getting a treat, and also as being a good thing. This will teach your puppy it's a good thing to go outside and that he will be praised for it. Eventually when he's got the hang of it you can ease off the treats, giving him one every couple of times he goes outside. Good luck!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Well duh, of course the dog isn't go to go stand on where he just peed to take a poo.  Would you?    Paper training is asking for trouble anyway.  Unless you have a toy breed, which you most certainly do not, teach them to go outside.|`|E7GwqMotaa	i got a puppy also she is 4 month now i got her since she was 8 weeks.    the paper training will take you about a month to get it right , don't forget that the puppy still have weak bladder .    also you need to catch the puppy in action peeing on the carpet and not after.    when you catch the dog just tell her NO and put her in the kennel and wait till she pee or poop then give her a treat and let her out do this like 10 times and she will get the idea .  my puppy learned she need to pee outside already so just patient|`|35af96d129cd907f1fda99cdb8167295aa	You should be training the puppy to go outside.  The idea behind the puppy pads (which are a huge waste of money) or newspaper is to cover areas from getting soiled.    I have a dog. Trust me, time and effort put in now will save you so much grief and money in the long run.  Create a routine and schedule for the puppy.  First thing in the morning when it wakes up, take the puppy outside. Feed the pup, take him out again. During the day crate the puppy but use a big enough crate that he/she isn't cramped. Dogs, generally will not soil the area they sleep in. The moment you get home, take the puppy out.  Feed, then take him/her out again. Then once more before bed time.  It sounds like a lot but as the puppy gets older he/she won't need to go as frequently.  At this stage, it's not really about punishing your pooch it's about teaching your pup to do the right thing.    Good luck!|`|q28VSNueaa	I wouldn't train him that way if I were you.  It will teach him that it is okay to pee and poo on anything laying in the floor.     It takes time to train them and it does get frustrating but he will get the hang of it.  At 10 weeks old, his still not old enough to be able to control his bladder.  Just be patient and it will happen.|`|f3e3995482cfe1f0696a3a95fa2b6ed1aa	Dont let him go pee in the house at all, Put him in his kennel with a pad but when he is out just be consistant and keep in pottying outside  of the house!

It stops all of the "drama" that the heat cycles provide....    The ONLY 2 things that will stop a heat cycle are......pregnancy ( NOT advisable ) and SPAYING....ADVISABLE.......    Besides, a spayed cat has a decreased risk of developing CANCER of the uterus and mammary ( breast ) glands in later years.  Not to mention, ALL of you will be happier without the (seemingly) constant howling, moaning, butt in the air, trying to escape that's going on right now.    You're lucky that she hasn't gotten out and become pregnant!!  Get her fixed ASAP.....as soon as this heat is over.......or NOW, if the vet will do it.  Some will......some won't.    Hope this helps.......and ALL of you can relax SOON.....  :-  Good luck.

aCqSF87Raa	Give him time to think about it - keep a few things in mind:    One, you are renting a house.     That means he will have to pay a deposit for the dog. And the rent may rise a bit to cover and "damages" that may be done by a dog. This also MAY mean no dogs what-so-ever right now. It depends on the lease agreement he signed. There may be a "no pets" thing or there may be a limited pets thing.    Two, dogs are VERY expensive.     The cheapest route, adoption, means you'll be spending $100-$300 on the dog. The more expensive route, buying from a breeder, means $400-$1,000+. Then there will be the initial start-up fees (toys, crate, food, bowls, etc) at $200 give or take, and a first vet check at about $200 depending on what's needed. Monthly fees will run about $150 and emergency fees can soar over a thousand.    Dad pays around $1,500 a month for the house, utilities, cable and internet, hot water, heat/AC, etc. He just finished college (?) and i don't know about his work situation, but he either has a full time job or will have one soon (hopefully.) He may feel that the extra cost of a dog is not an option right now.    Three, dogs are a lot of work.     It isn't all fun and games - you have to pick up after the dog, clean up messes, brush the dog (daily to weekly), schedule and keep appointments, walk the dog (again daily or every other day), potty training, teaching manners, obedience training, etc.     Again, if he's working and worried that you won't do your part... that may make him think long and hard about it. He certainly won't want to walk the dog every night after work when you could have done it earlier in the day.    Four, your life may be too hectic.    I'm talking about school - you'll be in school five days out of the week from 8-4 (roughly.) Eventually you will also have a job to go to after  school and on weekends. Then you'll have days where you'll want to go out and do things with friends. If dad isn't around, the dog will more than likely be crated and left alone.    Eventually you will also have to think about college. I don't know how old you are, but a dog will be around a long time. Dad may not want to be responsible for a dog while you are away at college - no dogs in dorms and most places require freshmen to live in dorms.    Just keep all of that in mind when you're nagging him and whining about it.|`|Bw18seFqaa	perhaps 5 years ago when your dad said he'd get a dog.. he had also anticipated getting a house, and not renting by the time he had his PHD.      You dont have to wait until you're 30..  if your parents dont want a dog, you only have to wait until you are 18, have your own job and your own place.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	You should realize that you don't always get what you want, right when you want it.

If it is, you may have to wait until your family is able to buy a home of your own.|`|MOxlXocfaa	haha!! well it was the same way for me too.. you will get a dog when the time is right.. you know now days most people dont even have any money to live so its hard to afford something like a dog.. most people say they are alot of work and they are but they also are great animals!! hopefully if you study hard and get a good job you could have all the dogs you want and thats what my mom always used to tell me!! well i wish you the very best of luck!!|`|35af96d129cd907f1fda99cdb8167295aa	VOLUNTEER!  I say this because volunteering your time with animals will give you a better idea of what is required to take care of them. I love my dog but he costs me a lot of money, he is a big responsibility and he'll never grow up and leave for college ;-)    Plus by volunteering you'll be able to fulfill your need for interaction with animals. There are a lot of great animals in shelters that need volunteers.    Also, keep in mind. If you are renting your home the landlord may not allow dogs or may charge a fee (monthly/one-time) for having a pet. Not to mention you are financially on the hook for any damage the dog causes. Trust me, your dog/puppy will do damage. It's the nature of the beast :)    Good luck!|`|NcFw7oowaa	The problem is that your Dad does not seem to want a dog as badly as you do and if he will be the one who ultimately ends up paying for the vet bills, etc.and his heart isn't in having one in the first place then really there isn't anything you can do about it.  As far as renting, that is something you would need to discuss with your landlord, be prepared that if you do adopt a dog, that he or she is a lifetime commitment and they move when you move and it's not to a shelter.|`|vRG0ebayaa	Talk to him about it, and tell him how much you want one, then talk about other things, money, supplies, school/college? Consider what dog would suit your family and house the most, and check with your house owner if you're allowed a dog in a rented house.     Good Luck|`|PM23RDycaa	Stop asking.    Do you even know if you are allowed pets in your rental lease?    Do you plan on paying for this dog yourself?    What about college? Only about 5 in the country allow pets.    Are your parents financially able to afford a dog?    Do you plan on giving up plenty of your personal free time up to devote to training, feeding, exercising etc in regards to this dog?    Best bet is to wait til YOU are old enough to be living on your own and can afford to get a dog to get one then    What NOT to do  -Beg/plead/nag.anything that can be seen as annoying/immature/and disrespectful of the answer already given to you  - Act like your life is over because you can't have a dog  -Bring home a dog and expect your parents to be ok with it  -Start doing your chores/homework etc without having to be asked to told simply to get a dog. You should be doing these things already    What you can do  -Ask and ask why once and only once  -If you are old enough volunteer at your local shelter or rescue. You get to be around dogs even if you can't live with one.|`|UyAGXNCsaa	When you grow up and have your own place and pay all the bills, you can have all the dogs you want.  If it's your step dad's place, it's his rules - period.  They're expensive and a lot of work.  Get a fish instead.|`|Eug52iQDaa	Getting a dog is a family decision.  If it's still not the right time, with renting and all, you can still have the company of a dog!      Talk to your family about fostering, perhaps, for a local rescue or the pound in your area.    OR.. Talk to a rescue or the pound (depending on your age) about volunteering there.      Sometimes you just have to do the best that you can under certain circumstances.  Either way, you get the dog fix, and you are helping a homeless dog too!
Bw18seFqaa	call your vet.    The craisin itself wont cause a problem..   grapes and raisins are toxic, but not dried cranberries (my dog gets them as treats!)    not eating, heaving and vomiting indicates that there is a problem.. but I highly doubt its related to her eating a craisin.|`|jmz0VTR7aa	One craisin shouldn't hurt her, however, it does sound like she might be ill. Call your vet. Most vets will take phone calls for free. Unfortunately, no one can diagnose your dog over the internet. Your vet will be able to judge from her symptoms what might be wrong, and decide if you need to bring her in or not.|`|s23w0I3Baa	um call your vet for advice, a-duh|`|MERgQTRUaa	since she threw up, she should be fine. If these "symptoms" are still occuring I would reccomned calling your family vet and explaining what happened. Sometimes they can even help you on the phone and you don't have to go in.    I hope she is feeling better.|`|q0vKbocHaa	take her to he vet, if she hasen't eaten her food and is throwing up, then something mroe could be wrong, like a blockage in her intestines|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Do you mean a raisin?    Those can actually cause renal failure in dogs - get it to a vet, asap.|`|AaXl3vcCaa	a craisin will not do anything bad to her so it has to be something else, take her to the vet
vwEnKqZ6aa	That rumor that reptiles only grow big enough to fit in their enclosure is not true. U will just get them sick. Corn snakes don't stop growing until at least 3 and a hlaf feet. Sum can reach 6 feet but its rare. if the corn snake is a baby u can hav him in a 10 gallon for about a year. After that u'd hav to move up to at least a 20 gallon. I recommened a 30 gallon just to give them more room to roam around.|`|Jguzosm2aa	They grow no matter what size tank they're in. 4-6 feet.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	It won't be able to live in that 10 gallon tank forever.  Eventually you will need at least a 20 gallon.  It's fine for now if you have a baby.    They get to be 4-6 feet long depending on how much they are fed and their genetics.|`|hGp8XtVKaa	it depends on what type of corn snake and your snake grows to fit your tank so don't go any more
Ka3fbxszaa	We have a huge tank that houses 5 red-earred sliders. Lots and lots of aeration is important. I like to have mine set so the water really gets a lot of movement on the surface. We also use 2 underground...side mounted filters. Our water stays crystal clear..REALLY! No more green nasty water! I also think it would help your tank if you layered some rocks on the bottom. I would use big sized ones if I were you so they don't try to eat 'em. The rocks will help the debris stay at the bottom and not get kicked around by the turtles.    They are messy little guys, I know but I finally found a way to not have to change the water every week. In fact, we care for it now like you would a fish tank...with occassional water changes.    Here is a pic of the type of filters I am talking about, not the exact one I use but an idea:  http://www.aquariumguys.com/whisperintan...|`|46Mxaw13aa	i work at a petstore and i get this question all the time i always recommend the fluval submersible water filters and definitely some gravel will help keep some ofthe debris down but make sure u clean the gravel often otherwise itwill hold tons of waste and crap and make ur water dirty.  Also u can buy a water additive called turtle clean that helps breakdown turtle waste and will keep thetanks water a little cleaner.
P2EhkEJVaa	yes you most defently can. they live in the desert so why not. thats what i use for mine|`|j3vOWiPUaa	Australian dessert is not sandy, it is hard packed clay. So i have been told not to use sand ever.     IDK, i'm a new beardie owner too!|`|xoXkHOVsaa	Don't use sand for a baby.  They can become impacted.  For an adult it isn't a problem.    They don't live on the finely sifted sand that you buy in the pet store.  They live on dry rocky dirt in the wild.|`|c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	"don't they live in sand?"  No.  They live on hard packed dirt and rocks... not sand.  There is chance of impaction with all types of sand, with calcium sands being the worst choice.  It's also very unsanitary, gets in every thing and needs to be completely replaced at least once a month.  A better choice would be slate or ceramic tiles.  You buy them ONCE and can sanitize them one at a time.  You can't completely get rid of the bacteria in sand.|`|kBek6QCLaa	You can, it's your own personal decision, but beware of impaction, most cases with baby beardie's.    "There are a number different substrates that can be used, what you do use is a matter of personal choice. A lot of people use sand or wood chip but I wouldnt recommend this as both can cause impaction of the gut and lead to death if not treated.    In my opinion if you value your reptiles health sand should never be used, repti-sand is said to be safe but it can still cause impaction"    I have an adult bearded dragon, and I use newspaper,   although a month ago I was doing half and half, half newspaper and half playsand,  I took it out because I had to clean his cage,because he had mites    Since he eats and poops on the newspaper, it's fine, I make sure he eats the crickets and such on the newspaper only|`|9QHwLQEraa	I used Calcium Sand once and it started to stink very fast. And yes I clean feces out daily! I use paper towels, sure it's not the most pretty thing a cage could have, but it's very easy to clean. Just remove the towel that's dirty, and put in new ones! I suggest using a layer of paper towels, and not just one, that way stuff won't soak through.|`|8zQjC8oTaa	My vet doesn't recommend that sand be used in any lizard cages as they might end up accidentally ingesting too much, which could make them quite ill as mentioned in a previous answer.  However, if you do wish to use sand, you should purchase Zoo Med Repti-Sand.  It's an all-natural substrate for desert dwelling reptiles made of pure, very fine quartz desert sand--better than common silica sand.  It also stimulates natural digging and burrowing behavior.  Another good option (perhaps a better choice) is T-Rex Calci-Sand or Zoo Med Vita-Sand.  It's the only substrate for reptiles designed to be not only ingestible, but digestible when swallowed. Many reptiles freely eat particles of sand and other substrates in an effort to gain the calcium that they require.  T-Rex Calci-Sand allows this process to occur naturally in their habitat.  In the case of my own Bearded, I laid down a layer of sand then covered it with another substrate such as coconut bark or fir tree bark (both available from Zoo Med).
kWwgWSSgaa	After being diagnosed with a ruptured cruciate, DJD & dysplasia in the stifle, Tori had TPLO surgery on 13th November 2008.     Apart from an edema, (swelling in the surrounding tissue) the first two weeks following her overnight stay at the veterinary referral hospital for the TPLO surgery were without incident. Tori was not allowed on chairs, to use the stairs and to go on walks, but all fairly easy to manage.    From week three Tori was allowed lead 5/10 minute walks up to 4 times a day. Tori loved being out and about again, but less thrilled with the lead only exercise.     At just over one month after Tori had her operation she appeared to be making very satisfactory progress. She went on four ten minute walks a day & enjoyed them, but was clearly fed up with short lead walks, as she would sooner be off lead chasing squirrels!    Tori went back for check up at the veterinary referral hospital on the 30/12/08 & given the good news that the plate had taken and the bone was healing well. I am now able to gradually increase her exercise.    Surgery was the best interest for Tori, as the ruptured cruciate would have only continued to deteriorate if left. There has already been a vast improvement in her comfort and mobility & she continues to make very good progress.    By the end of March this year, I will be able to exercise her off lead again.|`|3zv2bbolaa	There have actually been some recent studies showing that there is no difference between the many different methods of repair: TPLO, TTA, extracapsular etc. TPLO seems to be favorable for larger breeds.
3zv2bbolaa	Despite that fact that was their foundation purpose, German Shepherds are rarely used in real life as stock dogs in modern times outside of trial events. I don't think I can recall a single ranch using a GSD or any mix there of for sheep or cattle work.    Their primary modern job is to be protection, working and guardian dogs.|`|PM23RDycaa	Its not that your thinking is wrong its that GSD have been both herders and guard dogs. They are the most common dog used for police and military work. Honestly that is the first things that come to people's minds when they think of the GSD.|`|6wSmZrrsaa	Well they serve as police officers who guard the peace|`|9a056324e084aa96722167b89dc65ce2aa	I never saw the commercial, but it wouldnt bother me. I have a GSD and I like to think she is a guardian, of the house and us, but I do realize that technically she is a herder.|`|p7swtBYzaa	It's annoying alright, but these people don't care about truth or accuracy or they wouldn't be making corn meal based junk food for dogs and selling it as good for them.    More annoying to me is the beneful commercial - cutesy shapes made out of corn meal and fillers, dyed with artificial dyes and made to look like real meat, veggies, etc. to appeal to dog owners.   Sure isn't decent food for dogs.|`|ktVkRc3Raa	I think that the most noble and guardian dog would definitely have to be the Rottweiler! They are so big and can kill like anything. (BE AWARE!) So to answer this question yes this commercial does bother me because I have a sheltie/collie and his name is Cody.|`|26PPwzrWaa	The whole commercial bugs me. People support a great cause by giving their dogs awful food.|`|9MjaiYj4aa	It doesn't bother me|`|Bw18seFqaa	shepherds are honestly used more for guardian than herding, even tho they are a herding breed.   There are some herding breeds that are actually more livestock guardians than actual herding dogs..  they were bred and trained to protect the herd/flock.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	It is a commercial who cares? They also test on animals and have poor quality dog foods That seems worse than the comercial.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	No,it doesn't bother me.GSDs ARE wonderful guardians.They do police work,military work,drug detection and they guard their families as well. Most dogs are guardians of their "flock",but the GSD is famous for doing so.And they did used to be in the working group before they split the groups.Of course I hate to see a GSD chained in a junkyard,but I don't think that's what they are getting at.|`|ajnGHNr8aa	When I think of GSD I think of police dogs, search and rescue dogs and military dogs befre I think of an actual herding dog. The GSD has gotten a great reputation as a guardian due to these uses. It should be worn as a badge of honor and I for one would not be upset about it. Most dogs are not used for what they were originally bred for. Most dogs are pets and not used for herding, seraching, hunting etc.. Don't let it get to you, they are trying to give praise to a dog that is seen by the people as a protector of people.|`|iXijnCxOaa	No.. it doesn't bug me.  I try not to let things that clueless people say bug me... its simply not worth the effort or wasted emotion.|`|eDySIDPQaa	No, it does not bother me at all.    GSD are more widely used for Guard Police and Military Training than any other breed, and that is what their commercial focuses on, the public that knows and sees the GSD on dog shows all the time, not as a herder but a working dog for all purposes.....    This does not take away from the GSD, the public just associates them more with the work they are actually being trained to do.    And someone said a Rotti, can kill more, well that is not true and they should not be labled as killers, any breed dog can kill you if they hit the right place, like the throat or an artery.......so offense, but these kind of remarks is what gives breeds a bad rep, and we have enough of that already....|`|KjEbYCuDaa	It's a commercial, they are dealing with public perception not necessarily fact.

Asi 1acuario requerira un cuidado semanal (aparte de las comidas), 1perro requerira 1vigilancia y ADIESTRAMIENTO (aparte de vacunas y alimento), en 1gato en cambio el adiestramiento sera menos importante, y solo sera relevante su vigilancia y los cuidados del veterinario(aparte d vacunas)....

VLlyZKYYaa	yes, they give them drugs which will knock her out most of the night. she will be very groggy and sleep pretty much the whole time. it will take her a few days to get back to normal. i had my dog neutered and didn't really feel bad about it, but i was very concerned. i was surprised at how quickly he wanted to play and was jumping around again. the day after the surgery i had to take away most of his toys because he was playing a bit rough with them. 2 days after the surgery he wanted me to throw his tennis ball for him. i held him back a lot because i was worried about him hurting himself or ripping out the stitches.|`|JsBb732Maa	They should let her out to potty and also should go back and check on her tonight.Call them to check on her, they will give that information to you over the phone.|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	Why is she staying over night?

I know how you feel as I became a bag of nerves while my dog was in there. In a couple of days she was completely back to normal.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	I'm sure she'll be sleeping some of the time.    She'll be let out to potty before the procedure, I'm sure.    The cage won't be little, it'll be big enough for her to stretch out.    Also, if they use gas anesthesia, she'll wake up sooner. It's definitely safer.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	They will let her out to go to the bathroom and they will take good care of her. She will be so drugged up she wont notice she is in a cage and will most likely still be a little loopy when she gets home. Its a routine surgery, nothing to worry about :)|`|JRqzkUxUaa	My vet always keeps the females overnight as well. I guess it is just for observation, since it is surgery after all.    She will be fine and will probably sleep most of the time. Like another poster said, she will probably be a bit sleepy/groggy the following day as well, but rest assured, she is fine and looked after and her needs attended to. :)|`|yjNoIzGBaa	why is she staying the night  are they open 24 hours?   is someone going to be there?  normally we send home same day unless she was done late in the day   really if there is not going to be someone there you need to go get her  some vets will say " oh i think she should stay since she is still sedated and or i think it would be better if she was confined"  however if this is a reputable hospital they should have used propoflo which is an injectable anesthetic that they give prior to maintaining on gas and is excreted very very quickly   so if she is still sedated then ask why and what inducing agent they used   normal agents include telazol, Ket/Val and propoflo  propoflo is the best   if they used the other two then yes it is possible that if they did her late she could still be sedated  but you know what it doesnt matter   you can carry her right?     either way go get her if they are not open 24 hours    as far as walking every vet and staff does this their own way  it really comes down to if they have time and enough staff  most hospitals have assistants/cleaning staff that will take care of the walks  usually they are let out as soon as they are able to stand   they usually will not take out in the morning but will express her bladder under sedation     bottom line   go get her tonight  insist on this   there is no reason that she should stay where she is all by herself   what if she bled out in the middle of the night or becomes painful     upon pickup make sure you have pain medication  rimadyl or deramaxx or metacam  any of these   she will be a bit out of it and will have goopy glossy eyes   she may or may not want to eat  ok to skip dinner but needs to eat in the morning after  give pain meds as directed    GO GET YOUR BABY GIRL|`|dTo0A4xNaa	on the bright side the vet's will take very care of the dog and you won't have to worry about having little puppy's without homes.|`|WJs0Yh00aa	Not sure why shes staying over night. my puppy just got spayed 2 weeks ago and i took her in a 9am had her back at 6pm. I was  very scared because she went back to the pound i got her from to get it done.She was very loopy and drowsy . But when they tell you no excess jumping or playing. I hope you don't have a  very active breed of dog. Its hard to make them settle down.And putting a cone around there neck is funny looking

c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	Pit bulls often have very one-track minds, so it can difficult. If he or she jumps on people, the first response should be to not give him or her ANY attention when he or she does this. It also really helps if you or the person being jumped on turns your back to the dog, since he or she really wants to get your attention. For the barking, get a friend or family member to help. Have some treats ready inyour hand or pocket and get the other person to ring the bell. Reward your dog when he or she doesn't bark, even if it's just for a second.|`|6wSmZrrsaa	You could throw it against the wall, then pull the mini blinds off the window and beat it with them. Then when she hears the door bell she wont bark|`|UyAGXNCsaa	Instruct your friends & family to completely ignore the dog when they first walk in the door.  No touch, talk, see, until she's calm.  Have a training line (10' nylon rope with no handle) and training collar on the dog first, and when the dog jumps up, give him a stern correction and say "off."  Our pit mix did this for months and we would have a friend or neighbor come over to help us train her.  If she jumps on us, we knee her in the chest and say "off."  We also wouldn't pay any attention to her until she was in a calm, submissive state.  She got it and doesn't do it anymore.  The barking is another problem, but again with the line on, you can give your dog a correction and say "quiet" in a firm tone.  It worked wonders for us.  Takes diligence and consistency though!|`|TlKtREYgaa	OMG im having the same problem!!! okay i was watching cesar millan the other day and he said when people walk in the door have them turn their backs and not pay any attention to them...i dont know about the barking|`|OE4UYtWgaa	Simple. Teach them sit, stay, or down, stay. Once they got that down you start to add distractions so they'll listen to you no matter what. Then it's time to test them by performing mock doorbell greetings.    These other answers are crap. I have 2 APBT, and two AmStaffs and they all know how to act when company arrives. Pit bulls are more than willing to listen and obey as long as they know what you want.
SytfXV6Haa	Cats can suffer from second-hand smoke just like humans can. Not only would the smoke have an effect on your cat's lungs, but the toxins from the smoke can settle on your cat's fur and then get ingested when it grooms itself. Intestinal lymphoma and cancer are two of the common diseases cats can contract when living with an owner that smokes. You should bring yoru cat in to see the vet also to be sure that it isn't a condition it may have had prior to being brought home to your house. If that is the case, then you smoking could be an added on trigger.|`|LydL7EN6aa	if its just been getting louder and it is cold out... plus the smoke... is her nose snotty? might be an upper respritory infection. if your really worried take her to the vet   
a8wrGXQAaa	I, personally, do not think you should have to take any of the blame. That would be like if a person  were to ask "My neighbor comes into my house and eats my food because I leave the door unlocked. What do I do?" It's your neighbor's cat, therefor, they should have to do something about it.|`|ucFH0Ku9aa	Your neighbor sounds like a true redneck through and through.  Cat's should be kept indoors, or confined to a safe outdoor area.  People who let their cats roam around town are simpletons.  First of all, I see at leaset 1 cat every few weeks smashed and in the center of the road, secondly, it is not fair to the neighbors who keep their lawns up to have someone elses cat peeing and crapping all over the place.  I had a similar problem with my redneck neighbors.  They let their cat out all the time-  one day I left my windo open in my car and their cat jumped in and sprayed.  I literally had to sell the car as the stench never really came out.  Not only that, it would kill birds on my frontlawn, and one time got stuck in my tree.  Set a trap for their cat- when it comes into your home|`|HKuQuE4Yaa	It's not your fault.  If your neighbor won't take responsibility for their cat you could help the cat to run away.  Take it for a ride in the car and drop it off blocks away, or take it into the woods to be coyote food.|`|4tynRVpzaa	Just pee on the cat, that'll teach him!|`|ZDjBMsVUaa	why would it be your fault. its your house and there cat, you do the math.|`|P0daCB83aa	Absolutely not! You can call animal control and they can collect the cat. Once the cat steps off the owner's property the person who works with animal control can take him in.|`|nle1v4Yqaa	Go and call the police, you have the right its the law but first just say to your neighbor that if it happens again you call the police...|`|LF0nwE0eaa	well....I would like to say NO...it's ur neighbors responsibility to keep their cat away, but also...u might want to put something up against it or get a lock for it or get the kind where only ur dog can go through it, because u might find something else creeping into ur house that dont belong to the neighbor...good luck|`|SDuqhvr1aa	no it's not your cat  tell them about it  so they can stop the pee|`|VMY7No0eaa	There are doors that only let an animal in if it has a special colllar.  I would invest in that.    Cats are independant creatures and the woman was wrong leaving the cat behind.  fix it so the cat can't come into your house ...  talk to the neighbor (nicely)|`|TsFG4zLmaa	no, but it is your responsibility to bring your dog to their house to take a nice big **** on their rug|`|LydL7EN6aa	yeah i would say its your responsibility... i would inform your neighbor though... do you feed the cat or anything? wheres your dog when the cat comes in? thats kind of not fair that you have to pay attention to the stupid cat just because you have a doggy door though.. i would definitly confront the neighbor....|`|T6nmD3X9aa	return the cat, tell your neighbor to keep it in the house.   I hate when people let their cats run all over the neighborhood. They tear up the garbage bags on trashday, they are noisy and annoying when in heat, and make tons of kittens to continue this madness forever.   Tell your neighbor you are taking it to the humane society next time it comes into your house...or give it away on craigslist. Some people really like cats and take care of the properly.    good luck|`|U1pYIbHOaa	Yes it is, the cat doesn't know its wrong and its your job to shut, lock or do whatever to the door.    I would talk to your neighbors about the problem or get rid of the dog door.|`|9gMQAWBNaa	Yup, if you leave the way open so the cat can come in, then it could be a raccoon or skunk next.

FewhKlx9aa	Management is aimed at improving the digestion of foods so that, nutritionally, the dog will not be severely compromised. Commercially prepared enzymes are available to replace or supplement what the pancreas is not producing. Pancreazyme and Viokase are the two most commonly prescribed enzyme formulations. Either one can be used. Basically, these supplements contain the enzymes needed for digestion. The enzyme supplement is mixed with the food prior to feeding. In addition to providing enzyme supplementation, it is beneficial to feed specially prepared diets, which are formulated for ease of digestion. The prescription diet i/d by Hill's is one such diet. From the authors' experience, it is important to discuss the costs associated with management with each owner. Enzyme supplements and prescription diets are costly and will need to be fed for the life of the animal. It is also possible the dog will be controlled with treatment, but may never return to perfect health. Symptoms to some degree may persist even with proper management.|`|3giaPYe8aa	You may want to speak to the Vet about putting her on a prescription dog food for this problem.|`|9MjaiYj4aa	Does she need a certain kind of dog food or do you want her to have a certain kind.    Please add more detail.|`|p7swtBYzaa	You don't need "opinions", you need to speak to the vet who treats this dog because every dog is different.  Feed what the vet recommends.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	A raw diet is best for this situation especially.   However if you are not willing or able to feed a raw diet, feeding raw pigs or cattle pancreas will help.   Also you may be able to find supplements at your local pet care store that contain protease, amylase and lipase, which are the enzymes normally secreted by the pancreas.    Add:   I agree with Kate C. Although vets are good with overall health, I would NEVER take nutritional advice from one unless he/she was educated in dog nutrition.  Speaking with an actual nutritionist would be a great idea.|`|26PPwzrWaa	I would contact a dog nutritionist.     Here is one I know of:   www.dogfoodguru.com  She feeds her own dog raw, but also does feeding trails to see what her mastiff does well on so she can recommend it will knowing it was successful.     I agree with the raw diet, but I also think to switch a sick dog without help could end up bad.|`|Oxdkporsaa	Treatment of pancreatic insufficiency is usually required for the life of the pet. A special diet which is low in both fats and fibre will help in this condition. The diet should be very easily digested. Hills i/d is a very good food for dogs with pancreatic insufficiency. In many dogs however, a special diet may not be strictly necessary and they do well if the pancreatic enzymes they are lacking are replaced. This is done by feeding them the enzymes which are given at the same time as their food. Tryplase capsules are often used for this purpose. They contain amylase, lipase and protease enzymes to help break down the food within the gut. The dose required must be individually tailored to the pet so that normal faeces are produced. The dose will vary according to how much food your pet eats; approximately 1 capsule is required to digest the protein, fat and starch in 100g of normal dog food. Dogs will need between 2 to 5 capsules per day and if the pet is fed twice daily then the dose should be split between the feeds. Pancrex-vet powder is another product which is often used as the name suggests it comes in a powder form rather than as capsules but other than that it is much the same. These products are usually safe and effective but an upset stomach may result from an overdose. Your vet may also recommend that your dog is given injections of vitamin B12 which is not absorbed well if your dog has pancreatic insufficiency. Vitamin E is also sometimes supplemented and antibiotics may be necessary if there is a bacterial overgrowth in the gut as a result of this disorder.|`|d2191893763b20a6b077367a131978aaaa	There is a very good yahoo group:  dog pancreatitis    check it out
fd730c6401ce7ea65a2650f3d3bf74faaa	ball pythons are noctournal so they don't come out much during the day...mine never come out and "sun"  they go to the warm side under the heat lamp or to the cool side of the tank as they want to.  also it will be very rare for your snakes body to feel warm to you when you touch it because our body temp is 98.6  ball pythons bodies get as warm as their sourroundings.  since a bp's tank shouldn't be any hotter than the upper 80's (no hotter than about 90 or 91) the snake will feel cold to the touch when you first get your snake out of his/her tank.  here is how i have my bp's tank set up:  first of all a digital probe thermometer is a must to make sure the temperature is accurate.  use a basking spot lamp (it's by zoo med). put that on one side which keeps the vivarium around 85 - 90 F during the day and dont put any kind of heating on the cool side of the tank...room temp is fine for that. leave the heat lamp on for 10  12 hours a day. also at night just turn off the day lamp and the temp should drop around 70 - 75 at night. if the tank does drop lower than 70 at night you can use a 40 watt red light at night but the tank really should go down to about 75 or so at night.  put hides on both sides and leave their water on the cool side or kind of in the middle. use a substrate that can hold humidity like cypress mulch (forest floor) then just mist it several times a day (2 or 3) with a squirt bottle to keep the humidity up. the humidity should be around 60% when you mist it.|`|46Mxaw13aa	ok ill keep this short and sweet for your benefit.   ok put the lamp over the heat pad and turn the lamp on during the day then switch using the pad at night. keep your half log on this side but try and put another near the water dish so when he wants to cool down he has a cool hide spot too and never put any heat source near the water cuz u don't want your snakes water to get hot. and yea its bad if he's cold or shivering if u set it up this way there will be no problem and ur snake will move wherever he wants to either the warm or cold side depending on how he feels.|`|r8ETcmHMaa	The setup is something that only you can tell if its right. People have different opinion on what side the uth should be on but in the end everyone snake lives a very long life. Just make sure that the hot side in the high 80's and the cool side in the high 70's. Also the humidity around 50 percent. As long as the temp and humidity right then it doesn't matter what side anything on. Good luck.|`|FS1YSsBRaa	I live in Wisconsin and we have both heat sources on one end and the cool end with water at the other end. Ball Pythons come out at night. I had a branch in one cage with red heat at night. At late night the snake would come out and climb the branch and bask under the heat. The cage also had an under tank heat mat. Just room for thought.    Dave|`|hGp8XtVKaa	buy a second light for your snake a night it will be red and keep it on at night.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	Place a hide on each end of the tank and your water bowl in the center. With (2) hides, your snake can choose which part of the tank he wishes to hang out in, the hot side or the cool side.  A heat source should be available at night too especially if the room where your snake is set up is cold. The nite temperature on the cool side should be in the low 80's to upper 70's. Provide a night time basking spot at 86 degrees. You will need (2) thermometers, one for each side. These will give you a clue on how to set up your heat sources to achieve the right temperatures for your ball python. If your heat lamp keeps the cage right for during the day,( a hotspot at 90-92 and a cool end in the mid to low 80's) you won't need to use your heat pad. When you turn the light off at night, you can start up your heat pad. If you do not have a hygrometer, you will need one to measure the humidity level in your ball python's cage.

If she's looking for a purebred tell her to google the breed's parent club in the us.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Stay far far away|`|Bw18seFqaa	this is a puppy mill or broker.. this is NOT a reputable source to get a puppy from.

They also charge to refer you to people like vets and groomers..  $125 to have them tell you what vet they think is a good one.. and another $125 to get a reccomendation for a groomer!   Reputable breeders will refer for FREE!  A reputable breeder will also help you decide if their breed is right for you or not.. FOR FREE!

NEVER, EVER get a dog over the internet.  Unless you've seen it with your own two eyes (not on the internet, because photos can be altered or modified), unless you've seen the kennels firsthand, never buy a dog from a person.    It could also be a scam.  The internet makes it easy for con-men to steal money.  They may not even breed dogs!  They may have just collected a bunch of pictures, and assembled their own website, taking "customers" money without even giving them a dog!|`|3IApfZopaa	Looks like a puppy broker to me, your sister needs to make a home visit, there is no contact info just the email.|`|WKF1DqAAaa	After extensive research, I bought a Rottweiler pup (my second one) from BreedersDirect.com  They're not a puppy mill but rather a broker. Just like how yacht or boat brokers work, they have a huge list of approved breeders in they're network. When I questioned their validity, I was told that they visit the breeder who as applied to be a part of the network. Breeders they will not accept in the network are puppy mills or kennel bred animals. The accepted breeders are home breeders who interact with the animals on a daily basis. And as far as the dogs go, they start socializing them immediately...taking care not to jeopardizing the health of the animal.   All dogs are shipped at 8 weeks, shots, vaccines are up to date and the sires and bitches (parent dogs) are AKC registered...full breed. AKC paperwork is sent with the dog guaranteeing your dog is AKC registrable. I registered mine online in a matter of 10 min. A lot of people say "full breed" but they aren't.  I recommend calling them and discussing what your looking for. They also interview the prospective owners to ensure the animal is going to a worthy owner. they will not sell to everyone.  Any how, I don't want to make this too long, so if you want some more from me, feel free to email me.    Check out my personal page...good info and pictures of my pal!    http://www.squidoo.com/Rottweilers-1    Regards, and good luck!
C1eHfhrHaa	You have to supervise her.  I assume she doesn't do it while you are right there?

Your dog is bored.  Has no outlet for the energy and therefore is exhibiting destructive behavior.      If you are not up to it, hire a trainer and a dog walker.  Or re-home the dog to someone who is aware of the breeds needs.    This is not the dog's fault.|`|3zv2bbolaa	Training >  Exercise > Confinement when supervision isn't possible > plenty of appropriate chew toys      Hitting a dog with a news paper isn't training.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	Exercise and using the crate when you cannot keep a watchful eye on her.   Also, purchase more chew toys it may help if you haven't already|`|AoSeHXeQaa	She sounds bored.  She probably needs more exercise, and something she is allowed to chew on.  I always make sure my dogs have plenty of toys and rawhides to chew, so they leave my stuff alone.

TJGje2blaa	Your local S.P.C.A is your best bet.  They will make sure the pets are treated & givened their shots & things, & will then put them up for Adoption.  People who pays for their pets will generally take better care of them, too.   This will give you a sense of well-being, knowing that they will get good treatment & good, responsible pet owners.   I had a 4 lb , 8-year old little poodle givened to me, a few months ago, & I allow the previous owner to call just as much as she wants to, & to even visit, if she ever decides that she can stand to do this.  She calls often, too.  I got her, thru a friend of this previous owner, also.  So, you can also check around with your friends & the Vet & see if they can suggest anyone.  Believe me, they won't suggest anyone unless they know, within their own hearts, that the pets would be well takened care of, in a good home.  Lots of luck to you.|`|BNkQA2pFaa	You didn't say if maybe you had a family member or friend who could maybe take them in for a while until you get things worked out. I know this has to be extremely hard for you. If you don't have someone to foster them for a while and you do have to completely give them up then make sure you or someone you trust screens them very good. As far as your money situation, research and see what kind of programs are available to help you out in this time of need. There are programs that some churches have like food banks that will help you in that manner. But as far as our government, it may take some effort on your part but it will be worth it in the long run. One thing you don't need to do is let pride get in the way. Sometimes we don't want others to know we have to have assistance because of our pride but the assistance is there for people who need it. God bless you.

They are different from state to state, so if you can't locate them, ask at the local shelter for a non-profit that will help place your dogs.     Good luck - I hope your health continues to get better.|`|1bRRODd2aa	Talk to your local SPCA now before the situation becomes critical.  They will help you to re-home your dog.  If you are worried that they might not be adopted, then you could give them to a no-kill shelter.|`|9MjaiYj4aa	Oh one do not give them to a shelter because they put them to sleep because they do that hand thing when their eating and other test and the dogs are scared i've had to give tow dogs to the shelter and that's what happened and I would put signs up any where and ask if anybody wants them|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Ouch ... sorry to hear about your troubles.      Start calling around for breed rescues if they are pure preds, and even if they're mixed, if they apparently have one breed or another in them call the breed rescues for what they're mixed with.  Rescues tend to have soft spots for people who have cared for their dogs but have things like this happen.  Hopefully, they'll be able to either find foster homes or forever homes for your animals.    I hope things work out well for you and your animals.
43fe22f7b04157dae7a820c7007497b3aa	You have to imagine just how much it costs, not to mention the stress on the animal. You do not 'need' him. You want him. There is a huge difference between the two. Food, for instance, is a need. Pitching a hissy fit to get a pet shipped around the world to you is a want. It's a very selfish want, too.    You are 13. Your life will not end if you do not get the 1 horse you want. You'd be better off trying to convince your parents to let you have a pet you can find in your area. If your dad says 1 year, then wait a year.|`|e49180ed7f3e7b1742ab281bbccc8d17aa	Wait a year.  In the mean time, visit local stables and get to know horses that are for sale.  They all need a good home.|`|AA10276729	Well you could outline the pros of it to your parents, but also outline the cons and tell them how you can solve them. Make it worth it to them too.   If it just can't happen though then you need to realize that it just can't happen. For example you have to think about the cost of food, water, vetranarian care, land, ect.... And to where as you are thirteen years old, I doubt you have a job that can help support this horse.   And if you live in a big city then where are you gonna keep him? Miles away where you would have to get a ride everyday to go take care of him?   Plus I don't know who would ship a horse half way around the world. While it was being shipped it would have to be taken care of. This would make it very expensive. It's not like in the movies where they through it in a crate and send it off. It would take weeks to get to you and therefore would need food, water, and other needs on the trip. Plus when it gets there if you don't have land you have to find someone who does and will let you use their land or somewhere to keep him.   A horse is a big animal and requires a bit of money to maintain. Unless your moms a vet and your dad grows hay on a farm with lots of land.   Sorry to rant and rave, but I think that you should put a bit more thought into this and check into the costs of this. First off I would find someone to transport him and see what it would cost. I would then see about storage and cost. followed by what it would cost to feed him everyday.  I think you would have better luck buying a horse here, even though it's not the horse you fell in love with.   I would think that your dad said in a year hoping you'd forget.   Well good luck getting your horse I hope I helped. Hopefully your parents can help you figure out how to get him. Good luck.|`|4ce8efb0d42dafc1cef427b4d231c3b3aa	You seriously need to reconsider it. Hate to say it, but it isn't going to happen.   Find another horse to fall in love with, or move on.  Time to learn you will not get everything in life.|`|56a92187f5888f8fc08adddf8e7f8540aa	I know how you feel. I have also been trying to convince my parents to buy me a horse and its really horrible when they say no but we can't always get what we want esp when money is involved and looking after horses is very expensive. Why don't you try saving up 2 help.|`|7fa04e30379ac33addf8d2ff7c80ac6baa	stop being so god damn greedy. You would probably kill the horse because you would not be a good owner anyway. Listen to yourself, your like "im going through a really hard time because i cant get a horse". some people dont have houses, and your like about to kill yourself because you cant have an animal that you wouldnt be able to take care of anyway. I hate people like you|`|86605a9c1f9c4c600b93906cd86bb5ffaa	Hi I grew up with horses i love them probably couldn't go a day with out my horses. The first thing you have to know is do you have room for a horse? A horse needs about 2 ares and shelter, they eat feed everyday and hay, do you have a place to keep the hay and feed? for one horse its about half a bale depends on the horse though. If you have all this then you need to show your dad and grandad that you are reasonable enough to take care of a horse they need attention everyday. and rode a least once a week, and remember if your in a place that snows your going to have to take care of that horse in the winter. You will have to clean his stall at least every 2 weeks. that's even in the winter, have to lay fresh hay every 2 weeks. for bedding. after you show your dad that you can be reasonable come to a Agreement ask him and your grandad if you can come help him out to show that you can take care of the horse. Then wait little longer then pop the question about bring him home.
640016b0563fa6a6ad8192741d2df0feaa	My dog does the basics, plus I've taught him to touch (I used to be a huge fan of The Pet Department on FX).  basically you just hold an object out and train you're dog to put his nose on it.      Crawling is also a neat trick to watch (easy to teach a dog to do if you use a chair to have him crawl under at first).    But hands down everyone is most impressed with the No! trick.  Teach the dog not to take a treat you have sat down when you say a command to him ( I just say no and the dog's name, but my aunt says "Mama said no", but whatever you want to use).  Wait a little bit and they tell him it's okay for him to have it.  Everyone seems so impressed that the dogs are so well behaved that they don't take the treat until you give them permission, but they are actually just well trained.     My husband taught his dog to keep his mouth shut while he put a treat on his muzzle. Then the dog waits for the okay to snap it off his nose and catch it in his mouth.  Neat to watch, but my dog was never able to do it.|`|a166340c5433a66363b18206708b8532aa	Aw, that's sweet.

You might have forgotten the hinny, which is a cross between a female donkey and a male horse.    Both the mule and hinny are sterile, they cannot reproduce.    The female donkey is called a jennet, the male donkey is called a jackass.    The female mule is called a molly mule and the male mule is called a john mule.|`|86e5af1e3ecd8e843ceaec78bb2640ffaa	one of them cannot reproduce offspring.  2 of them are the same just different name.|`|b40e924a880ac67e501a0d36e5d01049aa	A mule is a cross between a horse and a donkey.

643a794b0bd8e55e6c35130a27cc89ebaa	I have the same issue with my rescue dog.  She actually was a street dog with very little human or dog interaction.  I have had her for 2 years now, and she has just started playing with toys in the last 2 months.  For both issues, I continually brought her to a dog park.  For a while, she just would stick with me, but slowly, she began to venture out.  Play, for dogs, is instinctual.  She may have had that removed by her prior living conditions.  It will take time to open back up.  If she is very recently brought home, she may be adjusting still, and you are her security blanket.  Either way, as long as she is happy, don't pressure her.  She'll be fine.|`|3269a1df1d5de793f0e0f40493501706aa	She is doing very well from what you have told us.   She is coming around, it just takes time.

Spending time with the dog by itself will help it see that you love her and that you care for her, too. BEing the necomer in an already established pack makes it difficult, as she has to find her place. She already knows that you are the alpha -- hence her sticking to you like glue -- but doesn't seem ready to find her place, so she sticks by you because she knows she will not be picked on when she's by her side. After playing with her alone, introduce another dog into your play, and once they interact well, add your other dog. Don't be concerned if they seem to act rough, as long as they are not fighting. Play biting is okay, it's how she will learn her place.|`|86e5af1e3ecd8e843ceaec78bb2640ffaa	time is what it is going to take. she is insecure. build her confidence level up. enroll in classes, not only will she learn  from the class but also conditions her around different dogs,people and environments. since shes already 3 years old,  patience from you all her life is what shes going to need. the more places you take her, the better conditioned she'll become. good uck to the both of you.|`|d00bc047d5b2cbd7a719a3772346f4e6aa	Time and patience will bring her around eventually.  You are already doing the right things to encourage her play time and seeing you other dogs participate is showing her what it's all about.    On another note, some dogs lose the interest in playing and never seem to get it back.  When my American Eskimo Dog reached the age of 3 or 4 and had settled down after the puppy phase, she didn't really like to play fetch any more.  Still loved her walks, but not much for playing.|`|9c2b353f266a17e883b3fb5f5fcdc823aa	if she was abused it might take awhile for her to  become unstuck to you  but work with her and play with her and the toys and she should catch on, it just might take time.|`|19c3d886cebf9e14f6703e1dc6d5d411aa	you are a wonderful human being.

Tc23KWgzaa	He could have a bladder infection.  That makes them have to pee urgently.  Certainly would not be able to wait until you get home.    This dog is obviously very intelligent, and he does NOT want to stay behind in the house while you are out doing something else.  He wants to be with you all the time.    IF he doesn't have an infection, I would get a crate.  Before you leave, put a nice blanket in the crate, a few toys and a chewy.  Then lock the dog in the crate.  He may not like it, but he won't be peeing all over your house and chewing on stuff.    IF this is not a medical problem, it's all about teaching him the proper behavior.  With such an intelligent dog, it shouldn't be very hard.  PetsMart has great classes.    TX Mom|`|FewhKlx9aa	Neutering would stop this and also he's mad,seems like your his only friend.He is having some seperation anxiety,but really if he is'nt fixed this will happen|`|K97esxDsaa	Many dogs become afraid or anxious when their owners are away, or they may just be bored.    Every time you see that your dog has peed in a bad place, take him outside immediately and give him a treat if he pees outdoors.    You might also try crate training for your dog. Many people don't like the thought of putting a dog in a cage, but dogs like small, secure places, and will be less likely to pee in a place they see as their den or bed.    http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pe...    http://www.cratetraining.net/|`|KxjUim7yaa	Answer is yes. He should have a crate to go into when you are not home. Use Nature's Miracle on the spots to discourage him remarking. Or some other neutralizing brand.
kWwgWSSgaa	I would call it a potentially very dangerous stunt on very steep steps.     Would the owner have been able to break the Dobe's fall?

GSf09ALBaa	I love this question.  I cannot answer it because I don't live in Australia and I honestly have never thought there was a need for foster homes for rats.      If it works the way dog fostering does, the foster home pays for the food and the rescue usually supplies the heartworm and flea preventive.      Very interesting question.  Lucky bunch of rats out there.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	I have fostered dogs for two different organizations, and each is different - it just depends on who you are fostering for.  You will need to ask the organization you are working with.  (my daughter used to have rats, they are pretty cool :o))

Just make sure to change the bedding every week and you can even buy some stuff at the pet store which will help cover up the smell.|`|eTsCJYALaa	If you clean the cage every day it would prevent the smell. Otherwise your room will start to smell like a barn. We tried to keep the bunny cage in my daughter's room and this is what occured.|`|nPuZVGFRaa	Only if you don't clean the cage every week.|`|SytfXV6Haa	Rabbits do carry their own odor to them, just like any animal does. The strength of the odor however depends on if you regularly groom them or not. Also, the particular "smell" I think you may be referring to is usually caused by cage maintenance. Bacteria and other messes can grow in a bunny's cage if it's not properly maintained. The litter box should be changed daily, water and food bowls should be cleaned often and the cage itself ought to receive a good scrubbing once a month also. Other factors may include the hay, the temperature and the types of food that you offer to the rabbit. I would suggest doing your research about rabbit care and needs before you bring a rabbit home. You could also find a rabbit forum and ask what types of things they do to keep the smell down to a minimum. If you're not willing to maintain the cage regularly then it's going to smell.|`|Oti6JXJIaa	the bunny its self doesnt smell at all, but since you are suppose to clean its cage every 7 day(every week), it starts to get aliottle stinky on like day 6 but its not really a big stinky.|`|5I7MZjHuaa	No. If properly cared for, they do not smell.     http://www.rabbit.org/ is a fantastic website for rabbit care. I reccomend reading through it before aquiring a rabbit, so you know what to expect.|`|4SQx8smEaa	If you do not clean their cage and they do not have the proper cage (which would be one with a grate that separates them from the bedding) of course they smell. But if you keep their cage cleaned and have the right cage, with good ventilation them no they do not smell.
kGwMj5kcaa	I have a two foot ball Python and we never feed her when she's shedding. When they are shedding their eyes are covered by the skin that is coming off. So they can't see what's in the cage and the rat could hurt your snake if it don't eat it. (then you have problems) Oh and snakes can go for a while without eating (especially when they get big).|`|ZSWmOkE6aa	Yes. my corn snake always eats during shed. you should always try to feed any snake during shed but if they refuse then its fine.|`|BrNfFo73aa	Yes it is he would starve i have a snake too well its my moms its a family pet she always feeds it when it sheds hope i could help sorry if i didn't by|`|hGp8XtVKaa	i would but don't play with him and if it's alive no don't only frosen|`|vwEnKqZ6aa	Omg. I'm shocked at the ignorance of people. Don't listen to the others. I hav kept many snakes for years now. U should NOT feed ur snake while its in shed. Snakes can go months without eating so it won't die like the other people said it would. When snakes shed they like to b left alone. Even if they're being fed. As soon as he is done shedding u can feed him. Hope this helps.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	Wait till he is done shedding and then feed him.|`|4TDNdRLcaa	yes it is if you don't it would die just sit it down in he well get to it|`|78im4WUcaa	If your snake will eat during shed. Go for it. There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING wrong feeding a snake during shed.     Most snakes however will refuse food during this time for obvious reason.Stress, poor visibility, etc. However, I would not recommend feeding live prey during this time.    The reasoning behind the "dont feed during shed" is essentially trying to A)Save money/not wasting a mouse B)Allows the snake not to be handled during shed, which can be stressful on the animal C)Allows the feeding schedule time to be varied a bit, which some breeders/owners recommend.    I have several snakes, some which will eat during shed, the majority will not. Of those that will eat during shed I usually dont feed them during shed, but have on rare occasions.    The question you asked "is it alright to feed him" and the answer is "yes"

0b6691be66651a8e0f44ae92e9fce0a2aa	Hi there...also consider placing an ad on N. NJ Craigslist: http://newjersey.craigslist.org/pet/  Be sure to ask for a small adoption to disuade people from looking for a free pet to sell to research labs, use for dog fight training or worse mistreatment.  Ask prospective families if they object to a monthly inspection for several months to ensure the dog is going to go to a good home.      List of NJ no-kill shelters (scroll down to NJ): http://animalliberationfront.com/AR_Orgs...|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	I believe most rescue shelters are no kill shelters.  Before taking the dog to a specific shelter, give them a call and ask them if they are a non-euthanizing shelter.|`|AA10994071	I would start with Oakland NJ, Try Teteboro. Also look for Rescue groups. None of these are free, they are taking over her responsibility.  I am looking to adopt a dog as my daughter took Tatsi, basset Hound when she moved out. E-mail me, I'm in North Jersey.  what type of dog  why giving it away  spayed?  housebroken?  bites, barks excessively?  how big is he/she and what will it be if not full grown?  Maybe we'd be a match.|`|AA10072754	I was watching this special on HBO....it turns out unless the dog is placed in a breed specific rescue or regular shelter.....it is most likely to go crazy (spinning and fence fighting) due to lack of interaction.  Some no kill shelters have been caught locking dogs up in cages and never letting them out.  Actually some no kill shelters have closed because of their animal abuse so if you really want to go with a no kill shelter, check it out first.  Go see what its like.  If the dogs are spinning or fence fighting or jumping up on the fence.....think again.    Also more people tend to want to SAVE a life and adopt from a regular shelter.  Dogs they feel will be adopted will get their expiration extended anyway.    Why don't you take the dog?    Anyways when it comes to putting a dog in the shelter...see how to adopt one.  Do they require a long survey?  Do they require a lot?  Do you feel it is almost impossible to adopt one from there?  THEN GREAT!  Go with that shelter.
78BfHGY5aa	Hi Ashley,    Your dog room sounds great! People have made a few good suggestions, so I wont go repeating myself... but I will say a couple of things about the crate:    My Dobe has quite a large crate (thus making it not so easy to move around as it is heavy, but is still transportable) and he loves it. It is "his" doggy home, and he chooses to go lie down there when he needs rest or time out or just to sit and watch the household world. To lock a dog in a crate for extended periods is not nice, but for short term training, or sleeping, or simply somewhere safe while you cannot supervise, they are a handy tool. Dogs like to feel safe, and, often the smaller the space, the safer they feel. And, the added benefit is that on the rare occasion he has to sleep at mum's house, or the kennel or whatever, I take the crate and he knows it is his, it is "home" and he is safe.     He always sleeps in the crate at night, and if I fail to pop him in there, I have an axious, squeaky puppy indeed.     What a lucky dog you are adopting!|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	Yes, I dont agree with crating (but that is just my opinion) that is what I do with my dogs, and they have access to the back yard. But yes, and congratulations on the adoption.|`|f3f09dd5dab69f7e644b37c4cf98a3abaa	I want you to think of a different situation because while your 'room' sounds ok - there could be another situation.    Lets say that you and muffie want to go on a trip - a vacation.  You check into a hotel and are going to go to dinner - or a movie with friends - you can't leave the dog in the car - can't leave the dog unattended and loose in the room.  Crate training has many uses and I would suggest that you do it - for the benefit of unintended circumstances that may require the dog to be crated - if only for a while.  Otherwise you will find that somethings you will no longer be able to do.     A crate is not punishment - it is a safe secure area for the dog - you will be providing a dog some stability.  If you are adopting - you don't know about the destructiveness of the dog and quite honestly the first few weeks are idea to do the crate training - later on - think about a dog room but not at first.|`|IzRk1mZQaa	I have two dogs that live in my laundry room when I am at work.  I like it much better than a crate, plenty of room for food and water, and for them to stretch out.  They like it too, when they see me get ready for work, they go lay down in the laundry room!!  I think your dog room sounds great.|`|AA12202402	I am major animal freaky and did this with my dog. It worked. But at the time I also puppy pad trained she. That way she would normally go outside but if I forgot or got caught out late there was a place for her to go|`|FDZNJXxcaa	I have a friend that uses a dog room instead of a crate. The open might annoy neighbors if the dog barks. the newspaper should only be necessary if the dog is still being house trained.   The baby gate works great unless the dog can jump over it.   Also if the dog is going to be in there longer than it can wait to go potty consider a dog walker to walk your dog while you are away to make sure that there is plenty of exercise in your dog's day.  I hope this helps|`|ErvhPYlbaa	That is so cute!    You're totally like me.  I didn't crate my baby at first because I worked all day and thought it was abusive.    About a year later, I got a roommate and took it upon herself to put my baby in a cage ALL day while I was gone.    I was so angry.... but to be honest, it trained her.|`|A21SswSfaa	Do more research into a crate. What if he tries to get out? What if he tears the room apart while you're gone. Dogs will do this! And a gate won't stop them! Also, if the dog is well house trained chances are he won't go potty inside. But if he has to go, he may just go. A dog won't go potty in its crate though.     Look into a crate. Maybe your dog won't need a crate at all. All depends on the dog.

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	12 Gallon is pretty small. All I would recommend would be small shelldwellers like these guys:  http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Neolampro...  They do best as a species tank, these guys only, not a community tank in a tank that small.

You could also try ram coachloads... they are smaller cichlids that display great colors!    http://www.tropicalfishforum.net/photopo...|`|h4wNRqf9aa	you could keep wither a pair of kribensis or blue rams in there, or one of a few different apistogrammas i wouldn't do the bolivian rams as they get too large  there are a few dwarf pike cichlids that would be fine as well, but these are hard to come by and usualy expensive    there are also shell dwelling african cichlids that would do fine in there    pretty much every other cichlid would get too large  CERTAINLY any cichlid like a convict ot jack dempsey is out of the question|`|JnXmSLDfaa	You can of course, but probably the fry won't make it, they'll get eaten.  The smallest tank we used was a 20 gallon and we couldn't get the fry to survive in that either.  We had a couple of 75/ 65 gallon tanks or there about and had rosy as well as convicts and they over bred actually.  I took some of the smaller ones to the fish store and traded them for fish foods.  I was fascinated with our  Africans but it was constant effort to try to duplicate Mother Nature and what it takes to sustain life in an artificial environment like an aquarium.|`|CvGhB0Ceaa	It depends on how many.|`|8038b3adc016b548c310b6c4926bb475aa	I'm sure there are many, but I only found this fish for a smaller tank:    Lamprologus multifasciatus  Shell dwellers are perfect for beginners or fish-keepers with space constraints. Give them a 10 gallon tank, enough shells to go around and watch them dig in...literally. All prepared foods are accepted and maintenance is minimal beyond harvesting their offspring.     This is one of the smallest cichlids in Lake Tanganyika. It differs from its "cousin" similus by not having stripes in the head region. Overall its stripes are more wavy. On the up side, it is very prolific. Multi-generation colonies can be maintained in mid-sizes tanks.  (Clip)    http://www.reservestockcichlids.com/prod...
3urpilpBaa	Vet techs are always in demand and a clinic will drop a few assistants just to obtain a tech.  I went to tech school and in my first year I had 4 doctors approach me to come work for them when I was out of school.  Do not expect to make a ton of money though, until you have some experience under your belt or go to specialty training like dental or anesthesia.  Always work for a clinic that will send you to continuing education classes (CE credits are needed to keep your license).  Good luck!|`|K97esxDsaa	Job prospects for vet techs are typically better in rural practices and in research facilities and zoos than in your general small animal practice, but from what I've heard from people in the field, it should be fairly easy to find a job in most parts of the US.

(Michigan)    Even if it's not a legal requirement, it's a VERY good idea and I think that every dog should have and ID tag. |`|uQrIdrjfaa	yes thats common knoledge|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	I have my dog chipped, but I always make sure that he is wearing a tag with our phone number and the street and area that we live in on it (not the full address - no point in letting people know the guard dog is out :-) ).  Tags allow people to return your dog quickly without having to find a place with a chip scanner that is open.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	illegal?   I'd say that's with very good reason. If your dog were to ever get out, the id tag would allow whoever finds her to contact you.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	Yes, by law you need to display your full name, address and contact telephone number on the tag.|`|XHHkBkwOaa	hello people 21st centuary its called     MICROCHIPS LOL    and yes in australia it is against the law to even sell puppies without a microchip you can be fined thousands of dolllars too|`|TJHfkN6gaa	ye is you should get him chipped a tag helps people know your pups name and someone may want to take him a chip would mean if someone did take him he would hopefully find his way back to you|`|kC2Iseh3aa	Yeah, it's always the best idea.  If they're not chipped, it's the best way to get them back if they ever get away.
KxjUim7yaa	Yes. My female Dachshund had retained baby teeth. The vet removed them.|`|FewhKlx9aa	I had one that this happened to and they had to be removed while he was neutered,he never knew it|`|Um8osMNuaa	lf chewing on bones and toys doesn't help them to fall out, then you need to get them removed by the vet, if you are planning on getting you pup neutered then they can be removed at the same time, that way there is no need for your dog to be anaesthetised twice.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	apples|`|aCqSF87Raa	My pup had one - her canine on the bottom. We scheduled to have it pulled during her spay, but she came into heat literally the week before so we waited for a few weeks. The tooth fell out on it's own about a week before her spay.    If your pup has one you should talk to your vet about getting it pulled. It cannot stay as food could get stuck between the teeth and cause problems.
DALXDovmaa	Being a horse owner and trainer for over 35 years I can tell you that , yes horse can have celery. Not all horses will eat it, just like not all horses will eat apples and carrots. I think it is the texture and taste that some horse don't like. And yes you can hand feed them. Horses can be trained just any other animal not to bite. If you let them get away with nipping and biting you looking for treats when you have none it will develop into a bad habit. the trick is, simply ...you just don't let them get away with it. there not stupid.|`|CgGIbExVaa	yes my mother in law has 6 horses . They love all kind of fruit and veggies . We never hand feed them because the vet said it would make them nip or bite you when u pet them and this is true ,so if u plan to feed them celery  i would highly suggest you put it in a bucket or lay it on the ground .|`|2opWeKQBaa	I don't see why they wouldn't.

e24927ac320c44b5277a8072d74a368faa	If you are looking for a coat, there are various places online that sell dog coats. They also have raincoats.    The easiest way to get one is to go to a tack shop and buy a foal blanket. They fit perfectly, since a Dane is about the size of a foal.    Contrary to what some people think, in spite of their size, Danes have very short coats which give them little protection from the cold. Elderly and arthritic Danes really need some warmth. If you want a sweater, you will most likely have to have it custom knit.     My old girl had a bright orange sweater that I knit her for hunting season, since we are out in the country.|`|723c4346aaf773f03bb7ce450acfb93eaa	You could probably put him in people clothes, that's a big doggie! :)    Try smartpakcanine.com.

I chose her, therefore, she is the smartest dog in the room.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Funny. I'm sure she thought the toilet roll was a fair swap. Our dog needs to have his feet treated at night. If he thinks we have for gotten, he barks to remind us. It is part of his evening. While being treated he gets a belly rub and a sweet potato chew after. I'm not shure what part he likes best.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	We've taught our dog a few tricks, sit, lay down, beg, etc. He gets a treat for each one. When he's feeling especially brainy, he'll do them all, in order, on his own..."Just give me the treats!"  His predecessor knew how to open the front door, and escaped quite a few times due to his Houdini act.  Of course dogs are smart. :)|`|pc7ZjexJaa	my dogs are 'smart'    but things are very instinctual with dogs|`|iNfDcN9jaa	Yes!|`|dYuK4JPEaa	Too smart for his own good!

They have never offered me anything but my oldest dog Copper will have something my younger dog (Cash) wants and Cash will go find another toy or stick or something that seems interesting and will get Coppers attention and then take whatever he wants! I totally think dogs are smart!|`|c059nXPfaa	One of our dogs is hella smart.  Here is a true story, that no one ever believes, but I swear on her life it's true.    My sister and I were hanging out with her, giving her treats and just talking to her.  It seemed like she was really understanding us, so as a test we said to her, "Lucy, if you understand us, stand up and put your paws on the counter," and I plopped my hands on the countertop.  In a matter of seconds, she stood up, smacked her front paws down across from me and just looked at me.  It was freaky, but awesome.      She may have understood just from my body language, but it wasn't like I patted the counter trying to get her to get up there.  I just did it once and looked at her, until she copied me.|`|C2U8qR8zaa	Of course dogs are smart..everything they can possibly do makes them smart... =)))|`|JSwM1H4saa	Yes my dogs always out smarts me to getting loose!!!!!|`|7c000cf444eb1024a5936f1c7f912a15aa	I have a yellow Lab who iRetrOo very intelligent. He has learned how to get what he wants among other things. But he loves water as most Labs do, and during the summer satisfying his need to swim is not a problem. However winter and cold temperatures diminishes his water time. So he learned if he finds mud rolls in it he gets a bath. He will actually go out get dirty then ome in B Line past me, upstairs to the bathtub and waits in the tub until I get there.   He also learned how to call me into a room and get what he wants. He has different barks and one he has is usually a trouble bark that brings me running. So from that he learned if he uses that bark I will come running to the room he is in. He also learned by using his eyes he can direct my attention. So he will lay in bed, call me into the room, look me in the eyes and then look at the object he wants, and he will repeat it until I get it.    He also learned how to get people to do what he wants by taking certain objects. I tried him object recognition and people recognition. So if you say go get the TV remote he will, or you say go get your orange ball he will, and for people he will sit at their side and place one paw on their leg. He knows 55 different objects and people. In training him this he has learned what people value and if takes their valuables he can get his favorite game of chase or food. Depending on what he wants depends what he does.    He as any good dog saved my life twice and one time he did something beyond intelligent. I use to bring him to see my 93 old grandpa who lived alone. Tritan, my Lab developed a bond with my grandpa. Oneday Tritan was really anxious to get there and as soon as we got to his house Tritan ran past me and inside. And he began barking, in his panic bark. I came running in to find my grandpa wedged betweem the bathroom wall and counter. His body position was preventing him to breathe easy. So I called 911 and then tried to prop him up but could not keep him up for along. Tritan watched from the side then burst passed me and as I held me grandpa up Tritan got under him and pushed up with his weight. Tritan used his body to hold my grandpa up until emergency personal arrived. It was not a natural behavior or position for him he just somehow knew what to do. But he does mimick human behaviors. Like he does not lick he will try and kiss you like people do by touching his mouth to their cheeks. He will turn lights on when he enters a dark room Granted he was taught that but it is still funny. Some much of his training he learned on his own and that makes him intelligent. He can problem solve without humans help.

They are the most fun dogs ever! They are so smart and guys tend to love them because they are so rowdy. We currently have a pit bull and a pit/heeler mix. They are the sweetest most loyal dogs, and would defend us with they're lifes. They are protective of our house when strangers come in, one more than the other, but they both immediately chill out and become friendly when we tell them its ok. Its like they know when things are fine, and when they really need to protect us. Everyone is scared of them at first and then love them once they realize that its not really this horrible viscous dog they've heard the stories about. They're the best!!
AA12106467	I absolutely do not recommend a veggie diet especially for rabbits that you plan on breeding.  First, you are very likely to give them diahrrea.  Second, you are going to throw off their nutrition big time, especially for the does you are breeding when they are trying to milk and feed their kits.  Most likely after only a week or two you will start feeling the bones over the top of their back when you run your hand over their back.    I've seen rabbits fed that way and they look gaunted and mal-nourished.  In my opinion, I think it is borderline to cruelty.    Rabbits used for breeding should be fed a diet consisting mainly or rabbit pellets.  I recommend a rabbit pellet with 16-17% protein.  At least 16% protein should be used to aid in milking.    If you are trying that kind of diet because you don't have the money to adequately feed your rabbits then I recommend that you consider selling them.|`|0a08343c1eaeb39a7a685d7d1301744caa	Wild rabbits only nurse for a few minutes at night, and moms vanish the rest of the day.

You could call local pet stores, but most probably won't take them.  The big chains definitely won't.  A couple years ago I moved and had to sell some of my fish and barely got anything for them.  I paid over $50 for my Koran Angel and sold it to a pet store for maybe a little over $10.  Your best bet is to post an ad on Craigslist.  From a private party you should be able to get half what a pet store charges.
riCfCxjEaa	Aw, that's too bad for the little guy!  Pups learn so much by being with their mom and litter mates for at least 8wks.  Puppies taken away this early have little or no bite inhibition and are usually not as social as other dogs but these are issues your friend will have to deal with.  I would definitely recommend a good trainer!  As far as tonight, if you can give him a gated area or crate with nice warm bedding and some newspaper to go on, he should be okay.  Play with him a lot before putting him down for the night and let him bark it out when you go to bed.  He will eventually calm down.  Sometimes a soothing radio helps as well.  Have fun and good luck!!|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	6 weeks is very young like you ive had dogs in the past where the breeders would not let go to 10 weeks and once 12 weeks.its just not right and could lead to behavioral problems later on.being as you have the pup only for one night id keep him with you the whole time,he most likely will sleep alot|`|6SeWCfUfaa	You know, in a perfect world, the pup would have been able to stay with it's mother and litter mates longer but ... I will say that with a catahoula it's probably less tragic than if it was a toy breed or something.  Puppies that age like to play and snuggle up in warm places.

AA10072754	If you arent a breeder, I suggest buying a disposable whelping box and having her sleep in it.  This will allow her to be more comfy even after she has the pups since they are easy to look after and cant wander too far.  A good box will have liners around the walls so the mother cannot smash puppies.  Place comfy blankets or towls to keep her warm.  Nice round beds or wicker baskets are sometimes a fav. too.  I also suggest a raised dish since puppies can drown in the bowl.|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	Try going for a slow walk every day, about a half hour.

5PsKGss7aa	Heck yes that  is wrong. he needs a visit from animal control.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	Yes, the dog needs air|`|AA10076207	yes its cruel!! let it get 100 degrees out and lock your neighbor in his car in a  closed garage. i guarentee he'll never do it again. it's even worse if the dog is old. he's even less resistant to the heat/cold than if he were in his prime.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Yes it's cruelty to animals,call the police tonight and let them know whats going on.How does she give it water and food??|`|uQrIdrjfaa	that is terrible if u do that u should be ashamed|`|IzRk1mZQaa	Well, would you leave your grandma in a parked car inside a garage all day?  She's old, too.  I think you should report this to animal control right away - you would be doing the right thing.  Or give me the address, I'll call.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Oh my, everyone is going to have a cow!  My dogs go in a crate when I leave, Is a crate more or less room for the dog than a car?    Now I think it is crazy to leave a dog in a car.  Dog needs access to water if left in the car all day. I would want something to cover my nose when opening the door of that car.     But as far as being in the car, as long as it isn't to hot or cold, it's no different than being locked in the laundry room, bedroom or the kitchen. The car is nothing more than a confined space.    can sure tell that the kiddies are out of school for the day.|`|EJCuRa19aa	Yes that is cruel.  I suppose if it is not too cold or hot you could make a bed/liitle house out in the garage to it to stay...but a car???|`|KVB1xDTwaa	YAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! How would u like to be in there! thats cruel no dog should be locked in a car n' for one thing they could get carbon monoxide poisening from cars comin in and them bein locked in a car.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	That's disgustingly cruel.

Does it have food and water and blankets so it stays warm? Why does he keep it in there anyway? You need to call animal control and report him.|`|rumYVkDsaa	YES IT IS. CALL THE POLICE NEXT TIME.|`|taLD45Sqaa	Um yea.....  this is ageism against dogs.|`|9vhXo9Pkaa	yes thats animal cruelty!  you should tell the ppl 2 stop and if they dont call police who will give them heavy fines and will hopefully make them stop|`|kC2Iseh3aa	Absolutely.

Who gives a crap if the people are old, it's still WRONG!! Just b/c the people are old doesn't mean it affects the animal differently. Heat and lack of water take a toll on the dog no matter how old the owners are.     omg -.-|`|ylCxHCKkaa	That's a no brainer! It's very, VERY cruel! Old or not old, they're DOGS!

Did you really expect someone to say "No, that's fine, I do it all the time"....come on.....make sure he gets caught doing it next time :)
v0RsFaAzaa	That's easy! There is no question about it! I would definitely Adopt!|`|7cvoxQitaa	ADOPT! There are thousands of animals being put to sleep everyday because people want a dog with papers, the papers don't make it a good dog!! Everyone should look at the pound or Humane Society first, before going to a breeder!|`|VhMvfIMKaa	i always look to adopt! i might not always adopt, but i always look. i love helping animals find a home. and congrats on your first puppy!|`|WJs0Yh00aa	I would adopt don't care if its a mix. Pure breeds have more issues, and health risk. I adopted a puppy and I would do it again.|`|JSwM1H4saa	I would rather adopt one from the ASPCA because, a lot of animals are in need to being adopted.|`|OFpl236faa	My family has adopted all 7 of our dogs. We do agility with them all. We do know where 2 of them came from (one a ranch and the other a reputable breeder). The only reason I would go and buy a dog is if I wanted to be on the world team (you have to have papers and 5 or 7 generations on the bloodlines). But for now I'm happy with adopting and there are organizations out there that allow mixed breeds.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	I've paid hundreds for pure breeds in the past, our current dog is a rescue, and it was a wonderful decision. He's had some issues-severe separation anxiety and seizures for example, but as he sits next to me with his head in my lap as I type I can only smile and be glad we found him.|`|K97esxDsaa	I'm still in a toss-up between adopting a shelter dog and buying a pet quality dog or retired adult dog from a reputable breeder once I'm in a good situation to own a dog.     On one hand, there are millions of shelter and rescue dogs that need homes. The money I spent would go to caring for other animals in the shelter, and I would likely get a free neuter/spay and shots out of the deal.    On the other hand, a dog from a reputable breeder would be tested for genetic diseases and just that less likely to require costly treatment for health problems later in life. The money I spent on this dog would cover the costs of the dam's pregnancy and allow the breeder to continue showing and improving the breed.     One thing I would never do is spend any amount of money on a dog from a petstore or a BYB. Not only is the dog likely to have health problems, but the money spent on the dog would be lining someone's pockets and rewarding irresponsibility.    You should tell your friend, by the way, that there are plenty of purebred animals in shelters. Mutts aren't the only dogs who end up on the streets. She might have more success with a breed-specific rescue organization.|`|24CFl7sjaa	I have 2 adopted dogs, both have separation anxiety, behavioural and health issues but are now happy and well-loved dogs. I also have paid for 2 'purebreed' dogs who have known bloodlines, met the parents and I know there are no heath issues that are of concern, been with me from the start and are happy, well behaved and balanced dogs. If I had my time over I would do nothing different, each dog has its own place in my heart.|`|d2191893763b20a6b077367a131978aaaa	There is a specific type of dog that suits me. I have always paid for a purebred, and assume I will again.    Mixed breeds can be just as great a dog as a purebred.    However, "tea cup" is just a term unscrupulous "puppy producers" use for poorly bred specimins that do not meet the breed standard.    If only a choice between a poorly bred "purebred"  intentionally produced by an ignoramous that made up some fancy term, or a mix.....I would go for a mix.    You have your head on straighter than your friend.|`|26PPwzrWaa	Well your friend is an idiot for buying TEACUP. TEACUP's are scams.     A well bred dog, yes I would pay upwards of 3000 for. But if I just wanted a dog, I would go to a rescue or shelter.|`|PM23RDycaa	Well first off I wouldn't BUY a teacup anything since they don't exist. Your friend, no offense, is a fad chaser and going to realize she got ripped off when her terrier is more than 3lbs when fully grown.    That being said adopting is not for everyone, and secondly if I am looking for a specific breed and I want working/show ability I will gladly pay into the thousands for a properly bred purebred. In that case adoption wouldn't be my first route. I am going to want a blank slate.    As for adopting it depends on the shelter/resuce. Sometimes they are counter productive to their own goal of finding good homes for their animals.    Despite being an experienced dog owner, I could be turned down simply because I have a two year old who btw has grown up around animals, rent and have no fence for our backyard area. I may be more likely to shop around for another shelter or just turn and head to a breeder|`|xLO5VRYTaa	We paid $1500 for a dog that died a year and half later :P it had seizures     So this time we adopted a dog in june, she's 2 years old and she is MASSIVE! She's a rottweiler and she still has a tail (It's curly!!!)|`|OKiMkaxGaa	Your friend got ripped off by the teacup scheme.    Like another poster said, I would spend thousands to rescue, but you will not ever catch me buying a dog.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	I rather adopt, I feel a whole lot better when I do it.|`|vPde97E2aa	CHILDREN are adopted.  ANIMALS are bought & sold!    Dog-pounds SELL animals,they only call it "adoption" as part of  their on-going efforts to STRIP US OF OUR *RIGHT* OWN DOGS!!!.      & for the 83rd.time...*I* don't want a mutt.  *I* don't HAVE TO BUY ONE!  **MY*** EDUCATED ADULT CHOICE & NOBODIES BUSINESS!|`|kWwgWSSgaa	I want specific traits from a breed & want to know that the dogs will breed true to the blueprint of the breed, the breed standard. I choose to buy purebred Dobermanns, bred with health, stability, function & from in mind, from a responsible breeder with extensive knowledge of the breed.    If someone is happy to take a gamble & adopt from a breed or general rescue then that is their choice & perfectly fine.    A responsible breeder would never label their dogs with the prefix *teacup*. A red flag that the breeder is selling/deliberately trying to breed undersized dogs.|`|paaozogGaa	personally I wouldn't pay 10 cents to buy a dog  but I would pay up to $1,000 to rescue one  I would rather give my money to a good cause then to someone against spay and neuter|`|KFu7596Paa	adopt all dogs deserve a second chance|`|aCqSF87Raa	I personally always look into adoption - however there are some people who would rather have purebred. I totally understand either way. And here's why:    1) Shelter dogs have questionable pasts. If you don't know what happened to the dog in the past, you can't tell what may affect them in the future.    2) Shelter dogs have questionable breeding. If someone is allergic, they would probably want to try a purebred dog that is known for it's "hypoallergenic" qualities and would not want to risk the shelter dog shedding or having dry skin (IE traits of a dog that is NOT "hypoallergenic". )    3) Not all shelters are on the up-and-up. Some do not do behavior tests, some do not do proper health checks prior to adoption. Some just hand the dogs out without questioning experience levels, etc.     I would know, one near me is like this (we ended up with a dog they claimed was a healthy adult... turned out she had whipworms, fleas, and was under a year old. They've also housed aggressive dogs that charged the door of their kennels.)    4) With a purebred, you know their lineage and health history. Of course, this hinges on the dog being from a proper breeder and not a pet store or BYB.    5) The shelter may not have a dog that fits your personality or lifestyle.    Add - My opinion is all based on "reputable breeder" versus shelter... i do not condone buying from BYB, stores, or idiots.|`|gjD8pndjaa	Haha Tea Cup Terriers aren't even purebred, they're mixes usually, so its ironic she's so set on getting a "purebred"    I adopted my first dog, got the second from a breeder.  the next will probably be from a breeder too, but if I decide that I don't want a specific breed I'd go to a shelter.|`|AA12377116	Tell your friend there is no such thing as a teacup anything. It sounds like she's another Hilton wannabee.  At least Paris can afford to take care of her dogs when something goes wrong. And, with runts, something always goes wrong.    Small dogs are bred smaller and smaller because it is trendy right now, but people don't realize that the dog's organs aren't meant to be genetically altered and can't cope in a body that is the wrong size.     Heart problems, intestinal disorders, organ failures, blindness, REALLY bad temperaments, all are a symptom of breeding a dog line smaller and smaller.    If your friend wants a pure bred terrier (you don't say what kind, there are dozens and dozens of terrier breeds) tell her to decide what kind of terrier she wants and then find a rescue for that breed.     Tell your friend to volunteer at a shelter for a while.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	if I am looking for a show dog.  I will buy. and I will pay a lot of money for a quality one    otherwise...I would adopt.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	First off your friend is getting ripped off if she pays 2 cents for a teacup anything.  They are a poorly bred scam.      It depends upon what I am looking for at the time.  I have adopted wonderful mixed and purebred dogs from rescues and the pound.  I have paid hundreds of dollars for well bred registered purebreds from reputable breeders.      At this point in time I still have the right to choose and I do not feel that I have to defend my choice to anyone.  Your friend also has that choice.  The best thing you can do if she wants a purebred is to help her research the breed and help her to find a reputable breeder so she doesn't get ripped off. She can get purebreds from rescues or shelters also.   Also, she will be more open to your views if you are more open to hers.|`|bFzu835Aaa	I see no point in spending hundreds or thousands of dollars for a pet. You can find any purebred you want at a shelter. (there are of course the rare cases when you need a specific breed for a particular purpose, that bloodlines would make a difference in, but in 99% of cases, there's no reason you can't get a particular breed from a shelter/rescue, most are temperment tested, there's always the chance it might have an odd quirk from it's past, but really it's not as bad as some people think, most shelter dogs are happy, healthy pets).     Case in point-- I have a purebred Bulldog and a Komondor (how often do you even see one of those?!) that both were from shelters.  They're both great, well adjusted, healthy dogs as well, and I didn't have to spend $2000 plus to get either one. Tell your friend to stop being silly and just look into a breed rescue. Also be sure to mention there is not a legitimate "tea cup" anything, dogs with that label are just badly bred runts of the litters that often end up with more health problems.

1bdddf4266fa57f50020eaa561279b01aa	Antes de responderte, debo hacerte a mi vez algunas preguntas:  1. ?Ya revisaste si tu perro tiene frenillo en la lengua? a veces el problema es fisiolgico.  2. ?Hablas suficientemente con tu perro? se educa con el ejemplo.  3. ?Le has hecho una prueba de I.Q.? Tal vez le ests exigiendo demasiado a tu perro.  4. ?Tiene buena ortografa tu perro? Quizs piensa que todas las palabras se escriben con "s".  5. ?Qu edad tiene tu perro? si an est en la edad de los balbuceos, tal vez sea cuestin de tiempo para que aprenda.    Una vez que hayas descartado todos estos problemas, debes averiguar la raza de tu perro, porque no en todos los idiomas se pronuncia igual la "Z".  Por ejemplo, en latinoamrica la "z" se pronuncia como "fricativa alveolar sorda", en tanto que en Espa?a y los dems europeos que estudian espa?ol, la pronuncian como fricativa interdental sorda.    Si nada de esto da resultado, resgnate a la pronunciacin perruna, adquiere un traductor perro-espa?ol  o cmprate un perico.|`|6a9ad14604170b7a2c4a7d30429b634aaa	Jajajajajajajajajajajajaja  Jajajajajajajajajajajajaja  Como me he redo con las respuestas  Jajajajajajajajajajajajaja  Buena tu pregunta jajajajaja  Pero qu crees, los mos hablan 3 idiomas jajajajaajajajajaajajajaajaja    Buen da|`|fec1f54e832801c081450fe2c1102da1aa	Lo llevas a un buen logopeda y solucionado.|`|f9904c23ef74f9f686274e9c8e2369a5aa	Hola holita    Comienza solucionando primero tu problema, majo!!

AA10072754	NO as you can feed a dog poor food but they will still have soft fur.|`|8f6d7df4f9a9d1837489325dea55817caa	While most rotties have more coarse, wavy hair..if he is mixed with a Staff, soft fur wouldn't have me concerned...unless it wasn't soft and suddenly became that way.    What are you feeding him?

a5e3f3f35e3c4487f2f784a995440c88aa	Your boy isn't sexually attracted to humans...he feels dominant over them.  His humping is a clear sign that your family needs to let this little boy know that he isn't the alpha, ruler, in the house, the humans are.    While neutering him is a good idea, it won't stop the humping.  Only your family changing their behavior to the dog will eliminate this problem.    Some tips:    1) Dogs eat after humans.  After your meal is done, then feed the dog.  If your schedule doesnt permit this, pretend to eat out of the dogs dish before putting it down.  * Alphas eat first, subordinates wait until alpha is finished and they get what is left over.    2) Dogs dont get on furniture unless invited.  They dont sit on the back of the couch/chair with their head higher than the human.  * Alphas get the highest resting spots, the best vantage points.    3) Dogs dont sleep in beds with humans.  If the dog is being particularly difficult, they dont sleep in the bedroom at all.  * Alphas get the most secure sleeping spots, with underlings sleeping elsewhere.    4) Dogs dont go out doors/down stairs/down narrow hallways in front of humans.  If necessary, attach a short lead to the dog and hold him behind you while teaching this.  * Alpha leads the way, always.    5) Dogs move out of the way if a human is approaching and the dog is in the path.  Order the dog to move, gently nudging him if needed.  * Alpha doesnt have to walk around or step over subordinatesmake way for the king!    6) Dogs get petted from the top down.  Top of the muzzle, not under the chin.  There should especially be no kissy face to the dogs chin!  * Alphas show affection from top downunderlings show submission by licking chins.    7) No tug-of-war or other power games, especially involving children and dogs.  The only time such games should be played is if the human never loses, never even starts to lose, and the human ends the game.  * Alphas dont play power games.  They win contests, but they dont play if theres a chance they will lose.    8) Dogs get petted on human terms.  For each 4 or 5 times the dog asks to be petted, tell him he has to wait.  After two or three minutes, then call him and pet him.  Humans always end the petting session, with a verbal signal, like, OK, enough now.  * Alphas dole out affection on their terms, not upon the demand of the underlings.    9) Dogs get obedience training and learn to follow the first command given.  * Alphas tell underlings what to do and dont repeat themselves    10) Dogs are ordered to lie down and stay for 3  5 minutes at least once a day.  (this is usually performed with problem dogs)  * Alphas do this to challengers simply to prove they are the ruler|`|bbd9127ab9d2e428fd9940ec335859e2aa	I have the same dog as u!

Get him fixed, he will stop humping.     Breeding your pets is irresponsible.  Unless you are VERY sure that your animals bloodline is clean and healthy and you ONLY stud out to PROFESSIONAL RESPECTED breeders, then I say just get him fixed and don't continue to perpetuate the cycle of animal over population.    The only reason animals should be bred is to "Better the breed", not so he will stop humping.     FYI -- if you let him breed it isn't going to stop the humping, it will only make it worse!|`|37908eb24f37d6fcc71355ef99d76a87aa	He's your dog, so therefore if you want to breed him, do so.

A good breeder will not accept your dog due to the fact you don't have all the papers or a good reason to breed him.  A backyard breeder of any kind on the other hand...will breed him.  Then you could be responsible for the suffering of more animals but if you really want that go ahead.  Also mating him won't make him stop humping.  Actually he could injure himself if he gets caught in a tie.      Just because you have a purebred does not mean that his gene pool is pure.      Also humping could be a sign of dominance.  In other words...he needs training.|`|343e82c3282de9e62aaf833d5d14da3faa	you can do a stud service, or better yet, get him fixed.|`|69c8f823b1c55eecfea80acc2b0f542aaa	My Shi tzu has a stuff doggie and he will go at it w/ her lol.

0b6691be66651a8e0f44ae92e9fce0a2aa	Hi Tasha...unfortunately no one can legally possess a ferret in the state of California.  Doing so would immediately constitute having the animal taken away and instantly euthanized.      Here's a PDF which talks about why they are illegal:  http://www.goldenstateferretsociety.org/...    Summary: A number of states classified ferrets as wild animals and banned them as pets before they become popular as companion animals in the United States. As ferrets grew in popularity, these bans were overturned in quick succession. At this point, California and Hawaii remain the only two states to prohibit ferrets. There has been no effort to legalize them in Hawaii, whereas the stuggle in California has been ongoing for fifteen years.    The stated objection given by ferret opponents in California is that ferrets could start breeding in the wild and pose a threat to agriculture and native species. Since ferrets in the U.S. are exclusively indoor pets, are almost always spayed and neutered, do not survive on their own for more than a few days, and have absolutely no history of breeding on their own anywhere in the country, we are not sure where these fears are coming from. Although the true motivation for opposing ferrets remains a mystery to us, we hope that the injustice will soon be rectified, either by the legislature or through a statewide ballot initiative.|`|AA12303637	you cant thier illegal|`|cf0b799ca858d2b61568a7242740106aaa	Drive to Arizona and buy one there.|`|0807d97caa7f8773e72f13191f43efeaaa	nope, you can't, its illegal.  and i must say i agree with that law!|`|9bd81fd5e4d605f9dfd89397b2fb1376aa	Ferrets do not carry many disease's, they are almost rabies free.

Using Cesar's methods (none of which involve side-putting), I can manage to make them all quiet at once, much to my coworkers' relief. He takes their ancestory and instinctual behavior in consideration, which is why I love it. And none of it EVER physically and psychologically abuses the animals. In fact, I'd say 100% of the animals he treats are relieved.

Let your dog sleep with it, play with it, etc. Relate positive things to the article so your dog will think that his scent means good things will come.    You might not have anything with his scent on it since he has probably been gone for a time you can ask him to send back some kind of clothing that he wore like his underwear(bottom or top), socks, etc. Make sure he doesn't wash it before he sends it or that will defeat the purpose.    Give it your dog only a few days in advance to your husbands arrival.

These contain meat "by-products" and fillers.    I used Innova small bites when my Yorkie puppy was younger and she was only about 1 lb, so it's small enough for the smallest dogs.
27d2fe79dd9df7b907483b0eb75c1a39aa	This is why she should be spayed before her first heat cycle.  The risk of breast cancer increases now that she has had her first heat cycle. Get her spayed!!!|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	My dog has very large nipples herself.  She just went into her second heat, but prior to that she always had about nipples that stuck out about 1/4" from her body.  Being that I'm not sure if you mean her nipples are just bigger or if her actual mammary glands are starting to fill with milk it could also be that your dog went into a false pregnancy, which can happen after a dog's heat if they don't lock with a male.  Once the hormone levels level themselves out, the false pregnancy will resolve itself.|`|AA10072754	Its because your dog isn't altered.  Its best to have it done before her first heat cycle.  Now you have increased her chances of so many problems.  If you really want to decrease it a bit get her altered ASAP.  Obviously you aren't breeder material to be honest.  Don't take that too personal.    Your choice....do you like to spend money....or would you just like her altered now?|`|7fe1b273a9f987230ff6b1a136231dd3aa	doesn't a 6 month old baby have nipples too?    they're gonna show up at some point.|`|7cb0882b49e324af9fba3e0bd3d1048daa	If they are enlarged, then she may still be in heat.  A dog's heat will last for about 3 weeks. But, female dogs do have larger nipples than males, so it could just be that hers are growing as she gets older.|`|AA11513836	Hope this helps ---     The nipples on a female who has not yet had her first heat are quite small, but they swell with the first heat and never return to 'puppy size'.   If the female dog has been bred and is pregnant, then about 35 days after the mating the nipples will turn a deep pink colour and will begin to enlarge.   The mammary glands produce the milk to feed the puppies and amazingly enough they manage to manufacture the right supply to meet the demand.   Female dogs who are extremely maternal have been known to produce milk for a starving pup or another animal baby even though they are not pregnant or nursing their own litter.   The mammary glands are prone to cancerous tumors because of the estrogen produced.   Once the dog has been "spayed", (fixed or altered) the source of the estrogen has been removed and the chance of breast cancer developing is greatly reduced.|`|c84257eddb2b69b3d94cb8dcd5b53715aa	Once they go into heat, they forever have larger nipples.|`|db4af88e2be307dc7e7a027d5fe7e8d9aa	yeah when you were born you had nipples why cant a dog|`|dc1efd00d090a0e72c4127b80bd0c2c3aa	Since your dog is obviously intact she is starting her estus cycle and part of that is a false pregnancy if she has not been bred.  Her hormones will tell her body it is pregnant even if she isn't. She may lactate and could possibly go through all the psycological symptoms of pregnancy such as nesting and false labor.    If you want to know more about it check out this website and search canine false pregnancy.
AA11000131	Let me make sure I have this straight: both chinchillas have a wet, matted patch of fur just under their chins, correct?    If this is the case, I would urge you to get your chinchillas to a vet as soon as possible.  This wet chin could be caused by "malocclusion" - a serious genetic tooth problem which could be the cause of their drooling, and is fatal if it remains untreated.  I doubt it is a fungus, which would effect likely their entire coat.    Pets can't be accurately diagnosed on the internet.

Your husband needs to be the dominant one-when your kiddo acts up and acts possessive he needs to be corrected gently at once.    The weight range sounds like a good fit-My two girls are 3.5 pounds and the male is 7 pounds (all are spayed/neutered) and Cody is great with the girls.  When you start to have to worry about weght is when they get to 20 or 30 pounds different, the smaller dog could be hurt inadvertantly.    I believe dogs do well together-smaller dogs really seem to be more confident in a pack.  Good luck!
a87cc31446c69b19d35d73a77f2133eeaa	My guinea pig Charlie loves to LICK my finger, yes she really does lick. I've only been bitten once (that drew blood). Simon was new to my house and his background was that he was left in a box to let all the animals get to him so he was hand shy for awhile. Someone said that guinea pigs don't like to be handled, I don't know where you got that from! My little girl Charlie loves to be picked up and loves to cuddle with me. So to answer your question, they rarely bite unless they're startled or angry. Check out these sites:  www.cavymadness.com  www.cavyspirit.com  www.cavycages.com|`|AA12168102	Rarely, unless they are extremely upset or afraid.  You may hear their teeth chattering, a sound they make by clacking their teeth together. Although its rare, if its directed at you, they are telling you to keep away, so please be respectful if your guinea pig is annoyed or upset.  Generally, ginuea pigs are much gentler than hamsters!|`|cf98d4945a0896712e6aa89234f858c2aa	In my personal experience: they only bite if they are scared or your finger gets in the way when their chomping down on a carrot.|`|AA11806612	I've had four guinea pigs, and none of them ever bit me. They were really shy though, and I like pet rats a lot better.|`|ae7d591435e833942a65119f33c82787aa	sometimes, if you get them when theyre young and they get to know you, they probably wont bite. They might "nibble" but not bite|`|c65c844a22b89eff06bc3bcbb3881634aa	I had 19 guinea pigs, and they have never bitten me.  They're pretty tame, but they're also extremely shy, and they prefer not to be handled. They squeal too. And they breed like crazy! Never get a male and female unless you want 20 of them! LOL.|`|AA11713384	You might get bit if you have something sweet smelling on your fingers like lotion, orange juice, candy, or something like that. A guinea pig usually doesn't bite to be mean.|`|1e24cf7bb79a3ff28dae4dfe88440026aa	well it depends, mine just nibbles and it dosent hurt but if you scare him he will bite pretty hard|`|e4891efcb808213d898f07ad2c4ee8e2aa	I have had five guinea pigs, and only one of them ever bit, and she bit a lot. But she would bite me since i first got her. But the majority of guinea pigs that i have met do Not bite. I also work at a vet clinic, and we see a lot of guinea pigs, and non of them have bitten anyone since i've been there. But when they do it hurts pretty bad. Sammy drew blood a few times (though only a drop). You should pick your guinea pig up right way, and hold him/her a lot so they get used to being handled. That will help it get socialized with people, and less likely to bite. I think guinea pigs are wonderful pets, and i'm glad you hear you are getting one. They are not generally shy if you give them the attention they need, they are very friendly and social animals.|`|AA10072754	They do if they're scared or mad.  I once made the mistake of picking up one within a week of getting it.  He took quite a chunk out of my finger.|`|cf85fc6dd024c60de9b5cb73ce4250eaaa	While they have the same teeth and such,it is very unlikely the will bite you as easily as hamsters will.|`|0947174b30b681b319d33f3776722b6faa	when they are scared they might bite.if you get an older one they are less likey 2 bite|`|717d26e949654a161d5109bb37b052f4aa	No they dont bite unless they feel harmed, it really depends where they bite you. When they nibble it doesnt hurt and they do that alot more, don't ask me why 'cause I'm still trying to figure it out lol. There very sweet pets though.
8f01b754b50cbf4bcdcf8d652b952e0caa	Both volatile breeds I would say no really|`|972c756a0dacaa8f78a3428843e01730aa	I think they would get along famously. They are both energetic and playful and can keep each other company and stimilated. But watch out you guys, that much energy in 2 compact packages is likely to sperad mischef around! :-D|`|AA10072754	why not another jack russell?|`|e5958e760ea4dfb6e8718aa36a8c1681aa	i think if u got a dog thats lonley get a dog thats the same breed or if u cant get a similar breed!|`|593d839c7763bca1f3605d59ae72662daa	The Jack Russell needs exercise and something to do to keep her busy.    So does a staffy or any other pit bull type breed.    I do not suggest putting these two together unless:  1. Both are spayed/neutered.  2. They are fixed AND opposite sexes.  3. They are both well trained.  4. You keep them separate when they can't be supervised.  5. You introduce them properly over a period of time.  6. You do your research about both breeds first.    http://www.libertydogtraining.com
f70dc38eb6a21075ba63c4c33068cbacaa	i use carefresh and truly have tried just about everythingout there! i hav efound that it really is the best and that it is best for the health of the animal too. dont make sudden changesinthe beddding tho. it could stresss out ur animal and therefore make it ill. i would do a mixture of the two and each week use less and less aspen.    goodluck!|`|b402a3c916f7468b54ad48aa6528138daa	It depends upon the type of animal you have.  But most Vets will tell you to use plain scent free pads to line the cages with.  It is better on the animals respiratory system.|`|AA10072754	umm cedar causes respiratory problems    I am a die hard carefresh fan.  Its odorless and edible so....|`|AA12185767	Hi there!!    Some pet stores sell beds for animals that have cedar chips mixed in with the bedding material. The cedar chips absorb odor and moisture so the bed won't get that "funky animal smell". I have it for my cat, and she loves it! Also, if you want a quick freshness boost, you can try spraying a light mist of Febreze over the bed. Febreze is safe to use around animals, so there won't be any chance of an allergic reaction. Hope this helps!! :)|`|b5de725a745fed245bcc87cecfc588cbaa	Given that your pet is a rodent, you will want to avoid cedar bedding that was suggested above.  Cedar bedding is very dangerous to rodents' respiratory systems.    The aspen is a good choice as chip beddings go.    I don't have enough information on carefresh and cell absorb to help you there, but did want to put in 2 cents about cedar bedding with rodents.|`|dc0d18fce43f3e33fe9ba117ad249538aa	Gentle Touch is the best at absorbing odor.  It comes in large pellets though, so I'm not sure how comfortable it would be to rat feet.|`|e3477f9e2cc7ef6548e12a7984964795aa	I own and operate a grooming business and I know from experience that cedar shavings offer the most benefit. Not only will it take care of any odor but it also repels fleas and insects.

If she has a heart and I'm sure she does, you will be bringing home your puppy.|`|LraBRIccaa	YOU DON"T!!!!! MWAHHAHAHAHAHA!!!!|`|aCqSF87Raa	If mom thinks you aren't responsible enough, then she means it - you must not have done enough to prove responsibility. Otherwise she would not have said so. You may have spoiled your previous pets, but who did the dirty work? Do you help with chores without whining? Do you do your schoolwork on time?    Nevertheless, it's ultimately HER decision. She will be the one paying for the dog and it's care, and she's obviously worried she will be the main caregiver. She works hard to keep the house and keep you healthy and safe. It isn't fair on her to spend her money/time when she doesn't seem to want the dog - that would be like you working 9-5 and having to pay for her car.    So do what the rest of us (mature, responsible, adults) have done:     Get a job to pay for the dog and it's care (as well as put $$ away for college.)     Do chores to prove you are willing to do the dirty work.     Stop using your grades as a bargaining chip (if you are.... these are very important to your future and i personally would not give my child anything if they put their future on the line like that... sort of childish.)     Do PROPER RESEARCH on your breed of choice - include grooming needs, exercise needs, training techniques, costs, etc.    Stop whining and accept that right now isn't the best time for a dog.    Think about your future like SHE probably is - college won't allow dogs in the dorms and most don't allow freshmen in apartments.|`|9MjaiYj4aa	Show her you can be responsible or find free dogs in the newspaper and ask if you can get one because it would be free.|`|nPuZVGFRaa	Well I have 5 dogs now and heres how I got them--    1.)

I wouldn't talk to my mom or dad for a long time until they got me the dog. :)    4.) When my birthday came I asked for nothing except a dog and they didn't know what to get me so they got me the dog. :)    5.) I did the dishes, cooked, cleaned, EVERYTHING! And then I showed responsibility and got the dog! :)    Go to a shelter or pound and get a dog not a pet store or breeder.  Did you know that every 4 minutes 40 dogs in shelters die? Yeah.. Shocking But True. :(|`|TTccQ9cUaa	First make sure if u really can take care of a dog, because u have to go at least 2 times a day morning & evening for the dog's poo. And if u r dead sure that u can provide & do all the things which r necessary for a dog then only i would suggest u to go for a pet.Many people 1st they  adopt a pet but later they r tired or can't take care of their pets then they just leave the animal on the street.|`|4pHsMhwfaa	lol just do it|`|9FbECRaKaa	Well, you could tell her that if you have a dog you wont be lonely because that really works, and you could tell her that you feel really bad and that you need a dog, a pet so you can have fun and be distracted with something if you are bored and not bothering...

I have seen dogs come and I have seen dogs go. You have to find the breed that fits your families lifestyle. Be sure that it is a good family dog with good blood lines and be sure to do your research. Moms love when you have all your research organized and you are really motivated to that one particular task.     I volunteered at an animal shelter and visited as often as possible. bring them your old sheets and things that the animals could use. You have to show her that you will be okay if you do not get what you want. Make sure this is really what you want and prove yourself. Anybody can do it and if you are half as determined and set as I think you are you'll do fine.     Be honest with and her let her know what your thinking. About your plan and everything. try to explain it to her and maybe you will be able to have an adult conversation with no bickering and a respectful manner. Its always worth a try.

I am amazed your Vet didn't suggest this when you called him.     She could have been 'marking' but usually if there is any trace of blood in the urine it normally denotes a UTI.    I'd take a urine sample to your Vet and get him to check it out for you to put your mind at rest.   You don't want to let this continue especially if the urine contains blood.

9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	It really, really depends on the individual child.    The book that infected me with aqaurium-mania, when I was not much older than 10, was "Exotic Aquarium Fishes," by William T. Innes. It was first published in 1935 and went through many editions thereafter. It's pretty old now, of course, but most hobbyists still consider it a classic, and arguably the the greatest aquarium guidebook of all time. You can get this book at most used-book stores. There is also an updated version still in print (updated by other authors, after Dr. Innes died in 1969 at age 95), but it doesn't quite have the same elegance and beauty as the first 19 editions that were edited and printed by Innes himself. Innes was also the founder and publisher of "The Aquarium," the greatest aquarium magazine of its time. Old issues are now coveted collector's items.    Having said all that, I think that if the child, or friends or relatives of the child, have aquarium fish, a book about the species being kept would be the best introduction. You can get books about goldfish, guppies, platies, cichlids, rainbow fish, angelfish, Oscars, catfish, loaches, clownfish, and so on.    Much also depends on the child's reading level. Some 10-year-olds read at a near-adult level, while others do not. For children who aren't big readers, a book with a lot of color pictures and relatively little text is probably best.
AA10029366	The first dogs in AKC recognized breeds were registered because their National Breed Club applied for AKC recognition, gave their internal registration records, Breed Standard, and stud books to the AKC, and went through the recognition process. The dogs registered through the National club were then registered through the AKC upon recognition.    The ConKC is recognizing mixes now? Huh. Money talks, I guess.    Papers are only as good as the breeder they came from. And anyone registering an AKC-recognized breed through the ConKC is a sucky breeder.    You're out of luck, unless you want an ILP/PAL number.

You can ILP your dog for obedience or agility.|`|KuGQFZPraa	Sorry, if both parents are not AKC registered, your pooch cannot be AKC registered.|`|0a07f2e5a084ebc8ae39f790612c5390aa	No!!!   They will not let you register your dog unless his parents have papers if there parents have papers wherever you got the dog from will usually register the litter for atleast 6 months that way you can transfer the dog in your name and get him or her fully registered..|`|WIFKeDBgaa	If you mean Canadian Kennel Club, then yes. Several foreign registries are able to get AKC registration. They require a 3 generation pedigree from the countries registry, a Bescheinigung if from Germany, and "export" stamped pedigree, some require a front and side picture of the dog. It varies depending on the origin of the dog. Look at the Foreign and special registration documents on AKC's website.
TgNQAYyXaa	Security companies, police forces, security forces around the world use mostly German Shepherds & Rottweilers for protection/guard work.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	Any dog, you donthave to train your dog to bite on command, that would be the worst thing ever. A dog is very smart, and can protect if he feels an intrudor is coming.|`|eTsCJYALaa	I would say German Shepherd. They are very devoted and protective of their owners. I think they would deter anybody with vicious intent.|`|dYqC3s10aa	Companion dogs  here one  Bichon   or these other  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bichon|`|oRzqWhsDaa	rotwellier or german shepard|`|7bnQmXksaa	Good Question easy to answer.

No dog should be used for protection.   Dogs should be as a companion.     Get a security system instead.    A dog will naturally protect its pack. Get a dog that fits your lifestyle, but avoid breeds that have a bad rep.   Problem is breeds get banned if they bite even if they are protecting what's theirs, especially if they are a pit bull, rottie, doberman, GSD, or any other breed with a bad rep.     If you get a dog learn what BSL is and why not to support it.|`|NLwcbQrZaa	the chineese dogs i don't know how u spell there name but the 1s with the long hair, they r the BEST|`|W1UHwwsoaa	Wow.... why would you want that?

AA11441276	Tell them you have a dog. You've taken care of it. You understand the responsibilities of pets. Tell them that you've looked into taking care of bunnies, you know what to do, what they need, how often they should be fed...etc. Also tell them it's no burden on them, you're paying for it, it'll be in your room.       I hope you are able to get one!  Good Luck!!|`|xQtnTKCAaa	they do smell but if you clean them out once or twice a week it wont smell. your responsible so there really shouldn't be any problem. Also there is stuff that you can get at the pet store that help covers up the smell. tell your parents that you did all the research and that you are responsible enough to take care of the rabbit. if you have all the money for the supplies then you should be allowed to get one.   good luck!|`|dpgPsVnaaa	you are 12 so ill talk to you as an adult and hope you understand.    responsibility is hard to show to parents .. often times they are ignorant    step one    get everything but the bunny    the cage, the water bottle, the food, the wood chips EVERYTHING    set it all up how you want it (WITHOUT YOUR PARENTS KNOWING ..  this is key)    print up some information about bunnies and how to take care for them .... save money for shots and whatever else it needs,  and save another $100 bucks to show them this is for the bunny only, THEN without your parents knowing .. buy the bunny and have it set up ... when they find out .. show them what you have done ... provided shelter food and emergancy money just incase ...show them what you have printed and read    in life you will have to do this for your wife (if you are a boy... who likes girls)     what your parents are worried about is you come home with nothing to show but the rabbit .. once they see you have everything set up .. i dont see why they wouldnt say yes|`|1LNEquuoaa	Show your parents how responsible you are by helping out around the house. Do not nag them, easier said than done, lol.  they will soon see that you deserve a bunny.                                      GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IzRk1mZQaa	What a tough question! I have a chihuahua that likes to nip at people who come in, so we have a little "beware of dog" sign.  If you have let everyone know, she entered the house knowing, didn't announce herself, then to me it sounds like the dog was doing his job, protecting his home.  It's not like the dog was off the leash in the road and ran up and bit her - he was in his house.  Secondly, what a rude guest to enter your home without ringing the doorbell, and what a poor friend to tell you to put your dog to sleep.      Just to be safe, call your home insurance company, and animal control, and ask their opinions.  You don't have to tell animal control your name, just ask the question.  Good Luck to you - I can only imagine how you feel.|`|AHEFXgE7aa	It happened in your house, so legally, you are ok, but morally, maybe you should put him to sleep.  Friendships are more important than pets that bit them.    Cheers|`|nMzzwrtUaa	No she is wrong for just walking in to your house, even if she where to file a suit to order your dog to be put to sleep even the judge will state then just walked in to your house and got what they deserved. The dog was naturally protecting his home and masters.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	The dog may have been frightened by her walking in. She is wrong to try and make you put him down - there really is no need under these circumstances.|`|26PPwzrWaa	I think your moms friend is rude, not your dog just protecting the property.     Tell your friends mom no, you will not put your dog to sleep and that she trespassed on your property and you could have her arrested for that. That should shut her up. Next time she does it, threaten to call the police.     Your dog was picking up on you not wanting people to do that through your body language.     And just so you know, please become a leader for your dog so she doesnt bark after you acknowledge her.    www.flyingdogpress.com can help you with that.|`|lyNgNpRgaa	Sounds like your mother's friend is a Bish and not really a friend.      She can't demand the animal be put to sleep, only the city or county can make you do that.  She can sue however or report your animal to the city.|`|qc7zP89jaa	No,That would be wrong..  Dogs bite...  Its not the dogs fault that she just walked in right??  Why would you put a dog down for biting???  Seriously,She might have a problem..  So no dont do that....  :) -Tina |`|AA12202402	No! Not if she entered the home without ringing the bell or knocking....See he was doing his job so to speak. He was guarding the cave and to him being the leader of the pack. The leader of the pack's main job is to protect his family and home. To him she was a intruder....many folks want there animals to love and protect them. You got it all|`|bYRq1Tu2aa	Definitely dont put it to sleep  Its the friends fault for not listening to you  Wouldnt you want the dog to do that if a burglar came into your house?|`|FmIAKDJLaa	She is very wrong. You dont put a dog to sleep for defending his territory and friends. Or for one bite. You put dogs to sleep for vicious attacks that are going to happen again. Do not put your dog to sleep.|`|dOtAn8ljaa	She's in the wrong. That dog would probably do anything in the world to protect you guys. The worst thing you could do is put it to sleep, especially if she was warned. Some friend your mom has.|`|KVB1xDTwaa	You should not put ur dog to sleep if she's been prewarned she's an idiot for not listening if u ask me she deserved it. I would never put my dog to sleep for that. and its a small dog its not like it could've hurt that bad tell her to put her big girl panties on and get over it!!! Its rediculous that she would want u to put ur dog to sleep over something like that!!!|`|6VFh61jhaa	No your dog should not be put to sleep. It didn't do anything wong. Your mom's friend was warned to ring the door bell and come in through the front door. Your mom's friend shouldn't have came in through the garage unnannounced. If she want to try to force you to put your dog down, she will have to take it to court and to animal control. If she takes it to court, then you can say she came into the house without your permission, so the dog was protecting the territroy and the family. She will loose the case=) Good luck and give your dog a hug for me.|`|wSYYfBK4aa	I think your mother's friend should be put to sleep.|`|o8ROmRbAaa	no. don't put that poor dog to sleep. he didn't do a thing. its an instinct.|`|R2pyXBzCaa	No don't but him down. If its the first time of a bad attitude or has ever bitten anyone. if it happens again then yes but if its the first time no|`|WXuZKOBAaa	I think she is blowing it way out of proportion...especailly if you for-warned her about the way to enter the house. Your dog was probably just trying to protect you and your house...its their natural instinct to protect :p you really shouldnt put him to sleep for HER mistake. and she should know that.|`|CIVRBHlKaa	I definitely would not put my dog down because of that. The dog was more than likely trying to protect whoever was in the home because he or she thought a stranger was in there house! And she had been told to use the doorbell and enter the front door and did not do that so that was kind of asking for it if you ask me? Thats just my opinion.|`|GUmQlcBuaa	No, that is wrong. The only reason a dog should ever be put to sleep is if he/she is suffering, which your dog isn't.    It's not the dog's fault that he bit her, he didn't know she was a friend. He was just trying to protect you, which is completely normal for dogs to do.     If your mom's friend is that concerned about your dog biting her, then maybe she should ring the doorbell. Or, you could get your dog a muzzle for when you have guests. But just keep it on him until he calms down.    Also, dogs can bite from excitement.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	No your dog was defending your house, your moms friend was intruding. How could she come into the house without ringing the doorbell and just barge in.
AztYCjc7aa	Yup dogs can definitely make out pictures on TV. Some dogs just think of the tv as background noise and ignore it, other dogs are fascinated with it and (like my pomeranian Boo) will sit in front of the tv and watch their favorite tv show. My dog loves listening to spongebob laugh by tilting his head to the side and he loves barking with the dogs in Dogtown and The Dog Whisperer.|`|4bb411fe8f2ea252a5857d6f647a6233aa	They can see it. Some dogs actually follow the action and will go behind the screen to see where the figures are, some dogs just ignore it.  My friends dogs particularly like the animal planet shows and would sit for an hour watching something with other dogs on it.  It would be interesting to know what they think about it.  My guy will get between me and the screen so he can block my vision and get my attention.|`|h09gCzJgaa	yes they can, and whoever tells u they can't is a total moron.  My dogs watch tv all the time.  They love horses especially, and when i turn on my wii, they come running and i can see their heads following the wii finger around.  Also in the UK there is research being done on dogs whether they are able to analyze like ppl do.  They show pictures up on a tv and the dog has to nudge the pictures on the tv screen. and yes they can do it so yes they can see the pictures on the screen.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Yes they can and thats why I leave it on when I leave the house so they have somthing to watch..If it has to do with animals their ears perk up,so cute when they see a dog run off screen and they run behind the tv looking for it|`|ErvhPYlbaa	YES!    I watch animal planet all the time and my little one LOVES when dogs are on TV!  She perks up and wags her tail.  If they bark, she barks back.      I LOVE IT!|`|KxjUim7yaa	Sure. Mine love the blonde weather girl. Some people they bark at.|`|9vhXo9Pkaa	they probably can but my dog ignores it|`|scfFf89Yaa	they can. my dog likes to watch the horses on the western channel. she gets all excited and starts barking at them
wuBIF9aPaa	i personally want to welcome you to the back yard breeders club.    now for your question:  they have to have a romantic dinner first and talk about financial responsibility for the puppies they are to produce as well they dogs that will die in the shelter because of their litter.  they also have to start pre screening potential adopters.  btw no normal dog would ever breed until it had all its health testing done to make sure no genetic problems will be passed on to the puppies.  (i mean after all what dog would want to produce unhealthy kids???)   Since your dog is obviously not up on the ethics of breeds  you should have both dogs fixed.      if you don't , please send your back yard breeder club membership fee of 1000/pup they produce to your local shelter / rescue     thanks!  your local dying shelter dogs|`|PM23RDycaa	If you have to ask you have no business owning intact animals. It can take only one time just like every other creature on the face of the earth.

Don't breed your dogs.|`|LVDoQ1Kaaa	it normally takes 3 days together to get it right|`|9kTejB0uaa	Once 'll do it!!  And they 'tie', they don't lock up.

But if you want to make sure she gets pregnant, spay her first.    Some people will thumbs down anything :(|`|A21SswSfaa	No, it's not. Sometimes it only takes once and sometimes it takes many times. Hopefully, since it was only once, she's not pregnant and you can have her spayed.|`|AA12202402	www.peteducation.com  Breeding stages of heat etc. Takes more than the deed to get it done.

NoOM7eZnaa	CALM DOWN. That's the first step.    Now, he's swollen, right? Be calm. Firstly, add a small amount of aquarium salt (0.002-0.003PPM) to reduce stress. Now, cover your filter. Next step.    It's just his fin. If it's not completely torn off, anything torn off will grow back, and the swelling will go down. If it's not better in a few days, take it to the vet.    EDIT: Some vets will refuse to work on goldfish. If this happens, tell them you're raising a show fish. It works for me.
TYohMrlXaa	You should stop feeding for 2 or 3 days, then feed peas, cooked, skin removed and choped into bite sized peices. This hopefully will clear up the problem.     Its always a good idea to supplement veggies. Blanched lettuce or any greens, steamed brocolli, the peas, occasionally some fruit like 2 or 3 times a mouth. Try puting an orange slice in there he will go nuts! Just make sure cut off the peal and that white stuff, and take out the seeds.    Orandas are very prone to swim bladder problems, I would look into changing his diet, maybe a sinking pellet that you soak in tank water first.     If you really want to try something cool, check out gel foods, you can make them yourself, http://www.kokosgoldfish.invisionzone.co...    or order Mazuri Gel Food online. http://www.goldfishutopia.com/index.php?...|`|fOT0lRqhaa	yes|`|8QvvXYaqaa	Sounds like a swim bladder issue
H06PtiIAaa	depends on what type of trigger, as clown triggers wont like eachother and two of them will get large for a 100 gallon but if they were different species like humu then they can fit into a 100.    Everything sounds good but the tangs, they dont really belong in this setup.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	you'd need the biggest skimmer in the world    triggers don't mix well and certainly not in a 100 gallon tank    triggers and puffers also like to nip at the fin radiole of lionfish and at eel tails      with a decent skimmer i'd recomend the lion, eel and tangs (depending on the type, some stay 8" some get 2 feet)      2 sailfins would probably kill each other  i know it's contrite but what about a yellow and a hippo tang (or scopas, kole, tomini, chistle tooth)    as for eels, you'l want a smaller one  snowflake, chainlink, saxicola, white eyed|`|RXYZb6bsaa	if your going to do it right any tang that would fit in a 100 would be too peaceful
4yt4D3vMaa	Rabbits don't get wet tail like hamsters do-they can get a wet back end if they have diarrhea but that would be obvious from checking his cage. he may have been spraying to mark his territory and got it on his fur-you need to get one or both rabbits neutered or you have very little chance of them bonding. those are pretty bad signs of aggression your lionhead is showing so I would neuter him/her first and keep them separate until the hormones wear off-once rabbits take a real dislike to each other they don't usually become friends in my experience.|`|rlvrgwWvaa	He might be nervous. This is a really good article about pairing rabbits, it will help you. If the wet tail persists, call a vet.    http://www.coloradohrs.com/articles/adop...|`|AA11533507	hi, well i can only go by the rabbitts that i have.  there is a thing that rabbitts get, called wet tail, and it does need to be treated, by the vet, best to pop them down there, and get them check out.
AA12377116	I'm keeping my fingers crossed for Thunder.    Your dog is luck to have survived long enough to make it into surgery.    Dogs whose stomaches twist usually die withing 15-20 minutes.    Large chested dogs usually have their stomaches tacked to the abdominal wall as puppies, if they are from breeders, just to prevent this exact condition.    Typically, a large and untacked dog will eat (or drink too much water)and then, if the dog starts jumping around or gets very active after eating, the full stomache will twist around.    Thunder sounds like a lucky dog. The surgeon probably tacked the tummy but if not, have it done immediately|`|wuBIF9aPaa	sounds like he made it through the surgery ok, which is a very good sign. means they got him in on time.   hang in there!!!|`|mTTPLly4aa	I will be as honest as I hope your expecting.   If the vet says he will be ok then he probably will be, this type of thing happens, and every vet out there knows how to take care of it.    some make it and some don't.    consider you and your dog one of the lucky ones.|`|KVB1xDTwaa	he should be fine after having surgery its the getting to surgery part that u needed to be worried about because if they don't get the surgery quick enough they die but u got him the surgery so he should recover quickly!|`|FewhKlx9aa	Thank god he's ok,they say the best thing for this tho is to feed smaller meals throughout the day rather than 1 or 2 large meals.Also have a bowl that is at his neck height and no exercise right after eating.|`|9vhXo9Pkaa	Pray to God! and all will be ok|`|rumYVkDsaa	i hear that dogs stomach twists often if they dont relax after eating. Its like there stomach isnt directly attahed to there something i dont know but they need to relax after eating meals for 40 minutes and let there stomach settle. Something like that but i hear its usually fatal so i am glad it worked out fr your dog|`|ti8L5zryaa	Bloat tends to happen again.  Try to find information about feeding, etc. to prevent bloat from happening again.  This is probably what cause the stomach to twist.  One of the things you must do is absolutely not let him exercise right after eating.  Your vet can give you more advice.|`|kC2Iseh3aa	I'm really sorry to hear about your dog.  GDV (stomach twisting) can be a really serious situation, but the best thing that can be done is surgery.  They deflate the stomach and tack it into place so that it won't twist again.    Since your dog made it through surgery, I think it's safe to say he's out of the woods.  Just be sure that your family gets detailed instructions from your vet about post-surgical care and tips to prevent the stomach from trying to twist again.    Think good thoughts about him and get regular updates.  Barring infection which is possible with any invasive surgery, he should be fine.  He's young.  He'll bounce back.  =)|`|519QpFIYaa	if they caught it in time for him to go into surgery he should be just fine.|`|AA10029366	If they were able to get a tube down into his stomach and get it straightened out before any of the tissue died off, he should be fine.    The unfortunate part is that once a dog bloats and has gastric torsion, they tend to do it again unless their stomach is tacked. :(    Best wishes for your boy!

tPGxPDvBaa	Doubtful, chis & terriers both shed & have dander & can have skin problems - things that allergic ppl can't take.  However it does depend on the person & the dog.  Any dog can get fleas if fleas are around, there are no breeds that attract fleas.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	"Terrier"  Describes a wide range of dogs, with very different coats.   Which breed of terrier are you speaking of?    Typically, no mutts unless both the breeds involved were deemed to be "better" for allergy sufferers, are good for allergies.   A chihuahua is definitely not a low shedding dog. And I will assume JRT for the terrier portion, which is also not a low shed dog.     Fleas is not an issue of the breed rather an issue of contact with other dogs, cleanliness, and area you live in.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	Different people are allergic to different dogs. A mixed breed could have any kind of coat so it isn't really a good idea to get one unless you spend a lot of time with it first to make sure it doesn't cause a reaction.|`|OFpl236faa	No that would not be a good cross for people with allergies. All dogs can get fleas, depends if you the owner do well to prevent fleas. Cross breeds are not generally good for allergies because there is no guarantee that they will have the right hair. I have heard that West Highland Terriers, Poodles and Wheaten Terriers are good for people who have allergies, but you should research any breed before adding it to your home.|`|INmPiwnMaa	Depends on how bad the allergies are. You can get a shampoo that will help. I have a Chi full and an asthmatic daughter allergic to dog dander and cat. She never reacts to my Chi, or my Dane for that matter. I have read that if you have small allergens around some one who is allergic can help them build up an immunity.     The best dogs to have are Poodles and any other known not to shed. dog allergies are caused by dander. So if you wash them and keep their skin healthy and Hair from shedding that will help in any case. This works for short coat, not as well for long. By short I mean Chihuahua boxer dane... Not Lab or rotie.|`|Z40E5jZcaa	It depends.  Does the dog have long hair, or short hair?    Also:  How much do they lick their fur?  Most of the time, the allergy is caused by pet dander OR a protein in the dogs saliva.    Long hair dogs tend to shed more, and since their fur is higher maintainance, they tend to lick it more, too.  The dried saliva stays on the shredded hair, and starts to "Chip" into small particles that will set you off.  These particles are circulated around the house as people walk through it, through the vents, etc.      Also, dogs with long fur are a bit difficult to bathe, and dander tends to build up on them more.  Bathing daily is a must.    Short hair dogs, while not totally hypoallergenic, tend not to set people off as bad.  They still lick their fur and they still have dander, but usually not as much as long hair dogs.    Wood floors are also preferable.  Carpet traps pet dander and hair, which is released into the air as people step on it.  Vacuuming daily is a MUST with carpets.  With wood floors, you may be able to get buy with vacuuming once a week.    Avoid leaving them outside for extended periods, as their fur may trap additional allergens, such as pollen.  If you're already having problems with dog allergies, the pollen will make it worst.    Take a benadryl if your allergies are giving you trouble.  Take 2 pills only if your allergies are really bothering you.      So in other words, Bathe your dogs, vacuum regularly, don't leave them outside too long, and take medicine when your allergies are bothering you.    If you bathe them regularly and use advantix (as directed by a vet), fleas should be a non-issue.  Advantix prevents fleas, ticks and mosquitoes from plaguing your dog.      I'm pretty sure I don't need to say this, but vaccinate them regularly.  If you suspect a reaction to a vaccine (Dog rubbing itself everywhere, rubbing face with paws, swollen eyes, pale gums, and vomiting), bring him to the vet IMMEDIATELY.  Even if you use an epipen you should still hurry him to a vet.  Be sure to tell him you used an epipen if you did.    May any pet you decide to get live long and stay healthy,    Ben|`|AA12202402	having a flea problem is mainly due to not protecting your animal and in turn you are the problem not the breed of dog.

All dogs have skin so all dogs have dander.  The more a dog sheds hair the more loose dander it will produce. Dogs fed poor diets will have dry skin and produce more dander.  All dogs are subject to cause allergic reactions.  Well fed, dogs with continual hair growth will produce less allergic reactions. So get a dog that has to be clips and groomed, feed it a good diet for its skin coat and take your allergy shots.    Terriers shed, chihuahua shed. So the answer to your question is NO.    The flea question would depend on how well the owner, keeps the dog, the house, the yard and the car  flea free.
TgNQAYyXaa	At 2 years old his behavior and personality is pretty much fully developed.  Neutering, at that age, would be UNLIKELY to change his behavior.      You will find though, that now he will bark at a higher pitch.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	Whoever said they calm down is wrong. Mine was about 2 when he had the Big Snip, and he hasn't changed one bit.  Still a big puppy, which is fine with us.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	Neutering reducing energy levels is a myth.     A dog calms down as he matures and gets older.   The behaviour that changes is that with less testosterone he should be less male aggressive. And likely less dominant.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	It takes a while for hormones to settle.    But neutering doesn't reduce energy levels.|`|A21SswSfaa	After a neuter a dog typically calms down, but not always. But the neutering should not mean an increase in energy. Not sleeping through the night isn't normal. You either own one bored dog or he's got something else going on. Try taking him for more walks and tiring him out mentally. If he doesn't start calming down you may want to take him to the vet and have him checked out.|`|DKKJLJkNaa	my dogs 2 and a halh and had his "balls" removed over a year ago and still humps stuffed animals and is very hyper.? maybe its a dog thing

8owlj2xHaa	I am so sick of the more maintenance answer, because its just not true.  What other maintenance is there to do on a saltwater tank?  I clean the glass and do water changes, test the water. I also have a skimmer to empty,but you have a filter to clean. I do not.  sounds pretty even to me so far.  What saltwater takes is....Knowledge and money. There is a lot more to know about fish care and behavior and water chemistry. It is also a lot more money than fresh water.   IT IS NOT MORE WORK>|`|w4DIPHf1aa	Franks right...    there pretty easy to take care of....    But ten times the money at least...    You could set up a freshwater tank for 50 bucks all in.    I wouldn't spend less than a thousand to set up a saltwater. Plus the beginnr tank size is 55 gallons.    Saltwater works backwards...the better you get the smaller the tank you can have.      good luck!!!|`|f00164c9621d2d6d56a42547a19606b9aa	Saltwater tanks require lots of maintance, and gets very expensive. If money isn't an issue, go for it. Freshwater tanks are much easier and best for beginners. Just remember if you go freshwater, goldfish and tropicals don't mix, and make sure you group your fish in their class.|`|vp0WdER8aa	freshwater is way more easier to care for. saltwater tanks require major maintainence and require really advanced test kits like alkanity, calcium all that stuff.  im not trying to make saltwater tanks look like a bad thing to recommend, in fact i wanted to get a saltwater fish one time but it requires alot of attention because something could easily go wrong and you need to be accurate with certain standards of cleaning it weekly.  i recommend the freshwater tanks because they are so much easier than salt water tanks    saltwater tanks you need to add salt while cleaning the tank    and freshwater just requires water conditioner, and water!    plus there are alot of beautiful freshwater fish out there in the petstores.       but if you still want a saltwater tank, make sure you get EVERYTHING required and do alot of research before even getting one fish.  same thing with freshwater, thats why most people own freshwater tanks.  take care :)
YEd9Q5KZaa	I think a hamster (or something similar) would be a good pet, if it's out of it's cage it will probably be in a ball (that it runs in), so it will be okay with your dog, and the cage wouldn't be a hassle to clean.  I personally wouldn't get a rabbit, I knew a family that had two rabbits and they chewed up all of the cords to their TV. However, that is not the reason I wouldn't get one. It seems like it could be a good pet for you.  I will never in my life get a bird, I hate them.    To get your parents to let you have one.. well of course let them know you want one, but for example if it's a hamster you could say that you'd keep the cage in your room and help pay for some of it's things like it's cage or toys or whatever works.|`|oGVWdnHraa	How about a rabbit? theyre great pets :D    http://www.petfinder.com|`|xk5XK6CPaa	Dog- To learn responsibitly, ect    Turtle- There actually really intresting!

They actually have a personality unlike many rodents, plus they are quite cute and non-threatening to parents.  They are fairly low maintenance and will let you know if they are low on food or water.

Generally, they're very affectionate also. Dogs tend to be more high energy and need regular walking and playing.     A parakeet or other type of small bid make surprisingly good companions. They can bond with owners more than a hamster or guinea pig, and provide plenty of entertainment. Some species, such as budgerigars, can learn cool tricks - like how to say human words. They can be loud, however.|`|uNRygGS2aa	Hi, fellow 13 year old! :)    For somebody in your situation, I would reccomend a bunny. They are pretty low maitnence and love to cuddle! All you have to do is clean its cage weekly and take it out to play about 3 times a week.    Tell them it will teach you responsibility.    I got a chinchilla for my 13th bday (PLEASE dont ask for one because they are very expensive, high maitnence, and usually dont like to cuddle) and my mom told me I had to take care of her. I thought I might be able to rat out of it for like a day or something, but I have done everything for my chin! Cleaned out her cage daily, gave her fresh food and water, played with her every day and let me tell you something... I have REALLY learned responsibility from her. I love her to pieces. I have also built a strong bond with her, she makes me laugh every day, and she looks to me for love and care. My parents havent done one thing for her yet. Not one thing.    Good luck!!

9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	You're looking for holey rock (also known as honeycomb stone or lace rock) and/or lava rock.    Try stone yards. These are places that sell rocks, gravel, sand, and so forth for construction and landscaping purposes. Look in the Yellow Pages under "Building Materials" and "Landscaping Supplies." They sell rocks by the pound (also by the truckload, but you probably don't want that much), and the kind you're looking for might cost anywhere from a few cents to a couple of dollars per pound, depending on the place and on the quality of the stone. Many of these places can deliver the stone (but may have a minimum amount, like one truck load), but you'll probably be happiest if you go there and pick out your own rocks. Don't worry if the rocks have dirt, grass, etc. on therm-- you can clean them with a pressure washer or even with a garden hose with a good spray nozzle.    Many aquarium shops also sell such rocks, but, due to their own economic realities, they generally have to charge a lot more for them.    You can also order holey rock from Internet sites, but this is not likely to be cheap, because the shipping charges will be very high. As everybody knows, rocks are very heavy.|`|m0e3a3gWaa	Gary is right, and he is the man.  I would be careful with the lava rock though.  It is very abrasive and can damage your fish.

That just isn't normal since puppies are moving around and standing on their little legs before their eyes are open.  Did you notice she was doing this before you purchased her?|`|26PPwzrWaa	Vet now.     And here is a good giant breed dog forum: http://www.bigdogsporch.com|`|4uI0dF0zaa	She is a 7 week old puppy.

She'll be alright!|`|dLhRrTlRaa	Is she still with her mother or has she been taken from her mother recently?  That could be an issue if she's been seperated from her mother at such a young age she may just be anxious or nervous.      How does she react when she walks or runs?  Do they appear to be wobbly then as well?    This could be the beginning signs of something more serious, and with our beloved great danes health issues if it is something serious you want to get it check out right away to head off any problems.      Other things to consider - how high is the protien in her food?  For Dane puppies it should not be over 24% as increases the chances of HOD and knuckling over of their ankles, they also get growing pain issues from their bones not growing at the same rate as their muscles if they aren't kept on a low protien diet until full grown and even then be careful.
xQtnTKCAaa	i agree with the first answer. i had a blue garter snake and they dont get big at all.     http://michaelcravens.com/sitebuildercon...|`|ZSWmOkE6aa	you will never find a snake that is under a foot when it is full grown. I would say get either a king, milk, or corn snake.|`|lWEWhyTtaa	Garter snaaaaaaaaaaake|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	You're going to have a hard time finding a snake that will stay smaller than a foot. I do however recommend the corn snake. They are great snakes for beginners, and don't get TOO big. They like to handled, and don't require as much care as some larger snakes. Google them! They also come in a bunch of different colours, and are easy to find. Of course, like any other pet, you must do your research to learn about this animals needs. Good luck!|`|u61yKsE3aa	You are going to have a hard time finding an easy snake to care for that is less than a foot however if you expand your size a little you could look in to sand boas.

Z40E5jZcaa	This may be an instinct that can be traced back to wolves, foxes, wild dogs and the like.  When watching my dogs circle before laying down, I notice that they sometimes pull their bed around, "Dig" the covers, etc..  It appears to be a "nesting Instinct".    It could also be a territorial thing.  When one of my dogs is trying to assemble her "nest" and get comfortable, she'll growl/snap at any dog that comes near her when she's doing this (She doesn't do it to people, because she knows we're dominant).  Eventually, the other dogs learned to avoid her when she's doing this.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	It is believed by some behaviourists that they spin as a result of their more "primal" days as a species. Just one of those natural instinct type behaviours that has been hardwired into them through the centuries.     Some believe it may be related to how a wolf would spin to look for any predators before laying down to rest.   Others believe it's a natural nesting procedure.|`|1bRRODd2aa	This is an instinctive behaviour.  All wild canines do this.  Some domestic dogs have retained the instinct.    The turn makes sure that there is nothing in the bed that can hurt them, and it helps to "make" the bed, creating a bowl in the grass or vegetation, that fits the dog's body which acts as a wind break and helps to keep the dog warm while it sleeps.|`|r8kRHyu7aa	i think it's something to do with excitement, why i'm not sure  happy theyre near you or something maybe?|`|Zyb2MENKaa	No one really knows why, but I'm guessing it's to get the lumps out of there bedding.

Some dogs just do it because they like it.  The longer it goes on the harder the habit is to break.  You need to clean up any faeces immediately, and if you see her going to eat any shout, "No" and offer her a treat, she should soon come to realise that leaving the poo gets her a treat instead.  l've been going through the same thing with my 5 month old pup, the treat trick seems to be working.  Although my pup only eats the poo of my eldest Lab, he likes to get it on its way out while it's steaming...yuck!!!!|`|LVDoQ1Kaaa	i would say she ate a little too much chocolate i would take her to the vet just to be on the safe side|`|JSwM1H4saa	I've been doing my research,and when a dog eats it's own crap feed it pineapples it makes the crap taste bad!!

A visit to the vet is always a good idea, but at PetCo or some such store are always good multivitamins to give your dog.  They make a lot of them like treats, so your dog won't even know.|`|rumYVkDsaa	No eating poo is something you have to train her not to do. A dog doesnt truley digest all of the food so the crap smells like dog food and they eat it. You just have to tell your dog no and watch it whn it poos.

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Goldfish are best in Goldfish-only tanks. 2 in a 45 is fairly well stocked as it is with adult sizes considered.    Leave your tank as-is.    Most "eel" like fish are tropical. Bar Dojo Loaches which prefer more current in their tank than Goldfish so I wouldn't really recommend them together.|`|WebaFPgsaa	All I can think of is different breeds of goldfish.

RyU2o8Tqaa	you should be ok... kelpies have herding instinct and should have low prey drive... my aunty had a kelpie/border x and it used to sort of hypnotise the chickens by staring and them.. was weird|`|lhOd2hvXaa	A Kelpie is a herding breed. If there are free-range chickens in the yard that hs has access to, they will (at the very least) be used for herding practice.    You need to either create separate areas for the dog to run (away from the area the birds free range) or you need to be outside with him on lead when he is outside.    Good Luck!|`|fmHHcFd5aa	if its in his nature then you cant do anything. we had 2 boxers that always went after our chickens, one out of viciousness looking for a snack, one just wanted to play. The most you can do is keep them separated and maybe have a fenced in area just for the dog or a running line attached to a harness so he can run around but away from the chickens. you really cant train your dog and know it will be bombproof. we had a dog as well that was unpredictable. sometimes they didnt attack sometimes they did. its hard to say. I would keep them separated so no mishaps happen.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I had the same problem. I have free range chickens. I have 2 prey driven Dachshunds. The answer is a good fenced to keep your dog in.
TWfDAYK4aa	I use Advantix on my dogs, it also helps with ticks, as well as the fleas.  I know of two people who have always used Frontline.  Now Frontline is no longer working for them, like the fleas have developed an immunity to it.  I haven't yet encountered that problem with the Advantix.  So, I would highly recommend it or Advantage, basically the same thing, only the one covers ticks too.|`|W0ZQQK4taa	We use Zodiac, but I am not sure whether it is good or not. :\    But, I think that Frontline is the best. :D|`|eDySIDPQaa	A lot of dogs are getting an immunity to Frontline Plus, several people in my dog club have stopped using it, as the fleas seem to enjoy it now..

I do not use flea meds, I don't like them at all...seems they tend to fade and do not really work too long, some dogs get sick from them or get an immunity to them.    I only give my dogs   Brewer's Yeast Tablets with Garlic, have not used flea treatments in over 5 yrs...they never have fleas or ticks, and their skin and coats are fab.......I get them at Pets Mart    but whatever works best, you should use.....I prefer no meds....|`|syT3XUAraa	All of them are basically the same, but you could use Comfortis.

adPO2SVraa	theres lots of plants that are very hardy and can be kept in the same temperature as goldfish, such as: Anubias-slow growing but very hardy,  elodea(anacharis)-extremely hardy and does'nt need co2, java moss-very hardy and can be sprinkled on anything, java fern-hardy but needs to be tied on driftwood as it doesnt do well in gravel, giant vallisneria-hardy plant that grows big and onion plant- remember to keep the bulb above the gravel when planting.  All these plants are hardy, can stand extreme temperatures and doesnt need fertilizer or co2.  hope i helped, good luck :D|`|Y43nptlvaa	Moss is pretty good|`|NoOM7eZnaa	Moss is good, but I'd avoid things with broad leaves, goldfish LOVE to snack on plants.
aCqSF87Raa	There won't be a "quick" way to make money for a dog. Period. The only way to make a decent amount is to get an actual job where you work to be paid by the hour. Between what you need to do for your horse and pony, school, etc... you won't be working long hours. In fact, depending on your age, it's illegal to work past a certain amount (depending on where you live.)    It'll take several months - you need to save money for the dog ($150-$1500), it's initial supplies ($200), first vet check ($200). And there will be monthly fees ($150), and the possibility of an emergency (can run over a grand.)    So i would examine your schedule then try to find a place where you can get paid by the hour (instead of by the job.) A place where you will be able to work for a looong time to come...|`|JOz2Zl26aa	ebay buy low and sell high u make a killing doing that|`|nPuZVGFRaa	Bake sale, lemonade stand, more babysitting.

Puppies get expensive with the shots, spaying or neutering. Wait till you get older, when you are financially ready to care for a dog.    Oh, your thirteen, ok then your parents will obviously help out financially with the dog.  then maybe you can do a dog walking service in your neighborhood, and charge $10 a week, and walk the dogs 15-30 minutes a day.

AA12083992	That behavior is called coprophagy and many dogs do it. It could signal a vitamin deficiency in your dogs diet. Are you feeding a food with fillers (corn, wheat, animal by products) instead of a good quality food?                                                                                                            It could also go back to the fact that our dogs ancestors learned to eat stool to keep their dens clean. Even our modern day dogs eat their pups feces to keep the whelping box clean.                                                                                                  Finally the dog might just be bored and looking for something to do or attention. She did get attention, right?   You can try switching to a higher quality food. One that has meat (not meal) as a first ingredient and no corn, wheat or animal by products. Wellness, Innova and Merrick are in that group.   Put the cat box where the dog can not get to it, maybe use a baby gate for the room the litter box is in.     CAUSES OF COPROPHAGY  The exact causes of the habit are unknown, but several ones have been described. There appears to be some connection between excessive coprophagy and nutritional deficiencies, stress, boredom, unsanitary rearing conditions, and restrictive housing. Overly restrictive or isolatory confinement has been linked to a higher incidence of coprophagy in dogs. Dogs kept in kennels or basements are more likely to engage in the habit than dogs kept in close contact with people. Eating non-food materials (pica) has also been reported similarly increased among dogs housed under restrictive conditions, suggesting that both coprophagy and pica may be influenced by environmental stress.A common assumption holds that coprophagy is related to some sort of nutritional problem or deficiency. The theories generally focus on one of two possibilities: (1) coprophagy is a search for nutrients lacking in a dog's diet or (2) the habit is motivated to consume undigested nutrients passed into the feces. Vitamin B12 and other B-complex vitamin deficiencies have been frequently implicated.    In one study, rapid control of coprophagy was achieved by increasing the ration's protein and fat content, reducing the amount of carbohydrates, and supplementing with brewer's yeast. Another obvious nutritional possibility to consider, and one perhaps more directly linked with a nutritional function, is that coprophagous dogs may simply be harvesting undigested food passed in the feces.Enzyme Conservation  Besides undigested food and other nutrients, feces is a rich source of digestive enzymes and bacteria. Whether or not the ingestion of alimentary bacteria is of benefit to dogs is not known, but some evidence suggests that digestive enzymes may play a role in the control of coprophagy. Many veterinarians and dog trainers report anecdotal success when a meat tenderizer containing papain (a proteolytic enzyme) is added to the coprophagous dog's diet. In one study 4 of the 9 dogs treated with a plant-based enzyme supplement responded favorably to the therapy. http://www.gopetsamerica.com/dog-health/...|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	Because it is in her reach, put the litter box in a high place, or in a closed off area like a closet or a pantry.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Only if you have a room that you can put a gate across so the cat can jump over but the dog can't,or you might want to spray some Bitter Apple sold at the pet store onto the litter,my daughter did this and seemed to work|`|s23w0I3Baa	i have heard some dogs do it because of a lack of a certain mineral or something, i think they just do it because its stinky kitty pooh. my cat's litter box is down in the basement and he is trained to use a "doggy" door to get down there and therefore keeps the dogs out of it.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	We keep our litter boxes in a room with a gate at the door.  That way our dogs can'[t get in there and snack when we're not looking.|`|QdQcAHqaaa	Cats are obligate carnivores, so their food and consequently their poo is mostly protein.  Dogs go for protein-rich poo because they love the taste.  They also don't know that eating poo is wrong because mother dogs will often eat the poo in the den to keep the area clean.      What you need to do is a) put a lid over the litter box or b) move the litter box to an area that is accessible only to the cat (maybe behind a door with a cat door cut into it) since you can't reduce the amount of protein in your cat's diet.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Kitty Tootsie Rolls!!

gjD8pndjaa	Police dogs are extremely specific dogs, in terms of breeding.  Its unlikely that ordinary dogs will be qualified    If this is something you are very interested in, however, you can look into working under an established police dog breeder/trainer and learn from their experience|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	No one is going to buy your unregistered dogs.  What would even make you think such a thing????    If you have to ask questions, here, you have NO business breeding.  You do know of course that your dogs would first of all need all of their health and genetic testing done, at about $1000.00 per dog.      SPAY AND NEUTER.  PLEASE DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT ADDING MORE UNWANTED DOGS TO THIS WORLD, WHEN MILLIONS ARE EUTHANIZED IN SHELTERS EACH YEAR.    I'm not positive, but about 99% sure that the police and military have their own sources for their dogs.  Highly unlikely that they'd even buy dugs from backyard breeders.      AGAIN, SPAY AND NEUTER.|`|JtZfTiEEaa	The police and military have sources that they purchase from.  They will not purchse a dog simply because they are "lovely German Shepherds".  They look for dogs from strong working lines, with certain temperaments and structure.  These dogs generally are not sold directly to the police or military, but to the specific training agency that trains the dogs.  They also want more than "lovely German Shepherds".  They have to fit certain requirements.  Even if one of these organizations was interested in ANY of your dogs, you might have AT BEST 1 dog that fit their strict requirements.  But, unless you have strong working drives in your 2 "lovely German Shepherds", chances are greater that you'll have ZERO dogs that would be a good fit for either organization.|`|WbRhr0OYaa	No don't breed. You will be adding to hundreds of puppies that are dying because of overpopulation. Even if you don't sell to the public you will be murdering innocent puppies already born. MOST police/military have kennels where specific dogs are bred with others to produce triats they want. While not all places do have these kennels most of them do and they will not buy from you.     Please spay/neuter your dogs so you don't kill innocent animals.|`|TjHIggZHaa	As many here have said, these dogs require strong drives. Not many pups will qualify even if both parents do.    Check out Leeburg.com for more information.|`|Xa9esMTEaa	LMMFAO!!!!! You think you can breed your dogs and put the pups in police homes because why again? And your dogs (at least one) isn't registered or you wouldn't have asked about it in the first place huh? It takes a lot more experience and money (and dogs way better than what you have) to do what you want to do. Police dogs are working line German Shepherds, not show dogs, and definitely not American bred dogs you got out of the Sunday newspaper. They're expensive, in the ballpark of around $20,000 for an established top stud, and 3-5 thousand for a brood b**** of suitable age. Anyway, before I get angry and become rude I have 1 word for you: Research.    Btw, if I came across as over the top, people like this + Police Departments who're just as ignorant as breeders like this = Police officers getting killed in the line of duty for trusting their life to dogs not capable of the work.|`|6ae0aSbvaa	I'm not exactly sure how to answer this question.  Some of the answers here are down right cruel.  I don't want to be like that, so I'll answer your question this way.  I honestly would advise against it.    You are obviously a dog lover and know that you have a couple of special animals.  The dogs don''t have to be registered first of all- to answer your question, but there are literally countless outfits out there that are doing the same thing.  Just a few of them are:      http://www.adlerhorst.com/  http://www.ventosakennel.com/tactical_tr...  http://www.energidogs.com    My unit, (I'm sure others have also) has used each of these vendors several times over the years, the most recent being energi.  Most vendors go straight to their contacts in Europe for dogs where most of the breeding takes place.  There is a minority that breeds specifically for police work.  The majority of dogs, are dogs trained in some sort of sport such as KNPV, Schutzhund, French Ring, etc. then are sold to these vendors who in turn sell them to awaiting police agencies.  Now breeding specifically for police work is a whole 'nother ball game.  There is so much involved that I can't even begin to break it down for you because frankly I don't even understand it.  What I can tell you is that they separate the dogs from the mother and it's litter mates as soon as 5 weeks of age to begin puppy training.  Sometimes whole litters are washed out because they arent the right dogs.  But don't take my word for it, Steve Dean is the expert on this.  He is retired from the London Met Police Department, and is currently in charge of their breeding program; very interesting to talk to.  I met Steve at the H.I.T.S. Seminar (sponsored by http://policek9magazine.com/) last year and spoke with him extensivley about this.  I strongly recommend you contact him for more information if you want to pursue your breeding program.  His web site is http://www.workingdoghandler.com/.  Or email him: steve@workingdoghandler.com      Best of luck to you and your dogs.|`|qioH81tiaa	If you have to ask here, you don't have the dogs for it.    Registration is nothing for true working dogs - temperament and structure is.  And I can tell you, there is less than a 0.001% chance your dogs are the right ones for this type of work, sorry.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Even when dogs are bred from very well known working lines, 99% of dogs that enter training are cut because they don't have what it takes to be a police dog.....so dogs coming from obscure lines have negative chance of actually being a police dog. Police dogs have incredibly strong drives and are far more than just lovely German Shepherds.   Just get your dogs spayed and neutered. It's apparent that you really don't know much about breeding or how to produce pups with proper temperament and structure.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	The police already have specific german shepherds that are bred, with specific characteristics and traits. Your dogs arent something the police want|`|OFpl236faa	Usually dogs that are used for military or police work are imported from other countries. They also use certain breeders I think. They most likely are registered also. They require a lot of their dogs and they have to have behavioral traits, train ability and the right kind of drive.
BVwDoV81aa	I suggest you get in the habit of doing it as you go as dogs tend to run over the poo and it gets on their paws (then into your house) and its also a germ hazard and very quickly smells.  Its amazing how quickly even a couple of days worth looks, much cleaner and easier to do each time.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	3 to 4 times a week|`|FDZNJXxcaa	Depends on how poopy you want your yard.

So I get it done before it gets worse and so I won't have to see poo or step in it.

That's what i do...    If you leave it for later someone could step in it or your dog could eat it. If you don't pick up on walks, then another dog could eat your dog's poop and THAT is how worms are transferred.     If no one ever goes in your yard and you KNOW your dog won't eat it (or you don't care if they do) then you could get away with picking it up three times a day or less (depending on how often your dog poops.)

f714ef26ad8f0b92d25c68a6b4041d5daa	I have a Drinkwell, and my cat LOVES it.  He never wanted to drink from his bowl (even though the water was always clean and fresh), but he loved drinking from a running faucet.  So I figured the Drinkwell would be a good solution since I wasn't always available to turn the water on for him.    If you decide to buy your cat a fountain, check on eBay for good prices on both the fountain and the filters (you don't have to use a filter, but it's supposed to keep the water fresher).  You should also buy the three-brush cleaning kit to make cleaning it easier.    Pros:  Encourages cats to drink more water, which is good for them.    Cons:  You should take it apart once a week to clean it.  It only takes about 10 minutes, but it's kind of a tedious process.|`|YAPYO7L8aa	I have a couple different kinds. The one had water running down a slide type thing. It was weak and clogged up often. But the cats loved it. But the motor finally quit. Now I have another kind that water does NOT run down. Instead it has a long hose underneath the water and it bubbles. The cats are afraid of it. What I really want is one that the water runs down into the bowl (not down the side).

The Canadian Horse or Le Cheval Canadien originated from horses sent to Quebec by King Louis XIV in the late 1600's.  These horses, the best from the King's stable, were of French Norman, Breton, Arab, Andalusian and Spanish Barb descent.       Under conditions of hard use, sparse feed, and extreme weather conditions, the Canadian eventually developed into the easy keeping and hardy animals that they are today.  It is said that the Canadian is capable of generating "more power per hundred pounds of body weight than horses of any other breed."  Traits such as these earned the Canadian their nickname "The Little Iron Horse".         One of the few breeds to be developed and granted breed status in Canada, the Canadian Horse registry and stud book was first formed in 1886.  The Canadian Horse Breed Registry is now administered by the Canadian Livestock Records Corporation.         The Canadian Horse was influential in developing other North American horse breeds such as the Morgan, Tennessee Walker, Missouri Fox Trotter, Standardbred, and the Saddlebred.         The Canadian Horse typically stands 14-16hh.  Most commonly black, they may also be chestnut, brown or bay.  They are recognizable by their finely chiseled heads, arched necks, and long, thick, and often wavy tails and manes.  They have sturdy legs with good bone, and have exceptionally hard, strong feet.  They are renowned for their kind, sociable natures, intelligence and willingness to please.      Good natured and truly versatile, the Canadian can be found doing almost any type of equine descipline.  Perhaps best known for their driving ability, Canadian Horses have won many prestigious driving awards including the 1987 North American Pleasure Driving Championship, the 1991 Grand Champion Whip at the Canadian Carriage Driving Classic, the Presentation Award at the 1997 Pairs Driving Championship, the Limit Preliminary Division at the 1997 High Country CDE, the 1998 Preliminary Single Division at Gladstone, and the 1998 Advanced Single Horse Championship at Fair Hill.         Their calmness, hard working nature and people oriented personality makes the Canadian Horse ideal for use in the tourism industry.  They can be found working at Upper Canada Village, African Lion Safari, Black Creek Pioneer Village, Ross Farm Museum, Fortress of Louisbourg, Colonial Williamsburg, Heritage Park, and the Cardston Remington Carriage Museum.  Canadians are also used by the Montreal Mounted Police, Calgary City Police, and can be found pulling the Caleches of Montreal and Quebec City.         Whatever the interest...Dressage, Hunter Jumper, Eventing, Endurance, Trail, Packing, Ranch Work, Mounted Patrol, Logging, Carriage Driving, Combined Driving, Wagon Rides.....There's a Canadian for Everyone!     I could not find anything re: the log sorry|`|vow5ULxTaa	Tennessee Walkers -  Calm, sweet yet willing to work when needed and by no means are lazy.  From young to old they are very soulful animals you can walk out to the barn and just sit there stroking them and really feel like they are looking deep inside you and trying to find whats hurting you and make it better.      The next part thats great about them is that they are so smooth. there gaits are effortless and you feel like you are riding a cloud.      And lastly, the TWH is the most versatile horse ive ever met.  Right now one of my TWH's can barrel race then on a dime switch to a dressage routine then go back to reining then to jumping etc. THese horses can do anything and are willing to do anything.  This is why i love the TWH.    http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:58_p...  http://inthenightfarm.blogspot.com/2008/...|`|y8HyP1bzaa	Thoroughbreds.  They are highly intelligent, and they have a great work ethic.  There is no breed more rewarding to work with!    And I don't know the second question.

FewhKlx9aa	Yes they do and yours seem to be showing it.If you were in danger you would be amazed at what you dog would do,so lots of hugs and kisses|`|mfXDUkRYaa	I think so, whatever 'love' is. Even humans can't fully describe the emotion so I don't see how anyone can say dogs can't possibly feel it.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Sounds like she loves you. My dogs like to snuggle in the evening and watch TV with us. They aren't kissy, just happy faces and tails wagging. Unhappy dogs would not snuggle and try to kiss you.|`|7c000cf444eb1024a5936f1c7f912a15aa	Dogs do love but they do not need as much as we do. Just to be near you and with is the world to them. Like people all dogs have distinct personalities. My yellow Lab is the biggest snuggler and has to be right next to me at all times. He has to always know where I am and be able to touch me. However my mom's Pit Bull loves my mom but does not need to be with her, he will go stay with other people in the house and he can be in different rooms. Dogs love by unconditonal love and attention and all you have to do is love them back, care for them and be kind. I am sure your dog loves you very much and if she did not she would want nothing to do with you at all.|`|UlBryfIoaa	You should know if your dog loves you. They can't say it but its something you can just feel. Do they follow you around the house? When you sit down does she sit down by you?     And not all dogs are like some. Some are very independent and show no affection.|`|4ba573d10043e0b2f1d30e9ba0bb3383aa	My dog loves me so much! She is a doxie and she'll sit on my lap and stare me right in the face and everyone around us can see the look she gives me and her dad. We aren't sure how we can tell, maybe it's like when my hubby and I look at eachother and can tell without words how much we love one another, maybe not but I could/would never question wether or not my little fat girl loves us. Your dog loves you!|`|3wJGXfkKaa	Of course she loves you, mine use to do the same thing and I miss it so much.  He would look up at me with those puppy eyes and nug my hand when he wanted to be petted when I would stop.  I miss him terribily cherish every moment.|`|6HMgT5LCaa	No. She loves you.    Obviously, do you see strange dogs come up  to you and lick your face, no a lot of the time  they want to bite your face off. Dogs do share  affection and love.    :]]
pc7ZjexJaa	play with her  take her for walks  give her attention|`|oGVWdnHraa	Get a puppy :) Its known that when older dogs start to slow down, and you introduce them to a puppy it can help to rejuvinate them :D but it can also have the opposite effect.....so maybe intro to another dog first to see how she feels :)|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	Take the dogs on walks,change the food (if itis not on good food)|`|FewhKlx9aa	You can't,it happens to the best of us and this is part of the aging process..|`|AA12377116	All of the above and, a new puppy wouldn't hurt her spirits at all.

She also might have slowed down because her joints and muscles ache. Ask your vet to check her out for other reasons too when you take her in.

tFbdkxyIaa	vulture|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	That would be a cockatoo, especially an Umbrella Cockatoo.  They are like little cuddly toddlers.  But I'll warn you, that also goes for their tantrums and whininess.  If you aren't paying enough attention to them (and they need A LOT), they will let you know with loud screeching and anxious behavior like feather-pulling.  They are worth the effort if you have the time to devote to them, otherwise get a cockatiel.  They are cuddly and much lower maintenance.    EDIT:  Wow, why are there so many dumb answers in the Bird section?  Who are these people?|`|VSCYTZ38aa	Birds generally aren't cuddly creatures|`|e8urANFTaa	ahaha|`|ChuhyvEaaa	An emu  http://www.olegvolk.net/olegv/north/emu.... ....that's why|`|047IPSovaa	Ravens are very cuddly|`|AA11562326	Birds are delicate; they are built light so they can fly.

I have many birds and my cockatoo is the cuddliest. Now you have to trade off talking for a good cuddle. Yes cockatoos do talk but they are pretty limited . I go to lots of bird shows and I'm more than sure most good breeders would give you the same answer. Good Luck|`|2YowgtIJaa	umm well ummm there are no cuddly birds but my favorite birds are cardinals but you can have them as pets.... so go to you pet shop and see witch bird you like best and buy it a cage you don't want it pooping on you..... lol  xD|`|DZCFD0p2aa	A baby Penguin|`|LkdZPgvjaa	I would say cockatoos... but this is a double-edged sword.  They are also the most dependent and will make YOU their one and only interest, demanding that you feel the same. If you should step out of the room for instance, you'll hear about it... so will your neighbors and anyone within 50 feet.  Of course, no one can handle being the only reason to live, I think cockatoos are much better left to bond with one another in the wild.  Cockatiels can be sweet, lover birds - I have one now who just really wants to be my bird and will rub his little head on my chin and just want to be with me.  I've also had 2 green cheek conures at different times and they were both really very sweet little birds.  It really depends on the bird... it's been my experience tho' that young birds are more of the cuddly ones but they can grow out of it.|`|nJezM2aMaa	A cockatoo|`|faFDF9LFaa	Clearly a chicken or a duck!  Maybe not the cutest but definitely the easiest to tame.|`|DO3zDMataa	there really is no cuddle bird there are know to peck it is norm. but i suggest you to go to your local pet store and ask them. mainly find a bird dealer. i know one in bellflower,ca, called pottsies.great birds and trainers. the owner is very nice and knows birds. but i did have a miniture parrot and he was tame. try it out.|`|AcgDcQG0aa	Doves (or pigeons) are symbols of peace.  And they do make good pets.  Unlike most other birds, pigeons can fly outside on their own and  later come back to you.|`|coj54cacaa	Our umbrella cockatoo is more cuddly than most dogs! But they are quite expensive though ($900 and up)|`|PPBP6AGDaa	Birds are individuals so it depends on the bird, but generally birds are not cuddly. I know people are going to say 'Cockatoo!' but please do a lot of research, the commitment a Cockatoo needs is insane - check out mytoos.com...personally I probably couldn't handle a Cockatoo.    An Ecletus maybe - I'm not sure because I don't have experience with them but I've heard they are great birds. Good luck whatever you decide.|`|AyOM41obaa	what ever you do dont get it at petsmart...       http://www.petsmartcruelty.com/ ......thats why its just cruel..|`|91bhiXTVaa	I'd go with a small goose breed or a large duck breed , raised from hatchlings.  The larger size makes them more resistant to breakage from snuggling and they bond with the person that raises them.  Ducks will tolerate a minute or two of snuggling as adults before they want to escape, I don't know if geese tolerate it any easier.  But they're quite happy sitting in your lap.|`|p3aC2oe2aa	Silkie|`|cfblRvE3aa	the most cuddly Type of bird is a cockatoo they love to be held and rarely bite if you bye young.

RTINiCkbaa	My cat does that too!   He is also a male, I have read that it normal social behavior when a male cat is accustomed to his owner. I assume he cleans you and follows u around everywhere.  So, congrats, u are ur cat's BFF!|`|zeTGmB3faa	Kittens have not yet learned to control the claws and draw them in when appropriate. That is most likely why you got those scratches. If those are soft bites, he is just playing or tying to direct you to keep scratching his head.|`|8OoKYHN7aa	I also have a male cat and he does the same thing to me !! i think u just have a playful and he may calm done soon.|`|XPB6Ogj0aa	This is normal, especially in younger cats.  If by biting you mean that he doesn't break the skin, just kind of chews with his teeth.  Cats, especially kittens, get over stimulated and they do gnawing.  Just pull back for a few second and let his catch his breath.  He will calm down.|`|i1clehddaa	it sounds to me like its just playfull, listen for growling if there's no growling, its just being a cat.|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	"Normal" is a very subjective term. Especially when it comes to cats! :)  However, it is not abnormal, and cats do that.

dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	It all depends on the cats...I have four cats and showing you care is the only way I can think off. They respond to compassion and affection just like any thing. Making sure they have what they need (water, food, shelter, entertainment and pat on the head). The only cat the I've come across that won't have anything to do with me is our next door neighbor's cat. She just isn't a people cat, more of a loner I'm guessing. Our outdoor cat was a stray. We provided food, water and shelter and she is the most lovable cat. If you come across a cat that is aggressive, steer clear. There is no need to torment it by trying to be it's friend. Cats will be cats.     Dogs think they're human. Cats think they're God.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Cats are very very independent and will come to you on heir terms so do not chase it or pick it up al the time it will come to you and like you if you are calm and relaxed.Rubbing up against you has nothing to do with affection it is marking its scent on you so it is saying you are mine and l can recognize you by smell.Try and get some catnip they will kill for this.The other method is they love cheese  bits.The cat wil love its master or mistress in its own way but it is not like a dog it is far too aloof and independent .If you feed the cat always and no-one else it will  bond with yu and come to you More often|`|K97esxDsaa	Cats generally will gravitate toward people who are quiet and calm. It won't help to get in the cat's face or mess with it if it doesn't want to be played with.    If the cat seems playful, you may be able to attract it with a shiny or dangly toy.|`|MqYfsYd0aa	feed them.  pet them.  scoop their poop.  all should be good!|`|SUs4rN49aa	I don't know what it is, but cats always seem to like me which is good, because I like them too! When you are around a cat that you don't know very well, you just have to let it approach you, you can't run up to it and start petting it like crazy, you have to earn its trust and respect first! You just have to be calm and patient.|`|YAPYO7L8aa	Some catnip on your clothes can't hurt! Plus if they smell other cats on you.... that gets them interested too. Be gentle, and patient.

6SeWCfUfaa	I have to giggle at all the people saying your dog will be tired and groggy for a day or two.  I've had 3 male dogs in my life and every single one of them acted like nothing had happened when they were neutered.    I brought all of them home thinking they'd be tired and all that ... I had to enforce low activity on all of them for a day or two lol.    Ok, not ALL dogs will respond this way, but many do.|`|TJGje2blaa	If he's young, only a few days, but you will need to stop him from jumping up any.  It's a little rougher for an older dog.  He may not eat much for a day or so, but make sure you keep the water down for him.  Then, keep your distance & let him heal.    Let him come around, on his own.  Give him quietness & a place to himself.  If you have any children, make them leave him alone until he's darn good & ready to play.       Don't let him chew on his stitches, either, or you'll have to take him back in.    If you're afraid he'll try to do this, ask the Vet about that special collar you can keep on him, to stop him from doing so.|`|VLlyZKYYaa	usually almost immediately...say, 24 hours. when mine was neutered he was very groggy when i picked him up. by the next morning he was a lot better and started to play some, but i made an effort not to go him too excited or push him. it really didn't set him back much, just 1 day really. i took him back a week later and had the stitches removed and his collar was taken off and that was that. be sure to keep his collar on him. he will get used to it. also, it's a good idea to bath him before so you won't have a dirty dog laying around the house for a week. you can't bath him with stitches. make sure to give him his medicine on time too.|`|vPde97E2aa	Still gorked from the anesthesia  that night & NORMAL & 99% healed the day after!!  Castration is NOTHING to freak about.|`|gjD8pndjaa	He'll be drugged out for the next couple of days.  His personality will start be back to normal once you stop giving pain killers, but he'll still have to take it easy for a while so he doesn't hurt anything.  Your vet will give you specific instructions|`|qUcCWuT4aa	um when my dog got castrated he was just sleepy till the next day   you just really have to be careful not to tear the stitches he should be fine by the next day|`|3zv2bbolaa	He will be sore and tired, so let him rest in a quiet, out of the way place. They may send him home with an e-collar to prevent him from licking or chewing at the wound for a few days.     Limit his exercise for a few days and he should be back to new in about 48 hours give or take a day. Sometimes male dogs experience a testosterone surge immediately after neutering, so don't be surprised if he acts a little more masculine, even showing some signs of dog aggression for a few days. Once the last of the hormone leaves his system, he will be back to his old self.|`|Bw18seFqaa	he will be groggy when you bring him home.  He will still have the anasthesia in his system.. just let him sleep it off.  The vet will send you home with a care sheet that tells you what to expect, how to care for him, and what to look for.    Most boys are up and about the next day as if nothing happened.. however dont be surprised if he's a little tired or sore for a few days afterwards either.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	It's really a very easy surgery - the surgery itself only takes about 15 minutes to complete. He will be groggy, possibly whiny and not inclined to eat for a day or so and then he'll be back to his normal self.  You need to watch to make sure he leaves his sutures alone and that the incision does not get hot or red looking - a sign of infection.  Sutures come out at 10 days and that's it.  They recover very fast typically.|`|OE4UYtWgaa	In two or three days he'll be back to his normal self.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	My sisters great dane was really drugged up the first day and by about the 3rd day was completely back to normal. She had to calm her down because she was too hyper and messing up the stitches.|`|Zyb2MENKaa	It might take him a few weeks to recover. He will be pretty sleepy and will be a little sore around the surgery area. Be sure that he doesn't run around too much or he could tear out his stiching. I haven't had a dog nuetered, but I have had a dog spayed and a cat nuetered. This is how they both reacted to their surgeries.

The more they eat the healthier the turtle.    **** If these are hatchlings a 1 1/2  they may need to have their live food half dead by leaving the fish out of water for a few minutes (10minutes) and put in the tank. That way the baby can get the meat he needs and the fish cant out run the baby turtle.  Plus some leafy green and vitamin A fruits cut up a few times a week. Swollen cloudy eyes comes from lack of Vitamin A. Which we all need for good eyes.     Plus I also feed dried cubed blood worms or tubiflex worms or pellets at least 5 times a week for my five..  They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them un the pond, also meal worms.  As they get older they can have  snails, crickets, flies, crayfish, small frogs, slugs, tadpoles ,dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them) any other leafy greens will do for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples, remember cut up in small pieces..  .  These turtles in captivity do not hibernate their eating may slow down some but they will not hibernate. They cannot hear or see well so they feel you coming by the vibrations each foot step take.   TOSS in a bird cuttle bone in the water for calcium that will promote better shell growth, it will dissolve real slow and if they eat it thats fine!!
37TowRL7aa	1.  get the 5 gallon filter and you will be fine    2. i like riley and u do to, lol.  here are some good ones....  ricky, cleo, lola, stewy, and zeeloe|`|xXGNbsTfaa	lizzie...and the tank should be fine|`|kA14rQvXaa	they start out small but get pretty big.|`|NoOM7eZnaa	1. I'd go with two. it generally depends on the type of the fish. If it's a fancy variety, you need 15 gallons for the first one and 10 gallons for every additional one. Three is just slliiiightly overstocked for your tank.    2. I asked this a little bit ago, go check out my prev. questions, someone left a lot of different types of names. :)|`|AhO0Uoppaa	i would put two fish in, rule is 10 gallon minimum per fish. 29 gallon tank would be ok for 3 fish, but two fish would have a perfect enviroment in a 29 gallon tank. Just my opinion, just remember those fish could potentially grow to10inches or bigger
GdBG4PGYaa	Jumping spiders are not poisonous (as far as I know, pretty sure). He will be fine. He is a predator. Cats eat snakes, spiders, mice (rats), birds, etc. :) One little spider will not hurt him.      He just ate a spider, I'm glad your proud of him, because he did a good thing. Give him a kiss for me, and tell him good boy.      Hope I helped!       P.S. Love this part, "My 15 week old kitten just caught his first spider - then he ate it." Haha, "then he ate it." :)|`|qRvEFP9Jaa	no no no its instinct it will be okay i mean mine 8 a snake about at the same age!!! lol|`|chSN1wACaa	He should be just fine :)|`|b50de6e63c61b84e8a7ee07f92ab42b5aa	What a good boy! No, be proud of him! Even if he ate 10 black widows, the venom in the spiders is broken down by kitty's immune system and does not affect him at all unless he was bitten by them and invenomated (which is very very rare!). In the wild, cats eat snakes, birds (sometimes with diseases), rodents (sometimes with diseases or that have recently ingested rat poison), spiders (venomous or not), and all kinds of other icky critters and end up just fine. Your little man is going to be just fine and I a, very proud of him (i HATE spiders too!) WHen my kitty ate his first spider, I threw him a "Killed my first spider" party!|`|imezk2l5aa	I wouldent worry imagine all the the things it catches and eats when your not around. a spider (unless bigger then a cookie) should be the least of your worrys|`|Pi3WxX1Qaa	Well.....if the spider was poisonous, it is bad|`|IkgVSPnKaa	Isn't that what we're paying our cats for, to catch insects?  Sounds like your kitten is off to a good start.|`|AA10091923	Remember---cats are predators naturally...so No, it wont hurt her to eat a spider, a mouse, or a bird....this is just what they do naturally.    If you want to keep down the amount of wild creatures your cat stalks, kills and eats...then it would best to keep the cat indoors as much as possible...yes, spiders do come in, but not as often as finding them outside in bushes etc.    good luck...  :)  gflad to hear she is normal|`|Lalr2Jayaa	Even if it is a poisonous spider, the amount will be so minute that your cat's immune system should handle it just fine. I wouldn't stress it at all, cats are predators.

n4pNNcGfaa	Use a frozen whole chicken.      But first, teach him to retrieve a non-tasty object and work on "drop it."  It's important for him to let go of something, even something delicious, just because you said so.  He should drop a steak if you tell him to.  If he isn't there yet, then it is too soon to be working on retrieving with meat.  Use a bumper instead.  You'll be too far away during a retrieve to catch and correct a mistake like eating the object he's supposed to be retrieving.
XB0UpJsLaa	I LOVE both styles. English riding is close contact, and soo much more comfortable for jumping. But western riding is so fun and good for practicing hand gallops and contesting. I started out riding in only english, but i felt kinda the same as you, I really wanted to try western. Now I compete in both, and I am actually doing really good in western ( i do horsemanship(I was the high-point winner in this for 4-H), pleasure, barrels, and poles) Don't let any one tell you western is soo easy cuz there's a saddle horn & everything...it's not, if your a real rider you wouldnt be using the horn the whole time, plus you have to have good balance to sit the trot. But both english and western r equally hard...But I Love them both :D  You should definitly try it!! Good-Luck|`|5L5GQYFXaa	I got the western bug from my dad.. my mom rode english and my dad rode western western is just filled with so much more excitment the rush of galloping at 70 miles per hour just exhilerating|`|LAXxaxAZaa	I think it depends more on the discipline, really.    I like some English disciplines, such as dressage, eventing, and show jumping. I like some Western disciplines, such as cutting and reining.    But there are some English disciplines I don't like, such as hunter under saddle, and there are some Western disciplines I don't like, such as western pleasure.|`|0EmjQjf7aa	western midlands. the broms WHOO HOO|`|cGRyDCpQaa	I ride both english and western and prefer english. Western saddles are too bulky and don't have enough contact for me. I like the type of events better in english too compared to western.|`|RZPLec5Eaa	English.  I'm not against western people --- the saddle just feels too big & bulky.|`|gbd4PMwfaa	i started out riding western for three years, but because of a trainer switch I rode English in a western saddle for a while, if that makes sense, and then switched completely. I love the jumping and I have recently taken up dressage, which I love. I will never go back to western. It was good for learning to ride in though, and i have respect for western riders too. I think western looks just as hard and demanding as English. I was never competitive in western.|`|eEhZslTYaa	English is great - you have more contact with the horse and you can work on improving your contact and seat much more easily. I enjoy the discipline of dressage and jumping and the competition that goes with it but...     Western is so much fun sometimes though to just let loose and not be as disciplined. Western saddles were designed to be sat in for a long time and so can be more more comfortable for galloping around in.|`|G8IRX295aa	I have been riding for almost my whole life. To me, english is more fun. I have taken western lessons but I never fell in love. Now I can jump up to 4'9'' and I love it.|`|VmZKZjP1aa	I've ridden both western and English. Both are fun, but I prefer western, because I mostly do trail and rodeo. Western is way more comfortable for long rides. It's also better, more durable, if you are doing any kind of work with the horse (like driving cattle). That's what the saddles are designed for: holding on, pulling/holding (sometimes dragging) other horses/cattle/etc, and and designed to hold all kinds of equipment (ropes, saddle bags, tools, etc).    Give it a try. Buy a used western saddle. I bet you'll like it. It's the best if your just out for a trail ride, or even galloping around in an arena|`|0kh2HEFMaa	Ive ridden both, but primarily I ride western. Its more laid back and I just think its more fun to not have to worry about anything. Just sit there and go. I used to ride english when I was younger, but now im set on western. Its not like its hard to learn, you should try it out sometime! (although id like to teach my 5 year old to do some jumping). Good luck!|`|Pn9tPYKbaa	i am a full out western rider,:)never rode english, so i cant say anything bad about it:) but you can jump western to. i do, over logs,rocks ect. i do barrel racing, and i love it:)sometimes, if i dont realy wanna put the saddle on, i just g bareback:) its so fun, then ur even closer to the horse than english[lol im just kidding, i hear people say they are closer to the horse than western riding english, so im just sayin......:) but i am a full out country girl,barrel babe, and yes, i got some redneck in me from my dad, and im proud of it:) i would never turn from my western ways:) but i am veery sure english is a blast, its just a little to dressed up and fancy for my ridin:)|`|6GehblM3aa	I ride English.  I do mostly dressage, and some jumping on the side when it's warm out (for fun mostly).|`|eXDDODfHaa	western its more confortable.   yeah whenever i watch a horse movie i just feel like going outside and just riding away but sometimes my horses dont corperate.|`|3YHZUuhyaa	I love both! I like english because of dressage and jumping but I like western because of the gaming (barrel racing, poles, etc.   My horse does english now and we love jumping!! I'm training him to barrel race now and hopefully will be able to compete =D    Good luck!|`|f101IPi1aa	i ride english whether i am trail riding or hacking around in a ring, i prefer close contact saddles because i like to feel the horse underneath me and well i just believe you can feel the horse more in an english saddle..|`|z90jPBMLaa	I ride and show both english and western. I love both. Its counts what kind of shows you go to, but some you can sign up for english and western classes. That's what I always did. You have a wonderful day of riding and showing.|`|skkhGdeWaa	As you said i really like to jump to, i ride english and would never want to stop!  some ppl act as if you ride english you cant ride western?  i love english i have rode western once but i found it bornin conpared to english!!  xx|`|aYbm7gYTaa	wow, im going through exactly the same thing lol! i ride english 2. I'm thinking about trying barrel racing. western just looks more cool and laid back compared to english, which is more prissy and clean cut. watch this vid:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6UO8Kwql...  and this 1 2:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PR_LXw3K...|`|mUNJEh8baa	I personally like English riding a lot more. It seems like i'm a lot closer with my horse and we can communicate better.   And jumping is wonderful. It feels like your floating. And you cant really jump very much Western, unless you want a second belly button.     Enjoy!|`|RpZWaVomaa	I do everything pretty much with my horse he is a jumper, dressage, reining horse if you do try western try trails or reining or contesting its a lot of fun I don't suggest western pleasure but that's just me its kinda boring|`|k15PehD7aa	Western definitely!  It's something you can do even if you're not made of money.  English riding seems to be for the rich.  I know that's a broad generalization but it seems to be true. But my favorite thing to do is drive.  I'd rather drive than ride any day.|`|GhsdPFdaaa	I started out riding western and then grew to love english. My favorite? It really all depends on the horse I'm riding. If I'm riding my gaming mare, of course I'm going to use my western. But for my two geldings I mostly ride them english.     I personally think the western saddle is too bulky and I feel closer to the horse in an english saddle. Although I do like to barrel race occasionally, I find the english discipline more demanding and my QH gelding gets bored with flatwork and he's not built to be a timed event horse. But he absolutely loves jumping. So I go with what the horse likes instead of what I prefer.

Is that you feed a lot less! I personally feed Solid Gold barking at the moon and only feed 2 cups of food a day! Both of my dogs are 95lbs!

I cant feed that food because my female had an allergy to chicken!     The food I am using right now is $60 for a 33lb bag! A bag is lasting about 4 to 5 weeks right now!

If you want it to live, you'll need to take it to a vet, get any medications, etc., and use them religiously, get a POSITIVE I.D. because you can't take proper care of an animal without knowing what it is, and make sure that not only are you giving it a proper diet, but make sure you're housing it correctly. Remember, a PROPER aquatic turtle setup will cost around $200.    Even if you correct these issues, I don't expect the turtle to survive... it sounds like it's pretty far gone. I'd love you to prove me wrong.

sbB0TpGXaa	Start small and local.  you will need a light saddle but the one you have now will probably work for now.  Do not purchase a new one for endurance until you discover if it is something you want to continue to pursue.     I will be starting competitive trail and endurance this spring but here is what I take on long trail rides.     You will need to ride the minimum of 10 miles a week meaning at least one ten mile ride per week not five 2 mile rides.  Eventually you need to work up to 30 plus mile rides but you need to keep the number of rides per week down and concentrate on distance per ride.    To take with you on the ride the number one consideration is water.  I also like to take snacks, spare shoes (the glue on soft sheets (I get them at country supply at horse.com) or boots.      I also like to take a first aid kit. You can get small ones or put one together yourself.    Can't think of what else at the moment.    Oh yes and as another poster said hoof pick.    Fewer longer rides build endurance.  More shorter rides will wear down a horse if the rider does not know how to properly condition them.      You will need to up the caloric intake while training.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Just your regular saddle/bridle will be fine, if you have multiple saddles use the most comfortable saddle you have for both you and your horse.    Also bring water, a hoof pick, a small first-aid kit, a cell phone, and make sure you wear a helmet.  You can carry everything in a saddle bag.|`|uVgqDlrcaa	Ah, Arabians are perfect for the job..    All you need is a horse... lol.    Just ride it a lot.|`|AKhwa8Ixaa	If it is your first time,  I suggest you do nothing more than LD (Limited Distance).  LD is usually accomplished in a day and is only 25 to no more than 40 miles.  You usually need camping supplies, even for LD.  You usually arrive the evening BEFORE the endurance race and camp on-site since the race usually starts before the sun is up...so prepare your self to be an early riser (& bring a flash light that doesn't spook your horse).  Make sure you wear an SEI approved riding helmet at all times.    The BEST thing is to ride daily...even go on 11 to 15 mile trail rides (AFTER you ask your vet to inspect your mount for permission to practice endurance racing ).  The next best thing is to find a been there done that type of endurance rider close to you that can mentor you and/or go along with you on your first ride.   Good luck!
f61c6ad75081d1de726d4e9737429211aa	I tried to save a rabbit kitten once, but never Mallard eggs...    Check out the websites below for a pertinent blog and dedicated sites on this subject!|`|hPhQkT79aa	Ducks egg doesn't take just a month   It took them about 30 to 45 days|`|8GDd6lrnaa	have they been sitting on them? are they warm? if not it to late. if their sitting on them give them a few more days. 28-34 days normal.|`|91bhiXTVaa	First, have they been in an incubator so you know for a fact that they're 27 days old?    If so, they're probably dead.  Most mallard eggs hatch at 28+or - 2 days.  At 27 days, the entire egg should be dark because the duckling nearly fills it.  You could see the beak when you candle, or hear them pipping.  If you see a smaller embryo, then your incubation temperature is way too low, or it died about a week ago.      If you can't be certain of age, It could be alive if kept warm.  If you got it from under a bird, put it back.  The mom will know if it is alive or not.
W0buucLsaa	I like spaniels - they are fairly common but not overbed like labs. They're sporting dogs that range from 15 to 50 pounds, depending on the type. They're not couch potatoes, but they're not hyper either, and I've never met one with a nasty temperament. I might stay away from purebred cockers because they are so overbred, but Brittany, Sussex, English Springer, etc. spaniel mixes are all over the place. You can tell by their ears whether they are part spaniel or not. :)|`|fmHHcFd5aa	the smartest indoor dogs of medium size are pits and bulldog breeds like bulldogs and boxers. Pits are very smart dogs and rate the top of the class above small dogs in obedience and smarts. If raised right they are the best dogs you can have. bulldogs are also very very smart. they are great for the indoors and require little exorcise. maybe just a 30 min. walk at night but they are still active pups and even into adulthood can be active at times. Boxers are also great dogs.

OFpl236faa	Terrier describes a wide range of terriers. We have Jack Russell Terriers and they shed like crazy! So if it says terrier mix, it could be anything.    Terriers are usually very energetic and need a lot of exercise. They also need a lot of mental stimulation. Because a terrier mix can be a wide range of things, they can look like just about anything. They also can be quite naughty and independent. They are definitely not for everyone. They take a lot of commitment, patience and consistency.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	short|`|gjD8pndjaa	All dogs shed, and as for coat type, it depends entirely on the other breed in the mix.  A mix could have any fur in the furry rainbow    Sure, there are pure bred terriers that get to be the size of small German Shepherds.    If it was something like a Jack Russell mix, it would be unusual for it to be that big, but it was an airedale mix its entirely possible.    "Terrier mix" can also be another wording for a Pit Bull mix, which can explain the size|`|A21SswSfaa	What is your question?     Terriers very greatly. Some "blow" their coat and other terriers shed. Some have long coats and some have short coats. Terriers are usually smaller dogs. A terrier mix that big is uncommon, but not unheard of.

And I have a gray dog and she is VERY Intelligent!  They are all the same breed to!  Wow!|`|x8Vgu6acaa	You don't watch many nature programs do you.  There are grey wolves, black, wolves, and white wolves, sable wolves ect.      besides, wolves have a different kind of intelligence than dogs do.  Dogs are way more trainable than wolves are and that is what makes them the spectacular pets that they are.|`|AA12377116	Interesting question, if you are serious.     I have a couple white dogs and they are smarter than me, I know that, cause they sure aren't catering to my needs.|`|gyxB0lDIaa	my dog is brown.he is relay smart.he dose not run in the wall  o.KKK.|`|pGIOz14Faa	As opposed to "blonde" dogs?  Sorry, I couldn't resist.  In my experience my little brown dog is very smart, but then I have another brown dog who is definitely challenged.|`|iNfDcN9jaa	No, I dont think they would be any smarter than any other colour of dog but diffrent breeds of dogs might be smarter than other breeds!|`|qqUvoC5uaa	Brown is not a dominant gene. It is recessive to black, which is the dominant gene.     Maybe the white dogs you have come in contact with have not been trained, or were poorly bred.|`|9MjaiYj4aa	No,I think its the type of dog you get.Some are smarter and some are dumb.|`|KxjUim7yaa	What about brown and white ones like the Jack Russell. (color really doesn't matter)|`|6SeWCfUfaa	What about grey wolves?  (Which is probably the wolf most of our domestic dogs decended from.)    And no, color doesn't have anything to do with intellegence.  Sometimes genes for color will be ... we'll say linked ... to certain behavior traits in dogs.  But normally, you only see that in a certain line of dogs.  It certainly does not cross over to all breeds.    And ... one of the most trainable breeds out there are American Eskimo dogs - they're white.|`|OFpl236faa	No, I don't think that. It depends on the breed. We have 3 Jack Russells who are mainly white and those little guys are too smart for their own good. We also have Border Collies who are black tris and they are all smart also. I think it depends on the breed and what they were bred to do.|`|d2191893763b20a6b077367a131978aaaa	My very bright Border Collie is black and white    Note:  In Shelties and Collies the "sable" is dominant. If a "pure for sable" is bred to a tricolor (black, tan and white) all pups will be sable.|`|7d92fea894a319f966b40ae7494fa5a5aa	What about the Arctic Wolf?  He's white and pretty smart.|`|3giaPYe8aa	Sorry, but that is a very stupid deduction.|`|xQtnTKCAaa	my dog is brown and she seems smart but it could just be about the breeds not the color.
0I9Fm00Naa	You should have filed a complaint with your local police department.It's illegal for someone to entice an animal in that manner. If for some reason he gets bit by your dog or anyone else's ,  if there is a police report that states he is teasing and trying to provoke someones dog in your neighborhood, you have not only protected yourself and your dog from any kind of prosecution but every other dog owner in your area as well. People like that deserve to be chewed up by a dog they provoked,  and for some people that's the only way they will learn that what he is doing is morally  and ethically  wrong.|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	Man, if that guy were doing that to my dogs, he's get an earful-- from both me, AND my dogs.  There's nothing like a jackass provoking dogs to act aggressive.    I would have mentioned, sarcastically, about how "mature" he was, and asked him if his mother knew what he was doing, and then suggested to him that next time he grow the **** up, in not so many words, and do what you did-- take my dog in immediately.|`|gzaVGE4Qaa	People are cruel idiots. My best friend has a rescued pit, she was tied to a house with a bungy cord (no collar), she has a thick scar all around her neck and somehow she is still the sweetest dog ever.|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	If that would have happened to me, I personally would have punched the guy. NO one messes with my dog!|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Just tell them she is a very well trained dog but only to a point.  I would keep your eye on your dog. If he is hanging around trying to taunt a Pitt he might be in to fighting and those arses steal bait dogs.|`|rIQXNxn5aa	Your lucky to have good self control.  If I were you, he would gotten a few good thwacks between the eyes. Call the police, that's considered harassing.|`|uXWvDjWHaa	Guys like that deserve to get a bite taken out of them. Anyone that taunts or mocks helpless animals deserves what he or she gets.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	I would of just decked him myself! He wouldn't have a face if he was in touching distance of one of my dogs.   They do it to act tough, than the minute someone else stands up to them and knocks them down, or the dog takes a chunk they're sooks and blame the dog for it and blame the owner for not being in control. Best thing to do is just ignore them and walk away, they get annoyed when they can't get attention off of people.|`|7rx3sdehaa	My, I'm glad that I am not the only one who has encountered the puerile behavior of teenagers who attempt to provoke a dog to intentionally cause them to become aggressive towards the person.    My sister has a Boxer, and he can be very territorial, and I have warned the boys who run track that they cannot run into our yard - and if they do, they will risk being attacked by the dog. There were boys out running, and what do they do? They run in the yard, they squeal, bark, and get his attention - he runs over, and bit 3 different boys. I clearly told, even the track coach about the situation. The boys got in trouble, because the dog is inside of a fence but can still reach them if they come into our yard.     Some people attempt to provoke dogs that they know can harm them, why? Just because they are ignorant, nothing more or less. I share your grief, and hopefully by education these people will learn better.|`|GLsCVPCuaa	dont waste any more time thinking about it...he obviously has issues and tries to take them out on animals...its not worth your time..and your dog probably has a better life than he does|`|HtHFHfDKaa	Some people just like to make other people miserable and much to your surprise some people just hate animals either they or someone they know was attacked by a dog at a young age so they develop a hatred for all dogs.|`|XElaAuHHaa	I cannot believe that such idiots live in this world!!!!!     honestly this makes me so cross!    Unfortunately there are some very cruel and nasty people in this world (but like some of the idiots that right stupid answers to people)     Im not a dog person, but have two beautiful cats and if anyone ever showed any aggression to them i would possibly not be as calm as you. I admire your restraint.    Think you just have to put it down to this person being an absolute prick as you mention, and hope you never come across them again.     No animal is dangerous unless it is miss-treated by people such as this    Ooooo i am so cross this happened to you!|`|ZG0aVOa2aa	i would have knocked the little **** out!|`|AztYCjc7aa	I know the feeling I own a big beautiful pitbull/chow chow mix and people are always both awed at her beauty and afraid of her because she looks like a pit besides the longer hair and deep amber eyes. Remember the best thing you can do is train your dog to trust you to handle situations this that and teach her to become less reactive to people like that. Some people come around when they see how well behaved and beautiful she is, I know my neighbors were terrified of my pit mix and would run whenever they saw me with her, now their daughter a five year old comes to play with her all the time after school (IM ALWAYS OUT THERE WITH THE TWO OF THEM), they've even offered to purchase her from me but im not selling!   Im sorry people are so mean but remember us responsible pit owners know all about the unfair persecution this breed goes through, but trust me the best way to change people is to make your dog and yourself fine examples of what a pitbull and her family are really like!|`|I4vPxh3jaa	OH MY GOODNESS! i would be soooo pissed if some one did that to my dog! i can not believe some people. he is so lucky he was with a good dog. most dogs would not put up with that. some people are just jerks!|`|PM23RDycaa	He's a prick ignore him. And if he does it again casually that while your dog doesn't have it in her to treat him like he deserves, you don't have that same hang up.    When it comes to APBTs and other bully breeds SOME people are complete and utter nimrods.
426c98c5e6499e1f282c417b905cea60aa	You have led her to believe she is the alpha.  She thinks the couch is hers, the tissue is hers, and she bit you because you tried to take it away.   You will need to bring her to obedience and start learning to take control.|`|HtHFHfDKaa	She either doesn't like you or she likes to be by herself. I would have her checked by a vet.|`|hxBwRt09aa	Loyalty has nothing to do with this. Since you have not been the leader in your home, your dog is in that role. So you don't do anything TO her, but do you do anything WITH her? There are many kind, humane methods of training. If you don't want to attend a class then you have to buy a book, or find one in the library, about dog training. Her disposition will improve when you spend your time with her better.
YnCUyvK7aa	For your temperature problem, it sounds like you need a higher wattage heater if the thermometer and heater are working correctly.    ~Do you see the light for the heater coming on?  Check the outlet or power strip, breakers, etc.  It's not unknown for someone to unplug a heater to clean a tank and forget to plug it back in.  ~Is the heater adjustable?  Maybe someone reset the adjustment so it's not heating your water to the temperature you thought it was set to.  If it's a + or - type, it's harder to tell if the setting was changed than if it's 1 where you set it to the temperature reading you want.  ~Is the thermometer giving an accurate reading?  ~A heater should be rated at 3-5 watts per gallon if you have to raise the temperature 10 degrees F or less above the room temperature.  So for a 10 gallon, it should be a 50 watt.  But if you have to go more than 10 degrees, go up 1 size in the wattage to a 75 watt.    A female can drop eggs if she's kept away from the male for too long, she doesn't have to have the male squeeze her.  Female fish always have eggs inside them, but when they're getting ready to spawn, the eggs that will be released swell up.  Unfortunately, they only have so much space before they're too big to stay inside her and she has to let some of the out.    It's probably too late now [ you asked this 8 hrs ago] but you could have tried removing the separator to see what would happen.  Maybe the male could have fertilized the remaining eggs and put them into the bubble nest.  But any that would have fallen probably aren't fertilized, so it'll be too late to save those.    For now, I'd get the heating problem resolved, condition the fish again, and try again in a few weeks.
NoOM7eZnaa	I have never seen a pure orange betta but there are pure green bettas, mostly in darker shades.    They come from Thailand in shallow streams, rivers, and rice paddies. These are very large, so they do not come in contact often, and when they do, they will fight, and the loser can escape. This is not the same as in captivity where losers cannot escape.    The shallow water makes people think they can live in tiny bowls without filters but this really isn't true...the difference between shallow streams and rice paddies, and bowls, is that in the rice paddies and streams it acts like a marsh and filters the water, so they always have changing water...the water does not become polluted in a bowl.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	how can there be more than one murder in the world, they'd kill everybody      bettas get along  they don't seek out other bettas to fight with  nor do they aim to kill the other betta    only if you are a retard and put two in a bowl and dont do anything will one die      they live in shallow slow moving bodies of water throughout southeast asia|`|F15EPx0Taa	Origin: Cambodia, Thailand    Natural Habitat: Shallow waters of rivers and streams.|`|tdNclWbgaa	Bettas come from the swamps and rice patties of Thailand. They don't need much water because they can breathe through their mouth.In the wild they do fight, but eventually one betta becomes the alpha male and the fighting becomes less.

There are pure colored bettas , but not in the wild.|`|yczbg2pKaa	thailand  the live in  shallow puddles and ponds and such
IvrewcBXaa	First, congratulations on adopting!  There are too few heroes taking on the homeless pets out there!     On to your question: Many cats drool when they are either very relaxed or very stressed.  Often it accompanies purring.    For the most part her saliva is no big deal, no worse than yours.  However, many cats do have a bacterial species that can be harmful if introduced into a wound or anaerobic environment.  That's Pasteurella multocida, and is the reason any cat bite that breaks the skin should be seen by a medical professional.  This pathogen doesn't survive well in the open, though, so she isn't likely to drool on your sheets and get you sick.    And if it hasn't happened yet, please please spay her.  You'd be saving lives!|`|GdBG4PGYaa	A cat drools when extremely happy. It is like if a dog sees something good to eat, they will drool.    She is not sick.    She is not allergic, or excited. She may still be getting used to your place, but that is not why she is drooling. No, her drool is not toxic. You don't need to wash your hands every time she touches them with her mouth. Unless you want to. A cats mouth may be "dirty" but it isn't going to hurt you. :) (Unless your bitten, that hurts).      I hope I helped! Your cat is Ok! :)|`|Emk4xuTuaa	A little drooling isn't bad, but if her drooling becomes alot of drool, then that might be a sign of a bad tooth- this is what happened to my cat.  When her drooling was alot I thought she was sick, so I took her to the Vet, and he found out she had an absessed tooth that had to come out, had to leave her over night, but she's been happy ever since.

jPv8AXAPaa	Bichon Frise's and Wheaton Terrier's are hypoallergenic.     Shorter-haired dogs shed less and may not aggravate your grandfather as much.    6 hours at school isn't too bad to be away from your dog, but you must be sure to walk them in the morning and evening, and be responsible for their well-being instead of dumping the responsibility on your grandfather.|`|PM23RDycaa	You should wait until you grow up, to get a dog. How fair is it to your GRANDFATHER to bring a dog into the house. Low shed dogs can still trigger an allergic reaction there is no 100% gaurantee other than a stuffed dog or NO dog whatsoever.    Why should your allergic grandfather since I am assuming you live with him or you and your parent(s) do be responsible for YOUR pet for pretty much most of the day?

Nothing like torturing your Grandpa just so you can have a dog.    ALL dogs, regardless of breed, create dander, which is usually the main reason people have allergies to dogs.    Poodles are usually LESS irritating to those that are allergic, but it's NEVER a guarantee.    EDIT:  Poodles do NOT have a coat of wool-- you are thinking of SHEEP.|`|nPuZVGFRaa	A hairless dog.. Like a chinese crested.  Ha ha|`|aCqSF87Raa	No such thing as a "HYPOallergenic" dog - any person can have a reaction to any breed of dog. If your grandpa is allergic then it is up to him if he wants to spend time with any breed chosen to see if he has a reaction - if he does not then you might as well drop it. Forget about it.     HE is the one that could suffer as a result and it's very selfish and childish to try to force him to go through that. HE (or whoever is supporting you) is also the one that will be paying for the dog and probably may end up being the main caregiver. IF he doesn't want that, be a mature and responsible adult and WAIT like the rest of us had to do.|`|XFUN8nNOaa	Umm, im allergic to cats, so i know how it feels. i wouldnt get one if your poor gradpas just going to suffer.

It helps you identify that one that suits your requirements. good luck!    http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/s3s|`|uwd425eTaa	Some dogs are considered "hypoallergenic" but that doesn't necessarily mean that they will not at all irritate your grandfather's allergies. It depends partially on how allergic he is to them. Maybe ask his doctor if a dog would hinder his health?   And allergy shots don't always work so well. Medication can help, but doesn't always completely control the symptoms.    Good luck finding one! :-)|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Instead of making your Grandpa suffer, you can volunteer to help the dogs at your local animal shelter.

Just make a machine that makes grilled cheese sandwiches and operates when you press a button. You can teach the cat to press the button! I'm serious! You can teach it to do that! The hard part is making the machine. Well, if you had a frying pan ready on the stove, then a spatula with a spring to flip the bread and some cheese, ... oh. the cheese would go bad and you cant get the cat to open a fridge. oh! if you had something hard that is half in the closed fridge and half out you could teach the cat to sit on the part sticking out making the door open! ok. then you can have a slide that comes out and the cheese can slide down it onto the bread. add any other contraptions necessary to make it work.

lyocWukKaa	Good for you.|`|iVQULHqYaa	There are so many questions about older dogs and puppies that I have typed a reply which I have saved.     Puppies are excitable, lovable hooligans. They have bursts of unbelievable energy, however in order to grow they need lots of sleep. New puppies need a room where they can rest and sleep and the other dogs in the house need respite. Older dogs dont want puppies biting their ears and chewing their necks, if a puppy does this, the older dogs should be allowed to chastise the puppy. How would you cope if you were expected to cope with an unruly toddler twenty four hours a day? Would you be annoyed, if you had a toddler thrust upon you who pulled your hair and poked your eyes? I am sure that you would grumble.    Please dont expect your dog to cope with an unruly puppy and to baby-sit twenty four hours a day.  Supervise them for SHORT play sessions in the garden and if the puppy is over exuberant, allow your dog to chastise it, then put your puppy in its own room to rest. Dont expect your dog to want to sleep with your puppy or to play with it constantly.     Your puppy will possibly need about four meals a day. Divide your other dogs rations into four and feed it (or them) when you feed your puppy.  Give your existing dog extra attention when the puppy is resting and make him feels special.    There will be visitors, who want to see your puppy. When the doorbells rings, put your puppy into another room and tell your visitors to fuss your adult dog or dogs and give them treats BEFORE they make a fuss of the puppy.    Older dogs love puppies, with the proviso that YOU stop the puppy from being a pain in the bum. They dont want a puppy being thrust upon them all of the time. If you do this any dog will object and be confused.|`|MojYmo5Jaa	It depends what the German Shepherds Temperament is like.

ADD:  OK, since it'lll be a pup & your dog is netured, & they'll get equal amount of attention, it'll be pretty good, just watch out for your older dog to make sure he doesnt play too rough with the pup.  good luck.          .|`|FewhKlx9aa	I'm sure it will be fine,they get along better than most people,so get him a friend|`|A21SswSfaa	That depends on the dog. Some dogs get along fine together and others don't. Make sure that the dogs are introduced slowly and under your supervision. You want them to associate each other with positive things. Also, make sure your lab gets everything first: attention, food, treats, etc. He was there first. If things go well they'll adjust to each other pretty quickly.|`|9vhXo9Pkaa	yes if he needs companionship.  but ALWAYS feed the older dog first(which should b the lab)|`|e2e9c3a0b81436af289ac513be8ff521aa	Shepherds generally use collies but should have a general liking for dogs-nationality shouldn't matter|`|wFPnYWZiaa	I think it is a great idea. When you introduce them make sure you hold onto the new puppy the whole introduction and scold the lab if he shows any kind of aggression. We just recently introduced our 5th dog into our home. We had my dad (the alpha) hold onto the new dog and would scold any of the other dogs if they acted agressively. Make sure not to let the new puppy down until the lab stops showing signs of agression.|`|SEvhwIXQaa	I always have two dogs.  And my dogs have always come from the pound or from dog rescue groups.  And, they have all been differing breeds.  So I know from first hand experience that you can have those two breeds around each other.    A few bits of advice though.  1.) Read Cesar Milans latest book.  It has a section in it about welcoming a new dog into your house.  Excellent tips.  And 2.) The puppy will want to play with the older dog.  The older dog won't want to play as much as the puppy, if at all.  So sooner or later the older dog will snap at the younger dog to tell him to knock it off.  It's going to happen.  And you will have to be careful to not reprimand your older dog (unless he gets carried away of course).  That's the way dogs communicate.  The old dog can't yell at the puppy so he will bite him or nip at him.  It's ok.  And it WILL happen.    Good luck.|`|QDem7s5baa	definately .both dogs are intelligent and will respect eachother 99 pc of the time and hopefully become your best friends.hope it works out|`|Q4UAJLgKaa	You'll need to learn dog body language as the puppy grows.    The Shepherd may be the more dominant as she matures.   Learn Pack Leadership. Both dogs need it. A shepherd will not respect you (obey you because of your status) unless you are the Pack Leader. Respect who they pick as top dog between them.    I doubt that either will cause a problem. I've only had one Shepherd who insisted on all the attention but it was because as a tiny puppy he had had Parvo. His previous owner felt so sorry for how deathly sick he was she took him to bed with her, IVs, meds, thousands of dollars later he would not tolerate another dog getting the attention.  When I rescued him as a 2 yr old he would body block the cat and the resident Sheperd from any attention from me. He would attack my Shepherd if I played with mine. Teeth, growls. It was serious!    I would hear my dog growl and thought he'd started the fight. But it was the rescue with the stiff body stance and stare who never said a word that started every fight. A very difficult body language to see from above or from behind. Then a slight lip curl on one side. Then the sudden attack.  Mine was just warning him to back off with the growls. I had misunderstood.    So be smarter than I was. Watch closely. You may be surprised at who the instigator is.    The rescue, my dog's brother, was neutered. Mine isn't and has never fought or bitten in his life.  So never take a puppy to bed with you.      The rescue is at his fourth home now. He has a wonderful, full and happy life. I saw him the other day he's the most beautiful, joyous Shepherd I've ever known.
AA10421992	You'll no doubt have to take the dog to the vet to be examined and possibly have an ex ray done to determine what injuries the dog has.  Good luck.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	All of a dogs weight on their front end can be painful, like jumping out of a tall truck.  They land "hands" first.  Getting up in the bed, is she trained to do so?  Did anyone ever try and teach her not to?  If she was told no, don't do this, she may be waiting for your approval and the go ahead before doing it.  Try teaching her a voice command or hand signal instead of having to assist her.  Perhaps a running start?  My girl, even if it's low, still prefers a running start or she kind of stalls out half way through.    How old is she?  My boy developed arthritis in just his right shoulder and elbow, so he has trouble getting up into and own off of things now.  Try feeling along her joints and see if theres any deformities, swelling or pain.  If you're worried, contact a vet as this is always something that's best caught early.  Best of Luck!|`|QVP8zSuWaa	You need to have the vet check her.|`|AA12322387	You don't state how old your dog is or the breed.  Could be arthritis, could be hip dysplasia.  It's hard to tell.  You certainly need to take her to the vet to find out.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Sounds like hip dysplaysia and you can start giving her something from the drug store called Glucosimine-Chrondrotin.Give her 15oomg each and in 6wks you should start to see results..But this is a lifetime regimen that has to be given everyday at the same time..  Massag therapy is great and you can do this yourself,just start from the top of her head and work down including her ears and toes.Do this on each side of her spine and all around her thigh area and down her legs,she'll be a new girl|`|iMOePEWlaa	first i have a few quesions,how old is she?  has this always been a problem?  when did it start?   if she is old it is very likely she has arthritize,sadly there is few thigs you can do for this. try making a ramp or steps to put in your truck that you can easly drag down to help her up. you can put one by your bed to. also you can start picking her up and puting her in the truck/on the bed.    another issue that has alot to do with age(but sometimes just happends) is depth perseption ,she may be having troble judging how far up it is,and is afrad of missing or falling.    it is also possible she has maneged to spran or get some other ingery. in this case i recomend going to see the vet asap. it can sometimes be hard to tell if it is ingerd unless you know what to look for.|`|nGjMvGYqaa	Hip displaysia is a possible answer to this problem. Arthritis could also be the answer What it boils down to is that you need to take her to the vet and have her checked out. Your dog is displaying signs of pain, and something needs to be done. Depending on her breed, weight, age etc. there are specific pain medications or even vitamins that can help. Or perhaps she has something wrong such as a broken toe nail or something along those lines. But nonetheless, take her to the vet. Do not let her live her life in pain.

In the meantime, wrap him up in a towel and keep him warm, hold him close and let him know that your there.    but please dont hang about anymore take him to a vet immediately.    And no more baths unless he gets himself into a terrible terrible mess as they are very clean animals and will keep themselves perfectly clean. and if you do wash him, you have to throughly dry him out afterward and use a specialist cat soap.    please let us know how you get on.|`|kycCzUVGaa	Do not ever ever bathe cats in the winter and only in the summer about once. They don't need it unless they are ill. If they are ill a wet sponge and dry towel are all that is needed. Cats do not need baths. You can spay or powder them for fleas or give them a pill but not baths.
2MZZ7Wtwaa	So very sorry.  I am going through something like that now.  Hurts to even talk about it.  I have cried so hard I can barely see out of my eyes.  I feel like running outside into the cold air just so I can breath.  It is a terrible time you are going through right now, but this is the second time I have had to go through this (yrs apart, thank God) and I know that time is a great healer of a broken heart.  The other people that suggested you get another pet are right.

It's important to give yourself time to grieve, losing a pet is losing a family member, it hurts ALOT!  There are many pet loss websites that may help you deal with your grief.    Like any painful experience, time heals all wounds, and it will get easier day by day. Within a few days once you get back into a regular routine, school, spending time with friends etc. you will find yourself coping much better. It's ok to feel devastated right now, and trust me it will get better with time.

If the pet food contains corn/corn products or by products it is a poor quality food. Corn is a filler that can trigger skin problems. (allergies, skin problems, itching and excessive shedding) By products is anything from an animal not fit for human consumption, including cancerous tissue. Do not pay attention to advertising, they all say there food is great. "Vet approved" means they have a vet on staff to approve their product. In other words, someone paid to approve it. Same with foods most vets recommend. Salesmen "gift" vets then the vet recommends the food. Most vets are not nutritionists! Quality foods have meat as the first ingredient Wellness, Solid Gold, Innova and Merrick are a few of the best brands available.

Some great dog food brands include Taste of the Wild (my personal favorite), Wellness, Innova, Eagle Pack Holistic, Natural Balance, Merrick, Solid Gold, Wolf Cub, or Blue Buffalo.

TPe7yiBYaa	As long as you leave pellets for it and feed it every day you see it, you should be fine. But don't leave crickets in overnight, although you can buy super worms (be careful--they bite) or meal worms and leave them in the cage overnight, because your dragon will dig them up and eat them. You may have to ask your mum or dad to clean the water, or get a dish that automatically refills itself--like a jug or something. Your biggest problem, if your parents are unwilling to help, would be the heat lamp. You cannot leave the heat lamp on for several days in a row (mine got burned like that!) and you cannot leave it off for that long, either. My advice would be to talk to your parents and ask them to turn the heat lamp on during the day and off at night, get a water dish that refills itself, and ask your parents to drop in one or two worms while you are gone. Also, dragons can eat fruits and dark, leafy greens, so keep that in mind. Just make sure you don't leave that kind of food in there for more than a few days, or it could rot and make your dragon sick.   Good luck!|`|NqQNLCKuaa	You could have one of your parents help you out a little bit while your not there|`|8zQjC8oTaa	Please also know that part of a Bearded Dragon's diet includes live food, such as crickets.  If your mom or dad is not cool with that (since they will chirp loudly at all hours and sometimes escape from your lizard's habitat), you may want to consider a different reptile that consumes primarily vegetation.  Have you thought about getting a turtle or tortoise?  Ask your local reptile dealer what they recommend for your sitation.  It's always a good idea to have a back-up plan just in case your parents say 'no' to the Bearded!|`|xoXkHOVsaa	As long as he is fed regularly, has fresh water, and a clean habitat then it's fine for you not to see him every day.  Either your mom or your dad will need to feed it and change the water, but you will see him often enough to clean out the cage.  A bearded dragon doesn't need to be held or played with every day, so it won't become depressed if you are gone.

AaXl3vcCaa	i love labs and cattle dogs, they are smart and loyal and good all around|`|W0buucLsaa	Firstly, do not get a puppy. I repeat: do not get a puppy. Find an adult dog through a rescue who has been fostered WITH CHILDREN and done well with them. Also, remember: the larger and more mellow the dog, the safer it is around small kids.     Small dogs, puppies, and even medium sized dogs are more likely to view children (with their grabby hands and unstable little bodies) as threats, because little dogs are a lot more fragile than big ones.     Hyper dogs (like most labs, weims, and a lot of Great Danes) knock kids over, trample them, etc. You want a dog with a low energy level, that is large, and preferably already trained (*especially* houstrained) - because you probably won't have all that much time to train it.    Also, ignore anyone that recommends any breed based on this little information. These are a few questions you need to ask yourself, keeping in mind a large adult dog:    1) How much time am I willing to spend grooming my dog?  2) How much effort am I willing to exert exercising my dog?   3) How much money am I willing to spend at the vet? (Good ol' mutts tend to be hardier in general, and some breeds are more disposed to genetic health problems.)  4) How protective do I want my dog to be? (Remember that with protection comes certain liability issues.)    I cross-referenced a list of dogs that are good with kids with low-to-moderate energy breeds, and filtered them by size. These three breeds are the most ideal - lowest energy and highest compatability with kids:    Basset Hound (these are kinda large)  Bernese Mountain Dog (these are very large)  Irish Wolfhound (these are gigantic)    A couple of other breeds that are close - a little higher energy or not quite as excellent with kids - are the Great Pyrenees (gigantic) and Entlebucher Mountain Dog (kinda large). GP's get a 4 out of 5 for kids (the above are 5 out of 5), and Entlebuchers have moderate energy levels.    I suggest that you research these breeds, keeping in mind things like shedding and common health problems, and pick from those. :)    Or just get a big mutt from a rescue, that has a proven track record with kids.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	There is a lot more to consider than how many children you have when choosing a breed.  Grooming, and exercise needs.  Trainablility, energy level. size ect.  There are many breed quizzes available online. But take them with a grain of salt.  They will give you a start though.  Take the family to an all breed show and look at the actual dogs. Talk to the owners.    When you have it narrowed down to the breed.  And you are chosing the actual dog. That is the time to make having small children your  1 priority in choosing the right dog that is safe for your kids. And the kids are safe for the dog.      I always recommend an older dog that is proven safe with children if you children are young.|`|nPuZVGFRaa	Well great dane is a little big for small children..

I have had the best luck with mutts and generally are a little bit healthier than purebreds, not always. But that way you can involve your kids and save a life in the process :)|`|qqUvoC5uaa	We need a ton more information that what you have provided.   4 small children, I would not suggest a large "hyper" breed of dog. Simply because the dog can and is likely to try and jump when younger, or simply can knock over the child.  Adversely, I would not recommend a small breed either.     How long during the day will the dog be left home alone?  How much activity and exercise are you willing to give the dog?  What type of coat would you prefer?  Have you owned dogs before?    Beagles are great with kids from what I have experienced (the happiness seen in my beagle when he finds a toddler is priceless).  But they can be difficult to train for a first time owner.   They also require a ton of exercise, will run if they get the chance (you need a GOOD fence), and tend to be quite loud.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Experts say you shouldn't get a dog in a home with a child under 6 years old. That said, a large dog. Small dogs are fragile. They tend to snap and bite when threatened. A Bulldog is apt to have health problems. It might be too much for him to keep up with 4 kids. A large dog that is know to be good with kids. Not a puppy. Find a good match at the local shelter.|`|AxaspNJJaa	I think you should get a Havanese. Great with children and other pets and dogs, doesn't shed(supposedly), smart, adorable, and can adjust to any lifestyle. They are ok with just a daily walk, but can do many active activities if you want. And they will love you to bits.|`|yNGWA678aa	Um...Labrador or ****-zu ^_~|`|uIpxm1zYaa	With small children you probably shouldn't get a small dog, it could get hurt when you're not paying attention. I would recommend a Saint Bernard if you want a big dog. I use to have one with a baby, a 3 year old, and a six year old. It was big, fluffy, gentle, and protective if it thought something was wrong. Just be aware of the drooling, they sell pills that can prevent that. If you want a smaller dog I would recommend a beagle, they are not too smallfor young children. My friend had one of those with children the same age. It was also very friendly and gentle. Some dogs are very energetic and others are very lazy. just be aware of this when you make your final decision, because your children will probably want a dog to play with.  Good Luck and I hope you find your perfect furry friend.|`|QVsTGbxeaa	You need to analyze your lifestyle and research what type of dog fits.  Dogs such as labs are great family dogs and good with kids, but they are very energetic and you need to have a LOT of time for them.  Find a dog you like and then research what type of personality it generally has to see if it fits with you and your family. It would be hard for anyone on here to really know that.  Good luck!|`|rCgYepfXaa	Toy poodle for sure! They are loving and loyal and will fit into any lifestyle. They love to do what ever you do!

I have two beagles and have babysat different aged children all under 4 and my the both understand they can't jump on the children and will sit there and let the children pull their ear off and never do anything. And if you have older children they love the chace them and play. Everything I always read said that you need to walk you beagles 2 hours a day and they will destroy your home but I don't walk my dogs 2 hours a day and they aren't overweight and they don't destroy things. Except they love to try to get into the garbages! Hope this helps!
zkjhtw2Kaa	I've got a Pyr/Retriever mix too.     If I remember correctly, she weighed about 60lbs at 7 months.    She's weighs 75ish now and she just had her 2nd birthday last month.|`|veDvtYhJaa	A 7mo old pyr looks like an adult size, but leggy dog.  They are close to full size now, and the "average" pyr I'd expect to weigh about 70  now, however, they do continue growing, though more slowly, to an average size of about 100  for a female.  She won't reach her full weight and height until she's about 2 years old.     You need to join a Yahoo pyr group so you can ask your many questions of owners of other pyrs.  A pyr / lab mix is not an unusual cross.        I'll give you a link to the akc breed information that will tell you more about the dog and her adult size.   Remember that a mixed breed dog will have a mix of appearances and breed traits with some attributes from each parental breed.

Females typically do not get that large but it is not unusual for them to get to 100 pounds or more. Pyrs are wanderers, so make sure you keep her in a fenced yard or walk her. They will wander off if you don't watch them. They are loyal and very protective. They are quite smart and learn quickly. Take her to an obedience class so she can learn manners. They are fantastic dogs. Good luck with your new friend.|`|AA12377116	Huge is an understatement. Feel the forepaws between the paw and the knee. There should be a bump on the front of the bone. That is where the bone meshes together and when the bump is smoothed out your dog is 99% grown. The other one percent or so takes a couple of years.    Train this dog immediately or you will have a miserable time instead of a wonderful life together.|`|d57kBHHfaa	Almost fully grown so somewhere in the upper 80 pounds depending on the dog and how big the parents were.|`|K97esxDsaa	Great Pyrenees are huge dogs.

ld2vmypNaa	uncooked ..yep.    Plus garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them un the pond, also meal worms.  As they get older they can have  snails, crickets, flies, crayfish, small frogs, slugs, tadpoles ,dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them) any other leafy greens will do for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples, remember cut up in small pieces.  Main food is feeder guppies,minnows or goldfish.    http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...|`|8cikAYp3aa	yes.. though I would avoid the sauce if possible.  rinse them under running water.

MHIuCQY8aa	What is your breeder feeding him?  The best thing to do is to continue feeding your new guy the same food he is used to eating.  This will help lessen his stress as he transitions to his new home.      Eventually of course you may wish to try another food - it may not be necessary as he may already be doing well on what he is getting.  If you do decide to change his food, do your research and continue asking questions.  Sometimes it is trial and error until you find the food that your Bulldog does best on.      I have two Bulldogs and one eats Royal Canin, Bulldog 24 and the other does well with Purina Pro Plan.  In the end it's about what works well for the particular dog.|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	You can buy these brands at pet stores. Usually, the non chain pet stores have more healthy selections though.

Go to it and enter the food of your choice. You will want a 4, 5, or 6 star rating. If the food of your choice has a 1, 2, or 3 rating that means it is crappy food. The higher rating the better, the lower rating the worse.   http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...      Also, another great thing to feed is the raw diet. Raw is completely safe and healthy.

I suggest grain free food for your Bulldog to prevent skin problems.|`|X2y9jEj2aa	The recommendation the other s gave are great, but most of the foods they list are extremely difficult to find an they are expensive.  I have 2 bullies myself.  An 8 year old female, who has nominal skin issues and a 1 year old male that I got from a bulldog rescue, who is riddle with skin problems.  The difference between the 2 is that one came from a home and the other came from an over breeder, someone who breeds ands inbreeds over and over again.  Hopefully you are not getting yours from one of these puppy mills, it really does make a difference!  Okay, back to the food.  I feed them Iams.  Not because it was recommended by anyone, but because they offer a wide range of foods, it's easy to find and affordable (it's sold at Walmart & Kmart and normally cheaper there than at Petsmart, Petco or the grocery store).  I feed them both the healthy naturals chicken flavor.  It also is easy on their tummys.... bullies are known for their gas!!!  Educate yourself about them.  They are stubborn when it comes to training too.  But beyond all of their "issues"  they are wonderful!  You are going to love him!!

lyocWukKaa	Gross!|`|5TM9P8tsaa	*If you think it definetely comes from the anal area all I can really think of is that she has overactive anal glands. Anal glands are located at about the 4 o clock and the eight o' clock area of the rectum. These glands are often referred to as "scent glands" and can be compared to those of the skunk, as these share the same foul smelling odor. Some cats just have these glands more overactive than others. Sometimes these anal sacs get infected (anal sacculitis) and therefore there will be pus and/or blood, there will be swelling on one or both sides of the rectum, sometimes the cat may scoot to get relief.In this case a veterinarian may need to express these glands sometimes up to once a week. If this is the case the most useful remedy is to have the glands removed to prevent infections and those foul smells. The only other cause I can think of is some sort of infection or abscess of the rectum tissue that would cause the discharge you see and the typical foul odor of occurring infection- while anal glands have more than a fishy foul smell. I hope this has helped.|`|B0EdMXXXaa	call your vet. that doesn't cost anything. just get advice

AA10327148	Females will come in heat about every six months, until they are spayed. Other dogs may mount them, as it is just a doggy communication behavior, but they can't breed them unless they are in heat.|`|AA10072754	spay your dog then never.....    and yes if theres a more dominant dog around|`|77ec1fe114e0ce87fb36a08fb7534c37aa	Female dogs come into heat generally starting around 6 months of age and then every 6 months after that until they are spayed. Larger breeds of dogs may not come into heat that often, sometimes as infrequent as every 8 to 12 months. Other dogs may mount the female when she is not in heat, but this is generally just a dominance behavior and not sexual behavior. She is unable to get pregnant unless she is in heat.     Please spay and neuter your pets! There are so many wonderful dogs looking for homes already and dying in the shelters. Don't be a part of the problem!

Her uterus is just not young enough to expand to accomidate the pups and quite frankly her eggs are old too.  There is a very real possibility she may even die by the breeding it self not to mention carring pups to term.  I would highly recomend you just forget about it and let her live without ever having a litter.  At her age doing any testing for hips, elbow or anything else is more risky than anything else.  All of those tests should have been done when she was much younger not now.  They have to put the dogs under to do those tests and at her age she may not wake up.

VIGCR9Xiaa	Guinea pig.  I have a guinea pig.   They are loveable and plump. Mine has never bitten me. Yes, they do squeak at night. However, if you put a towel over their cage it will shut them right up. You can even take a nap with them. ONE BIG MISTAKE I MADE WITH MY GUINEA PIG!  I only got one. You must get two or your piggy will live a sad life. Also you must get them at the same time or the one you origionally had will think that the other one is invading their property.|`|4d1d61e8ee76ab95bb8d2c7a9badfe1daa	I would say parrots.|`|X6R9XrR1aa	A fish or a parot!|`|oZO8ALgCaa	bird...rabbit...guinne pig|`|f0bf97e23d2a01d02d6970660c53372baa	guinea pigs, rabbits|`|fc7lsw5Laa	guinea pig, they're great animals and aren't nocturnal like hamsters so they will actually be awake with you.

Also parakeets or a parrot is cool to have as a pet.|`|mXEOcSeuaa	Try a rabbit.  You can get an indoor hutch for it and they are very intelligent creatures.  They will lick you, be happy to see you, let you pet them for hours and love you.  They can be trained to do a variety of things.  Check out the House Rabbit Society.   They can live alone but would be happiest with a cagemate.     If that isn't an option, I would definitley get a hamster because they are very enjoyable little creatures.  Hamsters love to see you and climb on the side of the cage that you're on to greet you.  They are very content just to sit in your hand and fall asleep while you watch tv.  If you're going to get a hamster make sure you only get one if it's a syrian or 'teddy bear' hamster because otherwise when the hamsters grow up they will fight to the death.  Try msn group's 'Hamsters Galore' for more information.    Rats are another option.  They are very intelligent creatures and love to be held and to climb all over you.  You can train them, just as you can rabbits, to use a litter box and come to you.  They need taller cages rather than long cages, whereas the others need longer than tall cages.|`|AA11209233	Rabbits.  You need to clean the cage more often than with a hamster or something similar, but they are a lot more loveable.  They are also easier to play with--you have to worry about hamsters getting into places too tight for you to retrieve them if you have them out of the cage.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	A rat.  Not a 'street rat' but one from a good pet store.  Rats are the easiest 'small pet' to get used to you, they are very easily trained, and are excellent at 'hiding' when you don't want them to be seen.  I've raised many rats (did it professionally for 3 years and had the 'exclusive' on sales of rats to pet stores in our large city for that time) and know rats from that and later when I had them as 'test subjects' in classes and when writing my Master's and PhD theses.  Get a rat, and let it sit on your shoulder as you do your housework or whatever from the first day on ... you'll have a sweet friend for life!|`|b3IcV30Uaa	Turtle!!!!!???|`|nPuZVGFRaa	I have 23 rabbits on a farm that all get love and are very friendly.

a9rQyJncaa	I guess some people give answers that could be damaging to a pet either treat their own pets like that or just don't know and give an answer that they think the person asking wants to hear. The person asking the question is looking for approval for what they want to do and often pick the answers that tell them what they want to hear. No responsible person should need to ask a question about leaving a puppy (or an adult dog) caged for nine hours. I really don't know why some people answer questions so irresponsibly, they and the person asking the question should think very carefully when a dog's welfare is at stake and how their actions can give such misery and unhappiness to their pet. Some so called animal lovers just don't have any common sense.|`|AA11097657	We could suggest that people only look at answers from top contributors and ignore all the rest.    I don't mean that as a dig at you.    I believe that the ones you are talking about can't be bothered to read through long detailed explanations of why not.    They have a short attention span and I don't hold out much for the future and happiness of their pets.
d857a9e7089a4eae34802fd48931e712aa	Some people have archaic and ill-informed views on certain topics, and are not shy when it comes to disseminating that information to others who are naive or un-informed.    The questioners themselves prefer answers that match their views. People agree with answers that they want to hear.     So, all in all, it may seem like a futile exercise at times. However, I feel that if you can help even one person out of the hundreds that ask the same question, that's a job well done.    Also, it should be of some comfort to you that even though the original asker may not benefit from somebody's expert advice, another member or reader that is browsing the page may be able to discern between a valuable source of information and total crap.    So, in essence even though the asker may not benefit from your answer, many others might.  Keep plugging.|`|d4d5b7268af1cba9fe73fcd03eb1e61aaa	Half the fun of Answers is realising just how stupid some of the questions are.Many questions can be answered quickly using any search engine  but he ho its entertainment ,don't take it to personally .|`|DIjL6Tuvaa	I'd say keep answering. There are a lot of crazy and stupid answers on here and it is sad when these are chosen as best, but there are still people out there who appreciate good answers. I don't often ask questions here, but I definitely search and read answers. I am always glad to see intelligent answers, even if the questioner isn't.|`|AA12281930	is it ok to leave a puppy locked in a cage for nine hours?|`|QZBGIOygaa	unfortunatly we can't|`|n99NOgHJaa	There may be people answering questions wrong , but isn't up to the person asking to accept it as "correct" advice? If a person was really concern they would either confirm with a Professional or search a variety of answers and then chose the best from the information they have collected. So I think it's not the answer who is dumb but maybe the questioner?     Not saying this was a dumb question! It was actually very interesting !|`|AA10029366	"how can we stop silly people who lack knowledge from giving clueless people stupid answers."    If you could come up with a way to do this, you would be crowned Queen of Yahoo Answers on the spot!!|`|QVP8zSuWaa	LOL All you can do it is thumbs up the decent answers.   Most of them really just want to hear what they want anyway.   We will always have the questions like that until they figure out how to research the previous questions.    Keep plugging away you never know when you will make a difference in a dogs life|`|AA12377116	People respond to those answers which they want to hear, which will ease their conscience and which don't make them do anything more than they are already doing.    People who care about their animals, and genuinely are willing to do what is best for their animals, will listen and follow your advice whether or not they ever rate you. Those are the people you are helping.    Keep putting your heartfelt and experienced answers out there, for people such as me, who benefit from reading all of the responses to an interesting question.     The following are the most inane and I for one think that nobody should answer them, at all, and maybe they will stopped being asked:    Q:What should I name my dog?    A: Unfortunate  Q:How can I tell if my Bichy-poo-malti-doodle is a purebred?  A: Ask it. Purebreds can talk.  Q: Ten points to the dog expert who can tell me what my dog is?  A: That's a dog?!!  Q: Isn't my dog cute??!!  A: I can't tell, your face is in the way.  Q: How much should I sell my puppies for?  A: Per pound or wholesale?  Q: How do I get the dog next door to stop barking?  A: Let him play with your cat.  Q: Why does my dog stare at me?  A: He can't believe how ugly you are.    Have a better day.|`|AA11097657	We could suggest that people only look at answers from top contributors and ignore all the rest.    I don't mean that as a dig at you.

It's an essential aspect of the human condition.|`|seU9VwIJaa	People come here looking for reassurance and sadly, don't want to hear the truth. I was shocked when a lady said she wanted to put her 3 1/2 month old puppy to sleep because her 3 year old son was bit after he grabbed the dog and twisted his leg around. She was SO mad that people said to teach the son manners and that she shouldn't have let him play with the puppy if he didn't know how.   I also love anyone begging for reassurance after purchasing a mutt and calling it a designer dog. While there is no way to stop their answers, people will learn in the long run what advice they really should have followed. My mother always told me people will hear what they want to hear. If they don't hear anything that sounds good to them, they will twist the answer.|`|QUkXsPNIaa	I think the same thing all the time. It's a shame, the worrying thing is: they seem just stupid enough to take the bad advise that they choose as best, and apply it to their poor dog.    It's sad. It really is.|`|QV6swGUMaa	ya cant really if ya get a bad answer give it a thumbs down.|`|24CFl7sjaa	You can't, sometimes I think that the clueless people who ask the questions have already made their minds up what they want the answer to be so they will pick the one that matches their own opinion most closely.   However, there are those of us who do read all the answers to certain questions to gain knowledge that we can put to good practice, so even if you are dealing with a fool who has asked a daft question, someone else may have benefited without your knowledge.|`|zSOnXtiQaa	People who ask those questions want people to say that what they are doing is ok. So they pick the answer they wanted to hear. Sad =(|`|4ba573d10043e0b2f1d30e9ba0bb3383aa	Liligirl should get the best answer here! However she forgot the most important question of all... My pet is sick what should I do? Take it to the vet!|`|YdJgrgvdaa	it's impossible because only the asker of the question can decide which answer they think is best and alot of people do just answer with short answers just for the Point, sad really because alot of the people who ask questions do genuinely not know the answer and have absolutely no idea they are picking the wrong answer.|`|xhqKLSwCaa	I hope your not wasting your time.  Well informed owners who take the time to train and care properly for thier dogs have happier healthier pet/owner relations.  Choose the best answer for the question not the answer you "want" to hear.
syT3XUAraa	http://snapshot.parade.com/main.php?g2_v...  That picture was kind of a joke!    The actual hybrid would be called a pitoodle, however I can't find a picture of one.

When you cross any dog with a poodle, you will almost always get a curly-haired dog with the build of the other breed. So with a pitoodle, you would most likely get a curly-haired pit bull. And when you cross any dog breeds, even poodles, you will get cross-bred mixes.    When you say "weinerdoodle", do you mean:    Dachshund X Poodle: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/doxiepoo.htm  or  Weimaraner X Poodle: http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/weimardoodle...|`|csDhZDvraa	Of course its a mutt. What else would it be? Puppy millers apply names to them to trick ignorant buyers into thinking they are getting a purebred dog when infact they are getting a poorely bred mutt.    NONE. I do not EVER support the intentional mixing of breeds for profit.    Why dont you get a Pitt or a Poodle? Mixing the breeds will dilute both their good traits and most likely produce a puppy with all the bad traits of the parents.|`|bIaywrBCaa	I am sure it has been made already.

There is another that has all the "ingredients" listed for you to custom mix your own. It is definately sickening.  BTW, thse start in price at $750.00,  while the champion bred, health tested guaranteed registered puppies of poodle, dachshund, and various other popular poo ingredients are listed at much lower or equal prices. There is one that claims their goldendoodles are AKC reg. pups. WHAAA?  Just for curiosity I called. You get a "copy" of their papers, the breeder tried some BS line that the breeder always keeps the original, that it was required by AKC.  Nice, huh?|`|5dDNqwlzaa	ZOMG.  WHAT ABOUT POODLEDOODLES?  THAT NAME SOUNDS SO CATCHY PEOPLE WILL LOVE IT!  IT WILL HAVE ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS AS A REGULAR POODLE, BUT REMEMBER SINCE IT'S MIXED IT'S *HYPOALLERGENIC* and unique and all  your neighbors will shake with envy!  It comes in three sizes too!  Mini, Micro, and Super-Tiny-Mousesized!  The Perfect Pet to hang on a keychain or hang out with the hamster!|`|JGq9rKBOaa	If poodles went extinct, it would make me a very happy woman.|`|M2tMIqBcaa	Why can't you just adopt a poodle mix? There's enough dogs in the world already, not to mention most need homes!  (plus, I hate poodles when people shave them to look like puffball freaks! If they were meant to look like that, they would! But they don't! so leave the puffball breed alone! They're probably a beautiful breed, but we can't see the kind inside over the blow-dried hair! I CAN'T STRETCH THIS ENOUGH!!!!!)
NUIrBHXgaa	Ghost shrimp will eat whatever food the fish in the tank miss which really helps keep the tank clean. The only other thing shrimp really need are hiding spots. Little caves and places like that where they hide, especially after they molt, since they are very delicate and easily harmed by fish after molting.    As said shrimp don't add much to the bio load of a tank. So you could fit a quite a few in there.  Ide say around 5 would be good for your tank.|`|JGq9rKBOaa	Pretty much as many as you want - ghost shrimp don't really add much to the bioload at all.    Maybe start out with 4 or 5.|`|TjLCnxkKaa	If your tank is cycled I would go with 5. They need no special care, they will eat the food that falls to the gravel.
1y1c5QWHaa	He did that because he's afraid of you. He doesn't trust you, so he won't go near you. Here's something you can do:  Get one of his favorite treats. Put it between your index and your middle fingers, (so he doesn't have to go over you fingers to get to the treat), and put it around six inches away form his face. If you keep your hand there for a while, eventually he will walk towards you and start investigating you. Do this as many times as needed until he's comfortable with you, (meaning when you put your hand in his cage with the treat between your fingers, he walks right up to you). Once he's like that, then put the treat in your hand, and it should work.    Hope this helps you!

IrdZKYT3aa	Nope, I work at petsmart, we can't accept the liability of handling your fish.  It's going to be about 30-40 bucks to ship them over night, depending on how far across state or whatever.  It needs ot be an over nighter or they may not make it.  Someone has to be at the other end to care for them ASAP as well.  At least that's what most on line fish sellers state, so if it's really far, I don;t know how much luck you're going to have.  Best of Luck!      EDIT:        About two weeks ago, "friend of fish" asked a similar question, "Gary C" responded with:          "Airport-to-airport shipment is easy for any amount of fish, but economically not worth it if you are shipping only a few fish, because the airlines have a minimum charge that would be quite expensive for just a small package. Airlines in the U.S. (I don't know about Canada) only accept freight from "known shippers." This is a post-9/11/2001 security regulation. I'm not sure how you become a "known shipper," although I know some fish breeders who are "known shippers." I assume you would need to ask the individual airline what its rules are.    I have shipped and received fish and invertebrates by USPS and UPS, but never internationally. It's another case where the post office or the company itself would need to be consulted in advance."    Hope this helps!|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Ship them for where to where  ? Are you buying fish from them or are you asking them to ship fish you already have ?     Either way I don't think they do that.     If you want a place to buy fish from cheap and have them shipped buy online form this site.   http://www.liveaquaria.com/Otherwise its any ones guess as to if they will or not. I doubt it.    If your shipping the its gonna be hard and probably cost you as much to buy them brand new where you are going. Unless you have a real rare group of fish or you are REALLY attached to them its not economically sound to ship them.|`|KpNpVnXeaa	I don't think that Petsmart does that.  Also, a good pet company will usually ship them UPS of FEDEX overnight.  Make sure they are guaranteed shipped alive.      On the internet I would search for 'live fish'    Also, believe it or not, many sell fish on ebay.  Again, search 'live fish' .   Make sure they are guaranteed delivered alive.       Although shipping fish is not the best way to get fish, it works.  I still suggest that you go to your local fish/pet store and look there.

She would then know that it is a source of lava. also, leave it slightly damp on the tip. she will lick it and realize that she can get water from it. my june learned that way.  jade, i think that means there was only a bowl of water.|`|BaNrweQ4aa	if she won't drink out of the water bottle; try her with a bowl. if she won't drink with a bowl you can just put a bit of water on a surface and just try to get her to drink it :) maybe put some water in the palm of your hand aswell and give her lots of exercise so she will really want some water. maybe she is just settling in and does drink the water - just not when anybody is around because she is just getting used to things :)|`|AyOM41obaa	What petstore??|`|mXEOcSeuaa	Put her mouth next to the bottle and squeeze it a little bit.

AA10229248	Any good breeder will be listed with the breed's parent club. If you want a breeder in or near your area, you can also visit any upcoming dog shows and talk to the exhibitors.    Your breeder should belong to the breeds parent club or at least a local all-breed club.     The breeder should be involved in some form of sanctioned competition with their dog(s). Conformation or some form of dog sport that is popular with the breed. Such as border collies competing in herding trials or terriers competing in earth dog trials.    The breeder should give you a reasonable period of time to have your pup checked by a veterinarian to determine if it is healthy.     Breeders should give you written instructions on feeding, training, care and grooming. The breeder should also supply you with basic information about the breed. You should also receive the pup's health and vaccination records.     A good breeder will ask that the pup be returned to them or placed with new owners that meet their approval if, for some reason, you are not able to continue ownership.     A good breeder will interview you to make sure you are right for their breed and their particular pups.    Breeders should allow you to visit their premises and should be able to show you a clean environment, well socialized pups and a dam with a good temperament.     Breeders should be willing to give you references names of people who have purchased puppies from them in the past.     Breeders should provide a contract or some written, signed conditions of sale. You should also get a copy of your puppy's pedigree and you should be able to see a copy of the AKC Registration Application Form.     Breeders will often require that your pet quality dog be spayed or neutered when it reaches the correct age and may withhold registration paper work until proof is provided.|`|AA10029366	Plenty has been written on the subject of finding a good dog breeder, so I won't spell it all out.

There are 40 dogs that die in the shelter in 4 minutes.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	CHeck the AKC parent breed club sites.  They have breeder referrals and you may have to wait, but it will be worth it.  Do some research and see what health issues those breeds are prone to and then make sure the breeder is testing for it and that the results are acceptable.  The breeder should be involved in conformation or field trials, should be offering at least a one year health guarantee against congential defects, should register the dogs with the AKC, should allow you to visit (although many breeders won't allow you in the room with the pups until they are almost ready to go for fear of parvo- I have had some ask me to remove my shoes and scrub my hands, but that is pretty reasonable) should allow you to see the mother, and should be able to speak frankly about the lines and the issues with the lines (and all lines have issues- there are no perfect dogs).  Ask about a spay/neuter contract, etc...

Only 20 Clumbers. 68 E.Setters.  The same month 4,079 YT's were! SEE the difference?|`|x8Vgu6acaa	Start off by going to AKC.org Find your local breed club. they can give you references.  Also look for shows or trials in your area.  go to some and meet the breeders.    The price of the pup has no bearing on the quality.  Many BYB's will charge the same price or more for a poorly bred dog as what you would pay for a well bred one, because they don't understand what quality is.  They just think.  Oh, I see Clumber spaniels sell for XX so that is what a clumber is worth.  But they don't put in the investment of genetic testing, competing to prove the quality of the parents or anything.    Prior to looking for a breeder, research the breed.  Find out what health problems are in that breed and what tests are available for them.  Then when you contact the breeder, you will know what tests to ask for.  If they say, "I don't do any testing because my lines don't have any issues."  Then run for the door.|`|Da69ulcraa	Try the AKC.org, they can help you find local breeders in your area. Good luck!|`|0kh2HEFMaa	Look at the puppies parents and see how they act and how healthy the look. 90% of a dogs temperment comes from their parents and 10% comes from traning. Same with health. You may want to ask them if you can hang out with the puppy and its parents for a while to see the temperment. Heres a few questions to ask:    Is there any genetic problems with the parents or bloodlines?   Do you breed for conformation, temperment, looks, or all 3.   Ask to see the parents' pedigrees (papers/bloodlines).   Is there a contract to sign, and whats in the contract.   Is there a health guarantee, if so what does it cover?   What do you feed the puppies?   What shots have been given and can I see the vet paperwork to prove it?   What vet do you use?   Do you have any references?   Can I have my vet look at this puppy before I buy?|`|0hTvKlD5aa	Go to the AKC page of the breed you want, there should be a link to some of the breeders they have registered.|`|SHgqq6ruaa	Adopt...DON'T SHOP!  There a too many animals being killed every day for people to not adopt!  You can find specific breeds to adopt, too.  You just have to research it.|`|d857a9e7089a4eae34802fd48931e712aa	Adopting's best. However, some options are:  1) Look at AKCs website for a list of recommended breeders.  2) Try googling the breed you are looking for, and going to the web page of the national club for that breed (most purebreds will have a club even if they are not AKC recognized). The members of the breed club can help you find a reputable breeder near you.    Most reputable breeders need you to sign a contract, and will actually vet you to make sure you'll be a resonsible owner. I would avoid puppy websites as much as possible. that being said, some good breeders do advertize on these sites.    Reputable breeders :  1) want to know more about you to make sure you'll take care of the dog  2) make you sign a sterilization contract so you don't become a backyard breeder  3) will allow you to come meet their dogs in person, and usually have either the sire or dam, and preferably both on site.    good luck|`|msAh2tItaa	first i would search your local shelters or rescues for the breeds you are looking for if you cant find them then please make sure any breeder you buy from does not breed the dogs more than once a year preferably once every two years. ask to see the parents on the owners property in the enviorment that they normally live in. if the area is dirty overcrowded or if the owners have several adult breeding pairs that they breed constantly then you are probably looking at a backyard breeder. you should also ask if the puppies will come with a health gaurantee so if there are genetic problems the breeder is reqiured to A take the dog back and replace it with a healthy puppy or B get there vet to fix whatever is wrong with the puppy.|`|yEUo24Znaa	If you do not feel like you are being interrogated and applying for a million dollar loan, you are probably not dealing with a breeder of quality dogs.  Never buy a dog from anyone who will just sell you whatever pup you want when you show up after a phone call long enough to get directions.  Never buy from anyone who can not tell you individual temperaments of each puppy and asks you TONS of questions about what, why where how, etc. Don't expect to go pick up a puppy on an initial visit with a breeder. You may need to be pre screened and approved and be on a waiting list.|`|ti8L5zryaa	If you simply must have a purebred, check out the American Kennel Club or the UKC website, and they can help you look for reputable breeders.  Whatever you do, do not buy from the pet store or a backyard breeder that advertises in the paper.  Best of all, adopt from a rescue or shelter.|`|bb8bd31e3c6a83fb0b4cb346c8e5005aaa	Always make sure they are licenced and can provide you with credible sources.

I know I found a few pure breeds at the humane society when I last went.|`|TDKwUpisaa	With all the dogs put down every day I say dog breeders are just plain cruel. There are pure-breads in shelters, I had a pure bread german shepard who was about to be put down and turned out to be a great dog. The akc is a terrible organazion because there are already so many dogs in the world whos lives end because people like you decide they want to go to a dog breeder instead of a shelter where dogs are being put down constantly.

yAlyAt8Zaa	HI,    Im 16, and I still have a hamster. I actually have two dwarf hamsters. They are great. I would recoment getting them. They are so cute. I still have the time for school and stuff, and I also am still interested.     If you do get dwarfs, be careful:    They are small    Their small size makes it hard to hold them.    They run quickly.    Im not sure if this is with all hamsters(mostly dwarfs) but my dwarf hamsters are very picky. They only want one type of bedding. Lol, so make sure that if you do get it, you find a bedding they like. If they dont like one, try another, until you find the right one. This also happens with food, toys, nesting material, and prabably sometimes even hamster cages.      Hope this helps!!!      Good luck with your syrian hamster.    :)|`|ktVkRc3Raa	If you really love your hamster you would not be thinking about his death   already. They normally die around 2-3 years old. And you probably might not be interested in hamsters at the time you are 16 but it all depends on your personality.     I still have a hamster and I am 12 but my hamster just had 9 babies. But I will totally still love hamsters when I am an adult. I am even thinking about when I have kids, giving them a hamster of their own to take care of so they can learn responsibility.|`|geMe9kSNaa	Im 15 right now about to be 16 in like less than 2 months. And I wouldn't mind having a pet hamster I think there pretty cute.|`|gTXUcd1maa	It really depends. You should wait and see. Maybe maybe not. For now, just love your little hammy. Good luck!!|`|xyPpruSjaa	We, the people of Yahoo!Answers, cannot figure out if you will have the time or if you will even care for hamsters when you are 16. You have to figure that out for yourself. Are you a total animal lover (like me lol!)? If you are, you probably will still love him when you're 16.     As for life span, hamsters usually live to 1-3 years old. When they are 3 years old, it's kind of like being 90 to the hamster.     Good luck!|`|LGDpt4jUaa	Hamsters are not that difficult to take care of. You change their food and water everyday.

ur5wDhkMaa	I rescued one a couple of days ago and was advised on Y/A that it may indeed feed on your fish. Mine is on probation, but it only has one claw, so I'm personally not sure.

If it's a USA signal crayfish, I wouldn't put it in a tank with anything else. Whilst most inclined to eat spawn (eggs) and already dead creatures, you can't trust them and they can easily attack and eat your other fish.    The European freshwater crayfish is a lot less aggressive but you would still need to think about it and get advise from your local pet store.    If you want to keep crayfish as well and live in the USA, get a pond and let them breed then every so often you cant trap some and have a gourmet feast. Better that then they have a gourmet feast on your tank fish|`|pWA3gybAaa	he will try to catch them if they get too close,    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALrq9_fuz...|`|CCqqTw6paa	it will try to catch and eat them  id be wary of the gourami (kissing ones i assume) they are abit slow and move awkwardly|`|tFUpMSOcaa	no, they're not a problem... but yeahh they sometimes jump out onto other creatures, but thats always the rare case. dont worry too much|`|7Tq7EbFnaa	crayfish will eventually eat everything in your tank that's big enough to go into his mouth, not a good idea. if you want crayfish keep them in a separate tank for crustaceans.|`|saRsW1gLaa	my blue crayfish ate 2 comet goldfish on me last night actuallybut some of the other fish it doesnt bother with its hit or miss with crayfish|`|Z5HhcBJGaa	They will definitely have slower moving fish given half the chance, and i would recommend a large tank also.

AA11592942	you need to draw up a porposal and go to your town office and ask to be put on the city counsils agenda.  You need approval from the city or town. they will want to know who is going to put up the fences and clean up the mess. They may also be concerned about any insurance problems.

cKzaMGXJaa	Absolutely NO,  It is a holistic food(human grade ingredients) though and made with good quality ingredients.  Human grade means it is like the normal food we buy for ourselves in the grocery stores, the meat can contain hormones used to speed growth  and antibiotic, and animalls are vaccinated against disease, the fruit in vegetables in the regular section  made use of fertizlers and pesticide  to increase quantity and  to prevent insect damage    Most grocery stores have seperate section for their organically produce  foods which are higher in price, and that is the type that is used in what is called "Organic" dogfood    Organics is human grade as well but it also documented and proven not to have hormones and anitibiotic and no vaccines in the animals used for producing the meat and grains vegetables, fruits are grown with the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides    Organic foods are much more expensive to produce as the ingredients have to be certified and even for grains soil testing has to be done and recorded while the grain is still growing, the high cost is due to all the paperwork and inspections that are done along the as a result the dog food manufacturer  had to reduce costs by lowering the meat content of organically produced foods, so they are very low in protein unless they are using soy to increase the protein amounts       The page gives a listing of the organic foods and a description  and the picture of the seal that is used to signify a food is organic,    The companies that produce also make holistic food, so if you want only organic you have to look for the USDA organic seal on the bag  http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...

PgQ8dR7baa	I just got a new syrian hamster today, and I had an old cage like you.  Pet shop advised to get a new cage which was bigger and had more than one storey for the hamster.    If you are getting a new hamster, I would get a new cage especially for him/her and its all a new start for you.  You need a fairly big cage as they can get quite big and needs lots of room to run around in.  My pet shop also advised that I buy an exercise ball for the hamster to run around in when I clean its cage.  Its done nothing but sleep mind you since I got it home !!    Have fun, they are great pets.|`|ouhv66YSaa	its not really that big :S you could consider getting a dwarf hamster (russian dwarf etc...)|`|BaNrweQ4aa	you could buy a bigger cage or try to mend it. it looks a bit small to be honest, but if you buy a dwarf hamster then that would have a lot more room :) if you wanted to use the old cage for a bit though; while the hamster is still quite young and small - that would be fine. disinfected cages are fine :)|`|g9DWi0DKaa	that is a bit small for a syrian hampster but a dwarf hampster is fine|`|OhpbLfdraa	if its clean and desinfected yes but you should make sure its really desinfected because the other hamster may have had a disease|`|nab78vo7aa	When I first got my Syrian, he was in a smaller cage.

AA10029366	First thing to remember: Siberian huskies are NOTHING like Golden Retrievers.    Your Golden came when called. A Siberian won't.  Your Golden worshipped the ground you walked on. A Siberian won't.  Your Golden was content to lie in the grass all day and snooze when nobody was home...A Siberian won't be.  Your Golden was trustworthy with your cats....A Siberian might eat them, unless he's taught very early on and very sternly that it's not acceptable.    And then he still might.    Your Golden would never think of trying to escape through your fence, by chewing through it, climbing it, or digging under it...if a Siberian is bored and unexercised, he certainly will think of it. And probably do it.    Do plenty of research on this breed. Find a responsible breeder in your area and talk to them about your family, yard, and cats. See what they think. Visit their kennel and meet their dogs, in order to get a feel for the breed.    Sites you need to look at:  http://shca.org/shcahp2b.htm  http://shca.org/shcahp2a.htm  http://www.kaylenbergsiberians.com/ready...  http://www.siberianhuskyclub.com/abouthu...    Finding responsible breeders in your area:  http://shca.org/shcahp4f.htm  http://shca.org/shcahp4e.htm    Don't get me wrong, Siberians are wonderful dogs. I wouldn't have a kennel full of them if I didn't think so. But too many people get this breed because they love its looks -- and then dump it in rescue when they realize that it *isn't* a Golden Retriever in a wolf suit. Please don't be one of them. :)|`|AA10229248	Huskies often have a high prey drive and often go after cats. Even cats they were raised with. There is no guarantee a puppy that gets along with a cat will still get along into adulthood.    Huskies are totally different from goldens. Do LOTS of homework on the breed.    Huskies can not be trusted off leash unless in a securely fenced area. Ever.    Huskies are known to go over, under or through fences.    Huskies need physical AND mental stimulation.    Huskies shed - profusely.    For more information, check out this site:    http://www.shca.org/shcahp2b.htm|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Huskies are very different . I have been around a lot of them. They are beautiful, but they are hunters. Watch out for the cats. If this is a puppy make sure U introduce them carefully in a small room where U have control over everything that happens. Have the pup on a leash, and never let it think it is allowed to chase the cats. I have witnessed two huskies playing "streach-the-cat" and it is not fun.   Make sure U read dog training books and go to dog school. Plan on doing a lot of walking, hiking , ball playing and dog sledding -- this is what they were born for. Good luck.|`|UeaZY4BTaa	They tend to have a high prey drive, so make sure the one you take home is used to cats. Also, the ones I've met have been very high active, so be prepared for a jogging buddy that goes all day! They also tend to wander, but as long as you're fence is high enough, that shouldn't be a problem. They are quite a bit different from a golden retriever as they have a more domineering personality as a rule. With proper training and good handeling, you'll have a wonderful, loyal pet!|`|H3J6bN0Yaa	I would strongly recommend a puppy rather than an adult otherwise you might end up with no cats as they are highly predatory dogs. The younger the better for integrating them successfully.  They moult terribly at certain times of year so lots of grooming is required. Your house ends up being covered in hair during these periods no matter how much you groom.   They can run for miles and miles and requires a lot of exercise to keep them content. They will require an awful lot more exercise than a retriever.   They don't usually like being left for very long alone as they have strong pack instincts.|`|7c000cf444eb1024a5936f1c7f912a15aa	Huskies are nothing like your Golden. They are beautiful dogs but they are also a working breed that has twenty times more energy the a classroom full of toddlers. They have boundless amounts of energy and if you do not drain it you will have an unhappy and destructive dog. In recent years Huskies have risen on the CDC bite list as being a biter. All too often people get these dogs because of their looks and can not provide for them properly.A fenced yard is nice but not a way to exercise this breed alone. You have to make sure they get lots and lots of exercise. My brother use to have me run his Huskies in the morning for over an hour. I was a marathon runner and 10 miles of running really did not do the trick when they were younger. He would also run them to miles at night. If they did not get that his house got chewed up and trashed, or he had some unruly dogs.   Also if Huskies get lose they are gone, they have no homing instinct and will keep on going. They are the best long distance runners you will ever find. They also have a high prey drive so having peace with the cats is going to take work. My brothers one dog was raised as a puppy with their cat and they are fine together. The other is a rescue and he hates the cat. Both dogs dislike other cats.     They can be great dogs but they take a great deal of work and energy. I would recommend basic obedience classes. Huskies are smart but not in an obedient way. They are naturally smart but that does not mean they will take to doing what you want. They will not train as easy as your Golden, so the basic classes will help and help with socializing and draining some mental energy.    Honestly, if your energy levels do not match a huskies do not get one. No one will be happy. My brother's one Husky just turned 13 year old and his energy level is the same as it was when he was 1.|`|DgTES11eaa	Be prepared for lots and lots of running!  Also, lots of chew toys that are strong.  And brush your husky many times per week to avoid having a fur coat when you leave the house.
bseGACNXaa	Perhaps try some different bowls.  We settled on bowl stand and steel bowl that lifts the height of the bowl from the floor.  There are also steel bowls with rubber on the bottom so they can't move.  A more expensive option is the bowls that circulate water and filter it continuously.  There are too many germs and soaps in the toilet or shower.  Maybe keep a bowl of water in the bathroom and put the puppy out of the room with a firm no! if he starts drinking from those other places.  Also, your house may be a little warm and perhaps keep the puppy's hair trimmed shorter and buy some sweaters for going outside in the winter.  You should be due for a vet visit soon so you can try these things and ask the vet for some more ideas.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Toilet water may have chemicals. You might need to have the vet check him if he actually seems super thirsty. If he spills his water, is he drinking or just spilling? Does it need to be freshened, or does it have chlorine in it. My dogs like their water to sit a spell to remove the chlorine. But if they are thirsty on a hot day, they will just drink it anyway.    Close the toilet lid. Keep it that way. Yorkie could drown.|`|sO6b24Aeaa	Its fine. My dog does that too. and he is a yorkie mixed with a poodle. I think if your concerned about it you should take him to the vet but other wise the dog will be fine=]|`|OtfSP7kHaa	You're full of it.  My Yorkie (full grown) can't reach the toilet.  She can jump in the tub but I let the water out after a bath.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Close the toilet lid and crate him when anyone is bathing (or close the door). Toilets are full of nasty chemicals an the water isn't too healthy either.    Buy a heavier bowl with some type of metal or lead base that prevents him from spilling it.|`|PYSMK0JBaa	how does a yorkie reach the water in the toilet?|`|xSvhOv6caa	Have you had him checked for a medical problem if he is that thirsty?  Diabetes??
AA12281930	my gerbil is taking the guinea pig from down the street out for a romantic meal.....|`|Jguzosm2aa	I have far too many pets to buy gifts for something like V-day. Around Christmas I buy some extra treats and new toys, but beyond that, no gifts for the holidays.|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	For Valentine's?  Nothing really :( (except entering them in a photo contest *g*).  I get them pressies for their birthdays and x-mas, usually, but am a cheapskate on other holidays :)|`|mXEOcSeuaa	I can't afford to do anything special for them.  If I could I would though.
AA10554698	Put up a fence...either an invisible electronic one or a physical one.  Dogs don't know boundries, or property lines.  You may not like the idea but a leash (not a lease) on a clothes line is not an inhumane idea.|`|0bb9a919e42b42531162180bccba925faa	Fence or Pen. There is always those overhead trolley leads that run on a 75ft line if you want- and the lead is long enough to lay down but not long enough to hang himself on. Attach between two trees. Or a pole and a building. The electric fence is a great tool, put a collar on him that emits a lite zap when he gets close to the perimeter where the wire is buried. Its battery operated and safe. And inexpensive compared to traditional fencing.|`|AA11394073	what do you mean he doesn't stay in the yard? doen't your backyard have fences?|`|OHGw05bfaa	That's a hard one. Your going to have to show him that its a good thing to be in the yard. But for the time being, install electric wire around the fence. Run a slight electric wave through it, so if it tries to get out of the yard it will get a soft little warning tap and will stay away from the fence.     Also try to show it the benefits of being in the yard. And punish the dog severely when it leaves the yard.|`|d8043f9c983ac001a490a18c9fc2a60aaa	You can still teach him not to go outside the property,better to have a yard for them, you cannot be too careful,|`|54319842411b9530860c8267b97fe375aa	I use a shock collar. I know many say it is inhumane, but I don't agree. I made sure I shocked myself on the throat to see what I could tolerate. I don't shock them to mean. I just tap the button so they know their boundaries. When you put the collar on him/her you have to make it a fun thing. I got a DVD with mine, and it showed you the best way. I swear this on my life. When I go and get the collars my dogs get hyped up, one because they know I am going outside, and two because they get to run without being on a leash!... When they go to far I holler for them, if they don't come back I put it on the lowest setting and call again, no response I give them a little shock... seriously the thing has never went past the level two setting. Dogs get distracted when they are outside, they just need a little reminder when their attention is elsewhere. It doesn't hurt either... just sends a little tickle, and their attention is back on you.|`|d0TTHW1Xaa	Teach an old dog some new tricks...obedience school|`|UF7Z3aVYaa	If you dont have a fence yet get one. Sit outsidee and watch him if he trys to get away disop;en him. like use a squirt bottle of put hime in a kenel. Once you do that for awhile he will figure it out. also make sure he is hurt during the disoplen. Let him have a treat os something if he stays.
z9hRuFDiaa	I have one (her name is Sasha) and she is a great dog. You need to make sure that your puppy is properly trained, which is really simple. All you have to remember is that you and your family comes first, so when you feed your dog, make him or her sit and wait for you to give the signal to eat. Little things like that show your puppy that you are the boss(or pack leader). Once you've done that, your dog will be loyal and loving.     http://www.peteducation.com/category.cfm...  http://www.doggybehave.com/    These links should be helpful to you.      Good luck.|`|AA12128656	i was not familiar with this breed. i looked it up and to my astonishment, these dogs look almost EXACTLY like my junkyard dogs!! (except my avatar, Woodchuck- his mother isn't one of mine)  except that they have Dane in them, which i'd never use, health is MOST important in a dog, and they have WAY too many problems, and mine are only buckskin, brindle, or chocolate. no black.    so very very weird. i think someone stole ace's dogs back in the day...    anyhow, what do you want this dog for? this isn't a normal "big dog"- you better know what you're doing, or else you're going to have a serious liability on your hands.  an experienced trainer to teach you everything about large dominant breeds is a helpful place to start BEFORE you get a pup.  and if you're thinking about bite training one of these guys, think again. you're setting yourself up for a lawsuit.      ADD:::: this dominant breed dog won't get along with ANYONE if it's not properly socialized, no matter what puppyfinder tells you.|`|qioH81tiaa	It always worries me when people ask about breeds like this on here.  Breeds like the Cane corso, this one, and other "guard" dogs - breeds that are obviously big, strong, dominant dogs, that need an experienced owner.    Why does it worry me?  Because if you have to ask on here, you are no where NEAR ready for this breed.      Find a reputable breeder near you.  Talk to them.  Go visit.  And when they tell you  that you are not ready to handle a breed like this, listen to them.    Add: like many other things, size doesn't matter when it comes to dog breeds.  TEMPERAMENT matters.    Add: ah yes, puppyfinder, the bastion of all that is good in the dog world.  That was sarcasm, by the way.  Really, the more you add, the more it tells me you are NOT ready for any dog, let alone a dominant one.|`|QCj4QA4yaa	Yeah, arent those biiiiiigg, with huuuuuuuuge gigantic caaakkss, that if u want, they can do u well??????
0176bec1190980db12bdb38e1453e112aa	I personally have tried putting the food dish in a bigger bowl filled with water and a touch of vinegar or a bit of cinnamon. Results are okay until the water evaporates before i notice. You can also use a general insecticide on the porch area such as Suspend or Talstar. These wont only get rid of the ants running around in that area but also any other little creepy crawly trying to get a free snack from your kitty. You can get these products from DoMyOwnPestControl.com  It is best to start treating the troublesome area before an active ant population has started taking over.|`|0RGcf4yiaa	I know the PetSmart I work used to sell them but I don't know if they still do or what they are called but the concept was pretty basic. Just buy a large stainless steel bowl, and then buy a small bowl. And float the small bowl with food in the large bowl, you don't need so much water that the small bowl tips over. Or u could attack the small bowl in the middle of the large bowl and then their is sort of a water resevoir around the food.|`|qeNU8caBaa	there's nothing you can do to help that.  i'm assuming the cat goes outside when you aren't there.  the best thing to do is feed the cat before you leave and when you come home.  otherwise, you'll be wasting cat food everyday.
AA10072754	I would after I bring in a shot gun and blow your head off=) and then take your dogs.      oh and to enlighten you bluemoon.......    shar pei is a fighting breed also|`|NgXqGCOsaa	Yeah only cowards pit animals together for money and entertainment why don't you jump in with the both of them and see if you would win. Get a life!|`|2f5c15b9c30c3347c0194035712d2faaaa	They should jump you for askin!|`|167db7cd488d6db5d40b385fe3207723aa	Hypothetically....  First, it depends on the breed of the pit bull. If it is a gamebred American Pit Bull Terrier, no breed stands a chance. Any other breed type of pit bull would still have the upper hand but it would depend on the dog itself, not the breed.  Of course, the old time dogmen who matched dogs when it was legal would tell you it is completely unfair to put a breed other than an APBT in the pit with an APBT.    Edited: Feeding a gamedog gunpowder is a myth... Some of those dogs are worth 10's of thousands of dollars and need to be in perfect condition.  Oh, Bluemoonfrog... as someone who (is claiming to) "trains" pit bulls, you should know it is pit bull, not pittbull. And, their jaws do not "lock."|`|9UzJEDdxaa	This is an immature question........................I pray you aren't stupid enough to try and fight the animals, and I hope you burn in Hell if you do.    Don't even joke about dog fighting.|`|Xk2SIv1raa	Dude, seriously, a pitt-bull vs. sharpei?! lmao. Pittbull totally has that one. Pittbulls were raised for fighting. They can b nice if you raise them like you would any other dog, but feed them raw meat and gunpowder...and you have a lean, mean, fighting machine. I own a pitbull, i train them, and they are the sweetest dogs when shown lots of love. But when it comes to pit vs sharpei, no brainer! And my dog is the sweetest she can be...i love her...and i would never fight her...i dont believe in putting innocent animals in against others because if someones dog killed mine, i would kill their dog, sorry. But pitts go for the neck and can kill in a matter of seconds because their jaws lock so tight, you cant get loose. Good luck, and please dont fight your dogs!! :(|`|Q59D7ZCyaa	Dogs are not aggressive by nature. Some dogs were bred as fighting dogs, and some are more prone to aggression than others.

bab6060e2ef3646bb2232cead47e2b3daa	chinchilla cat or chinchilla as in the rodents?    The rodents do not get along with cats and shouldn't be put with cats. The cats could lick the chin or scratch an eyeball.  It's just more trouble than it's worth.   Chinchillas don't need to have a friend, they can live alone fine. If you do want to get two then you should get two same-sex buddies or a female and a neutered male|`|AA10072754	Maybe....maybe not....like people chinchillas have their own likes and dislikes.  You should be more concerned bout your cats getting along with it.    Chins should only be housed with chins because  1) nutritional needs  2) theyre nocturnal  3) because only other chins will understand it  4) because temperature can't go past 80* F....so you might make any other animal uncomfy  5) if a chin feels misunderstood they will rip out their fur and possibly die    I think you need a little more research till you yourself are sure about who will make a good friend for your chilla.|`|4F1WPtJoaa	my science teacher had 2, and it was a female and a male. male was the father of the female, i think. not the point.    anyway, chinchillas are from the andes mountains and they don't get along with cats. they aren't as big of a hassle as one would think. Their bedding has to be changed about once a week, and you occasionally put a box of this dust and they "bathe in it" and that's pretty much all, besides the fact that you have to feed them, seeing as they are living creatures.     so get a 2nd chinchilla!!|`|meiRzsPjaa	well chinchillas are good with rodents and such,,, a good choice would be to get 2 chinchillas but if u don't want babys then get the same gender. another good choice would be a ferret, or a deju. Dejus eat the same food as chinchillas so you would save on the cost of food. but ferrets are good companions with most animals
2qr8uqY4aa	Hey, don't listen to those nut's who think dog's can't live out side, they come from Wolf's DUH!!    It's would be fine if you left you dog out there over night, that's why they make dog houses.    Just make sure theres enough bedding in there for him.|`|QT7nsNGLaa	Why does he need to go outside overnight?   I'd look into crate training him if there is some reason he is not good in the house overnight.    I prefer house dogs to yard dogs.    Dogs want to be with you.  Train don't complain used to be my favorite bumper sticker LOL    In cold temps. he should probably only be outside long enough to go potty and walks with you (wearing a coat on leash walks).|`|AA11693672	I have a beagle myself and would NOT leave her outside all night. The bark is the worst in the breed. The will howl all night & believe me I know. My beagle is now 4 years old so I have got to know her little tricks and misfits. The beagle's man purpose is for hunting so There are not able to withstand 0 degree weather. An alaskian Huskie- sure no prob. But not small dogs like these. Thier coats are thin and your liable to do then more bad than good leaving them outside all night in cold weather. They love the outdoors of course- but reasonable weather.|`|d33d56ca5ee795b454e4e8291ea813fdaa	hmm...thats a tough one. It is probably better for him to be inside when it is that cold. It depends how many blankets are out there.|`|AA12014845	No that is cruel. Why can't he stay inside with his family and his water and food. Its CRUEL to put a dog outside overnight.    I LOVE DOGS, if yoou really did you would keep him inside with you and your family. Another thing he isn't even a year.|`|7adc7379a96466d2f31daab7c3950d36aa	NO!  The dogiloo is way to big for a beagle.  30 degrees is very cold for a beagle.  If you must leave him outside, find a house just big enough to allow him to stand and turn around.  Give him straw, not blankets and plenty of water (not ice).  If he kicks the straw out fine.  If he is so far in the house you can't see him, give him more straw.  If he seems to be reluctant to drink water, put his dry food in the water, 1/2 cup of food to about quart of water.|`|2FS3ITyvaa	Some dogs were bred to naturally be able to endure harsh weather conditions and bear the lowest of low temperatures outdoors all year-'round.  However, Beagles aren't one of those breeds.  Dogs with a thick, heavy undercoat (such as Samoyeds, St. Bernards, Huskies, etc) were bred to be able to endure sub-zero temperatures for extended periods of time.  Of course, even with their dense undercoat, they should still have access to food and water and some form of shelter from precipitation and wind.  Beagles do not have a thick undercoat ... that thin layer of hair that they have is all they have to protect them.  Beagles were bred to be hunting/tracking dogs.  Hunting breeds were bred to be able to withstand a lot of harsh conditions (since most hunting takes place in the autumn/winter months), and are therefore very "touch insensitive".  However, they were not bred to be in the freezing cold weather, and not for extended periods of time (such as overnight).  I'd keep him inside at night and allow him to stay out in his Dogloo during the day, weather conditions permitting, of course.  Good luck with the new puppy!|`|WBEDrt8Jaa	if you always have him outside and he has a house he should be fine. but if he's a good dog and doesnt pee in the house, just let him stay inside|`|XmzSabtzaa	I'd say no.   1) He's a beagle...if he's unhappy or excited, he will definitely let you know. Loudly.   2) He's a puppy....I wouldn't leave my puppies outside at night until they were over a year old...just my rule of thumb....it may very for you. Again, he's a beagle....they tend to defy convention and do silly things like ignore the Dogloo and blankets to stand outside and bark or howl at every little thing.   3) Beagle puppies are adorable. If you have the patience, fortitude, and information to be raising one, I'm willing to bet you don't want to quit cuddling him any more at night than he does.|`|7d60c2e4179cf0fe8df7c2b55c02fd32aa	NO DOGS LIVE OUTSIDE   they are pack animals and you bought a dog to be a part of your family...  bring him inside with the family where he belongs.... if you do not wish to treat him humanely  ,, maybe you could find him a home where he will be a part of the family|`|AA10072754	For your neighbor and yard's sake...don't.  Beagles will howl and because they are strong scenthounds.....dig and possibly stick to a trail and run off.|`|c90e574ca599f1b4e81bbcb652eb421eaa	I wouldn't.  Beagles never get that really heavy winter coat that keeps dogs warm in cold weather.  They're not to bad in a warm spring but 30F is a little chilly even for my golden retriever.
DptJXo7Caa	most hoofed animals see the majority of colors and really arent all that limited by the colors they can see    the exception however is that they do not see reds as well as humans can. so their view is much bluer and greener than ours. they can still process the color red but it is far less vivid to them than it is to us.    this is supposedly beneficial to them in that it aids them in finding the freshest grass to eat.|`|qMun78M9aa	As it turns out, horses can see some color, though not all colors. They may see bright colors better. For example, according to this article, "http://www.horsewyse.com.au/howhorsesse... they see grass as "a wishy-washy greenish-grey.    They can see some colors better than others though. For example, reds are harder to see, so the majority of their view is blue and green.     The article also explains why horses sometimes get nervous in windy weather. (I've experienced that more than once!) It's because as pray animals they're always watching for moving things. When it's windy, everything is moving!     O.o Brittany|`|J7N4TX8zaa	seagreen.|`|XAIiOFkXaa	Don`t know. You would have to look through a horses eyes to know.   Things that I was taught at school about what can see what are now disproved. I reckon that thee is only the one way.  Do you think that we all see the same colour when we see say, blue or red etc.?
AA10055682	Yes, that's perfectly normal.  They are using it as a slip collar, not a choke chain (and not a slip knot... there's no knotting involved).  As other posters have said, all vets offices, shelters, dog day cares, whatever, use them to move animals around easily.  The difference with a choke chain is that you do NOT use a leash like that as a "correction" or "punishment".  It is tight and you have increased control but it does NOT cause discomfort or choke the dog.    The two main reasons you'd do this are:  1)  Easy on and off.  You just dangle the loop over the dogs head to put it on, and you don't have to reach toward the dog's neck, which many dogs interpret as threatening.  Most dogs don't like strangers grabbing at their collars.  When dealing with lots of strange dogs, this can prevent dogs from getting nervous and workers from being bitten.     2)  It's more secure than a regular collar.  Some dogs with skinny heads (think Greyhounds for one example) can have their collars slip right off no matter how tight they are.  In other cases, owners may have collars adjusted too loose.  In still others, like in shelters, dogs may not be wearing collars for safety reasons.  Using a slip leash lets the handler control that the leash is just the right amount of tight and not have to worry about whether the collar is secure.    If you were to find and catch a stray dog on the street, this is also by far the safest way to do it if you have regular leash with you.|`|y87HGa2paa	very normal-vets offices, animal shelters,  they all do it|`|e180253567d34dec8322277cb5dbf067aa	Yes, the animal shelter is cheap on stuff like that...they figure the crappy dry food costs way to much to spend money on a real leash.|`|4360cf3c4091cff956ff8bf91dd7789faa	Yes its possible, but it looks weird to me! The shelter probably dosen't have enough money to buy collars/choke chains for all the dogs to they just use the leashes. Considering the leash is a chain, it is ok but if it is fabric then it could get 'stuck'. Just a thought...|`|c90e574ca599f1b4e81bbcb652eb421eaa	The slip collar is designed, when used and positioned on the dog properly to loosen after a correction, on its own.  A slip knot doesn't do that.  Although I understand that money is tight at shelters and similar facilities, the slip collar is a relatively inexpensive tool.  I really think that they should consider having a fund drive for the $30.00 or so that it would cost to purchase some and stop endangering the animals.  Too tight a noose can cause damage to the esophagus.|`|AA10072754	Those things are horrible.  I had one and my poor dog doesn't react well to being walked with a collar.  I walk with Gentle Leader and he's doing just fine now.      Now for greyhounds and all (to the person above) these are different and animal shelters don't use them unless it is a sighthound rescue.|`|MSPK5deoaa	They do that sometimes and yes when i adopted my boxer he came to me on a leash like that they also do it at the groomers sometimes it didnt hurt them and sometimes they walk better|`|SPQLKitYaa	Yes, thats completely fine. I rescued a collie and they used a leash like a slip collar. Also, its a cheaper alternative for rescues so they can use the money that would be spent on a slip-collar for better purposes.

IrdZKYT3aa	Get him in a warm tank, if you can aerate it do so, make it easier for him to breath.  Get his temp gradually up to around 80-82 degrees, this wil help keep the water less hospitable to bacteria, fungus and parasites which may take advantage of his wound.  Definitely add some aquarium salt to his tank, it's a great stress reliever and can also help make the water less hospitable to bacteria and what not.  I'd look into some mild anit biotics, maybe a little betta fix.  Normally I say go for the real thing and get melafix, but you are just trying to help him prevent infection.  Even better is change the water regularly, this has to be kept clean with his open wound.  Make sure you have some good food on hand, in case he starts to have a loss of appetite, I feed my guys blood worms when they are sick to keep them interested and well fed.  Best of Luck!      Edit:    I'm not sure were you can get it, it's hard to find, but there is a product you can  "paint" onto a fishes wound, like our second skin banages that can seal it and help prevent infection.  We had a really old bit left that we used on an oscar who had a tank mate tear open his side pretty bad.|`|dKKgwzGraa	It needs serious help and fast. I'd suggest taking it to a vet. There's probably nothing you can do for it by yourself.          I'd also suggest that you watch your cat like a hawk. I personally would not have a cat and a fish tank in the same house together. That's just asking for trouble.|`|GIlTkQu6aa	im sorry that happend but if i were you i would take him to the vet|`|NoOM7eZnaa	We need some vital information.    Size of tank. Is it filtered and heated?    Does it have a hood? If not, you should get one.    What kinds of plants do you have?    Do you have any aquarium salt on hand?|`|F15EPx0Taa	Sorry about your betta. He might make it and he might not. I had a friend that her cat got a hold of her betta and it lost a lot of scales. And sadly it died|`|qAwnAYGAaa	its doubtful but either take it to the vet or flush it|`|OIrVUUTgaa	Yeah, take it to the vet. If it's a serious injury, which it sounds to me like it is, no amount of rest is going to fix the problem. You need to get him some real treatment fast.|`|7feafcca345dc1ba46e01adef7b6e44faa	I am so sorry this happened. There is really nothing that can be done. This happened to me once, unfortunately. Since then my new bettas are covered with a lid and on shelves that the cat cannot reach. I caught my cat in the act. He dropped the fish in the bowl...and the fish was injured badly. I spoke with two vets who both said if the injury is minor the fish will heal. If it is major he is having major difficulty swimming he will probably die.No amount of aquarium salt will help. I'm sorry....it's hard lesson learned especially if you've had the fish for years.
K2vam6Tgaa	well it depends on what things you are willing to dog for you have to walk the dog feed get lots of exercise a hamster is very easy to take care of feed him or her clean the also there are good pets to play with (not that dogs aren't) Chinchillas are pets that i do not know much about but i do know that they are very hard to take care of sometimes they can'  t get wet and so i think before you choose a pet research the kind of pets you would like find one that is a good companion and that is not that hard to take care of so have fun and just reminding you it is your choice!!!!! have fun and good luck!|`|8khZ0fJZaa	Dog!!!!! If she says absolutely no on dog, get a guinea pig.|`|2opWeKQBaa	Don't get a hamster. Hamsters are vicious little buggers... A chinchilla is the best, because they're adorable, fluffy and very funny little creatures. A dog you should get if you have time every day to walk it and play with it. Bunnies are good too..|`|lFVbACCwaa	I would go for a bunny out of those options, but if your going to get that kind of animal, I would get a guinea pig:) I have 7!|`|fzaf5t3Caa	i would either say a dog or a hamster. I know they are totally different sizes and all but dogs are always nice to have around and are very affectionate, they can be taken on walks and taught tricks, and they can go swim in a lake!!! hamsters are cute and fuzzy and they are fun to watch. They climb through their cages tubes and they go on their wheel. Rabbits and chinchillas eat wires and dont like tobeh played with as a friend. Rabbits are more un-socialable animals and chinchillas are calm and just lay in your lap. If I were you i would get a dog or a hamster or maybe a ferret. Ferrets arLekike the best pets. They play, they love, and they do sleep also!!! they are vesocial ableble and love to walk around and be curious scavangers hehehe. They are great pets i have one and he is great. Hope i helped!! Good luck =)

I had a collie before that wasn't used to going places around people, farm dog, and anytime we had to take her somewhere she got diarrhea.|`|bNOj7Up9aa	Have you changed his diet recently?   Changing foods abruptly can upset their stomach. He may be just nervous/excited. my dog always poops when I take him to a pet store or the park. He gets super excited and he'll do it in the middle of the road, an aisle, etc.
3a9f3003abdd986d136bc7307c02868faa	There is a chance that your hamster developed something such as a twisted gut which can be quite common with dwarf hamsters. However, you can find that hamsters can die from 18 months onwards purely because of old age.    I'm sorry that you lost one of your hamsters, but unfortunately this is just part of life with an animal with such a short lifespan.|`|cXK9sY1raa	Sorry about your hamster. I'm sure you took good care of them but when they get ill there is rarely much that can be done.    Your hamster might have caught Wet Tail. It's an illness that can develop very quickly and kills them just as fast. In a dwarf hamster there probably wouldn't have been much you could do, they're just so small.    She might have also had some internal bleeding. It's really hard to tell from the description.    It'd be a good idea to clean out the entire cage and disinfect it, just in case there are any germs lingering that could make Nibbles ill.    Also, please don't try and introduce another hamster to Nibbles, even if you think she is lonely. They would probably fight a lot because they don't know each other.|`|nPuZVGFRaa	Maybe Nibbles is really a boy and they breed and Bella was going to have baby's but didn't make it. I'm so sorry about your lose.|`|DufvgxE6aa	could have been wet tail or some other bacterial infection. Hamsters live 2 years on average so that is getting a bit old for a hamster could have caught something due to weakened immune system same as older people. They can also get cancer and other problems hard to say what happened but a year and a half is good i don't think it was your fault. Sorry for your loss.|`|24CFl7sjaa	I'm so sorry Bella has died, but it is nothing that you have done. Russians life span is only 18 months + so she has had her time and any time you have left with Nibbles is a blessing to you both. Bella sounds like she had the very best of a life with you, you should feel proud you took care of your pet so well.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	sorry for your loss. maybe it was just her time to go, but some russian dwarfs can live for over 3 years. mine is nearly 3|`|s5UbGOb8aa	sounds like the other hamster way have hurt her.  My hamster died unexpectedly too,i went to give him a treat to find him cold with his nose bleeding and he  had been fine so..  these things happen and totally suck  sorry for ur lose i know how you feel.    if you get another one maybe  just get one.some hamsters live better on thier own.|`|lFVbACCwaa	I am really sorry but I cant answer your question- but for Nibbles, it is best to clean tem out every week rather than once every 2 weeks. Poor Bells:(|`|qZlAv8Yraa	hamsters do that it could have died by the damp or the wet or cold     but sorry m8
C1eHfhrHaa	It probably is still sore- as long as it isn't bleeding or falling off (sometimes they get ripped out by accident and bleed quite a bit) it should be fine.  If it starting to fall off, you should take him to the vet and have it permanently removed.|`|l8Q3n8WUaa	THE BEST THING TO DO IS TAKE HIM TO A VET!!

7b6dfe25effa5d1dd067f55c35d61913aa	It can vary.  Small dogs seem to be harder than large dogs for some reason- probably because they have teeny tiny bladders that can't hold much and they have teeny tiny systems that work faster.    I recommend using a schedule and a crate.  http://www.clickersolutions.com/articles...|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	It depends - what's the age of the puppy?  How consistent are you in your training?  Are you giving lots and lots of praise for correct behaviour rather than punishing for mistakes.  If you're really good at catching the puppy and using lots of praise, most puppies can be housetrained (with occasional accidents) in 2 - 3 weeks.|`|AA10072754	depends on the breed.  Hounds I believe tend to be more stubborn than others while sporters and hearders are so willing to please that it won't take very long.    Crate training helped me alot since my pups couldn't go wandering and peeing at night.    Also don't give water at night  put them to sleep after they do their night pee so they can't get water or anything.  BUT give them water fresh in the mornings|`|Xfi7ysfxaa	A puppy takes about 2 months to get potty trained.|`|1FhX6iheaa	How long the process takes depends on the method you use.     Potty training my Yorkie pup took me about a month and she still has on occasion "accidents".    Shes 3 months old now.     The method I used were "puppy sheets" they are designed to be a "place mat" for you're pup to potty on. It does take awhile for them to get the hang of it. (1-2 weeks)    Praise and reward the puppy EVERYTIME it uses the puppy "sheets." Have lots of patience and never hit or scorn the dog if you find a puddle or feces on the floor.     Unless you catch them in  the middle of "going potty" anywhere off the sheets you can say a firm "no" with a lower tone of voice. Otherwise the pup might not understand.    Place these "puppy sheets" all around the house (preferably in almost every room) to prevent less accidents.    PetSmart and Wal-Mart are the only stores I know that carry this product.     Good luck! :)|`|37YOe6uHaa	Hi ,  Well i found this really helpful guide ,its a really professional training called sit stay fetch , to teach you how to train your dog by yourself ,  http://dogobediencetraining.co.nr  , its a easy step by step book  Hope this helps you with your dog

8258df383388e301d876365e52f67999aa	These dogs are ridiculous.  Basically you are paying good money for a mutt! A dog that you cannot register with any reputable registry and is definately NOT of breeding quality.  If you are in the market for a mutt, PLZ visit ur local  Humane Society, there are thousands of dogs there. All in need of a loving home.    Niiiiice ... Im loving the poster opting for purebred because u can "make money" Now she must be a real dog "lover" *sigh* this is what it has come to... making money off our pets?|`|QT7nsNGLaa	Neither.   Designer "breeds" are mixes that you don't know which breed they'll take after.    Germoodle?   German Shepard-Poodle perhaps?  GSDs are herding/guard dogs.   Poodles are water retriever/companion dogs.   Both VERY high energy and both bark a lot AFAIK   Both can be shy/nervous.   GSDs are prone to several health ailments including hip dysplaysia a mix can still get all the health problems.    A Poodle mix can have a major coat to groom.   Standard Poodles and large Poodle mixes cost at least $75 every six weeks to groom in my area.    Boxkita  I'm guessing Boxer-Akita  Boxers are guard-companions  High energy and usually nice dogs.   But prone to cancer and gas attacks.  Akitas are guard dogs that often dislike strangers and may attack people or other dogs if they aren't raised right , socialized and trained.  In the right hands Akitas are great dogs.  But Akitas also have thick coats and need grooming.    I would never pay money for a mix.   I would adopt from Petfinders or the local shelter or rescue.    If I wanted a purebred dog to rescue I'd Google and find the local club for my breed and use their rescue.|`|YDKCZzwsaa	They both are odd combinations. Personally though, I'd go with the germoodle, because believe it or not, poodles are pretty viscious.|`|3c0b3d6fa5b09468e70f4e4342d78fefaa	neither, i like golden retrievers, they are the best!|`|7JSbzm3vaa	What is that a German Shepard/Poodle and a Boxer/Akita? I don't know, doesn't sound like very responsible breeding to me. All dogs need loving homes though so I would go with which ever one you think will go well with your life style. Research all four dogs and find out as much as you can before you make your choice.|`|AA11382927	Well....it depends normally if you have a full blooded dog you don't find many health issues and can breed and make more money off of it's your decision which dog's personality you like better but if u choose a mixed dog u are takin gyou chances because sometimes they have health problems and if you want to breed you can't make any money off of them like you could with a full blooded but it your decision not mine Good Luck :)|`|AA11728843	Neither,,go to your local animal shelter & adopt a pound puppy!|`|hFmwtEizaa	I would get a mut from the shelter for 500 dollars less and a probably healthier dog and not benefit some creep making money off his poor female dog (it filters out) and whatever the next door neighbors dog is.|`|AA12014845	Well I don't like poodles and boxers but I would pick the one you want it is really not our decision.

It is true that COOKED bones become brittle and splinter when eaten, which is what causes the problem. UNcooked bones are generally fine, although if your dog is not used to eating bones, I wouldn't recommend weight bearing bones (i.e. cow femur), unless you are giving it as a recreational bone (just for chewing, not eating). There are MANY MANY websites on feeding BARF (Biologicaly Appropriate Raw Food) This one -->  http://www.njboxers.com/faqs.htm...  has a lot of good Q&A and links. I have White Shepherds (3 & 4 years old), and they eat a raw diet - mostly chicken backs, turkey necks and backs, and whatever organ meat is available at the grocer. They get fruit and veggies too. They have never had any digestion problems, or any other health issues. Best part is little to NO poo to clean up. Their bodies uses almost all of the nutrients in the diet, so there is very little waste and NO odor.  Some good books to check out are:  DR.

Every single frenchie I have ever seen in for itching has been 1 of 2 things. Severe skin allergies, and food allergies.

Be sure you have time to spend the first few days at home with them. You need to constantly supervise to be sure that your older dog does not hurt her. You do not want to risk the well ebing of the puppy and introduce them slowly. Do not force them to get to know one another let them approach each other on their own they will get along better. You will find better reslts that way. But stay close by so you can stop any potential problem that may arise and remeber it may take your older dog a few days or even weeks to get used to th idea of a new pup in the house. Also avoid paying more attention to the pup than her it will make her aggression worse towards the pup. When we first started fostering animals for our local shelter my Chihuahua was fine when she first met them out side our home but when they came here it was a different story and she would follow them around growlin at them all the time. It did not matter if they were bigger than her or not. When we got our boxer she was really bad with her but now theyare best friends and love each other, well as long as the boxer remembers that the Chihuahua is the boss. Good luck to you!!!!!!!!!

Obviously, you will be a much better hermit crab owner than I was, but my hermit crabs lived for very long amounts of time.

Your dog is not getting 'tired', he is being bossy, pushy, controlling with you.  He stops and you stop to cater to him.  You are doing the normal thing trying to get him started again, but you are just playing the submissive role by allowing this behavior.    When he stops you need to keep going and don't play into his behavior or it will only get worse.  Bring some treats with you, some good ones like cheese or hot-dog pieces and reward him when he's walking with you.  When he stops and plays the "I'm not going any further" game with you you need to ignore him and keep walking.  Don't worry if you drag him a few feet, soon he'll realize that you've figured out the game and he'll magically get up and follow you.  Its amazing how little time it takes for this to work.    You also need to start working on some Obedience with your dog.  This will help in establishing leadership and the bond you want with your dog.  The sooner the better.  If you don't get your leadership worked out your dog will continue to become more and more controlling.  Nip it in the bud while it's not such a problem.  Good luck.

Remington, Petmate, and Sky air (spelled some other way) I found were really good.  Bargain hound would be ok for a cat.   Petmate and sky would be the most expensive at around maybe $20 or $30 for a small or medium.  I really like petmate and remington because of its thick plastic.    I can understand where you are coming from though wanting one like that.  When I transport one of my dogs, I just slide the seatbelt through the handle bar or through a few vent holes (depending on which dog it is)|`|gDZWdLHTaa	you can get it at smart pet of u are close to there
0xJZJggVaa	You don't. She could be pregnant by him or anything else in the neighborhood or both. You BYBers crack me up!|`|LPEO6AsCaa	You can get an ultrasound done at the vets at about the 28th day mark in her pregnancy.  also at this time there is a blood test that can be done to confirm the pregnancy too.  Check with your vet as to when they will do any of the tests I have mentioned|`|AA10072754	lol|`|IA1HIUe3aa	well you can ask the vet if she is    Some signs :  Not hungry anymore  Doesnt want to do any activities  Weird but if her nipples get bigger cuz milk is coming  Shell be changing her moods  Like humans you'll see her belly grow    Hope this helps!    Exciting!|`|D4DUxMqIaa	I have attached a few links that should help and give you some information regarding Canine Pregnancy    Good luck
OWks1vBzaa	Take her to the vet Monday and have her spayed.    Since you were not trying to breed her there is no reason for her to be intact. I presume she is not a Champion in the show ring and that you have not had genetic testing done on her or the other boxer.    Now is a good time to get the male dog neutered as well.    You can have multiple sires in one litter.    If you plan on letting her have the puppies be prepared to spend thousands of dollars in vet bills if there is a problem- like her needing emergency c-section.    There are millions of unwanted pets that are put to sleep every year. Be responsible and do not contribute to this problem.|`|LPEO6AsCaa	Probably both.  A female can get pregnant from more than one dog and several differnt types of pups.  Your going to have a mix of everything.  You may have some purebred Boxers and some muts.    If you do not want any pups at all then you can bring her into your vets and have her sprayed right away and you weill never have anything to worry about again.    What happened between mother and son is inbreeding and it is never a good thing.|`|AA10072754	Expect dead or unhealthy puppies.  Chances are they will get those bad genes.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	could be puppies from both studs.    just because her son breed her does not mean that puppies will be deformed.    the only thing that would be a problem if you are doubling up on the same faults.|`|bdc97cb8a885f4c94f6651cd17c59627aa	I have no idea. It could have been either one. You'll just have to wait and see what the puppies look like.    If the male boxer is the father, then you might have to expect a few deformities like blindness, mental retardation, etc. That's more likely to happen when related animals mate with each other.|`|QT7nsNGLaa	Could get puppies in the same litter with 2 different sires.   Call the vet, there is a morning after pill for dogs I think?    Spay your female and neuter your male since you cannot guarantee this won't happen again.   Most people do not do well with intact dogs.    And as far as disasters?   Call the female's breeder, talk to them.   It depends on the pedigree....some inbreeding works out ok, but it is very risky.  Some ends up with deformed puppies.|`|X6o53ePeaa	No, there is no disaster to expect. The only bad thing is that the babies will be the dad's sons and daughters, and her siblings. It's when sister and brother mate, that's when you prepair for disaster. Good luck!|`|b3d1ea6b376eb1836aad3ca778084cccaa	Your female could be pregnant by both.  Get her litter aborted then do the responsible thing and get her spayed.|`|190fef259c921e210d201a2d0a85ac32aa	OK, first off, I worked at a vet office for 4 years, and we had plenty of breeders in and out of the office. I've heard them talking about breeding mothers and sons or fathers and daughters. It's no big deal. The only time you can get imbred pups (or so I was told) is when you breed a brother and sister. Now, as far as her breeding with another dog, females can breed with many different males. You'll just end up with mixed pups. Just remember that a female dog will accept a male after about 8 days, so, just keep her away from the boys next time! Best of luck, and I'm sure the pups will be cute!
IQb3VJGHaa	A dog needs regular exercise every day! If she doesn't have enough time then it is really bad. The dog can get lonely and will in some cases suffer depression and feel neglected.    She could:    a) Get another dog for some companionship.  b) Get a friend or a professional dog walker to walk and look after your dog during the day.  or  c) Give the dog away to a nice home.|`|QWFmNBFyaa	She shouldn't have got a dog in the first place! She should find him a great home!|`|CBAb34TIaa	It is not only unfair, but inhumane to do what your friend is doing. My husband and I recently adopted (rescued) a dog from a similar situation. He is seven years old and was kenneled for about 16 hours a day for the past 7 years. He is a very sweet dog, but has lots of neurotic tendencies including separation anxiety, hyperactivity, and hand shyness from being alone so much. We love him despite all of his quirks and teach our children the importance of treating pets as family members not possesions. Thank you for being concerned and please pass along any helpful information to your friend.|`|FNYEkyqLaa	Your friend is really being selfish in keeping this dog.  It is not housebroken (little wonder why) and is not socialized.  Your friend is nowhere near being a responsible dog owner.  How sad.  I agree with you about your assessment but I can't offer any remedy.  It is just ignorance but your friend needs to first acknowledge that and then seek education.|`|AA10718728	well it is unwise and unfair for you and the puppy yuo should drop it off at the doggie daycare if you realy want this dog that bad cause if you drop it off at the doggie daycare while your at work then by the time you get home it will be tired like you but if you dont. . . youll be super tired and you will have this hyper puppy wantin to play with you i hope that you will make the right choice and at some doggie daycares they even train them tricks and basic skills like potty trainin and exc. . .|`|GpiRaSvPaa	Thats not a good way for that poor dog to have to live! All dogs (even if they have a big yard to run around in all day) need to be walked a few times a day! Dogs are social animals and need to be with their "packs"... they need ALOT of love, attention and exercise! They also NEED to be properly trained and socalized! That dog cannot possibly be happy like that!.. I dont want to sound mean, but it sounds like she needs to find that dog a good home!|`|1bc6f84de7ee8c43a63d880ff716e7c6aa	This is a travesty. Dogs are pack animals. In the wild, they are islolated when they are not the best ( such as in wolf packs) The worst thing one can do is isolate a pup. That is what your friends pup is going through. It is so cruel. Behavior problems will ensue. People are such animals since they are not as smart as animals in knowing what is right. I hope you can find a new home for this pup where it will be loved and paid attention to. Imagine for the pup to have to go to the bathroom and trying to hold it. no other animal does that ( cats have litter boxes to go in) I am so sad after having read your message but yet glad you wrote it since you show how caring you are. Best wishes to try to change the situation.  God Bless|`|AA12154456	Seems like she never stopped to think what she could do for the puppy rather than what the puppy could do for her.     If she honestly loves the dog then she needs to take some serious time to potty train and try to undo some of the damage she has inflicted on the dogs social abilities.     If she is unwilling to stop treating him as a fashion accessory then she needs to find someone who cares about the dog and get herself a stuffed animal to carry around in her doggy purse!!|`|LXx8ahmraa	It is completely unfair on the dog.  Dogs thrive on company and need exercise as well.  She doesn't seem ready to sacrifice her social life to become a responsible pet owner.  Lack of toilet training comes about by lack of discipline.  My dog used to do her business inside my house, until **I** pulled my socks up and took her out to the park *twice* a day.  She should give it to someone who has the time for it.
eiipJjLTaa	I agree with Black Sheep, great thing you are trying to do, but you really need to b going about it a different way. Try this site, its a great way to get dogs noticed, www.kijiji.com but please charge for them, too many dogs end up in testing labs becasue they are given away for free|`|AA10072754	great thing you are doing but you are doing it very poorly.    The point of an animal shelter is to get dogs GOOD homes.  Half the people on here can't take care of their own.  Why don't you try setting up an account with petfinder or something????  You didn't even LEAVE a whole phone number!!!    Jesus and you are giving them away for free???!?!?!  If they can't afford to adopt the darn thing then they probably can't afford to care for it!!!|`|12e67832e3db94d47bafc734b06e4b47aa	This is not adopt -a-pet  you should be advertising at your local vets etc. You are doing a responsible thing  by housing a shelter but most people on here already have pets that they are needing advice with so there is no point really doing it on here, sorry Also can I just add, pups are usually cheaper most people pay more for the adult dog with them being mutts because you can see the age/size/adult colouring etc unless that is just were I am.
411MXPSuaa	Keep your company in another room away from the dog. Ask them what the problem is...maybe they have a fear of dogs.When you take him potty keep him very close to you and once again away from your company.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	Find out why she is afraid of babies?      Hold him in your lap & ask her just to feel his fur.  Start out with something that should pose no fear.  Just touch the fur.    She may have had a dog bite her or she may have absorbed someone elses fears (like her parents).  She may have just a reason to feel afraid.  But you gotta find out what caused the fear first.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Get saner, more considerate and civilized friends.  If you puppy is not wild or mean, your friend is reacting in a really inconsiderate, irrational way - she needs help, not the puppy.|`|AA10072754	Why don't you leave him outside?  This may help get rid of the habbit of "if I cry and bark she will come get me" which would encourage him to do it more.|`|5dErQFtdaa	Some people are afraid of dogs and may need to be socialized to be around dogs. Let the person know that your dog is not going to attack them. Hold the dog in your lap until they get used to them. Invite them to pet the puppy while you are holding it. Once they see how the dog is they will probably be more comfortable around it.|`|eiipJjLTaa	Tell your family that it is your house. A dog is part of a family and they need to get use to it. A little puppy can't do much, but if it is not socialized and has to be locked up every time someone comes over it is going to start to put two and two together and realize that guest= locked up which could = mean and dangerous dog. Tell the family to get over it and stop acting like a bunch o school girls!|`|C63hLgWnaa	Don't worry about it if your friends come over and don't like your puppy then they shouldn't be your friend. I know that sounds harsh but why would they hurt your feelings. THat is just wrong.
ymFcm1IAaa	I used a crate for my German Shepard. Until your pup is potty trained and not chewing on things, I would use a crate. Then move into an excercise pen for training. I would get the basics down first though.|`|0xJZJggVaa	Start with the crate. The X pen gives him too much room.|`|AA10072754	Use a crate.  When puppies are given too much room they will soil everywhere.  Crates make it so its just like a doggie bedroom and dogs won't soil next to their bed.  If you have a large breed dog then I suggest spending that $100 on getting a wire crate.  As for size go for the size you will need when the dog is an adult.  You can buy dividers that make the crate smaller so your dog can grow into the crate.  Thats a lot cheaper than buying $90 crates over and over again and a lot less work than re training and picking up mess.    As for pens....well I have had my bad experience with them.  Before I was into the crate I had my puppy (now a 7 year old dog) in a pen.  I found myself picking up poo and puddles all the time.  Plus the pen was just as expensive as a crate.|`|9QCCVgTSaa	It would be a little better to crate the puppy. He will get used to it quicker.. You can put toys and blankets so he is more comfortable. I have a puppy, who is crated. She used to have many accidents, and now she knows the drill. I also work at a dog rescue..
0xJZJggVaa	It's a scam. DNA can tell you it's a dog and parentage, not breed.|`|hEXb1unraa	if there was......Why    it would be extremly expensive it would be cheeper just to go buy a properly registered and papered dog.|`|AA10072754	there isn't one.....|`|NCx3dpleaa	A DNA analysis. Ask your vet how to go about this, or your local AKC organization, or go to AKC.org for help.|`|wOBxFW1taa	There are some DNA tests but these are very expensive and I am not sure if the AKC will even recognize them as being proof of breed. I would get a dog with documentation of the parents if you are that worried about getting a pure breed.|`|cd731a89d8c493e5a2e82406e38dcdb2aa	A DNA test can determine parentage.|`|xdfcz518aa	I am sure there is one but why do you want to know?

De todas formas es una irresponsabilidad comprar un perro sin haberse preocupado por sus antecedentes, por sus progenitores, y por sus "papeles".

El boxer es un perro de tamano mediano de compocision fisica cuadradita, esta raza tiene una corta, derecha y muscular espalda. Un pecho ancho y bien desarrollado. Tiene arrugas en su frente y el labio superior colgante, pero nunca piel colgante en la parte detras de la cabeza. Tiene orejas caidas que naturalmente se inclinan hacia alfrente, las cuales usualmente cortan, para tenerlas paradas erectas en un show. Ojos color marron oscuro de forma horizontal. (entiendase mas alargados) . Su boca al mirarlo de frente,  es pequena, formando una pequeno arco, ya q sus labios superiores cuelgan. Una cola cortada, q se mantiene erecta, y sus patas traseras son arquedas hasta la parte mas baja. Su color aceptable es marron y atigrado (brindle), con marcas blancas en la cabeza, hocico, cuello, pecho y parte baja de las patas, ademas el hocico *****, tipo mascara. Hay ejemplares que son totalmente blancos o con poco color y estos no son favorecidos y jamas podran competir.    pos espero te sirva de algo la info....

A esta edad solo una persona muy conocedora de la raza puede decirte si es pura o no y como va a ser de grande con solo verla. Deberias haber visto ambos padres y cercionarte que quien te la vendio sea gente honesta que no te muestren un perro como padre de la cachorra que tal vez no lo sea.

tRf4X9Qsaa	your first question should be, is this a reputable breeder??  If you did your research and the breeder is a reputable one,     then u have to ask yourself, do you want a dog that u never seen before??    Personally, I did tons of research on my breeder and was 100% comfortable on receiving my dog on the plane.  Then again the flight was only 1 hour and  a half.     You will have to pay anywhere between $250 and UP  Depending on what age u get ur dog, you will have to get the shots..........But if your dog does not need the shots, Take him to the vet to get checked out first, and make sure that in your contract there is a health gaurantee.    please do your research, i don't want u to get hurt.    thanks    mother of 2 doggies, and 1 doggie that passed away early because I bought him from a puppy mill breeder :(|`|AA10072754	I wouldn't get a dog you haven't met.  What if you don't like the dog?  What will you do then?  What if this dog has problems like separation anxiety?      Shots have to be done prior to flying and will cost over $100.  Cheaper just to adopt one over here.  If the shipper isn't getting it vaccinated then its likely they never wanted it (god please don't be a horrid "shelter") who knows what kind of condition this dog is coming in?|`|f8a3e1916a1358a55f2e47b7e870da88aa	call your area.  at this time of year no respectable airline or breeder would ship a puppy.  i live in kansas, which is probably one of the states your pup will have to fly through and the low at night right now, last week and for a few weeks to come is in the mid 80's.  and it's around 100 degrees by noon every day.  your puppy will die of heat exhaustion by the time it gets to you.  once the weather cools down, call the airline and ask what their fees are.  also what the requirements are for pets in cargo.  personally i would never fly a puppy or any pet for that matter.  also the breeder should have given the first set of vaccines before ever selling the pup to you.  as for the rest of the series, ask your vet for their reccomendations.  also you need to think about buying from a breeder who you've never personally seen their premises or at least one of the parents.  you will have no idea what you will be getting and returning a pup cross country would be next to impossible.  different laws and different states.   what breed are you looking at that only someone in ohio breeds them?|`|AA11276746	I wouldn't recommend buying a dog that you haven't ever met.  In addition, flying a dog on a plane is very stressful to the animals.  Dogs die that way, you know.  They have to ride with the cargo, and there's no a/c or heat.  Most airlines also won't fly when it's over a certain temp, and it's probably too hot now.   Your dog will probably have to have shots before he gets on the plane, rabies at the very least, and most airlines require a certificate of health from a vet obtained within a short time frame before the flight.  My suggestion is to adopt one closer to home.|`|CbJ5NVnIaa	The dog will need a health certificate and be up to date on all vaccines BEFORE shipping.  Shipping will run about $200 through an airline, plus you will probably have to purchase an airline approved crate through the current owner.  With all that, you will spend over $300 to ship the animal.  Please be advised that with the heat, many airlines will not ship animals.  Be sure to check with the airline you want to use before making any plans.  I got my dog last summer(I got her as an adult) and had to use a ground shipping company(from Idaho to Louisiana), Professional Pet Transport.  It was a bit more expensive(over $500), but well worth it.  She arrived in great shape and was well cared for the whole time by 3 people on board the truck.    Also, make sure you are buying or adopting through a reputable breeder...beware puppy mills and scam artists trying to rip you off.|`|wX3RzHaRaa	Most airlines can not ship when its above 85 degrees. However Continental Airlines (shipping with them is $300 & up) provides heat & AC for the dogs on their planes in cargo. So they ship year round. In order for a dog to be shipped by air they must be up to date on shots & have a health certicate. Most dogs do fine when shipped by air, there are a few exceptions. Express your concerns to the breeder & the airline. Ground transportation is a little more costly but it is a option. Good luck !
2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Google crate training.  Consistency, patience and the ability to withstand the weather while you wait outside for 1/2 an hour at a time, many times a day.  Also be prepared to get out of bed a couple of times each night to take pup outside.  Have fun!!!|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	Patience, supervision and lots of rewards!    The easiest way to house train a puppy is to prevent mistakes as much as possble - don't give the puppy any opportunity to mess ni the house. This will make it easier for him to associate toiletting with being outside.    Firstly, puppies can't "hold it" for very long, so you need to take them out frequently. Take him out first thing in the mornnig and last thing at night, after eating, and at least every two hours throughout the day. You need to take him out and stay out with him until he goes. When he does, give him lots of praise and maybe a treat.  (If the puppy loves being outside, don't bring him straight in after he has been, otherwise he might try to hold it so he can stay out longer).    Whilst the puppy is indoors he needs pretty much constant supervision. Get to know his behaviour - what he does before messing, eg some puppies sniff around or circle. If you see him start (or about to start) toiletting, interupt him and take him straight outside. Then praise him if he finishes his business outside.    If the puppy is crate trained it can help to put him in his crate when he can't be supervised, because most dogs will not mess in their beds unless they really have to!    If you do find any messes your puppy made earlier, just clean them up and make sure to use a products that will remove the smell (otherwise he will be encouraged to use the same spot again).    At no point during house training should you punish the puppy. He is just a baby - some dogs don't gain full control over their baldders / bowels until around 6 months old. After-the-fact punishment is completely useless because the puppy can not associate your reaction with something he did earlier - he simply can not learn from it. Even if you catch him in the act, punishment is not necessary and can make things worse. Some puppies may start to show submissive / nervous urination, or may become fearful of messing when being watched - making it impossible to reward him for getting it right.    Hope this helps - good luck!|`|BDRIeLqUaa	get a puppy crate, a book about crate training, and a good puppy class
zrUbBiFdaa	either wake up and take her out to potty in the middle of the night or put her in a crate, she wont want to pee/poop in the place she sleeps.
HYpEOdsraa	If  she is still nursing her puppies you will find that she won't want to be away from them for very long and bathing is quite a long process as she would need to be thoroughly dry before returning to her puppies  It could distress her if she can't get back to the pups for this length of time.    I would wash her undercarriage and back featherings well with a good quality mild shampoo, make sure it is rinsed well, then dry her quickly so that she can return to her babies without getting unduly stressed.    I always do this with my Dams a week after they have whelped to keep them fresh and clean and then once a week thereafter until the pups are completely weaned.   Once the puppies are on solid food and her job is done you can then give her a nice bath.    Good luck with your litter.|`|9d8438febeda9f081685c3c773c13d90aa	There is no harm at all in giving her a bath at this point...She does however need to be dry when you return her to the litter...  So wait until the pups are sound asleep...Coax her with a treat so she doesn't wake the pups and please make sure that she's dry before you let her back with the pups.. :-)|`|T128lNQhaa	Sure, theres no harm in that,    Mr. Farewell|`|fI9fT4t6aa	by now it should be okay.she probably needs to be cleaned really good.and that will make her more healthy for the pups.|`|hoeN5xP0aa	Do not give her a bath!! She shouldn't have a bath until the puppies are separated from her. You can wash her down with water, or take a wet cloth and wipe her down, but do not use soap. The soap can also be harmful to the puppies.

Jkt3UkTBaa	Beautiful tank!  That might just be freaked out about their new environment.  I'm not a 100% sure but maybe he/she is an aggressive fish and should not be housed with other more easy fish.  Well anyway, see how it goes and if it gets too messy return the colbalts if possible or give them to someone else that has a tank.
342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	No, it's not bad.  Just make it lean hamburger so the fat content isn't too high.|`|csDhZDvraa	Well thats one lucky dog! Fed sparingly like once a week as a food topper it should be alright.    High quality dog kibble (dogfoodanalysis.com) should be fine alone without extras added in.    Extra food could cause obesiety in your dog, but fed as a treat every once in awhile it should be okay.|`|AA11992723	i raw feed my dogs, but usually i read to stay away from ground beef in grocery stores. you also don't want to overfeed or give too little vitamins and minerals by replacing alot of the dog food with just hamburger meat. i wouldn't give half and half. 1/4 hamburger meat only no more than that.    balanced homecooking or raw for your dog is fun and healthy though, but it has to be balanced! you might want to get a book about homecooking or raw food diets.|`|p7swtBYzaa	It's just fine as long as it is lean chop meat, not the high fat kind.    I don't know what these "no human food" advice givers are thinking - the best dog food is made from human grade meat and veggies - dry kibble doesn't grow on trees, it's made from regular food.    The key is to give a good dry, mix the hamburger with it - you can even add a little rice and some string beans, carrots, peas, low fat cheese, plain yoghurt - all good nutrition for dogs.|`|7X0zAd9kaa	No it isn't bad at all as long as you don't over do the hamburger meat.  =)    Lucky dog!|`|syT3XUAraa	As long as the meat is lean and cooked a little, it should be ok. Some people raw feed, which is good, but if your dog isn't used to raw, it could make it sick. Feeding dogs raw hamburger meat isn't good for them, since it has lots of bacteria, but cooking it removes the germs. I also wouldn't give your dog too much of it, because it will then want people food instead of its normal dog food. The dog food should also be high quality, and not none of the unhealthy brands such as Purina, Iams, Hill's Science Diet, Pedigree, or Eukanueba. Some good, healthy dog food brands would include Taste of the Wild (my personal favorite), Wellness, Innova, Blue Buffalo, and Eagle Pack Holistic.|`|K8t1lPXsaa	if you want to feed your dog a human food it is better to keep it lean like mixing ground turkey in with the food instead. it depends on your dog as to whether or not it is bad for him or not. some dogs actually could use the extra nutrition while some owners just like spoiling their dogs. if your dog becomes a constant beggar it won't be the best thing for it.     my yorkie was underweight so he had to be fed ground turkey mixed with his innova
Jguzosm2aa	You mean koi?    What you heard is entirely false. Koi grow very quickly, reaching at least one foot in length before their first year and eventually reaching three feet. For koi, the smallest pond I would recommend would be 7 feet wide by 8 feet long and 4 feet deep - about 1500 gallons.|`|OMEDzf3maa	No it will be fine but it may have to be bigger when they grow.
Mzvp1LPFaa	Basically you have two puppies here, one human and one canine.  Both are reactive and neither know "the rules".  Puppy teeth are like little needles.  It's how puppies teach each other not to bite too hard in play, before they develop the jaw power of an adult and the ability to do real harm.  I'd consider it a lesson in life to your son; if I do this, the result is a painful finger.  A kitten would teach the same lesson with a swat with the claws.  It's certainly not lethal nor disfiguring.  Sometimes we remember lessons the best that are uncomfortable - ever touch a hot stove?  Bet you don't do it now.   Take the puppy to puppy kindergarten to be socialized and learn manners, and teach your son how to properly handle animals.  If it seems like too much work (and raising a puppy IS lots of work) rehome him and consider an already trained adult that is used to kids.  Here's two resources I have my adopters read:|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	NO, your pup was just reacting to the pain. It doesnt mean it was trying to be aggressive. The one you need to be monitoring is the baby. Babies at that age, as you know, just grab things, and dont understand. Its all part of the curiousity of a baby. So it wasnt the dogs fault.    Also quick note: at your puppies age, it still has its sharp, puppy teeth, which can easily break the skin.|`|PdotFx4naa	Why would you put the dog down?  Teach your son some manners.  Maybe a little respect would help too.  It's not the dog's fault the kid hurt it!|`|4ba573d10043e0b2f1d30e9ba0bb3383aa	Have the pup adopted to a family more suitable to have a puppy. You should be really pissed at 1st yourself for letting your 3 YEAR OLD get ahold of a puppy like that and 2nd your kid for getting ahold of the puppy at all. You should really be teaching your child how to handle a dog BEFORE getting a puppy. The dog was biting in defense which is the only way it knows how. Shame on you for being mad at the dog! Not like it's going to tell your kid "NO". Find a home for the dog without young children and hold off on another dog until either your child is older or better behaved.    If you aren't willing to accept advice from strangers, don't ask for it! It's not that no one here cares about your 3 year old but this is a pet Q & A not a child Q & A so go to the parenting category here and get simpathy from other parents of 3 year olds who are having the same behavioral problems. You aren't going to get simpathy from a bunch of animal lovers here when you get "so pissed at the pup" for acting on it's only source of defense and then ask if you should have it euthanized! Good thing it's illegal to have that done to children or some people might suggest that be punishment when a child does something bad! GRRRRR people like you with all your ignorance is what people like me complain about when we say "bad pet ownership".|`|cJxNY1Ctaa	how would you like it if someone grabbed and twisted your leg? the pup was obviously in pain, so its natural reaction of course is going to be to bite. you need to teach your son to be gentle around animals, he is old enough to know better and he should have been taught this before you ever even got a puppy. give the poor pup to someone who will treat it better and is more understanding, dont put it down.|`|AA11884446	It's a puppy...all it knows is that it was being hurt and it's response is to get rid of the pain the only way it knows how which is biting. Unless the puppy does it just to do it, then I would give the poor thing a chance. It would be like trying to tell your 3 y/o son not to do what he did. He doesn't understand the concept of pain yet. Neither does the puppy. Remember that's the pup's only defense.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Euthanizing a dog (putting it to sleep) should always be the last resort.  Rehoming a dog is best.  Obviously your three year old son didn't know what he was doing or what the consequences would be.  The puppy only reacted to something that hurt.  Neither are to blame.  I don't think blame is necessary.  If you want to keep the dog, teach your son "nice touch" with the dog.  Kid's at 3.5 years can be very smart & will learn to listen to their parents.  Plus, the dog needs to be conditioned to children - you can do this by pulling gently on his ears and tail and fur.  If you get any reaction other than something you like, call a professional dog trainer or go online for books.  Thousands of people have dogs and small kids.  You can too.|`|Amfv3BRAaa	no you shouldnt put him to sleep .. he is only reacting to the pain he felt jus as if someone smacked you, your reaction would probably smack that person back    Just teacher your son that its bad for him to do that and the dog wont hurt him|`|ZtMUZ6ryaa	don't hav it put to sleep!!! when dogs get hurt they sometimes try to protect themselves and this was probably just an accident! if you are concerned he will do it again you could go to obedience classes but diffidently do put her/him to sleep|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	Yea, the only thing that needs to happen here is the pup needs a better home then the one he is in, because if you are actually considering putting him down, for biting your son when he's only a puppy and was hurt, then you don't deserve to the dog.  Re-home him to someone that will care for him properly, and don't get another dog.|`|6284ef90ad02ff7d661501eea6c01313aa	Wow...you should direct your anger at yourself instead of the puppy, for not reading up on dog behavior before you got a dog! Your son twists a puppy's leg and you are only concerned about the bite your son got?! What if something 3 times your size came and twisted your leg!     Puppy teeth would break anyone's skin. They are small and sharp, it doesn't take much to break the skin.    You need to teach your son how to act around animals! My nieces are 15 months and 3 years old and they both know how to be gentle with the dogs and cats! Teach him to pet the dog on the back, softly and calmly. Give him rules - no running or screaming around the puppy, period. Puppies can't help that they INSTINCTUALLY run, chase, and nip things that move!! If he learns this now it will prevent many dog bites in the future. Tell him the puppy is not bad or scary, but that he should never pull or tug or twist on any animal because you can hurt them or startle them.    I'm sure you were supervising them, but it is important to physically show your son what he should and shouldn't do with the dog. He needs to learn to talk in a low soft voice to keep them both calm. It helped my neice learn when I asked her to show another girl how you should pet the dog and hold the cat.    If you truly do not recognize this as your responsibility and know the puppy was just being a puppy, you should really consider rehoming the puppy. No vet would put a 4 month old puppy to sleep anyway, they would just think you are crazy (honestly). You should to take a puppy training class to learn more about dogs and their behavior. Otherwise, things will get worse.    The class will be good because then you can teach the puppy how to act around children, it works both ways. If you work hard at it for a few months you will have a dog that will allow children to play rough with him, and a child that knows he shouldn't play rough with the dog.|`|b2dffdde9d95855452a59a5a7564c914aa	Dogs and kids will scuffle.  It happens. Both the child and the dog are young and still learning the way of things.      I would recommend giving the dog a second chance. He was defending himself.  Whenever he nips, immediately flip him onto his back and tell him firmly, "No bite!"  Flipping works for other behaviors as well.  It puts the animal in a position of being dominated.  This may be harder to do with a large dog.  If the dog is too large to be turned onto his back, then put him in a confined area immediately after the undesired behavior...like a time out.  Again, tell him firmly, "No bite!"    At the same time, try to explain to your son why the dog bit him.  Explain that twisting the dog's leg hurt him and that is why the dog bit him.  Your son is young and it may take a few reminders to be kind to the dog.  Kids are curious and exploring their environments.  My daughter at age 3 tried to snip a piece of our dog's ear to put in her scrapbook.  When he yelped and bled, my daughter cried and said she didn't mean to hurt him.  She thought it wasn't part of his body.  Remember, kids do not have the full grasp of the World as we do.  It takes a lot of patience.    Try this first.  If the biting continues you may want to consider giving the dog away to a family with older children or no children.|`|zSOnXtiQaa	I would not have the puppy put to sleep! He didn't bite out of the blue, he was biting something that was hurting him. I would, however think about re homing the dog. He isn't a mean spirit, he just reacted, and not to your liking. Maybe place him in a home without children.|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	LMFAO.    You have a TERRIBLY ILL BEHAVED KID    At THREE years old, a child should know what's okay to do, and what's NOT okay to do.    This is YOUR fault, not the dogs.|`|24CFl7sjaa	I think you have just learned the hard way why everyone who has any experience of dogs will not advocate allowing young children and young pups to be raised together, especially the smaller breeds. A dogs only defence are his teeth and a pup will use them if he feels threatened or is in pain.  Please think carefully about whether a pup is a suitable addition to your family at this time and if you do decide to wait until your child is older to avoid repeat behaviour then re-home the pup while he is still young enough to be re-trained easily. We all learn from our mistakes.|`|sgcrB6x0aa	I think you might want to think about why so many people think different from you before someone has to dial the hotline to report animal abuse.    You know, whenever there is an animal bite, the first thing you should think about is rabies and infections.  I don't understand why you are here instead of bringing your son to see a physician.  If you did, I bet the doctor was telling you the same thing as everyone here.    Where did you get the pup?  Whoever let you have the puppy without considering you have a toddler to take care of while no pup/dog raising experience should be told not to again.  The mother dog would be heart broken knowing her baby was tortured and might be sentenced to death by one she thought she could trust her baby to.    Anyway,  I don't think you need to be panic.  I believe both your son and the puppy have learned.  You just have to keep monitoring both of them.      Or, as many have suggested, it is probably too much for you to take care of both, you can simply give away your puppy to someone else (well... obvious you would not like the idea to give away your own son.)    Or, if you are unwilling to re-home the puppy, please spare some time to attend puppy train.  Some pet shops actually offer free workshops.  They are fun.  I believe all you three would enjoy.|`|iXijnCxOaa	1) Rehome the puppy.  It deserves to live with someone who has some clue.    2) Recognize the fact that you are failing your son in your inability to teach him and in the fact that you are willing to blame a pup for defending itself from harm.  Realize that doing this on an ongoing basis will set this child up for future grief.    No, the dog is NOT more important than the 3 year old. YOU are failing your child by not teaching him manners or boundries.      You have a chance to decide to do what is best for your child by teaching him boundries and compassion for animals.  If you instead opt to continue laying blame rather than looking at the reality of the situation, please rehome this pup.    This world is going to hell in a handbasket because people are not teaching their kids any responsibility for their actions... but they are teaching them how to lay blame elsewhere... it makes me wonder about your parents and their lack of teaching you adequate parenting skills.|`|9qkCf6Mlaa	Don't kill your dog.  It was your sons fault.  If someone twisted my leg I'd yell at them too or in a dogs sense  bit to let them know not to do that again.  You need to take your dog to obedience classes.  Your puppy is just that a puppy.  Like a toddler.  Needs constant discipline and supervision.  Maybe you just should give the dog away to a more suitable home.  It doesn't sound like you know how to take care of a dog much less a puppy.|`|GR6l4fJjaa	This isn't your fault or the dogs, like mentioned above the dog was just reacting to the pain. If your dog isn't normally aggressive then I would just forget about it as this is just a rare occurance. If your dog is aggressive though you can take it to places for obedience or take classes and do some research on how to raise your puppy.    Show your dog love and the proper way on how you expect it to act as a young age and things will be fine, please don't put your puppy down, it deserves the opportunity to live a long life.|`|ldXSIWEyaa	No do not get the pup put to sleep. The pup didnt know what he was doing, just like the baby didnt know what he was doing to the puppy. If you can't take care of a baby and a puppy please take the puppy to a no kill shelter so it can get adopted. Or you can try posting the puppy on craigslist and see if you can find a loving home for him. The puppy deserves a chance! Its almost the same as saying "should i put my baby to sleep" because he twisted the dogs leg?|`|LYOgbhMaaa	no do not put the dog down. your child should not have twisted it leg.|`|X2lZEs0Daa	NO!  Like the first answer, your pup was just reacting to the pain.     You should not be "pissed" at the pup at all.  You should be the "Pack Leader" and that includes being the leader of the pack with both your son and the dog.    It was a normal reaction caused by a negative action.    The first thing you should do is teach your son to respect the dog(a child is never to young to learn how to interact and respect a dog.)    Here is a link on becoming the Pack Leader.  Have your son learn these as well so the dog respects him, too.    http://www.cbrrescue.org/articles/packle...    The first thing I started doing when I got my dogs(both American Pit Bull Terriers & both registered therapy dogs) was putting my hand in their food bowl while they were eating.  This is especially good to do if you have little ones in the house.  The dog gets used to a hand in their bowl and will not bite any fingers that go near it.|`|sgRq4R9daa	I don't think you should, the puppy was only reacting to the pain. All the people who are being nasty, things like that happen so quick and he's a child that what kids do. plus you don't know hes a brat, so stop calling him one.|`|3jeRpMS0aa	You are an idiot.  You would have an innocent dog put to sleep for nipping your brat?   This question makes about as much sense as "Should I execute my kid for tormenting the dog?"    Get real.  Call a rescue group or take it to a shelter.  AND DON'T LET 3 YEAR OLDS PLAY WITH A PUPPY!!!!!  This whole thing is your fault.  Give the dog away to prevent it from suffering at your hands -- you sound like a dimwit.|`|8a4c030a7a44cd4edebe25c4141c6ddaaa	You shouldnt have the pup put to sleep, he just reacted to the pain that was induced by your son.  Why dont you just give the puppy away to someone else who may not have small children.  Some pups just do not deal well with small children handling them.|`|xk05AIRzaa	Wow. Seriously? You want to KILL a dog because your son hurt him and he reacted to it? Okay, well, when your son gets a little older and let's say, gets in a fight at school, one where the other kid hit him first, if your son hits him back, you have to put your son down.  And if you don't know much about dogs, why do you have one? You're seriously wanting to put a dog to sleep because it reacted to your son HURTING it. Think, lady.  Don't get the poor thing put to sleep. Take it to a shelter, or give it to someone that will take care of it, so it can maybe have a home with someone who is a little more reasonable and doesn't jump to the euthanasia needle as soon as it misbehaves.|`|bCW8stmqaa	umm ok   well first of all its a puppy,and ur ,little boy im guessing was just trying to play with the pup,but he hurt the puppy and it just reacted to getting hurt,do not put it down just give it away to a more experienced person u and ur son are clearly not ready for a puppy|`|05805cd7f8ba800b6b1e4c9525a624bcaa	You are an irresponsible mother and pet owner. One your child should have been taught not to twist and animals leg and two what you think the dog was just going to sit there and take it?    My dogs are around kids 24/7 and if one twists their leg enough to make them yelp you are damn certain they will snap at the child. But the parents of these children have enough sense to teach their kids an animal is not their own personal play thing and it has feelings and can FEEL PAIN!    Instead of punishing the dog how about giving it to someone with common sense.|`|RZAjrv8Xaa	Tell me how you would react having someone take your leg, twist it and is twice your size. You would react. It's a puppy and a scratch. Maybe it'll teach your son not to do that to dogs. You son was in the wrong, not the dog. You're lucky. Why would you have the dog put to sleep? I don't think you should be owning a dog.    If you are seriously considering putting your PUPPY down for this you are crazy. Maybe you should be teaching your children not to do such things. I have a soon to be 2 yr old who wouldn't even do that. and i have a 16 month and a soon to be 4 month old puppies.    also, is there anything wrong with the dogs leg? did you even care to check that out? like take to the vet get an xray to make sure no damage was done, or only concerned for the SCRATCH on your son.    ADDED--- you are a loser. You think a scratch on your three yr old is going to do so much harm that you are willing to kill a 3 1/2 old puppy. Now if your son was cut open to peices and all such maybe we would care a little more, but this isn't were we need to learn manners... b/c you are crazy! Crazy people don't deserve to be nice to. Please give the dog away before your son or you do something to harm it. I'm sure you prob like kicked the dog or something after it happened. It's people like you to why we need animal cruelity officers out there. I think you shouldnt even have children to continue this mind set that what you think here is okay. Gah you ignorant person. You discuss me and dissapointment as a mother, women and human being!|`|AA10283080	Do not put the dog down. The dog was only doing what comes natural to dogs when they're being hurt.    Your 3 year old son is old enough to start learning how to be around dogs without harming them.....start teaching him.|`|PM23RDycaa	You are joking right? you want us to tell you it's ok to put down a puppy because it bit your bratty a$$ kid who wasn't taught proper dog manners by YOU?    Drop the pup at the shelter so he can find a RESPONSIBLE owner with some common sense    ADD: so you think its alright that your child who not only is bigger but also outweighs and is STRONGER than your 15-17 week old PUPPY abuses the animal?    I have a two year old who clearly knows better than you do. If he EVER did something like this I would have popped him right upside the head and then put him in his room for a bit.    Jesus its parents like you that lead to kids growing up thinking its ok to treat animals like crap. Yeah you don't know much about dogs or parenting either.  You WEREN'T supervising them if your son managed to hurt the puppy. Like I said give the pup to the shelter because you obviously don't have the skill set to teach your son right from wrong like any other parent.|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	bring it to a shelter or see if a neighbor wants it before you put it down. the puppy reacted to your kid causing pain to it.|`|3wJGXfkKaa	I don't think the puppy knew what was going on and neither did your child.  They are both new to this world and they both have to learn how to handle things.  I'm sure your child didn't know better than to grab the puppy's leg, I'm sure he was just trying to play with the pup.  I wouldn't put the puppy to sleep because of that.  You could try sitting your son in your lap and getting the puppy near by and showing him how to pet or play with dogs he'll learn fast and once the puppy realizes that he doesn't mean any harm I'll sure they will be best friends.  If your still not comfortable with leaving the dog there maybe you can find a good home for it your not wanting to keep the puppy.  Puppy's tend to have sharp teeth also and if there teething they'll want to chew on something to relieve those gums.  I hope your baby is ok maybe it won't happen again.  **** Luck.|`|BJugETlOaa	Your a horrible person. It is the dogs instinct to stike back when something hurts it, teach your son not to twist the dogs leg! It is a puppy and it doesn't know your 3 year old doesn't know any better. It is 3 months old what do you expect from a baby? If you can't handle having a dog find a good home for it, you don't have a 3 1/2 month old puppy put to sleep. It is still an animal and animals have instincts, you wouldn't let someone twist your leg would you, this is the puppy's way of protecting itself. You should find the dog another home if that is how you are going to treat it!|`|W0buucLsaa	This is why people with toddlers should not get puppies or small dogs. This is your fault. Your kid should be taught better than to twist a dog's leg. THAT is what you should do about it; teach your kid better manners.|`|vPde97E2aa	Nope,the rotten kid's negligent  *MOTHER* needs a DOPE-SLAP!!!  At minimum!!  The PUP is FINE...unless the brat is allowed to TORMENT it again.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Oh my.  You are so treading on water with this question.  I am going to be as nice as I can.  What happened was a normal reaction from a puppy who was being attacked.      The puppy is not at fault.  You are.  First, a 3 year old is old enough to be taught what he can and cannot do with a puppy.  Or any dog, for  that matter.  So, you failed to teach your child not to abuse an animal which is exactly what he did.    So, in my opinion and experience in the world of toddlers, puppies and dogs if you feel as though this gives you reason to be angry with the puppy and feel as though you need to euthanize it, I strongly suggest you re-home this puppy as soon as possible.    For the puppy's sake.  Not your child.|`|AE7W7Jspaa	Step back and take a breath for a moment.  The pup was reacting as any puppy would when being hurt, not being aggressive.  It seems that your son needs to be taught not to grab the pups leg and hurt it, that its wrong.  I raised 2 children with border collies from infant and puppyhood with no problem and no injuries.  Perhaps it would be better to simply rehome the pup and wait until your child is older and more responsible with his pets and their treatment|`|Chxoncy7aa	The puppy did nothing wrong, but react to being hurt.  You should place the pup with a rescue group.  you should also not own a dog.  I would bite too, it someone twisted my leg and hurt me.  What is wrong with you?????  Blame it on the puppy......that is absurd.|`|yhgRaBPXaa	I understand your concern for your sons safety. Accidents do happen, and I am sure the dog was reacting to the pain. If you are concerned it will happen again, maybe you can place the dog in a new home where only adults are present. Some dogs are just better suited for adult homes. If you want  another puppy for your son, try getting a Boston Terrier. Its the breed I have had since I was a child. They are wonderful with children and love to play. See if you can place your pup in a new home. Puppies are pretty easy to give away! I doubt any vet would put a puppy to sleep!|`|T8OFsBUUaa	I hate to be a cow, but you seem to get angry easily, based on your additional details. Which means, unfortunately, you are a poor candidate for dog ownership.    Please, for god's sake, do not euthanize this puppy. I think you'd be hard pressed to find a vet that would do it for you anyway, if you explained the situation. A vet would tell you the same thing we are - closer supervision, or re-home the dog.     It is very important that children and dogs be supervised, and that you are very close to the action when it happens. I am not calling you a bad mother, or a bad pet owner. And now that you have seen what can happen, I believe you'll be more aware of it in the future.     The reason no one is concerned for your child is that you plainly describe that the child has a scab - no stitches, nothing like that. Just a scab. That really is a minor injury. So, no, we are now more concerned about the pup knowing his life is in danger. It's a fair assumption to say on this forum we care greatly for dogs, and will do what it takes to get you to realize euthanizing in this case is a big mistake - even if the word we used aren't exactly friendly.    I would recommend an obedience course aimed at puppies in your area. Might cost you 100, or 150, but the benefits will be priceless should you continue to raise this puppy. It teaches you what to expect from your puppy (which you need, because you also plainly stated that you know very little about dogs) and it shows you how to help your puppy adjust, and how to teach the puppy to be more aware of children. And keep in mind, your puppy probably has about the same capacity for the situation as your child does, which is very little at all. Like a child striking out at another child (and don't deny this has happened) when they get hurt, that's what this was. Plain and simple reaction to pain.    Please, do not euthanize this puppy, and if you can't re-home, then find a no-kill shelter. There is nothing wrong with this dog.
Ws2QPD0Iaa	I personally love spotted nutmegs, I just got a beautiful male to breed to my black pied female.  They are all on my website.    I also love slates and lilacs, and strangley have a fond spot for agoutis.    Good luck, if you have any questions feel free to contact me!|`|Y8ssQvCKaa	You need to have a better grasp of gerbil genetics, dear. Just because the mum or dad is white- for example- it doesn't mean the babies will be white.|`|HaPjPzTlaa	I love love love gg colors and colorpoints. So, some of my favorite colors are CP silver nutmeg, CP grey agouti, BEW combinations, and CP nutmeg. I have a future pair that can have all of these colors too so I can't wait!      Since your looking into breeding you need to make sure you are well prepared and have researched thouroughly. The gerbil forum is a great place for advice and to ask any questions you have. I would highly advise that you join even if you feel you are prepared, just in case anything goes wrong. Plus, we love to see pup pictures! If you want too you can e-mail with questions you have :).   -Kate
lG6TWd0waa	carefresh or yesterday's news is the best product to use as bedding for any rodent.  it looks like fluffy recycled cardboard and im sure u can get it at any pet store.|`|1hS1pQz5aa	You have it backwards! Pine doesn't give respiratory infections...CEDAR does!|`|71073e87f86b8ae8fbfc18e6da2770e3aa	First remove the pine, and see how s/he does you can try using paper towel, t-paper, or try a different type of wood chips. If you are really concerned call any vet they may have some other options for you.     Do make sure to clean its cage really really well.|`|IUrGb0bSaa	Just remove the pine and get a different bedding.  It'll be just fine!|`|mXEOcSeuaa	Remove the bedding and wash the cage out with a vinegar and water solution.  Vinegar kills everything and will get rid of the smell that is causing your baby problems.  Next just switch the bedding.  Try carefresh, it's much better than any wood product you can get.  I've only ever had one rat be allergic to it out of eleven rodents.
7FQH8pcYaa	I just had my oldest female pit bull die from cancer they do not remove any thing not until the do an x-ray no matter how big or small the problem. Cancer is very bad in dogs and other animals. Just so you know I am a breeder for 11 years I have had lots of experience with all kinds of problems with dogs .|`|707gOCvbaa	They would  remove a small piece of tissue from the area and send it to the lab to be analyzed. Blood would also be drawn and you'lll know in a few days  the severity. Once the lab results are in they will discuss treatment.
ti8L5zryaa	I am so sorry.  I am sure you did everything you could for her.  It sounds like it was just one of those things that happen that we cannot explain.  I also have taken a rescue dog through heartworm treatment and fortunately she is fine, but I knew that was a  risk.  If you had not had her treated, she would also have died, so please don't be hard on yourself, and bless you for doing what you did.  Keep on rescuing!  We save who we  can and mourn those we cannot!|`|QLopvWKDaa	Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.   When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.     All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.   They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.     You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.     Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....      Author unknown|`|gwUMipsUaa	Sometimes things just happen.  Her death may have had nothing to do with the shots.  Sorry.  It's so hard.|`|3wJGXfkKaa	Sorry for your loss I know it's hard.  I'm still not over mine either but I haven't had long but it seems like an eternity.  I hope things get better for you.  Maybe your vet could tell you what happened|`|b46935e51173f254db10092f55afe9b6aa	IM SORRY|`|KxjUim7yaa	Sorry for your loss. Despite our best efforts sometimes we loose our pets.|`|iMOePEWlaa	i am very sorry for your loss.   it is very likly that she had a sever alergic reaction to the shot. while many dogs have minor alegies to them,it is normaly not fatal. however,if the reaction is bad enough this can somtimes happen. there is no way to know if this will happen to your dog. this is my speculation of what happend,it could have been somthing else. i am terrebly sorry for your loss.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Sometimes modern medicine fails. I am very sorry for your loss. She could have been allergic to the stuff or been over dosed. That is why I do not get our dogs heart worm shots. Pills are safer, but I don't use them either.   We have a dog that almost died as a puppy because she is allergic to the "L" part of a common vaccine called the "DHLP" shot. She ran high fevers and wouldn't eat.  Now she gets no more vaccines. There are a lot of dogs with this allergy so now U can ask for a puppy shot without the "L" factor. Most dogs do not need it anyway because it is for a disease from rats, and most modern dogs are not exposed to rats any more.   Very sorry that U R having to ge through this.|`|4ZGRgUd2aa	I am very sorry for you loss.. I don't think you did anything wrong, she prob just had a bad reaction to the shot.|`|b90e42d25bd45025e46d388ab0c06d12aa	It sounds like it was some type of stroke or damage to her brain.  Maybe she hit her head and you didn't know.  Sorry about your dog.|`|rVv5TC4Uaa	Very sorry to hear your loss.  Maybe the vet knows what happened since they gave her the shot?|`|PYSMK0JBaa	I'm so sorry for your loss!     did you contact the vet? he should have wanted to examine the dog's body.|`|JRqzkUxUaa	I don't have an answer, but I am so very, very sorry.|`|AA12322387	I'm assuming that Molly actually had heartworms.  Though the treatment isn't as brutal as it used to be, it's still a rough procedure.  It sounds as though you did everything right-keeping the dog calm is absolutely key after this treatment...their heart can't take stress for quite some time after that.    This should be a wake-up call to anyone that doesn't have their dog on a monthly heartworm preventative.    We get many dogs that are heartworm positive at my local rescue organization...    I'm sorry for your loss.|`|Uf9AZPyqaa	Was this the 2 part HW treatment where they give her half the dose the first month and the full dose the 2nd month?  This protocol is less harmful to dogs. I've fostered several HW treatments, but if the dog has a lot of coughing, the vet would also give prednisone for a couple of weeks. I'm so sorry to hear about your loss, at least you gave your rescue dog a loving caring environment.
ld2vmypNaa	aquatic turtles need fish and fruits and veggies!     NO  cherrios.  They are meat eaters ans well as they love and need veggies.  http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...    They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish (or minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies) at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days! The more they eat the healthier the turtle.    **** If these are hatchlings a 1 1/2  they may need to have their live food half dead by leaving the fish out of water for a few minutes (10minutes) and put in the tank. That way the baby can get the meat he needs and the fish cant out run the baby turtle.  Plus some leafy green and vitamin A fruits cut up a few times a week. Swollen cloudy eyes comes from lack of Vitamin A. Which we all need for good eyes.     Plus I also feed dried cubed blood worms or tubiflex worms or pellets at least 5 times a week for my five..  They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them un the pond, also meal worms.  As they get older they can have  snails, crickets, flies, crayfish, small frogs, slugs, tadpoles ,dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them) any other leafy greens will do for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples, remember cut up in small pieces..  .  These turtles in captivity do not hibernate their eating may slow down some but they will not hibernate. They cannot hear or see well so they feel you coming by the vibrations each foot step take.   TOSS in a bird cuttle bone in the water for calcium that will promote better shell growth, it will dissolve real slow and if they eat it thats fine!!    Did you know that they need to bask under a reptile light UVA/UVB for up to 8 hrs a day for the vitamin D that they need to grow.|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Anything that has meat they love.  A nice treat is frozen shrimp-thaw it out first, liver, earthworms, dead salamanders.  They go crazy.  Pond pellets, mine eat strawberry tops and oats.  Sugar probably isn't the best for turtles so maybe get the unsweetened ones?  Hope that helps.|`|DufvgxE6aa	Sugar not the best for them im sure. Most turtles are omnivores will eat meat and veggies. Meal worms and crickets are great protein and can be dusted with calcium if your turlte will eat from your hand. Try some veggies like collards mustards and kale chopped up and see if they will eat. My turtles love apples just not too much fruit. Some others are squash zucchini radish tops. Babies need more protein and adults like more veggies.      Well looks like most of the ingredients are already in some of the trutle foods so moderation should be ok.|`|EApHtKr6aa	You should try with fruit and vegetables.I have 2 turtles and they adore apples and pomelos.
OWGBAiXtaa	Maybe- your chances of finding a dog or puppy for sale at a farmers' market are probably as good as finding one in a WalMart parking lot or on a street corner.      I'd steer clear of puppies for sale in public because it is highly likely that the puppies have had no shots, are full of and covered with parasites, and may have parents with genetic health problems.     Might be $20 for a puppy or dog, but could cost thousands of dollars in vet bills later.|`|PM23RDycaa	Are you kidding? Why would you want to buy a dog/pup like that? Reputable breeder do not sell at farmer's market. Go to your local shelter/rescue and find a pet there.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Sure straight from a Back Yard Breeder. Never support them.  The shelter will have great dogs that have already been vet checked, shots and spay/neutered|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	Why would you want a Farmers Market puppy?  Most likely they will not have vaccinations or have been wormed.  Most of all, you will be supporting unethical breeders.      Go to a shelter instead.  They already have been vaccinated and altered.|`|nc4SbvfRaa	Most farmers markets do not allow the sale of animals.   I always recommend going to the AKC website and finding reliable breeders through the AKC sources. The pup you get will be more expensive, but you also will avoid the health problems and expenses of a poor breeding or puppy-mill pup. If expense is an issue, you would be better off waiting. Any pup you get needs shots and "infant" vet-care which can easily add up to $200 in the first year.|`|Da69ulcraa	Go to your local animal shelter or use a reputable breeder. DO NOT BUY A PUPPY FROM A FARMERS MARKET!!!!!!!|`|msAh2tItaa	it is possible to find dogs or puppys at farmers markets but the price can range from free to several hundred dollars depending on breed also your farmers market may not always have dogs and if they do u never know where they came from i would contact a local rescue and adopt or just look in the free section of the local newspaper|`|2lNM2xBmaa	I would be very, very cautious about buying a puppy from somebody at a farmers market or any type of "flea" market. There are several reason.     First, you don't know who the parents are, so you don't know what the puppy will look like. You also are not able to tell the temperament of the parents. Temperament is genetic and can be passed to the puppies. So if the mom or dad are shy, fearful, outgoing, aggressive, happy, etc., those can be passed to the puppies. Without seeing the parents, you are unable to determine if the puppies may be like the parents.     Second, you don't have confirmation what care the mother has received prior to having the litter. She should be up to date on her shots so she can pass on the immunity to her puppies. That will give the puppies immunity to diseases until they are old enough to receive them on their own.     Third, you don't know what care or vaccinations or worming the puppies have received.    Fourth, you don't know what environment the puppies have been raised in. Have they been carefully socialized in a home environment or have they been outside in a barn barely seeing a human more than two or three times a day to be fed. And were they handled and touched during that time?    I would be very cautious and apprehensive about getting a puppy at a farmer's market. Even a puppy from a shelter has had shots and attention and care and socialization and somebody looking over them everyday.     I hope this helps. If you have further questions, feel free to contact me at jackie@thesocialpet.com.
NyZW8o1Kaa	He's Bounty Hunting in Hawaii!  Ask him, he'll probably say since your too selfish to take me out, I'm pissin where I want too! Now There!   Take him out!  Take him out!   Take him out!  Take him out!   Take him out!  Take him out!   Take him out!  Take him out!   Take him out!  Take him out!   Take him out!  Take him out!   Take him out!  Take him out!   Take him out!  Take him out!       Get the picture?  Good Luck,  ;-)|`|6Ss31wyBaa	He is still a puppy and confused. Make sure you are rewarding/praising him for using the pad when he does.|`|TsFG4zLmaa	where is he going pee now?   it is not too cold out, by dog weights 5 pounds, and i live in chicago, and it is very cold.     go out with him, it only takes a second    don't let the dog use the pad unless you want him to always pee in the house.  that is what you are teaching him, if it's ok for him to pee on the pad now, and you take it away, don't get mad if he keeps peeing in that same spot.|`|b46935e51173f254db10092f55afe9b6aa	he is a PUP|`|eY49t8Swaa	get him a better wee wee pad lol|`|m3iPgBWFaa	idk maybe there is an odor or something on the pad that makes him not wanna go on it|`|6HMgT5LCaa	Take him outside.  Dogs can stand the cold.|`|WNB4Vojsaa	firmly squeeze his belly|`|IkXU06wpaa	is he a chihuahua cuz they **** everywhere & shiver|`|rjac15O0aa	He is exploring his options.  Next time he gos on the pad give him praise.  Keep it up for a while and then when it warms up, put the pad outside.|`|5msDR7hZaa	he's a puppy so it will take some time...also, once it gets warmer outside you can start having a better schedule for him to go outside.  it will all work out|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Why are you not house breaking him outside?  Pee pads confuse dogs because you are telling him it's OK to do business in the house, but then reprimanding him for doing business in the house.  Start taking him outside on a leash on a regular basis (when he wakes up, about 30 minutes after he eats, after he plays, etc...) when he goes outside, praise him.  Our pups go outside from day one at 8 weeks and we live in VT.  Your dog will be fine.|`|LYQM0lKgaa	when he poops or pees on the carpet or wherever you don't want him to go, pick him up and put it nose about an inch away from the mess. in a firm tone, say "no! not here!" and then set him down in his wee wee pad and look at him firmly with your arms crossed.|`|AA10500537	its only a puupy it takes up yo 4 months to totally train a puppy|`|iMOePEWlaa	well besides the fact that he is very young,pee pads are not recomended by most profetanals becaus dogs have troble understanding that they can "go" on one part of the floor but not another part. while a dog may get used to them and do fine for years,when a dog starts to get older he/she will start to have problem again due to vision and memory issues.     while i highly advise aginst pee pads i realize it is your decsion. just be patent and keep working with him,he is young and with a bit more work im sure he will do fine.|`|0rpS2b97aa	Be patient with puppies regarding training.  Sometimes it is 4 months before they are able to control themselves.  Just like a baby, there bodies have to adjust.  All you can do is scold and use repetition.  Always carry the dog back to the pad if there is an accident and scold.|`|O2eOFeXHaa	get a new dog.|`|13JdKfSdaa	try to take him outside for a few mins.|`|l8Q3n8WUaa	SOMETIMES DOGS GET FED UP WITH DAT N  THEY WOULD RATHER BE OUTSIDE N DO WAT THEY DO LIKE SNIFF HERE N THERE...

0hTvKlD5aa	Rescues occasionally have babies. Try looking on Petfinder for rescues- even if they don't have any, you can fill out an application and they'll call you when little ones come in.      Breeders are pretty rare- I would look online. You may have to have the baby shipped and some probably won't do that.    But a rescue is probably your best bet. Testing facilities sometimes breed ferrets for medical testing and then surrender the excess to rescues. Good luck.      At least 95% of the pet ferrets in the US come from Marshall Farms, which supplies ferrets to Petco and other pet stores. These are the same ferrets in shelters- they all come from the same place, and there's not the same level of overpopulation that there is with dogs and cats. If you've got your heart set on a baby, do look at rescues and for breeders first- but I wouldn't feel as guilty going to Petco.|`|DneIgg9qaa	its depends on where you live.. for instance is california it is illegal to sell ferrets...
mXEOcSeuaa	Yes!  It's a dominance thing.  I have two neutered male rabbits that do the same thing.|`|H4Dqfepiaa	:) mine do that too, sighs.    Yes, it's normal, usually it's because they're neutered after they've been sexually mature for at least a few months.|`|UlBryfIoaa	normal... well I have seen them do it a few times. I think they do it out of boredom. Its not like they can get pregnant so I think you should just let them do their thing.|`|DhiwcfVbaa	rabbits seem to hump each other, whether they are neutered or not. even females do it, i had 2 females who used to hump each other all the time!!!
xtRm5NV5aa	A hamster living over four years isn't very common, as their life span is generally given as 2-3 years.   But i will definitely recommend paper pulp bedding (fluffy, brown, dye-free kind) and a mix of seeds, veggies, fruit, grain. Mix it up for your hamster. Variety will keep them healthy, just like it does for people.  As far as cages, my little guy is hitting his first birthday soon and he's been in your average little cage, but we make sure to take him out and give him lots of space whenever possible.|`|gTXUcd1maa	Relax. Your hamster is going to be fine. Don't use cedar bedding. Just treasure the time you have with your hamster now, and don't be so obsessed with how long it will live. It's going to live as long as it can, case closed.  Good luck  P.S. The normal lifespan is only 2-3 years. 4+ is rare|`|9A5UgnNVaa	I had a Syrian hamster who lived about 4 years. I don't really remember much, because I was 9 when he died, but I believe we used pine bedding. We gave him lots of fruits and vegetables like lettuce, carrots, and strawberries, and I played with him a lot, often more than once a day. He had a two level wire cage.|`|li0E9CjIaa	i had a gerbil that lived almost 5 years. i just kept the same stuff?|`|Ic3hceIOaa	My teddy bear hamster lived about 4 1/2 years. There's nothing specific to do exactly. Make sure he can't get out of his cage and play and exercise him often and that's all the advice I can give you. It just depends on the hamster itself not on what you do.|`|V6Zoz4GYaa	yup mine lived 10 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            joking
xoXkHOVsaa	You need to demonstrate that you are responsible.  Write down a list of everything this lizard needs and how much it will cost.  Talk to your parents calmly about how you plan to take care of this lizard.      A sudan plated lizard will need a large habitat because they get quite large.  Your parents may feel like this is too expensive.  Research leopard geckos and bearded dragons, these lizards are easy to handle and will cost less.|`|vjpqvrlsaa	OOOOh    i remember beining young...here are some of the things i tried when i wanted a lizard.    "if you loved me you'd buy me a lizard"  "thats not fair, my friend.....has one"  "if (your sisters name) asked for one, you'd get her one"  "I'll look after it and pay for it"  "i know what i want for christmas/birthday (whichever comes first)"    orrr, you could just buy one and all the stuff when there out all day and put it in your room, once you actually have it, they rrley get rid of it.    or just beg and beg and beg sometimes it works.    i never got a lizard...i ended up with a cat hahah
PVMsr2Faaa	Traps work, poison works but if you really want to get rid of them, then you have to find out how they are getting in.|`|oGVWdnHraa	With the traps....|`|vGCetYmAaa	well my dad is and exterminator (lol),so in his storys of work I'vee learned a few things.   well there is probably more than one rat, they usually don't come alone!  well is the exterminator didn't put the traps in a paper bag you could do that.  that makes it easier to clean up, so once you catch the rat you can just pick up the bag aand through it away.  they love sunflower see i hear!  it might take a few days or so to catch it (or them), so just make sure that you don't leave any food laying around, and try to be quiet so that the rat will come out and get moving so that it will go into a trap.  the reason why the rats come out at night mostly is because they like quiet, and when your asleep your less of a threat.  good luck with the rat, i hope this helped!  ~RACHEL~|`|IFGSOd16aa	keep it as a pet :)|`|hdQvbs0naa	I have a liiiiiittle bit of trouble believing that a rat came and bit your sister three times..?! Is she made out of peanut butter or something? :P But I would suggest getting rid of the sticky traps which are unnecessarily cruel. Other than that I suppose all you do is wait for a trap to catch it.. if you mean what things you could put in it, try peanut butter! :P|`|g52GRYulaa	I am sorry i don't no wat 2 do. Get some cheese then trap it|`|Y8WDdPCvaa	get a jack russel terrier (dog if you don't know) they will do the job!|`|ylg9ejceaa	Try a product called DeCon. Its a rat poision in pellet form. We put it out every few months and never see rats/mice. It really cheap too. Just a few bucks for 3 trays of pellets. You can tuck them under the beds, or under cabinets. Check them and you should be able to tell if they've came and ate some of it. The good thing about it is that the pellets make them incredibly thirsty. They say the rats will leave your house in search of water, so you won't have a dead rat in the bed with you.|`|t5m73eE8aa	My friend and i would set out bread or anything they like and wait all night for them and shoot them with the BB gun lol i think we killed like hundreds didn't need a cat|`|eyQBvbzraa	THROW BORIC ACID BEHIND THE FRIDGE AND STOVE AND ANYWHERE THAT YOUR SISTER CANT GO. IT WILL LICK IT AND WHEN IT GETS WATER IT WILL BLOW UP INSIDE. WORKS FOR ROACHES TOO. RAT POISON IS AN OPTION. THE GLUE TRAPS SHOULD BE PLACED AGAINST WALLS BECAUSE THATS HOW THEY TRAVEL, ALONG THE BASEBOARDS. IF I WERE YOU I'D BE FREAKING OUT AND SINCE IT SEEMS MOVING ISNT AN OPTION FOR YOU THEN I WOULD COOK A HAMBURGER AND TAKE THE FAT THAT HAS ALL THE FLAVOR OF THE BURGER AND PUT SOME RIGHT ON THE TRAP. THEY WILL SMELL IT AND GO FOR IT GUARANTEED.ONCE I CAUGHT THE SUCKER IS ANOTHER PROBLEM. HOW DO YOU PICK IT UP WHEN IT IS ALIVE ON THE GLUE TRAP. I WOULD GET A GARBAGE PAIL AND TAPE A DUSTPAN TO THE END OF MY BROOM AND THROW INTO THE GARBAGE THAT WAY. THEN TAKE IT OUTSIDE AND FILL THE PAIL WITH WATER AND DROWN IT.SORRY ABOUT THE CAPS. MY EYES ARE HURTING TODAY.THE PROBLEM WITH POISONS IS THAT YOU DONT KNOW ITS DEAD TILL YOU SMELL IT AND THEN YOU HAVE TO FIND IT. ARE YOU SURE ITS ONLY ONE? ALSO, IT SOUNDS CRAZY BUT MOTH BALLS OUTSIDE YOU HOUSE AROUND THE HOUSE UNDER CABINETS ETC ARE ENOUGH TO KEEP SNAKES AWAY AND OTHER ANIMALS SO I THINK YOU MAY WANT TO DO THAT TOO.|`|li0E9CjIaa	i agree with the jack russel! we have one (the big furry kind) and it does the job ;)|`|euFDn0FBaa	I have been bit by a rat on the lip when I was sleeping and it is a known fact they usually go after children..

If you've decided to keep the wild mouse seperate him into another cage.|`|msAh2tItaa	first r u sure you didn't buy a pregnant mouse at the pet store if you are sure she want pregnant when you got her then you definitely need to get a different cage for the tame mouse as the male will continue to breed her the male will not normally kill the babies though so that should not be an issue.however he will breed her right after she has her litter she will go into heat the day after she gives birth so either move her to an aquarium with a heavy mesh lid that he cant get into a 20 gallon long would be great for her and her litter til they are 4 weeks old then you should remove all male babies to a separate cage as they will soon be ready to breed.
msh6LyTfaa	Well, firstly at the moment it is winter so this may be affecting their appetite because naturally they go to sleep and stop feeding. Some react more strongly to this time of year in captivity than others.     Secondly your snake might be further put off eating by the fact she is currently due for a shed and many will go lethargic and disinterested during this time.     It is common for some snakes to refuse meals, and I have had trouble with a couple of my baby corns too. I find most of the time it is related to nervousness, ie they might be afraid of the food item, I have noticed these kinds often don't like being watched by you or even feeling you're in the room, if you feed them in something they feel exposed in eg a plastic tub (as I do quite often) then they might not like it. There are lots of tips on how to make food smell nicer and stuff but I have never found these work for me and it has always been an issue of security. I have one 'odd' one who is nervous but I think her lack of eating is also down to a poor, sporadic appetite and she has now taken to eating but only once a fortnight...and when she decides to finally eat something she eats well, maybe eating 2-3 food items which I m happy about because then it'll last her longer. Once before she went into quite a depressed state where she went longer than this and I was forced in the end to force feed her. You can't really force feed a whole food item safely. Therefore I took someone's advice and got a mousetail from a larger mouse, made it wet and slid it down her throat. It's not fun, but it started her digestion up again and a little while later she resumed feeding. But don't try this until you've tried something else and it has gone longer than 4 weeks say, and you really think they're going to die or lose all condition if you don't get some food down them.      To make the shy ones feel more secure I have tried various things such as draping a towel over the tub I feed them in. Or putting them in a warmed cup which I cover with something dark. I feed outside of their housing so substrate doesn't stick to the food and so I can see more easily and quicky if they have eaten it. I might try putting a hide in the tub they're in as well. Last resort I put it in their housing inside their hide. I use carboard tubes for hides but if you use substrate you might want to put it on a piece of kitchen towel. One nervy baby has a hide made from the end of a poster tube and i put the food in there and he always eats it, as long as I make sure i put him in there with it. If you always dangle food and expect them to strike this might be a problem...so try just leaving the food. I have an adult who will not eat in front of you, he even rattles if you walk in the room again after you've put the food down. So I use a closed hide like a box for him, and while disturbing him as little as possible, drop the food in and close it, then go.      If these thing don't work, then you can try making the food smell better...You can make some blood/fluid come from the nose of the mouse, or make a small slit in the belly. The guy from BHB reptiles even says rubbing some tinned tuna on it works...haven't tried it myself but you never know. Make sure the food is warm before offering it, perhaps by leaving for a short while in some warm water, I always dry mine off properly after because I find mine don't like it steamy. With the new snake it might just not be settled in yet. Make sure it has hides at both ends of the tank, has a warm end and a cool end..and that the temp is right. You could always try a different kind of food eg rat (remember the sizes of rats are bigger so for a small adult corn you might only want a weaner), i occasionally feed a chick...but these aren't suitable to feed all the time due to having low calcium and there's always a chance if he gets feeding on something like this he could get 'addicted' and not want anything else.    Lastly you say you feed two fuzzies a week. My babies are about 7 months old too, and I can honestly say that i think 1 fuzzy a week is enough, even for my biggest one. I only feed more to ones that have previously been refusing or are looking small, but otherwise they look way too full, are never able to fully empty their system before the feed and gradually get chubby...but you may have a big one, if so sorry!.       Rest assured it is common for people who keep and breed snakes to have this going on.|`|K6rZmVmAaa	Yes this is quite normal for snakes. Make sure that the vivarium is the correct temp, and has water available. I'd try to feed again in a week if she doesn't eat it within half hour take it out and don't try again till the following week, if she still doesn't eat that week leave it for 2 weeks.  This can go on for months so don't worry if it does. Try give her some thickish brantches to climb on if you haven't already (ones off fruit trees are good or pet shop bought). Good luck|`|WJrznvvRaa	dont feed it for two weeks then try one fuzzy or one pinky after two weeks. your probably feeding it too much in one week.|`|qCNokYolaa	Twice weekly, two fuzzies are you kidding ?    You are over feeding.    Snakes are greedy and will generally eat anything you put in but bloody hell, give her time to digest what she has already had.  Once a week is more than enough.      Give her a week or so and then try her with something, if she doesn't want it, then pierce the skull of the fuzzy to allow a little blood out, that should do the trick.    Do the same with the new snake, he just needs time to adjust to his new surroundings.    Edit: Try moving her up to a small mouse weekly instead of filling her up on fuzzies.|`|aebFUVdgaa	an obese snakes lifespan is almost half that of a healthy regular fed, i.e once weekly, specimen. you are over feeding your original corn.as for your new arrival i wouldn't worry just yet, they can go the best part of a year if required but this is not the norm, try dipping the mouse in hot water immediately before offering it to your snake, this increases the smell and the snakes heat sensing pits come into play due to the heat given off. if you have them housed together never leave them unsupervised whilst eating or you will end up with 1 fat snake. you may want to consider worming your snake as an infested animals gut can be so full of internal parasites that as far as the host is concerned he/she physically feels full and so has no desire to eat. but it is far more likely that your new snake just needs time to adjust to hes new surroundings. good luck!|`|gXYD12zDaa	There are several possible problems, firstly you are clearly over feeding the baby Corn snake.  It could just not be so hungry, so try to go a week or two with out feeding it.    Secondly, the temperature cold be too hot or cold, which would change the snake's metabolism and make it less hungry.    Stress is also a major factor in why snakes refuse food, as snakes are built to hide and use stealth.  If stressed they will wait for a better/ safer opportunity to eat.  This could be the problem, particularly with the new (3 year old) corn snake.  Stress is increased by over handling, a change in living standards/ location (hence why the new snake isn't eating), introduction of new animals (if these two snakes are sharing a cage) and being housed in a place with high levels of human traffic/ disturbance.    My advice would be to leave the snakes alone for a week or so, without handling/ disturbing or feeding them.  Then attempt to feed the snakes.  Repeat for the following weeks if not initially successful, and if this continues for a month+ seek further advice from a reptile specialist, breeder or vet.    Good luck.
M9o5WpOqaa	No-they have natural oils in the fur to help protect them,and should never be bathed in water.Go to your local pet store and find Chinchilla Bath powder;it's the safest thing for him.It's also recommended for hamsters and gerbils.

xoXkHOVsaa	I suspect that the hamster is a lot older than you think.  Either that or it has some kind of congenital defect.  You can feed him porridge (no flavor or sugar), baby food, soft bread, or soak his hamster food to moisten it.  The teeth may or may not grow back.      Take him to the vet and see what they can do.  I don't know how much it would cost in the UK, but if your hamster gets sicker and is suffering you should have it put down.
ULpjTKYDaa	Rabbits are very clean animals, but their urine can acquire a strong, ammonialike smell in a matter of hours. This odor can damage your rabbit's respiratory system and cause pneumonia, which can be fatal. Be sure to clean your rabbit's cage, play area and litter box every one to two days.      Step1Mix equal portions of white vinegar and water in a spray bottle; label the bottle.   Step2  Rinse and scrub your rabbit's play area thoroughly with this vinegar and water solution to keep calcium residues down and help control odors.   Step3  Rinse thoroughly with water to eliminate the white vinegar smell. Many rabbits don't like the smell of vinegar, so they won't urinate in an area where they smell it. Use paper towels to scrub and dry the area.   Step4  Make sure no urine has seeped under your rabbit's litter box. Clean this area as well as the litter box (see "How to Clean Your Rabbit's Litter Box," under Related eHows).   Step5 Clean any areas where the urine has seeped using the white vinegar and warm water solution, then rinse thoroughly to remove the vinegar smell.     Step6Use the same solution to blot any urine stains on your carpet, upholstery or clothing, or use straight white vinegar  .   Step7Use a broom or a vacuum cleaner to clean up any droppings or fur that your rabbit leaves as he hops about the room. Rabbits tend to be territorial and often deposit droppings as they hop about in an effort to declare the area their territory.       yes of coarse he will!  he will be so happy rabbits are ment to live out side as they can handle the cold better than heat.  just make sure you give him the write food plenty or water and of coarse plenty of love!!|`|oGVWdnHraa	The cage is fine, but you have to be willing to spend a lot of time with him/her or he/she will become agressive and withdrawn, and rabbit bites arent fun!    As for feeding, they need to have fresh veggies at least three times a week, as well as 1/2 a cup of food for every 2 kgs of optimum body weight. Spaying/neutering is very beneficial as it stops them from marking their territory, makes them less agressive and reduces the risk of the rabbit contracting reproductive cancers.     As for cleaning, it needs to be done often, I do mine everyday,  but if you toilet train (its really easy:) its easier to clean the cage out because all the mess is in one spot :D    You should do a lot of research before you jump in and get a bunny, as you dont want it to be something you will regret :)|`|Oti6JXJIaa	he willl, but dont keep him outside he wont like it or have a good life.do it a favor and buy a cage for inside it will appreciate it very much. :)|`|b4fAmxOxaa	it will probably be ok, however rabbits smell bad, inside or out. messy!!! i have had every animal that i can think of and rabbits are my least favorite and i am a huge animal lover.|`|xR5mCcD8aa	I have three rabbits they all live outside in Ontario.They have a heat lamp.The temperatures go down to -30 sometimes.

JGq9rKBOaa	There are commercial hedgehog foods available, but nobody quite knows if that's a complete diet. I'd err on the side of caution and do a 50/50 mix of hedgehog kibble and cat kibble.     For the cat food, read through the ingredients. I don't know what brands are available in the UK, so I don't have any specific recommendations. Look for a food that contains mostly MEAT, not fillers like corn, wheat, soy, or beet pulp. You don't want a grain-based diet, and a lot of the cheaper foods include a lot of grains. You definitely want the first few ingredients to be named meats - no "by-products" or generic "meat" or "poultry." If you have the brand Wellness available, I'd recommend that. If not, read some labels.    Also, you can feed fresh fruits and veggies, as well as live insects. I wouldn't feed any wild-caught insects, but you can buy live crickets at pet stores, and mealworms and nightcrawlers at bait shops.|`|46Mxaw13aa	no dont feed it any of that stuff u can buy commercial hedgehog food at petsmart or petco sunseed makes it and both stores carry it hope i helped.|`|USt4MZSBaa	i would think a type of plant like grass :/|`|T8iwlxxDaa	I would'nt feed your hedgehog kitten food because that is too fattening, so you should use adult cat food that is for overwieght cats. We use low fat chicken soup for the cat lovers soul, and low fat wellness cat food. They need low fat cat food because they can gain wieght easily. I would also buy two differnet kinds of cat food becuase no one excacly knows the type of ingrediants they need in there food. So you should mix two different brand names together.
hIyjdXr9aa	"Medusa" significa "jellyfish" en ingles.  Tambien puedes usar "malagua", "aguaviva", o "aguamala".    Here, look here:  Wordreference.com is really great translator website.  http://www.wordreference.com/es/translat...    And remember that if you're ever stuck referring to an animal in a foreign language, use its taxonomy name (ctenophore).  The word ctenophore is neither English nor Spanish, but rather is called "binomial nomenclature" and is universal.
hIyjdXr9aa	Male gouramis will become as territorial with bettas as another male betta would.  Keep that in mind; I once left my male crowntail betta alone with a gourami for three hours when I was moving and when I came back, the gourami was looking up at me with big wide innocent eyes while its mouth was nibbling on the dying betta.  Ew.    Avoid other anabatoids (fish of the same "labyrinth organ" family as the betta).  Any male fish of that family has the potential for aggression with your betta.  This means only one male betta per tank.      You can try a female betta, because a male crowntail is slower than female bettas and he won't be able to catch and kill her (some males want to do that, other males get along with females).  Just watch them carefully the first hour or so after you put the female in and make sure they get along.  9 out of ten crowntail bettas in my experience appreciate a female in the tank.  Your aquarium is 12 gallons, so there ought to be a few plants and hiding spaces in case they're not the best of friends.  But they should get along.  Here's a picture of my male crowntail betta and female veiltale betta sleeping together under a light if you don't believe me.  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v415/O...    You can generally put in any peaceful fish with a betta.  I have an aquarium right now with swordtails, mollies, platies, and a male betta.  The betta minds his own business, chasing his reflection in the glass.  They're great community fish.  Just avoid other male anabatoids.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	A small school of cory catfish is probably the best option. Because they are peacefull bottom dwellers they will ignore the betta, and vice versa.

Tetras of all kinds, bottom feeders, mollies, platies. etc     the only fish they can't be kept with is another male betta.    as far as how many fish in your tank, the general rule of thumb is 1 inch of fish per gallon. Keep in mind this is 1 inch of a grown fish, not the smaller one you buy that will grow larger
Ms8b2kISaa	My aunt has 3 cats and a Teacup Yorkie, and they get along great. The Yorkie is only about 2-3 pounds, since she's a Teacup, a regular Yorkie will get a bit heavier and larger. Personally, I wouldn't recommend a Dachshund (Wiener dog), because they, like many little terrier type dogs, were bred to hunt small animals, and they tend to be a little scrappy, at least in my experiences. A Chihuahua would be OK, and maybe even an Italian Greyhound. The Italian Greyhound is considerably taller than any of these others, but is very dainty and light. I would image they only get up to 15 pounds, if that, and have nice demeanors. Good luck in your search!|`|FFIyTqNzaa	weener dog small fun wiegh idk no more than 20 pounds|`|JGffjeNBaa	Although it would be ideal to have a small dog usually the small dogs are the most aggressive towards cats and DONT GET A TERRIER!!!

UbSJPBuNaa	that is a really good deal you should buy it. an average 60 gallon cost around 200 dollars|`|HKuQuE4Yaa	It sounds like a pretty good deal, but you need to know what kind of fish you want.  If the tank comes with fish you don't like you have to know what to do with them.  Also, depending on what kind of filter it is, you may want to purchase a new one.  I know that most starter kits for 55 gal tanks have a lame filter that needs help.|`|UaLlyLAaaa	That's a REALLY good deal. Where are you getting it, i would like to get a cheap tank too. =]]
NBfBKI1Uaa	I would rather go with the wet dry filter if you already have all the equipment needed to set it up.    Wet dry filter is much more superior to a HOB aquaclear filters. With a wet dry you get more volume added to the water and thus increasing your stocking capacity.     You have higher filtration media surface and thus much larger bacteria colony.

I wouldnt add any more fish. Your test results are great and your aquarium is cycled. Just make sure you keep your numbers about where they are.
NBfBKI1Uaa	Thirst is the desire to drink water due to dehydration. Thus in loose contest. fish also dehydrate due to excess or lack of mineral (salt) in their body. And thus need water to control the mineral concentration in their fluid system. And they acquire this water by osmosis primarily through their gills.     And thus technically fish do become thirst.  But unlike in humans it is not a desire and something they can control.      On the question of sleep, fish don't actually sleep but rather rest. In reality, the function of sleep in human is to rest our body so that it can rejuvenate.     Although technically they don't sleep but rather perform a very similar function by resting. And that is why you sometime see your fishes at the bottom of the tank motionless during the night.      -rds|`|fhHAq6Wmaa	My fish fall asleep when I turn out the lights of the aquarium.

Just before I do, I always find them picking their favorite spots on the tank floor and sitting there.

OsVswissaa	It will help a little but it won't be like having an instant cycle.  There is beneficial bacteria on surfaces but the most bacteria is in the filter, because of the current and air flow.  I understand you'll be using a new filter, can you possibly take a little of the filter media out and put it in your new filter?  Or(I don't know if you're in a hurry)  you can take the new filter media and shove it in the filter in the cycled tank.  The new media will grow it's own colony in about two weeks and then you can use it in the new tank.  That's usually what I do when I need a new tank, I find it the easiest option for me.  You can also add the entire new filter to your established tank and grow a colony in it that way.  Again, it will take about two weeks.|`|klbvBgU7aa	Yes and no.     Yes, because there is good bacteria established in the gravel and decor. No, because there is a very large colony of good bacteria in your biological filter. Are you using the same filter? If not, take the biofilter from you current filter and place it in your new filter set up.     Even with moving everything over (including the biofilter), you will most likely still have a mini-cycle, but it will be much smaller and less stressful to your fish than the original cycle, and it probably won't last very long.|`|TmUQbODJaa	The water should be good, but clean the rocks and decor with dechlorinated water.  It should be cycled, it worked for my betta tank. The water  is cycled, because it has went through the necessary poop-bacteria-water cahnge- poop, etc, etc  If you have an external filter, you can cut the sponge in half and transferr it to the new tank's filter.  To be on the safe side, let it run for a week, depending on how big it is and test the water.  Good Luck!|`|F15EPx0Taa	It will help your aquarium to cycle faster. The aquarium filter is what helps cycle your aquarium. It builds up good bacteria and that breaks down waste.|`|ZGFXBie9aa	I know you said that you will be using another filter, do put the old filter in the new tank!    There's nothing wrong with running two filters at the same time.    You can do this until bacteria builds up in your new filter, or even just leave it, which will be beneficial for your tank.    If there is no room on your new tank for a second filter, take the filter cartridges out of your old one and put them in the new one. (if possible).  You can do this by either sticking them where the cartridges belong on the new one, or if it is a hang-on-back filter, placing them down in the 'bucket' type part of it.|`|Jguzosm2aa	No, though it would speed up the process. Most of the bacteria is present in the water, so only a small amount of the essential bacteria is brought into the new tank.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Yes you can transfer the cycle to a new tank.    The most important thing is the filter, thats where most of the cycle bacteria live. Some live on the gravel and ornaments too. The water doesn't really matter.    Ian|`|PqT6pQAoaa	I would say yes since you are just transferring the bacteria into another tank. I assume you are moving the filter as well? Im not too sure but i think it would be cycled. Lets see what other people say.|`|HKuQuE4Yaa	I would think this should work.  What happens during cycling is that you are allowing beneficial bacteria to grow on the substrate and in the filter, so if you transfer all the substrate and use the same filter with water, you should be fine.|`|7HxJvbjMaa	If you are transferring rocks, decor and water... but not the old filter and medium then you will still have to cycle for a time until the new filter builds up a good bio-load.   If you are also transferring the old filter and medium to the new tank you should be ok. And I strongly suggest running your old filter along with the new one for several weeks until the new one is seeded.  I am assuming that you are upgrading to a bigger tank? You will be topping it off with new water? You should still keep an eye on it and test for nitrates/nitrites/ammonia... but it should be fine. Definitely do-able.
TjLCnxkKaa	The thorough rinse is the important step. A mild bleach solution is probably the most thorough way of sterilizing an empty tank. As long the tank is empty. Bleach is not suitable for gravel etc. which you can boil.   A high salt content in hot (not boiling) water would be my next choice.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	When I cleaned out my tank to use for fish I scrubbed it once with baking soda, and once with vinegar.|`|OsVswissaa	salt and vinegar and lemon are okay for cleaning, but they're not disinfectants.  It won't hurt anything as long as you rinse and rinse and rinse.  Most tanks, once they're empty and dried out, don't carry a lot of bad bugs anyway, most of that stuff needs moisture.  That being said, plain bleach is still the best disinfectant.|`|lzKt3RtOaa	I used vinegar on mine and it worked great. Gets rid of the deposits. I used my pump during this process with no fish of course. Then rinse it out a couple of times and then when you fill let the water set a couple of days or else treat it properly. Good Luck.|`|vp0WdER8aa	heres what i did and my fish was fine until he died for some reason    1) drain out all excess water from the tank    2) add new warm water with no water conditioner and let it sit there for 1 day    3) drain out all the water again    4) and let it air dry for 2 days    5) rinse the tank thoroughly and decor with warm water    with un-treated tap water in the tank, the chemicals in the tap water is killing off any bad bacteria, then when you air dry you are letting any EXTRA bad bacteria die off because no bacteria from water can survive more than 24 hours when exposed to air.  take care!
