sasCNN0zaa	Don't worry hunny, I use to have this problem all the time. They would just show up when the time wasn't right. I used Proactive and it did not work for me so i ended up going to the Dermat. He said the best cleanser out there is Cetaphil to get all oil and dirt out of the pores. Used very hot water when washing your face to open the pores so the cleanser can get in there and work its magic. Also another thing that I swear buy is taking a cotton ball, saturating it with peroxide and rubbing it on the face. Peroxide is the only ingredient in this medication my doctor gave me. This will kill bacteria and dry up those pimples!!:) Good Luck!|`|zfHmUfEtaa	actually, I have a breakout right now that I am treating with a oatmeal, honey, olive oil and crushed garlic paste (morning and night) and then I leave a little crushed garlic oil on the pimples before I go to bed. during the day I use cocoa butter as a moisturizer. it's working for me?

This will also help with other things like frequent illness etc. Or if you don't do daily laundry, buy several pillowcases and just change them every day. It really helps a lot. Also, if you have to wear makeup, only wear it when you are not at home. Wash it off as soon as you can with plain water or mild, unperfumed soap. The mineral brush-on makeups are best. (For your skin and for covering up problem areas. Let your skin breathe as much as possible, and don't smoke or stand near smokers. The toxins and tar in the smoke can clog your pores.  Hope this helps. Worked wonders for me within days. I had it bad!!!!|`|vtDl2w0Vaa	I use Proactiv, and it works for me. Make sure you use it every morning and every night. First, make sure your face is a little damp before you start. Use the face scrub and rinse with warm water. Then, pat your face dry. Use the blue stuff and put a little on the cotton ball. Make sure you put enough on to cover your whole face, but you don't need to soak the cotton ball. Then rub the cotton ball all over your face. Try to scrub a little harder where you have acne the worst. It might burn a little, but that means it's working. If it burns too much though, you might want to ask your doctor. Then, don't rinse that and just let it air dry. Then get another cotton ball and put a tiny bit of the stuff in the smallest white bottle (I forget what it's called). You don't need a lot because you only need to put it on your pimples, not your entire face. Rub the stuff in a little bit so that it's not a white blob, but you don't want to scrub it in.<br>  <br>  Do this every morning and every night. You might even notice a difference the next day! <br>  <br>  You can also use the refining mask at night.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope I helped! :)|`|aecb87753b7a91041ba0f8e18327da41aa	when i was a teenage and had face issues i used a very old natural thing: lemon. rub it all over your face and let the juice dry for like 20 minutes. it itches like hell and you have to do it at night because lemon in the sun can stain your skin, but the acid dries out the zits, pimples, whatever you have and leaves the skin nice and soft. you might have to do this for 2 or 3 days if the acne persists and make sure to put on moisturizing cream afterwards. the results are very good.|`|jaOEtAHKaa	Hi there frnd...

WneD1JMRaa	First of all I suggest a wig that is fairly long in length so it looks for feminine. A wig with a fringe would help him pull it off so it is covering part of his forehead and can create more of an illusion that he is a girl.

I would also steer clear of wigs that layer into the face as it could bring out hes face more.<br>  <br>  I think a gothic sort of dark look would be good. Because dark colors can cover his body up better than light colors.<br>  <br>  I would make him look very lady like but with a dark side so he can act shy but nasty so he doesnt have to smile too much or talk too much.<br>  <br>  I think a pair of black stockings would look great under a dark blue or green dress. <br>  <br>  <br>  Something like this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_x4gXsXceFi0/SJ4pXesb3EI/AAAAAAAAAcM/ahEIfPIJn3I/s400/ange+after+dark+dress.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_x4gXsXceFi0/SJ...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_x4gXsXceFi0/SJ4pX8Z8wJI/AAAAAAAAAcU/6vh7zaof34w/s400/ANGE+AFTER+DARK+DRESS2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_x4gXsXceFi0/SJ...</a><br>  <br>  Or this dress:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://j.bdbphotos.com/fashion/pictures/4L/92/10492_large.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://j.bdbphotos.com/fashion/pictures/...</a><br>  <br>  minus the gap in the bust area.<br>  <br>  <br>  A dress that has a high enough neckline and doesnt hug his figure too tightly.

I suggest a hand bag or something similar. But be careful, you dont want to bring attention to masculine features.<br>  <br>  May I also suggest getting acrylic nails put on him.

Shave his legs (unless he's gonna wear pants) shave his arms and especially make sure he has absolutely NO stubble on his face!!!<br>  <br>  And finally, make sure he can talk and laugh like a girl.

If he's as skinny as you say, then his legs would be the biggest give away. If there's no dress, there's no need to shave the legs.  Curvy fit jeans would be best as they would add some flesh to his but and give him a more feminine figure, which would be good. Something with a high neck, like one of those jumpers with the neck that stops just under your ears!! Fitted as well. Probably a padded bra as well. <br>  <br>  FACE<br>  Make up is definite. You should try to draw attention to the eyes, as they cant be that masculine but keep off the lipstick as that would draw attention to his stronger jaw line, and reduce his femininity. Try and use shading and rouge on his cheeks too, as this will give him more cheek bones and a delicate look. And hide any stubble!!<br>  You should pluck and shape his eyebrows as well, and try to lighten them as this will make his brow line less prominent.<br>  <br>  HAIR<br>  You should defiantly get him to grow his hair. Try to dye it blonde, too make him look less dark. You should get him to have a fringe that is slightly too long and shape his hair around his face. If you have it t the shoulders and flick it towards the neck and curl the fringe under, this will make him look very feminine. <br>  <br>  ACCESSORIES<br>  If you could get him to perice his ears, that would be good. And make him wear really feminine ear rings, like flowers or hearts.<br>  And give him a huge bag and high heels, which will put people off saying aything, even if they do guess he's a boy<br>  <br>  GAIT<br>  You should teach him to walk sit and talk like a girl. Get him to say as little as possible, pretend to be sh and hide behind his hair.  CRoss his legs when he sits, and stand behind you when you talk. Try and keep him looking down, as that will hide his face.<br>  <br>  Hope it works!!!!!<br>  imogenalinamo@hotmail.co.uk
adyNCp6eaa	Okay this is what you do: Make him grow his hair out, do not cut it at ALL. You should also teach him how to be a girl. For example, make sure he is always clean, and teach him to look in the mirror often and fix ANY flaws he sees. make him grow his nails out and file them so they look girly. For a costume, he should be a playboy bunny lol. with the little ears and skanky dress. Make him put water balloons in his shirt, but with a skin color long-sleeve tight shirt under the dress. When the day comes, make him shave his legs, pits, arms & face. Lots of makeup. Foundation, pink eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara & lipgloss. Maybe even some mousse in his hair(which by that time will be long, i'm not sure how long tho) make him scrunch his hair with the mousse so its wavy. OO and maybe even make him get side bangs!! That would totally help out with the look! The day before make him get a manicure with french tips. Do all of this and noone will suspect that he is a boy. Hope I helped! Good luck! email me pics!

9wtpCNb6aa	Yeah well water flushes out your system so even if it doesnt help in your case to clear up your skin, you should still be drinking the water anyway.<br>  <br>  Could also be your time of the month perhaps?<br>  <br>  Have you changed your face creams or washes?  Sometimes if you use a face scrub too harhly it can bring out spots.  Make sure you eat your RDA of fruit and veg, drink the water, use simple face creams and face washes.  Try to avoid face wipes as they dont really do as good a job as an actual wash.  And see if you notice a difference.

They are great for the body, hands, and you can even use them on your face because they won't clog pores.|`|BAPj9JW3aa	cetaphil daily moisturizer with spf 15 is amazing and under $12 at drugstores.|`|LuAa7Nypaa	Dove, <3 It's soft, and smells really good!|`|zfHmUfEtaa	Cocoa butter at night all the way and Aveda botanical kinetics hydrating lotion. Hands down winner. Cocoa butter heals while aveda softens. perfect combo.|`|DL5vxzBHaa	I use Olay for sensitive skin and find it very good.
EmRuVzBGaa	The sheerly nudes palette is quite nice and natural, however, contains lots of shimmer. You really don't want to pack in a lot of the shadow, or you'll end up looking like a discoball.|`|9y7xSEinaa	I have seen it in stores. The problem I have with Covergirl is that is not highly pigmented. High pigments are essential to eyeshadow as they deposit lots of color and not a lot of product. Companies tend to add shimmer to make the eyeshadow less costly to produce; when you apply it, you end up having slick, greasy shiny eyelids-- not attractive. Or worse, since you need to apply *a lot* of product to get the effect, you end up looking like a clown and the eyeshadow cakes or looks fake. <br>  This is why I like L'oreal HIP eyeshadows, or NYX (both are drugstore bought and very inexpensive) and some department store brands like L'ancome Color Fever and MAC. Not all dept store brands are high pigmented- Clinique is very weak. <br>  Hope this helps!
QCkRRqVwaa	Not any worse than any other tattoo.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	the font doesn't have anything to do with it.  it will depend on how big it is and where it is.  generally, the bonier the area, the more it will hurt -- like your ankle.  the 'fattier' the area, the less it hurts.|`|kCdISEGqaa	Just a word of caution, script tattoos don't look good forever.  Even with the advances in ink and machines, tattoos fade and age with the body.  Script tattoos, unless they are extremely large, will look like scribbles over time.  All tattoos hurt, it is the process not the design that causes the pain.  Just some things to think about.  Best wishes.<br>  <br>  And you're not any more likely to get cancer from tattoo ink than you are from drinking too much Kool-Aid.  That's just stupid.|`|c0be28b3edea48ead1b1905ccac2f3b6aa	It'll hurt more when you find out how much its gonna cost to remove...|`|gu0AxKyiaa	only hurt as bad as you let it hurt|`|JwnHKTabaa	It'll feel like any other tattoo.|`|ShdV8jm4aa	I really depends on your tolerance for pain and how well the tattoo artist is. The side is a tender area, yes, but the intensity of the pain is really all in a persons mind. <br>  The size of the tattoo only matters because if you have a large tattoo that requires a lot of tracing and filling, it may take more time and in turn cause the person more discomfort. <br>  In your case I wouldn't worry about it, you have a very small tattoo, depending on shading I don't think you will have much discomfort.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|lXMq4cGfaa	Like everyone is saying they hurt regardless, But from my personal experience the more bones they go over the worst it hurts, in fatty areas it dosent hurt to bad but in boney areas it hurts much much more. You say its going on  your side? Like ribs? Might not tickle to much, but hang in there, a good artist should be able to work fast. It will  feel like a razor blade carving in your skin, hurts bad at first but then you just kinda start getting use to it.<br>  <br>  Have Fun,<br>  <br>  Dann|`|f2Ld1gR6aa	lol stephanie we all know how big you are on tokio hotel :)<br>  <br>  but i promise if its going to be bill, tom, gustav and georg name on you plus a few lyrics i am going to get you:) lol haha<br>  <br>  it might not hurt considering the fact, i got my name on my ankle..<br>  <br>  some cursive parts may hurt, a little but other wise you should be fine :)|`|nNMEFXu8aa	Feels the same, letters are usually faster.,|`|2MvdB6SJaa	its gonna feel the same as if you got a tat of shark.  it doesnt matter wut it looks like|`|DYuJ28teaa	im not going to tell u it fells good, but it will take 15 min. and it will look awesome forever
bYOiCbTOaa	diet and exercise crunches alone do not eliminate stomach fat. Try to mix in cardio weight training and diet to get abs like that|`|zprAkP3eaa	Maybe sit-ups and crunches?|`|v1tHjJ3haa	prob 300-500 sit ups a day -well crunches :D|`|tAcWksQYaa	Drinks lots of water and eat healty for one. No matter how much exersize you get if you don't eat the right foods it's pointless. Do Crunches, sit ups, leg lifts...<br>  <br>  Leg lifts are when your laying on thr ground in sit up position (arms behind head) but instead of having your legs bent, straiten them. Then lift them off the ground a couple inches, hold, and keep going up.. Then do the same thing but going down.. This really works! and always remember to keep your abs tucked!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <3|`|cLATPkjkaa	er...haha....my abs look like that and I'm a guy xD<br>  <br>  Do 50 short crunches a day. Not full sit ups. Make sure they're really short, and do them rapidly. By the end you should feel an intense burning right in the two inches under where your sternum (your main chest bone in the middle) ends.|`|I5ccK5Qfaa	sit ups and lemon squeezers.<br>  I have better abs then that :)
H2mA3PVHaa	Of course you can! It's really up to you to decide how comfortable you would be in doing so. I'm a D-cup (still pretty firm, thankyouverymuch!) and I go braless all the time.|`|msNXomjTaa	A bra helps slow down the drag that gravity does, especially in woman with DD's.  There are tops that provide some support (like tube tops), but there are also bras that work with some - like the ones with only a strap at the back.  There are also little cup things you can get that go under each breast, and have no straps at all. I have no idea how well they work (I'm a guy, after all!), but I have seen them for sale.  Might be worth a try.<br>  <br>  The questions will be regarding comfort - does it feel okay to be braless?  And, also, how much sagging will happen over time if you are not supported.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	I hope your kidding..If not: ew..Do you know how trashy that is?|`|dvQh4csDaa	well, tbh with you. going braless isnt the most flattering thing! What tops do you mean because they could just be wearing a strapless bra? 36DD is quite a large size so i think your best to stay in your bra!|`|TTt51jutaa	That's on you if you want to have your business dragging to the ground.|`|AA10928214	hah, that depends on if you want them to be down to you're darn knees the next week.|`|484c8e17aef71579d986937035d2ba24aa	if u can get a shirt to keep them in place then yes by all means go bra less|`|Z5jt9mkKaa	well i have a specialty in inspecting breasts so i would have to see them b4 i could give u a straight answer.|`|WwELeJMTaa	go bra less. just make sure its a white c threw shirt
MehqmwZXaa	I had the exact same problem last year. I didn't do anything and it eventually faded to the color I wanted, so I don't think you should get highlights. I think that in two weeks or so you'll notice the difference.<br>  <br>  You may even end up liking you black hair =P (that happened to me, at least)|`|7Vgpz1Zlaa	In a few washes it will fade. Dont do blonde highlights... you will look like a skunk.|`|Pi7WVJEfaa	If you put highlights in your hair it will just make the rest of your hair with out highlights look even darker lol and make you look like a zombie or a skunk. Wash your hair a lot,  so the hair dye will fade away easier and you can then get a lighter hair look.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|J6SWB7r3aa	just keep washing it.. the dye will kinda come off a lil bit.. some certain brands actually remove quite a lot of dark brown dye that I used once..|`|B7mzzhZ5aa	mines was like that too but it faded dark brown! dont get blonde it will contrast and look tacky...get out in the sun for some natural highlights|`|5uAaJfaaaa	i dyed my hair dark brown couple of months ago and  it looked black but after a few weeks it looks dark brown so dont worry|`|BpEWyTKPaa	The color pigments are still fresh. As you go through your daily basis routine: like sports, showers...etc, you will find that it will fade in to the original color you got.|`|IowG78BGaa	yes, sun works well, or a brand called "sun in". spray in your hair and go out in the sun! =D
uzfdgFSxaa	My dad got tattoos at 15 and regrets it now at 72.  He feels foolish and you might too.  They don't look nice with age.  The color fades and the skin stretches.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	yeah, just to comment on what others are saying about regrets: i got one a few yrs ago, i'm over 40, it's band autographs on my shoulder.  i don't exactly regret it, but i do wonder how i'll feel the older i get.  i saw an older saggy, wrinkly woman with a flower on her shoulder in the store and i thought 'oh god ewww. ick.  oh man i hope i don't look that ridiculous with this one when i get old.'  not trying to talk you out of it, just saying...  if you want it, go for it.<br>  <br>  <br>  as far as your question, it's impossible to tell what your body'd going to do, just like i might not turn out all wrinkly like that lady i saw.  my thought is 'go for it'.  you're only young once, other people do it, it's your body, etc.|`|1oj4aamaaa	Consider this:  It'll look like hell when you're 60.|`|6LJzt2ngaa	youre 16? i would definitely re think this. you sound kinda cocky. which would explain why you want your own initials on your chest. but think of this, what would that tattoo mean to you??? sounds kinda selfish. what if you gained weight and not muscle? haha. what then? youre going to grow. youre only 16. got a few more years of growing. i would just wait until its actually legal to get one. theres a reason the age is 18. so stupid teenagers dont get idiotic tattoos that even the artist wouldnt want to show, or be proud to say they did it. guarantee most of em would tell you to leave their shop if you came in with that idea.|`|c06dc4d1e227f35f0b67179987536394aa	Wait until you're at least 18, first of all.<br>  <br>  Second: You get what you pay for.  I don't know how many people scoff at the rates of the top-end shops, then go to some local guy "'cause he's cheap", then whine about crappy work, and disease.  It's your body, get the BEST.<br>  <br>  Think about what you're getting.  No, really THINK about it.  Take your time, don't be rushed, and don't be pressured.|`|AA12380457	Id say get a fake one n then see if you like it ,I thought I wanted 1 to when I was 19 n now i hate it
7Vgpz1Zlaa	Revlon Colorist is the best one but you could also use Revlon Color Silk. Good luck.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	I'm really not sure about over the counter box color, but I just want you to be sure to use a dark golden brown. Stay away from anything that has ash in it, it could turn your highlights a greenish tone.|`|IowG78BGaa	easy. revlon. i always use it and its only 3-4 dollars a box =D
oVxr5B3Eaa	1. If you've gotten an inch, that's surprising. Unless you have a random growth spurt, it's almost impossible to grow your legs. Tons of people want to be taller... hate to say it, but there is no solution to that. <br>  There IS a surgery you can get, where they add a piece into your leg OR alternatively break your legs in several places, basically pull them a bit apart and wait for them to heal (new bone to fill the cracks and do it again) but it's a lengthy procedure, VERY painful, THOUSANDS of dollars, and about a 3 year recovery time MINIMUM before you can walk again followed by a lengthy rebah.. I'm actually not sure why ANYONE would want that just to add 3 inches to their height. People DO do it (i would see it as 3 years waste of my life), but it's usually done for medical reasons where people legs are different lengths (like, a lot different lengths. Like a few inches different). <br>  2. Your actual bones? Or just the meat on your bones? If it's just the fat... Lose it. If you mean the actual bones.. well. there isn't much you can do about that either. It's basically your body type that will define that. You COULD wrap them (like they do with feet.. you know, like a corset) but it's not going to get you far without a LOT of time and a LOT of pain. And besides.. Narrower will just equal thicker. <br>  3. Lift weights. Many models tone by basically following a "body builder" routine. <br>  4. Bio oil or cocoa butter, but don't expect to see results right away. It's going to take WEEKS, minimum about 6 weeks before you see ANY change and maybe 6 months before significant change. If your a model, you don't really have to worry about that anyways. They just look at facial structure and amount of body fat and they can airbrush and photoshop away the imperfections.|`|qvuQSQvpaa	stay up real late at nite. watch the 'paid programming'.  buy some of that sh*t (u got a whole lotta options). and youll be on your way 2 da top b4 u kno it|`|LX41AjMHaa	This is a wind up right?  <br>  <br>  Seriously if you have to do all of the above then its not meant to be. <br>  <br>  To lengthen your legs by 5 inches (which I'm pretty sure is impossible as it would knock the balancing of your entire body and you'd probably be falling over all the time) would cost thousands and thousands of pounds in extensive and very painfull surgery.<br>  <br>  To tone and shape, you need diet and excercise.<br>  <br>  You can't do anything about your ribcage, unless you count starvation as an excercise tool.<br>  <br>  Scars, well they fade with time.<br>  <br>  To be honest, why not become a designer or a makeup artist - that way you can be in the industry without having to destroy your and self esteem in the process.|`|dHkvVlONaa	1) Im not sure.  Sorry.<br>  <br>  2) You could do this thing where (and im not kidding) you take like a corset or string and tie it around your rib cage, getting tighter and tighter each day and do it for like a month, at the end of the month it should be really tight, then your rib cage is narrower but Im not sure if its permanent, but I also heard you can like crush your inside parts if you get it too tight.<br>  <br>  Theres also a thing where you can actually get some of your ribs surgically removed, it seems extreme but its actually no more extreme than like lipo or anything when you think about it.<br>  <br>  3) I guess just exercise alot and eat right.<br>  <br>  4) I heard Vitamin E oil helps and other than that im not sure.<br>  <br>  Sorry i could not be of more help,<br>  good luck being a model :)
8ROTGftqaa	For some people, it's an issue of shoving their beliefs onto others.  As far as being old and wrinkly, it's better to have old, wrinkly, decorated skin than nothing on it at all.  I do agree with you that people need to get tattoos that mean something to them and will be easily hidden in case they do get a professional job.  I've seen some stuff that wasn't thought out at all.  I have a friend whose boyfriend wants to get her name on him.  I'm trying to tell her that he should get something else because he does not know what the future holds.  My suggestion to him would be to get a symbol or picture that means something to him that also goes very deep.  My rule is that if you have not loved it all your life, you are not going to want it on you all your life.  I think that if you want a tattoo, you should go for it and ignore the skeptics.|`|yXGlmUqlaa	i agree with you.<br>  <br>  i want to get a few tattoos. i want them in places that are easily hidden if needed. and i've wanted them for at least year now. they mean something to me so i know i won't regret them|`|STs2ouqRaa	The way I figure it, by the time I'm old and wrinkly enough to regret it, they'll have a fast, easy, and painless way to remove them. Problem solved.<br>  <br>  So.. ink away!!|`|LPEWAoWCaa	Health reasons, have to make sure all the equipment is sanitary. I myself have a couple tattoos.|`|KrkftOfkaa	I agree with you on tasteful and meaningful tattoos that are strategically placed.  Then again I've seen some fugly and not discretely placed tattoos as well.  Some are just so "base stock" or "I want tribal armband #2" looking that it's annoying.|`|Hhifw93laa	I love tats the people that dont like them can just go to the other end of the world and relize that 90% of the world population is tated I also think its a form of expretion and who ever called it shi*** is just a ***** because they dont want to feel a litte bit of pain to put some ones art on there body if you dont like it dont fricken respond to the tattoos area du

nlOC41Qraa	Having had three in my nose at one point many moons ago, I found the best thing to do was to remove the original piercing stud and replace it with a small ring (gold or silver). You can then turn these through the hole and disinfect a lot easier than with a stud. It will clear up and heal all the way through reasonably quickly then.|`|qplKpji5aa	Your best bet would be to call your piercer. You might try to get a smaller stud because it may be catching on something while you sleep, and that could be causing the tenderness. You might also try cleaning it daily with alcohol and a q-tip. <br>  <br>  Your best bet would be to contact your piercer though.|`|484c8e17aef71579d986937035d2ba24aa	u could have a reaction to all gold try an Sterling silver stud instead

BpEWyTKPaa	Well obviously we all know that celebs can afford expensive products. I have a few solutions for you:<br>  ?use conditioner that can be used daily, before you blow your hair, use a nutrient spray to form a protective layer around your hair, so they won't get damaged.<br>  <br>  Here are some fantastic recipes that you can easily make at home. I have tried them before and they work fantastic! =)<br>  <a href="http://www.healthrecipes.com/hair_styles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthrecipes.com/hair_styles...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|hXJxHmafaa	CHI straitening system. The chemical process &/or the CHI flat iron. its gold plated so it NEVER burns your hair. it heats it from the inside to out. & also Biosilk by chi products its a silicone based heat protectant & smooths hair down (dime size is all you need)
kCdISEGqaa	From an artist's perspective, it's just not a nice tattoo.  Maybe you built yourself up and had different expectations, and it turned out like it did.  The lines are too thick, and the peace sign will look like a circle with a big chunk of black ink at the bottom.  The heart is not well done, it is crooked and not symmetrical.  I hate to be so negative, but, maybe if it looked better, it wouldn't be an issue.  <br>  <br>  Maybe you didn't know what to expect when you got it?  Maybe getting your first tattoo on your wrist was not a good idea.  I always talk to my clients who want highly visible tattoos and try to talk them into tattoos that can be easily hidden.  That way, if they don't like it, it's not in their face all the time. <br>  <br>  My recommendation, get some Wrecking Balm, www.wreckingbalm.com and use it to fade it once it's healed up.  I have friends who are using the balm to fade their tattoos so that they can get old mistakes covered with new tattoos.  If you fade it enough with the Wrecking Balm, the laser removal will cost less because it won't take as many sessions.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|d185f39553435f17970e180ddffe3d53aa	You probably regret your tattoo because you didn't think it through enough, you were probably too young to get one in the first place, and because it is really a bad design and very poorly done.  It is crooked and some of the lines are shaky.  Honestly it looks like a teen drew it on with a sharpie.  At least you can hide it with a watch or a bracelet.  Next time think about your tattoo for at least a year before you get it.  If you can live with your design for a year, then you should be ok to get it.  Second off, pick something that isn't so generic and doesn't look like a 5yr old could draw it.  Better luck next time.|`|ajeMVARraa	Well, you put it in a very visible place for a first tatt. I wasn't super excited about my first tatt just because it was irritating while it healed (on my hip, RIGHT at the top of my pants.). But I like it now. Maybe you'll learn to love it. :)|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	Maybe you are a little implulsive.  At least it is small and in a spot that isn't right out there.|`|rlXGRjAHaa	Well, I find that when people just go get a tattoo, because it's "cool" they regret it.. My friend, and I went and got tattoos, mine had meaning, and hers didn't. The ending result was that she regreting hers, because she didn't think about it long enough. Now, I didn't because mine was in memory of someone..  Usually that is why when you get a tattoo, people reccommend that you think about it for abut a year or atleast a while to make sure its something that you want, and won't regret it later down the road!|`|gu0AxKyiaa	haha sorry but its not the best tattoo i have ever seen, i have also seen worse you prolly dont like it cause you prolly didnt wanna get it in the 1st place or you were not really sure about getting it or it coulld be you didnt really think before you got it, just be thinkful its littl, you could of got a huge tattoo that would of sucked alot more then the one you have now so its all good|`|6LJzt2ngaa	because that tattoo means nothing. and you could basically never hide it. if it meant something to you, you wouldn't regret it. maybe later on, you could cover it with something meaning full.|`|yXGlmUqlaa	maybe you got it on an impulse?<br>  or it's not something that means something to you?<br>  i don't know.<br>  <br>  you might just have to get used to it|`|TDtSZLmvaa	i like it! it's cute.<br>  you probably don't like it cuz u didn't think about it enough first.<br>  and it's in a bad spot for some jobs but hey who cares, at least<br>  it is cute!|`|JwnHKTabaa	It kind of looks dumb.|`|VqEJk0eiaa	Well, it's not that cool, no offence...

XYT7jvBdaa	It seems like she is using gold and purple (the purple color also looks kind of brown so tell me if I am wrong)<br>  -First you'll need to apply a good base. There are tons on the market that you can use, including your own concealer. <br>  <br>  -Then apply the eyeshadow, working from the inner corner and out. Take the gold color and apply it to 1/2 of your eyelid with a firm eyeshadow brush (Sonia Kashuk makes great ones). Blend it upwards a bit if you've got more eyelid space. If you have a smaller space between your brow and lid, though, keep the color under the crease. <br>  <br>  -Take the purple color and pack it onto a fluffy dome-shaped brush (Sonia Kashuk also makes a great one of those). Apply it to the outer 1/2 of your eyelid, bringing it as high up as you did with the gold color. Using this brush, blend the colors together with a windshield wiper motion where the two colors meet. Apply more color if you have to.<br>  <br>  -Use a fluffy, big eyeshadow brush and apply a matte neutral highlight to your browbone, and blend out any harsh lines from your other eyeshadows.<br>  <br>  -The eyeliner can be done with either liquid or gel. I recommend gel, as it's easier to control. Use a bent eyeliner brush to apply a thick line of black gel eyeliner to the top lashline, and extend at an angle past the eye to create a flick. Make this as dramatic as you want. <br>  <br>  -Using either your gel eyeliner or a pencil, line your bottom lashline and waterline. <br>  <br>  -Apply mascara and done!<br>  I hope I was of some help.|`|xO2TIwsJaa	well it looks like she used a light gold color on the inner corner of her lid, then blended it out with a darker color, looks black or grayish to me. then it looks like she used liquid eyeliner on the top lid to create a cat eye look, and then used a eyeliner crayon on the bottom water line. also looks like she has mascara on.<br>  <br>  but the best way to make this make up look, look good on you is experiment with colors, because it will look different on you,because your skin probably isn't exactly like yours. So trial and error. But good luck with it!|`|UZ97lztYaa	It looks like she has..<br>  gold eyeshadow on first then she put a kinda grey/black colour on the other half blend them in then she put liquid eyeliner on the top lids and she has eyeliner on the bottom as well(dont use liquid eyeliner for this - pencil will work better)|`|S61zbh8Yaa	alot of practise
2dya7YeKaa	Just go to the tattoo artist you plan on using to have them draw it up.  It is not any more expensive to have them do it.  Even if you did find someone else to draw it, the likelihood that the artist would redraw anything you brought in is pretty high.  A lot of the time when people design their own tattoos or have artistically inclined friends do it for them the material they bring in doesn't really translate to a tattoo and has to be reworked.  Either way your tattoo artist is going to end up doing the final drawing, you might as well have them do it right from the start.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Hhifw93laa	GO TO A TATOO PARLOR THEY WILL DRAW IT UP FOR A SMALL FEE|`|aZXnW6AUaa	local tatoo artist|`|Q3MoGtBJaa	I had the same problem for a long time.

Ot6EoFlpaa	Okay. I'm not going to try and convince you to think you're pretty. Because if I'm being completely honest, no one actually IS the textbook definition of pretty. Not in real life!<br>  <br>  The teen dramas you mentioned? They try and mold the on-screen characters to impossible standards of beauty. Their hair is never windswept, and their lips are permanently shiny with lip gloss. Because, surprise surprise, there's a team of makeup artists and hair stylists on hand. Not to mention the right lighting, camera angles, and re-takes of scenes, over and over again, just to make sure everyone looks completely cutesy and perfect. If the world really is ruled by looks, then the world is ruled by a lie. <br>  <br>  The media girly-world needs to wake up, because we don't live in perfect imaginary land. People have spots. People have body hair. They have eye bags, blotchy skin, crooked teeth, stretch marks, difficult hair, round stomachs. You know why we do? Because we're all HUMAN, and we need to learn to love it! It includes your mum and your sister by the way. You're only seeing them as pretty and perfect because your not looking at their normal, human flaws...you're placing the negative all on yourself, thats not right. Remember, if a guy only looks for what's on the outside on a girl, he's not going to be anyone's prince charming. Because we're not dolls in a plastic case, we have LIVES!<br>  <br>  So, you're not the media's fake idea of beauty. Big deal! At least you're real. Remember you've got great friends, a great family, happy memories, and a future to look forward too...things a bunch of plastic-looking photo shopped pictures will never have.|`|AA12261162	No,the world is ruled by faith.<br>  It is ruled by what's within.<br>  What's the secret.<br>  <br>  And being pretty is never everything.<br>  It's like money.You can't buy the happiness either way.<br>  <br>  If you want happiness,be grateful because you are beautiful.<br>  <br>  But if you want the world's fake shine,go ahead.<br>  But remember,this world,it is not forever.<br>  It has an end.|`|qog0Yd72aa	Hun, please don't feel this way. Everybody is pretty in their own special way. Trust me you will find that perfect guy one day that loves you for you. If you are still feeling you are ugly and don't fit in i advise you talk to your mom or a counciler i promise if you do, you will feel a whole lot better. just hold your head up high, and hang on in there. you will be fine.I bet you are pretty but just dont realize  it. do you know why you find your mom and sis pretty? Because they think they are pretty, and they have confidence. if you think you are pretty more people will believe you are pretty. sounds weird, but its true. I am so sorry you are going through this but you are not alone. many other girls feel this way. just talk to a trusted adult and you will work everything out. goodluck|`|AA10451072	Just remember, back when your sister and your mom were your age, they probably thought the same thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's a battle all teenage girls fight, them against their body.|`|bCQ12AcEaa	I bet your pretty . Think of the people who actually are ugly and are depressed because they think no one loves them not even family.  i went through a stage of stress because of feeling ugly now i couldn't care less because i have good friends <br>  who helped me when i was feeling low about it all the time|`|X7DDlR1caa	your sister might be pretty but i bet she knows it and i bet your a much better person than she is. I'm sure your not ugly.. Learn to respect yourself girl! Cause no one else will otherwise and besides i bet you've got a great personality!<br>  <br>  xx|`|7fh3JCVxaa	i doubt you are ugly. youre just comparing yourself to people.<br>  but pretty people do tend to get away with more, but there are also a lot of people who judge good looking people.<br>  and good looking people dont get approached as much.x|`|AA12279950	Have you seen a picture of Gordon Brown??
uVGOrLm3aa	it depends what colour you dyed it, if you go to the hairdressers they can put a stripper on it, but if it's black and you are wanting it to go lighter you run the risk of it going ginger! i really would go see your stylist though, to be on the safe side. :-)|`|JyAUAbsjaa	You are pretty much stuck with the color that you have for now. Color doesn't lift color. You can change the tone however. You'll have to stick with the same level but a different tone. If that doesn't do it for you, you should seek out a professional.|`|V8IRppHPaa	Id Leave It At Least A Week Because U No Theres Still Some Dye In Your Hair For A Few Washes Afterwards|`|031551eb799725ff135a73eee37b3162aa	Try Boots Botanics permanent hair dye. It's more natural and softer on your hair and you can dye over another hair dye. Just try and keep as close as you can to your current shade- slightly lighter or darker etc. It has a fab conditioner with it too.|`|OaZzv3zHaa	I'd probably leave it a few days first. I dont think it would be too bad as long as it wasn't a too drastic change in colour. Eg, black to blonde|`|edpKlRnhaa	I'm a hairdresser you should wait at least a week or your hair can become really dry and brittle..and you'll startt to get split ends and your hair will look dull and boring..|`|TbapRrYGaa	leave it for a few weeks..the hair colour contains amonia so your hair could fall out.....or get permanently damaged :(|`|n6tjVyAkaa	It depends on the color shade. if it is light try going darker, if it is dark try getting some bleach foils to lighten the effect and add more contrast. or you can lighten it with a mild bleach and then dye it a more better color. experts will always give their opinion, so try to go see one. color will not lift other color. only add on. in order to lift it need to strip the color out from the hair.|`|AA11110249	i think there's something you can buy at beauty shops/stores that will remove the colour dye from your hair. but you can also just re-dye it. it shouldnt ruin your hair are unless you're dying it constantly.|`|zyxJFuFAaa	Do it again...I've done that loads.
p3GZERIsaa	I would :]|`|kmAMgkiraa	No. I'm short as it is, so I look to wear heels. I like guys who are bigger than me. Sorry.

C0HZ8ZB4aa	Some itch worse than others. Some of mine have barely itched at all and others have itched like crazy for weeks on end. My lower back was the worst for itchiness, it was pure torture. Not sure what the reason is for some itching more than others, but it's totally normal. I would personally recommend you stay away from the petroleum jelly though. There are far better aftercare solutions than this and this will suffocate your tattoo. I use Bepanthan which is perfect. I hear others say that things like A&D, lubriderm, etc also work very well.|`|kCSJyM8Laa	I do not have a tattoo.  I am experienced with skin issues........I suggest that you inspect it or have someone you trust look at it closely.  If no signs of infection are there go to the drug store and buy some Ora-Gel  That is a topical anesthetic used for teething babies but it will kill the pain in your skin too....Watch carefully tho for signs of too much redness and little yellowish pimply things developing...then get to a doc.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  Pirate|`|d185f39553435f17970e180ddffe3d53aa	First off, STOP putting petroleum jelly on it.  It clogs your skin and doesnt allow the tattoo to breath.  Use a good A and D cream, non scented, or vaseline intensive care, but for god sakes stop putting petroleum jelly on it.  Itching is a normal part of the healing process and you just have to deal with it.  As long as its not red and oozing puss you should be ok in a week or so.|`|ajeMVARraa	I got a sunburn on my chest and it itched while it healed, so maybe its just how the skin in that area heals. It is a little different than say, the skin on your arm. More sensitive, I would imagine. Try unscented lotion instead of petroleum jelly since the jelly is more of a protect ant than a moisturizer.|`|2dya7YeKaa	Stop putting petroleum jelly on it for one thing.  That stuff is oil based and will only smother your tattoo.  Use unscented lotion or A&D Ointment.  <br>  <br>  Some tattoos itch more than others.  I have tattoos on my chest and I thought they were especially itchy.  The skin there is very soft and tender so that is probably part of it.|`|80Zlwifsaa	I was always told do not use petroleum jelly on my tattoos. I have always been told either A&D ointment, Lubriderm lotion or they sell stuff at tattoo shops like Tat Wax that are especially for tattoos.|`|uVGOrLm3aa	i had my half sleeve finished last monday and it's gotten a little itchy, it's just beacuse the skins dry, i wouldn't put petroleum jelly on a tattoo though, it completely blocks the skins ability to breathe, try something like e45 cream. hope that helps a little bit :-)|`|6LJzt2ngaa	it itches because that skin is more sensitive. i have one along my collar bones, and it itches pretty bad. haha. but im betting thats why. and btw, i heard to not put petroleum jelly on tattoos? ive been putting unscented lotion on mine. about 3 to 4 times a day. and its healing nicely.|`|br1FB5rraa	Try using curel ultra healing lotion instead of petrolium jelly. And when it itches, just slap it a few times. That's what I've done for all of mine|`|vd2ExGEraa	they probably used different ink or something, and your probably allergic to it|`|kqxddLNoaa	i've not long got a tattoo and it itches like a ***** sometimes. I use Bepanthan, baby bottom cream. that does the treat.<br>  <br>  =]<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|0jeWHxKmaa	just leave it alone..your doing the right thing!..My first tattoo did that.|`|AA11207031	try bepanthen instead its a nappy rash cream but works really well on tatts|`|nuc5DBD8aa	Try using nappy rash cream. :D
oVxr5B3Eaa	If it's rejecting, there is really nothing you can do to stop it. You can try switching to another material (usually titanium or gold) because it CAN be caused by allergies, but not always. <br>  Just because your seeing less skin inbetween doesn't mean it's growing out. When you first get it done, it's very traumatic to the area, and it swells. This swelling takes up the whole length of the bar. As it heals and calms down (after a few weeks.. like.. right about now), the swelling will decrease and you'll see a bit of the bar. If it's not red and oozing (other than lymph) and not painful, you really have nothing to worry about. If it's rejecting, the holes will be constantly irritated. <br>  <br>  But yeah, just because you see a little more skin doesn't mean anything other than the swelling has gone down because your body is getting used to it.. and it's healing more. Unelss it grows out ALOT, you have nothing to worry about, though most DO grow out a little over time. <br>  Bioplast is usually not a good idea unless it's a lip ring or somewhere you have to worry about your teeth or something. The BEST material is pure gold, followed by titanium if you don't have the cash. I worked out a lot too when I got mine and played tons of sports and I had no issues with it (other than it took forever to heal) but it didn't grow out. You can likely just leave your original one in if it's healing well. Only switch if it gets and stays irritated (remember it might get irritated if you hit it on something for a few days). Also, make sure to clean it when your done working out because the sweat sitting in your navel is not exactly healthy for it. <br>  Leave in the original as long as you can before you try to change it or take it out, even to clean it. They DO take up to a year, sometimes even more to heal, and because the ends are threaded, when you take it out it will rip the thin, weak skin on the inside of your navel and reverse healing. <br>  <br>  Good luck, it sounds fine for now.|`|zlXofrG4aa	I believe rejecting and migrating are the same thing.  Unless I have that wrong but I've never been told you can stop it from doing so.  I think the only thing you can do now is take it out, wait for it to heal, and then get it repierced.  Piercing through scar tissue is 5 times worse though.  Even then it could reject again.  I had a friend who had her belly button done, it migrated out, she got it repierced through the scar tissue and sure enough some months later it migrated out again.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	You can't stop either, migrating will stop on its own and if it's rejecting there's nothing you can do but take it out to minimize scarring. Rejection (from what my piercer has told me) is painful, your skin is literally dying so that the cells underneath can push out the jewelry, it will will red the whole length of the piercing and very very angry looking, it's pretty obvious when it happens. Go back to your piercer and have them look at it, but if it's not painful and isn't red then it's most likely not rejecting.
HCL7FpTqaa	mine does that from starring at Pimp Stains picture all day|`|2dya7YeKaa	If it is consistently the same spot maybe you should have a dermatologist take a look.

Also if you are a mouth breather, that will dry out  your lips too.(allergy-sufferer?) Drink plenty of water and try  Aquaphor Lip treatment...it is great. Or just use regular Aquaphor on your lips...day and night. It comes in a tube and in a jar and is sold in retail drugstores everywhere.
uVGOrLm3aa	it depends really on the person i think, i had mine in for about a year and took it out and you wouldn't even know i'd had it done, but i do have a teeny scar from when i had my lip pierced in the centre when i was 17. not much help i know lol :-)|`|4Nf8zhDXaa	I know what mean I have a really noticeable scar from my navel piercing also but the lip piercing is not even as close to noticeable I've had my lip done twice the first time no scar at all but the second time it left like a little dot kind of looks like a small bump not noticeable unless you're really close if it's something you really want go for it I'm sure you'll like it I loved my lip piercing!|`|6LJzt2ngaa	well this one girl in my school pierced hers herself...hahaha stupid. but it scared pretty bad. but im thinking that if you keep a monroe in long enough it wont ever close or scar. and if it does, its like the size of an ear piercing and im sure a little make up would cover it if you wanted. why would you get thepiercingg if you planned on taking it out??|`|kqxddLNoaa	i don't think they scar much, it most probable look like a freckle or something. there is a cream that slowly gets rid of scars which is sold is superdrug or boots|`|HEsvJMKVaa	ive pierced my lip twice && theres no scar...|`|Hhifw93laa	no i dont hardly have a scar it has a little knot in it but thats it you can't really tell that I had 1|`|CvEERKQuaa	hmmwell..not so much a scar ,(not how id describe it) if ur talking about a noticable hole...uh yeh lol very noticable i have 2 lip peircings and taking them out for work experience, i  had the children in then nursery pointing out the holes lol and i had retainers in as well lmao (they were clear)<br>  <br>  if u want one go for it.x|`|kGpgpgKeaa	I have had about 12 lip piercings, including a monroe, and all of them have left different degrees of scarring, depending on how long I had each piercing in for. I had my monroe in for about 3 or 4 years, and there is a definite dent in the skin, not as noticable as the scars on my bottom lip, but still very obvious its there. People are always asking why I have all these scars on my face, so they must be pretty obvious. If you are worried about it scarring, I wouldn't have it done.|`|q8IwKTfFaa	It depends. If you decide to take your monroe piercing out for personal reasons not healing reasons, then there shouldnt even be a scar. But I'm guessing your navel rejected and left a scar so those are two different things|`|KAYFdLfNaa	i had my lip pierced too many times to count and i dont have a scar atall. go for it!|`|Wfg60DNwaa	i didnt even know navel piercings scarred!<br>  ohh.. i wish i didnt get mine done now :|<br>  <br>  btw, my sister took her monroe out and she has like a dip where the hole was

xsaxyB1gaa	I've had my tongue pierced twice. Although I've never had my belly button pierced, I can tell you that getting your tongue pierced doesn't hurt much at all. All you really feel once they put the clamp on is pressure, and before you know it it's all over and done with. You will have some initial swelling which will go down in about 2-3 days. During this time it will be a little difficult to form some words. You will also have a little bit of trouble eating during this time because it's all still strange trying to work your food around a piercing. Eventually it will all come naturally.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the new piercing!|`|dHkvVlONaa	Tongue deff hurts less, although none of them hurt that bad anyway.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|YYSfBZfoaa	Im a guy and ive never done either but all three of my sises have done them both and they say that it hurts the same but getting you tongue pierced hurts a little longer|`|BAPj9JW3aa	tongue hurts less...although the swelling afterwards is a bit worse than initially piercing both tongue and belly button.<br>  <br>  please do your research before deciding to do either..but especially tongue.<br>  <br>  there are lots of risks and not being able to eat anything but chicken broth and ice chips the first couple of days really sucks :/<br>  <br>  it WILL get better though after a week or two...so if you really want to get it done i say go for it :)|`|CugCzH9iaa	NO!!!

Then by aug. you will have all healthy hair!!!<br>  <br>  It will blend some if you leave it.  Especially if you straighten it or curl your ends to help flatten them.

It's short in the back and longer in the front. The look is in and will get rid of the dead hair. It looks really cute and is low maintenance.
ne2sEeLJaa	Hey instead of using foundation, why don't you try tinted moisturisers instead,as they give you colour, even out skin tone and moisturise at the same time. I use to use foundation and that used to always give me loads of spots and clog my skin up, so I've discovered that using a tinted moisturiser is better for my skin and I hardly ever get spots now.<br>  <br>  With the tinted moisturisers, don't buy the really cheap ones, because they are just crap and too thick. I use that one that is on this T.V advert. It starts out colourless and blends nicely.<br>  <br>  And with cleansing, I use this Heated cleansing facial scrub, by Clean and Clear. I don't know why but its really good stuff.<br>  And I use cleansing wipes too. The ones by Olay in the bright blue packet, them ones are really good.|`|20yqahaRaa	hmm too much / or being very clean sometimes is the reason why bacteria or the germs loves you... so sometimes its better to get dirty and ignore it but clean yourself after the day activities.<br>  <br>  and about the foundation, it depends on the person.. some people get their skin irritated but others not and this can be a reason for acne and pimples... some of my friends (male) use foundation too... but i dont since it irritates my skin..|`|gKuHTs1Caa	this is a tough one, you don't want to aggravate your skin by any means. you will not look like an old lady,if you pamper your skin,regardless of its condition. drink lots of water & moist., don't sleep w/ your mkup. your skin needs to breathe. using the right foundation & powder is also key. stick foundation will give buildable coverage (mac,clinique,estee lauder). use your fingers to apply,then set with a nice loose powder. liquid foundation (a lot of it), tends to streak if not applied correctly.using the thinnest layer of good quality mkup will help w/ the dryness. hope this helps.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Too much make-up will be the death of your skin!

Simple do a good range and Liz Earle cleanse and polish is great.  <br>  Use a moisturiser and then use a foundation that also moisturises your skin.  Once the dry skin is under control, try a mineral powder foundation, you don't need a lot and it is less likely to clog your skin.  I am currently using a L'Oreal product which gives really nice results.  It's not drying, it's not orange and as it warms on your skin gives a really nice, natural 'glow'. It's also very reasonably priced because it seems to go on forever! <br>  You may find the products more expensive but it will be worth a bit more to get a better result.|`|VjDNLUIRaa	well, first off, foundation actually makes acne worse, because it gathers bacteria and is not letting the skin breathe.<br>  <a href="http://www.ciao.co.uk/The_Body_Shop_Tea_Tree_Oil_Cover_Stick__68885" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciao.co.uk/The_Body_Shop_Tea_...</a><br>  use something like that, it will cover up where you want hiding, and will actually do your skin good.<br>  i have always used tea tree and I have never had acne, just one or two spots when I'm due my period!!

2dya7YeKaa	You already have a bunch of answers that say this but no.  If you do it properly they won't bleed.  Mostly it is a matter of taking the time to let your ears heal.  Here is a general timeline for stretching:<br>  <br>  Fresh piercing to first stretch: Approx 5 to 6 months<br>  16g to 14g - 1 month<br>  14g to 12g - 1 month<br>  12g to 10g - 1.5 months<br>  10g to 8g - 2 months<br>  8g to 6g - 3 months<br>  6g to 4g - 3 month<br>  4g to 2g - 3 months<br>  2g to 0g - 4 months<br>  0g to 00g - 4 months<br>  <br>  But apart from the time you should wait there is also the question of taking good care of your ears once you start stretching them.  The best way to get your lobes healthy and loose and soft is by doing oil or lotion massages, preferably on a daily basis.  You can use pure emu oil or vitamin e oil or get a nice, unscented lotion.  Massage it into your lobes once a day (make sure it all soaks in - you don't want to leave oil or lotion just sitting on your skin, that won't really help you much, it will just make your ears an oily mess).  Once you get to larger gauges you might consider sleeping with your jewelry out one night a week.  It sounds scary at first but if your lobes are nice and healthy and stretchy it shouldn't be a problem to get your jewelry back in the next morning.  Sleeping with your lobes "naked" once in a while will help improve circulation and promote healthy tissue growth.<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that properly inserting and removing jewelry is important.  When you are inserting or removing jewelry make sure you lube it up with lotion or oil first, otherwise your skin can snag on the jewelry and you'll end up with microtears.  I don't know if you are familiar with the term blowout (google search piercing blowout to see what I mean) but at larger gauges you can get blowouts not just from stretching improperly but by inserting and removing jewelry incorrectly on a day-to-day basis.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	They shouldn't. If they bleed, you've done them wrong. Because if they bleed, it means you tore the hole, which means you ruined the elasticity in your ear. <br>  <br>  Make sure your waiting at least a month between sizes, use lots of lubrication, don't skip sizes. That means to get from an 18 to a 14 it should have taken about 2 months. It shouldn't even hurt (other than a little throb MAYBE) if your doing it correctly. For lubrication, use plain unscented hand lotion. NEVER use vaseline, and avoid actual lube (like ky). <br>  Make sure to keep cleaning them as you go up, and if you've done it properly (no bleeding), you should be able to go to a 0 or a 2 and have it shrink down. If it bleeds and you want it to shrink, Dont go past a 4. <br>  <br>  And besides, even if you DID tear it.. it wouldn't even be enough blood to make a drop. It would be like a spec on a tissue.|`|iJZ5Efb0aa	nah they don't bleed if you go bigger unless you tear your ear.<br>  skipping gauges especially would cause your ear to tear.<br>  if you don't skip gauges (which is how you're originally supposed to stretch your ears), then you won't have a problem with blood.<br>  :)|`|BAPj9JW3aa	if you stretch them properly(wait for your ears to FULLY heal in between every stretch)...than no...your ears shouldn't bleed.<br>  you'll form crusties and clear/yellowish fluid will come out of the holes though...this is normal so don't be alarmed.|`|drHzNxhxaa	Gauges are not supposed to bleed as you increase in size.  The only way they would is if you are not increasing by size properly.  As long as you make sure you let your ears heal properly as you progress from one size to another they will not bleed.  If they do bleed it is a sign you are not letting your ears heal properly as you change sizes or a sign of a infection.  As long as you play it safe i don't see why there would be any problem for you to gauge you ears without them bleeding!<br>  Good Luck :D|`|SIUKasInaa	nope. they shouldnt bleed.<br>  be patient in your stretching, <br>  allow proper healing time between each step,<br>  you can also use those gradual gauge spike things,<br>  to stretch slower at a longer rate if you dont want to pop<br>  a whole step in at a time...<br>  consult your local professional piercer for any blood on any<br>  body modification... they shouldn't really ever bleed post<br>  your initial piercing...|`|q8IwKTfFaa	When Stretching your ears, it should never bleed. Bleeding can be caused by stretching too fast before your ears have healed. BME and Big Lobe ****** Bible tells you how to effectively stretch your ears.|`|kqxddLNoaa	they are only suppose to bleed if you stretch it to much like if you went from a 10 to like a 14 or 16. Mine bleed but i had a blister in mine for some reason. So stretch it. They're cool|`|nuc5DBD8aa	If you do it right, it won't bleed. :)|`|dHkvVlONaa	Im up to 8 gauge right now, and they never bled once.  I know people up to 00 gauge and it didnt bleed at all, only if you stretch too fast or rip the skin.<br>  <br>  You should be fine, and if your worried about it go to a piercer and have them do it for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Bleeding is a sign of tearing which for the most part is a sign of improper stretching. As was said, give them plenty of time to heal, 4-6 weeks between each stretch and do not force them, if you can't get the taper in you can't get it in, give your ear a couple more weeks to heal and try again. You can also try the tape method, it's a little more gradual so the chances for tearing and bleeding are less. Pretty much get some bondage or PTFE tape and wrap a layer or two onto a plug every week or two, this will slowly stretch your each so that it's not as drastic as going up a full size at a time.
v1uNUcwCaa	after you straighten your hair use a serum u only need a very small ammount and it works wonders (never use a serum b4 you straighten your hair as its like an oil and you will frazzle your hair, believe me ive been there!)<br>  <br>  you could also try to straighten your hair in smaller sections it may take a while longer but i have a friend with frizzy hair and it works better for her if she does it that way.<br>  <br>  maybe you need thick plated GHDs then tend to work better on thicker curlier hair<br>  <br>  a little bit of hairspray can help as well<br>  <br>  also big curls are very in this spring and summer so maybe you could go natural and make all us people with naturally straight hair jealous!|`|CugCzH9iaa	Blow dry it with a ionic blow dryer brush it straight with a boar bristle brush and do sections at a time!!  Then straighten with a good balm and a great straightener.  Some days are just pointless to even try!!! On humid days try a cute style with your curly hair!|`|7ntSRsZLaa	I have the exact same problem.<br>  If you have naturally curly or kind of curly or wavy hair, any moisture in the air, any water vapor.. rain..anything like that will poof it out and make it curly..again.<br>  <br>  What I do when I go outside in the winter is wear a hoodie at all times til I'm indoors because it keeps some of the wind and moisture away..<br>  Just deep condition it, only shampoo twice a week..<br>  Try to straighten as little as possible and it will be more manageable.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped?:)|`|xsaxyB1gaa	You sound a lot like my sister. Her hair has the exact same problem, but she has found a couple ways to deal with it. She uses a "sleek and shine" shampoo which is made by Fructis (I'm not sure if they sell it in the UK) and this helps with the initial frizz. I know some anti-frizz shampoos will make your hair greasy, but she's been very happy with this particular brand and has used it for quite some time now. She also uses John Freda's Anti-Frizz Serum. All you do is apply a VERY small dot of this stuff to your hands, rub them together, and work it through your damp hair. Then blow dry straight, and then take a flat iron to your hair. There are still times when humidity is high that she just has to give in to mother nature, but there are products out there that will help if you're willing to experiment. <br>  <br>  It's also great you're using a heat blocker. Especially if  you have curly or frizzy hair, it will keep your hair from unnecessary and "unnatural" frizz caused by split ends and such. Hope that helps!|`|lMV9oANDaa	hey[:<br>  <br>  i had THE EXACT SAME problem last week.<br>  <br>  i even tried a 90$ striaghtener, didn't work.<br>  <br>  you just need a hydration shampoo/conditionerr.<br>  when you straighten, take smaller pieces at once... go REAALLY slow.<br>  <br>  but don't stip the heat protection treatment. it reaallly helps. after you straighten your haiiirrr,<br>  put in an extra hold + shine hairspray in<br>  <br>  <br>  itll work wonders(:<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this heeelpppps.|`|n6tjVyAkaa	Its the amount of protien that your hair carries, also for the weight and volume. usually humidity has a toll. i assume you straighten it with heat. there is only so much your hair can take. have you tried permanent straightening? its a bit costly. talk to a professional at a salon.|`|bRcwqYhiaa	try using a conditioner that tames ur hair  and use a straightning serum to apply all over ur hair before you use the ghd, also section ur hair with sectioning clips when straigtning, so u can do bit by bit and finish of with bit of hairspray all over... hope that helps x|`|Wfg60DNwaa	oh my god i have the same problem!!<br>  i use a GHD too and i have curly hair :)<br>  what i do is i curl the ends slightly inward and hairspray, and then when im outside the ends turn straight. dont ask me how, but it works for me.|`|edpKlRnhaa	my hair is naturally quite curly too. I have the same problem..If you straighten it and then use a little bit of hairspray not too much though it usually keeps it flat and straight. Hope this helps..|`|1QURArm3aa	I use silk drops on mine and it dont go puffy.I have really curly hair also.|`|47d9854e65fb0cad294bec0cbb5ca642aa	Get a good flat iron spray.  Use it prior to straightening your hair.  Also, if you live in a humid climate, you will have this problem no matter what you do.  I also have curly hair.  I also found that if I straighten my hair the night before, it seems to flatten out quite a bit by morning and then I just run the round brush and blow dryer over it to get any sleep lumps that might have formed.<br>  <br>  Also, DON'T GET YOUR HAIR PERMANENTLY STRAIGHTENED!!!!!!!!  I did this once and it was worse than having curly hair.  Your hair literally doesn't do anything whatsoever. Like having straw for hair.  Won't style or do anything other than lay there.  Plus once it grows out a bit, your roots will be curly and the rest still straight.|`|IUlA00jvaa	Hey well theres a few things that cud be wrong here. Alot of people have this misconseption that if you run the straightener over your hair once it will be immaculately straight lol my friend was moaning that her straighteners wernt working so i tried them out on her and she goes "you already did that bit twice!!" lol but dnt over do it =] also it could be your straighteners...i used my Vidal Sasoon wuns until i accidently stepped on them lol ... There are plenty of hair srays that provide a cover against moisture and humidity so just shop around for some. Also Straightening shampoos and conditioners DO NOT WORK...well at least the like 8 brands i have tried to be honest they just made my hair really dry brittle and fuzzy. Maybe you could consider asking you hairdrsser if he knows of a straightening shampoo and cond that works? or you could get it chemically straightened...if you dnt have the money maybe ask to have it dun for your birthday or something? Goodluck xxx|`|hAAvcGzCaa	Well its probably a crappy straightener.<br>  buy a CHI :]<br>  their great.<br>  <br>  and get style straight shampoos.<br>  john frieda makes a good one.|`|BpEWyTKPaa	Well, your hair is naturally curly, and there's nothing that can be done about it. No matter how many times you straighten it, it will still go back curly. Maybe you can rebond  and straighten it. That will last a while. Trust me, 2 of my friends have the same problem. One is like a head of springs while one is a bush. They both use the same method and it works just like magic. Beware, after 6 months or more they will start to curl again.|`|zhk8o514aa	Go to a pro and get it straighten chemically. ( Its like a perm but opposite )|`|7Vgpz1Zlaa	My hair is the same way. When you wash it try to use the smallest amt of conditioner possible. To much moisture will make it puffy. Blow dry all of your hair until it is completely dry. Use a regular iron (not a flat iron) you know the ones for clothes. Iron your hair sections at a time. (flat irons do not produce enough heat to keep your hair flat outside with all the humidity) Afer you have ironed all of your hair use any anti frizz serum (lightly) at your roots. Then blow dry from roots to the end of your hair quickly. This works great.... unless it rains! lol Good Luck!

38a4948f2f41ba637bdbe7a7ceb52e64aa	I can't really tell you what kind of slip you will need, but I can make a few suggestions to help with the shopping. I would recommend going to a good lingerie shop or a department store with a knowledgeable staff in their lingerie department. Tell them what you are shopping for and describe the dress. If at all possible take your dress with you to try the slips on underneath. Try on a few slips and see what's comfortable and fits. Then buy at least three different styles to try under the dress when you get home. Many times the slip neckline won't work with your neckline on the dress. Keep your receipts so you can return the slips you won't be using. It's not the same as underwear so you should not have a problem returning them, unless the store has a strict "no returns" policy.
VjDNLUIRaa	hmmmmm....<br>  i dont think wacky hair colour would suit you...<br>  your face looks great with the colour you have, it really sets off your eyes!!!!<br>  personally i don't like coloured extensions or extensions, well not the ones you can pick up for a fiver.<br>  they look so fake and you can always tell.<br>  Why not get some toffee highlights and let i grow?|`|SDnhUMv9aa	I wish I could dye my hair!

MehqmwZXaa	You should get face-framing layers around at abut chin level. That way, not only will your bangs blend in more beautifully with the rest of your hair, but you'll be able to put your hair up and leave those layers hanging around your face for a softer look. <br>  You could also get side or choppy bangs, depending on your face-shape. <br>  I don't know if that's what you want but I hope this helps. <br>  <br>  Check out this website, it has a great gallery of hairstyles (in this case, long and wavy):<br>  <a href="http://www.thehairstyler.com/celebrity_long_wavy_hairstyles_20.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.thehairstyler.com/celebrity_l...</a>|`|DpBgY3yuaa	yehh get loads of layers put in, like short ones,<br>  my sister has a full frindge+long wavy hair<br>  and all her layers (also shaped around her face like you said)<br>  look really good tied up!<br>  :)|`|n6tjVyAkaa	Im quessing your hair is like this<br>  <a href="http://ny-image0.etsy.com/il_430xN.26274484.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://ny-image0.etsy.com/il_430xN.26274...</a><br>  What would be nice would be this<br>  <a href="http://www.celebrity-hair-styles-magazine.com/images/long-hair-style-teen-07.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.celebrity-hair-styles-magazin...</a><br>  You could try straightening it.. with a bit more layers|`|47d9854e65fb0cad294bec0cbb5ca642aa	I really didn't understand anything you said.

JyAUAbsjaa	Yes the side bangs will be obvious, and they look really cute with a ponytail. There are many ways to style them to look good. When you go to the salon have your stylist show you. Most of the time you can just use a flat iron to put them where you want.|`|n6tjVyAkaa	It all depends on your hair thickness, and your face structures. there are different face structures that look good with hair styles. others are hideous.<br>  Also with side bangs, they should be tapered. Verry Very Important<br>  If you dont want layers, thats a tough one. normally you have to have a special face frame for this to actually look good. and if your hair is extremely thin, it should look good.<br>  but layers close together at the bottom would be your best bet. please show picture of you, and  another of your desired look.

5dDNqwlzaa	If you're interested in becoming a model and don't have a ton of money you're going to want to do TF* shoots.  That means "Time for"-*CD, Disk, Prints* (your time for the pictures, everything is free).  Look into some art college students and ask around.  Students always are in need of different models to practice their photography, they are always TF*.  Search for local photographers in your area, they'll usually do TF* or for a very small fee. Start building a portfolio with that!<br>  <br>  I would also look into Local Agencies first!  Don't just run and send your pictures to big companies because chances are, you won't hear anything back.  You need experience, and starting out small and local, will only help you.  It will also help you decide whether being a model is right for you and if you're something the industry wants.<br>  <br>  Those are some points to start at, Good Luck!|`|Jaaasoolaa	i wanna become a model too but no one knows
MehqmwZXaa	If your current shampoo does not contain sulfates, it can't remove silicones from you hair. So you may have build-up from previous products, which is probably causing the damaged look on your hair. <br>  <br>  I suggest that you wash your hair once with a clarifying shampoo and try again with the organic shampoo. Also, don't use any product on your hair that has ingredients ending with -cone or -xane in it, because your organic shampoo can't remove them and you'll get build-up again. <br>  <br>  I don't know about the coconut oil, but I think it can't damage your hair because it's natural. <br>  <br>  Check out this website. Even if you're not a curly girl, it may help you find out more about organic products and hair care. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/</a><br>  <br>  Hope I've helped!!|`|hAAvcGzCaa	i hated those products.<br>  <br>  and yeah don't leave stuff in your hair for that long.|`|Vp5nuKBSaa	cocunt oil is the best<br>  u can see thos indian woman hair which kill me heheh<br>  shiny and healthy<br>  they alwyes use it<br>  u can use this oil by on of thos way<br>  as befor having shower apply till root and all ur hair<br>  then cover it with plastic bag so it will get hot<br>  for 2-4 hours maximum<br>  then after showe and condition<br>  when ur hair is damp<br>  applay it again as leave in oil<br>  but u either<br>  applay it superficaily i mean u do not have to rab it till root like when u do it befor having shower<br>  <br>  or there another on indain woman she told me<br>  <br>  after u have shower dry ur hair with towel<br>  then applay the cocunt oil compltety till the root then tie it like whatever u wanna keep it till the next day then have shower<br>  she said this the way they use it one a week<br>  <br>  but u know i found out somthing oils better than creams<br>  try whenver ur hair look dry and puffy<br>  applay an oil lil bit so ur hair will look shiny<br>  and i use trick if the oil is kinda smeely i put some hair prefum<br>  lolz<br>  <br>  and try not to dry it too much with blow dryer or strightener<br>  coz it keep it weak|`|zN3C2NDzaa	Sounds like your organic products are leaving your hair in a condition! Which if you bought them off the drugstore shelf, that is all they are required to do by law. Get to a salon and ask the lady for redkin all soft shampoo and all soft heavy conditioner. Then ask the kind lady for a deep conditioning treatment that includes both protein and moisture. Get a trim and treat that hair like spun sugar. It will take about 3 or 4 weeks before your hair starts feeling like hair again, as opposed to low grade nylon. Keep in mind professional product are required to meet certain industry standards before they can be sold this is not so for drug store products, the only guideline for conditioners is that said product must leave hair in a condition. This means, in reality, that they can put battery acid in a bottle and sell it to you because it leaves the hair in a condition. The guideline says nothing about the kind of condition you get stuck with.<br>  <br>  It is also possible that the product you used is not compatible with your body chemistry. You may be allergic to some of the ingredients in the products you have chosen. So go to the salon and follow my directions and good luck|`|cAvGIkjaaa	the Organix products are awesome!!! they ahve organic active ingredients and are good for your hair! <br>  <br>  It's probably because of that bad serum you are using.|`|rHKW1CJJaa	you fool organix isnt really organic shampoo, its just jumping on the bandwagon. learn your ingrediants and what to avoid (parabens and as many synthetic chemicals as you can) thats what is killing your hair.|`|ocwetmQuaa	Quit washing your hair everyday.<br>  You are stripping all the natural oils out.<br>  Hair will only absorb the amounts it needs and the longer you leave it in doesn't matter.<br>  You'll get the same results from a 15 minute treatment that you would for a three day treatment.
r1fJB6QJaa	it will depend on the dye, if you are doing it in a salon then you can ask the hairdresser, but if you are doing it at home, from a packet, then they give you a picture of the effect on different hair colours, they are pretty accurate :)|`|Hxbj7rXRaa	you cant dye hair to make it lighter you would  have to bleach it and have it done by a pro cause it can damage your hair very bad if you do it wrong|`|S61zbh8Yaa	if you choose the correct colour and developer where are u buyin the colour?
UByvC54Xaa	Easy. go buy yourself a lice comb - a metal one and some rubber bands. Get some residue-free or dreadlock shampoo aswell and wash your hair. When it is fully dry - section your hair. for thin dreads - use 1/2 inch squares, for thicker up to 1&1/2 inch squares. starting about 2 inches away from the scalp, comb the hair towards the scalp allowing only a couple of hairs to be pushed down each time. If you let too many hairs go at once - you will have loose crappy looking baby dreads. So by only letting a couple of hairs go each time - you end up with tighter knots. Continue all the way down and there you go your first dread. Put rubberbands on dread about half an inch away from the scalp and another at the tips. Continue til they are all done!<br>  <br>  Now for the little bits and pieces - dreads are high maintenance in the beginning. It's not uncommon to spend at least 10 hours or more maintaining them. There is the palmrolling, root rubbing, crocheting, washing every 3-4 days, drying and also applying products like tighteners, locking accelerators and wax (which isnt necessary). Dreads can get mould if you apply wax to wet dreads or you cover them with hats, head wraps/bands etc while still wet or even slightly damp.<br>  <br>  It takes up to 2 years for dreads to mature. You can lose up to 40% of your length when you dread. you should sleep with a headwrap or dreadsock (satin works great).<br>  <br>  I have done up a how-to document that is posted on my yahoo group and there you will find heaps of cool recipes for home made dread products too. <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/dreaded_experiences/">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/dre...</a>|`|283tO9j9aa	It's harder if you don't have afro-textured hair, but you can still get them done. There are a few alternative hairdressers around who will give you dreads, otherwise you would have to ask in individual barbers or unisex hairdressers. I would definitely get them done professionally so they're in good condition, plus the stylist will tell you how to look after them.<br>  <br>  They only go mouldy if you keep getting them wet all the time, like if you don't tie them out of the way when you shower. You can use a spray-on dry shampoo to keep the roots clean.|`|7tRTZhnLaa	I wouldn't get them if I were you, you know that mold can grow in them right?
1LTrZbxwaa	You're over 18, you're an adult and should be able to do what you want. <br>  <br>  Don't go to a shady agency, go to a legit one. Just don't tell your parents or let them find out. Wait till you become a bit successful at it and make decent money and they may change their mind on how they feel about it, that's if you still want to tell them. <br>  <br>  Just don't neglect school or a good career for it since modelling is short-lived; maybe that's the reason your parents are against it because they think you will not concentrate on getting something stable.<br>  <br>  I don't get why your parents dont want you to model, theres not much of a leap between modelling and dancing its both performing in the public eye, although using different avenues to do it.|`|M03NxWlPaa	Ewww...SICK ! ! !<br>  Models are the scum of planet earth and should terminated...<br>  <br>  If youa re determined to do this though I suggest a diet of pure blubber, I hear it is high in protein and can help give the hair a healthy sheen glow...Then set up a public myspace page and hope for the best...<br>  I wish you luck in your travels.|`|SETPlNlIaa	Take photos send them to a legit model agency, and watch out for any nude type places...|`|2dya7YeKaa	Here is a little how-to about getting into the industry:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/model/model.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/mode...</a>
q8IwKTfFaa	It will mess up your tattoo. A tattoo is like a fresh wound to the body. Would you put self tanner lotion on a cut if you fell?|`|Hhifw93laa	your fine it wont hurt it just dont use it after words because it will get in to that tat and make it turn colors you dont want like shi* green belive me lol my sis did that lol and now she has a poop green butterfly ubove her but crack lol lol I have 3 of them and i use self tanner and mine are fine jsut dont use them for at leat 5 days after|`|zYVCJRMXaa	i guess it would be fine, because they are going to clean the area before it, but I wouldnt to be on the safer side.<br>  <br>  Of course once you have received the tattoo wait a lest a week until its done peeling and has finished signs of still healing before applying the self tanner lotion on again.|`|BSg9J96Oaa	It won't hurt if you use it before, but I would call the tattoo shop and ask them.  Also, a tattoo artist once told me that because a tattoo is a piece of artwork, they use your skin color in deciding the shades and everything to make it look the best.   If you plan on using the same self tanner in 20 years, then continue with the lotion, or if you don't, try to lay off the lotion and return to your natural skin color until everything is healed.|`|AA11329531	you will be just fine. they clean your skin before starting the tattoo anyway, so it will just wipe right off. remember that you will need to get unscented plain lotion for it
CugCzH9iaa	I personally HATE  open toe with nylons!  I think it looks tacky!  Those shoes are not the most professional but you could pull it off as long as the rest of the outfit is very conservative.|`|Rn7zkS52aa	eh that's a tough one. in a business casual setting i guess you would be okay, i mean are you wearing pants or a skirt/dress? if you're just wearing pants i think you're fine. if you're wearing a dress or skirt though, i'd be careful. i'd wait to see what other people are wearing in the office. you don't wanna look bad your first day!|`|Vcg2QuDWaa	The shoes look great, I think you're set.  But, I'd definitely wear them with pants.|`|Sp1DkZfgaa	for casual work, i think those would be fine. i love the shoes by the way. nice choice!|`|xCifmFfkaa	Those aren't very business casual, they're more nightclub or beachy.<br>  <br>  You can't possibly wear nylons with those anyway, they're open toe and you'd look like an idiot.<br>  <br>  You're going to end up looking like the office hooker in those. I suggest you do yourself a favor and ditch em. Find another more appropriate pair of shoes (Flats...

Just watch her.|`|adyNCp6eaa	I think you should do something like putting on a light brown shadow with brown liner and black mascara. Just a little bit makes you look pretty but you can barely notice it. It just emphasizes your eyes without making it look like you have a lot of makeup on. Also just a little bit of either clear lipgloss or light tan lipgloss would look good also. Other colors for eyeshadow that would give you a natural look is medium-dark brown, or just a gentle brush of green or grey. Hope I helped! Good luck!|`|yfPu5pcZaa	Just like me =) I get all my make-up at Sephora! Ask the ladies for help picking stuff out and tell them what your looking for. Ok I wear a mineral powder to cover up my flaws and pinky blush every day. If i feel like it I'll wear brown eyeliner on the inner part of the eye and a light mascara (not one that look thick or makes your lashes look fake long).To go out I'll wear black eyeliner and a mascara that makes my lashes look longer and thicker with some light eye shadow (never blue,green, hot pick lol anything like that). <br>  <br>  Ohh for lips I wear just lip balm daily because I don't like how lots of lip gloss looks during the day. At night I'll wear lip gloss or a reddish lip stick. Ohh the best is Benefits Bene-tint lip balm/gloss, you can wear it day or night and it look amazing. During the say wear a little so it's light and at night you an wear more so it's darker. All my friends want to take it from me, it's that awesome and they have a new one that smells better than the one I have. <br>  <br>  Good luck =D|`|I5ccK5Qfaa	You don't need make-up to look pretty, natural beauty is the best.<br>  I think more people need to discover this, our world is way to materialistic.<br>  But I am sure that you look very gorgeous without make-up.<br>  Add some mascara if you want to wear make-up and a shadow that is close to your skin color I suppose.<br>  Peace|`|xBOSZPZTaa	I am only 13 so I can't help you but I know someone who can. Go to youtube.com and look up panacea81 and watch her videos. If that doesn't work go to Maccosmetics.com and watch the tutorials.|`|YuNLzf8Uaa	If you already have good skin, I would suggest using mascara, and eyeshadow in a color which is a bit lighter than your skintone.|`|e2af61dafb939334225bbfbbd61b48ddaa	use eye liner black mascara and maybe chap stink or clear lip gloss <br>  thats all i use cause wearing to much of it can make u breakout or have wrinkles early so keep it clean fresh and naturual|`|0nc4OHs3aa	For it to look natural and soft yet preety, you should put mascara (I use the green Maybelline bottle) only on your top eyelashes just enough so it could elongate your lashes. <br>  You could smear a thin shade of gray eyeshadow on the top of your eye with a flat liner brush so it could just bring out your eyes and not make them seem too dark.
UYnZtJ2daa	I have two conch piercings. One didn't hurt at all and gave me very little problems when it was healing and the other hurt a bit more and took a little longer to heal. Neither were the most painful, at all. But I don't find piercings to be really that painful...it's over too quick to realize how much it hurt. <br>  <br>  How much it hurts and the healing process is just going to depend on your body.<br>  <br>  I have no problems sleeping on mine...or any of my other piercings.|`|2ZsRAxkuaa	Sleepings a little hard, but you get used to it. I had a healing rook on the other side though... I could sleep on it easily now if I didn't have a tempremental industrial that side too. :)<br>  <br>  Honestly, it was my easiest and quickest to heal piercing. It was enormously crusty for quite a while, but not painful.<br>  Didn't hurt to pierce particularly, but the noise was horrible.<br>  <br>  Some people have different experiences though, they say it hurts like hell. But mine was completely pain free and easy to heal, didn't swell at all.<br>  <br>  Most painful piercing I have was either rook, which was mainly just fiddling with jewellery for ages that hurt, or my bridge, as I made the mistake of opening my eyes...|`|H8DsNL8waa	I've had my cartilage piereced 9 months ago, it didn't hurt that much.<br>  But, i pierced it myself so it's a different experience.<br>  It hurt a while to sleep on it, but it's alright now.|`|G6JXHvZKaa	im sorry for your pain that one i donn,t know much about my friend had it and she is and was in a bad way it took a long time to heal!!!!
q8IwKTfFaa	I have just a regular tragus and it didnt hurt at all. The tragus in general doesnt have a high rejection rate because it is all cartilage but the vertical tragus has a higher rejection rate than a regular tragus but not by much.It has a higher migration rate though because of where it is. Also the first picture is a vertical tragus( you see how it goes THROUGH) and the other is a surface piercing or maybe even dermal anchored.|`|LDLTjNCraa	Wow, i've never seen that before. The first one looks a little strange I think.|`|G6JXHvZKaa	ithink its its a little more uncomfortable im not in to self mutilation but ido have those and think there nice as long as you don,t go to other parts of the body. its a little more uncomfortable.|`|GukaCWemaa	The first is a vertical tragus.<br>  <br>  The second link is  a  surface vertical tragus.<br>  <br>  It's not the same as a normal tragus piercing no, more chance of rejection and migration , usually not so easy to heal
CQUuCpTQaa	Do you have a Hair styling school where you live? You should check it out. They're always looking for people for the students to work on and it's all overseen by a professional stylist. They do a really great job for a fraction of what you'll pay in a salon.|`|lttblj8faa	A stylist is better because they are well trained. And if you Do not know what you want they will suggest something that will look great on you. Unlike super cuts who will do whatever is fastest.<br>  Good luck! <br>  I hope this helps! :D|`|NbUwThM4aa	the stylists at supercuts really don't care whether you leave happy because they don't keep track of their customers like a private salon does.|`|F57mAkXZaa	i have found that with hair you really get what you pay for.  supercuts is AWFUL!|`|6Tx8Opmraa	The hairstylists are all trained the same. You can get the same results from the cheaper salon.  Besides, It's the Hairstylist, Not the Salon that counts. You can get a horrible job done at the more expensive salon, and get a great job done at a Cheaper salon, or vice versa. <br>  The only difference is the price.
q8IwKTfFaa	cream is cream. and a serum is more like a gel base|`|UYnZtJ2daa	One's a cream and one's a serum?|`|AA12285495	Probably the price - but I agree with Brittany.........|`|UdiJDouhaa	The cream preferable use by age over 50, and serum is recommend for age 50 and less. <br>  Cream is ideal for skin need oil, it will block the skin pores on younger people. The serum <br>  is fast and easier for skin to absorb the nutrients. And rose extract and sea collagen makes a <br>  good anti-aging skin serum.|`|G6JXHvZKaa	serum is mostly for the eyes and its consistinsy is different  it is also used for pin point areas ware cream is basically used for all over>
lttblj8faa	It really depends on the type of event,<br>  Ask your friend what is the wear for the event. And if its dressy wear a cute semi formal dress. Such as one from Debs. They sell amazing and cheap dresses.<br>  <br>  If its more casual then maybe some skinny jeans, T-shirt and a vest. If you still wanna get dressy then maybe a casual dress w/ballet flats.<br>  Good luck!<br>  I hope this helps!|`|UP8NSYvOaa	That's a really good theme for a party, but you could interpret it in different ways.

And i'd guess at about 2 months for an inch growth .. it depends.|`|wlATm2aPaa	it will grow back and it would take a long time but I've seen people shaving their heads and they have these brilliant bobs in a few years but saying that too there has been people where it grew back but not very long.<br>  <br>  I would leave it up to yourself - depends how bad your hair looks now - me personally yes<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|AupCDLJLaa	i don't think you should shave it.. have you tried using thickening shampoos? shaving your head is a big step and you never know how your hair will grow back. its a huge risk.|`|D3rfzhL9aa	Your hair won't grow back thicker.  You have a certain number of hair follicles and that won't change.|`|7tRTZhnLaa	It will grow back healthier but it also might grow back thinner. My boyfriend had really nice thick hair then he shaved it off and now it is really thin... but it might be different with boys.|`|WJX994D2aa	It won't grow back thick but it will grow back healthy.
rpVQpJA7aa	I would say if you wear them around once every few weeks you will be just fine.
efckfiapaa	A tweezer? Or let them grow + then get wax strips made for eyebrows.
xCifmFfkaa	Not generally, but I have seen some that were so incredibly disgusting literally it made it hard to look at the person (I work as a CSR; these people were usually older men).<br>  <br>  But there's nothing wrong with neatening up a little bit everyonce and a while. I would say either/or, waxing I believe is going to be cheaper. Threading is painful...waxing is also a little painful but it's only painful for a split second.|`|KdxTQ6nGaa	hmmmm, i think there's no harm in guys doing their eyebrows. Just remember not to overdo it. Both is equally painfull but i think waxing would be better, the torture is faster..<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Depends on the person, and how bad their eye brows are. If they are really bad, I would wax them, and then maintain them by plucking them.|`|YaiqCrVGaa	no, guys should care.<br>  girlfriends usually take care of the unibrow.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	NO,NO,NO waxing for mens eyebrows! Tweezing strays or between is find,  but waxing is just such a bad look on men|`|YX9ofix3aa	no and yes its up to you on what to do with your body and i would say wax.|`|s7seaaPkaa	i think taking a lil extra hairs off is cool.<br>  but not like shaping them thats just gay.|`|o07KqtFZaa	sure...if they're outta control or if they have a unibrow.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	wax|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	My girlfriend is always commenting on how nice my eyebrows are, it's nice to know I have one redeeming feature so I'll keep 'em as is lol.|`|NIEt2CEZaa	if they are bushy and unibrow then yes. Get the middle above your nose waxed and ask them to thin out your eyebrows. Go to a nail salon place they do it and will know what you mean to thin them out.|`|KkkugCJ0aa	no dude, just use tweezers to pluck the unibrow but other than that dont get them weaved or waxed, thats for girls and douchebags|`|IHwMbLX5aa	If they are super big or monobrow yes. I would just say get them waxed.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I pluck my husbands from time to time. I call it man-scaping :)

Gain some confidence and learn to like yourself. :]<br>  Second of all, I think you should dye like... the under layer of your bangs bleach blonde, and then get chunks of whatever color you'd like under your other hair. It'd be badddd asssss.|`|TfEBIjxZaa	Uhm, Do you really care what kids think in school?|`|xieiM0FRaa	You can't even see your hair in that picture.<br>  Anyway, dye it what you want as long as your school doesn't have rules against certain colors [some do, and you can be suspended].<br>  It really doesn't matter what others think.|`|F57mAkXZaa	you can buy clip in color streaks many places....<br>  manicpanic.com<br>  doctoredlocks.com<br>  hairextensions.com<br>  are just a few.  then you have cool color with no commitment so you can wear it when you want and school can't make you dye it...just take it out!

I had a guy do mine and he was really good at putting me at ease.

9a9D7PXUaa	don't use live xxl it is one of the worst hair colours you can get because of the amount of ammonia it contains <br>  ammonia can cause bad skin irritations and can even make your hair fall out <br>  bleach can also leave a chemical burn on your scalp which only the hospital could treat <br>  <br>  use a semi permanent hair dye like gamier nutrease cream you get a better result with the Colour and it contains no ammonia so it wont damage your hair <br>  you have to keep dying it if you use permanent or non permanent as your natural colour roots grow through <br>  dye your hair when its short for best result <br>  <br>  go with garnier nutrease cream it the best dye|`|giBfNMX6aa	Lets say you have medium brown hair and you want to go platinum blonde.  The recommendation if you are using a product at home, you should take the color only 2 shades lighter.  If the color you want is more than 2 shades lighter, go to a salon.  See how they do it, and ask the stylist if she/he thinks you could achieve the look at home.  If not, then be prepared to constantly spend $ to maintain the color, because in about 4 weeks you'll have dark roots.|`|S61zbh8Yaa	dont wash your hair washing up liquid it will strip the natural oils from your hair and ruin it.the box colous never come out the same colour go for one shade darker than the colour you want on the box for examplw the colour you want is 6-77 go for 7-77 hope i helped|`|9f8XoDKJaa	Do it professionally or you might be green.|`|SDnhUMv9aa	That dye is really crap, its prone to allergic reaction so before you do anything I would test it with a little bit on a peice of hair that isn't really on show, wait for a day and then use it. It's just the colours look really unatural if you look at the box and see the people on the box, they look terrible. They proberly didn't use that dye but it just shows the standards. I would consider using a different brand. <br>  Laura x|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	if it is the xxl platinum blonde colour, well that is the colour I use to pre lighten my hair with before colouring it.<br>  <br>  I have medium brown hair and applied xxl to pre lighten it and it turned blonde straight away so if your dye is the same colour and your hair is light/medium brown then it will probably pre lighten it enough to re-dye to your preferred shade of blonde<br>  <br>  But in my opinion natural is always best, thats why Im back to brunette =)
kCdISEGqaa	I don't think it should matter what anyone else thinks about your choice of tattoos.  But, I do want to warn you about ambigram tattoos.  Unless they are done extremely large, they age poorly and look like a big, unrecognizable blob.  And if you're putting yours on your wrist, it's going to be too small to show well with time.  Just something to think about.|`|Hhifw93laa	NO TATTOO LOOKS TRASHY UNLESS THE ARTIST MESSES UP GO GET IT AND IF YOU ARE HAVING 2ND THOGHTS ABOUT IT YOU PROBIBLY SHOULD NOT GET IT ITS 100% THERE FOR LIFE I HAVE 3 AND PLAIN TO HAVE MORE AND YOU DONT WANT TO REGRET GETTING THE WORD REGRET BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT IT GO GET IT|`|q8IwKTfFaa	Honestly, if you are having second thoughts on it, maybe "no regrets" isnt the best thing to get. Because if you are worried bout what other people think are trashy now, just wait until you are 90 and you get a million weird looks. Plus, i dont think any tattoo is trashy, not even a lower back tattoo|`|br1FB5rraa	I like the idea, but I don't think it would look good on ur forearm tho. I think it would look better on ur back or going down ur side or something like that.
kCdISEGqaa	Hi Kyle, I am wondering, how old are you?  Have you thought this through?  I am not one to talk people out of tattoos, but, I always try to talk people in to thinking them through first.  I am a female tattoo artist and find it easy to relate to all of my clients.  Guess it is a motherly instinct.  Have you established yourself in a career filed yet?  If so, will your current employer allow such a big, bold design to be shown?  Are you Polynesian?  Tribal tattoos are kind of out-dated.  Is this your first tattoo?  If so, maybe consider getting it in a different location to see if it is something you will like.  The reason I ask is, usually people who are tattooed, have a better idea of what tattoos cost before going into a shop.  Best wishes!|`|C3yO4HYUaa	I agree with all of the postings (except the first, obviously). I have four myself, and all are about the same size. I have been to four different artists/shops, and have paid as low as $50 and as high as $180. <br>  It all depends on where you want it, the artist, complexity, color, size, etc.<br>  Good luck - I would get some estimates and then go from there!|`|d185f39553435f17970e180ddffe3d53aa	The only person that can accurately tell you the price would be the artist doing it.  Instead of wasting your time on here, your time would be better spent consulting a tattoo artist.  Get off your butt and set up an appointment for a consultation.|`|6LJzt2ngaa	it really depends on the artist. if the charge by the hour, or design? its probably best if you go around and talk to the artists in town to get an estimate, and their personal opinions on it.|`|PT49mUyeaa	your best bet is to ask the artist doing the work. but your in luck to day I am a professional tattoo artist and my specialty is polynesian work. so right off hand your looking at about 3 to 400. for a taulima. that would be the Samoan word for the tattoo you are describing.

Its when the 40+ crowd starts trying to act younger than they are thats a problem. Anywho, another person was right, the pink probably won't show up against your dark hair.

Just don't use any heat on them or they could melt.|`|XHrTJXwlaa	I'm not sure if it would show up but if you can get it out before work or whatever then it'd be cute.

0PHkx64paa	I'm fourteen too with pale skin and rosie cheeks :| lol I just wear the basic make up, my foundation is maybelline natural mineral matte powder, and it might help to wear some mascara too so that your eyes don't sink in, I use maxfactor false lash effect, also if you find you need concealer I'd recommend maxfactor.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I've helped x|`|fqIE566Caa	for the red cheeks try 17s colour corrector before you put on make up. or you could try Benefits You're Bluffing bluff dust or wand. The greeny yellow cancels out the red. I swear by the number 17 stuff :)<br>  As for foundation try Revlon, they have pretty pale shades. Don't go for a moussey type as it dries out your skin. Revlon do a very natural looking one (the new stuff that is white?). As your 14, make sure you give your skin days off from your foundation.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I agree with the above comment, L'oreal true match is quite good for colour but can be a little drying if your skins already on the dry side (is for mine anyway).|`|F3txRHgaaa	being really pale i have tried heaps of different brands but the best i have found so far is maxfactor miracle  touch in creamy ivory it is spreadable and is really light and soft. i think tho nicola d really pale one from girls aloud has brought out a foundation called babydoll or somethin like that|`|hXNnhAaoaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you.

4w361g8Laa	It really depends on their face shape/body shape etc. Not THAT much on their. Though, fashion will say that after your out of you teens, you really shouldn't have hair any longer than the bottom of your breasts. This is because it can look silly on a woman and its just not healthy for your hair. Most older women (50+) choose shorter hair because it is just easier to take care of, doesn't take a lot of blowdry time which can be tough on your arms and muscles. As far as long or short looking better, that will vary from woman to woman. You can't just generalize it and say long hair looks better on all older women. :)|`|mIBxxBFFaa	depends on the health- they healthier the longer, but if its wispy and feathery i would say keep it short and grow it out healthy.

I like doing it because I never get the 'bad hair cut' day and don't have to waste time going to the stylist. I must be doing something right since everyone say's my hair is normal. I just grab a chunk of hair in my hand and cut many times, taking a little hair away at a time.<br>  <br>  It's really hard to explain, but just look at what the hair stylist does, how they grab hair in between their fingers and clip away. For the back near my neck, I use a hand held mirror and kind of cut it randomly, but it ends up fine when I run my hand through it a few times.<br>  <br>  Also, for your bangs try clipping a few millimeters away at a time. Don't cut too much since even a few hairs off can make your bangs look short and awkward.<br>  <br>  The only annoying thing is that now my parents ask me to cut their hair for them, but I for some reason, I can only cut my own hair.|`|e1d102bac5436ccdc1f7ad70bd34d95aaa	best of luck.

I think if you're going to wear regular tights where you'll see a distinct line where the tights are sewn, you should wear close-toed.  Fishnets would be cute though :)|`|v0kOwUikaa	I wear pantyhose or tights with open toe heels all the time.

6mZJSqBgaa	There is nothing wrong with dye in a box- you need to take in consideration the state of your hair BEFORE you colored it.  Was it dark or dyed another color?  If so, that's why it's not quite blonde YET.<br>  <br>  Going blonde is a PROCESS.  Which often requires many steps.  Now you need to tone your hair.  Go to Sally's and ask for a toner.  They will help you. Pay attention of the base color of the tone choose.  IF your hair is yellow, get a purple base (purple is opposite color of yellow and will neautralize it.  If you hair is orangy.. get blue because blue is the opposite of orange and will neutralize that.  <br>  <br>  Don't worry, it not expensive.  Email me if you have questions.|`|io3lMQgFaa	I had this problem!!  So read carefully, haha.  First of all to tone down this color now without dying it again, try to find a purple shampoo (one that's meant to tone down yellow tones in blonde hair).  From now on when buying boxed dye, try Loreal Preference in a light blonde "cooler" tone (it will say warmer, natural, or cooler on the box.)  I went around to soo many different brands (I too didn't have the money for a salon) and this is the only one that worked for me.  Hope it works for you too!|`|WO66BG5waa	hey!<br>  ok so i had black hair and went blonde 6 times from black to blonde black to blonde, ect...<br>  anyway NO never trust hair box dye lol i have to have extensions now lol<br>  but anyway look for shampoos that have jasmine in them, the natrual herb will tone down the brassiness.<br>  i hope it helped :)|`|Vrzn4r8Qaa	Try a purple toner. I bleached my hair blonde and it got kind of brassy. So I put that in and it took it away.|`|7618x2okaa	ask ur hairdresser|`|5Kd9tdNDaa	well I would suggest dying it darker because dying your hair dark does not affect your hair. Unfortunately, bleach will not wash out. You could also try a toner which you leave on for 3 minutes and then wash out. :)|`|rMDHNPnEaa	There are one or two solutions:<br>  <br>  Use the purple/blue rinse. You can buy it at Sally Beauty Supply. A lot of older women use it to take yellow out. It makes a little mess but it will take the yellow out. I would also use gloves so it doesn't stain your hands.<br>  <br>  You could also buy a warmer tone of hair color. It will probably end up much darker if you do that. <br>  <br>  If you have the money and the time going to a professional salon. They are better at it. At least ask them for help the first few times you do your hair.<br>  <br>  I've been using boxed hair dye for 20 years...and have only had one big boo boo.  Right now my favorite is Garne Fruitress. I like the red tones and it is gentle. My hair feels softer after using it...I don't know if they have good blonde hair products.  Some brands are good in some colors and not as good in others. It is best to shop around and find one that works with your hair.<br>  <br>  I will say that going to the salon is sometimes better, but it is also more expensive. If you are new to color and don't know much about it then go to a salon.<br>  <br>   But if you've been doing it for a while and know what you are doing then buying a box of color can look good too.
lttblj8faa	I tryed REALLY hard to find a pic but I couldnt find one ANY WHERE! SO I sadly have no idea what it looks like :[ i'm sorry...|`|vEiaoR3Saa	I like fried bananas.|`|RuFZABFxaa	Ask a pocket elf.
86UljsVfaa	lol i feel you. you should try and tan at least every 3 days now since its ur wedding day is getting closer, but my advice to you is to go with a tanner that will darken ur skin more, but lay not as long. ive done this and my skin is tan..but its really really beautiful. i got a lot of compliments... <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|H8DsNL8waa	There's no doubt that  if you go tanning once or twice a week and use self tanner it will keep your tan.|`|Rn7zkS52aa	I would recommend using a tan lotion enhancer as well, such as a bronzer or a tingler, or like a tan extender. A good one is Brown Sugar Fashion Princess 50X, Designer SKin Bombshell. So if you got a good bronzer or enhancer, and got a tan life extender..I used to use Body Kisses by Swedish Beauty, that combined with tanning 2 times a week should be good. I don't even think you'd need to use self tanner in between if you bought the lotions!!
f4RnGIeSaa	Hair at the ends and scalp are very different.  Hair at the ends absorbs color and chemicals better than at the scalp usually and hair near the scalp also has the heat of your head to help it develop.<br>  <br>  This is why when you go to a professional they start at your scalp, and then work it into the ends so the scalp has longer to process.|`|7aK81hsbaa	after lightening the new growth i'd have finished with a "soap cap" which is shampoo mixed with leftover color. leave it on for  5-10 min. and rinse. it's gentle and slows the action of the developer on the ends which are more absorbent. do go to the salon.
vWKQJhwRaa	i like the 2nd one cuz the first looks a little slutish but i luv the eyes while the second one looks normal and cute :D|`|XHrTJXwlaa	The first one, it gorgious and it looks very grown up. Your hair looks really good that way.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	WHICH one???? <br>  I like the 2nd one best|`|jKA8SovQaa	one, because it seems more professional and up close i just like the edited way.
I5ccK5Qfaa	Yes dude do it, get like a color that's two shades lighter then your hair color. I bet that you will look so incredibly pretty with it.<br>  :)<br>  Peace|`|qg1Cr7dAaa	hmmm, it depends on your skin color.<br>  But say if you have a skin color which looks like the lady in the pic then I would say light brown highlight looks perfect|`|4lNq0GtMaa	toasted almond <br>  <br>  its a hair dye color it would look good|`|TfEBIjxZaa	I'd get a chesnut color and get them blended.<br>  <br>  They are more like low lights.
E9g4bB77aa	Wal-Mart actually.  There's this Remington (maybe?) Wet 2 Straight brand, it's pretty cool.  I have thick hair that's prone to frizz, too, and it works on me. :)|`|CugCzH9iaa	Ulta carries all kinds.  I hear Chi is a great straightener.  I am not sure if they make one for wet hair but I would guess that they probably do.|`|Rn7zkS52aa	The thing is, you usually have to buy a bit more of an expensive one to get a good straight look, especially you because you have curly frizzy hair. I have bought cheaper ones (like 20-30 bucks) and they aren't good...and I have only a slight wave in my hair if that! Helen of Troy's hair straighteners are REALLY good. So are Chi. Helen of Troy I'm pretty sure are at stores like Sally Hansen. You can also look online. Chi are sold alot of places like that, also at Sephora. I REALLY think you need to invest in a good one for your type of hair. If not, you will just keep buying a bunch of crappy ones, and it'll end up costing you a good amount of money anyways. Hands down, best cream to help you style is Aveda Smooth Infusion style prep smoother. They have a kit on their website with the shampoo, conditioner, a helpful straightening comb, the prep smoother, and another product for a good deal. These products are SOO good. I used to buy straightening stuff at the store, but I get tons of compliments once I started using those products. I know they are a bit pricier, but it is TOTALLY worth it. I have pretty long hair and the 3.4 bottle of smooth infusion lasted me like over 8 months. You can buy aveda products online, by the link I gave ya, or search for a store that cares certified aveda products.

bEXAc8azaa	Is it hurting or just uncomfortable?<br>  Because obviously, the bar they pierced it with is alot longer than what a normal bar is, so its normal for it to rub against your mouth. <br>  It will be uncomfortable for about 1 to two weeks, depending on how fast your tongue heals, but until than, just use bonjella, mouth wash, and try not to move your tongue around. I know its hard not to play with it, but try try try! Your mouth will thank you for it later. <br>  Enjoy x|`|CugCzH9iaa	You get use to it!

lU8e0VQFaa	Only a parent or guardian can give consent for a minor to be pierced and they have to prove it, you'll both need ID and probably a birth certificate if last names are different or paperwork showing guardianship. And NEVER go to claire's or any other mall piercing place, they don't have the first clue what they're doing and will cause you more problems than it's worth If your mom has said no then there's not much you can do. If you pester her about it, you'll just piss her off and she'll keep saying no just to spite you. Give it up for now and try again when you're older.|`|xT024KMsaa	You just wait it out.

Water is a good way to fight acne.<br>  <br>  Don't use soap, use facial clenser. The soap will tend to dry your skin.

2dya7YeKaa	Tattoo artists are not doctors.  They cannot give you shots.  That would be illegal.<br>  <br>  You should not take painkillers in pill form before getting tattooed.  Apart from the fact that some of them thin your blood (not too great for getting tattooed) they can screw with your perception of what is happening to your body.  If something is wrong you may not realize it and if you don't know something is wrong you cannot communicate it to your tattoo artist.<br>  <br>  Some people use EMLA cream but all of the tattoo artists I know hate tattooing skin that has been numbed with topical stuff.  It makes your skin react to sensory stimulus differently.  If your tattoo artist has never tattooed someone who used a numbing cream before it may throw them off a bit.<br>  <br>  You should also know that with topical numbing agents there is no guarantee how long it will work for.  Normally when you get tattooed your body kicks in your endorphins to help you cope with the pain.  If you use a numbing cream that won't happen.  I have heard stories from people who got tattooed and used EMLA and theirs wore off in the middle of the tattoo.  Because they hadn't had their typical endorphin response it was harder for them to deal with than it would have been.  <br>  <br>  I have a lot of tattoos and personally I don't find them all that painful.  It certainly isn't bad enough that I think numbing the skin is necessary. If your tattoo is pretty small it shouldn't take very long.|`|Hhifw93laa	no and it really don't hurt that much who ever told you that is lying after like the first 5 min every thing goes numb so your good|`|UYnZtJ2daa	No tattoo artist will tattoo you if you've taken a painkiller. It thins your blood. <br>  <br>  Tattoo artists, by law, can't give you shots or pills. <br>  <br>  It's not going to kill you to feel a little pain.|`|S5ZYHiFaaa	NO!!! people never seem to get this. tattoos are needles that puncture your skin, skin when punctured bleeds, painkillers of ANY kind thin the blood, if your blood is thin, then the wound won't heal properly and you'll end up with a f*cked up looking tattoo.<br>  <br>  you want the tattoo, you have to deal with the pain.|`|d185f39553435f17970e180ddffe3d53aa	If you need a painkiller or a numbing cream than you dont deserve a tattoo.|`|RSKtvpflaa	Don't be a baby!  They don't hurt that much.  Its a needle.  Why would you need pain meds for that?|`|XYT7jvBdaa	It is against the law for a tattoo artist to tattoo you when you're on painkillers, and it's even more against the law for them to provide them to you. Painkillers thin the blood, which is why you cannot lawfully get tattooed while on them.

I think you can wear anything you want as long as you own it when you wear it.  If you want to wear a bow tie, wear it.. but don't let the bow tie wear you.  Make sure that you do it tastefully and that it works with your suit.  As long as you wear it, are confident in it, and it matches your suit.  Look for examples of celebrities or models in suits with bow ties and model your style after that.

Losing weight may work although i wouldn't suggest it because you would probably then be underweight (i don't know your height so hard to say) and also there is no telling which part of the body the weight would come off of so it's not worth it. If what people are saying is bothering you then you can get minimizer bras that make you look a cup or 2 smaller.|`|I54KyS8Laa	You have a lot of great posts and they all seem to agree. Only consider breast reduction if you notice back aches. <br>  But because you had to ask the question indicates that you might be self conscious as most teens are. Some grow out of self consciousness naturally by their late 20’s—some never grow out of it which is why I'd suggest you get a head-start by reading self image psychology books like Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz (which I have no financial interests and a book that everyone should read at least once). Focus on the parts about self consciousness and being happy. <br>  <br>  And then after you gain some insights to self image psychology and later on want to build true self esteem so you can feel good about you even on a bad hair day or when you really make a big mistake or look clumsy or what ever, then take advantage of the references below. <br>  <br>  Have a Great Year of Self Discovery<br>  <br>  Richard K|`|G6JXHvZKaa	sweaty you are just an endowed young lady talk to your mom and dad and a doctor about a breast reduction it will be alot healthier for you  so much as you get older will happen back aches just alot of problems that can be dolved now while you are young  you are the first young lady i heard that is this large it must run in the family  but really see someone for your own personal happieness.|`|xDQadV2Zaa	That's ****** great|`|zKoNElg7aa	Can I see a picture? ;)<br>  teasing...|`|t5K4jZYvaa	no ur boobs wont get smaller frm llosing weight my sister is like that 2 dnt worry.|`|6Rajgcjiaa	its your genes. be happy with what you have!|`|XYT7jvBdaa	Your boobs are only too big if YOU think that they are. I was a bigger bra size than you when I was your age, and losing weight didn't do much. The body picks and chooses where it wants to lose weight-some from the belly, others from the breasts, others from the thighs...you get the idea. Of course it's natural for your breasts to be so big, they're not fake after all. There is no "normal" standard for breast size, no matter your age. Don't compare yourself to others. Just go with what makes you happy.|`|LXNo9ROaaa	No, you just have big ****.

D3rfzhL9aa	Your best bet would be to contact Sephora since they would have been the ones that refunded your payment.  Have your order number and everything ready for when you call.

XYT7jvBdaa	-To keep your eyeliner lasting all day, it is best to set it with some kind of powder, or better yet, a small amount of black eyeshadow over it. It creates a smokier effect, but increases staying power. But your eyeliner smudging and moving can also have something to do with the eyeliner itself-some brands of eyeliner are just crap. I use Revlon ColorStay eyeliner and it doesn't move all day long. <br>  <br>  -Use a lash primer, such as the one by MAC (Prep and Prime Lash) to keep mascara from flaking and keep your lashes looking long and gorgeous. Also, make sure not to apply too much. If you apply too much, it takes a very long time to dry so it may smear.<br>  <br>  -Use a foundation primer to keep your concealer still throughout the day. It may also help to set it with a transparent or neutral powder.|`|XHrTJXwlaa	I'm going to guess that you're around heat a fair amount, I think your only option would be to get waterproof everything (it tends to stay on better and is longer wearing just by default regaurdless whether you're in water or not) and then go into the bathroom at lunchtime or whenever and reapply and fix your makeup as needed|`|vpmT5p8Saa	use a facial primer and a quality bronzing powder...for example dior make a bronzer which is long wearing, spf 25 and also water resistant! and try a waterproof eye pencil...there's not too many around but its worth the investment...just be sure to pick up a good eyemakeup remover to take it off with!|`|UBdWXScKaa	it might sound strange<br>  but spray hairspray on your face,<br>  obviously close your eyes though to avoid blindness aha,<br>  trust me it work, i use it everyday x <br>  dontt cover it in hairspray as it tends to get sticky|`|7OtGCvcOaa	you can use mac paint to keep your eyeliner on and use a face primer to keep bronzer on. i don't know why your mascara comes off though maybe it isn't very good?|`|wlWCGGVIaa	I would love to know the answer to this tooo (: <br>  You could try different brands of make-up.

Then for eyeliner and mascara I use Benefit She Laq.  It is a small bottle of liquid that seals makeup.  The product does come with small brushes to apply the seal. So after you apply eyeliner and mascara use the brushes that the product comes with and apply.  The product is a little pricey ($30) but definitely worth it. I have oily skin so my make up used to wear right off but I did notice a difference after using these products. Also there are some tutorials on Youtube that show you how to apply it.|`|1fUWIR8maa	Waterproof mascara and waterproof liquid eyeliner<br>  <br>  Mac Factor false lash effect mascara in waterproof is very good and it doesnt come off at all untill u take it off with make-up remover<br>  hope I helped|`|xO2TIwsJaa	well do your foundation before you do your eye make up. If you use a concealer you should use the powder foundation that goes with it, not just a bronzing powder. I suggest Mabelline mineral power concealer, and powder foundation, I use it and it lasts all day. Bronzing powder however, isn't necessary but if you want to use it, do not use a lot.<br>  <br>  And for your eyes, put the eyeliner on your bottom water line, draw a thin line. Do not put it below the eyelashes, it looks fake when people do that, and it smudges a lot. And for mascara,  try Cover Girl Lash Exact, it works really well.<br>  <br>  Try that and see if it works. Hope I could help!|`|3PHYEH1Aaa	Well first off, for eyeliner you should use Urban Decay 24/7 Glide on Pencil, it's the best eyeliner out there right now, and it really does stay on 24/7. It stays on so good, that you would need a good eye makeup remover to remove it. I use a Neutrogena Oil-Free one. As for mascara, use a waterproof one, and for the powder, when you apply your bronzer, after that apply a loose powder to set your makeup, or use MAC Fix+.|`|yUBxjBsiaa	Hey for the powder to stay use a face primer<br>  <br>  and for mascara and eyeliner an eyeshadow primer like urban decay primer potion or too faced shadow or laura mercier.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped, love<br>                                  Ilovefashion&stuff|`|yfPu5pcZaa	Part of the problem is that you're wearing too much make-up.

Don't expect them to go on sale now that it is spring since the Ugg boots are NOT winter boots. They are fall and spring fashion boots. If you are a shoes size 7 or smaller you can get kids Ugg boots for cheaper. If you are a size 7, you will want to buy size 6. Normally kids sizing is down 2 sizes, but the kids Ugg boots run small, so you only go down 1 size. <br>  <br>  Ebay and Craigslist may be fake, so be prepared to lose the money if you get a bad fake.

Then tear open 2 or 3 tea bags and mix them with some basil in a pan, put about 4-6 cups water int eh pan and bring to a boil. Pour the 'tea' into a bowl, lean over the bowl and drape a towel over your head and the bowl. The steam will open your pores and help rid your skin of troubles. After five or ten minutes of steaming, wash your face with warm water, splash with cold, then apply egg white all over your face. Rinse off after 20-60 minutes.|`|uzfdgFSxaa	You may want to use a facial steamer to clear up your acne.  A steamer will open up your pores and help get sebum out of your skin which causes the acne.  Using cold water after wards will tighten up your pores. There are steamers out there as low as $22.00 or you can do it the old fashion way of boiling a pot of hot water and lean your face over the steam with a towel (like a tent) over your head to keep the steam in your facial/neck area.  Good luck.|`|UdiJDouhaa	You should try to use some mild daily exfoliants, and a nourishing, soothing masque.<br>  Don’t use any cream/lotion on your face, so your skin pores are not blocked. <br>  I use Neutroslim Daily Exfoliants.

lttblj8faa	Lets start with the dress,<br>  Ok, the best part of going to some one ELSE'S prom is that you CAN go in a short dress. WHich, is cheaper and some times cuter. SO that opens up a lot of options. A great place to get a dress is Debs its cute, affordable and good for ALL body types. I personally love pink or Orange prom dresses because it makes you look different! :]<br>  <br>  For your achene problem, DO NOT USE STRONG TREATMENTS!<br>  STay away from Proactive, its great but some times has a bad effect on people with skin like yours. ALso try and stay away from sweets the month of the prom and wash your face more often. If your face DOES brake out the night b4 prom try s hair style that will cover your forehead  and if that doesn't work use a good foundation. I personally like Bare minerals it works amazingly! And if that's to expensive then try a poser brand. You can find them at Wal-mart.<br>  <br>  About the guy,<br>  The best advice I was EVER given was to think of questions and topics b4 hand. Just some good ones for ice breakers ya know? Make sure some of your questions are ones that can not be replied with one word. ALso, do NOT stare at him..But on the other hand make a good amount of eye contact. If you avoid his face all day he will get the wrong idea.<br>  <br>  I really hope this helps!<br>  Have a great prom!|`|f3xEWmBZaa	all i no is that red looks gr8 on most people, sexy and elegant!<br>  yes get red, it is sexy and it wont bring out ur acne it will blend it so its not as easy 2 notice, and green is horrible for a dress, maybe get blue or brown, depending on ur eye colur|`|Cp2syI16aa	I think you need to calm down a little. where a brown or green dress with matching jewelry. stop stressing out because it causes them breakouts. wash your face with hot water and when you done rinsing plash your face with cold water to close your pores.

8f1d1853d8165fc396dd6979c6b5d286aa	I think it is 16 because you are still growing. Call some piercing studios.

62n8SMxkaa	It really isn't best too. My present school doesn't allow them either, but I was on holidays when I got it done so by the time school started again I was healed and could change to a plastic one.<br>  <br>  If you must I don't think it would be insanely bad, because lip piercings are constantly being pushed in and out anyway, so if you change it to a plastic one and clean it before you put it in and clean it when it's in, you should live. But I strongly suggest you wear a plastic one for 4 weeks at least, it's not ok to change it but if you must, change it to a plastic one and leave that one it, even when you go out and aren't at school. You can't constantly keep changing it because it will take a long time to heal and will hurt and swell and then it WILL get infected. <br>  <br>  So if you really desperately need to change it, do so but don't change it after that. Just wear the plastic one for a while.|`|kAhXleGaaa	dont do that, unless you want an infection and WAY prolonged healing.<br>  keep the original jewelry in until its fully healed (about 6-8 weeks)<br>  and then you can change it.<br>  <br>  <br>  --edit--<br>  if your school doesnt allow piercings, why did you get it done??|`|2ZsRAxkuaa	Have a piercer change it to a quartz retainer for you. That way its clean, and minimizes infection.<br>  But keep the retainer in for the rest of the healing period. Its really really bad to agravatee your piercing like that. Its pretty bound to get infected.|`|nOKBoX7Kaa	If you want to change it everyday before it's healed there is an extremely high chance it will get infected.
QxuqywYjaa	For Me Dove  is the best it comes in a range of shades so you have alot of choice <br>  it is also a moisturiser so you will have soft tanned skin with no streaks or blotches if you apply it right just rub it in with circular motions its great =] <br>  <br>  good luck xx =]|`|rpVQpJA7aa	I prefer to use Oasis!

She is intitled to her shoes- tell her just to ask for them back, her manager can't say no.

The last thing your wife should be worried about is keeping the job because it's a very abusive environment.|`|3k2NjOWsaa	that is VERY retarded.  You or your wife should go talk to the company owner saying that you and everyone else should get their heels back or else they will report the niece to the authorities for theft.

VXW1XeFsaa	There are special hair serum products you can use to protect your hair.  You apply them before using a straightener or curling iron.  I like the Chi Hair silk serum.   Also make sure you get regular trims and deep condition your hair every 2 or 3 weeks.|`|aEpPt9koaa	You need to get a heat protectant. Biosilk is good and its light weight so it won't weigh your hair down. Just apply a small amount after you wash your hair but before you blow dry it. But I really reccommend that you try to avoid flat ironing and curling your hair EVERYDAY. That in itself is going to damage your hair even when using a heat protectant.|`|xieiM0FRaa	Heat protectant.<br>  You apply it before using the flat iron/curling iron.<br>  <br>  Try not to use those things everyday because it does deal a lot of damage.|`|8iE6oDmwaa	use shampoo and conditioner that's for dry damaged hair|`|7618x2okaa	heat protecting spray|`|wWzK6eJaaa	Try bedhead products... they have a thermal heat protector and it makes ur hair look full and not flat...i recommend it :-)|`|fjkukJMFaa	i use "ion straight" anti-frizz solutions heat protection straightening IONspray! i get this from sally beauty Supply for less than 7 bucks|`|efckfiapaa	Get some decent shampoo like Tresseme, they have amazing anti damaging shampoo's.
2ZsRAxkuaa	Don't try it!<br>  Double flares are evil for fresh stretches. Really really evil.... <br>  <br>  You can buy 00g tapers here:<a href="http://www.bodyartforms.com/productdetails.asp?ProductID=1639" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodyartforms.com/productdetai...</a><br>  <br>  After that.. it gets a little more complicated<br>  You can use insertion pins <a href="http://www.bodyjewelleryshop.com/online_store/steel_tapered_insertion_pins_4020428.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodyjewelleryshop.com/online_...</a><br>  But they can be a little expensive.<br>  Or you can try taping. Its pretty easy once you get the hang of it.<br>  Buy a roll of PTFE tape from a DIY store, they use it for plumbing. And wrap one layer of tape around a no flares plug, about once a week. Make sure to use loads and loads of lube though, until the tape goes clearish. Otherwise it can get kinda melded to the inside of your ear, and thats not good...<br>  <br>  Or you can dead stretch by wearing heavyish jewellery, but that takes forever, and puts uneven  pressure on your ears, which can make them thin, skanky and uneven.<br>  <br>  So yah, I like taping.

1A9TdN4yaa	Henna is a good idea but I hope you know it is a drying agent so you need to put oil and half an hour after oiling you need to apply henna and that also for 45 minutes only because the scalp can absorb only for 15 to 20 minutes.<br>  If you have grey hair then it will turn reddish otherwise to change black hair it is a challenge. You need to add 2 egg yolks and 4 table spoon of yoghurt and it should be like a cake batter and to achieve that add water after the yolk and yoghurt.<br>  As for oil it can be coconut oil or almond oil or there is a 100% natural lotion It is lotion which is a natural formula made of essential oils such as coconut, olive, avocado and Aragon (from the Atlas Mountains) with extracts from fresh fruits, green plants including rose petals, cinnamon sticks.<br>  Oils and extracts of fruits and green plants penetrate rapidly through the scalp, providing rich and deep nourishment to hair follicles and it gets strengthened. It is Ziravie, I used to but it in Spain but it is available on ebay.co.uk and the ID is hair-treatment.<br>  After henna and shampoo do make sure you use a conditioner|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Isn't Henna color...? Anywho, Never use any sort of deep conditioner everyday, You'll just end up overconditing your hair. You can use it weekly, or atleast once every month.
Fkl6gV8Qaa	Washing it repeatedly with dish soap sometimes works but it's going to make your hair feel like straw.|`|HQmAP5EVaa	It usually takes at least a month for semi-perm to wash out.

s7seaaPkaa	i dont think theres any special tricks to this.<br>  you just dont cut it.<br>  and hair to the waist is not cute at all.<br>  in my opinion.<br>  it has no body and you can really do anything but ponytails with it.|`|PBY9MNDFaa	Keeping your hair long becomes easier as it gets longer.  It begins to sit better when it gets by your shoulders.  You should still visit the hairdresser to have it trimmed of split ends regularly (roughly every six to eight weeks), otherwise it will look poorly conditioned.  In the meantime, whilst growing it out, make use of hairbands and 'claws' to put your hair back or up.  Try to use good quality conditioner every time you wash it.  Also, even though you want long hair, it would still be advisable to have some layers put through your hair, because it makes it quicker to dry.|`|Gem96NQyaa	I've actually never cut mine since I was very little.  I think my last hair cut was when I was 8.  20 years of growth adds up.|`|Pi2jc5kZaa	Oh, I use to have it way past my waist, under my hips in fact, but it's a lot of maintenance. First, you have to be patient and let your hair grow at its own pace (mine grows really fast). You're going to want to cut any split ends, too. I don't know if it's proven, but my hair always grew a little faster when I cut my split ends and if makes it look healthier and nicer. When you do get long hair, comb it day and night and sleep with a loose (not tight, you can lose your hair through out time like this) braid, to avoid tangles and knots. Which sucks when you have long hair.|`|io3lMQgFaa	Trim every month, or depending on how often you get split ends.  Also the best CHEAP shampoo and conditioner for this is Garnier Fructis length and strength...don't bother with Pantene; it makes your hair look great at first but there is a waxy buildup in the shampoo that people don't know about which makes it hard for conditioner to do its job and the hair will break more often.  Of course if you don't mind paying more I'd try a slightly more expensive brand that claims to do the same thing, but again, Garnier is the best cheap brand.|`|y4cNZEIgaa	I just didn't cut it...get it trimmed every 2-5 months. I had my jaw lenth and took 1 1/2 yrs to grow it to the top of my waist :) It was worth the wait!!! haha now I am trying to grow it to my belly button! it should take a yr to grow tht long :( . Because the average person grows 1/2 inch-1 inch per month. about 6-12 inchs per yr (normally not 12 inches) :( .<br>  <br>  Hope that helped ?|`|XHrTJXwlaa	First off you've got to be patient, especially if your hair doesn't grow very fast.<br>  Eat a lot of protein because that helps hair and nails grow fast.<br>  Don't brush your hair too much, if you want to keep it neat when it finally gets really long, braids are the best way. <br>  If your hair is long, use a good conditioner for long hair, Pantene makes a good one I think.<br>  Get it trimmed if you REALLY want, but honestly I don't see much of a point in it because it'll just take longer to grow out, especially if you get a stupid hair dresser who cuts off 5 inches instead of just 2. (It's happened before)<br>  I'd say get it trimmed AFTER you grow it out a little past the point you want it. If you're the kind of person who can't stand having split ends, get in the habit of taking them out when you're just bored or sitting around or something, make it kind of a nervous habit like tapping your foot.  It's cheaper then a hair dresser and better for your hair too because you aren't cutting out the healthy strands too by just cutting everything.|`|PZYOTy2Haa	my hairs pretty much the same length as yours but it used to be but length.<br>  i didn't really trim it much but it used to go kind of thin at the ends, so maybe once every 3-4 months or so?

I'd suggest something connected with your zodiac sign.|`|jprAxFILaa	Don't get one, it just make you look bad. You spend lot of money on it and it just a picture.

4w361g8Laa	I would say heels are a no. You're going to be doing a lot of standing up and down, walking during half time and possibly walking up and down steep stairs or bleachers depending on where your seats are. Too many ways to trip and/or fall already, no sense in adding to it with heels. Boots would be cute, but the flat kind. Not sure what the temp is where you are but a light sweater (it could get hot inside the building), jeans and boots would be cute. You could wear a sweater with the color of the team you're rooting for. Or wear a cute tank under the sweater in their color. It'd be a cute outfit plus you could show your guy that you're into the game and did your research. good luck!

cwsYM2F4aa	I take my shower at night.  I use Garnier Fructis Shampoo & Conditioner.  Then I put Garnier Smoothing Milk on my hair.  Overnight, I put non-heat rollers in my hair to give me volume.  Once a week, I put coconut and avocado oils in my hair as a hot oil treatment and leave it in overnight for deep conditioning.  When I do that, I just shower in the morning, wash and condition, and put my hair up in a bun for the day to give my hair a break.  I use Mary Kay Satin Hands exfoliator all over my body (it makes skin look polished and glowy!).<br>  <br>  On the mornings that I showered the night before, I wake up and put Paul Mitchell's Simply Skinny heat protector and Garnier Glistening Drops in my hair and spray a little Tresemme heat protectant on it.  Then I straighten it with my straightening iron.  I curl the ends of my layers under with a curling iron.<br>  <br>  Mornings and nights, I wash and moisturize my face using Mary Kay products.  In the morning, I use Mary Kay foundation, Physician Formula Bronzer, various eyeshadows, mascara, and lip gloss (not picky about the brands of these, as long as they last and are flattering colors on me).  <br>  <br>  My finishing touches are Victoria Secret's Very Sexy perfume and Amber Romance body lotion.<br>  <br>  Once a week, (usually when I put the oil in my hair) I massage Vegetable Glycerine into my skin.  It is a little thick, but it is a great emollient and the next day skin feels so soft.<br>  <br>  I love beauty products and have fun with them.  It does take some time, but to me, it's a lot of fun and worth the end result.|`|zPvxaOYoaa	i dont knoe<br>  <br>  answer mine please<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkqXq_B9tL.ymNhEEs.Yl2Psy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223082132AAP8Hyx">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|7B6PxDzYaa	Cleanse with Liz Earle<br>  Tone using alpha h liquid gold<br>  <br>  at night<br>  <br>  during day<br>  <br>  exfoliate with liz earle<br>  Dramatically different moisturiser<br>  Bare essentials primer<br>  <br>  then make up<br>  <br>  Hair Ojon products, wash and blow dry every other day<br>  <br>  Have treatments, waxing, botoxs and regular facials.<br>  <br>  There is more to life than applying moisturiser though!|`|5ee0364dd7d0159e953e987902e16956aa	NO SUN ! and a scratchy bath sponge all over my body every bath time.

iUm5qWBraa	I think this is a ridiculous question!  Why don't you just try the morning shower routine & see if it works better for you?|`|TGFc2Z6Caa	Sounds like a good idea.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Yes|`|g7uMKvEzaa	It depends what you like doing better.. I used to shower at night  than I feel so nice and clean between the sheets,but sometimes I just need a shower to wake up or feel cleaner if I am going somewhere... I actually shower sometimes a couple times a day if I workout. I don't wash my hair everyday..I started using my electric curlers on it when I have time..If not I let it air dry too. If it looks not up to par,, I just tie it back with a nice barrett.<br>  <br>  To make it look fuller...brush it upside down... than just touch it up a bit the right side up.. GOOD LUCK!|`|p3GZERIsaa	no. just learn to get ore voluum with the blowdryer.. and you shouldn't wash your hair everyday this is SERIOUSLY BAD for IT!|`|AJ38Xqyeaa	shower in the morning dude it will be much easier to straighten your hair when its a lil damp.|`|7Vgpz1Zlaa	Yep. Hair always looks better before you sleep in it! lol! Duh!|`|xsaxyB1gaa	You could try it, but I would suggest to occassionally give your hair a rest from the heat if you plan to continue to do it this way. I like to change it up so my hair gets a rest from the heat, but I understand what you're saying. My hair is exactly the same way, and I find it looks better if I shower in the morning, blow my hair, then straighten it out with a straightener. <br>  <br>  Like I said already, please be kind to your hair and allow it to rest on days when you can afford for your hair to look "natural." I would also suggest using a heat blocker. You can buy it from walmart or your salon depending on your budget. Spritz it on damp hair before using any heat and it will protect your hair.|`|exVJBcGMaa	Well I think showering in the morning  is better because you feel more cleaner to get your day going but if your gonna shower at night...dont let your hair air dry. Thats why it;s getting all wavy. If your gonna shower at night, blow dry your hair before you go to bed just like what you  would do in the morning. And well if you dont wanna blow dry your hair when you take night showers, comb your hair and put your hair in two braids. That'll keep it from getting tangled and not all wavy, but it'll get curly.|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	Yes, it will make a difference. I would love to shower and wash my hair in the morning times too, but I know I would never be able to get up earlier than I have to, so I always do it at night instead which means extra time in bed in the mornings!|`|Mb2xXZZqaa	i used to shower at night and straighten my hair in the morning....but then i noticed my hair would get all gross by the morning. so now i take a shower in the morning and my hair looks a lot nicer. sure, if you have time to take one in the morning then why not?|`|aLGe7JZEaa	I shower at night.  Then blow my hair out before I flat iron.|`|7ntSRsZLaa	yeah, taking a shower in the morning helps you style your hair 100 million times easier.<br>  i cant shower at night, i wake up with my hair dry and curly :(|`|Vbdfphhbaa	keep showering at nite, just blowdry your hair bfore you go to sleep,try using a serum for the frizz and simply let it be.|`|yXGlmUqlaa	yes. <br>  it works for me.|`|BpEWyTKPaa	It is much better to take a shower in the morning. It gets you refreshed for the day, no matter how sleepy you are in the morning. Hair is much fresher after you wash them and they are really easy to style or do whatever you want with them. Why do you take a shower before you sleep? It's not like anyone looks or smells you when you are sleeping at night! =)<br>  All the best! =D|`|edpKlRnhaa	my hair  is naturally wavy and that's probably your problem?? so uhm it doesn't matter if you shower in the morining or at night it still doesn't help try bouncy vreme you can buy it at beauty supply stores..it gives it volume without making it curly..|`|qQbjgyQwaa	Yes. But be careful! You don't want to fry your hair with a hot iron. Make sure to use a thermal protection product. You'd be drying out your hair double time with a blow dryer and hot iron. And nobody likes fried hair.|`|X0CPHMkhaa	hmm... well, my mom takes a shower in the morning, but she has crunchy hair. when she does straighen it, though (tues. and thurs), her hair is perfectly full length and isn't wavy. i suggest you should.|`|tSlWyoEPaa	sure you can try that, i'm not so sure it will work but yeah definetly try doing that so it might be easier for you.|`|8iR6XOD7aa	try it once and see how you like it. that does mean you have to wake up earlier though.|`|rzm1ZDovaa	yup, why not? if that's hard for ya, try some products for getting fuller expression for your hair...|`|FVkyxQjqaa	yes i shower twice a day I like being clean

N4xd99Qaaa	Well I don't know of any franchises or salon chains that can have those creditentials. The only way to go to a place to look like a celebrity is if that place frequently caters to celebrtieis, thus Hollywood / Los Angeles. Most salons, assuming they are professional, you could take a pic of a celebrity and they should be able to recreate that look for you. They should be well aware of the all products on the market but most of the well known shops in Hollywood usually carry their own brand of products. You could call around and ask if they have had celebrity clientele. Most beauty parlors in my area don't deal with clothes but it is simple to go to current fashion clothing store followed by trip to the salon thus the finished product would be similar to that of Hollywood.

I like to wear boots with a heel when I wear skinny jeans.  It makes you look taller and slimmer.  A long loose fitting shirt, like a tunic would be cute.  The most important thing is to remember accessories: add earrings or a necklace, carry a cute bag, style your hair in a funky way.  Don't let the jeans rule the outfit, accessorize the jeans and make them look better than they could on their own.|`|hHAdA9V9aa	Pirates can wear skinny jeans ARRR!

Cowboy boots, skinnys, a checkered shirt, a cowboy hat, a pistol and holster.

I used to wash mine every two weeks but I would get flakes so now I wash my hair once a week. And that seemed to help. So I would first start by shampooing the hair at least once a week. If your already doing that, then you can apply an astringent to your scalp before shampooing. I use seabreeze and all I do is part my hair like when you grease your scalp and very carefully pour the seabreeze onto the scalp. Then shampoo and style as usual. Again, do this carefully because you don't want to get this in your eyes. And that cleared up my dry scalp issue. I know it sounds werid but this was actually reccommended to me by  my hair stylist. Hope it helps.

xsaxyB1gaa	They will never go away, although you can try some creams to help minimize the appearance. I've always heard Cocoa Butter works extremely well and is fairly inexpensive. You can also go with Mederma which is supposed to help reduce the appearance of scars, but also claims to help with the appearance of stretch marks as well. <br>  <br>  Even without anything they will eventually fade to match your skin tone, that is if the skin isn't continuing to be stretched.|`|CugCzH9iaa	You can't get rid of them totally without surgery.<br>  <br>  There are products out there to help them get smaller and fade quicker.  Like Mederma.|`|8TYWlVqPaa	coco butter or the cream women use after thier pregers|`|80Zlwifsaa	You can't get rid of stretch marks. Sorry there is no magical potion.

o57O3yMlaa	It's Normal:/<br>  ?|`|FBGMKdqKaa	It's completely normal...we are all insecure about various things on different levels and days. The influencing factors are both inside our heads and out. Don't sweat it.|`|34ikhhtMaa	Totally normal! I feel the same way! like sometimes I am completely confident in the way I am and look then the next day I look in the mirror and see a bunch of problems. I try to remember to be confident and just be who I am rather than try to change myself!<br>  Good luck!|`|kGxvT3AXaa	I think it's totally normal. <br>  This happens to me too. <br>  For me it can happen from class to class or day to day, it all depends who you're around and what environment you're comfrontable in. <br>  But lets face it everyone goes through this at least once in awhile, so don't worry you're totally normal.|`|1qKvCldEaa	It seems pretty normal by American cultural standards.

That's how most people are. Unless you're incredibly conceited, where you think you look amazing every second of every day. Or unless you're terribly insecure, where you never think you look good.<br>  I think that the way it is, where sometimes we feel really confident, & other times a little shy, is the best way it could be. Because if not, like I said, you'd either be conceited or terribly insecure.<br>  This way, it keeps you humble.<br>  You should always try to be confident though, or at least portray confidence. Confidence is sexy, conceitedness & insecurity is not.|`|VPN1qhxhaa	yes! i am shy sumtimes, but then the next day im like the loudest thing eva! i cant sit still, even though i am shy!lol
vpmT5p8Saa	basically its just a normal foundation (coloured pigments suspended in a cream base) the only difference is all the colours in held in little bubbles which burst as you blend and that makes the foundation change colour! it will turn the same colour on every skin...the reason it will blend is because the coverage is so light! and fair skins beware...the lightest shade is more of a light beige so it may leave you looking a little yellow! try l'oreal true match...similar price, slightly better cover and a much better selection of shades for fair skins!|`|p2k6F7Tgaa	I have pale skin too<br>  <br>  I think its a waste of money ..<br>  Its not 'magic'<br>  If you rub it too much it goes darker than your natural skin tone<br>  <br>  Thumbs down from me|`|aEpPt9koaa	Revlon as a whole is not a good product. If you dont want to go through the expense of buying makeup through a deparment store then I would use maybelline products.  They are pretty good.|`|L3j2HrsJaa	I love Revlon beyond natural foundation (and the whole palette). I use light shade, just apply allover your face like a cream, make sure everything is covered evenly and than tap it into your skin for about 15 seconds so it blends with it. It has light to medium coverage and it looks really natural, like your own skin. I always apply a little loose powder over it just to make sure it stays longer.<br>  If you have blemishes or very uneven skin tone and need a strong coverage, maybe you'll need something stronger. Just go to the shop without makeup and try once for yourself.
6mZJSqBgaa	it is still called a perm.  but some call it relaxing the hair as well.  hair grows a half inch per month.. so you may see regrowth in 4-6 weeks.  <br>  <br>  if u cant afford to get ur hair done that often, get a hot comb and just straighten the roots out daily until u can get it relaxed again.  it'll take a lot less time than straightening all of ur hair every day...

I also love these:<br>  <a href="http://www.flexi8.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flexi8.com/</a><br>  - Side parted hair with the front section clipped to the side. I like to use little jaw clips, but bobby pins will work if your hair isn't too thick.<br>  - Flipped through pony tail. Put your hair in a loose pony tail. Reach up under the pony tail and separate the hair there into two sections. Use your other hand to twist the tail and then pull it through from the bottom. <br>  - French ponytail. Put the top section of your hair (above ears) into a ponytail. Next, put the middle into a pony. Then put the bottom into a pony.

sojfRnxjaa	Why do you have the milady standard textbook of cosmetology? It sounds like you want to take cosmetology. Did you start taking cosmetology and didn't finish? If not, you sound like an aspiring cosmetologist, maybe you should look into it. You can find some hairstyling books with the technicals inside at the beauty supplies.|`|wlATm2aPaa	youtube always has videos abou cutting hair layers,side fringes etc|`|6pbZACUMaa	I am not sure which of today's "modern hairstyles" you are referring to. It is fairly easy to give a decent looking taper cut, ivy league, crew cut or butch with a standard home clipper set and a pair of blending shears. <br>  These haircuts consist of three steps usually performed in this order:<br>  <br>  1)Edging<br>  2)Siding<br>  3)Topping<br>  <br>  Edging refers to the edge of the haircut around the ear arches from the sideburns to the nape and across the nape. A haircut can either have a soft tapered edge that gradually blends down to the skin or a hard shaved edge that demarcates hair and skin. <br>  <br>  Siding refers to the sides and back of the haircut from the edge to the Top.<br>  <br>  Topping refers to the Top of the haircut. <br>  <br>  The basic principle of edging and topping is to first  clip the hair at the edge or on the back and sides with the clipper set to cut longer by means of guards, blades or moving the taper lever, and then clip again with the clipper set to cut shorter progressing upwards  to a lesser vertical distance and arcing the clipper out of the hair to produce the taper/blend between graduated lengths.<br>  <br>  Topping is according to the style of the haircut. A regular haircut has several inches on top with a side part. The long top hair is thenm blended to the hair on the back and sides by means of blending shears.<br>  A Crew Cut or Ivy League is graduated in length on top. Longer at the front hairline and gradually becoming shorter to the back. From side to side the outline of the top hair should conform to the shape of the skull in varying degrees.<br>  A Butch is the simplest of haircuts. The Top hair is cut at the same length as the upper sides.  <br>  There is an inexpensive informative video that may still be available for  named Barber of Cape Cod.  It teaches how to cut these styles and a few others including a flat top crew cut.  The video  refers to an Ivy League as a military cut. <br>  There are numerous men's haircutting tutorials on youtube and similar sites. <br>  This link provides information about blades and guards:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Crew_cut#Clippers.2C__Blades_and_Guards" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Crew_c...</a>

Hyperpigmentation are dark spots.  You can also get hypopigmentation to which results in white spots.  I would suggest that you seek the guidance of an Esthetician or a Dermatologist.  They can prescribe to you a lightning cream.  A lot of them contain lemon.  You can use the cream for both the arms and the face.  There are also treatments such as microdermabrasion and chemical peels that can help with pigmentation problems, scars, etc. on the face.  You will not see results however after one treatment.  You usually pay for a round of these treatments.  Try a lightning cream first since its more cost friendly.|`|2q27JSlZaa	Apply tomato juice mixed with 2-3 drops of lime juice on the face.

A smooth paste of turmeric, gram flour, curd, honey and rose water is really effective I use it regularly.

It not only improves your complexion but also the texture of the skin.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Long layers work very well with curls. The layers will help with drying and untangling time, and the hair will also hang better. However, do not get short layers as they will stick up and look funny. If find I like my hair on the longer side, so it's a bit more weighed down and has less of a tendency towards the dreaded triangle-shape.<br>  <br>  Don't let them thin your hair with razors either or it will look ratty at the ends as they grow out.

For hair type specific products check out these forums:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/</a><br>  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. However, the most popular ones are usually only available online.<br>  <br>  Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:<br>  *Don't shampoo every day.<br>  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.<br>  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.<br>  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Don’t know yours? <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types</a><br>  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.<br>  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.<br>  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while it’s drying.<br>  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.<br>  <br>  Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) It’s pretty radical—no sulfates (shampoo) or silicones—but it’s so great for curly hair.

It definately works to some degree. Don't condition your hair at all. Just use a greasy hair shampoo and no conditioner. I know it's harder to comb out with no conditioner in it so invest in a detangling comb if you have long hair. It's probably worse to have dry hair.

bhyUX6kkaa	No matter what the product it is sitting on your skin and will get into your pores. You just want to make sure to clean your face at the end of the night so that your pores don't clog. <br>  Even mineral makeup! They claim that you can sleep in it but I, as a makeup artist, would never suggest to anyone to sleep in it. Even if there are less chemicals, it's still foreign to your skin. <br>  As far as powder, that is normally used to diminish shine, and you don't much to begin with to do this.|`|gKuHTs1Caa	pressed powder is a must have in your purse for touch ups during the day. set your makeup with loose powder. if you are trying to avoid clogged pores, carry oil blotting paper (the body shop are my fav.!!). they sell them in diff. shades & w/ or w/o powder. if your skin is oily, i suggest using the ones w/ powder then using the pressed powder to touch-up. hope this helps... happy mkup!!!|`|7OtGCvcOaa	deffo.<br>  you need it if you wear liquid foundation. Otherwise your face will look all shiny and not the good kind of shiny.|`|ZAvV3WfLaa	Yeah its good, i use it & it doesn't clogg my pores & it stays on all day :]|`|Cbb0NDL9aa	I use pressed powder (Maybelline) and have very good skin.  It does come off easily though - it requires a few top-ups over the day.  <br>  <br>  I'd probably reccommend powder for stuff that stays on...but that probably means it's not as good for your skin...not 100% sure about that though.<br>  <br>  But yeah, use it.  If you're worried, go for mineral options.  I've not used them, but will probably opt for a powder version of one soon.  x|`|00bf7069da8dc56516b179f42730c38faa	Yeah i always wear it to keep my foundation on and to help cover imperfections|`|tIH5XEUhaa	pressed powder is good but unless you have very shiny oily skin i wouldn't wear a lot of it. <br>  <br>  if you are worried about it clogging your pores try using a primer (available from most beauty/cosmetics brands) underneath your foundation that way it wont block your pores. <br>  <br>  if your worried about it not coming off (which it does) invest in a good cleanser like a gel formula etc. or you could try the new neutrogena wave which is really efficient  at removing makeup oil and dirt. <br>  <br>  hope it helps, <br>  Becky xXx

2ZsRAxkuaa	Get it done with a curved barbell, and don't wear eye make-up or look at the needle. Scary. <br>  But you won't go blind, unless your piercer is completely incompetant and stabs you in the eye. Infections just hurt. It would be a very rare thing for it to be that serious and travel so much that you went blind. You'd have of taken the jewellery out for that (which you shouldn't, even if theres an infection and your doctor tells you to)<br>  <br>  Clean it twice a day with saline or sea salt soaks. And don't fiddle with it.<br>  Alot of eyebrow piercings reject, but theres not much you can do to stop that. I have a scar, but noone notices.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Your piercer will tell you all you need to know about healing time and care.  However, since this is a surface piercing, it will "grow out" eventually and will leave a scar.  Even if you take it out before it starts to "grow out", you will probably still have a scar.  I had mine done 12 years ago and only kept it in for 6 months or so, and I still have a scar.|`|os1ydh2daa	DONT DO IT! i had mine pierced for a year and 1, the scar will never be able to be covered up when you take it out, hair will not grow over this piercing, and 2 when i took mine out a chunck of skin came out with it and now 4 years later the whole is still there and looks terrible! just a little advice i wish someone had given me! but fyi you are supposed to clean it 3 times daily and not change it out for 7-8 months! GOOD LUCK!|`|gI14gMH3aa	There are always risks for everything. The thing is are you willing to take the risk. I pierced my lip 2 weeks ago, the swelling is barely goin down and it hurt a lot. Especially when i'd eat and get a hold of the back of the piercing and tug it with my teeth. It's pretty annoying, i think i might take it out, but who knows. Your eye brow might be more painful because of the more sensitive area. I'd clean it about 3-4 times a day.  I think you'd be ok if they don't hit a vein. Ask the piercer before going through with it, so that way you have time to think about it.|`|2c10ae9d03edf5d663e295c5fc61a2caaa	Don't do it i have alot of piercings and that's the only one i regret after i took it out it left a scar and everyone that i know that had it done regret it get something else pierced|`|OOYc7Mbfaa	Don't.  Why?
4w361g8Laa	Your straightener is probably too hot and actually burning your hair, which would cause a bad smell. If possible, turn the heat dial (if you have one) down a bit on your flat iron. Do as someone else said and use a heat protectant spray after you shower and before you blowdry.DO NOT spray perfume on it. There is a lot of alcohol in perfume (which is why is evaporates so quickly on your skin) and that will dry the heck out of your hair.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Get a heat protector that smells good.

Places with good pricing and nice work vary from artist to artist.  Indelible Ink is good and they have one location in Denver and one in Arvada.  Brave New World does ok work from what I have seen, but they are too expensive for what they are.  Mantra and Sinfulltration aren't bad places either and Mantra has really good rates for large pieces, so they should be equally as good on the pocketbook for smaller ones.  I can actually give you a few places to stay away from more than anything.  New World or Old World tattoo does shoddy work and shoddy piercings as well (I got my wrists done there and they have to be redone) and Celebrity is a great place for piercings, but tattoos are a different story.  All in all, make sure you check an artists portfolio and if they do good work then a simple tattoo will turn out perfectly!  Good luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Think Tank is a great place with some great artists, however they have close to a 2 year waiting list from what I'm told and only do piece work.|`|dIhP8MBuaa	The Tattoo Artists Grotto :D

6mZJSqBgaa	There is nothing you can do about having thick hair, besides having a hair dresser cutting it a certain way to make it appear thinner.<br>  <br>  If you have wavy hair, you can get your hair relaxed.  It's basically a perm ..but without the rollers to make your hair curly.  You can do it yourself, or have it done at a salon.  <br>  <br>  But i have thin straight hair... and it's VERY flat looking! I'd love to have your wavy, thick hair...  Just for a day!<br>  <br>  Go figure!|`|xieiM0FRaa	Ask whoever cuts your hair next to layer it or thin it. That'll solve the thickness. To get it straight, use a flat iron. Try to get a tourmaline one, if you can, because they're not as damaging to your hair, and remember to use a heat protectant or else you'll cause a lot of damage to your hair. If you don't want to invest in a flat iron, brush your hair while you're blow drying it. I've heard that works, but I haven't tried it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|MXzIIgQhaa	to make your hair thinner, go to a hair dresser and ask them to thin out your hair. i have had this done before, and my hair looked great!<br>  <br>  you can straighten your hair with a straightener/flat iron. i have the wet 2 straight steam straightener by remington. i love it because you can use it while your hair is wet.<br>  <br>  i have wavy, thick hair, too.<br>  <br>   <br>  hope this helps!|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Hair stylists can actually "thin" your hair out for you, you just have to let them know.

It helps to loosen and soften dandruff scales. Heat a few ounces of olive oil until just warm. Wet your hair (otherwise the oil will soak into your hair instead of reaching your scalp), then apply the oil directly to your scalp leave on for 30 minutes. Then wash out the oil with a dandruff shampoo. Instead of olive oil, jojoba oil can be used. repeat this  EVERY WEEK continuously till u see the desired results<br>  <br>  Mix 2 tspns of Brandy in 1 cup of water.

oVxr5B3Eaa	Well since you have a specific spot you want it, it's kind of hard to place it differently so the back hits the appropriate spot on the INside. It'll really just be wherever it sits on the outside. <br>  If your worried about damage, well, there is not much you can do at first. It will be a metal bar, and it can wear away the enamel and cause your gums to recede. If your worried, go to a pharmacy and get "dental wax".. sometimes it's behind the counter (no idea why, it's only wax), it's used when you have braces to stop the wires cutting into your gums.. but you can put it over the back of the piecing or over your teeth to stop it irritating your gums and teeth so much. It's only a couple dollars for a container of it. <br>  Once it's healed, you can switch to a backing made of a softer material, like bioflex. You can't heal it with this, but you can switch to it after a couple months. It wont wear at the enamel as much and won't cause so much irritation. <br>  But yeah,,, it sounds like you have a pretty specific placement you want so they can't really control where the back will sit. Where it is will just be where it is but those are some ways to minimize damage.|`|e31MCWMWaa	I am sure they will pierce it were you want it to be. They will ask you when you got o get it done.

IN1oikSbaa	Hmmkay. Here's my only concern with this. Is that 1, you dont know what you want to get and 2, you have to live with it. <br>  <br>  The most important thing when getting a piercing (especially and much more so with a tattoo) is knowing what you're going to get and being absolutely sure with it. Especially due to the fact that not all piercings heal without any 'mark'. Not all piercings heal clean. So why risk leaving behind something from a non-thought out piercing. <br>  <br>  It's a choice you and only you can make. You're living with it, not anybody else. Ultimately no matter what anybody says, the piercing is yours to maintain and upkeep. <br>  <br>  Second of all if you've done your ears and you're contemplating your lip, there's something you must know. A lip piercing is a lot different than any ear piercing. It's upkeep is almost double if not triple that of an ear piercing. It requires much more time and care. So you may want to take that into consideration by comparing how much work was involved with just your ears. <br>  <br>  Also, think about why your ears closed.

NPpalf1Gaa	For your hair texture yes this haircut would be high maintenance, but nothing a straightener, serum, and a good blow dryer couldn't handle. It looks like just chopped layers all over the hair.. take these pictures to a salon and tell them you like the cut of the hair and they can also show you how to style it exactly how you want. You would have to straighten your bangs and the rest of your hair quite often, especially if your hair frizzes and curls up all the time.. this may actually be a good cute and length for you and your hair texture because it's not bone straight and the cut isn't one length.<br>  <br>  Hope everything works out!|`|Y98y6dZsaa	u should go to a professinal hair sylist and get ur hair done there. also u should straighten it all the time if u get this haircut cuz otherwise it would look weird.<br>  <br>  i hope i helped!!!!|`|diggYEPlaa	yes you probably would need to straighten it all the time|`|5I7Ifrmraa	It looks to me like she has long layers and its cut it a way that it frames her face.

a5VUy6giaa	ask her where she got them from and how much they were if they were really cheap then i wouldnt bother, she probably wouldnt care, however if she paid alot of money then you should tell her and advise her that she should complain and get a refund to buy a real pair!<br>  hope this helps x|`|4fa45f8703aec8c3276b75266275538baa	It shouldn't bother you so much. Most probably she already knows they're cheap and fake unless she's a fool and paid retail price for them. You can tell her if you think they're looking cheap and cocky, but mind you friends are usually very sensitive about these things, that's why it's better to avoid debate.|`|jYv5wK5Naa	You should prob. tell the truth. She might be mad at you at first but in the end she might not care or be grateful that she didn't go flaunting her ugly Uggs (which is my opinion, I HATE Uggs!). So tell the truth because if she flaunts them to someone and they tell her that she's salty she's gonna come to you and tell you and you're gonna hafta pretend you didn't know and then it'll be a big huge mess.

She might just like the look of the shoes. I'd say that if you're a good friend and she hasn't asked you don't tell her. But, like others said if she's flaunting that she has Uggs or is a jerk in other ways feel free to tell her.|`|BSg9J96Oaa	You should tell her.

2ZsRAxkuaa	Hypertrophic scarring? People normally assume they're keloids. But industrial are prone to hypertrophic scarring because of the not-too-practical jewellery. And keloids are actually really quite rare.<br>  Mine has hypertropic scarring.<br>  <br>  I've heard of the aspirin thing, but never trusted it, or found anyone who swore it worked.<br>  <br>  I use cammomile soaks for mine.<br>  make a cup of hot  100% cammomile tea, let it cool a bit and then dump the teabag on your ear for 5 minutes or so.<br>  Worked for all my other piercings.<br>  <br>  But unfortunately I left my industrial too long (like 2 years), and the scar healed like that, its not going anywhere now. But cammomile did shrink it up quite a bit.<br>  <br>  You could also try a drop of tea tree oil once a day. But try that last as its quite strong and can irritate skin and piercings.<br>  <br>  You could also try emu oil too, but I'm vegetarian, so I don't know about that...|`|lU8e0VQFaa	The aspirin mask is to reduce swelling usually, it might work, won't do any harm if it doesn't. As they said grind up an aspirin or two and make a paste with water and gently put it on the bump, try not to get it into the actual piercing itself if you can. Leave it on for 10-20 minutes so it can do it's thing and then gently wash off. I'm not sure what it IS, but if it doesn't hurt and when the jewelry is in it looks ok, then you can try to get rid of it but you may not be able to. Also, you can try some tea tree oil (5-10% solution, any more might irritate it) and massage some vitamin E oil into it for a few weeks (what I recommend) and see if that helps.|`|ilRy28hUaa	hmmm sounds like a keloid 2 me

TzVdAFEpaa	Hair grows about 1/2'' per month, so I'd guess that by August (6 mo) it should grow somewhere between 3-4 inches, which would put it to about shoulder length or a little below.<br>  I don't know how much length you have with the dry/damaged ends, but maybe you should consider a shorter cut to get rid of all the damage, and start new. That way you wouldn't have to put your hair up all the time to cover the damaged part. <br>  Something like this might be cute:<br>  <a href="http://img2.timeinc.net/instyle/images/2007/hair/070607_rihanna2_400X400.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img2.timeinc.net/instyle/images/2...</a><br>  But again, I don't know really what your hair is like now, so that may or may not work.

The yellow colour is common enough, I have green eyes with a dash of yellow around my irises too. I wouldn't say that alters them from being blue essentially. <br>  To make your eyes pop, you should complement them with colours directly opposite to blue on the colour wheel. This is the chart makeup artists use. For example, with my green eyes, purple accents them nicely. <br>  So, for you, I would say golds, yellows, browns. Check out the chart to see if I've missed any, you'll find it easily online. :)|`|JfjAUr6Qaa	Blue definitely... i know many people say don't do this but light blue really works,,,, also oranges/ browns and golds look really good|`|DjoyUTf3aa	Blue.

6Xbz5AOlaa	There are some foods that can actually help your body fight off an acne infection. While some of the old wives' tales about foods and acne are utterly false there is some truth to the fact that the foods you eat can have a huge impact on your skin. Add the following foods to your diet and see what a difference they will make to your skin.<br>  <br>  Vitamin B6<br>  <br>  If you're looking for a miracle cure for acne in teenage girls, particularly bouts that flared up during certain monthly moments, you need look no further than Vitamin B6. Those who experienced acne during flareups during this time each month noticed a 50-75% reduction in acne symptoms. This doesn't cure all instances of acne in teen girls but it can go a long way to helping specific types of acne and is definitely worth considering. Healthy foods that contain healthy doses of vitamin B6 include: baked potatoes with skin, bananas, salmon, fish, avocado, green peas, turkey without skin, chicken without skin, collard greens, and brown rice. You can also take supplements that contain vitamin B6 as well.<br>  <br>  Vitamin A<br>  <br>  When it comes to healthy skin, vitamin A is one of the necessary ingredients. If you include foods that are rich in vitamin A in your normal diet you should begin to experience clearer skin along with fewer and less severe acne outbreaks relatively quickly. Some have found that including more Vitamin A in their diets have no only diminished existing acne problem but also aided in removing or lessening existing scars.<br>  <br>  Foods that are excellent sources of Vitamin A include carrots, leafy green vegetables such as broccoli, kale, spinach, peaches, and apricots. It is important to note that taking vitamin A supplements is not always advised. Consult with a physician and follow his or her advice carefully if you choose to take vitamin A supplements because these supplements can lead to serious problems including severe birth defects.<br>  <br>  Low-Fat Vegetarian Diets<br>  <br>  Testosterone is a major culprit when it comes to stimulating sebaceous gland production - especially in times of stress. This is one of the primary reasons that men have a tendency to develop acne during stressful times. Meat often contains hormones that alter the natural hormone production in the body and may cause the body to produce extra hormones in search of balance. Excess hormone production can lead to clogged pores as a result of these excess hormones. Women who eat a lot of meat are also more likely acne, especially if the meat is injected with steroids.<br>  <br>  As you can see there is more to food related acne problems than eating the wrong foods.

If you are going to go through the expense and pain of getting a tattoo you should at least try to come up with an idea that a million other people dont allready have.

In the U.K it would probably be around 30 pounds, or 60 dollars.<br>  <br>  But just a tip- think it through before you get a star, you'll probably get bored of it as everyone has them?<br>  (I wouldn't know, I don't have any tattoos but everyone I know who does got a star) xx|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	I would say $50-$75.<br>  <br>  I got one 2" X 2" 5 years ago and it was $150.

I would cut it into a short hairstyle maybe not a pixie, I would explore other options. If your hair is thin then Yes do it into a pixie hair cut. But if its thick then its a NO, you want your hair to look like a fro... You have to cut all the damage stuff off and take care of what is on top or your head. When dying your hair from blonde to black never go back to blonde just grow it out and then cut it. When you try dying it back to blonde you damage your hair.

IN1oikSbaa	H2Ocean. A solution to piercing problems. Tis love. I swear. <br>  <br>  Also, it may be irritated/dried out due to over cleansing; both outside and in. Try to refrain from using mouthwash more than 2-3 times a day. That kills both good and bad bacteria in the piercing. H2Ocean is a nice 'refresher/moisture' spray that I use when mine starts to get a little fussy. Just a quick spray and it tends to calm down. I carry the little bottle along with me just for that reason. <br>  <br>  H2Ocean has both a mouthwash and a spray, personally I use the spray since I've already got a good mouthwash, but it's all in preference. <br>  Also, when you're in the shower and cleaning it with soap, dontdontdont leave the soap on for anymore than 25 seconds. That'll irritate it a bit too. <br>  <br>  Just soak your lip in a warm (not horridly HOT) sea salt soak for about 10 minutes twice a day. Make sure it's warm but not uncomfortably hot. The heat from the soak'll draw out all the bacteria and nasty gunk/puss, ect from your piercing and it'll slowly clean it out. <br>  <br>  Just be sure to soak twice a day for 5-10 minutes with a less salty solution than normal. <br>  <br>  But here's a few other alternatives if you'd like to try these.  <br>  <br>  Acceptable Healing Aids and Products<br>  <br>      * Tea Tree Oil - This soothing liquid cools and refreshes an irritated piercing. Use only high quality tea tree oil that has been diluted with distilled water.<br>      * Emu Oil - A universal healing product that has been discovered to also produce exceptional results when healing a piercing.<br>      * H2Ocean - Although some would call it "glorified saline solution," most do report excellent healing results with this product.<br>      * Saline Solution - Less expensive and more readily available than most other products, saline solution is very effective in soothing and healing a new piercing. It's also an acceptable substitute for sea salt soaks.<br>  <br>  Do NOT Use:<br>  <br>      * Hydrogen Peroxide - Hydrogen peroxide kills bacteria, but it also kills the white blood cells attempting to heal your piercing. It can cause irritation and lengthen overall healing time.<br>      * Rubbing Alcohol - Alcohol will dry the skin and irritate the raw piercing, which could actually lead to infection.<br>      * Glyoxide - This is a product that contains hydrogen peroxide and hinders healing rather than aiding it.<br>      * Ear Care Solution - Solutions that are provided by jewelry boutiques and department store piercers usually contain alcohol, hydrogen peroxide and other harmful chemicals that only aggravate a new piercing.<br>      * Ointments - Antibacterial ointments or similar products only clog pores and/or kill good cells trying to heal the piercing.<br>  <br>  Using alcohol of any sort can horridly dry out the piercing and cause scarring. <br>  Good luck and I hope you enjoy your piercing! (=|`|M7H6QMJQaa	Get some sea salt, the kind without iodine. Warm up about half a cup of water (warm not hot, a little warmer than your body) and start with a teaspoon of the salt and mix it in. Your goal is to create a solution that is about as salty as tears. Add more salt if needed until you get the right saltiness. If it gets too salty just start again. If you use iodinized salt or make it too salty it will irritate the skin, make it red and make the dryness worse Put the solution in a shot glass full up and hold it on your piercing to soak it or you can soak a cotton ball until soppy wet and hold it on your piercing. This should release the dry skin and ease any discomfort. Do this 1 to 3 times a day as needed until completely healed.|`|mx7FINY8aa	Ok First Thing DO NOT Put Salt Water On It !! Or anythingg like That !<br>  Dont Use Mouth Wash For A Whilee As IT Will irritate It......<br>  Theres not much you can do for and infection maybe some herbal solution or something go to the place where you got it pierced get some advice on it x<br>  Itl be fine in a week or so just dont over clean it it will dry it outt xxx<br>  <br>  Good Luck With Itt xxxxxxxx<br>  P.S I Have One too They Look Totally Hot :D xxx|`|lU8e0VQFaa	My piercer suggested a little Vitamin E oil for some major dryness and irritated nape piercing I have. It took a few days but it looks great now. Try that at night before you go to bed, stick a band aid over it to keep it on all night. Also, make sure you keep any cleanser, make up acne creams or anything else far away from the piercing site, this will only aggravate the problem. Are you using sea salt soaks? More than 2-3 times a day? If yes to either stop, and just do the simple soaks, that should also help since it's very gentle.|`|2NDGt4e2aa	have tired some good old H2O that is what i put on my when it was a lil dry and you can use mouthwash for the infection it just has to be the no alcohol kind.
rVyDgVt4aa	Yes.  Make sure you buy some fray block to put around the area that you cut off so the lace will not fray.  You will not mess the wig up but if you feel uncomfortable doing that call your vendor to see if they will do it for you or will exchange it for a smaller one.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Why do you have a wig|`|d6c5091f4ae22232c337d5a7245302feaa	Call where you bought it and ask them.|`|ykZtnI88aa	fashion-<br>  <a href="http://kotke.info/" rel="nofollow">http://kotke.info/</a><br>  fashion-<br>  <a href="http://kotke.info/" rel="nofollow">http://kotke.info/</a><br>  fashion-<br>  <a href="http://kotke.info/" rel="nofollow">http://kotke.info/</a><br>  fashion-<br>  <a href="http://kotke.info/" rel="nofollow">http://kotke.info/</a>

Ddfff5psaa	That age group should just stay away from American Eagle, Hollister, Abercrombie, Aeropostale, Forever21, Charlotte Russe, and any trendy young store.

lU8e0VQFaa	God I *HATE* benzyol peroxide, since you hadn't used it in a while your skin can't handle it any more and as such is really irritated and angry at you. My best suggestion would be to use a really good moisturizer and let it calm down on it's own, a cool ice mask at night should also help. The problem with things like this is since it's already irritated, the more you do the more you'll just piss your skin off. It shouldn't last more than a couple of days, maybe 4 at the most (and NEVER use that product again). You can also try a pale green conceler to cover it, the green will cancel out the redness but use sparingly, or you'll look sea sick instead of pink. But as hard as it may be to look at, the less make up you put on the better.<br>  <br>  In the future if you need a zit cure, try some neosporin and a band aid over night, it works wonders and won't leave you looking like a lobster.|`|RKZHGqh7aa	Soak facecloths in icy water and lay them on your cheeks.|`|UdiJDouhaa	First stop using that gel, it may be expired, or just gone bad. <br>  You should try to use some mild daily exfoliants, and a nourishing, soothing masque.<br>  Don’t use any cream/lotion on your face, so your skin pores are not blocked. <br>  I use Neutroslim Daily Exfoliants. It help my acne problems.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Clinique has a product that helps reduce redness!
7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Get a clean washcloth.  Run it under very warm water. (As warm as you can take it.)  Then hold in on the pimple for a while.  Keep repeating.  The warm compress actually helps *reduce* the redness and swelling.  (I know it seems like it should have the opposite effect, but it doesn't.)<br>  Don't squeeze it before it's ready to be squeezed.  That just makes it worse.|`|4E07Ejkiaa	I usually lance it with a sterilized sewing needle and then rub hydrogen peroxide on it to cleanse the area. I'm sure that's probably not the best way to handle a pimple, but sometimes it hurts so bad, I just have to relieve the pressure.|`|2WYpXY2Yaa	God i hate them, they're painful. Okay i know this may seem weird but its the only thing i have found that works. Keep going to pop it until i little of the skin or broken. Put antiseptic cream over it, and i mean so much that it looks like a white blob on your face, wait a couple of hours (it probably will wear off by then) but if it hasn't rub it in. Then before you go to bed put another blob on there. It will take it down the next morning and probably stop it from getting any worse. But problem being it only works on under skin spots. Good luck!.|`|TJuzo4Lraa	dude, i am not sure what a guy should do with this zits stuff but for women, only birth control pills work!! So I dunno then~|`|kjcybCOvaa	get over it hun your going to get them sallll ur life.
4E07Ejkiaa	The older you get, the less elasticity your skin has. That is why your pores seem to be more open. I usually rub some ice over the area after I extract and it helps the pore to tighten.|`|8ENRWmoMaa	wash your face after you push the crap out.  or use an astringent after.|`|hQGxAYZdaa	they have a lot of pore tightening creams and face washes you can get. go to the store and check it out, or if you want further assistance, go to a dermatologist.|`|gGg5fRHBaa	Hold a cold wet flannel to it and press. This should close the pores.
djhCah5Maa	I can't remember the exact product, but it had two shades of bronzer and a pink highlighter.  I didn't think it was any different than cheap bronzers by Bonnie Bell or something like that.  I haven't not tried anything else though.  The rest of the products look interesting.|`|BvjPU3wkaa	I'm a big fan of Benefit products.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend the following:<br>  - Boi-ing.  Best concealer ever, it's incredible.<br>  - Erase Paste.  Another concealer but this one is perfect for hiding dark circles.<br>  - High Beam<br>  - High Brow.  Some might consider this a waste of money but I consider it a staple.<br>  - FY Eye. An excellent primer that really neutralizes your eyelid.<br>  - all of their boxed powders<br>  - Get Even Pressed Powder<br>  - Brow Zings<br>  - Posie Tint<br>  <br>  I don't think that there's anything that I would suggest you absolutely stay away from.  I think some things are overpriced, like their lipglosses, eyeshadows, and lipsticks, but if there's a colour you love then you should have it and not worry about the price so much.|`|BkzQ3kJQaa	I use/tried quite alot of benefit makeup and to be honest it isnt really that great. But the mascara is really good and makes your lashes look amazing if applied correctly. The foundation isnt that great and it can sometimes make your skin/nose area look shiny. The blushes are good though, but i dont reccomend using the blusher brushers.Also i bought the 'Talk to the tan' recently too and it made my face look dirty and greasy which was a disapointment seeing as it cost me around ￡20 .. but i think all of the benefit products are over-priced. Hope this helped. :)|`|F57mAkXZaa	the she-lac is amazing!!  i used it at my wedding in jamaica to keep my makeup from running and as a test, i put a full face on and then the she-lac and went on a full day excursion of climbing a waterfall and snorkling and swimming and still had makeup on at the end of the day!!!!<br>  <br>  and i LOVE the lip-plump its a plumper and a toner in one.<br>  the hollywood glow is a must have for a highlighter and overall soft glow.  it's expensive but at my store if you purchase $60 you get a free eyebrow shaping.|`|tfeNOjt0aa	I reallyy like benefit! they recently opened up a boutique in my town over the summer, and I've gone there soo many times since then. I do agree that many of their products are pricey, probably even over expensive, but most of it is high quality, so that's good. <br>  <br>  I have most of their Box-O-Powders, which i absolutely love! They come in cute little boxes, and they're blush or bronzer, etc. Currently, my three favorites would be Hoola (bronzer), Coralista (blush), and Georgia (peachy blush). I would definitely recommend any of the B.O.P, you just have to find the right one...or all of them hahaha. All of them are amazing!<br>  <br>  I also have Boi-ing, one of their concealers, which is great! I originally went there to get Erase Paste, another concealer, but the woman advised that I purchase Boi-ing instead, since it matched my skin tone better. And she didn't just tell me that to spend more money, because Boi-ing was alot cheaper anyway, which was awesome!<br>  <br>  I have benetint, posietint, and the benetint lip balm thing. And out of all of those, i prefer the lip balm the bestt. Benetint and Posietint are cute, and they work for both my lips and cheeks, but I like how the lip balm serves two purposes for my lips, moisturizer and tinter. <br>  <br>  Of all their products that I own, my least favorite would be You Rebel or Some Kind of Gorgeous. I LOVE the idea of both of them, and even though they aren't my favorite, they're useful. The only problem i have with them, is that they can make your face look oily and shiny. So I have to put alot of powder over it, which can rub off my skin easily. You Rebel is the tinted moisturizer and Some Kind of Gorgeous is the foundation faker.<br>  Overall, i lovee benefit cosmetics!|`|pTBlxv7Taa	I LOVE BENIFIT! they have awsome mascara and try the dr feel good its awesome!!
7aYaOUtiaa	Um split your fringe [[however long]] in half, and clip them up with some funky clips. then you would curl or straighten the bottom bit. :) Simple, easy and cute. :) x Good luck.|`|p2ILs22kaa	Okay my hair is sort of similar to yours. This is a style that looks really cute.<br>  <br>  Ok take 2 long strands of your hair at the side of your head round your face. Not a massive bit but a small bit that you can fit between 2 fingers. Then plair or twist both bits of hair then pull them round to the back of your head. Then tie them at the back of your head. It looks really cute and i probably havent described it very well. But it can sometimes look a bit like a cute crown and really flatters your face. Sorry i can't find a picture right now lol!<br>  <br>  x|`|Sr4u5skgaa	Why not use straightners to straighten your hair or curl it slightly so you have a few ringlets. Or put a clip in your hair so you have some up and some down, so the hair is behind your ears.

XTAHDPDXaa	I have the same problem with jeans, I can never find a pair that fit right. Surprisingly though, I found a few pair of jeans at forever21 and they are my FAVORITE jeans, they fit perfect and I always get compliments on them when I wear them, and they were only 12.50! Plus, they are in really good shape, I've had them for more than 6 months and they're still in perfect condition. Also, try pac sun; they have bullhead brand which also fit me, personally, great. They have deal that is 2 pair for 55$.|`|VPN1qhxhaa	i'm not sure but nearly no jeans fit me right except for river island jeans, so you couldtry i guess. it depends what size you are|`|k10aY5M3aa	I agree with the person above. i think old navy, gap, and all of their affiliates make jeans that are too big. try forever 21 and pacsun|`|AA11471519	Try out at amazon or ebay.

Twq7efhQaa	One of the best and the easiest way of getting rid of static in your hair is by lightly running a dryer sheet over your head. Divide your hair into sections and taking one of the sections, run the sheet from the scalp to the bottom of the strand. After stroking a section this way several times, move on to another sections and like this, cover all the hair. <br>  One of the basic reasons of static hair is dryness. In such a case, it is advisable for you to use a hydrating shampoo and conditioner, on a regular basis, at least in the winter months. <br>  The dryness in hair can also be cured by giving it an intensive conditioner treatment once a week or at least once in two weeks. Warm your hair oil slightly and apply it throughout your hair, including scalp. Take hot water and dip a towel in it. Rinse out the water and wrap your hair in the warm towel. Leave for 30 minutes and then, shampoo your hair. <br>  A quick-fix solution for your dry, static-ky hair will comprise of your moisturizing lotion. Put some lotion on the hands and rub them together, till it is nearly dry. Now, run your fingers through your hair, right from the scalp to the ends. This will keep your hair from flying away with static. <br>  If your hair is not dry, rather has too much of styling pro|`|1eMm2YiAaa	If you have natrually strait or fine hair then this is quite common, but an easy fix. Here is what you do: go to the store or have your mom or day go to the store (grocery store) and get a product called "static guard". Just spray this into your brush or comb (not too much) and brush through your hair like you normally do. This will imidiatly get reid of your static. It won't last for more than a day so you will have to do this every morning.<br>  I am a professional hair stylist at REGIS is you have any more hair or Beuty questions for me. Just go to my profile and add me as a friend :)|`|YCfMblTCaa	Hair juss gets staticy sometimes. Mine gets staticy in the winter and sometimes as a result of straitenig the same piece too much. Try using more conditioner. A quick fix is a dab of lotion rubbed through you hair, but b careful! Especialy if you have thin hair. Too much makes it look greasy.|`|xPoenaMpaa	What type of shampoo am i using...ask yourself that question! That's mostly always the case. Also, have you recently made changes to your hair style or colored it.....if you need better help go to a salon and ask for advice from them since theyre profesionalists....good luck :P|`|EgRbQSEEaa	SAME!!  i never knew what caused mine.. however i did straighten my hair which i think had something to do with it. I found using a wide toothed comb rather than a brush helped. i think its because less friction occurs or something<br>  <br>  xx =)|`|8GKTirG6aa	i read in my magazine that if you are using a metal brush then that can cause it.<br>  and to help stop it a little bit, rub a wire coathanger over your hair :)<br>  sounds stupid, but it will work :)<br>  hope this helps sweetie :) xxx|`|v8lmU6Bgaa	Lol i have the same problem!<br>  Mines started about last month.<br>  I thort it was for straightening it.<br>  So i stopped for a while. then<br>  it went.

oVxr5B3Eaa	EASIEST way to see a huge variety of tattoos for free is DEFINITELY facebook. Search tattoo groups..

These groups have thousands of members with thousands of pictures, no theme so you get a huge variety, no ads (other than facebook ads), all you have to have is a facebook account. I actually have about 6 groups i go through every few days just to see all the tattoos added!. And it's all individuals so it's not all by one artist or one shop or belonging to one person or of the same thing, it's ALL differnt things by different people all over the world (unless someone adds 100 pics of themselves or an artist adds their whole portfolio).. <br>  Yep..

oVxr5B3Eaa	Your limited to about 8 or 10 letters (INCLUDING spaces) for a lower lip tattoo.. You can't really get a Phrase.. only one or two words. <br>  It's usually a good spot to get your favorite swear word since no one sees it unless you show them.. something like "b!tch" or "fu**"... you could get a little symbol like a heart or <3 or a star or a peace sign. Something like "bite me" is pretty popular too... Phrases are pretty much out unless they're REALLY short. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT @xfilechick..

lU8e0VQFaa	Ok, if it's swelling take some ibuprofen and wait maybe an hour, then ice it for 10 minutes or until you think it's fairly numb. The ice will help with the swelling and the numbness with help with the pain. Before you ice it though make sure your area is ready, wipe down the surfaces so they are clean and get your original stud and clean it as best as you possibly can (even call your shop and see if they'll re-autoclave it for you, some will for a small fee). Once you've iced it enough, wash your hands quickly and change them out. It's probably not really getting infected per say just very irritated by the poor quality jewelry, even if it is infected, changing it to a better stud is still a good idea.<br>  <br>  If you're afraid to do it yourself go back to your shop, they should be more than willing to change it out for you.|`|DMhAPurkaa	You can change it while it is in infection phase.<br>  It would be good if you did so , because the metal you have in now may be the problem.<br>  Try dissolving a Regular Aspirin after you do the change to the usual <br>  and rub that on the outside.It will not burn and it helps pain, infection.<br>  I use that on my piercing and it works better than sea salt, Bactine, A & D ointment or anything else I ve tried.<br>  Everyone I asked says they never have problems with their piercing!<br>  I mglad someone else is having ti tweak with the thing!<br>  I got help myself with an ayurveda site.<br>  They have natural self help tips.<br>  Good luck!|`|PRg9UgOlaa	The nose is pretty hard to keep from getting infected. Make sure you aren't putting ANYTHING about an inch diameter around the piercing, that is the easiest way to infect it. Go back to cleaning it several times a day with sea salt water. DO NOT USE A Q-TIP! Germs stick to the Q-Tip and you will only add to the infection. Spray the saline solution on there and wipe up the extra with a Q-Tip (without touching the piercing). Good luck!|`|JwnHKTabaa	PUT THE ORIGINAL STUD BACK IN!!<br>  <br>  It's super important for you to do that, because with the cheapo studs you'll get the dark circle. <br>  <br>  Trust me, my best friend has one and it's not attractive at all!<br>  <br>  You'll be able to put an L shaped one in, just wait a while and make sure you buy surgical steel studs.|`|XaKVwjtpaa	When i first got my nose pierced i got those stupid little things all the time, i suggest take that one out and put the one you got in pierced with back in. because that one could be like fake silver or something. so take it out, and then put the other one in, and start cleaning it with somekind of disinfectant like 4 times a day. with a Qtip, try not to play with it or put your hands on it. dont worry itll be fine, you just have to clean it up. :-D<br>  <br>  hope it helps<br>  <br>  also if you have any of that ear piercing cleaning stuff that claires gives you, use that it works

sojfRnxjaa	First you need bangs, part off a section in the front. Make a pie shaped parting from where your part ends on the top of your head and extend it to the end of each eyebrow. In other words it's a triangle shaped parting on the top of your head with the point at the top of your head where your part ends and the widest part from one end of your eyebrow to the other eyebrow. Cut  a concave shape about eyebrow length, or you can put it into a ponytail right at the center of your eyebrows and cut. This will give you the bangs. Next you need a jumbo size curling iron this will give you the big curls she's wearing in the pictures. Curl the hair back away from the face. Be sure to use some mousse or a styling product when you blow dry your hair so it will last and use some hairspray so the curls will stay.|`|WJX994D2aa	straighten it then curl it at the sides and at the back

Scientists claim that calcium helps teeth and bones and it may help nails to although nails are usually made from keratin, which is a substance found in your hair. Can you eat a good portion of beefsteak at  least once a week? Do you have problems with them splitting? I used to have that problem. You have to attend to them twice a day and make sure they don't grow too long. The antibiotic Tea tree can help kill the bacteria found in nails. I use it on my toes, and  also use Tea tree hand lotion on the spaces between my toes,  as it's a hand cream it would help keep your hands Clean. What more can I say? Oh yes I'm 64 this year and have very goods nails for someone of my age because I've always looked after them. And I'm a man too. Men like to impress women with fast cars etc, but I impress them with a neat and tidy appearance.

It has these really cute dresses and shirts and things for plump women. <br>  <br>  Try a couple of thrift stores. Sometimes they have designer things for cheap. Or just cute things for cheap. Wear those slimming jeans and WEAR the RIGHT size. A size smaller isn't cute, it's horrifying to the person who sees your butt crack on the bus! <br>  <br>  Wear tunics, they r cute and come in big sizes! Throw a black vest over a pink tunic and some jeans, super cute! Also wear heals coz like Breezy said they slim u.<br>  <br>  Look at big people in the industry who still 'manage' to look cute. Like Queen Latifa, Raven Symone, Jennifer Hugdens, and Jordin Sparks.

You'll want to find a shade that is as close to your skin as possible. On spots that still show through apply another layer of foundation instead of concealer, because it looks more natural. If you already have nice skin I suggest using a powder foundation for lighter coverage. It can be applied with a large fluffy brush. <br>  <br>  To bring color back to your face select a light bronzer. Only go two shades darker than your skin and make sure it doesn't look orange. Then apply it in a circular motion on your cheekbones and temples with a fluffy brush. <br>  <br>  A basic eye is a sheer wash of a shimmering beige gold all over the lid. Then line the upper and lower lash line with a dark brown eyeliner. Black looks way too harsh on most people. Finish it off with a black mascara on the upper and lower lashes. <br>  <br>  To complete the look apply a pink peach gloss. It should only be about two shades darker than your lips for the most natural look. You could also apply a red gloss for a pop of color at night. <br>  <br>  As you experiment with more color on the eyes and lips remember this rule. If the eyes are dark keep the lip light and if the lip is bright keep the eyes very natural. <br>  <br>  The look should look close to this<br>  <br>  <a href="http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/5/L/l/jessicabiel2.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/5/L/l/jess...</a><br>  <br>  I also recommend neutrogena or physicians formula for good cheap brands and maybeline shine seduction gloss.|`|qOKFuXfLaa	Face must be washed and clean<br>  <br>  1. Moisturize: I use Oil or Olay ($8) or Biore Day Moisturizer ($8)<br>  2. Apply a powder foundation. I like MACs studio Fix Powder Foundation ($26) but Physician's Formula ($10) is great as well. Use a powder brush and evenly apply on face. <br>  3. Apply Concealer. I have only used MAC select coverup ($12). I haven't tried anything else. I use concealer under my eyes and when ever I have a blemish.<br>  4. For eyeshadows, it's best you go on youtube and search for the Makeup Gurus.|`|bhyUX6kkaa	There are so many steps, and it is very hard to write it out. You would be better off with some sort of visual that will show you how to apply techniques to your face.<br>  <br>  My recommendation: the event makeup artist<br>  It goes into full detail like no other product and will teach you every complete step from the application process to the business.
AfnOU04paa	It's an elegant dress, and would look good in other colors as well.  <br>  <br>  I would try the Vogue Pattern Company.  <a href="http://www.voguepatterns.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.voguepatterns.com.</a>  Browse through the Evening Designer sections to find something similar.  Look at the general line of the dress, not necessarily the details.  (And it doesn't have to be long.)  A good seamstress will be able to lengthen and otherwise adjust the pattern to best mimic the dress.  <br>  <br>  Also try high end department stores, or a bridal shop, and maybe you could get a recommendation for a seamstress from them.<br>  <br>  Try Googling "Designer Gowns" to see what you can come up with.  Some clothing manufacturers have their staff monitor the awards shows, and within a week they will have knock offs in the stores.

I couldn't bring myself to date a girl with blue eyes.|`|PTsuqdJhaa	Girls with brown eyes have good and bad characteristics.  Many of them are outgoing and lovely, while many others are plain and boring, or mean and anti-social.  I wouldn't think of a first impression when it comes to girls with brown eyes, i look for the experience i have had with them all together.  I would honestly prefer people with blue eyes or green eyes.  It makes it more interesting to look at  lol.  But dark brown eyes are mysterious and that can make a girl look even more beautiful than many with different colored eyes.  So there are good and bad traits about brown colored eyes in my opinion.|`|eow59EaEaa	I think girls with brown eyes and brown hair have hit the jackpot in the makeup department. 90% of girls with brown hair and brown eyes have what is called a "neutral undertone". This means that essentially, they can wear any eyeshadow, blush and lipstick color they want, and it will look good on them (the shade will adjust depending on the depth of thier skintone, of course). <br>  <br>  Girls with lovely brown eyes can wear shades of purple, blue, green, brown, black, gold and silver eyeshadows and it will bring out different specks of colors in their eyes. How many blue eyed or green eyed girls can say that?? (for reference, ladies with blue eyes should stick to champagne, bronze, brown and like colors for their eyes to enhance the color because orange is the color opposite blue in the color wheel. On the same token, green eyes gals should wear eggplant, aubergine, and merlot like eyeshadow colors because red is opposite green on the color wheel. That's why they say use green concealer on red spots because green cancel's red....red tones enhance green).<br>  <br>  As far as blush and lipstick, so long as its in a complimentary range for the eyeshadows, it fair game. So you should feel so lucky to have brown eyes :)|`|Q7rUmJt7aa	Girls with brown eyes are freakin hot.<br>  What do you think of me...use the SECOND link..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkZo4Znq_1rReHbFjwFWWTXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223120558AAAJEDJ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Everyone ANSWER!<br>  <br>  Im 17|`|n9HUANkiaa	brown with dark eye make up

1xwyCxdUaa	Most reputable shops won't use a gun.  The gun itself can never be completely sterilized.<br>  <br>  When a gun is used, it tears a blunt hole through the nose instead of a clean hole when just a needle is used.

vQVAZM66aa	I guess you can mix it with a darker foundation. But you have to remember that a foundation should be one tone darker than your skin tone to even out your skin. If you feel so wasted about your money then you should blend your foundation [already applied to face] with a bit cover up or bronzer to make it look natural and not so pale. :]|`|kJ0tNA4Vaa	Lily has a great answer.<br>  i love everyday minerals.its my new found love.<br>  i also love make up forever hd foundation. its a little expensive.<br>  but revlon color stay is a bit too thick for my liking.|`|3PHYEH1Aaa	If it's too light on your, you should go choose another foundation. Instead of using Maybelline Pure Liquid, I would recommend the Revlon Color Stay Liquid Foundation. It's comparable to the MAC liquid foundation, and it's really good. Now you say that the Maybelline is a lot of money, but in reality it's not, compare to the higher brands one.|`|eow59EaEaa	Try and see if you can return it for a darker shade. Explain that you will purchase another foundation from the same store, you just weren't happy with the color.<br>  <br>  Or, you could look at it this way: Foundation is probably the most important cosmetic you will have. Don't you want to have flawless looking skin, in the correct color? I say splurge on the foundation and save on eyeshadows, blushes, lipsticks, etc. from drugstores to counter-balance the price of the nicer foundation.|`|BkzQ3kJQaa	Add a bit of tinted moisturizer. Or even put some bronzer on top to give you colour.|`|QEFPs6mtaa	go to a dillards and get ur color checked.<br>  clinque is a very good brand.  you will be happy wwith the look. good luck!

Pain tolerance can help, but, regardless, they hurt.|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	this exact question has been asked hundreds and hundreds of times<br>  <br>  The Yahoo Answers Search Bar works very well<br>  and it obviously varies from person to person|`|cjtJgKOYaa	In my experience, it's not the location as much as the duration and what you're getting done. Both my wrists are tattooed, and while they were somewhat painful, they only took about ten minutes and were fairly simple. I have an upper back tattoo that's about a square foot and took three hours, which was worse because it took so long. Also, if you're getting a lot of shading, they might shade over a previously shaded area which = broken skin. Ouch. So the area doesn't really matter as much as the size of the tattoo and whether it's just outline or if you're getting shading and color. Good luck!|`|UqOKOKx6aa	I have 4 tats, one on my left and right shoulder, back of neck, and behind my ear.  I am a big baby when it comes to pain, I work myself up before I go in all of the time.  Out of all of my tattoo's, the one behind my ear was the least painful.  Didn't feel it one bit and it did not feel raw after either, like my shoulder did.  I will have to say behind the ear.|`|6LJzt2ngaa	if its a small one, pain shouldnt be a big issue. the pain only lasts so long, but the tattoo is forever. so get it where you want it, and suck it up!|`|zBZo1idcaa	<a href="http://answeringonly.allnight.nl" rel="nofollow">http://answeringonly.allnight.nl</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|PCKyleePaa	it doesnt hurt too bad on ur wrist
LXROkDtHaa	i have a phrase tattooed on my ribs starting on the side of my boob and goes down around the bottom of it, it's kind of hard to explain but if you understand what i'm saying, it's really cute!=D|`|9f2391ebf6a1c505bb9421899963d771aa	You can get it down the middle of your back or on one side going down a shoulder blade.|`|6LJzt2ngaa	okay. so i totally posted my tattoo up, and so far no one really likes it. haha. but its a suggestion.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i199.photobucket.com/albums/aa8/monikarawr/tattoo.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i199.photobucket.com/albums/aa8/m...</a><br>  <br>  But i would go with the rib cage maybe? they can be kinda tricky though. if you did i would make the words horizontal, and split them into a few lines. but the middle of your shoulder blades on your back, with the same concept, like in a poem form would look pretty awesome.|`|3059c69d713a3b3f99a4757099599918aa	While this is the opinion of the opposite sex and obviously is different on a guy than girl, I personally think the phrase on the rib cage is pretty good stuff|`|GXm20LUKaa	I think that on one side of you shoulder going down would look nice. Or on the back of your neck going down.|`|Aojye1ROaa	down your side on your rib cage.|`|UqOKOKx6aa	Well, it would not look bad as a swirl on your shoulder.  In between your shoulder blades would not look bad.  Or, you can get it wrapped around your ankle.  Get creative, you want something that noone else has seen before.

Then you can put your boyfriends ring on your right ring finger to balance it out. I guess it really just depends on how serious your bf and you are. If you are at that level and feel comfortable enough I would say it wouldn't hurt anything. He wouldn't of given you the ring if he didn't at least consider you would were it on your wedding ring finger. Plus, the idea that other guys will think your married or engaged won't bother him a bit, as you could imagine;) <br>  <br>  Have a great day! <br>  <br>  Chris|`|WIEPISyeaa	Wear your chastity ring on your right hand ring finger, and the one your bf gave you on your left middle.  If it will only fit on a ring finger, alternate between the chastity ring and the one your bf gave you.  Don't wear anything on your left hand. :)  It makes an engagement ring feel so much more special. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|BSg9J96Oaa	I say put the chastity ring on your left ring finger.  It gives the message that you're not giving it up until there is an engagement ring on that finger.  As for the ring that your boyfriend gave you, wear it on any finger that fits, or on a necklace.|`|52bdac00d172eaaeb319c1e4ccc9e5bcaa	To wear other than a wedding & engagement ring on the left ring finger, would show disrespect for the person you said "I do" to.|`|mx7FINY8aa	Let Him Know How You Feel If You Wear it on that finger dont be afraid he probs wont even noticee xxx|`|3rjWC2jiaa	If I was you I wouldn't because it might cause a freak accident... so I wouldn't if I was you.|`|To6cfSwFaa	your finger wear it wherever you want

4E07Ejkiaa	Try shaving your armpits. Bacteria live in the hair and cause odor problems. Also, the deodorant gets stuck in the hair and doesn't get to your skin to keep you from sweating. If you are a girl, shave them everyday. If you are a guy, shave them whenever you notice you are smelling bad. Also, if you are a guy, you might try a spray on deodorant so it can get past the hair onto your skin.|`|RlZUjvFDaa	I'm a guy but I used to have that problem. I bought certain dri on amazon.com.

oqEp8oHmaa	If you're to roller set your hair, then do a wet set, your will need to clean for this, so make sure you wash it before.  Dry your hair just enough so it stops dripping, but don't overdo it, because you want your hair wet for this.  Apply a leave-in conditioner first for moisture, then apply a dime-sized dollop of Mizani Setting Lotion mixed with a dime-sized dollop of Mizani Foam Wrap onto your palm, and emulsify and run through your hair.  After that, spray your hair with Alterna Caviar Anti-Aging Styling Spray, and roll up (using magnetic rollers).  When you're done rollersetting, spray it once more all over your rollers and roots.  Sit under a hood dryer for at least two hours, and if the hair is completely dry, then unroll.  Hair must be completely dry before you unroll, or else the moisture will immeditaley uncurl.  Make sure to roller set your hair in either 1?"-diameter magnetic rollers or 1?"-diameter magnetic rollers if you want big curls.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you're curling with a thermal appliance, then please do not forget to use a curling spray. You can get Curly Sexy Hair 24/7 Heat-Activated Curling Spray or Alterna Caviar Anti-Aging Styling Spray, they both work amazingly.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you're going to use a thermal appliance such as an iron or hot roller setter, apply a dime-sized dollop of Mizani Setting Lotion mixed with a dime-sized dollop of Mizani Foam Wrap onto your palm, and emulsify and run it through each section of hair, and spritz it over with your Curly Sexy Hair 24/7 Heat-Activated Curling Spray before heat styling.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you don't intend on thermally styling your hair to achieve curls, and will just be using conventional rollers, then don't get the Curly Sexy Hair 24/7 Heat-Activated Curling Spray, as it only works when activated by heat.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lastly, when you're done, finish the look off with a really good hairspray, I recommend the L'Oréal Professionnel Texture Expert Infinium 3 Strong Hold Working Spray, and voilà! :)|`|CoTGXxS8aa	If you have natural curl in your hair, try Got2Be Curl enhancer.  it come in a green container with a blue pump and is reasonably priced at any drug store.  <br>  <br>  If you have straight hair, don't wash your hair the day of the party.  Start at the top of your head and curl your hair with a 1 1/2 inch curling iron in 1 - 2 inch sections (depending on the thickness of your hair) and spray a firm aerosol hairspray such as Thermasilk on your hair while it is in the curling iron, count to 10 and pull the curling iron out.  Spray ringlet again with hairspray and pin to top of head, grab the next piece and continue.  When all of your hair is curled, use a defrizz product such as Bumble & Bumble defrizz.|`|DEmlGkH5aa	hair spray BEFORE and AFTER you curl your hair<br>  also if you are going to your self i suggest a curling iron that is a bit small on the curls <br>  a big curling iron makes it look horrible and tacky <br>  dove, pantene, tresemme are also good products to use<br>  i also have a round have so a curling iron that is about 1/2 inches is best for the shape of your face
