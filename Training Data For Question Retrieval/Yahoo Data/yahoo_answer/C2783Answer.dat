So it's prob full when they give it to you, but when the latte cools or is stirred, the foam mixes into the expresso. You can probably ask them not to put as much foam on.|`|5ldcp8FKaa	they do that to get more money tell them to fill it up all the way or you get your money back don't put up with that|`|7sA8HwTzaa	meadia20... is right, but they will tell you that it's to allow room for the foam.  The machine is calibrated to fill your large at a medium level.  If it's not enough, get two or go someplace and get a taste of what the real stuff is like.|`|AA12221820	idk but their not sweet enough

VPksp6SQaa	Whatever you do...DO NOT WEAR JEANS!!! No matter the job, you never wear jeans to an interview!<br>  wear black pants w/ a blouse or nice shirt<br>  Just tell them the truth, some of them like to ask, "Tell me a little bit about yourself" Now, don't go too long on this one! They only wanna know the basics....what grade your in? what are a few of your interests? activities? <br>  Truth is a lot of people are asked questions on the spot that they really don't think about before the interview....if you're good at pulling stuff outta your *** thats a plus..or....<br>  Try not to say um, or uh when your thinking of an answer...just try to answer quick and prompt....<br>  but for a part time job at mcDonald's I doubt that they'll ask you hard questions...<br>  They basically wanna know if you can come on time? Can you cook if they want you to? Can you work w/ people and the public? Can you work weekends?|`|HfZeQR4Aaa	Since you're 15 they aren't going to ask you a lot of questions. They may ask you what activities and clubs you belong to in school. They ask this to see if you have time for a job.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't dress too fancy. They may think you don't need the money. I would dress down but not too down. I would probably wear black pants or jeans with a cute blouse and plain shoes. <br>  <br>  The best answer is that I really want to work and I am tired of borrowing money from my folks (parents, whoever). They get a kick out of that. Smile and be yourself.|`|0Pkup44haa	Wear something nice, but not too fancy. I think they will ask questions, so you don't really need to prepare answers. Maybe try talking to someone who has had a job interview and ask for some tips.
lIpjuMTHaa	Nice restaurants usually only have one soup and that's the soup of the day. A lot of times its Minestrone, unless its a seafood restaurant and then its Clam Chowder. Soup is delicious no matter what kind it is. So I would eat any soup.|`|VDpmh2VJaa	I have to agree with the French onion answer..most will have that!!<br>  they normally have also  clam chowder<br>  <br>  but french onion is my favorite!!|`|4de3da5babb437b65a9e55c075cdbbdeaa	French onion!  I know you can make it at home, but it always feels like it's a must to have at a fancy restaurant.|`|tq5vKKWzaa	Whatever kind of soup I could eat. Parkinsons makes it hard to eat soup sometimes|`|AA11945637	fancy soup|`|GHd84xipaa	french onion|`|ZDC81VjZaa	To be perfectly honest... I'd recommend what YOU personally like and if it's none you'd ever heard of... ask the maitre de to recommend something and too explain what each soup consists of... texture, taste... so on.  He may recommend something based on what you order for your entree.<br>  <br>  I hope you have a really great experience and remember, start with the outside flatware first... think "Pretty Woman".  Quite accurate.

JfVxCDb7aa	cooks ability<br>  freshness<br>  price|`|4de3da5babb437b65a9e55c075cdbbdeaa	Lunches should have an on-time guarantee, since many people have only an hour to get to the place, eat, and get back to work.  I'd also like to see more detail on what's in the dishes.  For instance, I love calamari, but not when it comes with braised fennel.  I'd like to know more details.  Also, I'd like for restaurant sites to stay updated.  Some have that seasonal section, but you check at the bottom of the page and it says that it hasn't been updated in two years!|`|6iRWWHRUaa	Never eat seafood on Sunday . . . deliveries are typically made on Monday and Thrusday, meaning Sunday's fish is the oldest.  They often try and cover this with sauces!

Its cozy and busy all at the same time and the food is comfortable and delicious.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	nope|`|YuYSL0A2aa	I just ate there the other night, they have really good burgers and freckled lemonade(Strawberry). Yummy but kind of pricey for burgers & fries even if there is a lot of choices for different types of burgers.|`|kKmuFi4zaa	No, because there isn't one in my area. I would love to, though! The food looks delicious on the commercials!|`|0uhRgfcsaa	yep. love their fries.|`|JWk1lKJgaa	yep|`|ce8COixxaa	Yes! It is my favorite place to eat out.

fshRuXzmaa	Try 'The Boathouse'.  There are several of them around greater Vancouver.  Best to get a reservation just in case.|`|Gsifb7uIaa	Some nice places in the Fairmont Vancouver.<br>  <br>  <br>  The lobster is really sweet, juicy and tender there. It is often served with nice wine, a helping of pasta, and if you wish, foie gras. Lobster is also fresh and crunchy.

9kMJJ1giaa	CONTROL  that is the only other answer!|`|7sA8HwTzaa	Yes, but not from bars.  <br>  <br>  These smoking and non-smoking sections don't really work.  The only way it could work is if solid walls and the kitchen were the barriers between the two sections.|`|xDdOLn5iaa	I don't smoke but I think it should be the business owner's choice on if they allow people to smokein their business.  I know of quite of few people that won't eat out now since they can't smoke in the resturants.  It's just the government's way of controlling us that much more and making decissions for us.|`|1dJoqM9xaa	O.k...it seems as if you've covered pretty much all the other reasons. How about how unattractive it looks to have a burning object sticking out of someones mouth. Or, if you were to kiss a smoker and taste how licking an ashtray would be. You get burned (literally) by people who wave them around like samurai swords.|`|30eSQJE0aa	Because it doesn't actually harm businesses.  My city has already banned cigarettes from restaurants and other public places, with no ill effect.|`|0kXlNWcMaa	yes. <br>  because it's disgusting to have to smell the scent of someone else's ciggarette while you're trying to enjoy your meal.|`|Y14oLQgbaa	The wait staff and other resturaunt workers should not have to put up with it.<br>  The smoker's bad choices are killing the staff too!

Subway's are just a bit boring in comparison.  Now you're making me crave Dominos.|`|lIpjuMTHaa	Subway is way better, first of all they have waaaay more choices. Second of all, they offer healthy alternatives. And I don't really like hot sandwiches.|`|XbRc9Hdaaa	Subway, more variety and more fresh tasting.|`|vnYYH4fMaa	Subway. Because I tend to love the taste in their sandwiches alot more.<br>  <br>  Hope that answers.|`|VPksp6SQaa	Subway, BUT only if they put on the amount of toppings you want.<br>  Recently, when I have been to a local Subway (they must have cut down due to the economy) I have been getting like 3 black olives, 2 pickles, 1 jalapeno....u get the idea...<br>  Otherwise, I would go for the Dominos!|`|0fdea5c7c4c63ee0b9a5aff838c155c7aa	subway..more variety and subway has been making sandwiches forever..dominos should just stick to pizza|`|pBu4ZGyTaa	I used to like subway a lot, then last time I went there I realized how nasty it is.

The best one I ever had was in Lübeck, Germany in a restaurant run by some Turkish guys fresh off the boat.<br>  <br>  Some I have tried taste just like any other kebab you'll find in Europe. It's all about where you go, in my opinion.
