I ride with a couple of stunters and they always ask me what I think they could do to wheelie better and that's usually my response.<br>  You looking for strait line fast or corner fast?<br>  Either way the exhaust, air filter, and power commander should be the first thing you do. After that throw it on a Dyno and get it re-tuned. That should give you maybe a few more horses and it'll clean up your fuel consumption. (It won't spit fire out the back as much)<br>  For getting better corners get good tires. I ride with Pilot Power 2CT, sticky as hell for the street and good for beginners like me on the track. Regearing would be good too, go down on the rear or up in the front to get a faster top speed. Another thing that would help your cornering if you're serious is getting your suspension tuned. Got mine done and it dropped my lap time a few noticable seconds.|`|YP6zpBxaaa	for the millionth time......first you work on making your engine breath better.  k&n filters and a full exhaust kit.  then a power commander.

JLyYjBOJaa	I don't know too much about it, but I know it can be rewarding; if you enjoy driving that is...<br>  <br>  A lot of insurance and driving and planning. I think planning is the key. There is a lot of money you can make moving such items as vehicles around the country, even just for individual people. I know a couple guys; one who does cars only and another guy who willingly delivers a lot of boats as well. They are both fairly wealthy and they enjoy it. One of them has even done snowmobile deliveries for us before.<br>  <br>  Getting your foot in the door may be a task in itself though. I don't know how you would initially find customers or continue to...<br>  <br>  Whatever your truck or vehicle; I'd buy something deisel if you're going for a lot of miles.|`|JKZ1ywB6aa	Have you seen the news  or read a paper in the last 6 months?The dealerships are folding their tents.drive down the freeway and see how many portable parking lots Car Haulers)are full of cars.

I have never seen this work out well for anyone. You buy a truck, a trailer, all the stuff you need to go on the road and when its all done your on the road all the time wearing out your truck and with the cost of being on the road you don't even break even. There are alot of better ways to make a living where you don't have to spend a bunch of money up front. The math always looks good on paper but in the end its really expensive...|`|0CkFC43raa	mike r hit the nail on the head. you need a truck that can handle the load of a loaded three car trailer, and that means being able to tow 20,000lbs. that means buying more than a pick up truck, something more like a ford F650 for example, which will run around $100k new, and perhaps $60k used. then you need a trailer, again a lot of money spent even for a used trailer.<br>  <br>  on top of that you have fuel costs, maintenance costs for both the truck and trailer, tires, insurance(talk about expensive!!), motel bills, and on and on and on. and since it is a commercial enterprise, you may be required to get a commercial drivers license. one more fun thing you get to pay is road use taxes, and they are high.<br>  <br>  if you want to do this kind of work, start by working for a company that is established, and see if you like the job. some people dont like driving for a living, and it does wear on you.|`|IICFEIE0aa	Find out what your liability insurance and equipment costs are going to be , before even considering this . You can`t just use a "pick up " truck to haul 3 cars. Check the laws in your locality
0CkFC43raa	that really depends on the level of paint job he is going for. for instance he can take the car to places like maaco or earl sheib and pay as little as $250, or he can take the car to a high end shop that does custom painting and pay as much as $25,000. the average paint job though is going to run between $600 and $1500 depending on the amount of body work that needs to be done, and the level of quality of materials the shop uses.|`|UDak8Zm1aa	I have a two tone orange and black harley davidson mustang. It was done with house of kolor paint and it cost 3000 dollars. I also had a 98 F-150 with a candy woodgrain blue paint job and the was 4500, also used with house of kolor. In the long run these paint jobs had people breaking necks looking at my cars. Or you can go to Maco and get one for 300.|`|Fw9ceETwaa	Hey there:  <br>  <br>  It depends on the condition and (believe it or not) where are you located.  If the repairs are minor (dents, scratches), I would say anywhere between $1500 to $2500.  Mayor work will be more, about $4,000 to $5000.  These figures are for metropolitan areas, if you are out there in the country, it will be less.<br>  <br>  Stay away from the Maccos of the world.  They are like fast food restaurants, mass production approach, They won't pay attention to detail.  I suggest you shop around. Ask friends, family, fellow coworkers.

9fB4rrZgaa	Hi Keith,<br>  <br>  As previous answers have stated one possible cause is the screen has not been bonded in correctly and there is a gap in the bonding somewhere.<br>  <br>  Other possible causes are the top seal sitting incorrectly (would require screen removing and refitting to replace) and also (depending on how old your 3 Series is) the side trims for the screen on the outside require replacing or the clips replacing.<br>  <br>  If your 3 series is of the latest model type I would also check if your defogging sensor works as these should be replaced with a new screen but never seem to be done by non BMW repair shops. If only I had a pound for everyone I have seen.<br>  <br>  A BMW dealer would replace all the trims/ clips/ seals and fogging sensor, touch in any paint chips under the glass, not to mention a fitment and parts warranty. Plus a genuine screen which plays a major roll in the vehicles structure strength.<br>  <br>  I guess you get what you pay for in the end.<br>  <br>  If this was my car I would return to the fitters and insist they pay for a replacement screen at a BMW dealer.<br>  <br>  Good luck with getting it sorted out.<br>  Pyth|`|HZ9qmD6oaa	Its installed incorrectly, they probably didn't glue the seal on properly and there is some air leaking through making the wind noise at higher speeds. Go back and tell them to re-install the seal because you're getting wind noise. They should do it for free since its their fault its messed up. Best of luck.|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	Yeah I've had the same problem with mine too. Over on the driver's side, they installed mine incorrectly when it cracked, so now it always makes that noise. You could use some sort of caulking, as long as you knew that it'd come off without any problems afterwards.<br>  <br>  I'd go to Home Depot and ask them. They're very knowledgable when it comes to these things.|`|2MvdB6SJaa	maybe.  might be a leak in the seal.|`|WXDyS90Naa	improperly installed im afraid.|`|UycnSRXbaa	They have messed up while installing the screen.<br>  Bmw's use bonded screens and need a constant line of bonding sealer right the way around the screen in order to stop wind noise and moisture from entering into the cabin.<br>  <br>  The screen itself shouldn't matter if it is BMW's or not, they all have to meet a certain standard in order for it to be road legal.<br>  <br>  Also, when you get the guys back, make sure you watch them do the job, they often have a habit of scratching the metal work when cheese wiring the screens out, this will help avoid possible rust in the future.

bLjGM9yNaa	If you were able to crank over the starter for that much time,<br>     the battery should be fine. But now you have drained it of it's power<br>     to crank the starter.  Dash-lights, windows, etc. have little amp power<br>     draw compared to the starter motor which draws much higher amps.<br>     So, recharge that battery slowly and fully.<br>      Now is the starting issue. There are three things that are needed<br>      to start that engine. Air, Spark, and Fuel. You need to start a methodical check to see which one if failing you. Rather than start <br>    replacing random parts on a guess, you might want to perform a<br>     few tests to make this decision. And that will come from someone<br>     you know who has automotive skills or a mechanic at a repair shop.<br>  <br>     But first, check over all of your basics. Is there an alarm that you<br>     have accidentally turned on, or a kill switch mounted somewhere that<br>     you may have triggered. Do you smell fuel, Is the air filter clean.etc..<br>  <br>     Do you hear the fuel pump kick on ? <br>  <br>     Step-by-step go over things. If your not sure, call a mobile repair<br>     mechanic or have it towed to a station.<br>  <br>      Good Luck to you..|`|9Kt7p7Vfaa	It can be either a faulty starter or starter solenoid or a bad battery. Try jumping the car with another car, if it starts right up, the battery could be bad. Usually if an alternator goes, the battery is drained and the lights would be very dim and the windows very slow. If jumping doesn't work, it is most likely the starter/solenoid. Sometimes they are a unit and sometimes they are available separately.|`|sP98NDi5aa	I would still get the battery tested. A battery unable to start the car can still operate the windows and lights.|`|UHOGROhsaa	it could be the batery but if made noiys like it should the its probably the spark-plug is messed up or  if it is cold then its not heating up so turn the key half way / to the notch before it starts cranking and u will see a little picture of a spark-plug on your dash board then wait 10 seconds or so and then it should shut of that means the spark plug is warm do that a couple of times that should work and check the gas that could be it <br>  <br>  p.s.  the starter takes more energy that the lights/dashboard  <br>  hope that helps|`|GC33G1Gtaa	If you're getting a single click from your starter or nothing at all, your problem is most likely the starter.   You can take it to a mechanic and they can test it for you.  Also, check the condition of your wires going from the battery to the starter. If they look like crap or are broken, try replacing these first.  It'll save you some money if they solve the problem.|`|jyvocceLaa	The same thing happened to my sister.  If you hear a clicking sound when trying to start it then it is the battery.  You probably have enough power in it to start up the lights and dashboard, just not the engine.  Its probably the battery AND alternator though.|`|AA10280423	yup it could be a bad starter.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Does the engine turn over at normal starting speed or slower?  If slower (or not at all) then it's probably the battery.  Headlights and windows take less amps, so they will work even if the car won't start.  If it's turning over at normal starting speed, then it's something more.  Lack of fuel or electrical.  Either one you need a mechanic.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor|`|siHN027laa	Had same problem on my truck.

I have an 06 Grand Prix and was told that I could do "pull ahead" leasing 6 mos. before my lease expires, which is right now.

If you have an impact driver to fit your socket use that as force is then directed towards the wheel.

It may even be screw in like the BMW,s so hitting them could end up doing so much damage you could end up having to get new fork ends. <br>  As for the rear axle, It sounds like the axle has corrodes onto the inner race of your bearing cage. Measure the gap between the swing arm and carefully fit a piece of wood/steel that just fits. Then give it a good smack with a 5 lb. lump hammer, not forgetting to use a bit of hard wood between the hammer and the axle end. Tp much brute force will mushroom the end of the axle and it may need to be cut off.<br>  <br>  I strongly suggest to go to the library and as for a Haynes Manual on your particular bike or look up a fax source on the internet.<br>  Ride safe.|`|1MhdFw2Daa	I ride a ZX9R and the recommended torque setting for the front and rear axle nuts is 110Nm. That is TIGHT. There are no special tools needed just brute force. Put your socket and T-bar on the nut then slide a piece of scaffolding tube (or similar) over the end, this will make it much easier to undo. The longer the lever the easier it is. Borrow  or buy a 24" torque wrench to do them up again .Get the setting from a manual or a mechanic at your local shop, they are normally happy to do this if you are buying tyres or other parts from them. The more you spend at their shop the happier they will be to help.|`|mWZ9BXIdaa	Sounds like they haven't been loosened for a while. You'll need to use some leverage. It's possibly too tight for the ratchet and might you might break it. If it's got a lifetime guarantee you don't have to worry about it breaking, you can just swap it for another.<br>  <br>  If it's a cheapo one or a good one with no guarantee you're best off buying a breaker bar.<br>  <br>  Stick a 3-4ft metal pole on end and it will undo with ease.<br>  <br>  When refitting smear some copper grease on the threads, torque back up to 110ft lbs/145NM (or nipped up tight than a further 90 degrees if you don't have a torque wrench) and use a new splitpin.|`|6FBGUpKTaa	Most cycles I've seen have some sort of pinch bolt or a device that put tension on the axle bolt so it won't back out by itself. On the front,look for a clamp held on by two small bolts on the very bottom of the fork where the axle goes through.|`|0Mj9b0Aoaa	I would suggest an impact wrench (ie gun) or a long breaker bar for more torque.  Use these before you damage the bold/nut anymore and cannot take it off.

For the most part, located and clean your throttle body, idle air control valve, and PCV valve and hose with a can of spray Gum-out. Spraying the Gum-out through your intake manifold vacuum should clear out unwanted carbon, clean your O2 sensor, and reduce the amount of sludge and varnish inside the intake(s). For better results, install Bosch Platinum single points or Nippondenso Iridium plugs. They burn more efficiently and reduce emissions, too. Also, your MPG's and power will increase!

VLepFB9Xaa	your going to have to replace the transmission, make alterations to the engine to handle the increase of power needed for the 4by4 lift kits are usually a couple grand, you can save some gas mileage by using smaller tires, but if you show too much wheal well it could end up looking stupid, there again f you use too large a size of tires you end up not ending up getting not enough clearance. in my opinion an f150 looks better lowered and tricked out. f250's and up are the fords that look best lifted and beefed up. and if you lift it you have to lift the whole thing not just a body lift. body lifts defeat the purpose of being lifted in the first place, it doesn't give you more clearance just makes the truck look higher, those of us who really know the difference call these sissy lifts. your best bet as far as having someone else do it would be to get advice and references from people in your area. just make sure whoever you take it to has a certified welder and someone with their akc certification, even better would be to take it to a large ford dealership, the smaller dealers are usually shysters, the larger dealers make sure their techs have all their ford certifications before they put them in the garage. this way you would putting your truck in the hands of people certified specifically for fords. and they warranty their work.<br>  <br>  oh and the only way you'll get quality work and save a little cash is to have it all done at once. the labor charges include how long it takes to tear the truck apart so, if they only do the tear down once and rebuild once, that's all you will be charged for.|`|4KF2cZWkaa	ok if you just have to keep this truck, you will need another 4X4 parts truck identical to yours for all the suspension parts, and a welder, you will probably need to hire some fabricators and stuff. it would cost around $10,000.|`|Ja4fg0g8aa	Well for power adders you can go with a K&N intake they run around 300-400 you could do a new exhaust depending on what you want could be 800-1200.  you could also get a programmer or chip but those are kinda pricey but they allow either more hp or better fuel economy.  and about the lift you can go to pretty much any suspension shop and get an extimate.  i just put a leveling kit on my truck which just raises the front end up about two inches and it looks great so its up to you how high and if you want to spend the extra grand for full suspension lift.  the leveling kit runs about 100 for parts and 300 with install and alignment hope this helps|`|sP98NDi5aa	You would need a transfer case, possibly even a different transmission, front driveshaft, front differential, and lockable 4wd hubs. I would guess about $4500 just for those parts. Labor would be considerable, you are talking a lot of man hours here. I am not sure what you mean by a small lift. If you're looking at raising the suspension, I am not sure what the cost would be there, but I would consider getting it don at the same time. There may be overlapping labor (To do both things they will have to pull the tires off, might as well do that once) that will save money.

When the fluid turns dark, it gets more acidic, and can destroy the seals in caliper pistons, brake wheel cylinders, and master cylinders. It can cause pistons to seize up. You should have your brake system bled out, and the fluid changed. You should not mix the fluid from other manufacturers. Get genuine Ford brake fluid to do this job. If you are ambitious, you can exercise your pistons back into shape after the change. Remove your front wheels, and gently pry on the piston until it recedes. Pump it back up with the pedal. Do this 4-5 times to dislodge any sludge that may have accumulated around the piston seals. This should improve your brake performance all around. Good Luck!|`|cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	have the front brake hoses checked out as it sounds like there collapsing.

KQhIcU4Yaa	It's not a trip recommended for an inexperienced sailor, especially solo.  It is easier to come east to west (Europe to North America) than the other way because of the prevailing winds.<br>  <br>  Either way, you're looking at spending a month or longer on the open sea.  If you're serious, start with a few overnight trips, working your way up to a week out at sea.  By that time you should know if you're the kind of person that wants to do a trip like that.<br>  <br>  FYI, Tanya Aebi sailed around the world on a 26 foot Canadian built sailboat  when she was 18 - 21 essentially on her own.  She had some experience sailing with her dad on their family yacht, but she was not what anyone would call an experienced sailor. She would have been the youngest woman to circumnavigate solo but she gave someone a short ride between islands and so does not appear in the records.  Get her book, Maiden Voyage. It's a good read.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	With a well equipped yacht> Experienced crew> weather favorable> Good Navigation> Not to hard but if 1 or more are missing or not well equipped than it's a disaster looking for a place to happen> Solo need to be a well seasoned sailor or a fool>|`|1f1b739db636626b47b02c812a40400eaa	The answer is that it's hard. Not impossible, and easier than sailing the Pacific. The key to a successful crossing is preparation. When I sailed across (on a schooner with a crew of 6), we spent over a month just on boat prep - fixing anything that was broken, re-sewing all the sails, re-varnishing the wood, careful calculation and stowage of food and water (bet you didn't know you can keep eggs unrefrigerated if you coat them in vaseline first!). <br>  <br>  A solo sail is more than doubly hard, because if (when) things break, you have fewer hands to help, and the fatigue level is higher. In addition, there is a high standard for watchkeeping at sea, which no solo sailor can fulfill 100%. That said, I've seen well-prepared people who cross the atlantic every other year or so. I've seen others return after 3 days, broken down into a blubbering mess because they were absolutely unprepared. Many people who can handle the worst coastal weather become disoriented and sick when they have no land to focus on.<br>  <br>  Follow your dream. Read. Prepare. If you want to cross the atlantic, solo or with a crew, you'll make it happen.|`|OBIOXImJaa	i wouldnt even think about it if u r not a very experienced sailor with a large boat especially this time of the year the gulf stream is very choppy!

c6b895fa8ab23ac2b2739c41d2cb4643aa	Cars that have overhead camshafts will have one of two possibilities - either they are an "interference design", or not. If they are, and the belt breaks while you're on the move, the pistons and valves will collide - big bucks to fix. If they don't, the car will stop running, but you won't have any internal damage. <br>  <br>  Most japanese cars have interference engines, but I know (from experience) that the old Chrysler 2.2 did not. <br>  <br>  My guess is your older car/truck didn't have belt driven OHC(s), so it wasn't an issue. <br>  <br>  That $700 probably includes replacing the water pump, which is typically driven by that belt, so you should replace it since a failing pump will also take the belt with it. It's hard to judge whether that is expensive or not since you haven't told us anything about the car. <br>  <br>  I'd get it done - if you think they're too high, get a price from someone else.|`|91365d1a40ff3d8ae08da3542098d99baa	it all depends on weather you have a non interference engine or not if it's a non interference when it does break then all you have to do is get it towed and get the belt replaced how ever if your engine is of the interference type than replace it as if it breaks it could cause catastrophic engine failure as far as the $700 it all depends on the time they usually use what is called a flat rate manual that gives the approximate time it will take under ideal condition (ideal conditions would be no bolts snapping off)|`|yunxzevlaa	Always check what the manufacturer suggests for timing belt change period intervals for mileage, also check the condition of the timing belt whether it needs changing before the prescribed time period for a change.|`|YkseyT7zaa	You can bend the rods if the belt breaks.

Especially if the engines in your vehicles are an "interference design"  This means that if the timing belt goes, the pistons will dry-hump the valves ( bends the valves, may damage the pistons, piston rods and cylinder head(s) ) which equates to one very expensive repair bill.  It's completely up to you of course but I did change the timing belt in my car according the recommended maintenance schedule as I would rather be safe than sorry.

JNvjPoCSaa	Just remember, I do not recommend anyone try most of what I can tell you about my experiences with one.<br>  <br>  I have owned a 2001 model since it was new. I have abused it in every way I can think of; rolled it a number of times, flipped it, jumped it over distances hard to believe, hauled full size ford pick up out of the sand dunes (with the aid of six additional people on top of my quad), used it year round (for all sorts of ranch type tractor work in mountains) until last year when it was time for lots of service such as rebuild carburetor, valve adjustments, flushing coolant, replacing front struts, service front hubs, battery mount modifications (have a warn winch and the stock battery is not cutting it).<br>  <br>  I have ridden with literally thousands of other riders on every make and model I could imagine. Most of them were faster however none of them could pull what I could or jump as far as I could (nice soft landing also). We competed for weeks and some very disappointed way beyond stock quads could not even hit half the distance and in those attempts, they were beat up (harsh landings).<br>  <br>  What a climber it is also. rack face I would think twice about climbing on foot, straight up! Love the all wheel drive (not four wheel drive, better). The ‘low range’ has pulled trailer loads of slash (limbs from trees) in a pickup bed trailer out of the trees up 18 degree climb, the engine brake is priceless when the load out-ways the quad and rider four to one. <br>  <br>  I have owned motorcycles of nearly every brand, street, dirt and induro but only a couple of Honda’s gave me this type of satisfaction.<br>  <br>  If you buy it, buy the complete service manual and follow it to the letter.<br>  <br>  I would buy another one of them today, nothing else out there has compared so far. That is partially because whenever I buy, it must be able to play and work reliably.<br>  <br>  With a dead battery @ 20 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, one pull starts, assuming it is well maintained.<br>  <br>  I used mine to teach many kids how to ride. they have crashed it, rolled it, abused it... you get the idea. Teaching them that 'when it rolls' to simply step off the high side worked. some of these kids can actually drive very well on ice from what they learned. <br>  <br>  highly recommended<br>  <br>  toad

Have him explain why they refuse to correct your problem.<br>  <br>  If the dealership service manager does not give you satisfaction, there is usually a toll free number to contact the Dodge Customer Service Center.  When making this call be calm and courteous.  Explain the problem and the steps the dealer took to resolve the problem.  Dodge will then contact the dealer sales manager.

5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	I waited there 2 months after graduation before I got a ship.   They put me on one of the old cruise ships in Hawai'i and I made maybe 1800 a month.    Worked 4 months and didn't work again for almost a year.    Got on a sealand ship the next year and made 35,000 in 5 months as a wiper, then got on shore gang and made about 2000 a month working 40 hrs a week max.    <br>  It all depends on what ship you get put on, how much o.t. you work and if you work 4 months or 12 months a year.    I've never made more than 42,000, even as an AB because I hate sitting around the hall waiting for a good paying job to show up, but instead take all port jobs to interesting places.|`|buHzPMHZaa	After graduation, you'll generally only be able to get on lower-paying ships until you can get some seniority. Even so, you should be able to make 40-50k if you can get 2 jobs a year. If you can get a better-paying SIU ship (with good luck and good timing), you can make closer to 60k if you take all the OT and get along well.

FKJaQXQLaa	The track bar and steering linkage all have tie rod ends on them.  They go out all the time.  Get under it with the front end off the ground and start shaking things.  Everything should be tight.  When you find the component that moves, it is a good bet that it went bad and needs replacing.  The clicking you are hearing are the front axles.

i5lk5eN2aa	10 degrees BTDC at 800 rpm.<br>  <br>  *Edit note: I expected I might get a 'thumbs down' on that answer. So let me explain. If you want peak performance then forget the ignition timing which is indicated on the emission sticker under the hood. If you set the timing at 8 degrees BTDC and then advance the timing from there you will find that you get your best rpm at 12 degrees BTDC. That is where the timing curve peaks and then beyond 12 degrees BTDC the engine will begin to misfire. But 12 degrees BTDC is too near the point where the momentum of the piston traveling up begins to be opposed by the combustion force pushing down on it and that will cause cranking to hesitate (kickback) when trying to start the engine. Half way between 8 degrees BTDC and 12 degrees BTDC (10 degrees BTDC) will give you the performance closest to where the timing curve peaks without causing engine cranking to hesitate when trying to start the engine. Timing that engine at 8 degrees BTDC allows you to use an OE 190 degree or 195 degree high temp thermostat for higher combustion temps and optimal emissions, but your best HP will be achieved at lower temps (using a 160 degree to 180 degree thermostat) and ignition timing at 10 degrees BTDC. Dyno test it if you want to verify that.|`|AA10276489	Auto Zone can give you info on correct degree for timing. I presume you know how to use a timing lite. If it is out of time it may not start, could backfire through carb, could run but have pre ignition (pinging), could run but stall at idle, for a few things that could happen.|`|lc1Fm7zJaa	Generally, start out at 8 degrees btdc @ 600 rpm for the auto, 6 degrees btdc @ 800 rpm for the manual. That will be about right, you may want play with it a bit after that, but for initial timing that'll be good.. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edit: Your CR number doesn't work though... your cylinder displacement works out to @ 714.48 cc and the ratio to a 76 cc combustion chamber equals @ 9.4  : 1,   I'm ignoring head gasket thickness 'cause it's faster that way. ( 4 x 4 x 3.47 x .7854 = 43.6 Cu In = 714.476 cc cylinder displacement)<br>  Which, makes sense, if you were down around 8.0 : 1 you be developing about 165 - 175 HP / 245 ft. lbs. of torque ...<br>  <br>  Edit 2: If you haven't got one already, I would recommend the Actron model CP7529 timing light...works good / lasts a long time, won't break your bank.

All cars can have their bad times but the Golf has fewer than most.<br>  <br>  I have just replaced the cat on a 10 year old Golf. that's pretty good going. It cost ￡130 from Micheldever Tyres, a Fiesta cat from them costs just over ￡250. <br>  It has 90000 miles on the clock and runs very well indeed - returning a mixed milage of about 45-50 mpg. <br>  <br>  As for oil consumption. they're no worse than any other providing that they've been looked after. If the previous owner thrashed it then you can certaily expect increased oil consumption. You should get about 8000 miles/litre at least from a 62000 mile car. Don't buy a GTi from a "boy racer". No "water consumption". I've never heard of the term "soft engine".<br>  <br>  The body shell and other mechanical bits should be almost as sound as new on a well maintained 60000 mile car.<br>   <br>  You should check to see that the cam-belt has been replaced.

Ask yourself why have the residual value of VW Golf car been consistently high for many many years. Does your mechanic own a Golf ? More likely he shares the prejudices you can read every day on this site. A good way to find out about the Golf is to ring up someone selling the same car in any classified advert. Tell them right from the start that you are not interested in buying the car but that you are doing a thesis on used cars for college. Ask them what problems they have had, what the car has been like for reliability, oil consumption, would they ever buy another etc. I think you will get a fairly honest answer to help you make up your mind. <br>  I have had many cars with VW engines and your mechanics comments about " Soft" engines do not ring true, more likely he has a "soft" head.

uL5772kCaa	LMAO, max/peak rating means nothing!!!<br>  <br>  But to answer your question, yes you can set the amount of power your amplifier puts out with the gain knob. Find a tutorial on how to set your gains with a dmm on google and just use the number that you want to use.<br>  <br>  PLEASE use the RMS of the amp and the RMS of the subwoofer, not the max rating.<br>  <br>  Oh and if this is a 2 channel or monoblock amp, you can't plug in the subwoofers AND speakers since they need different signals (subwoofers need to be LPFed and speakers need to be HPFed).

kjAWsDwLaa	Because you don't run into other houses or people with your house.  If you have a mortgage, though, it is generally required.|`|LuqZXXyBaa	Because the chances of you hitting a pedestrian or another vehicle with your car is a lot higher than your house burning down. With car insurance you're not required to protect your investment but you are required to be financially responsible in case you cause bodily injury or property damage to another party. Auto insurance is required by law in most states.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	The reason automobile insurance is mandatory is because a car is mobile. You can damage someone else's property or injure others with it. It is the liability insurance that is required by law, to cover the damage you may cause to others. Your house doesn't move and isn't likely to collide with another house.<br>  <br>  However, if you have a mortgage on a house, the mortgage company will require an appropriate amount of insurance coverage. Likewise, if your car is financed, the lender will require certain levels of coverage on it.
XLXncQu9aa	First if you see an accident and there are no emergency vehicles tending to the accident then you must call the authorities via cellphone.  First you let them know that an accident has occurred and giving them your location.  Secondly, once you have done that you must decide whether to wait with the accident victim or not. This is an ethical decision.  If you decide to wait at the scene of the accident do not attempt to move or touch the victim because you may injure them.  Thirdly, once the police and other emergency vehicles arrive, you are to then give an account if you have seen anything.  If you saw anything helpful to the situation then point that out in the police report.|`|wpgRMjgraa	This site is very helpful.......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fife.police.uk/default.aspx?page=1711" rel="nofollow">http://www.fife.police.uk/default.aspx?p...</a>

bqLvWpcZaa	Jag, the W124 was made from '86-'95.  The 300D and 300SD you're referring to are the 123 and 126 chassis vehicles and were made from '77-'85 and '81-'91 respectively.<br>  <br>  The W124 is a very robust design that Benz pretty much right, right from the start of production.  If you're looking for the M104 engine, you have to go to the '92 to '95 model years for the sedan ( or from 1990 for the coupe version ).  The M104 engine is a good engine but don't dismiss the M103 engine ( the earlier 2-valve inline 6 ).  It too is a great engine that can give years of trouble-free service, usually with just the routine maintenance recommended by Benz.|`|T6TeVGcjaa	i have w124 ,200E 1991. it is a nice comfort and safety car with manual 5 speeds transmission but without AC so im looking for 300E 1993 which is better  in acceleration and has AC but its auto transmission has 4 speeds only.|`|V5Ka1CtYaa	If you do go for a diesel model that is older than an '85, be sure to get full maintenance records for it, because the older 300 SD and 300 D models were built with an engine flaw that caused the cylinders to begin to warp when the car hit about 125,000-150,000 miles. Once the cylinders warp, you throw rods and it's just a big old mess. It still costs about $10,000 to get the engine back to running condition, so if you buy a diesel with low miles be sure to ask about the defect and if it has been fixed or not, because nobody wants to have to sink $10,000 dollars into a thirty year old car. Other than that, the 300 series are amazing cars and the W-124 class are reliable and well built in general.<br>  <br>  Hope this info is useful!|`|yunxzevlaa	I have owned two of these, the 300e is a little thirsty if it is not a well cared for example, the ones with smaller engines, like a00 or a 230 are better, but if you really want a 300e, go for the 24 valve one as it will give you more performance and would be a fundrive.a deisel would be even more economical and yet good on preformance as these deisel engines made by mercedes were very tough.these cars were practically unbreakable and a good choice for comfort and reliability.
7sRPLVy7aa	I purchased a game joystick and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 three years before purchasing an airplane.

They have the code reader that they will let you take to the parking lot and plug in and do it your self or they will help you. It is very simple the plug is to the right of your steering wheel under the dash, it has a cover over it that you just pull off,and plug the code reader into.  Just read the code reader after that.  It will tell you when to start the Jeep and everything. when it is done it will give you a number and the guy in the store will tell you what the code is. However if it is not running a code it may say no codes found.  Then I would talk to the dealer. Talking is free,  Im not positive if there is or is not a sensor in the back. I do not think so but I can not be sure.  They can tell you over the phone.  If there is then there has to be a reset they should tell you how.
KuNM2j9caa	It all depends.  Newer factory speakers are not mounted with screws.  Most are mounted with clips.  So, to mount aftermarkets, some drilling will be required.  It's not that bad.  If you go to crutchfield.com, they will tell you what fits your specific make and model.  The speakers will come with a wiring diagram.  You will more than likely have to cut off the factory speaker jack and splice in the new wire and connectors.

ZEwAalKPaa	Any small car about 15 years old should be basic enough to cut your teeth on.  <br>  <br>  I cut my 'mechanical' teeth on the likes of Mk.1  Escort and Cortina's. You opened the bonnet  and there surrounded by open space was a straight forward looking engine, everything easy to get at. Now you lift the bonnet and there seems hardly an inch of unused space and the engine bay looks like a plumbers nightmare.  I can remember on the mk.1 Astra 1200 that you could replace the clutch without removing the gearbox via an access plate.  Removing a gearbox was just a matter of disconnecting the prop shaft and the bell housing bolts and out it came.  Things are not that easy now!<br>  <br>  To be honest the day of the home mechanic is almost over, things that used to be repairable are now mostly only exchangeable and electronic items needs specialised diagnostic equipment to fault find. It is also looking as if the days when an ordinary working man with a family and a mortgage being able to run an old car are also on the way out. As cars become more sophisticated and where an electronic sensor smaller than your thumb can cost ￡400 running a 12-15 year old car will become prohibitively expensive.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	Best thing to do is find a hobby shop that still carried the Revell Visible Engine model.

There should be 3 then wires, a yellow, orange with a black stripe(or just black), and a white one.  <br>  <br>  1.  Cut the yellow wire in half.<br>  2.  Strip back insulation from the orange/black (or black) wire but do not cut it in half.<br>  3.  Put your key into the run position and put the car in reverse so that it won't start.<br>  4.  Now turn the key to start and release back into run(like would would normally start the car).<br>  5.  Leave the key in the run position and use a multimeter to measure the resistance between the half or the yellow wire that goes to the ignition and the bare part of the orange/black(or black) wire.<br>  6.  Go to radio shack and get a pack of resistors and solder them together so that when you test them with your multimeter, they have the same resistance as the measurement you took from the car.<br>  Use this site to help you find the right ones. <a href="http://www.ealnet.com/m-eal/resistor/resistor.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ealnet.com/m-eal/resistor/res...</a><br>  7.

crhJLuw5aa	The answers given so far actually WILL work, but if you make the adjustment with the engine running you'll make a huge mess, with oil flying all over the place. They DO make little clips you can put on them, but this won't eliminate the mess completely.<br>  <br>  This is how the PROFESSIONAL mechanic adjusts valves on a small block Chevy:<br>  <br>  With the engine OFF at ALL times, turn the crankshaft until the timing mark is lined up with TDC. Then tighten all rocker arms while slowly spinning the push rods, until you feel NO play between the push rod and the rocker arm. Then you turn the crankshaft exactly one complete revolution until the timing mark is lined up again. Next, go back and repeat the tightening procedure. This is because only half of them actually GOT the slack removed , and the second adjustment WILL take care of the other half. Once they've ALL been tightened THIS far, then you go back and tighten ALL 16 rockers exactly one-half turn more. Put the valve covers back on, shut the hood, & start the car. <br>  <br>  Happy motoring!|`|AA10731159	The rocker arms do not have a "torque" specification. The rockers are tightened only to the point where the lifters stop ticking, then are turned in another 1/2 turn. The starting point procedure that most professionals use is to slowly tighten the the rocker arm nut while turning the pushrod associated with that rocker arm.When the pushrod can no longer be rotated by hand, stop, and go to the next one. That should get the adjustment close. Next, start the car with one valve cover off. With the engine running, loosen the first rocker until it ticks, then tighten to no tick, then 1/2 turn more. Move to the next rocker, and repeat the procedure. It may take several times "running" the rockers to get them adjusted properly. When you finish that side, install the valve cover, and do the same on the other side.|`|YP6zpBxaaa	you'll need to find a Chilton's repair manual or something similar.  the motors i've worked on, you don't actually "torque" the rocker arms, you tighten the nut until there's no play in the pushrod, then turn the nut another 1/2 turn.<br>  <br>  "these need to be properly adjusted by someone who's done it before."  - if you never do it, how are you going to learn?

6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	sounds like you need a fuse...go to a gas station and get one. I do not think it costs more than a couple of dollars....|`|siHN027laa	Cig lighter basically only three things.<br>  1. fuse<br>  2. burnt out lighter<br>  3. loose or broken hot wire someplace.<br>  To fix it,<br>  1. change the fuse<br>  2. replace the lighter (cheap)<br>  3. get a multimeter and check the continuity of the wire to the fuse block and so forth.

Guess during a recent heavy rain and going through flooded streets, etc, water got up into the horns somehow and they shorted out.|`|18S8hkgEaa	usually on the same fuse look in fuse block will be labeled easy fix just replace with same amp rated fuse|`|aMELFGh0aa	It's probably a fuse. It should not cost too much too fix. Look in the back of your owners manual for a chart that tells you what fuses control the<br>  horn and lighter and then locate your fuse box (it's usually under a panel<br>  on the lower part of the dashboard). You can buy fuses at your local auto parts store. Just pull out the old fuse and plug the new one in.|`|MQPJ2UaGaa	The horn and lighter should be on the same fuse,check and replace.|`|GNeLxx6Caa	depends on how many tools you have. The first thing to do is go to your local car shop and buy one of those haynes books that cover your car model. The cost like $20 which is a bit much if you ask me but is worth it. It will give you ideas on how to replace pars as well as some specifications. <br>  <br>  Both the horn and the cigarrete lighter are electrical components. This means that there is an electrical fault preventing them from working. So, is probably that there is a blown fuse or a broker wire. Somewhere underneath your steering wheel there is a cabinet or a pull out board (not all the time) where the fuses are hidden. You can consult your $20 book to tell you which fuse goes where or you can pull out one at a time and take a look at them to see which one is blown. Once you find it replace it with another fuse of the same rating. Just in case, fuses are these plastic color thingies. They usually come in 3 colors, red, green and yellow and are rectangular in shape. You may need a set of pliers to pull them out. They are clear so you should see to pongs and the metal inside the fuse. If the metal seems to be broken then the fuse is bad. Also, come to think of it there are also fuses in the engine compartment. You may find this in a black box close to the horn or battery. Open it and inspect the fuses. Remember, do them one at a time. Take one out look at it and put it back where you took it out from. Then move to the next one and AGAIN, replace with same number rating. If you use the book, you will save time as it will tell you which fuse controls the horn.<br>  <br>  If all fuses seem are ok then is a bad connection. For this you need a meter that measures continuity. You may buy one in radio shack. I suggest you read a tutorial on line on how to read continuity. Is not hard but they may provide you with pictures that will make it easier to understand. Also, you need to be able to read voltage. The meter will do bth depending where you put the knob at. <br>  <br>  Continuity means there is no break in a line. For example, if you put your meter in continuity mode and you touch both leads together the meter will beep. This is normal and is what you should do every time to make sure the meter is working. Beeping means that there is current going from one cable to the next. So what you do is find a metal part where the cable goes into the horn and touch that. with one leg of the meter (lead). Then you follow that same wire until you find another metal connection. Touch that and it should beep. You keep doing that until it doesn't beep no more . Somewhere between the last point where it beeped and where it didn't there is a break or a disconnect.<br>  <br>  Another way is to use the voltage setting of the meter. For example, put the meter in DC mode and touch the red wire for the meter on the positive side of the battery (usually red wire too). The positive terminal of the battery has a plus sign. Now with the other wire black) of the meter touch the negative terminal. If you did things right the meter should display between 12 & 13 Volts. Remember to put it in DC and not AC mode. So, now what you do is have someone honk the horn all the time. You then put your meter in the two terminals of the horn and measure the voltage. If you get no reading then that means no voltage is getting to the horn. So, move along the wire until to another area where you can probe with your meter and take a measurement. Continue along until you did the voltage. From that point on the wire is good. So, repair the wire and you are set.<br>  <br>  I still say that is a bad fuse because having those two things break are very rare. Note that you can also test your fuses with the meter if you put it on continuity mode. There is a slight possibility that the horn is bad but again, is rare. Try to find the fuse first then the bad wire and then maybe the horn. The cigarrette thing is the same procedure and they may even be controlled by the same fuse. Then again, smoking is bad for you so maybe the car is trying to tell you something lol.<br>  <br>  ADDENDUM:<br>  <br>  If it was a fuse and after a while the fuse blows again (like after a week or a few days) then you have a short somewhere. This is usually cause by an expose wire touching metal or a wire that is pinch between two things. Finding a short is a van be a pain in the rear but is possible. Just follow the wire with your meter. Since you went  to buy the book anyways, might as well buy black tape. Is always good to have black tape around the house. That and duck tape but black tape for electrical wiring.|`|285b98a01876e1a83f6a503f40258aa6aa	The Horn may be fused but the cigarette lighter is probably not. There is usually a diagram on the fuse box indicating what is covered by what fuse. You may have a connector problem, the connector under the hood that connects to the cabin may be the problem, not to mention possible corrosion. Try to fix it yourself, but if you aren't an electrician, you may have to let some moths out of the wallet.|`|IDc8g5Zmaa	Find your fuse box.<br>  Look at the panels at the labeling.<br>  See at which one is label for the 12V or something like that<br>  and the Horn one.<br>  Check the spot where there at, and see if the fuse is blown.<br>  If it is you can get a whole kit for like $6.|`|8bd9a90bff1b1965c563ac670645d9e2aa	its a fuse problem.under the dash is a compartment that holds fuses yes u can do it yourself cost is a pack of asssorted fuses about 3 bucks and takes about 30 seconds|`|0qg1Ste0aa	Check the fuses.

For most UK and European cars i could have got a general purpose one from Lucas for just over 40 quid.  Not for the Carina though - had to get a genuine toyota one at well over 300 quid!  Same thing when the brake servo went cost over twice that of one for UK or European cars and there was not one in the UK - 4 were in a container on the high seas on their way to UK though. <br>  <br>  Candle Jacks' comments about the Toyota Supra are hardly relevent to a 1.6 framily car!|`|rBcC0ricaa	The Vw golf iv are reasonably reliable, Except they do suffer Minor electrical problem now and again ie , Clock spring fail causing air bag faults, Abs wires chafe or brake up inside of sleeving causing various faults.<br>  They also suffer Master cylinder failures, Failed window regulator (windows suddenly crash inside of doors) Door lock solenoids fail as do the microswitches for interior lamps front locks ￡80 to replace.<br>  However from 2002 onwards some of the faults were retified and the steering modified for improved handling.<br>  The cars don't use a lot of oil if the right grade has been used but make sure if you buy one that it has a Full Service History, also make sure the Cam belt has been changed.|`|lmPQteWpaa	Buy a VW and you will be best friends with your mechanic not only will you be visiting him often you will be keeping him in business!<br>  One of the most common brands that come into the shop with rediculous problems.

I think that's a super philosophy, go with Jap cars. They're relatively cheap, easy to maintain and last forever. Did I mention that they are amongst the most stolen cars in America?

Stick to German engineering, it'll pay off in the end.<br>  <br>  There's a 1990 Honda Civic sitting in my driveway with approx. 280 K miles on it, and it's broken down numerous times and was even broken into at a secured area by thieves. Despite that, it has endured alot since we first bought it new, back in 1990. <br>  <br>  I highly recommend that you buy the VW, its  manufacturer has a tried and tested name in the business, and very few other car companies can compete. Parts are expensive for it, but what is that compared to safety, performance and reliability? Ask yourself that question, ponder over it and see what your conclusion is. Good luck.|`|mWZ9BXIdaa	I would recommend one but the whole superior VW build quality is, imo very over rated. One person once said it, then everyone else thinks that they have to repeat it.

AA10276489	Replacing the cpu 3 times is ridiculous. What signal is going to the crank sensor ? The sensor is a proximity switch and tells the ecu the crank position. The only thing going to the sensor would be voltage so it can send a signal. Do you have pressure on the injector fuel supply line ? You need approx. 40 psi for injectors to work. If they aren't working you need to start at injector and work back not the other way around. If pressure is down check the fuel pressure switch and the fuel pump.

4biGrjPkaa	Sounds like the timing belt has snapped or jumped a tooth causing valve damage. If it was a bent con rod you'd still have compression in the other cylinders. Take the timing cover off and see whats going on. <br>  <br>  If its all ok and the timing marks match up you could have a broken camshaft, the only way to check would be stripping off the rocker cover but i'd imagine that would have made a noise.<br>  <br>  Strange that 2 places (I'm assuming they were garages) couldnt find such a major fault.<br>  <br>  The joys of motoring.<br>  <br>  I think the garage in france is hoping to aquire a free-of-charge-easy-to-fix Audi worth ￡4500! If the belt hasnt snapped, and the engine hasnt siezed then it doesnt need a new engine. It might need a head or new pistons or a crankshaft but methinks the garage is trying to pull a fast 1. <br>  <br>  Get the car home and let someone who you trust assess it. Worst case scenario ￡1500max (probably more like ￡800-￡900) for a second hand unit.

If you're lucky, this has not caused serious valve damage.|`|f60f9dd363f9ce088c134896470f9277aa	Even if you had a bad piston the other 5 cylinders would have compression.It would probably starty and run like Cr-p. if your Timming belt broke it will leave all your valves bent and open relieving compression from every cylinder which would make the engine spin quickly. But any half way decent mechanic would know that. The Audi mechanics need to elaborate, Not to say that they are wrong they have seen more than us but I don't understand how 1 piston will cause lack of compression. What you descibe is the sad feeling of a timming belt no noise just wind down, no compression, won't start. and now you need a timming belt and new heads or valves... very expensive. Talk to the Audi mechanics not the Liar insurance guy that gets paid to save the company money. He does not have your best interest in mind.|`|mWZ9BXIdaa	Not sure if these are a safe engine. Doubtful but if so it could be a snapped cam belt which would match your symptoms.<br>  <br>  First thing i would do is whip the cam belt cover off just to check it's still intact. <br>  <br>  If that is fine next job is a compression test to see if any particular cylinder shows a problem.<br>  <br>  It's possible there is a problem with the oil pressure release valve, if the pressure is too high it could jack open the tappets slightly and hence the valves meaning no compression. I've seen it before but it's unlikely.<br>  <br>  Pistons should be fine unless you've blown holes in them. Possible if you're running increased boost and had a problem with the fuelling. Again, highly unlikely.<br>  <br>  It's hard to say without being able to see it.<br>  <br>  Tbh it shouldn't take any competent garage more than 30 Min's to diagnose the problem.

Had there been no other fuel efficient vehicles in the market probably GM would have survived. The problem with GM is that they never did R&D to make fuel efficient engine and only concentrated on powerful engines (For this reason GM had been denied bail out package once in the month of Jan-09). When the likes of Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Hyundai  are on your door step with state of the art fuel efficient and reliable engines why one should buy from GM? Now a days the common rail diesel engines are twice as fuel efficient as the petrol engines. The new qaudratech diesel engine from fiat's engine division is being used in Swift Desire (Suzuki), Palio (Fiat) and Indica Vista(Tata). These giant car manufacturers in order to survive borrowed engines from rival companies mean while there own R&D continues which is not a case with GM's.

See a componant plt borrows money short term)  for raw materials to assemble what the auto assembly plts need componant wise. GM and the other Big 2 also make short term loans to purchase componant to assemble autos. All loans get paid back when the 'Unit" sells. Dealers also operate this way to hold onto 'Units on the lot and all is repaid when the auto/unit is sold. The whole industry operates around "Short term Loans". Well banks aren't giving these loans  which affects everyones' cash flow. Remember in Ill. before that Govenor got in hot water trying to sell a senate seat?. He stood up for a replacement wdw manufacturer who couldn't get the short term loans for materials to build the wdws? And he said the , whatever bank of America would not do business in Ill with any Gov't contracts because of this?See, that is why the Gov't wanted to bail out banks and Insurance Co on Wall St to free up credit and the Big 3 wanted short term loans for cash flow ( loans , that's right , with a 6% return Thy didn't want a "Handout, just a Handup".. The whole economy of manufacturing depends on short term loans to purchase raw materials to produce their product sell to the next buyer who also relies on the same short term loan to pay for componants till the final product sells to "pay Back " the short term loans needed to keep suppliers going, Freeze up all the credit and everyone from the Big 3 down to Mc Donalds needs these short term loans to operatre. Without them everything becomes a 'Log Jam" because no one keeps a lot of cash on hand to pay . Their cash is tied up in real estate and other holdings paying interest to satisfy stock holders. It's just not the Big 3 , it's everything connected to manufacturing, which if ya think about it China holds a lot of our debt and if they choke down manufacturing  in the USA what do you think would happen if we, the USA really had to go to war, like in WW11, we couldn't cause we could not supply the avg. soldier with evertyhing from clothing to canteens to rifles and all the machinery necassary to transport troops and supplies.

This is why you will see so many Mercedes for such unbelievably low prices out there.<br>  The Porsche Boxster is my favorite, it is like driving a cat on wheels, fun like driving a quick go-cart, if you will, except very comfortable & much faster.<br>  We bought an '03 Boxster (it was the 5spd manual) in 2006 with only 19k on it for $28,000. My husband & I took it on road trips from Phoenix & up the California coast to Portland & then again from PHX to Dallas & back. It was an amazing ride; quite roomy, our luggage fit upfront perfectly, while the snacks & a case of water were kept in the back trunk. <br>  We had to get new tires upon purchasing it, then our only expenses were to change the oil & air filter while we had it for the two years. They are designed so that the oil is a cinch to change, as is much of everything else in general. It was under full warranty while we had it, so I don't know how much goes wrong with them after wards.<br>  We have a friends that just bought the '09, and they love it as well.<br>  <br>  I can say from driving many cars over the years (I was an auto wholesaler) that when driving in the fast lane & wanting to pass the person in front of me, I had more people volunteer to pull over into the right lane while I was driving that Boxster than in any other car. Perhaps, it is because it looks like a Carrera from the front, and most people subconsciously know their vehicle can not out perform that car, or a Porsche in general, so they just pull over. Maybe it is because they wish they were driving one & want you to have fun & enjoy the open road. Hey, I can dream, right?

Yq2CUhtYaa	Well, seeing as you must have a license and proof of insurance to operate a vehicle......it should be self-explanatory.|`|0hSpsSByaa	If you are in the US and already have a car, you have a short time in which the coverage is extended to this car, usually 30 days.  If you don't have another vehicle, you will have to buy insurance before you leave the lot.  Normally, this has to be done through an insurance agent; most dealers would not have that kind of insurance available, only credit life or credit disability.|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	Yes, they will not let you leave without insurance.  Usually the dealer faxes the insurance company the purchase agreement and then the insurance company faxes the back the liability card.  As far as payment, is this a company that you already  have a policy with? If so usually the just add the vehicle and if you pay monthly you pay then.  If it is a new company you are dealing with you usually need to go in and  pay 2 months up front.  I deal with State Farm and that is what I had to do 10 years ago when I started dealing with them.|`|PKhhAM3naa	carinsurance.enacre.net - try this one.

It is a high performance company that focuses on BMW products. They will be best informed as to how you can improve the power from your Bimmer. Usually, when you add-on a supercharger, the rods, bearings, and rings need to be up-dated. Good Luck with your search!!|`|mwu6aJuyaa	Superchargers are not a bolt on part. You need alot of stuff to make them work properly, new intake, intake manifold, heads, exhaust system, tuned ecu, fuel system upgrade, ideally a new cam and rebuilt engine to be able to take the boost. If you just throw a supercharger on like tons of people seem to think you can do, yes you are going to hurt your engine and no it will not last anywhere near as long as it would have lasted without the boost. Don't forget you need room for the super as well, which means you might need to modify the hood in order to fit the extra equipment under there. It's alot of work, and if you do it right, It's going to cost you a TON of money by the time you do all the mods you need to do in order to not harm your engine and get the most out of your supercharger. Your probably better to invest the money in either a new faster car with a bigger engine, or a new car that came factory turbocharged or supercharged, that way you know the engnie was built for it.
c6b895fa8ab23ac2b2739c41d2cb4643aa	Yes, you can get one way rentals, I've done it many times. I know Enterprise doesn't do them, but most companies do. It's somewhat more expensive than picking up and dropping off at the same place. <br>  <br>  Go to Orbitz.com - you can enter your pickup and destination locations and they'll give you prices from multiple companies. You can even get the extra insurance if you need it, for considerably less than what the rental places charge. <br>  <br>  Safe travels!

a9JknWi2aa	I have a Dodge Neon too (03) and had this problem this summer. It was not the starter or the battery. I am not a mechanic but as far as I can remember, it was my cam sensor that was bad and needed to be replaced. And my check engine light was on too. Once I got the cam sensor replaced, my engine light turned off and I was able to start the car with no problems. The mechanic said that the cam sensor is vital in starting the car and once it goes bad, the car won't start.|`|AA12261615	you need to have the computer scanned on it if you start buying parts and throwing at it right now then you may wind up spending a lot of money on it that it doesn't need,its very true there's a lot of sensors that wold cause that,but have the scan done before you buy anything for it,it will save you money,at least have a shop diagnose it for you then you can do the repair ,guess work can cost you a small fortune on parts,good luck.

But once you are sure you have everything removed and just need to separate, you need to get something like a putty knife to work in there around the bottom.  You could also try jacking the tranny up to see if that gets it apart.

A lot of folks change their own oil because it is not too difficult while others will go to have done for them. Truly the only basic things you will need to know beside the obvious (how to start it, what type of gas to use etc) is the cars maintenance schedule. It is good to know when to get oil changes, when to rotate tires, when to get tune ups or whatever else is needed. Whether you want to do those things yourself or have someone do them for you, knowing when to do them is important.|`|HZ7CNcbWaa	Some people should know nothing about cars, and are doing the world a favour by staying far away from vehicles.<br>  <br>  For people who do drive though, the knowledge required can be divided into two parts;<br>  <br>  1) Vehicle operation and safety;<br>  Before driving, you should have an understanding of a vehicles features and how they work.  This can be found in the vehicles "Owner's Manual". Areas of particular interest should concern the controls and their use (adjustable mirrors, cruise control, radio, gearbox, etc), basic maintenance and upkeep (fluid levels, tire pressure,etc.), safety appliances (lights, horn wipers, restraints, etc.,)<br>  <br>  2) Road usage safety;<br>  Before driving, you should have a working knowledge of road rules, traffic laws, and customs and courtesies.  These can be found in the drivers handbooks published by just about all jurisdictions that issue drivers licenses.<br>  <br>  An excellent and cost effective source for both types of information is a drivers-ed course, from an established and reputable driving school.|`|4LZY5eOQaa	where the key goes and how to drive it
TSAl7ZX1aa	The scooter engine position and method of final drive to the rear wheel is the defining variation. Most modern small scooters will have the engine positioned above and just in front of the rear wheel with direct drive from the CVT (continuously variable transmission – this equates to automatic). The engine forms an integral part of the frame (not all motorcycles use the frame as a structural member).<br>  <br>  Many, but not all, scooters will have a 2 stroke engine which is now rarer for motorcycles. A 2 stroke engine is capable of being more powerful than a 4 stroke engine of equal displacement because they make power on every second stroke of the piston (rather than 4th), this also makes them generally noisier than a 4 stroke.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	On a scooter, the engine is at the back, below the seat.

The cluth has to high of a falling point making it inapropriate for throttle blipping on downshifts. Transmission gear ratios are bad. If it's an automatic, the torque converter does not lock up fully (note that all German cars do and on ontime especially when you select Sport mode)<br>  <br>  - Steering is sloppy and you cannot feel the road well enough. It feels as if the steering wheel is not even connected to the rest of the steering system.

N4IvZmPiaa	As someone who has been in the propane business for 20 years, let me say this..If propane wasn't a safe fuel to use, we wouldn't have it in homes, RV's or anywhere else! Propane is a safe, economical fuel! Just like a lot of other things people get hurt using, or are dissatisfied with, it is usually due to a lack of proper understanding and especially RESPECT. You don't need to be afraid of propane, but you better give it the RESPECT it deserves or you will have problems!<br>  <br>  First of all...No offence to your Uncle, but have a professional inspect the entire system before you use it. They are trained and know exactly what they are looking at. They will use specialized tools to verify that the correct gas pressure is going to each appliance and they are burning correctly. You should have a CO detector in any space, house or RV, where a fuel burning appliance is, to be sure you are safe.<br>  <br>   If the system is properly inspected and maintained in good order you will not go BOOM! Enjoy your RV and your Getaways!|`|7QokEj1kaa	I'm scared of the explosion risk myself, plus cooking on gas appliances sucks in my opinion, cakes, biscuits burn on bottom yet don't cook too good on top, cooking times on packaging won't work since it does it so quickly, and water boils from mac n cheese or soups (evaporates, because turning down gas RV stove puts the flame out but hisses instead of varying properly)<br>  <br>  The thing i don't like most is the risk of CO poisoning from the furnace, the amount of gas used is costly, plus even today's RVs (and esp those built in the 1970s) use matches to light. ever since my great grandmom had her Hotpoint blow up from simply trying to light the oven i haven't felt confident to throw matches at gas-anything.<br>  <br>  I would either avoid winter camping (winters here are too cold to use propane anyways it gets into single digits and propane gets eaten alive in a day or two) or try using a safe heater to heat with and turn it off during the day or when you're out. my travel trailer caught fire because i left a heater on to keep it warm as i left, but i don't understand how but the risk is there both ways. but it's better than exploding.<br>  <br>  Or use gas stoves outdoors, like propane camp stoves that way if it blows it won't destroy everything. plus there's more air to ventilate with outside, no risk of CO poisoning|`|cOJyoXEhaa	Have your uncle check the complete system for leaks and check the exhaust of all appliances.

Helicopter flights are usually at very low altitude, and short of cutting directly across an approach path or something similar, they won't necessarily produce conflicts.  Helicopters can move around the airport without any need to affect any other incoming or departing traffic.  Normally fixed-wing aircraft will take priority over helicopters because the former cannot hover whereas the latter can, so if the paths of a helicopter and 747 conflict, the 747 will have the right of way.|`|bxlYleZkaa	They are governed by the same air traffic control regulatons as any other aircraft.|`|aBJDqwq6aa	Depends on the airspace in which the airport is located.<br>  Class E. Yes<br>  Class D- No, they must establish communication with ATC<br>  Class C- No, they must be in 2-way radio communication with ATC.<br>  Class B- No, they must be cleared in to Class B airspace.<br>  <br>  All aircraft must follow the airspace regulations.<br>  That said, it would take no more than a radio call for them to enter any controlled airspace.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Keep in mind, airspace extends outward for 4, 10, or perhaps 30 nm. The runway environment only takes up a small portion of that airspace.<br>  Since it is likely that only 1 or 2 runways are in use at one time and most commercial aircraft use straight-in, visual approaches, the area that would need to be avoided is fairly small.<br>  Now, if the suspect studied the approaches, checked the wind, and drove toward the active runway, that might pose a problem. Picking an IFR day would pose an ever bigger problem.<br>  <br>  One other note: The perimeter of all major airports is fenced off and not readily accessible to vehicles.<br>  The fleeing car would probably not get close enough to pose a problem.<br>  <br>  I'm sure any clearance would include "Police helicopter N12345, cleared into Class Bravo, remain clear of RWY 23/15, 29/11, maintain visual separation."|`|f21c4568248ded0eeab01a76d3a81476aa	A helicopter chasing a car into an airport usually wouldn't come close to the departure/approach pattern of the airliners.  The only way that could happen is if there is an accessible road close enough to the end of the runway that the planes are very low over it.  Chances are they won't be accessible.  But any car rushing towards the airport would be called in to ground cops, so if the police helio stopped pursuit the ground cops would pick it up anyway.  No car can outrun radios.<br>  <br>  As far as having the right to enter the airspace, of course they can, they just call up tower and say "hear we come".|`|kqofk4OFaa	they would first have to talk to the control tower and then the control tower holds all landings and take offs before the police could enter the area.|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	The Met's helicopters frequently enter Heathrow's airspace when in "hot pursuit", with permission from Heathrow and subject to varying conditions, depending on what is on. Sometimes the permission is subject to not approaching the active runway within 1/2 mile, for instance, not within 1 mile of the touchdown zone, not crossing the glideslope or whatever conditions are relevant at the time. A favourite is "Hold short and cross immediately behind the landing BA 747", or whatever it is. Heathrow don't stop or divert their traffic unless it's VERY important to do so.<br>  <br>  That's one of the reasons they have a civvie pilot, whose principal duty is the safety of the aircraft and its "safe navigation".  He WILL break off the pursuit if it is going to be dangerous or illegal, but then there are such things as radios and cars . . . .|`|jiRuuzolaa	Well usually, airports are in the centre of a particular form of airspace (CTA TMA CTZ) and these consist of different classes. "A" being the most busiest and G lower class ( open FIR ). <br>  <br>  Airspace is split into 2 different types "controlled and uncontrolled". <br>  <br>  A, B, C, D, E Controlled <br>  <br>  F & G Uncontrolled <br>  <br>  Because most Intermethical helicopter heat cameras reach about 2-3 miles it will be hard for it to spot you. <br>  On an emergency, the police helicopter would be given an "Conditional Clearance" in which they request to enter the airspace where they need to penetrate and then they may enter. Aircraft operating within the airspace would be advised by Aviation law flight rules and operational procedures.|`|fkHBVn7taa	it all depends on who is controlling the airspace, and if the car itself or the suspect is actually going endanger the airspace in anyway.  <br>  <br>  In most cases they get priority if they are in a chase or something of the sort due to the fact that the officers will persuade the idea that the person is a danger to the airport or the runways ect ect. . . they can be quite a distance and still watch.|`|8e98a5be498f77e866a4b45474db9b1caa	Airports are where most police choppers are kept isn`t it ??.. London and Gmc might have a heliport... Any aircraft can fly through any airspace with permission, unless of course  the airspace is military or restricted in any way, in which case its a no no..<br>  Aviation maps will if they are up to date show all restricted airspace...|`|4biGrjPkaa	No, they cant enter within a set radius or flightpaths. And dont ask me how I know that. BUT the camera on the front can zoom in and read a car reg plate from 2 miles away!!! It wont loose you. <br>  <br>  Busy, fully covered shopping centres are your only escape . . . . <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

But you'd have to call the DMV to make sure there are no mechanic's liens on the title.  If it's a salvage title, it will say so on the title.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Look at the title. If there is an outstanding loan (lien), it will be indicated. If there was a lien and it has been paid off, that will be stamped on the title. Make sure the name on the title is the name of the seller.

Probably the easiest way, you'll get to take the car there and then as the money is guaranteed, the seller may want to pay it into their account before you leave because of the risk of it being a fake or something. The bank will charge you for the service, if I remember correctly my Nan called them to arrange it and I took her to the bank to collect it.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	A bankers daft is like having the ccash in your hand.

ALxvsSWiaa	Prices range from around ￡90 for a Vauxhall, to over ￡200 for some Toyota's. ￡150 seems about right for a Merc. They claim it's the reprogramming that hikes up the cost. It's possible your insurance would cover it (if you have NCB protection) and if you ever resell the car a non standard key will not look good.<br>  One final thing - avoid Ebay like the plague. Try an organisation like a locksmiths society or keycutters organisation. They will give you the address of a reputable local key smiths. Timpsons in the High Street would be a good start.|`|GXct0PFGaa	If you are near London there is a place called Mill hill locks smiths key fobs are what they do. or i should say making the key fob talk to the computer in your car,|`|H7DimASYaa	yeah ebay normally works|`|7xq7hUB7aa	try going into your dealership, they can give u a quality one and get the exact measure of it, hope that helps|`|86692840fce86f8a24dea58512123d09aa	No you will need to reorder it from them but 150 L is to much I paid 125 us and there is not reason they should charge that much in pounds.|`|3HSNFDaJaa	I claimed for a lost key off my insurance.

Because of the way typical child seats fit in cars, you MAY be a little stuffed with five- I pity the poor guy in the middle seat, but four wouldn't be a problem at all. And the leg room is very good even with the front seats all the way back, and lots of room to move around and breathe, versus the current Civic, which sucks in that department|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	It is large inside.

lc1Fm7zJaa	Hey, dude! How ya' doin' man? Do you guys use ebay motors (website) in India? In the U.S. it is a very useful resource for all sorts of car parts.

Do verify first for the genuineness of the engine from the registration of the total loss vehicle and obtain the copy  of certificate confirming for the said vehicle having dismantling permission.<br>  <br>  Extreme caution is required for such change of engine using 2nd hand parts as the engine number and chassis number are main identification numbers of vehicle and can land you in trouble. If you buy new engine then there will be no problem but the costs for modification will be much higher.<br>   Take care<br>  Bye|`|EvZTXRXBaa	I think no diesel engine in maruthy 800

Yq2CUhtYaa	My 2000 Firebird was valued at barely $3500, when I sold it. <br>  <br>  For a 3 year older car, I wouldn't pay more than 3 grand. Especially with the mods, because that means it was probably driven rough.|`|OnAk3dBaaa	Go to kelly bluebook check it out. You can find the make and model. For what its worth. It is a 12 year old car with twelve year old problems. If some kid has been racing it around it will probably be crap. Another tip: If you buy a used car, go to the persons house and ask for a glass of water. If their house is nice and neat you can be assured that they take very good care of their cars. If they are messy, look for another car.
