AA10624404	Yes    Those who are strong enough to resist the temptation of sex will not be effected by their presence.    Those who need access to the condoms should have every opportunity to keep themselves and their partner safe.    I wish this was not a problem (high school students having sex), but it is an issue that requires attention.    Constantly telling high school students to wait until they mature before having sex is pointless. I wish I would have been smarter as a kid, but I wasn't.     I don't have an answer to helping teenagers resist sex, but not providing them with access to condoms is NOT the answer.|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	Are the kids having sex?

What are they gonna do it right there??? If not there, maybe they can stop by a drugstore on their way to their "spot".|`|AA11896963	College YES  High School NO  C'mon, lets start teaching kids why its better to wait for sex. I know they are doing it, but dont you think its because they havent been told why its better to wait. I'm not talking religious garbage either. I mean, these girls are giving it up for the wrong reasons. So little self-respect these kids have. Teach them to know when their ready, why, and how to practice safe sex, but I wouldnt be handing out the condoms. We've drilled into their heads how its not cool to drink and drive, but we didnt hand them a beer, did we?|`|AA11403313	Definitely why not let the school board make some money off the activities.

7087e50ee9fb265ef7235cc7f082299eaa	cave men used sharpened sticks or bones to carve images on walls.   The earliest means of writing that approached pen and paper as we know them was developed by the Greeks. They employed a writing stylus, made of metal, bone or ivory, to place marks upon wax-coated tablets.    The Chinese invented and perfected 'Indian Ink'. Originally designed for blacking the surfaces of raised stone-carved hieroglyphics, the ink was a mixture of soot from pine smoke and lamp oil mixed with the gelatin of donkey skin and musk. The ink invented by the Chinese philosopher, Tien-Lcheu (2697 B.C.), became common by the year 1200 B.C.  By 400 A.D. a stable form of ink developed, a composite of iron-salts, nutgalls and gum, the basic formula, which was to remain in use for centuries. Its color when first applied to paper was a bluish-black, rapidly turning into a darker black and then over the years fading to the familiar dull brown color commonly seen in old documents. Wood-fiber paper was invented in China in 105 A.D. but it only became known about (due to Chinese secrecy) in Japan around 700 A.D. and brought to Spain by the Arabs in 711 A.D. Paper was not widely used throughout Europe until paper mills were built in the late 14th century.|`|AA12399737	A romanian guy called Petrache Poenaru...1827|`|AA12351274	mr. bic some time ago|`|AA11629550	search wikipedia.org|`|a1ec0f8d51a2dae82572a80f9335c4cbaa	I know that a japanese guy invented the ball pen,ppl made fun of his invention because it didn't work at first,then he became famous and rich,the story behind his inspiration is interesting...

If we start blaming music for violence, how long before we start blaming movies, books and video games?    Oh, right.  We already do all of that.      Regardless of whether or not certain rappers SHOULD glorify violence, the reality is they DO.  Instead of asking hypothetical questions about circumstances we might not like but can't realistically do anything about, maybe we should be encouraging parents to keep tabs on and talk to their kids, to give them some sort of moral foundation from which to being making solid choices.|`|c05702374b5bc85f3a1502d55060a46eaa	How can a sane person uphold such crap that glorifies senseless violence all too much?

Yet the Palestinians were responding exactly as anyone would have expected them to after what the Israelis did.  Wash, rinse, repeat.    Muslims and Jews have been living together in palestine for hundreds of years, though Muslims were the majority (except in Jerusalem where the majority was Jewish).  Both side have lived together peacefully before and can again.    Source of the conflict.  In 1947 Israel was formed by the united nations in 1948 it became a reality.  This lead to a war with the surrounding arab states who felt that Israel was given an unfair amount of the best land given their population (33% of Palestines population was Jewish). Interesting note (US was the only Western Power that did not support creation of Israel, and who actively discouraged this action) Also most jews in Israel had moved there before the Holocaust.  After the first war which was largely a civil war,  Israel expelled a quarter million palestinians (Imagine if the union had done this to the confederation,  not very nice.).  After multiple wars and retaliations things have deteriorated to their present state.

As for the women in Africa, if you gave them the pill, they'd probably forget to take it, it would be so much better if they could have the 'chip'. My daughter has one implanted in her arm every year and hasn't had any side affects and neither have her friends. She hated the pill and was terrified if she had a night out that the alcohol or any resultant sickness would affect its use - which it does. Fortunately she has a very informative young female doctor who is basically in the same frame - great! How much would it cost to 'chip' these poor women every year in Africa?|`|	A "Family Planing Clinic" and a "Shower" in a Nazi Concentration Camp are essentially a PC term that masks the real function of the facility.

FWIW, keeping down excessive breeding in desperately poor and overpopulated third world countries seems like a good idea.    As for partial birth abortion, no it doesn't happen a lot.  In fact, its relatively rare and only done in exceptional circumstances.  Its only a big deal because the bible thumpers use its gruesome nature to appeal to the emotional and softheaded.   Just like most political campaigns, its an issue that's blown way out of proportion.

However, they might get an extra week off, or "floating" days off that they can choose, or compensation time, or overtime, to make up for it.

They can quote portions of the Koran that support their loving, peaceful attitude.    Their religion, however, is very chauvinistic. The policy is clearly, "Our way, wrong or right."    The way they treat Mohammad (saws) is very jingoistic. They claim that he was a person and therefore capable of mistakes, then they go on to say that he made none.  Criticizing Mohammad or the Koran is automatically wrong unless you are a Muslim.

Saudi Arabia does not allow non-Muslims to enter certain cities, and does not allow any religion other than Islam to be practiced openly.

THEY BELIEVE IT IS PROPER TO KILL THOSE WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN ISLAM.|`|E6x6fYn5aa	As a group Muslims are fairly tolerant, especially towards other religions based on the same Religion  (Jews and Christians).  One could look at Hiroshima and write the headline : "Christian militants bomb and kill 80,000 civilian Buddhists including women and children.  60,000 more die from aftermath."  Taking these events out of context, and then only describing the actors by their religion is not fair.  Most of these actions currently in the news are not about religion but about other issues.  For example you rarely hear a political leader complain about the vatican as a source of evil.  They target the US because they feel \ have been told that the US is doing bad things to them, not because we are christians.      There are areas in the Muslim world that are less tolerant of other religions, but no they are not as a religion out to get us.  There have been cases of cruelty perpetrated by muslims and christians solely on the basis of religion.  In either case such behavior is not condoned by the bible or the quran.  Particularly murder of christians and jews is explicitly forbidden in the quran.  On the other hand converts from Islam to Christianity in muslim lands are treated far worse than converts from Christianity to Islam in christian lands.  I guess you could call that intolerant, but that is about as bad as it gets, the rest is really blown out of proportion in the media.|`|i0Ydiqj2aa	Orthodox Islam is only peaceful when they are on top. If they are the ones who control the government and courts, and you pay a submission tax, then it's peaceful. If you want to have a free society or a Jewish state with its own Jewish government, then they have a problem with that. Because obviously then, Islam isn't on top.     They don't want people to just practice their religion in their homes. They want the religion everywhere, in every aspect of society. How women dress in the street, what movies are shown in the cinema, etc, etc, etc.    However Reformist Muslims can be quite peaceful. But I don't consider Reform Islam to be Islam, just as I don't consider Reform Judaism to be Judaism.
Klp0Mv6kaa	On April 22, 1979 Samir Al-Kintar along with a gang of three other PLF terrorists (Abed Majeed Asslan, Ahmed Al-Abras, and Mhanna Salim Al- Muyaed) departed from the southern Lebanese seashore city of Tyre on a 55-horsepowered rubber motor boat. Their destination was the Israeli coastal city of Naharyia, about 10 km south of the Lebanese border, the target of their operation was a residential apartment building. This operation was dubbed "Nasser Operation" and its aim was the killing and terrorizing of Israel's Jewish civilians.  And this is what he did and for what he was honoured as "the national hero of the arab nation".    Samir Kuntar quickly shot Danny in the back and then drowned him in the Mediterranean Sea to ensure his death. While Kuntar drowned Danny, he forced his 4 years old daughter d Einat to watch and cry. According to eyewitnesses, "Danny was murdered in front of Einat so that his death would be the last sight she would ever see." Little Einat would not have that horrible memory in her head for long. Kuntar, the brave Lebanese freedom fighter, crushed Einat's skull over and over upon the rocks with the butt of his rifle until she was dead.  http://napoli.indymedia.org/node/1010  And this scum is "the national hero" for arabs!|`|sTSBk9jhaa	Samir Kuntar (Arabic: ???? ????????, also transcribed Sameer, Kantar, Quntar, Qantar) (born July 20, 1962 in Abey, Lebanon), is a Lebanese Druze militant and a former member of the Palestine Liberation Front. On April 22, 1979, at the age of 16, he participated in the attempted kidnapping of an Israeli family in Nahariya that resulted in the deaths of four Israelis and two of his fellow kidnappers.[1] Kuntar was convicted in an Israeli court for murder of an Israeli policeman, Eliyahu Shahar, 31 year-old Danny Haran, and Haran's 4-year-old daughter, Einat Haran. He was also convicted of indirectly causing the death of two-year-old Yael Haran by suffocation, as her mother, Smadar, tried to quiet her crying while hiding from Kuntar. [2] In 1980 Kuntar was sentenced to four life sentences.[2]    Immediately after his arrest, Kuntar admitted to the killings,[3] but at his sentence and thereafter he denied killing the father and daughter, saying that they had been killed by security forces in the ensuing gun battle.

At midnight they broke into the Haran family home, and abducted the father, Danny, and his four-year-old daughter, Einat. The mother, Smadar, the two-year-old daughter Yael, and a neighbor hid in a bedroom crawlspace.     The terrorists took the hostages towards the shore and, when they encountered law enforcement officers and IDF soldiers, Samir Kuntar shot Danny Haran at close range and cold-bloodedly slaughtered Einat by bashing her skull against a rock with the butt of his rifle. In the hiding place at the Haran home, baby Yael suffocated to death from her mothers attempts to keep her quiet so the terrorists would not find them.    In the gunfire battle that ensued on the beach, an Israeli police officer and two members of the terror cell were killed. The surviving terrorists, Kuntar and Ahmed al-Abras, were detained, convicted and imprisoned in Israel. Al-Abras was released in May 1985 as part of the prisoner exchange known as the "Jibril deal."    Samir Kuntar was convicted of murder, attempted murder and kidnapping and sentenced to five life sentences plus 47 years imprisonment. During his time in prison Kuntar married Kifah Kayyal, born in 1963, an Israeli Arab woman from Acre residing in Ramallah, who was serving a life sentence for her activities in Jibrils terror organization (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command).   http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obs...

In the meantime, christian prabakaran, trying to hold on to Srilanka,in a treacherous act, is getting support from germany, switzerland, britain, miiliband,BBC, Canada,Human Rights Org,CNN, Al-jazeera etc. as they are keen on converting all tamils to christianity through their missionaries in srilankan tamil areas, the missionaries  holding the tamil population for blaming Srilankan forces of human attacks, as in gaza. So, all treacherous activities are going on much to the detriment of Hindus and Rajapakshe is the most straight forward leader, who has asked jayalalitha and karunanidhi to visit srilanka to see for themselves, the reality.

xdUjRxKzaa	Well, to start with, how many of them are British? How many of them would like to go and talk to the Police? How many of them are here illegally? Then you have the 'i'm not involved' brigade, the terrified brigade and the i don't really care 'cause it doesn't affect me brigade. You also have people who would love to say something but daren't for real fear of reprisals. That apart from an odd have a go hero pensioner is what the British public are made up of today. God help our grandchildren!|`|AA11504809	it's terrible what happened, but witnesses don't come forward for one simple reason, fear of being attacked themselves by either the person responsible or someone related to that person. newspapers have an awful habit of naming witnesses in their stories. or word gets around the neighbourhood who was responsible for tellings the police what/who they saw. sometimes it's better to keep quiet, it's a bad thing to do I know but they could have a family to protect themselves.|`|xU7AaQOdaa	Frightened, my friend.

6978689d5750d49479f02abe1bc6a8e8aa	Actually, Chamberlain was not a Liberal.  He was in fact a member of the Conservative Party.  What Chamberlain did, in an attempt, vain as it was, to avoid what many thought would be a replay of the horrors of World War I, was to concede a part of Czechoslovakia to Hitler in return for Hitler's assurance that he had no further territorial ambitions in Europe.  It was a foolish move, certainly, because Hitler was determined to do what he was going to do and the war would have come regardless.  If Hitler could get what he wanted without war, he was only too happy to do so, but he knew that eventually his intentions would lead to war.    What Obama is trying to do is not remotely the same as what Chamberlain was doing.  What Obama is trying to do is much the same thing that Nixon, the hardline Cold Warrior, did in breaking the ice with both China and the Soviet Union.  Those actions have been hailed as historic and statesmanlike, and had it not been for the Watergate scandal Nixon might be enjoying a better reputation in the history books.  What Nixon did, by lessening the tensions between the three Great Powers of that era, was to actually make the US, and the rest of the world, safer.  If two people who are distrustful of each other, and are armed to the teeth, are at least talking, it is much less likely that they will pull the trigger.  If Obama can lessen the tensions between the US and countries like Iran, then that can only be a good thing, as long as he doesn't try to go the appeasement route that Chamberlain tried.  There is nothing that Obama has done or said, since the beginning of his campaign until now, that would lead to the conclusion that he has any such intentions.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	what are you talking about dude|`|1G3XPiq3aa	No.|`|41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	That is an original idea, that Neville Chamberlain would have avoided war, by going to war.

That way foreign workers can't undercut UK workers on wages. Of course the cost of living is different accross Europe so it won't be feasible in the short term.  We could try and break EU rules for a while and say that where a shortage of labour doesn't exist - i.e in the construction industry in Britain there is no reason why Italian and Portugese workers should be employed. That's what they do already in most of Europe - ignore EU rules when it suits them.  Here in the UK we take rules seriously so we lose out.   What surprises me is that the Labour government isn't telling the plain truth. It cannot deliver British jobs for British workers under EU law so I don't know why on earth Gordon Brown said it.|`|cSBZQfaIaa	That`s a very delicate issue.

So it's a French firm wanting to employ Italians and Portugese on a project in Britain that could be done by British workers.|`|xdUjRxKzaa	Where on earth have you got this from? Haven't you seen or noticed what has been happening since Ignoramus Brown signed us up to the Lisbon Treaty? He signed away any rights we may have had to protect BRITISH JOBS FOR BRITISH WORKERS and this is why companies like Total, French owned, can bring Italian and Portuguese workers into ENGLAND who are being paid below our national minimum wage! Leave the banks alone, they're really not the problem - they're the GOOD DAY TO BURY BAD NEWS - the banking industry will survive thanks to people like myself who will continue to invest and with no thanks at all to the incompetent people who voted this disgraceful government into power not once but TWICE!!!!|`|bJnqYE6maa	Clue:  The Bankers are the ones BRINGING IN the foreigners dude.  Wake up.  The Bankers run the world.       Well, it happens because the working class the world over is largely composed of foolish people.  There are three types of fools.    Apathetic fools, who don't care about what's going on around them and live life moment by moment and party by party.    Delusional panicky fools, who are either left wing or right wing lackeys.  They blame whoever their leaders tell them to blame and act immediately in a blind panic to believe whatever they're told to believe.    Just plain fools, who encompass all of the above plus the idea that things are going to be different with the NEW group of rich elitists they want to run the world.  They actually think changing the "economic system" is the solution.    Of course the working class are fools.  They have no choice anyway.  They have no access to information, they have no "big picture" to make sound judgements.  They are a shapeless aimless mass with no direction.  So they are easy marks for whichever group of rich elitists can make them hate the OTHER rich elitists who want to rule the world THEIR way instead.|`|cSBZQfaIaa	That`s a very delicate issue. I mean it`s obviously acceptable that british workers are angry about Portuguese and Italian workers taking their jobs, they don`t mind receiving less and they work the same or even more than the British. The problem is that the UK is in the EU, and one of the most important principals of EU is that citizens can work in any menber country, so i don`t know but maybe the UK should begin thinking of leaving EU. It`s a very difficult issue.|`|b2WGvF18aa	What would YOU know about work????

DBuXLzjLaa	ive experienced it loads,sometimes its nearly destroyed me mentaly and physicaly,but im muscular,heavily tattoed,dont talk posh and have a criminal record,who would believe me,ive truly been there but no one wants to listen,good question,i dont think it should be about men hitting women or women hitting men,but about not using violence.|`|Uz16kQEYaa	In England there are adequate facilities for men of domestic,physical,verbal and sexual abuse.The main concern is the stigma.If anything is to be achieved and a stop put to any form of abuse towards men,they have to speak out.  For years men have taken this abuse silently,for macho reasons,or fear of not being listened to..No man wants to admit rape,,it makes them feel less of a man.The message that we should be getting across out there is that this isn't true,educating people into different ways of thinking is the way forward.    Whether it be male or female being abused.It is wrong.Full Stop!|`|ZcovejOkaa	Part of the problem with recognising male rape is the wording of the law for rape. I can't remember it exactly but it has the words "He" (the perpetrator specifically), "Vagina" (the thing having the act done to it), and specifies that the "penis" must be forcibly inserted.   The problem with this is that it automatically writes off all other forms of rape apart from the stereotypical, male forces himself into a female.  It is also believed by many that men can't be raped (although I do not agree with this). I think firstly we all need to be more educated on the issue, and the wording of the law needs to be changed to include same sex rape, woman again man rape, and also acts that are currently seen as sexual assault (example a forced ********).   As for male domestic abuse, again this comes down to education. I think the problem there is that people typically think something along the lines of "how could a man not fight a woman off, it can't have been that serious" they don't see the psychological stuff that comes with it. There is also a political problem with admitting that females can commit domestic abuse: it undermines feminist theories about women being the calmer and less violent sex.   I agree it is a totally unfair situation, but I guess the only way to change it is how woman have changed things, they stood up and shouted like hell. Encourage men to speak out, and encourage policy and law changes.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	"What can we, as a society, do to recognise the male victims of domestic abuse, and remove the stigma such victims often suffer?"    You need to get the media on side first. That has to be the first priority.    The media played a very strong role in highlighting the plight of abused women, and it could be used to do the same for men too.    Celebrity involvement would work wonders as well - like Bob Geldof with Families Need Fathers.|`|GOpQsYHUaa	With all due respect your facts are misleading.    More men suffer physical assault...yes they do (in the street) ,but domestic violence is a separate issue.More women suffer domestic (in the home)abuse.      To the thumbs downers...  I think youll find my answer is factually correct.|`|iNfkLWkNaa	It's the usual confusion.  On the one hand we are told about the rise of violent ladettes but, on the other, we are told that a wife who kills her violent husband, whether or not the killing is premedited, will not be accused of murder.  So if we recognise that women are now as violent as men, this law surely needs to be re assessed.|`|aiKLvwGTaa	According to Amnesty International, 1 in 4 women have been the subject of domestic abuse. That is a shocking statistic.    You know, in the UK, The Donkey Sanctuary Organisation receives four times the amount of donations than Refuge (a rape crisis charity).      If you have a chance, look through Amnesty's 'Stop Violence Against Women' campaign. Some of it is pretty shocking  http://amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?Catego...      --Edit---    80% of rapes in the UK are committed by someone known to the victim (Home Office report 2002)      One in four rapes in the UK is committed by a current or ex- partner (Home Office report 2002)      19% of young women and 34% of young men did not think being 'forced to have sex' is rape.      40% of 16-20 year-olds know at least one girl who has been pressurised to have sex with her boyfriend.       74% of rapes between partners occur in the victim's home and 16% occur in the offender's home.       One in seven women and one in three divorced women have suffered rape in their relationship.   http://amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?Catego...|`|3e0712426a12e872ef95671689e4e33faa	You talk about abuse towards men.Well there maybe a few rare cases but what about the abuse towards women which is alarming  rising daily and trying curb the freedom of women?What is to be done about that?Let us work for both.
Q4VwhcbXaa	Stock prices are all about expectations, if they don't like what they hear or if they do not hear what they wanted then stock traders will be nervous or negative and sell more than buy.|`|InW0bIkwaa	The reason is that there are millions of people that are currently willing to invest trillions of dollars into failing companies; however, those investors have little to no confidence in the current plan.  Large private investors are willing to help failing companies, if they are given some sort of guarantee from the government on their investments in these failing companies.  The government hiring more people is not the solution, especially when many of the jobs will only be temporary.  The right decisions would be to provide some support for these private investors to help build confidence in the private sector and promote growth within the private sector.  <br>  <br>  Introducing a spending bill that will cost this country somewhere around $1.3-$1.5 trillion is not the answer.|`|WLCpLU0jaa	Stocks are owned by the rich.

i7oHTo9haa	The Fatah group responsible for the murder of Tali Chatuel and her children are an offshoot of the PLO.  They are responsible for the Munich Massacre in 1972 Olympics of the Israeli athletes. They are also responsible for the bloody Black September Jordan battle where they tried to assassinate King Hussein and used a Jordanian soldier's head as football practice.  They then went to Lebanon and their leader, Arafat, said that the road to Palestine leads thru Jonieh (Lebanon.)  There is another group in Lebanon today, Hezbollah, that is still trying to take over Lebanon after the PLO was kicked out.  They always split and make new names but they have always kept the same goals.    The Fatah group only looks moderate when compared to Hamas.  They still are a very violent group and their leader said to raise arms against Israel and denied Holocaust and has not recognized Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state.    The only reason anyone tries to do business with them is because Israel has no other representation for the Palestinian people to do peace deal with.  They are all just as corrupt as the first with the same plans and have no intention of peace.  The Palestinians themselves will just have to change their mindset and elect a leader to represent them that actually does want peace.  They are still a long way from that mindset.    77.69% of the Palestinian men and women voted in Hamas who's purpose is to destroy Israel, Europe and the Americas and elected Fatah as their second party.    84% of the Palestinians support violence on innocent civilians (Yeshiva Massacre, 9/11) and danced in their streets after both events.    94% of Palestinian children have been victims of domestic violence in their own homes by their own family members.    They have a very violent society and Hamas and Fatah is their spokesperson... Until the time that their violent society is addressed Israel is perfectly correct to maintain them in Gaza and WB and control the damage that they cause on Israel and to prevent it from overflowing into the rest of society. Israel is actually doing the rest of the world a service to contain them there.|`|Klp0Mv6kaa	On May 2, 2004, Tali Chatuel, a 34-year-old social worker , was brutally murdered by arab muslims along with her four little daughters: Hila, 11; Hadar, 9; Roni, 7; and Merav, 2. Tali was in her eighth month of pregnancy when she was murdered.  Tali was driving when the muslim terrorists - members of the Fatah gang - stopped Tali's car with massive gunfire. The Arab butchers then approached the car and in cold blood shot each of the four little Jewish girls to death.After that they shot their already dead pregnant  mother in the stomach to make sure that her baby would die.  This "heroic Islamic deed" (to quote the PLO's "Voice of Palestine" radio) led to massive celebrations throughout the arab and muslim world.|`|tguEmxVyaa	My guess is OJ did it.

I'm thinking theres more to the story, and theres probably abuse involved somehow. Either way this child needs psychological help, and should've gotten it before he killed his step mother. He told people before that he was going to do it, and nobody got the child the help he needed!<br>  <br>  So, I understand where your coming from, but the child needs help. Plain and simple.<br>  <br>  At 11 years old, I was severely depressed, AFTER being abused by my father, and there were points where I wanted to physically hurt myself, and people around me. I was put into mental institutes, and I got the help I needed!<br>  <br>  I think children that actually understand what their doing, and do it with a sane state of thinking should be tried as an adult, but this child obviously had a mental illness, that should've been looked into.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	It was a shotgun, they used it to hunt with.

The gun was left with him and it was pre-meditated.  The sad thing is that at 11 the brain isn't fully developed and he had made threats before.  His dad shouldn't have left a loaded gun in his care (even if just for the fact that there were younger kids in the house).  His dad also should have paid more attention to his son's feelings about getting re-married and starting a new family.  Adults sometimes can't handle their emotions, let alone kids.  There is no way he could comprehend the full extent of the consequences of his actions.  He knew he would be in trouble, but he wouldn't have known how much.  The story is sad all the way around.|`|dbd8bedc1820878658fc63ada79927e9aa	not only was it not locked up he was allowed to keep it in his bedroom.yes premeditated because he hid the gun in a blanket to sneak it downstairs without the other 2 children seeing it(7 and 4 yr olds).and why are kids doing it?wish i knew. bad parenting maybe...maybe this is the end of times type of thing that's been so talked about by the super religious people, babies being born without souls and such|`|prqrQcd1aa	My opinion may be a bit biased since I actually knew Kenzie while i was living in New Castle about 8 years ago...<br>  <br>  The father will not be charged...but should be held partially responsible.. He has made threats and said things about not liking the fact that Kenzie and his father were together.. Sadly we are not required to keep guns locked up and away from kids in the state of PA, nor are you required to register such guns... sucks yes..stupid, yes..we have to change these laws.<br>  <br>  Now..what makes an 11 year old tick? To the point where he is sooo jealous that he actually kills someone? I think that for the time being the child needs to go to an adolecent psych ward...not the freaking county jail that can't even house him.. Kenzie would stick up and defend him over her own children just to try to make him feel at home, and feel loved, his own mother has not been around for the past 11 years his father has been raising him. They did not seek help because no one thought that he would actually kill her, or her children. They thought he was just jealous and it was a "phase" that he was going through.. Many people out there are guilty of the same thing.. Children being brought together with mixed families are often jealous of the new girlfriend, or other children. <br>  <br>  Kenzie and the boy's father have been only living together for 5 months when all of this happend, and the boy has been saying this stuff for a couple of months, I think they were doing a type of "wait and see" approach with him being jealous.. I will repeat again.. NO ONE thought he would actually do this! <br>  <br>  He IS going to be charged as an adult, no matter how we feel about this, or what we say about this.. In the state of PA, if you are 10 years old and kill somone with premeditation, you ARE charged as an adult.<br>  <br>  He killed not only Kenzie, but also the baby that was inside of her...i say baby because had she have been found right after it had happend, the child would have had the chance to survive... he is being charged with killing this un born child as well. <br>  <br>  I think that there could be a chance that if he gets help that he would not kill again as an adult.. I think he should get say about 25 years in jail.. first in juvie, then send him to a regular jail once he turns 21... it's usually 21 in our state that you can't go to juivie anymore. <br>  <br>  This is how I feel about it.|`|0xm2Dd1gaa	Parents need to spend more time with their kids, instead of sitting them in front of the tv, or playing videogames, maybe if this dad had done something better, or different, this may have been avoided.

I do care about a justice system that is being threatened by an uncaring President.  And I care that the media in this country no longer care about the decent values that made this the greatest country on earth.

Top|`|7uVjp0QKaa	No. CBI has failed in case.|`|rpDvbBkAaa	for that they are still killing poor nepalis|`|jgRRsG8Daa	Give me a single case or instance in which the CBI has successfully prosecuted somebody.The CBI is an arm of the government to which everything is referred by everybody with the result that nothing ever gets solved.At the drop of a hat,our politicians are crying hoarse that such and such matter has to be referred to CBI.The only thing that a  politician has not so far referred to CBI is the loss of his underpants, which either his wife has along with other clothes exchanged for some stainless steel utensils or the guy has forgotten at his mistress'  boudoir.With so many cases to be investigated and with no adequate   trained staff,we need about 50 CBIs to tackle all cases.The present CBI is a white elephant chiefly used to intimidate people who do not fall in line.|`|YIW1KIi6aa	no|`|FddLQDaGaa	cbi-blooming.?  no chance.  cbi also could nt solve many similiar cases pending investigations for decades.why?????????????????????????????...|`|y2Hrm4ioaa	No, they haven't found the killer yet.|`|iugFcVe0aa	no ...but does one not wonder how the parents are not involved?...or is it just me..!
uJhrqJCDaa	There is no ceasefire between Israel and Hamas    The ceasefire is unilateral by Israel.    Yes. Hamas has fired rockets into Israel since Israel left Gaza. Israel bombed them some more in retaliation. Some people never learn.|`|ycNt74yyaa	typical jew aggressor: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTvVYgZle...      http://www.antiwar.com/porter/?articleid...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SILJxPTqj...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KntmpoRXF...    http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig8/fisk5.h...    http://www.lewrockwell.com/margolis/marg...    Take some time to read these articles. It's worth it.    Hamas abided its terms despite the fact that Israel never met them.    Our USA tax dollars are stolen and then given to Israel to fund killing innocent people in Gaza!|`|gYgXn2weaa	Sadly no.
y3b1X671aa	That's a job, and she doesn't want a job.|`|ewFmy7Suaa	I could jerk off to that|`|vWn2qG8haa	Her vagina is stretched out of proportion.<br>  i. don't. think. so.|`|I1Hu4jmyaa	EEEEWWWWWW   WWWWEEEEE that's nasty.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	i its a job that way he mom can stop suppourting her children then yes|`|fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	No! There is no dignity in that kind of job. <br>  Her v-jay is not anymore stretched than after birthing the first baby. <br>  Twins are actually smaller, octuplets, even more. Did anyone assume she popped all eight at the same time? Dang! And you wonder why we have teenage pregnancy. some people don't know the first thing about life!<br>  <br>  Anyhoo... i find it kind of sexist that women are viewed that way.|`|obPSaYf3aa	Could you please ask another question?  I'm eating!!!!!  (just kidding.....)<br>  I believe that she could be featured in their "fugly" edition of films with massive stretch marks and a face only a iguana can love.....|`|tkSXjqhuaa	probably will. lol.|`|tguEmxVyaa	EWWWWWWWWWW. Can you imagine what she must look like naked.Her body must look like page 57 of the Thomas guide..|`|POFXeLrGaa	im not sure if she will do it or not, it tripped me out when i heard that story, but I DONT think she should do it because, i think they are just trying to test her self respect, she is already looked bad upon many people, so if she does it, she will have to live with that kind of reputation forever...and be mocked and teased her whole life, the only thing that she can do is to do something really good in her life to pick herself back up therefore she can recieve the proper respect that she and her children deserves. Plus, she has too many kids to be doing that...i think the porn industry is merely mocking her and trying to test her..|`|b1XStRqtaa	She probably will, and if she does, I would think she would be an unfit mother, which I feel she is anyway.  The kids should be placed in foster homes.<br>  <br>  And don't you find this kind of thing totally immoral?  It's like a slap in the face for all the mothers out there that work their butts off to raise their kids without handouts.   Then, someone like this comes along, gets embryos implanted that must have cost a fortune and her not even working, and then gets money donated to her up the gazuuch.  I guess we are the stupid ones.  There are people out there that would love to have children that cannot. They work hard and still cannot afford the kind of operation she had to produce this litter. Shameful.  There is definitely something wrong with the system in place.|`|jC9J0Ctuaa	She shouldnt she is not mentally stable it would just be like taking advantage of someone who was handicap.|`|todJGCP8aa	EEEEWWWW!|`|USF8xNfhaa	Theres not a **** big enough to effect that streched out ****** now|`|dbd8bedc1820878658fc63ada79927e9aa	yuck, but anyway at least they are offering her a "legitimate" job where she would earn her keep  she should take it|`|2MGJAwM9aa	No way !|`|VnCvn1mnaa	you get your news form tmz.... wow
dbd8bedc1820878658fc63ada79927e9aa	i hope her caseworker(s) are doing a full investigation of her and her finances as of late.some network surely will give her a spot however disgusting we find it, sad isn't it, the new american role model get pregnant live on welfare and get a tv show.i agree with you on the state and local but churches will give to anyone who has a need regardless of income, and i have no problem with that as they are private donations.if the people of the church have a problem with it they should speak to their pastor.<br>  <br>  on the other side of the coin i have to say neglect can happen even if there is only one child so i don't necessarily fault her for having so many i do put her at fault for the way she has done this.|`|htD82ij1aa	No her interviews aren't paid.  Though she may have a book deal in the works, and of course charities are helping her.  Although she obviously too mentally unstable to care for them.  I feel really sorry for her 14 kids.|`|ad3gCq1baa	The link below says that an NBC representative said that the network did not pay for the Curry interview.|`|goe3y4FPaa	SHES NOT UR MOM Y U CARE|`|YAiKlPkMaa	I just heard on the news that she's been offered $1,000,000 to do porn. Gross!|`|todJGCP8aa	I think the British tabs paid her something but she's doing the American networks for free. I wish she would just go away
ku5CygN8aa	Colbert is way funnier... but what's up with his right ear?! Every time I watch him, I can't help but look at that funny, misshapen hunk of cartilage. :-)|`|833e90ab40d6747f3cd17df5ddd31a51aa	neither! they're both fugly!
