Lo sviluppo della laringe  sottoposto al controllo ormonale e nei maschi si sviluppa di pi perch gli ormoni maschili ne favoriscono la crescita.  Questo fatto  anche responsabile della differenza fra le voci maschili e quelle femminili.  Un pomo dAdamo pi sviluppato, infatti, implica una cavit laringea pi grossa con corde vocali pi lunghe. Quando le corde vocali vengono fatte vibrare dal passaggio dellaria il suono che producono  pi basso perch la cavit  pi ampia e quindi ?rimbomba? di pi.  Il nome  in relazione con la credenza popolare che un pezzo del pomo mangiato da Adamo gli fosse rimasto in gola.

Adems, cuando ste se descubre ya est muy avanzado y ha colonizado demasiadas clulas del cuerpo, por lo que cuesta parar su replicacin. Es como el cncer, que metastatiza (otros virus solo colonizan ciertos rganos). Y ste por colonizar celulas inmunitarias se propaga y mata rpidamente. Entonces, los estudios se han atrasado debido a esto. Sin embargo las farmacuticas  en lugar de hacer medicina para matar al virus, hacen medicina para evitar la unin del virus con los linfocitos CD4 (celula que infectan). Lo cul esta mostrando efectividad. Aqui hay un link interactivo para que aprendas un poco ms sobre el virus y las nuevas curas encontradas.

El VIH hasta el presente no tiene ningn tipo de tratamiento curativo (Porque s existen tratamientos de tipo paliativo, es decir, que evitan que la enfermedad empeore) puesto que al pasar de los a?os ha mutado de diferentes maneras, pero esto no es lo principal, ms importante es que es un virus muy peque?o que evade as muchas de las barreras naturales y artificiales, es un virus desnudo, es decir, no tiene cpsula, lo que hace que sea difcilmente detectado por las clulas de defensa de nuestro cuerpo, y porque se replica en cantidades gigantescas y de forma muy muy rpida, lo que hace que sea virtualmente imposible de atacar; adems de otras mil razones que impiden el desarrollo de una vacuna o tratamiento curativo.    Lo irnico es que por ser desnudo, el virus del VIH por fuera del cuerpo humano muere casi instantneamente, y por eso es que los besos y las caricias o la tos de un paciente VIH positivo no nos infecta, porque se necesita que el virus ingrese directamente al organismo (Contacto sangre-sangre o sexual) para causar una infeccin.|`|KVLEPNSpaa	Yo pienso que la mejor vacuna contra el SIDA es la informacin, la educacin y condones.

3bedd6c6cdef86fae6ac398fb8369d22aa	Il th, il latte, la camomilla tiepidi possono essere utili, perch all'organismo colpito da infezione serve una maggiore quantit di liquidi ed idratazione. Nel caso di tracheite i cibi  e le bevande non eccessivamente calde servono per combattere meglio il senso di raucedine, spesso accompagnato dal raffreddore. Invece, se ci si sente molto infiammati un gelato, non eccessivamente ghiacciato,  pu apportare un momentaneo sollievo, il freddo sfiamma.  Nel caso  di mal di gola va bene respirare vapori di acqua, con aggiunta di sostanze balsamiche, perch le mucose hanno bisogno di idratazione. Il limone spremuto  in gola o il miele servono per ammorbidire, ma sono palliativi e non hanno  riscontro d'efficacia scientifica. Va molto bene fare degli scaqui e deglutire in poca acqua 20 gocce di propoli, pi volte al giorno, perch  un blando disinfettante naturale. A livello locale si pu usare uno spray decongestionante, mentre il paracetamolo(Tachipirina)  utile per abbassare la febbre, se c'. Per la tosse ci sono dei farmaci da banco sintomatici che inibiscono lo stimolo. Si possono succhiare delle carmelle balsamiche e bere delle spremute fresche d'agrumi sia per idratare le mucose, che per introdurre vitamine. Si possono fare dei gargarismi  con infusi o estratti di salvia o tinturra di mirra diluiti in poca acqua. Se si sta veramente male  sempre utile il consiglio di riposare e rimanere al caldo per due o tre giorni in casa.          Questi sono alcuni rimedi per i mali di stagione, speriamo ti servano il pi tardi possibile  Un caro saluto  ciao|`|Od4gLFr0aa	x col mal di gola mi pare servano soprattutto le bevande calde...e i cibi caldi|`|XwA70j7yaa	Io ho sempre saputo che il brodo caldo o il latte caldo faccia passare il mal di gola e in effetti a me  sempre passato immediatamente con questi rimedi!|`|VlNPkhPfaa	la via di mezzo  sempre la migliore quindi tiepide! anche perch il freddo ti da una sensazione di insensibilit momentanea al fastidio, ma dopo poco sei al punto di partenza; il caldo invece irrita ancora di pi la mucosa gi arrossata! bevi bevande a T ambiente e non avrai nessun fastidio!|`|x7YNnNjYaa	x qnt n so io... qnd ti fa male la gola fa bene il miele o anke il latte caldo col miele.... quindi penso la roba calda!!|`|qVWJZJQ9aa	BEVANDE CALDE E IL MIELE CHE FA BENISSIMO|`|8eaef2eb56110e1d99227220ed0f5428aa	Si  meglio freddi ma in fin dei conti il tuo stomaco soffre se sono troppo freddi  quindi meglio tiepidi  bevi tanta acqua e tanti succhi di frutta!|`|c3ec7b199ea9ca14cd6231d72c2bbffbaa	in questo momento ho un terribile mal di gola...e mi danno sollievo le caramelline alla menta(tipo Monk's..)e quelle al miele.

d50bc8e2d791378f0b2195d829124944aa	Questa e`una delle tante vecchie leggende metropolitane!    Il bagno lo puo`fare e come,l`importante e` che nell`acqua ci entri cautamente,un impatto violento col freddo potrebbe provocare un blocco e un gran bel mal di pancia .NN sempre ma potrebbe capitare se nn si e`abituati.  Certo che poi entrando in acqua con l`assorbente normale ne uscirebbe con uno paragonabile al pampers,dunque e`sempre consigliabile l`uso del  tampone,per evitare delle figuracce.    Ricordo che mia madre all`inizio mi vietava categoricamente doccia e bagno,ma io ho fatto sempre di testa mia e sono ancora viva .  E`tutta una questione di come la donna   abitua il corpo.  Io evito la nuotata durante il ciclo ,nei primi due giorni piu`che altro per questioni igieniche ,ma altrimenti nn mi sono mai fatta troppi problemi x il resto.  Le mestruazioni nn sono una malattia,ma ancora alcuni sono fissati e radicati nei vecchi modi di pensare.  Ogni donna deve fare le cose per come si sente e basta.    Mi sa che molti disturbi a volte sono provocati piu`dalla paura e dalla poca informazione in proposito che dal ciclo stesso ,che di per se potrebbe si rappresentare un ostacolo ma mai  un motivo cosi` grave da  farsi  condizionare l`esistenza e in casi come questo, lasciarsi rovinare una bella giornata al mare,solo perche`si parte prevenuti o si ha poca conoscenza del proprio corpo e dei meccanismi che lo regolano!

Solo ke nn tutte sn favorevoli all'utilizzo di un assorbente interno x vari motivi. Esso nn  molto salutare infatti. Meglio avere un ciclo tranquillo ke crearsi inutili dolori.  Inoltre a molte ragazze(nn a tutte) il contatto cn l'acqua fredda o cmq cn l'acqua crea malesseri e dolori. X cui meglio aspettare ke tutto finisca e farsi un sano bagno in tranquillit!

A causa della pressione dell'acqua il flusso si blocca momentaneamente per riprendere non appena esci. Infatti non sono le ovaie a smettere di funzionare, ma semplicemente il sangue, a causa della pressione dell'acqua, non esce dal tuo corpo. Non succede pero' se fai il bagno nella vasca, in quanto la massa dell'acqua (e quindi la pressione) non e' sufficiente per bloccare il flusso.|`|VkujyMWYaa	se l acqua  fredda si bloccano io cmq lo fcc lo stesso ma  solo una superstizione...cm il fatto di nn toccare le piante durante i gironi di ciclo altrimenti le piante si ammosciano...ma dai...|`|p7KWw3TRaa	ma chi le dice ste sciocchezze...io lo faccio sempre il bagno a mare.

Qualora tu desideri entrare nella componenente dei "volontari del soccorso" (et minima richiesta 18 anni) il percorso formativo attualmente  il seguente:    - corso BEPS: nozioni basilari di diritto internazionale umanitario, primo soccorso e rianimazione cardio-polmonare senza utilizzo di alcun presidio sanitario;  - CORSO OTI: utilizzo dei presidi sanitari di ambulanza per il trasporto di pazienti non in situazioni di emergenza e rianimazione cardio-polmonare su paziendi piediatrici e adulti con l'utilizzo di presidi sanitari (pallone AMBU, cannula Guedel);  - CORSO OSES: approfondimento delle patologie medico-internistiche e traumatologiche; utilizzo di tutti i presidi di immobilizzazione (tavola spinale, estricatore) e rianimazione cardio-polmonare su pazienti pediatrici e adulti con l'utilizzo del defibrillatore automatico (DAE).     Ogni corso prevede un esame teorico-pratico. Il superamento del corso OSES abilita al servizio di emergenza extra-ospedaliero in convenzione con le varie strutture del 118 presenti sul territorio.  Di volta in volta possono poi essere organizzati utleriori corsi di specializzazione per ottenere le qualifiche di salvataggio in acqua (OPSA), salvataggio su piste da sci, operatore di sala operativa, operatore di supporto psicologico ecc ecc...|`|CA89OcWgaa	Periodicamente le sedi di ogni citt organizzano dei corsi per diventare volontario del soccorso.

1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	io si, sono andata da una dietologa e mi ha dato una dieta da 1200 kcal; mi ha davvero riattivato il metabolismo, ho perso circa 6 kcal in poco pi di un mese variando molto la dieta e con un pasto-sgarro a settimana. quando poi l'ho interrotta e ho ripreso a mangiare "normalmente" ho riacquistato dei kg, ma dopo quasi 2 anni.|`|fuoQ98Wraa	Se vuoi una dieta che funziona davvero compra il libro di Montignac. Io all'epoca ho perso tanti chili e senza sforzo (7 Kg solo nei primi tre mesi, ma grasso non acqua, quelli che ti cambiano la taglia insomma).    Peccato che poi ho ripreso a "farmi" di cibo insano!!   Per ammetto che  stata colpa mia, il suo metodo alimentare (che si pu proseguire indefinitamente come Fase 2, dove ti insegna a compensare gli "strappi")  davvero molto valido, rimette il metabolismo in sesto e ti fa anche sentire molto pi sveglia ed energica oltre che diventare pi snella.    PS: 6kg in un mese  troppo! perch la perdita duri non deve essere cos veloce! considera che poi in ogni dieta ci sono dei periodi di stallo in cui il fisico si riassesta, magari perdi cinque chili il primo mese, nessuno il secondo e ricominci a dimagrire il terzo meso di due chili e poi scendi ancora e poi ti rifermi...)|`|XBq3tDhbaa	una cosa giusta l'ha di sicuro detta:  "La dieta Scarsdale, la dieta del pompelmo, la Mayo, quella del fantino, la dissociata, il digiuno e tra le ultime la dieta del minestrone detta anche dieta "brucia grassi". Sono tutti regimi alimentari squilibrati che alterano il metabolismo e diseducano chi le segue: si pur anche avere un dimagramento ma poi si riacquistano non solo tutti i chili persi ma addirittura alcuni di piy. Infatti una corretta alimentazione esige che siano presenti tutti i nutrienti: proteine, carboidrati, lipidi o grassi, vitamine e sali minerali nel giusto rapporto tra di loro. E' necessario mangiare in modo variato, cioh introdurre carne, pesce, uova, latte e latticini, pane pasta, condimenti, frutta, verdura nelle giuste quantit e controllare settimanalmente il proprio peso."

0cgMTu3Yaa	ciao  non pensare di dimagrire con dieci minuti al giorno di pedana vibrante!  sono stupidate che dicono nelle televendite!!    Io uso la pedana per tonificare ma, credimi, si fa fatica!  Si devono assumere delle posizioni e con l'aiuto delle vibrazioni tonifichi i muscoli.  chiaro che  sempre meglio di non fare niente del tutto ma da li' a dimagrire ce ne vuole!    comunque sono meglio le vibrazioni verticali che le basculanti.  Le vibrazioni poi devono essere di certe precise frequenze... una pedana da 100 dollari come la eminpower non  certo la pedana migliore!!    Per Cherrypie: ma di cosa parli? le controindicazioni non si intendono come dici tu! Se hai retinopatie e sei soggetta a distacco della retina devi evitare di usare la pedana vibrante; se sei epilettica evita di usare le pedane vibranti...  prima di rispondere sarebbe meglio accertarsi di quello che si scrive, fai del terrorismo inutile in questo modo.    ciao|`|3Y6x0mUBaa	 una cosa assolutamente inutile|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	oltre ad essere inutili possono essere molto dannose, possono infatti provocare molti danni epilessia, distaccamento della retina,danni alla colonna vertebrale...le controindicazioni sono pi dei vantaggi.|`|d1bbab5a5b20d642e7dfa98fd5c1eca8aa	certo che se fai la pedana e poi ti mangi un barattolo di nutella non ti fa niente.per me funziona abbinata a una dieta e all'ttivit fisica,sicuramente migliora la circolazione|`|IILX8NYHaa	ahah Bingo!

nVKRgR7haa	On peut considrer l'euthanasie de deux fa?ons diffrentes : soit on considre l'euthanasie comme le droit d'une personne  mourir dignement en lui vitant des souffrances, soit on la considre d'un point de vue mdical. Dans ce deuxime cas de figure, il faut prendre en compte le fait que les mdecins refusent de donner la mort, c'est contraire  l'thique mdicale.  Ce qui me gne, personnellement, c'est la possibilit de dbordements.  Si l'euthanasie tait dclare lgale, il faudrait que la pratique soit surveille de prs. Oui, mais par qui ?  Quel(s) mdecin(s) ou spcialiste(s) seraient jugs aptes  prendre une telle dcision ?  En ce qui me concerne, j'avoue que la souffrance est une perspective qui ne m'enchante pas.|`|YmS147upaa	euthanasie est un systeme monstrueux pour tuer soit les malades condans soit les prisoniers condanes a mort et je crois que c'est pas logique.....|`|vdoFEmehaa	une libert que chacun devrait pouvoir choisir en son ame et conscience|`|993678689677544b7b11aa0259f5440daa	dans l'absolu je suis completement pour etant l'etat de la medecine moderne on ne devrai pas laiss un etre humain mourir dans la soufrance s'il ne le veu pas  le probleme est que l'autoris laisserais place a beaucoup trop de possibilit de meurtre ou sucide dguis     c comme acheve un cheval bless mais l'autoriser pourrais chang tout le champs de course en un abatoire et ?A c inacceptable|`|c8725eac969b3b2220083565b84622fbaa	je suis d'accord pour l'euthanasie, si une personne souffre fortement il est le seul a ressentir sa douleure, on peux  pas dire que c'est immorale et que on va trouver une solution ou je ne sais quoi d'autre, on a beau dire ce quon veux on ne ressent rien du tout de ce qui le detruie  si il est un legume et qui continue a souffrire pourquoi ne pas abreger sa souffrance, ce n'est pas egoiste ca ? ou sadique plutot ?|`|EOTagR7Uaa	Je trouve que c'est un acte de courage que de permettre a quelqu'un de mourrir dignement.    Quand on se met a la place de personne comme madame Humbert, on en ferait tous autant je crois...

Autant, je suis pour qu'on fasse tout ce qui est possible pour permettre aux gens de vivre, autant je suis aussi pour qu'on leur permette de mourir dans la dignit, de mettre fin  ce qui n'est plus une vie.    Je suis favorable  une lgislation encadrant strictement l'euthanasie afin d'viter tout drapage et de laisser le plus possible le libre choix aux personnes concernes. Il ne faut en aucun cas en faire des criminels.    Il est vrai aussi que l'euthanasie peut tre pratique dans certains pays et qu'il existe certaines associations rgulirement montres du doigt. Mais faut-il encourager un "tourisme de la mort". Je ne pense pas.    En tout tat de cause, la plus grande prudence et le respect de la personne humaine sont de mise en ce qui concerne l'euthanasie. Rappelons que ce mot voque les heures les plus sombres du nazisme, quand ils ont commenc  liminer (euthanasier) les handicaps, les grabataires, etc. dans leur logique eugniste.  Attention aux drives!|`|f376991b16f7c5913749d5fc00cddb56aa	c'est un choix personnel trs difficile  faire.  en Hollande cela est possible la-bas la demarche demande de voir pendant de nombreux mois un doc pour dialoguer   du bien fait d'une t'elle demande pour soi.

87dH8a1uaa	non fare la dieta ma fai sport.. l'unica soluzione nel tuo caso...anche se fai la dieta non  che esiste una dieta per le gambe..ma il dimagrimento  sempre generalizzato...quindi non ti conviene. Invece se fai uno sport che ti aiuti a rassodare le gambe potresti avere risultati eccellenti e concederti tutti gli sfizi che vuoi in termini di alimentazione..e sei contenta tu in primis e anche tua madre..attenta per i risultati dell'attivit sportiva sono a lungo termine..quindi armati di costanza e pazienza e non stare sempre l a guardarti allo specchio.|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	sport sport sport sport sport bevi tanta acqua e tisane drenanti, te verde e fatti regalare da tua madre dei massaggi cos ti aiuta senza doversi preoccupare.|`|fa2aa90a6cd5ac341894a5d4dad3ffb4aa	non te fa ste pippe mentali madooo... quanti anni hai? 13 14??? aspetta ancora un po che megari crescendo qualche migliora un po e non ce bisogno che dimagrisci cerca di fare solo qualche esercizio con le gambe senza tenere una dieta|`|8QlCLlPdaa	sn nella tua stessa identika situazioneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...|`|aj42Vt0baa	Non fare diete ma ginnastica. Iscriviti a qualche corso in palestra e fai esercizi mirati, seguita ovviamente dall'istruttore. Auguri, ciao!|`|6Ubp85NOaa	Fai esercizi ginnici centrati e mirati e mangia sano, non potrai che ottenere buoni risultati.  Devi ricordare di avere sempre una alimentazione varia e sana, e poi fai un p di ciclette, corri, fai vari esercizi per le gambe, step...ok?   Ti far solo bene se starai attenta all'alimentazione: sana ed equilibrata|`|M4Z0PeTpaa	Tanto per cominciare secondo me sei pure troppo magra. Allora io direi di aggirare l'ostacolo. Potenzia (sempre con lo sport) spalle e braccia e vedrai che assumerai un aspetto piu' armonioso. Comunque anch'io ho il tuo problema ed ho trovato risultati soddisfacenti camminando tantissimo, facendo sempre le scale, ed 1 volta all'anno facendo 8-10 sedute di mesoterapia localizzate sulle cosce. Dimentica le diete e comincia a marciare|`|rOnOXSiDaa	il grasso sulle cosce purtroppo solo raramente si toglie con le diete, l'unica cosa che puoi fare  bere molto e fare uno sport tonificante per le gambe  puoi stare a dieta quanto vuoi ma quello non lo togli!|`|R0PVSeFFaa	Se tu non fai ginnastica o attivit fisica mi spieghi la ciccia sulle gambe come se ne va???lo volete capire che le diete sono pericolose nn primariamente perch potrebbero portare all'anoressia ma perch ti sballano l'organismo, e una volta cambiato il corpo non diventer mai pi sano come prima perci evita di piagnucolarti addosso e comincia a muoverle quelle gambe piuttosto che proggettare diete impossibili....|`|Vds3KApWaa	Nessun problema, devi fare solamente un po' di movimento.....quando si fa una vita sedentaria i grassi si accumulano soprattutto sulle coscie e sui glutei...    Ma basta un po' di sana ginnastica, magari un po' di nuoto sarebbe perfetto....fidati!|`|dA2x4444aa	Se hai la concentrazione sulle cosce non  che  cellulite?  Prova con i fanghi, un'alimentazione con poco sale, niente fritti, niente alcool e pochi salumi. Tanta frutta e verdura. Bevi il the verde, che aiuta, e fai un po' di sport, di quello per le gambe...  Vedrai che ti passa velocemente, non devi perdere peso devi solo modellare...|`|7qIp4Qeyaa	Non serve affatto dimagrire nel tuo caso! hai detto che sei magra nel resto del corpo, perci penso che dimagrendo perdi ancora pi chili e non sulle cosce! purtroppo dipende dalla corporatura!  ma non vuol dire che non puoi cambiarlo!  Hai provato ad andare un p in palestra? tanta cyclette (o come si scrive XD) oppure tanta corsa...  o senn, hai un motorino? quando esci, ovunque vai, muoviti in bicicletta! Fa molto bene alle cosce.  senn, prova ad eliminare il sale.  quando uno mangia salato, poi beve, e l'acqua con il sale forma la cellulite. Prova ad eliminare il sale e a bere tanto.  Mia madre ha provato ed  dimagrita di 3 kili in una settimana. E anche lei ha il tuo stesso problema delle gambe. ed  servito.  provaci, e su con morale per!  buona fortuna!|`|p8yAeMLmaa	corretta alimentazione..ke non significa necessariamente stare a dieta ma semplicemente non mangiare patatine gelati cioccolata ecc...  e poi fare tanta tanta attivit fisica in palestra ad esempio gag  un esercizio ke interessa proprio cosce addome sedere!  pu sembrarti una cosa troppo leggera e quindi probabilmente non lo prenderai in considerazione per  questo che ti serve....baci! buonafortuna!|`|RP8alnFSaa	tua madre ha ragione. Sei magra e non ne hai bisogno.   Impara piuttosto ad accettarti e a capire che quella  la tua costituzione fisica e non puoi pretendere di rinascere in un altro corpo. Molto probabilmente dimagrendo,andresti a rimpicciolirti nella parte superiore, nel viso, nel seno e le gambe rimarrebbero tali e quali, te lo posso assicurare.   La ciccia si accumula l perch le donne tendono ad ingrassare in quella fascia e sai che agli uomini piace molto?  Non ti fissare con queste cose, al massimo segui una dieta ricca di frutta, verdura, pesce, carni bianche, pasta e pane in quantit ragionevoli, bevi tanta acqua e prova a fare un po' di sport in piscina, dovresti tonificarti. Elimina gli alcolici, non metterti a fumare, evita la sedentariet, cammina tanto, limitati nel mangiare schifezze, bevi, bevi, bevi....  In bocca al lupo!|`|ZuQDxB1naa	non devi perdere peso, devi ben distribuirlo. la cosa migliore  fare il tappeto. 30 o 40 minuti di tappeto a camminata veloce e le gambe si asciugheranno nel giro di poco. almeno 4 volte a settimana. ma non diminuire il cibo, assolutamente. mangia tutto quello che vuoi, come hai fatto din'ora.|`|KkiTgFj6aa	vai in palestra oppure vai a correre 2-3 volte a a settimana|`|VPxsn4xBaa	Non per forza devi dimagrire.. basta che fai una corretta alimentazione.

Testato personalmente.|`|GpbQOQ4uaa	Ti dico una cosa... tua madre forse non si sbaglia... essendo cos magra in tutto il corpo, anche se hai delle cosce normali, le vedrai sempre grasse e troppoi grandi... semplicemente perch il resto del corpo  troppo magro.

Io utilizzo spesso il rescue remedy che  eccezionale, poi ho trovato ottimo il crab apple come disintossicante sia fisico che mentale.  Hanno prodotto anche piccoli miracoli per quanto riguarda il dolore fisico, inoltre ti fanno stare pi serena, pi tranquilla e ti 'positivizzano' in generale.

LGIKknr9aa	Beh, dipende. La carne rossa ha solitamente una % pi elevata di grassi (cavallo,bovino,agnello,vitello) e per 100gr solitamente apporta circa 20gr di proteine (la fesa di bovino arriva anche a 23/24gr).La bresaola invece arriva fino a 32/34 gr di pro per 100 gr. con 1gr/1,5gr di grassi.    Petto e tacchino hanno meno grassi e l'apporto proteico  pi o meno uguale (20/22gr per 100gr).      In teoria sarebbe meglio la carne bianca (e la bresaola), in pratica la soluzione migliore  alternare, per variare le fonti proteiche e i valori biologici (il profilo aminoacidico  differente)|`|9cDNObO8aa	Perch ha un minor contenuto di grassi, tra cui il colesterolo, per cui  pi digeribile e meno calorica. Ma la rossa  pi buona.

In termini generali rimane vero, ma le differenze possono assottigliarsi molto a seconda della parte di animale che si sceglie. Infatti i muscoli pi utilizzati dagli animali per muoversi sono, in tutte le razze, quelli pi ricchi di grasso ?invisibile? (e quindi impossibile da togliere). Quindi, se si vuole ragionare in termini puramente salutistici bisogna tenere conto anche di questo aspetto, cos come del tipo di cottura, che pu ?pesare? molto di pi, in termini di nocivit, rispetto al contenuto in grassi|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	meno grassi, meno colesterolo|`|pQIKwnnYaa	perch a parit di peso contiene meno grassi!solo per questo motivo!per cmq  giusto mangiarle entrambi! con il rapporto di 2:1 o 3:1!! ma mangia anche quella rossa perch fa molto bene!

Ho concluso questo: non fare mai nulla contro la tua volont. O meglio: sicuramente la buona volont aiuta molto ed    auspicabile, ma non tirarti scema sforzandoti a fare cose che ti fanno stare pi male che bene.  La dieta va bene, intesa come regime alimentare "logico" : non sforzarti di mangiare cose che proprio ti fanno vomitare, ma d'altra parte tieni in considerazione che pasta e pane sono la met della nostra vita!!! Inutile fare attivit fisica se poi non mangi anche carboidrati.....con le insalatine non hai la forza.....poi non reggi e fai la met di quello che faresti..... Riso???  La carne fa bene, non troppa. Dovresti seguire un regime alimentare logico, che preveda carboidrati e proteine nella giusta misura.  Te lo dico solo per PURA ESPERIENZA, perch da "giovane" ho fatto la matta e non ho ottenuto niente.  Solo ora ho capito che bisogna avere equilibrio. Esentirsi bene.  Ti consiglio attivit fisiche all'aria aperta, magari anche in compagnia o di squadra: sono pi gratificanti, salutari e trascinano di pi a superare la fatica!  A me ha fatta benissimo l'acquagym: mi ha modellato come nessuna attibit ha mai fatto su di me. Non ho perso un grammo, ma ero tonica come un pesce e stavo da dio....  E per il mangiare....elimina le porcherie....nessuno ci ha mai detto veramente quanto facciano male tortine e patatine varie.....|`|yyJvzM5zaa	ma come scrivi?  cmq...  se i fiocchi di latte ti fanno schifo xch li mangi??  cosa mangiare stasera?  una pasta?  risotto?  e che vuoimangiare...
DN7BipeUaa	"Basta un poco di zucchero e la pillola va gi!!!" Altro che forza di volont!   Non siamo tutti uguali, c' chi mangia per nervosismo (meglio che fumare forse...), chi per solitudine (meglio che buttarsi gi dal balcone no!?), chi semplicemente perch  goloso... NON  cos facile mettersi in riga soprattutto all'inizio!    Ci vuole uno stimolo, un imput, qualcosa che scatta dentro e che fa dire: "Ok, oggi ce la posso fare a non mangiare la mia schifezza preferita!". Alla prima vittoria personale contro la schifezza di turno, parte una buona dose di compiacimento per il fatto di aver resistito e si  pi incentivati a continuare. Per non parlare di quando arrivano i primi risultati!!    C' chi perde peso con estrema facilit, chi per un chilo definitivamente perso ci mette almeno 3 settimane... Bisogna aver pazienza e essere costanti, senza demoralizzarsi.    Ovviamente occorre sforzarsi di avere un certo autocontrollo, ma non serve affidarsi a una dieta ferrea: solo frutta e verdura, poco riso e bresaola... Questo lasciamolo fare alle modelle. Chi  abituato a mangiare normalmente, in questo modo rischia di perdere il controllo e in un attimo svuotare il frigorifero!  E poi, il nostro fisico e la nostra mente hanno bisogno di variet e sapore!  Allora  sufficiente diminuire le dosi, eliminare salse e ridurre al minimo i condimenti, evitare fritti, dolci, alcool e bevande gassate. Ma niente vieta di mangiare tutto il resto con molta tranquillit...  Una pizza ogni tanto, un gelato, una coca cola, una fetta di torta si possono anche concedere    Sicuramente il fatto di sapere che non sei l'unica a fare fatica ti aiuta!  Prendila come una sfida contro te stessa e quando non riesci, non rovinare tutto buttandoti su un gelatone da 5 cioccolato nutella e stracciatella! Pu capitare un giorno di sgarrare pi del dovuto e allora!?  Il giorno dopo ricominci!   Auguri! Ciao|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	un pasto di sgarro a settimana.  quello che faccio io con la dieta che sto seguendo, e dopo che ti abitui a mangiare quantit ridotte rispetto a prima, anche lo sgarro  minimo! garantito!|`|9c2dd8b5532d82416af432e358b57b23aa	Ciao cara!  Allora, dieta non  costrizione, ma buona abitudine, ok?  Allora, intanto non serve tagliare di netto le calorie,n togliere carboidrati quali pasta,pane,riso o patate, in quanto rallenteresti il tuo metabolismo e bruceresti meno kcal....poi, puoi benissimo seguire una corretta alimentazione togliendoti i tuoi sfizzi......tipo, sei golosa? Bene, al posto del pranzo, ti fai una grande coppa di gelato e macedonia mista fresca, cos non lo mangerai in pi! Abbondante colazione con yogurt a iosa che fa bene, cereali e frutta, spuntino con frutta, pranzo con un piatto unico di pasta in bianco o al sugo, e verdure e frutta, merenda con frutta o yogurt e cena con carne bianca o pesce o ricotta, o 2 uova sode, verdure, pane integrale, frutta.........modera olio e burro, no alcool e bibite gassate, tanta acqua e th verde, una buona pizza alla settimana mangiala con gioia...e se durante il d, ti scappa il cioccolatino piuttosto che un'altra schifezza, amen.......tenta di nn farlo spesso, ma non aver sensi di colpa senn rinuncerai alla dieta quanto prima, ok? Bisogna cedere alle tentazioni....senn si schiatta, fidati!|`|3SLrDtLjaa	ogni tanto si pu sgarrare un minimo|`|SjHHFfSBaa	Di solito mi concedo la schifezza la domenica, e poi ricomincio la dieta.|`|QR1JYpqbaa	Ma qualche schifezza va concessa ;-) altrimenti per forza che non riesci! Dopo un po' ti si accumula la voglia di schifezze e sgarri! Meglio concedersi qualcosina ogni tanto, quando va, senza esagerare. Cos la dieta viene seguita senza problemi. Poi la dieta dovrebbe essere vista pi come un modo di mangiare sano, equilibrato, completo, con un po' di tutto.|`|b8Pa4VH9aa	pensa a qnd ti metterai al gonna e si vedr ke sei robusta mentre le tua amike magari sn molto magre...oh insomma nn mi far sparare altre caxxate: basta un p di forza di volont!|`|yRzhfuI6aa	t prego se trovi qst stimolo poi dimmelo... da un anno ke combatto contro nutella cioccolata patatine merendine e skifezze varie...ma alla fine hanno sempre la meglio loro...|`|2JGYrKuSaa	basta un p di volont   pensa a quando ti guarderai allo specchio e dirai finalmente ci sn riuscita sn dimagrita  e pensa quando tt sarann invidiosi di te!!!|`|QjX9uCkGaa	Devi soltanto mangiare bene limitando i dolci e i fritti. Fai attivita fisica e vedi che ti troverai bene. Poi ci serve tanta tanta volont. Anche io ho il tuo stesso problema ma un mio amico, con l'aiuto della sua voglia  riuscito a dimagrire di 20 chili in 6 mesi.  Ciao!|`|a079d1e133ad0641fb80c81a886b2c94aa	Beh,  molto difficile fare la dieta ... indubbiamente!!! ci vuole tanta buona volont e nn rinunciare del tutto a qualcosa che ti piace, mangia di tutto ma a poche quantit. Bevi molta acqua durante la giornata e frutta se ti viene fame. Pensa a quei bei vestiti che vorresti indossare alla perfezione, oppure ad un ragazzo che ti piace (o al tuo se ce l'hai) io sono convinta che ce la farai !!! Baci|`|znrMA4Hbaa	la tecnica migliore per evitare schifezze  NON COMPRARLE...occhio non vede, cuore non duole... o al massimo se ti viene voglia di roba dolce. spalma della marmellata su una  fetta biscottata...non sar il massimo, ma attenua la tua voglia di dolce... se proprio non ce la fai...esci di casa e cammina....questo servir a non farti pensare al cibo
b6xj91RQaa	Fai una super colazione, ti mangi pane e marmellata, di latte prendilo intero e poi magari un paio di noci.  Dopo 2-3 ore ti fai uno spuntino: uno yogurt, una fetta di pane, un frutto. Insomma mangia cosa ti pare delle tre opzioni che ti ho citato.  Per  pranzare, pranza in modo completo: pasta o riso come primo, per secondo carne o pesce, insomma cosa ti va.   Verso le 16 e 30 ti rifai uno spuntino, simile a quello di met mattina.  Cenerai simile al pranzo ma, dovrai tenerti un pochino pi leggero.|`|V5hI6zGFaa	dolci la sera|`|7nErfez8aa	mezzo chilo di biscotti dopo cena e in due giorni ingrassi 2 kili|`|SL91ytw5aa	Tutti queli ke contengono grassi e zuccheri...devi assumere tante tante calorie!!!Ogni tnt si trova qualcuno ke nn vuole dimagrire :P|`|R90tDYdLaa	nutella, patatine, brioches....|`|E8MlNnYlaa	Pane e nutella a volont cara:):):)|`|Pj8QZG1Waa	vai da un medico! lui sa consigliarti su ci che devi fare...mangiare a dismisura dolci o cibi grassi (che tendenzialemente fanno ingrassare) potrebbe spaccarti lo stomaco!! quindi attento!|`|UrX1qm8oaa	no...non mangiare schifezze perch i 2 kili li metti su di sicuro...ma due chili di puro grasso....quindi mangia pasta e pane in abbondanza....proteine...e naturalmente puoi mangiarti gelati..pizza...patatine..ma non nutrirti solo di questo perch fanno davvero male...|`|PQWOEjzSaa	beate te che hai di qst problemi :S|`|wTzghVnHaa	mangia mangia e ancora mangia!!! alimento consigliato nutella!!!|`|gARdOB8Faa	Peso nel senso di massa corporea, ti suggerisco di mangiare tante proteine (uova, carne) e di fare diversa attivit fisica. Se invece vuoi mettere peso in generale, mangia anche lontano dai pasti, soprattutto alimenti grassi (cioccolato, torte a base di burro, olio d'oliva a volont)|`|gq1fQjlMaa	mangiando molti carboidrati ma accompagnali sempre con la verdura e mangia frutta zuccherina (la salute prima di tutto)|`|p70TCCFmaa	Cosa st per suggerirti, non  una dieta per perdere peso.   Comunque perdere peso velocemente e repentinamente non f bene, anzi  dannoso per vari organi.  1) Per il fegato, perch al suo interno ci stanno tutti i nutrimenti immagazzinati. C' dallo zucchero per breve consumo, fino alle proteine. Per un p di tempo stanno l per se in un secondo momento non vengono utilizzate, l'organismo f in modo che si trasformino in grasso, perci se te con una dieta drastica e non sana metti a rischio di sconvolgere tutto questo equilibrio.  2) Ai reni se modifichi il naturale ricambio dei liquidi, rischi di far troppa pip, oppure rischi di non farne. In poche parole rischi la gotta; che  una malattia del metabolismo,  simile al diabete. Con la gotta tutto l'acido urico finisce nel sangue perch i reni non funzionano pi, il collo ti cresce e ti viene paragonabile a quello di un bue.  3) La pelle si rovina; se dimagrisci molto velocemente, possono venirti le smagliature. Ti succede proprio come ad una donna che partorisce, dopo quasi sempre viene le smagliature sulla pancia.  Quindi ti scrivo un modo di mangiare, non  per perdere ma  per normalizzare il peso. I miei sono consigli, magari uguali per tutti, ma non dico diete con pane pesato. Io dico circa lo stesso per tutti, perch tutti sbagliano la maniera di mangiare; un p per la fretta, un p per la disattenzione e forse un p per ignoranza in materia.  Prova a mangiare: verdure prima di pranzo e cena, mangia anche la frutta ma come spuntini. Di verdura prediligi le verdure in foglia, tipo: insalata, carciofi, spinaci, eccetera........  Ti aiuteranno a snellire, poi abbinaci delle belle camminate oppure qualche nuotata e il gioco  fatto.  Questo schema lo seguo anche io, gli allenamenti li faccio a ciclo di giorni alterni, cio: lun-mer-ven-dom-mar-gio-sab e poi ricomincio! Allenandomi cos ho risolto il problema del superallenamento.Poi per il bere: Circa 2 litri, di quello che vuoi, per non aranciata che  piena di zuccheri e ha calorie inutili. Perci l'acqua resta la migliore bevanda,  la pi economica e anche la pi sana. E importante per la colazione, non c' un alimento principe. Io la faccio in maniera quasi classica: una mela, uno yogurt bianco, caffelatte con biscotti Plasmon (che sono i pi proteici in assoluto che puoi trovare un p in tutti i negozi) e un bicchiere di succo all'ananas.  Ma per un risultato migliore, dovresti praticare assiduamente un p di sport, il nuoto  ottimo. Cio nuotando muovi contemporaneamente tutti, ma proprio tutti i muscoli del corpo. Muovendoti in quel modo, stimoli tutte le parti del corpo, quindi vai ad eccitare pure i punti dove si  formato uno strato adiposo. Poi un qualsiasi sport v bene, anche jogging, bicicletta, corsa o camminata. Fai 4 allenamenti di almeno 45 minuti l'uno ogni settimana, ricordati che un giorno in piscina  un solo allenamento. Se il giorno dopo non hai voglia di nuotare, vai a correre e vale per il secondo allenamento. Non 4 allenamenti per ogni sport, puoi alternare, almeno li fai con pi passione!  Le verdure in foglia hanno fibre, poi le foglie aiutano a ripulire l'intestino. Invece la frutta, ha si fibre buone per te ma, ha anche tanti zuccheri, non mangiare pi di due-tre frutti al giorno.  Poi mangia in modo normale,  meglio per tutti, per chi cucina, per te che non ti stressi con se ghe mentali.   Ricordalo che un p di sport  importante, perch se fai una dieta lo sport  fondamentale. Se dovessi seguire solo la dieta e non fai niente, avrai solo risultati penosi; tipo l'effetto "gelatina di frutta".  Risulterai con un fisico non tonico, avrai la faccia grassa e nessuno pi ti guarder.  Ricordati anche che la frutta in eccesso, causa lo squilibrio del metabolismo. Cio troppi zuccheri posso causarti il diabete, poi quello te lo tieni.  E cosa ti ho detto non  per un sesso specifico, lo pu fare sia lei che lui.  A dimenticavo bevi da 1,5 litri 2 di acqua tutti i giorni.  Cosa importante: la verdura che consiglio di mangiare,  solo come aperitivo e non come solo pasto.|`|qJQbeKi0aa	io voglio dimagrire e tu!!!!!!|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	te li regalo io!!!!!    evita grassi e schifezze, che s ti fanno aumentare di peso ma ti alzano anche colesterolo, trigliceridi, ecc. ecc. punta quindi su carboidrati (pane, pasta, pizza & c.) e alle proteine che intanto nutrono il muscolo; in pratica un'alimentazione sana, solo pi abbondante|`|4JT9Uq1baa	Cibi molto calorici e grassi. Ma il tuo fegato non so se  d'accordo. Mangia tanti carboidrati, pasta ma non fare dei sughi pesanti e poi tutto quello che vuoi.

VNRwHajbaa	Tutta la frutta va bene, ma dovresti usare non moderazione banane, cocco, fichi d'india, fichi, kaki, mango, castagne e papaia. Sono da usare con moderazione perch hanno un elevato indice glicemico.    Per quanto riguarda il resto della frutta, non ci sono problemi, anzi,  altamente consigliata.  La frutta per contiene zuccheri, alcuni frutti di pi e altri di meno. Le pesche vanno benissimo, stai tranquillo!  Ti riporto alcune corrispondenze, in modo che tu possa farti un'idea. La quantit di frutta indicata ha circa 40 calorie:  130 g di albicocche  90 g di amarene  90 g di ananas  115 g di arance  100 g di ciliegie  250 g di anguria  170 g di fragole  100 g di kiwi  140 g di lamponi  90 g di mele  175 g di mirtilli  120 g di meloni d'estate  180 g di meloni d'inverno  175 g di mirtilli  150 g di nespole  100 g di pere  150 g di pesche  145 g di pompelmo.|`|XhTFUTaraa	frutta si: fragole, frutti di bosco, ananas, anguria:)|`|s7OlCwN2aa	vabbene tutta, x lo sai ke la frutta  piena d zukkeri? quindi nn mangiarne troppa specialmente dopo aver mangiato pasta o pane.|`|lJkGZ5c4aa	Ciao, sto seguendo una dieta..   la dietologa mi ha detto di eliminare  - banane  - pesche  - prugne  - uva  cio la frutta con una maggior quantit di zucchero..  l'anguria alla fine  acqua... perch non potresti mangiarla??    vanno bene pere, mele, anguria, melone, le albicocche, ciliegie , fragole, arance...  ciao bacio|`|xnjZAmd1aa	a me la dietologa a detto ke poxo mangiare : 2 albiccocche..1 pesca...3 prugne..una tazza di fragole o ciliegie...1 mela ..1 pera...e devo evitare il cocco e le banane !|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	limita: uva, cachi, fichi, banane, cocco, tutta frutta tropicale tranne ananas, castagne, frutta secca, datteri,    tutto il resto ok soprattutto ciliegie (circa 38 kcal per 100g) e anguria (credo 25 kcal per 100g)|`|2f8e70d7cddda70a03996a659f09f0fbaa	Banane, cocco, mango, uva, susine, albicocche e ciliegie sono quelle che contengono pi zuccheri.

Le banane sono un frutto "grasso" ma una al mattino non pu che dare energia. Le pesche e le albicocche fanno anche bene per la tintarella. per non credere che mangiare solo frutta faccia dimagrire, anzi! il corpo ha bisogno di tutto, anche di carboidratie grassi perci mangia2 o 3 frutti a pasto (o macedonia va anche bene) magari prima di ogni pasto dato che riempono e fan sentire meno la fame.|`|FFq8lIo8aa	io mangio tutto tranne le banane e le fragole, troppo ricche di potassio le prime e troppo dolci le seconde... anguria e melone sono per lo piu ricchi di acqua|`|gwE0Xbkvaa	La frutta che hai nominato va bene tutta, anche le banane che vengono tanto demonizzate! E' vero che sono pi caloriche di altra frutta (quindi nelle diete andrebbe evitata come frutta da fine pasto), ma considera che una banana apporta circa 100 kcal,  ricca di fibre (per questo ha anche un notevole effetto saziante) e quindi  perfetta per uno spuntino da dieta!

U8gIdoXFaa	I would have thought you couldnt have heroin in any form when you are on suboxone. The naloxone in the suboxone would send you into instant withdrawal. You really dont want to do that.      p.s....    If you are still craving after your suboxone dose you need to go back to your treating doctor of counsellor to organize a larger dose. Dont take no for answer. If you're doctor is worth their salt they will not hesitate to increase it for you. This programme is designed to be as painless as possible, but that doesnt mean you wont feel a thing. It's your doctors responsibility to make sure you dont suffer too much. So.... go back, get more and good luck.|`|2NzCS7ALaa	uh oh! That dosn't sound good how bout you stop smoking completely!
AA11519996	Infection anywhere in your body can be dangerous. If you are overly concerned contact your local hospital or call a doctor if possible. Otherwise get to your appointment in the morning, get your antibiotics, get pain med if necessary, and make the appointment to get your wisodm teeth pulled. I just had mine out a few months ago and it has so improved my mouth. I had pain before and infection so it was a dream to get them out. I had no trouble, no side effects, no extra numbness. Just a very good experience for having teeth pulled. Talk with the doctor about your concerns and they can reassure to make you feel more at ease. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Good doctors or dentists usually love that a patient knows and cares enough to ask.|`|nB8zqdfJaa	I have the same thing but my wisdom teeth arnt even in yet they are pushing against the other ones, i have asked 2 questions about  this tonight and no-one except about 2 people have even answered my question no matter helped, its 3:00AM here and i have school tomorow early, and i can't even fall asleep because of it. Let me know if you get any answers dustintait@msn.com.|`|NEazdZWwaa	More than likely when you see the dentist in the am, he will not do anything, other than give you antibiotics and pain meds.  He will clear up the infection before doing the procedure.  As for it being bad, any infection is not good, but do not worry, you will be on antibiotics tomorrow and you will feel better by tomorrow night.  If he gives you an antibiotic take 2 on your first dose to get the medicine in your system.  You can lose all feeling in the side of your face, plus numerous other things, BUT the chances are very slim.|`|LzT7CJ56aa	i had an impacted wisdom tooth pulled on the 2nd of december all went well(its not as bad as you might think) but 3 weeks after, i got an infection which made that side of my face swell up outside and in(alot of pain at christmas) I would recommend you ask your dentist for some antibiotics(amoxicillin) to take to stop any infection after,but if you dentist is like mine its like trying to get blood out of a stone!!!! I dont wont to put you off but 2 months on my inner cheek is still swollen abit and i now have TMJ(jaw pain which i never had before december) IM now on painkillers everyday till i can afford a night guard! Just remember to force the fact to them about the antibiotics especially if you already have infection you might be fine and all will be ok. Hope you dont have as much bad luck as i have!!

8436981597659ae2a44f3a6c63d4a5c7aa	Putting "contacts in your mouth" more applied to rigid lenses, and yes, I had lots of people say they did it to wet or clean their contacts.    Saliva is a good wetting agent.  It's the stupendous bacteria count of the mouth which ruins this as a good idea.    Using just water on soft lenses is wrong because it of the lack of sterility, but also because the lack of osmolarity will cause the lenses to swell, and the swollen low-salt lenses placed on the eye will induce corneal oedema, as the salty cornea attracts water.    More broadly, there is little limit to the bad practice *some* contact wearers will indulge in to save money or time, or from a complete failure to think or plan ahead.  Borrowed contacts, unfitted contacts, inappropriate cleaning or preservative solutions, excessive wearing times, continued wearing of damaged lenses...    Some people, often not stupid at all in other areas, could not be made to see the risks they were running.  The weakest of excuses often sufficed to cover their choices.    The lack of thought did make me wonder if contact lenses had an unsuspected side effect: reducing the wearer's IQ by at least 10%.  Contact lens wearers did *on average* appear to have both fewer thoughts and odder ones than the rest of the population.  While being *on average* less willing to take advice from an expert.    Optometrist, retired.|`|683fba774a10fec8e7e8b8ea4c6b7561aa	Yes please. Very important!|`|9923f578763ad24193648aeb065ca022aa	You would be surprised how many people would be this stupid. It's quite frightening. Once, I saw a patient of mine drop her contact on the tile floor (where people are stepping daily) pick it up, SPIT ON IT, and put it back in her EYE! My coworker and I both just looked at each other in shock, then instructed her to take it out, clean in the right way, and try again. Another tried to use hand sanitzer to clean his lenses. Needless to say, he had a corneal burn. People are crazy!|`|2GaCSyRKaa	They walk among us!  I heard from a colleague about a woman who had run out of contact lens solution and soaked her lenses in Dettol ! He put her in his car and drove her to casualty!  A man told him the protein removing tablets didn't work.. and he'd been taking them for weeks.  The peanuts I bought recently had a notice.. "warning, contains nuts"
GyB5Yfgmaa	There are medicine that prevent outbreak. Condom is not 100% safe but better than no condom. The outbreak are visible so you can prevent it. My girlfriend has herpes and I been with her for over 4 years and through prevention, I haven't contract it.|`|OBFyz3z8aa	If there are any sores within his mouth and he touches your vaginal area, it is possible to transfer such STD's.|`|AA12266052	Hi Emily, Both herpes simplex virus-1 and virus-2 may be transmitted through sex, or by kissing or touching any affected area. A condom can prevent herpes transmission during vaginal or anal sex, but oral contact with genitals or open sores anywhere can spread the disease. Washing hands can also minimize transmission.|`|elpaPX96aa	Yeah there is a small chance you can get herpes through condoms, because above the penis, is an area they call the "boxer short" area, & therefore it can still be transmitted, & absoloutly u can get it through oral sex & even kissing, or drinking after someone with the virus, but u cant get it inless they are having an outbreak. which is very visible.|`|9g2X9smKaa	THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE KIND OF HERPES. ASK A DOCTOR . BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY . GOOD LUCK.|`|fk9AvB25aa	If he wasn't having an out break at the time then condoms can help to prevent spreading it.  He can pass genital herpes to your mouth if he has an out break when you give him oral.  Just kissing on the mouth won't give you genital herpes.  If he has an out break at the time you have sex with a condom then the condom won't protect 100 percent against herpes since it can occur any where on the genitals, not just the penis shaft. If there is an out break out side of where the condom covers then you still have a risk of getting herpes.  Just don't have sex when he has any signs of an out break. When he doesn't have an out break there is less risk, but still a small chance that he could pass herpes. This is even further reduced if he is on some kind of suppressive therapy.|`|Y0zNfd19aa	kissing no, oral yes, and if he wears a condom there is still a slight chance you can get it. but is the best thing|`|bmIU3dtdaa	HSV-1 and HSV-2 can be found in and released from the sores that the viruses cause, but they also are released between outbreaks from skin that does not appear to have a sore. Generally, a person can only get HSV-2 infection during sexual contact with someone who has a genital HSV-2 infection. Transmission can occur from an infected partner who does not have a visible sore and may not know that he or she is infected.    HSV-1 can cause genital herpes, but it more commonly causes infections of the mouth and lips, so-called fever blisters. HSV-1 infection of the genitals can be caused by oral-genital or genital-genital contact with a person who has HSV-1 infection. Genital HSV-1 outbreaks recur less regularly than genital HSV-2 outbreaks.|`|94402a3891d0988f113e8b355bb34160aa	Yes, it is high risky|`|K7DIcRxXaa	yes u cant still get it, condoms dont protect against std's. and oral u can get it if he has soars in his mouth from it, same goes for kissing.|`|qIF8Mmyuaa	It's still possible.  My friend also got herpes while her bf used a condom. You can see her blog at the std dating site called pozcupid  .com|`|9CCXPGXqaa	chances are slim with protection but still possible and yes you can get it from oral sex!  if he has herpes in his mouth from someone else then yes
yUoa678Gaa	You are speaking my language. I live with insomnia and it runs me nuts. It is a form of insomnia, acute onset insomnia is the name I think. Best thing to do if you can't sleep is to stop trying. Unless you want to have some pills on hand for those times it happens. Don't do over the counter meds they are horrible and can fray your nerves. If you must, get your GP to give you a few Ambien or Xanax tablets so that when the sleepless bouts come over you you have ammunition to fight it.    Also try to keep good sleep hygiene. The website below taught me this... Only use the bedroom for sleep and sex. No computers, tv, or books even. And be careful of your coffee intake. Some people react more sensitively to caffeine so try not to drink anything with caffeine after mid afternoon, and check the labels on yur foods and meds because caffeine is everywhere.
AA12349214	I hate people who do the 'decent thing' and struggle into work with colds and flu.  They sneeze all over the place and everyone, and sit there radiating their germy aura all over the place and the next thing you know everyone has gone down with it.  If people took 48 hours off to get over the worst of it then that would be only one person losing 48 hours - when they give it to everyone else it can go on for a month with everyone in all departments going down with it!  Stay at home and dose up and keep your germs to yourself.  Used to drive me mad in the office when we had our own business and people struggled in with a cold - I used to send them straight back home again!|`|GutYNu9baa	If you have the "Flu" for real, then you will need 7-10 days off, it's a killer. You probably have a mild upper respiratory infection, that's all.|`|xsP90gEbaa	Take a day off if you have the flu you can,t get out of bed anyway|`|7FGsxx4Qaa	If you really have flu you will be incapable of going to work..See your doctor and let him decide what you have................|`|p0ioXUM2aa	take a sickie - enjoy the snow|`|ecfdaa0025f15f95c0f55c59a87b000aaa	If you have flu then you would not be able to even get out of bed. If you have a bad cold then to carry out your work efficiently will be difficult as you feel pretty awful. You will also spread your germs around and then there will be a rash of sick days from other staff members. Call in sick but not with flu, and have 2 days off at home in the warm. Then you can go back at near peak efficiency. If you had real flu you could be off for up to 2 weeks.|`|u23sua9daa	If you need a day off,than have one.|`|6CEia23Naa	If you feel you are unable to carry out your duties effieciently due to illness then it's probably a good idea that you do not attend work.    If you do have the flu and not just a cold then it's more important you don't go in as its highly contagious, easily spread and more severe than a cold. You should put your health first, but you shouldn't just go skiving off as you fancy pretending you're ill.    That's my opinion anyway.... So if you're poorly and can't work properly tuck up with a good dvd and some nice warm drinks and get better soon.|`|G2gf2ZJyaa	well u may not even be able to get to work with all this snow lol|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	If you can spread your illness and u have a fever u should stay at home.
jlcOFSwBaa	No,You don't have to eat after that.  I usually do my abs before bed or early in the Morning.  You'll get Your six pack only if you do your abs at least 7-15 min a day.  6 days a week,or no les then 5 time a week at the beginning.    I used this eBook for my guidance.  It worked just fine,as I'm a married man with one child who needs some motivation in order to get regular exercise...    Have fun!|`|cKSbZBt8aa	No you don't have to eat after a work out.  You do need to eat lots of protein foods to help muscle growth, and you will need to eat lots of vegetables for fiber. The key to a 6 pack is removing the fat tissue over the stomach area.  That requires a healthy eating platform.|`|SUs4rN49aa	No you don't have to eat after, you aren't burning calories like you do in a vigorous workout such as cardio, crunches is more about toning than fat loss.
Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi El,    That is a perfect result sweetheart considering you have PCOS. Nothing to worry about there.    I have been trying to find a site to help you, the best one I have come up with so far is www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/16422495.php  If you scroll down to the heading NORMAL FASTING BLOOD SUGAR everything below that heading will explain the normal ranges of blood sugar to you.    Hope this helps.    Love Mel.X|`|ecfdaa0025f15f95c0f55c59a87b000aaa	My test for diabetes consisted of fasting from 7pm the previous evening. I went to a surgery and they took a blood sample. I was then given a measured very sweet drink and sat down for 2 hours in the surgery. At two hours another blood sample was taken. The before and after were compared and I was deemed to be diabetic.

Both polycystic ovaries and a pre-diabetic state can be corrected with diet.  Best to deal with it now rather than when it gets worse.  Either find a good nutritionist (a nutritional therapist not a dietitician) or have a look at the Patrick Holford Low Glycaemic Load diets which are brilliant and aim for optimum health.|`|BEu6LLrxaa	have just been diagnosed has a diabetic.and your blood sugar levels are normal.between 5-7.anything higher or lower is not normal.at 5.4.  yours seen fine
WlywfjG1aa	Lol ! I appreciate your sense of humor, obviously it has to be males !Frankly does not make much difference, it mostly depends on religion and certain medical conditions in which circumcised is advised.|`|CNW6eAjoaa	For those who say they preferred the circumcised penis they are saying they prefer mutilation rather than normal, natural and healthy.  There are lots of myths and misinformation around about circumcision.  It is cleaner, and healthier not to be circumcised.  All you need to do is read a bit about the benefits of being intact and you will see how we have been duped as a society into thinking that circumcision is better.  It is better, for the doctors who make a lot of money at the expense of the child's pain.  Better informed people now are finding out the facts themselves and deciding to leave their sons the way nature intended.  Nature did not make a mistake by giving us a foreskin at birth.  Man made the mistake thinking we can improve things if we cut it off.  For all those women who preferred circumcised, perhaps you would like to crawl up onto the procedure table and have some butcher hack and cut away your labia and clitoral hood, without the benefit of pain killers.  After you have lived with the scaring and malformation for most of your life, then you will be better qualified to answer this question.|`|PAvYZJK2aa	cut and happy|`|MrGaUKIVaa	circumcised. and to my knowledge girls like it that way, cleaner you know?|`|XXbZAriNaa	I like guys to be uncircumcised - better to play with|`|11a003236016ddd45f2ddc918a54b603aa	Circumcised! For health reasons, a circumcised penis does not produce smegma that can be really odorous. If the glans is exposed, its easier to clean and is not a petri dish for growing bacteria.    although, many say that it is more sexually advantageous to have an uncut penis, many research say that there is actually no diffrence between an erect uncut penis and an erect cut penis in terms of pleasure derived and pleasure given.|`|xGI9z01Maa	Circumcise is what the Jews did for two reasons: to tell each other a part from non Jews and health reasons.      Jews were being hunted down.  Therefore, they used circumcism to identify each other like tattoos on gang members.    Also, they lived in the desert and the sand would get under the skin in that area and men would get infected and die.  (I have an ex that could not kept it clean, therefore that did it to him at age 10.)

Circumcision is genital mutilation, regardless of whether it's perpetrated on males or females.    For those females who think that it's cleaner, or better---get a female circumcision done on yourself.     It's cleaner and reduces the number of infections that women are always getting.       See how you would like to be mutilated, scarred and deprived of sexual sensitivity.    Don't try to get others to do something you wouldn't do yourself!    Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.    A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.

La cena va bene per a colazione devi integrare con latte o yogurt e cereali, a met mattina e a met pomeriggio con un frutto e a pranzo puoi mangiare quello che vuoi, anche la pasta o il riso o una bella zuppa di legumi, carne, uova, formaggio fresco, basta moderare le quantit, tanto con 1 ora di cyclette bruci pi calorie di quelle che hai introdotto. Se fai una dieta troppo rigida non avrai la forza neanche di fare cyclette. E poi perch prefissarsi l'obbiettivo di perdere 10 kg. in 1 mese? Se li perdi in 10 mesi cosa cambia? Almeno se li perdi lentamente stai certa che non li riacquisti pi. Io ho 1 amica che ogni tanto decide di fare come te.

E poi hai 300 grammi di verudre, tranne patate, fagioli, fave, piselli, barbabietole.    CENA: primo piatto ( bordo o minestra).  poi puoi mangiare come secondo 50 grammi di fromaggio magro ( crescenza, quartrolo, mozzarella), 50 gr di prosciutto cotto magro, 50 grammi di bresaola, due uova sode, alla coque o in camicia, 100 grammi di roastbeef.

Porque el antgeno es el que junto a la IgM hablan de una hepatitis C positiva.
AA11902003	Noooo! La prueba de Elisa s puede dar falsos positivos. Por ejemplo en enfermedades como lupus, sfilis y otras infecciones virales. Lo que no da son falsos negativos. Es decir, si la prueba se hace luego de 6 meses toda prueba negativa es certera. Por lo que si pasaron 6 meses luedo de tu contacto y sali negativa no tienes VIH.  Esta prueba es la prueba de eleccion. Hay otra prueba llamada Western Blot que se hace si Elisa sale positiva para confirmar que es VIH y no otra infeccin.

El ELISA para VIH es una prueba de deteccin para el diagnstico de la infeccin por VIH. Si esta prueba es positiva, se debe confirmar con una segunda prueba llamada inmunoblot, que es ms especfica, y con la cual se corrobora si una persona verdaderamente es VIH positiva, ya que hay otras afecciones que pueden arrojar resultados falsos positivos en un ELISA, como el lupus, la enfermedad de Lyme y la sfilis. Un resultado negativo es normal, sin embargo, la infeccin temprana por VIH (llamada infeccin aguda o infeccin primaria por VIH) a menudo produce un resultado negativo.   Las pruebas negativas no necesariamente descartan la infeccin por VIH, debido a que existe un intervalo, llamado "perodo de ventana inmunolgica", entre dicha infeccin por VIH y la aparicin de anticuerpos anti-VIH mesurables. Por lo tanto, si se sospecha que una persona tiene la infeccin aguda o la infeccin primaria por VIH y que por ende est en el perodo de ventana inmunolgica, un ELISA y un inmunoblot negativos no descartan este diagnstico. Es necesario entonces realizar otras pruebas adicionales para carga viral de VIH.         |`|1fkNBnKraa	El test de ELISA significa ensayo inmuno-absorbente ligado a enzima, y se realiza agregando suero a unos tubos y comenzar una reaccin con enzima Sustrato que no explicare, bueno te dije se agrega suero, a ti te sacan sangre, y transformar la sangre en suero son mnimo 20 minutos aprox, hacer el ensayo entre las 3 incubaciones y lavados son 2 horas, y despus se se lee la densidad optica de la muestra en el lector de micro elisa, bueno calculando aproximadamente se demora 2 horas 30 minutos, Mnimo, de forma expedita.

If so, you could have a very serious blood infection.    Cat and dog paws have grooves that collect dirt and grime from everywhere they go, scratch and paw.  Humans do not have the same level of biological exposure and are prone to more infections.

If you don't have pain, then it's not likely to be herpes.      If pus comes out, then it could be just zits, or could be folliculitis (infected hair follicles).  This could be true if it is mostly right around your hairline.      Each time you pop them, you are just making it continue because the oil from your fingers and the pressing on the skin will clog pores and popping will spread whatever bacteria is in the pores causing adjacent pores to become infected.    Try getting some of those little alcohol swabs in a tear-open package at the drug store.  Carry them with you and swab on the blister areas several times a day & quit popping them.  you should see improvement in a couple days.|`|vQouzFJXaa	nooo is most likely just some pimples  try clerasil if it gets worst get it check by a dermatology's|`|9CCXPGXqaa	you just have acne|`|GMrtEYj6aa	is not herpes,those are fungus don't popped them you could get an infection go to the doctor medicines will work,don't scratch either,leave them alone? until you see the doctor.

To reduce the risk of "catching" bronchitis, wash your hands often or use hand sanitizers regularly. It's also helpful to get an annual flu vaccination. Many cases of acute bronchitis result from influenza.    Sometimes people who have chronic bronchitis or asthma also develop acute bronchitis. When acute bronchitis develops as a complication of a chronic disease, it's less likely to be contagious.|`|AA10771601	not the actual bronchitis, but the virus that can cause it is contagious.

pzLDXL6gaa	Sorry the morning after pill can cause your cycle to change - yes it can cause a heavier period than usual as well as make the timing out of whack. If the heavy bleeding continues then see the doctor just to check that everything is okay.    Harriet|`|tXgzgiEoaa	How Does The Morning-After Work?    The emergency contraceptive/morning-after pill has three modes of action (as does the regular birth control pill); that is, it can work in one of three ways:       1. The normal menstrual cycle is altered, delaying ovulation; or     2. Ovulation is inhibited, meaning the egg will not be released from the ovary;     3. It can irritate the lining of the uterus (endometrium) so as to inhibit implantation.    Keep in mind that fertilization (the union of female ovum, or egg, and male sperm) occurs in the fallopian tube and that fertilization marks the beginning of a new human life - and the beginning of the pregnancy. The newly created child then travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus (womb) where he or she implants. Implantation is necessary for the new child to receive nourishment from the mother and continue developing. The journey from the fallopian tube to the womb takes between five and seven days during which pregnancy cannot be readily detected.    Therefore, if a woman ingests emergency contraception after fertilization has taken place, the third mode of action can occur. The lining of the uterus can be altered causing the woman's body to reject the living human embryo, making implantation impossible and the child will die. This result is called a chemical abortion; therefore emergency contraception is an abortifacient.    So, the only real "emergency" in all of this is the woman's fear of being pregnant.    Your cramping is most probably due to the mechanism of action of the drug.  You need to seek a doctor to have it diagnosed & lab works taken, eg. ultrasound & blood count because heavy bleeding will lead to complications, such as anemia.  in the meantime, if you have ferrous sulfate, or iron supplements, you may continue taking it.
fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	I dont have a Miacup, I have a Mooncup and a Ladycup which are both clear silicon rather than the pink, anything you do to clean the stains may affect the colour of the cup, I dont know for sure. All cups do stain, its not really a problem though as its normal for silicone to act that way so its still perfectly clean and useable, plus no one sees it but you anyway. While using you just need to wash with soap and water, if in public bathrooms you can get away with using wipes, bottled water, toilet paper or just reinserting, when it comes to the end of your period you have a few options. Wash with soap and water, really this is all it needs to stay clean, although you might want to try also adding some tea tree oil to kill off bacteria and prevent odour. I recommend getting denture brushes as these are excellent to clean in the holes, these are small brushes like pipe cleaners, and you can pick them up from the same isle as toothpaste. You can sterilise, as Miacups are silicone they can be boiled, or you can use baby sterilising fluid then rinse with water, both do help to limit staining. Another option is to use hydrogen peroxide to soak the cup in then rinse with water; it is a powerful bleaching agent so antibacterial and will help limit staining on the cup, if you dont already have some a pharmacy should stock it. A popular thing to use is apple cider vinegar, as well as a mildly antibacterial it helps to limit stains and odor, just soak overnight. Look at the memories at the menstrual cup support community http://www.menstrualcups.org which are located on the right-hand side, they have lots of information on cleaning that you might find useful. I personally just use soap and water, an occasional clean with an old toothbrush and every few months boil or put into apple cider vinegar then leave it out to dry before putting away to get rid of odor, my Mooncup became very discolored after 6 years, thus why I switched to another cup, but it still worked fine.     The Divacup company have given their official word on the matter;  "The best way to clean the DivaCup is simply using unscented soap and water. We say to boil it, however, it is not necessary to keep it clean. We do not recommend to use tea tree oil, bleach or vinegar, it is not good for the silicone. Try using rubbing alcohol to get rid of [smells], it should work fine. You can also use rubbing alcohol to clean the stains off the cup."    As for the small tears, they may just be small tears that dont effect the cups use, however if I was you I would contact the company to see what they say and ask for an exchange or a refund to buy another brand. I dont have experience of Miacup like I do with other brands, but most companies used to offer 3-12 month guarantees and although they dont do this now most will be more than willing to help you out so its worth having a word with them. Certainly tears in the cup would count as your new cup being defective so you should get a refund anyway.
AA12266052	Hi Shraddha,   The gestational sac (or gestation sac) is the only available intrauterine structure that can be used to determine if an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) exists, until the embryo is identified.  On ultrasound, it is an anechoic (dark) space surrounded by a hyperchoic (white) rim.  It is spherical in shape, and usually located in the upper uterine fundus.  The mean gestational sac diameter (MGD) is an effective estimate of gestational age between 5 and 6 weeks, with an accuracy of about +/- 5 days.   The yolk sac and embryo should be readily identified when the gestational sac reaches a certain size and the yolk sac is 20 mm in size or the fetal pole is 25 mm in size.
7jxbpo0Qaa	This could mean you perhaps have a cyst on ur ovaries...those were my symptoms...but not the discharge.  Since u did not state any itching, burning or foul odor from discharge I would guess this is just your body or yes, the prep. for ur period coming on.  Dismenaria..(painful periods..spelled wrong..sorry) could also be a possibility and bc pills can easy fix the pain.  While @ dr. have him check the discharge.  After the pain starts...the most it should take ur menses to start is about 3-5 days unless u have a form of PMS.|`|9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, these symptoms can mean that your period is soon to come especially the whitish colored discharge.    These symptoms can last about a week before the actual period comes (an example only), but I would recommend letting your mom know what's going on so she can help you keep an eye on this.|`|285cdf0f42a5ad1b82e6756c69e8c768aa	The white discharge concerns me. Please see your Dr. for an exam, or at least ask thequestion. It may be a yeast infection. Take care.

However, one partner never really knows if the other is disease free.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	I aint doing it, Bubba!  Whether it is or it isn't!|`|xO5NYuZSaa	It is said that oral sex is safer than regular sex but it is not 100% safe.  If either partner has a STD it can be transmitted through oral sex as well.|`|Iar3b4vxaa	It depends on what you mean by safer. If your worried about STD's then no. STD's can still be transmitted by oral sex.    If you are trying to avoid pregnancy, then with ONLY oral it is impossible to get pregnant. The only problem is most times it doesn't stop there and you can get carried away.    One last thing...dental hygiene is important because if the individual doesn't take care of their mouth you can end up with a yeast or bacterial infection.
5oNwMqMiaa	I'm pretty sure that ovulation is not affected by your sexual experiences.  However, orgasms can relieve menstrual cramps as it releases happy hormones.  :-)|`|QsD9VOMYaa	I find that orgasms do bring on my period earlier (about 1-2 days earlier), this is because when you orgasm your uterus contracts, starting your period (but as I said this only happens if your really close to the due date of your period)|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	i have got my period earlier with it, it can also help with cramps!
jRqXZV6Oaa	The most common cause of bad breath is a bacterial growth at the back of the tongue.  you won't be able to see it, it is usually way down the back of the tongue kind of in your throat.      Try brushing your tongue way back there.  It will probably make you gag but keep trying.  There are also 'tongue scrapers' available at the drug store to use for this purpose.     You are right about the connection to taking antibiotics - it is a bacterial overgrowth on the tongue and is correctable.|`|BdlGBdE5aa	The truth is that the things you mention as the cause of your bad breath are not really the cause of bad breath.  The School of Dental Medicine in New York has proven that 80-90% of bad breath comes from bacteria (Solobacterium moorei) that is on the top of your tongue and produces bad smelling compounds.  You can check this by looking at the top of your tongue for a "white stuff".  This is the bacteria and must be removed to get rid of bad breath.  I use an OraBrush tongue cleaner because it has both a brush and a scraper and along with some mouthwash does a great job of getting rid of bad breath.|`|1504ed0aa41d9367f9e3e5ec6d17284eaa	u could have gum disease---ask ur dentist--or something no one thinks of ur stomach|`|1QiPrFyfaa	brush your tongue & your gums. use a flouride toothpaste. rinse your mouth with water after every meal. get an electric toothbrush & make sure you use an interspace head.|`|52b395c95bb5c7a3437f9957dd9056c4aa	i think your doctor can give antibiotics just for this, im not sure but i think so. see your dentist first, make sure its not anything dental wise causing it - then see your doctor and make it clear how miserable you are about the problem.

ParFJxnSaa	It could be post natal depression, or the common, garden variety, brought on by stress. Have you seen a doctor, p(a)ediatrician, or district nurse, about your baby's reflux problem? Have you tried feeding less in quantity, but more often? Try posting a question here at Y!A in the Science & Mathematics > Medicine section, as well. I hope you are still breastfeeding, and will be, for at least the first 6 months, and preferably longer.    Post natal depression is addressed in section 2, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris on page Z.4, and see page R next. Also see, as applicable, young women's depression, page V: WOMEN TO WOMEN, teen depression, and eventually the rest of section 2. Stress is addressed in section 42, at ezy build; see page i first. There is a quiz, on page J; if confirmed, print, and see a doctor (with the baby) to eliminate medical causes, such as vitamin, or mineral deficiencies.
7jxbpo0Qaa	IBS is not detected by any test...it is determined by ruling out everything else.  Normally u also go through a period of constipation but no 2 ppl are the same.  Yes, there are several medications for this but they are not very effective.  Eating late at night, smoking, eating greasy foods, overeating, caffeine, lack of exercise, anorexia, not eating enough veggies and fruits, stress, some medications, vitamins, etc...and the list goes on.    BTW, I am sure that KFC is not the culprit.  It was probably manifesting itself for perhaps years.  GL.   (Also, bowel training is helpful.  This is when u attempt to go at the same time about 2x daily...sit about 10 minutes each time.  has really helped me although I still have constipation but not lasting for months  like before!)|`|jRqXZV6Oaa	I really don't think it has anything to do directly with the KFC.      You could have IBS.  You could have vitamin B deficiency or celiac disease.  You could be lactose intolerant.  You could have a severe imbalance in your intestinal bacteria.      Try eating some yoghurt and/or taking some bacterial supplements like lactobacillus (check at the drug store).  these will help rebalance your gut bacteria.    you can also stop eating dairy products for a week and see if there is any difference.  then try stopping wheat and gluten containing products for a week or two and see if it helps.    If none of these helps, you may just have IBS.  IBS is made worse by stress.  See a doctor for help with this, but over-the-counter gas pill (Gas-Ex) and Antidiarrhea pills are what will be of most help.|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	hi, i have had a similar problem after having my son, my stomach is always hard, and bloated, and feels heavy. i can poo more than 3 times a week, and i found out i have ibs. they should of been able to see that through an ultrasound. they recommend fiber,, like taking fiber tabs 2x a day, and more water, and more veggies. but it still doesnt help much. i know how you feel;
Rk46lIBwaa	Not at all sure of the logic in taking back to back pills because you were on antibiotics. The problem with the pill and antibiotics is that contraceptive efficacy is slightly reduced when they are combined.This is because the normal bowel flora and absorption are affected. This will still occur if you run the packs together, and the break though bleed is a symptom of it. It means that your body may not have absorbed enough of the pill to prevent the bleeding.    My advice would be to finish the current pack then have your normal 7 day break and also restart as usual. Things should quickly sort themselves out.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I would keep taking it, even if bleeding, otherwise you might become pregnant. The bleeding should stop after the break when you start the new pack. You could also ask your doc or pharmacist for advice.    Harriet|`|9pLdhuBnaa	I would recommend continuing on your pill for now but calling the doctor first thing in the morning to see what they want you to do.
8a8bf09fe751033ff9435ea5a75612faaa	There are lots of drugs and doctors that can help you on the outside. I would suggest making an appointment right away with a doctor who can prescribe drugs. You may have to go in for 3 days for evaluation but believe me you do not want to locked up for good. You may not have as much wrong as you think. Right now you are just overwhelmed. Go later today to any mental health clinic, every city has one and tell them you need to see someone right away. They will help you. Good luck. I hope you go for help.|`|B24W8w43aa	Basically they'll go through your stuff and take out anything that you could harm yourself with. Good for you for getting help.|`|PN5wdj9Daa	It is like a hospital and then not.  There is more freedom than in a hospital as you are not confined to your room or bed and can walk around the floor and sit in the lounge and talk w other patients.  There are structured activities much of each day with individual and group therapy and classes on coping skills.  The first few days you may be in an observation room if you go in suicidal.  There you are under 24 hr watch and anything dangerous is removed from you and the room.  If you become agitated and seem or are out of control they can restrain you and may medicate you such that you fall asleep.  Daily vitals are taken and when you come in and every week thereafter your blood and urine is tested. There may be a smoke break or smoking room or area or there may be no smoking allowed in which case they will usually give you the patch.  Nursing staff is less and aides (or Mental Health Technicians) are the bulk of staff.  They will interact w you when they can (like play a game of Scrabble) but they are always assessing you if they are on duty.  You have the right to read the progress notes of the aides, nurses and doctors and your whole chart.  In order to voluntarily commit yourself you have to be suicidal or rich (and able to go to a private clinic) and usually are only kept a few days or at most a couple of weeks unless you are considered by the court to be a danger to yourself or others.  If the staff or doctors think it necessary they will order you to meet with a special judge (usually right in the hospital) who will determine if you need longer term care. Then you would probably be moved to a long term facility like a State Mental hospital where the care is usually not as good and the staff ratio even lower.  If you can make a no harm contract then you may be able to leave the hospital on a pass to visit family or go to church or something like that.  A lot depends on the type of insurance you have and whether the doc thinks your pass would be therapuetic or not.  There are sometimes games or outings or clowns or therapy dogs in the evenings and on weekends.  If you have an addiction you will be expected to attend 12 step meetings.  Meals are usually brought to the floor but there is also a room on the psych ward that has snacks for patients.  There is usually also art therapy or crafts.    BTW manic-depressive is the old name for bipolar disorder.  To go to the hospital you can call 911 or take yourself in or call your local crisis line (1.800.SUICIDE will connect you nationwide in the USA) and ask them for direction and information.  If you have a church home, call your pastor and ask him to visit.  It can be a scary and lonely time and a time for pondering the meaning of life so a minister can be a great help and comfort.  If you don't have your own pastor, ask for the hospital chaplain.  I am praying for you and want you to know this is a good decision.|`|vKvNDPbDaa	manic depression is the same thing as bi polar disorder.  it shows what a strong person you are that you recognize that you need help.  that's awesome!!  inside the hospitals their are rooms sometimes you have a roomate sometimes its a private room depending where you go.  there is one on one counseling and group counseling.  all the staff is there to support you and help you feel better.  sometimes when you first get there they check on you every 5min overnight to make sure your ok.  don't be afraid i've worked in a psychiatric hosp before i liked it there.  i hope you feel better soon:)

Yn6pM2Xyaa	go to a cosmetic dentist and ask for a consult on your options and the viability of what you think that you want.  They will be able to tell you the best and most reasonable course of action.. just remember that the best choice might not include your teeth being perfect in time for your wedding but that your fiance loves you and wants to marry DESPITE your teeth not being perfect so I doubt they would care.. do it for yourself and do it the right way, not for photos and because you think others might judge you.  In the immediate you might want to consider professionally whitening the teeth as super white teeth show nicer in photos and hide shadows or less than perfect teeth.    Btw - congratulations on the upcoming wedding! :)

You should also concentrate on your triceps and shoulders at the least also.    Big biceps don't look as good if you don't have the muscular tone of your triceps and shoulders also. You could also extend this by working on your back, chest and abs for a bit more core stability to increase the weight of your workouts.    You won't really stunt growth, that is determined through your genes. However, you will build bone mass which will assist in preventing osteoporosis and any other skeletal conditions later on in life.

ebc09c64c987473ff326fb94c4c2b133aa	Here is what you need to do, if you are serious about losing weight and keeping it off. Eat 6 small meals a day about every 4 hours. Here what that will do for you, your metabolism will increase (i.e. Loose weight) and you will have  more engry. If you go on a diet and eat less, your metabolism will slow down and store to fat. That is why diets dont work. Only the size of your fist, carbs (examples:baked potato, pasta, oatmeal, beans, corn, melon, apples, fat free yogurt, whole wheat breads)in one and protien (examples:chicken breast, swordfish, shrimp, turkey breast) in the other. You can also eat vegetables and salads with any meal, they dont have none or little fat). 30min cardo exercise every day. Any of these(examples: walking, jogging, swimming,running, biking, ect), Monday cardo, tues upper body (arms: curls, tricep extensions,pull ups, front press)(abdominals: leg pull crunch, leg raises), (chest: bench press, butterfly, pullover)(shoulders: front press, arm pullover, cross county skier machine)(back:seated row, lat pull downs, back extension)(YOU DONT HAVE TO DO IN ONE DAY, mix it up) wed cardo, thurs lower body (legs: leg pull,leg press, squats, lounges) fri cardo, sat upper. Sunday eat anything you want and dont exercising, you do this on sunday so your body doesnt go into starvation mode. YOU NEED TO TAKE SUNDAY OFF. If you stilck with this you will have a great body. also drink aleast 8oz of water daily! Stay away from Mcdonals, Wendys, ect because there is nothing good for you on the menu's even the salads are bad (beaon bits, cheeze, dressing, ect) Good Luck :)|`|a4cfb48494897ae3553afe5e35006ee6aa	Do as Fado said above!

Best thing you can do is a good diet (and I don't mean one of those avoidance diets, just eat the "bad" stuff in moderation) and exercise. If you want to target your tummy then crunches would be the best thing for that.|`|145c77abf03ff49305f3226684964ee2aa	buy an ab roller at wal mart.  they are only about ten dollars.  eat alot of grilled chicken with just mayo.  no bun.|`|AA11664928	Carbs and especially refined sugars are bad.    Cardio is good. especially swimming+running.    Sit ups and crunches are good as well. it depends on the shape you want.    The best way to get the body you want is to do the exercise of the people who have that body.  Runners do not have fat around the midsection.    Dancers usually have good abs as well. However, diet and consistency are the key. It will take at least 6 months to see real improvement.    No luck, good habits!

7jxbpo0Qaa	No.  They embed themselves in the pubic hair. They are like lice. Baby girl, pls use the proper terminology....vagina.|`|jRqXZV6Oaa	No.  Crabs are actually Crab Lice.  They are lice that are shaped like tiny crabs and will crawl around on the pubic area and even on your head, eyebrows, etc.  they like to burrow down next to the base of the hair shafts and will cause an awful itching.  They lay eggs at the base of the hair too.    Use RID to kill them and their eggs.  If you cannot afford RID, you can use a doggie shampoo that has the ingredient Pyrethrum.  Use it on all infected areas daily for a couple weeks and this should take care of the live ones and the hatchlings as they birth for long enough to get rid of them all.    You must also wash your sheets and clothes to be sure you don't get reinfected.    Bte, call it a gooch.  Va jay jay sounds very elementary school.

You have already gone 48+ hours so you are basically over the hard part of quitting.|`|2v56dqbQaa	Hello L heart S. Its been a while. Your questions have obviously not  expanded on credible content and a common sense approach to life?  I do not wish to sound like a parent (cos im not), but more than twice your age, and have a lifetime of experience. I liked your answer to :LOVE @ FIRST SIGHT" ( only one I added to my contact list) I posted a few months ago when I was going through a difficult time coming to grips with the death of my mother. Too many things were banging my head at that time, and my EX from Germany, which I met on a Kibbutz 20 years ago, came to visit and say good-bye to Mum, but she stayed at my house and we did all the tourist bit, I also arranged a  4 piece Jazz group at my favourite restaurant, and all that stuff. I was in love again. But.  Going back to your tooth extraction, if it has clotted then how can infection/nicotine infect you (cos I'm not a doc either)  Question though with all these Q's you post on this site, ain't you got no mates. I live in a small town in middle England, and you can't avoid not having friends, mates come with time, you'll work that one out.  Reply, bitte tschuss.|`|HBr2bvXvaa	Yes.|`|GhuC7lACaa	its a horrible habit but i smoke so in my experience u can smoke as little as a few houres after. however the profesionals never recomend that lol i did and im fine with healthy teeth now. enjoy your fag|`|gqePUr9Laa	yeah i think if u smoke a cigarette or weed you;; be fine but just dont irritate your gums or something...strange question,,how old r u?
HsL0PYNGaa	well it depends your gender, your weight and your height.  but other than that its pretty good :)|`|doeg7JSaaa	It depends on your age build gender etc. but if you are new to working out make sure you train your whole body to build a balanced muscle structure and ensure you are not cheating on your lift as you could risk injury.  Also try to include some cardio work as nothing looks worse than someone with a muscular frame but who can hardly walk let alone run.  Remember to train for HEALTH, STRENGTH and ENJOYMENT|`|b2c3b41dc2ddd0312c585153a0720d0eaa	Yes. now put the weights on the other end.

Take care.. wish you a speedy recovery.|`|vKvNDPbDaa	i know it hurts and its hard to drink but the only thing that can help is drinking really cold stuff or popsicles and icecream  you have to stay well hydrated or you wont heal as fast.  the colder the better.  you can also try putting a bag of frozen vegtables around your neck.  get well soon.  it feels like its getting worse because your not drinking as much and the dryness makes it hurt more.
ZzqWzFNiaa	I'll start this off by saying that when I get the hiccups I get them really, really badly and it's not too terribly frequent. Personally though, I make myself throw up when I get a bad case. At some point I learned that I could fight them in discomfort for an hour or more because I have a lot of trouble shaking them, or I could just be very uncomfortable for a couple of minutes. Throwing up is surefire because it will force the trapped air out, but of course it's not terribly good for you to make yourself throw up.     Another method I've used that work OK are releasing all of the air out of me and before breathing back in swallowing ten very small sips of water, being very careful not to breathe while I swallow. Do that 3 or 4 times, regardless of whether you feel clear after the first or second time.|`|W1JSp0blaa	i have heard someone saying that holding ur breath stops it   dont know for sure|`|vGyCsllcaa	Go to washroom and PEE PEE or otherwise bend down and then put yourself straight and then put ur head up and then say ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR...

If you pull the skin, it may tear into an area that is not yet ready to come off, or does not need to.  This will burn and possibly bleed and make a scab.  A sunburn is a sign of damage caused to the skin from sun over exposure.  Let it heal naturally, applying aloe, and remember that one bad sunburn can lead to skin cancer years later.

Ibuprofen reduces uterine cramping, which is not only painful but might cause your uterus to expel the IUD.|`|AA11613544	Hey, I have the Mirena IUD, which I totally recommend over the other types of IUDs.  Its the safest and most effective.  As far as the pain, yeah its uncomfortable.  I didnt take anything.  But the pain wasnt so bad that I wanted to cry or anything.  More like just, oh ouch.  You may want to keep some Ibuprofen on hand though, for the cramping afterward.  Your period and cramping will probably be irregular for a while, but thats normal until your body adjusts.  If  youre scared, and you want to take some ibu before you go, go for it.  But since you are having an IUD inserted, I assume you have already had at least one child.  Its NOWHERE NEAR THAT painful, so dont worry, lol.  Just crampy feeling.  Good luck!|`|6a27887d6352a22fadb44f45dfb2d1f2aa	Taking ibuprogen also helps fight inflammation.  So they ask you to take it in order to prevent inflammation from inserting the IUD.  Don't be scared, it may hurt, but it is the best form of birth control.  I have had one for 2 years and I recommend it.  I don't have kids either, and my doctor didn't have a problem with that.

Read the labels carefully...they ALL say the same thing. Something along the lines of "if you take this pill with a calorie-reduced diet and regular exercise, you MAY lose weight." Even the so-called natural ones carry dangers with them that are not worth it.    You must have the calorie-reduced diet and exercise, and those two things will be just as effective, if not MORE effective if you don't have the weird chemicals in diets pills coursing through your system, causing heart, kidney, and liver problems. At best, the pills are a waste of money. At worst, you can suffer really awful health problems.    There's only one safe way to lose weight effectively, and that is to eat a LITTLE less (by 200-400 calories) than the amount of calories you need to use in a day. If you eat too much less, you body goes into fat storage mode, and any attempts at starving yourself will backfire, as you will get fat quickly again when you start eating again. The diet pills can have the same effect, in that they stop your body from having a normal metabolism, which is really bad news for your health, even if you are exercising and eating healthy.

Fatti fare le analisi relative al TSH, al titoli di tiroxina, misurati i titoli ematici delle proteine deputate al trasporto della tiroxina, e fai anche l'analisi sulla presenza di anticorpi contro le cellule della tiroide.    L'unica cosa che puoi fare,  affidarti al medico di famiglia, accertare il problema e la causa e poi sottoporti a terapia per il resto della tua vita prendendo semplicemente l'ormone tiroideo sotto forma di compressa una al giorno......e vedrai che potrai condurre una vita tranquilla.    Affidarti a cure OMEOPATICHE, oppure ad assunzioni di iodio o altre diavolerie.....non solo non ti fanno niente, ma addirittura potrebbero aggravare la tua situazione e favorire l'OBESITA'.  lascia stare le cure termali ed altre DIAVOLATE che ti propongono......tu devi affidarti al medico.....meglio se questo  un ENDOCRINOLOGO specializzato in malattie tiroidee.    CORDIALI SALUTI|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	lo iodio in eccesso secondo me lo assumi mangiando, non credo che i fanghi possano influire; prova ad andare in uno dei tanti centri termali in cui fanno i fanghi e fatti consigliare

Come diceva una mia ex, l'affare dev'essere "non lungo che tocchi, non largo che tappi, ma duro che duri". Quindi il tuo problema  solo di durata. E' un problema, per, soltanto mentale, perch con un p d'esperienza riesci a decidere tu quando venire. Innanzitutto controlla i movimenti, cercando di evitare quelli che ti fanno godere maggiormente. Quando senti che stai per venire, se  troppo presto, rallenta e fermati per un p, bastano due o tre secondi. Prima d'iniziare il rapporto, falle molte coccole ma non fartene fare molte, giusto quelle che ti servono per avere l'erezione. Lei, invece, devi farla impazzire prima della penetrazione. Non masturbarti troppe volte prima del rapporto, altrimenti avrai un pene moscio, che  molto peggio di un'eiaculazione precoce. Se la prima volta vieni quasi subito sei perdonabile, se  moscio invece fai la figura dell'impotente! Fatti una sola "smanettata" tre orette prima. Usa i preservativi ritardanti, se ti  possibile. Durante il rapporto, cerca di stimolarla quanto pi possibile, se ci riesci: clito e capezzoli, principalmente. E se per caso vieni prima di lei, non commettere l'errore di dimenticarti del suo piacere: due-tre dita ed una stimolazione del clito le faranno raggiungere comunque l'orgasmo. E comunque ricorda: se ti ama, una venuta precoce te la perdoner e farete esperienza insieme. Se, invece, ti presenti con un affare moscio, te ne vieni dopo un'ora ma non la fai godere e manco venire, magari qualche dubbio potr anche assalirla!|`|YHR3xPofaa	carissimo vuoi un consiglio reale ? allora non ascoltare le risposte alle tue domande, sai perch? perch da solo avrai le risposte la prima volta , ognuno di noi  diverso magari ti posso dire cosa succede di solito ma tu sei tu, le dimensioni non contano , dipende da come lo usi, le prime volte sicuramente non sarai soddisfatto di te al 100% ma poi metterai a punto le cose che desidera la tua ragazza e riuscirai a soddisfarla in pieno , la prima volta  normale durare meno di un minuto vedrai che sensazione meravigliosa infatti non provare senza profilattico erch raggiungerai l'eiaculazione in un attimo , poi via via quando t abitui dura sicuramente pi tempo, stai tranquillo goditi tutto serenamente senza farti troppi problemi inutili , che t impediscono di dedicarti al momento . un abbraccio|`|CtvqDBF2aa	allora io l'ho di 14 e ho 16 anni ti dico che non conta una mazza il pene!!!!!!!!!!! per la durata abbiamo un problemino... voglio dire cavolo un minuto nn e' niente a lei manco la fai svestire in un minuto........fai cosi in ste settimane prima della relazione vai giu di mano a bomba e lavora sulla resistenza lo devi spompare a quel coso e quando lo fai non pensare a cose arrapanti pensa a cme ti e' andata la giornata e distraiti...poi prima del rapporto te ne fai due o tre e vedi che quando arrivi da lei sei un leone ...facci sapere!!|`|hJpJW6xzaa	1-la lunghezza non  importante tranquillo...  2-la masturbazione dura di meno ma cmq le prime volte  normale durare poco...|`|fMyZ9ewfaa	credo x  la misura non ci sia problema ma il vero problema  x il fatto dell'eiaculazione precoce in quanto se duri un minuto alla ragazza non li fai nemmeno abbassare le mutandine .... cmq se x te  la prima volta b metti caso che la prima  volta sei in imbarazzo quindi non arriverai subito all' orgasmo .. al massimo fatti un paio di seghe prima e magari duri di + non scherzo e dico seriamente|`|XwtAeMK1aa	cerca di essere molto piu sciolto nn pensare a tutte ste cose....sii spontaneo nn importa la lunghezza o la durata....dipende da cm  il tutto..la situazione, la persona ke hai accanto..tante cose....di cui nn dv preoccuparti !!!!!!!!!!!  buttati !... pure ora!|`|kfLgzUv1aa	ciao....    allora... le dimensioni non contano + di tanto......  x la durata.... un minutino  un po poco ......    la prima volta ke lo farai arriverai subito..... ma sta sicuri ke dopo 5 minuti avrai ancora voglia di farlo...... e li gi durerai di+......    cmq se proprio 6 insicuro.... compra dei profilattici ritardanti..... t aiuteranno........     buona fortuna...  |`|bAIaVA4Faa	Ciao, stai tranquillo il pene  pienamente nella norma non  importante la lunguezza, ma saperlo usare... x l'eiaculazione tutto normale non sei un eiaculatore precoce  mancanza di esperienza... comunque riuscirai a capire meglio la tua situazione quando lo farete, dai tanta importanza ai preliminari... facile ke la prima volta non riuscite nel vostro scopo (io ti auguro di si), ma mi raccomando alle precauzioni, non darti arie di riuscire a controllarti.

GJKsizL7aa	Semen must get into the vagina in order to cause pregnancy.  Anal sex generally will not result in pregnancy.  But, if the semen is wiped or dripped near the vagina, there is always a possibility that sperm may make it into the vagina. Not a very good chance.  But, he should be wearing a condom during anal sex.  Then your chances of getting pregnant are virtually zero.|`|uRvwLkIBaa	If I were you I wouldn't take any chances.

It tastes kind of strong, almost peppery, so try adding a little organic honey to sweeten it.    As long as you don't overdose, since it's just a reg. tea, you shouldn't get any unwanted symptoms.    Don't take my word on that, but my fam's been using this method for a while and we haven't had any problems.|`|GBG2hbQ4aa	Ginger tea is terrific for upset stomachs, as is GingerAle (a carbonated ginger drink in the soda aisle).      If your stomach continues to give your grief, you may want to do more than just sooth it.  Aloe vera juice is very healing to the digestive tract.  I don't care for it alone, but it's tolerable mixed one part aloe to two parts ruby red grapefruit juice.  If you don't care for grapefruit juice, mix it with OJ.|`|coZ7Fm79aa	id like to know this too maybe a contact of mine will know|`|FHiZ0a6Uaa	peppermint candy

And what happened to veggies, the corn doesn't really count.  Hope you are exercising with 1500 calories.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Meh, it could've been better.    I'd recommend this for breakfast (+ lunch)    Breakfast (same as Lunch):  -1/2 cup oatmeal = (150 calories), 27 g carbs, 5g protein  -3 egg whites = (17 calories each, 51 total), 12g protein  -1 chicken tender = 75 calories, 16g protein  2+ Cups of water  (1 multi vitamin with breakfast only)    It's sacrificing a lot of flavor for health.    For your lunch, try something simple like a classic pb&j, bottle of water and an apple.    Dinner, your going to have to eat vegetables & lean meats like chicken and fish.|`|ofmfWaitaa	you didnt over eat but you could have eaten a little bit healthier. You should probably eat a better breakfast.  Like try having a bowl of oatmeal that you make yourself not the little packets! Read the instructions on the back of the container for serving sizes. Also add maybe some strawberries or grapes to the oatmeal or have some fruit on the side. Also after breakfast you could go out for a jog or a walk with friends something to just get moving! I know for lunch you could have a healthy sandwich with whole grain bread or a healthy soup is also good for lunch - not canned unless you read the nutrition facts and decide that its healthy. Also have some vegetables and/or fruit for lunch. Substitute the soda for water, orange/apple juice/etc or fat free milk. Then if you excerise more during the day you could do what I do and have a healthy energy bar before playing sports or exercising. I like the Kashi trail mix bars. For dinner you could have some meat if you want. One example of a healthy dinner is what I had tonight. We took a wrap and we stir fried peppers, onions, and chicken in a healthy homemade sauce. Then you can put that in the wrap and add some lettuce, a bit of cheese or whatever in it. We also had some baked broccoli and milk. That dinner is pretty healthy. Ummm and if you have a craving for something sweet buy a bag of chocolate and have one piece a day or make have one serving of breyers vanilla ice cream or make some homemade cookies and have one of those a day! Good luck, and remember to have some fun with friends and everything too!

Include a lot of multitasking and variation in your workouts. Running is good too but not for long distances..jog for 2 minutes then sprint for 30 seconds jog for 2 then sprint for 30 seconds. You need to jumpstart your energy levels. Good old fashioned crunches helped Britney Spears in the day and they will help you. Don't do 1000 but aim for 100-200 a day. Focus on circuit training and muscle confusion workouts. Great dvds to test out are the Biggest Loser workout dvd series. So great! I have seen such tremendous results since I've started the program!    For the "love handle" area I would recommend leaning to the left then the right while standing straight with hands on hips.

mTuykihxaa	Wow, James is pretty ignorant when he says that their hasn't been any scientific research regarding a relation between smoking and lung cancer. Of course their has! There's tons supporting that connection, and if you just thought for a moment, it is obviously right. Inhaling any kind of smoke is bad for your lungs, especially over a long period of time.     Why are some people saying that you have to hit rock bottom? That shouldn't be the case. You obviously want to quit, so you have the 'will' to quit.     It sounds like you haven't had a go at attempting to quit. You can't decide that it's going to be hard for you before you even try. Have  a go! There's nothing to lose. You could try some patches or nicotine gum. The addiction part comes from nicotine, but I would think the horrible part of cigarettes is the actual smoke. So you are still getting your addiction fulfilled.    Good luck!|`|vRVNJcHIaa	Because it's addictive! Talk to your doctor and try going on the patch and/or try chewing that nicorette gum. Don't just automatically stop smoking, cut back on them.. and then that will lead to not smoking at all.|`|YPkY7yWHaa	It seem like its not your time now BUT it can be YOUR time.|`|sxImRCT5aa	but a thing on your hand saying like sad stuff and make like your sis or mum or something break it and it would be fun and ea t like junk food instead|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	Smoke so much that you can't afford it anymore so then you become really addicted and poor so that you have to quit.|`|NIYYN6tpaa	The only way is to hit bottom. When I quit I was smoking two at a time and not knowing it and I was craving one when I was smoking one. I hated it when some one would say lets go to so and so's house and I would have to see if I had enough sigs to do that.........On day I just stopped and never looked back..........good luck|`|1BbnyTfBaa	I recommend the book, "Changing for Good."  It is a self-help program based on sound scientific research into how people change themselves.  The program has been used to increase the percentage of people who successfully quit smoking and lose weight, among other things.    According to this program, you are in the "Precontemplation" stage.  The book tells you what all six stages are and gives several techniques at each stage to help you move yourself to the next stage.    Here is a page that describes it briefly:  http://personaldevelopment.suite101.com/...    And here is the book at Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Good-Revo...|`|AubmEoYgaa	If you don't have the true will to stop, you won't. You can buy patches and gum, but if you don't have that will to quit, they are useless. I smoke and I enjoy smoking. What I do is I control the cigarettes, they don't control me. The Bible says do everything in moderation, which simply means don't over indulge. Ten cigarettes is no worse for you than ten beers or ten shots of whiskey, or ten sugary products through out the day. If you don't want to stop, then control them. There is no laboratory results that prove that smoking causes lung cancer. Ask a hair stylist if they know anyone who has asthma or always coughing. They will tell you most likely yes. Isn't any of them that smoke, it's the hair spray they constantly breathe. In Hints of Heloise, a woman couldn't remember the cleaner she recommended for getting the build up of hair spray off her counter top in the bathroom. If it builds up there, where else would it build up, you are right, the lungs. Women should use a Doctors mask when spraying their hair with hair spray. Wishing you the very best young lady and good luck on accomplishing your goals.

AG9msdUDaa	Yes it could, most notably the B vitamins give you loads of energy, so if you are missing out on them, then you get really tired. I'd just recommend a great multivitamin once a day and if that doesn't do it, then start adding the B complex to it. I'd recommend a liquid organic food based multi with minerals so that you get the most from it, unlike the synthetic cheapo ones that your body doesn't know what to do with so it excretes most of it. I will leave you with google searches below for product ideas. If that still doesn't do it, then it's time for a blood test. It could be low iron or low vitamin D, both of which you need to supplement under a doctors supervision. Or it could be other deficiencies/diseases as well, that's why I suggest starting out with, at the most,  the multivitamin + minerals and a B-complex.|`|B8e8x60Saa	how old are you?.. are you thin? do you feel tired all the time? are you short tall for your age?    get yourself checked out.. you could have thyroide deffecency.. could be a homone issue.. or somthing else.. get ur self checked out ASAP|`|EofNXem2aa	well  if you gave you age and weight we couled answer a bit  better ,mabe its because you like the sofa watching tv or playing  games on the  games console ,what you need to do is try to do an outside sport  ie. football hockey swiming, judo  some thing you like the more time you spend indorrs the more you  feel tired i think the sofa is some thing that kills you little by little,if this is not youer case do somthing you like if youer enjoying somthing you  dont feel tired ,also do some research on how to eat healthy and stay fit,andlast b not least check  youer blood you couled be low on somthing and its the only way you can discard low in  iron or what ever ,rember you are what you eat if you eat lots of fast foods you will ebd up like a mr potatoe head|`|xUuqcKWoaa	your blood sugar level could be off or your testosterone level could be low. both depends i guess on your age too.
50WKEbrxaa	try a normal tooth paste|`|pvabglXhaa	it doesn't matter at all    toothpaste just dries the skin out    try a product specifically designed for pimples and you will have much greater success|`|IrahyL2Qaa	first of all i do not know where you heard this.  im no doctor or anything but i dont think toothepaste works....i have been using this over the counter drug called OXI (maximum strength) for the last two years. and it has destroyed all my blemishes within a day or two. it is a little wipe that you wipe on your whole face once daily. also DIFFERIN works if you need to just ged rid of like 1 standoutish pimple but it is more for spot treatmen......i really recomend OXY, you can buy it at any drugstore...walgreens, CVS, etc.|`|5ta5yyWSaa	It is an urban legend. Use Proactiv or acne cream instead. If it is really bad see a dermatologist.
gPAUzjJhaa	It's possible to spread, though not to a face or mouth.  Grab some sugar free yogurt, L. acidophilus, wash the towel in hot water, and boil your undies.|`|ZQfGvUgMaa	Yes to both. It can be passed on a towel.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Its not likely...but you never know...|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	maybe|`|ENyb91iKaa	pretty sure you can as long as its fresh yeast|`|0xK7TDroaa	No I don't think so but I would never use someone else's towel anyway just to be safe.  Yeast is actually everywhere on your body.  When you get a yeast infection it just means that the yeast is multiplying more there.  Years ago a doctor told me that baking soda and water is pure alkaline and alkaline kills yeast.  So, if you are a girl you can douche with 2 teaspoons of baking soda in warm water in a douche bottle every second night before you go to bed for a few times and that will help,  Again, if you are a girl your period actually has a lot of alkaline in it and that helps to keep your body in balance but if your periods are infrequent then sometimes you have a build up of yeast.  Also, I have found that saliva sometimes causes yeast infections.  I am no doctor and yeast infection treatments for women are over the counter now so if in doubt then buy one.  I don't know what to say about yeast infections in a mouth or on your face??  Again, try baking soda and water, its cheap.  If that fails, go to your doctor.  Good luck!|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	Sure...but just put the towel in a dirty clothes hamper. You expect to reuse it after rubbing your yeast filled vagina on it?

rtQCrk1Laa	No, your baby size has NOTHING to do with adult height!!! Your friends proves it!     And you're 5'6" because you're 14...you still have almost 10 years to grow!    Genetics has a lot to do with it, but because you are 14, it is very hard to tell...you don't get just one growth spurt during puberty, but many in all different sizes.    You''ll grow a few more inches I'm sure! The average adult height is around 5'11", so if you're close when you're about 23ish, then you're good!  I hope this helps!|`|bbWzitisaa	i am not sure how true it is, but i have heard somewhere that if you measure a child when they are about the age of 2, double that height and that is how tall they will be when they finish growing. it was true to me, as i am double the height i was when i was that age, i am going off of what my parents gave me. i added it up, and i was supposed to be 5'8". i am currently that height at 19 years.

ndR5PE2Caa	Hi, running is great for building endurance, you burn a lot of calories so keep up with all your protiens and carbs. If you can vary your routine so as, you get a whole body workout, do sit ups each day as well. Core strengh is important so your abs have to be strong.  If you go to a gym it would help in the strenth side, you don't have to go crazy with heavy weights just use lite weight but do lots, say 4-5 sets of 20 reps on each exercise and of course sit ups at the end. Keep up with fluids and food as you will burn them and swet quite fast whilst training and have a good meal after training to replenish what you burn,ok. Good luck and I hope you do well.|`|QYn2hVgYaa	yes it is bad to run every day if you do your toe nails will fall off|`|oH018gyaaa	No you should not run everyday. The tip to build good endurance is to do a long distance run every other day increasing the distance by 10% or so. And then in between the days do short things that help keep up your lung capacity. There is this great drill that my soccer coach taught us in high school which is called the University of Michigan Beep Drill. It helps build up your lung capacity which help your endurance. Also keep in mind that you need to have a down day where you relax at least once a week.|`|KPyUl0YYaa	Of course not. I run 6X a week.    It's a helluva feeling thanks to the runners high a.k.a. endorphins and it keeps your body in shape.    However, do up your intake of healthy carbs and protein.The usual suspects, 100% whole wheat bread, lean chicken breast, peanut butter, turkey, etc.

(try not to surf the internet, that can make you more stimulated)    That's usually what I try to do and I fall right asleep.

w43tUGP8aa	Most likely it is just for heartburn. Most hospitals will automatically put patients on it.   What is the dose they are on? If it is just something like 20mg a day, it most likely is just heartburn   They could also be on it for a number of different reasons, such as      Duodenal Ulcer   Dyspepsia   Erosive Esophagitis   Gastric Ulcer   Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease   Helicobacter pylori Infection   Multiple Endocrine Adenomas   Systemic Mastocytosis   Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome   Erosive Esophagitis|`|OyBuEpOTaa	you need to know the diagnosis.

ccp0fmQcaa	You probably dont want to hear this...but you are almost at an exact appropriate BMI for your age. Your actually ALMOST a bit under averge, nearly making you technically a little underweight. YOU DO NOT NEED SUCH AN INTENSE WORKOUT ROUTINE to tone up your mid section. Girls that are too skinny are unattractive....ask ANY GUY. If you want to be active, and stay fit..great. 20-30 minutes of cardio three times a week, followed by 3 sets of 30 crunches...is perfect. The combo of cardio and calesthetics should do the trick within the first few weeks if you stick to it. Also, instead of eating three big meals a day....eat 5-6 smaller meals a day to keep your metabolism constantly working. Each meal should consist of a protein (chicken, tuna, fish, etc.), a veggie, and a palm side portion of a healthy whole grain carbohydrate. Don't be afraid to indulge here and there...the key to a succesful diet is to not completely deprive yourelf...you'll get bored and you'll definatly binge.    Finally....your 13. I know its hard not to worry about your weight but literally focus more on being HEALTHY.|`|c8eiYUHuaa	stop asking question and do it. hahah|`|uTW2KW9raa	yes it will work. but you that also means you cant stop doing this routine, because once you do when you have reached your goal weight - the weight will come back on.

I worked off 25 pounds, it definitely does work!|`|iJk6hVPuaa	I think you would be happy if u lost 10 poundsd|`|Pq48dNPUaa	Well it depends. If your 5'5'' you shouldn't be 130lbs. If you used to be muscular then you should maybe lose 10-15lbs. . If you used to be average, and you know what average is, then 15-20lbs. . If you used to be very slender or skinny then just chop of that 30lbs. .
WrDGhduxaa	there is no draft so it doesn't matter, but when there was a draft flat feet would not always keep you out.

vJBEnFVzaa	Im going to recommend you 3 things that I've done that work... 1. Go to walmart, target, Walgreen's etc and get a thing called thermacare in with the medical stuff in the store its in a box about about size of a movie sized theater box of candy and what this is, is a heating pad that you actually stick onto your body and it works wonders. It stays hot for 8 hours and its just amazing try it. 2. Take 4 ibuprofen and drink a pepsi or red bull that together is better than any menstruation pills on the market that work also. and then finally 3. Hot baths. 1.. maybe 2 a day for about 15 minutes.. These things have worked for me so hopefully they work for you also.|`|TORBP6QIaa	The absolute best pills for pain relief of period pain is Aleve (US) Naprogesic (Aus) it targets the prostaglandins that cause the pain ...it is so much more effective than any regular pain killers...you will be feeling better quickly and be able to get back to living instead of feeling like crawling back into bed with a hot pack. Its also in one of the Midols not sure which one read the boxes...look for the ingredient "Naproxen"...thats the same stuff thats in Aleve.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	sit on an ice pack|`|tGAt3ZKkaa	IMG same with me, i ave had my period for a few months now but last months one was SO horrible!   Non stop cramps in my stomach and bladder.  Sick feeling  saw body parts  and the list go's on.    I found the thing that worked best was panadol, but yet that doesn't work well either.
EbWWII65aa	Slitting wrists doesn't count as a morbid story. Slitting wrists counts as an emo anecdote.|`|IDgSVPBxaa	Cutting wrists  main Wrist cutting    This method entails cutting through the wrists with the aim of tearing open the radial artery and may damage the tendons, ulnar and median nerves which control the muscles of the hand, which can result in temporary or permanent reduction in sensory and motor ability.[2] Cutting may also be aimed at veins, in hope of bleeding out.    Slitting wrists or other (often not effective)  Time: Minutes if major artery cut, eternity otherwise.  Available: You really need a razor sharp knife. Razors are pretty tricky to hold when they are covered with blood.  Certainty: possible if you cut an artery, improbable otherwise  Notes: Painful at first. Danger of discovery. This is a very common suicide 'gesture' and hardly ever results in anything other than a scar. A lot of will power required to cut deeply into groin or carotid arteries, which are the only ones likely to kill you. Don't bother with this method. Cutting your throat is difficult due to the fact that the carotid arteries are protected by your windpipe (feel where your arteries are with your fingertips, & slice from the side). I've seen photos of people who have used this method - the depth of the cut required is amazing. If you want to cut your wrists, cut along the blue line (vein) on the underside of your wrist, but cut deeply so that the artery underneath is exposed. Cut this lengthways with a razor or similar. The traditional hot bath does help, since it keeps the blood flowing quickly, slows down clotting, and is nice to lie back and relax in. Position yourself so that your wrists don't fall inwards against your body, blocking off blood flow.     Calle: A posting to A.S.H. suggests using the kind of equipment they use when you give blood to a blood bank, i.e., a needle in a blood vessel and a piece of tubing. It sounds like it would remove several of the disadvantages of the ordinary slitting-wrists method.|`|QRG2L5Qjaa	When you slit your wrists, it depends how deep, and how fast you slit it.    If you slit it fast, you would have some blood come out, no feeling, and definetly only blood.    If you slowly went deeper, you would see more layers of muscle underneath cut open, you would lose some mobility of your hand, it would definetly hurt, you could talk, and you have to at least slit past a halfway mark in ur wrist to die.
K9Nqkfh4aa	I do that too! Showering all the time is totally addiction-worthy (even apart from OCD ppl who feel dirty all the time).   It's the worst in the winter! I get really cold (my room's radiator is teeny tiny) and shower 3x a day just because it's so warm!   But I do it in the summer too. I like showering in the morning because it makes me feel like I'm "starting my day" and I like doing it before bed because it makes me sleepy. And if I'm working at home I'll take a break from work with a shower. Maybe I find it relaxing but just don't realize it?|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Sure, it's probably become a relaxation method for you, or a 'safe place' or whatever you want to call it. It's also possible that you are developing OCD, but it doesn't sound like that from your description.    It's not the worst addiction you could have, by far. But it's actually not great for your skin, and it wastes water and energy.    Start with simple methods to break the habit. Replace the shower with something else that is more acceptable - like read a chapter from a book, or meditate, or something. If it's hard to divert yourself, you may need more serious methods.|`|6fjMtWboaa	What are you sunconsciously washing away?  Is a problem to bathe that much, I'd talk to a shrink.|`|wcv9xgh5aa	Maybe it is possible!  Maybe you are living proof!  Haha.  i don't think it is wierd what so ever.

Hope i helped, God Bless You[:|`|a2Ih10O1aa	everything seems to be addictive these days, I haven't heard of showers though. 3 times a day isn't that bad either. I've heard a lot of people take a shower twice a day.  do you feel like you have to take a shower cause of germs or dirt? or do you feel like you "just have to" take it otherwise something bad will happen, or you just won't make it through the day, or won't get on with your other tasks throughout the day? if so google this: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder(OCD)  most of the times when we read about a disorder we think we have it. keep that in mind, and also that a behavior or a pattern of thoughts can only be identified as a mental disorder if it keeps you from continuing your daily life.|`|hoI9CwWLaa	Maybe you're masturbating in shower then you remind yourself ohh if i wanna masturbate again then i gotta do it in the shower.. lol.. Maybe it relaxes you and take the stress away|`|KHhBDZMsaa	people can have addictions to lots of stuff and one of them can be showers?! do you often find yourself freaking out about how something is so dirty? or you drop something on the floor and really afraid that it is chalk full of germs and won't touch it anymore? maybe you have OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) and i would advise you talk to your parents or somebody you trust. it's ok to have a shower everyday but not every few hours or so!! hope i helped!! ;)|`|AA11675747	A little strange, but showers are great...especially hot ones on cold days...maybe try taking a bath instead and you'll enjoy the experience more.|`|3emS6MDmaa	Anything can be addicting, but unless it is affecting your ability to function normal, (for example, if missing one of your showers affects the rest of your day, or you constantly think about it) i wouldn't worry about it to much.  If it is affecting your quality of life then talk to a counselor or someone about it.  If you are a college student there are probably counseling services available on campus.    If it isn't causing you problems all you have to worry about is your water bill!  Good luck, and remember, everybody has quirks thats what makes us unique!|`|DNMa3Rv7aa	Your fine!! It makes you relax. AS long as thats not all you are doing or thinking about 3 showers is more than most but alot take 2 showers so your aliitle ahead of it but your okay!!!|`|hp2mRgGPaa	I don't know if it can be addicting but I do know that it feels great after I have taken a shower or even brushed my teeth for the matter! A person once told me that anything can be addicting but because of the harmless nature is not considered a threat.  But if you are staying clean then good for you!
sVbZEWveaa	Number one I would recommend sparkpeople.com. I have used it and it works I wont put a link for it because I know most people don't like to click on stuff but you can google it.    Now what I did to get more active is started walking. And I started walking around in my house. I bought a pedometer and calculated my steps and added till I was walking 10000 steps a day. Now I go to the gym and run on the treadmill and exercise bike. I started all this in December and since I am adding more and more little by little it has worked for me. I would recommend it.

I8b66BvSaa	Just try not to think of anything that would be arousing. If u start thinking of it immediately change what you are thinking or do something such as walk or talk to someone etc. You could always try masturbating before you go, which will make you less likely to get an erection as easily. Or, as the guy in Superbad says, 'Flip it into your waistband' haha. Hope this helps mate.|`|PAvYZJK2aa	masturbate or think unsexy thoughts will help|`|Dyn8oLVxaa	im 15 and i hate getting em to. i found out that if u masturbate in the morning before you go to school like when u wake and are getting ready you should try it. ive found that it gets me up faster.|`|5B2yQnFmaa	aha! dude that sucks!!  im sorry, but idk  and no, im not a guy...  my bad|`|4lbgJXI0aa	Sadly, you have to just wait.

AA11522944	There are many possible causes of painful urination.  The most likely are a urinary tract infection (UTI), chemical irritation (like from soap) or a sexually transmitted disease (STD or STI).    Painful urination might also be caused by more serious problems such as kidney stones or prostate infection.    Urinary tract infections and most sexually transmitted diseases are treated by antibiotics.  If the pain does not go away soon see a doctor.

VWAq8KDzaa	Which is a better routine?  The answer depends on what your objective is.    Working with heavy weights will tend to break down your muscles and allow them to rebuild themselves larger and stronger.  So, if you're looking to bulk up and build muscles, then the heavier weight routine is your best plan.    Working with lighter weights will firm and solidify your muscles without tearing them down.  If you want to improve your stamina with a sleek and toned look, the lighter weight program is your best bet.    Good luck and good health!|`|oTHGgowsaa	depends what your going for, heavy weight with fewer reps builds strength and bulk, lower weight with more reps strengthens endurance. If your going for mass and strength, start with your max weight you can do in reps of 8-10, do three sets of this, and gradually put more weight on, if your going for endurance, put on the max weight you can go about 25 reps with, do three sets of these as well. Don't forget to give your muscles enough rest to repair, as well as feeding them protein so they can repair.|`|hoI9CwWLaa	Like everyone said High weight low reps (6-8) build bigger muscle and make you stronger, Low weight high rep (12-20+)  tone the muscle and makes you look cut.. Don forget to get whey protein for post workout|`|JV9N6hWzaa	depending on what you are trying to accomplish... if you are on the skinny side and want definition i suggest lighter weights and more reps but if you are kind of chunky and want to bulk up i suggest heavy weights and less reps..|`|ocnLnB01aa	If your a Guy, heavy weights with fewer reps, a female lighter weights with more reps.|`|3emS6MDmaa	Lower weight with high reps will cause muscle hypertrophy (bulk). Higher weights with fewer reps will increase strength more.  I would suggest a combination of both.
qOzEuQofaa	Yes you can get a yeast infection from many different things. Specially if you douche that can lead to yeast infection. I would recommend you going in to see the doctor and get a pill that makes it go away within 3-5 days and if you're too shy or don't like going to doctors then just eat plenty of yogurt and get the monistat 3 or monistat 7. Sometimes the monistat 1 doesn't really work and better safe then sorry you might get the other ones i said.|`|FyrRDGqiaa	no, yeast infections can be caused by other things, have you been taking any antibiotics?  I've contracted 2 that way. Those are known to cause yeast infections in women for some reason;  You may have just gotten one for no particular reason, which is just so unfair because it's just about the worst thing!  Try eating yogurt, it helps tremendously... And go get the monistat 1, which clears it up in a day or two.  Good luck girl, it's just part of being a woman.|`|AzFScZ3Kaa	I don't think you have.

Yeast infections can be caused by numerous things.  Yeast grows in moist and tight environments, so if your underwear are tight that could be a problem.  Over washing can upset the natural ph balance in your vagina.  Just wash normally and gently.  Don't scrub hard, because that will cause more pain and irritation.  I would probably advise going to see your doctor just to make sure it's actually a yeast infection.  It might just be some irritation.  There are over the counter creams such as Monistat that you can apply inside your vagina that will get rid of the infection.  You shouldn't just wait for it to clear up on it's own.  If it is a yeast infection it is possible for it to get worse.  No reason to be embarrassed or worry though.  It's nothing you did, and it's not caused by being promiscuous.|`|TFThZ9mgaa	you don't have to have sex to get an infection. yeast likes to grow in moist humid places. i know that's gross but true. you can eat yogurt. yogurt has bacteria in it that can balance out this area of your body. however, eating too much yogurt and/or antibiotics are known to give you a yeast infection. i would go to the doctor. he can give you one pill and in 5 days the itch is gone. also remember, not every vaginal infection is a yeast infection. some infections can become serious and eventually damage your fallopian tubes. i hoped this helped.|`|HIwJFtNlaa	yeast infection shouldn't be something you have to deal with, it's a health concern.  i have no profession in medicals and im only 15, to be blunt but i figured i'd help you out there, and go to a gyno, get some advice and maybe a prescription because it's something that sounds like a rather important concern.   good luck (:|`|3b43628da17fa39fdf0695aa42cc5afdaa	keep that area clean and keep food and sweets out of there.

I would suggest developing a small exercise regimen and building on it during the next couple of years. You will train your body to burn through the calories, you will speed up your metabolism, and you will be allowed to eat anything you want because of the way your body has been trained. Trust me, it is definitely worth it.     To address your question: diet pills of any kind are dangerous to a fully developed body and of course, more harmful to an underdeveloped body. Right now what your body needs is lots of a fruits and vegetables. If you replace one of your meals with fruits and vegetables, you will lose the weight without the pills.    You can also try eating the actual acai fruit.. it's delicious! It has wonderful antioxidants that are great for every part of you. Eat it with banana and granola... so good!!|`|76075de38faee453846c87739c1ee336aa	it is healthy for all ages.  my children take the products on the website below|`|QZnekv7aaa	Now, I'm not saying your too young or anything or your just a kid because your not, but your 13. You don't need help to lose weight, you just have to hit the gym a couple days a week. And stop eating Cocoa Puffs for breakfast, pizza for lunch and oreos for dinner. Just eat in proportion.  If you can't get to a gym, then google some workouts for whatever you want to do and do it in your room.    As for the Acai Berry, about 95% of the time the stuff doesn't work, or it does, but you gain it back in a few weeks, plus more weight. Remember that about crash dieting, you just end up gaining more weight.
DFJ9m4WKaa	Well the fighting makes me wonder what the home life is like. If there is a lot of fighting going on their or if you're just having a hard time finding a positive way to express your emotions you can be prone to out burst of anger. Maybe talk to your school counselor?    Otherwise, more than likely, these feelings you are having are a result of bodily changes through puberty. It is possible you could have an adrenal disease or adrenal deficiency disorder. But it is far more likely that you are just going through puberty. People experience all kinds of weird behaviors and changes when they go through it. I don't think any two people ever experience puberty the same way.    If you're concerned enough about it, go to your local doctor and have him do some blood work just to make sure nothing is really wrong.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Maybe whilst your mind is saying one thing, your body is having other ideas. Namely that it wants to protect itself and not get involved.      Or. possibly, that you're used to it, and having ascertained that it's not a real flight or sight situation, you body doesn't see the need to waste a precious resource.    More importantly: why would you wanna get in fights, anyhow? Take up kick boxing if that's an urge you need fulfilled.|`|HN5mJlbbaa	try seeing a doctor|`|AiOOVdnbaa	i dont think that is possible...  um do things that you wont usaully do...  go to a shooting range and fire some rounds that should he your heart pumpin|`|W2z5dCrmaa	Your body is in good cardiovascular condition so your pulse rate and blood pressure doesn't necessarily go up with stress or pressure.    Mine is the same from swimming and choreography so my system is the same as yours.    Adrenaline isn't part of the sexual experience, and powerful stimulants work against sexual performance. The pulse rate increase for most is the sexual excitement....totally different from the adrenaline experience.    My sexual experiences with my Lady are just amazing without my heart going bonkers. The feeling is out of this world and that's what you go by.    By being in awesome shape Man, you will likely never notice a really high pulse rate, and in resting you will have a way lower one than most Dudes...That's really good Man, and one of the benefits of being in shape. Your heart is strong and moves more blood with fewer pulses.    Take care Man    Me! :- )

Warm up with cardio, do the weights, then cool down again with cardio to get a nice workout. To make this all better, make sure to alternate which muscles you exercise. For example, do not just do abs one week, arms another, etc. Doing this will make your body sort of immune to the workouts because it will learn where to build muscle and such based on what you've done lately. If that makes any sense... Make sure that when you lift, change it up often to keep your body working.    http://www.shelterpub.com/_fitness/_offi...    http://mapmyfitness.ninemsn.com.au/artic...    http://www.exrx.net/WeightTraining/Chang...    http://www.ellecanada.com/Trends/default...|`|3g2ng8Ksaa	Cardio first|`|L2pkns9maa	Cardio... it will make you look fat if you grow muscle under fat|`|WTf0caplaa	Well, even the scientific community who has done extensive studies on this are in disagreement.

So you "abs" will add weight, Stick with weights and look into how to use them, depending on how you use them will determine whether or not you'll get "cut" or just put on muscle mass.

Weights will build muscle. The best routine is 3 days a week, taking a day off between each workout session (or work different muscle groups on alternating days...your muscles need a day of rest to build up...if you work the same muscles two days in a row, you will actually be suppressing your progress)    Make sure you have a balanced weight routine (for instance, if you worked on your triceps, but not your biceps, you would be building your muscles unevenly...this could result in injury)    you can work on abs, chest, arms and back simultaneously...you can easily do all in under 20 minutes...simply lift as much weight as you can in about 12 reps (if you can do more than 12 reps at a certain weight, up the weight until you can only do 12 reps)    Some people do multiple sets of reps...this is fine if you enjoy lifting. If you don't have the time or inclination, though, you can get easily 75%-85% of the benefit in one set of reps, after that, additional reps deliver diminishing return, so why bother doing them unless you love it or are in an EXTREME hurry to build muscle?    All this being said, cardio is an important part of physical fitness and it would be wise to work some cardio in for your overall health (unless you are already getting cardio through sports or other daily activity)
OBFyz3z8aa	Well they can't advertise things that don't work, especially if they have guarantees. This is 2009 and they can't sell fake things over commercials and stuff, they can get sued. Plus, they've been around for years, so obviously it works. I see why not and check for guarantees. If there is no chance, request your money back. I have heard that the taking of the medical enhancements could create a faster ejaculation time though or cause pain in the penis area, but I'm not quite certain.

There is nothing on the market that will give a guy a larger erection. NOTHING.    The problem is that 'suppliments' are not regulated by the FDA, so many on the market can insinuate false claims. My understanding is that some of the so called 'penis enlargement pills' on the market may potentially allow the penis to hang longer in its flacid state. Meaning a less constricted 'softie' -- but still not as big as it gets when erect. NO PILL is going to increase the size of the erection that any guy currently has.    Unfortunately, guys think too much about penis size, wishing they had bigger ones, and fall prey to con artists waiting to cash in.    What you could do is find a way to bring up the topic. Maybe if you see the commercial again together... and say something like what you said before, but add, 'you know there's no such a thing ...it's so playing on guys' insecurities'. Let him know that because girls don't have a penis that they don't sit around thinking about size. If it seems 'normal' to them and does what it's supposed to do then that that's where it begins and ends.    To women, size (and caring about size) seems to be somewhat relative to what they have personally experienced. The only women I have known that have thought that 'size matters' have been ones that have happened to have dated guys that were exceptionally well endowed ... AND ... even they have said that they never really thought about size before having the personal experience.    However, men in general can become pre-occupied with penis size, especially if they fall on the smaller side of 'average'. Just read the first chapter of THE BOOK, 'Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask'.    For the guys out there that are not willing to accept the hand they were dealt, so to speak, there are some penis enlargement regimens that require much dedication, time and commitment, that promise marginal results at best. I'm referring to things like vaccum pumping, stretching devices and exercises like jelqing.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	You're trying to find the Wizard at the end of The Yellow Brick Road.

All these pills do is give you a bit better bloodflow, so the erections will get a bit harder, maybe adding a bit of size, but they don't do much beyond that.  especially if he is young, he probably already gets the max out of his erections, so it wont be much of a difference.    The only thing that could give some size, is penis enlargement exercises.  those take a lot of time though, like, years, but they do work.  you might gain a good jump in size the first few months though, the usual stuff is half and inch in girth and length over like...4 months or so, but it slows down after that.

I know it seems to simple to be true, but in my case at least that was the case.  What I FINALLY found to work was to use a very hydrating shampoo, and a very rich conditioner.  I tried all of the expensive stuff, both from the hair dresser, and specialty stores.  I found two that work.  Frederic Fekkai Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioners. It did work, and the same brand also has a specialty hair tonic that comes in little ampules.  I had moderate success with it.  If your budget requires less expensive products, (mine did) I found that Neutrogena has some products that are awesome.  On a daily basis I use Triple Cream Lather Shampoo, and Daily Deep Conditioner.  It is awesome stuff, and this winter I have barely been itchy at all.  Once a week, I also use their purifying shampoo, and extra hydrating conditioner.  Optional, but just for precautionary measures, I just do it.      Additionally, my dermatologist and hair dresser both, advised that I do not use super hot water to wash my hair, as that can exacerbate the dry skin.      I wish you the best of luck, I know how maddening it can be.  Thanks.|`|EbWWII65aa	You're a tomato|`|WmkG0on3aa	i have this same problem, its usally this time of year when the air is so dry my scalp gets dry and really itchy, use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, like dove or treseme i use tresseme and it works really well|`|c693952658cf76c32400a937ed4c2b64aa	your just out of luck.sorry|`|TXcxOyMsaa	the first thing you should try is using a shampoo that has no dye or sent to it, like ones for sensitive skin to check out the allergy thing. If its not that, ask your doctor. are you getting sunburned? it could be burned skin peeling off, i never thought to keep my scalp protected from the sun when i moved to florida, because i have dark thick hair, but one day i went to wash it and it stung and itched, i burned it. the water in the shower may even burn you.|`|SVDUZc4daa	Tea tree oil.|`|NJLKLeeZaa	Okay the most common answer especially in winter conditions with chilly wind: DRY SCALP. This is especially the case if you don't like to wear a hat/have relatively frizzy/dry hair.     Try head and shoulders special moisturizing shampoo for dry scalp. It helps a lot
rtQCrk1Laa	I have a body groomer, and I like it! if you go over the same spot a few times, it gets silky smooth! I like it way better than a razor! The razor loses sharpness and it misses spots and can only get certain directions...but the bodygroomer gets it all in a few swipes!    I'm unsure about growing rate...I'd say it takes longer for it to grow back, but I don't know...I'm just not that hairy because I'm only 18, but I use it to trim my "lower area" with the closest shave without making it bald down there. The only downside is that the bodygroomer cannot be used on your face! So you'll still have ti buy both!    I'd have to go with the BODYGROOMER!!!
21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	if the pus becomes dark yellow/green and the piercing site becomes painful and hot to the touch you should see a doctor.   otherwise continue with your after care and it should subside within about a week.     make sure you aren't touching your lip or the jewelry without washing your hands first.|`|mAp90hEeaa	Crust is not a sign of healing, it is a sign that the tissues are leaking some fluid and it depends on whether the fluid is clear or thick yellow.  No crust should be allowed to form if you are cleaning the area appropriately twice a day.  If it is more swollen than right after the piercing and there is any thick yellow stuff coming out of it, then you need to see your doctor and get an antibiotic.|`|ldAeDaYdaa	use listerine to rinse
8hIUOajLaa	Stretching is your best bet,it lets blood flow into the muscles after your workout, wich speeds up recovery time and can help the muscles grow. As well as keeping flexible is always a positive.  Dont wait for the muscle to cool down, as it is not good to stretch a 'cold' muscle and you will not get the best results after.    If you are working out to gain muscle, then stretching can help by slightly expanding the fascial sheath around the muscle.|`|WhlwZeiXaa	you must have a cool down period with light weights or any light workout.  dont stretch right afterwards, if anything wait until the next day.    ok for a while now stretching has always been taught as necessary for before and after a workout, and although stretching before is good (for flexibility), it's not going to prevent injury.  flexibility will prevent injury, but there's no immediate effect like people seem to think there is.  you need to do a warm-up before exercise and a cool-down afterwards, and like i said, don't stretch immediately afterwards.|`|0a8a4dd17ec2226bd801888dd10c50d2aa	Stretch before and after the workout.|`|qUjo3J9waa	its better if u stretch so your muscles expand and dont tighten up    and try to get some protein shakes so u build muscle. =]|`|0QbAiQwhaa	I reckon cool down first then before bed after a shower do some light stretching to loosen up your muscles, Doing this will make your muscles less tense, when they are tense you can actually be more prone to injury, that causes you to stop working out for awhile, and when you miss one week of training its actually like losing 3 weeks...
b9tefuosaa	hey, i have been on the drug since early december last year. as you probably know, there is an inflammatory stager but this passes. i got all the common side effects - dryness, eye pain, back pain etc and its getting better. as you get older, it should go, before the age of 30 sometiems!
vJBEnFVzaa	The cherry popping the first time you have sex is kind of a myth.. Your cherry pops long before you become sexually active. It also depends on how active you are but it can occur at any moment and you wont even know it. For most women when their cherry is popped it's not a flow like a period it's more of a few drops of blood and that's it. Theres no big deal about it. Nothings wrong with you. And it probably will hurt (depending on his size) and if you use tampons on a monthly basis because your not really stretched out. Have fun and be safe.|`|BLQsD0w5aa	Some girls are born without cherries. Only very few though.|`|k16dVbV6aa	MANY TIMES IT POPS LONG BEFORE SEX....IT CAN POP IF YOU USE TAMPONS OR HAVE A HARD FALL LIKE A BIKE ACCIDENT...MOST OF THE TIME YOU MAY NOT EVEN KNOW IT HAPPENED.|`|NcLV4Jmuaa	not everyone cherry will pop at the first time.  it depends if you are a very active person or not.  since the cherry is very soft and vulnarable, it can break any time when you are doing any kind of sports.  yes, all first timer will feel pain for the first time.  sometimes it will go until the 10th times then it won't hurt as much.  it depends on the person.|`|jvfpF9feaa	Its also depends on the size of your man...mine didn't pop until the 3rd guy i slept with...lame huh?
Vp2tJrEaaa	when i first had sex i did not bleed a lot, it just depends on the girl some girls bleed a lot, and some girls hardly bleed at all. If you continue to bleed then i would go see a doctor, or if it hurts to pee go see a doctor.|`|oluzjSgjaa	you shouldn't have let him stick it in like that.     you body needs to be sexually aroused by lots of foreplay first for quite a long time before your vagina is ready for penetration, especially when you are doing it for the first time.    often you do bleed first time and it can be because your hymen gets torn.   that can happen if he does not understand how to arouse you properly and go gently.    i would wait until you are older , and you find a partner who will care for your sexual needs properly,   and not just stick it in, cos he thinks its good for him to do that|`|N7xKowJYaa	the hymen is just a thin flap of skin, so the size of it is not a factor.  if it is torn during sex, that's when any bleeding would occur.    IF you are only bleeding when you pee you might have a bladder or urinary tract infection though so you should get that checked out.  if you have one and it is not treated it can spread to your kidneys and it is not fun!!!|`|HioSPhb2aa	you could have some kind of infection go see a doctor|`|wib5QmxPaa	The same exact thing happened to me the first time I had sex. I bled a little bit, but not much. The 3rd time I had sex my hymen completely broke and I bled a lot. Your hymen probably hasn't completely broken yet.|`|QYb4S7gGaa	I had a mild infection once; my girlfriend scratched the inside and there was a small laceration. The doctor didn't subscribe any pills or anything. He told me to wade around in hot bathwater for five minutes everyday, and that should soothe the infection.    It's common for girls to bleed. I didn't bleed that much though. I really think you should go check it out with a gyno anyway.|`|9cYrY2xjaa	it didnt hurt at all my first time. it sounds like you have an infection.

To shave correctly and avoid the chance of ingrown hairs, nicks, etc:   Use shaving gel/foam and not ordinary soap.   Use a decent shaver (a new blade)   Moisturise and exfoliate afterwards.    If any sign of ingrown hair - see your doctor... it's nothing a short course of anti-biotic wont cure :-)Hope this helped!      Michelle|`|k65dc6Elaa	i dont think it really matters  but i would say that girls shouldnt sleep with panties(at least i dont)  you wear them all day and when you sleep you should let your vagina breath  its true!
yTI5bKAwaa	i know you mean. At 14, most of the girls don't have boob or they're starting to have them, and i was the "lucky" early bloomer. it gets kinda annoying but if it isn't affecting your health, like a C or a D cup; you shouldn't reduce it. Later, after puberty or a weight lost, they might even shrink!  Only reason to reduce is if it is affecting you. my friend had DDD/E?, and it made her back hurt, so she got breast reduction. If you are seriously in pain from your boobs, you should bring it up to your mother and maybe father. As long as it isn't for vanity, I'm sure they'll let you.|`|8ytLLHV4aa	Firstly, you need to begin to love yourself for who you are.  That's the first step.  Big breasts are beautiful, and equally as beautiful as small or average ones.    A reduction could giver horrible scars.  i've heard stories of girls getting horrible scars, but saying it was worth it because they were smaller, but then their breasts grew back to the size htey were before the reduction.  So they were in the same boat, only with scars.    No one is too big or too small with anything.  Love who you are.    if it's back problems, fix your posture.  Don't slouch and try to hide them, you will mess up your back.|`|66KUgS24aa	do push ups till your arms fall off  this will work the fat off (breasts are fat and mammary glands)  and work the muscle behind the breast  and essentially make them smaller|`|ZA18KoC9aa	you could get a breast reduction when your are older and if you are uncomfortable talk to your mum about it.|`|EiBiu5Rraa	I have a huge rack too, and Im all off balance becuase they are so much bigger than the rest of my body. You really learn to love them as you grow up. Try wearing clothes with plunging necklines, show off your awsome cleavage and makes them look smaller.  Dont worry honey, when you get older you will love them|`|Qc2VO9G9aa	Your young, you are 14.  i don't think you should get one right now, wait until your older.  but if you really want one, talk to your parents.  it comes down to you, and if you want to do it.|`|KQPDtrw8aa	You are too young to get a reduction, for two reasons, one; you might not be done growing and two; there is a good chance that you will feel differently the older you get, most women wish that they had your problem and are paying thousands to have that done. Right now, just remember that those comments made by friends or others is due to immaturity, or even envy. Don't allow them to make you feel bad about yourself. =)

Pehaps you ate something else that upset your tummy or you had Norwalk virus.      Norwalk prevention:    Norwalk virus  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)    The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.    PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.    The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.    It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)    Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.    If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.    To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.    People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)    The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!    TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.
ebQJsYTxaa	Yes, you can go to school.  Chickenpox is no longer contagious once all the blisters have crusted.
NBJXduAAaa	No, sweetheart. Ibuprofen is a pain reliever, and it works through your blood stream. However, it's not going to irritate it in the same way it would a stomach ulcer. (Lol.) Ibuprofen can cause stomach irritation in some people, but that has to do with the stomach lining, and would absolutely not have the same effects on a canker sore. As the previous answerer said, don't crush it and rub it on your sore. (Why would you?)     So, although Ibuprofen certainly won't help you, it's not going to be a problem if you've already taken it.    To help a canker sore, you need to treat either the irritation or the cause of the sore. Go to the drug shop and ask a pharmacist what they would recommend. There are creams and such that you can apply. Try not to scrape it with your teeth or bite it by mistake either, as that certainly will not help the healing process. (; Good luck, I hope this answer helps you!|`|CoiOMTiBaa	technically canker sores are mouth ulcers and IBU is generally dangerous for stomach ulcers so I would say no. Under no circumstances should you break it up and put it on the sore, even if you decide to take it. They make multiple good medicines for canker sores, and even just getting some orajel to numb your mouth would be a good idea. Also, make sure to clean your mouth out very good!
9FnAD0jVaa	S.O.L|`|uX5hO3d8aa	You're screwed. I've had friends who have tried buying 24 hour detox kits from head shops and they never work.    What you can buy is fake urine kits that come with heaters. The urine is stored in a condom taped to your dick and when it's time to pee in the cup you pull it out and prick it with a needle and it even sounds like you're peeing. I supposed you could do the same with a clean friend's urine. The kit comes with a heater to heat the urine to real body temperature too.    The thing is those kits are illegal to use. My friend bought one and didnt read the instructions and didnt wait long enough for the fake urine to heat up and when he gave the cup of fake urine to the testers they checked the temp and saw it was too low and knew it was fake. They called the cops and the cops had to watch him while he peed for real into a new cup (I guess that's drug test policy). And on top of that, by the time this was going on the heater was getting really hot and frying up his leg.    So long story short, you're screwed.|`|BN5nW4rZaa	screwed bro|`|wdUhwD61aa	Haha, water isn't going to help you.|`|wvKJLce8aa	You can go to a drug store and buy stuff that will flush out your system in 24 hours.

T8oR2N9faa	use the F.I.T.T method (frequency,intensity,time,type)    after doing the same type of exercise for awhile your body adapts to it and there for your fitness is not increased. Therefore by changing increasing one of the above your fitness will increase. Also although walking is good a 1 mile walk only burns 100 calories and you need to burn 3,500 calories to lose one pound of fat. 60-90 mins a day of intense exercise is truly the best although you have to work your way to that. Overloading doesnt mean overtraining and hurting yourself is the last thing you want to do. Some suggestions i have is play pick up basketball with friends, swim, go for runs, still walk but do something in addition to cardio alifting weights is also important.    As for the diet even though youre a vegetarian, its still all abut staying in your calorie intake limit which is between 1850-2000. if you want to lose weight cut out 300-500 cals but no more that that starving yourself will just result in binging or an eating disorder    hope this helps =]|`|Lc9vRplVaa	good start.   maybe you can start to incorporate healthier meals as well as cutting out junk food

nZCT32XCaa	For most of the people, stress has several effects on the body. If you ask me, I usually want to vomit (and that's just one of the effects) when I'm stressed. When I'm very stressed, I get the feeling that I regularly want to spit.   I know it'll sound odd, but I discovered (and I'm sure I'm not the first to notice this) that both spit/vomit is related to a feeling of something wanting to come out of your system.   In my opinion, coughing is how you deal with this.    But after all, I would finish, with what I always said to myself, when I was asking myself the same question(Why is this?): "You have no idea what stress is capable of". And the effects are different for everybody...    Take care!
2o0A5M1Maa	COPD is not curable. It can regress from time to time, but there's absolutely no cure for it.

ERaIVdN8aa	Burning could be caused by a number of things.  Tell-tale sign of a yeast infection is "cottage-cheese"-like discharge and itching.  I would wait a few days and see if you develop any more symptoms before you do anything to treat it.  It could be a UTI, but since you only have the minor burning, it's hard to tell.  Like I said, it could be a number of things - from vaginal dryness to a yeast infection or UTI.  Yeast infections' symptoms usually subside during your period b/c the change in pH cannot support the bacteria.  It is likely to return when your period is over however.  The easiest way to treat a yeast infection is to get Monistat in the feminine care aisle @ the store, however if you've never had one it's recommended to get it formally diagnosed by a Dr.  Monistat comes in a few different forms including an injectable capsule, or injectable ointment.  You can also research "natural" treatments online....there are lots of home remedies that can help.  Some say eating a lot of yogurt with natural cultures can clear up a yeast infection.  There are many things you can try, but the fastest and most reliable is Monistat or a prescription from your Dr.  I know it's not a pleasant experience, but it's something you have to deal with as a woman.|`|K9Nqkfh4aa	It definitely sounds more like a UTI than a yeast infection since there's no itching!  UTI's make you feel like you have to pee all the time and when you pee it HURTS even if you can't pee very much. you'll definitely know by tomorrow if things get worse. You might want to call your doctor just in case tomorrow and get seen-- they do a quick urine test and will know right away! A UTI would not be fun to get stuck with over the weekend!|`|N7xKowJYaa	if it burns when you pee, it's a uti probably not a yeast infection.  more antibiotics for you!!
Qx1YgtI5aa	pay attention to waht you eat. I am a very very very firm believer that food can cause acne despite what others say. You may have a gluten or wheat intolerance that is causing acne. You may also be having a bad reaction to the hormones in dairy or meat, or your body may not tolerate simple carbs such as white flour or processed sugar, and artificial sugar(splenda etc) causing your pores to over produce oil, too much fat in your diet can do this as well. My sister always breaks out if she has too much cheese, and my cousin's skin always clears up when she gives up meat for a while. My skin does great when I lay off the sugar and wheat. My best advice is to go off each thing for two weeks and see if you see a difference. I've done it, for each and found that wheat definitally makes me break out. some people also tend to break out with spicy foods or caffeine, so it all depends on you. Drink tons of water and lots of carrot juice( you don't have too, but some say it helps, i think it helps). Good luck, keep your hands off your face, your hair out of your face, oil free make up (try not to wear make up...easier said than done tho i know) and oil free shampoo/conditioner|`|c693952658cf76c32400a937ed4c2b64aa	take soap and water and wash your face. it works great|`|Qc2VO9G9aa	proactiv solution, i use to have ancne and one i got it, my face was better. Even tho i might not work for eveyone it is worth a try.|`|SVDUZc4daa	I had terrible acne until I stopped drinking milk. I don't know what your diet consists of, but usually our skin is aggravated by what we put into our bodies. You can look it up online and see the correlation for yourself.   Also, try to drink lots of water to flush out the toxins. Try a vegetarian diet for a while and see if that helps.
9974c2220f95f60347be458baa52c584aa	Actually, regardless of what others have posted. Your friend may be just unhygienic.  Cirrhosis, which is the very end stage of liver disease cause many problems with chemicals in the body, to include the brain. Most people with cirrhosis start to feel tired and lethargic and don't shower as often or lose a sense of proper hygiene. This is very common. They actually don't realize they have forgotten about their hygiene until they are reminded.     Now they do turn yellow, like the one person suggested, but that is caused by jaundice, and it does not omit a smell. Fetor Hepaticus on the other hand does. This is a very late sign of liver failure and most assuredly is a fatal sign. It is also known as the breath of the dead.  The reason being is it happens when a person with liver problems is dying or is very near death. This smell however is usually a pungent smell. It is very strong and noticeable.      If your friend has this smell, he should seek medical attention immediately.  Especially with cirrhosis. Any change in normal behavior with a cirrhosis patient should be evaluated.|`|l700dey7aa	thats no good stay away from him LOL|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	it means, your friend is in an advanced stage of liver cirrhosis.  the rotten egg smell is from hydrogen sulfide,coming from inside the body.not because your friend is dirty,this happens to all people with liver failure.  normal liver cells will change into scar tissue=cirrhosis|`|9wbsjbioaa	It's a hormonal off balance that can be fixed with certain meds. But if he has Cirrhosis of the liver, there are clearly worse issues there than just body odor.|`|mAp90hEeaa	His liver is unable to filter toxins out of his bloodstream because it is damaged and these build up in his skin - often giving a yellow or green cast to the skin.  There is nothing he can do to change this and often, when a person reaches this stage, they do not have much longer to live.
AA10725882	Leg or legs?  If it is a petechial rash, I would wonder about her platelet count.  But in your previous question you only mentioned the white count being low on the CBC that has been done.  We don't have that CBC report.  We don't know which white cells are low.  It is impossible to tell what the rash may be from this small amount of information.      The physician who can see the rash, look at the blood smears, check all the lab work, and obtain a complete medical history would be a much better person to answer this question.
j14m6Ptnaa	Yes, it's possible.  I grew into my mid-20's.|`|eHJRNbkxaa	It's still growing, alright.   Puberty and the growing usually stops in the early to mid-twenties.  Body hair will always continue to grow, just like your head of hair will.   Sperm will always be produced throughout your life and I've think you can still grow! No worries!
eHJRNbkxaa	Yeah! I do think you may have a chance of being just a bit taller than your father and maybe the same height as your uncles, perhaps.  You shouldn't be at all concerned about it though, more like happy that you're tall. I'm almost 16 and I'm 5'6", okay? :P    I think your shoe size may also grow, if not, then it's nothing to be worried about either.
W2z5dCrmaa	It's normal, and many people don't have sex b4 they are with the one they are marrying or until they are married.     I didn't have sex until I was with the Lady to b my wife. I was 21.    If you can do that, it's the best way ever because you have no std things to worry about, and you can start out with your first and most beautiful experience as being condom free with full contact and no fears. By the time that you are getting married, real birth control is in place, and you go with the best for first experience, and with the one that you Love as well.    They say that when you Make Love, that every person whom you have ever had sex with is in that bed with you in memory, and you compare and a certain smell, color, or sound can bring some other person up besides the one that you want to mean it all for you.    I can't say that I didn't masturbate though. That's part of what helped me to stay from having sex. I'm sure that I would have had sex otherwise.    I still can't and won't judge anybody who had some sex before marriage.  We all come from different places and things in life.    Hope you meet your goal Dude    Me! :- )|`|zB0lNyc3aa	easy. JUST AVOID AND DONT and control!!!!!|`|pJ3TNB6uaa	It's fine. That's your choice to wait and people should respect that.|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Its perfectally normal. SOme people just want to wait to have sex till marriage.|`|AA11675747	it's normal...i wouldn't wait until marriage but there is no need to rush|`|8DzCWuZ5aa	... of course it's "normal". Stupid, but entirely normal.|`|h21PoIcraa	Yes, I would say at least half of all 17 year old's have not had sex.|`|8UcMR12haa	its ok, sex just comes natural, you don't need to know what your doing, you just do it, its like kissing. and thats perfectly normal, i lost my virginity at 17 anyways. But yeah, theres nothing weird about wanting to wait till marage, lots of people do, theres even this 40 year old chick i saw on tv who has never had sex, and won't masterbate, because she's waiting till marage. so don't worry about it :) having it at marage will be very romantic, good luck with all that :)|`|RRucp8rzaa	If you want to wait its completely fine i suggest you should do it with someone your truly love =) . My friend had sex with his girlfriend and now shes pregnant even though they protected sex so you should wait till marriage so it can be way more special =).|`|k16dVbV6aa	keep it that way.....sex comes with way too many strings attached......it can cause problems if your not in a love committed marriage.......that is the way God intended it and you should be proud.|`|7711ada9c95024647e03b8a6369021a5aa	saving it till marriage is a completely stupid idea.  have sex when you feel like it and don't feel guilty for it because its NATURAL!!!    other than that, yes its normal, there are heaps of people that haven't done it at your age.    plus, i think your stupid for refusing sex|`|EOHP3pHmaa	Yes, it's definately normal. You should do what you want to do. and only have sex when and with whom you choose to.|`|iYDPodN0aa	Dude your cool man theres nothing to be worried about|`|jgLCzq7Iaa	i am 17 myself never had sex waiting till marriage too i guess for me its my culture cause its a big thing for people who think its not well they are just pimps and hoes sorry for the language just control your self worry about your studies that takes the edge about thinking about it|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	You're ok, Bubba!  Not a thing wrong with that.  I was 21 & had sex for the first time on my wedding night.  Too bad there aren't more teens with your sense of pride.|`|f1j9TmlNaa	Yes it is normal the first time I had sex I was 21.  That is because that is when I found the right person.  A lot of people wait until they are married and that is ok as well.  You should not get pressured into having sex you should want to do it with the right person.|`|oTHGgowsaa	haha of course it's normal, some people have it at 12 years old some people have it at 30 years old, it's best when you do it with somebody you truly love though, that's for sure.|`|dBoC8fR2aa	You are still young. How can you been not sure, but I am sure of you, you have refused sex 3-5 times.|`|jfM61TUpaa	You will someday. I, however, will never get to experience that.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Yes it is    Harriet|`|i6RlYFo7aa	i'm 19 and have said NO to sex as well  hey at least we wont get STDs|`|OBFyz3z8aa	Completely normal and don't rush it. Once you start having sex, you'll want it like all the time, it's a horrible addiction in some cases you'll feel that you love that person, but in reality, you just love them because you have sex which can create problems like "you not being able to see that she is using you." It's a great experience and I never believed in sex after marriage, but there's nothing wrong with waiting.|`|tkI7ZEccaa	YES completely i wish more teens were like u. Your parents have raised you well.|`|2TiwAfPvaa	yea....    but i suggest practice beating your meat and holding it for as long as possible..    because when you do..OMG...    best feeling ever
h59Bc4wfaa	Not that I have ever heard. I did my kegels too, and have always done them during sex...I would ask another doctor about this.
yUoa678Gaa	I'd suggest that if there is a timing correlation to the installation and you getting headaches there must be something up. I'm not sure if pressure is the issue or maybe there's something airborne causing it.     Get to a doctor and have some bloodwork done to see if you have toxins in your system - and for our headaches try chamomille (spellcheck?) tea.|`|f3c8sNYxaa	If you're having dental problems (such as your bite is incorrect), that can also stimulate headaches.      Try disconnecting the fans for a day (as a test) and see what happens.
LhkjM9lHaa	- Haha, I wouldn't worry. Unless these girls are extremely seasoned players, they won't have the skill to aim for your crouch during a game. Now there always is a chance that it might happen, but I doubt it. And even if it does, crouch shots usually hit when your crouching your pants will be stretched out and you won't feel anything -or- hit dead center and then the paint will usually break on your zipper before any real damage is done. So just relax, and try to get them out first. Have fun bro.|`|iqNcXWsOaa	You defiantly need it!! You know women.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Stuff a sock down there, protection and bragging rights|`|XuJPqu1Xaa	I never once wore it and never suffered a mishap, and I was into the game, like I was legit lol.    your fine unless they are like shooting for ur junk after you've gotten them out already|`|Z1lyx2Iiaa	i always tuck my meat into my bung hole when i do paint ball.|`|wA91qAkcaa	Not really. if you really are pretty freaked out then you could just go prone, ( lay on the floor ), and eliminate them. Paintballs don't realy hurt so just lay aload of paint on them, tht will give you cover for about 2-3 secs then make for a bunker. hope tht helps :P|`|DJThkWRTaa	it's not as bad as it sounds!
uLbytPFDaa	It actually sounds that you might have sensitive skin.    Toothpaste actually does work because it dries out pimples, but if you are more concerned about the redness try a toner and face lotion that works for sensitive skin.  I have the same problem with acne.    Also, try Camfophanic (it is meant for cold sores and I might have spelled it wrong) or Hydrogen Peroxide for some of your bigger pimples.    Also, if you wear make-up use the lighter powder kinds (better for complexion.|`|aA5rlNUTaa	Topoth paste only works if it is the paste and not the creamy type like closeup.  the reason it works is because as it dries it pulls moisture out of the skin causing the skin under it to dry...hence the pimple which is nothing more than puss matures toward the skin surface faster as the tooth paste draws it upward because of its moisture.  For really good results mix some white tooth paste with rubbing achahol in a spare lotion jar.  then use it as you would dry cream on the pimple area.|`|t6pEU9fNaa	NOXZEMA, this shiz is awesome! i swear it got rid of mine and it cleans ur pores :]|`|2xX782sQaa	Do not try toothpaste!! In high school I had really bad acne and so one of my friends recommended me to try toothpaste...so desperately I did. The results were that my pimples had gone down BUT it badly scarred my face. I had less acne but now I have red blotches....|`|a2Ih10O1aa	I think it's best to use everything in the area it was produced for. I've never tried toothpaste for zits though. It probably works since people are saying so. but I recommend you stick with your acne medication since it seems to be working for you.  if you want to try out the toothpaste though, try not to put it on before a special occasion. there's always a chance that your skin will have a reaction especially if you have sensitive skin and since your skin is so young. like if you're staying home this weekend, dab it on on Friday before you go to sleep.  it's always best to ask your doctor though. let me know if the toothpaste works:)|`|C4AUC5vGaa	Use the paste formula of toothpaste. At night put a dab on the zit, let it dry, go to bed, in the morning wash your face. The zit should be gone. It really does work.|`|UoMdPH3iaa	yes it works. believe me|`|SVDUZc4daa	Toothpaste did not work for me. Proactive made my acne worse. There is only one thing that worked for me and that was eliminating milk from my diet. For some reason, milk aggravated my skin and caused me to have some serious acne/boils/scars. Once I stopped drinking it, my skin began to clear up. You either need to find out what's aggravating your skin and causing the outbreaks so that you can eliminate it from your diet, or you can just go see a dermatologist.|`|atVzUGqkaa	I've tried all the acne stuff. Almost all of it made it worse. The problem with the spot treatments is that they dry your skin out which causes more acne! Trust me - do this:    1. Wash your face at night with that orange oil-free Neutrogena acne face wash.  2. In the morning, apply a moisturizing sunblock (like Garnier Nutritioniste spf 28 anti-sun-damage daily moisture lotion)    Put on your eye/lip makeup but skip the concealer, powder and whatnot.
zmVg3Q3Caa	I agree you need to gargle with warm salt water. Table salt is  known as sodium chloride, a combination of sodium and chloride. The chloride which is chlorine kills bacteria. So if you gargle you will stop the bacteria from populating on your tonsil and spreading.|`|95c460c9bbd2609530690f8e73215021aa	make a mixture of vinegar and salt.  gurgle often especially if aches start to nag you.  also take the strepsil tablets in candy form .  meanwhile be spiritual.  i mean avoid sadness, bitterness, hurt, anxiety , hatred as the chemical reaction in the body produces such virus.|`|ERaIVdN8aa	Go to the Dr. and get an antibiotic....if that's not possible, gargle as many time a day as possible w/ warm salt water.  Also, tylenol sore throat (it's a liquid - blue in color) is AWESOME!  I used it instead of my pain meds when I got my tonsils out.  Worked great!  This won't cure your problem, but will help with the symptoms.
bfb88160853edd441f13c069712a5c16aa	I have heard you can but in 10 years, I haven't.  From the start I was using it 5 or 6 times a day and after 10 years I'm still doing that.  So, I don't know many people that take their albuterol inhaler as much as I do.  I can't and won't use those long acting inhalers either.  Some people say my asthma isn't under control, but I think this works ok.    So, how many times a day are you taking the inhaler?|`|eDykHvX1aa	With an inhailer, i dont think your body will become dependent on it because its mainly used to lessen the restriction of your airways.
nP2402xpaa	Stand in front of a mirror, lift up your eyelid, and then tilt your head back. You should be able to see the lens. If you just lift your eyelid and leave your head facing straight then you could miss it.|`|RNG1cT8saa	do u feel it? because its possible it fell out, when i used to wear contacts i also thought it was gone behind my eye and i panicked, then i realized it was in the sink :P|`|y6gfkqSuaa	In the morning when your eye doctors office opens call them and tell them what happened.|`|JGLLkv5Naa	Yeah, that happened to me once in high school. I thought I took my contacts out because one was irritated, couldn't find the other one thought I dropped it, so I just wore my glasses. Well my eye was just aggravating the mess out of me all day until I decided to walk up to the office to call my mom so she could bring me to the doctor because it just wasn't a normal feeling. While on the way up to the office, I had my head tilted down because of the aggravation and I rolled my eye around and I felt something coming out the corner. What you think it was? It was my contact FOLDED up some kind of way coming out the side of eye. SO my advice to you is, if after awhile it doesn't come out, then go to the doctor because its only going to get unbearable. But, hopefully you just dropped it. Get a flashlight and shine around where you were. That makes the contact glisten. Hope this helps!

A healthy exercise program addresses all five aspects of physical fitness: aerobic endurance, muscular endurance, muscular strength, flexibility, and body fat composition.      ---  Exercise Recommendations for People Aged 18 to 64    Do both aerobic activities and strengthening activities.    Aerobic Activities  ? Do at least 10 minutes at a time.  ? You can combine moderate and vigorous activities.  ? Slowly build up the amount of time you do physical activities. The more time you spend, the more health benefits you gain. Aim for exercising twice as long as the minimum times below.   ? If you choose activities at a moderate level, do at least 2 hours and 30 minutes a week.   ? If you choose vigorous activities, do at least 1 hour and 15 minutes a week.    Muscle Strengthening Activities  Do these at least 2 days a week.  ? Include all the major muscle groups such as legs, hips, back, chest, stomach, shoulders, and arms.  ? Exercises for each muscle group should be repeated 8 to 12 times per session.    From the U.S. Federal government: http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/pdf/a...

Program, nutrition, supplements, recovery, all of it.  Everyone wants someone else to tell them how to get as big/fast/strong as possible and in as little time.  That's why a program that takes it all into account and gives you a bunch of DVDs to watch is so successful. There's no thinking involved! Just do what they tell you (which is all valid information by the way)     That's why programs like Weight Watchers and Nutrisystem are so successful with weight loss: They tell you or even give you every single thing you need to eat.    While the exercises and programs done in P90x and all the nutritional advice and recovery/supplement advice can be researched and done on your own, this program just puts it all in one box for you.|`|cQ8sLzzYaa	If you follow the nutrition and stay on the proper diet PLUS stay dedicated and follow the routine P90x will work. Its up to you whether this program works or not.
OySU2oAkaa	CARDIO CARDIO CARDIO. Go from doing pushups to jumping jacks to pushups to jumping jacks. Include a lot of multitasking and variation in your workouts. Running is good too but not for long distances..jog for 2 minutes then sprint for 30 seconds jog for 2 then sprint for 30 seconds.  Good old fashioned crunches work as well for the abs.    Drink plenty of water and cut out easy things like soda and late night snacks.    For more tips and suggestions check out http://i-dietandfitness.com

But 20mg for me makes me nauseous, still feel good though. One strange thing about hydrocodone is that your body does need time to get used to it. You may pop 10mg and feel good but a couple times later it will feel even better.     You feel wasted, but an energetic wasted and you are incredibly light.

Vicodin is a really nasty drug, in my opinion. Taking a large dose of vicodin just makes you feel really drowsy and clumsy like you're drunk. It can also make you feel really sick to your stomach and throw up. If you're not careful, you can possibly OD from it. If you want a buzz like vicodin, just get your favorite alcoholic beverage and sit around and drink till you don't feel like doing anything but sleeping. It's really not any different than that, and much less likely to kill you.|`|IpXsPG8qaa	i would take about 3 or 4 depending on your size..|`|CLGOjDaEaa	it all really depends on your weight.  i would take 4 and be good but it all depends on your weight!|`|TIi5R0v0aa	Depends on the concentration of the pills.

Don't push it though.|`|lmk3mKJgaa	I also hurt my ankle on Jan. 24, 2009 and I have been to the Dr. and they say use the crutches for a few days. If it has been almost a week I would do a follow-up and see what they say, if you cant get into your family doctor try going to a orthopedic. I have a sprain that they say was so bad that I would have been better off to have broken it, but now I am able to walk without crutches because I have what they call a Fracture Boot (where I live it can only be gotten from a orthopedic) and it really helps with the walking. My ankle still hurts really bad and the Tylenol and Motrin are not really helping. My foot and ankle are both still very swollen and bruised, but the walking is getting easier with the boot, the rest just takes time. But its something that may be worth a try for you. Hope this helped.

You burn 1500 calories a day just by doing your normal activities.  If you eat 5000, you would gain a pound.  5000-1500=3500.|`|067fa6dfc93e782fff815f1abe45eebaaa	Well by starving your body at 800 calories a day your body is in a fight or flight response.

Most women like to caress the clitoris. You can make a circular motion with one or two fingers on top of your clitoris, roll your clitoris between your thumb and forefinger or tab your clitoris with your index finger. Some girls like to stimulate their clitoris with a vibrator. Try different things and vary speed and pressure to discover what works best.  If the clitoris is too sensitive you can stimulate it indirectly by touching the skin around it.  Let your whole body take part: clench and relax your sex muscles, move your pelvis up and down, open or close your legs and use your other hand to caress others parts of your body. Try out different things to discover what feels good.   Make sure you are in a sexual mood when you start, thus increasing the effect of your stimulation.|`|SOrNshJFaa	When it comes to masturbation, anything goes!

211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	Oh, I hate that - Its painful and it makes you feel like crap!!  The doc is right, take the advil for the pain and it should help keep the fever down.    The fever is most likely because the cyst burst causing both the pain and the "infection" to come out.  Infection = fever.  Warm compress over the area will provide some comfort.  The pain should go away by the evening at the latest.  The fever should subside by the afternoon.  If this does not happen, call the doctor back and talk about something stronger for pain (if needed) and if an anti-biotic is necessary.    I see that you wrote this question at approximately midnight EST.  I am answering you at approximately 3 am EST.  So, fever should be almost normal within 12 hours MAX and pain should be all gone within 16 hours MAX.  If not - call the doc.    Good luck to your sister and I hope this helped you!!|`|eXJOdwzcaa	oh dear  that sounds like what happend to me.  im 16, so its a close age! haha    i was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian syndrome after having a surgery to remove so many systs on my ovaries  when she goes to the doctor, have them check her for that.  i had a fever and everything too.    i feel her pain, i feel bad for her,  it sucks.  and advil will not work, they told me that too.     i always had chills and i was nauseated and i had headaches and body aches.  it was bad.    good luck!

You need to go to the doctor.  I just tore mine last year and had to have surgery.  It sucked!  Be sure when you go to the doc to tell them to REPAIR it not to REMOVE any part of it.

kl6TlrcDaa	follow the acronym   R.I.C.E    Rest  Ice  Compression  Elevation      REST/COMPRESSION  splints are good, and can be bought in one size fits all at the pharmacy. use kling wrap to hold the splint on and keep the finger immobile    ICE   30 minutes on and at least 30 minutes off several times daily reduces swelling and inflammation by constricting blood vessels and reducing the presently increased blood flow to the area. This allows more of the bodie's healing energy to go directly into healing the tissues rather than into reducing inflammation. Always allow that 30 minutes free of ice for circulation to return to normal, and never keep the ice in direct contact with te skin because it can cause something simmilar to freezer burn/frostbite as odd as that may sound.    ELEVATION  above the level of the heart keeping the finger immobile allows fluid outside the cells (causing some of the swelling) to shift away from the injury. It also helps regulate blood flow which can cause the finger to become congested with increased circulating blood and add once again to the inflammation.|`|IDgSVPBxaa	You can make a makeshift splint out of a Popsicle stick and medical tape.  Or an elastic bandage will work fine too but you might what to go to the doctor just in case.
ohJH8t7aaa	The medication you are on is used for managing blood pressure. You mentioned you have some swelling in your ankles are you on any other blood pressure medications or antidiuretics for this condition?   Your pulse may be elevated due to the extra fluid on your body (such as your ankles, do you have swelling anywhere else?), because your heart has to work harder to keep up with the unequal fluid distribution.  I am not sure how old you are or if you have any medical conditions such as Congestive Heart Failure or an Kidney problems (which if no one has told you that, I don't say it to worry you)   Also as far as your chest discomfort, 2 factors I can think of maybe influencing your blood pressure. 1st one could be your pulse. Your pulse is high, but not extremly high, do you know what your avg pulse is? Look at your avg pulse and compare it to the 115, and see if there is really a big difference.  2nd have you had your blood pressure checked lately or do you have a blood pressure machine you have at home? If your blood pressure is elevated this could also be the cause of your chest discomfort, I would also suggest taking a asprin if you have one.  Another thing I am sure you know, try and keep your feet elevated, to help reduce the swelling in your ankles. Most importantly if the swelling and chest discomfort is very new and you have never experienced it before, then I would get ahold of the doctor as soon as possible or go the Emergency to be checked out.  I hope this is helpful information for you, I tried to provide the best of what I could based on the info you shared.|`|AA10774713	Yes that is a fast rate.  The average adult's pulse (for a farily healthy person) is around 60 beats per minute.  You should start an exercise routine and incorporate some cardio into it.  Over time, your heart will become stronger and cause it to pump less beats per minute, which is good.|`|dbCZkXZAaa	115 isnt that high  its not really anything to worry about, well i think so anyway      I used to suffer with palpitations & mine used to beat at about 220 p/m, thats when it was a worry  when it used to go back down to 100-115 i was in the safe zone    but if ur still worried seek a second opinion    hope this helps

The water around that chamber will raise in temperature by so many degrees, and that is what tells them how many calories are in that food.    Cans and boxes of foods are normally labeled, but something like cupcakes it is more difficult to tell the exact number of calories, unless they are made in mass volume, and the exact same size.

D: a D cup already, I don't want them any bigger!!    You're just a late bloomer, darling. There's really no reason to worry about it. Now, if you still haven't started by the time you're 16 or 17, see a doctor (female) so she can check for any hormonal imbalance as someone has already mentioned. If you get your period and it lasts for 7 or more months at a time (like, just continuous bleeding) then DEFINITELY see a doctor. It's happened to me several times before, and I'm anemic now because of it.|`|Qx1YgtI5aa	i was worried for a while too, both my mom and sister got their when they were twelve, they say you're period doesnt come until you are truly ready, I didn't get mine until I was sixteen, no worries, my cousin didn't get hers until she was nineteen, enjoy it while you can, you're body will know when it's ready. if your truly truly worried, talk to your doctor and he can look into hormone imbalance, but I wouldnt be too worried :)|`|l0zx4K42aa	No your a late bloomer, some girls don't get their till they are 18, you can estimate if you will have yours soon by how much pubic hair you have.

AA12327015	Not as many as the government tells you.   Why don't you Google it?|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I would say not that many, to be honest.  Lortab is a mixture of hydrocodone and acetominophen, and for most people, the amount of hydrocodone (or even oxycodone if talking about percocets) that would be needed for an opiate overdose wouldn't really be possible since they would have passed the lethal dose of tylenol in those pills and died from the tylenol, not the actual narcotic.      Most people who would be taking lortab, or any opiates would be doing it either because they need it for pain, or they would be taking it recreationally.  The recreational users would be the ones who would possibly overdose, but those people would be taking it because it makes them feel good, and the amount of pills that would make someone overdose would make them feel so uncomfortable due to the excessive tylenol, it just wouldn't happen.|`|xDOp37T7aa	Most people die from the acetaminophen in Lortab, not the hydrocodone.

Nature plays a little trick in that while your penis is growing, you get testosterone spikes that cause spontaneous erections. You don't even need to be thinking about anything, and up it comes ...in just seconds!  Haha!     The purpose of those by nature isn't to embarrass you, but rather so that the new growth in added and expanded hollow bodies of the penis can get filled out to max size to make for full str8 and even growth. If you wear briefs or tight underwear, that can't happen, and you end up with a curve in your gear. Switch to boxer shorts until you are done growing those parts. If you do this, the curve will straighten out and you will be at your best.    If you get a spontaneous erection in boxer shorts, it's easy to reach in, discretely and move your hard on up under the waste band of the shorts toward your belly button where no one will notice your condition and it will go back to resting later. Don't get ones with a really tight waste band, because, remember you want your pride and joy to be comfortable under that band. Boxer shorts are always better for your parts in daily activities for obvious reasons.     When it comes time in life to have foreplay with your lady prior to Making Love, you put on for the occasion, briefs, thong, or boxer briefs...which ever one suits you best, as a show piece to impress you lady with your stuff. Something that is kind of tight, but has all kinds of expansion ability in the front pouch is the best kind to make your point! Haha!    Hope that helps Man..it sure did it for Me! :- )|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	HAHAHAHAHA!  Welcome to the world of puberty, Bubba!  There's not a thing you can do about it - learn to live with it.  Every guy on this planet has had this same problem at one time or another in their lives - and you are no exception.  A guy can sneeze & get an erection!|`|R1LvhhTeaa	Oh yes - how normal it all is!  Be happy about spontaseous erections - the day will come when they don't show up anymore - then down the road will come a time when nothing shows up anymore!      So make hay while the sun shines.|`|B8e8x60Saa	i have this issue as well.. just  try to hide it.. and dont be ashamed.. never feel bad or ashamed of your body.. it depends.. how old are you? it could be natural (teens). could be you producing more testosterone..|`|wFJ7S5Bzaa	Yeah, its normal. I'm 19 and it happens to me. I suggest wearing briefs or boxer briefs, the tightness will hold it down. Also, if it does happen, remain seated, keep your crotch under your desk until it goes down. Don't think about your b0ner at all, cuz that will only intensify it. Don't think about girls, think about the non-sexual news you saw today, or sports.  If you have to walk around, use the trick described in Superbad and tuck it up into your belt, just hope you're wearing a long enough shirt.|`|dBoC8fR2aa	You cannot stop an erection naturally, because its a normal thing.  You won't get any erection when you reach certain age, depending on you well-being. Then you will wish that you can have it back. You can ask you grandfather.  You can always tie it up.|`|r6jVMpW7aa	yeh its normal sometimes it just happens but the majority is when your thinking of something "good".|`|kwYxQp0Maa	I assume you are young.  It is normal.  It is caused by hormone fluctuations.  It will continue for the rest of your life, though will greatly decrease as you get older.      You can't stop it from happening,  you also can't think about it going away, as that can be counter productive and cause it to last longer.  Occupy your mind with something else and it will go away.|`|AA10621397	your a man , you cant stop nature|`|8DzCWuZ5aa	Don't worry it's entirely normal, some guys will get random erections throughout their entire lives. Though typically, most guys will experience them in greater frequency during puberty. Regrettably, there's no miracle cure to prevent you from getting an erection. However, do keep in mind that it should get better with age. I'm right now 18, and maybe get one once every couple of months. (Not to mention, I was a late bloomer.) Anyways, things should balance out, but in the meantime learn to handle it, and never be ashamed. Every last guy goes through it.|`|PVoBHVRXaa	1) It's completely normal. I'm sure there are some older dudes out there that wish this still happened to them, lol.    2)For what it's worth, if they are spontaneous, there's not really a way to stop it as far as preventing them. When they do occur, you could try thinking of stuff that is a total downer and see if that helps you deflate. Also, experiment with underwear and pants that might help conceal those spontaneous erections a bit. In additon to fit, I've found that dark color (black) pants/jeans do a better job of making a big bulge less conspicuous.|`|EOHP3pHmaa	Well that happens to me occasionally. And I know how you feel bud; it's always at the wrong time and wrong place.   I'm afraid to say it's all apart of being a teen. But here's a really good tip: To hide your penis when it's erected, just reach in and grab it, then flip it up so the "head is right above your pants. So it's like your pants hold your penis upward so they don't see the buldge.     If you still don't understand, or have more questions, go ahead and email me.    Good luck buddy,           Devin P.|`|9ciquLcaaa	haha! That Sucks!
oluzjSgjaa	When you ovulate , several follicles are released by your ovaries.   usually, one follicle develops into an egg, and the others disappear.   if none develop into eggs, you then get   poly cystic ovary syndrome  PCOS     see sites below for more info....
geMRkVJbaa	A dominant follicle is a normal occurrence which happens every month during your cycle and is nothing to worry about. Basically follicles are where you keep your eggs in your ovaries and each month in the first half of your cycle one grows big and pops, releasing your egg about mid cycle. All this means that at the time of the ultrasound you were about mid cycle, but hadn't ovulated yet.
yjXUE8bWaa	To infect people, the herpes simplex viruses (both HSV-1 and HSV-2) must get into the body through broken skin or a mucous membrane, such as inside the mouth or on the genital area. Each virus can be carried in bodily fluids (saliva, semen, fluid in the female genital tract) or in fluid from herpes sores. The risk for infection is highest with direct contact of blisters or sores during an outbreak.    Once the virus has contact with the mucous membranes or skin wounds, it begins to replicate. The virus is then transported within nerve cells to their roots where it remains inactive (latent) for some period of time. During inactive periods, the virus cannot be transmitted to another person. However, at some point, it often begins to multiply again without causing symptoms (called shedding ). During shedding, the virus can infect other people through exchange of bodily fluids.    Sometimes, infected people can transmit the virus and infect other parts of their own bodies (most often the hands, thighs, or buttocks). This process, known as autoinoculation, is uncommon, since people generally develop antibodies that protect against this problem.    Transmission of Oral Herpes  Oral herpes (usually HSV-1) has been detected in both the saliva and blood of patients with active oral infections. It is the most prevalent form of herpes simplex virus, and infection is most likely to occur during preschool years. Oral herpes is easily spread by direct exposure to saliva or even from droplets in breath. Skin contact with infected areas is enough to spread it. Transmission most often occurs through close personal contact, such as kissing. In addition, because herpes simplex virus 1 can be passed in saliva, people should also avoid sharing toothbrushes or eating utensils with an infected person.    DONT FREAK OUT!!  THE THING TO DO IS STAY CALM, YOU MORE LIKELY  DIDNT CATCH ANYTHING. JUST DONT EAT OR SMOKE AFTER THIS PERSON AGAIN. NOW THE MOST COMMON ONE FOR THE MOUTH IS HERPES SIMPLEX ONE. I DOUBT YOU GOT IT.  YOU'LL BE OK. AN IF YOU HAVE MORE QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO TALK TO YOU PCP (PRIMARY CARE PHYSICAN  :)    PS  YOU ARE BLESSED, SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT BEING INFECTED LIKE THAT, SATIN TRIES TO MESS WITH PEOPLE ALL THE TIME WITH OUR "FEARS".   HAVE FAITH, AND SATIN CANT TOUCH YOU.  GOD IS THE BEST PHYSICIAN.|`|wi0CSqNSaa	NO, Wow you are freaking paranoid...NO you cant. It is so unlikely that you would catch HSV1 that way. You probably already have the virus if she is a family member. Most likely your immune system suppressed it.
wH0brA6Eaa	You could get him Durex Performax condoms. The condoms have a climax control lubricant on the inside that numbs the head of the penis a bit and will stop premature ejaculation.|`|R1LvhhTeaa	More sex - must have more sex!|`|dBoC8fR2aa	Tell him to inform you whenever he is about to ***, you stop absolutely still. Let him get over the ejaculation urge and upon his signal, restart the movement, repeat the same till both of you are perfectly satisfied, then let him erupt.|`|wFJ7S5Bzaa	get him drunk, or tell him to jerk it out about an hour beforehand. Use more foreplay. If he c*ms during foreplay, good, he'll still be hard, and he'll still be turned on, he IS a guy after all lol.|`|OBFyz3z8aa	The thing is that you both aren't on par and /or he's thinking too much of sex during sex. Like if you moan and he isn't, he'll probably get hornier and ejaculate. It's all in his mind, if he thinks about something else during sex, he will still stay erect and probably won't ejaculate as fast. I used to start singing a song in my head or thought I was playing a video game or something. I usually lasted around an hour or so doing this, sometimes I never ejaculated during sex at all, I had to masturbate myself off when my ex was tired =p|`|DD219aCVaa	a rodeo clown and a barrel in the corner of the room .|`|8DzCWuZ5aa	Well there's an easy short term solution, and another long term solution that he can work on by himself. I'll start off with the long term solution. Your boyfriend should experiment with masturbating and controlling his orgasms, trying to hold them off for as long as possible so that he can gain control over his orgasms to an extent. In addition, to help him with his masturbatory experiments, you should tell him to look up kegel exercises. These exercises are designed to help a guy gain control over his orgasms as well. However, until your boy has built up more stamina there are two solutions you as a couple can do. Either he can masturbate before you guys have sex, if you only ever feel like getting him off once. The second round in sex is always longer than the first, even if the first round is solo sex, and this will allow you as a couple to engage for a longer period of time. Or as opposed to him masturbating, you could have sex twice in a row, once really quickly, and then the second time for longer so that both of you get pleasured from your encounter.     However if you've already tried this, and having sex repeatedly does not increase his stamina in the later rounds, you should consult a doctor. Although, the advice I gave should help considerably.
732c8aa6cd004765b25dffe2c773041eaa	OMG i know the feeling ive been battling acne for about 15 years I tried everything underthe sun... most recently I bought the Clean & Clear Advantage kit for 15.00 (its 19.99) but they have a coupon online and i have to admit its WORKING ITS FINALLY WORKING!!!! I am so excited and i mean it worked like 7 hours after i used it - if my pics werent so embarrassing id post them but they are quite embarrasing im telling you try it OMG i cannot praise this product enought!|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	A hot compress and a sharp pin|`|h2i7VIWLaa	I use the Neutrogena Oil free Acne Wash in the morning and at night, rinse my face very well, then apply a thin layer of Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face lotion to my face. Then on big spots or areas, at night after applying a thin layer, I will dab some on the areas, not rubbing it in. Sleep with your head up though! Depending on your skin sensitivity, you can do the same in the morning also. But I just apply a thinner layer of it on in the morning after the wash. I just started dabbing it on 2 days ago, and my face has gotten far less bumpy, and my forehead is clearing up! Use these if you think they can work for you. My acne isnt severe, but it's not good.    Tips:    Drink Water, less Milk and NO SODA OR FIZZED DRINKS! Water clears up your skin, milk isn't bad, but only a small glass a day, or it will show on your face. Soda is always a no, plus you'll be healthier!    Don't touch or poke at your face! I've learned through about 3 bumps that have left impressions(cleared up after a few months =( ) You put oil on your skin and irritate it    Wash your face is a given!    See your doctor to see if he prescribes something to you. I recommend that you use your judgement on doctor treatments, because they are harsh for the wrong people.    Be confident. Don't stress over your face(causes more pimples) just act like you didn't have them, but don't have too much ego.|`|KIU2lpJ2aa	I had the same problem, tried everything and nothing worked! until I decided to go see a master herbalist and told me that acne has a lot to do with the liver.

Hope that helps! :)|`|AA10504112	There is one thing that I got from nu-skin that i still get.  NU Skin facial scrub. Don't scrub hard, its meant to be like soft scrub.

AA11020187	There is no way a tumor that size is a polyp and it is not likely to be benign. He should be having some blood work and a few scans. If his doctors cant tell from that how bad it is that is a good sign. His doctors will know exactly where he stands after surgery. There is no way of telling how good or bad the situation is at this point, but I have seen patients with tumors that large and come out okay. Personally I think it is worse to worry and imagine the worst, than it is to know the truth. I hope everything goes well.|`|8UQ7GupHaa	Watch - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eO0I2jWth...|`|6fjMtWboaa	Yes you should be worried.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	I suppose he will have it removed.  Anyway, this is not enough info for me to tell whether he will be fine or not.  The doctor might not even know yet; they will have to test it to see what kind of tumor it is.|`|8QrfXxaXaa	Hi,    It is important to know if the tumor is benign or malignant one and what symptoms does your dad have. Benign tumors include polyps which can be easily removed by surgery while malignant would mean colon cancer.  If it is a malignant tumor which is localized and has not spread to other parts of the body, then surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy will help.   Hope this helps!    Noopur
emNCaAq7aa	Sounds like low fat, high protein and low carbs.  The low carbs part makes it a bit harder since you need to limit grains and beans do not provide enough complete protein with out a grain.  If your not a vegan you can substitute egg whites. One egg equaling about 2 oz of any of the meats or seafood. You can also use low fat plain yogurt, must be the kind that has active cultures since they digest the carbs in the yogurt before you eat it. Check the label for the amount of protein. Same goes for Kefir, you can drink that but it must be the palin kind.  Soy beans are great for you, not just tofu. Men should not eat un-fermented soy but it is OK for women. Again just check the label for the amount of protein and compare with what your diet says.    There is a meat substitute made in Australia, the name escapes me now (its myo something). It is made from a specially grown fungus (thing mushrooms) and is hing in complete protein. It is substituted ounce for once with meat and has no fat and very low carbs. Some people like it I think it is horrible.  Then there is TVP  (textured vegetable protein)you can buy it in bags or pre made and flavored at most stores, It is a meat substitute and is also used in many hamburgers to stretch them. You can use it like hamburger but you have to add flavor.  This part of the diet has no fish other than shrimp and you don; seem to be getting any Omega 3's. if you won't take fish oil use Chia seeds as part of your eggs or in your yogurt. The taste great, don't spoil like flax and have more protein and Omega 3 that your body actually uses than flax|`|4Z8wogroaa	Have you tried Morningstar foods or Boca burgers or any of that stuff?

jHwWMwDRaa	One way, is to look into his eyes, and hold the look for 3 to 5 seconds.  Does he look away quickly and then look back and hold your gaze... He's probably gay or bi.  If he looks away, and acts uncomfortable, he's probably straight.    This is not infallible, but it's usually pretty accurate.    Good Luck.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	You're is a delicate predicament there, Bubba!  I wouldn't appear too aggressive or you might end up needing dental repairs.  Wouldn't it be a little easier if you became friends, buddies, etc. first.  Then once you know more about the guy, you will get an idea about his sexual orientation or preferences.  As far as underwear - use you own judgement on that.  It's not the packaging that counts, anyway.|`|oTHGgowsaa	Gaydar, I hear you can buy it online :P|`|i6RlYFo7aa	there isn't a way unless they are a stereotype|`|OBFyz3z8aa	Well, first bring up a homo topic, like, "So what did you think of that kiss scene in Brokeback Mountain?" Topics like that, if he says, "Ew, that's kind of gross," then he's not gay or bicurious. You could also ask, "So have you went across a gay porn video?" If he says that he did and he thought it was gross, then he is probably straight. Also pay attention to his voice when he says the answer, if they're shaky, then he's lying and trying to hide the fact that he's gay or bi. About the underwear situation, switch to boxers!|`|dBoC8fR2aa	If you are a gay yourself, you just touch him all over, if he stay still for you, there is your answer.

As far as the underwear part is concerned, that is the least of your problems right now.|`|8DzCWuZ5aa	As a bisexual, I know your pain. Guessing whether or not that really cute guy whose hitting on you is gay or not, and then having to go through the agony of actually asking him if he's gay to see if it's worth pursuing. Though regrettably, that's truly the only way to find out if someone is gay. You'll have to ask him sooner or later to find out. Admittedly, there are stereotypes that everyone consults to see if a guy is gay, but ignore those, there are plenty of metro-sexual guys out there who act stereotypically gay but simply aren't into men. So, the only true way to tell if a guy is gay without asking him, is to see if he overtly hits on you. Stroking, hugging for long periods of time, etc. I still vote you ask the guy, because sexuality is different for everyone and simply expressing yourself in one way does not mean that in fact you're gay.    As to the second question, nothing is hotter than a guy in black boxer-briefs, although this is my personal preference. I love to see a guy's package, and thighs hugged lightly by fabric, casting a gorgeous silhouette.

It will get better if you are on top or try a different position.     2) Use lube!  If you are dry down there, it would have more friction, resulting in pain.   The is KY jelly or anything like that is fine.  Otherwise you can do it naturally by having some foreplay before doing it.
1BbnyTfBaa	Maybe your socks are not getting clean enough.  I had this trouble when I was doing my laundry in cold water.    Always change your socks every day.    Do not wear a pair of shoes more than one day at a time.  Give them at least one day to dry out between wearings.  When you're not wearing them, pull the tongue out so the air can circulate better.  If you can remove the insoles, do so, and wash them from time to time.    The bacteria that live inside your shoes do not like acid conditions.  Using foot powder is good because it absorbs moisture and has acid chemicals in it.  Another way to make your feet acid is to soak them 15 minutes per day in a mixture of 1/2 distilled (white) vinegar and 1/2 water.|`|kZdyPspmaa	Listerine therapy for toenail fungus: Get rid of unsightly toenail fungus by soaking your toes in Listerine Mouthwash.

oVhS4ybvaa	I had the same problem when I was younger, but mine is under control now.  It sounds like you have what doctors call "dysmenorrhea" (spelling?), which literally means "bad periods." It's not life-threatening or anything like that - it's a common disorder that many women have. You know from experience that there's a difference between having "bad cramps" and literally being debilitated by them.  The combination of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, awful cramps, fatigue, and other body pains is certainly annoying, especially when you know it's coming every month, forcing you to miss work or school, and leaving you miserable.      The best thing you can do is talk to a doctor, preferably a gynecologist (but any general physician will do), and describe in detail these symptoms and how long they usually last - when they start, when they subside, etc.  Many doctors will start you on a low dose of oral contraceptives (birth control pills) and this usually helps A LOT.  After I started taking the Pill, I was able to function again during my periods - every month during "that time" I used to have to sleep on the bathroom floor because I was so sick, but after starting the Pill it's been great.  Your periods will be lighter and shorter, the cramps more manageable, and the constant urge to vomit will also dissipate.  I would definitely recommend talking to your doctor as soon as possible so that you can start treatment and avoid future painful periods.  Ask about birth control pills, too, because these really do help with "period problems."  Also, if you suffer from issues with PMS, look into Yaz or Yasmin, as those ones also help many women with PMS and mood issues related to the menstrual cycle.    While you're in pain now, try some pain-killers, although I know they may not work for you because the pain can be very intense.  I recommend ThermaCare Heat Patches - they make ones just for menstrual cramps that stick nicely inside the front or back of your underwear so you can wear them discretely and get warming relief for several hours.  Also, there are vitamin supplements, like Evening Primrose, that allegedly help with dysmenorrhea, but I only know this because I've tried everything for relief.|`|eXJOdwzcaa	see, i have polycystic ovarian syndrome, and i have HORRIBLE periods  with unbeliveable pain and nausea and im always tired and SO mean.     my mom had endemetriosis (dont know how to spell that) and thats what she thought i had, but i didnt.  the only way that will show up is by a laprascopic surgery.  it sounds like a horrible surgery, but its called bandaid surgery, but it does hurt.     both of those can be controlled by birthcontrol|`|a16lpaqGaa	if you have a gyno i would speak to them. they would know what to do. birth control might just be the answer. it has a lot of benefits, and there are ones out there that you get your period 4 times a year. i'm on one like that and it's amazing. no cramps, which use to be killer, and my periods are super short and very light.|`|JoPr4Kouaa	Noni Juice is good for menstrual pain, heavy bleeding and even mood swings.

AA10779080	Probably doing a delicated pancreatic CT to look at a mass.  In CT scans, they often inject contract dye into the patient and that dye circulates throughout the body.  When the dye enters the arteries around or within the pancreas you take pictures and the arterial system in that area will light up.  The dye travels into and thru the mass of pancreas ie the pancreatic phase.  The pancrease will lite up. When the dye leaves the pancreas, the dye goes thru vein and ultimately into the portal vein.  The radiologist look at the pictures in the different phase and closely at the mass in question.  If the mass is a hemagioma (grouped up collection of blood vessels) it will lite up I believe in the the AP and PPP phase and in the PVP phase it will not lite up.  If it is a discrete mass like a cancer I dont believe it will lite up significantly at any phase.
7FTTTzQVaa	if you are big eater and you want to suppress your appetite naturally, Hoodia made diet pills will work for you.     Hoodia gordonii side effects are minimal or maybe non-existent. But Use caution when selecting a hoodia product, choose the diet pills  manufactured by a reputable company. According to the research many of hoodia gordonii pills sold In the United States are counterfeit.     If you are looking for genuine hoodia gordonii pills, it must have a CITES certificate (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). Because all genuine hoodia gordonii exported from South Africa must have a CITES certificate.

Personally, I'd totally go for ignored.  There's always a reason to live.  There's a lot of people with shittier lives- there's also kids getting a new Mercedes for their 16th birthday (*stab stab stab*)    Bottom line is- you only live once,  make the most of it.   Do you like cheeseburgers? That's a reason I use every day to live. If you can't appreciate the whole, take the little things. (chzbrgr)    Or if you want- go see the world. You don't have to live according to the standards/rules set by those around you. hop a train, hitchhike, see the world all over (or at least the US) and live just to experience.

And as much as you would like to give up, please don't give up hope,  Health and human resources can offer you free counseling for this. There are ways to learn to love yourself.

You know looks aren't the only thing a person needs. We also need charisma, health and wisdom.    People who look down on others are people who have insecurities about themselves. Don't care about them! You are you and there is no 1st 2nd or 3rd in this world because everyone is unique and has a world of their own. If you don;t even have confidence in yourself how would you expect others to. No one is perfect :)    Well eat more vegetables, fruits and go for gym to tone yourself up more and of course embrace everyday. Then the next time you look in the mirror you will realise you look a lot cuter!    And take care of your brain and body. They are your two dearest partners.

Nothing listed about contraindications about Birth control, and thats usually one of the first drugs that a contraindication shows up for (that and blood thinners)    However, I went to pubmed and searched it, and it looks like out of 117 studies on it, there isn't one that's been done on human fertility, which leads me to believe its folk legend - - that said, I don't dismiss folk legend that easily....which means two things...  1) Just because the effect hasn't been observable in enough people to warrant research, doesn't mean its not there...so have a plan B, or rather, 2) plan on using condoms as well.    Just type in bacopa in the search function if you want to look, it wont let me paste the results because its an internal engine.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov    I've used it before, and while I can't say it causes anxiety, its certainly a cognitive stimulant (technically, its a acetylcholine agonist, meaning it increases effect of the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the body) - which for me, means that my mind wanders, and that, for me, does increase anxiety....    Just my two cents.

KppM3VzAaa	Get your weight in kgs. Multiply your kgs x 1.56, this will tell you the amount of protein in grammes you should be eating per day.    Also find out how many calories you burn (RMR -resting metabollic rate, men ave 2000 cals/day, women 1500).    Then eat the right amount of protein, reduce your calorie intake 500 below your RMR and research shows you will lose 2lbs of FAT per week.    Best to eat 4 - 6 small meals per day.    Exercise wise, you need to do 3 20 mins sessions per week. Choose your machine, running, rowing etc. Do 5 mins at a gentle pace, then up your pace each minute for the next 4 mins, repeat this cylce. Then the last 2 mins the gentle pace to warm down.    Combine these you'll burn fat.|`|OHs8yJiOaa	That's a bit aggressive and unrealistic to lose that much safely in two months. 5 pounds per month is more realistic and sustainable.    Eat healthy. Don't starve yourself, or you'll throw your metabolism out of whack and be more likely to gain weight. Dump most or all processed foods and empty/junk calories. Stick to your rices/quinoa, vegetables, meats like chicken. If you can, try to spread your meals across the day as 6 smaller ones. Do some reading to find foods that are nutritionally good "values" for the calories. Stay off the junk that's a lot of calories with little or no nutrition.    Get into an exercise routine. Do something like walk for at least 30-60 minutes every day. You don't need to burn yourself out to lose weight -- you need to find something you can do regularly and sustainably. If you can find the time, you can extend that to even longer as time goes on. In the early stages, you need to ease into things so your body safely adapts without injury.    Anything like alcohol, sweets, snacks (chips, etc.), fast food, sodas, etc. are all out.|`|ygU9yoExaa	I had too much fat in all the embarrassing zones until I used acai berry, I know they say that pills don't work, however they sure worked for me, and they have been shown on the Rachael Ray Show too.

What should you eat? Whatever you like. Just aim for smaller portions and make sure to eat regularly so your blood sugar doesn't drop, putting you into binge-mode. You may want to keep a food journal so you have an idea of how much you're putting into your body, and then compare that with what your body actually needs to function (there are calculators online to give you an idea of your body's caloric needs).    What exercises should you do? I'd recommend running, but really it's about whatever works best in your schedule that you can commit to (and enjoy!) I know you don't want websites but here's a guide I found handy: http://doctormama.blogspot.com/2006/05/l...    At the end of the day, there's no miracle cure me or Oprah or anyone else can give you.  You have to reach a point where the negative effects of your behavior are outweighing whatever comfort you feel they're giving you.|`|XSBsomfVaa	I say try doing some cardio a couple times a week at the gym or just around the neighborhood. Also, doing crunches, sit ups whatever will help alot. For your diet, I say cut out all fatty foods. Eat more lean meat. For example, instead of eating ground beef try ground turkey. You're going to have to look at all the labels on your food.     I'm not really a believer in buying diet pills and stuff. I think of it as cheating and it's too easy. Just track what you eat everyday. Hit the gym as much as possible. And you might want to eat less calories a day than you usually do.
MqWFGPwkaa	It is quite possible.  I itched all over from the sulfa drug in a new prescription that I was taking.

mqXyDTwwaa	Lose, not loose, and yes, you have to lose that last bit of fat by diet and exercise. There's no such thing as spot reduction. You're lucky, though. My last bit of fat is right over my abs, so I can't get a six pack until I lose that last bit.|`|AA11564934	u cannot spot reduce.    u can firm specific muscles, but overall fat determines fat content|`|vEGkSHMsaa	No.  So-called spot reduction is a myth.  You cant exercise one part of your body to make fat in that part of the body go away; it doesnt work that way.  You can only reduce your overall body fat, not make it go away in a specific area.    The fat deposits on those areas are probably due to genetics. It sounds like your body fat % is low already (obviously because you have a 6 pack) but the only way the little spots of fat are going to go away, is to reduce your overall BF% more. Keeping your body in that low of a body fat level probably isnt too healthy though. I'm guessing you look fine and shouldnt worry so much about it.
ohJH8t7aaa	This is a tough question, based on the information provided, but I wil try and give you my opinion.  First what is the pain like? You mentioned it is a sharp/stabbing pain that was in the right side of your lung area? do you mean your back or shoulder or both? Is this the first time you have experienced this kind of pain?  Also how severe is the pain? do you do anything that relieves it, such as lying down or taking antacids?  Those are just some things I think you should think about before going to the doctor, if you decide to go. But I don't want to worry you either, its hard to diagnose these kind of things, without being able to do a full assessment or to do test, such as blood work, urine samples,etc,etc    My advice would be to go the doctor if you feel this interferes with your everyday normal living or if you think it could be a problem in the future.    I hope that this issue is resolved and you can start feeling better|`|mAp90hEeaa	This could all be related to your stomach.  Hopefully, you are taking some medication regularly for the stomach acid.  If you have not, you need to take some Tums, Rolaids, etc. until the sour feeling and burping goes away.  If you are under 30, it is probably not your heart.
u8CFwtyMaa	Sex is far better - when you masturbate, you just tend to use your hand to stimulate yourself, which is usually just around the genitals.  When you have sex, it's more of a whole body experience, and you are being intimate with your partner. It's also the sensation of touching another body, and that person touching you.  The satisfaction from sex lasts a lot longer than that from masturbating, because it is so much more intense.  Hope this helps.

WlywfjG1aa	Watching porn and masturbating are quite healthy habits. You should not do excess of it and do not see porno stuff which is legally not allowed. You should also learn a correct technique to masturbate and get maximum pleasure out of it.|`|Sa5WsCmYaa	Basically alot of women don't like porn because it makes them feel degraded and/or inferior.    The women in porn videos are beautiful with perfect hair and **** and suck cock like a pro.  This intimidates 'normal' women who tend to spend more time during sex worrying about whether their partner can see their cellulite from that angle, rather that whether their hair and make up is perfect.    The whole point of porn is fantasy; it isnt supposed to eb a realistic account of what actually happens in the bedroom.    Obviously everyone has their own oppinion, and is perfectly entitled to dislike porn but most people arn't too offended by it now days.|`|eXJOdwzcaa	yeah its normal.    dont listen to her.  you are who you are.|`|COIYLtpbaa	At 13, i think the question is whether you should spend precious time watching porn and masturbating and not whether it is right or wrong. porn isnt good for you. you wont gain anything from it. it only encourages early sexual activity which yields little if any benefits. if anything, the result could be early and unwanted pregnancies or AIDS. rather than watch porn and struggle with yourself to get orgasm, kick the habit and turn to your books.|`|lc9nus8taa	watching porn not normal (for a girl)    masturbating is alright|`|xHvuJZaSaa	Some people consider it normal. However it is not something I would advise people to do. Try to stay away from it while you can, especially if you are a Christian. Even if you are not a Christian, porn is something that can control and mess-up people's lives. People get addicted to porn. When they do, it becomes difficult to be in a long term relationship with someone. You need a live life partner, someone you can trust, love and cherish and that person will feel the same way about you.  I would advise you to keep yourself busy and enjoy life as it is in the mean time. Before you know it the right person will come alone.   God Bless :)|`|rUX7l9TQaa	I see nothing wrong with watching porn.. Some people just act like that because they want people to think they are better than everyone else..

y6jPCsi2aa	The Anshar Diet    As an American I've seen enough crazy fad diets in my day to fill several weeks full of infomercials and advertisements. As such I'm going to give you the benefit of many years of health and nutrition classes and do my good deed for the year.    I'm going to tell you how to not only lose weight but change the composition of your body, increase your health, and best of all.. keep it off.    First, let's dispel some common myths.    Myth 1:  Eating less calories will make me lose weight.  Unfortunately this isn't always true. A lot of different factors program your metabolism but one of the key things is how OFTEN you eat. If you fast all day long and then have a 500 calorie meal at the end of the day almost ALL of it will be stored by your body.    Myth 2:  I can have a diet with no carbs and be healthy.  This really is a testament to how much Americans want a quick fix. Diets like the Atkin's Diet cause your body to start devouring itself, increase your cholesterol, and in certain cases can even kill you. One thing I WON'T argue, death will indeed cause you to lose weight, permanently.    Myth 3:  If I go on a diet I will lose weight.  99% of people who go on diets will end up putting on MORE weight than they lost from a diet. This is because diet is supposed to be a LIFESTYLE change, not something you do for 2 weeks. If you starve your body it will make fat cells and increase their size even faster.    Myth 4:  I need to go out and exercise to lose weight.  This isn't actually true but it's important to say that having daily activities WILL keep you healthy. If you burn almost no calories every day what else do you think your body is going to do with them? Balancing a healthy lifestyle with a good diet is what you want here, not killing yourself by running every afternoon.    Myth 5:  The scale in my bathroom gives me a good idea of how healthy I am.  The dreaded bathroom scale does NOT tell you how healthy you are. Let's say I have 10 lbs of fat, don't drink water, and have little muscle mass. Then I work out for 3 months and hydrate every day. I lose 5 lbs of fat but gain 7 lbs of muscle and 3 pounds of average water weight. What will happen when I look at the scale? Are you being fair to yourselves? Judge yourself by how you feel, not what a spinning number under your feet tells you.        With these common myths out of the way I'll tell you the secret. It's five simple steps.    ~~The Anshar Diet~~  1. Only eat until you are no longer hungry.  This does NOT mean that you starve yourself. It means after you take a few bites of food ask yourself if you're still hungry. If you're not, into the fridge it goes. While we're at it, CHEW YOUR FOOD. at least 10 times per bite (using common sense if you're eating applesauce, this isn't an excuse to be an idiot).    2. Eat at least 6 (more if your schedule allows) meals a day.  I know this seems counterintuitive, but hear me out. If you eat 6-8 meals a day the meals are very small (often around 100-200 calorie "snacks"), provided you are only eating until you are NOT HUNGRY. When your body is not hungry your metabolism will not try to store energy as fat. It really is that simple. Smaller meals aid in digestion, they increase the nutrition you get from your food, and they keep you from being lethargic. If you eat when you're hungry your body stores MORE of it as fat ("Hmm. I'm hungry, I don't know where my next meal will come from! I'd better hold onto this.")    3. Eat BEFORE you get hungry.  Schedule your 6-10 meals throughout the day and stick to them. If you're waiting until you get hungry to eat you've already screwed this up. Your body stores energy if you're hungry, if your body sees food and just takes what it needs then you're running at optimum efficiency. This is called programming your metabolism.    4. Eat breakfast. Always.  Your first meal of the day is also the meal you have no choice over being hungry for. Your body has been replenishing itself all night and needs fuel. Since now you KNOW that hunger means you store your food then that means you want to keep breakfast LIGHT. A cup of cereal and a banana. A granola bar and an apple. LIGHT does NOT mean you skip breakfast. If you skip breakfast you are telling your metabolism to turn ALL of the next meal you eat into stored fat.    5. Drink water.  (I'm a big hypocrite on this one, but I can't stress it enough) Most people think that if they pick up a glass of orange juice instead of a soda they're doing themselves a favor, and that's not entirely true. A glass of orange juice can have just as many calories as some sodas. Try looking at the label sometime. If you're thirsty, drink water. If you love your soda then have your soda (real soda, not diet, artificial sweetners have been argued to be one of the worst things to ever happen to western civilization). If you decide to have a drink to treat yourself, pour yourself a half glass, don't take a can or bottle with you and for go|`|KppM3VzAaa	Get your weight in kgs. Multiply your kgs x 1.56, this will tell you the amount of protein in grammes you should be eating per day.    Also find out how many calories you burn (RMR -resting metabollic rate, men ave 2000 cals/day, women 1500).    Then eat the right amount of protein, reduce your calorie intake 500 below your RMR and research shows you will lose 2lbs of FAT per week.    Best to eat 4 - 6 small meals per day.    Exercise wise, you need to do 3 20 mins sessions per week. Choose your machine, running, rowing etc. Do 5 mins at a gentle pace, then up your pace each minute for the next 4 mins, repeat this cylce. Then the last 2 mins the gentle pace to warm down.    Combine these you'll burn fat.|`|FaVYRoXqaa	M T has got the answer.

Just remember that to lose weight, you should burn more calories than you eat. But seriously, I don't think you are overweight at all, and I would love to be your size.|`|C2M2StR1aa	Your body burns a certain amount of calories each day whether you exercise or not. We each have what is called a Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). This rate gradually decreases with age.  To the BMR you add the total calories used during the day due to all exercise and activity, which gives you your Active Metabolic Rate.     I am 6', 170 lbs and 52 years old. My basal metabolic rate is about 1700 calories burned per day. To that number I can add whatever calories I burn during the day due to activity and exercise. That will tell me approximately how many total calories I will burn up in a day.     Once you know this number you can eat however many calories you choose in order to lose, gain or maintain your weight.   You burn about 3500 more calories than you consume to lose a pound.     I have a page posted at my website that explains this further.  You can also input your own info to see your own numbers as far as calories used in a day.     www.diet-and-exercise-for-health.com/b...     Good health and good luck!|`|TwrAasVlaa	the thing is with calories  whatever goes in, must come out!|`|J36Rc5DKaa	less than 2,000 a day. a donut has like 200 calories. so watch carefully|`|XUrgcOMDaa	Focus on exercising, first, if you want to lose weight.  Once you build muscle your metabolism will naturally go up and you will burn calories faster.  Crazy dance in your room to music.. whatever.    Instead of worrying about the calories, try slowly incorporating simple (non processed) foods into your meals.  If you do it drastically chances are you'll end up failing.  But if you do it slowly... you'll have a better chance of succeeding.|`|jeXlZ0sSaa	First, find your BMR (Basic Metabolic Rate) using an online calculator.  This number tells you how many calories your body uses to operate with no activity at all.  One pound is 3500 calories, so 15 x 3500 = 52,500 calories.  I would reccomend doing 2 pounds a week or so to stay healthy, because losing weight too fast is unhealthy.  So subtract 7000/7 = 1000 calories from your BMR daily and try to hit that, INCLUDING exercise.  So, for instance, if your BMR is 2000, then try to eat 1300 or so with a 300 calorie-burning workout.. or whatever works out.|`|RZ4l6s65aa	A,you are not over weight  you are at a perfect weight for your height  B.Around 1200 calories a day + an hour of excersize a day shoukd make you lose weight easily|`|YiDVUCdwaa	You should cut at least 500 a day from your intake. This usually results in a 1 to 2 pound loss a week. For a woman intaking between 1200 to 1800 calories a day is recommended for a healthy diet. If your not use to dieting cutting 500 a day is an easy way to start off and ease yourself into lessening your food intake. Moderation is key and portion control. Keep your metobolism up by eating 5 small meals a day if you can, if you cant just use moderation and portion control more during your meals each day. You should be doing at least 3 days a week of exercise, a mix between cardio (30 minutes) and light weight lifting will help you get slim and tone|`|zjs9t7vfaa	this is the age for u to eat...eat well....    dont diet    just go out and play some outdoor games with ur friend    basketball etc etc|`|C1THzzm8aa	you will get all ur health related problem's solution from healthizen.com........go on .....check out
saG3rgnzaa	I don't think it's good to force yourself to eat and such.   Just eat everyday, 3 meals and have a routine for your eating time.    Breakfast is the most important: You should eat enought of it so you you can make the day. Skipping a breakfast is the least thing you want. If you happen to do that, you will not only go hungry, but also damage your health. You should eat it between 7am - 9am    Also lunch, you need to eat till you get filled up. :P  It's that little exra boost you need for the rest of the day. It should be eaten around..um, lunch time.     When it comes to dinner, you shouldn't eat too much of it. Just some healthy, maybe soup or such. Don't eat too much food containing lots of fat. Because you wont be burning any more energy when sleeping. To eat dinner at 5pm-7pm is ok. Don't eat anything before going to bed, fruit might be ok too, or a glass of milk.    You really don't need to do much to stay healthy, maybe do some sports and such, you'll be fine. So, don't eat too much junk just to gain weight. Eat veggies!|`|oTHGgowsaa	Any supplement that has a protein to carbohydrate ratio of at least 1:2  (twice as many carbs as protein)|`|8R2aDPXOaa	commonsense says eat whatever you eat but take a nap (swhort sleep) for an hour after lunch and walk with slow speed for a kilometre after dinner. try this for 30 days and see results naturally.|`|VlcMlYGwaa	i think that that stuff is bad for you, eating your calorie mark, and then taking a nap has been scientifically proven to gain weight.    hoped this helped.|`|PXQd67e3aa	Eat food with alot of starch that is what Samoans and Tongans eat that is why there like hulks!|`|wi0CSqNSaa	You want to get those calorie shakes.

WlywfjG1aa	Sometimes yeast infection is tough to get rid of and it keeps on coming again and again. You should consult a good skin specialist and take proper treatment which would include oral medicines and also the cream to be applied.|`|Sa5WsCmYaa	he needs to get rid of the infection. If you have it then give it to him then he will just keep giving it back to you.    You need to go and see your doctor - maybe there is a free clinic you could go to?    and not have unprotected sex untill you are both clear, otherwise you will just have it forever.|`|FaHuLB3Saa	Once you have had a yeast infection (and UTI for that matter), it's very likely to come back. There are many causes for this but mainly weak immune system, pH imbalance and sexual intercourse. It's very likely that your partner is giving you a yeast infection, and it keeps going back and forth between you two. You should be able to get some over-the-counter drugs (miconazole, tioconazole, butoconazole or clotrimazole). Both of you should go for a one week treatment at the same time. Also make sure you do not have any sexual relations (i.e. no blow-jobs, no sexual intercourse, no hand-job, no masturbating) during that week to prevent it from spreading.    Also for your UTI, it's likely to be caused by sexual intercourse. I strongly suggest you empty your bladder before and after sexual intercourse. You should also clean yourself thoroughly before and after sexual intercourse. I often recommend baby wipes. Also drink plenty of water (about 2 liters per day). It will help rinsing your bladder and urethra so it's all bacteria free.|`|xHvuJZaSaa	It is very likely your man gave it back to you. If so, try to not have unprotected sex until you both get treated. He can go to a free clinic if no insurance or a plan parenthood clinic.  You can Google to find one in your location.   If you keep getting infection after your period, try using (summers eve) 'Douche'. You might want to start using the 'Douche' two or three days before your period end as it is when yeasts will most likely start to form. Try not to use it more than two times a week.   See your GYN for more info. There are a lot of over the counter things you can use if you don't see your GYN. but the most important thing is to clean the exterior as well as the interior of your vagina with douche and medicated wipe after your period even before yeast start to form. Since you have sensitive skin, always use medicated wipes. You can find over the counter treatments at target Wal-Mart or Stop&Shop or Shoprite. When you get to the feminine section in the store, read the labels of the product and see what fit your need.   God Bless:)
7uV0SAWnaa	Maybe. But since 1993 scientists have researched women all over the world to know why some babies come to this world with their spines not formed properly and found that a lack of folic acid can do it. Folic acid is one of the B vitamins and found in foliage (vegetables) - hence the name. Now most nutritional foods for pregnant mothers are fortified with folic acid. Taking a 5mg of folic acid daily is enough and eating lots of vegetables may not give the required help. Nutritional foods also have very little folic acid in it as many don't know the minimum daily requirement for pregnant mothers.|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	It is not hereditay as such but a baby is more likely to have it if a close relative has it|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	yes|`|bPUC46uQaa	tv

There's something going around right now, I know 3 people who are all coughing until they vomit.  All of them say they don't really have a sore throat but their chest is getting sore from the cough.

JT9zudk9aa	Hopefully, future surgerys will not be necessary but you'll no doubt continue to develop cysts, as most of us do.  It will just be a matter of whether or not they're going to cause problem and how much of one.    I hate to say this (I'm sure you understand why) but it is great that you don't have the hirsutism issue to contend with.  It can be very difficult.  I know someone who has to deal with that.    The hormone help site has a lot of material on PCOS and hormones in general.  This link goes to the PCOS page.  http://www.hormonehelpny.com/column/pcos...    Many with PCOS develop acanthosis nigricans, but that's usually after they become insulin resistant.  It kind of sounds like you might be describing some type of dermatitis or eczema.  If that's the case, the MD should be able to point you to the type, or you might be able to find it on your own.  This goes to the dermatologic disease database, which has pretty detailed info.. and photos.  http://www.aocd.org/skin/dermatologic_di...    There are quite a few lotions and creams made for specific conditions.  In my experience, efficacy can vary.  I found that most OTC lotions really didn't do much.  Some of the more costly ones were more effective and some didn't do anything.  Stuff like Eucerin is pretty decent all around, but it may not relieve certain things.  With the dermatologists help, I found that I was not able to tolerate some of the Rx preps, or that others didn't work and in the end I wound up with (I believe it was) Metro cream, and both an oil and herbal cream I don't recall the name of.  I found the oil to be most effective but honestly, my patches still come and go.    It depends on the pain.  Personally, few things work on my pain, and most all require a prescription.|`|NlMm6JOTaa	My cousin has pcos.. Her ovaries have collapsed twice. She was diagnosed at 14..

You seem so young to start having to dill with such problems and I know how that feels like. I don't know much about this illness but I have something kind of similar. You need to talk to your GYN about that more and hopefully you will have some answers, however sometimes they're just not sure. You can also use birth control for pain. Another option is to use Motrin as needed (preferably at list one week before your period if that's when the pain will start.)Try not to use it to much though cause it is know to cause chest pain and such. Another alternative for pain is to exercise regularly so your body can relies natural pain killer. I have tried exercising with Motrin and so far that's the best thing that's helping me cause I don't want to use birth control. If some time the pain is to much you might have to call your doc to prescribe you some pain killer for these episodes.     Good luck and God Bless:)

I don't know what kind of "job" a 14-year-old has but I can guarantee you that it's not worth sacrificing your health for.|`|yUoa678Gaa	If your job calls for you to be skinny, get another job. If you want to lose weight in a healthy way, go on a juicing fast. Check the site below and comment or question the site owner if you have specific questions.     BTW, having hips is a very attractive thing for most men. Model skinny makes a girl look freakish. Trust me, I train models and they all wish they could look like JLO. Also your proportions are fine by any standard.    Also understand that targeted weight gain is a myth. It simply can't be done. You have the body God gave you, so all you can do is make sure it is as healthy as possible. Diet pills are poisonous. There isn't one I would recommend, especially at your age. They can destroy your liver and kidneys and the results from even the best known pills out there are negligible.    So if you need fast weight loss (which btw, you don't), try a juice fast.
jRqXZV6Oaa	Your face is innervated by several seperate "cranial nerves":    CN5 is for muscles you use to chew.    CN7 is for sensation.    CN11 is for the forehead.  Each nerve has a left side and right side beginning on the brain stem and branching several to many times.     Are you having some issue?
cEa8TTenaa	If you eat directly after exercising, your body will not use up its fat stores, but use the new fuel you are eating instead.  If you leave at least an hour between exercising and eating, your body will use up some of your fat stores and you will lose weight or not gain any more.    So the answer is - exercise before you eat, but leave at least 60-90 minutes before you have a meal. Drink water, have a rest and a shower, do something else, and then eat something light.        Good luck.|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear    Your Mom is wrong. you are right|`|lLiPd5IIaa	i would jog after because you will then burnt off those cals!

AA11080641	Oh boy, finally a topic I'm an expert on.    As said above, a canker sore is an ulcer inside your mouth. Think of it like a little wound. The cause of canker sores (unlike cold sores) is unknown - it's been correlated to several other problems as well as an absence of any other issues. In general, it's related to acid - many people find they get them after drinking a lot of something very acidic, like Mountain Dew. Others with irritable bowel syndrome find that they get canker sores around the same time their IBS flares up.    Anyway, there's no cure for a canker sore, but there's stuff you can do to help alleviate the pain. I go with two things:  - Baking soda. Rinse your mouth with a baking soda mix frequently - it'll sting while you do it, but the saltiness of the baking soda will make the sore start closing and temporarily numb the pain, while the mouthwash-ish properties will help disinfect it to kill any bacteria that might be in it. Baking soda can reduce the time it takes to recover from a canker sore, though it's hard to predict.  -Orajel Mouth Sore medicine. Orajel makes a mouth sore medication that you apply directly to the sore - it contains a numbing agent, but also forms a seal over the sore - oftentimes what makes a sore most persistent is that it gets continuously reopened and irritated by your teeth, so the protective coating prevents that. The coating is really impressive - it stays very dry in your mouth, completely removes the pain, and is strong enough that you can eat while having it applied. The problem with it, though, is that applying it means touching the sore, which often re-opens it - and once the seal is formed, the sore doesn't get any air, meaning it takes it longer to heal. So the Orajel medicine makes them much easier to live with, but also makes it take longer for it to heal. It's up to you whether it's worth it - for me, it is, although if you have a significant other, good luck getting them to kiss you with your mouth tasting to them like antiseptic!    As far as prevention goes, one thing stands above all else: switch to a non-SLS toothpaste. Sodium lauryl sulfate is the agent that makes toothpaste foam up when you use it, and it's been strongly correlated with canker sore formation. One study showed that 80% of individuals suffering from canker sores who switched to a non-SLS toothpaste noticed a significant improvement. I, honestly, was skeptical, but finally I tried one and I've only had a couple sores since - and the ones I've had have been much, much less painful. I used to get them all the time, and often times several at once - it was horribly painful, but switching toothpaste has helped incredibly.    Non-SLS toothpastes are hard to find - check Sensodyne's first, they make the only non-SLS toothpaste I've ever found on store shelves. Make sure to look at the ingredients, though, because some of theirs do have SLS - only a couple of them don't.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/c...|`|3pnOSgzlaa	it's a mouth ulcer, pretty much a small round thing in your mouth which is very painful.

Usually causing another period.|`|Sa5WsCmYaa	The morning after pill contains a very strong amount of hormone, it can cause you to have some unusual bleeding after taking it because you are taking such a lasrge dose in one go.  Don't worry about this - it probabaly was just your normal period. You are usually advised of this by the clinic/chemist when you buy it but unfortunatly some places don't bother.  They also should have told you to do a pregnancy test in 4 weeks just to make sure it is negative,    Best wishes =)|`|6HBlHO8Faa	morning after pill hormones are alot higher than regular birth control..and one of the most common side effect is irregular bleeding and can cause ur period to arrive early or late. This is usually normal but if it last more than 10 days..i would say go see ur doc
pzLDXL6gaa	Don't worry, this is normal after taking the morning after pill. It's really common that the next period after taking it is late.

ApEkhjcDaa	you need to work out your abs a lot, so do sit ups and excercises that work your stomach muscles. Try going to the gym for motivation and good equipment. good luck :)|`|KppM3VzAaa	It depends what you are like now.  You need around 8% body fat to get a visible 6 pack.  Get your weight in kgs. Multiply your kgs x 1.56, this will tell you the amount of protein in grammes you should be eating per day.    Also find out how many calories you burn (RMR -resting metabollic rate, men ave 2000 cals/day, women 1500).    Then eat the right amount of protein, reduce your calorie intake 500 below your RMR and research shows you will lose 2lbs of FAT per week.    Best to eat 4 - 6 small meals per day.    Exercise wise, you need to do 3 20 mins sessions per week. Choose your machine, running, rowing etc. Do 5 mins at a gentle pace, then up your pace each minute for the next 4 mins, repeat this cylce. Then the last 2 mins the gentle pace to warm down.    Combine these you'll burn fat.     Then weights wise you need to do all round weight, building back and buttocks helps to burn fat.  To build abs you need to do stomach exercises as well as obliques.    Hope that helps|`|pJ3TNB6uaa	That would be very difficult, but good luck!|`|cw5nfgXEaa	Hey bro,  If you don't like sit ups, there are leg raises-which you hang from a bar above your head (arms straight) and raise your knees right up to your chest side to side, up down. You can also keep your legs straight doing it which works all different areas if you alternate.  If you really want a good ab work out I recommend crunches, which is similar to sit-ups.   From Davo|`|cc07346154ea873f885bcde6cb7230b9aa	I know how you can get a six-pack in 10 minutes!    Step 1: Get in your car.    Step 2: Drive to the nearest grocery store.    Step 3: Purchase six-pack.      If you mean the other kind of six pack, then it's time for a big reality check. Even if you could get a six pack in a month, no one would be able to see it under whatever body fat you have, and body fat can't be spot-removed. It disappears gradually from all over your body. Why not toss out that silly goal and focus on healthier eating and incorporating exercise into your daily routines? Start jogging, do some crunches, etc. Need to take this slowly or you won't be able to sustain it.|`|2jMFurDoaa	i dont think that's possible unless you work out all day long    you should do ab exercises those would be the best exercises  defiantly run!

Even just 50 a day for 1 month would be really good, but the more you can do the better. Do as much as you can until you get tired.    Do proper sit ups, which means sitting all the way up. Don't use your back or your arms to help you, just use your abs. Make sure to keep you legs/ feet completely still.    Like I said before, do as many as you can per day.|`|S7GqsRWDaa	Cardio is the main thing to get abs, because everyone has a layer of fat covering their abs, so without low bodyfat its impossible to have abs.  Abs are easy to get if you can keep your bodyfat low.
kXq90b09aa	You should be burning at least 2 pounds or more in a week cos every 3500 calories is 1 pound! Are you sure what you are eating is not more than what you are burning? hope you aren't taking a lot of fats and carbs!     To get results, you need to keep going for at least 3 months and by then if you see no results I suggest you go and see a physical fitness expert, a doctor and a nutritionist.

Seriously, your not a man.|`|ctwY8wm0aa	Depends on a bunch of factors. How long have you been eating like this? If it's only been a couple of weeks, then it's not long enough to see a change.    You should also check out the type of food you're eating and make sure it's healthy. Lastly, everyone's metabolism is different. I'm sort of the opposite, I eat more than 2,000 calories a day but I can't seem to gain weight no matter what I do.    Do a bit more research online and try figuring out what's going on. If you can, go see a nutritionist / health professional and they'll give you real advice.

tXgzgiEoaa	Pls. check if you have these signs & symptoms:    What are the signs and symptoms of vaginal thrush?  Vaginal thrush commonly causes a thick, white, curd-like ("cottage cheese") discharge. It may either have no odor, or there may be a bad odor, especially during menstruation. It can cause a lot of itching and irritation both inside and outside of the vagina. The vulva (vaginal lips) may look very red and inflamed, and may burn, sting, or itch. This irritated and inflamed tissue is fragile. Scratching or sexual activity may cause small cuts. In very severe cases, ulcers may form, and other bacterial infections may occur in the damaged tissues.     If what you're experiencing matches the one that you have above, there's a possibility that you have vaginal candidiasis, which is a yeast or fungal infection.  therefore, if you have such, then don't treat it with antibiotics because antibiotics target the bacteria.  what you'll need is an antifungal.    How is vaginal thrush treated?  The standard treatment for vaginal yeast is to place an antifungal medicine inside the vagina in the form of a cream or suppository. Treatments are usually used for a few days. However, if you have HIV infection, you may need to use the medicine for a longer time to keep the infection from returning.    The following are common antifungal medications. Most of these work equally well. If one medication doesn't work, another one should be tried. Some formulations of these medications may be purchased at any drugstore without a prescription.        * butoconazole (Femstat)      * clotrimazole (Mycelex or Gynelotrimin)      * miconazole (Monistat)      * nystatin (Mycostatin)      * terconazole (Terazole)      * tioconazole    Creams and suppositories are safe to use, even if the infections frequently return. However, some infections simply won't respond very well or at all to these treatments. These yeast infections will usually respond better to oral antifungal medications such as ketoconazole (Nizoral), or fluconazole (Diflucan). Again, a single dose treatment is not recommended.    There are also home remedies for yeast infections (boric acid, garlic, or betadine) that may work well for some women if used correctly.    Can vaginal thrush be prevented?  Primary prevention of vaginal yeast is not possible or wanted because normal amounts of yeast are needed for good health. Some women find that it helps to prevent recurrences of yeast overgrowth if they limit the amount of sweets and sugar in their diet. It also helps not to douche and to wear cotton panties and skirts or loose-fitting pants to allow the vaginal area to "breathe."    If infections keep coming back, you may need another pelvic exam to confirm the diagnosis. You can use the cream or suppository treatment on a schedule that keeps the symptoms under control. This might be once a week, three times a week, after sexual activity, or whatever schedule works.    If recurrences become bothersome it may be useful to take stronger medication using antifungal pills ketoconazole (Nizoral) or fluconazole (Diflucan). These medications will usually hold down vaginal and oral thrush if used. However, over time, the fungus may become used to these medications and the medicines may not work as well.    Ketoconazole (Nizoral) or fluconazole (Diflucan) can cause side effects (rash, nausea or abdominal cramps) and can interfere with the action of other medications. They also require monitoring for liver and kidney problems. On the other hand, for many women who have suffered with constant vaginal thrush, weekly oral medication provides great benefit. Talk with your doctor about whether taking medicine to prevent chronic vaginal yeast infections is right for you.    Remember, though, that these are just FYIs for you.  you need to be diagnosed & treated properly by the doctor.|`|xHvuJZaSaa	ok. first thing you need to do is to Stop Scratching your vagina! I know it's hard to do if it really itch. To help you do that wash you vagina with something minty like mouth wash or tooth paste(not to much) and clean your vagina first (do this as needed until you see your doc so you don't scratch). try to clean the inner part of your vagina also, you can do that with a 'Douche'  Make an appointment with your GYN ASAP!

c8DjPjp5aa	Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) can occur when there is a disruption in the balance of the sympathetic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is the main control center for regulation of subconscious body activities like sweating. The sympathetic nervous system is a division of the autonomic nervous system. We do not have control over the autonomic nervous system, therefore we cannot generally control the amount of sweat we produce.   Medications for hyperhidrosis include sedatives, beta-blockers, and anticholinergics (medications that block the substances that are responsible for nervous system activity.) The side effects of anticholinergic medications include dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.  These side effects often significant, and anticholinergic medications are often not well tolerated by patients.  Sedative medications are useful in treating excessive sweating that is caused by stress.   Special antiperspirants containing aluminum chloride hexahydrate  are often effective for sweaty palms.  They work by blocking the opening of sweat glands.  These topical medications are simple treatments that are easy to apply, and usually given at night.  Side effects include skin irritation.

The best accurate weight, would be the first thing in the morning after you use the washroom.    And as for calorie intake, its better to not think about it as much. Also, dont just look at the calories, look at the fat, trans fat, sat, sugar, and put all of them into consideration.

( assuming you're a normal sized person )    but i assume you're overweight, so being female. you're probably at 2200 or more     so, like i was saying, its simple    your body burns 2000 calories in 24 hours even if you eat or don't eat. doesn't matter    if you eat 1300 calories a day, you're short 700 calories    the body automatically breaks down fat to compensate for those 700 calories    IT DOESN'T STORE FAT!! WTF !!! HOW THE F*)(*& DID YOU COME UP WITH THAT? like seriously. gtfo out of this section.    anyhow. sorry about that, that person pissed me off, hence me takint he time to actually answer.    Keep your diet going. remember that if you make your body break down 3500 calories, that's one pound of fat burned! doing nothing, simply " being " and no work out. the best way to do it :D! gj|`|FaVYRoXqaa	To answer the poster above me who`s so convinced your body can`t store fat...    If you go below your basic metabolic rate, your body will go into `starvation mode`and will keep anything you eat stored as extra fuel because it thinks it won`t get food again.    I`m female, eat 2200-2500 calories a day, and am completely fit and healthy.  But if I go under about 1700 for a period, my body will start to store what I eat.|`|NNdkhCy0aa	I wouldn't put it quite as strongly as Archange - not into swearing, but I do share his/her sentiments.  Firstly, before I get a bit techy, let up on yourself.  If you don't the guilt trips you are feeling are going to have two effects.  1)  You will feel guilty and binge drink  2) You will have an up-and-down calorie intake which will play havoc with your metabolism and hormones.  You won't, in short, lose any weight.    Eating habits should be counted over a whole week.  Your body can change to eat more or less over that kind of period, so it won't suddenly  store all the extra carbohydrate overnight from one hit.  If you did the same over 3 days then you would start to notice a difference.  One blow out will make no difference.    Weight loss is achieved by lowering your calorie intake to no more than less than 200 your daily required amount to keep maintain it.  So if you are an average woman with average activity you need about 2000 cals a day.  If you weight train or run significant distances then you can up that to 2500.  Less 200 cals is a good daily amount.    There is this wonderful thing called the metabolic rate.  Wikipedia defines metabolism as:  The complete set of chemical reactions that occur in living cells  And metabolic rate as The speed of metabolism   It is a natural process from cave-people when there was a scarcity of food and you needed to keep fat layers around you.  A slow metabolism means you dont burn the food you eat as fast, so you dont need as much to survive.  What triggers that physiological slow down is not eating as much  the body thinks that there is a scarcity of food so goes into power saving mode.      How does knowing about metabolism help you to lose the fat?  If you have been trying to burn stubborn fat you may have had a restricted diet.  Your body by now will have slowed its metabolism down.  Slow metabolic rate is the number one reason why people find it hard to lose.  To speed it up, increase your calorie intake a little, eat really good quality food, and eat those calories over a 5 meal period.  Your body then will realise it doesn't have to hold onto its last few calories.   You also could change (or start) your exercise program.  Even light weight training will make a difference because weight training has been proven to be the best thing to increase your metabolic rate, especially using multi joint movements.  You dont need to worry about packing on tons of muscle, just using medium weights with a 12-15 repetition set should do the trick for you  burn fat but not build too big a muscle.  Of course if your aim is to build muscle then lower the reps and increase the weight.      The point is, eat the same number of calories every day, 200 less than your maintenance amount, see if you lose.  If you do, about 1 or 2 lb a week, leave it and enjoy life.  If you need to, drop by 50 cals the following week and keep doing that until you see your body weight starting to drop.  It is the healthy and safest way to lose weight and keep it off.|`|afkygHMgaa	You are doing your diet wrong anyways. At only 100 calories a day, your body will think it is being starved and actually start to STORE fat so you lose weight slower. One day of blowing your diet is not a big deal. Go back on the diet tomorrow but remain at a MINIMUM of 800-1200 calories|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear    I wonder how you can survive on 100 calories a day.|`|UKLdPLqTaa	I feel your pain. I know just what its like to be doing really great on a diet and then lose self control and just go crazy, its so discouraging. But sweety, I read a book call "Diets Don't Work," and it changed my life. I'm not a salesperson or anything but I heard about the book and bought it used on Amazon.com for like 2 bucks. It really made me realize how crazy dieting really is. 100 calories is not enough to live on, and when you lose the weight and start eating more your just going to gain back all of the weight plus some. I've been there a thousand times. There is a way to start eating like a thin person and lose the wieght, and keep it off for good, and it doesn't entail eating 100 calories a day. Trust me, there is a better way.|`|HhK1DWvmaa	You will die if you continue to eat like this, your body enters catobolism at half of your caloric needs and starts to eat muscle tissue to survive.  Guess which muscle it goes after first?  Your heart...|`|SITgGHWaaa	Of course! But to lose weight, you have to get used to eating a smaller amount of calories a day, so you're less likely to have random binge eatings    :D good luck!|`|Fy0H8999aa	if u wana loose weight at home without exercising  u can refer to this website  http://medifastweightlose557.notlong.com  and u ll find tips and weight lose recipes  to loose weight easily|`|1dYbzX13aa	just get back on the wagon and don't worry. You may lose a battle this week, doesn't mean you have lost the war! get right back on it and it will shift, good luck to you x|`|ype5N1qEaa	no you have not ruined it. keep going :)    I don't know what you "blew out" eating, but I am assuming it was not necessarily large QUANTITIES of food, but more likely food that is high in calories- maybe a weakness, cookies? candy bar? something like that? If so, here is a little tip to help avoid something like that in the future.  Everybody has their unhealthy foods that they just LOVE.  (Mine is ice cream).  Although it is higher in fat sugar and calories than you would like to be taking in, you still want it and you can't change that.  The tip is to not deprive yourself.  When I tried to cut ice cream out of my diet completely, I'd lose it every week or so and eat like half a carton (not exaggerating) in one sitting.  I learned that you are better off letting yourself have a little a day, that way your body doesn't get deprived enough to crave it.    I have tiny little desert dishes (holds about 2 TBL spoons of ice cream) and I allow myself one bowl a day of the tiny bowls.  I measured it out and its between 1/4-1/2 a serving, and it takes me a while to go through a carton.  In the long run I don't eat nearly as much ice cream AND i get to have some every day! It makes the carrots and salads and yogurts and everything all worth while, because after dinner I get ice cream :)      good luck
MhfneF0xaa	Yeah, man, that's a UTI. You may still have it, although drinking lots of water is good. Cranberry juice helps, too, but if it doesn't go away in the next day or so, see your physician.    And congratulations on not being sexually active. At age 18, that's a good thing, and I respect you for it.|`|dBoC8fR2aa	Maybe it due to the lack of water that cause the cloudy urine. Then after you drank a lot, the urine clears up. So there is your answer. From now on drink more water. Sure, everyone can get UTI.|`|72iZuDjeaa	yes, guys get uti infections too.... keep drinking a lot of water,,, if the stinging comes back, go see a doctor for an antibiotic to clear that up dude...
mAp90hEeaa	If you are on an antibiotic - it could be caused from that; it could be an allergic reaction to a food product or any other product that has come in contact with your skin.  It could be bed bugs or fleas.  You need to try to figure out which of these it might be.  In the meantime, you can take over the counter benadryl as directed on the box which will stop the itching.|`|ldAeDaYdaa	could it be a medication.  go to the doctor.|`|tYy2Y9NCaa	well i could be scabies that's what it sounds like to me but go to the doctor to see what it is|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	take a benadryl tablet.this happens to me in the summer,from mosquito bites.  look around in you bedroom for bedbugs.  a friend of ours got infested last year:some friends came over at x-mas,brought the bugs on the clothes?  look on the underside of the bed/mattress,look for blood spots on the sheets:it will mean for sure,its biting you during the night.  look online,as what they look like,when fully grown they are not that tiny!have to throw away the box+mattress,spray and re-spray the whole place by exterminators.Our friend had the place sprayed 4times,2-3weeks apart.  all clothes,bedsheets to be washed and dried at high temperature:drier will kill the bug.

I was always worrying about failing and realized that I wasn't going anywhere without trying. If I failed at something, at least I tried than never tried at all.    Just learn from it and move on to the next obstacle to see if you can pass it. Do not live in fear and be in a rut.

FaVYRoXqaa	All fruits have carbs...that`s one of the main differences between fruits and vegetables.    Actually, most vegetables have at least a few grams of carbs too.      Lettuce, cabbage, and spinach are a few that I can think of that don`t have any, or at least less than 1 gram.    For the record, your body needs carbs to provide energy to the brain (it`s one of the main energy sources), and for the liver.    Bananas, strawberries, and carrots are actually some of the highest fruits and vegetables with carbs Beans and other lentils are worse, as is squash (it is related to the carrot).  Brussel sprouts are pretty high too. ...I swear people just spit out ****.    GI is completely different from carb content.  The GI determines how long it takes for the carbs in food to release in your system, not the amount of sugars or carbs in it.|`|jyRRMQO3aa	bananas-very low fat/carb content.    celery- absolutely has nothing..and it burns calories!    strawberries- no carbs    carrots-great for vision/no carbs...

Lettuce and Cucumber are pretty safe.  I'm on a low carb diet and there the only salad things I get.  I don't really care though =]|`|YupMCYHlaa	Basically anything that isn't sweet has very few carbs.  Beans of all kinds (watch the sauce though), summer squash, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, brussel sprouts, stuff like that.  They have only a few carbs and are low on the Glycemic Index.  As for fruits, any kind of berries (blueberries, strawberries, etc.) have less than, say, apples and pears.  But still more than veggies.    There are lists on the Internet of every food you can imagine with their calories, protein, fat, carbohydrate, etc.   A good place to start is http:/www.nutrition.gov.  They have a page where you can look up specific foods.

Hold your breath as long as you can.     5.  Put something sweet, like a spoonful of sugar on the back of your tongue.      6.  Suck something sour, like a lemon.      7.  Put your fingers in your ears and gently wiggle them.     8.  Poke out your tongue and give it a good tug with your fingers.      9.  Take an antacid with magnesium in it.       10.

uWQ0oHTwaa	That is not really an average 16 year old weight but it is OK to be a little bit over weight. Just include more exercise in your daily schedule and they are calling you "fat" because people say they don't want to hurt feelings but the truth is they really don't think you are fat and don't think that anymore hun! Its not going to do any damn good! Remember just exercise and you will do just fine.

But the best thing to do is to decide what you want to do. People probably tell you that you are not fat to spare your feelings when what they really should be telling you is that you should try to get into shape and you can do it. My best advice for you is to just walk, jog or run everyday for as long as you can, eventually you will lose weight and gain stamina. If you can just do some push ups and situps as well. If you have a bar, dips and pull ups are great as well. I recommend doing these to failure, 3 sets. After that, you basically waste time instead of really benefiting.Till you can do like 15-20 without getting tired which will take you a while. I wouldn't recommend weight training yet cause you still might be growing. This routine though should help you get into shape. I'll admit it might be a bit tough at first and if you can't do a pull up or dip, lose a little weight and try again. This should help you get into shape and have you feeling better about yourself.

K97esxDsaa	Think of it as a matter of scale.    When you use ATP in your brain, it is to move tiny, sub-cellular parts to pump molecules in and out of neurons.    When you use your muscles, you're moving more (and bigger) cells in a more dynamic way.    It's essentially the difference between moving a pebble and a mountain.    It is true, however, that you burn more calories when concentrating on a difficult mental task than when relaxing. I think it amounts to something like 3 calories an hour.|`|NIYYN6tpaa	Good point.

dIILbEBMaa	The trick is knowing who the girl you're talking to is. Saying you don't know how to talk to "girls" is very generic. Some are harder to talk to than others, while others are quite easy to talk to (if you hit the right topics). I like to watch from afar. Reconnaissance, if you will. Find some topics that she likes and talk to her the way you would anyone else (except not). The hardest part is finding an excuse to talk to her (i.e. Asking about a school [or other] subject she's good at) You should find that once you nail the "common interests", it'll go much smoother. If you don't find any, then maybe she's not for you.  It's a process, but it's worth it... Most of the time... Respect and compliments are key!    P.S. I recommend not having sex yet even if people look down on you for it. Wait for marriage. It'll make it a whole lot better. Trust me. Besides, the best girls think it's awesome when you tell them that you haven't done it yet. It can also ruin relationships if done to early. (Gah!

saG3rgnzaa	You should make soup. Make meat soup and boil it a lot and all the good stuff will be in the soup, you can just throw the meat away. It's easier for the body to absorb liquid.    Eating fruits and vegatables, of course. Fish is good, well, you should eat a little of everything, but not too much since you dont burn much energy when sleeping. Eating in the right time always helps, some when at 5pm-7pm.    Eating before you sleep will only add fat. So don't do that.

Recall the artwork you have seen depicting the saints. Their halos represent spirits - often referred to as the Holy Spirit. When you have this feeling on the head, you are experiencing this phenomena.    Do not be fearful or concerned as this spirit's presence is a blessing. If you wish, you may communicate with it. How one talks to oneself, in the mind, is how one communicates with a spirit. Start by thinking, "hello, how are you," or something similar. You will hear its responses in your mind as if you thought them. This is called telepathy and is how spirits communicate. It is also how God hears our prayers.

Eat mango and banana.  5. Take more oils and fats.  6. Eat four or five times a day.  7. Eat sweets and chocolates in between intervals of meal.    DO REMEMBER  Your diet program cannot work without better Metabolism and good Digestive System.     To improve metabolism and digestions:    I. Walk gently thrice a day for 15 to 20 minutes.  II. Take sugar mixed juices or liquids in sufficient quantity about 10 minutes before walk.  III. You can also take juices or light sweet foods during the walk.|`|mm2CLE03aa	I have the same problem,     for both weight and health reasons i'm planning on doing a few day internal body wash (search it up) and a 3 day juice fast, along with my herbs (dragonherbs.com)    Its ironic that I'll be skinny as hell cause I lose weight with any missed meal, but by cleaning the digestive track, getting rid of toxins and giving my body a break with a fast, I'm hoping my metabolism will stabilise and I should gain the weight back faster.    I'm still learning atm.|`|cc07346154ea873f885bcde6cb7230b9aa	It's not an issue I've deal with personally but I've heard that orange juice is a simple, healthy way to introduce calories into your diet and put on weight. Also brown rice and other high-fiber, nutritionally dense foods. If you exercise, try to focus on strength training and very light cardio instead of any heavy cardio like running or basketball.
AA11614449	Actually you can't do that with salmonella.  It's a bacteria and by taking in small amount over time will cause the bacteria to grow resistant to his body's immune system.  Just because he recovered doesn't mean he's resistant not like chicken pox (which is a virus).    Sorry no|`|mAp90hEeaa	He's a fool if he does this because all of the symptoms that he had to get treated will come right back.  And, the salmonella has now had a chance to multiply in the peanut butter and could be twice as toxic as his first exposure.  This would be a foolish thing to do unless he wants to die.

rog4GDgaaa	Get to the ER ASAP if you have taken an overdose of Tylenol. If you're not sure it was an overdose- contact a pharmacist (like Walgreens is open 24/7) or poison control.  It's extremely toxic to the liver. Ibuprofen more harmful to the kidneys but less toxic than tylenol overall.  If you go to ER they may give you mucomist (you can take some now perhaps?) which helps bind to Tylenol in the blood stream to make it easy for the kidney's to clear. It's awful stuff- but works well.  Get help fast.      However- if you are taking tylenol and ibuprofen together they aren't the same drug- and can be taken at the same time.  Ibuprofen is rough on the stomach sometimes, and can be what makes your stomach hurt (tylenol OD is not going to give you major stomach pain).      Hydro and oxy together may not be a good combination. Often mixed with Tylenol and could make you OD. If in doubt a pharmacist is your best resource, not us.  Have the bottles for your meds handy. If you took oxy and hydro together the amount of Tylenol is probably not dangerous but best to be safe.  I think having 2 opiates would be more dangerous in that case.    P.S. both hydro and oxy can upset the stomach. If I take hydro I get severe pain- I simply cannot tolerate it.  Look at what you took and ask. Have I said that enough? Always wise to err on the safe side.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, how much tylenol did you actually take?  Also keep in mind that the hydrocodone and oxycodone that you are taking most likely have tylenol in them as well.  Well, the hydrocodone definitely has something else in it, since pure hydrocodone is not prescribed in the US, and its usually with tylenol (vicodin, lortab, etc) or with ibuprofen (vicoprofen).  The oxycodone is also most likely combined with tylenol as well, if your bottle says something like "oxycodone w/apap 5-500" it has 500mg of tylenol.    If your stomach is hurting a lot, thats more of a sign that you took too much ibuprofen, since the ibuprofen tends to upset your stomach, but ibuprofen and acetominophen (tylenol) are different medications, and while both are NSAIDs, they can be used together.  When it comes to ibuprofen, dont take more than 800mg (400mg is the standard dose on the bottle, but prescription strength is usually 600mg in the US, some other countries prescribe 800mg pills, so that won't really hurt you much)|`|5LR1RZelaa	They're two different medications.  However much Tylenol you took is how much you took.  As long as you didn't take more than 4 g (aka 4000 mg look at the bottle to see how much each pill is  multiply it by how much you took) your body should be able to take care of it on its own.|`|C9th0daNaa	they both live in a bottel|`|3Y1ondDraa	Check the boxes if they have similar active ingredients.|`|OvKssKkraa	Ibuprofen and Acetemetin (Tylenol)|`|TSsT8QGgaa	tylenol and ibuprohen are TWO different drugs (on my dr's advice i have taken them together) now if you are taking tylenol WITH hydrocodone and oxycodone you are taking too much.  i have been on alot of medications but i dont think you should take oxy and hydro together  i would call your dr/pharmacist and seek advice.|`|P9HPKKxzaa	Don't ever mix when you're taking those over the counter meds. Just go to the ER. Bring the bottles with you if you can and tell them how many of the pills you took in 24 hrs. You can die from these meds and it is not quick death. It is slow and pain full.
zD8GmnHxaa	Stress, illness, or physical distress (sleep deprivation, weight loss...) can make your period late, or in extreme cases, even make your periods stop.  Variation in your cycle can be normal - especially if you can identify the cause.  Listen to your body, if you are experiencing symptoms leading up to menstruation, most likely your period is on it's way, even if late for whatever reason.  If it doesn't come soon, or you are too worried about it, or if your body tells you something is actually not right, it's probably a good idea to schedule a gyn appointment.|`|b3JKcQXGaa	Don't worry yet. You're positive there is no possibility of pregnancy huh? Well, sometimes stress can make your cycle bounce back and forth. Stress can even make you miss the period really. But I would say, if you don't have your period within the next week, you could consider seeing a family doctor just to make sure. I'm sure everything is fine tho! Good luck! Best wishes to you!|`|eqWftUQeaa	Are you sure it's not possible? As in, you haven't had sex at all??? Cuz it sounds like a case of prego to me, but if it seriously can't be that than your period is just late. I don't think you need to stress too much, that happens to me sometimes too. Stress actually can make your period irregular, so can an unhealthy diet. If you are still worried, go see a doctor.|`|eXJOdwzcaa	have you just recently in the past few months started a new birth control?    if you have, sometimes it takes a while for your period to get regular.  also, you might have an irregular period, which a birthcontrol will help.  are your periods always really heavy? if so id recommend getting on birthcontrol, not for sex and stuff, but just to keep your period regular.    since you say theres no chance of you being pregnant, your totally okay.  you might skip your period, that happens with a irregular period.|`|KQPDtrw8aa	Stress and diet can really affect a menstrual cycle.I wouldn't worry yet.|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Stress can be a big factor. Sometimes women just skip one once in a while.|`|rcRoF7WNaa	Not everyone is regular.  Factors mentioned above like stress, weightloss, extra physical activity etc can delay your period.      Once you stop thinking about it, it will come.  Relax, there's nothing wrong with you. :-)|`|wJ45gsyZaa	your cycle could be changing because of the women you are hanging around with. I would give it another few days before I get concerned as if you are hanging out more with someone than you used to you could just be synchronizing.  Our bodies are so weird hey? No wonder guys are weirded out by periods..
jRqXZV6Oaa	This is nothing to mess around with.  It could be a staph infection - the same bacteria that is called MRSA is a staph infection as is the flesh-eating bacteria.  See a doctor if at all possible.  Staph often causes wht is called folliculitis in warm moist areas and in hair follicles - can turn into boil-like infections and be dangerous. You could try some topical antibiotic like 'Triple Antibiotic' cream which would show an effect within a few days.    It is not uncommon for women with pendulous breasts to develop fungal infections similar to jock-itch under breasts and in armpits where it is moist and warm.  Fungal infections don't normally have green pus-filled blisters, though.  You could try some anti-fungal cream on it for a day which should give pretty quick relief if it is really a fungal infection.    In the future, try a medicated powder like Gold Bond in those areas to keep down the moisture and avoid repeat infections.    It is highly recommended that you see an MD, as you may need some oral antibiotics just in case it has spread to your bloodstream.|`|TKbYavhzaa	Sounds like an infection to me.  Hard to say, could be fungal or bacterial (maybe Staph).  See a doctor!|`|YK1JuIlWaa	tell your husband o take it easy for a while|`|mAp90hEeaa	You could have a skin infection of some sort or you could have chafing from some clothing.  I would let your doctor look at this and get the correct medication to prevent this from spreading more and getting worse and worse.|`|XSBsomfVaa	Possibly the sweat where those places are. You might want to see a physician about this because I've never heard of this before. Yeah. Greenish puss is bad.
xHvuJZaSaa	Well my dear friend I have been through that situation and I know how it feels. Most common reasons why you have not have your period yet are  1. You are pregnant  2. Stress out  3. Unhealthy diet    If you know you have not have intercourse or if you are sure you are not pregnant, then here are some things you may do to help your period come sooner.    Try to relax and eat a healthy diet.    1. Meditate or listen to music if it helps realist stress.  2. make sure you have fresh vegetables and fruits in what you are eating. (Green vegetables are preferable example:  fresh spinach)   3. Drink healthy drinks like V8Fusion and water.  4. If it is possible do a little exercise or Yoga.  5. Prays if you are a believer.    Good luck and have fun at Camp:)|`|bTCDP3Bzaa	Because you're a dude.|`|dBoC8fR2aa	Sometimes period can be late or if you are pregnant then you should be worrying. The doctor can prescribes you contraceptive pills to keep you not having periods till you stop taking them. Talk to him or maybe too late. You should have done this earlier.|`|eXJOdwzcaa	well you could be pregnant if you've had sex.    and you could be developing an irregular period  which is no big deal, you just need birthcontrol.     you'll be fine, just get an appointment with a gyno, and get birthcontrol.     also at camp, wear tampons.  they make you cramp worse, but its good for movement.  i use them every period.|`|34d2e55662fa047f84fc8828a81ce35faa	There are many reasons why a period may be delayed. It doesn't sound like you are very sexually active so I can assume that you being pregnant is not what it is.Usually the calprite is stress. Stress can alter your body's chemistry and therefore alter your body's cycle, which may either make it come earlier or later. For me it's always been later. As far as I know there really isn't any way to make it come sooner than it will and stressing over it isn't going to help. Sorry. Good luck and God Bless!
KzcDt8V9aa	I had a tummy tuck done in May with an excellent doctor.  His name is Terrence Murphy and he is located in Clarkson st.  in Denver.  He did an EXCELLENT job on me..I would recommend him to anyone. The cost, I really can't tell you exactly because I have insurance, and even though the tummy tuck is not covered, since I had an umbilical hernia, the insurance paid a big part of it!      What I can tell you is that he has affordable prices..at least more than others, and that his customer service is EXCELLENT!

Also find out how many calories you burn (RMR -resting metabollic rate, men ave 2000 cals/day, women 1500).    Then eat the right amount of protein, reduce your calorie intake 500 below your RMR and research shows you will lose 2lbs of FAT per week.    Best to eat 4 - 6 small meals per day.    Exercise wise, you need to do 3 20 mins sessions per week. Choose your machine, running, rowing etc. Do 5 mins at a gentle pace, then up your pace each minute for the next 4 mins, repeat this cylce. Then the last 2 mins the gentle pace to warm down.    Combine these you'll burn fat.|`|PHKSoUTDaa	My wife once told me that the quickest way for me to lose 20lbs of ugly fat was to cut my head off.

Slightly off the wall - if you hate dieting like I do, try this:-  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQv1JBZ19...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggWZsve_U...

At the first dose I had hepitis b aswell at the same time obviously in different arms lol i am 14 and the first time i was scared sounds weird i no but i dont like needles but i felt faint and that was only coz i got myself worked up about it. i do no someone who had a reaction to it but it was nothing to serious. I didnt mind the 3rd dose and the 4th was fine too. To be honest I am not afraid of needles anymore. It only hurts if u think abt it hurting so i would recommend your daughter to have it.    Good luck|`|eXJOdwzcaa	is that the gardisil shot?    if so, ive had it. the only thing about it is it hurts, and makes your arm feel like you've pulled a muscle. everyone ive talked to theirs have hurt.  it burns when they inject it.  i didnt have any side effects though.   its a VERY good idea to have your daughter do this before shes sexually active.   if she already is, its still a good idea to get it anyways.

043fd49ed24f3c53dace2353445a5442aa	Yes it can...gees guys, please don't answer questions you know nothing about.    Basically there are three factors that affect your chances of a successful treatment - how old you are, what genotype you have, and your current health.    You can get on a combination therapy of pegalyted Interferon and Ribivirin. Interferon is a self administered shot once a week for 24-48 weeks (depending on genotype). The Ribivirin is a pill taken twice a day (dosage is based on weight).      If you have genotype 2 or 3 then you only have to do the 24 week therapy and have a 60-80% chance of clearing the virus permanently. If you have genotype 1 then you have to do the 48 week therapy and have a 45-55% chance of clearing the virus.     I had to do the 48 week therapy and it was successful for me back in 2004. Still clear today, so I would say that I am cured. So if you have decent insurance, do not wait to get treated.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	No, there is no cure.   With treatment, some people get to a point that the virus is not detectable in testing.  It is still there, however.|`|mAp90hEeaa	Very few people are successfully cured of Hepatitis C.  Naomi Judd (singer) participated in an experimental drug trial and I believe she claims that her hepatitis is now cured.|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	My uncle died just over 50 years old because of HepC. He used drugs and drank and smoked so it killed him fast. My aunt who is 67 was recently diagnosed.....she has led a clean life. They tracked it down to a blood transfusion she got in her twenties. So hers never showed up in blood tests, yet it was always there. There is no cure....but she is currently going through a series of painful shots...the side effects are just like chemo. In cases where they caught it early this treatment helps it go back into its dormant state.|`|AA10213842	I'm in aggreeance with Errsguy. Folks, if you don't know the answer, don't answer.    YES, HCV is curable. The correct term for cure in the HCV world is "sustained viralogic response" to antiviral chemotherapy. Some can actually clear the virus on their own, but very few actually do.    The rates between antiviral chemotherapy greatly differ from those that clear on their own.     All genotypes combined, the cure (or sustained response) rates are about 55% to 86%. Those that are lucky enough to clear on their own remains at 15% AND the body would clear itself within 6 months- so usually those that clear are those that have acute hcv infection.    Nothing else works as far as HCV so don't fall for the jargons out there. Too good to be true means it usually is- not to mention a waste of money!
pHhICD6Baa	Try p90x.    Seriously.      Its worth it.|`|zKJAS2UNaa	Make sure you plan a good diet dont over endulge stick to 3 - 4 meals a day preferably 4 if you need the energy but 3 if your sedentary or resting that day.|`|0WskQuVvaa	You need to work out 5 days a week. 2 days at the gym 3 days cardio and if you do sport on saturday thats 6 but definately leave sunday for regenerating energy.|`|yUoa678Gaa	Slow and steady wins the race. Start slow or expect more injuries. Patience is the key when you are coming back from injury down time. Your muscles have a memory so light weights and lots of cardio for the first 3 weeks and then you can start upping the anty.    To get ripped, never work out with the same routine for more than 24 days straight. For example if you do bench presses as a core exercise, change them to dumbell flyes for 3 weeks. Always keep shocking your body. After roughly 3 weeks your muscles get resilient to routine and won't grow or perform as well as they can.    Also play a ton of bball, squash and swim like a frikin fish. Treadmills are for Old Uncles, and they aren't easy on the joints either. Do an aerobic sport, it's better than running towards nothing for 45 minutes.     Eat smaller portions of lean white meats, fish, (with balanced carbs and vegetables) 6 times a day. Diet is THE most important part of a successful fitness and body shaping program. Plan your meals, start juicing, and set specific goals.    Do a cycle of creatine. Drink a protein shake one hour after you work out. Work out 6 days a week, 1 or 2 body parts a day, allowing 2 days of rest for each body part.     Circuit train on alternate weeks. Most importantly, work through the pain and have patience!|`|31fDBuLjaa	You could have done 50 push-ups and 20 pull-ups and some crunches in the time it took to post this question.

0TT5q0cUaa	The following techniques may be beneficial in delaying ejaculation:  The "stop and start" method  in this method, the man learns to recognise the stage after which he cannot control ejaculation. The treatment method trains the person to remove the stimulus just before that stage is reached so that the urge to ejaculate is controlled. For example, when during masturbation, the man reaches a point just before ejaculating, he stops the stimulus until he starts losing the erection. Once the stage is past, he can resume the activity. This process is repeated again and again until the individual is able to delay ejaculation till the time he wishes. This method called the 'Masters and Johnson method', is most effective when the help of the partner is sought during actual intercourse.    The squeeze technique  in this method, the partner gently squeezes the tip or base of the penis just before the point of ejaculation thereby "cancelling" the orgasm. This process can be continued until the couple decides mutually to reach the climax.    Desensitising creams and gels are available in the market that reduce the sensitivity of the penis and help men reach climax later. Some men also feel that condoms reduce the sensations and, in addition to providing safer sex, help them last longer.    The couple can also experiment with sexual positions as some positions offer more control than others and may help to delay ejaculation.|`|mLl9OXmjaa	you can check out a personal experience with this guy how he stopped premature ejaculation... http://www.herbalsexshop.com|`|WgruZkHRaa	It's in his head.

Good luck! :)))|`|61TSstGxaa	It sounds like you had an anxiety attack.  Your heart most likely did not 'stop,' it was probably palpitations or actually sped up.  You should see your doctor, but please don't freak out over this.  Anxiety attacks usually are not a serious condition, and many people have them at some point.  If you feel depressed, make sure you mention this to your doctor.  If it happens again or starts happening regularly, take note of what it is you are doing when the attack comes on and mention this to your doctor.  Hopefully this is not the case, but drugs can also cause those sensations.  If that is the case, it's much more serious.  Good luck and take care of yourself!|`|IpXoXV15aa	do you have any problem?

Exercise wise, you need to do 3 20 mins sessions per week. Choose your machine, running, rowing etc. Do 5 mins at a gentle pace, then up your pace each minute for the next 4 mins, repeat this cylce.

MhfneF0xaa	No, buddy, at your age Prostate Cancer is almost unheard of.    There a few other things that it could be, though.    One is a prostate infection. Had one myself less that a year ago.    Another is a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). Yes, guys do get them.    Another possibility is a bladder stone. They are rare, but I've had a couple.    But I'm 59!    Chances are, in your case, it's none of the above, and no big deal. You say it happened last night. If it hasen't happened again, and doesn't happen again in the next day or so, forget it!    If it does happen again, you'll need to see a physician. It's not a big deal, but if it keeps happening, it's probably something that won't go away on its own, but needs to be taken care of.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Have you been sucking on too many sugary sweet soda's?

wPW7NZegaa	You should stop masturbating right now.  Of course it has effects on your body. Increased blood pressure, high heart bit rate, a lot of hormones and substances eliminated in excess into your blood.    When you masturbate the level of testosterone goes high and you start to sweat. More sweat, more greasy face, skin and more acne you get.    If you have noticed that the acne is related with masturbation you should stop immediately.    Don't forget, as more you masturbate as more you wish and probably you'll get PGAS syndrome. (highly aroused almost every time)    I know someone who masturbated (not too often, really) and now he has uncontrollable ejaculations and urination, joints pain and fatigue + sleep disorders.    I suppose you don't want to ejaculate in the middle of the street or next to your family.    People say it is good because they think if it feels good then it is good. Wrong!

0z3UNzwkaa	It depends on where the pain is. If it is in the back, between the shoulder blade and the spine, it will be the supporting muscles of the shoulder, the rhomboid, do massage and stretching. If it is under the shoulder blade in the back, it will probably be the subscapularis, one of the rotator muscles, again, probably massage and stretching. If it is on the scapulae, above that ridge that goes crossways, that is the supraspinatous, one of the most commonly torn muscles of the rotator cuff, more difficult to treat. massage, pt, maybe some surface acupuncture, re-hab. if it is above the shoulder with point tenderness on this sticking up part, there is a joint there called the AC/acromioclavicular joint, ice it, rest it, that is about it. If it is in front of the joint, that is more of a problem, it could be a capsule or a bursa, more difficult to treat, not good.    So, depends on where the pain is. If you have insurance, go to a chiropractor who also has a physical therapy and re-hab section in his office or to just a physical therapist.  I have a nice re-hab section in my office, partly for shoulders. At our office, we try to have a combination approach to getting patients out of pain, combining medicine, chiropractic, acupuncture, physical therapy, re-hab exercises, massage, nutrition and prayer.    Medicine  If it is mild to moderate, why do the NSAIDS such as Motrin, acetaminophen, and aspirin that are hard on the stomach, intestines and kidneys?  Why do prolonged Tylenol, it is hard on the liver?  Why prescribe the narcotics?  However, if the pain is moderate to severe and the person cant get to sleep, which causes them to be more pain sensitive, and the severe pain is causing more muscle spasms, causing more trigger point pain, I do prescribe different meds.  These may include narcotic or non-narcotic pain meds, NSAIDS, and muscle relaxants, as long as other things are being done at the same time, for a short time.    Chiropractic  from the years I spent studying, by back goes straight up, as it should, until it gets to T4, when it tilts over to the left.  That bend at T4 is where I get my pain.  The rhomboid/subscapularis/levator muscles go into spasm, causing active trigger points, with their associated local and referred pain.  If you follow that forth rib around to the front, that is where I get costo-chondritis.  Chiropractic care is great for this pain.  Acupuncture- I have treated patients for pain management with good results.  For a couple classes, I wrote a couple non-published literature reviews on acupuncture use for pain management.  Not the end all and do all, but a powerful tool.  Physical therapy- the electrical stimulation units.  The TENS units.  Traction.  Great stuff  Re-hab- important, I do re-hab exercises every day to keep my bad knees and shoulders strong.  I get upset at patients I treat for pain who do not do their re-hab exercises at the office.  Vital.  Massage  great for active trigger point pain.  When you get into Rolfing type of work, it can have an effect on the persons posture, which will effect their pain.  Nutrition  I also wrote a nonpublished literature review for one of my classes on the use of glucosamine for arthritis.  I believe it is helpful.  If you get into the whole deflame diet where you try to decrease your white flour intake, increase the green vegs, some nuts, nutritional supplements, etc, it can also do great things.  Also will effect the weight which will effect the pain.  Prayer- again, no co-pay, no adverse side effects.  I feel everyone should include it in their treatment protocol and I feel it will help.  I feel the prayers of a mother for a son is very powerful.    So, that is my soapbox speech.  I think medicine is good, but it will not cure everything. Chiropractic is good, but it will not cure everything, acupuncture, physical therapy, re-hab, massage, nutrition/herbs are all good, but they will not cure everything.  I might get flamed for this, but even Christ could not cure everyone, many people in his hometown could not get cured because of lack of faith.  Some are better than others at certain conditions.  Sometimes you have to combine all together at the same time.    e-mail me if I can be of additional help, click on my profile for my e-mail address.|`|xDOp37T7aa	Any acetylcholinesterase inhibitor should work just fine like muscle relaxants. ~200mg diphenhydramine HCl (Benadryl) has anticholinergic effects on the body.

rR630Nclaa	Some people get hallucinations from smoking weed. Paranoia is also a side effect from smoking it. Your stomach pain is nerves, you may also get diarrhea from stressing about your panic attacks. I dealt with panic attacks that started from smoking weed. I thought I was going through the tunnel of life and that I was dying everytime  I went to the ER. It took me a few years to get over them. What helped me was Cognitive Therapy...take deep breaths, realize this is all your in head when a panic attack occurs and taking Lexapro, which is a SSRI antidepressant that also helps with panic disorder.|`|oKqVqCN3aa	man that sounds like the best trip ever ..... untill u went totally paranoid and let out what was probly lerking beneath, i remember you saying your dad has had panic attacks for 30 years! connection? to be honest that was either amazing weed that u just reacted badly to, as every one has their own limits or it was laced with some nasty chemical or class A ****.

qEy34ueZaa	Most definitely. They are very protective of their nests. Keep the dogs away and get a can of spray designed for wasps (Dept. Store, Home Depot, etc.). When it gets dark spray/wet the entire nest. The wasps will fall like flies as the spray stream hits them. Once it is over, make sure to scrap off and bag the nesting material.  Observe later on. Use the spray for any future approaches, until they become discouraged. Note: wasps tend to build their nests on decks, underneath any flat surfaces. Periodically do an inspection.  The sting hurts, doesn't it? I have been stung many times, but always ended up having the last laugh.

VzVzncfXaa	This herbal slimming tea is not likely to be harmful, and it certainly won't cause explosive diarrhea like some weight loss products.. You may even lose a few pounds of water weight.     In fact, I would recommend this tea if you are a woman who spends one week out of every month trying to squeeze into jeans that normally fit.     But, for actual, long-term weight loss, this tea will not melt the pounds away. There is nothing in it that would increase your metabolism, and nothing in it that would suppress your appetite.|`|7954cda805f3cfc75f5d833dbc7dd8f2aa	yeah that tea causes everything in your stomach to be expelled... no wonder you have diarrhea... hey but it does not make you lose fat it just gets crap out of your system, so once your body has been cleaned out you stop losing weight ( but its a good thing at least you cleaned your stomach)|`|dBoC8fR2aa	Yes, slimming tea causes the diarrhea. That's what it is intend to do. To have you purge all what you have eaten so that they are not left long enough for absorption. So in fact, you are under-nourished.|`|cGazG1Tuaa	Stick with water and eating healthy.  No diet pill or fad is going to work better than eating healthy and exercising.

And you'll gain it all back when you stop sipping the teas.

It mixeds cardio and toning.  hope it works out for you!|`|FaVYRoXqaa	You can`t spot train, meaning your body will lose the excess weight where it does naturally and you can`t do a damn thing about that.|`|qWy104afaa	You can't lose fat from a just one specific part of your body. The rate at which your body gets rid of fat from a certain area goes according to your genes. So your goal should be to just lose fat overall, or as a whole.

If it happens early it isn't as traumatic...still very sad.|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	stillbirth is a full term baby that is dead, the women has to deliver it any way. a miscarriage is usually at early pregnancy when the baby aborts.|`|brSfRLspaa	still birth goes to full term but baby is born dead, miscarriage baby dies and pregnancy spontaneously aborts|`|NlMm6JOTaa	A stillbirth is when the baby is actually born dead.

The term is often used in distinction to live birth or miscarriage. Most stillbirths occur in full term pregnancies.    Miscarriage or spontaneous abortion is the natural or spontaneous end of a pregnancy at a stage where the embryo or fetus is incapable of surviving, generally defined in humans at prior to 20 weeks of gestation.

Miscarriage is when the baby dies during pregancy when the pregancy is not over.The baby is not fully developed.
pzLDXL6gaa	Yes it's common for your period to be irregular shortly after coming off the pill. 32 days isn't too far off an average cycle, so I wouldn't worry about it unless you don't get it at all for another week or two, in which case you should talk to your doctor about if this is okay.    If you've been having sex since you came off the pill, you could be pregnant.    Harriet|`|g6pqGjrkaa	Your stage is abnormal. The period should come in 27or28 days.check up with you doctor please.

kA0xb0MVaa	Back in the day, there was an old wives tale (which may or may not be true) that cravings for vinegar meant that something is wrong with your liver.  I have read several holistic articles saying that cravings for vinegar come from your body lack of micro organisms in your digestive tract.      Biologically there is some studies that point to the fact that cravings are your body's way of dealing with a deficiency of some sort.  But they still are fairly unsure what each craving would signify.    Having said that paranoid schizophrenia makes the host do things that are nonsensical to most of us.  I would point this out to both her doctor and her psychiatrist.      The smell is coming from the vinegar.  You can not wash it away.  My sister is also mentally ill, and when she does crazy things like this I use reverse psychology on her.  For instance, I would ask her why she was drinking the vinegar, once she told me I would tell her that I read somewhere that eating grapes was a better way to cure her problem.  Something like that.|`|eDykHvX1aa	Some people drink vinegar to keep thin, but it cooks your organs and can cause kidney failure, she should really go to the doctor or therapist.|`|dsWxq0vyaa	Never heard of this before... but I know some people drink vinegar to try and lose weight or some crave it if they have diabetes... I don't think vinegar is bad for you but if you can smell it then she probably drinks too much since apparently she perspires with it.  Ask her why she does it. This would be the best way to figure out if there is a problem or not
etHWfGBFaa	Yes, because when we are under stress, our adrenal glands are designed to secrete the hormone cortisol. Cortisol has a direct impact on the sex hormones estrogen, progesterone, and DHEA. Eating disorders, dieting, drug use, and reliance on stimulants like caffeine and alcohol are also interpreted by the body as kinds of stress. Poor nutrition seems to physically change the proteins in the brain so they can no longer send the proper signals for normal ovulation.|`|zIMlCnVsaa	Yes it can but take a pregnancy test just in case or see your doc.|`|g6pqGjrkaa	Tension and anxiety may may upset your period some times. the ovulation of cyst may also makes the same problem so check with gynaecology doctor and treat well.|`|HEb9nQeFaa	Yeah it can, try eating well and try to calm down a little. Breathe deep and go with the flow. Maybe its just irregular. Good luck x.x|`|STumBiU0aa	yep, that happens to me once in a blue moon when im really stressd|`|xHvuJZaSaa	No worries.   Try to relax and eat a healthy diet.  1. Drink a lot of fluid. Also make sure you drink healthy drinks like V8fusion and water.   2. Try to have fresh fruits and vegetable in your diet. (Preferably fresh green vegetable like spinach.)  3. Do anything that might relist stress and anxiety. Example: listening to music, Yoga, and exercise.  4. Pray if you are a believer.   5. Take a home pregnancy test after about a month if no sign of your period.  6. See you Doctor if you still dont have your period.    God Bless :)|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	yes it can, when i m stressed i  miss a month|`|tf6or5uJaa	Stress and emotional upset can make you miss your period.  Also some medications that you take can also delay it.  Condoms even if they don't break are still not 100% preventative against pregnancy.  Take a pregnancy test as soon as you can.
Yhj82wl4aa	I'm just finishing up phase 1, and I was in the same situation as you.  Believe it or not, 1 serving of chocolate milk has fairly comparable nutrition value (look it up if you don't believe me) and it's WAY cheaper.  I also take a multivitamin with it.  I put a scoop of whey in my morning milk too and take a flax seed oil pill, (you can get both of those fairly cheap as well).  I'm seeing results while not breaking my wallet, which is equally important to me.  Best of luck.|`|fef3832ed001896078d73efd2b54d99eaa	EAS has some products which can help you.|`|YIs51Vp8aa	The P90X formula has a lot in it.  If you really do not want to sacrifice what it has since it is a unique product you can always join the Beachbody club.  It is very inexpensive (comes to about 12.99 per month I believe) and you get 10% off all products so it will knock the Price down a little.    As and alternative Beachbody also has the Activit multi vitamin.  The Toning formula may be what you want and it is almost 1/2 the price (not quite) does not have everything that the P90X formula has but it is a very good multi wit some additional supplements to enhance muscle tone (when used with exercise of course.)    There is even an option to being a Beachbody coach that gets you 25% off all products so that may be an even better deal for you.    Hope that helps|`|yUoa678Gaa	EAS has Myoplex products.

jRqXZV6Oaa	Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell.  They are normal but can be increased in certain conditions.  the most common conditions causing eosinophilia (increased percentage of eosinophils) are asthma and parasitic infections, but there are many other causes too.    Mild eosinophilia on one test is nothing to worry about.    ANA is Anti-Nuclear-Antibody.  What this means is that you have antibodies to something in the nucleus of your cells.  Antibodies are what we produce to fight infections.  If you have antibodies to your cell nuclei, it can mean that you have an autoimmune disease like Lupus or Rheumatoid Arthritis.    When the pattern of ANA is speckled, it means the ANA is not to your DNA or RNA in your cells.  This is a good sign, because DNA and RNA ANA patterns are common in Lupus.  Also, a titer of 80 is not very high.     This report is something that should be checked on in the future, but not really to worry about now.   .
uz8rZMG8aa	Congratulations on losing all your weight, well done!  Definitely adding your calories slowly is the way to go, and keeping active, but I do know that a dietitian can help you with planning out a great maintenance diet to allow for all this stuff.  Good luck and I hope you do great!|`|FaVYRoXqaa	Well continue what you`re eating now, just more of it.  Slowly work your way up to 2000 calories, otherwise your body will store what you`ve eaten, especially if you`ve been eating this way for a while.  Like add on 50-100 calories per week until you get there.|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear    Loosing weight and maintaining is all about Lifestyle changes. If you start eating normally you will gain more weight then before.  Since you were dieting your body Metabolism has slowed down. Your body will process fewer calories and the rest will be deposited as Fat.  You should be eating a balanced diet of about 1800 calories a day and do exercise everyday and have a good 8 hrs sleep|`|SI0PhJ5naa	It depends, your body has a healthy, natural weight which it will always tend to lean towards.

CyNFIa99aa	Its because our chromosomes are what make up our proteins, and our proteins make up our muscles, bones, brain, hormones, etc. So if there is extra genetic material in the chromosomes, then the "recipe" for proteins are changed causing the muscle tone problems, mental delays, and other health problems you see with DS. each of our chromosomes are so specific with certain proteins in certain areas of our body that even PARTS ON the actual chromosome itself accounts for certain proteins for very specific areas of our body. In DS, they believe it is really only the upper 1/4 of the 21st chromosome that when in trisomy (or an extra copy equaling 3 instead of 2) it is only the top part of the extra chromosme that acounts for all the health problems you see with DS, amazing isnt it. Look up www.ndsa.com to learn more about the genetics of it. Good question.|`|csYnTVeGaa	The fact that a person with an extra chromosome is even born alive is amazing in its self. There are only a couple of chromosome abnormalities that a fetus can survivor. An extra 21st chromosome is one of them. I talked with a OB/GYN that told me that most miscarriages are caused by a chromosomal defect in the fetus.     People with Down syndrome are amazing people. If you ever get a chance to get to know one take advantage of the opportunity. You'll make a eternal friend.    They may have some delays and health issues, but I know a lot of "normal' people that don't function normally.|`|ltSQ8SoXaa	it gives out the wrong signals its like a formula a really long formula that is unfinished or has an extra protein in it which causes the problem.

2E08nZR3aa	It sounds like you've got a lot of different machines and ways to work out. I don't think you need much help with it. Start out small by exercising thirty minutes a day three times a week and increase your time and frequency over the course of a month or two. Keep a schedule and log of exercising.    Keeping lists of your calorie intakes are also a smart idea. Try to have around 1200 calories a day and have a 0 intake of any soda or sugary drinks. Also, make sure not to skip a meal and have a small snack in Between major meals to up your metabolism.    I also have asthma and am a borderline diabetic. DDR was a great success for me, and I played for about an hour a day and lost twenty pounds in one summer.    The main trick is not giving up. It's a good idea to cheat here or there with some sort of treat or unhealthy meal about twice a month so you don't end up binging.|`|uxWc4Ivaaa	go to youtube and type in 5 min abs...there are like 6 or 7 diff workouts that go with that one...they work!!!|`|Fy0H8999aa	if u wana loose weight at home without exercising  u can refer to this website  http://medifastweightlose557.notlong.com  and u ll find tips and weight lose recipes  to loose weight easily|`|FaHuLB3Saa	For a start, good on your for being healthy! It's something your body will thank you for on the long run..    Then you need to know that being healthy is not something you do once and that's it... You will have to watch what you are eating and exercise for your entire life. I know it may sound a bit depressing at first, but eventually it will become a routine and you won't even notice you're doing it.    Now, if you want to loose weight, I suggest you use your bike for 30 minutes every morning, before having breakfast. The reason why you are doing it before having breakfast is that your body will be forced to use your fat to have enough energy. However, once you are done, you can have a nice, healthy breakfast (muesli, fruits, no sugar, water).    Then in order to gain muscle (and remember that muscle is heavier than fat, so your weight might increase due to the muscle mass), you need to use weights. So for each movement you do, you need 15-20 repetitions. Once you are comfortable with the weight, add more weight. There's no point in doing 100 sit ups everyday, instead do 20 sit ups with weights (by the way, I used sit ups as an example). On top of that you need to give your muscles a rest. So you can work on your cardio (riding a bike) daily, but don't work on your muscles (i.e. weight training) daily. Twice or three times a week is enough for weight training, as you need to give your muscles a rest. If you like to do some weight training daily, then I suggest you change muscle groups, so Mondays could be legs only, Tuesday core, Wednesday arms, Thursday legs, etc... This way it will give your body a necessary break.    Also, if you have any health problems like a knee injury and asthma, swimming is a very good alternative. Not only swimming allows you to work on your cardio (i.e. loosing weight), but you will also gain muscles and you don't put any pressure on your body.    Finally, whichever solution you go for, make sure you do the movements correctly, if you don't you can really get hurt.|`|ziHYFQpkaa	DDR is great for weight loss. not so much if on the beginners level but if you can get up to standard or heavy level and play everyday you'll lose weight! That's what I've been doing, and haven't lost a lot but I've lost 5 pounds so far.
eW9rE0jOaa	no, different protein sources have different amino profiles, some sources dont have the full compliment of amino acids    Furthermore the biological value (BV) of protein sources varies, which basically means some sources are better absorbed by the body than others. Whey (like that found in shakes) has a higher BV than Tuna making it a better protein.    But for most people it doesnt really matter, people built muscle and got by without protein shakes in the past...its just more convienient for a lot of people to have a shake.|`|FaVYRoXqaa	no, not all protein is the same.  Some are missing amino acids, and some need to be combined with other foods to get their full benefit. Whey (cow`s milk) protein is the best.  It`s best to have a variety of protein sources.|`|Fy0H8999aa	if u wana loose weight at home without exercising  u can refer to this website  http://medifastweightlose557.notlong.com  and u ll find tips and weight lose recipes  to loose weight easily
5oNwMqMiaa	Tampons are an amazing invention and to be honest, once you get used to them, you will wonder how you lived without them.  You shouldn't feel them when they are correctly inserted and you will be able to swim with them.  They 'plug' the hole, so there is very little chance of it coming out or the surrounding water going red (try it out in the bath!), just be careful to tuck the string in to your bottoms.  Try with some applicator tampons in the next few days, there are good instructions in the packs.  Most importantly, relax about it.  So many women use them everyday and you will get comfortable with them.  Good luck in the swimming carnival :-)|`|QGwEwb0daa	If you put in a fresh tampon,it won't fall out,nor get the water bloody.And if you put the tampon in right,it won't feel uncomfortable,you won't even be able to feel it.When you put in a tampon,if it's uncomfortable,take it out,throw it away,and try again.Also,it's near impossible for a tampon to get stuck,so don't worry about that ;-)|`|brSfRLspaa	no, no, it can't get stuck, they are great for swimming, and, this may be a lot of information to process considering you've never used tampons before but, if you fold and tuck the string between your inner and outter lips it stays dry and hidden. You don't have to but it's just one of those tricks you learn over time|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	it wont get stuck. just make sure the string is out. but make sure the string stays inside your bikini, lol, it wont come out either, they are up there pretty securly until your ready to remove them.|`|9iOHAC41aa	Chances are it won't fall out. I use tampons and go swimming all the time and i've never had one fall out. The water won't go all bloody either, i promise. It's perfectly safe.     It may be a little uncomfortable at first, especially since you've never used one before, but you get used to it. Eventually you get used to it. Just make sure you put it in all the way, because if you don't it will hurt. Also, since it sounds like it will be towards the end of you period, you may want to buy the light tampons, they're smaller and if you not going to be heavily bleeding they work just fine.    Good luck in your race.
4ec5baf736e5e1b4200f6e39ea8eda12aa	Boxing is about more than just physical strength, your power will help a good deal but you also need lots of stamina, speed of mind and fist, a very strong will and foremost a fighters skill. I would expect you will find other boxers who are not as muscular as you and some stronger, its how the whole package comes together that counts. I've seen fights where the smaller of two fighters has won easily because of superior skill.
uz8rZMG8aa	I've heard doctors say that poor sleep can contribute to weight gain because you're so tired, and burning more calories than usual, so you tend to overeat.

xhjSPd0uaa	nope u have to pay for clear ones as the reason they are clear is for cosmetic reasons and not health. i think its about 300 depending where u get them. braces arent all that noticeable anyway aslong as u dont smile with a big grin. when i saw my friend for the first time after i smiled an sed "LOOK!" an she said "what?" an i had to say "my bracess" an she was like "oh yeh" LOL    nice colours are baby pink and baby blue :)    i got my top brace fitted last week, i was so scared i was crying before id even got in the room! and i can honestly tell the fitting of the brace is painless, a few hours after you feel sensitivity when biting chewing food or clenching teeth together, so if you take a painkiller and eat soft foods for a while you'll be fine    the  time you have your brace depends on how straigh/twonky your teeth are before the brace, usually ranges from 9-18monthes, then a retainer is worn for a few monthes after, and u MUST wear this retainer when told to do so for a certain amount of time, a friend of mine didnt wear it and her teeth moved again! so havin her brace all those monthes was pointless.    no it doesnt make your top lip stick out noticeably, with your mouth closed noone would ever know you had a brace.    theres nothing to worry about, and think how lovely ur smile will be after!!|`|cc1eedd4ec08792a3946f30dd974c11faa	no you can't and there is no guarentee that you'll get your braces free on the NHS anyway  average time of having braces is about 18 months|`|vl0HWTDJaa	You have to pay for invisible ones. On NHS they're all the same silver ones and you just get a choice of bands. The average time is about 2 years to go through both the fitted braces and a retainer but the amount of time you have each one depends on your teeth. If they're sticking outwards you'll need to wear the fitter ones for longer and if they're outwards you nees to wear the retainer for longer.    When they put it on, it doesn't really hurt until they put the wire in tight, then your teeth are all pulled tight together and it feels uncomfortable but it will only last a few hours every time you see the orthodontist and he tightens it, so don't worry too much because it's not like it's going to be permanently uncomfortable. Try taking some paraccetemol or something just before you go in to make it more comfortable.    It can make your lip go out a little bit. A lot of people develop a slight curl in their top lip but it won't look really weird, it'll probably only be you that notices it.     You'll be fine, don't worry about it too much and just remember even if it does get painful, it's not going to last for long.|`|Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi Bee,    go to www.vitaleurope.co.uk they are in Oxford Circus.

BMI and health charts are just a generalization. Check your body fat.    If you do need to change weight eat more calories. Eat healthily, everything in moderation, but more of each things. Add more carbs to you're diet. Drink protien shakes or meal replacement drink between meals. Choose higher calorie choice like bananas instead of apples, orange juice instead of flavoured water, full fat instead of low. Eat more regularly.    Make sure you take in more energy than you put out. This doesn't just mean through exercise, it's through general living too.    Consider if anything is causing you to be underweight. Stress, over working, illness, etc.    You're best to see a doctor or nutritionist for advise.|`|VpU4Aludaa	My opinion is.....to  1-Choice Your breakfast.  2-Eat nuts and fruits.   3-The most important point to eat as much as whatever you want and you'll be skinny.  :)  Lovely weekend.  Thanks.
pSryQTckaa	De and Snippet took the words out of my mouth. Take charge. My mom is the same way so I have to make my own appointments and such. [I'm 16. Just one year older. ^^]     You're not a failure ok? Don't ever say that. Your mind wants to go to school and wants to be well, but your body is not cooperating. It's NOT your fault ok? It's going to get better. I suffer from the same thing as you, you know. I, though, am home schooled since a surgery I had last year...so I have it a bit easier I guess. Don't worry, teenage years are very rough on the body. Things will improve.|`|AA11565057	As a starter, I would suggest you take the initiative and make the appointment yourself with the therapist, and tell your mother you have to go.    I think you definitely need to work on getting your sleep under control, and it may also be worth talking to a doctor about getting some antidepressant medication, which will help with the anxiety, which will in turn help with the sleep. Some antidepressants (e.g., mirtazapene) are quite sedating at low doses (e.g., 15mg) and it's wroth thinking about this.    As far as avoiding things, don't. Don't give yourself the permission to skip school simply because you haven't slept. You aren't going to die from lack of sleep due to anxiety. Avoidance of the thing that you're anxious about will only make you more anxious in the long run, but I think you will need some help from a Psychologist to get through your anxieties.    I really hope things start to look up for you. I am sure they will!|`|BLD9EEWNaa	I totally understand- in my senior year of high school I missed seventy days because of anxiety/ schizophrenia.  Ask your mom to make an appointment and have her do it while you're in the room.  And don't forget to get an excuse note from your doctor/therapist.  If I remember correctly, it's really stressful to be counting the days you're out, and you're therapist can excuse you.|`|xIG518Wfaa	my recommendation is a trip to your GP, maybe try get some anti-depressants and sleeping drugs to help you sleep. If you think no one will take you seriously, visit yourself, its good that you take yourself seriously.  best of luck|`|NTEuxMVmaa	Make your own appointment to see the doctor,tell them your situation that you wrote about.If you really want help bad enough there is always a  way to get it. Maybe a neighbor can take you,the bus,a cab,a relative. Good luck|`|4KSxuQ8Saa	At your age, life can be pretty scary. As your mother is busy assisting your grandma and your Dad appears to not understand you, the only person who can change your situation is you.    Start taking charge of your own life.   Consider a plan that you can use each night to start winding down and getting ready for bed. Have a warm bath, use some candles ... relax and let the worries of the day leave you. Have some warm milk and go to bed.   Once you start a regular pattern, you will feel improvement. Your brain needs time to defrag and sleep allows that to happen. If you don't defrag, you fall to pieces instead.    School can be tough, but you will get through it. I wish you well.
qsqmykzsaa	You will be ok. Don't put yourself down. You are being honest here, with us and with yourself.  I can't help but think this may be a left over childhood reflex. Did a parent tell you that all of this stuff is dirty?    As an adult, this is normal for you. You are not dealing drugs, or doing anything illegal.  If you are in a relationship would you still do this?  Doesn't really matter, but your partner wouldn't like it.  Partners like to know they are keeping the other satisfied. I wouldn't wan't my partner to do it.  Do what you enjoy. No one has the right to judge you.  Be happy and proud.|`|mTK8noEAaa	whack off first and then see if you still have the urge to pay 2/min on sex chat|`|rsdKX1fyaa	.......and here, ladies and gentlemen, we have a prime example of someone who has more money than sense.

JgU9vaP4aa	yes it could be. I have hypo thyroid and i am told alot of ladies get this after having babies. Most often when it does happen this way it will go away after a year or so......but i do think you need to get your TSH and your T3 and T$ checked. it doesnt hurt to at least go get the blood work done.  but what your saying does sound like it.  good luck|`|R3W6szSUaa	hey,i dont think its an overactive thyroid.. becuz after i gave birth i was also loosing weight.i think thats becuz when we are pregnant we get hungry and eat for 2 pple.after we give birth we breast feed and if you dont get hungry you are still loosing alot of energy, cuz you are not eating enough.you are light headed cuz of that.so i dont think you should worry ..try to take vitamins and ensure or some vitamin drink if you cant eat.it will help you gain weight and keep you energized... ho0pe i helped!!!!!!!!!|`|H7L66ynJaa	It sounds like post natal stress to me but please see you doctor or health visitor straight away as it is not good for you or the baby if you feel this way.
7b6d9b71ec244bad6e5e7cd334ec64e6aa	Here are your options:    Try more antibiotics and creams and things (i tried many of these and none worked, some made it worse, a few worked for a little and then stopped helping)    Keep up a healthy diet and keep out anything you think triggers spots ( left me with a boring diet and becoming paranoid about everything i ate, some things are really bad and i still avoid them but otherwise i gave up on this method as i saw an improvement by keeping out the worst offending items but not enough of an improvement to keep up the full regime)    Try accutane (i did this, yes it has lots of side effects and makes for a difficult few months handling the total loss of oil production and really really dry skin all over) but while taking it the spots disappear completely as they can't form without the oil in your glands to infect. You just need to put up with the side effects and be prepared that when you stop taking it your spots may return, mine did but not to the same extent they used to and i'm much happier in my life now. I may try another dose of accutane in the future to see if a second course of it will rid me completely as i'll be better prepared this time.    After getting rid of the spots after accutane i ended up with a problem of rosacea, the skin becoming red very easily and i had to get laser treatment for that, wow, we go through a lot to sort out our skin.    You also need to realise everyone is different and just because someone else can use the creams and get them to work or eat a load of junk and not get spots doesn't mean you can and it sounds like you have very sensitive skin like mine and if known about it from birth i could have dealt with it better as i grew up but i didn't i learned the hard way of what causes the problems but now after years of having spots in certain places, they easily return to that same place because the skin is damaged.|`|AA11395970	I don't know, why are you?    If you haven't been to a dermatologist, then now is the time to go.  He/she is up to date on diets, antibiotics, and other meds that can help your skin.  Take advantage of his/her education.    It is going to take a while for anything to act.  It took a while for your skin to become damaged.    Once the doctor puts you on a regimen, stay with it.  These things take time to work.    I am speaking from experience with my grandson (whom I raised).  He has beautiful skin now...well, except for the sun and wind damage caused while he was in Afghanistan.|`|1831ede9e27aa3948ecfe643b6ae8bfbaa	I don't understand - if it's for acne, why didn't your doctor give you a cream for it?

The best possible way to get yourself to sleep is to put your eyes and brain under some sort of stress which tires them down, usually this is reading a book or concentrating hard on something, sitting infront of a computer screen does make you concentrate but the light being emmited from the screen jolts our brain awake because when you go to sleep, your usually in the dark, and even a bit of light can stop the process of sleeping in its tracks.    read a book for about half an hour, you may find yourself drifting off on the spot...|`|7sivs9y2aa	hold your breath until you pass out|`|GBXvJ5mjaa	That always happens to me.

ZFH4c15Taa	Because I'm sure you have family or at least someone out there who loves and cares about you. Killing yourself is selfish. Think about all those people who die from cancer and are unable to have a chance to live their lives. They would give anything to not die and be with their families and do the things they want out of life. You are lucky to be living, and as I said, selfish to end your life when many others would do anything to have one.     Thinking negatively will always pull you down further. You say you try hard, try harder. Get to where you want, and don't say that you can't, because if you do you are weak. Try and try and try. Don't let the negatives get to you.

FicyC2TXaa	If we knew the answer to that we'd be well on the way to curing cancer.    The fact is nobody knows what causes cancer, or why of two people with the same risk factors (or lack of them) one will get cancer and the other won't. Cancer affects the healthy and the unhealthy alike.    Smoking has been linked to lung and some other (not all) cancers, and excessive sun exposure to skin cancers. The sexually-transmitted HPV virus has been linked to cervical cancer. Up to 10% of cancer cases are hereditary.    Other than that we're still pretty much in the dark as to what causes cancer.    It's often less frightening for people who haven't had cancer to 'blame the victim' - that is, to blame cancer on avoidable lifestyle factors like bad diet, stress, lack of exercise etc - than it is for them to accept that cancer is a largely random disease that can strike any of us at any time.    Cancer happens when normal cells change so that they grow in an uncontrolled way. This uncontrolled growth causes a tumour to form.    Nobody knows what causes this to happen. That's what makes cancer so frightening|`|6SB4ufEYaa	Everyone has cancer cells in their body. It just takes something for them to grow/multiply/mutate    Noone really knows the answer to that.    Of course there are known triggers;     -Some viruses  -Junk food. Excess salt, fat, chemicals.  -Red meat  -Lack of exercise  -Lack of sunlight  -Too much sun  -Smoking  -Drinking alcohol  -Living near pylons  -Some medications    Plus many other things that people aren't sure about.     And then there are the people that live totally healthy lives and still get it.     People are working hard to try and find the answers, and possible 'cures'.    The best thing you can do is to make sure you live a healthy and happy life. Try not to worry about it too much.|`|DfpWFrfuaa	cancer is caused by a malignant(bad kind) tumor.  and this is hereditary or a mutation in your genes when your cells are multiplying.  this is only a brief explanation. there are a lot of different types.  for example skin cancer is from exposure to a lot of uv rays (sunlight).|`|2xysycFhaa	Cancer can effect anyone, I'm 16 now, but when I was 15 I was diagnosed with cancer.

At3epWQwaa	I'm an expert of the Victoria's Secret Angels. Miranda Kerr, one of my favorites, eats goats milk yogurt with granola and chia seeds for breakfast. Did you know if she hadn't become a VS model, she would've been a nutritionist? Anyways, Heidi Klum eats carbs only in the morning, such as bread, cereal, etc. because carbs absorb water, which makes you appear to be bloated. Marisa Miller eats alot and all types of food, but works out like crazy to maintain her figure. Doutzen Kroes eats alot of food from her homeland (Holland) like olives, good quality bread, cheese. I hope this helps. Let me know if you want to know about any of the other models!|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Dont compare yourself to such girls hunny, a lot of them are airbrushed to perfection you know.  I was watching a documentary once about models looking perfect etc and it was said that every little flaw they have is airbrushed.  For  start change your diet; introduce fresh veg and fruit in2 it aswell as plenty of water.  Start your day with hot water and lemon or a herbal tea, green tea or wu-chi teas are suppose to be amazing for a metabolism kick and a help with weight loss.  Watch your fat intake, you know things that ring common sense; careful with fizzy drinks too including diet drinks they are known to contain sweetners etc which can be harmful!  I swear by running, start easy tho, do 10 minutes for 2 weeks then incrrese your speed and timing gradually.
Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi Belle,    Ok let's try and get to grips with this.    Just as every muscle in the body needs a blood supply in order to work, so equally does the heart. Although the heart's job is to circulate blood and oxygen around the body, it needs its own supply of oxygen in order to work.    The arteries which supply this blood to the heart muscle are called the coronary arteries.    In angina one or more of these arteries are a little narrower than normal. Therefore on exertion when the heart needs to beat faster in order to get an extra supply of blood around the body to keep up with the requirements of the muscles etc: Therefore the heart needs its own personal supply to be increased.     As a result of the heart pumping extra blood and oxygen around the body, but not getting enough itself in order to keep this up, you get symptoms....chest pain...shortness of breath etc:    I obviously have no idea where you live bit if it is somewhere that is cold at the moment, that will be the cause of your recent minor chest pain as cold temperatures can affect it also.    You should have been given medication by your doctor to help increase the flow of blood through the coronary arteries.    As long as you keep to a healthy diet and don't fur up those arteries you should be fine darling.    As for pregnancy, as long as you keep having regular check ups and remain under the care of the cardiologists you will be fine.    Regarding birth control, this will have to be discussed with your doctor who will know all of your medical history and will be in a better position to guide you with that.    I hope this has helped a little.    Love Mel.X|`|XGQ3o4i7aa	First of all.. have you shown yourself to a cardiologist and ascertained what exactly is the problem? Do that first.. no charm in speculating! Angina means pain.. the one associated with cardiac problems is angina pectoris.. literally means pain around your chest. its due to sudden spasm of the arteries supplying your heart which is suggestive of clogging of the arteries (atherosclerosis).. also called Ischemic heart disease. If this is the case you need to have it checked thoroughly and start yourself on aspirin and statins(drugs that reduce cholesterol which in turn controls the clogging). If you do take care the risk is less but you must consult your doc to see what exactly is your status. Regarding pregnancy and the pill.. take care as they increase blood pressure which might put you at risk for complications. CONSULT A CARDIOLOGIST FIRST!

y5i8GIFWaa	it is healthy   but freshly made by yourself is by far much more healthy!  just get them ready made salads in a bag,  it usually includes...... carrots,cauliflower,spinach......etc    then use a machine to turn it into soup    i do this.....      anyway   good luck|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	If it is fresh then it should be yes but it's not 'soup' that os healthy or not it is the ingredients.  Therefore soup from a can with a high salt and sugar content is not healthy.  Why not try making it yourself?  You could take it to work in a thermos and you can freeze it at home.|`|321517b8db292e8ce3489dc477fc7fb2aa	A healthy diet is a varied diet. Pre-made soups are high in preservatives, sodium, nitrates, MSG (monosodium glutamate) and other things. Home made soups would be better. It is a good choice, but I would do it only in moderation, and would highly consider home made soups and other forms of nutrition, so as to get nutrients not obtainable in bought soups.|`|PrS7So5Yaa	Soup is fantastic and I eat it every day too- either store bought or home-made (when I have the time.)    Just watch out for sodium and sugar content in store bought soups. My favorite is Campbell's Select Harvest. They're healthier than other product lines, IMO.|`|REdkWRyBaa	Soup is a very good part of the diet. As long as it's not too artificial or high in fat or salt, then it's good for you. Low in calories and very filling.|`|DRSjrp04aa	Yes it is healthy.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	Obviously, it depends, is the answer.  It depends on the ingredients.   You have to check the amount of fats ( animal or vegetable fats ) and any chemical preservatives or additives.  The fact that it is called "fresh" doesn't mean that it doesn't have additives. The best soup is the soup you make yourself  -  try carrot and chive/parsley. You need nothing except some boiled carrots with a little onion and a herb of your choice.  Whizz it all up until smooth.  A swirl of milk makes it look pretty.    Potato soup is just as easy, but it will be fattening as well as boring.  French onion ( just masses of thinly sliced onion in a stock) is very tasty and not at all fattening, and as easy as pie to make yourself.|`|hviykDAraa	yes soup is really healthy and only contains around100 calories per serving. You just have to watch salt in soup as that is usually very high!|`|SJoGjd78aa	Fresh made soup containing a variety of vegetables or pulses ie lentils peas or haricot beans plus using a stock made from chicken or beef bones is both nourishing and healthy. The commercial soups sold in cartons are also usually very good nutritionally and are probably the best you can eat second to homemade. I found some very good advice on all aspects of diet and nutrition here  http://www.getfitnhealthy.net/  Hope this helps|`|KppM3VzAaa	Home made is best, even though it's a snack it needs to be protein based.... all the ones you mention don't have high protein levels.

j6EuNP7waa	Hi Zigg3ns,    It sounds as if when you get the problem your heart always beats faster, rather than at an abnormal rate, so it is unlikely that you have a heart problem like arrhythmia, where the heart beats erratically.    I would have thought that Tachycardia, which is a condition where the heart beats rapidly could be a possible reason for your problem, except that you have had the ECG, and that test came back fine.    My son suffers from panic attacks, and one of the things that many people who do, have in common, is that they usually think it's a heart problem.    It's a good job you got yourself checked out, and I think you should put your mind at rest on the heart issue, and maybe try and get some help for possibly anxiety ?    Your Doctor may prescribe some anxiety medication just to see if that is the root cause of the increased heart rate.    However, in the longer term you should get to the bottom of this problem, because (and please do not worry unnecessarily about this) that long term anxiety can increase the risk of heart disease.    Hope you feel better soon.    Best wishes,    Malcolm.|`|hzCK4ORbaa	If you have had cardio testing, you need to stop worrying! If these things happen when resting, you may need to talk to your doctor about the possibility of panic or anxiety causing these feelings. That was the first way I felt when I was diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder. When I would go to rest, my mind would race about all the things that happened that day, and the anticipation of what was coming.|`|kBZkTtaraa	Your body might be reacting to something in your environment that got past your five senses.

99af71d6c2927cce636eb721484f7c4caa	There's no reason why you shouldn't give it a go but maybe check with your dr re your recent illness.    pros?   Detox diets do encourage some good habits such as eating more fruit and vegetables, drinking more water and cutting down on junk food and processed foods. Plus they encourage you to cut back on caffeine and alcohol  all good habits to get into. They also help you to think about what youre eating and can be quite motivating as you take charge of your health.    And the cons?   The main problem relates to the fact that detox diets can be short on many nutrients, leading to certain deficiencies and lowered immunity. Any weight loss achieved is usually temporary and is the result of a loss of water as well as fat due to the severe calorie restriction. This means you usually put the weight straight back on which can be demoralising and lead to yo-yo dieting. Some people also experience side effects, feeling tired, sick and headachey. Advocates say this is the result of your body detoxing but in reality, its usually caused by a lack of food! Following such a strict diet may also result in you craving your favourite foods whether its chocolate cake or bacon sarnies, with the result that you give into temptation and end up blowing your diet completely. And at the other end of the scale, strict detox plans can help you develop an unhealthy obsession with food and a potential eating disorder. Finally, eating out and socialising are almost impossible  most hosts and restaurants dont product detox-friendly meals with good reason!|`|OdLj07Svaa	you could start out small you dont need to go full blown on the whole detox thing yeah you feel good afterwards but your body has missedout on some vital nutrients so u gotta look out for that you could start out by having a shot of wheat grass juice every morning it tastes like crap but its great i|`|Rk46lIBwaa	I am afraid it is not a question of age, simply naivety. The whole concept of detox is an urban myth.    It grew up from constipated Edwardians, who refused to eat vegetables as they considered them lower class. Instead they used purgatives and enemas.    Most of us are now more enlightened and simple eat a high fibre diet and at least 5 a day fruit/vegetable units.

AA12266052	Hi confucius, A coronary stent is a stent placed in a coronary artery to treat coronary heart disease as part of a procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).  An intraluminal coronary artery stent is a small, self-expanding, metal mesh tube that is placed inside a coronary artery after balloon angioplasty to prevent the artery from re-closing.  A drug-eluting stent is coated with a medicine that helps further prevent the arteries from re-closing. Like other coronary stents, it is left permanently in the artery.  Coronary artery stents, typically a metal framework, can be placed inside the artery to help keep it open. However, as the stent is a foreign object (not native to the body), it incites an immune response. This may cause scar tissue (cell proliferation) to rapidly grow over the stent. In addition, there is a strong tendency for clots to form at the site where the stent damages the arterial wall. Since platelets are involved in the clotting process, patients must take antiplatelet therapy afterwards, usually clopidogrel for six months and aspirin indefinitely.  However, the antiplatelet therapy may be insufficient to fully prevent clots; these and the cell proliferation may cause the standard (bare-metal) stents to become blocked (restenosis). Drug-eluting stents were designed to lessen this problem; by releasing an antiproliferative drug (drugs typically used against cancer or as immunosuppressants), they can help avoid this in-stent restenosis (re-narrowing).|`|qFvHH6lUaa	My mom has had multiple stents put in throughout the years and she had a 6 way heart bypass.  They told her that a bypass usually only lasts 10 yrs before it needs to be redone, but they never said anything about the stents.  So, I'm not sure, but I would guess that as long as there was no significant buildup on the stent itself, there wouldn't be a need to replace it.

1lewFV8oaa	This is really a choice on your part.  My right eye has normal vision 20/20 and my left eye has 20/50 vision.  I drove for several years without wearing eyeglasses when they were prescribed in my teens.  I decided to start wearing them for driving when I experienced headaches and double vision when I was about 30.  The symptoms were worse when I drove at night.      You may experience issues if you drive without them.  I did not have any issues for several years.  Your uncorrected vision in your right is worse than mine so you may have issues.  I choose to wear eyeglasses even though my license does not have the restriction.|`|et39TGIsaa	I wouldn't suggest it, since you put your life at risk every time you get behind the wheel even when your vision is perfect in both eyes.

Also you might get headaches on long journeys without glasses because your brain will prefer both eyes clear, that said i guess your problem is long standing so not everyone in that case even gets symptoms! so basically glasses wouldn't hurt, but you don't need them.|`|Sv2nsqdjaa	Hello Foxy-Girl,  there are several people here that mentioned this - I think using two eyes gives you the best depth perception. Having one blurred (I know how that is - if you remember, we have a similar problem... antimetropia) - just reduces your ability to judge distances and things like that...   I use glasses when I drive... especially since my vision started to get worse.  Take care, drive safely - have fun !  Pink Panther.

u0udwkZQaa	The best sleep is not time in hours but the amount of complete sleep cycles you have. Ever notice that you can feel awake on little sleep sometimes and at other times, you sleep a lot and feel more tired? It's because besides upsetting your body clock rhythms you've probably woken up in the middle of a cycle. An average cycle lasts about 100mins, and the average sleep needed which varies, is 4-5 cycles or 400-500mins, or 6hrs40 to 8hrs20. This is actual time asleep, so you'll need to allow for time getting to sleep, waking, etc. The other point to consider is that the best sleep is whatever you can get before midnight. Sleeping from 9pm to 5am is far better than 1am to 9am, and you'll feel it.|`|GGqh73iWaa	We are meant  to have 8 hrs sleep but we are all so different so go to bed when you are tired.|`|c687e8e8fd1fb4b13de626ebbb55d0e4aa	Well that depends.

I even offered to pay for two appointments in one day just so I could have the procedure done and wouldn't have to hire a babysitter three times.  They said they couldn't though because they had to setup the surgery room and make sure they had enough supplies.

They could confer with your original doctor if you allow them to.    However, if the problem is minor, why don't you simply see your family doctor, why chop and change to new doctors all the time... unless you are just having trouble getting in because your doctor is overbooked... so you see someone else.    If the problem is minor, take it to your regular doctor when next you can see them.
AA11570675	You've got it right!  Actually there are loads of causes of depression. Depression is one of the umbrella terms for low mood, a bit like saying you're feeling ill. Except of course depression refers to how your mind is feeling, & ill refers to how yor body is feeling.  Just to explain the mechanism of depression a bit. All the causes you've listed could come under the heading of stress. A stressed brain will use up its synapse chemicals quicker (the synapses are the zillions of connections in your brain) & so will begin to misfire. The low mood you get can be a warning that you're overstressed. Best way to overcome it naturally is to take lots of exercise - even if you don't feel like it. A good amount of exercise will induce a high. Not only this, but exercising on your own gives you the chance to think through the issues that other people drop on you so that by the time you're done you will have made some good decisions on how to handle things.|`|cJsxRgxzaa	You are right on both counts.  Becoming isolated will eventually lead to depression.  Though, in many cases, depression will lead to isolation..  The two are entwined..    Control:  when we feel we are not in control of our life, this is when anxiety takes over..  We become to feel we have no control of any situation where we find ourselves.  Our anxiety rises, the circle begins..  Anxiety (causes- lead to depression)   Depression then cause anxiety (lack of control of our own lives)    The vicious circle continues..    Once we find ourselves in that perpetual circle...  It becomes harder and harder to find a way out...    So yes, in simplistic terms, you are correct...  I hope you have "sympathetic" views for sufferers of both diagnosed anxiety and depression...

As you review your life you can see how this has happened and when you changed and then your friends and even neighbours changed.   Use this thoughful time in your life to heal deeply and to open yourself to the healing energies around you. A trip to the library and searches on the internet can yield you a lot of information that will be specifically important to you. Depression is anger turned inside, guilt is a sign of your great integrity...but both need to be released.

"Don't treat a cold and it'll be gone in seven days."  There is no cure for the common cold. Various treatments can alleviate the symptoms, but nothing you can do will shorten its natural duration.|`|gCP6uZOvaa	Eat loads of oranges, drink orange juice (the vitamin c will get rid of yr cold)!!!|`|mRWxhlF8aa	orange juice : )  it's the best tasting vitamin c haha|`|sFDIbF7Naa	Take vitamin C.

Also, keep in mind that refined flour -white flour has the same effect on your system as sugar so you might want to avoid that too if your in a hurry to get better.    Drink plenty of water to help cleanse out your body.    Echinacea is an excellent natural remedy its been found to reduce the duration of illness and decreases the severity of cough, headache, and nasal congestion.   http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/623119...    Get plenty of rest, the body heals well while at rest.    Fresh air is great for you too so remember to open a window and if your well enough go for a walk. If your lucky enough to live near the sea get down there for a walk the ionised air has great health benefits.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Go to bed with a hot drink.

A hot whisky toddy will not cure your cold, but it should make you feel better. And if it doesn't, the next one might.     Serves 1     INGREDIENTS    50ml of Scotch whisky*  1 teaspoon of honey  50ml of boiling water    METHOD    If possible, print this recipe and give it to someone else to make, whilst you curl up in a miserable, sniffling heap under a duvet. You are poorly, after all.     Put the whisky into a heatproof container (see below). Put the teaspoon with the honey in it into the container. Add the boiling water. Stir thoroughly with the teaspoon until all the honey has dissolved.     ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES    Use sugar instead of the honey. Add ? of a teaspoon of lemon juice. Add a stick of cinnamon or a couple of cloves.     TIPS    A hot whisky toddy should be sipped slowly to allow it time to work its magic on your sore throat, stuffy nose and aching muscles. However, whilst clutching a whisky tumbler of steaming liquid looks and feels great, hot alcoholic drinks go cold very quickly. A pottery mug holds the heat in better, but not by much. They may look a bit utilitarian, but best of all is one of those insulated mugs with a lid, which will keep it warm down to the last sip.    IMPORTANT NOTE    Please be aware that many over-the-counter cold cures should not be taken with alcohol, so you should be very careful about combining different forms of cold relief. If you are taking certain prescription medicines or are breastfeeding, you may not be able to take over-the-counter cold remedies, but may be allowed a small amount of alcohol. If you have any doubts, please check with a pharmacist or an appropriate health professional.     * You dont need to use your best single malt whisky for  this, and you probably wouldnt be able to appreciate it anyway. Any cheap supermarket blended brand will do just fine.|`|AA11119758	The old saw is-if you have a cold and see the doctor it will last about two weeks.

oog7eBnHaa	You have to heat pack them untill they open up themselves.  Never try to pop them on your own.  There is also a product, though very hard to find called black salve that you can put on the boil and it will pull out the infection.  If your boil gets harder, doesn't drain on its own or causes pain, call your doctor and he will prescrip an antibotic and lance the boil for you.|`|AA11821715	liquid nitrogen, its about -200 F so be careful.|`|jRqXZV6Oaa	Need to know where are they and how big, how frequent, etc.    Some 'boils' have a capsule inside lining the interior.  This capsule must be removed or the boil will continue to return.  If you just open and drain it it will not 'kill' it.    I have had to remove these many times in the ER.  They are quite strange, and when capsule is removed, it comes out almost like a small, soft eggshell that is pinkish in color.      Other 'boils' may be folliculitis (hair follicle infection) and can be staph bacteria.|`|qsqmykzsaa	In my experience, they don't just get better.    I have always had to burst and drain them. Sometimes the germs aren't all removed first time and the boil comes up again. Second time they can burst on their own, well mine do.  Usually, boils mean your system is under stress of some kind.  Look after yourself.|`|XGQ3o4i7aa	First of all dont fiddle with it! depends on where it is too.. best thing is to start yourself on antibiotics (as per your doc's prescription ofcourse!) and let it soften first. Sometimes they resolve on their own.. sometimes they break open and drain.. make sure you have a doc drain it completely till it heals. make sure it is done with all aseptic precautions!|`|PyUDK9IGaa	take it off the stove first then in cold wayter|`|et39TGIsaa	I had a few boils last year, and my aunt (who is a retired pharmacy technician for Walgreen's) told me to get this salve called Smile's PRID.  I did, applied it to some gauze, and covered the area.  Within days the boils had dried up.  I highly recommend it.  It comes in a small, bright orange tin, a little bit bigger than a thing of carmex lip balm.  You can get it at Walgreen's.
6Btmg7Tcaa	I was on the pill for 13 years and never fell pregnant. If you take it at the right time every day its 99% effective. But some antibiotics can affect it as can being sick and ill so check all that out too.  But I wish I could go back on it, I hate condoms being on the pill made life so much easier|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	You could have sex without condom as long as you go on the Pill. And take it regulary, but you and your partner can catch infections ANYTIME. So.. I think it's safe to use condoms too. They do super-thin ones now, he or you won't even be able to feel it. xx I went on pill for about 3 months and it resulted me putting on one stone in weight and l was really moody. It's not worth it for me, but you could try it out, to be on the safe side xx|`|KbK2TtFbaa	if you are married and have one kid and you want to keep gap beetwin child birth then pills are good otherwise condoms are fine.|`|ZMhlUeMJaa	Yeh, the pill is over 99% effective if taken correctly and you wouldn't need to use any other precautions whilst on it.  The best thing to do is book and appointment with your GP or local Family Planning Service and discuss it with them.  Most likely they will give you enough for 3 months and then ask you to come back to make sure you are happy with it.|`|vnfpNYezaa	I hated the pill. It made me put on weight and my labido went right down so I didnt want to do anything & my relationship nearly ended, these symptons are common for a lot of women. Personally I wouldnt advise it.|`|JU351q6Naa	if you dont want a child yes.|`|5DeUDFmgaa	Yes I definitely think you should go on the pill, but i would advise you use both the pill and condoms for precaution. Rather be safe than sorry.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	In terms of pregnancy risk it is in fact very much safer!    Condoms have a fail rate quoted as high as 15%, while the pill is 99.8% effective. It does of course have its own potential risks to your health, which are quite small statistically, but real nevertheless.    You would have to balance these against the big improvement in contraceptive efficacy.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	It's over 99% effective if taken as directed, so make sure you follow all the instructions. Yes, it's safe to rely on by itself - that's the point of it. Many women do it for years with no problems. However if you want that extra security then it's best to keep using condoms, some people double up on birth control methods. It really depends if you can take that small chance or not.    Harriet|`|hviykDAraa	its not 100% percent accurate, no contreception is!!!   You could always try it and use condoms as well so you are more protecteed, if its not right for you, you could always come off it and try a different method. I was on the pill for 6 years and it was great for me.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	The pill is safer than the condom! Pill is over 99% effective but condoms are only 97%. But if you're really worried and don't want to use condoms you could use spermicide as well as a precaution, not really necessary though.
0pX1oQAJaa	no.. see idk how to explain this, if you're exercising and burning more calories than you eat, you're going to lose weight, now the more you work out and less you eat, the more weight you'll lose, so if you eat the same amount you do now, but work out a tad less, then you'll lose weight a little slower, but without having to gain weight back first. ignore them, if you're reaching your target faster, all the power to you, and especially a healthy way.
xy0W50Lqaa	It took me 7 days.  I didn't eat at all and had no appetite.  Fell ill on a monday, thought i was better by thursday but was sick again after just a cupasoup!    It's important to drink plenty of fluids if you are able to.  I asked at a pharmacy for something to settle my stomach and they gave me some type of antacid so I was ok with fluids after that.  I hope you feel better soon

mWBD1Mgyaa	I believe what they told your sister, was that they were "precancerous" cells.  I have had this - twice.  She needs to have this taken care of right away - BEFORE they become cancerous.  Gyno's have seen this type of thing very often, so your sister will be taken care of well.  Just make sure she goes to all her appointments.  I first had a biopsy done to confirm the cell changes (which your sister may have already had).  I was then booked in for day surgery to remove them.  The difference between low grade and high grade, is how much of the cervix has been affected.  High grade indicates that most of her cervix will need to be treated.  My surgery consisted of them removing all the abnormal cells.  The procedure itself I was asleep for.  After I woke up, I had mild cramping...nothing worse then period cramps.  Unfortunately for me...I bleed after every time I had intercourse.  That went on for a year.  But that was only me...all people are different.  The main thing is that your sister gets this taken care of quickly!  Doctor's will not mess around with this!!  All will turn out fine.  Just tell her to go to all follow up appointments and stay safe!!|`|53xZQVSmaa	It is sad to know that your sister is dealing with this kind of situation. Actually i am not really familiar with this high grade cancer cells on her cervix but i know some experts who can help you.     It is better to talk to Skilling Institute experts about this matter. I am sure they will have answer about it. I hope you find my comment helpful. Thanks!|`|7eb3fd3226605d4f11ad285a2b5a5ab4aa	Are you sure the Dr didn't say high grade pre-cancerous cells?    "Squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) is another term that is used to describe abnormal changes in the cells on the surface of the cervix. The word squamous describes thin, flat cells that form the outer surface of the cervix. The word lesion refers to abnormal tissue. An intraepithelial lesion means that the abnormal cells are present only in the layer of cells on the surface of the cervix. A doctor may describe SIL as being low-grade (early changes in the size, shape, and number of cells) or high-grade (precancerous cells that look very different from normal cells)."    This just means that she has a high risk of developing cancer of the cervix.     She will proabably need a biopsy done to decide treatment.

If you busy every once in a while I can see a 10 hour night.|`|RJ4E6m97aa	Ten hours may be to much sleep and could leave you feeling sluggish and groggy. I suggest you sleep in hour and a half intervals, this way you complete full sleep cycles. So 4,5, or 6 full sleep cycles would be best. Meaning you would sleep for 6, 7.5, or 9 hours (10.5 if you really want a lot of sleep, but you still may feel groggy and sluggish). If you awake when you are in deep sleep it makes getting up that much harder. But if you awake in the beginning of the sleep cycle (first 30 minutes of each 1.5 hour sleep interval) you will feel freshed and ready for the day. Typically I will try to get to sleep seven hours and forty five minutes before I need to be awake. This allows me 15 minutes to fall asleep. Hope this helped.|`|EPM8n6qbaa	verrrry normal!|`|RjSHyjzPaa	If ur not a child 8hrs sleep is enough,but u can hve a nap  for the remaining 2 hrs,|`|UwaNcO6Jaa	It is very normal.

Chronic dehydration is the primary cause of asthma and allergies in the human body.Strict attention to adequate water intake daily with addition of salt should be a preventive measure.   .Please try to read the letter from Andrew Bauman written on November 13, 1998 on pages 77 to 84 in his book cited above. And also  the note  on page 85, " Why is my doctor not aware of the information on water and asthma?"  People with asthma and allergies  should make it a habit to drink water before eating their food- atleast a few minutes before beginning. At no time  should they allow food intake to concentrate their body fluids to the extent that high levels of histamine generation become a permanent situation.On no account should you abruptly cut off the use of your medications. You should begin by taking more water with your medications until your need for medication decreases. keep the doctor in charge of your treatment informed. you will be able to work with your doctor to gradually reduce the use of the normally prescribed inhalant or antihistamine medications until you no longer need them. Dr. Batman---- recommends to asthmatics who are about to get an attack or are in the middle of  an asthma attack, to drink water two or three glasses of water and then put a pinch of salt on their tongue. When the salt reaches the lungs, salt pumps secrete it in the bronchioles to loosen the mucus plugs and prepare them to be carried away- only when water is available. Too much salt and not enough water may do the opposite. It  might  cause constriction of the bronchioles.  Let God bless you all the members of your family.

jfQdypeMaa	It sounds to me like you are just experiencing some of the effects of the virus that your body has been successfully working at recovering from.  you have had the congestion in the throat and nose, and it sounds to me like your body is in the process of clearing up all of that excess fulid.  I have a strong hunch you are going to be back to normal again in the next day or two.    My advice would be to make sure you are getting the rest your body needs.  Are you drinking plenty of water?  That is so helpful to your body's recovery.  Also, force yourself to eat some fresh fruits and vegetables!  (Now I'm sounding like I'm nagging!)  We get so busy with our high-tech, high-pace lives, and sometimes we forget to give our bodies the basic things that help it to stay healthy.  These basics not only help us to recover more quickly, but they also help us to stay healthy once we have recovered.    I am a chiropractor in the Minneapolis area (Edina, Minnesota).  My approach to health care is often based on the common sense facts.  The human body is an amazing machine that has incredible ability to recover and heal itself.  It just needs to be tended to properly.    I hope that I have helped in some way.    Here's to your health!   Dr. P.

You might want your dentist to do a oral cancer screening as well just as a precaution. If your dentist does not do that just call your insurance provider and ask them to find you one. Good luck!
fwnlY9viaa	It's absolutely true.    Weight training does assit in speeding up your metabolism. Buy building lean muscle mass, you are increasing the amount of time you can burn energy at a high level.    After a work out, your body can still continue to burn energy at a higher level then at rest for up to 48 hours.|`|219329c2d061de50a947e339dc81b386aa	Nope, because weight training focuses and isolates the area you're training and won't affect other areas of your body much. You will gain muscle in some areas rather than lose fat.    If you want to increase metabolism, i heard that drinking green tea can help with that. If you need to burn more fat during cardio sessions, try getting some L-Carnitine which helps to utilize stored fats for energy. Should be found at any health stores that sell gym supplements. Do some research if you're not sure.|`|15EMST1Paa	Exercise is just as vital as calorie intake when it comes to losing weight, but the one thing which really delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials in stock, it was featured in Reader's Digest and CNN. I shed twenty pounds, it really does produce results!|`|fKzZToPAaa	weight training is definitely better for losing wight, getting trim or bulking up.     The reason why weight training increases your metabolism is that when you weight train you increase your muscle mass which in turn means that your muscle and body needs more fuel to maintain itself so your body speeds up and therefore your metabolism will speed up. you will also get more hungry but thats all good as long as you eat right.     if your trying to lose weight or trim up you should be doing more weights that you can push reasonably and do around 10 to 12 reps if you are trying to build mass then you will need to do lower reps around 6-8 and try to push as much as you can and have someone spot you.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Yes its absolutely true.|`|VzVzncfXaa	For many people trying to speed up their metabolism the first thing they think to try is an aerobic or cardio exercise program. The problem is that most people focus on this method but miss another piece of the puzzle when it comes to speeding up their metabolism; weight training. Yep, that's right, good old fashioned weight lifting is a great way to boost metabolism.    What is it about resistance training that encourages your body to speed up its metabolism? The reason is simple. Lean muscle mass requires calories to maintain itself so the more muscle you have the higher your metabolism. By simply adding five pounds of lean muscle mass with weight training the body will require more calories to keep that muscle which means a higher basal (normal) metabolism. We get these additional calories to maintain more muscle from two sources. The first source of calories is the food we eat, the second is the body's fat stores. Simply put the more lean muscle mass one possesses the more calories they will burn, even while resting. This helps explain why fitness models look the way they do. Because of their abundance of lean muscle mass their bodies are calorie burning machines.    When you lift weights you are not actually building muscle, you are breaking it down. It's what happens after the workout that causes the metabolism to speed up. After the muscle is broken down the body compensates by building more muscle to try and keep the muscle from breaking down again. It takes a large amount of energy from calories to rebuild new and bigger muscles. So lifting weights burns calories and speeds up metabolism not only during the weight lifting workout but also while the body builds bigger and stronger muscles.    A weight lifting routine must be done correctly and at regular intervals if one is to get the maximum effect. Going to the gym once a week will not bring the kind of results talked about. It will take some time and dedication to build new muscle mass but the end result will be worth it with a better body and a speed up in metabolism.|`|oog7eBnHaa	No, that's false.  Weight training is an action that will strengthen the muscles of a certain area inwhich you are training.  Your metabolisim is based on a hormone distrubuted by your body.  The only way to boost your metablolisim naturally is to eat 6 small meals per day and exersice each day in small incriments.|`|WCxzJMnvaa	It's true as long as you are doing cardio as well.|`|9lZdDU2Vaa	Walk or jog for 5 to 6 kms every day to increase your metabolism|`|u0udwkZQaa	Yes, I wish more women would do it and not fear being huge muscular beasts which won't happen because it's much harder for them than men as they have little testosterone. Weight training is the best way because you will make your body burn more even when it sleeps and you will shape yourself, not just shrink yourself from a pear or apple to a smaller pear or apple. You want to start off light and only 3 times a week or so because you're at beginner level for now. You should join a website forum for fitness/bodybuilding/strength/powerlifti... they have women sections these days and are not all about muscle bound steroid freaks but people that are into weight training and have done it for years as a lifestyle choice. They will have routines, answers and advice for folks of all ages, and levels of training&goals. Get it from the horse's mouth, that's what I did and now I help others and have never looked back.      Quote"Nope, because weight training focuses and isolates the area you're training and won't affect other areas of your body much. You will gain muscle in some areas rather than lose fat."      Not true. Weight training only isolates if you use isolation machines instead of compound free weights exercises. The point being made is that building muscle will increase metabolism which will then lead to burning more fat. You also, cannot spot reduce fat, it happens over the whole body.|`|gshA2LYOaa	Yes, it is.  It depends on your natural body type as to what type of weight training you do for maximum benefit. Weight training builds muscle (mass or lean, depending on what you do) and the more muscle you have as opposed to fat, the better your metabolic rate will be.    Cardio is also good  Drinking lots of water is good  Eating the right food at the right intervals throughout the day is good    They can all raise your metabolism|`|MXzzUDbRaa	Yes .Its true
wIYcWKwNaa	Sure   You could definitely give it a try   also with the metabolism it would know what   kind of calorie intake to expect so it would always  be in full swing waiting for the next load of calories   so yea i would give it thumbs up   also thumbs up for inventing it   Nice     HTH  Good Luck  Tay|`|hWvWXzPvaa	first of all, how old are you? because 1400 calories isn't exactly "restricting"...

Diagnosis is clinical; laboratory and imaging tests are used to identify treatable causes. Treatment is supportive. Cholinesterase inhibitors can sometimes temporarily improve cognitive function.  Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a leading cause of degenerative dementia in elderly adults. This condition is linked to abnormal protein structures in certain areas of the brain. The structures and symptoms of DLB are associated with Alzheimer's disease, but it is uncertain whether DLB is a sub-type of Alzheimer's or separate disease. There is no cure for DLB or Alzheimer's.  Alzheimer's disease causes progressive cognitive deterioration and is characterized by senile plaques, -amyloid deposits, and neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex and subcortical gray matter.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	http://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_10...|`|FuDHZPpNaa	No only on tuesdays i think|`|Jet2E58aaa	I'd tell you but I have forgotten.

PrS7So5Yaa	Here's a little formula for figuring out how much protein you need.    (Your Weight) divided by (2.2) = (your weight in kg)    (your weight in kg) times (.8 to 1.8) = (grams of protein daily)    * use .8 if you're not very active, 1.8 if you're very active, or a number in between based on your activity level.      So for example, my weight...    139 / 2.2 = 63.18    63.18 x 1.5 (quite active but not the most) = 94.7 grams|`|321517b8db292e8ce3489dc477fc7fb2aa	4-6 grams per kilogram of body weight would be plenty|`|3LAzaUhiaa	I am around 200lbs and  was having around 300-400 grams that is way too much i have dropped it down to around 200-250grams and i am achieving the same results!http://www.australia-bodybuilding.com/ap...

In actual fact, we absolutely do not need protein from meat and it do more harm than any good. A typical meat-eating diet often relies on protein for 30% of its calories. Our body cannot store excess protein. Excessive protein has been linked to many health problems such as osteoporosis and kidney problems. Protein from plant source which is plentiful in soya products, nuts seeds and whole grains is sufficient. In reality, it is near impossible to be deficient in protein.
jfQdypeMaa	I wish I could discuss this with you.  My questions would be few, but they might help us to track down the problem.  - Do you drink a lot of caffeine beverages?  - Are you dealing with a lot of changes or other issues in life?  - Are you getting enough exercise and are you eating properly?  - Are you under a lot of stress, have a lot of extra concerns?  - What age group are you a part of?  - How long has this been going on?  Does it happen often?    It sounds to me like this has become sort of a pattern.  Sometimes we can find ourselves falling into strange or different patterns.  If you don't have any pain or other symptoms that mean that you should seek help from a medical professional, then maybe you just need to steer yourself back onto the proper track.  If you find that you are tired by 9:00 PM, force yourself to get out of the house and get some increased activity and exercise.  Make sure you are avoiding caffeine after 2:00 PM, and pay close attention to drinking a lot of water and having good nutrition. (Now I'm nagging!)  Force yourself to stay awake a bit later, and try to avoid letting yourself sleep so late and during odd hours.  Your body can be retrained to get itself back on track.    If you are undergoing a lot of changes, have been under a lot of stress, etc... this could possibly be the result of all of that.  All the more reason to listen to your body's needs and tend to them.  Regardless of when you get your rest, make sure that your body gets it or you will soon find yourself bogged down with a virus or some other type of illness.    I am a chiropractor in the Minneapolis area, and my approach to health is often based on the more common sense basics.  Our bodies are incredible machines.  But they must be tended to and taken care of.  I hope that I have helped in some way.    Here's to your health!

vukRiS1Eaa	First off, congratulations for being brave enough to ask about this. It's easy to get embarrassed and then not find out what you need to know!    As for ways to do it, you have several options:    1. Fingers. They're the old standby, and they work. Focus on your clit--experiment with different speeds and pressures. Start by rubbing lying on your back, and then try lying on your stomach and grinding your hips to rub against your fingers. Experiment, and know this is how most women try it for the first time!    2. Showerhead/bath faucet. A favorite of many girls. If you have a detachable showerhead, simply adjust the water temperature, lie down in the tub, point it at your clit, and enjoy! Note that the lying down part is important, especially if you're new to this--don't want to slip!    3. Vibrator. No, you can't go out and buy one at your age from a sex shop. However, take a look at those "Face massagers" and "Back massagers" at Wal-Mart--believe me, they will do the trick. Again, focus on your clit (are you catching the theme here?).

An in order to do a research the real effects of the drug you would need to use the same dose. Buying it just anywhere would defeat that purpose, as you would not have any idea of the drugs chemical composition or purity of the steriods. If you are talking Andogen, i have used it under a doctors care since mid 80's, i have used patches that require you to shave your scrotum where the patch was applied, i have used injections every two weeks, i have used a gel you rub on, i have use a cream you rub on, and i now use a patch you can apply to the upper arm, upper leg, or around the belly area. Since i had both testicles removed, and most of the scrotum sac removed and the penis reattached after an accident in 84. I will tell you my dose was 200 mil every 2 weeks by injection which i gave myself. The needle is very large as the serum is very thick. it leaves a sore area on the but by the hip with bruising. The patch now leaves itch dry scally red area's the size of a silver dollar and must be applied every night in my case at the same time. It does however keep the amount of hormone in the system a more constant level. The patch is 5mls everyday. The effects are this: high blood pressure, thickening and darkening of the skin, weight gain where i had to have gastric-by-pass to lose 165lbs, uncontrolled anger, a fullness of the face, acne out breaks on the butt and face, joint problems, tumor's i've had removed from the groin, chest,arms legs and butt, all except the cancerous one that has now formed on the spinal cord in lower back, loss of bodys pubic hair, chest hair, underarm hair, and head, although my pubic and body hair has returned but not like it use to be, my head hair is still thinning because of it's conversion to dyhydrotestosterone. Skin tabs which i've had some removed but they return with more, mood swings, uncontrolable hunger before my stomach operation, water retention, and before i lost both testicles it caused shrinkage of the testicle's with mine turning hard which they thought cancerous, so they removed them after they tried to save them. Yes there would be a legal problem i have no doubt. The patch is Andoderm 5ml and the shot was Depo-Testosterone 200mg 10ml. Hope this is helpful son. Good luck!

Since this has been happening your whole life you probably had it passed down from a parent, and you can go to the doctors. One of my old friends had this problem and she went to the doctors and they had these special pills she took once a night and it prevented her from this happening.  It could be psychological (like being stressed at night or sleeping in a stressful atmosphere) and then you should see a psychologist. until then, you can continue wearing huggies. They also have alarms that wake you up at any sign of wetness (although they are expensive). You could also have a parent wake you up at like midnight or 2, and even though you might be tired it will train you to wake up if you have to go.  Don't drink 2 hours before bedtime and don't eat a lot of sugar b/c that irritates it and it is just as bad as drinking anything.  good luck. Hope it stops soon.|`|SjYbkWdQaa	maybe its psycological....do you have any stress??? also it can be a bladder problem?? you need to seek medical attention either way.

Stick to eggs for breakfast. Mix in some veggies for an omelet.    If you really can't break the cereal habit, opt for oat meal (not the flavored kind with lots of sugar), or eat Kashi cereals. They've got fiber and protein at least.

IKakoOfyaa	You need to see a medical doctor, get an exam and perhaps some x-rays.  Pain is an abnormal symptom that needs investigation.  Nothing against chiros...I've had successful chiropractic treatment myself, but they are limited on what they can do.  When a treatment leads to increased pain or referred pain, it's time for medical intervention.|`|5dfde4242efae0bef67fb9df5b76b4bdaa	I'm sorry to tell you this, but this tells me the session with the chiropractor wasn't successful.  If you want to go to another chiropractor, I'd really ask around to find a reliable one---even better,  go to an orthopedic before returning to this chiropractor.  I've had positive and negative experiences with chiropractors.  I walked into  a chiropractor's office due to back pain and had to be carried out after the session.  But...a few years later again for lower back pain I went to one highly recommended and really improved in time---and I never had more pain or different pain than what I came in with.  I was always better after each visit.  Not all chiropractors are the same.|`|5ZmwpI5Qaa	It would be best to first see your doctor or an orthopedic specialist. I would advise that your do everything you can to avoid chiropractic treatment, as it will often do more harm than good.    Chiropractors have to believe that everything causes conditions that only they can fix so they can convince patients that we can't live comfortably without visits twice per week.    I had a stroke last year as a result of chiropractic treatment and have since made it a priority to raise awareness of the dangers of chiropractic care. I ask that anyone going to visit a chiropractor to be aware of the risks and make an informed decision about treatment.
oSA9Wsv1aa	If it's your lower back then it might be a couple of things. Start b stretching your hamstrings. Without bending your knees go down as far as you can and hold it for a 10 count. Next do crunches your Ab's are week. Not sit ups, crunches. Stronger Ab's will strengthen your back. If its your upper back stretch it, and exercises light. If this persists or your in a god amount of pain see Doctor.|`|cr2KKT6Naa	your right your a teenager. but  herinated disc. dont have a  age limit. like death dont either. you may need a mri. you might of slip a disc. are you going to a  chiropactor. if you are stop he might of over done it.  are you wrestling. you might of twisted it.
60c1c3cd65f0c9deb7c8cdbb1a06ba1baa	The last thing you want to do is make your foot worse by putting weight on it or doing activities that'll aggravate it. I supposedly got a "mild sprain" of my foot last July playing volleyball. I took 2 weeks off for rest and returned to the court; however, my foot hadn't healed by then. But I trusted what my coach and doctor said, so 2 weeks should've done it. Anywho, it didn't, and playing competitive volleyball on it for the following four months didn't help it at all. By that time, I had seen three doctors, the last one who finally referred me to a podiatrist. I went to the podiatrist the following week, and it turns out that my ligaments were still way too stretched out. I was put in a walking boot and crutches for a month.     I would strongly advise you to get a doctor's opinion in this. A grade 3 sprain usually means you tore ligaments. If you have crutches, use them. Keep it wrapped up in an ace bandage. When you're sitting or lying around, ice in 15 minute intervals (if you leave ice on any longer 20 minutes at a time, it'll make the swelling go up). When you're in bed, take a couple of pillows and prop your foot up. In a week or so, if you can, try making small movements with your foot. Point your toes up and down, or try spelling out the alphabet. Once you injure a ligament, especially those of which are in the foot and ankle, it's really hard to get it back to 100%. After the swelling goes down and most of the pain goes away, I'd recommend going to PT to regain mobility and strengthen your foot. Because your foot will be weaker than before, it's easier to reinjure it so you have to take extra precautions to make sure it won't happen again. Good luck!|`|C0sT0PPyaa	Ok you prob don't have a serve sprain, just a normal sprain.  A sprain hurts and you can't walk on it, its gross colors (after a few days it gets worse) and its swollen.  You'll only be off it for weeks, maybe days.  Most of the time you are encourage to walk on it if you can handle it, provide you won't re injure it by tripping or hitting the cat or something.  its good to wrap it up with a tensor bandage for this reason (compression too is part of r.i.c.e.).  ice is the best and elevation is good.  sleep with a rolled up blanket at the end of your bed if you can, but if not don't worry about it.  usually something like that will help your back (but lying in bed alot won't).  sit on the computer, just put one leg on the desk for a bit when you can.  these things come at bad times there just challenges no big deal.      AND DON'T EXERCISE IT.....you don't exercise injuries that makes them worse (imagine someone massaging and moving around a broken bone.  As a week or two goes by you can start to move it in circles but don't worry it will heal well it just takes time.    YOULL BE ON YOUR FEET IN DAYS IM SURE OF IT.  2 months to heal is for the injury not the time it takes to walk.    note: when you healed your ligaments will be tight in your foot, many people re injure because the don't spend time with flexabilty in the ankle.  you have to stretch it everyway with your hand and with your weight on the ground...use your good ankle as your guide|`|hVDchwOlaa	If you still can't put weight on it after 5 days then something is really wrong. You need to see a doctor and he should order x-rays to make sure you didn't actually break anything. My daughter had a bad sprain a few months ago. She had to wear a 'boot' in order for it to heal properly.
TKNPveHDaa	All fat budges when you run.  You keep on working, it'll all go down.  There is no spot training.|`|VzVzncfXaa	1. Get rid of arm fat    With the jump rope in your hands begin skipping, hopping just enough to allow the rope to swing under your feet. Pick up the rhythm then slowly extend your arms away from your sides as far as possible. If done correctly you should be forming big circles. Continue this for 60 seconds.    Either if your at home or the gym, find a place to do some dips. Sit on the floor with your feet held together. Bend your knees with your feet flat on the floor. Put your hands about 12 inches behind your butt about shoulder length apart with your fingers pointed toward your butt. Your body should be in a raised position, youll want it lowered until your butt is just above the floor. Straighten one arm then the other, repeat. Another way to do dips is to do it the way it is in the picture. Find a chair or a bench. Then, do the same exercise going back up and down using your triceps muscle.    Dumbbell kickbacks are very helpful. Get some dumbbells that are light. Not too heavy or you'll start building muscle. Keep in mind that your goal is to get rid of the flab, not cause excessive strain which can cause damage. These are good standing exercises. Bend over slightly and place one arm on your knee. Hold the dumbbell with your free hand to the side of your hip, just below your upper thigh. Bend, your elbow toward your body. Slowly raise your arm behind you in an upward motion. This straightens your elbows as your arm raises. Once completely straight, tense your arm, hold, then relax. Repeat.    2. Fat on your thighs    Cease all of your aerobic exercises (jogging, treadmills, ellipticals, tennis, cycling, swimming, ... anything where you could continue to talk comfortably while exercising)    Begin doing anaerobic exercises (weight lifting, sprinting, etc.)    Train your thighs & butt by doing the following sprint drills    Run at top speed for 15 seconds  Walk (recover) for 30 seconds  Repeat 10 times    Repeat up to 3 times a week, with a minimum of 1 day of rest in between workout.     Make an effort to include protein in every meal.    3. Flatten your stomach    Make up your mind to exercise daily. You must be consistent in order to achieve results. Determination is what will help you to succeed at flattening your stomach.     Stand up straight with your legs together.     Lift your left leg upward and cross it over to the right as you are lifting your leg. Do this 10 to 20 times and then return your leg back to its original position.     Lift your right leg upward and cross it over to the left as you are lifting your leg. Do this 10 to 20 times and then return your leg back to its original position.     Repeat the exercise 3 times for each leg daily. Remember consistency and determination is essential to accomplishing results.|`|hWvWXzPvaa	um, exercise...  google stuff  home work out routines  you know  that sort of stuff|`|CqAD7dXCaa	if i am honest don't eat as much|`|E2IaiCpyaa	keep up the exercise, you will see results.

bZTpK9uVaa	If you want to learn more, feel free to message me. I will try to keep this short and clear.    A person burns thousands of calories every day from daily activity such as ex) washing dishes, brushing teeth, walk, lifting up ur spoon, etc, u get the idea.    And dont drink juice or sodas. Green tea is good choice though.    I dont know how much you eat, but my advice is. Eat a lot in the morning, eat enough at lunch, and eat the least at dinner. Do not eat after 9pm.    If you are hungry, and you really have to eat. I would choose carrots and broccoli, as they have low calories and almost no fat. However, do not use any dipping sauce. They are actually a fairly delicious snack even without it.    And losing 60-70lbs will not be easy. I will tell you that.   Do a lot of cardio and stairclimber. Do not try to Lift weights or whatsoever, Keep it light, and do more repeptitions.    And the best advice I can give you is, do not think too much. Meaning, dont weigh yourself everyday, because it can either really motivate you or make you feel depressed.     Try to keep your calorie intake low.  Try to eat food that has low fat, sugar.  Stay away from junk food.  No eating after 9pm  Do not drink soda, liquor, pop in general.  Drink lot of green tea.    If you have any questions, just message me.

You better keep a check on this on the first instance. make a slight change in your routine. You can eat your fill in the mornings but reduce a bit in the afternoons and become a pure vegetarian in the night. Eat only Salad during night. You can include salad cucumber, carrots, sprout pulses in the diet for supper. A few Yoga asanas along with this diet scheduling along with no snacking in between can reduce your weight to the desired level. slow walk in the garden in early morning hours can help to keep your energy levels high.|`|WCxzJMnvaa	First of all, never lose weight for any reason besides your health.

Sincle you are only 16, there's one natural method that you can try and that is, take Seven Seas Cod Liver Oil capsules for about  2 or 3 months. Dosage is according to what is recommended on the packaging. Cod Liver Oil aids bone growth in young people.    Cod Liver Oil is a food supplement and not a medicine. Take this only if you are NOT allergic to fish and fish products.

Basketball players are mostly tall because they recruit tall people on their teams (there are some normal - short height players). I'm not sure about skipping but it does make for a good cardio workout. Sleeping makes you taller temporarily - when you lie down, your spine relaxes and gets longer, making you fractionally taller. When you stand up your spine compresses. You lose the height you gain when you get up in the morning.    The only way to gain height is to hope that nature wants you to be tall, be genetically modified. You could drink more milk for the calcium which will give you healthier and stronger bones.|`|YbxmNKVPaa	buy some growth hormones from the shifty huge guy at your gym and do a proper growth hormone cycle. id be extra careful if i were you though, since youre still growing|`|TPXlAxe2aa	You cant...its natural everyone grows till the age of 21  Only your genes can say if you can grow further|`|hWvWXzPvaa	wait... is this a serious question?  be PATIENT and you might grow some more...

RbAbzg16aa	mate the only way a psych can administer a medication to you without your consent is if he either scheduals you or seeks a community treatment order.He has the legal right to schedual you if he decides you are a danger to yourself or to others or are in danger of dissrepute. you will know when you are schedualed because the police will turn up on your doorstep at a time you least expect and drag you off to the psyc ward. alternativly he can get a community trearment order which in laymans terms means that you are under a majistrates order to take the meds.... and if you don't the police can turn up and drag you off to the psyc ward, where they hold you down and give you the meds... if you wake up swinging ...they tie you up and give you the meds... at this stage you are so smashed on meds you niether know or care what they are giving you. as far as the psyc injecting you without you knowing... mate take it from me, you'll feel it if they do inject you. most of the crap they pump into you has quite a nasty sting and because it is a slow releasing medication it has to go in deep... with a big needle so no. if he were injecting you you would know. dude if your smok'n pot... now would be the time to lay off for a while... just make sure you ween yourself off.don't  act freaky around the psyc and try to balance out your life a bit. once you've been commited to a ward life tends to take on some unpleasent aspects. If you can get back to some sort of normal level of emotional stability and behavioral petterns without the use of pharmasutical drugs this would be prefferable than the alternative of psyc drugs etc|`|7jxbpo0Qaa	They can't LEGALLY unless it is court ordered and usually u r hospitalized due to severity.  Most SSRI that I know of are given in a pill but anti psychotic can be injected..as u stated.  but no dr. that wants to remain a dr. would do that unless he thought the patient could not rat them out.  (does not sound irrational if this is a real fear but make sure u talk to ur therapist about this...might not be a good idea to see a psychiatrist that is married to ur therapist)|`|XPO11i9Yaa	NO!!! no doctor can medicate a patient without the patient or their power of attorney knowing what the drug is and what it is suppose to do that is illegal.. they can not administer the drug without your permission|`|VhTD7npRaa	no they can't|`|WkcPWmR9aa	We have what we called "patient's bills of right", any doctors cannot administer drugs or any medical interventions without the client's consent.|`|321517b8db292e8ce3489dc477fc7fb2aa	They can do whatever they want to.

Rk46lIBwaa	I am afraid it is not a question of age, simply naivety. The whole concept of detox is an urban myth.    It grew up from constipated Edwardians, who refused to eat vegetables as they considered them lower class. Instead they used purgatives and enemas.    Most of us are now more enlightened and simple eat a high fibre diet and at least 5 a day fruit/vegetable units.
AA11614449	Rubella is a virus and is a bad thing for you baby if you have the rubella virus.  Rubella IgG means that you have antibodies to fight against rubella already in your body.  The igG also means antibody.  You were probably given a vaccination sometime in your life and that's why you have antibodies.    You were tested because it's part of the testing that's done on pregnant women to make sure that their baby isn't at risk for congenital rubella syndrome.      Don't worry it's not a bad thing|`|SI02JOQ4aa	I reckon this is good news.I think it shows you have immunity from German Measels|`|jRqXZV6Oaa	Antibodies are what is made by certain immune cells to fight off an infection.  IgG is an antibody in the bloodstream.  There is also IgM (blood), IgE (mucous membranes).      If you have antibodies to something, it means you have either been exposed to that infection, or have been vaccinated for it.     Rubella is also called German Measles and is a virus.  If you have it during pregnancy, it can cause stillbirth, miscarriage or birth defects.    Having a positive test for antibodies means you are immune to it and will not contract it during your pregnancy, so you will not have to worry about the birthe defects, etc.|`|0KFNOa5haa	My wife who was born with rubella syndrome says this is likely to be good news as this indicates a previous exposure to,or vaccination against rubella. German measles is only dangerous to a pregnant woman in the first three months of pregnancy so as long as you werent exposed  or contracted it during this period everything should be fine.|`|cnnu1IFtaa	It's good - it means you are already rubella (German measles) immune, which is particularly important in pregnancy, because if you were to catch it while pregnant it could cause significant problems for the baby.
6NZeItMAaa	To change your outside you need to change your inside. No matter what you use to stop smoking it's your will that makes the difference.    You need to find the strengh within yourself to do that. Exercising and a proprer diet with plenty of fruits and veggies could help but the will it's what makes the difference.    Now you have a lack of self esteem because your girlfriend left you but it will come back and you'll see that there plenty of girls out there that are not her. all you need is to go towards them.    Some herbal remedies and yoga techniques could help you to recover your well being for a new start.|`|IM1bLPf6aa	I quit smoking 12 months ago using these tablets called "champix" (thats what they are called in Australia anyway).

5179a1324042a48534d847e9c5593c69aa	if you wanna get fat, like a sumo wrestler, do what everyone says and eat carbs. lots of pasta or rice or bread will do the job.     if your looking for a more healthy weight gain, and trying to build muscle, youll have to exercise as well as eat.   Try eating more(simple huh?)   Try eating more protein(meat, fish etc. protein powder is great if you really work-out hard, till your sore)  Try eating healthy, eat healthy fats and proteins(no bacon. or meat cuts with white fat on them)   To get a healthy amount of fat eat avocado's and nuts, almonds are good.  Cheese is great, low carbs, high protein, high fat.   Some carbs is good, but try to keep it to a minimum, unless you start feeling tired and wasted, in which case eat more carbs. Your body can use the protein that isnt taken up to repair muscle and use to give you energy.     Exercise.   Do 100m sprints, these shock your thigh muscles to grow.   Do squats, try 10 x 4 sets at first then move up.   Lift weight, try lifting dumbells, in bicep curls, 6-12 times, do weights with which you can only do that many. doing 6-12 causes your arms to hypertrophy and bulk up, you may become big and heavy and look strong, but you wont really be all the tough.   Do benchpresses, 4 times is good, with a heavy weight.   If you dont have a big slouching belly, do sit-ups. these cause your abs to strengthen and makes you gain muscle weight in the stomach.|`|ALvp7YRuaa	hmm eat all yu want....and try not to work out...and why are yu trying to gain???|`|cWuumdy7aa	you need to join a gym and do some excercises for gaining weight and also follow diet prescribed by them.

FicyC2TXaa	No, not true - complete rubbish in fact.    Johanna Budwig recommends a diet largely comprising flax seeds and cottage cheese, and claims this cures cancer.    Her supporters make much of the fact that she has been nominated six  times for a Nobel Prize for her work in this area, as the website you mention clearly does too; this means nothing of course, anyone can get nominated - my friend could nominate me for this answer. Budwig never won a Nobel prize.    There is no scientific evidence that any food, including cottage cheese, can affect the progress of cancer in any way.    People like Johanna Budwig make wild and unproven claims and exploit the desperation of vulnerable people.    Yes, there are unsubstantiated testimonials on the internet; but you have no way of knowing if the person ever had cancer, much less that they have been cured. The plural of anecdote is not data.    Anyone who follows Johanna Budwig's recommendations will be investing money, hope and, most dangerous of all, time they can ill-afford on something that is not effective, as well consuming quantities of not very enjoyable food|`|oog7eBnHaa	Poor nutrietan can cause the body to breakdown and not be able to function properly, however, no replacing them will not cure cancer.  Besides that cancer is a general term, there are several forms of cancer that attack different parts of the human body.  Each cancer is unique to that area.  A general nutrian isn't going to cure cancer.|`|7eb3fd3226605d4f11ad285a2b5a5ab4aa	I find it interesting that when doing a search for Dr Budwig on the internet, I only come up with sites that are selling the products she recommended.  Not a single site from an institute that is considered reputable or at the forefront of cancer research or treatment showed up.  No scientific research papers showed up.  Also surprising that if her research showed so much promise, no-one has bothered continuing it after her death.    Lots of quacks peddling snake oil out there!|`|16e730ba39930a9906b368149bb74bbfaa	Cancer is more a complex animal than just a "fungus," "lack of nutrients," "backed up energy," "misplaced fetal cells," or any other hare-brained explanation put out by these snake oil peddlers to scam terrified people out of their money.    I'd stick with medical practitioners who know their art and have years of training and experience to guide them.|`|aCDWwsisaa	It's nonsense.  Budwig was either a lunatic, or a heartless fiend who wanted to get rich exploiting sick people.    The "root" of her treatments was for people to eat lots of flaxseed (also known as "linseed").  There are countries in the Middle East where flaxseed has been a staple in the diet for thousands of years...yet cancer rates in those countries are RISING, not falling.    If I filled out the right paperwork, I could have YOU nominated for a nobel six times, too!  If you don't win it, it proves nothing...

K7x1RHVFaa	Start by talking to the dietitian that prepares their food to check for allergies and whether you can use sugar or not and if you need pre-made portions  like cupcakes or not and if color is an issue. Basically, you may end up fixing something special for everyone but that is better than upsetting anyone. Ask about utensils and plates and cups and I am sure this will all be explained to you what you can and can not do.     Good Luck.|`|BLD9EEWNaa	Just be careful about each person's specific problems.  For instance, someone with social anxiety or schizophrenia does not want to be surrounded by a lot of people- they will NOT appreciate a crowd.  A surprise birthday party with any people would be a nightmare for me.  If they hate enclosed spaces, have the party in a large room.  And in general, it should be low key.  (Unless they're a sociopath, in which case, maybe more excitement would be appreciated)

AA12266052	You have got Stage 3 Hypertension.  When the kidney arteries become narrow, less blood flows to the kidneys. The kidneys mistakenly respond as if your blood pressure is low and give off hormones that tell the body to retain salt and water. This causes your blood pressure to rise.  Many different diseases can cause narrowing of the renal arteries. Hardening of the arteries from high cholesterol is one of the most common. Most patients have the typical risk factors for atherosclerosis, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.  Fibromuscular dysplasia is another cause, particularly in women under age 50.  Consult a Nephrologist.|`|Zgs4RncIaa	If you are taking your blood pressure in a store, you really can't trust these machines. They are not calibrated.    If you are taking your blood pressure at home, make sure you are sitting straight up with your feet flat on the floor (do not cross your legs). Blood pressure taken in the right arm will be higher than your left arm.    You should seriously consider going to your Physician for the high blood pressure, normal blood pressure is 120/80. You may need to be placed on medications for hypertension.    Other symptoms which warrant ER visit, chest pains, headache, nausea, back pain, etc.|`|4AbXxowTaa	That's sky high!  You should go see a doctor so they can put you on some strong drugs to lower that asap.  That's dangerously high, you should probably be more like 135/70|`|2qPtGTNcaa	This is very high. Normal blood pressure should be 110/70. The old target was 120/70 or even 120/80 but medical authorities have lowered that. You should avoid foods that raise blood pressure (salty foods) and eat foods that lower blood pressure (those high in potassium).|`|a893b2d2332387b71e69d418087c9c7eaa	That's very bad.

Uhm, that is insanely high blood pressure, are you sure you read it properly? If so I'd go to the hospital immediately!|`|piC6bG1baa	You're blood is rising up high. The diastolic pressure (which is the denominator) is above normal range of 90. Avoid eating foods that are rich in salts (sodium) because it can trigger your kidney mush worst than before. It is also responsible for the fast arising of your Blood Pressure.|`|63qTRNMdaa	According to the American Heart Association blood pressure should ideally be 120/80 or less. A reading over 120/80 up to 139/89 (which is what you were originally asking about) is considered prehypertension, and above this level (140/90 or higher) is considered high (hypertension).     Your blood pressure reading of 170/110 is something you should be concerned about.    As you already have kidney problems you need to take this very seriously. High blood pressure, left untreated, can lead to hardening and thickening of arteries, heart attack due to blocked arteries, weakening and enlarging of the heart, stroke, and damage to, or failure of, the kidneys.    You may be able to lower your blood pressure somewhat through lifestyle - increase your exercise, lose weight and quit smoking (if you are overweight or smoke), reduce your stress, and limit your salt intake. More than likely you will also require some blood pressure medication to bring your pressure down.    Don't put it off -  make an appointment to see your doctor right away.    Take care.
7CXVSa23aa	it's never too late to strive for being fit and healthy. i've seen lots of success stories about overweight women who are mostly in their 40's that are still able to lose weight and keep it off for good.    well, i think the only proven ways to lose weight, besides proper diet and regular exercise are:    1. enough inspiration and determination to really be fit and healthy;  2. discipline to stick with your diet and exercise program; and  3. lots of patience because the results of your hard work are not immediately visible.    of course there would be results, like dropping a pound or your jeans would feel looser, but it would really take time and a lot of effort.    don't worry. when you've achieved your goal weight, the feeling of accomplishment and your new-found confidence would be sooo worth it.    good luck. :D      -gg-|`|GzlckRcnaa	oh of course yes,you just need to be discipline with your diet n food intake.it's never too late.i'm sure with the right diet,exercises, n attitude you could change yourself to a hot&sexy girl.also don forget,you must have a real determination or else it won't give you the result that you want.Good Luck ok!|`|qicRLHMLaa	Exercise and eating right will get you what you need to be healthy.|`|e9ARhomFaa	First and foremost: It is never too late to lose weight and have a smoking HOT body.

Good Luck!! and stay true to urself.  Much Love|`|E2IaiCpyaa	It's never too late honey, get up and exercise and feel good about you.

Yes,it's hard but,you'll make it.Just make sure you're doing it for yourself and no one else.If you do it for yourself,you'll be much more happy with the results,than if you do it for someone else! Much love and good luck!|`|PrS7So5Yaa	Nope, it's not too late at all. I was 25 before I decided to get fit and it still worked.    Eat healthy and exercise.

As long as you diet right, exercise and are commited to making the change.    See a doctor, a nutritionist and a personal trainer to get the best results.    A doctor will test things like your resting heart rate, the health of your heart, blood pressure, cholesterol levels etc etc etc    A nutritionist can help you work out a diet that would be easy and best for you based on foods you will actually eat and also take in consideration things such as intolerances and how much time you have to prepare your own meals    A personal trainer can help you with choosing the right exercises for your current size without straining and injuring yourself, plus they will do regular checks on your strength, fitness, body fat, lean muscle mass and if you pay extra, VO2 max (level of fitness - to do with oxygen intake).    If you find that you think you can do it all yourself, at least see a doctor just to get your vitals checked out if you are quite large (and 150lb is not fat - unless you're like 5 ft).    To help you with the diet and exercise, try to get your family involved. If they usually buy takeaway, offer to make dinner a few nights a week, or have experimental sessions with your mum/dad with a new cook book. It will really help your motivation.

As you grow older, you will realize, people like you not because of the size of your penis, but for the person you are. It matters the most, how caring, loving and selfless you are. Those traits will draw people more closer to you like a magnet. I am a guy, and when I was your age, I used to think, oh come what may..I will only marry a girl with some super sexy boobs, but then I fell in love with this girl, who was so pretty and fun loving, full of life character, but flat chested...my thinking process changed and i was like.who cares if she doesn't have full blown boobs. I was drawn so much to her...that I couldn't live without her! and I love her to this day. So coming back to you, be confident, don't be shy, be courteous, be clean and well dressed and do good to people...I bet your soul mate is waiting for you just round the corner..Also, go to Youtube and search for Randy Pausch and watch some his video's..you will realize how lucky you are to have your life...
7jxbpo0Qaa	The ER is not a place for minor issues like stomach pain.  Perhaps ur daughter did not give them her complete medical history thus resulting in inadequate care.  Per the state of NC, no one can be refused care w/ or w/o parental consent and since they thought she is/was pregnant then HIPPA laws apply.  Call her psychiatrist and get the 411 on suddenly stopping meds.  Since she is under 18 u can get her admitted to psych unit for observation but it sounds like even then u can't guarantee that she will take medications.  Have her go to OB/GYN and get a blood test for pregnancy and have a psych appt. immediately following this..in case she is not preg. and attempts harm to u or herself.  GL and God Bless Us Parents.  (Get some help for urself also..caregivers have burnout!)
zD0V9nQraa	I strongly urge you to get this treated very soon.     Monistat is available over the counter in a 3 day and 7 day treatment.  It is inserted into the vagina via a applicator.  (not the vaginal opening alone)    If this does not take care of your vaginal issues I would suggest seeing a gynecologist who can prescribe you Difulcan. Difulcan is a very powerful pill which usually works in one dose. If you have been examined by a Gynecologist ;you may be able to call their office and ask for Difulcan to be called into your Pharmacy.|`|E2IaiCpyaa	Just use the monostat, the other cream you have to have a prescription for.
bGGWlMgGaa	Ouch, I can sympathise with you. Im 30 and have suffered excruciating ulcers all my life.  Generally it's either trauma to the sight, eg biting the inside of your mouth or your immune system is suppressed. It could also be a deficiency somewhere to.  Over the years i have tried many remedies, but none works more so than icy cold water. Keep your mouth hydrated well, the drier your mouth is the more painful the ulcer will become.  I find oral solutions are completely useless, as they wash off with food drink and your own saliva.|`|uO8sFIuCaa	You can use Bonjela or Orased. (topical mouth solutions)    Or you can go to your doctor and have them cauterize it. Cauterization deadens the nerves that are exposed in the ulcer.    Under no circumstances should you gargle with Hydrogen Peroxide or bleach. This damages all skin and is in no way helpful to a mouth ulcer.|`|1U9YtSW3aa	Home Remedies for mouth ulcers  1 Crush the leaves of the Indian plum (jambula). Give off their paste in water and gargle with this water. It will give instant relief from the pains of the mouth ulcers. One of the good home remedies for mouth ulcers.     2. Gargling with the water of the adulsa (Justicia adhadota) also brings about an instant relief from the mouth ulcer pains.    3. Mix the skin of a lemon with white catechu. Grind them into a very well paste. Apply this straightly on the ulcer. The ulcer will get treated approximately immediately. This remedy is best Home Remedy for Mouth Ulcers.     4. Take two to three leaves of the guava tree and a number of catechu. Chew them together. This will heal even the most persistent of ulcers within a few days. This is also good Home Remedy for Mouth Ulcers    5. Mix some catechu in water till it gets a pasty steadiness and apply this paste on the ulcers. This is another good Home Remedy for Mouth Ulcers    6. Mix a ripened banana in curds that have been prepared from cow's milk and eat this as a dessert.   It will bring about a stable solution to the oral ulcer problems.    Dietary Handling for Mouth Ulcers  Digestive troubles are the leading causes for mouth ulcers. If an oral ulcer occurs abruptly, then it could be due to excessive heat generated in the body due to consuming hot food.     1. When ulcers occur in the mouth, hot and spicy food must be stopped instantly. These will make worse the pains of the ulcers. Caffeine and tea must also be closed.    2. Consuming more green vegetables in the diet helps to be ever protected from ulcers. Greens also provide the essential fiber for the movement of bowels. This avoids constipation.    3. It is desirable to stop fatty food - especially that which contains oils - till the time the ulcers have healed.    4. Papaya is an extremely good fruit to be consumed when you have mouth ulcers. It soothes the mouth ulcers and helps in their fast recovery. Yam is also useful for mouth ulcer problems.|`|DzHB8z6Yaa	In order to get rid of the sores, you will first have to find out what kind of mouth ulcer you havewhether it's cold sore or canker sore. Keep in mind that the two are different conditions and as such, require different ways of treatment. For cold sores:   Use antiviral medications. If you use an antiviral medication such as docosanol during the first signs of infection, then you can decrease the healing time of the sores. Docosanol is not oral; it's topical. Apply it five times a day until the sores are healed.   Avoid picking at the blisters/sores. It might look ugly and it might look inviting but don't pick or squeeze the blisters and sores that form around your mouth. Doing so will only worsen your blisters and maybe even spread the virus.   Take pain relievers. You can take over-the-counter pain relievers to alleviate any pain you may have. Aspirin, ibuprofen and and acetaminophen are good choices.   For canker sores:   Rinse with mouthwash. Tetracycline suspensions may be prescribed by your doctor in order to reduce pain as well as expedite healing time, as are mouth rinses containing dexamethasone.   Use topical solutions. There are also over-the-counter topical medications such as amlexanox and fluocinonide. Debacterol is a good topical solution designed specifically to treat canker sores.   In both cases, the sores should disappear even without the aid of medications. However, if your sores persist for more than three weeks, then consult a physician. It may be more than a normal mouth ulcer.|`|afkygHMgaa	Swish a 3 percent hydrogen peroxide and water solution around your mouth.|`|55zR2zJ6aa	bonjela babess :)|`|OfZI0BaQaa	DRINK WATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i cannot stress this enough    lol believe me! drink water!    i know ! it happend to me once in a while and i hate it.  i drink like only 2 bottles of water and GONE!    it hydrates your body and your body will just fight it off!

zD0V9nQraa	I have good news and bad news for you.    Ok the bad news:    Every woman tends to ovulate at different times throughout their menstrual cycle. So without a ovulation test kit or monitoring your basal temperature and recording it over the course of a few months there is no way to just know.    Ok the good news:    When trying to conceive there is absolutely no harm found in having sex throughout your cycle. Have fun and enjoy trying to conceive.    P.S. There is no sexual position which determines the sex of a baby.|`|2YCqw8mbaa	If ur period cycle  is 28 days then the ovulation takes place on the 14 th day after start of ur last menses.  To have a child it is better to have sex on 13th or 14th or 15th days of the start of the last menses. There is no right position   for choosing the sex of the child.

xdo49r2iaa	Hi,    This is very normal after delivery. To correct the breast size you have increase your diet and have to do breast massage.To make your boobs bigger and firm You can try natural breast enlargment methods . Details are as under    Breast massage as a method of natural breast enlargement and breast health has actually been used for years as a means of stimulating healthy breast growth and promoting breast tone, pliability and firmness.    Here are some guidelines for breast massage you may want to follow:    1.) Use a olive oil or any other oil of your choice to help prevent friction and increase the enjoyment and relaxation of the massage for a more pleasurable and therapeutic experience. This can be an herbal mixture .    2.) Light to moderate massaging using a gentle back and forth gentle swishing action is best. This can be in a counterclockwise circle around the breast to help promote maximum lymphatic drainage.    3.) To gain maximum benefit and therapeutic effects, breast massage should be practiced daily, as part of a routine - perhaps when fresh out of the shower, since the skin is still somewhat moist and the room may still be steamy, for a smoother massage which may be more easily lubricated since there will still be moisture in the air. If you prefer, even several times a day can be a great benefit. It depends on what fits into your schedule. A few minutes at a time should suffice.    .    Enjoy Life|`|A5J4Exc1aa	Your husband should be massaging your breasts every night.

AA10003191	That's normal. It's a response by your body to the chemicals (catecholamines) released when you're nervous.|`|LPCfOtiKaa	there is nothing to correct, that is completely normal. There's nothing you can really do to stop it.  If you are one of those people who smells bad when they sweat then you can buy some chlorophyll and put some in your water and drink it. You can get chlorophyll most places you can buy vitamins. It is basically an internal deoderant.

We have to learn how to deal with it effectively or we will be doomed to taking medication just to get through everyday life.
EfivTWT1aa	twice a week and 8 times a month will yield more efficient results...    also to get rid of the cellulite, the best is to have a tea spoon of honey, daily in the morning once u get up from bed. this burns the extra fat. after some time, have atleast 2 glasses of water, to clear the acidity produced during the night    I found this site useful for some tips for other healthy sources...    may be u could search and find it here...    http://www.health-capsule.blogspot.com|`|aLyJe1b3aa	...|`|VzVzncfXaa	It's important to note that it isn't how often you go to the gym or how long you stay at the gym; it's what you do when you are there. A gym is many things to people -- a place to relieve stress, have healthy "alone time," get physically fit with a trainer or friends or a place to run when it's raining or freezing outside. Shoot for 2-3 times per week for 30-45 minutes each time.    since you have no time for gym...  i'd included this link for you.  it's about - Total Body Home Workout  http://exercise.about.com/cs/exercisewor...    about get rid of the cellulite:    Tone up your muscles with strength building and resistance exercises. Studies have shown that improving muscle firmness can help you get rid of cellulite. Concentrate extra time on muscle beneath the areas with lots of cellulite, but create a total body workout for best results.     Step 2  Stick to a low calorie diet. Cellulite is not exclusive to overweight women, but eating healthy will keep the size of your fat cells small. This is not enough to get rid of cellulite, but it will contribute to the solution.     Step 3  Consider topical creams to that tighten the surface of the skin or the connective tissue beneath the skin. Amino acids, seaweed and ginkgo-biloba extracts all act as skin tighteners. Look for one or more of these ingredients on different anti-cellulite products.     Step 4  Consider topical creams that shrink fat cells. Caffeine is the most common ingredient in these products and acts as a dehydrator. When these products work, they usually work immediately.     Step 5  Splurge on endermologie, an outpatient procedure that involves suction massage to even out the skin. Multiple treatments are required over several months at a significant cost per treatment. Follow-up treatments are also required to maintain results.     Step 6  Try mesotherapy to eliminate localized pockets of fat causing cellulite. Mesotherapy is series of several outpatient procedures in which injections are administered to breakdown fat cells for good. Used in Europe and South America for quite a while, it is now being offered in the U.S. by select plastic surgeons.     Step 7  Research laser treatments to strengthen connective tissue beneath the skin. New procedures are being developed to use lasers to target cellulite, though there is some dispute over their effectiveness.|`|Ay8McJNQaa	Exercising alone wont solve your weight problems, esp. when you train so little. You should watch what you are eating as well.|`|fwnlY9viaa	You really need to get there more often. Aim to be at the gym 2 to3 times per week would be ideal. Spend no more then 2 hours at the gym, but that includes cardio, weight training and a really good stretch afterwards.    At home do some exercises that you can do during commercials while watching tv. Spend one set of commercials doing situps, the next pushups, the following squats etc.    Everyone has time to exercise once they remove things such as watching television being online.
zMNgG9m0aa	um, not entirely sure but don't you have to be pumped full of hormone drugs so you over-ovulate, followed by painful/invasive procedure to remove the eggs? if it doesn't work the first month you have to keep with the drugs for the next month, and so on.    not sure i'd say that was "easy" or "quick". nor will you be pleasant to be around, mood swings and all!    are you planning on more kids? I'm presuming not.    and technically, you aren't "donating" eggs if you're expecting money in return. Why not say it how it is: you're selling your eggs to pay for a boob job. Part of you knows it isn't right, which is why you used "donate" and added that pious bit about helping others. You'll have to make peace with that part of you who doesn't approve.     we're our own worst nightmare aren't we? We hate our bodies after childbirth, why can't we be happy with the natural process of life?    I think it's fine to want your old body back, but I do hope your child is well provided for and you aren't spending money on a boob job that could be better spent elsewhere. I also would like a boob lift after 3 kids! (My demons are more about the surgery.)     whatever you decide, good luck with the motherhood journey! :)|`|Yea0HVfNaa	Wow that's intense!

pzLDXL6gaa	Yeah it can, depends on the imbalance though    Harriet|`|HCWkdk4naa	if you have low progesterone is can make it difficult for you to get pregnant.  also having the testosterone and estrogen levels out of whack can cause a drop in fertility.  If you see a doctor, he/she can perform a hormone check on you to see which ones are high and which are low.  you can either take prescription hormones (pills, creams, injections) or try to correct the balance naturally by eating and avoiding certain foods.      i would suggest trying it the natural way first, and then if that doesn't work, take prescription hormones.  good luck
p3NsXo0baa	Any lumps or nipple discharge? I get this feeling also and it burns at times.

If you do not have a fever or other signs that something is "wrong", and if you don't have any painful symptoms that tell you that you should seek the help of a medical professional, then I would just yield to your body's request for more rest!      Are you getting enough exercise?  How about your diet?  I know you probably get tired of being nagged at, but getting out in the fresh air and having a good walk really helps your body a lot!  The increased oxygen really helps energize a person.  Make sure you eat some good, fresh fruits and vegetables. (Here I go with the nagging again!)    I am a chiropractor in the Twin Cities (Edina, Minnesota), and my approach to healthcare is focused on what often seems like common sense.

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

Thoughts necessary or fashionable, those which refer to  our daily routine, for example: what is what I will put today to go to work?    Useless thoughts, those which do not have constructive utility. They are things of the past which one cannot change any more, as what one could have made if one had done this or that. Or of the thoughts about  the future, as what I one will do if These thoughts, even if they are not negative, empty us of our interior force and tire us.    Negative or destructive thoughts, they are most pernicious because they cause the loss of our peace and interior force. They are founded on irritability, desire, envy, etc.  They may be passed, present or future and they can become obsessives.     Positive thoughts, Are those which bring to us a benefit in all the situations. To think positively does not want to say that we are unaware of reality around us. That comprises to find solutions. They mean acceptance, not resignation.    Our spirit requires  its food which is our thought, the quality of this thought is entirely between our hands, even if the external circumstances have their influence.     our bodies needs healthy food and exercise, we should make  the same way with our spirit by choosing best food: the positive thought.|`|fwWq2llXaa	Acceptance.

Oddly, my arms went numb and tingled on occasion.  Whenever I tried to take a deep breath, it was very difficult, and hurt.    I would suggest you go to the E.R. immediately and have them check it out.  When I went in September, I was diagnosed with gallstone pancreatitis.  I have heard quite a few cases like mine crop up in recent months, and all these cases have the same symptoms you describe.  Nothing works for the pain...except for the high-powered drugs I got through the i.v.    It may not be what your problem is, but I'm telling you, I had those symptoms and waited 10 days before going to the emergency room, which wasn't a smart thing to do.  Please go to the E.R. at least to have it ruled out as a possibility.    ~I want to add that I'm not trying to scare you into going to the E.R., but this could be a very serious condition and not many people think about their gall bladder right off the bat.

First is to go to a neurosurgeon ( specialist doctor for spine) and let him check up to find whether anything is wrong and he will give u proper advice.  If nothing serious could be located then u go to a Yoga practitioner who will  advice u for certain yogic exercises and meditation which will give u wonderful cure.  I had similar pain and i was not able to walk and I consulted a yoga therapist and the pain decreased by 80% in 10 days time.  Similar was the case of my neighbour lady.  If the yogic exercises are interrupted the pain will reappear again and will disappear only on  doing the yoga continuously.  In India it is common to get yogic therapy. ANANDA MARG is a nonprofit taking organisation which has branches all over the world and is giving advice in  such matters.

If there was a quick and easy way that doesn't take much effort, there would be no fat people. The best way would be to eat healthy, maybe replace a salad with some low fat meat, like chicken or tuna, with meals. Like Breakfast: raisin bran Lunch: Turkey sandwich with grapes on the side Dinner: Salad with grilled chicken. Also be sure to eat all meals about 4 to five hours apart and try to have small snacks in between. Such as celery stalks and baby carrots in ranch (it doesn't really need to be low fat, just keep an eye on portions when it comes to dressings), and also nutrition bars, really keep an eye on those as far as portions go, and don't eat after about 7pm (1900 hours). Also try to walk as much as possible, if you have any active friends try to go out with them as much as you can, if you live within a 20 minute walking distance, walk to their house instead of getting a ride. Losing weight is REALLY tough and I am also working on losing some of mine. So I wish you the best of luck.

gQqO1sPxaa	She is most likely gritting her teeth. Depending on how old she is it could be for a variety of reasons, stress, having nightmares, etc, but this can also happen to an individual for no reason and without them actually knowing that it is happening. Some people after waking up from gritting their teeth will begin to get migraines during the day because of it. A good way of fixing this issue may be for her to wear a retainer which keeps the teeth from gritting. Its not the most comfortable or flattering thing, but if the gritting teeth become an issue, it may be the thing that solves your problem. Hope this helps!|`|KP1z24cXaa	It sounds like Bruxism.

Rk46lIBwaa	You don't say if you smoke, which would be all the explanation needed as smokers continuously produce excess mucous after a while, and this continues even if they stop.    If you are a non smoker, it might be due to a local irritant or allergen or also possibly post viral hyper-reactivity. Do you remember if you had even a simple cold just before the problem started?    4 weeks would have have been enough time to wait and see, at 2 months a GP visit is justified. Hopefully you will not see someone who prescribes inappropriately. There is no real possibility that your symptoms would be explained by bacterial disease and therefore an antibiotic is NEVER going to be the correct management.    am 38 and Kelly B are correct hyper-reactivity is an asthma-like problem, though anyone can experience it and a 4-6 week course of inhaled steroids might settle things down, but other possibilities would need to be excluded first.    EDIT: BTW Kelly B bit concerned about your comment re yourself. Asthmatics don't get any more 'chest infections' than non asthmatics, at least until they are much older and their disease, as it can do if poorly treated, gradually moves across from asthma, which is reversible airways disease, to COPD which is not. Unfortunately however many patients even with clearly diagnosed asthma which is not fully controlled, that is still has breakthrough periods of instability with colds, still meet poor GPs who tell them that they have a chest infection and prescribe useless antibiotics, when in fact they should of course be modifying the asthma management or using steroids to treat break though.|`|q7mActnmaa	If you smoke that could be what is doing it.      -Cass|`|et39TGIsaa	Do you smoke?

gWoZYpX6aa	I definitely think this is something worth talking to your doctor about. The headaches could be due to any number of things from a simple vision problem, or potassium deficiency to something more serious like migraines or a brain tumor (which is very rare, so I wouldn't be too worried.) There are hundreds of things that can cause headaches and any number of them could be affecting you right now.     My advice to you would be to schedule an appointment with your general practitioner and explain everything that has been going on. Also, make an appointment with an optometrist to rule out or verify vision trouble. If you don't have an optometrist, ask your GP for a referral during your appointment.     I wish you luck, headaches are the worst. I've been dealing with migraines for years and I feel your pain, literally. Hopefully you and your doctor will find the answer and get things sorted out soon!|`|dGM6JGqdaa	Have you ever drank a lot of coffee or soda pop with caffeine in it and then reduced the intake ?

5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	This is not a freak death.    He either had asthma really bad or he had an asthma attack while drunk.    He got drunk which interferes with breathing and then already having asthma. It interfered even more with his asthma.    By him coming home and opening the window clues me in that he was already having respiratory distress and being drunk he was unable to tell anyone or do anymore about the distress so he died.    I have asthma and sometimes the cold air helps me feel better.  That maybe why he opened the window.    I am sorry at your loss.|`|rLsphyqhaa	Not a doctor however a few things for thought. He was drunk so that leads me to think he could have possible choke on his own vomit, in other words he got sick and was not able to get up and let all the stuff out of his body thus it was caught in is throat to which he then suffocates or drowns on his own vomit. Also you say the doctors cut away part of his leg. Not known all that has taken place with him as to his medical back ground, this makes me think he might have had some diabetes. Many with such must be very care full with injury. As simple as a splinter can become infected and then one has to have that finger of toe removed. I knew a guy who as a clown, some kid came up and hit his foot think the big shoes were a joke(in part they were but he still hit the toe)within 2 month he dies from an infection. So with all that said and he had his window open both could have contributed to his early dismiss. Sorry to read about it, some crazy and freaky thing do happen. I know of someone who tripped over a cord and is now paralyzed from the neck down.
JMOLRKRraa	Definitely allergy possibilty, took me years to figure out I was allergic to gluten, wheat and such. Stopped eating it and eczema cleared up drastically. I think the wet moisture makes the area more noticeable after the shower. Note your diet and eliminate a food group once a week until you figure it out. Just one group at a time. And the allergist didn't note it, i figured it out when i tried adkins for 2 weeks. Good luck.  Are you itchy also? That is definite indicator of allergy eczema.|`|BVqCcqOGaa	Try herbal remedies from serenaskin.com, it's natural, no steroids, and works very well for me.

0zdHykkSaa	you must not be eating what your body wants. when it's telling you it's hungry, it doesn't mean for just anything. that's why you could eat a meal at mcdonalds and even though you should be full, you still feel like you could eat again. biscuits isn't very healthy. try eating fruit, salads, and drinking plenty of water. eat lean but filling meats like turkey. just trial and error. find out what your body's wanting from you.|`|OBwqjS8maa	Well, if you're trying to curb hunger, eating biscuits isn't going to help.

Keep yourself busy and if you find yourself craving more food do something tactile with your hands (best method of distraction).|`|05b50e76d5f07cae496cea01c12ec5feaa	Try looking up High Fructose Corn Syrup. It's found in a lot of foods. Too much of it can cause an insulin surge which effects your brain and can cause you to have an increased appetite. Protein can help you to stay fuller longer. So I would suggest meals or even snacks with more protein to help crave your hunger. A lot of meats are packed with Protein.

She suffered from it really bad but she got it from stress. She went to the doctors and they gave her this special stuff to put on her hangs and she cleared up in 2 weeks or so.|`|P1H02dqgaa	Oh hon!    This sounds really sore.  You've got an added problem too with your OCD and not being able to leave on handcreams without the need to wash your hands again.    The only things I can suggest is a type of glove I've seen that already has a moisturiser contained in the fabric.  They don't feel greasy, you pop them on before you go to bed, and over the course of the night the heat from you body releases the moisturiser into the pores of your skin.  I'm so sorry, but I can't remember where I've seen them (maybe Boots or Superdrug I think!).  Try the internet too - search for moisturising gloves - places like "Just Beautifully.co.uk" do a product called Jessica Nails Geluscious for about 20 (and you only have to wear them for 20 mins).  Amazon too, do a few different types - so just have a search around.    Or perhaps, a bowl of warm water with a liberal squirt of baby oil.  Soak you hands for a few minutes and then pat dry.  Is this something that you might be able to stand - perhaps worth a go.    Hope this helps a little, best of luck hon.  Karen
kLOsSXbUaa	Choleterol is only found in food products that are derived from animals so that's all meat, eggs, cheese, milk, butter, gelatin etc. Dairy  products have relatively less cholesterol than meat and eggs so my advice would be to avoid those for now. As long as you keep having enough carbohydrates (pasta, potatoes, rice) you shouldn't lose weight and make sure you have plenty of green veg to keep up your iron intake. Well done you for wanting to be healthy! Good luck x|`|G5vGTTqhaa	6 weeks Cheerios|`|olMoJiYmaa	eat less bacon sandwhiches|`|c3DqvgE4aa	If you have high cholesterol, it may be necessary for you to make some lifestyle changes. If you smoke, stop smoking. Exercise regularly. If you're overweight, losing just 5 to 10 pounds can help lower cholesterol levels. Make sure to eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fish- all of which promote heart health. Avoid saturated and trans fats, which can raise cholesterol levels. Also limit your overall cholesterol intake to less than 300 milligrams (200 milligrams if you have heart disease) per day.|`|qlO6UZZyaa	Many Holistic Health experts believe high cholesterol isn't caused by what you eat, its what you can properly digest. Improve your digestion by eating meat type proteins alone, not by yourself, (small joke) but away from other foods. This provides more stomach acid and enzymes to digest the proteins and fats. You may also want to get a digestive enzyme supplement from a health food store.|`|eab67f43c0cff3a2dc3c807267bbd536aa	Excercise, oat meal and more protein like brewer's yeast, soy products and lean meat or fish with a cup boiled red rice that is natural statin medicine.

"Some cholesterol is made by your body. The food you eat is responsible for the rest. Food products from animals contain cholesterol  including meats, poultry, shellfish, eggs, butter, cheese and whole or 2 percent milk. And any type of food can also contain saturated fats and trans fats, which cause your body to make more cholesterol.   The American Heart Association recommends that you keep your intake of total fat to between 25 percent and 35 percent, your saturated fat consumption to less than 7 percent and your intake of trans fat to less than 1 percent of your total daily calories.  At the same time, limit your intake of cholesterol from food to less than 300 mg per day. People with high LDL (bad) blood cholesterol levels or who are taking cholesterol medication should consume less than 200 mg of cholesterol per day.  Eat at least 25 to 30 grams of dietary fiber each day  preferably from whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes.    To combat high blood pressure and for overall cardiovascular health, limit sodium to 2,300 mg or less per day. Some people  African Americans, middle-aged and older adults, and people with high blood pressure  need less than 1,500 mg per day. And if you drink alcohol, do so in moderation (no more than one drink a day for women, no more than two for men).   teansfats.  "But a heart-healthy diet isn't just about what you shouldn't eat. It also means eating a diet rich in vegetables and fruits, with whole grains, high-fiber foods, lean meats and poultry, fish at least twice a week, and fat-free or 1 percent fat dairy products. Also, the diet should be low in saturated trans-fats"  diet:  Cholesterol lowering foods - this may sound as an oxymoron! However, studies prove that some foods can assist in the reduction of cholesterol and could be incorporated into your new diet plan.  Cholesterol Lowering Margarine  Recently, cholesterol lowering margarines have been introduced to the market. Benecol? is one of the products that has been confirmed to lower cholesterol on an average of 10% if used as recommended. In addition, this margarine does not affect your HDL, or "good" cholesterol. Other products include Take Control? margarine and salad dressings that are made from plant sterols, which are extracted from soybeans. These sterols trick your intestine into thinking they are cholesterol and when it tries to absorb them, it is not able to, therefore blocking cholesterol.  Soy Protein  Cholesterol lowering quality of soy protein was evidenced when FDA approved (see FDA talk paper) the health claim for its effects on risk of heart disease. To achieve intended result, you have to consume at least four servings of 6.25 grams of soy protein totaling daily intake to 25 grams per day. Many food manufacturers have since introduced soy beverages and energy bars containing up to 10 to 20 grams of soy protein. People with high cholesterol - levels of 260-300, soy protein has shown to reduce cholesterol by 15-25%.  Nuts  Nuts such as almonds and walnuts that have high amount of monounsaturated or polyunsaturated, also help lowering cholesterol. Researchers at the Loma Linda University found that a diet containing pecans (click here for Abstract) not only lowered total and LDL--or "bad" cholesterol significantly but also helped to maintain desirable levels of HDL--or "good"--cholesterol. Another study conducted by the same University found that Mediterranean style diet that included walnuts (click here for Abstract) lowered cholesterol.  Oats and Barley  In lowering cholesterol, oats and barley have played a critical role. These foods have a soluble fiber known as Beta Glucan, which is the key, in how they lower the cholesterol. To gain the intended cholesterol lowering effect, you have to consume anywhere between two and four cups of dry oat or barley cereal each day.  Fruits and vegetables such as apples, citrus fruit, berries, carrots, apricots, cabbage, sweet potatoes are high in soluble fiber and pectin both shown to be helpful in lowering cholesterol. At least five servings a day is recommended to benefit the full effects.  Flaxseed provides alpha-linolenic acid a poly-unsaturated fat which has been shown to lower cholesterol while providing needed soluble fibe  Olive oil is one of the mono-saturated fats and studies have shown that it lowers blood cholesterol. Extra virgin olive oil is suggested to be better than other varieties.  Fish  According to researchers, fish containing a omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids make the blood more slippery and less likely to clot in addition to lowering blood cholesterol.  Cautions:  Instead of frying foods, bake, roast, or grill. Cut back on egg yolks and if you drink 2% milk change to 1% and if possible, skim milk.
