20090225023517AA8Lkde	Pets;Other - Pets	Ferret biting and punishment?	I just got a pet ferret today, it is 3 months old. Later that night I was sitting at my computer chair doing some work and had my left hand by his face. He started to lick at my fingers, which I didn't mind. But then he started to bite. At first it was very gentle nipping, but then he started biting really hard, It actually started to hurt, and he gave me a blood blister. I immediately smacked him on the nose, but looked up a way to punishment, I did the "hold his scruff, shake, and say NO." I set him down after that but he came back to bite my toes. I did it again but this time I also added the grabbing the scruff and dragging him about a foot. He ran away immediately and hid from me. It seems to have worked for now, I was curious if he thinks he is playing, I don't know what he's doing! He keeps coming back and trying to bite at my feet. I don't have a carrier/cage for him yet, so I just try to loom over him/establish dominance, and if he starts at my toes again I lightly brush him away with my foot, just powerful enough to push him over. Afterward he will leave me be for a little while.   Is he playing? ALSO, he seems almost in pain when I grab his scruff and shake him lightly. He closes his eyes and opens his mouth really wide. Is that bad, or is he just being a baby?
20090225024057AAOYPDb	Pets;Cats	Odd behavior of my Persian....?	I have a tea cup Persian cat which has a white coat and blue eyes.      Its 5 months and is a male, i have been noticing its odd behavior from a couple of days.      Yesterday evening at 5pm it was like not moving from the place with its body not in control and hissing continuously for a whole minute even though i picked it up and put it on the bed it continued doing that and then fell asleep.      And the whole night it was kinda burping.      I asked this to a breeder, he dint know about this.      I ignored it.      Now i left it on the terrace to play with my supervision and what i noticed was that the cat is just doing what dogs do. Sticking its tongue out and and hissing just like what the dogs do.      I hope your getting what I'm saying......
20090225024022AAroze5	Pets;Cats	Rabies from a small cat scratch?	Heyy x      I was at school the other day when a couple of cute little kittens were lying by the stairs.  My friend said that they looked clean because their coats were glossy but they didnt have a collar and we have a FEW strays around our school but not many.      I was about to give the one kitten a pat on the head when it shyed away from me and scratched me.  It bled a small bit [like a papercut] and is not even 1 centimeter.      My Mom says I am being silly, but I am not sure.  It doesnt sting or anything but I am not sure and I need to know if I should have it checked up and the chances of the cat having rabies.      Thanks x

I had 3 fish from the old tank and added 5 new fish to the new tank day 1 (This is the only thing I can think might not be good but it's been two weeks now "fully cycled" and they are still dying)      STEPS I TOOK:   I filled the new tank with about half of the water from the old tank.   I added water conditioner.   I added PH Balance.   I added ammonia remover & the Filter Stones that remove ammonia   I have a large bubble stone- great oxygenation.   I was running two filters for a week (used the old one to get the good bacteria (level tested "good")    Temp. 76   Fresh Water Tank   I feed the fish sparingly ONCE a day - 6 days / week to avoid excess waste build up.   The water tested near perfect when I brought a sample to Petco- they have 100 fish in a 10 gallon tank and they are fine.  I had 8 (1") fish and all but one have died- many were hanging out at the top.

My cat has never liked my dog, and my (100 pound) dog is scared of my cat. My dog never crosses her path, if my cat is in a hallway, my dog won't go past her and will whine until I move kitty out of the way :P She hisses and paws at the dog when my dog does get too close.    Well, now that I've got a new puppy, there's twice as much hissing and pawing.      I'm afraid it's too much for her to handle. Is it?   I have to give her to my mom in a few months because I'm going off to college, but I'm thinking maybe I should give her to my mom sooner if she's getting really stressed out. I'd like my puppy to get used to cats, and I want to spend time with her before I leave, but not at the expense of her health and sanity.

20090225062109AAgeqXU	Pets;Dogs	Was this a legit reason to euthanize the dog?	A friend of mine had a large breed dog that was around 7 years old.  Recently, one of her cats had kittens and she left the dog, unsupervised, with the cat and three kittens.  The dog ate two of the kittens.  Then, a week later (yesterday), the dog ate the other kitten.  The owner chose to euthanize the dog  this morning because she was afraid he'd become a threat to other animals and/or people.  I feel so awful for the poor dog.  The owner was the one that left her unsupervised with the kittens!  I feel like its more her fault than it was the dogs.  Now she's coming to me for support and encouragement and I can't even look her in the eye.  Should I say something to her, fake my 'support' or just simply not speak to her about the issue?  Did she genuinely do the right thing?  (The dog WAS put down at 7:00 this morning.  Its really too late to try to intervene.  If I had known what was going on, I definitely would have done something.)

20090225060905AAAe4jV	Pets;Dogs	Any suggestions on how to train...?	I have been having great luck with training my five month old puppy.  Most things he learns within 5 minutes and he retains the information - such as sit, roll over, etc.  He even gives me a high five!  He is a very good puppy, but pretty hyper, as most puppies are :)  The one thing that I am really struggling with is teaching him to STAY.  I have tried everything I can think of and I haven't had any luck.  He either moves to me as soon as I back away because he always wants to be near me, or he loses interest and just starts sniffing the floor and walks away to find a toy!  Does anyone have any good tips?  What has worked for you?  I appreciate your help!

20090225043921AA8ha5S	Pets;Cats	Why is my kitten so crazy?	Haru, my kitten is now 4 months old, but she is INSANE she tears at everything, climbs on the table, eats my brothers dinner (hes blind, so he doesnt know if shes there or not) she bites all the time and scratches, she is being very vicious, she climbs the doors, meows CONSTANTLY and she tears up the fake plants, i have tried cat nip to calm her down, which did nothing, i sprayed it on all her toys and new bed, it did nothing, i tried cat repellent to keep her off the plants, it also does nothing. ive tried spraying her with water when shes naughty, but now ive sprayed her so much she just doesnt care, ive put lemon in the water, because i heard that cats dont like the smell of citrus, ive tried smacking her (not too hard) when she is naughty and saying, very firmly (for example) "NO Haru! naughty, do not climb the doors" ive tried picking her up by the scruff and firmly saying "no" then ignoring her. ive tried everything and my family is sick of it, they want to get rid of her! but i love her so much, i couldnt stand to lose her. as for the constant meowing, why is she doing that, she used to do it when i first got her, when i wasnt within her sights, now its a constant thing...its VERY irritating, she likes to do it at 5am every morning, and if she doesnt succeed in waking you with meowing alone, she will get in the bed and either nudge you, tickle you with her whiskers or bite your face, which is unacceptable, i dont want her to grow up being vicious, i treat her with respect, and show her attention whenever possible....what am i doing wrong?

20090225040555AAggoli	Pets;Cats	Kitten with toilet problems?	Hi      I have a 13 week old kitten. I got her at 6 weeks (petshop lied and said she was 8 weeks). For about 5 weeks now she has had toilet issues. At first she was bleeding when she pooed, and it seemed painful for her. The vet prescribed worming medicine. This fixed the problem for about a week after the antibiotics stopped.      Then she started crying when she pooed, it was always very large, and her bum was swollen and painful afterwards. The vet said he thought she was so constipated (as she was only going once a day and it was so big), that she was pushing her rectum out. He advised me to take out the biscuits in her diet which I did. She now only eats wet kitten food, which has been exactly brand the same since I've had her. I dont think her food is the issue as on this food she has had good and bad toilet experiences, but please feel free to disagree if it helps me!      So after taking out the biscuits, it still did not get better. I again took her to the vet and they prescribed liquid parafin to ease her poos. After 4 days on this medicine she has diahorrea. Its not very bad, just half of her poo last night was almost liquid and the rest was semi-solid. It did not seem to hurt her at least, so the parafin definately eased it.      I am due to take her back to the vets as soon as I physically can (tomorrow most likely) but I worry that they will only give me more medicine or tell me to let it be and see if it fixes itself. And I feel like she has constantly been on medicine, which is not working. The vet said they had never heard of a kitten with huge poos that strained their bum so much!      Could anyone make any suggestions please, or let me know if you had any similar experiences? I'd like to know what to ask the vet to test for if someone here has had a similar experiences.       I'm at my wits end and just want to fix this before any lasting damage is done to her bum, or she becomes too scared of the pain to keep using the toilet!         Thanks - Sadie

Last night, he jumped out of the tank through the opening in the back. We were in the bedroom watching TV, I went out to our living room and there he was on the floor. We imminently put him back in the tank. He was dry, so we think he was out for a while. He is still alive today. Last night he didn't move for a while but he was breathing, then suddenly started to swim around like  he was better. The rest of the night he just stayed still.    Today, he is moving but not as fast as when we first brought him home, but better than last night. He appears to be okay but he will move, then stop for a minute, then continue.       My question is, will he be okay and get back to normal or is there something seriously wrong.

20090225054310AAVSE5o	Pets;Other - Pets	Why are ferrets illegal when cats are not?	A lot of places outlaw ferrets on the basis that feral ferrets will go around eating songbirds and other at risk species. This has shown to be the case in New Zealand, where some idiot bred polecats with ferrets and released them to deal with the rabbit problem....when of course the hybrids started destroying all the natural inhabitants of New Zealand, ferrets were banned.      So, why does the humble ferret get the blame for all of this when cats are WAY worse??? Now dont get me wrong, I adore cats and I am not arguing they should be banned, but most cats are free roaming cats and they are one of the biggest threat to native songbird populations, bell on the collar or no bell on the collar. Most ferrets in America are kept indoors and are never off a harness when they do get outside, they also tend to be neutered before they even reach their permanent homes. Of those that are released, many probably die. Not all, perhaps, but most, and those that do survive are probably neutered anyway!      Can anyone explain to me in a logical manner how this makes sense, without making use of stereotypes about ferrets such as, they are vicious, they carry rabies etc etc? To me it seems the only answer is that cats are socially acceptable and ferrets are not.

20090225061609AAI1sO4	Pets;Cats	Will it ever be banned in the U.S.?	 http://s311.photobucket.com/albums/kk459...       This guy's name is Gizmo.  Awhile back I rescued him - he was a "stray" cat in the neighborhood.  When he came up to my front door begging for food he was very skinny, covered in fleas and was very badly cut all over his body and face up from being attacked by other stray cats.  Unfortunately, he was 'homeless' for about 8 months ( I had seen him running around the streets by my house).  I took him to the vet and got him cleaned up.  While I was at the vet, she informed me that he had a terrible upper respiratory infection, he had already been neutered and he was declawed (by his previous owners).  He was obviously someone's pet.   I'm sure that his previous owners did not think he would get out of the house and therefore thought that it was okay to declaw him.  This poor animal was running around for 8 long months not being able to defend himself and had to work double what an original cat would have to do to find food in order to survive.      I dont understand.. it really upsets me that people know the risks but they have their cat declawed anyway.  I've heard from a lot of people "I'm going to declaw my cat - it doesnt matter because he NEVER gets outside of the house" - Yea, I bet thats what Gizmo's previous owners also said.      When people also mention that "I talked to my vet and they said that they've never heard of declawed cats having any long term effects", I remind them that:      Gizmo, because he doesn't have claws - he bites (hard).  He wobbles a lot while he's walking (because he's lost his balance from not having claws).  He experiences pain in his legs, hips and spine (cats walk on their toes, when they get declawed).  So they must learn how to "walk" again - in an unfamiliar/unnatural way.         Do YOU think declawing will ever be banned in the U.S?  Why? or Why not?

20090225061632AAUkCL2	Pets;Dogs	I know Wal-mart is the saving place. But I've about had it with people!!!!!!!!!?	I stock shelves overnite at a local Wal-mart and I've seen people do some realy ignorant things but I cannot nor will I understand WHY people think it's alright to dump their animals in our parking lot.   We have counted 8 cats. Some we've watched grow from tiny kittens to adults. And today I saw a dog in the lot that I tried to get to come to me but it ran off into the dark. later we saw it on the cameras monitor outside the dock door. When the door opened he tried to come inside.   I was well pleased that my supervisor allowed me to leave work early so I could buy some food and get it in my truck to bring it home. Poor thing is hurt but roaming happily around my house. It's a very young pit/shepherd mix. He has'nt bothered my 2 cats and other than a little growling at my un-neutered male dog we have yet to have a problem. But everytime I look at the poor thing with all his ribs showing and the open wound on his hind leg that's not all that serios {Thank GOD} I get so mad I want to punch someone in the mouth!   Evan tho it took 2 of us with leashes on both sides of him to get him in my truck - once there he had no problem eating from my hand. He is not one bit food aggressive. He's obviously housebroken and made himself quite comfortable on my couch.    He has such a sweet disposition. How could anyone just drop him off to fend for himself? People make me sick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

20090225060140AAv20vb	Pets;Cats	My cat has bilirubin in his urine and is having a blood test for liver problems?	Took my Kitty in for his yearly check up and he had been having loose stools.  Dr. started with bladder test first as his urine pattern had changed in the litter box (more in the middle than on the side, more like a saucer shape, may have no bearing?) The urine test showed small amts of bilirubin which I guess reflects something from the liver.  So he is going in today for a blood test to see what that shows.  Nothing I can do until then, just wondering what you all know about it.  Looked on Internet...all I find is fat liver disease, can be treated, can be fatal.  How bad is this?  Do I drive my self nuts?  Treatment says I may have to inject food into him?  IDK.  Hope he will be ok.  Other than that...he has not changed, he is 6 1/2.  He is eating and drinking well.  Water has not increased.  Very active.  Indoor cat.  His name is Wilson!  He is so hungry right now!  They said no food after midnite.  Poor kitty!  THANK YOU ALL IN ADVANCE, MY CAT FRIENDS!

20090202090312AAbnUsZ	Pets;Horses	General advice on looking into the loan of a new horse?	I've been riding for more or less 11 years, i'm 17 and have had two horses on loan in the past. I gained a good relationship with a cheeky 14.3hh Cob in the past, which was nice but i've recently been looking into loaning another.      The one in particular (what i've heard so far) is a 15.2hh, 10 y/o TB mare. Apparently she is ridden by a beginner (to some extent) but is looking for a sharer. The person in question who contacted me was the owner of the horse's mother.      In the past, i had a 16.2hh TB on (a short!) loan. This horse was pretty spooky and always freaked at the gate when going out to hack and plain refused to go - backing up, little rears etc - and never let me mount him. He was fine if you could jump up from the ground but i require a block to get on. In the end, i just ended up doing lunging in the squalid field as it had no riding school - it was basically someones back garden with some stables in it.      I feel like i could be heading in the same direction with this horse, but just in a different disguise. The horse was described as the following:      She has had very little proper riding and schooling since her hubby has had her(nearly3 years),he just doesn't have time to ride her - she does benefit being ridden regularly or tends to forget her manners etc   She is a fabulous 15.2 thorougbred mare which my son in law rides. Although he is an absloute beginner,she is not a beginner ride.   This one likes to hack and everything else - she can jump a little but her rider isn't exactly skilled at it. The horse could be 100% better than she is and def deserves to be ridden more.         What do you all think? Should i pursue this horse? I wouldn't say the Cob was a novice ride, but i'm still not quite sure what to do. Please help!

But this has me shook! He did have kennel cough about a year ago. It was supposedly taken care of, but in the 6 months I have had him, he has a ton of congestion. The vet had him on antibiotics for a month straight. It worked as long as he takes the antibiotic, as soon as he quits it, hes sick again. He has really awful breath, chest congestion, runny nose, crusty eyes, and a hacking/gagging problem. I have taken him off the antibiotics, as they are expensive & not good on a continuous basis, and started him on probiotics for 2 weeks now. I am open to any suggestions to help my little guy. He has had a BAD life, & my only goal is to help him feel better & know what a good life is all about. I dont have alot of money & truly just trust all natural over prescription meds. Thanks for any help or knowledge that you can share.

20090225045459AA3BgGH	Pets;Horses	Should we separate them??	I have two horses in a paddock together and they get along great. The problem is that they are extremely attached to each other.  So much so that whenever they are separated they pretty much freak out.  Whoever is left in the paddock goes around bucking and acting crazy.  The one that is brought out tries to bolt.  If they are on a trail together, the alpha horse will bolt or buck if the other horse gets out of his line of vision or is too far ahead.  When the alpha horse is on a trail ride alone he is perfect.  We have had quite a few people, including a very experienced trainer, suggest that we separate them.  There's a part of me that would totally feel guilty and another part that is frusterated with the behavior.  What do you all think??????

The chicks hatched about a week and a half ago and just today, the nest was infested by red ants. The younger of the chicks died, being bitten to death by the ants. The elder survived, and I tried dusting off the ants from its body for a long time. Then, I powdered some insecticide tablets and sprinkled very little on the chick and the rest on the nest. This happened in the evening, and I'm afraid that cause it's dark, the mother won't return. I brought the chick once before finally placing it on a plastic sheet on the nest, and that time, the mother sat ono a near by tree branch and then after a while flew away. So now the chick's on a plastic sheet in the nest. What do I do? Do I take care of it? If yes how? Or do I wait for another day, that is, through the night? Or will it be too late tomorrow morning?

20090225054913AA0SpXD	Pets;Cats	Urgent veterinary advice needed (UK) for my elderly persian cat. Thank you.?	Hi all.      I am looking for information about vets, ideally in the West Midlands area, that would be appropriate for my cat...      She is a 15 year old persian and despite her golden age she is as fit and healthy as she has ever been and still climbs, runs and plays regularlly. Each year at this time my partner and I struggle to keep her fur under control as she has a lot of downy fluffy fur and knots up very easily. She has had to go to the vet to be shaved only a few times in her life when she was younger; for the last 8 years at least we have managed to keep the knots under control ourselves.      Over the last few days i have noticed an injury on her nose- it looks like it may have been a scratch but is not very deep, although there is a strip that looks almost skinned and quite sore. As she is licking it often it is not healing and i think it may be getting worse. In addition, today i have noticed that there may be a problem with her mouth- it looks as though a part of her gum is growing inwards towards the mouth and she is sometimes rubbing it with her paw and licking it. Despite my best efforts I cannot hold her mouth open long enough to really see what is going on. I really feel that she needs to see a vet.   The problem is that her knots are getting quite bad- i know that I can deal with it as i do every year but i also expect the vet to say that she needs to be shaved. Since i moved to the midlands 5 years ago she has not seen a vet (i don't vaccinate her anymore as she is a house cat, i know that this is controversial but please can we leave that debate for another time :) ) so she is not registered in this area and so i no longer have a vet that i have a good rapport with. I am not opposed to having her shaved but i really do not want her to be sedated due to her age; a persian that my mother used to have was sedated at age 13 and was not the same again for the following 3 years of her life. I would not forgive myself if my otherwise healthy cat made a rapid decline due to a sedation when i know i can trim these knots myself.      So my queries are these.. has anyone heard of a vet that will shave a cat without sedation? (i have heard of this in the past but don't know if it is common) and/or if i take her to a local vet, do i have the right to refuse sedation for shaving or can they enforce it based on perceived welfare issues?   I do accept that she may need to be sedated anyway to examine her mouth and if so i will accept it and keep my fingers crossed. This little cat means the absolute world to me so please do not think that i would keep her in any discomfort, i will do whatever is in her best interest, but i know uneccesary sedation will put her at risk.       Thank you for reading this, any advice at all will be gratefully received. My partner is away at the moment so i am dealing with this alone and am getting in a right flap about it!

I noticed she was rubbing her bottom around yesterday and upon looking, she seems to have a small growth or medium sized skin tag (at least thats what it looks like) near her anus. This is new, or at least larger than before, because I've never noticed it. It doesn't seem to really bother her, but I was just curious if anyone had seen this happen to their ferret before. She is spayed and descented already.

20090203143914AAloSPr	Pets;Dogs	Rehabilitating a neglected dogs fear?	18 months ago my husband and I picked up a 6 year Labrador/Golden Retriever cross from a foster home, to keep our 6 year old Mini Foxie company while we were at work.      She a is fabulous dog,, placid and great with kids, but when we picked her up we were told she had a few issues.  Apparently she came from a puppy farm, not a breeder and was taken from her litter at 6 weeks (between 6 – 8 weeks they learn to play) so she had no idea how.  She was never trained, she was never socialised with other dogs or people, so she feared both.  When she was younger her owners would harness her up like a snow dog and have her pull him around on his skate board, so she developed pulling muscle, then they had kids and she was put into the backyard and never walked so she became quite overweight.  She was neutered (at least they did something).  She was never even named.      My husband, my Mini Foxie and I have been working really hard with her, to build trust, how to walk (the first few were literally between my legs) teach her to play and socialise with people.      But we just can’t seem to tackle her fear of other dogs.  It doesn’t seem to matter what size, breed, energy (playful or passive).  If it has four legs and fur, she just wants nothing to do with it.     She tries to hide, if at home behind furniture.  If on a walk, then we must walk the long way around the other dog and stop every few metres to check we are no being followed (the dog, not me). Occasionally try to charge (which gives me an upper body work out).      My biggest concern is that one day that fear might turn to aggression, then we have a whole other issue on our hands (touch wood – it hasn’t happened yet).      I don’t want her to be best friends with everyone she meets, but I would like her comfortable enough around other dogs to take her to dog school for some proper training, rather than just the stuff we do at home.      Anyone have any tips on how to help her overcome her fear?      Sorry for the length of this…

20090202103506AAcnjBo	Pets;Dogs	Adopting a retired racing Greyhound?	I've always wanted to adopt a retired greyhound. I think they are wonderful, gentle, beautiful dogs who deserve a great loving home. All the rescues in my area won't place one in a home with small children. I have a one year old and plan to try for our second child this summer. (Where I hope to be a stay home mom afterwords) I hate the thought of having to wait almost 5 years to adopt one, since they say they won't adopt out to homes with children under 4. I feel if you raise your kids right, it shouldn't be a problem. We have a Shih Tzu now who plays so great with my son. They are best friends and he is very good to her.       Anyway, has anyone adopted a retired Greyhound before? What was the process like? Is it rewarding to provide a home for a grey? Are rescues really strict on the child age thing?

20090203141838AACeg58	Pets;Birds	How can I convince my parents to let me get a bird? ?	Hey there, I have a bit of a dilemma. I'm an avid bird lover; they're my favorite animal, and I've wanted one for a pet for years now. I'm 14, and I currently have a dog and a cat which I take care of.       I've done a lot of research on the type of bird I want (budgerigar). I've got a few books on them, I've looked at plenty of websites, and I've talked to friends and teachers who have had birds before as pets. I think a bird would be a great companion for me. The bird would be mine. I would take full responsibility for it - my parents would hardly even have to see it.       I've bothered my parents about this for a long, long time. Always, their answer has just been "No". Occasionally, when I try to pry them for a reason, they say, "Because this is my house, and I don't want a bird in this house." I asked my parents if there was anything I could do to change their minds. My mom told me, "It has nothing to do with the money, or your level of responsibility. We just don't like birds."      I respect them and their feelings towards this, but is there anything that I can do to try and change their mind?

I understand the occasionally bite, but nothing that is painful.   3) It has to like being handled. It will be in it's cage 85% of the time, but for that 15% of the time, it's go time.   4) I'm open to everything except snakes, spiders, or scorpions.   5) I can feed it live things, rather not, but hey. If it's a live thing though, I really rather not have be noisy, bite, or be huge.   GO!
20090203143512AAzTO6k	Pets;Dogs	How can I ease my dog's separation anxiety?	This Thursday night I have to take my dog to the Pets Hotel until Friday evening. He will be two years old in May 2009. He has only been to a dog boarding facility once when he was 6 months old, and it was CRAZY. When I came the next day to pick him up, I found that he had cut his nose pretty bad from rubbing it against the metal gate door of the kennel. I had left him at my Vet's office thinking if was a great place and also because they provided boarding services as well. This time he will stay at a much better place though. They have many types of rooms and I've booked a "Suite" for him. It doesn't have any metal gates and it even has a TV. I feel so bad that I have to board him, but I really don't have a choice. It will only be for one night and one whole day. Léon is an American Pit Bull Terrier and weighs 80lbs. He's so loving and playful and has never ever shown any signs of aggression. He also gets along well with other dogs and even strangers. I work from home so I'm always with him. Now he's older than that one time I boarded him, but I know he's going to freak out. What can I do? He's so big and strong that I know meds won't help, and I don't think that's safe anyways. I need helpful advise from anyone who has experienced a similar situation with their big dog, or even suggestions from anyone who knows something... thanks!

However as I would like a lot of variety, in my tank I would prefer 5. Would this be ok as I have or plan to have other tetra i.e. rummy nose, flame and more? Would the presents of other small tetra comfort them? Keeping in mind the largest fish is a butterfly cichlid, reaching an absolute maximum of 7cm.  So basically my question is this, instead of buying 10 neon tetra would 5 be ok in the presents of other tetra and no large intimidating fish?    Thank you very much.

Anyways, she's in a tank alone (so none of the other fish will hurt the babies).

20090203141523AAu7mFv	Pets;Dogs	Bored dogs at home-destructive?	We have two dogs-a 2 1/2 year old Boxer and a 3 year old shepard mix.  They have had the run of the house for about 1 1/2 years now.  The shepard has always been out of a kennel and the Boxer has been roaming for about 1 1/2 years.  They play all the time all day.  Recently we have been noticing shoes being pulled into the living room and they have also ate 5 rugs this winter.  The first one had been sitting there for 3 years.  Why all of a sudden?  Our schedules have not changed at all.  They are only left in the house by themselves for 4 hours at a time.  Any time we give them toys of any type-they destroy them in minutes-literally minutes.  So we decided to videotape them to see which one was the instigator-well it was our little turkey the boxer.  What could have caused them to all of a sudden start destroying things?  We have to punish them when we get home and find chewed up items, but I don't know how else we can get them to stop chewing things.  I am also not going to put every single item in my house so they can't get to them-it would take 5 hours to do that everyday.  Plus they are 3 years old-they should know the routine by now.  Any help???
20090203141548AAUb4XT	Pets;Cats	Sick One Year Old Kitten?	About 11 months ago, we got a new kitten, and she just recently turned on year old. Sunday morning, we had accidentally left her out all night (she's strictly an inside house cat, BTW), and she had gotten into some Fudge Rounds. I had just woken up and one package was completely open, with a Fudge Round on the other side of the kitchen. Like I said, I had just woken up, so I don't really remember if there was chunk missing from it or what, but anyway, she was doing fine throughout the whole day. She acted like normal, and we put her in her cage on Sunday night. The next morning, she had had a bowel movement in her cage, and we let her out, and she didn't act right. She went into the kitchen, threw up, got a drink of water, and then jumped on top of the kitchen chairs and slept until we had to leave for school/work and we put her in her cage, where she had made another bowel movement in. This time, it didn't look right. It was a mixture between soft and hard. That night, she had thrown up twice, both had a little bit of a pink/yellow tint to them, and then she had two bowel movements on the kitchen floor and they were extremely watery. One even looked like it had blood in it. Which, I barely thought about since she has had blood in her stool before, and it never bothered her, it just seemed like a normal type of thing for her. BTW, her three siblings died within months of being born. She then started going to the litter box to make bowel movements, but it was still extremely runny and watery, but she stopped vomiting. After last night, I haven't seen her make a bowel movement at all, nor throw up, but she still occasionally takes a drink of water, which is good so she doesn't dehydrate, but she still refuses to eat. She'll also stretch and want to be petted a bit now before falling asleep, but she still looks week, and it scares me that she hasn't had a bowel movement in a while. We've already decided to take her up to the vet if she doesn't get better by tomorrow.

Why is the old dod dog acting like this?? It makes me want to drop her off somewhere and tell my husband she ran away.

20090203142308AA8ZVxa	Pets;Dogs	For All border collie trainers (puppy) please help?	I have had my tri merle collie for a week now. He is nearly 11 weeks old.  I have three daughters twin at five and a six year old, and a little boy 11 months.  My husband and i both have had dogs in the past and always been quite successful in training but we are now stuck in what to do next.  Our new little friend has decided he will mouth and bite at any opportunity he can get. we have tried yelping and pushing hand in to mouth ( not to be cruel) and this has always worked in the past, this time it isn't. The girls are used to dogs and never left unattended so we know they haven't egged the puppy on, to cause this reaction.  I know collies are renowned for this but i would love some suggestion as to how we can make the biting and mouthing stop. This dog is not stupid he is sitting, lying down and even recall is all 80% achievable.  I hope someone can help.

My dad just came home with two mice for my baby sister,but as usual I get left to take care of any pets we have,which I enjoy.But my dad didn't buy anything for them except one of the portable fish tanks that are about 30cm high and 20cm in width,some food and some bedding.I improvised and used a lego bathtub as a water dish,but that's all we have for them.I've asked my dad to take them back but my sister pestered him to buy them so no chance there.The mice include a male and female who look fairly young,my dad says that at that age they wouldn't need stuff like wheels and toys but I don't think that true.We have two cats who have killed mice and hamsters we've owned in the past so my dad told me to put the tank in a cupboard which I did,but I don't think that's such a good idea.Is it?And I've tried explaining to my dad that when they reproduce we won't have space for them but he just waves all that crap away saying that it'll be ages before that happens.I feel really sorry for the two but I can't say anything to my dad to make him do anything.Is it alright for them to be living like this?      Help is REALLY appreciated.

I really hate it when people immediately assume that this is the case. Anyway, so my kitten is 3 months and 12 days of age and he only poops while standing . i asked my vet if he's constipated but he says he's not . He normally poops everyday at 1:30 pm but he didn't poop at all today. is that normal ?      Do you think it's because of the lack of exercise ? I haven't been playing with him for a 2 days now because my parents who i haven't seen since august are visiting for a week and they never visited me in the UK. And i kinna don't have the time to spend as much quality time as i would wish. But i always make sure there's plenty of fresh water and food available for him .         Please help      Thanks

20090203144611AAceWjP	Pets;Dogs	I recently took in a stray dog, I think she might be pregnant?	Recently (about a month ago) I took in a stray dog. She's a female Irish Setter mix. She's very loving, playful and energetic. However, I've noticed over the past week or so that she has been expanding in the stomach area, as well as her nipples are "dropping". No milk can be expressed from them yet but, they have dropped and seem to be growing in size. Her stomach also feels harder (like a pregnant woman's stomach). All of this has lead me to do some research, and I've come to the conclusion that I believe she is pregnant, even to go as far to say she's about 5 weeks pregnant. I'd also like to add she's not very lethargic, although when she's indoors all she wants to do is lay on the couch and sleep. So I was just wondering if anyone could possibly confirm this for me (at least to the best of their abilities). Below I've added some photo links of her, that I took today! If any could help me out and tell me the likely-hood of her being pregnant, and if so about how far along she is, and when should I expect to her to give birth. On a side not, I'm very well aware of a dog's gestation period, it typically runs between 60-63 days. Here are the links to her photos taken today (Feb. 03, 2008):       http://i256.photobucket.com/albums/hh196...        http://i256.photobucket.com/albums/hh196...       Thanks Again!

20090203144842AAP6YU8	Pets;Dogs	Older Dog Aggression Toward New Puppy?	We have a 10 year old Doberman mix and a 6 year old Black Lab. Both are males and neutered. They have had a few fights over the past 3 years. We believe they were over dominance. Yesterday, we got a new puppy for our son. We introduced them by placing the puppy behind a baby gate in a half bath. We let each dog come in and greet him. The lab immediately started to growl and his hair was standing up. I held the puppy for a little bit while they checked each other out, but they didn't spend any time together. The puppy spent the night in a kennel and the other dogs slept on their dog beds in our master bedroom. This morning, I let the older dogs greet the puppy again while I held him. They seemed okay, so I put the puppy on the ground. When he started smelling the lab, the lab started growling and then tried to bite the puppy. I scooped him up and called the vet. She suggested putting a muzzle on the lab and petting and giving treats while the puppy was around. He is still growling and his hair is standing up. He growled at me when I tried to comfort him. The doberman laid into him and the two of them got into a small fight. Because the lab was muzzled, it obviously was short. I have put the two older dogs in their kennels and now I am at a lose as to what I should do to make this easier. When the lab got into his kennel, he was able to get the strap of the muzzle over his ear and got it off. It fits correctly, but I am not sure I can keep it on him. Any ideas or suggestions to make this easier?

20090203145920AA9WHiA	Pets;Cats	Tomorrow is the big day plz help me get ready for it....it is my cats last chance or she'll be in a shelter!!!?	I am sorry it is so long, but you have to read all of it or else you wont answer my question right.         So to sum it up. Three months ago I found a cat outside our house. My mom is allergic so I convinced my mom to let me keep her until I found a new home for her. She was some one's cat because she is fixed and is declawed in the front but I couldnt find the owners. I asked all my friends and my dad helped out by asking his co-workers, but no one wanted a cat with this economy. My mom is frustrated that we still have the cat in our basement, so she said if i dont find a home for her soon she is going to a no-kill shelter. But I dont want her to go to a shelter because she has gone through enough. I wanted her to go to my home to another home no shelter imbetween. I finally found some one that actually wants a cat. He is one of my guy friends at school that I never thought of asking. (ps not a boyfriend just a boy that is a friend) He is a huge cat lover and this will be the best home possible for her the only problem is: that they already have a cat. And tomorrow I am bringing my cat to his house to have my cat and his cat meet. They have to get along or else that cant have her. I asked my friend what getting along meant. And he said getting along meant: no fighting or hissing at each other. But isnt that what all adult cats do to each other when they meet each other unless they have been together since kittens?      And if this doesnt work out my cat will have to go to the shelter and I will fell so guilty about that. Because I will never find out who is her new owner or how long she will be at the shelter or what. And it would be the last time I saw her =[. I would not be able to live happily  knowing that. So what can in my power to make sure no fights or hissing happens.       How should I have the cats meet?       If they seem to get along, and they are going to keep the cat, how long will it take for my cat to get adjusted there and get back to her normal self?      My friend's cat is a boy and mine is a girl, will that make them get along better or worst?      If they do end up keeping her, should they keep her in a confined room until she adjusts?      When I had to go to my grandparents house last minute during christmas, I HAD to leave my cat at my friends house (because it was christmas break and who wants to drive to someone elses house 2x a day to check on a friend's cat) And she got more scared and tramatized than I thought she would, and she was a little devil at there house. She bit them and even made one of them bleed and hid the whole time. But when we came back and brought her home she acted normal and you would never guess she had a bad time. So I am guessing she will act the same way. I am afraid that will make them give her back to us. So how do we explain that it will take some time before she gets back to normal because she has been though alot and she is not a dog who you can drop at a person's house and not be tramatized? (sorry it was so long)

I should add that all the cats are neutered males.      We thought it was a medical condition at first because I saw blood in the urine, and then I caught Buffy peeing in his bed. We took him to the vet and got him treated. But both of them are still spraying!! Which makes me think it's a behavioural problem.      We know it's only those two because when we went on vacation we took Muffy, Buffy, and another cat (Muffy terrorizes him, and he stays in my sister's room all the time, so it's not him) to the boarding house, and the others stayed at home. While we were gone, there was no pee, but as soon as we brought them home they started spraying again!      We have tried spraying water at them, yelling at them (I know this isn't a proper form of punishment, but shooting them with water doesn't work). We have tried several repellents, including vinegar, and it doesn't work. Well actually it does, usually, but then they just find somewhere new to go and pee. Like a few nights ago, I sprayed repellent on the wall upstairs, so one of them jumped up onto a high cabinet in the basement, where they NEVER go, and sprayed there!      And then we spend so much time cleaning up cat pee. We have a black light to find stains and we use an enzyme cleaner to clean them up. But the cleaning has become a constant thing. I have to clean urine almost every day, sometimes several times a day. We even had to rip out the carpet on the main floor and put in hardwood flooring, since steam cleaning wasn't working because so much urine had gotten into the carpet and padding and even the wood underneath that.      They seem to spray the most during the night, and we're so tired of all this that we're considering building a cage with food and litter for them to stay in during the night.      Seriously, I am at my wits' end, I have no idea what to do, or how to stop them from spraying all over the place. Please, please, please if anyone has any advice, or some solution to this, I would really really appreciate it. Thanks.

20090203150742AA52l8c	Pets;Dogs	Dog sick? frequent urination, constantly thirsty, unusual behavior?	My dog is about 4 or 5 years old, female, spayed,    shih-tzu/ Pekingese mix.      She has been drinking water constantly, and alot at once. This has been going on for the past week or two.   Today I noticed very frequent urination, she was out for about 3 minutes and must have squatted around 7 or 8 times. We have around 3 inches of snow so the dogs are usually out and right back in because of the cold. She doesn't mark territory or anything like that.      Unusual behavior: She has been scooting her butt across the floor the past few days, so my first thought was worms. I checked her stools and it isn't that.    Today she pooped on the floor right in front of me about five feet away, which is very unlike her. She rarely goes to the bathroom on the floor, and the times she has she hid somewhere because she knows it's wrong. She looked right at me before doing it today.    Her stools looked normal; no blood; moist but not runny, etc.       anyone know what's going on?   Does this sound like she's just sick or more like a disease? I had an old english sheepdog die of liver disease (hepatitis) and I'm very cautious now and I'm worried these might be symptoms of something serious.      *She is well taken care of, well fed, etc... It's definatly unrelated to attention and care.
20090203141603AALXT7a	Pets;Cats	My cat broke its leg what should i do?!?	i have a stray cat about a year old and i let it outside a lot of times. yesterday it came in limping and went straight to its bed and started crying. I think it broke its leg but i tried to take it to the vet but it wouldnt get in a cage. when i got home today it wasnt crying and it didnt sound like it was in pain but hes just sleeping under the bed. I read somewhere that cats know how to heal themselves so is going to the vet necessary?
