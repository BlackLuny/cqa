20090308032125AA9LnQw	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	What to do when the level of discussions in the office is low?	And I mean really low. At first, I said what I thought. Now, I only intervene gently if I see that they misunderstood stuff in a serious way. For the rest, I shut up and keep working. The truth is I am less conventional than some of my coworkers: I traveled a lot, tried many things, met people from various backgrounds, volunteered and so on. I follow world & major national news, listen to talk-shows and know about local cultural events. One colleague doesn't follow the news at all & another sometimes listens to the radio news, but the lack of information doesn't stop them from talking. I don't wanna seem superior or like I am showing off. They are generally curious of what I think, but the gap between how we see things is huge and I just don't wanna accentuate that.

We are spending every night together but then he has to sneak downstairs the next day, She might already have figured it out, as we are not exactly 'quiet' (aherm) sometimes. How should I broach the subject, or is it none of her business anyway as long as we are paying the rent etc? What should we do if she is uncomfortable with the situation? We both love living here and don't want to have to move out, and we get on with our landlady but not sure how she'd feel about this!

20090308074842AAcIDgO	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	What should I do- I feel like a hypocrite - not standing up to the bullies?	I work as a waitress in this fancy restaurant.My work is really cliquey... it's like one of those American High school films. I've only been working here for about two months and i was 'lucky enough' to not be one of the people that gets bullied. Everyone is really nice to me but the way they treat some of the other people is horrible! They really pick on people. There was this one girl who they just made fun of and told her she was ugly and stupid until she cried and eventually left. One of the waitresses threw away one of the other staffs handbag and then denied all knowledge. They just constantly pick on a few people. It's really nasty. I feel like I should stand up for people but I don't want them to turn on me. I really hate working there but the money is really good (I make about ￡500 a week in tips + credit card grats {about 150 per week} and wages [about ￡250 - ￡300 per week} ) so I don't want to leave.      I just feel really guilty about not sticking up for people. The management are just as bad. The GM picks on people too and the other manager is really nice to people but she doesn't say anything about they way people are treated by other staff.      Should I stick up for people or just try and ignore it. I'm not really sure what to do. I feel like a hypocrite.. I wear this 'W.W.J.D' bracelet (what would Jesus do) and I know Jesus wouldn't just stand there and say nothing while people are being bullied. I don't want to get picked on myself though for standing up for them.      Last night I went into the staff room and one of the waitresses was crying and when I asked her if she was okay she was like "yeah I just hate the way people talk to me in here - You're really nice and so is Sarah (another waitress) but everyone else is horrible"      I don't even think me standing up for them would stop the bullying but it might make them feel better to know someone is on their side.      I don't know what I should do.

I love theater and writing, so I have always wanted to be a theater critic. I just completed a Pharmacy Tech class so that I could have a good paying job while in college. A combination of this class and the recession has really made me think about whether studying journalism and theater would be a smart move. I really want to live in NYC no matter what job I have... and I am well aware of how expensive it is to live there. That is why I am stressing about a career choice.       I was thinking about going into nursing and creative writing instead, but its kind of heartbreaking to see my dream of being a theater critic be tossed away. I want to be one badly, but I grew up without a lot of money and I refuse to live that way once I move out. Any advice on what I should do??

Ok, so we were looking in the paper and all sorts of things from the area we want to move to and we came across one or two foreclosure homes that were like $16,000/17,000 or so, 5% down. These are both the size we want and seem to be in the perfect place. Convenient to the city, but not actually within the limits, etc. Does this sound like a scam or a good deal? Should we go for it? What's been your experience with buying foreclosure homes? We've never owned our own home but we want to move and would rather own than rent, because we can't find anything the size we need for less than $900 a month, and even that would be a little cramped, just manageable. I just want real people's experiences and advice and all that on this. Thanks!

My husband and I bought a small house 8 years ago when we got married. It was great for the two of us. Now there is 5 of us. We have outgrown it BIG TIME. Here is the problem. The housing market in Michigan has TANKED!!!! We tried to sell our house for two years but did not accept any offers because we would have taken a check to closing and we didn't have any money to do that. NOW...we owe  more on our mortgage than what we can sell it for. What would you do? I want to sell the house anyway we can, maybe a short sale, maybe use money from our 401 K to pay the short (although that is not the best option, I know...)    We have excellent credit and do not want to jeopardize it.  However we need to get out of this small house . What would YOU do?

The owner took the future tenants through and?	contacted the office and told us to put these certain people into his rental house.  So when the rental lady got the applications she didnt get a credit check because he had already advised her he wanted them in.  We put them in then sold our rent roll and that gentleman decided to do his rental himself, 2 months later he contacted us and told us they had paid no rent and could we fix the problem for him so we did and they kept getting behind in the end we had to go to court to remove these tenants.  They left the house very dirty with alot of garbage and the carpet was damaged.  The landlord has decided to sue us for putting the tenants in his property.  Would he be likely to win or lose this case in court.  Because he did tell the company to put these tenants in but it was a verbal conversation and there is no proof other then what 2 people remember from the office.  Any feedback would be appreciated

After all posting is complete on July 31, the company’s Cash account has a $26,193 debit balance,   but its July bank statement shows a $28,020 cash balance.   b. Check No. 3031 for $1,380 and Check No. 3040 for $552 were outstanding on the June 30 bank   reconciliation. Check No. 3040 is listed with the July canceled checks, but Check No. 3031 is   not. Also, Check No. 3065 for $336 and Check No. 3069 for $2,148, both written in July, are not   among the canceled checks on the July 31 statement.   c. In comparing the canceled checks on the bank statement with the entries in the accounting records,   it is found that Check No. 3056 for July rent was correctly written and drawn for $1,250 but was   erroneously entered in the accounting records as $1,230.   d. A credit memorandum enclosed with the July bank statement indicates the bank collected $9,000   cash on a noninterest-bearing note for Clark, deducted a $45 collection fee, and credited the remainder   to its account. Clark had not recorded this event before receiving the statement.   e. A debit memorandum for $805 lists a $795 NSF check plus a $10 NSF charge. The check had   been received from a customer, Jim Shaw. Clark has not yet recorded this check as NSF.   f. Enclosed with the July statement is a $15 debit memorandum for bank services. It has not yet   been recorded because no previous notification had been received.   g. Clark’s July 31 daily cash receipts of $10,152 were placed in the bank’s night depository on that   date, but do not appear on the July 31 bank statement.   Required   1. Prepare the bank reconciliation for this company as of July 31, 2005.   2. Prepare the journal entries necessary to bring the company’s book balance of cash into conformity   with the reconciled cash balance as of July 31, 2005.   Analysis Component   3. Assume that the July 31, 2005, bank reconciliation for this company is prepared and some items   are treated incorrectly. For each of the following errors, explain the effect of the error on (i) the   adjusted bank statement cash balance and (ii) the adjusted cash account book balance.   a. The company’s unadjusted cash account balance of $26,193 is listed on the reconciliation as   $26,139.   b. The bank’s collection of the $9,000 note less the $45 collection fee is added to the bank statement   cash balance on the reconciliation.

20090308090019AAzg8Z1	Business & Finance;Small Business	My husband does handyman work & I do organizing, how can we structure our business to make enough money?	We are not very educated but good at what we do. We need a lot of money per month. We had hospital bills that put us in debt then we borrowed money to pay out bills. Our son passed away so we have had some hard years. Now we want to start fresh & pay things off. So we have to structure what we do. We both need to make $2000 a month each. We get so scattered so are there any simple clear ways to go about doing this....we can get enough customers word of mouth which is what we prefer. We like knowing who we work for b/c we have had some people not pay us....so we are not worried about getting customers....actually with my organizing business I do have to reach out to new customers but I am looking for people who have clutter & large houses would be nice but that doesn't matter. Where do I begin to get this mess organized?

20090308084523AAAecJD	Business & Finance;Corporations	This recession/depression that we are in seems to be effecting everyone but?	just for curiosity do any of you work at a place that seems to be growing despite everything?  If so what type of place is it that you work at?  My husband works in the warehouse of a local health food/grocery store and he has seen the size of the orders that he loads out on the truck actually grow, at least a bit.  Another friend is a massage therapist and she is seeing an increase of business because she says more and more people are taking advantage of every penny they can squeeze out of their insurance.  She works inside of a chiropractors office.  So anyone else working in something that you see growing at this time?
