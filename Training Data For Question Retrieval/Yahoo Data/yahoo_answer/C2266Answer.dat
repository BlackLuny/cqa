If your not sure about any of them do a search for them on youtube.|`|PgFYPZg2aa	Just look up fallout wikia, or do expect someone to just prattle on forever on the exact location of twenty hard to reach places.|`|gBSxCUWIaa	Here's another bobblehead guide I found:    http://role-playing-video-games.suite101...
mTNz8GHGaa	You acquire the bow and arrows from the first temple, called the Woodfalll Temple.  The temple is located in the Southern Swamp area, but there are a few things you'll need to do (go into the Woods of Mystery and rescue a witch, take the boat cruise she offers, go through Deku Palace to find a man who will teach you how to use Magic Beans, and promise to rescue a monkey from the Deku Palace) before you can even enter the temple.  You also need to finish the first temple to be able to move on to the second temple.    If you have arrows, you can shoot them at the icicle that hangs atop the block of ice that prevents you from going forward.  In this area too, there are more sidequests that you must to do prepare yourself to enter the second temple, called Snowhead Temple.      Halfway through Snowhead Temple, you'll acquire the Fire Arrows.  At that point, you can go on with your quest to rescue Epona.    Note:  You won't be able to finish the Anju and Kafei quest simply by acquiring Epona.  You need many items to be able to finish the quest, and it's impossible to finish until you've at least completed the first two temples, and started on the sidequest that allows you to enter the third temple.     Here's a complete list of what you need to complete the Anju and Kafei questline.  Note that some items/masks are needed to be able to acquire other items.    1) Deku Mask  2) Kafei's Mask  3) Ability to use Magic Beans  4) Bow and arrows  5) Lens of Truth  6) Goron Mask  7) Fire Arrows  8) Ability to use Powder Kegs  9) Epona  10) Gibdo's Mask  11) Zora Mask  12) Hookshoot  13) Stone Mask    As you can see, the Anju and Kafei quest is a long one, and best left until you're partway through the game and have all the items.|`|jK7pklCKaa	you get fire arrows after you become a goron in the 2nd dungeon. i believe what you have to do is look for a giant icicle above the ice block in termina field and shoot it which then falls down and breaks the block of ice.    edit: after re-reading what you said it sounds like you dont have the normal bow at all, if thats the case you get it from the first dungeon.

tpQZrQFiaa	Get your combat level up and go into the wilderness :)|`|hoBREUGLaa	All of those answers make no sense. If your trying to go from 10 GP literally, the best thing that you can do is:     Kill low level monster for normal bones, they don't sell for ALOT, but they still make a good amount of profit for the time it takes to kill them.    After you make a bit of money you should invest it into ranging equipment, or meleeing armor and go to kill hill giants when you have 40+ range or around adamant armor. That's the best way in my opinion to make the 1.5 in free worlds.    As a member: Go to Falador and head west into the ladder to the dungeon. When you go through the dungeon you find druids, and if you kill them they can drop potential herbs ranging from prices of 500gp-7,000gp.|`|MejN4E8waa	wc-ing... mining.... fishing....|`|t8lzqwMoaa	Woodcutting Selling yews, Fishing Selling lobster and swordfish and probably the best is Runecrafting selling laws but you need to be a memeber for it.

QJduXC4Kaa	That's a nice passion but i don't think it qualifies as a hobby for the purpose of de-stressing you. You need a hobby that can keep your mind busy, like doing a puzzle, or gardening, or sewing, something more than just staring, because you can concentrate on your problems at the same time you stare at the clouds, so you need something more. But nice question.|`|zb9m72R8aa	Yes, i believe it does qualify as a Hobie As long as you enjoy it and it keeps stress off.  I also love getting on the roof and staring at the clouds and stars :)|`|rYNM67oyaa	I think if you do it through a telescope and can identify the constellations and name the stars.|`|cmQDZaQjaa	It could be a hobby.    I like looking at the stars sometimes too.  They are just so relaxing.  If you enjoy it then yes it could be a hobby.

You can see it this way: MR has got lots of cards which are not so easy to use..such as that gadget dragon and some gadgets..Yeah...if you need some gadgets, you can go for a MR.

MR is still a little too messy structured.|`|yzpU5fZJaa	dark emporer of course. dark emporer is a monarch/macro-removal deck. it is really good. if you want help on how to improve it, just e-mail me. i can make a nice monarch/macro-removal/oppression deck. in todayts game though, it's known as anti-meta. good luck.|`|2b7mPq78aa	de|`|DxS5CbG6aa	Depends on what you want to play ;) but probably dark emperor

6N3yjlXhaa	Start with a large piece of felt and then use Fabri-Tac to hold the letters in place.  Make those of felt also.    Felt does not fray and does not need a finished edge.    This can be found wherever fabric crafts are sold - http://www.beaconadhesives.com/cgfab.htm...|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	just plain ol canvas would work. Any kind of fabric, really!

AFbjjLocaa	You definitely have to try perfect world international. It's an Amazing game with 3D graphics. and, it's FREE!  here's the trailer:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1pnJ_x-o...    the trailer is in japanese but the game is english.  u can register here (it's free) and download the game (free)    www.perfectworld.com    hope u like it :)|`|hoBREUGLaa	It depends on the type of MMO that you like to play though, if your looking for a free FPS, you can try GunZ, but like all free MMO games people are able to buy premium items to enhance their character, GunZ has a minor difference if you pay real money though. Maplestory isn't a personal favorite, but like I said it depends on the type of game your trying to play.|`|ivg0lRUraa	Silk Road|`|1gPxnOXsaa	dofus!|`|FhRHWEbpaa	Maplestory...Its a download, but its free, unless you WANT to pay for it...Its really fun and it gets addicting...|`|lHMOD8uHaa	Maple Story is a great game if you don't mind side scrolling.  guild wars is a pretty game and is a blast to play.  I have played other mmo games but I think most of them had update your account to paying a monthly fee for added stuff so I am not even going to add them.  the creators of maple story have made another mmo that's more realistic looking; just click on the name of there company. there all free ... they also have a great Mario cart like game that's online.
i7ZArzliaa	Many of those items have to be earned or won.  As in winning Gold to buy those customizations, you have to play through the different game modes with each character to win more.  I've found that after winning the Dojos, I usually unlock a couple of new items for the character that I was using.    Anyway, hope this helps! Happy gaming!  (??)    Cheers,  Chris.
1gPxnOXsaa	that game's pathetic play something else like dofus man
EVjoCpjEaa	Are you definitely sure you have all the pieces there?    Have you decorated it with enough essence pieces?    Sorry can't help much more than that. If you're still stuck, I can try to get a screenshot of mine, but it won't be for another day or two.
FH0oIzjwaa	Orgrimmar (obviously), Crossroads, Splinter tree post are a couple.  Something to keep in mind is that whenever you get capital rep (Org, UC, SM, TB)  you get 1 fourth of spill over rep to each other city.  For example if you get 400 Org rep you also get 100 rep to each other city.  It isn't shown but its there.  So if you want the ambassador title then I would suggest hitting all the starting areas.  Hit Tirisfall Glades, Durotar and Eversong Woods.  There is a option where your find minerals/find herbs tab is that also lets you locate low level quest givers.  Take all the quests for the dungeons within the cities and go hit them.  If your at least level 60 you should have no trouble doing most of them solo.|`|qbzen2XYaa	I dont know Horde side, as i play alliance.  However, Most of your quests will generally give you a little credit for all the major factions.  so in your Case.... Any quest in the starting zone in Durotar is going to give you Ogrimmar rep.  Quests in the Barrens, and down in thousand Needles are probably all Ogrimmar rep as well..     Game Sites like thottbot, Wowhead, Wowwiki can usually tell you on the quests when you look them up how much rep reward you will get.    Also..  Do the World Events.  Such as the Elder's that is going on now.  For every elder you get 75 faction points for every major faction, and since there are close to 70 or so in the game, its a good 5000 Rep with all major factions.|`|npkLIKPUaa	Do the elder event for the lunar festival it gives you 75 rep for all the horde or alliance cities for each elder you find.    =-]
RJblCWqXaa	halo 3 all the way    gears suck     and wtf how can u not have played halo 3  and halo in live is still way better|`|ivg0lRUraa	GoW2|`|mOZfR8yhaa	Im a video game girl and halo 3 rocks!!! Better graphics and you can battle with your friends!!|`|cPeF163laa	Gears 2, the halo series is overrated imo, but i still like it, halo 3 is good if you wanna continue the story of MC and the UNSC and all, and also good for a few hours of gameplay but gears 2 is a very good choice, lengthy gameplay, superior graphics and effects, awesome sound and the followup of the original story.    i myself have both, and have played finish both of them, Gears of War 2 is definately a better choice.|`|1Amb5PHpaa	Get Gears of War 2, it has great multiplayer modes that will keep you playing forever! (I love the horde mode) It has like an infinite survival of the locust...I'd definitely get this game...    Halo 3 was a poorly made game in my opinion...Your better off with Gears of War 2!|`|mb3ooc3uaa	Have you played Halo 1 or 2, if so Halo3 will be a let down. I played Halo3 for 2 weeks after it was released, I got bored and quit playing it.

Halo 3 had awesome graphics in the game but it's a bit shorter and only first person. I love the 3rd person in gears. Depends what you like more in a game?|`|Xga0Y3Lhaa	To the girl erin%*& above me you can battle with your friends in gow 2 as well also i would recommend gow2 bcus a new halo game is being released this year so no real point in getting halo 3 then it being out of date a few months later|`|eeTJ60s0aa	Gears 2 if you need single player. Halo 3 if you need mutliplayer. GoW is really crap, people just run around hitting you in the face with their shotgun then shooting you, either that or they just hold B and rev their chainsaw... it requires almost 0 skill to be a good player at GoW.|`|75107d92736ad6fea72a78e30303fbdaaa	both are awesome games andi find it hard to decide, buy one and then the other, get the cheapest first and then buy the other as then it wont seem as long to get both games!|`|npkLIKPUaa	I suggest Gears of war 2
66dAMlktaa	guild wars, maple story, cabal online, etc...|`|eoqTXCGxaa	Man, there's plenty. Just Google "Free MMORPG"

mqzLOJUDaa	To first answerer: They will make because they want money and they made Pokemon game for Wii. They already made Pokemon Battle Revolution. It's really great  To second answerer: Don't say anything when you don't know anything. They already made Platinum  To third answerer: Don't answer just for points.    And now to the Question:  I think they will first make Generation II Pokemon games remake.  Generation V. Hmmm I think they will make one really really evil one.  I think poisontype legendary wasn't here yet. And then some good hearted Pokemon that want to stop him. Maybe pure Flying type or Water type.   I know I didn't answered to your Question about elements and I am sorry, but.... I just don't know. But Nintendo is fortunately, smarter than me and will think up something really cool.  Good luck with your playing|`|i8NZNgLPaa	Hard to say.

eNHGiEvGaa	You'll have to go south of Memphis a short ways into Mississippi.  Tunica is great, actually.  Technically, though, the casino area called "Tunica" is really Robinsonville, a short distance north of the Tunica which is the closest real town.    I'm fond of staying at and playing at the Grand Casino, but you can find a dozen casinos in the area.  Also nice are Binion's and Gold Strike.|`|GfLsOOZoaa	There are no casinos in tennessee! closest is in tuneica mississippi.|`|AA10726404	No such thing.  Tennessee is so anti-gambling they only recently got the lottery (I think in 2004).    The closest places near Tennessee to gamble is an off track horse betting place just on the board with Virginia.  A really crappy Indian casino a few hours into North Carolina (Cherokee).  And at the other end of the state there is Tunica, with various casinos.    Other than that there is Indiana, and Atlantic City, which is of course a long way away.|`|pOrwteQUaa	This post has been moved or deleted.

Kamehamehaaaaaaaaa!    3.Naruto(8/10)  Ultimate ninja series  Mainly Ultimate ninja storm  phenomenal visuals!    4.Mortal Kombat(7/10)  Mainly DC universe VS mortal kombat  Good fighting game but less gore than its predecessor.    5.Street fighter(6/10)  Mainly Street fighter IV  Classic fighting game with great graphic.    Hope u like it.  Peace!|`|X3XSNWBbaa	Fighting Games|`|5HeNp5tjaa	street fighter is a classic|`|bHvCi5UTaa	To be honest, I prefer the story of Dragon Ball and Street Fighter.  Mortal Kombat and the rest have weak, typical, unimaginative stories.  By the way Street Fighter 4 soon for PS3... Watch out!|`|zb9m72R8aa	i'd have to say;    1, Dragon ball z (if u like anime)  2, Street fighter  3, Mortal combat  4, Naruto   5, Sial kaliber

gkoOThQAaa	They almost started on the same path but now both have taken alternate routes.    Silent hill took the very creepy Bloody satanic road.  Resident evil now is more of a horror/action game, it's still scary but not like resident evil 1 or 2. It's much more action oriented now.    My choice goes with resident evil. The new one is right around the corner and it's one of the best looking games I have seen. But see what are your preferences and go for whichever you like.|`|nqcnylFpaa	resident evil series silent hill was good intel the 4th one then it went down hill from there|`|dsW9j8ZFaa	I'd have to say the best series is Resident Evil. Every game has been pretty good, with a few great games in there. RE5 looks amazing too.    The first Silent Hill (PSone) I think is the best game in both series. It's just so darn scary, but they haven't really done much since that game to push the genre the way RE has.    I'm definitely looking forward to RE5 more.|`|SkyCof72aa	silent hill homecoming is already out, resident evil is better|`|zb9m72R8aa	i would definitely recommend Resident evil,  Get that :)|`|R0KEbgJGaa	Silent hill 1-3 IS REALLY SCARY  Resident Evil 1 is ok...  Resident evil 2 and 3 is BORING, not scary at all  Silent hill 4 is DIFFERENT, but less scary and more action  Resident Evil 4 NOT SCARY at all, just full of matrix and ninja stuff  Resident evil 5 is the same as 4  Silent hill 5 is made by a different company, and I seen it, it's not as scary as Silent hill 1-4.    When it comes to storyline Silent hill is the best, espicially 2 and 4. When it comes to combat Resident evil is better.  When it comes to scary factor Silent hill wins.    BUT OVERALL THE SCARIEST GAME IS FATAL FRAME 2 MAN|`|udEeSYWqaa	resident evil 5 is the best game on PS3|`|uErmjXhGaa	Resident Evil is definitely gonna float everyones boat according to my opinion its really what your into tho...but ya resident evil highly recommended|`|07mhzMSUaa	I think I like Silent Hill Homecoming better because there's a lot of different type of monsters where Resident Evil just has zombies. And I like Silent Hill's story line better and the one part where he wakes up in the hospital was creepy...

Kqpqt69Vaa	yes you can make 2,3,4 or 5 items with invisibility or chameleon.your best bet is to go with chameleon because you can open doors or chests and you can even do battle and know one will see you.if you use invisibility as soon as you open something or swing your weapon you are visible again.hope this helps have fun great game.|`|wyNvKrQmaa	If you get really good at Magic, you can  enchant items that you wear to cause various ammounts of invisibilty.    Since you cant make 1 items 100% invisibilty, if you make 2 items 50% then they add up to 100%, or make 4 items 25%, or any other combination really :P.    I think this works although im not sure of the costs/magic levels involved.|`|ccM9uNcWaa	I'm unsure of constant effects but if you visit the alchemist in Imperial city then they offer potions that last up to 90 seconds.  I bought around 6 and still have them.  They give constant invisibility unless you attack or open a chest.

Hc8yfekcaa	It is possible that the person who told you that had poker confused with a game called Pinochle (pronounced pee-knuckle).  It is played with only cards 9 and above, but it's a totally different deck and you can't play poker with it.    Although... I haven't seen or heard of anyone playing Pinochle in years.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	The cards 9 and above are a euchre deck.   Poker,  you need the whole deck regardless of what variation you play.|`|106b0861b9e6921cff2d55a1208f8283aa	Not at all, its the same as online poker but with cards.|`|xP4fTaXjaa	I don't know where you heard this... it's totally wrong. You need a full pack of cards for poker.|`|YYFCPfaDaa	There are many different poker games. The classic tournament poker game (and on most internet sites) is Texas Hold Em. Other variations include Stud and Omaha. The rules are easily accessible on the internet. But all these games will use the entire pack, with three, 5 or 7 cards dealt to each player (depending on the game). There are other variations but I'm not aware of one involving a reduced deck.

cKLrhh1daa	It's probably you have installed too many programs in your laptop or there are viruses and spywares in it. Run an anti-virus and it'll swip off all the unwanted programs. If it's still slow then you will have to uninstall some of the programs.|`|sWKGUPziaa	It could be your the video driver. Have you updated it? It could also be the video card. Best place to ask is Radio Shack. The guys there are pretty smart. Did you disable unnecessary programs at start up? When there are lots of programs that are running at start up, it will make your games run in the background and freeze or crash. To disable unnecessary programs at start up, Click on Run. (It's in Start under All Programs/Accessories.) type in msconfig when the box pops up. Then click on the Start Up tab. There will be a list of all programs running at start up. They will be checked off. The only one that needs to be checked off (stays running or enabled) is your Security System. All other programs can be unchecked. (disabled.) After you've disabled all unnecessary programs except for the security system, click Apply. Then you will have to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.If the computer still freezes after that it might be your video card memory or video driver. (Or you can give Radio Shack a call and see what they say, too. :)|`|a6EEfOQTaa	I would check for viruses and spyware.

459JmuSxaa	Sometimes you have to do a little homework before ordering from an unknown site. I would suggest emailing the owner and asking some questions. You can ask his payment methods, if its western union or anything but credit cards and paypal, then don't order. NEVER send a western union payment to anyone you don't know, it screams fraud.  Ask what his inventory is like and you can even ask for a couple business references from past customers or dealers. If he provides references, check them out carefully.  If he is willing to send your item COD that would be beneficial because you will have your item before payment.  Just be careful when ordering online. You may wish to look at ebay first. They have a great system in place to help avoid fraud. The prices are better too.  Good luck, I hope that helps.|`|52apRUE6aa	Looks like one of those sites you get when you misspell something...

NEWbh3Plaa	Well I know of a game that is fun, but it is a drinking game.  Its called "I've never".  Its very easy to play, hilarious, and you learn a lot about your friends.    Pick someone to go first.  That person says something they have never done. Example, " I have never gone bungee jumping"  If anyone in the room has done this they take a drink.  If more than one person drinks they have to tell their story.  Everyone else votes on the best story and that person goes next.  If no one drinks then the person sitting to the right of the original person goes next.    We play it sometimes when I have a big crowd, its always fun!|`|eYxAMRwPaa	why don't you spend the money for alcohol on something else.. like going to a movie, bowling, laser tag, massages together, a nice dinner... if you want to do something different.. then do something different.

qMwjrQbOaa	Short time limits.     You must be an expert or must depend on some blind moves.|`|2VbgWMzmaa	for me short time limits is harder. this is because i usually think about my plays very long because i am always thinking of how what i play will affect the next move and the move after that and the move after that, i create scenarios in my head of what i would do and what their most probable move would be, i formulate several scenarios, and i make the move that goes with the best scenario. this usually takes 1 minutes or longer if im in a tight game, that is why i preffer long games and am much better at them|`|UY6c7DG8aa	a)  Going to long timed tournaments is really tiring, once i sit on the table, shake hands, record, i rarely leave my seat, and sitting there for hours is just really really tiring. 5 rounds is bad enough, and tournaments are usually finish in 2 or 3 days, which means 2-3 games a day, if it's long games, man what a torture. I don't know about you guys but on the last few games i just can't think properly without taking a walk or something. Same goes with other players too, they get tired after a while. But if you are a player who has loads of endurance, then longer time means nothing. that's why Kasprov took gym lessons, to improve endurance HAHA.|`|3m0elHd6aa	a ) long time limits because you could start to lose your nerve|`|mxNH9tyCaa	i Enjoy speed chess. it gets you mind thinking fast. the slow slow games are just tedious|`|Q11YuqKkaa	I would go for increments as being the harder game. All though your opponent SOMETIMES has less time to think than in a long time limit game , he has less of a chance to lose on time.     It is more difficult to plan your time ahead with increments: One stage your up by 10min, your opponent has less than 2min left, the next thing you are less than five and your opponent has 6...real nifty.    My most difficult games was with increments. But I also prefer it to the others. Ap part from being more interesting as well, there is also the fact that the annoying Article 10.2 of the FIDE laws (2min rule), that causes so much confusion, is not applicable when using increments.    Though an easier game to accommodate, especially for the arbiters :) the game itself, in my opinion, is way tougher.|`|VDiLab9caa	Long time limits are the hardest because your opponent has that much more time to work out the tactics.  The strategy of the game is akin to the combination with the tactics as the knockout blow.  More time = the deeper the combination you need to fool him/her.

Age doesn't always equal value.  They made over 100 Million of these in Philadelphia alone that year.  If there is a mint mark on the back, a small letter will be located on the right side of the building, then it was made in Denver (D) or San Francisco (S).

6152e7dd6d7ed08ba0772462efe95df4aa	Call of Duty 6, which has not been officially named yet despite the rumors, will be a complete stand-alone game... not an add-on. It may even be a completely different approach to the CoD series. There are plenty of rumors surrounding the game, including a futurist combat game used weapons not yet fully out of developement or fielded, to a full blown sci-fi themed game. That of course doesn't mean aliens necessarily. It could be some sort of post apocalyptic future.    The only available and confirmed facts are these: Release date - sometime in Q4 of 2009... most likely mid-autumn. Infinity Ward is developing the game, which should make CoD 4 fans happy. And it is a full stand-alone game, although at this point it's only a sequel to CoD 4 in that Infinity Ward is the developer.    I don't see any of this as a reason to miss out on CoD 4... GO GIT IT! :)|`|SEwqwjPkaa	Modern Warfare 2 will be a "SEQUEL" to the original COD 4.  It's not an add-on or other form of content but an entirely new game.

6152e7dd6d7ed08ba0772462efe95df4aa	While it has been confirmed for a Q4 2009 release, there is no release date, nor has it been actually titled 'Modern Warefare 2'.     There are rumors going around the web that it will actually take place in the future (not outer space with aliens, but a closer more realistic depictions of the future; weapons that are currently in developement and theoretical weapons... that sort of thing), but nothing has been confirmed beyond the fact that the game is in developement and Infinity Ward is at the helm of the project.|`|gnUX1aB1aa	As of the 29th of January 2009 there is no official release date however the developers of Call Of Duty:Modern Warfare 2 (Infinity Ward) have said that the game will be released around autumn time/fall time.

jJHNm8UIaa	All of the wood you mention and many others can be used but pine is probably the best choice since it is readly available and easy to work with. I make cars out of many kinds of wood but use pine the most. You can see my cars at http://vmwood.com|`|enBBnABnaa	bass wood, lightweight.. easy to carve.. it's found in most wood stores that carry carving woods.  a little expensive, but not for a piece that small...     Boy Scout rally? lol  my son made one of those!|`|UtBb83Aeaa	Pine is frequently used for such cars (some are even called "pine cars" and "pine racers"). Pine is a soft wood that is reliatively easy to cut, carve, sand and shape. Birch is a harder wood and so it is more difficult to shape with simple hand tools.    However, you might consider balsa wood instead, which you can get in blocks at most craft stores like Michaels. It is much softer than pine, so it's even easier to shape, and because it is very lightweight, it may be more suitable for a rubber band powered car.

They give a quick neat seam, and when used on stretchy fabrics, allows the seam to stretch with the fabric. This is normally a 4 thread overlocker. You can use a 3 tread overlocker to overlock the edges of fabric that will frey easily.  Some overlockers have up to 6 threads which will overlock and sew a seam on woven fabrics.    A 4 thread overlocker can also be adjusted to give a thin overlocked edge to a garment but you only use 3 threads.

2f47a7fb887504f90dec5b605dd5f63baa	the graphics aren't the best since they're integrated.  here are the requirements from the official site:  Windows Vista (Service Pack 1)   2.4 GHz P4 processor or equivalent   1.5 GB RAM   At least 6.5 GB of hard drive space with at least 1 GB additional space for custom content   128 MB Video Card with support for Pixel Shader 2.0     For computers using built-in graphics chipsets, the game requires at least:   Intel Integrated Chipset, GMA X3000 or above.   2.6 GHz Pentium D CPU, or 1.8 GHz Core 2 Duo, or equivalent   0.5 GB additional RAM    you have to go by the last paragraph since the graphics are integrated. so your processor is slightly faster than the 2.6ghz pentium d, u have the minimum amount of ram (2gb) and i would actually say your graphics are weaker than the gma x3000, but it does have pixel shader 2.0 so it might work. don't expect high quality gaming. i recommend you get a new video card if possible|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	it should be|`|ivg0lRUraa	That should be fine to run it|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	read the sims 3 website under news.|`|npkLIKPUaa	Yes itll run|`|PK4EJTq3aa	Check out srtest.com for a complete run-down on how your computer will handle the game.|`|rQYL9HgOaa	Yes you are over the demanded system requirements.  besdies the RAM.

FH0oIzjwaa	I say World Of Warcraft.  Runescape and everquest are dead.  There is the downside of having to pay the monthly fee to play WoW but think about it like this:  for most americans its $15 a month.  Break it down and if you just get 1 less coke out of the vending machine a day you all ready paid for it.    Come over to the Whisper wind server on the horde side and ill help with any game questions you have.  Theres a lot to take in at first but once you get the basics down the rest is easy.  If your fast at leveling I can even get you into raids with my guild.  My name is Aganor if you decide to join up.      If you do get WoW you should buy the battle chest first with the original game and the first expansion The Burning Crusade.  That will enable you to play the 2 extra races added.  When your higher level then you can go get the latest expansion that came out a few months ago The Wrath Of The Lich King.    As far as connecting with other players there are voice options in the game and several guilds use a outside cleint to chat called Vent.  My guild The Legion Of Blood has over 60 members and we are allied with another guild that has somewhere around 75...I think.  Anyways Good Luck with your choice and happy gameing.|`|lW8wJAHMaa	u check out everquest.com for everquest but u need to download it around 320MB.(for free MMORPG)  even runescape is good taking in mind that its a free MMORPG    WoW is the best but u need to pay for it . 10$ per month for silver users and 25$ for gold users|`|TEaVbinlaa	Yes world of WarCRACK or i mean warcraft. its very addicting. its a quick way to completly waste a day with out even noticing.

Both have to be purchased and have a monthly subscription fee.

I don't know much about other types of games though :P|`|h9aNv6PDaa	Hey! First, online gaming rocks! If you haven't done it before I think you'll like it!     What kind of games do you like?

Online games have me addicted and they just suck the time away but they are fun...  So if you looking for a good online game you will need to download it. Then the question is are you willing to pay for the game.  If not try this game  cabal.ogplanet.com  its a free MMORPG and it has quite a lot of players playing. Its a fun game where you can do quests, join/create guilds, fight monster, and PvP (if you choose to, ppl cant kill you unless you accept PvP duel against them). Its kind of like WoW but free. If you do create an account on this game send me a msg on yahoo answers, and I will help you!

Since a game disc is fairly light, I suggest wrapping it in bubble wrap to prevent the disc from moving around inside the box during shipment.  The actual box should do the rest of the protection.|`|cmpQwGsfaa	Parcel post.|`|GD8wbIVXaa	Use Parcel Post, but make sure you have it in a protective casing.

DGhT0jNHaa	Well since your monitor runs at 1080p it won't play anything interlaced. It will simply upscale the 1080i display to a 1080p display to run it assuming you're using an hdmi cable (the playstation won't upscale if you're not). So you have nothing to worry about, it will look best at the higher resolution (i.e. 1080i).|`|yEyq2g1iaa	My friend's dad told me the answer, which turned out to be long and complicated, but I do remember that 1080p is the best resolution.  Here's an article if you want to read up on it:    http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_better...
t1DWcuSmaa	just keep it at the best durr, 1080p|`|iAIv62HXaa	Honestly, I can barely understand what you are saying. However, I think you should just set it to 720p for both. Graphics usually don't matter that badly. And besides, ps3 graphics own, so...
obPSaYf3aa	Basically bowling a 300 game is much more easier than getting a hole-in-one.      I experienced it only one time as a recreational golfer when I had a hole-in-one on a par 3 captured on a security camera when golfing at a course that was constantly vandalized in Colma, CA.  I used a 9 wood and hit it 190 yds. onto the green and it rolled into the hole a few yards further up hill.      As a professional bowler and member of the PBA, as well as an amateur bowler, I bowled 18 "300" games in sanctioned league/tournament play, non-sanctioned play and during practice.  Due to the advances in equipment, some lane conditions that will allow you to easily find a way to the pocket and ability to maintain muscle memory for a similar approach and release frame after frame, it looks like bowling a "300 game" is much more common than a "hole-in-one" in golf.  Golf is ever changing because it's in the outdoors and even though golfers have similar swings and speeds, temperature and equipment will not behave the same every time you go out to play.|`|rHhtn7plaa	bowling a 300 very hard to get all strikes ive got a hole in one in mini golf ( it was true luck the hole was in a mountain and the hole was at a curve in the mountain i couldn't even see it and went in it was intense) never played reg. golf but my boyfriend got a whole in one before its just luck.
IcEQcIWbaa	Yeah Dead rising is a great game on 360    Check this http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/d...  for its review!    I was surprised by this game!  Unique survival horror with fun gameplay!  Tons of stuff to use against horde of zombies!    As I know,The Wii version will be different from the 360 version.  -A new camera system implemented(over-the-shoulder camera)  -Game graphic will be reduced due to Wii limited capabilities.  -Photos taking will be removed.  -More save slot.  -Some bug about text in 360 version will be corrected.  -Countdown will be removed.    Peace!|`|d889ec36bb9adc89f3addb3dde100e23aa	The wii version isn't looking too good at this point, but I am hoping it'll shape up, so for now, I'd say 360 for sure, but wait until release day to hear how the wii version is doing|`|PK4EJTq3aa	The 360 version is a lot of fun and you can pick it up for cheap now. I would recommend checking it out :).|`|XhZ1cnbWaa	I really enjoyed the 360 version of Dead Rising, it is one of the better games on the console. That said, I don't really know much about the Wii version but I've heard it's not looking too great so if you could I'd buy it on 360.|`|yEyq2g1iaa	Dead Rising for the XBOX 360 was one of the best games I ever played. It was also the first game I got when I got my 360. The story and setting kind of resembled Dawn of the Dead, but I found it better. The graphics were top notch. The gameplay was great except when it came to using guns. Aiming was horrible. It was also funny which is a plus in a survival horror game. So if you want good times pick it up.
6152e7dd6d7ed08ba0772462efe95df4aa	Absolutely it could still happen. It's just now far less likely.    There have been improvements, and as long as the system is operated in the manner it should be the risk is far less. Don't cram your system into a tight unventilated space, and don't stack it on top of hot hometheater components. Placing it vertically in a secure and stable spot in your entertainment center allows the air to pass through the system. That's how I have mine.    In addition to the improvments in the system itself, Microsoft has also improved their warranty as well; 1 year 'bumper-to-bumper', and 3 year 'red ring' coverage.|`|k6CSa9caaa	yes you can|`|Q4686bQoaa	yes|`|XadHhxOSaa	yea ya can! and wot a c**t it is when it happens! 3 times ive had it!|`|js4bMLglaa	yes|`|PNx94axQaa	0.5 out of 10 people get the red ring of death with the elite. 3.3 out of ten people get the red of death if you have a premium xbox. but 5 out of 100 people is still to high!|`|1iPy5755aa	yeh you still can but only that the elite has a slimer chance of getting the 3 red rings same as the premium version.id get a ps3 because it dosen't have problems at all.|`|EjtuZHgNaa	yeah any xbox can get the 3 red rings of death its just when the xbox gets too hot and the processor lifts from the motherboard just dont block   your fans or vent holes|`|ESGIlaRIaa	If you really want to :-)    if you have then check out http://www.xbox360ringofdeath.info and get a guide to help you get rid of it

One of them creates shadows of everyone nearby that heal when they get close to the dragon.    You gotta remember these dragons were released something like a year before Burning Crusade, so they're pretty old!|`|vt2VS0lDaa	use the emerald dragon sword.

DY8YYluqaa	Oh trust me it is so worth it.    The Drums... they are amazing.. they feel tough(and will not break)  Songs are good... Truly worth the money if you have it. And as the drums are not released on their own... don't just buy the game on it's own (i made that mistake and now addicted to my friends drums).    Also if you get bored with the game ... somehow... the drums and guitar work on rock band and rock band 2.|`|SEwqwjPkaa	I too am a fan of the GH series.  I've owned them all including World Tour.  I also own Rockband 1 and 2.  In my opinion, World Tour is a much more user friendly game.  The drums are more realistic, the guitars are more comfortable and the track selection is hands down superior.  Don't get me wrong, Rock Band is nice but in the end, as per my preferences, GHWT has everything I like.  You may of course feel differently.  And remember, if it's price that's bothering you, try picking up the GHWT Wireless bundle for $50 or $60 and then buy the drum and mic kit online.  I've seen them for $100.  That's only $30 off but at least it's a little bit of a savings.  If you want to save even more, try getting the Rock Band drum kit instead of the GH kit.  It's compatible (lacking star power) and is only $20-$30 over at Amazon.  I know you're in Europe but surely the same can be had for close to the same price on your side of the pond...right?    Good luck...hope this helps!    Peace!  The Reverend|`|PK4EJTq3aa	Rock Band 2 is a better buy IMHO if you want a good full band game.|`|yEyq2g1iaa	Well I didn't buy the Complete Band Set but I did get the game itself, since I already had a guitar for it. I thought it was the best Guitar Hero game yet. Lots of good songs, though as usual in a GH game, there were songs I had never even heard of. I was also lucky enough to download the full Death Magnetic CD. So if you do get Guitar Hero World Tour, drop down more money for the Death Magnetic downloadable content!|`|vtt5sTqYaa	It depends on just how big of a fan of the game you are.  I really love Guitar Hero and I'm willing to spend that money when I have it.  But me and my nephew did recently get Rock Band 2 with all the peripherals and it was definitely worth it.  I'm sure World Tour will be the same.    If you're a really big fan of the game, I'd say get it.  If you're not that interested to pay so much money, then you can always get the guitar pack which is cheaper, but only comes with the one guitar.|`|lUzQfXM6aa	hell yea it is. its f**king awesome|`|AA10625444	I got the game and guitar for christmas this last year and have thoroughly enjoyed it so far.  I don't have Rockband so I can't compare the two, but being able to create your songs and stuff is also very cool.  I say go for it!|`|YjRkpIG4aa	I think the World Tour and the Aerosmith playlist are completely worthless, I liked Guitar Hero III the best and I liked Guitar Hero II as well. I also noticed the playlist is very similar to Rock Band 2 just like how Rock Band and Guitar Hero III's playlist were similar. If I was you I would try it out at like GameStop or Best Buy and decide that way.

iAIv62HXaa	Well...pvp stats are basically this=75 Attack, 99 strength, 99 Magic, 99 Ranged (not necessary, but helps), 40 defense. However, if you want to be a Dh pure, then you can train defense to 70 but NO MORE. For God Wars, I recommend just training all cb skills. You won't need magic. So basically...    75 Attk  99 Str  70 Rnged  70 Def  40 Magic (Although having a high magic level always helps.)    For pvping, you'll need loads of money...I'd say 100mil to start, since you'll want Ags and 99 mage, as well as tons of potions.|`|gSp59e88aa	Get your Attack and Strength up to level 50 or 40 then you will be able to kill things way faster and do loads of damages you can make up to 12 damage with rune swords.|`|YjRkpIG4aa	Str

oeCIzoF9aa	If it's cheaper, and the warranty hasn't been voided by anything.  Then, there's no problem.  There should be nothing to worry about.  PS3s don't break as easily as xbox 360s.  Mine broke 4 times!|`|s5IjyOygaa	yeah it should be okay. i'd be weary of buying a used 360, cuz of all they problems they have. but a used ps3 should be okay.|`|Z6ZM9p1waa	why not?|`|iAIv62HXaa	Sure, nothing's wrong with it, right?    Just make sure it's in good condition. You would hate to find a ps3 that doesn't work because someone messed around with it.|`|AU1UmLLTaa	i have a 360 and a ps3 and 360 is better|`|ew7aSKa8aa	I would buy one just make sure the person your gonna buy it from has a reliable source for it, if not get it off a retailer like gamestop most ps3 used there are refurbished and should work perfectly now i would reccomend buying a new one from a specialized electronics store like Best Buy since they not only offer a guarantee for it there but they will give u 2 years and replace it if it gets damaged
2LfMvxwBaa	Same way you'd use manual transmission in your car... (keep the engine in the power band)|`|GqTSa85daa	You always shift up for speed, and shift down when slowing.  Better because you can shift faster and at the proper rpm for max power, or to save fuel.  Only sucks when you have an open drink as you need both hands to drive (many wet laps before cup holders).|`|1f944e23d84bc1ff43ee93ad66a40f2eaa	You only lower the gear when you slow down. For exaple, when accelerating in a straight line, you would wait for it to redline before you shift up. But when you slow down, you want to shift down the most number of gears without redlining. So if you barely tap the breaks, you most likely will only shift down one gear, but if you slow down a lot, shift down two or even three depending on the transmission of the car. This allows for maximum acceleration. The car puts out the most power at exactly the redline, but then it can't go any faster, so you have to shift up. But if you slow down, you want the maximum RPMs possible for maximum acceleration.

s5IjyOygaa	nah, dude. they're two completely different stories. you'll enjoy them both.|`|SFmojHlRaa	call of duty 4 and 5 are a total different take on cod4 is a modern warefare game such as todays conflict and cod5 is a world war 2 game with japenese, americans, germans and russians the story plot does not even relate.|`|iAIv62HXaa	NO~Completely different, one is modern warfare while the other is in WW2. However, they run on the same engines. Also btw CoD4 is a better game than CoD5, but CoD5 has 2 player co-op. Your choice?|`|thCgYA5Jaa	they have absolutely nothingto do with each other but i do recommend playing both.    if you had to choose between the 2 though cod4 is a much better game. they runn on the same engine but COD4's combat feels more fluid and enjoyable.|`|QQyoPdV0aa	no COD:4 is based in modern day warfare and COD: WaW is based in ww2 like all the other COD games. i would recommend COD:4 though i thought it was a nice change of pace from all the old style war games. no germans no russians... well a few russians but nothing like the other games have. anywho to answer your question you dont need COD:4 to fully understand COD:WaW|`|yVWKiTwTaa	i dont own either of them either because first person shooters suck, especially ww2 ones, it is way overdone, how many times can we fight the same battles? any way cod4 is set in a modern setting i believe in Iraq, and cod5 goes back to (you guessed it) ww2. yeeeeaaahhhhhh, lets invade the beach at normandy, for like the ten millionth time on the ten millionth game!

8hU03XWyaa	they just came out with a new card, it is called chimeratech fortress dragon, i got it in my shonen jump magazine. trust me, you want to pay 6 dollars for the magazine so you can get this card! when cyber dragon and 1 or more of your morphtronic monsters are on the field you can send them to the graveyard, without polymerization, and special summon him. he has 1000 atk and def for each monster you used to summon him. best part is if your opponent has machines too, (like with DNA Surgery), you can send there machines to the graveyard as well and add more power to your fortress. well good luck.|`|Z1aNezpBaa	its a ok deck.

6N3yjlXhaa	All home embroidery machines work independently of the computer.    The computer comes into play when you want to download designs from the Internet or cd and send it to the machine.    For this, the embroidery machine has to accept direct connect (UBS cable that comes with the machine or USB flash drive that also comes with the machine).    There are also machines that accept a rewritable memory card that has been formatted for the machine and compatible writer box.      This method is becoming obsolete as the writer boxes are not compatible with Vista 64.    Brother and Babylock are user friendly and compatible with software programs you may want to purchase later on.    Pfaff is another option.    Buy the machine you like from the dealer you like and is able to provide lessons and support.    Many of the sewing machine companies have combo models - sewing and embroidery.|`|j0a1v9TZaa	Many the recent embroidery machines interface with computers.  Look at Bernina, Viking, Jamone/New Home.      Be sure to purchase from a source providing a trained service person and one that offers classes in how to use this to its potential.      Each companies web site has info for you and dealers nearby.|`|077KC51gaa	Hello, I have a Janome MC 1100 and a Kenmore Ergo Elite. Both are the same format JEF. and they both are sewing machines. I love both of my machines. The Janome MC1100 is the most advanced one I own. I can connect it directly to the computer, or I can use a jump flash USB stick, or whatever you want to call it, and can also use a ATA card. It is very simple to transfer designs, I have the Embird program to convert my designs to my format. All machines have their own software that allows you to download the converted designs to any of the above ways mentioned. I was a little scared of trying the embroidery part of my machines at first but once I started I can't stop...lol...ended up making me a small home based business out of all of my trial and errors. I hope this is helpful to you.|`|H2vAwPlTaa	I have been using a Viking embroidery machine for 7 years since I retired. It is wonderful. I started with a D1 (Designer 1) which required a floppy interface. The Designer SE has both a USB memory stick port for easy access to designs and a USB cable to hook directly to your PC. Recently they came out with a new machine which is incredibly expensive. I chose not to upgrade since I have all the functionality I need with my existing machine. The SE is now on sale because of the new machines and is about one third of its original cost. The hardware is guaranteed for life. One cost not mentioned and a surprise for most new users is that you need to purchase some type of software package unless you plan to buy all "shrinkwrapped" i.e. ready to use embroidery patterns. The software that is compatible with any machine is usually sold by the same company. It can often cost as much as the machine itself. Go to a reputable dealer and ask about both the machine and the software required so you get the big picture and the true costs. A good dealer will offer classes on both the software and the hardware. You can also shop the Internet once you know what is available. My dealer does not discriminate against individuals who have bought their machines from an individual, but some might charge a fee for classes if you did not buy the machine from them. Check that out. Good luck and enjoy.|`|veRFe87raa	I am just starting with machine embroidery.  I purchased a Singer Futura C-200.  It interfaces with my computer and allows many different options.  It has 2 hoop sizes and digitizing software.  I have been sewing for 50 years and have always had one or two Singer machines so I guess it was natural that I begin on a Singer, plus it was an economical choice for me.  I do not have a home embroidery business, nor do I plan to start one so I'm sure that my machine will last for quite some time.

Forces my man and your field is filled with samurai's you will be getting like 1000 points for each warrior plus all there great abilities. Trust me cause Dragons are hard to work with and this, this six samurai theme will go places. Finally is the six samurai's united card for every samurai you bring out it gains a counter so you get two on the field after using this, tribute it off and you got almost your hand replaced.
pcBmyGTZaa	They made the co-op play on Resistance 2 quite bad. The reason they didn't is because they are pushing people to go and play on the network rather than together in living rooms. It's really lame. If you look at most good racing games, they are 1 player and in order to race someone that isn't a computer, you need to connect online.

6152e7dd6d7ed08ba0772462efe95df4aa	Yes. It's not yet released, but it will be on the DS. See the link below for details. It will be released March 17 in North America. It actually looks far better than the original GTA, which had a top-down view. This game has actual 3-D graphics, with alterating view-point that seems to be mostly an overhead isometric (at an angle, basically) view. Yes, there is top-down as well, but even that looks better.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft...|`|75107d92736ad6fea72a78e30303fbdaaa	it's only coming out on the DS and buy it|`|yVWKiTwTaa	yes, i dont think it is released yet, it was in gameinformer mag last month. it will be for the nintendo DS and goes way back, it looks like the Original GTA game.

me36q49Qaa	My sister has been playing Sims since the first game came out, she's now 19 and nothing seems wrong with her. I think parents are very overprotective nowadays, but compared to other games, the Sims is one of the best games for kids to use as it's harmless and fun! I think it would be silly to presume that kids would do something were they to see it on a video game and i think you have every right to be playing it.|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	If they let you go to a public school, then they should let you play the Sims. I think schools are a lot worse than the Sims these days.    Sims are rated for mature content but it depends on how you stress it though. I don't think it's anything to worry about b/c kids are going to learn it eventually. I have issues with kids obsessing over games as it is but I'm not a parent. To each their own.|`|AhH4r4eBaa	Wow, your parents are strict! I played that game when I was 8!  They should be reasonable and let you play it.|`|npkLIKPUaa	I think its perfectly okay.  i let my 9 year old play it and with the 'woohoo' you really dont get to see anything.|`|5F1LMgclaa	there's nothing a 14-year-old wouldn't know about, really, a lot of young kids play it, no problem    the 16-year-old rating is too high in my opinion...it's a very nice game, much better than violent games, and it's suitable for kids younger than 16, my 9 year old sister is playing it right now    so, tell your parents not to worry, but it's their call, if they don't wanna let you play... =/|`|uErmjXhGaa	sims should def be available for you to play...there's no nudity involved ya you can do things inappropriate but you dont have to so i think yes you should be able to play this game

4He3bNO7aa	OK it *could* just be SL being antsy, so you need to do a few things first.    DON'T try changing your password yet. Make sure you are entering your details correctly and keep trying to log in. If after about an hour of trying you STILL can't get back in ...    Can you remember her name? It sounds like you got griefed with a banned weapon. If it helps, I got hit with one of those some time back by a a guy who is a known griefer.    Forget changing your password - you won't get back in until the allotted time she put on you to keep you out of SL is up. Could be a few hours - with me it was over a week.    What you DO need to so is to go to the SL website and try submitting a ticket to Linden Labs. Although I think it unlikely that her griefing tool has made it possible for her to get hold of your password to allow her to change it and steal your avatar, if you are still having trouble getting in, you need to make sure that Linden Labs are aware of the situation.    Regardless of what happens, when you DO get back in you need to file an abuse report against her. The device she used is grounds for her immediate expulsion from SL if they can catch her.

Angle Online,   Dream Of Mirror Online (was fun but so many people)  Maple Story  KungFu Master was kind of cool but the PVP got out of control.    Anyway hope that helps :)|`|1sw2XpvBaa	Lineage 2.  If you enjoyed wow but felt there was something missing, this is the game for you :) ive played wow for years and i still do play now :P but like only problem with lineage 2 is you need a pretty decent computer for best results. the game is MASSIVE and definitely worth looking into :)   the game looks amazing, and the game play is too. Id be playing it if i didn't play wow from start :P

There is infinite possibilities on what you look like, your race, your class, the armor you wear and even the quests that you do. There is no one person that is like another, and even if there was you would never see them because they are probably on a different server. WoW is a great game and it is not addicting if you manage your time well. I play WoW and still have straight A's. PICK WOW ! ! ! ! ! ! !!!!!!!!!!! ! ! ! ! ! ! !|`|npkLIKPUaa	Runescape has horrible graphics so hell no    IMO Wow is defiantly way better.|`|7kvTHzj0aa	WOW all the way. runescapes graphics are horrible and the map is very limiting, even though it may seem big.|`|8xVGuEDkaa	WoW is the worst game i ever played ever, I played for about two years cause it had a good concept i was just waiting for them to stop worrying about expansion and fix pvp. they never did so i threw the game in the blender. Runescape isnt much better, but there are better choices out there. DAOC, Warhammer, Eve, Many others, have a look before you decide on only 1 of 2 choices

pcBmyGTZaa	I'm pretty sure the region just determines whether you can play it on your console. If it's online then you should be able to connect to anyone in the world. I had a football match with a Mexican guy who kept shouting "Oley!"
pcBmyGTZaa	Gem One: This is an easy one. Go to the Imperial City Market District. Find the Mystique shop. He has one gem for sale. Four to go.    Gem's Two - Four: Your lock picking skills better be up to snuff now. Head to Arcane University. Best to go at night, you will be thieving. Go inside, and on the first floor there is a chest with three Gems inside. All are Grand gems, but I believe two of them are not empty. Take them all anyways. Its a level 5 lock, so youre going to have to work at it, but its worth the effort. Make sure no one sees you. Once you get it open, take them all.    Gem Five: Head to the Chorral Mage's Guild. Inside, there is a staircase, and display cases to the left and right. The one to the right looks tempting, three gems inside. None are grand though, save your picks. The one the left has one though. It's another level 5 lock, so good luck to you. Once you get this, you have five, but two probably aren't empty. No matter, the hard part should be over.    Gem Six: Head to the Bruma Mage's Guild now. Walk straight in and slightly to the left into their little shop. If the shopkeeper isn't there, wait for her. When she comes back, barter with her. She's got an empty gem. If you don't have money, you can try to pickpocket it off her, but I found it easier to just buy it.    Gem Seven: Head to the Cheydenhol Guild now. To your left and down the stairs, talk to the shopkeeper. Same as before, buy it, or try and pick it from her if you wish. Congradulations, you now have your five empties, and youre probably a pro at lock picking by now|`|Kqpqt69Vaa	you can do this two ways,you should be able to go to any mages guild and see the vendor there and they should have at least one grand soul gem each.so you can go to five different mages guilds to buy them or you can buy one grand soul gem and dupe it.open your inventory and click on a scroll that you have more than one of then go to the grand soul gem and drop it and you will get the same amount of gems as scrolls.hope this helps have fun great game.|`|YvNMUnR6aa	check the mages guilds you can usually buy them or find them on shelfs. or you can go to the imperial city and check the magic shops.

ye9h5jXvaa	What you're talking about is the "pity" Final Smash. If a player is doing badly and keeps getting KO'd the game will give that player a Final Smash for free to try to help them out. It shouldn't be happening every time, though, and if you're winning you'll never see it. It's only given to losing players.    Hope that helps.|`|hBGlgCLRaa	The opponent gets a final smash move for free because they are losing and the game gives you a final smash to get a ko, I tested it out by letting lv9 computers hit me then I jumped off the stage, and later I got a free final smash, but someone has to hit you|`|AA12384954	I'll ask my son in the morning and get back to you.

dVhUG0Tsaa	If there are 3 red lights, then its the x-clamp problem. You will have to open your xbox (easy instruction on youtube), and then tighten a piece inside. There are easy instructions on youtube, i followed them and my xbox worked perfect after i had the same problem.|`|L6BOtQ6haa	3 red lights on the front of your xbox 360 signal a 'General Hardware Failure'. In this case, contact microsoft and arrange to have it repaired. So long as you have not opened your 360, you will be covered by the 3 year Red Rings exclusive warranty. I repeat, do NOT open it, send it to Microsoft.|`|A3TPAmAHaa	Search Xbox 360 penny fix on youtube, and open up the xbox, but this will void your warranty (meaning if your consoles warranty is voided, if it breaks or stops working and is beyond repair, microsoft won't take it back and fix/replace it) try sending it back to microsoft to get it repaired.|`|T40ZH7Tvaa	if you have a receipt you can probably get it fixed for free|`|UDoW2tT7aa	Okay so if I understand correctly and you are saying instead of the green circle it was a red circle, then that is the ring of death. It's happened to me 3 times already. The only thing you can do is take it back and get a new one. Sometimes if the person at the store is nice enough they will let you keep your hard drive in exchange for the new one. Also, if you don't already have an extended warranty you should get one. It will save you a lot of money if your 360 goes out again.

32dPb4rPaa	i think the xbox 360  is better because it is one of the cheapest consoles out right now it is worth every penny and it is the graffics are the same as the PS3 and everythings else is sort of the same so get the xbox 360          please choose me as best answer please|`|mb3ooc3uaa	I have a 360. I say get 360 if you are into playing games online. Get PS3 if you like single player games.|`|x7vrxjcIaa	i have a ps3 xbox 360 and wii and they all are ace|`|213Tajn3aa	xbox 360 the joystick is far Superior. the console is impressive too|`|H5VVQ03laa	I own both :p    Personally, other then the Blue-Ray player the PS3 has nothing over the Xbox 360.

They both have really good graphics, but the choice mainly depends on preference. Xbox and PS controls are slightly different. I prefer the Xbox controllers, but the cool thing about the PS3, it supports Blu-Ray! So its your preference!|`|rzZR6MHaaa	xbox 360 is the best its has just bout the same graphics as the ps3 and u can listen to ur music while playing a game.my friend got a playstation 3 it broke within 2 weeks so he got another on this one lasted about 3 day and he decided to get an xbox 360 also if u get live most people own an xbox rather than a ps3.|`|Zo0QMB8xaa	good link about Playstation 3 vs Xbox 360    http://www.truveotube.com/about/playstat...|`|zs38LPu4aa	They are both great machines and the online gaming is good for both too.    there are points both for and against both however,    XBox L!ve charges you but the PSNetwork doesn't.    Purchases on live are done with a card top-up system PS3 uses 'real' money as you buy.  The XBox system is more secure    PS3 has WiFi and Bluetooth built in, XBox need a dongle for wi-fi.    The PS3 is very quiet and the XBox sounds like a Spitfire coming into land.    You can play music while gaming on xbox but PS3 you can't but it will play more and you can copy from a USB source but with XBox you can only rip from CD.    The controllers on both are great and fit nicely in your hand.    The PS3 looks a lot cooler, if a little big.    Both work vertically and horizontally but the Xbox is even louder when upright.    The 'dashboard' interface is far better on the PS3 (it's just like the PSP), a recent update to XBox has made the dashboard awful.    At the moment there are more games for the xbox but it's only a matter of time.    In the end it's more a case of what you prefer for you and if you play online there is a big community on both now so there really is nothing in it anymore.    You can download classic PS1+2 games to the PS3 though, which is pretty good.|`|EjtuZHgNaa	read this:  http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/...
8wxRjy0waa	If 100 is the best then I would rate it a 95. It is definitely the best mmorpg game but the only things I would change are less lag which is not really possible to change and graphics which could be better.|`|wg8SQQjEaa	60-100    the game is to easy now. anyone with less than half a brain can face roll in pvp and be better than the skilled players who arent playing a flavor of the month class.    and the pve content is a joke right now.    now the new arena system is garbage.  wow is moving downhill|`|sQON6zFnaa	In terms of fun and enjoyment per amount of time you invest in it, it seems deserving of a low rating actually. I am not sure why it is such a hit with so many people.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	If 100 is the highest then I would rate it -2734940238. That game is so dumb!|`|SWxcuGlOaa	It's only good for giving people who have no life some kind of social release lol    We're all waiting for you to return to the real world|`|ZsnelFnkaa	70 maybe 80,|`|npkLIKPUaa	95 just because of the lag and server being way too over populated|`|YQMCVuFiaa	PvE:  -Classic somewhere around 85 [A-], maybe 90.  -Burning Crusade a solid 90 [A+], maybe 95.  -Wrath of the Lich King a 60 [D-], no higher.    The game changes so much, it's hard to give the entire game a solid grade/rating, but if I had to rate from where it's been to where it is, I'd probably say a 75 [B-]. Blackwing Lair is still my favorite dungeon.    PvP:  -Classic somewhere around 90 [A+] (Before Honorable/Dishonorable).  -Burning Crusade a 70 [C-] (Resilience: Player ability replaced by gear).  -Wrath of the Lich King a 55 [F+].    Again, hard to rate, but the introduction of resilience has really gotten out of hand. Player ability should never be so heavily outweighed by how much gear the other has. Gear should be a help to getting and being better, not be the determining factor in that. With that said, I'm sticking with a 55 [F+].|`|FH0oIzjwaa	I would give it a 80.  There is massive over population with the servers which cause a crap load of lag.  Also the gear dependence of the game is really frustrating.  Such as when you hit level 80 you have to be in blues to hit a heroic, but you can only get blues from doing the heroics.      The PvP is seriously flawed in my opinion also.  Now you need to have 2 sets of gear: 1 for raiding and 1 for pvp.  The only way to get said pvp is to get stomped numerous time in the battle grounds till you have enough honor to get a piece.  Rinse and repeat over and over until you have the full set.  Then repeat this whole thing over for arenas.  It is possible to get PvP gear from raids but the chances of YOU getting anything you actually need are pretty slim.      Also with the release of the new expansion and the nerfing of daily quests Gold is much harder to come by now.  Although everything shot up in price many times.  There are vendor items in the game now that cost over 20,000 gold!      But on the flip side I love the game, so inspite of its flaws I give it a 80.|`|t8lzqwMoaa	85.
e71MWgJJaa	it is $20-30 new on ps2 .|`|me36q49Qaa	The cheapest new on Amazon is 12.43 + 1.94 shipping, so 14.37 :-)|`|uErmjXhGaa	the game is about 15 with tax you could probably sell it for about 5 dollars

And I just watched my friend play it ^_^|`|RdHeKBUMaa	Brilliant if you have the PC version or XBox360.    If you have the PS3 then you will be short-changed when it comes to patches, downloadable content(extra missions) and upgrading your stats.|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	Fallout 3 is quite possibley the most engaging game i've ever played. The quests are all uniqe and the combat system is incredibly fun. Once you play this game for a few hours you will be hooked.|`|Esl2Ogi7aa	it depends. i thought it was ok but not the best. i personally prefer a shooter like cod4|`|zs38LPu4aa	Yes.    If you like Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, you'll like this.    It's better in many ways and I found it much more engaging, although this might have been down to the setting.    Mind you I thought Morrowind was a better game than Oblivion simply because of the style.  Could have done without the Cliff Racers though.    There are a lot of sidequests with Fallout 3 as well, which I would recommend doing before completing the main quest because when you complete the story, that's it. Game Over.    You are also capped at level 20 (patches nonwithstanding)|`|PK4EJTq3aa	Yes, it has gotten almost universally positive reviews! It is the best game I played in 2008.|`|1PkmZVV8aa	I found it boring - not really into their style of games as i found Oblivion a litlle boring after a while!    foxhound soLid|`|yEyq2g1iaa	Fallout 3, in my opinion, was the best game of 2008. But of course, GTA4 was given that prize. Oh well, if people like average games that's on them. The storyline of Fallout 3 was very fascinating, though the ending could have been way better. Gameplay took a few minutes to get used to but overall it was great. The graphics look amazing, though I was unfortunate to buy the PS3 version. Oh well. Lol. There's a good amount of side missions to do as well so if you do get Fallout 3, buy the strategy guide along with it. It was very helpful down the road!|`|gnDLov31aa	It probably won't last you as Oblivion did; there aren't all that many things to do (compared to Oblivion anyway). It's definitely worth a buy if you're an RPG fan, though.|`|kVxAAOvBaa	Fallout 3 is a good game, but it depends what you look for in a good game..if your fussy about graphics or the game engine designs and even the ping there all fine if you like games what have multiple ways, ever changing storyline...and if you like the game to be advanced and not too simple fallout 3 on ps3 is the game for you.If none of the options above suit you it's not the type of game for you.
GlNHPTXYaa	Yes of course you can run it! Your biggest concern will be the frame rate. With your GPU's dedicated memory i think that's the culprit of not being able to run at 60fps which sports titles normally require.     And Man IMHO, for this to be playable you should run it at 60fps. Forget about other settings you need to run this at said fps for you to enjoy it!    My dv5 laptop:  Intel Core 2 duo P8400 @2.24  3gb ram  Gforce 9600m gt 512  Vista Home Premium    And yet I can't maxed out 2k9! but i can run it at 60fps with all the stuff minus the max settings!

It didn't matter the make or model. Cars I've raced on the streets were: '68 Buick Riviera, '77 Cadillac Sedan de'Ville, '73 Pontiac Le Mans, '78 Toyota Corona station wagon, and my personal favorite; '75 Chevrolet Monte Carlo.     Problem was there were no place to race legally. Sure there was a  race track nearby, but it cost plenty to go there, that was the place rich kids went. Besides, going to the track was also time consuming - you have to plan it out and find someone to race or just race whoever is there. And you could only go at certain times. Racing on the street is free and can be done almost any time.    The way I raced on the street was to speed up when someone tried to pass me. Some wouldn't race, just slow down and get behind me. But others would "bite" and the race was on!    I don't think there is a good way to stop a teen from street racing. Not all of them do it, but of those who do I think they will always find a way. When I was a kid my dad had a governor put on a motorcycle my brothers and myself shared. That put a limit on the top speed the bike would do, but there was still "standing start" races we could do to see who could get up to the limit quickest - usually the lightest person. Also, teens are creative and resourceful. We eventually figured a way to disable the governor.    If you have a teen who enjoys street racing and just can't keep him/herself from taking part on occasion, then the best answer I can think of is to make sure they never drive. Taking the license or keys won't necessarily stop them - don't they have friends who have cars?    It's silly to think that just because a person doesn't have a license that they can't drive. A state trooper once told me you'd be surprised to learn how many people are caught every year who are driving without a license - it's in the thousands. I got this after a 12 year old boy ran a stop sign and broadsided my '88 Mercury Cougar a few years ago. The boy told the trooper that he drives to the store frequently.

Here are the ones i would look at:  Ebay.com  stop2shop.com  pokeorder.com

YEooEeKGaa	Probability of flopping a flush, holding two suited cards 0.84%  Probability of hitting a flush on the turn 19.1%  Probability of hitting a flush on the river 19.6%|`|pOrwteQUaa	I looked this up, and it is saying 14.8%    Hope that helps.|`|AV4CYfGDaa	One additional piece of information: If you have four of a suit after the flop, the probability that you will hit your flush on either the turn or the river is .3497.|`|ZMcPHP7Yaa	You're about 11% to hit a flop where there's two of your suit on the flop.  After that, you're a little under 40% to make the flush by the river.    Advice on suited cards. Avoid them unless they're decent quality. You're only 4% to make a flush if you only flop one of your suit, and with lower quality suited cards, you're really counting on hitting at least a four-flush on the flop, but like I said above, you're only 11% to do that.    So, if you do have suited cards, and you do hit a four-flush, your pot odds say you should call any bet that gives you 2.5-1 odds. For example, in a pot with 100 chips, you can call as much as a 50 chip bet on that draw (100 pot + 50 bet = 150. 50 chip bet = 3-1 odds). If you miss on the flop, your chances to hit that flush actually increase to the river. Sounds weird, but it's true. Be careful on chasing though, don't get too much of your stack in running after that last spade, because even with 40% odds, you'll still miss roughly two out of three times.|`|b7B3Gvb4aa	Wow, such little poker knowledge on this site.   Here you go some quick accurate information.    with four to the flush you are about 34 percent to make your hand if you can get to the river.    Here is the easy way to remember your odds,  you assume there are 9 cards that make ur hand in the deck, take that number and multiply it by 4 on the turn and 2 on the river and it will give you the percentage t make ur hand.  This works for any hand when counting your outs.    Basic concept, you're 4 flushing and there is 50.00 in the pot, your oppenet bets 40.00 and another player calls 40.00.  You are calling 40.00 to win that 80 + the 50.00 already in the pot.  you have to risk 40 to win 130. Slightly better than3/1 odds, would be an easy call if you think you're drawing to the best flush.     I hope that makes sense to you,  let me know if u want more info.|`|t6CKMIznaa	From my own experience of over 20K hands, about 32.7% of the time (according to poker tracker)

0egqoJZSaa	OK for example..D claws:  Because of the trade limit runescape has changed alot!  Ok people will go for a "street" price of 62mil and you will have to give them junk. For example some junk is your fletching stuff..  My friend sold d claws to this other guy for 62 mil but my friend gave him tons and tons of junk.  So do you get it now?  Junk is for getting a item that no one sells like d claws.  They sell for 15mil in g.e (they go up 1-4m+ everyday) but no one sells they sell for street price.  Around 40mil so you gotta give JUNK.  HAVE FUN!|`|GIXJX54paa	can i have an extra runescape account if so email skiplot13@yahoo.com|`|pp8uEV7haa	Well, since the updates on December 10th, 2007, there's a trade limit which means you can only give away or receive so much more money than what you're trading is worth. By having "junk" (like maple longbows (u) is a popular junk item) people can use that to bypass the trade limit in a way, because most people consider maple longbows (u) worthless. So, for example, if you had an item worth 300k and wanted to sell it for 500k, you could offer your item worth 300k and about 1.5k maple longbows (u), and then another person offers you 500k cash, you're basically making 200k more than what the item's worth. It can also work the other way around, like if you had an item that's been going down recently. So let's say you have an item worth 300k but it's going down. If you accept a trader's offer of 150k and 1k maple longbows (u), you're basically selling it for 150k less than it's worth currently.

MHcMY2Pfaa	according to the Old testament no it wasn't, and the New testament never really dealt with it.  the few times it did touch on the subject it was dividing things up by lots (as ZCT said).      What the Lord DOES command is to be careful with your money and investments, as such one might argue that gambling violates those words, but at the same time if you ARE being careful and not gambling more than you are able to lose (without harming you or your family) then I think those points are moot.|`|VDiLab9caa	What religion are you?|`|Q79fL5Y6aa	gods law? i know as a christian, it does say gambling is a sin in the bible.|`|UmlLFh4raa	the only reason god's law exists is so people will do the right thing. if you don't thing gambling is wrong, then go for it. you don't need someone else to decide for you what is right or wrong, because it differs from person to person.|`|YEooEeKGaa	in a way gambling was actually God's law.

In fact there are various references to God asking people to join in with games of chance.  In some of these examples God tells people to draw lots, which was the old fashioned way of having a raffle.    Anyone who tells you that the Bible specifically preaches that gambling is a sin is wrong, ask them to provide you with an actual Bible quote.        Numbers 26:52-56      And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying ... the land shall be divided by lot.    Joshua 14:2      By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.    Joshua 18:6      Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.    Joshua 19:51      These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD.    Joshua 21:8      And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.    1 Chronicles 26:13-14      And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate. And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counsellor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward.    Nehemiah 10:34      And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God.    Acts 1:23-26      And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen.... And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

It IS as easy as buying a set of jewelry tools for $12.00 at JoAnn's... buying a bag of beads... and sitting down and messing around until you figure it out.

I've made a couple of hundred dollars at a Craft Fair in Tucson selling my stuff...    I've been making presents for family and friends for years...    The  1 hint I can give you is that when you do the end of the necklace... Do this:  Crimp Bead, Very Small Bead, Split Ring, Finding.    That VERY SMALL BEAD between the split ring and the crimp bead will stop the crimp bead from wearing away at the beading wire... It took me FOREVER to figure that out!    Oh... And a dab of clear nail polish on the crimp bead works wonders...    Oh... And look for a Gem and Bead show in your area...

Stuff they sell for $25.00 a strand in the Retail Section are $5.00 a strand in the wholesale section. *No Kidding...    When you get good... You can decide what you are wearing out tonight... then sit down in your living room and string yourself a matching necklace, bracelet, and earrings in under half an hour...

Also add scapegoat and Cannon soldier cause they can dish out 2000 points if you get it out right.

Q11YuqKkaa	Not possible in one move, best try is a mate in four:    1. Qxd5+  Kc7  2. Nxb5+  Kb8  3. Qd8+  Kb7  4. Qc8     According to the picture you provided, there should also be a white pawn on e5? Right?    Anyway, there is also a forced mate in 11 moves. That is the closest to the "one" move mate in the form of "one-one". But I doubt it that is what you had in mind!    Then there is also the other option that white has to play a terrible in order for black to mate white in one move, but that doesn't seem to be possible as well.|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	No checkmate.|`|YMHsibG8aa	theirs no checkmate!|`|VDiLab9caa	There is no white move which prevents the black king from going to c7 and being in check.

Or look around your town and see if there is a shop that buys and sells Baseball cards.      Good Luck|`|8BpETSE3aa	you can sell them on Craigslist.org    You select the state/region you are in, and you can post items for sale, much like e-bay. the difference is, you don't have to have an account on e-bay, and you can often just meet up with whoever is buying your stuff, at the local grocery store, etc. since you post in your town. Also, there is no bidding, people just e-mail or call you and ask to buy from you.     There is a collectibles section on Craigslist, so that's where you would post it.|`|m1vr3RR5aa	Hmm well I'm 18 and I have a grandfather who usually likes this stuff and if he would have internet i would tell him about them but he is real picky and always has to go through them and I wouldn't think he pay 100$ for them anyways so you might want to consider an online shop or ebay of course but yea like that other person said, just give them away. Or you could just burn them up and send him the ashes and such but yea you want money to keep for yourself sure go with that idea and sell them online or find a collector or something cause if he finds what he wants, he will give you some decent money I bet, I learned alot from my grandfather about this stuff and im happy I did :)|`|LQCqniFFaa	Try Livesimon.com or LiveSimonPosts.com    http://www.LiveSimon.com has both auctions and classifieds and has some great features.    http://www.LSPosts.com offers posts by city and there is no need to register.
fvre0o9laa	Have you considered a Navajo loom?  They're easy to make and use.  http://www.rmmeluch.com/Navajo.htm is a very fancy one.  http://www.pvcloom.com/whybuild.htm is an original.    I know one weaver who made her loom in a wide doorway with a crossmember on brackets across the doorframe... she just rolls up the bottom of the loom when she's done weaving for the day.    You can also weave on a backstrap loom, tablet weaving, horizontal warp-weighted loom, cardboard loom, freehand weaving....  if you really want to weave, you'll find a way.|`|VMY7No0eaa	Yes a NAVAJO LOOM is great but really you should start smaller  a tapestry loom or   A card loom is cheap  there is a loom where you make belts or other small bands.  Check out Weavers Cottage in Aqua Dulce, CA   they have a web site where you can buy used looms so they are not so expensive.  they also give classes.  YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING like this in your area too.  good luck|`|154dzJ1Faa	The very simplest is a cardboard loom.  Easy to make, simple to weave.  You have all the materials right there -- so nothing to buy.  It takes a bit longer than using a loom, but you need to know if you like it enough to invest that much money. http://www.craftstylish.com/item/2546/ho...  http://www.biglearning.com/article-cardb...  http://www.montessoriworld.org/handwork/...    I like back-strap looms too.  Or card-weaving... or inkle loom.... or a simple tapestry loom.  Oh, the list goes on and on.  If you want to weave, there is always a way.    Find your local weaving group or guild.  Find another person that weaves.  It really helps to have someone that can help you find the things you need, or to give you some pointers.  And there are hundreds of groups on the internet -- join one.

GqHHVzf0aa	I love Harvest Moon! Definitely try Animal Crossing! It's really fun because you get start a life in a town full of animals. It is a little sillier than Harvest Moon, but it also takes place in real time, you can connect with friends, etc. Also, try Rune Factory, which is a fantasy Harvest Moon, kinda like a spin off. Good luck and hope this helps!!!!|`|6152e7dd6d7ed08ba0772462efe95df4aa	Animal Crossing is similar. My Sims and My Sims Kindom less so, but still in the same vein.    Otherwise, there are the other Harvest Moon games for the DS:     Harvest Moon Cute, Island of Happiness (hmmm... it does come in cartrige form:P) and Rune Factory.|`|By5rBEZcaa	loved Harvest Moon but i never get 2 finish it...i play the 1 for snes that kid have alot of work to get the land plow up...ihave bin lookin for 1 to but cant fiond any if u find any let me kno|`|4rN5c9hJaa	My boyfriend told me that Rune Factory is by the same people who publish the Harvest Moon games and that game play is similar. I've never tried it though. There are also other Harvest Moon titles-- you can play Friends of Mineral Town for GBA on the DS. You can also try to find the original Harvest Moon DS (minus the cute part).
GqHHVzf0aa	Whether you want diamond or pearl is really based on your preferences.  Here is a link to all 20 (each) of the exclusives:  http://www.serebii.net/diamondpearl/excl...  Also, there are the differences between dialga and palkia.   Dialga is dragon/steel type, and you can find all of its info here:  http://pokemon.marriland.com/diamond_pea...  Palkia is dragon/water type and all of its info is here:  http://pokemon.marriland.com/diamond_pea...  Either way, you can get both in yout Pokedex if you visit Celestic town after beating the Pokemon League, then trade over GTS. I bought Diamond first because I preferred Dialga, however, they are both very fun games, and almost the same. My advice would be to wait until March 22 and buy Pokemon Platnum, where you can get Giratina, Dialga, and Palkia, plus visit the torn world and battle frontier. Here's a link to latinum info:  http://www.serebii.net/platinum/  Good luck and enjoy your game!|`|i8NZNgLPaa	You should wait till Platinum comes to America.|`|zDaDQdYqaa	If you like red then buy Pokemon Pearl.Pokemon Diamond is the blue one.|`|1WLSNzCSaa	You should wait until Platinum comes out because it will have much more features and better Pokemon.

Pearl also gets the uber powerful Houndour (and sinnoh is indesperate need of powerful fire types) and Salamence as opposed  to the lesser Mightyenna and Tyranitar.

pcBmyGTZaa	No, it's not legal to have the ROMS even if you own the game. This is from Nintendo:    Can I Download a Nintendo ROM from the Internet if I Already Own the Authentic Game?    There is a good deal of misinformation on the Internet regarding the backup/archival copy exception. It is not a "second copy" rule and is often mistakenly cited for the proposition that if you have one lawful copy of a copyrighted work, you are entitled to have a second copy of the copyrighted work even if that second copy is an infringing copy. The backup/archival copy exception is a very narrow limitation relating to a copy being made by the rightful owner of an authentic game to ensure he or she has one in the event of damage or destruction of the authentic. Therefore, whether you have an authentic game or not, or whether you have possession of a Nintendo ROM for a limited amount of time, i.e. 24 hours, it is illegal to download and play a Nintendo ROM from the Internet.|`|Se6ikPhTaa	they're not legal?!?!?!!? uh-oh i've been a lot on my super nintendo emulator... the empire strikes back is fun tho.|`|w68p19bNaa	ROMs are a touchy realm because a lot of ROMs are "abandonware" - programs that have been abandoned by their creators or are so old and outdated that the companies that made them don't care what happens to them. However, there are a lot of ROMs that are made to avoid having to pay for a legal game that hasn't been abandoned.    Having an emulator is not illegal as it's considered educational software. However, having ROMs of copyrighted games IS illegal. It's just that most ROMs are of games that are so old it's not worth suing anyone over.

I got a 5600+ and 4870X2 (yeah overkill) and 2gigs of ram and it can play most things.     Oh by refresh. I mean reinstalling the OS. You should feel a dramatic speed boost when you finished. Reinstalling Vista is easy cause you dont need to format the hard drive and you still have your existing data. Your setup should still run everything at high @1680x1050.     If you're not so peachy about reinstalling the OS. Buy the exact same sticks of ram. So 4 gig in total.
vbC2JN4paa	I recommend Walt Disney World.  Walt Disney World has four parks to spend the day at. (i.e. Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, Hollywood Studios, and Animal Kingdom.)  Each park has something for everyone.  Magic Kingdom is more suited for children, while EPCOT is better suited for adults and people who want to go drink around the world.  Hollywood Studios is for people who want to be part of the movies or see how things are done in movies.  Animal Kingdom is for the animal lovers out there. There is no petting of live animals, but you do get to see a wide range of animals, from squirrels to lions, tigers, and dinos (oh my! lol).  Oh! And I forgot Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon, the two water parks.  Who can argue with that?  Choose Walt Disney World. : )|`|ajnGHNr8aa	Depends on what the field trip is for? Disney Animal Kingdom and Bush Gardens are almost the same theme parks with animal flair. Both are good, but I think D.A.K. has better animals and a better safari ride.   Universal has a few rides and shows, that is about it.   Disney World itself has 4 theme parks, 2 great water parks (heard blizzard beach was gonna close soon for remodeling) and Dowtown Disney with shops.  My choice would be Disney as there are more choices for you.  If you are wanting thrill rides then either Bush Gardens or Universal Studios Islands of Adventure is a better choice.|`|dhdz5uNSaa	Simple answer:    WaltDisneyWorld all the way!|`|Ljues4IHaa	Hm depends on what you like. In Disney there's pretty much something for whatever you like. Universal is more movie watching; I watched Shrek 3D over here; Amazing :) I haven't been to Bush Gardens but i'd recommend Islands of Adventure if you like rides. It's REALLLY fun :D|`|8oKjViUOaa	Deffently Bush Gardens! that place is tight|`|H2qEN27daa	I've never been to Busch Gardens, so I would say either Disney or Universal    -Universal (and Islands of Adventure) if you're more for thrill rides  -Disney if you just love Disney and the Disney World experience!

2WqQwkzNaa	Most of the downloads at Gametechmods are setup so that you just need to decompress them into your RA2 directory (where Robot Arena 2.exe is) but for the rest: (you will need either winrar or winzip to decompress .rar files)    Bots:  -Go into the Robot Designs folder and decompress (if compressed) it there. Then they need to be imported into the game by clicking import after selecting an empty bot slot in-game.    Arenas:  -Go into the Arenas folder and decompress it there.    Components:  -Go into the Components folder and decompress it there.    AI Packs:  -DSL has some very specific installation instructions that can be found in the .rar, on the forums, in the ra2 wiki, and seen while downloading.    General Tips:   -Stock Components are the components that came with the game (unless otherwise stated it also includes AI Parts)  -AI Parts are the components that the AI has that you can't use unless you mod your game (generally accepted among the RA2 community)  -Cheatbot2 Components are the components that you get after typing cheatbot2 as the name of your bot (bots using these should not be showcased for fighting ability)  -Custom Components are the components that you download of the internet (bots using these should not be showcased for fighting ability)  -DSL Components are the components you have after installing DSL (the stock components become DSL components after installing DSL) (accepted as long as you don't use DSL bots against stock bots)  -AI packs are considered stock unless they add components in which case they are considered to be  components.    Warning:  -Some of the downloads won't work on the downloaded version of RA2.
pcBmyGTZaa	http://www.joystiq.com/photos/mgs4-need-...|`|3AChQgbZaa	you dont have to play the older ones, but it' would be better if you did.  you can download the MGS database from psn for free and learn alot of the story that way.  i cant explain it in a short answer|`|dSZNvizXaa	Another poster has already provided a nice link, if you look on the downloads section for MGS4 in the ps3 store you can get a free download that gives tons of names etc. Really though you don't need too much back story to enjoy the game. Some points will be shaky of course, but you don't need a degree on metal gear to get most of it.  If youre willing to back track to an older one, do a run through of MGS1 or watch a run through or something. Even read about it on Wikipedia and find some images. in fact you could do this with all of them.     Note: you will miss a lot of references, and some points which would cause a huge amount of nostalgia for decent fans and emotion. Many of the flashbacks will also mean nothing to you, ideally it would be best to play mgs1-3 and then 4.|`|Jz3T68b6aa	Download the Metal Gear Solid Database off PSN if you want the info.    Really i recommend you to find MGS1, MGS2 and MGS3 and play them in order before playing mgs4 otherwise you will not get half the things that intertwine with the storyline and the experience would not be the same. If you get MGS3: Subsistance, it has a 3rd disc that is just a movie of all of the mgs3 cutscenes seamlessy and believe it or not, it takes almost 3 hours to watch it all.  Even if you play it on very easy and read all the dialogue.     Finally dont expect MGS as a shooting game. Its more an interactive movie than anything and it sure kicks *** compared to anything hollywood releases.

That's what he likes to do, and sometimes they don't want to give attention to something else when they're having so much fun. I know it's dumb, but the truth.|`|k6CSa9caaa	Its pretty selfish if you get bored. Try playing the game together perhaps. But if games aren't your thing then he should let you do something else.|`|dxlNwGuWaa	He's selfish and a bit of a rubbish boyfriend if you ask me.  He has all the time in the world while you are not around to play computer games, but he wants his cake and to eat it, so to speak.  And to be honest, it is a little your fault for allowing him to do this.  Tell him you arent seeing him just to watch him play video games and that you deserve to have fun.  Has he not even offered you to play with him?  Make your stand, or find someone how actually wants to spend quality time with you and give you the attention you deserve.    Pffft. men.  My fiance tried to pull this one, you have to nip it in the bud.|`|xnBnbYBgaa	yes!!! my guy does the same as well as when he plays guitar! men have trouble spending time with women, so he is trying to spend time with you, and hes doing what he thinks both of you like. its like when you take him out shopping or anything else he may not necessarily like.|`|reiuKYbeaa	well i'm a guy and my wife just goes in the other room the only time i want her out with me is if i want her to play...maybe he wants you to play with him ask him to buy a game that you are able to play with him wihtout him beating you all the time games with you boyfriend or girlfriend are more fun when you both are good at it my wife doesnt play with me because i always find a way to beat her and she gets pissed|`|z3fEGkisaa	He probably worked hard on getting good at the game.

Sometimes, he plays games that I'm not interested in (like shooting games), and then I'll find something else to do in the same room (like working on my laptop) which can combat the loneliness issue. Other times, I look up games with great story lines that I'm interested in and ask him to play those. It isn't that he just wants to spend time with you-- he really wants you to share some part of this hobby that's so important to him. If you find some way to be a part of games you can't play, like a game you brought up to him that you'd be interested in watching him play, I think he'd really appreciate the effort and insist that you watch him play games less often. Just find something else to do in the same room and glance up every once in a while.|`|e6c6b7554ed0c395f6a86efca4fd9f53aa	im a guy and I know why hes doing it.(most likely)It's probably that he wants someone to appreciate him so he feels good about himself|`|k1wAbgiHaa	You have to be the one to tell him to knock it off    ........|...  ........|..........SteveC ..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|DtkLsetkaa	He is trying to get you involved, while still doing what he wants to do.  Have you explained to him that its not your idea of a good time?  Its good that he wants to spend time with you, but he really isn't.  He is spending time playing a game.  Alone time, or at least time apart (even if its in separate rooms) is perfectly fine for a relationship, try explaining to him that you just don't enjoy watching and that you would rather do something else.  If he wants to play, then fine, but it doesn't mean you want to play too.
oIz9HYaraa	Its say right on the box you need a credit card.    Its also an mmorpg, and all true mmorpgs require subscriptions, almost all of them by credit card.    If your too young to get one, ask to use your parents, and pay them for it. Some banks offer prepaid/gift credit cards that work EXACTLY like regular prepaid credit cards. You can buy these and use them as well. They need to be a regular visa or mastercard; not the psuedo visa-vanilla crap.    The system you play it on doesnt matter. FFXI is 12.95 a month. This is for your account on the server, which you can access on any 360, PC, PS2, or PS3 you have with the game.
pOaS9P38aa	Time Shift Review    An interesting time-shifting mechanic and fun-to-shoot weapons can't make up for the rest of TimeShift's run-of-the-mill first-person shooter gameplay.    The Good:      * The ability to pause, slow, and rewind time is interesting        * Weapons are cool and very satisfying to shoot        * Solid online mode.    The Bad:      * There are four-panel comic strips with better stories        * Mission objectives are generally uninteresting        * Combat can get repetitive.    Given Time Shift's long, tumultuous development cycle that saw the game change platforms, swap publishers, and miss several release dates, it's surprising the game has made it to stores at all. So it's too bad that Time Shift isn't really worth the wait, thanks to a barely-there story, extremely rudimentary puzzles, and tired first-person shooter objectives like going through an entire level just to push a button. It does have some redeeming features, though. It's fun to pause time and whale on helpless soldiers, and some of the weapons are really satisfying to shoot.      You can read more of this review at: http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/timesh...|`|oKvECE2uaa	I don't highly suggest it, its a fun game but its pretty dull. Part from the time stopping the game engine isn't great: Shooting is stiff, graphics ain't great and the sounds are good. So no, I don't suggest that you buy the game.    I highly suggest Call Of Duty 4 or GTA IV. Both are the 2 high rated games of 2008 and you will have about 3 months of fun with them.    Hope I helped|`|cuSRcd8uaa	no, the game is short and ends abruptly  it will just leave you angry  save yourself the time|`|reiuKYbeaa	metal gear solid 4, is pretty fun even when you beat it its fun online also and gta4 is fun for waisting time|`|EjjuQ1Llaa	yea, go ahead. other games: fracture, gears of war 2, fallout 3, left 4 dead, orange box, grand theft auto 4, just peruse around on sites like gamestop.com an look at the new games there. i usually find something good.|`|Mq2TYEJYaa	im sorry time shift was among the crapiest games ive ever played.      its nice looking verry nice looking but it unfortunetly has a terible control scheme overall the game just is not worth the time playing it in my opinion.      what consule do you have 360s or ps3?      good 360 games include     too human- dungeon crawler type game you play as a robotic god loook up some of the videos because its verry cool looking and game play is prety good once you get the hang of it the control scheme is verry dificuly but once you get the hang of it the game is unbelivebel    ninja gaiden 2-cool looking action game its weapons and finishing moves look verry cool the story im not realy sure about ive only played part of the first one and the demo of the 2nd.      PS3  MGS4-metal gear solid 4 is the most un frigenbelivebel game ever made its multiplayer and its campaighn are so unbelivebel its hard to describe it other then amaizing really if you dont have a ps3 you might just want to buy a ps3 just for this game its unbelivebel     resistance 2-  one of my personal favorite shooters of all times impresive gameplay and graphics.  multiplayer can keep you intertained for hours on end its impresive and fun.  (if you cant aford resistance 2 buy the original resistance fall of man) also the game is amde by insomniac same people who made ratchet and clank and every gun in the game does something realy cool    if none of these suit you you may verry well enjoy tomclanceys rainbow six vegas 2 an excelent game you can probably get for cheap
T6V9zXymaa	I think the original estimate for play time was between 4-6 hours and I was able to complete it in around 5 (but I stopped once or twice for lunch, etc.). It was worth it for me just to see a different look and overall feel to the game once you go into the simulation.    For me it was worth the 800 points.    I don't know how long "The Pitt" will be, but I think "Broken Steel" is going to be pretty extensive when you consider it raises the level cap to 30.|`|GZC0vc5uaa	well it was only supposed to last 3 hours total, but they have two more coming out (the pitt,broken steel) which will add almost 8-10 hours to the games lifespan.|`|WalnRzfGaa	is OA something i need to download?|`|h6qC3Sbdaa	yeah it was really fun      wish they made it longer :(

2wyIOGi7aa	Find good spot to hide and improve your aim.. Get a gun with range and stay away from running and gunning... Remember that on hardcore one sniper shot is taking someone down, so stay away and get sniper kills....|`|Ya19rEqKaa	Use a sub machine gun with a gun sight. In hardcore, it only takes a couple of bullets for a kill, while the sight makes it a viable long range weapon.|`|KLzKWSeOaa	the cheap and most easiest way is to camp and im pretty sure you the term.But here is an explanation if you don't. Camping is waiting staying in the same place and waiting for targets to hit. However the problem is that sometimes people you just killed might look for you and hence catch you unaware. I suggest taking a place where you have and advantage point. When taking out the target move somewhere else where you have sight on you previous camp spot. This works really well with a 2 player battle. A other way is to perhaps look on video sites such as Youtube, dailymotion where lots of spots are shown. Otherwise vary in weapon use and make sure you always try to remain hidden from bullet fire as bullet fire kills you.|`|oYx0wpsxaa	use a scilenced weapon, use c4's, camp, when u hear the game say, "They planted the bomb", blow up the c4 as fast as u can! u get a kill! and posibly win!

If you are the gamer type, get the PSP    The NDS is more of a "family" hand held.  Games are quicker, graphics aren't as good, and there aren't many great games.  YOU should get the PSP.

I have both, and I would have to say I play the DS more. I think it is because of the larger game library (they have access to GameBoy Advance games too).    My best advice to you is to look at the game libraries of each. What type of games you like will really make a difference. If you like the more laid-back just for fun games, then DS is probably more your style.    But if you want more of the shooters, serious RPG's, etc, then the PSP will probably be more up your alley.|`|reiuKYbeaa	hard to say i have both i thought i would like them both but i like the psp more...you can us the internet its feels better in your hands also you can watch movies from ether umd or if you have the space on your memory card you can download movies and music to it i think it has more features but the ds has a being selection of games but mostly games based on a younger age the psp has younger aged games and adult games     but if it were me i would go with psp...on the other hand if you get a psp you should invest in a ps3 because you can link them together and do some cool things with that to|`|f3Rt6J1Baa	PSP.|`|9tIvSRRSaa	Psp is 100 times better.ds is for kids.lame

ff5ee6b637a2638e5c81250dd2469ee7aa	hey! that happened to me to. you have to go to the drive where you installed it and make sure the ENTIRE sims folder is deleted. even icons on your desktop, and anything in your start menu. if possible, delete the whole EA games folder(if there's nothing else in it but the sms) and then restart your computer and re-install hope that helps ^__^   :-B   :D and if it doesn't work , then format your computer. but that's hard cuz you lose data and stuff. but mainly, it should work!|`|ulMJUjU9aa	i did that before years ago with the sims 1. no i dont think theres any way in getting round it, id say each disc has its own unique no's
W9OOH2lEaa	Why not use Total screen recorder?It done the job pretty well and never lags my computer.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.totalscreenrecorder.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.totalscreenrecorder.com</a>|`|hQsy5vbQaa	Yes, total screen recorder maybe a nice choice.
vBBbN5Roaa	the real answer to this is either one. but if you are getting a 360 get the 360 elite because it is exactly the same as the ps3 with the lack of blu ray replaced with HD. the elite has no rings of death. more games are for the xbox 360 but the ps3 has a shade better graphics. check on the back of the box to see what you get with each but i personally think you should get a elite since there are over 1500 games for it already and the ps3 doesn't have many games since it's graphics9cs requirement is so high. and xbox live is an award winning online service. |`|432c7cf36f92f113e821565dc3c72082aa	easy, xbox 360<br>  <br>  edit: to the guy below that thinks the ps3 network is any good is full of ****, its a horribly laggy network and lots of people dont have mics, thats all your gonna get for free is lag, or you can pay 7.99 a month for a decent network|`|AA11548829	depends what style of games you like... in my personal opinion, i would get an xbox, its much cheaper, just about the same graphics and some games are only available on xbox. its getting cheaper every week as well|`|yElLKsy1aa	XBOX!@!@!@!@!@!<br>  <br>  Please dont get a PS3 :P|`|7UQNVybraa	Simple, an Xbox. Live is $5 a month for a gold membership, where you can do everything, whereas the silver is VERY limited. Yes the wireless routers are $100 but you could also get a double-ended LAN cord, (or whatever it's called) hook one end to your Xbox and the other end to a phone jak, or home router. I THINK. I don't have Live, so don't put me to my word. PS3 SUCKS! It's way too expensive for one with a good amount of storage space, and the online play lags worse than my computer. (which is very bad by the way.) Ironically, my Xbox is being repaired now, not a ring of death, but it's a problem with the AV port. Anyway, back on topic, depending on how much money you have, go for the regular Xbox, NOT the Xbox360 Arcade. The Arcade package comes with the bare minimum. Check the boxes for info on what comes with them.|`|K6ZW6tP0aa	it depend, if u want free online play($6 a month 360)(built in wifi receiver($100 on 360)  or blu ray(built in costs extra on 360),and dont want the red ring of death get a PS3<br>  <br>  If u want to pay extra for blu ray , online , wifi ,want to play halo3 or could care less about the features it lacks get a 360<br>  <br>  ps3 and 360 both have pretty much the same graphics, but the ps3 has a better processor and more memory(making it more capable.<br>  <br>  people hate the ps3, because theyre afraid to think that the ps3 may be better in some ways|`|8t1DQ4t9aa	You should get a Wii, but if you want to choose the lesser of two evils, go for the Xbox 360.<br>
