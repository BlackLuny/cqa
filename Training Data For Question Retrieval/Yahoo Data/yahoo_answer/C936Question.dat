20090226100935AAaJBtp	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	I seem to spend money as fast as I earn it. Any tips?	I started a savings account around September 2008 when I started working at Wal-Mart. I make around $200-$250 bi-weekly, and I try my best to save most of it and keep a little for my own personal leisure.      That doesn't really work out so well for me during those months, because  I only have barely over a thousand dollars in my savings when I should have had at least 2500 and I've been trying hard to limit my spending, but it's always a losing battle for me. I seem to spend the most money on materialism - mainly jackets and some clothes - This is my first job, so I'm guessing it's the pleasure of having money that provokes my spending habits.      Nonetheless, I've convinced myself that I have a serious spending habit. I go to the bank nearly every day and take about $10-$20 - and it starts adding up with every week that passes before I receive my next check; I can't seem to keep myself away from impulse buying as well. I was supposed to have at least $2589, but my savings only contains a mere $1195, and I'm trying to save up at least $5,000 or more for a new truck - it's a goal I want accomplished by next year when I transfer (I'm an 18 year old CC student)      What sources are available for me? All in all, I just want to spend less and save more. Any tips, suggestions, etc. are appreciated.

The arrangement is that I split the cost of gas (heating), garbage and sewage between the two apartments.  My neighbors moved out in August of 2008, and since there is only one thermostat controlled by the downstairs apartment, I received a key around October so I can adjust the heat to my liking.  New tenants moved in downstairs in January and the gas bill has skyrocketed.  There were numerous occasions when I had to call them to ask to lower the heat because it was so extreme.  On February 14th, a thermostat was finally installed in my 2nd floor apartment.      My neighbors pay a flat rate where everything is included in their rent.  My bills now total to much more than that and more than they were last year around the same time.  I realize that this was a bad arrangement that I agreed to, but is there any way that I can challenge these charges?  Or am I stuck because I agreed to these terms?

What I'm asking is, how do you "physically" list items  on schedule D, part 1, a, b, c, etc  Must I list ALL buys and sells, or can I summarize totals?   Example-- bought  Focus Media on april 3, 5, 8, 10 for various prices-- grand total 1,800. sold Focus Media May 3, 10, and 12 and various prices till all gone--I don't own any anymore, Grand total proceeds $1600.  a loss, OK-- can't I just give grand totals of gain and loss without painstakingly listing EVERY Focus Media transaction?   thanks

20090226110604AAP7MwP	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	I want to make money building houses!!!  - Is this a good way?	I've been watching all of these "home-time", "build-it", "lets renovate", and so many other television shows and I really have the itch to build a few houses and make lots of money on my hard work !      Then I watched an episode of a cottage show, it talked about a new foam-foundation building product (fast forms was one of the companies that installs it).  It looked really easy and like just about anyone could build their own foundation walls themselves.      The commentator on the show said this:      - First find the land   - Make a deal with the seller   - dig the hole   - install the foundation and pour the concrete   - build the rest of the house   - sell the finished house for a great profit - and you're done!      It all looked so easy that I really want to do it myself !      Now I ask you; what is the market for homes right now?   If I build a house, can I turn it around and sell it is 2 weeks or less for enough so that I can make 20% - to - 50% profit on my total investment?  (not including my 3 or 4 months of labor).??      I live up here in Canada (Ontario) and the real estate markets is beginning to slow down here now.  How's Florida?  The last time I looked a few years ago, there were people camping out in lines just to wait for the privilege to put down a down payment.  Is it still that way, is the market still just booming down there? (smile).      Thanks and have a nice day :-)

When i finally got the position the managers had been paying mind games throughout-changing the dates when i was due to start,not confirming anything ,promising to give me the working hours what i requested ,only to tell me the hours i wanted is not available - and later finding out , they had saved the hours that i wanted for someone else.   I decided to go ahead with it anyways -but now it seems to my disadvantage. I got on with my team members real well , i was hitting my targets and was told how amazed they was that i had excelled the postion during a short space of time., but over the last few weeks one team member in particular( whom i thought i was close with) suddenly became distant and sometimes harsh towards me - and then i noticed more members became the same- I simply put it down to jealousy and made nothing more of it       - The two managers would constantly make out that i am wrong and irrecilale when i challenge them about - recently i was pulled up and told i will have to attend a displinary because of my behaviour because they said i was rude to my team members and even my trainer who is the typical " tell me all your secrets so that i can add fuel to the fire for you"       Should i just leave? why do i constantly come across people like this in the working environment, what have i done that is so wrong other than trying to be have a job i love?

20090226112453AAoRwJI	Business & Finance;Credit	Should I help my husband or save my credit?	BACKGROUND   So - my husband is in a credit union and they gave him an auto loan. At the time that he got the car, he was working two jobs and listed both jobs on his credit application. His payments were being automatically deducted from his paycheck. Then he left job #1 to work full time at job #2. He did not notify the credit union of this change, assuming that they would automatically switch it once they saw that he was no longer working at job #1 (bad call, I know!). Well, they never did switch it, and this morning his car wasn't in the driveway. My rocket scientist husband does all of his payments automatically, so he never noticed that the payments stopped coming out of his paycheck (roll eyes).      I know he owes over $3000, plus whatever fees they're going to charge to get the car back. However, the car is only worth about $2000 at this point! He doesn't even want the car (99 Dodge Durango gas guzzler). I don't know what he should do - I'm sure his credit is shot either way.       QUESTION   He called the credit union and they want $5,000. He has horrible credit as it is, and he doesn't have $5,000 - I have pristine credit and a credit card with a $13,000 limit. I want to help him, but if putting $5,000 on my credit card is going to ruin my credit, then we're both SCREWED! He would only be able to give me $350 per month and my apr is 12%. Should I bail him out or will helping him destroy us both???
20090226115617AATW9ua	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	Where have the lost resources gone. Where is the lost cash.?	I have never been a fan of Gordon Brown or the labour party; however I cannot understand why he is getting so much flack, when the rest of the world is also suffering from recession.   I understand why bank officials, because of their contracts are paid large bonuses. However the bonuses which are paid to the bankers is a small % and this was after the recession started. Their bonuses did not cause the recession. (Yes, I know that their incompetence did not help).   The question which I cannot get my head around is where are our lost resources? Where has it all gone, who has the cash and the lost resources that have gone down the pan?      Another thought and another question. Why did David Cameron think that he had to tell us that the cash that Gordon Brown is using to rescue the banks and possibly the car manufacturers will ultimately be taken as increased taxes?   We did not need to be told this; David Cameron must think that everyone is daft. Nevertheless, I feel daft at asking and repeating my question, “Where have out lost resources gone”

Our combined salary is a little over $70K.  We have great credit but not too much $ for a down payment, maybe $5K.  I know it is kind of a rule of thumb to not purchase a house around a wedding (parents are paying for most of it) and if you have much debt which I kind of do....college loans still.  But it also seems it's a buyer's market right now and I don't know if we wait a couple years will house prices go up again when it rebounds.  This would be our first time home buying - and I heard of some programs out there...Fannie Mae, Fred Mac, etc.  Please give your opinions and if we could get a house what should I range be?

20090225115031AAEOpFg	Business & Finance;Credit	Re: Pressure on banks 2 make high risk loans 2 borrowers w/ poor credit: WHAT YEAR did it start & WHO started?	The real estate / housing debacle along with the U.S. credit crunch right now is blamed in part on the folks who started pressuring banks to make loans that the banks sensed might fall into trouble (sub-prime mortgages) because the borrowers were borrowing too much relative to their income, had bad credit, or were buying too big of a house for their budget.  This led to the popularization of sub-prime mortgages that eventually fell apart, as some prudent lenders sensed they would and might never have made were it not for the pressure they were being put under to make more loans to almost anyone wanting to get into a house.      So who was it that started this big idea?  Who first started pressuring the banks to do this?  Was it a President?  Was it the head of some agency?  Was it community activist groups like ACORN?  I think the pressure came from several sources, but I need to know who was the most responsible, and when did they start doing this such that it spread like an ugly rash across the home mortgage market and led to the crisis we are in today.

I have an Ebay account with excellent feedback and a high score and I have been dying to start buying designer clothing wholesale and selling it on Ebay. I recently sold a few Juicy Couture bags for friends that wanted to make some extra cash, and I know that the business is BOOMING. So far, from all of my thorough research, I know that Ed Hardy is the "it" thing this season, as are Juicy Couture tracksuits [as always]. I do NOT want to work with a manufacturer from China if at all possible, just because of how bad all the reviews are that I keep reading.       I want to know of a website, or list of websites, that sell designer brands [not necessarily the most expensive such as Gucci or anything, just stuff like A&F, etc.], at a good price, that is below retail, and I don't mind about the minimum order quantity.       Is there anyone out there that knows from *firsthand* experience of a good place to purchase these items? Or, even of a place to purchase designer fragrances wholesale?? I really want to get into this business and am willing to take whatever steps necessary.       Google searches have gotten me absolutely nowhere, and I would really like to hear from someone who is either in, or has been in, my position.       Thanks so much in advance!

Of course, I can not believe it.  This was a well planned work of a group of international financial robbers.    By just appointing an old man to face the US law and might be jailed, this group of robbers can enjoy these 50 Billion Dollar, why not? It's really a very good bargain any way.    As we know, environment for rich people in jail is different from the poor. When in jail, the rich always can get lawyers, doctors or specialists to get them out from jail to go to a nice hospital. All hard earned money from people all over the world went to the hand of this group of financial robbers.   In short, poor and stupid is jailed everyday by hard works. While the rich and smart will not be jailed at all even they have done very bad things to the society. With money they robbed, they can enjoy live even the law put them in jail.   As others financial groups start learning from Bernard Madoff case, more financial robbery cases will take place. More and more financial groups will become robbers because the reward is so good and punishment is avoidable.    So recently, the next international financial robbery took place which is "Stanford International: $9 billion fraud".   More and more international financial robberies will take place in near future.    What the governments can do to prevent this type of financial robberies?    What common people should do in order to protect they hard earned money from being robbed?   Can we avoid direct investment or indirect investment in all kinds of financial or financial related products?   Please provide your opinions and suggestions.

20090225114227AANyzZI	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	An Employment Issue. Advice Please.?	An elderly, dumpy, heavy female employee works in a shop.      The shop has a no sitting  policy and does not provide seating at the work station.      When she started 2 years ago the then manager allowed her to bring in her own seat which she uses on a daily basis.      Because of her size she has problems if she is standing for any length of time.      The old manager had left a year ago and now   The  replacement manager who has been there a year has after speaking to the area manager, told her to take the seat back home as it is against company policy and also against the company health and safety policy as the seat is not provided by the company.   [The seat is in good order and designed to take heavy people]      She has been told from now on that she must stand, and if she cannot then she will be deemed to be braking her contract and subject to disciplinary action.      I repeat that it would be impossibile for this lady to stand for hours on end.      How should this be looked at?      Thanks for any replies.

I saw something on the news about when people are going through foreclosure to file a "produce the note" can someone give me details about this? What happens if they don't "produce the note"? I am not going through foreclosure but I am interested in learning more about what exactly is going on...      How much time can this give you if you do file this?      Is it possible to get a free house out of this??????   Has anyone filed this with Resmae Mortgage or America's Servicing Company?      Should everyone do this????      I heard of a lady that got foreclosed on and then after she got the house taken away, months later she was getting more notices in regards to the same house that a new lender was going to foreclose on her. Now I am sort of wondering, if they don't have all their ducks in a row when it comes to the beginning papers how are we so sure they are documenting and keeping their ducks in a row when the process is over and I finish paying for my house?

I have decided that what I really want to do as a career is be a Certified Nurse Midwife, but I'm about to graduate from The University of Texas with an Anatomy degree.  UT is way too expensive for me to stick around and earn my RN as I realized my dream to be a nurse only this year, but considering it is one of the top schools in the state, I'd be a fool to transfer to a community college and start my RN at this point (as I'd lose my hard-earned UT degree).      So, my question is, if I am graduating in the Spring without an RN, is there a way for me to begin my path to becoming a CNM without starting a four-year undergraduate degree all over again?  Are there accelerated or combined programs that I could take advantage of, or am I doomed to start my undergraduate life all over again?      Thank you for your help :-)
