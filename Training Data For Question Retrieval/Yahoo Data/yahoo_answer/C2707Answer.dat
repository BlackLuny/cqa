KEYgd73saa	For plants, Swords, Hairgrass, Pennywort, Sagittaria species, Alternanthera species, Bacopa species, Stargrass, Myriophyllum species, Cabomba species, and many of the other common species are Amazonian.  However, you'll have to ensure you've got a phenomenal amount of lighting over such a large tank if you want ANY chance of most of those plants growing.  CO2 levels, nutrients, and substrate also have to be taken into consideration.<br>  <br>  I am very worried about the size of the tank, actually... especially with the first answer recommending a stingray that will get well over a foot in diameter, needing a 6+ foot long tank upwards of 2 feet wide.  With Discus, I would recommend you NOT get Congo Tetras, as they are large and active, and will quickly stress the Discus.  They will not work well together.  Also, Congo Tetras are, as their name suggests, from the Congo... in AFRICA, nowhere near the Amazon.  Instead, consider a massive school of Hatchetfish, which will create a spectacular appearance at the tank's surface.|`|jnzSz3tRaa	black devil stingrays are cool and from the amazon.  <br>  <br>  plants-<br>  amazon frogbit
WtaM7mA5aa	Walk up to him when he barks.  Stand in front of him and say "stop" or enough.  Get his mind on other things.  Heard him out of the area he is barking .  You must keep this up every time he does it, eventually he will understand this isn't what he should be doing. It is a lot of work, but it will get better. Your dog will realize what he should be barking at and what he shouldn't be barking at.  He will warn you when he needs to.  You will have to determine how much warn barking he should do.<br>  <br>  As for your son in law, when he comes over have him completely ignore the dog.  Have him not look at the dog, not talk to the dog.  Just have your Son in law sit down and pretend like the dog isn't there. Put the dog on a leash. When he barks at the son- tell him NO and leave the room.  Enter the room again with the dog.  If the dog barks, take him out again.  Once you get the dog to be quiet, reward him with his favorite treat. If he barks again- out of the room.  This will take lots of patience, but eventually the dog will associate your son in law with a positive treat, and should be better.  But it is important for the son in law to pretend the dog is invisiable.  Good luck.|`|xxtrFHn6aa	puppys have to stay with theres mom and other sibling for AT LEAST 8 weeks before the breeder sells the puppies.

It does take a while for me to train my warning bark dogs, but I address the situation the second they start barking.  My parents grabbed a shot gun and went outside the second our outdoor dogs started barking.  It doesn't take long to train them what they are supposed to be barking at.

I always thought that he was a newfoundland/border collie mix but after the test I found out that he is a Shepherd/Golden Retriever mix. I did the tests 1 month apart and found that they both agreed on his genetic make up. I wish I had done this when he was a pup (now he is 5) because I would have trained him to do different things. He is a certified therapy dog and obedience trained. I would have trained him to do search and rescue, but thinking he was a Newfie, I did not pursue it. I would recommend the Canine Heritage test if you suspect that your pup is made up of common breeds. It is cheaper and you can do it yourself with a cheek swab. The Wisdom Panel is more expensive and requires a blood draw from your vet. Either way, I would have done it again. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  The picture to the left is my boy.|`|WWYfEX2haa	I've never had one done on a dog - but we got one done on a cat once.

tMtBe1lKaa	glass shops or large lumber type stores like home depot or diamond have plexiglass. You can get it in different thicknesses and cut it to fit your tank. It's way cheaper than getting the tops from aquarium places, and it's easy to drill holes where your tubes go. for a small tank like a 10 gal, go to the glass/window store first as they probably have left over peices cheap and will cut them to your specs. good luck.|`|YnCUyvK7aa	Lowes or Home Depot would have this.

If there isn't 1 in the size you need, you can have it cut there, or do it yourself.<br>  <br>  Just a piece of advice, get a sheet a little thicker than you think you actually need.  The acrylic will bow over time if there's no center support if the tank you're covering is 24 inches or more.

qjFu9SjKaa	Hi there--<br>  You'd didn't say he age-if it is 6 and above i think you should just keep one till he passes away and then you can get another pair,<br>  It isn't easy to introduce a new guinea pig,<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	I would say go for it, especially as you are talking about rescuing. You save another life, give your pig the companionship he needs... it's all good!<br>  <br>  Introducing males can be tricky as they are more territorial than females, so it is important you get it right.<br>  <br>  Firstly, you need to be sure you have a cage big enough for two males. Obviously your two got along okay, but the cage may be too small for unfamiliar boys. I would go for at least 10.5 sq feet - but definately the biggest you can. Lack of space is one of the most common causes of fighting.<br>  <br>  Within the cage you need at least one hidey per pig. It can help to use hideys with two exits (eg large tunnels, or carbdoard boxes with two holes cut in them) so one pig can not corner the other. It might also help to have two food bowls, two water bottles etc at opposite ends of the cage.<br>  <br>  When you introduce guinea pigs it must be on neutral territory, eg on the floor. Put some veggies down to distract them, put them together and watch what happens.<br>  <br>  If they seem ok you can then cage them together. (The cage must also be neutral - if you put a new pig into your current pigs cage he will fight to defend his territory from the intruder). You could buy a new large cage, or you will need to thoroughly clean the one you have before putting the pigs together in it.<br>  <br>  Please don't make the mistake of putting the pigs together for a while, then separating, then trying again repeatedly. This actually makes things worse as the pigs have to re-establish dominance every time.<br>  <br>  It is also important to understand the difference between normal dominance behaviours and true fighting.<br>  All new pigs will squabble at first to establish dominance. You might notice chasing, squeeking, mounting, nose-butting and rumblestrutting. This is all completely normal. Just let them get on with it - they will settle down once they have decided who is boss.<br>  Proper fighting is far more serious as they will actually be trying to harm eachother. As a general rule you should only separate them if blood is drawn.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Sorry about your loss, but good luck and thanks for rescuing!|`|YpEswTQdaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  As long as the 'new' male is younger,say 4-12 weeks old they should have a very high chance of getting along. After 12 weeks old,most WILL get on however some are less likely too. Rescuing is a great idea too! Guinea Pigs are naturally gregarious creatures living in large 'herds'.<br>  <br>  I am sorry for your recent loss,best wishes.xxx|`|wsLngQ8oaa	Yeah that's a rough one. Basically the one word answer would be yes you should get another piggy. The rest of it is where it gets complicated. Because you have a male. You're probably experienced and realize that getting another male could result in fighting for dominance. So you could add another male, and watch them closely. if they fight, you'll have to get them fixed, because then they won't fight for dominance anymore. Another option, which would be less expensive, is get the boy you have now fixed, and add a female. Then there's no fight for dominance. Don't know if I was any help but there it is|`|vY1dS3hUaa	Hi!  I must say, I love the fact that you rescue them.  That's where I got my Joey (guinea pig).<br>  As long as your old one isn't acting weird or depressed, it isn't a dire emergency, but I'd get another one anyway.  I mean really; you can never have enough piggies!<br>  Good luck
BXHfVkaJaa	We all have heard of paranormal activity (a.k.a ghosts/spirits) Even dogs. And just like children pets can sense spirits. Though its hard to prove since their is no scientific evidence . There are many experiences that are unexplained at this time. We are all aware that dogs have keener hearing and a much more highly developed sense of smell than humans do. Is it possible that they have the ability to hear sounds that emanate from the spirit world?Then again maybe dogs have a different way of sensing the supernatural. They might "feel" the energy of ghostly ones. It is a known fact that animals can sense weather related incidents prior to their occurrence. Animals have been known to predict earthquakes and other impending disasters. Odd behavior from household pets and livestock are often noted by their human counterparts before the event takes place. Perhaps dogs can pick up on electrical impulses of the earth and the supernatural as well.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Dogs can sense spirits, and bad people and some can detect cancer, and find drugs, they have stronger sense than we do.  We had a corner of our house, and our dog, Abbey would never go near that corner of the house.  If we threw the ball there, she would stop playing with us.  I had a horse that would gallop every time we passed my great grandparents house.  When the house burned to the ground, the horse was fine.|`|GaL66jbQaa	is it all grave yards or just that one|`|D75rqaihaa	there probably right...<br>  apparently dogs can see ghosts and spirits e.c.t, so they know when theres dead people around...you probably wont beleive this as many people dont, but i swear its true..<br>  <br>  my aunt died and we took in her dog, now she used to live about 8 miles from me, and often the dog runs away...where do we find it? sitting at her grave!<br>  he knows...and its so sad...plus its really hard to get him away...but we know where he goes..and many people know about him so they just leave him...but isnt that amazing? he didnt see her gettin buried or anything so he hasnt a clue its her...or does he???|`|QgEqGDjZaa	yes my bichon frise did that he would get all scared and chew the lesh of and run home. its just their scared of the spirits|`|Rpj9qArgaa	She is not "afraid" of graveyards........She is OVERWHELMED!!<br>  So much to choose from........LOL<br>  <br>  Happy now?|`|GaLw1qMwaa	its the spirits.
IfCoalbvaa	Is that the only time you have ridden her after you bought her? I would trailer her to your trainer and have her take a look. <br>  <br>  I have a few questions that could help me answers your question better;<br>  When you first rode her, did you ride in an arena?<br>  Do you have an arena? or do you just trail ride?<br>  If shes a horse that's mainly done rail work in an arena, and you rode her in an outdoor arena or on a trail that could be it. Horses that never get to be worked outside sometimes are very skittish when you do work/ride them outside. Horses are fight or flight animals so if she was scared of something like a tree, or the wind that could be why she bolted.<br>  The reason im asking this is because you said you will be riding her on your property, which leads me to think you will be doing trail rides and such.|`|meoRbjgCaa	You should both sell her and have your trainer asses her.  Have your trainer assess her to determine what her level is so that you can accurately represent your horse to a potential buyer and the cycle doesn't repeat itself (for the horses sake).  I always recommend a teenage to early twenties (depending on the shape of the horse) for beginners because these horses are so knowledgeable and set in their training(provided they were well trained to begin with!).  Somebody else has already ridden through the bucks, bolts, spooks, and other various naughty behavior so that you don't have to subject your own bones!  My husband is a beginner and I got him a 15 year old ex-barrel racing quarter.  We just trail ride, but it was the best decision I ever made!  He loves him, and the horse takes good care of my husband, I would recommend a similar scenario in order for you to enjoy riding.  I know you probably don't want to put too much money/effort into your current horse if you don't intend to keep her but as the current owner you have a responsibility to your horse to accurately represent her in order to find her a home that wants her for her abilities and training level.  Good luck.|`|d5c5079cce04b42e4018f3cce72b99f2aa	As a beginner, you should never ever ride alone.  It's not even a good idea for more advanced people, but especially for a beginner, it' downright dangerous.  Stepping down off the soapbox now...<br>  <br>  I wouldn't sell her without having your instructor assess her.  There a lots of factors that could have caused her to bolt.  Temperment - what kind of temperment does she have?  What's her breeding?  Does her pedigree indicate that she'd be likely be a bolter or a fuss budget? It's also possible that she was in heat and mares frequently get pissy (just like humans) at their "time of the month." <br>  <br>  I don't know how old she is, but it sounds like she's probably not more than 5 or so.  Talk to your instructor have her take a look see at this mare, talk to other people whose opinions you value and see what they think.<br>  <br>  If you decide to keep her and put her in training, talk to your instructor about giving you your lessons on her rather than a school horse.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|UcMCdlJSaa	I had a horse do that to me. but i still have him. if i were you i would try riding her again. my horse that did that has to have a person with lots of confidence. my horses first problem was he still had his wolf teeth that should have been removed awhile back so check and see if any of her teeth are infected. and try riding her again. try not to have to sell her because she could probably be a good horse with a bit of work.|`|Q8Sv4V48aa	Yes, you shouldn't ride or own a horse that scares you. You can get some good horses that are suitable for beginners for like $1000 or less. I know it's a hard decision to make because I just had to give my horse away for a different reason, but you shouldn't have to ride a horse that scares you.|`|RloOJ43haa	Have your instructor look at the horse to see if she sees any potential for her to be a good match for you. If she still thinks that this horse is not a good match, then you should listen to her and try to get something else. An older horse is usually better for a new rider.|`|eXDDODfHaa	thats a good age for a horse it might be better to get an older one<br>  u had him for a week u need to spend more time and gain her trust...ALWAYS GET BACK ON A HORSE WHEN U GET BUCKED OFF<br>  i dont think u should sell her|`|eL268hETaa	Oh dear.  Dont sell a horse just because you fell off once.  She was testing you to see what she can get away with.  Horses are extremely perceptive, and if they don't believe you are the Alpha leader, then you won't be treated as one.  Perhaps you're the one who needs the training, not the horse!  Any horse from anywhere with any bloodlines will try to test an unskilled rider.|`|CIlaxaNvaa	If you really believe that your horse is a bad horse for you at a beginner level, then you should find a good owner first, then sell, for the price you bought him/her for.|`|2fkM3gQ7aa	im not trying to put down on any bloodline but i have had experience with impressive bred horses and they tend to be unpredictable most of the time, one day she may be fine the next she could be insane im just not sure if i would keep her with my experiences. and you being a beginner i would go with and older been there done that horse and stay away from most halter blood. im not saying all are unpredictable but they do tend to be..stick with old foundation bloodlines if you buy a QH or Paint. i wouldnt reccomend the Hankcock bloodline though they tend to be coldbacked...anywho i hope you make the right and smart decision...|`|nDkseOLCaa	you know any horse needs time to settle in to new suroundings,just take it slow with her if you love her then the trust you will gain from her by being patient will be great. i know how hard it is wen you lose your confidenc i broke one off mine about 9 years ago now but he threw me,no fault of his the lad i was with cracked a whip behind he went sick on me i fell off under him and he came on top me with his feet,ouch!! i fractured my pelvis. anyway it scared me but i kept him for another 3 yr,but it wasnt fair as coudnt bring him on to the best of his abilaty,he was a 15'3 irish gypsey cob.but over the years iv slowly got my nerves back with riding and 2yr 3 mnth ago i got myself another youngster he is a lovely black dales cob,so much calmer and trust me totally,he thinks im a horse like him.lol. anyway i think you should work out if you have true feelings for this horse?if you dont then sell it as it will pick up on this,if you do then surely its worth taking your time with,walk it out get it used to its suroundings and the sound of your voice,the feel of your hands on the halter,then wen you do mount at least will know the tone of your voice and what you are asking of him. i dont think it would be fair for you to load him up take him another place strange then back to where he came from after being messed about with,if he came from a dealer how many homes has he been to already that he thaught he could trust???? please just give it time you never know you could have the rest of your lives together. x good luck sweetheart.|`|otojKoEkaa	The horse was probably drugged when you rode her or you have just really changed her lifestyle and she has alot of extra energy. Some things you should consider are calling the person you bought her from and see what she was used to eating and how much turnout she got. <br>  When you rode her did u ride her in the saddle she bolted in? Her saddle could be hurting her.<br>  <br>  Also did you ever get a vet check. Their could easily and probably most likely be an underlying problem and the horse is in pain.<br>  <br>  I would have her fully assessed by a vet, as well as your trainer. You should get base line xray too just so you know what your working with. I know it is expensive but well worth it.<br>  <br>  I dont think you should give up and sell her. I would invest in training and a post vet check.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|xZ3jhIjYaa	I would try riding her again and see how she does... and definitly before you decide to seller trailer her in and have a lesson on her with your instructor and let your instructor evaluate her.... it may just be that she needs a little bit more training and then you'll have a really great horse. Also whenever you rode her before you bought her did you ride her indoors or out? and at your house do you ride indoors or out? if you rode her indoors first and then outside at your house that could explain it alot of horses will act differently when their outside cause their in the "fresh" air and everything else... you could also try lunging her before you ride her and see how she does. I know this isn't part of your question but you mentioned that she's a quarter horse out of impressive. I didn't know if you were aware of HYPPand if you knew if your horse was positive for it or not. You may want to check that out if you haven't already.<br>  <br>  I also have ridden a horse out of Impressive and she was not "crazy" nor "unpredictable" she was one of the best horses I have ever rode and was a very good show and trail horse. Don't sell this horse just because it has Impressive|`|xadlDnegaa	i would find someone who is an intermediate/advanced rider to come out and ride her and work with her.  You can post an ad like on craigslist, or in the newspaper.  you wont have to pay and you can watch while they ride.  i am currently doing this right now with a STUBBORN horse.  I have seen so much improvement and so has her owner.  I would definitely try this before you sell or trade her.  If your going to do this make sure you have the person sign a release form so that you are not responsible for any injuries.  good luck!!!

SZOMVGBRaa	Like ksilver said they are meat eaters, they won't benefit from eating any kinda veggies at all. In fact they most likely won't even touch it. They may look like pleco's and other veggies eating catfish but don't think of them this way. Think of them as a mini school of piranhas that look like catfish. Good Luck|`|tShDXmgbaa	zucchini or cucumbers will do it to name a few.|`|BMri9tITaa	They're not really big vegetable eaters.  They're very carnivorous.  Sometimes they'll nibble on algae, but for the most part, they're strict meat-eaters.  I learned this the hard way: my corys nearly starved to death before I bought sinking meat pellets for them instead.<br>  <br>  Brine shrimp make a nice treat, though.|`|Fx9bxZ8aaa	they are not vegetarians but they still might like cucumbers but they will prefer some sort of meat pellets because they are carnivores and they don't like vegetables as much as they like meat.but brine shrimp will make a nice treat for them.
LSz1IT6Eaa	I was a firm believer in preventative meds such as Frontline. Over the last 3 years I have changed my thoughts after listening to what many breeders had to say on the subject.<br>  <br>  I now check my dogs often for any fleas/ticks. I remove the ticks (hopefully before they attach) and if I see any fleas, at that time I will apply Frontline. In the last 3 years, I have only had to do this twice, even with living out in the country and having 3 adopted outdoor cats that are always rubbing up against our dogs, we have not had fleas and only a few ticks. That is alot of flea/tick meds that I didn't have to use, thus alot of poisons that my dogs did not have to absorb into their systems. The thought on this is even though it is safe to use this type of preventative meds, just how healthy is it for our dogs in the long run to be absorbing this type of poison into their bodies on a monthly basis, year after year. <br>  <br>  A few of us live in areas where fleas abound and some may hardly ever see a flea, so everyones situation is different. For those of us that don't have infestation problems, do we really need to expose our dogs to these poisons on a monthly basis?<br>  <br>  One of my dogs littermate died shortly after he was brought to his new home. There is no definite proof, but it was thought that he probably died from the flea and tick medication that was applied a couple of days before his death. He was only 3 months old. My breeder doesn't like giving any flea meds period, especially on the younger dogs.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying anyone is wrong or a bad dog owner for using the preventative medications as directed. I just never realized that I could still control the flea problem without using them monthly.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	It depends on what things are like where you live for fleas and ticks. After the initial few treatments which got rid of the fleas, I have only treated when I see a flea or evidence of them on any of my pets, which averages about once a year. There must be ticks where I live since there are deer, but it's been years since I saw one on my dogs. I think if I found more than two ticks a year on a dog, I'd use a tick preventative especially in spring and early summer when they seem most. And the stuff isn't really very expensive, no more than buying dog treats maybe. I've also found that in spite of the directions saying to use a whole tube, a few drops is quite enough unless you have a really huge dog. A tube of the stuff lasts me about 2 years for 2 dogs. Not a lot of money, and certainly a cheaper way to control fleas than baths, powders, sprays, and constant vacuuming.|`|oGVWdnHraa	It depends on where you live....if you have no fleas or ticks, then theres no point, my aunty and uncle have 2 dalmations, they never use frontline on them and they are flea  and tick free :D|`|KxjUim7yaa	I use Revolution. It is for heartworm,fleas,ticks,protects against mange and ear mites and some worms. It is approved by my vet if the dog is always treated and has the annual heartworm blood test. A dog should always be protected from fleas. They can pick them up anywhere, and I think the most likely place is the vet's office.It can be purchased online without a prescription.<br>  <br>  Many of the health problems people have with their dogs could be prevented with proper flea control.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Fleas can be a real annoyance and a health hazard--if your dog gets fleas & infests the house, it's not fun.  Tick protection is necessary, tick-borne diseases like Lyme, Erlichia, Babesiosis  and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever can cause organ failure and possibly kill a dog if untreated.  You may live in an area with fewer ticks than in other areas, but it still isn't worth the risk to your dog's health.

Dogs pick them up easily.. and honestly prevention is better than treating the infestation later.  Those tubes of advantage seem costly, but I've seen people spend much more later when they end up buying foggers, yard treatment, flea collars, shampoos, etc in an attempt to get rid of the fleas.<br>  <br>  They are not necessary all year round, just during the months when fleas are about.<br>  <br>  I dont treat my hairless dog.. he just doesnt pick them up.  I keep the cats inside, so they dont get fleas.. I only have to treat my cousin's dog (the dog is staying here while my cousin is in college)..  I had to treat my cats when my cousin's dog first came here because she had fleas.<br>  <br>  if you have multiple dogs/cats.. you may be able to get the dosage for larger dogs and split it up..  I have done this for my pets and my parents..  <a href="http://www.lisaviolet.com/cathouse/advantage.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisaviolet.com/cathouse/advan...</a>  Do make sure that you use the proper product, expecially if you are also treating cats.|`|V5Ib9BCsaa	alot of the flea and tick preventatives arent good for your dog and can get very expensive. i have found a cheap and natural spray that works great. its a couple drops of lavender and ceder wood essential oils. both will cost $15 together. they work great. also a but of minced garlic in there food will help fleas and ticks too. the best and cheapest flea shampoo is dawn dish soap. i even had a vet tell me that. so dont go totally without jsut go cheaper. it works jsut as good. and if you get fleas in your ouch, bed or carpet it is safe to spray on them too.|`|qAZCZtDeaa	well i guess they COULD go without...the medicine just helps to reduce the chance that they will get fleas/ticks. but im pretty sure my vet said that u dont need to give it to them in the winter cause they dont really need it then, but im not positive. so i guess it wouldnt hurt anything to not give it to them, but deffinatly do something if your pet does get fleas/ticks.    p.s. we usually forget to give the medicine to our dogs anyways and they're okay!! lol|`|XpEQBuQ0aa	well they can go without it but they could get fleas or ticks witch would be VERY annoying to you and to the dog if they got a tick or a fleas. But it is not a MUST but its better to be safe than sorry! <br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|HgMFrllLaa	My girl is on year round Revolution. IMHO, it's worth it.<br>  (despite what others may think)|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	I strongly recommend it. My dogs are always on advantage. When they do get fleas, its extremely hard to get ride of the flea larvae stages, and advantage is one product that is guarantees that it kills it. Within 12 hours it can kill 99-100% off the fleas. If your dog gets bitten too much or eats too many it can cause tapeworms which could be fatal. In Canada our winters are extremal cold, so if money is a factor they can be off it for a few months. I would strongly recommend your dog being on it during flea/tick season which is early spring to early december. Flea collars and shampoos are a waste of money. I would only consider flea shampoo as a second method. Indoor dogs, don't matter. One shot is all it takes.|`|pMtMsbBnaa	My vet basically said that while heartworm protection is very neccessary, flea and tick prevention is a little more optional.  For example, if you live in an area where you have a harsh and long winter (like we do here in Wisconsin), chances are very slim that any fleas or ticks will be around outside when everything is dead.  However, during the spring, summer, and fall, you are taking more of a risk by not protecting your dog.  Plus, if your dog does get fleas, I've heard it's a HUGE pain to deal with....imagine all the things you have to wash/disinfect etc.  And the fact that ticks can carry diseases, you have to consider that too.  So basically, I personally don't have my dog on flea and tick protection during the winter but I do for the rest of the year.  That way you're at least saving a little money.|`|uTIgyCCHaa	I'm not currently using it.  I agree with you in it being unnecessary if the dog isn't exposed to fleas/ticks, and also, I question how safe it is.  Even though many pets do just fine on preventatives like Frontline, it is STILL a chemical, an insecticide, that your are putting on the dog's skin.  There is always a risk of adverse reaction.  I have used Frontline on my dogs, but only in cases where I thought it was absolutely necessary -- we found a few fleas on one of my dogs a few months ago and then found out she is allergic to fleas.  The fleas are gone now though, and haven't had to use the stuff since.<br>  <br>  I have been looking into this stuff to try next for my dogs.  It seems to be a much more natural approach to flea prevention, and it has added health benefits for dogs AND humans when taken as a daily supplement.  Plus, it's really cheap and lasts for a LONG time.<br>  <a href="http://www.foodgradede.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodgradede.com/</a><br>  <br>  As far as ticks, I rarely see them where I live.  We take occasional weekend trips to the mountains, but even there I don't see a whole lot of ticks; plus, if either dog gets one, they're easy to spot on my boxers' short coats.

It is very frustrating, and when you get frustrated, he will not be in the right mind to work.  <br>  <br>  I would keep him on a harness, and leash all the time.  That way he will have your attention all the time.  Does he like treats?  What ever his favorite treat is, use that to get his attention.  Usually warm hot dogs make the perfect treat. <br>  <br>  His snapping at you is one of the first issues you need to work on.  I've never had to deal with that, but you must firmly say NO to this and give a tug on the leash.  Take him out of the room when he does this and give him a time out.  Bring him back in the room and see what happens.  Dogs don't like to be alone, they want to be with their pack.  But you must be dominate over this dog.  Never swat at him or hit him with any object.  But most of all get into dog obedience classes, it will teach you how to handle these things.  Good luck
HgMFrllLaa	I wanna be the first one to line up for the champion UBD (long haired)<br>  Providing of course it's the cutest breed ever!<br>  Late Entry : Hello St.Lady :))) Long time no see :))))|`|2G6b5y8Taa	it don't matter whether a dog is pure breed or a mutts they are just as cute i have several pure breed dogs(pit bulls,labs,English setter,blue heeler,rat terrier and chihuahua) and several mutts(shih tuz/yorki mix and shih tuz/poodle mix) it don't matter all it is is a piece of paper that gets you more money for the puppy's and some how gives you the right to breed the pure breed when ever you feel fit its still over populating trust me i love my pure bred dogs and much as my mutts  to me it don't matter as long as the dogs have homes it dont matter what they are|`|LSz1IT6Eaa	Are you trying to get us riled up here?

I suggest that for the next couple of weeks you keep things low key and positive. Then you can start letting him play with dogs again. But make sure that this is stress and not caused by pain.|`|HgMFrllLaa	Your dog may be in pain. Probably most frequent cause for aggression.|`|KuUx34hCaa	i am sorry what is op
YnCUyvK7aa	I started a few saltwater tanks as invertebrate only tanks.  And while I haven't done it for freshwater, there's no reason why you couldn't.<br>  <br>  For a saltwater tank, I would suggest plenty of live rock [you'll get sponges, tube worms, shrimp, and other small invertebrates living on it], plus you can add some hermit crabs, snails, shrimp, feather dusters, a brittlestar, or even corals, anemones, or clams if you're able to get the type of lighting they need.<br>  <br>  For a freshwater tank, there are snails, shrimp, clams, and crayfish.  A crayfish might eat the others, so you have to do some research about each animal and watch what you put together [but the same goes for saltwater].  Also, for freshwater, you have to see if they are compatible by their living requirements.  Some might need higher pH, salinity, or hardness than others, so you don't want to put together 2 animals with very different needs.<br>  <br>  Here is a website where you can see what marine and freshwater inverts are commonly sold.  <a href="http://www.liveaquaria.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.liveaquaria.com/</a><br>  <br>  And some places where you can research their needs a little.  <a href="http://www.petshrimp.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petshrimp.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theshrimpfarm.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theshrimpfarm.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.planetinverts.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.planetinverts.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sydneycichlid.com/aquarium-snail.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sydneycichlid.com/aquarium-sn...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.applesnail.net/content/multi_languages/english.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.applesnail.net/content/multi_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wetwebmedia.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wetwebmedia.com/</a> - both freshwater and marine<br>  <a href="http://saltaquarium.about.com/od/azinvertebratefamilyp/Invertebrates_Care_Information_Profiles_Pictures.htm" rel="nofollow">http://saltaquarium.about.com/od/azinver...</a>|`|ur5wDhkMaa	It would depend on what your community fish are.<br>  <br>  Shrimps have to be big enough not to be eaten and they are often sold extremely small.

I've got Amano shrimp and I wouldn't recommend them. They are great cleaners, but you hardly ever see them.<br>  <br>  There's limitations in choice, but you can definitely have invertebrates.|`|SZOMVGBRaa	You can if you keep the smaller shrimp like Cherry's and Amanos and Bamboo shrimp together. You can't keep Crayfish and the smaller shrimp together however like the first person suggested, That would be a waste of money as crayfish are predators and would eat evey last one of the smaller shrimp over time.  <br>  <br>  Stay away from ghost shrimp as well, they are small but are more prone to eating other shrimp as well. Just start off by goggling the three I listed and see how you do. Good Luck|`|STPiIY8uaa	get cherry shrimp and ghost shrimp lol they are awsome|`|tShDXmgbaa	Yes you can.

61mSBfrSaa	Ya somedogs are just like that, just like how somepeople can eat anything without gaining a pound !<br>  <br>  I would stick with dry food since they are generally higher in fat than wet/canned food.<br>  <br>  There are foods out there for active dogs that are higher in calories. <br>  Puppy food is also much high in calories than "regular" adult food. You may have to suffer through a bit of trial and error to find one that your dog will like. Sometimes (especially if you by food from your vet) they will have dog food samples you can try.<br>  <br>  My best friend had a boarder collie that was exactly like that...never ate anything and was really picky about what he did eat...she fed him puppy food. He didn't gain a lot of weight but enough that he wasn't a skeleton anymore !<br>  <br>  Work with your vet and keep a close eye on her. Good luck|`|d5c5079cce04b42e4018f3cce72b99f2aa	If you have a natural pet food store near you I highly recommend you visit there with your dog and speak to either the owner or one of the employees.  Let me tell you there are so many different good foods out there, the choices are mind boggling.  If you're concerned about your dog getting too little nutrition while you're trying to find a food she likes, call your vet and ask about getting a couple tubes of Nutrical.  It's a palatable (at least most dogs like it) and it's high in calories.|`|KxjUim7yaa	You picked 2 of the worst foods. Put her on a grain free food like Solid Gold Barking at the Moon.

How does her coat look and feel?<br>  I have a 2 year old Alaskan Malamute who is totally opposite, she is very food aggressive, I mean it's like her brain shuts down when she sees or smells food. We have had her since she was 9wks old and I thought by now she would have changed, she has, she has gotten worse,but I notice that when she has something she really likes, she will attack if we try and touch it, she never has had any competition when it comes to her food, she is the only dog. Anyway, chicken is one of her favorite foods, oh yeah we can't eat without  her trying to take if from us. then the fight is on.<br>  Try giving her leftovers mixed with her dry food I used to add warm water to soften it and warm it up when she isn't feeling well. use gravy and bland sauces also, it might start her wanting to eat again. Maybe she is bored with her regular diet, try something different, you can always go back slowly, you're main concern right now is to put weight on her.|`|UaQoFCxCaa	Oddly enough, I have a 1.5 year old female sibe who did the exact same thing, and it was with Purina as well.  She will eat Beneful (as long as she sees the others do it first), and she will eat Kibbles and Bits OK, but is still not a huge eater.  I think you will just have to try some different foods.  You may even ask your vet if she can have some puppy food, it will fatten her up faster and I know mine in particular loves it because she tries to take it away from the puppy.  Anyway, I had to switch the foods a couple of times but the Beneful seems to be her favorite.  (Also, when she visits my mom's dogs and sees them eating Purina, she all of a sudden loves it but won't eat it at my house.)  Go figure.  They are funny dogs.

However, sometimes animals are just strange, he may never really like you. If he is really depressed, I would recommend getting him toys or a another bird as a friend. Try taking him to the sink with the water running lightly and see if he likes to take baths. Mirrors can be stimulating for birds, or toys that are "bird" like.

Uy79dKEmaa	You are probably a little allergic to cat dander.  I have the same problem, and I've found a solution that works for me.  Maybe it will work for you too.<br>  <br>  First, I take a Claritin before bed each night.  This keep me from waking up in the morning with a runny nose and itchy eyes.  It also lasts for 24 hours, so it prevents symptoms for the whole day too.  Claritin is available as a generic now (called loratadine) which is much more affordable than the name brand.  Claritin is completely non-drowsy and doesn't make me feel sleepy or "weird" at all.<br>  <br>  Second I use Nasonex spray every morning.  This is more for other seasonal allergies (hay fever), but I do think it contributes to preventing cat allergies too.  This is only available by prescription and a generic form is not available.  I've tried the other brands/types of sprays, but for me Nasonex is the one that really works.<br>  <br>  For you, I would suggest just trying the Claritin and see if that helps.  If not, you can talk to your doctor about other allergy meds.  There are SO many that I'm sure you would find one that works for you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|LURQBU86aa	I have been allergic to cats all my life and I currently have two, and I wouldn't give them up for the world. Some precautions I take is after I pet them I try not to touch my face, and I try to wash my hands off as well ( although I usually am cuddling them too much). Try and keep the cat from sleeping on your pillow or anything that's near your face. I am also on an over the counter allergy medication(zyrtec) that helps with my allergies as well. You can also go to your doctor and get allergy injections as well.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi the best way to take care of allergies with cats is to bathe them frequently but you need to have a shampoo with conditioner so they do not get too dry skin.  Vets usually have this shampoo there.  Also you will need to vacuum every day wherever the cat goes and sets.  You can also get a air purifier to assist with the air.  And lastly if these don't work and they should you can take allergy medication across the counter but be careful as some people do not tolerate it well.  You would want to get the brands that are drowsy free.  But frequent housecleaning mopping, vacuuming, dusting will definitely help.  And of course the bathing.  I know they say not to bathe cats much but if you can get a good shampoo at the vets you will be fine.  The people I know that have had allergies to cats have been doing fine with these things.|`|FQyeGsIyaa	Yes, you could be allergic to your cat.  Over time, the allergens build up in your house and that might be why you're having symptoms now.<br>  <br>  There isn't a cure for allergies, but you can live with your cat.  I have severe allergies and my baby is sitting on my lap as I type this!<br>  <br>  Check out Claritin or Allegra.  They work differently so one may be better for you than the other.  They last for 24 hours and don't cause drowsiness like Benedryl or Zyrtec can.<br>  <br>  If these don't work, see an allergist.  There are prescription medications that can help.  My allergist thinks I'm nuts but I wouldn't give up my baby either!<br>  <br>  There are things you can do to make living with a cat easier. I attached a link with 10 tips - the most important one is to vacuum frequently, preferably with a vac that has a hepa filter.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your little one!|`|3T3KoSmNaa	one word for you reactine works like a charm you can get it at your local pharmacist without a prescription|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Go to an allergist. They can run a test to make sure its your cat that's causing your symptoms and then prescribe allergy meds to help you.
xzJi0bcSaa	If those are your only options, I would suggest having him get used to the colt like you mentioned earlier and teaching him how to work with the colt. I would also maybe put an ad out for a local horse person to help. Im sure there are plenty of people who would be willing and knowledgeable and that would hopefully save on injuries. I work with people horses that dont have the time or the experience to do it themselves and I dont charge much. If you could find someone like that, it might make everyone happier! :) Hope this helps.|`|eXDDODfHaa	yeah its kinda hard <br>  our filly wouldnt let us put her halter on so we had to get her on the ground and be rough with her to get it on.|`|LgocuO1raa	Ahh, this sounds like a difficult situation. =/ You are right, it's not safe..

I had to break one of mine with a longe line, but what I did is hooked the line up to the halter then took the line around the rump between the tail base and the top of the legs, and hold that end in your hand along with the other end about a foot from where it is connected to the halter. Then pull with both ends. The one round the rump of the horse with push him and the one connected to the halter will pull...and just continue with that method until he learns to follow the pull and not the push.....See if your fiance can do that with him....|`|RloOJ43haa	I understand that hiring a trainer would be an expense. But I bet it's pretty cheap compared to the hospital bill you might get landed with if one of your volunteers gets hurt.|`|XJ9oSR2daa	Theres no easy way to do this...<br>  <br>  I hate sending horses off and away for training when I can't keep an eye on them closely for abuse.<br>  <br>  Theres no reason why your bf and mom or you can't go in and do ground work to get the colt to trust you enough that you can come near it and pet its face.  <br>  <br>  Is this horse still a stud?  If anything, I would first get him gelded and chute him to catch him for that and then work on halter afterwards.<br>  <br>  If he is gelded, and with his head shyness, having unknowledgable ppl work with him on halter can only cause more issues for you to work for.<br>  <br>  so you have 2 options, you either work with him, or send him off for training, or just wait until you can which i wouldn't recommend.

Hunter on horseback means jumping.... God are you judgmental. I don't agree with hunting either, but I am a hunter/jumper too.
9Ff4Bms7aa	I'm sorry, it won't be fine.<br>  <br>  Goldfish need 20 gallons of water minimum.  A juvenile goldfish can live in a ten gallon, but only for a while.<br>  <br>  Danios prefer to school, and since they are zippy fish, they need alot of room (20 gallons per school) So....for a ten gallon, none.<br>  <br>  You can maybe try to get some white clouds and see if they school with your danio. They are quite hardy. <br>  <br>  Get a twenty gallon and choose between the two, so pick only one (if you choose a school of zebras, you'll need to twenty).  A black moor goldfish that has strived and lived to it's fullest size will certainly be an eye catcher.<br>  <br>  Or, a school of danios will be very refreshing to look at.<br>  <br>  Additionally, yes, the answer below me gives a very critical point.  Goldfish are coldwater and danios are warm water tropical fish. [Thanks for pointing that out]|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Yes if you want, don't move the tropical fish to a cold water set up. Do you keep the danio without a heater already ? Most of the noobs on here don't know this but Zebra danios can be cold water fish, when acclimated right they can handel temps in the mid 60's and live just fine. I still think he should be in a school but if your not gonna get him friends and your goldfish isn't big enough to eat him then why not. I'm not gonna give you the lecture on goldfish tank size but you know he need a bigger tank.  Good Luck|`|iuFDb1FHaa	no gold fish produce alot of waste and need cold water<br>  but danios need warm water and need to be with 5 or more in a tank|`|GfrZQuMxaa	I'm sorry but absolutely not.  First of all one danio will die unless in a school of at least 6-8.  So thats your first mistake.  Second of all black moors should not be kept in a 10 gallon tank, 20 per fish is the bare minimum, and an additional 10 gallons for every additional moor.  Although danios do stay on the cool side of tropical temperatures the tank will NOT WORK. <br>  <br>  Hopefully you reconsider your tank idea.|`|BMri9tITaa	That would be a terrible combination.  You have one poopy fish, who needs 20 gallons at least in order to grow, in cold water, with a zippy, nippy fish, who needs at least 15 gallons to swim, in warm water.<br>  <br>  They would not mesh well at all.|`|6rRVLHonaa	I doubt if the danio would live very long because it is a tropical fish that likes warm water but it would'nt matter for the goldfish because it likes cold water.
TpfYwYteaa	I live in West Texas and turtles are very much of a childs life here. You don't want a water turtle, unless you have a pond with a pump and recurculation system to keep the water in the pond from becoming statgnent. Bad water conditions will be harmful to your turtles health. Some water turtles  need to eat dead fish when they feed and some water turtles like fresh fish when feeding. They don't require alot of attention other than seeing that they are fed, but only in outdoor conditions. They never live when kept in doors, in small containers.<br>     We always bring Eastern Box turtles home for the kids. They are very social, and can become very tame, even following you around the house. They should be kept in a cage when feeding, or resting. They need a cage with enough material(woodchips) to burral in when sleeping, which they do about 3/4 of their day.they should not be played with when they are hybernating in the winter, or you will need to continue for their care, and upset their natural cycle of life. They will come out occasionally in the winter for short spurts, but don't assume that they are finish. they will become active again about april or may.<br>   Feeding is very simple, buy turtle food from your local pet store, and grind ( a few table spoons of the dry food)  into a vegitable mixer( thawded frozen mixed vegitables), Box turtles like protien, and they luv fruit (bananas, apples, peaches, ect..ect..) Lettuce is not good for them , but they do like it. If you feed them lettuce, only use a good healthy green leaf like spinich, collard greens, ect..) Enjoy your Turtle|`|JQbEE1plaa	I can't answer your question, but please bear in mind that turtles can carry salmonella. That's why some states ban the sale of turtles.|`|hBE2UWOkaa	A stuffed turtle would be the easiest to care for.  No mess, on food, no warmth needs and it will NEVER bite you.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	They ALL are... -But THAT doesn't mean You can, "get them & forget them" !!! Because they ARE so undemanding & easy to take care of, it means they're BEST kept Outdoors, & free to go where they will... -By the way; outdoor turtles have only ONE "Unnatural" Predator...-Lawnmowers !!! So keep THAT in mind- if you decide to get a "Guard-Turtle"- for your Backyard!  :)|`|ZX1nU9Vzaa	My Greek tortoise is incredibly easy to take care of.  I keep him inside the house in a terrarium from about October to March, and he lives outside in our backyard the rest of the year.  He eats vegetables and occasionally we give him fruit.  When he's outside, he eats the grass and dandelion leaves and flowers.
AQsiugSpaa	I am sorry that your cat is in pain.  It is very hard to watch a beloved pet suffer. I wish you had done your research before you subjected her to this very painful procedure which may cause pain in her paws for a long time to come. While I am strongly against declawing, this is not a time for a lecture on the topic... it is time to help your cat now. It is too late for your kitty now.<br>  <br>  I am shocked that your vet did not give you pain medication for your cat. There is nothing over the counter or in your medicine cabinet that you can give your cat for pain control.Human pain meds for cats can be lethal. I suggest you call your vet's office immediately and if it is closed, call an emergency vet service to get some pain medication for your cat, until you can reach your vet tomorrow.<br>  <br>  Of course, since your vet did not provide medication, it might be wise to find another vet asap.<br>  <br>  Use shredded up paper towel in the litter box, as it is much softer to the paws, until you can get Yesterday's News" litter which most veterinarians sell. Do not use regular litter as it is very irritating for post surgery.<br>  <br>  Keep your kitty warm and comfortable and let her rest. Feed her lightly. Beechnut baby turkey and broth and beef and broth are easy to digest, if she is hungry at all.  Of course make sure she has access to fresh clean water.<br>  <br>  By the way, cats generally do not show their pain, as a survival strategy, so if she is displaying pain she is really hurting.<br>  <br>  I do hope that you will take to heart what many of the responders wrote to you about the truth of declawing, and that you will take it to heart, so that if you get another cat in the future you will not subject your kitty to declawing.<br>  <br>  I do hope your kitty gets the professional help she needs quickly, so that her pain is alleviated by the right medication as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Former CFA registered breeder of Siamese and Oriental Shorthairs|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Yes, she's in lots of pain, and will be the rest if her life.

Cats are well known for their ability to hide pain, so if her pain is noticeable to you it must be excruciating for her.  It's urgent that you contact your vet immediately and demand pain relief for her.<br>  <br>  I don't know if you knew anything about declawing prior to the surgery or whether you trusted your vet as a professional to give you good advice, but declawing is understandably classed as animal cruelty in many countries.  It isn't just the removal of their claws, it's actually the amputation of the last joint of their toes.  Since cats are digitgrade animals who walk on their toes, you then get an idea of how painful this is for them.<br>  <br>  I would urge you to consider changing vets in the future, to one who doesn't declaw.  In my opinion, any vet who recommends or condones amputation as a solution to natural behaviour doesn't really have the welfare of the animal at heart.  In an emergency situation I want the reassurance of knowing that my vet cares enough to do the best for my pets and not what's most beneficial to his bank account.<br>  <br>  I sincerely hope that she gets the help she needs.|`|URuzNGcyaa	kitty mauler - no tips for you<br>  <br>  pain meds from the vet|`|G032Flc3aa	Of course she's in a lot of pain and that pain is needless and all down to YOU because you selfishly decided in your infinite wisdom to have her toes amputated. Did the butcher who operated on her not give her pain relief? Did you not research this cruel mutilation before you subjected her to it, did you even ask the vet what it was all about, did you understand that it isn't declawing but amputation of her toes?<br>  <br>  You need more than tips, you are going to need an unlimited supply of kindness and consideration for your cat for the rest of her life. If he becomes aggressive and starts biting it is YOUR fault, if she loses her ability to use her litter tray because of sensitive stumps it is YOUR fault, if she develops joint problems, arthritis or depression that too is YOUR fault.<br>  <br>  Ignore the uneducated fools who think that their cats haven't suffered through declawing.  You should be ashamed to know that what you have done to your cat is banned and considered animal abuse in more civilized countries than the one in which you live.<br>  <br>  Get back to the vet and demand pain relief for that poor cat.|`|gU34xa9vaa	You say your 10 month old cat just got declawed, but she didn't, you got her declawed and now you must watch her suffer. Yes she will be in a lot of pain, the worst pain a cat can suffer, has the vet who mutilated her not even given her any pain killing medication at all ? That figures, as the only vets doing that operation now are just money grabbers.Why oh why didn't you do some research before you did this terrible thing ? There are alternatives as you now know.But it's too late, your cats toes have gone and you can't get them put back. You'll just have to look after her by getting some pain killers from the vet who did this, keep her warm and peaceful, get her the special litter that won't hurt her poor stumps and be kind when she develops behavioural problems such as biting.Remember you did it to her and don't let her end up in a rescue shelter with other declawed cats whose owners have cast them out after doing the worst thing you can do to a cat. Most of all, don't do this to any more cats,while this is still legal.<br>  Roll on the day it's banned worldwide  .....|`|c4dny3nfaa	Man why on earth did you do that to your cat ? Of course she's in a lot of pain the worst pain ever because her toe ends have been took off.You can't make the recovery painless, you can get the vet who did it to give her some stuff to dull the pain thats all but you can't help her poor mind when she realises what's happened to her.Did you even get her a scratching post  man ? Now she's crippled for life its too late. Poor poor cat.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	That's too bad. Hopefully you have pain medication for her... of course it's going to be painful for a while.<br>  <br>  The surgery is basically an American trend, and is considered inhumane and is illegal in many countries, (England, Scotland, Wales, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal, Belgium, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Yugoslavia and Japan).  If that doesn’t impact your opinion about declawing, maybe this website will help you decide: <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a> <br>  <br>  I believe that people who have their cats declawed are uneducated.  It is not very difficult to train your cat to use a scratching post.  The surgery is not simply a trimming of the claws, it’s an amputation of the distal phalanx, including bones, ligaments, and tendons! To remove the claw, the bone, nerve, joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and the extensor and flexor tendons must all be amputated.  If you were to make a comparison, it would be like having the last joint of each of our fingers chopped off.  So of course it is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery.  There are often many complications in the healing process, including infection often from litter box use, resulting in a life-long aversion to the litter box.  Other declawed cats that can no longer mark with their claws, will mark with urine instead, resulting in inappropriate elimination problems.  <br>  <br>  Many cats who have been declawed are traumatized and become withdrawn, nervous, fearful and/or aggressive.  Cats who went through the painful surgery are more prone to resort to biting when they feel threatened.  Since cats have emotional feelings, (just like we do) they can resent you if you decided to get them declawed.  All of these things can cause depression and ultimately lead to an overweight cat.<br>  <br>  If a cat who has been declawed accidentally escapes, he/she would be in great danger.  A cat needs it's claws to defend itself, as well as to escape by climbing.  The constant state of stress, caused by a feeling of defenselessness may make some declawed cats more prone to disease.  Also they cannot stretch their back and shoulder muscles like they do naturally when they dig their claws into a scratching post.  <br>  <br>  <br>  One popular alternative is Soft Paws.  They are lightweight vinyl nail caps that you glue on the cat's front claws.  They're great for households with small children and are extremely useful for people who are away from home all day and can't exercise the watchfulness necessary to train a cat to use a scratching post.  Soft Paws are easy to apply and last about four to six weeks.  They come in clear or colors--which are really fun.<br>  <br>  Most common types of damage are scratched furniture, ripped carpets and shredded wallpaper.  You want to eliminate the problem before it occurs.  Buy or build a stable, tall scratching-post, right from the start.  Here are some tips to do it right: If your cat is scratching your furniture or rugs, here is some advice on training them to use a scratching post:<br>  - The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope, (mine like the carpeted ones)<br>  - Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household <br>  - Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk <br>  - Introduce a new scratching-post with some catnip sprinkled on its surface.  Cats love that and it’s more attractive to them <br>  - If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, say "NO" and gently carry your cat to the desired post.  Demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.  If the cat doesn‘t catch on after trying this repeatedly for a few days, gently pick up his paws rub them along the post.<br>  - Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and plenty of affection.  The cat needs to know that using the scratching post results in positive things such as affection, playing and treats.<br>  - When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>  - Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself <br>  - Try some repellent like pepper-dust or some commercial products on your furniture to keep your cat off these areas<br>  - Be persistent and don't give up too soon<br>  <br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it.

Orthopedic surgeries of all types are very painful.  If your cat was prescribed pain medication, your veterinarian may or may not feel comfortable prescribing more. There are very few safe pain medications for cats which are adequate for the severe pain associated with this type of surgery.  Your cat will be painful, possibly for months depending on her weight. Older, heavier cats experience more pain over a longer time period.  This is an unavoidable consequence.  If her paws or toes appear swollen, red, or have pustular discharge coming from them, she may need antibiotics -an infection will cause more pain. Suggestions such as providing soft places walk may be beneficial, but you can expect some degree of pain at least until the paws heal.<br>  <br>  Natalie Taylor, RVT|`|UpU5eep9aa	As someone else has already pointed out, the cat did not get declawed it was you who caused her to have her toes amputated and that is the cause of the cat's pain and distress now - what YOU chose to do.  You must have read these boards before so you must have known what pain you were subjecting your cat to.  If you claim you did not know then you should be ashamed of yourself for not researching the subject fully and then changing your ill informed mind.<br>  <br>  The damage is done now of course and so you have to do what you can to get immediate pain relief for your cat and you have to study ways of making life acceptable for a handicapped cat from now on and for the rest of her life.  Be prepared for behavioural problems and for illness and muscle problems too, and be warned that she probably will have sensitive stumps for the rest of her life and may start to bite you when you touch her and may stop using her litter box because it hurts too much to scratch in it. .  Above all be kind and gentle to her because all that she is going through is down to you and to the charlaton who calls himself a vet but who should be struck off for animal abuse.|`|mcJvM8Lnaa	OMG! I can't believe people actually do that. Why don't you get a dog and get "it's" vocal cords cut-off so "it" doesn't bark? I don't care what you think, it's animal cruelty to chop off a body part of your pet so it doesn't scratch your furniture, it's not like a castration, that's being responsible, not just cruel and TOTALLY unnecessary.

It happens. <br>  <br>  Do you know how to test your water ? Have you done a water change since you came back ?  If you have a test kit and haven't changed the water yet just test for Ammonia,Nitrite and Nitrate and you will discover why your new fish died. You old fish are used to the water conditions in that tank, the new ones weak and stressed already from the move where shocked into death.<br>  <br>  Which brings me to my next point I always stress about having people watch and feed you fish. NEVER EVER EVER.  See what happened, you tank is now covered in algae, your electric bill is gonna be higher and most likely they over fed causing all you levels to go bad and kill your new fish off.  <br>  <br>  In future all you need to do is feed the fish the day before you leave, do a 50 % water change and gravel vacuum the morning of as close to before you leave as possible and turn the lights off. Fish will be just fine without food and lights for weeks. Vacation feeders and friends and family are sure fire ways to come back to dead fish. They also sell digital timers for your fish tank lights at walmart for about 8 dollars each, invest in one.  <br>  <br>  Sorry for your loss, better luck next time.|`|kQDWVRvzaa	Its sounds like the fish was sick to begin with.

They come in 3 different sizes (toy,mini,normal). They are VERY loyal and super cute! They mostly come in white. I had one since I have been born and he and I had a strong bond and he was protective ( but not aggressive protective). Our dog costed 500 but he was a mini and we got him at a pet shop. They shed in clumps so you casn just pick them up and it's gone. You can also adopt a dog. Most are full grown and love you to death because you are saving their lives. I think adopting is the best way to go and more people should look into it.<br>  <br>  Good-Luck!|`|pmorZA7saa	Try checking out the scottish terrier. Most of the "scotty" looking dogs dont shed!

That way you won't have to worry about a budget and you are helping out an animal that will probably be put to sleep.  Most of the dogs in there used to be cute puppies that people got tired of when they became dogs.|`|juk0m4osaa	Look into an Irish Setter or any dog in the Spaniel family (there are different types), spaniels are medium sized (30-50 pounds) and are great family dogs.

The optimal indoor cage temperature is 75-degrees Farenheit, and bedding should be changed once per week. <br>  <br>  Here are some care guides:<br>  <a href="http://www.essortment.com/all/boxturtlecare_rlno.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.essortment.com/all/boxturtlec...</a><br>  <a href="http://animal-world.com/encyclo/reptiles/turtles/information/boxturtlecare.php" rel="nofollow">http://animal-world.com/encyclo/reptiles...</a>|`|JlQl1HP9aa	if they don't have the same needs. don't house them together. it's good to let them interact but if they have different housing needs you should have separate houses!|`|TpfYwYteaa	Do not use any thing that will dry your turtle out. Use wood chips, news paper shredded, or even a sandy dirt mixture if your cage is kept outside. Try to make a natural material.. Kitty litters are intended to control moisture and will cause you turtle skin to dry out and crack. Also, give your turtle a bath with NO soap, just cool fresh water at least a few times a week, they love it. This will keep them hydrated and healthy
OWIiJMLqaa	I feel very bad for this rabbit. Thinking ahead would have solved this problem before you had a sick rabbit on your hands. You need to make a weather proof shelter for your bunny. You'll need a tarp large enough to cover the cage on top and on 3 sides, a 2x4 piece of lumber the length of his cage, and 14 clothes pins.<br>   Step one: Position the cage so that the front is least likely to have wind and water blow into it.<br>   Step two: Place the 2x4  along the front of the cage on top.<br>   Step three: Cover the cage with the tarp so that only the front is exposed.<br>  Step four: Attach the tarp to the top front of the cage using two clothes pins, then the top back of the cage with two clothes pins; note the tarp should be pulled taut so that the 2x4 creates a pitch where water can't pool on top of the cage, secure the tarp to the sides cage using the remaining clothes pins two on top and two on bottom, then the last two on the back bottom of the cage. This should make it water-proof on top and 3 sides.<br>  <br>  You will need to address his sneezing as well, you'll need some water-soluable antibiotics for him before he gets any sicker.|`|oGVWdnHraa	When you put a tarp over the hutch, pin it down with bricks, and perhaps put a little door on the entrance to the covered part of his hutch so that it doesnt get to draughty for him :)|`|FC5BxnoPaa	Cover his hutch with plywood, put something heavy on it such as bricks if you are worried about wind.

If not, you may need to get them or your rabbit will die in those conditions. <br>  <br>  For warmth, make sure he has a place to go in to stay warm, like a box or something he can get cozy in. Put something in there like blankets or extra hay so he can store body heat to stay warm. <br>  <br>  Rabbits are not supposed to be wet like that, so I suggest you go thoroughly dry him off so he doesn't catch cold and die! <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|7uAV0Phfaa	I know it may seem a little irrelevant to your question, and you may have already considered this, but don't you have a friend you can keep him with just until the weather clears up?<br>  If I find anything that can help, I'll post again later.|`|tJZiAY2zaa	if he was mine, i definitely wouldn't leave him outside. id smuggle him into the house or at least put him in the garage or shed or something :)

CgRGmzxZaa	A playsand and soil mixture is best. It needs to be 50/50. I suggest you also change your vivarium for a tortoise table. You can build them a lovely large tortoise table for as little as ￡10.

RjlBrP98aa	If there is any residue pee, white vinegar will clear up the smell immediately. Use white vinegar to clean out the cage, but make sure to wipe it very clean after because rabbits don't like the smell or taste of vinegar. To get rid of any extra bacteria that may have grown especially in the litter box, while it's wet with the white vinegar, put some hydrogen peroxide on it - it will kill the bacteria and odors left. Then wipe it clean and you should have a smell-free litter box/cage. <br>  <br>  Also, I wouldn't change his food because of something it says it might do. Definitely make sure it is timothy-based and still gives your rabbit the nutrients it needs. There are a lot of bad pellets out there for rabbits, very unhealthy.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|oGVWdnHraa	You should clean his cage every day, and put a tray of baking soda in your room out of his reach :) it acts as an odour absorber :)|`|rQlzfHqraa	Why put up with all that is required to keep a bunny indoors when they love it outdoors in a hutch. Did you ever give thought that to a bunnies nose, we stink. I'm human and I can't stand the smell of any sprays and more than a dab of perfume gets me ill. Our homes, I'll rephrase, most homes have very dirty air.|`|HrdGdiE0aa	Uhh, rabbits smell no madder what. <br>  It's something in there pee. <br>  My live outside problem solved.<br>  Don't say its mean to keep them outside<br>  because that's were wild bunnies live<br>  and they live just fine.|`|4FOD0WGnaa	u could always stick it outside or in a place that it's safe in but a place that people can't smell it. that's wat my friend did when she had a rabbit!|`|6Xc7tOKXaa	I own rabbits and I know what you mean.

Also much some pine smelled wood shavings you can buy at some animal store.|`|knFrwCxcaa	maybe its the food|`|EG00pkrYaa	Bunnies like to have their cages outside the house generally.Keeping its cage outside will make it happy and even solve your problem.I recommend using a bigger cage which has just the type of cozy and dark environment and this might solve the problem|`|rhcPwREEaa	animals like a hare should have the cage cleaned every day. you need keep his cage someplace such as a basement .|`|tJZiAY2zaa	open the window and use an air freshener?
niztxto9aa	Your bp is fine. That is their primary behavior, to coil up and hide. Provide the proper humidity and something for it to nudge against and your snake will shed no problem. Although I don't recommend handling any snake while it's in shed, it will not be aggressive with you. But it is a stressful time for a snake because they are vulnerable. Another thing, if you got your bp from petco/petclub, it's not captive bred. They acquire their snakes from the wild.|`|pY7t0KJIaa	It's very normal. My ball python will just hide in his cave for days at a time. Especially when he's going to shed. They are nocturnal, so you may not see him during the day, but if you know he's going to shed, he will probably not come out at night either.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	Privacy is important when a snake is in shed. When he is ready to physically shed, he will emerge and shed or, he will shed in his hide and then emerge usually to take a drink of water and because he feels better.|`|TpfYwYteaa	your snake is acting normal. When a snake sheds it takes alot out of them, they are almost in a trance like mode, and can become very aggressive at this stage if you try to handle them. The skin will cover your snakes eyes with a cloudy dead skin film. When you try to reach for it it will only see a heat signiture of something coming at it and could strike and possibly bite you pretty deep. I' just leave it alone, and make sure you have something for it to brush against to help in it's shedding of it's skin(small 3-4" dia. wooden tree branch with the bark still on it works well.) they sometimes will need help, buy you using a a soft sponge with water, and wiping skin with it to soften the skin, or require a vet if days and days go by and it has not lost it's skin yet.
GfrZQuMxaa	If you netted the puffer and removed it from the water then that is the problem.  Puffers need to always be in water and you taking it out severely stressed it.<br>  <br>  hope it survives|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Not to sound mean or rude in any way but this is what you did wrong. <br>  <br>  You went out and bought a fish......<br>  <br>  So many things most likely wrong but I will cover the basics. You never for any reason need to clean out a fish tank or remove the fish form his tank. All you need to do is use a gravel vacuum and do a water change. That's it.  Any more than that like draining the tank and refiling the water is gonna be so bad your never gonna be able to keep fish alive, ever. <br>  <br>  Secondly GSP fish are brackish water fish, did you have salt in the water ? Did you put that exact same amount of salt back into the tank before you added the new water and put the fish back in ? Do you even know what I mean when I say brackish water ? <br>  <br>  Third and just to end my misery of talking you can very easy shock a fish in so many different ways when you pull them out of a tank to clean it. Nobody that breeds or keeps fish ever does this, this is a noobs only practice. You see someone say they take their fish out to clean a tank and I will show you someone I don't ever want around fish sorry to say.  <br>  <br>  This guy is most likely a goner, read, learn and RESEARCH before you attempt to keep another fish, <br>  <br>  Good Luck and hope he makes it.|`|dYluozLHaa	omg i have 2 green spotted puffer fish and made the mistake yesterday and changes all the water and they are hiding behind thier rock, idk what to do, one is lying on the bottom and he wont come up and they wont eat,the best thing to do is let him settle in maybe he will live but idk how mine are going to do|`|1D8tMCYIaa	What kind of water did you use? If you used tap water without conditioning it to dechlorinate it, then you you need to put some in immediately or if you don't have any, use bottled water. <br>  <br>  Also, did you check the temperatures of the water in the tank and the water you just put in there?<br>  <br>  A water temp difference can shock the fish and even stress it out so much that it can die. <br>  <br>  <br>  If these things aren't the case, then I'm sorry but I don't know.|`|mnaNKujPaa	I was gutted when my green spotted puffer died. He was such a character! A good way to tell how he felt was to look at his belly - if it went dark he was not good. The fact that your fish is on his back is a bad sign. I don't think there is a great deal you can do - just hope! Good luck|`|jnzSz3tRaa	if you emptied all the water, that was a big no no.  he probably went into shock and might die|`|GIG0nLpVaa	he was a snen!
u7vrul2Faa	Yes that is a positive sign that the meds are effective. Don't pull on the worm let it come out naturally in one piece or it could regrow inside the cat again.|`|VMY7No0eaa	Usually they throw up all the worms in the stomic.<br>  yes this means it is working ..<br>  but be careful not to overdose your cat!|`|0ROOS2G0aa	Your vet should have explained what would happen - basically the worms have been poisoned, they lived in the cat's gut, and so when they die, they are pooped out.<br>  <br>  If, gawd forbid, you are using an over-the-counter dewormer, keep an eye on your cat.  The over-the-counter meds sicken and kill lots of cats every year - your vet carries the good stuff - more money, but a healthy cat.  Always my choice!|`|pmorZA7saa	Yes its working! Be careful not to overdose on the worming stuff. It can be poisonous if overdone. Follow the directions on the package. As far as I know, the wormer will continue working for awhile, so she will continue to poop out the parasites. Sometimes they come out of other bodily parts, like the eyes, throat, nose...yuck!|`|kZ5wWUg2aa	Thats great news! It means the wormers have worked and are killing off the worm's and work eggs. I suggest now that you have found a dead one worm her again in 2 weeks.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	The worms aren't supposed to come out alive.|`|DrYjL5B1aa	when you get your pet dewormed the worms die and then they poop them out.
XJ9oSR2daa	I guess my question would be, if the vet 100% guarenteed for trail, what pain is he in that your worried about?<br>  <br>  You need a good farrier with knowledge of navicular and its treatment and you will have 99% of it rectified.<br>  <br>  Is the horse having pain now?|`|j77Yqrlnaa	My horse has navicular disease, and after a few months off, pads, and corrective angle shoeing, he has been 100% sound. I wouldn't trot on rocks or go up or down really steep hills. My horse can do arena work (w/t/c, pole, ect. I am a lucky one, but now I cannot jump him). I just make sure not to push him so fast and take it slow. One day you might try trail riding with mud. If it was too slippery for him and he comes up lame, then you know. If you are able to step over a small branch, then great. Just try things little by little and see where it goes with him. Pretty soon you'll know his limits (if any for trail riding) and you will be able to make him very comfortable.<br>  <br>  Congrats on your new horse!|`|iz03uvV4aa	The issue with Navicular that alot of buyers and owners seem to forget is that it is "degenerative" - this means it will never get better and only worsen.  SO with that said, its not all bad. With corrective shoeing, light riding and supplements that your vet can prescribe, your horse can live a long and happy life so long as the condition is maintained properly.  Talk to your ferrier and vet and get him on a program with both so he is 100% comfortable.  He should be just fine as long as he is not being used for extensive amounts of work. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congradulations on your new horse!!!!!! =)<br>  <br>  PS) I thought I would include some links with Navicular information for you to check out :) Hope they help!!!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://extension.missouri.edu/xplor/agguides/ansci/g02743.htm" rel="nofollow">http://extension.missouri.edu/xplor/aggu...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.recoveryeq.com/navicular_pro.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.recoveryeq.com/navicular_pro....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://vetmed.illinois.edu/petcolumns/showarticle.cfm?id=28" rel="nofollow">http://vetmed.illinois.edu/petcolumns/sh...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.horses-and-horse-information.com/articles/1000usualsuspect.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.horses-and-horse-information....</a>|`|I6NwduJPaa	My favourite horse ever at my school barn had navicular problems. So i read a TON about it. You can have corrective surgery, though not if its as mild as you say. I read that letting the horses hooves grow back into a more natural shape is really helpful, as apparently they way they're shapped for riding is different that in the wild.|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	I had a mare with Navicular and we had the O shoes and some padding as well. Then we looked into Equine Massage Therapy, that worked wonders as well, because horses with navicular tend to park out straining their muscles and causing more damage.

NBeQyTlMaa	I have a 10 year old female chihuahua, and for the longest time I thought I would eventually get another female chihuahua to be her companion. <br>  <br>  Well, I ended up getting a male one, but when I did more research into it, I found out that often times its best to get them of the opposite sex - especially if both are going to be fixed. I read several articles that said often times two spayed females do not get along with each other.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I got the new puppy Friday, and while my dog is a little jealous, I caught them napping together - she must be coming around!<br>  I know when he gets older they will have lots of fun playing together. By the way - he is a chihuahua/dachshund mix. Very smart, and also a shelter dog. <br>  <br>  Good luck! Hope this helped.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, and if you get the dog fixed early enough (four to five months) and he is raised around female dogs, he will never learn to mark his territory (at least not near to the extent most male dogs do), and he will squat to pee his whole life.<br>  <br>  And it is a myth that boy dogs are harder to train. My female chi that I have had for forever, took several months to potty train. My male puppy now, has only had 2 accidents in the house so far, controls his bladder for 4 to 5 hours at a time, and already knows to sit on command. <br>  <br>  Trainability is about the dogs personality - not the sex of the dog.|`|b9MSOr6laa	unless u want a housefull of chihuahua puppies get a female.|`|Bw18seFqaa	Opposite sex ussually get along best.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	In general (not always) males and females do better together.<br>  There are a lot of chihuahuas and chihuahua mixes in the shelters where I live, so it would be great if you go to a shelter.<br>  <br>  Not sure where you are, but there is also a Chihuahua rescue in Southern California, and probably in other areas, too.<br>  <br>  Take your dog with you to meet the new dog.  Most rescue groups will give you a period of time (like a week) to take the dog home, and see if it does well with your dog.<br>  <br>  When you bring the new dog home, try taking both of them for a walk before you take them in the house.  I find that is the best way for new dogs to meet.|`|W0nd3qF3aa	I got another dog when my other dog was around 2 or so and she abosolutely loves her!

Less jealousy if it is opposite sex.|`|s3FWCRGxaa	id say another female because males tend to be more dominant while females are usually naturally sweeter|`|9kcFo2alaa	either one. Boys can be more aggressive and hard to train and could try to mate with your dog even if they are spayed/ neutered. Girls are easier and better  because they will not mark.I think a girl would be better but either or. I vote a girl! If you get a boy make sure he is neutered. If he is a puppy and not neutered get him neutered. If you get a male dog neutered when they are a puppy they will not mark. Since you want to adopt one from a shelter pick the dog that is right for you not depending on the sex. Pick the one who needs a home and wont be put to sleep. What do you want? If I had to pick I would pick a female though.

JgC9a8m2aa	An animal doesn't have to be from a foreign place to be labeled "exotic," sometimes it's just based on how unusual and/or wild they look. While they might not seem any more exotic than a cat or dog, ferrets are still labeled as an "exotic" pet when it comes to vet care because more schooling/training is involved. In the the vet field, pretty much anything other than a cat, dog, fish, and small birds are labeled as "exotic." Again, it goes back to how much training and specialization is needed to care for the animal.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	To a lot of people, anything other than dog or cat is exotic...I have heard of guinea pigs being referred to as exotics. Ferrets are considered exotic pets sometimes in the UK, but probably mostly because they are used to hunt here rather than as pets...if you had a hawk that wasnt used for hunting that would be exotic to, if it was a falconry hawk it wouldnt be a pet.<br>  <br>  Personally, I see hedgehogs ,sugar gliders, short tailed opossums, things like that, as exotic. No way is a ferret exotic if you ask me. Awesome, fantastic, gorgeous, cute and adorable, but NOT exotic.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	No, they are not really exotic. But pretty cool unique animals.|`|9qn74wi0aa	The term "Exotic" is a Veterinary term <br>  Vets determine what is considered "Exotic" by the amount of coursework they must have to treat that animal. And when they determine what is "exotic" it also determines how much that vet visit costs. "Exotic" pets are charged more per vet visit than a non-exotic<br>  90% of vets specialize in dogs & cats, some will specialize in birds, some in reptiles, others rodents, and still others livestock/farm animals so ANY animal not a dog or cat could be determined "exotic" as specialization in any of the other animal classes is considered advanced/additional course work and isn't covered by most veterinary schools basic curriculum<br>  Ferrets are the 3rd most popular pet in the world #1 dogs #2 cats<br>  So it is hard to see how the 3rd most popular pet is "exotic". Ferrets are not exotic because they come from other countries, there are just as many ferrets breed in the US as there are in any other country (possibly more breed here). Actually ferrets have been domesticated for over 2000+ years and researchers do not know exactly where or from exactly what species they descended from. So using their country of origin to determine "exotic" or not doesn't work. Hedgehogs, groundhogs, corn or king snakes all come from the US and are all considered "exotic" so country of origin is not the issue|`|OrvTG44laa	No, ferrets aren't exotic.  They're really popular here, and have been fully domesticated.  Exotic usually means an unusual pet, like a monkey, a fennec fox or something along those lines.

8cikAYp3aa	I use a boot  lace.  Put the rubber on with the leather tap. Stand on the stirup ( on the floor preferably).  run the boot lace thru the  rubber and pull up.  Its easier to stretch it in that position.  You can put a drop of dish soap on it too, it will make it slide over the metal arch easier|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	Are you trying to put them on when the saddle is on the horse?

You can use a string or something hard to help stretch it.|`|74HBMPduaa	Loop the leather tab around the rubber ring, attach the leather tab to the hook at the bottom of the stirrup and stretch the rubber up over the top hook.  If you are having trouble with this, you may need to consider larger rubber rings.  I don't know if they come in different sizes, but I have never had trouble getting them to fit properly.  <br>  Perhaps you could try setting the stirrup on the floor, stand in it like you were riding, and use your body weight as a counter to hold the stirrup in place while you stretch the rubber.|`|RoPLmd2daa	Are you using the leather tabs along with the rubber bands? If not, try using them, they give you extra room and are safer than just using the bands (which, in some dragging cases, didn't break... you have to use the leather tabs).<br>  <br>  If you're still having problems, it's easier to put them on while they are attached to the saddle, on a horse, with someone sitting in the saddle to provide counterweight (and make sure you don't pull the horse over, lol).
Rw7gi86Naa	There are some who believe that it is all right to feed dog food to cats. There are others who feel that it is all right to feed cat food to dogs. It is time to set the record straight on the nutritional habits of our favorite furry family friends. "Cats are very peculiar in their dietary requirements," says Dr. Allan Paul, small animal Extension veterinarian at the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine at Urbana. "They are not small dogs." <br>  The first major difference between cats and dogs, explains Dr. Paul, is that cats are true carnivores, requiring a diet mainly of meat and meat products. Dogs are omnivores, having the ability to exist on a diet of meat and plant products. <br>  "There are certain nutrients that cats need that can only be found in animal sources," claims Dr. Paul. "Dog foods are higher in grain products and lack some of these essential nutrients." <br>  Taurine is an essential amino acid that is crucial for a cats health and is only found in animal tissues. Without taurine in the diet, cats can experience heart problems, blindness, and respiratory problems. Dr. Paul remarked that the blindness caused by a lack of taurine in the diet was first seen in cats that were fed strictly dog food. <br>  The next nutrient Dr. Paul mentioned was vitamin A. Dogs have the ability to convert beta-kerotene to vitamin A. Cats on the other hand need pre-formed vitamin A in their diet, which can only be found in animal tissues. <br>  Arachidonic acid, a necessary fatty acid, can be synthesized by a dog using linoleic acid. The cat is unable to do this and needs to ingest arachidonic acid in their diet. This, too, can only be found in animal tissues. <br>  Finally, Dr. Paul stated that cats have a much higher protein requirement than dogs because they use protein as an energy source. "Because of all of these differences, you should not feed dog food to your cat," states Dr. Paul. "Because cat food is not formulated for dogs, you should not feed cat food to your dog. If you would like further information on this topic, contact your local veterinarian.|`|A7XV2K3Paa	It's not exactly harmful, but dog food doesn't have as much protein as cat food. Also cat food contains taurine, which if a cat does not have it in its diet, the cat can go blind. Another different is that cats are carnivores and dogs can eat meat and plants. A few nibbles won't hurt as long as kitty eats its own food also. Also, free choice is not necessary for dogs or cats.  Kitty may be just trying out the dog food and this may not last.|`|z2bVBZ7Zaa	no, they can't. here is an informative article on what cats can't eat <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=0+1276&aid=1029" rel="nofollow">http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...</a><br>  <br>  I'm not sure if dogs can't eat cat food, but they probably can't!|`|0jLj7yJpaa	I'm not completely sure, but I would guess it isn't that harmful. The reason dogs can't eat cat food is because of the taurine, but dog food doesn't have that kind of an additive that would make cats sick.|`|SM8a6uOXaa	my dog eats cat food<br>  and my cat eats dog food<br>  they share lol<br>  but my dog doesnt get sick.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Cats should not have dog food.  It's not high enough in either fat nor protein, and it also does not contain taurine, an essential amino acid that cat's bodies cannot produce.  Without taurine, cats will go blind.

He's a great trail horse also, but has been what I call "beginner soured".  Basically, he had had so many beginners yanking on his mouth that he learned to just brace against it and ignore it completely.  What worked for me is working him in the arena at a walk and trot teaching him to bend and flex at the poll in all directions.  I never would pull just tap on the reins until he gave (it took him a little while to figure it out but he did). Once he realized the consistency of soft hands, he was more willing to give his head.  The bit I used was a broken low curb with a shorter shank similar to myler bits.  Hope this helps, it's what worked for me, though I know not all situations are the same.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	try riding him in a hackmore|`|f06Sy0dfaa	To get a softer mouth use a softer bit. Many times the horse is hard in the mouth because they are reacting to hard hands or tough bits. Try some bitless riding as well. Sounds like someone pulled on the horse alot. Also make sure he is not heavy on the forehand. What is his mouth like? Are his teeth good? Are there sores or pulled gums? When where his teeth done? Does he have neck, pole, or back pain? These questions also help in figuring out why a horse may have a hard mouth. A good book is the Myler book for bitting horses. It can help you pick a bit best suited for the fit, shape, level of your horse.<br>  <br>  ~ Rider's hands and how you are using your reins<br>  ~Horse's mouth, get his teeth checked for any pain signs<br>  <br>  Also, remember that a horse's mouth is not hard, instead, the horse grows hostile towards contact and pressure in the mouth because of pulling from hard bits. I suggest going to a Myler company and investing in a Myler. I personally find the Myler Low-Port Comfort bit works well on alot of differant horses, but it really depends on your horse's mouth and whether he has a low or high palette.|`|RloOJ43haa	I don't know that he has a hard mouth. It may just be that he has never been taught to give to rein pressure. <br>  <br>  Start with this exercise - from the saddle or the ground, use the left rein to turn his nose left. Wait for him to give to the pressure. You might have to wait a long time. Keep waiting anyway. When he gives to the pressure, let up and let him go back to center. Ask again - then go to the right several times. Every time he softens to the pressure, you must soften too and give him his reward. This way he will learn that the way to relieve the pressure in his mouth is to give to it. After going left and right take pressure in both reins and hold it until he gives in the poll, then let up. Then he will learn to give to pressure by giving in the poll. Again, when he softens you must soften. Basically, you are teaching him that it is safe to give to the rein pressure because you will get out of his face when he does. Once you can go left, right, and round at the halt, you can do it at the walk, and later the trot.|`|K4bJgTF4aa	don't get a stronger bit.  just ride him with a soft but firm hand.  pull back when he pulls on you other wise keep it soft.  chew with your fingers, but when you want him to stop sit really hard on him and squeeze them mess out of him (don't pull back).  i do this with my jumper (who is very fiery) and it really works.|`|7f7b87fe724d1e602920ec63df5e33a5aa	What kind of bit are you using? <br>  <br>  Most horses are in a simple D-ring snaffle. Which is fine, but if the horse has a low palate, fat tongue, any sort of mouth deformity the "nutcracker" effect of the bit could be causing him pain. <br>  If he is in a shank bit make sure your hands are soft. As above if he has a low palate I would suggest a dog-bone short shank bit. The leverage is a lot less harsh on the horses mouth. The bog bone eliminates the "nutcracker" effect on his tongue. NEVER try to direct rein (2-handed riding) in a shank bit. These bits are designed to be ridden one handed and ONLY should be used on a finished horse. <br>  If he is in a loose ring snaffle (whether french link (3 piece) or a regular snaffle) check to see if the mouthpiece is to thick for his mouth. <br>  <br>  My suggestion is to try a simple egg but french link snaffle, with a thinner mouthpiece (14-16mm) and go back to basics. Lots of transitions, lots of turning, stopping, backing. <br>  <br>  Also don't ride with your hands, ride with your seat and legs and ride the horse back to front.. The softer he is through his body the softer he will be in his mouth.<br>  <br>  Try to get some dressage lessons if you can. They will help immensely with his hard mouth and he will learn to properly use his body.

Fire belly newts can get to 5 inches, and need some room to move. In the wild these newts are largely aquatic, but they should be provided with a land area which they can climb out on to rest and bask. while they don't need a huge tank, keep in mind that the larger the volume of water they live in, the less chance of toxic waste products building up to a harmful level.|`|NzSA6dmyaa	Don't get one they aren’t big enough and don’t give them enough water.

BoagpQnLaa	first you 4get to tell what kind of hamster you have . so i just list the different kind of hamster and there average litter size <br>  <br>  The average litter for Syrians is about 7, but can be as great as 24, which is the maximum number of pups that can be contained in the uterus. Campbell's Dwarf Hamsters tend to have 4 to 8 in a litter but can have up to 14. Winter White Russian Dwarf Hamsters tend to have slightly smaller litters, as do Chinese and Roborovski hamsters.<br>  <br>  <br>   here are tip on what you need to know about pregnant hamster and how to take care of the babies<br>  <br>  <br>  If she's not already in her own cage, give her her own cage.<br>  Try to handle her as little as possible.<br>  Make sure she knows how to use a water bottle. Baby hamsters can drown in water dishes.<br>  Give her fresh veggies as treats.<br>  Give her one piece of dry dog food a day (she will need the protein).<br>  Keep her cage clean as you right before she seems like she can't get any fatter - she is most likely about to give birth and will not let you clean the cage afterwards.<br>  She may be more prone to bite than usual. Make sure anyone who gets near her knows that.<br>  Ask friends and family or local pet stores now about homes for the babies.<br>  <br>  Hamster Hannibal Lector<br>  <br>  It is true that hamster mothers can sometimes eat their own babies. There is some debate as to just why this happens. One theory is that they are starving and eat the closest source of food available. This is one reason why you must give your pregnant hamster the dog food. If the baby is born dead or extremely ill, the mother will eat the baby in order to protect the rest of the group. (A corpse gets smelly and attracts predators). Another reason is self-defense. You must leave the new mother alone with her brood as much as possible for the first week. If she gets scared and thinks a predator is going to attack, she may eat the babies. If it happens, it happens. Try not to beat yourself up over it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hamster mothers will normally eat any afterbirth they produce in order to not have the smell attract any predators. If you see her chomping on something fleshy, don't conclude that it's a baby she's eating.<br>  <br>  <br>  A Week After The Birth<br>  <br>  Now is the time to clean the cage. Carefully remove Mom and kids and place them where you usually place your hamsters when you clean out their cages. Be sure to leave a pinch or two of the old bedding, so it has the scent of home on to reassure Mom that this is indeed Home Sweet Home.<br>  <br>  <br>  The babies will have their fur and start to develop their own personalities. It is especially interesting to watch a whole litter try to use a wheel at the same time! Although first time mothers tend to have smaller litters, hamster can have anywhere from one to twenty babies in a litter. The average seems to be eight.<br>  <br>  <br>  It will be hard, but try to avoid handling the babies. They are very fragile and Mom might still be in an over-protective state. A fall from only a foot can injure or kill them. Now is a great time to get a Zoom lens on your camera!<br>  <br>  <br>  Try not to name the babies if you are planning on giving them away. Naming them will make them closer to your heart. It is in their best interests to give them away if you don't have the space, time or money to keep them. But you don't need to make it any harder on yourself than you need to.<br>  good lucky|`|ak9DrBSwaa	You've done lots of research and haven't come acrossed the average litter size? You may wish to do some more as I wouldn't be confident in information from sites that don't cover this. <br>  <br>  Litter size varies among the different hamster species and you didn't mention which you had.

If you buy from a good breeder you will most likely have to sign a spay/neuter contract.  Do you have any idea what goes into breeding a bulldog?  I absolutely do not recommend breeding bulldogs unless you know what you are doing.  I know you said you want a male, so you do have the easier part but alot goes into studding your dog out.  Does he meet the bulldog standard.  What does he have that would better the breed?  Will he be shown? Will you get OFA, CHIC testing done on him.  There are enough badly bred bulldogs out there, we don't need more. So please reconsider your wanting to breed.   <br>  <br>  I will warn you about the internet.  There are many many puppy importers out there.  You DO NOT want a dog from them.  A good deal on a bulldog is not a good thing.  I would expect to pay at least $2000 from a good breeder.  Do your research on the breeder.  Visit the Bulldog Club of America website, find out if there is a local bulldog club in your area.  I can't stress it enough, do lots and lots of research on your breeder.  <br>  <br>  You will want to visit this "breeder" you found.  You will want to see their kennel or their home where the dogs are kept.  You will want to see both parents.  You want references from previous puppy owners.  You want to talk to them.  You want to talk to their vet.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and seriously I cannot stress enough, reconsider eventually wanting to breed him.|`|ptNy4uicaa	you can ask if the puppies are show or pet quality... show quality means their temperament, and conformation is sound, and they would be a great representation of the breed. Pet quality means that something makes the puppy less desirable, most people would not even be able to tell a pet from show quality puppy, it could be the coat color, the eye color, uneven teeth, stance, shyness, aggressiveness etc,. These puppies should never be bred, and are usually spayed or neutered before the registration papers are handed over. Therefore you need a registered SHOW QUALITY puppy!!<br>  <br>  Bulldogs usually have a lot of health problems, hip and elbow dysplasia/luxation, heart problems, eye problems entropion, and ectropion, and skin problems, these problems are passes through generations genetically, and there are usually tests preforms to say the parents are free from these disorders. You can ask the breeder if the parents have been tested free of these disorders, you can ask about the vaccines gives, microchipped, meet the parents to get an idea of their temperaments, ask to see the kennel, and ask for references, ask if the parents are titled, usually good breeders try to title the parents before they breed. Make sure that your puppy has a great non agressive non shy personality, and the parents are in good health, if you want to use your dog as a stud, you want to make healthier bulldog puppies in the future!!<br>  <br>  Also if you decide to breed make sure that the female is also in great health, temperament, and rgisitered, and try to get your show quality titled, and try to make sure your female is too. If you don<br>  t want to show you dog you can always get a handler to do it for you.. it makes your dog more valuable and the future puppies more desirable! Plus dog shows will allow you to create a good network with possible breeding females for your male.<br>  <br>  If you deside to breed, mak sue you say that to the breeder, and tell her you need a sound show quality puppy!<br>  <br>  Be a good breeder, and try your best to improve the breed!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldog" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldog</a><br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/events/conformation/getting_started_showing.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/events/conformation/g...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.canismajor.com/dog/petqual.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.canismajor.com/dog/petqual.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.featheroaksfarm.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.featheroaksfarm.com/</a>|`|y5tU4kmMaa	Ask to see the pedigree, akc papers, if they have been tested for genetic problems, how they are trained, how they are socialized, what kind of food they are fed, when they recieve shots etc.... Also if you want to breed him, ask if that will cost more because some breeders charge more if you will be breeding it.  You want a puppy that is socialized around a lot of people and children from the beginning, raised in the house, not in a kennel, preferably genetically tested (especially if you will be breeding the dog). I hope that helps!!!
e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	I would suggest you don't canter him on the longe line anymore, at least for a while.  He might be taking off because he is  not balanced enough to maintain the canter on a small circle like that.  He might just be playing or trying to get out of work.

I'm not going to tell you how to fix it because I'm still trying to figure that out lol. Do you have a round pen you can take him in? That's what I would do (if I had one). I don't really lunge my horse anymore on a lungeline (occasionally i will). I just get out his whip and make him run around in his pen. That way, it doesn't matter if he bucks and gallops, it just gets more energy out of him! lol. <br>  Don't be afraid to get on him. He just might not like being lunged (my horse HATES it!). Does he only act up on the lungeline? You said he is bombproof and his temerament is a 2. I think he'll be fine if you get on. Just make sure you get some of his extra energy out of him before you ride (free lunging). Horses can sense fear. So, when you go to get on your horse, don't be afraid.

He might just have a lot of go in him if he wasn't turned out that day, and if so, I would recommend free-lunging him before putting him to work to get out all of his kicks and giggles.<br>  <br>  Try lunging him without the ground pole, just in general. When you yanked him, did he turn his head in towards you and let his rear end go out? Sort of like a pivot on the front? All you really can do is keep lunging asking for the canter, lunging asking for the canter, and when he goes correctly in a circle reward him. I think he might have had some excess energy he wanted to get out and the lunge line restricted him from doing so.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah - you don't need to approach him to smack him. Pulling his head towards the center harshly is enough punishment. If he does something wrong get him back to work straight away! <br>  <br>  Do you have a trainer? You should also get her or him to come out to work with lunging your horse. <br>  <br>  Plus, if this was just today and he never acts like that, it might just be a one time deal. Every horse, like people, have those off or bad days. <br>  <br>  As for confidence... I've been done that road when I was younger, riding a variety of horses helps, but for him, I think all you need is a good experience with your boy and you'll feel more confident to get on his back. I think this loss of confidence your feeling is a result of a bad day, and I get them too. Everyone does. So, like I said, get an experienced trainer out there and help you lunge him!|`|wYBU1B1qaa	Mine used to buck and kick outt while lunging and for about the first 10 min of a ride.  When he did this while lunging, I would change directions through lunging for respect--Clinton Anderson's methods.  This behavior stopped immediately even under saddle.  Hiring an experienced trainer who exercises natural horsemenship would be a good idea.  When you have someone work with you and your horse using effective methods, it teaches you how to communicate with your horse. As you work with your horse and understand him more, your confidence will increase.   BTW...I do not allow my horses to misbehave on a lunge line.  I've notice unwanted behaviors canescalatee if they are not nipped in the bud!  Good luck!|`|psNR7hDJaa	I would suggest getting your trainer to work with you on that(and if you don't have, get one). It COULD be some type of pain but I think it is mostly behaviour here. You could get a chiro or a vet to look at him if you are really worried though...|`|RHUPEuG1aa	Listen and trust your horse he may be in Pain and he's trying to tell you that. Try having a more experienced rider or your trainer take a look at him.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi does he act like anything hurts when he canters?  Sometimes when something is hurting their back they will buck.  Check these things out first then if no problems try to get him in a round pen where he cannot take off on you.  I would not hit him when you tell him to stop and he does you are not reinforcing the command stop you are making it a painful thing for him to stop.  Which in the long run he will eventually not stop when you tell him.  Also try to get him in a round pen and when he takes off put him to work and make him canter all the more.  The more you make him do this the more he's going to realize that if he acts stupid he has to go to work.  Try doing this over and over repetition is the best.  If you at all feel that he is getting to be too much for you take him to a trainer before he gets spoiled.|`|A5AgBk0xaa	My friends horse does the exact same thing. He'll walk and trot nicely on a lunge line, and you don't even need a lunge whip, just stand in the middle and he goes around. But then if you let him go into a canter, he goes berserk! He will jump and buck and tear around, then stop on a dime and try to turn. This horse is otherwise totally calm, even lazy, but he just loves to go super fast on the lunge. When I lunge him I don't let him, but my friend does which is why he still does it. To stop him I just run him into the fence. It's hard to explain without showing, but you have to sort of run perpendicular to them until they meet up with a wall and have to stop. Of course, this only works in an arena that isn't round. Also, you could try lunging him with a snaffle bit so he is more reponsive to you when you ask him to stop. Just work on a lot of walk-trot-canter transitions and let him know that it is NOT okay to go crazy. <br>  <br>  I'd check with a vet though, just in case it's a medical thing. If not try to get an experienced friend or trainer to help you out. I had a trainer show me how to do it the first few times (she showed my friend too, but she let's him get away with it).<br>  <br>  I'll add that i agree with the other people who answered, he is probably just feeling good and energetic. I free lunge my friend's horse first to let him get warmed up and also to get all the excess energy out. I've found they are much easier to lunge on a line after being allowed (or chased, if it happens to be a lazy horse) to run around freely first.|`|CoAc5hS9aa	"hit him on the shoulder and tell him no."<br>  <br>  Although that may be effective and you feel your horse may deserve it he had no understanding on why he was being hit. Just wanted to point that out.<br>  <br>  If you are afraid you might want a confident horse person to come help you finnish your basic training. If you do not have access to a trainer or professional you are obviously way to green for this horse. Sorry but sometimes the truth hurts.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Sound like he is just feeling good to me :)<br>   Mine always perk up this time of year. Even my older guy gets a little frisky this time of year.<br>  Are you letting him exert his energy before you start to work with him?<br>  <br>  Just lounge him in a secure place or turn him loose and encourage him run around for a bit.  And then ask him to work.  Try this before you get a trainer.  I'll bet you will see a difference.<br>  Good Luck,<br>  Jenny|`|AA11484393	Hitting your horse after he has stopped will actually make things worse.  Horses learn by comfort and discomfort WHILE they are doing something good or something bad.  <br>  <br>  If this is a very new thing, I would definitely get his back checked out, as often time the canter is where pain manifests itself most.  <br>  <br>  If he is sound, try free lunging him in a round pen or arena.  If he starts misbehaving, get him to turn around and go the other way, not necessarily stop.  Your horse could really benefit from some ground work lessons.  See if you trainer knows how to do any of that type of training.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|RloOJ43haa	Since you are now fearful, you are going to need a trainer to come work with you and your horse. You will not be able to fix this by yourself. <br>  <br>  A couple of notes:<br>  1. There is no such thing as a bombproof horse. <br>  2. Horses are NOT allowed to misbehave on the longe line.
awv5fWX6aa	I THINK YOU SHOULD leave it w/sand because rocks grow algae and sand is just sand so it doesnt grow algae you dont have to clean it like with rocks so i think YOU should stick with sand and if you want it look colorful get different colors of sand mix it up or you could leave the sand and put 1 or 2 colorful rocks in the ank as decorations.|`|4HdgVprJaa	lol not an idiot, just concerned. We use the rocks, I never knew you could use the sand, I just always assumed the sand was for salt water fish. They are definitely easier to clean though.|`|591LuLECaa	Its probably easier to clean with the rocks. But your fish may get stuck under the rocks or somehting, that has happened to my teachers fish before. Just think about the pros and cons of each|`|JlQl1HP9aa	my personal opinion, i think rocks are 100% cleaner and healthier.<br>  i've always used them!|`|cjVEY45daa	I have had Beta fish before and I used colored rocks in their tanks.  Yes, I do believe that the tank would be easier to clean if you used rocks rather than sand.  I don't know about whether or not it is healthier for him, but my fish were perfectly healthy with the rocks.  Also, don't worry, I don't think you're an idiot :D|`|TSQxwlbraa	Rocks :)<br>  Because there a different colors to choose from, also they wont mistake them for food. They are way easier to clean!|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Actually, sand is much easier to clean then rocks/gravel.  Most of my tanks are sand bottoms, and I've had them that way for about 7 years now.  With sand, the waste and uneaten food settles on the top-making it much easier to vacuum or scoop out.  With rocks/gravel, all the waste/uneaten food settles down in between the rocks.  Very noticable when you do a gravel vacuum, look at all the gunk the siphon sucks up from down under the gravel bed.<br>  <br>  Rocks are not "healthier" per se.  The only time a rock may help out in a tank is if it's something like lime stone that contains calcium carbonate.  This will increase your hardness and ph in the tank, which is good for some types of fish(African cichlids), and is good for a tank with low ph/soft water that is more unstable.  The rocks containing calcium carbonate will help to stablize the ph/hardness.  <br>  <br>  My advice, if you like the sand, keep it.  Definitely easier.<br>  <br>  <br>  .
CoAc5hS9aa	I was never into 4-h but all judges are different. Even if it does not say so in the rule book doesn't mean they won't mark you off for having a colored helmet or pad.<br>  <br>  I would suggest having a white fleece shaped saddle pad with a black helmet cover. You can also get white square pads with colored piping which can add a little bit of color if you do not want to be totally boring.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doversaddlery.com/product.asp?pn=X1-19573&ids=860698349" rel="nofollow">http://www.doversaddlery.com/product.asp...</a> (you can get them much cheaper, for like $20)<br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.doversaddlery.com/rider%92s-international-quilted-cotton-saddle-pad/p/X1-1997/cn/104/" rel="nofollow">http://www.doversaddlery.com/rider%92s-i...</a>|`|pTmrZicfaa	It shouldn't (key word being "Shouldn't) but some judges mark down anyway... -_-<br>  I would recommend a white saddle pad and black helmet cover. You will get noticed more and you are more likely to get a better score if the judges decide to be that kind of judge|`|AA10986942	English attire is all about proper tradition ... if you want to get colorful go western pleasure|`|V7Y9ldTUaa	In 4-H they can't dock you for that kind of stuff (if you look in the rule book)  However, you will look better infront of the judge if you are dressed more 'professionally'. It SHOULDN'T hurt your placing, but you never know.
IbDcAXsaaa	Well, it depends on how old they are. If they are 6-8 weeks, the general age they are when you get them from chain stores like Petco, then you could try introducing them without a divider to see how things work out. Put them somewhere they haven't been, ex. the bath tub, and see what they do. If one hasn't marked its spot yet, then they might not get territorial. If this doesn't work, keep them in split cage for about 3 weeks, switching their sides at the maximum of 4 times a day. After about 3 weeks and you see they don't freak out after switching the sides, try putting them in the bathtub together. If there still is conflict, I would rub them in something non toxic to gerbils, like flour maybe (I really don't know what substance, it might be on the internet though) and that should get rid of their scent, so they will smell the same, like the substance I mean. Good luck, please email if you need anymore answers. Best of wishes,<br>  <br>  Chihuahua Mama|`|Ws2QPD0Iaa	There are a few key things to look for.  If the gerbils are sleeping next to eachother through the divider, or sniffing calmly through it, this is a good thing.  However, if they seem to be trying to attack through the barrier, or like what happened with them already, that is a bad thing.  They are going to need some more time to adjust, and may not possibley be able to be together.|`|ruPo4DTAaa	I've tried the same thing before as well a couple years ago. First of all it might help to make sure you have a good seperator, one that they can't chew through but can still smell each other though. The getting rid of their scent is also a very good idea. Chewing at the seperator can be a bad sign. Wish you the best, just make sure you know their completely okay with each other before putting them together.

280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	"How do you give them a wash?"<br>  <br>  First of all, you'll want to make the experience positive for the dog. If you don't make an effort to make the dog comfortable, he'll most likely be one of the countless dogs who fight at bath time.<br>  <br>  At first, just give him plenty of tasty treats and praise for simply being in the bath tub or sink or wherever you choose to bathe him. He should be comfortable in that area. Then, turn on the water just a tiny bit. Make sure it's warm, but not hot! Reward the dog for being comfortable with the weird water source. Then put a small amount of water on the dog, then a little more. Always give him super-tasty treats, praise and affection for being "brave." (Remember, bath time is very unnatural for dogs!) <br>  <br>  If he seems afraid or nervous, do not coddle him or reward him. Ignore or distract fear. If you try to soothe him by talking softly, petting him or hugging him, you will be rewarding his fearful reaction. Sweet-talking and petting is how we praise a dog, and thus he'll think you're praising him for freaking out.<br>  <br>  As for actually bathing, make sure you buy a shampoo that is appropriate for young puppies. I'm personally fond of Earthbath brand, but that's just me. First, you wet the dog's coat thoroughly. Massage a small amount of shampoo into his fur and work it into a lather. It's just like how you wash your hair. Then, rinse it thoroughly with water. Make sure you remove it completely, left-over shampoo residue is really irritating on the skin. You can then simply dry the dog with a towel by gently and firmly rubbing the fur dry. <br>  <br>  Do not bathe too often. Dogs just don't need it. If you're giving the dog a bath any more than once a month, that's much too often.<br>  <br>  Here's an article on Chihuahua grooming:<br>  <a href="http://www.thechihuahuaguide.com/Chihuahua_Care/Chihuahua_Grooming.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.thechihuahuaguide.com/Chihuah...</a><br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  "How do you take care of them??"<br>  <br>  ..You mean in general? If you have no idea how to care for a dog, your first priority should not be how to give a bathe. Do you mean you don't know what to feed, what supplies to get, so on and so forth?<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  "Do you have to brush short haired chihuahua's??"<br>  <br>  You don't technically have to brush them. Their short fur isn't going to tangle or anything. However, you should brush short-haired dogs, too. This removes all dead hair and debris and really reduces all the shedded fur you find on your couch and rug. It keeps the skin and coat healthier, smoother and shinier.|`|X4umNoGzaa	wet, apply shampoo, rub it in, rinse, towel dry/ and or use hair dryer.<br>  feed dog recommended amount of food, usually tells you how much to feed them based on their weight, chihuahuas like to snuggle so make sure to have a blanket just for the dog, they like to cover up. i would recommend brushing on occasion its good for their coat, though being short haired, won't require constant maintenance. Just give it lots of love, and you should be fine
I6zM9dKcaa	I recommend trying to find a place locally, rather than sending a somewhat fragile salt water animal through the mail system.<br>  <br>  Be sure you research what kind of Octopus you are buying, and how easy they are to care for in your home. Not all are the same. Don't buy a blue ring octopus. While you can often find them in a store, they are very hard to keep and are  dangerous if they bite you.<br>  <br>  You will need a very large tank, over 50 gallons to care for most properly. Cephalopods do not naturally live long. A typical life span of an octopus is in the region of 6 months to 18 months.<br>  <br>  I recommend you read the two articles linked below, and reconsider your choice.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	A saltwater aquarist...please bear in mind that octopi are among the most difficult water creatures to keep. They are prone to squirting ink in the water when they come near, but in the closed environment of the aquarium this is fatal to them.

If she is, you may be able to get an emergency spay. If is too late for that, have x-ray or ultra sound done to know how many puppies to plan for. And please get her spayed.|`|JPa0GzDjaa	It sounds like a false pregnancy, usually happens at the end of a season and is caused by an imbalance of hormones. <br>  <br>  Hope the link helps!

3sB49YNnaa	Sadly, he probably aspirated some of the liquid food and choked to death on it.  Dropper feeding is very hard to do if you are not experienced.  You cannot put the syringe in the center of the mouth or at the back of the tongue since they can breath the food in rather than swallow it.  It is safest to put small amounts in at the side of the mouth.<br>  <br>  Overgrowth of the molars is rare in pigs fed a pelleted diet and hay but it does happen sometimes.  It causes them to get thinner and thinner until they just don't have enough energy to survive.  It can happen quite quickly and often you can't see it coming until it is too late.

I'm glad now that I waited and found exactly the puppy that I wanted, even though it took longer then I would have liked.<br>  <br>  I really love having him but he is a lot of work!  <br>  <br>  About breeders - you can look online for good breeders too.  These days it isn't uncommon to have puppies flown in from breeders across the country. You don't have to neccissarly stick to your local area, which can make it easier to find what you're looking for.  Make sure you actually talk to the breeder, get pictures and maybe even videos of their dogs, references, and make sure their adult dogs have passed health checks - checks on eyes and knees are especially important with papillons.  A responsible breeder will have a spay/neuter contract for dogs sold to pet homes.  And health grantees are a plus, some breeders offer 1 or 2 year health grantees so you are protected if the dog develops any genetic problems within that time.<br>  <br>  There are also papillon breed rescues, but they never had any puppies when I was looking, only older dogs.  You could also call your local shelter and tell them what your looking for, and they can call you if they ever have one up for adoption.<br>  <br>  I know it can be frustrating but just keep looking and you'll eventually find your perfect puppy - I know I did! :)|`|PXROTM6Eaa	Brandi, I haven't had any problems with my papillon.
M3pjhIecaa	what size tank are we talking about here, the fact its a new tank would obviously suggest the water parameters are incorrect, if you'd gone and had them tested at somewhere reputable they'd probably pick that up, I'd not count where you've bought the fish from as reputable as they sold you 2 rainbow sharks which are Territorial, and having tried keeping those fish in an 8ft tank know full well that that wasn't enough space. <br>  You need to test the ammonia, nitrite and nitrate failing that which i doubt the Ph.

While some diseases have symptoms that look similar, they need different treatments obviously. A good practise would be to keep a small quarantine tank on standby, in case you need it to treat your sick fish. Not all fishes are affected at the same time, so you need to separate the sick one from the rest as quickly as possible. Another good practise is to keep common medications handy, so that you can apply them as<br>  and when you need to. Take care not to overstock and do check their expiry dates from time to time.<br>  <br>  Here are some common fish diseases/problems. Learn to recognise these symptoms.<br>  <br>  1. Ammonia poisoning. Fish are seen gasping for air at the surface of the water. This usually happens for a new tank setup. It’s part of the nitrogen cycle during which ammonia is converted into nitrates. Most fishes do not survive during the initial stage.<br>  <br>  Remedy: When you are first setting up your aquarium, run the pump and put in cheaper fishes to start the cycle. Another alternative is to put in fish food and allow it to decompose to produce ammonia gas. The whole procedure should take at least 2 weeks. Once the nitrate level in the water is safe, you can then put in your fish.<br>  <br>  2. Lack of oxygen. Fish are seen gasping for air at the surface.<br>  <br>  Remedy: This can be easily rectified by adding an air pump to the tank.<br>  <br>  For more information on setting up a new tank, go here.<br>  <br>  3. Fish fungus. White or dirty white cotton-like growth on the skin. When left untreated, the fish will die.<br>  <br>  Remedy: Change your water every other day. If the situation does not improve, it is best to quarantine the sick fish and treat it individually. There are many ready-made fungus treatments in the market. Just shop around and ask for the right one.<br>  <br>  4. Tail and/or fin rot. Obvious signs are rotting fins and blood on the edges of fins. This is usually caused by bullying fishes and/or poor water conditions. Tuberculosis can also lead to tail and fin rot.<br>  <br>  Remedy: If it is caused by a bullying fish, separate them and treat it with antibiotics (chloromycetin). If it is caused by poor water conditions, change the aquarium water frequently.<br>  <br>  5. Velvet. They appear as yellow or brown dusty spots on the fish. The fish may show signs of irritation and may be rubbing on surfaces in the tank.<br>  <br>  Remedy: Quarantine the fish because Velvet is highly infectious. Treat it with copper at 0.2 mg per litre. Repeat once every few days if needed. Do not prolong the treatment as copper can cause fish poisoning.<br>  <br>  6. Ich or White Spot (Ichthyophtirius multifiliis). It appear as white spots on the body. It is usually caused by poor water quality.<br>  <br>  Remedy: You can head down to the pet shop and get a remedy for it. To help in the treatment, raise the temperature of water to 27oC (80o F) to speed up the cycle time of this protozoa (Ichthyophtirius multifiliis).

cSOwqXKxaa	Hello!  I agree that we really cannot help you here - but when you love your pets you look anywhere for answers.<br>  <br>  I can tell you that my mother-in-law lost a Newfoundland nearly a decade ago to a parathyroid condition, most likely cancer, that caused a calcium deficiency in his body.  It wasn't the cancer that killed him; rather, he lost weight, was acting abnormally, and his muscles began twitching and contracting, and when that happened my mother-in-law threw him in the car with herself and her husband and drove through a blizzard to reach MSU clinic, where your pup is now.<br>  <br>  You may want to get your dog's calcium levels checked, but be sure it is done properly as apparently calcium tests (for inactive and active) have a high failure/incorrect reading rate.  If your dog has hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism, you will need to act fast.  Signs of hyper include loss of appetite, muscular weakness, apathy, stiff gait, shivering and increased water intake.  Signs of hypo include increased water intake, muscle tremors, excessive panting, difficulty walking, and even seizures.<br>  <br>  There are quite a few neuropathies that present the conditions you've outlined, such as:<br>  <br>  Giant Axonal Neuropathy (seen only in German shepherds) characterized by weakness of the rear limbs, decreased reflexes and loss of bark.<br>  <br>  Hypertrophic Neuropathy (seen only in Tibetan mastiffs) characterized by the same symptoms as the one above.<br>  <br>  Coonhound paralysis (can strike any breed of dog) is characterized by rear leg weakness rapidly increasing and severe cases losing bark, have trouble breathing, and inability to lift the head.  This is inflammation of the nerve roots and recovery time can take up to a year.  As the name suggest, caused by bite or even interaction with a raccoon.<br>  <br>  You may also want to look into a possible diabetes diagnosis as well, though if your vet is correct in saying that your dog has developed a deficiency of the thyroid, then it may be a moot point.<br>  <br>  I know this sounds grim, and I hope in your case this cause of his symptoms is something easily remedied.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and your dog!!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	The vets don't know what it is, but you think you'll find an answer ... here.<br>  <br>  Sorry your dog is sick, but nobody here can help you.

510MC9SVaa	I'm not going to chastize you about your choice, but I do want to offer an alternative. There are caps you can get to put on the front nails. They go on just like human glue on nails. You cut just the tip of the nail off, then put a drop of glue in the cap and put it on the nail. They come in different sizes for different weight cats. It costs about 20$ for 50 nail caps and the caps last for about a month. So for less than 40$ a year you could use these caps. They are blunt on the end, so the cat can't tear up your house anymore. It takes a little while (a few weeks) for them to get used to them, but they are so much better/safer/cheaper than getting the cat de-clawed. I use it on all four of my in house cats and they can't tear up anything with their claws anymore. <br>  <br>  I paint them before I put them on the cats.

If it comes down to surrendering a cat to a shelter where it doesn't have a guarantee of a home, versus declawing with a home, I would choose declawing as well, and I know this is going to upset some people.|`|YetCd6Tkaa	Is she still a kitten?  Have you considered regularly trimming her nails?  Other options are providing scratching posts and scratching boards (sisal is best) and encouraging her to use these by offering her treats when she uses them and covering them with catnip. If she is scratching your kids, she is likely being provoked by them. There are few, if any children, who understand when cats are telling them "no". (I was one of these children myself.) After declawing, she may resort to biting them instead, as this will be her only defense. If you feel that declawing is your only option at this point, you will not likely find a reputable, well-informed veterinarian to perform this orthopedic surgery for much less than you have quoted. If you want a safe surgery performed by knowledgeable staff with fewer post-op complications, $400 is not unreasonable. A vet school would probably be more expensive.  Small town vets are often less expensive, but may also be less knowledgeable or inexperienced.<br>  <br>  Natalie Taylor, RVT|`|vg2xABZjaa	yea i use human nail clippers.

At least you aren't putting them out. You have the right to do what you want. In my opinion my household items and family are more important than a cat. While I have a lot of sympathy for animals I don't feel as though your home should be destroyed. I took my cat to an animal hospital and got them de-clawed and neutered and I paid approx 225 total. Some animal shelters may be willing to assist if you explain that if you can't get them de-clawed you may have to get rid of them. If they think it will be one less cat on the street they may be willing to assist. <br>  Again, you do what you feel is necessary and forget what these people have to say. If they were put in your shoes I bet they would do the same thing. No one wants to live in a destroyed home and not everyone can afford to keep replacing the same items over again for the sake of an animal.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Yes, she's your "possession" so your free to do to her as you wish.  But consider giving up this possession of yours rather than have her declawed, as your things are obviously very important to you.  Do you know that many declawed cats - especially adults - come through the surgery with very painful feet, so that they forever after refuse to use the litter box?  What will that do to your nice new wall-to-wall carpeting?  Declawed cats tend to bite.  Instead of scratching your children, she's going to bite them.<br>  <br>  A shelter considers a biting cat that won't use a litter box unadoptable, and she'll be quickly euthanized.  Rather surrender her to the shelter with the claws Nature gave her, without behavior issues (she's not trained, and that's your issue not hers) than to the shelter later as an unadoptable cat.|`|8e13291b33ff9fcfc620b014d57ead81aa	There is no inexpensive way to declaw a cat.<br>  Under 400 dollars is not possible if she is to get the care she needs throughout the painful ordeal.<br>  It is an elective surgery that must be done with a laser in order to lessen the animals trauma.<br>  <br>  Your looking at 600-800 dollars.<br>  She will need pre anesthetic blood work.<br>  Surgeons will preform a nerve block to decrease pain.<br>  She will undergo general anesthesia<br>  She will require atleast 2 days of hospitalization<br>  She will need significant pain management even after she is discharged.<br>  <br>  She will need to be placed on supplementation for the rest of her life to combat the chronic pain she will have due to the traumatic surgery.<br>  Cosequin or SynoviG3 and omega fatty acids must be added to her diet.<br>  If you do not supplement her diet to battle the pain you will be left with a declawed cat who refuses to use the litter box.<br>  Arthritis sets in early in these cats and since you are electing to put her through the procedure you must be willing to keep her comfortable.<br>  <br>  Cats who are declawed after the age of 1 year tend to become biters and inappropriate eliminaters.<br>  Realize once you put her through this you must deal with the possible reprocussions.<br>  To avoid reprocussions you need to keep her comfortable and pain free.<br>  <br>  Upon discharge from the hospital she should be sent home with bupernex.<br>  This is a pain killer that will hopefully keep her in the litter box while she is healing.|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	can the cat go out?  Mine simply lives outdoors due to family allergies.  I built a hut for it to live in.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Luckily, declawing and re-homing are not the only options. Scratching posts are A LOT cheaper than declawing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Before you decide to have your cat declawed, there are many things you should know before you make your decision.  The surgery is basically an American trend, and is considered inhumane and is illegal in many countries, (England, Scotland, Wales, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal, Belgium, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Yugoslavia and Japan).  If that doesn’t impact your opinion about declawing, maybe this website will help you decide: <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a> <br>  <br>  I believe that people who have their cats declawed are uneducated.  It is not very difficult to train your cat to use a scratching post.  The surgery is not simply a trimming of the claws, it’s an amputation of the distal phalanx, including bones, ligaments, and tendons! To remove the claw, the bone, nerve, joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and the extensor and flexor tendons must all be amputated.  If you were to make a comparison, it would be like having the last joint of each of our fingers chopped off.  So of course it is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery.  There are often many complications in the healing process, including infection often from litter box use, resulting in a life-long aversion to the litter box.  Other declawed cats that can no longer mark with their claws, will mark with urine instead, resulting in inappropriate elimination problems.  <br>  <br>  Many cats that have been declawed are traumatized and become withdrawn, nervous, fearful and/or aggressive.  Cats who went through the painful surgery are more prone to resort to biting when they feel threatened.  Since cats have emotional feelings, (just like we do) they can resent you if you decided to get them declawed.  All of these things can cause depression and ultimately lead to an overweight cat.<br>  <br>  If a cat that has been declawed accidentally escapes, he/she would be in great danger.  A cat needs its claws to defend itself, as well as to escape by climbing.  The constant state of stress, caused by a feeling of defenselessness may make some declawed cats more prone to disease.  Also they cannot stretch their back and shoulder muscles like they do naturally when they dig their claws into a scratching post.  <br>  <br>  One popular alternative is Soft Paws.  They are lightweight vinyl nail caps that you glue on the cat's front claws.  They're great for households with small children and are extremely useful for people who are away from home all day and can't exercise the watchfulness necessary to train a cat to use a scratching post.  Soft Paws are easy to apply and last about four to six weeks.  They come in clear or colors--which are really fun.<br>  <br>  Most common types of damage are scratched furniture, ripped carpets and shredded wallpaper.  You want to eliminate the problem before it occurs.  Buy or build a stable, tall scratching-post, right from the start.  Here are some tips to do it right: If your cat is scratching your furniture or rugs, here is some advice on training them to use a scratching post:<br>  - The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope, (mine like the carpeted ones)<br>  - Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household <br>  - Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk <br>  - Introduce a new scratching-post with some catnip sprinkled on its surface.  Cats love that and it’s more attractive to them <br>  - If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, say "NO" and gently carry your cat to the desired post.  Demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.  If the cat doesn‘t catch on after trying this repeatedly for a few days, gently pick up his paws rub them along the post.<br>  - Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and plenty of affection.  The cat needs to know that using the scratching post results in positive things such as affection, playing and treats.<br>  - When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>  - Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself <br>  - Try some repellent like pepper-dust or some commercial products on your furniture to keep your cat off these areas<br>  - Be persistent and don't give up too soon<br>  <br>  <br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it. Here's a website that shows you how:  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  What was going on when the cat scratches them? Are they playing or is she mad? Children can naturally be a little loud and sometimes too rambunctious for cats. Make sure they know how to handle her properly without upsetting her. <br>  <br>  Don't assume automatically that cats that bite are vicious creatures.  You must distinct between play-biting and real aggressive biting.  Kittens for example like to play, and sometimes pretty rough.  They use their claws and teeth to wrestle with each other.  This is how they learn to hunt and catch prey, so that’s normal.  They usually go unharmed because their fur protects them from serious wounds.  However, human skin is a different story, but kittens don't know that.<br>  <br>  When you stroke your kitten it can take it as an invitation to play and clasps your hand and bites.  That might hurt a little but is generally nothing to worry about.  Some cats make a sport out of leg biting.  They jump up on you and dig in.  Research has show that it’s a sort of unsatisfied hunting and prey instinct and lack of activity.  <br>  <br>  - Teach your kitten from an early age that hands are for feeding and stroking and NOT a toy!  <br>  - Avoid playing with your bare hands <br>  - Use a fluffy toy or a feather on a string instead <br>  - In case it grabs your hand, draw it away slowly and do NOT punish your cat, it will understand it as an attack and make matters worse.<br>  - Anytime your cat scratches or bites you, make a loud yowling sound to show that you have been hurt, (even if you really aren’t hurt). Your cat will understand. <br>  - If your cat is a "leg biter" try to spend more time playing with it and redirect its attack to a toy.  Leave toys lying around so that he can also amuse itself, particular when you keep your cat indoors. Cats need a wide variety of toys to keep them interested, so don’t expect a couple toy mice to help.<br>  <a href="http://www.catcatcat.com/behav3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.catcatcat.com/behav3.html</a>|`|oT71QN8Raa	First, I got mine declawed for $175 a cat (front only) and it was fine...it seems weird to me that the procedure would be $400-600.  Someone else mentioned traveling to an outside, smaller area.  That may be your only option, considering I have lived in small towns my entire life and have NEVER seen the cost very high and the vets aren't any less experienced than any other vet.  <br>  <br>  Second, how old is the cat?  I only because if the cat is over a year old, the risk of having adverse effects is pretty high and it may end up being worse than dealing with her claws.  I am not saying don't do it...but just suggesting that you speak with a vet about the risks of declawing an older cat (IF she is older of course...if not, then disregard this entire paragraph).<br>  <br>  Have you tried Softpaws?  Most pet stores sell them and they come in colors (if thats something you're interested in).  They do take a bit for the cat to get used to them, but in the end, it is cheaper and less painful for the cat, especially if she is older.<br>  <br>  Consider your options :)<br>  <br>  ...I just wanna add something:  I've seen little miss Certified Vet Tech in a few questons, and first - cats do not NEED to be on a supplement their entire lives.  NONE of my cats are on a supplement and two of them are almost 20 years old and doing JUST fine.  Second - the procedure does not NEED to be done via laser.  Laser is less painful, but its not a NEED.  Third - 400-600 dollars is INSANE!  That is not the typical price and honestly, I don't know where you get your info, since I can grab 6 cats right now to disprove everything you keep saying.|`|x0WZE0i4aa	I'm in the 're-home her' camp.  You do say your 'looking into' getting her de-clawed, so I'm assuming that doesn't mean you are totally decided.  I won't go into the horrors of de-toeing.  But... your kids don't like her.  It doesn't sound like you like her that much.  Even if you get her toes chopped off there's no guarantee that she isn't at some point going to pee/poop/barf all over that new carpeting (even cats with claws can get upset about things and stop using their trays...).  You don't like high vets bills: what happens when she's elderly and has health problems?<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you've reached 'last chance' stage with this cat.  De-toeing will not guarantee there will not be further problems (and may even lead to them).  Better to give her a chance at being re-homed now...<br>  <br>  Edit: you say you and your kids love your cat?  Sorry, still not hearing it.  You said yourself, your kids are SCARED of her.  And now you are saying she's lunging at them... could be just playful, but if it's actual agression, then removing her claws is definitely going to make her more likely to bite instead. You say yourself that 'she is NOT going to tear my new house apart'.  That sounds like you've drawn the line to me, and the next problem is going to be cat gone.  If she is genuinly aggressive, getting a behaviourist in would be a better use of your money.  But I think what's going on here is you've spent money, and you are hell bent on trying to force this cat into being the fantasy creature you thought you were getting and think you love.  It's not.  If you really loved her you'd do what was best for her: admit that she doesn't fit your familly, and it's better to give her a chance to find a better life.<br>  <br>  If your kids could be stopped from making a mess of the new house by cutting their fingers off, would you do it?  No, because you love your kids...  If you would do this to your cat, you don't love her.<br>  <br>  PS: if you want to pay shipment to the UK, including the months of testing it takes to get her a passport to come here, then I'd give her a home.  I think it would be better to find her a good one there.

And most cities have a number of smaller, no-kill organizations that will rescue animals.  You may also find a St. Bernard -specific rescue online.|`|Bw18seFqaa	do you mean on this site?

AA10247494	Okay I very much agree with the first two answers but I'm going to try to simplify the issue a little more... What your horse knows is what we call "plow reining" in western riding. Leading with the the presure from the outside rein is called "neck reining". You'll want to pull less with the inside rein and lead with more presure on the outside rein to cue your horse. If your horse is unfamiliar with this concept then try riding with the reins in one hand (use that hand to lead the horse left or right by pulling your other hand left or right and using your other hand to cue the inside rein if he doesn't understand what you are asking) until he gets the concept of leading with the outside rein. Ask your trainer for help with this and let him of know any questions you might have.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :D|`|RloOJ43haa	You will need to talk to your trainer about this for more details and demo because this concept will be very hard to explain on YA.<br>  <br>  Turning from the outside rein is not just turning with the reins but with your whole body. It would be better if your trainer said 'turn him from the outside aids.' So, you will shift both hands to the direction of the turn. You inside hand comes to the inside to keep the inside flexion. Your outside hand will stay almost at the withers, but not crossing them. The outside rein keeps the roundness. Keep your inside seat bone forward and you inside leg on to bend his ribs to the outside and turn your shoulder in the direction that you want to go, and push from the outside with your outside leg. <br>  <br>  Learning this will take some time to get the feel of it. Once you do get the feel of it, you will find that your turns become much more balanced because you push your horse through them and don't pull which can put him off balance. The horse will really learn how to listen to your seat you you will learn to influence with it.|`|jiWHDyS5aa	What she means is that you push out with your inside leg, keep your outside leg in check though. Turn with your outside rein, but keep your inside in check. in other words. When you go into a turn, get the bend/arc that you want for the size of the circle by using your inside rein(you should see a wee bit of the horses eye) then apply pressure with your inside leg on the girth....meanwhile your outside leg should be relaxed, but in contact, slightly behind the girth. Now your horse understands the arc you want and you can adjust using your outside rein, while keeping your inside rein in check. <br>  <br>  It takes some time and practice but it helps your horses overall turning and circling ability. It keeps them from putting their weight on the forehand and keeps them bending.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

OpduZC3Eaa	Is your cat neutered? If not then that could be the answer to your problem right there. Sometimes male cats will start to 'mark' or spray there territory without any other animal around. But most of the time they will start to do this when another animal comes in and the male cat feels threatened. It's perfectly natural on there part, but certainly  not something we like to keep in our homes! Yuck! So to solve this problem, take him into the vet to be neutered. This will prevent him from spraying as well as control the pet population. <br>  <br>  If he is neutered, then I recommend you go down to your local pet supply shop, like Petco or anything you have of that sort, and purchase some repellent. Just ask the clerks there to help you out with which one is preferred among there customers. Repellent is perfectly safe for your household and your pet. You spray it on the area's that your cat is marking (spraying) on and the scent of it will prevent him from spraying. He may go on to another area to mark his places but if you use the repellent then he will stop. <br>  <br>  Don't get rid of your cat just because he's spraying either. Especially since he's an adult cat, that usually means he will have a higher rate of being euthanize because he's not a kitten. =(<br>  <br>  If it helps (if he isn't already), perhaps you could teach him to be an indoor/outdoor kitty, that way when he sprays he is doing it outside while later he is still able to be comfortable inside.|`|dSSFrYUxaa	"X" marks the spot|`|dE7b0odvaa	I promise it's a territorial thing.

Intact male cats mark their territory by spraying urine. He may be doing this because of the dog you had in the house for 2 weeks. My suggestions would be to get him neutered if he is not already or taking him to the vet and asking about a Feliway diffuser. It is an appeasing pheromonee that could eliminate this behavior. You may also want to get his urine checked by a vet to make sure that it is a behavioral problem and not a health problem. Male cats are prone to getting blocked (unable to urinate) which can be fatal if left unattended for too long. To me- it sounds behavioral, but always better to be on the safe side and get him checked.

XoknFyNvaa	I would have checked its tags and brought it home or called the owners, but it was your decision. The dog could be killed while wandering around and I wouldn't want to live with the fact that I could have saved it, but chose not to.|`|8j7FCEOraa	I think you should have looked at it's collar, see if there was a phone number. You not only left the dog alone, but you also gave it a chance to be hit by a car, possibly eat something bad or him, or even get in a scrap with another dog. Not to mention, some kid might be heart broken looking for thier pet.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	You should have called animal control or someone to pick up the dog. It could have been a stray, and it's very dangerous for dogs to just be wandering around. If the dog has owners they should get fined for not having their dog properly contained.
5PG9H1ozaa	Dear Hannah P.,Well, God Bless you for not only taking an older rescue dog but also showing concern for her well being.You did not mention if pet is under DVM care and/or meds. for pain.Regardless here's an old school trick taught 30 years ago in vet coll. for social behav......no longer taught. To introduce old/new pets into home and to teach sharing....everybody down on the floor with each pet at one members side.Everybody start eating,except canines.After you have consumed a few forkfulls, offer each pet a morsel. Each person in turn offer pet a morsel,after they had had a couple forkfulls.Oh.a circle works best.After a session or two pets will automaticaly come when family members take place on floor.Hannah,not only did this work many times for my beloved pets but also on the kids.....and at times they were a handfull.Good luck and give your gal a hug and pat for me.|`|L22hVXTIaa	Well, it sounds like she needs to see a vet.  Falling over and "acting crazy" aren't normal.  Even though she may be aggressive, it sounds as though she's suffering from some type of seizure problem.  <br>  <br>  Please take her to the vet and have her checked out.  That's no way for a dog to live.  If she's beyond help, the vet will be able to tell you.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	I would have her put to sleep and her suffering ended.|`|ANl54Xowaa	It sounds like your dog probably hasn't fully forgetten if it has been abused or not.

Get a roll of chicken wire & lay it in the trench & attach it to the existing fence every 8 to 10 inches & bury the chicken wire.  Your dogs will not dig out again.<br>  <br>  I have done that to my half acre & the Candy Kitchens Wolf Ranch & Rescue uses this method also to keep there Wolves in their compounds.|`|2Utx6skNaa	at some pet stores they sell this lemon spray stuff or just spray that you can no duh spray on wherever you dont want your dogs to go it worked for us

uC2OAc4Kaa	You could always adopt another one! I always do that. There are lots of hamsters at the spca waiting for a new home! If you feel like you want a rest keep the cage in storage for later when you do need it the most. I would either give the food away to your friend.

uqag7LEDaa	I'm assuming you are talking about Mbuna's. <br>  <br>  Mouth-brooding African cichlid mating occurs something like this: the male digs out a cave for the female and lures her in by doing this silly fin shaking dance. She lays her eggs in the nest and he fertilizes them. Then she picks up the eggs in her mouth and carries them until they hatch. Not all cichlids will dig but they will do the shaking dance. <br>  <br>  Hope it helps.|`|1orBemFyaa	what kind of africans?  i have south americans, but when they were ready to breed my female and male would chase eachother, and then they would spin around eachother and rub against eachother.  also, my female had this whte thing drop down so im assuming it's its breeding tube.  so i dont know if this applies to both african and american, but yeah.  also the male will also kinda have a breeding tube, but its more pointy and harder to see.  but again, this is south americans although i heard that africans and south americans are pretty close in relation.  (although south americans are better =] )  best of luck!
gJrHBtp1aa	Its very normal for swats, growls and hisses when introducing a new cat. If there is not blood or fur flying then I'd say they are fine and just getting to know each other.|`|fmhAjr3Taa	It's possibly normal play. Unless one has their ears back and their hissing, then it's fighting. My cats do that a lot, and since I didn't take any precautions, the other one is now handicapped.|`|ZIBaiIfjaa	Signs of fighting:<br>  Hissing, scratching until bleeding, yelping, pouncing on to each others backs and refusing to let go, becoming tense when ever around other cat, not allowing cat to share food or room space. Trying to grab at one's throat. Tail swirling/turning/rotating. (this means they're stressed or annoyed.) Selfish. Cats never blink at each other.<br>  Signs of rough play:<br>  Pouncing, tossing things at each other, pounce positions, swiping gently, and when one cat has had enough, the other cat will just simply walk away. Sniffing each other. (this indicates that they're making sure this a friend, not a foe.)<br>  Good luck!|`|KLtqlQZhaa	i have two cats who play rough alot, but it is very hard to tell whether they are fighting. normally if you hear meowing or them making noises they are fighting, but it really depends on the cats.|`|x9QqbPiCaa	If their pretty young its play. When they get older the get territorial. If one is protecting a space, or person (you) then it isn't play.

eXDDODfHaa	its ginic . we have an appaloosa and it has a short tail but my aunt use to have 2 and they had long tails. yeah it kinda werid.|`|7cm4dZVaaa	The old bloodlines, the foundation bred Apps, tend to have a very thin, sparse tail, it was even a breed characteristic years ago.  They called it a "rat tail."  Modern bloodlines have so much quarter horse and TB blood in them that the rat tail is almost rare.  I have even seen people on App show forums talking about false tails to add to their show horses.  I had one of those once, with Prince Plaudit bloodlines, he had such a thin tail, you could see the skin through it.  Much less trouble to care for, though, and it made his hips look big.|`|Z1ftrUJuaa	Yes, it is genetic. In fact, at the beginning of the breed, the 'rat tail' was what was wanted. Palouse Ponies- now Appaloosas, were trail/ range horses, and long flowing tails were impractical. They would get caught and ripped and torn, so they were breed to have short, ratty tails, that were more practical.|`|UcMCdlJSaa	Yes its genetic but i wouldn't by a fake tail.|`|xKHeYmQJaa	Yes, it's genetic.  If you have a tail with length, then it's very spare.  If you have a thick tail, then it's short.<br>  My Appy used to be ridden in Civil War re-enactments and the "General" would cut his tail hair to the end of the dock.  UGH!<br>  I have had my Appy for a year now, and I don't think his tail has grown at all!  (It has, just doesn't seem like it!)<br>  Check him out at the link below:<br>  You might have to pause it when he comes on!|`|T7QN2IzGaa	It is genetic. In fact it is a breed characteristic. If you happen to see an Appy with a long tail most likely that horse has some old blood in it other than appaloosa or it is fake. My app has a very sparse tail and mane. I roach the mane.|`|DLl7qEWTaa	Yes it is genetic look at the older lines of appaloosa's most have the rat tail. Look at the newer lines the ones with more QH or TB blood you will see much more tail and mane on these.
Rw7gi86Naa	Remember, a cat’s sense of smell is fourteen times stronger than that of a human. This is why it is so important for you to thoroughly clean the urine spots. Even if you can’t smell it, your cat probably still smells the urine in the carpet, and this can make them want to “re-mark” that spot over and over.<br>  <br>  To remove the smell of urine from just about anything, first clean it with some sort of soap or kitchen cleaner. Then clean it with lemon juice. If you don’t like the smell of lemon juice follow it up with a little bit of vanilla extract. One of the most effective formulas I’ve found for removing ANY odor was from Popular Science Magazine. Mix 1 quart of Hydrogen Peroxide, with 1/4 cup of Baking Soda, and one tablespoon of liquid dishwashing soap. Saturate the affected area, rinse thoroughly with clean water, and the smell is gone. This is non-toxic and safe for your animals and children, and those with allergies. This is especially helpful for removing skunk odor from your outdoor animals. As always, test a small portion of fabric for color fastness, before treating a large area. <br>  <br>  What Won’t Work… There are many home remedies for treating pet stains and odors, and let me stress that most of them are not too bad as far as removing odors for humans’ noses. Vinegar, ammonia, baking soda, laundry detergents, lemon juice, fabric softeners, and commercial strength pet stain removers are all great for removing the odors that humans can smell. However; you will need more to remove the odor for your cat’s nose. An enzymatic cleaner is the best answer, but it is slow and may take more than one application, (Nature’s Miracle is one of them). The Hydrogen Peroxide/Baking Soda combo is fast, but can alter the colors of some fabrics. In the end, you must decide which application is best for your situation. <br>  <br>  Even if you clean a pet stain with soap and water certain micro-organisms remain behind and your pet can smell them. Enzymatic Cleaners are designed to completely eliminate the source of the odor by using enzymes to eat away the micro-organisms that cause the odor. The one drawback to these cleaners is that they are slow; it could take several weeks for them to completely eliminate an odor. Enzymantic Cleaners are available at most pet stores, organic/natural/health food stores, and even some hardware stores. You can also ask your vet for suppliers.<br>  <br>  **Never steam clean a stain. That will only make the stain worse!**|`|PEPWFGNGaa	Lemon juice and bicarb.<br>  Scrub it first then plaster bicarb on while it's damp and let it stand a few hours. Brush it off and rub lemon juice into the area.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	A mixture of water and vinegar really is the best and cheapest way to get rid of the smell.

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	They'd eat snails/shrimp.<br>  <br>  A 3 gallon is in no way suitable for common/comet Goldfish. Each of those fish SHOULD get well over 12" in length! They need more like 50 gallons each. In a 3 gallon they will soon succumb to ammonia poisoning and stunting.<br>  <br>  I suggest you either upgrade to a very large tank - they should get at least 6" in their first year - either yours are babies or severely stunted - or rehome them to someone who's overwintering their pond fish, these are essentially pond fish after all.

We know a lot more now and know that these large and messy fish need MUCH more gallonage than previously written.|`|7HxJvbjMaa	Don't add anything else. You shouldn't even have one of them in a 3 gallon tank, they are going to suffer in there and you'll have to do water changes daily to keep the ammonia down. <br>  That tank size is suitable for a betta or a few neons.<br>  For 3 common goldfish you'll need a 55g tank.|`|TjLCnxkKaa	Even if they aren't goldfish I wouldn't add any more fish to that size tank. Ghost shrimp don't add much to the bio load so if you really really really absolutely must add something else maybe you could get away with a few.
YCvgjLdnaa	hi. I think what a person finds is the worst thing really depends on that person. like if you are a person who enjoys walking, then you wont have a problem with walking your dog. or if you are a person who earns alot of money then you wont mind about the paying of food, vet bills, toys, treats, and the many other things you should buy to keep a dog healthy. <br>  but altoghether, yeah i think the most common thing people dislike is having to pick up their "droppings".. personally the worst part - which is the same or any pet - is losing it..|`|F27az9NEaa	I don't have an issue with cleaning up behind my dog, I work at a kennel so it's part of my job.<br>  <br>  I think perhaps the worst part is when my dog has seizures (he has epilepsy). That's for my individual dog. (my beagle)<br>  <br>  As for my Am Staffs, the worst part of owning them is having ignorant people come up to me and say rude/unnecessary things to prove their incompetence to me.<br>  <br>  But owning dogs in general...I don't think there is the worst part. I enjoy every second of it.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	I'd have to say the stress that comes with knowing that while you care about and love your animals, there are people out there that just don't.<br>  <br>  I don't think there is a single down side or negative to being a pet owner, but I can't wrap my head around the other people out there who would sooner leave a dog to die than pick up a phone and ask for help.|`|hj76FSKdaa	The worst thing is that they limit your mobility because you have to put them in a kennel or find a freind to care for them if the family goes on an extended trip.  For example, we have a new dog, and this summer my family wants to go to Japan -- but we have to figure out what to do with the job -- since we cannot afford to take him on the trip with us.|`|2S0BkT7oaa	Like "rip gigi" and others said, the worst part is the day they die.<br>  <br>  My boy Cody was diagnosed with a large tumor by his liver area last february, 2008. I was heart broken, I knew he didn't have much time left, and the vet couldn't do anything for him. <br>  Then this past november he wouldn't get up to eat or go to the bathroom and my father and brother had to take him to the vet. Before they left, I said I love you over a million times and lots of kisses and etc. I knew that he wasn't going to come back. They left. So eventually the car came back with no dog in sight & my father walks in with a collar and tears in his eyes. He didn't have to say anything.. I knew. <br>  <br>  <br>  I was actually crying while writing this.. I guess you never fully get over it.|`|v0RsFaAzaa	The only thing that I think is the worst thing about owning a dog, is when the day comes, where they end up with an illness or they have been injured and you have to say goodbye to them, knowing that you did everything you could to treat the problem they had, but still could not save them!

I can cram my dog full of shots for diseases that no longer exist, and a bunch of crap to rack up a vet bill, but I can't get them a shot for something like parvo, that could in fact kill my dog.

However even the most well breeds dogs, even if there linage is low risk for Hip dysplasia, doesn't mean the resulting pups will NOT have this problem down the future, but responsible breeeders greatly reduce the chance,  plus proper exercise and weight control also have a part to play in reducing hip dysplasia problems. <br>  <a href="http://dogs.about.com/cs/generalcare/a/breeder_flags.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dogs.about.com/cs/generalcare/a/b...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_adoption_information/how_to_find_a_good_dog_breeder/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_adoption_in...</a><br>  <br>  Example of what cost the responsible breeder will fork out.<br>  <a href="http://www.godivalabs.com/cost.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.godivalabs.com/cost.html</a><br>  <br>  Most people are surprised to learn that we have a very large pet overpopulation problem here in the United States. There are so many animals born DAILY that it boggles the mind! <br>  This is a nightmare problem that doesn’t ever seem to get better. The Humane Society of the United States estimates that there are over 70,000 puppies and kittens born every twenty-four hours. That is a whole lot of babies! To even attempt to place those numbers of animals is impossible. There are about seven animals to every human born. The sad fact is that just is not possible to place them all. <br>  <br>  Every year over 20 million animals end up in a shelter. Over 15 million of them are killed (euthanized is the nice term). Of those animals 61% of the dogs and 75% of the cats are killed. Very few of these are claimed and there are many more that die from disease, starvation, animal attacks and cars! Anyone who sees these facts must agree that not neutering an animal is contributing to mass cruelty and irresponsibility! <br>  <br>  Many people feel that neutering an animal is cruel, it isn’t. The fact is that it is actually much healthier and more beneficial to your animal. The terms related to this procedure "fixed" and "spayed" for the females ( Terms: "*****" for dogs or "Queen" for cats ) or "altered" for the male (Terms: "Dog" for canines or "Tom" for cats) are pretty negative but the procedure is a very loving and positive thing to do for your pet.|`|bfe89b40e0344af279288338e469b235aa	hip dysplasia is a multigene trait with major nutrition & exercise factors<br>  <br>  THis means a dog raised in perfect conditions may have good hips on x-ray but have genes that under less ideal conditions are disaster and the breeder unknowing passes it on that way.<br>  Also kennel A has been breeding good hips by not having #1 of say  3 genes needed to produce hip dysplasia but kennel B has been doing te same thing by not having gene #2. Breed a dog from Kennel A and one from kennel B and things could be disastrouss<br>  <br>  the reputable breeder screen carfully and devote much $$ to better screening tests but are only human ....<br>  The puppmills don't' care had have a MUCH higher rate of dysplasia|`|AA10029366	There would really be no point in having a working dog with bad hips. A dog with bad hips can't work...and it certainly can't herd sheep all day, or chase down a suspect in the street!!<br>  <br>  Your friend is misinformed. GSDs have a higher incidence of Hip Dysplasia due to their popularity and the poor breeding practices this popularity has caused.<br>  <br>  As others have said, responsible GSD breeders *eliminate* Hip Dysplasia from their lines. You can find good working lines in the breed with a small incidence of hip problems. Could you imagine a police dog or drug/bomb detection dog with bad hips? How could it do its job?|`|yTmqHvCTaa	While I will admit, GSD's bred by reputable breeders have worked extremely hard on breeding out hip dysplasia, I would never consider buying one of conformation lines.<br>  <br>  If I were to get one, I'd search for ones with history still in the herding side, but that would be extremely hard.<br>  <br>  I think the sloping top lines have gotten so bad in recent years, that they are unnattractive and I'm fairly certain it's bad for the dog structurely. But, I'm not in the breed, so I couldn't be certain.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	reputable breeders of GSD have bred out the hip dysplasia.. what you are referring to is BYB and puppymillers who do not screen their breeding stock  etc. etc.<br>  <br>  your friend is wrong
ELIKp5tDaa	i had a dog that did that<br>  we had to crate him when we went to work or he would get into everything and destroy food, furniture, clothes shoes and everything<br>  he would howl though, not just whimper and some neighbours called humane society on us because they thought we were beating the dog..<br>  that damn dog costs us hundreds of dollars from the stuff he just chewed and destroyed<br>  he would even get into teh fridge and take food out, get onto the stove and counters and rip spices open<br>  i hated the dog<br>  im glad the guy who owned him dumped me lol|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I am confused as to why you left her in the apartment alone while you walked your other dog.  you could leave her in the area with plenty of toys and bones and a radio or tv on.  I practice leashes with my puppies in my fenced back yard, and I use my older dogs for the example.  I don't really understand why you left her in the apartment.  I am sure she felt abandoned.|`|yPhCujOvaa	I'm dealing with a similar issue and it has been a long road so far.  Pretty much, your dog is probably very anxious without you.  So, you need to both devalue your arrival home and give her some independence training.  I will often wait for my puppy to play on her own then just leave the room, to let her realize that she can play on her own without me being there.  You can also try some longer distance "stay" commands.  Put her in a sit/stay, then gradually work up to the point where you can back out of the room, but she can still see you.  Eventually, get to the point where she will sit and stay without being able to see you in the other room.<br>  <br>  To devalue your arrival, completely ignore her when you come home for a while and never reward excitement with a pat on the head.  Always wait for her to calm down, ask for a sit, then pet her.  This will help her understand that your arrival is not the greatest thing in the world (since you always make her work for affection anyway) and that you do not approve of her over-excited behavior, since you waited until she was calm to pet her.<br>  <br>  One more thing to address is that you should never respond, positively or negatively to a whine.  This lets the dog know that if she whines, something will happen and you will respond, making it more likely that she will whine (and whine louder) next time.  You need to mentally acknowledge a legit whine, but do not respond to it for a few minutes.

AA11621713	I'm not sure about the insurance requirements for Oregon, but make sure your insurance covers your property and other people riding your horses.  <br>  Also, you will probably want the kids to sign a waiver so that if one of them does get injured, they cannot sue you.<br>  <br>  You do not have to be certified to teach lessons.  People generally look for certified instructors, but you already have the clients and that's why your rates are low.  You have to be 18 to become a level one certified instructor anyways.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3rt8oKIzaa	If you go to a certain barn, all you might need is insurance. I think that you should come up with a price that isn't too expensive, but isn't too cheap. Also, make sure that you give the person a good lesson, that is well worth the money. ;) Good luck!|`|UcMCdlJSaa	where do you live, like what state in Indiana u have equine hazard insurance and you would get more pay if you had a license. the lady that gave me lessons charged 20$ an hour and had no license.|`|RHUPEuG1aa	My horse instructor is 17 and charges about $35 dollars a lesson. Insurance depends on where you live, also before you start giving lessons you need to get child/parent information and a wavier saying that accidents can happen in horseback riding and you can't sue (something like that) that's what my trainer has and you should charge more than ten dollars a lesson also.

3n60UxgQaa	1.  Get a betta.  No goldfish.  Goldfish will grow to be huge and will require 20+ gallon when older.  Usually not the investment someone wants to make.  (It costs a lot more in the long run too.)<br>  <br>  2.  Yes, get a heater. There are heaters for 2.5 gallon tanks.  They go for about $5-15 at Wal Mart.  (The $5 is really cheap and crappy.

I would throw away this tank and obtain something much bigger with a proper filtration system. Goldfish can grow pretty big (upto 30cm/12" with the right care) and need a 180cm tank or better still a pond once they are fully grown. Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) are a tropical fish which will surely die in water that is too cold. <br>  <br>  I would suggest that you do some more research into the many subjects of fishkeeping (such as cycling, water quality, dietary requirements and maintanence) before buying any fish.|`|dd860156f3fc1c16946b23f4efe039b8aa	^ She's starting to do research by asking.  It's kind of a refreshing change from the "I just got a fish umm do I need to feed it or anything?" questions.<br>  <br>  Goldfish are out of the question for a tank that size.  It's the general recommended minimum for a betta.  ( <a href="http://velvetdragon.com/bettas/caresheet.html#housing" rel="nofollow">http://velvetdragon.com/bettas/caresheet...</a> )  Assuming you get a betta:<br>  <br>  1. Did you get one of those tank "kits"?  (e.g. a Minibow, Eclipse Explorer, etc.)  Those filters are pretty useless.  A lot of people here will tell you to learn how to cycle a tank, etc. etc. - not exactly.  Smaller tanks are harder to cycle, and bettas (being both surface and gill-breathers) don't NEED filtration.  They do need very clean water, and 100% water changes every 5 days will generally keep a 2.5 gallon tank ammonia-free.  I'm going to keep your eyes from crossing now- the cycling process is a bit complex.<br>  You can read about bettas and filtration here: <a href="http://www.ultimatebettas.com/index.php?showtopic=13003" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultimatebettas.com/index.php?...</a><br>  <br>  50 degrees will freeze a betta.  78-80 degrees is ideal, and a 2.5 gallon is big enough for an adjustable 25 watt heater.  The 7 watt mini heaters aren't adjustable, so the water temperature fluctuates if you turn on the heat or air conditioner.  Even small temperature changes really stress bettas and make them prone to illness, so consistency is key. <br>  A 7 watt is too small for a 2.5 gallon, anyway, especially if the water is 50 degrees.<br>  <br>  Petco and Petsmart don't always sell 25 watt heaters, but online stores like Big Al's have them much cheaper, anyway.

The fish tank you get is false advertising because goldfish need 20+ gallons. As for the heater you definitely need one for a betta. <br>  Here are 2 made for 2.5 gallons:<br>  <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/102429/Hydor-Mini-Aquarium-Heater.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/102429/Hydo...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10291808" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  One is from petco and one is from walmart.<br>  I have both of them and they both work really well.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Bettas Do need filters. They can live without them but they will have a shortened life. If you got a minibow or marineland tank the filtersd are good unless you got the minibow 2.5 in black. If you got a minibow 2.5 that isn't black the filter is perfectly fine. Also if you got any marineland kit the filter is good.<br>  EDIT2: You can't put 2 bettas together or they will kill each other.

jpS9wgu8aa	in male rats it may make them a little less active and less aggressive (assuming that was an issue to begin with) with girls though it isn't 100% necessary to get them spayed especially if you have the males and females separated in different cages. but as far as personality changes it is possible for it to affect their moods and behavior. It shouldn't be a complete personality make over though.|`|BWez86Ldaa	Sounds like it's just her personality. I've never noticed a difference in spayed/natural female rats. Generally, it's males who have the behavioral difference when neutered.

Anyway, when a rattie is more laid back than others, it's usually just personality.

Border Collie, this is a herding dog that works on a farm and loves to run, run, run.<br>  2. Pitbull or Americn Staffordshire Terrier, they have stamina and are actually big lap dogs/big babies.<br>  3. Boxer, they have lots of energy but are a bit goofy at times.<br>  <br>  A small breed dog that loves to burn energy would be a Jack Russell Terrier.<br>  <br>  Also think of your weather; is its cold and you've got a short-hair dog you'll need a little jacket for him. If its hot out you'll need to carry water and a collapsible dish. If you run at night, you need to put some sort of reflecting vest/collar on the dog for his safety.

She'll let them out when they're ready. good luck!|`|67EaIAvbaa	move the toys out of the way and set her bed up there...or...i would find a similar safe place for her,obviously she doesn't want that spot you made.|`|pFs71HsHaa	That is where she feels safe with her kitties. If possible move her box under the bed.|`|ApG0DpzXaa	The box you have made for her is too exposed.  Her instincts are telling her to keep them in a small easily defended space like inside of a hollow log.  Try putting her box under the bed where she wants to go.  Or, if that's too much of a risk that he'll step on them in the middle of the night, in another small warm dimly lit place and close her in the room with that nest so she can't reach the bed.<br>  <br>  Do not handle (pick up and hold) the babies until they are older.<br>  <br>  Please, Please get your cat and the kittens spayed ASAP.  Your local shelter can tell you where the local low cost or free spay program is located, and what ages they will do the kittens at.|`|UQdqzLgfaa	i have had about a dozen cats have litters of kittens.  In my experience, i've found out that you can't make them do what they don't want to do.  If she wants to move them, she's going to no matter what.  She doesn't like the box, because she didn't find the place, you gave it to her, and therefore you have power over it (in her mind).  So if she does move the babies under your brother's bed, if its not any trouble to anyone else, let her.  She will be able to take care of them much more and she won't abandon any of them either.  Mama cats do that when they don't like the way their babies are being handled.  She can take care of them just fine.  Good luck!|`|W20KslFzaa	That is very VERY normal behavior.  She wants them safe and hidden from the world.  There isn't much you can do except try to find another dark out of the way place for her and her babies and hope she'll take that over.<br>  A closet with some blankets or towels will usually work, but not always.  It's just instinct on her part to try to keep them hidden from predators, nothing you can do but wait for her comfort level to rise to a point where she'll bring them out.|`|CadIYXdXaa	It sounds like she doesn't feel the box is safe enough.

Make her understand that she needs to stay there. Or maybe she needs more....stuff around her. Maybe there's to much Traffic going on where she is right now.|`|ugCaMO3saa	its normal with cats, they like to make sure their kittens are safe, so they pick a completely random spot to hide them and protect them.|`|PmGeeUheaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Congratulations!!!!  What she is trying to do is take her kittens to a quiet place, away from others and probably all the commotion that is going on around her.  It's part of their instinct, she wants them to be safe, and by hiding them, she thinks that they are safe then.<br>  <br>  What you can do is move her box, her and her kittens to a separate room, one that is a little darker, quieter, and gives her the space that she needs.  Don't isolate her, or lock her up in a room, though, because she needs you and your family to support her, pet her, and give her lots of love during this special time.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!!!!<br>  <br>  ~~|`|gbJWDnx2aa	The thing with cats is they want to make sure that the kittens are safe and hidden. Obviously she thinks underneath the bed is the best option. Maybe try putting her and her kittens in a room and close the door.

She is looking for a place that she feels is the safest for her kittens with the least amount of outside contact.  Maybe put the box under that bed.  Modify the box  to fit and put it down there.

KEYgd73saa	Melafix and Pimafix are both useless for treating actual infections.  They're holistic pieces of garbage that are good for nothing other than making API profits.  Ich Away is a MUCH better product (malachite green based, which is proven against fungus, unlike Melafix/Pimafix), and will indeed treat fungus very effectively.  The red vein is likely nothing more than inflamation from the infection, and should go away as the fungus clears up.  Maracyn 2 is minocycline, which is only useful against bacteria, not fungus.|`|7HxJvbjMaa	I think Pimafix is the one for fungus, not Melafix. <br>  Out of the two you have I think the Melafix is the gentler, more natural approach.

RnydKwARaa	Every dog is different, whats his breeding and his background?<br>  <br>  Generally Greyhounds/whippets/salukis are known to be quite dogs however when you throw another breed into the mix that can change, i have a Bedlington (terrier) x whippet, the only time he barks is if he gets really excited while playing.<br>  <br>  There really is no telling though<br>  <br>  Good luck with your new Lurcher, when you have had one you will fall in love and be a Lurcher fan forever!|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Lurchers are mixes so know one knows. But if i would have to guess i would say yes considering they are hound mixes.|`|qTfju2ggaa	It depends on the mix. Of my past dogs, all lurchers, only 1 barked a lot and she had a large dollop of collie in her make up. I currently have a salukix whippet and a greyhound. My greyhound boy never makes a peep, the only noise I hear from him is his snoring! My saluki/whippet girl is pretty quiet, hardly ever barks, but she does have  the saluki quirk of singing when she wants attention. I'd agree that the more working dog in the breeding, the more likely they are to bark, but each dog is different...one of the many things you'll get to learn about your new hound.<br>  Good luck and hope you get years of happiness with your new pointy dog!!|`|P3vZh1ajaa	my Roxy never knew how to bark when we got her, she was a rescue and didn't even know how to play or wag, i taught her how to bark on command and she would ask to go in the garden, but she was quiet, you can get noisy ones, but as said befor they are mixed dogs, do its hit and miss, but as stated above i would avoid a collie type as they can be vocal.<br>  dont know what was in my girl but she was like a smaller stocky(er) prettier greyhound, lovely gentle nature. BUT they will raid your bins given half the chance, they are known scavengers xx|`|5WggUmJeaa	The more sighthound in the dog the less they bark, as a rule.<br>  So if it is predominantly greyhound, saluki or whippet then it should be quiet.

No guarantee but Usually they take after the  quiet sighthound side of the family|`|LHoIQWbWaa	I think it depends on the circumstances. Ours is a rescue dog, and he wouldn't shut up at the rescue centre when he was surrounded by other dogs. But more or less as soon as we got him home, he calmed right down, and now he'll only bark if he's really, really excited and someone knocks on the door.
KEYgd73saa	By most standards, it's not strong enough.  However, you only listed a bunch of tiny fish, so the filter isn't gonna have to work a whole lot.  The biggest problem will actually be keeping the tank circulating well, which you may need an extra powerhead to accomplish.  It may be a better idea to get 2 Fluval 305s.
Drnpe4T5aa	Long answer coming!!<br>  We had two boys (neutered) who had been pals for years.  Then, one night, in the middle of the night, Poof!  All you-know-what broke loose!  Fur, nails, screaming, hissing...  it was terrible.  We separated them, only to have them start in again the following day.  I thought for sure we would have to get rid of one.  They couldn't even look at each other without hissing.  But!!!  We went to a behavioral specialist at the U of M and she totally saved the day.  Our to-do list was a bit detailed, and took place over a few weeks, but did work, marvelously.  Here's what we did:<br>  First, get a room that can support a potty box, food, water and kitty.  We just used our bedroom.  Put one cat in the room - the other cat gets the run of the house.  You will be trading cats every 24 hours.  Don't let them see each other when you are trading.  Give them a couple weeks like this.  <br>  Next, find a place in your home, like a long hallway, that provides enough room.  Instead of regualrly dumping food into a bowl for dinner, you will start positive conditioning for them both.  Put you and #1 at one end, hubby and #2 at the other.  They each have their food dishes - let them see each other.  If they eat without growling, hissing, etc - do this far apart for about 3 days.  If they growl and hiss, you may have to just start with them not able to see each other.  After 3 days of "positive" eating sessions (no growling, hissing, etc) you can move closer, by about 1-2 feet.  Don't push it.  Again, feed and watch their body language.  Continue in this manner, going closer slowly every few days as they become more used to each other.  But keep them separated the rest of the time, still alternating cats who are in the room alone.  <br>  Once you start the feeding conditioning, you also start scenting them.  Cat's have scent glands in their cheeks and along their jaw, as well as behind their paw pads.  The paws are more of an aggressive "mine" marker.  The jaw is more of a "this is mine, and it's very special to me" marker - which is why cats will frequently rub their faces on their people's faces.  You will use this in your favor.  <br>  Take an old washcloth.  Wipe #1 with the cloth, along the jaw - it's just like petting, the cat won't be bothered by it.  Then go to #2 and do the same.  Then go back to #1 and wipe again.  (Both cats are now marked with each other's "I love this thing!" marking scent.)  Do this daily, before the feeding conditioning.  <<Edit:  Don't wash the cloth - you won't be able to smell anything, but this will help to more thoroughly "scent" the cats>><br>  Eventually, the cats will be quite close together and will be able to smell each other.  Having been thoroughly marked with their own marker, they will feel much less inclined to be aggressive.  <br>  The key is to speak quietly, and no sudden movements or loud noises during the feeding sessions.  <br>  If anything goes wrong, and a cat startles or gets suddenly distressed, end the session.  Go back a pace and start there the next day.  You want the feeding sessions to be positive. <br>  It will take time, but you can get these guys back together.  Feel free to email me if you have questions.|`|wuPdjJfsaa	Separate them into different parts of the house.  Do this for a week or two.  Then gradually introduce them to each other again.  If they start attacking again, either leave the room or make very loud noises to scare the cats.  They will eventually get the hint.  If this doesn't help, talk to your vet.
ZT0K3q2Aaa	Obviously it was taken off the shelves for a reason|`|lFdWmDjGaa	Nope, there was probably a health concern with it so they took it away.
Z1ftrUJuaa	Yes, I do believe you are. Since you have quite a long upper body, you look quite tall on your pony. Generally people with long torsos and long legs need horses that are also long, in the back and neck, to balance them out, or are wider. A tall, skinny horse might not work as well as a shorter, stockier horse. You are quite long in the torso and leg, when you bend your face is almost at your pony's ears, and your legs are almost to the point of wrapping around your pony's barrel. Your torso going so far forward might be the reason for your pony's refusals- your off-balanced weight on her forehand is causing her to be off-balanced and not willing and/or capable of jumping. <br>  <br>  While I know you probably love your pony, if you would like to compete at all, I think I might be a good idea to start looking for a taller horse. Even something between 14.2 and 15.3 would be better for you. I don't think you need something as tall as 16.2. It's a hard decision to make but I think you'll make the right one. At the very least, try riding a couple of taller horses, take pictures of it, and compare- which do you think you look better on?<br>  <br>  good luck! :)|`|meoRbjgCaa	Wow she's cute!  Yes you look tall on her, but she seems to be able to carry you just fine.  If your showing they probably would think your a bit tall, if your not then I wouldn't worry about it.|`|sJBFukoZaa	I don't think you are too tall for your pony. But that is just my opinion.|`|qNuynJNLaa	I'd say your a little bit to tall and out growing her quite a bit. It can be hard saying bye to a pony so if you think you are too big and people are saying you i'd consider loaning her out to a nice family and getting your self something in the range of 15 - 16hh, this is what i'm doing i'm loaning my 14hh gelding out, as i'm 5ft 9" so quite a bit big like you are on your pony, but she does look like she can manage, I seen the buck in another video hehe, but you don't have to let her go just yet =]|`|eXDDODfHaa	yeah i think a 14.2 would be better than 13.2 hands
SZOMVGBRaa	Well you have a live bearer so they will come out like Mini full sized fish already developed so that makes them MUCH easier to care for than most fry. You want them to live you will buy a separate 5 or 10 gallon tank and cycle it out ASAP. buy a sponge filter, heater and air pump for it, that's all you need, just a bare bottom tank and no decor. You put the prego female in this tank and then you wait, as soon as she has the baby's you move her back into the Other main tank and leave the baby's alone, she will eat her baby's if you leave her in there. Then you feed the baby's crushed powdered flake food or Commercial fry food. A few will make it to adult hood. Or if you want the majority to make it you need to hatch your own baby brine shrimp from eggs you buy. You can google how to do this, many site give you a how too but its not for beginners. Don't get me wrong, its VERY easy to hatch them but your not gonna want to keep up with it for some molly fry, not worth the effort.  But that's how breeders do it though, if you want to raise the majority of your fry you need a fry tank and all the trimmings. <br>  <br>  est of luck to you :  )|`|kQDWVRvzaa	First of all you need to get the mother fish in a hatchery net or small clip on tank. You can buy them at the pet store. This will make sure that no other fish eat them. Including the mother. You can also buy baby fish food. You can also just crumble up some flake food real fine. It works. Get another small tank to put them in after they all come. Doesn't have to be fancy. Sailfin mollies are quite profitable to raise and sell. If you raise them to maturity you can sell them back to the pet store as long as they are healthy. I use to raise allot of fish. Kept some in baby swimming pools we had so many. GL PS you can leave the mnother in the tank with the other fish and some of the babies might survive if you have allot of vegetation for them to hide in. Remeber the other fish see them as food.|`|NwZ6yrq7aa	Get a breeder net to keep the babies in. You can put the female in just before birth o save most to all of the babies or let her just have them in the tank.  I personally just let my molly have her babies when she's ready(I don't separate her from the rest).  I only end up with a few strong babies that can hide and fend for themselves.  If I see them I catch them and put them in a separate net.  You can finely crush your regular flakes for the babies or get a fry food like first bites.  Have fun!|`|0WyFs0q0aa	get a fish divider|`|0rAgtGNgaa	divide your tank (you can get a divider from walmart or a pet store) and separate the big fish from the babies.

You don't know if it has rabies, or if it is potentially dangerous with other animals|`|kFVaMDHEaa	thats really sad, and really scary.  I dont know why it would only want fur though.  I doubt it could have been a human?  It would have to have claws.

Rpj9qArgaa	Your dog is just blowing coat. Yes Labs shed year round but twice a year more than usual. I get a new Vacuum about every six months. All of my dogs are big shedders. I don't buy the expensive ones anymore cause they don't seem to last any longer than the cheaper ones in my house. We vacuum two or three times a day.|`|Bw18seFqaa	a good diet and daily brushing is your best defense..<br>  <br>  try giving him a good conditioning bath to loosen the dead hairs from his coat..  use a slicker brush or an under coat rake..  with one hand, pet him backwards to expose the undercoat..  with your other hand, use the brush/rake to brush out the undercoat..  you will remove more of his hair this way.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you're going to look into buying a more expensive vacuume.. I'd suggest checking into the dyson animal..  I have a hairless dog and tile floors, so I couldnt tell you personal experience.. but I know of rescue people with several shedding dogs who have told me that they love their dyson..  its the only vacuume that hasnt choked on the pet hair.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	First, try a Furmigator. They work well on lab-type coats. <br>  <br>  Second, many dog folks swear by Dyson. I have tile floors instead <G>|`|TAfyS52naa	Your lab is blowing it's winter coat.  Not much you can do about it.  Try a curry comb, yes the same as they use on horses.  brush in small circles, the fur will weave itself right on to the curry comb and then you can peel it right off the comb.  Easier clean up not so much flying fur.  <br>  <br>  As too the vacuum question, I have a Kenmore canister 12amp and I like it.  On the dogster.com website we debated this question and there were many different answers that it seemed to be personal choice to much extent.  Though stand up often have better suction.  What did seem to be common was that expensive did not necessarily mean better.  Try the curry comb first and check out dogster for info it's a great site dedicated to dog owners and free to join.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	I have had an Oreck for years.

Rw7gi86Naa	Please don't declaw a poor innocent cat just because your stupid landlord says you should. People who make this ridiculous rule obviosly don't know much about cats. Cats NEED to scratch, and they are usually VERY easily taught to use a scratching post instead of the carpet, (landlords are always so concerned with their cheap carpet, LOL). Even when cats do decide to scratch on something, it's usually furniature instead of carpet because they like to reach and stretch their legs, while marking their territory. <br>  <br>  <br>  You could try to help educate him so maybe he'll change his mind. If that doesn't work I guess the only thing left would be to adopt a cat who is already declawed, or move. Here is some information:<br>  <br>  If you’re thinking about having your cat declawed, there are many things you should know before you make your decision.  The surgery is basically an American trend, and is considered inhumane and is illegal in many countries, (England, Scotland, Wales, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal, Belgium, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Yugoslavia and Japan).  If that doesn’t impact your opinion about declawing, maybe this website will help you decide: <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a> <br>  <br>  I believe that people who have their cats declawed are uneducated.  It is not very difficult to train your cat to use a scratching post.  The surgery is not simply a trimming of the claws, it’s an amputation of the distal phalanx, including bones, ligaments, and tendons! To remove the claw, the bone, nerve, joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and the extensor and flexor tendons must all be amputated.  If you were to make a comparison, it would be like having the last joint of each of our fingers chopped off.  So of course it is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery.  There are often many complications in the healing process, including infection often from litter box use, resulting in a life-long aversion to the litter box.  Other declawed cats that can no longer mark with their claws, will mark with urine instead, resulting in inappropriate elimination problems.  <br>  <br>  Many cats who have been declawed are traumatized and become withdrawn, nervous, fearful and/or aggressive.  Cats who went through the painful surgery are more prone to resort to biting when they feel threatened.  Since cats have emotional feelings, (just like we do) they can resent you if you decided to get them declawed.  All of these things can cause depression and ultimately lead to an overweight cat.<br>  <br>  If a cat who has been declawed accidentally escapes, he/she would be in great danger.  A cat needs it's claws to defend itself, as well as to escape by climbing.  The constant state of stress, caused by a feeling of defenselessness may make some declawed cats more prone to disease.  Also they cannot stretch their back and shoulder muscles like they do naturally when they dig their claws into a scratching post.  <br>  <br>  One popular alternative is Soft Paws.  They are lightweight vinyl nail caps that you glue on the cat's front claws.  They're great for households with small children and are extremely useful for people who are away from home all day and can't exercise the watchfulness necessary to train a cat to use a scratching post.  Soft Paws are easy to apply and last about four to six weeks.  They come in clear or colors--which are really fun.<br>  <br>  Most common types of damage are scratched furniture, ripped carpets and shredded wallpaper.  You want to eliminate the problem before it occurs.  Buy or build a stable, tall scratching-post, right from the start.  Here are some tips to do it right: If your cat is scratching your furniture or rugs, here is some advice on training them to use a scratching post:<br>  - The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope, (mine like the carpeted ones)<br>  - Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household <br>  - Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk <br>  - Introduce a new scratching-post with some catnip sprinkled on its surface.  Cats love that and it’s more attractive to them <br>  - If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, say "NO" and gently carry your cat to the desired post.  Demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.  If the cat doesn‘t catch on after trying this repeatedly for a few days, gently pick up his paws rub them along the post.<br>  - Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and plenty of affection.  The cat needs to know that using the scratching post results in positive things such as affection, playing and treats.<br>  - When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>  - Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself <br>  - Try some repellent like pepper-dust or some commercial products on your furniture to keep your cat off these areas<br>  - Be persistent and don't give up too soon<br>  <br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it. Here's a website that shows you how:  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a>|`|DtkLsetkaa	Your landlord is cookoo.  If he is saying you have to have a declawed cat, you could consider adopting one who is already declawed, there are MANY in shelters that need good loving homes!!   There is a product called soft paws that glues onto the claw and prevents the cat from scratching.  Also, cats can be trained to scratch a post instead of the furniture.  I would really think about a cat that's already declawed tho, that might be your best bet and be a happy medium between you and the landlord.|`|VMY7No0eaa	i WOULD talk to the housing authority and see IF THEY CAN demand that.<br>  And check with the SPCA and find out if it is even legal in your area.  (some areas it's against the law to mutilate a cat like that) <br>  I would NEVER HAVE THIS SERGERY on a cat.<br>  If you want one declawed call around to some of the rescue groups and often they have them already done.<br>  <br>  Then READ THIS....GIVE to the landloard. <br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  DECLAWING <br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/od/declawing/tp/reasonsnot.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/od/declawing/tp/re...</a><br>  <br>  Declawing May Lead to Litter Box Problems<br>  Declawed cats often associate the pain when digging in litter with the litter box itself, and will avoid it, choosing softer carpeting instead.<br>  Declawing Sometimes Leads to Biting Problems<br>  When cats lose their ability to give a quick warning scratch, they will often resort to their second line of defense: a good, hard bite. The cat's owner may sometimes find himself the victim, just when he thinks his cat is enjoying a petting session.<br>  Cats Need the Exercise Their Claws and Toes Provide<br>  Watch a cat stretch, whether horizontally on a carpet or vertically with a tall scratching post. He will grab the carpet or sisal with his claws, using the resistance to pull and stretch his muscles. Cats' claws actually play a large and positive role in their amazing muscle tone and agility. <br>  Altered Gait May Lead to Later Joint Problems<br>  Domestic cats are digitigrade, meaning they walk on their toes. Walking with an altered gait because of the lack of the first digit of the toes can affect all the joints of the leg, resulting later in arthritis of the hip and other joints. Jean Hofve, DVM describes this joint deterioration more fully, in her article, "A Rational Look at Declawing." <br>  Cats Need to Be Cats for Their Entire "Nine Lives" <br>  Honestly, if a cat could speak human language, do you really think, given a choice, he'd say, "Sure thing. Cut off part of my toes?" His claws and toes are an integral part of making a cat a cat. Would you honestly want him to be anything less, especially since there are humane alternatives? It's your decision, but please take your cat's needs into serious consideration before making such a drastic and permanent choice.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	the only alternative is - dont get a cat.<br>  cats have claws, if you cant accept that fact, dont get a cat.<br>  in the case of your landlord, he is convinced a cat will do more damage then a 2 year old human with a glass of koolaide in one hand and a magic marker in the other.<br>  <br>  if you owned your own home, you can try nail caps, which i believe are the tubes you refer to, many have had success with these, or just give them scratching posts and put two sided sticky tape on the legs of your furniture. they hate the sticky feeling.<br>  i understand bubble wrap works too, but i never tried it.|`|HwujORd2aa	I agree, adopt one that's declawed if it must be.  <br>  An alternative is to see if the landlord will let you get one if you promise to trim the claws. We trim our kitties' claws (it takes two people with ours, but it is possible to do yourself too, with patience!) or you can get it professionally done for a few dollars each month.|`|b3b3292f0a82969ceed4f00b38611bccaa	Thank you for not declawing! <br>  <br>  Tubes? Sort of. I think you are thinking of soft paws. <br>  <br>  www.softpaws.com<br>  <br>  They do work very well. <br>  <br>  Have you considered an adopting/rescuing an already declawed adult cat from a shelter? You would be following your LL's rules and doing good by giving an abandoned cat a home!!!! :o)<br>  <br>  www.petfinder.com will help you find a declawed cat near you that needs a home!|`|LURQBU86aa	The tubes that you're referring to are called nail caps. Soft paws and Soft Claws are two different brands. They're little vinyl nail caps that are attached with a tiny bit of non-toxic glue. I have used them on my cats and they work great. It takes a few minutes for the cat to get used to them but it's a great alternative to declawing!|`|1JT6wjzraa	Most places up here make you sign an agreement that you will not declaw cats. The tubes seem okay but I recently got a cat and just have her nails cut every few weeks and they arent sharp enough to do any damage to our leather couch or anything. <br>  I wouldn't even consider getting a cat declawed...|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	Your landlord's an ape. if he won't back down, get a cat from a rescue centre that has already been declawed. Don't get a cat and then declaw it, it's a foul thing to do to a cat.

CBmizuGwaa	...water...fish...plants...light...tank cover...bottom-gravel, fish food...thermometer...  "money" !|`|SbU5nZFXaa	Most pet stores will have a starter kit in most tank sizes.  My 25 litre (or gallon i dont remember) kit came with the a lighting, filter and heating systems, a few artifical plants, gravel and food.  Besides those things you might to buy castles or logs where your fish can hide.  I highly recommend that you don't buy real plants.  Ours had snail eggs hiding on them and within a week we had over 200 small snails in the tank.  Also for the fish.  You only want as many inches of fish as you do litres of water.  So for 35 litres or gallons you really only want at max 35 inches of fish.  So when you buy your fish ask how big they will grow.  If you are going to buy a large number of fish you also might want to buy a bubble air system to circulate the water a little more in the tank.  You also might want to invest in a sucker fish.  They eat all the algae so it;s way easier to keep the tank clean.|`|9cWOHMnzaa	You will need a heater if you plan to do tropical fish. There are lots of options when it comes to filters. If you are not planning on doing any live plants any lighting will do. Gravel should be used and cleaned on a regular basis with a gravel syphon. Everything else is purely aesthetics.<br>  <br>  cheers!|`|QwV7DtLGaa	I agree with the guy above u need a Heater and you need a PH kit to test the water..hope this helps!|`|1D8tMCYIaa	First of all, get the tank, filter, heater, hood with light,  gravel, and artificial decorations for your tank BEFORE you get any fish. You will also need ammonia, nitrite and nitrate testers for your water so you can cycle the tank before you add fish.<br>  <br>  The nitrogen cycle is very important for a fish tank to naturally sustain life. If your tank has not been cycled and you add fish, you are well likely to kill them before the 1st week. What happens is that good bacteria needs to build up within the filter and in some parts of the tank gravel so it can accommodate waste that your fish will give out. <br>  <br>  Please check out the links and read up on this cycle so you can have healthy and happy fish.|`|BMri9tITaa	-Heater (50 Watt or more)<br>  -Filter<br>  -Light<br>  -Hood<br>  -Tank<br>  -Gravel (fake or real)<br>  -Plants (fake or real)<br>  -Net<br>  -Fish food (make sure it's for tropical fish.  I prefer granules over flakes)<br>  -5 gallon bucket<br>  -Airline tubing<br>  -Dechlorinator<br>  <br>  You will also need to kick-start your cycle somehow.  Pure ammonia, with no scents or other chemicals added (it doesn't smell/when you shake it, there's no bubbles or foam).  Or toss in a piece of clean shrimp.  Or add something from another tank, a filter pad, some gravel, a decoration, etc.  Make sure you do this after you set up the tank, but before you add fish.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Nitrogen_cycle" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Nitrogen_...</a><br>  <br>  There will be a bacteria bloom.  After about a month, it's safe to add fish.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
KEYgd73saa	No.  Definitely not.  Apple Snails are extremely messy, and you'll soon have fouled water with rising ammonia levels, which won't get converted to nitrite, then nitrate, because the water will be so poorly oxygenated and have so little surface area.  This will eventually kill the snail, which doesn't lend itself to fast growth.  Get it into a filtered, heated tank.|`|WA9Y8QAEaa	I couldn't find the answer to your question, I'm sorry :( but I couldn't find anything saying how it could grow quicker. I did find a link on them if this helps at all <a href="http://www.applesnail.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.applesnail.net/</a><br>  Good luck :)
a2cjwMKcaa	Nitrogen Cycle.<br>  <br>  When you set up a new tank there is no bacteria in the fitler or gravel to process waster ammonia that all fish produce.<br>  <br>  The most delicate fish like the neons and angels die first. The guppies and algae eater are tougher, so some survived.<br>  <br>  Emergency fix, do large partial water changes to remove most of the ammonia and wait.<br>  <br>  After a few weeks the cycle will start and the tank will run smoothly.<br>  <br>  When you start a new tank you must either add only a few fish to start with, or do a full fishless cycle to get the bacteria growing before you add fish. Too many fish too soon, ammonia level builds up, fish die.<br>  <br>  Have a read of the link below for more info on the nitrogen cycle.<br>  <br>  Ian|`|lrrIWHbBaa	Have please check your ph? Do you have a tester kit for the ph? Use your drops according to your directions to raise and lower ph levels in the tank. How long have you had your tank up? You might have to do a water change. Just take it down a little bit and replace it with fresh water. make sure you use fresh starter.|`|jnzSz3tRaa	ok you need to cycle your fish tank which im guessing you didn't do or even know about.<br>  <br>  you should do it without fish but you already have the fish so w.e<br>  <br>  your three fish are going to be fine now, but if you add all the fish at the same time, they all go into shock and die, which im also guessing you did.<br>  <br>  you shouldve researched more before getting that many fish.<br>  <br>  to cycle, you need to get things to test ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite.  first your fish will make the ammonia themselves, which you will need to test daily.  then your water will get mircky, its supposed to happen, that means the nitrate is kicking in, which you will also have to test.  then the ammonia and nitrate will start to go away and the nitrite will start, which again you also have to test.  once the nitrite is down low, your tank is cycled!|`|Jhl17egmaa	if they are saltwater fish you need salt and left over bits of food can cause diseases so try cleaning the tank.<br>  Hope i could help!!
280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	As stated, there is no average life expectancy for a mixed breed dog. The average life expectancy of a German Shepherd is ten to thirteen years. What kind of hound is he or she mixed with? For instance, Greyhounds tend to live ten to twelve years; Bloodhounds tend to live ten to twelve years; Basset Hounds tend to live ten to twelve years; Irish Wolfhounds tend to live six to eight years; Treeing Walker Coonhounds tend to live twelve to thirteen years - it varies breed to breed. <br>  <br>  Obviously, there are any number of factors that could affect a dog's life expectancy. Accidents, inherited conditions, illnesses, environmental stresses, what have you. These must be considered. But, if you take all of those factors out of the equation, I'd assume a German Shepherd/Hound mix would have a life expectancy of about ten to twelve years.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	There is no standard life expectancy for a mutt. It could live to 14 or it could live to 3 or 8 and so on.
65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	Some dogs don't fetch or play with toys. I have a border collie that never liked toys of fetching she is 14 years old and has only gotten the ball and brought it back maybe 10 times in her life. She got bored with it and much rather go after live animals. <br>  <br>  I never tried to train her to do it. But you can. Reward her with treats and love when she does do it.  I just excepted the fact she was not into it. She loves to learn tricks I taught her lots of tricks over the years. She also loved agility type stuff. <br>  <br>  She was a great hiking buddy she had so much energy. When i got tired she would keep me going. She is too old for that know last time she went for a good hike was a year ago. She has slowed down a lot but man it took for ever for her to finally act her age. She did not star to show sings of ageing till she was 11. even then she still would play and go for long walks just not as fast, <br>  <br>  I'm telling you thins because they are great dogs and last forever. pepper is 14 and still getting around great no health problems she too was form the pound. <br>  <br>  So enjoy him and find an activity you both can enjoy and he will become your little buddy or side kick.<br>  <br>  I have 3 dogs my old girl pepper still kicking it old dog style and a pitbul that loves to fetch and will do it for hours so I got my fetching dog. we also have a Pom mix who is a punk.|`|qapJU3tMaa	Please do NOT teach your dog to fetch or play ball, it's called obsessive behavior.  Please find a sheepdog trainer and get your dog on livestock, what Border Collies were bred to do.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Not all dogs enjoy fetching; that's just the way it is.

You might need to come up with a different game he likes better.  My dog liked to find things that we hid for her.|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	Yes Border Collies are easy to train, they love to work and to please their owner. Maybe this one is still a little unsure. Just give him lots of attention and love. But here are something you can try for the fetching game.<br>  For some dogs fetching is just natural, others you must really work hard to train them. It is easier when you start with a small puppy, but adults can also learn. Get him a very special toy, but don't let him haave it. With him near you, just play with the toy. You must really act as if you enjoy it very much playing with this toy. You must almost make him jealous about this toy. Then stop and put the toy somewhere high where he can see it, but not get it. Next day do the same, and the next. Then all of a sudden, when it seems that he really wants this toy throw it and run for it, but let him pick it up, then turn around and run and call him. Just encourage him to carry the toy. If he drops it, that fine just pick it up and play with it again. This might take long, but the crazy you act, the more he will enjoy this game and the likely you will succeed in teaching him to fetch.

wLgGD63raa	Wax worms and pinkies would be a good way to fatten your gecko up. I would not give it the pinkies and wax worms in place of his normal diet, but throw some in every now as then as they are too fattening to be healthy. The only thing they're really good for is putting weight on, which is perfect for this situation. Once your Tokay has fatten up switch back to a leaner diet.<br>  <br>  However if your Tokay does not fatten up you may have an underlying issue such as parasites and will have to find a vet to take it to.|`|ltIuUBXNaa	I would stay away from the pinkies.  I would feed wax worms, butter worms, phoenix worms. In addition to the crickets and any other worms that you may already be feeding her. Make sure that she stays hydrated also.  Good luck, I hope that she makes it.|`|IFEIP5Doaa	You could try something more nutional than waxies or pinkies like phoenix worms, they ae higher in fat than supers and mealworms (which I woldnt ofer mealworms anyways), but also very high in calcium. You can also try things like silkworms and horn worms, again very nutrional. you want to put weight on, but at the same time healthy weight, and a bunch of foods high in fat will put weight on, but all that fat is also very hard on the liver and can cause FLD. The occasional pinky would be fine, but remember pinkies are full of parasites when live, and even frozen.|`|RkK673VHaa	assuming it hasnt got any underlying issues and it just been badly treated, just feed it every day like normal, as long as its eating a good amount it should be fine. maybe put a few more waxworms into its diet than you normally would.
280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	A choking dog is much like a choking person. He'd be gagging, coughing, struggling to breathe and in apparent distress. There may also be excessive salivation.<br>  <br>  If you can see the obstruction in the throat, yes, you can simply reach in and pluck it out. You did the right thing by simply removing the rawhide chip. You do have be careful, though, as you can't blame a dog for biting you if he's panicked and your reaching down his throat.<br>  <br>  There is a "doggy Heimlich," yes. It's quite like the human version. You wrap your arms around the dog and make a fist. Place your fist under his last rib bone, right between the ribs and stomach, just like you would do with a person. Thrust inwards and upwards with your fist a couple times. Just think of the canine anatomy like a human on all fours, and give that "human" the Heimlich Maneuver. <br>  <br>  If you've dislodged the obstruction and the dog still isn't breathing, perform artificial respiration. If there is no pulse, perform CPR.

All dogs will have health issues when they get older, should they live that long.<br>  <br>  Your friend that's a vet can tell you that, and they can tell you all dogs shed.  Some more than others.  The thing with the "Non" shedding dogs is that the fur is a nightmare to keep up with.  I have "Non" shedding dogs right now, and yes, you will find fur in the house.

I do not know anything about health issues.  But I do know many Yorkshires who are still going strong over 15 years.|`|F27az9NEaa	All dogs shed. Some dogs hair is just different than others (more like hair than fur)<br>  Perhaps you could try a hairless dog like the Toy Xolo or Chinese crested.<br>  Each breed of dog has their set of genetic issues, if you get the dog from a reputable, ethical, and responsible breeder that's less of something to worry about.<br>  <br>  Shedding is not the only thing to look at when getting a dog. Temperament, activity level, grooming, ect, are other things to look at. A Maltese and a Toy Poodle are pretty different breeds. Poodles are energetic and a very smart breed, while a maltese may be more relaxed.<br>  <br>  When you decide on a breed (or mix), I suggest getting a few books/magazines on the breed and learn more about it.<br>  Also when deciding on making a purchase, avoid buying online, from pet stores or from backyard breeders (newspaper ads).<br>  <a href="http://www.stoppuppymills.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stoppuppymills.org/</a>|`|iJtuhLMTaa	All dogs shed some just shed less than others.

xKHeYmQJaa	My horse has naturally high, narrow withers.  He is an Arab/Mustang crossbreed.  I have had a very hard time getting a saddle that fit him.  I took my horse to the tack shop and was fitted with saddle after saddle after saddle, until we tried a Tucker trail saddle on him.  Perfect, except for two things.   The seat was 19" and I ride a 15" and the stirrups leathers were way too long (I have a 27" inseam).  So, as it turned out, that saddle fit my Appy & now my husband rides it!<br>  I really, really want an Abetta Arabian Endurance Saddle.  It has no horn, but the pommel sits high and the tree is built narrow and longer, instead of wide & short like a QH saddle.  I found one on e-bay for $345, but I can't afford that right now.  Maybe after I sell my bumper-pull! lol<br>  Your best bet would be to take your horse to the tack shop and let them fit a saddle.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	i ride a paint and saddlebred that both have very high withers, i bought a couple of saddle pads that are cut back, with the padding thicker on the withers than the rest of the pad so that the saddle sits higher up off of the withers|`|RloOJ43haa	I would not worry as much about bareback riding as saddle riding. You are probably not hurting him while bareback, but if the saddle is rubbing him then you certainly are hurting him. The only real solution I know of is to get a saddle with a cut back pommel to accommodate the withers.|`|K4bJgTF4aa	i have the same exact problem...i ride a 17.1hh horse with high withers and a low back.  look in Dover and get the high back pad or something like that.  i can't recall the name, but it is thin in the front and padded in the back.  it makes the rider sit up more and not lean back.  it has helped a lot.|`|7KUYwLB3aa	My gelding has moderately high withers, he's fine with a thick saddle-pad and a correctly fitted saddle. As long as your horse's withers have adequate padding and your saddle fits well then it shouldn't be a problem.|`|58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	Check out this link in regard to why horses 'develop' high withers, and how to find a solution to fitting a saddle to them correctly:<br>  <a href="http://www.jonibentley.co.uk/saddles/saddle%20fitting.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jonibentley.co.uk/saddles/sad...</a>|`|WWYfEX2haa	Well, riding him you are not making his back dip or his withers higher but with a saddle on you could be hurting his back.  I would not worry so much about bareback because it is the tack that will cause the discomfort and pain not you.  For my high withered/low backed fellow I finally have to gave in and got a custom saddle built for him as well as using a pad meant for high withered horses that is sheepskin lined for a little extra padding on his back and withers.  The problem with gel pads is that they are just a little fix and are not attacking the real cause of the problem which is an ill-fitting saddle.|`|vGSKe2sKaa	You should have a professional, or experienced horse person examine the fit of your saddle to make sure it fits. As long as it does, your horse should feel fine while riding under saddle as long as you use your gel pad. As for bareback riding, just make sure that you are not bouncing or moving to much. Also look for signs of discomfort during your bareback ride such as pinned back ears, head tossing, or tail swishing. Many tack stores carry bareback pads that not only make the horse more comfortable, but make you more comfortable! Here is a link for one that I use --<a href="http://www.doversaddlery.com/product.asp?pn=X1-19528&ids=860674778" rel="nofollow">http://www.doversaddlery.com/product.asp...</a> --- It washes easily and is really comfortable for me and my horse. A simple way that you can test back/wither soreness is to just press areas of your horses back with your fingers. If he flinches or does any other "annoyed" behaviors then you no that he is sore from riding. As a last resort, I suppose you could just ride in a permanent two point so that you are not putting any pressure on his back. Haha Just kidding! Good luck!
se27sAUwaa	Go to a high kill shelter in your area. Everything there needs saving!!|`|0mb78CiWaa	Try stopping by your local animal shelter. They have plenty of cats in need of homes there. <br>  <br>  You can also keep an eye on the paper.
nwMBfgcdaa	I wouldn't worry about it at this point.  It is most likely because the dog is settling in with your pack.  She is still also very young.<br>  Walking and playing is a good way.  You could also hand feed for a few days (just becareful she doesn't expect it all the time).<br>  Some dogs just don't get as excited as others.  My oldest GSD isn't much of a tail wagger.  My lab is in full body wiggle when he sees me.  I have learned other cues my GSD gives that he is happy to see me.  <br>  Congrats on the new addition.

H06PtiIAaa	the problem is saltwater goes against common sense.<br>  <br>  HEAR me out.. the mind tells us that a 10 gallon would be easier because it is smaller and cost less.<br>  <br>  <br>  In fishkeeping, saltwater.... the smaller the tank ... the harder it will be to keep.<br>  <br>  WHY?<br>  <br>  Because water is more sensitive in smaller concetrations than in larger,, making larger saltwater tanks for beginners.. at least 55 gallons.<br>  <br>  10 gallon saltwater tanks are beginner sucide. 95 % of beginner saltwater fishkeepers try smaller tanks.... 94% of them fail.<br>  <br>  a 10 gallon saltwater tank is for experts only as the water parameters will change daily meaning that you need to check all of the levels and fix any changes that can occur.<br>  <br>  <br>  Even a 20 gallon is too small for really any fish and the difficultly. <br>  <br>  But i would suggest you wait for the 55 gallon, add live sand and live rock. around 1 pound of each per gallon. This will easily cost you hundreds of dollars.<br>  <br>  Then mix your salt, use hydrometer to measure the salinity, it should be around 1.022<br>  <br>  Then add your filters and protein skimmer... another 200 dollars. <br>  <br>  Wait for about 4 -6 weeks until the cycle is over, then you can add some fish... not alot because from your freshwater stocking you like to overstock and saltwater is less than freshwater..<br>  <br>  Stay with fish only with live rock, a beginner doenst know enough about saltwater to work with corals and reef tanks as there are even more water parameters that need checking and fixing. Plus the need for a 400-500 dollar lighting system..<br>  <br>  <br>  So your not ready... your freshwater tanks are by far overstock  and those two cichldis need around 125 gallon tank... saltwater is not for beginners and at least a 55 gallon aquarium is need plus at least 2000 dollar budget.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Marine tanks under 20 - 30 gallons are very tricky to run. The small volume of water make it very easy for water parameters to go out of kilter and they need constant care and adjusting. For a beginner, almost always doomed to fail.<br>  <br>  For a 'starter' marine tank, use one of your 20 or 28gal tanksl. The Cichlids are going to need upgrades very soon. The Oscar to a 55gal as a minimum.<br>  <br>  Yes marine is more expensive and more technical as there are more water parameters that are vital to get right. But it's not terribly difficult if you get the correct setup.<br>  <br>  I suggest you get a good book on marine fish, and while you are reading it, save up for a bigger tank for the fish you have. Then you will be able to set up sensible size beginner marine tank with much better chance of success. And your Oscar will thank you by growing to full size and living much longer.<br>  <br>  Ian<br>  <br>  Edit. The Oscar doesn't have a year. It should be growing at close to 1" per month if it's healthy and well fed. It need to be out of the 20 gal by the time it's 6" long. Putting a JD and an Oscar in 55gal is likely to end badly as well.|`|mOayTJDmaa	I wouldn't start a salt water tank with less than 20 gallons.  And it seems to me that your Dempsey and Oscar are going to outgrow their tanks.|`|Qhdozm54aa	A ten gallon tank isn't impossible so long as you do plenty of research and plan it out well beforehand. If you look on several reefkeeping websites such as www.ultimatereef.net you will find hundreds of beginners setting up nano tanks and they are doing so with great success. <br>  <br>  With that said smaller bodies of water fluctuate much more rapidly in terms of chemistry than larger tanks. Marine organisms come from an environment that changes very little in terms of chemistry, this makes them somewhat sensitive to change. Because of this a good knowledge on how to keep the water parameters such as pH, salinity and temperature stable is very important.<br>  <br>  Marine fishkeeping can be expensive but there is no need for a '$500 lighting system' unless you intend to keep very demanding species such as SPS. There are several species of sessile invertebrates and corals available including mushrooms, ricordeas, star polyps and soft coral species like Sarcophyton, Xenia, Sinularia and Lobophyton, all of which are fairly undemanding in terms of light and calcium. There are also several other methods of filtration available aside from the standard berlin method, these rely on natural processes to deal with the fishes waste and are quite low-tech and inexpensive.

Talk to other breeders and get advice, and if you have good colors/specimens, they may even be interested in purchasing from you.  I suggest setting up a website, which is easily done, just go to a place like www.webs.com and stuff like that, it will teach you step by step.  Advertise everywhere on the internet, even here you can post in your signature like I do.  Just get the word out any time you can!  It may take a while, but people will be interested!

If you are scared to death of her, then she will take advantage of that and keep making you scared of her. You need to get tough minded and positive and tell yourself that you will not allow this behaviour. You need to assert positive, dominant body language.<br>  <br>  I have found during all of my horse internet searches a great site which has so many horse/people problems that include your ones as mentioned:<br>  <br>  For the mounting:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturalhorsetraining.com/TrainingTips142.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalhorsetraining.com/Trai...</a><br>  <br>  And for the bit problem:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturalhorsetraining.com/TrainingTips5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalhorsetraining.com/Trai...</a><br>  Although you may find she can do well in a bitless bridle too - maybe worth a try?<br>  <br>  I would also think that lungeing her would help in making a bond between the both of you, and it will assert your position in your relationship.|`|eXDDODfHaa	my horse has the same problem with the bit and she walks away when i try to get on her|`|JPa0GzDjaa	She might have a thing against women, for a start. I know several horses that seem to have preferences.<br>  <br>  It's only an idea but she may have been ridden with a bit-less bridal therefore she wouldn't be used to it.<br>  <br>  Another thing is, (don't take me the wrong way) if there are any particular weight differences between you and your dad. She could have a back problem.<br>  <br>  These are only wild guesses really but they are posibilities.
LAXxaxAZaa	Champagne horses are born with blue eyes and they turn green or amber as they age.<br>  <br>  A horse's eye shouldn't be black at all... are you sure it's not brown?<br>  <br>  A lot of horses with blue eyes can have specks or patches of brown in the blue. Is it possible you just didn't notice it before?|`|3d1XRIzkaa	I just looked up on the Internet. And No, horses eyes can not change colors.|`|N2jvxYPcaa	In general a horse's eye colour stays the same from birth to old age. There are a few exceptions to the rule, one being horses with the champagne gene. Those horses are normally born with blue eyes which slowly change to green and end up hazel.<br>  I am not aware of any horse with a wall eye that ends up with dark coloured eyes, so I imagine it would be worthwhile having this checked. Has your horse received any type of damage to his eye? Does his vision seem normal? Does he have eye discharge or tearing? Does he seem to have problems when in the dark or dim light? Has he become more spooky than usual? Does he keep the eye closed most of the time?<br>  If he seems to have none of the things I just mentioned happening you might just want to wait and see how it goes. But if he has eye discharge or any other signs of pain or trauma, I would have it examined. Pressure inside the eye can cause changes in colour, sometimes that will be only temperary if treated properly.|`|Fb5YtlkEaa	The only horse eye colors that change are Champagne which can change from yellow, blue, hazel, green, etc.<br>  <br>  This only happens during growth and once matured the eye color remains.<br>  <br>  If you horse is young and still see's exactly the same it was just him growing into it. Also don't mistake natural 'flecks' of black on colored eyes for a new area. <br>  <br>  If you horse seems to have a problem with his vision or is full grown I would call the vet and get him checked. Check his eye for any signs of an old injury or bruising that would damage his eye. Hold a light up to the eye and be sure its not cloudy in that area (there may be some clouding in the pupil, a grey to white reflection this is fine) if that area is cloudy something is wrong, but if it is clear, shows no signs of damage of vision loss I wouldn't waste the money on a vet call because that is pretty much what the vet would do anyway. Also, touch the eye (not the eye ball! just pet his eye) and if it is tender or shows signs of heat call the vet and get him there asap!<br>  <br>  puncture wounds are very difficult to spot especially if they are old. Since, if this is a puncture, it is NOT on the pupil recovery will be very easy for the horse. Pupil injuries require around the clock care and it takes months, so if it does turn out to be an injury thank your luck it wasn't on the pupil.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|nDkseOLCaa	if i was you i would ask your vet to just check this eye. how old is the horse? i used to have a coloured cob with two blue eyes they are lovely arnt they? it could be something simple like his age or a weaping pupil, sorry i cant give you any answers but i would just have the vet look at it, it cant hurt.|`|n7aBTKk0aa	Horses eyes don't change colors at least i don't think so. <br>  <br>  I am not a vet, you should have the horse checked out by a vet.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I know champagnes eyes change colors from blue to brown mostly
D75rqaihaa	that is a nice stallion mate...<br>  i love the pic of him with the foresty bit in the background...:P<br>  <br>  yes i do think he has what it takes...and more<br>  yes, yes and YES<br>  Lol<br>  <br>  look after him<br>  good luck<br>  x|`|tJRxQjdtaa	There are too many horses in this economy already. He is 8 and has no major accomplishments...<br>  <br>  His conformation is not awful but it is not amazing either. <br>  <br>  He has a clean throatlatch, but he possess a nest(chest to neck tie in), he has a nice shoulder, but a long back(not good for barrel racing), he has short, and slightly upright pasterns and tiny feet(navicular potential) His hind end is weak, and he looks slightly cow hocked. There's something about his hind end that I don't like.<br>  <br>  I would personally keep him in training, and geld him. There is no reason for people to be breeding horses these days unless they are top tens in their perspective fields. The world has an overpopulation problem with no one having the money to buy or take care of a horse these days.<br>  <br>  He's a nice gelding, not a nice stallion.|`|brVS3Pg0aa	Um, i can harldy tell hes a stallion, except from the obvious. He would be a nice backyard gelding, but look at him, he sort of insults the stallion population. he looks like a puppy dog, sure, cute for a gelding, but not a stallion. My mare, who i bought for 3k, has better conformation. I would have to say, these ppl are right, the best thing to do would be geld him. Idk who wants to breed to him, youd have to pay me to. i dont mean to sound rude, he is adorable, but just not stallion quality.|`|qw9ZjAlDaa	Don't ask what people think of your horse if you do not  want to hear the truth, and then get all pissy when they give you honest answers.  Seriously.  He is not stallion material.  He is a very average horse, nothing worth breeding.  Have you looked out there and seen what a top quality show stallion looks like and compared the photos to yours?<br>  <br>  P.S.  Thank you for putting more inferior horses out there just because you can't get past your own ego...it's just what the horse world needs right now.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	I think he is a nice horse, and people are looking at him thin. He would look alot different with a shinny summer coat and conditioned.<br>  <br>  Just a word of wisdom, you should NEVER show off pictures of a breeding stallion unless they look there BEST. It will ruin his reputation.    <br>  <br>  If you ask people to critic your horse you will hear all of it.  Just take into consideration what I said above.|`|e1a2b7e967effa31dda9b63713c82d26aa	you seem to have a lot of questions on this site about various horses of yours...and you have photos with your questions of them all....and to be honest...all the horses you own look very poor to me...underfed and kept in horrible conditions......i feel sorry for them.....and this stallion has awful legs especially hind legs.......definately not stallion material...GELD !!!|`|3LXbUg1raa	Someone needs to be calling the ASPCA on you, kid.  That horse, along with all of the other horses you've posted pictures of, look horrible...They are malnourished & underfed, dull & scraggly coats, poor foot care, and their conformation is absolutely atrocious.  <br>  <br>  Just this stallion's conformation alone there are so many things wrong with him one has to wonder where to even start.  His backend is HORRIBLE...he's severely sickle hocked, cow-hocked, and splay footed behind.  In front, he is over at the knee and looks as if he stands slightly underneath himself.  His shoulder angle has a bit to be desired there, and overall he is very heavy on the forehand.  His neck does not tie in nicely with his body, at all, and his throatlatch could be cleaner cut.  His head is, as I believe was stated above, a "block."  Hard to tell with the angles of the pictures that you took, but it also looks as if he is both base-narrow in front and bench-kneed.  And whoever has been trimming his feet needs to lay off on the heel a bit and let them grow out...it looks as though he hardly has much of a heel to even speak of.  <br>  <br>  ~Frankly, that stallion hardly makes for decent GELDING material, let alone stallion material.  I'm quite appalled that people such as yourself are even allowed to own horses, let alone breed them...horrible, horrible conditioned horses, the lot of them and all quite underfed & malnourished...judging by the care they've been receiving, I wouldn't be at all surprised if they were all wormy too and not kept UTD on shots either.  Terrible.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Sorry, I don't think he's stallion material.  His conformation isn't hideous but it's not great, either.  These photos aren't too good for judging conformation but just based upon what I can see, I don't think this fellow has any traits he needs to be passing on to future generations, especially considering his knees which look a bit scary to me.  He would make a very nice gelding. <br>  <br>  Why do you want to keep him intact, anyway?<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Ohhhhh no, little girl, you don't get to send me nasty e-mails and swear at me when I have gone out of my way to answer your question in a polite manner.  Maybe you'll understand me more if I speak to you in your own language (minus the swearing, of course).  Here goes:<br>  <br>  Your stud, as a stud, sucks.  His shoulder sucks, his knees most definetely suck, his big honkin' neck sucks, his coarse head and throatlatch suck, the fact that he looks super heavy on the forehand sucks, and you, my dear, suck for not loving him enough to do the best thing for him (i.e. geld him).<br>  <br>  As a gelding, he'd be cute and nice.  But as a stud, he sucks.|`|xzJi0bcSaa	Well, you asked what people thought, you do not post that if you dont want honest answers. I think the others are right, he should be gelded. Personality means a lot but there is a lot better looking stallions out there with fabulous personalities. I personally think he has too thick of a throatlatch, hes very heavy on his forehand, he has no muscle, hes too skinny, his topline does not match up to his underline, he has awful looking legs and personally, I would look elsewhere if I was planning on breeding. You should geld him, he does not have what it takes to be a barrel horse either, the power comes from the hind end and it looks like he has no muscle back there. His head is boxy with no definition and hes not really spectacular like you claim him to be. His head is also too big for his body.  And looks mean a heck of a lot more to me than breeding and hes just not a good looking horse. Im sure if you gelded him and worked a lot on getting him muscular, he would be ok as a barrel horse.|`|LzXZQBHbaa	I can't believe you are posting these horses on the internet..they are all in horrible condition! My goodness. I went and looked at your other horses. They are starving. In desperate need of being wormed and having their feet done. I bet you kids need help too. Horrible conditions.

All I see is woods and garbage around and barbed wire.|`|UcMCdlJSaa	his head and neck are a bit messed up his neck is U necked and his head looks kind of round, his legs look great from what i can tell and he has a nice butt and shoulder line, so i think hes pretty nice looking.|`|n7aBTKk0aa	He is skinny and looks lethargic for a stallion.|`|Z1ftrUJuaa	As said before, he is definitely NOT breeding quality, and to be honest, you'd be doing the horse world (and yourself) a favor by gelding him. There are too many horses without homes- good horses, with better pedigrees and far better conformations and training that are ending up in kill pens. His is also underweight, looks scrubby, and he has little to no good muscle definition. <br>  If I were looking at potential stallions, I wouldn't even give him a second glance, pedigrees are nice but if he doesn't show it, and hasn't performed, then I'm not interested. <br>  <br>  Look at these barrel stallions compared to yours<br>  <a href="http://barrelhorses.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogsection&id=14&Itemid=41" rel="nofollow">http://barrelhorses.com/index.php?option...</a><br>  <br>  there's no contest<br>  <br>  Please reconsider keeping him a stallion.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Do you mean Phenomenal? If that is what you mean, then his background does not include Go Man Go, King or Raise a Native|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Honestly, I think he needs to be gelded.  He should not be breeding, especially with the horse overpopulation problem.  <br>  <br>  Here's what I think of his conformation...<br>  -Good back and hip<br>  -Short neck and legs<br>  -A little over at the knee, this will cause stress on his tendons and could cause lameness<br>  -Boxy head<br>  -Good hooves<br>  -Very thick neck, might be just because he's a stallion but I still don't like it too much, too thick for even a stallion<br>  -He is underweight (you can see his ribs) and lacks muscle definition<br>  <br>  Honestly, if you got him gelded it would improve his chances at becoming a barrel horse.  Geldings are easier to manage and train.  This horse is definitely NOT stallion quality so he should be gelded asap, the world does not need any more horses without show records and with mediocre conformation.<br>  <br>  What's his registered name, do you have a link to his pedigree?<br>  <br>  EDIT-  OK, fine, you keep your mediocre stallion in tact, but don't come crying to me when half of his babies wind up on a Frenchman's sandwich you spoiled little brat.   Maybe you should learn a thing or two about conformation... you asked, I told you without being rude and the language in the message you send me was out of line.  Your horse's babies WILL DIE.  They will be shipped to slaughter in Canada where they will die horrible painful deaths because the horse market is terrible right now and nobody wants a horse with shoddy conformation.  Remember, half of his foals will be worse than him and he's not that great to begin with.<br>  <br>  37 reining points is NOT A LOT.  500 pleasure points is decent but nothing worth breeding to. <br>  <br>  There are too many horses in the world already.  I hope you're happy... not all of those babies will have good homes for the rest of their lives.  That horse should not be bred, why why why do you feel he needs to be kept a stud?|`|meoRbjgCaa	His basic conformation seems okay, however I do have a few questions/concerns.  Some of the other posts say he appear underweight.  I don't agree with this, but his weight is all in the wrong places and his stomach is distended like he has worms.  If he is in barrel racing training I would expect to see much more muscle definition (even after 1-2 weeks of training) in his butt and chest--yet he has none.  If you want to keep him a stud, that's fine however, I don't think he is one worth breeding all these mares you speak of to.  Also, would these mares happen to be enclosed  in barbed wire fences?  Who would bring their mares to a breeding facility with such dangerous enclosures?  His pen is questionable as it is, the wire fencing is notorious for getting feet caught in it and cutting into the leg.  (some have even lost all circulation and had to be put down as a result of those wire fences).  I know you are trying to make money, but nobody who really loves horses should be even breeding right now with so many other horses in need.  <br>  However, you don't really want to hear "what people think of " your stallion. Regardless of what anyone says you will acquire as many mares as you can, breed them all to him and then attempt to sell the offspring.  This will help you "get back" at  all those who said he should be gelded.  But then sadly  the offspring won't sell or will go to mediocre owners for pennies and will most likely end up at auction lots.  This will happen because I doubt (due to the current care of the horses and facilities in your pictures) that you have the tens of thousands of dollars it takes to properly promote offspring in order to sell it for substantial prices.  I know this because I have a family member who is exactly the same way.  It is sad, but it continues to go on.  So go ahead and live your fantasy that your horse will make you tons of money at the suffering of the offspring's expense.  Because that's what horse lovers do.<br>  I'm sure he could be a barrel horse|`|RloOJ43haa	I don't see anything that says 'stallion prospect' to me. <br>  <br>  Attitude is only one aspect of deciding if a horse is a stallion prospect. Show success is one aspect. Conformation is another. <br>  <br>  By the way - if you want to showcase you stallion and show people how great he is, clean him up and take some decent photographs with decent lighting and backgrounds that don't distract, with the horse posed. Having a nylon halter on while in the pasture on a horse whose ribs are showing does not speak well for your horse management.<br>  <br>  EDIT - WELL DONE, ROSIE!|`|sbB0TpGXaa	Just Google it is correct.  His conformation leaves far too much to be desired.  Show records are not the end all and be all of determining whether a horse is stallion material.  However I seriously doubt he has enough show points to sneeze at in anything more than local shows.  In fact I suspect the only shows he has won in are shows in which the judges knew the owners and or trainers.|`|XL62syrCaa	He looks like a decent horse. A little ribby maybe. <br>  <br>  Those photos are hard to get a REALLY good idea of his conformation but from what I saw he looks like he would be a good barrel horse<br>  <br>  He has:<br>  Strong Hindquarters<br>  Built a little uphill<br>  Stong thick legs<br>  Strong chest<br>  <br>  <br>  He could stand to gain a little weight and I would love to see him once he is shed out and shinny!|`|B6zl0AJDaa	JOS Little Warrior:  #4152213, Sorrel, Stallion, 4/21/2001.<br>  <br>  When asked for his show record AQHA said:  "The horse does not have the record selected."<br>  <br>  The bottom line kid is according to AQHA "Jos Little Warrior has not Sired Foals. <br>  Additional Information for Jos Little Warrior: Genotype on file with AQHA as a result of either being blood-typed or DNA tested.

DtkLsetkaa	Oooohhh soo much wrong with this... where do i begin...<br>  <br>  First off, pet stores are bad.  100% of the time bad.  They get their "stock" from puppy and kitten mills, and the animals are in poor shape, poorly bred, and sickly.  They also rarely have any sort of a health safety guarantee.  Many people on this site have learned the hard way about pet store cats when they post about how incredibly sick their cat is, how much they have to spend now on vet bills, and how frustrated they are that the pet store won't give them a refund.  DO NOT buy from a pet store, period, the end.<br>  <br>  Second, Bengals should only be gotten from a REPUTABLE breeder who offers a guarantee on the health of the animal and will offer to take the pet back if your life situation changes and you can no longer keep it.  Any other breeder is a backyard breeder, and sometimes its difficult to tell the difference.  Also, be prepared to spend several thousand dollars on your cat, if its from a good breeder.  Otherwise, if you buy from a backyard breeder, see my first point on just how "healthy" your cat is going to be.<br>  <br>  Third, there are SO many cats in shelters that need adoption, have you considered that?  A shelter cat has a certain "appreciation" for whoever rescues them, and will love you so much for it.  Just something else to consider.|`|iuYtcX6Xaa	never buy from a pet store, and are you sure you can even have a bengal in san antonio?|`|YxJzudKyaa	Yes you can have a Bengal in San Antonio.  When we buy our cats as breeders, one of the conditions we agree to is not to sell them to pet stores.  I happen to know of a reputable breeder in the Austin/San Antonio area you can purchase one from.  Go to www.UniquePrintsCattery.com.  She has some very nice kittens to choose from.  Tell her Noahs Clarks Cats  sent you.
M3pjhIecaa	As a project they're a worthwhile fish to breed however, economically its not the water parameters need to be 6-6.5 Ph very soft water kh 0 or as near as you can get, you need to provide a mop or straggly object for the eggs to drop into as the fish will eat them as quickly as they drop. The fish need to be conditioned before hand with plenty of live food temp 82-86. <br>  This is from personal experience, you will find some stating lower Ph's but I found the lower the Ph the more problems I had with raising the fry. The fry were fed on infrusia once they became free swimming and after about a month newly hatched brine shrimp. <br>  Its possible to see them breed in a community tank however, the chances of survival are zero.|`|tShDXmgbaa	They are not the easiest fish to breed and require some really good breeding setup and even then the fry is soo delicate they prolly wouldn't survive without some extensive care from you.  You are better off going with some other type of fish much easier to breed.

Consistancy is the key.|`|GSf09ALBaa	I hate pee pads.  This is a great example of how annoying they can be.<br>  <br>  You are going to have to start all over by training your Chis to go OUTSIDE to pee and poop.  This has just started becoming a game to them.  If you don't want to teach them to go outside then I suggest the doggie litter box thing.  Some people find that works better for the smaller breeds who are not easy to housebreak.<br>  <br>  Hitting and rubbing their noses in it does nothing but confuse the dog and frustrate the heck out of you.<br>  <br>  <br>  ADD:  THE THUMBS DOWN FAIRIES WERE BUSY ON THIS ONE SO I GAVE EVERYBODY A THUMBS UP.|`|prW1i0vzaa	Take them outside to go to the restroom.|`|wUg7iYU1aa	What do you expect?

I would suggest hitting them on their noses but not too hard because they might end up retaliating and trying to bite you. But do this every time they try to eat their feces or play with the pads. But if this doesn't work, then try training them to use the out doors.|`|xp7UNlaqaa	If you tried all the easy optional ways, then you should consult a dog trainig to help you.

Get them BOTH fixed asap. <br>  <br>  Not only could the dog hurt the cat with it's biting but its completly possible for the dog to physically harm the cat internally during intercourse and this should not be allowed. <br>  <br>  Please get both of them fixed asap to stop this behavior before it becomes a habitor a death sentance for the cat.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	I would be very concerned that he might sit on her or bite her too hard. I think a trip to the Vets will help solve both problems.|`|MU4EOe3oaa	Well, you can let them work it out, but if you are uncomfortable with it, just separate them. Also, they both should really be fixed.|`|lTjCxCgGaa	you really should ask the vet about this (have them fixed). You might just want to separate them.|`|0ROOS2G0aa	The dog is old enough to be neutered. The kitten should also be spayed - waiting too much longer for her spaying will make the surgery more difficult for the vet.  Cats go into heat "at will", and spaying while in heat is also more difficult for the vet, as the tissues are swollen.<br>  <br>  The puppy is way too big to playing this way, and if you don't discourage it NOW, he will accept it as a normal behavior, and continue in this "playful" manner with other dogs, cats, people's legs, furniture, etc.  A real conversation stopper at home, and slightly dangerous to allow in parks, streets, etc.<br>  <br>  Stop the behavior, and make some appointments at the vets.

But I do agree with the other answers given regarding the size of your tank, type of fish, and the filter system would also be helpful.|`|0rAgtGNgaa	make sure you are adding start right to your tank if you have city/community water.

They are pretty much out of it the first day and night.  Your daughter should leave the dog alone until the next day.<br>  <br>  Most dogs are feeling much better the second day.  You just need to keep her fairly quiet, keep an eye on the stitches, and make sure your dog does not bite at them. (If she does, you can put a cone on her to prevent it.)  <br>  <br>  The stitches come out around ten days.|`|gYLkvAnjaa	You neuter male dogs and spay female dogs.  5 months old is a good time.  Don't have the surgery done when the dog is in heat.  Blood loss is a big risk when they're in heat.  The dog will need to be kept quiet for at least 3-5 days after surgery so she won't pop her stitches and bleed out.  If you don't have a kennel to keep her seperated from your daughter, then talk to your vet about boarding her until the stitches are ready to be removed.|`|NBeQyTlMaa	Your dog is going to feel terrible after the surgery.

I then put out some food and water, and some treats, like bread and leftover food from dinner etc. So maybe you should do this with yours. If it is a tame dove, hold it in your hand and if you can feel it's breast bone really sticking out he is very thin. Check for a full crop-maybe your dove's eating, but not in the presence of you. check the poop,is it runnier, dryer, smaller, than normal. Basically do a check of your dove all over, and pick out physical changes. Other than this, you will have to go to the vet. Ask your  friend, mum ,dad, anyone who can lend a bit of money. The vet isn't that expensive- and think that it is for the good health of your animal. Sometimes we as owners must go far to help our animals, but it's worth it to see them lively and back to normal again.

Wait just a few seconds and take him back out. As soon as he mouths you again, repeat. Do this daily and consistently, and you will be successful, as he learns that you don't tolerate the mouthing.<br>   <br>  Anyone living with him should do the same.

During teething (generally starting around four months), the urge to mouth is extra powerful because it feels good on your pups' tender gums. Lacking opposable thumbs, puppies also use their mouths to catch, carry, and play, making it all the more crucial that they learn how to control themselves in the presence of human skin.<br>  <br>  Here;s how to stop your pit bull form biting <a href="http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=520064391483446370806741346675" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=520064391483...</a>|`|1XLZdOcQaa	You may want to try giving him some chew toys.

That dog should still be with his mom and litter mates.  You should have known that before you got the dog.  Puppies are going to nibble and bite.|`|AA11244754	you can't because since he's only a baby he is teething, what you need to do is get him some good dog teething and chew toys and redirect his biting.|`|987475b0db71996a7db0e2e10c1d960eaa	He believes that biting is play time and that you're playing with him. To counteract this belief the instant he bites you too hard say "NO!" or "Ouch!" and turn away from him and refuse to play with him until he either goes away and chews one of his toys or you can hear that he has calmed down. He will soon realize that if he bites you the fun stops. My puppy does this too. <br>  <br>  Flipping him onto his back should be used as a last result. The difference between turning away from him and flipping him onto his back is training and aggression control. When you turn away from him you're training him to not bite because it's a bad habit. When you flip him onto his back you are controlling his thoughts that he is the dominant pack leader and changing them into the fact that you are the leader.<br>  <br>  Five weeks old is too young to take him away from his mother also. He is in a sort of teething state.

You can also teach him to bite on it instead of your hand.We have 4 rescued Pits, 3 were raised since pups and they they all did the same thing.So just give the pup some time,and yourself.Good Luck.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Holding his mouth shut only makes him bite at you the second you let go; that is a bad method.  The truth is you just need to wait this phase out as he will grow out of the biting phase.  Puppies mouth things to learn about them (they can't use their paws to examine things like humans).  Give him plenty of chew toys and do your best to keep your skin away from his mouth.|`|sgEazAn2aa	I remember that time. Wow im glad my dog is over that. We did all those ticks to.

B6zl0AJDaa	There are NO best breeds for jumping.  It depends upon each horse's skill.<br>  <br>  I've known horses, like the appy that Jimmy Williams repeatedly won jumper stakes on in the 1960's to the little TB mare, Touch Of Class in the 1980's who both loved to jump.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Yes, DWB's tend to be fantastic.  I really like thoroughbreds too though, mainly because they are usually fairly cheap off-track and I love the energy they have.  Most horses can be decent jumpers, but Arabians make terrible jumpers usually.<br>  <br>  Edit- Note the word "usually"?  Yes, Arabians usually make HORRIBLE jumpers.  Their conformation is not at all suited to jumping and they do an awkward little bunny hop over the jump.  Arabians are, in general, the worst jumpers there are.  Their style is usually downright dangerous and always unstylish.  If you'd care to prove me wrong, go ahead... show me some full-bred Arabs who are comfortably jumping 5 feet plus?  You won't find any.  I don't think Arabians are bad horses and I like them in general, but I'd never jump on one... just like you'd never ask a pure TB to do barrels or try to get a welsh pony to win a race.  Different breeds have different strengths and the Arabian's strength is endurance... not jumping!|`|qdtU1Q1Laa	It depends on what level of jumping your talking about. <br>  <br>  Thoroughbreds are usually great jumpers. Zangersheides, Holsteiners, Selle Fran?ais, etc. also make good upper level jumpers.|`|JFuVm9k5aa	i like oldenburgs. i will only buy german warm bloods though because the american warm bloods tend to be heavier and i like the way the imported ones are put together. <br>  <br>  <br>  hanos', Oldenburg's, DWB's, Swedish WB's. Brandenburg's, Holsteins, etc. are all very nice jumpers but i have had all of those and of them my Oldenburg's have been the most successful, least injury prone and seem to have the best minds for it and build for it. <br>  <br>  just about anything with the right mind set and training can be a good jumper. my roping/team penning/cutting/reining QH turned hunter/jumper/eq/dressage/eventer is one of the best jumpers i have seen. he;'s been jumped up to 4'9 and i was just as successful with him as many people have been with 6 figure imported WB's.<br>  <br>  <br>  TB's are also a good choice because of their athleticism and if they can come sound off the track they can usually handle a demanding job. getting a sound minded TB is worth its weight in gold if you ask me. unfortunately i have only gotten one good one...but that's just my luck! i have had 3 and 1 went lame and the other just didn't have the mind for it,<br>  <br>  <br>  anyway, w/e horse you buy should be fine with proper training and if it has the heart to do it :)|`|RloOJ43haa	According to the World Federation for Sport Horse Breeding, the Dutch Warmbloods are the top jumping studbook. However, many breeds and individual horses are good at jumping.<br>  <br>  EDIT - To Pointmissed - Some Arabians are wonderful jumpers. Maybe that was the point that you missed.|`|H2gwQac6aa	yeahh i heard that dutch warmbloods and thoroughbreds tend to be brilliant jumpers, i have a thoroughbred thats 6 and he  needs to be trained to jump but i think he will come along well at it. its also quite reasuring to know they are good jumpers haha|`|2AOzkBPJaa	i think most any of the warmbloods, and TB's make great jumpers...<br>  <br>  To the person who said you wouldn't ask a TB to run barrels, why not? it's a speed event, speed is what they are bred for... I know many TB barrel horses, and my own TB could definitly do it, and do it well.<br>  <br>  Also, just because Arabians strength is endurance doesn't mean they can't jump.  My TB mare's strength is hunters, but we can also go in a western pleasure class and WIN. Just because the breed isn't known for it doesn't mean there aren't any out there that are good at it.|`|mUNJEh8baa	Yes, they are great jumpers. So are Danish Warmbloods, TBs, and Irish Sport Horses. And to the person that said Arabians are terrible jumpers, thats actually not true. They can be great jumpers. Maybe you should research things a little more before you say them.<br>  <br>  =EDIT= yes Greg B is right! I think that would be the point you missed. There are exeptions to every breed. I have known several TB's and warmbloods both that couldn't jump at all. And yes, i know a Purebred Arabian that can jump five feet AND does 100 milers in endurance. I also know Arabians that can't jump and TB's and Warmbloods that are amazing jumpers. So yeah, there are exeptions to every breed. And how do you know that Arabians "bunny hop" over jumps if you would never jump one?  they actually don't. Arabians are incredibly graceful and well put together, their jumps are very smooth.|`|penuzN8jaa	There is no one best breed for jumping. The top jumpers are all different breeds, from Hanoverians, Oldenburgs, Holsteiners, Irish Sport horses, Selle Francais, and Warmbloods of different backgrounds. Even a stray Thoroughbred makes it's way in there and crosses. <br>  x|`|hGGf68GQaa	I think warmbloods and thoroughbreds are probably the best.

OyNJTWaiaa	Your main issue here is you have one male...two hens, And a  NESTING BOX IN A CAGE. ....bad bad combination.<br>  It is most common in "colony breeding" situationd fot the hen who hasnt got a nestbox to decide she want the nestbox the other hen has. <br>  If you wanted to breed these birds then you certainly dont put ONE nestbox in a  cage with a pair of budgies and leave the spare hen in there. <br>  What has just happened is normal practice for hens in these situations. You shopuld think yourself LUCKY that it was only eggs that got damaged as often the spare hen will kill chicks in a nestbox to take it as her own. <br>  Remove a spare hen to another cage if you want to proceeed breeding with your budgies.<br>  The brown part wearing off means the hen concerned is losing her breeding condition anyway and should no longer be breeding. You will have to wait until anothyer time. A lot of people wait until the cere is brown and crusty to add the nestbox thinking its the right time but at that point it too late. Its when the cere is beige to light brown that you add the nestbox. Hope this helps.|`|pYF9KnNeaa	The root of your problem is that you have an uneven number in one cage.  That can work, once in a while, but usually only in the short term.  When you have at least one of each gender and when you start adding mating and eggs, then the serious trouble starts.  Unless you have had eggs hatch in the past, you may not even have a male bird in the mix.  You could have 3 girls fighting over the eggs.  They may not have been laid by the same bird even, leading to more complications.  If you don't know how to tell for sure, you go by the color of the cere.  That's the area just above the beak where the nostrils are located.  It's blue on the males.  It can be pink, tan, off white or anything but blue on the females.  If you mean it's the cere that's wearing off on one of them, the other bird may have injured it or you may have a separate health issue going on.  Only a good Avian vet can tell you that.  But for your immediate problem, you are going to have to separate one of them from the other two.  The first step is to determine gender positively.  If you are correct, then you need to leave the male with the female who layed the eggs and get the other one into a separate cage.  If you are not positive, then which ever one is being the aggressor needs to be separated.  Then observe closely for several days to make sure the fighting has stopped.  But you can't delay.  Sweet as they look, Budgies can be vicious little critters to each other when properly provoked and you could easily lose one of more of them to injuries and blood loss.  Good luck with them.|`|cn0ALwwLaa	Either the male or the other femals is starting to go bananas. Happened with a male yello parakeet I had. He was a jelous Son of a *****. His punishment was to go in the other cage and get pecked non-stop, like he liked.<br>  <br>  Right after the egg hatched, he went down and put the baby bird in the poop pan. He was pecked at ever since. He liked that. Bad Bird.<br>  <br>  It may be the female or the male. Amazingly enough, just before that egg, our female bird had liek 4 eggs laid before that too. Nothing in them, it seemed.<br>  <br>  You need to separate the birds, and see if it continues. Better to have the two females at first, then the male<br>  <br>  Parakeets fight well. I remember those birds.<br>  <br>  That bird then turned into the best momma bird, and it was in the cage with just her and her little baby. Needs to be like that. You dont want the momma to pretend it doesnt exist.<br>  <br>  At least they are nt hansters. Their behaviors are cannibalistic.
H06PtiIAaa	you need to have it elevated above the tank,<br>  <br>  Metal halide produces alot of heat which can cause the unit to possibly catch on fire or produce alot of heat into the aquarium. They have wall mounts, clips and suspension fixtures for metal halide so they dont get too hot.<br>  <br>  Also a chiller might be needed for your aquarium to keep the temperature cool enough with the metal halide.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	if they are only an inch or so above the water you are going to blech anything you put in the tank, especially if it's a higher wattage lamp<br>  <br>  they get HOT.. the ballasts too|`|M3pjhIecaa	they produce a lot of heat so its advisable to have more space between the tank and the lights, saying that you need to keep it so as when you're sitting and glance at the tank you don't get the full glare from the lights as continued it can cause damage. You would need to fit extraction fans to remove the heat if your going to fit them ontop of the tank.
8owlj2xHaa	if you mean the glass lids, no you can not use them. The lids will trap the heat given off by the bulb causing the temperature to rise to fast. <br>  You can not use the housing either, they are not vented enough. You also need good reflectors for a metal halide bulb and they would not fit in the housing either. <br>  <br>  Chillers with metal halides are a wives tale.  You can use fans blowing on the water surface which helps increase evaporation. I use 3  250 wat metal halides with no chiller and my temp never goes over 81 F.|`|H06PtiIAaa	not sure what you mean.<br>  <br>  Metal halide bulbs either single or double ended cant fit into regular fluorescent arrangments.<br>  <br>  You will need to buy a metal halide fixture. <br>  <br>  As fars as open, you dont have to, but you need to keep the metal halide bulb fixutre off the tank. And it should have extra vents or be suspended over the tank, <br>  <br>  Metal halide produces ALOT of heat and can catch on fire if too hot or placed ontop of the aquarium, so you might also need to buy a chiller unit to keep the aquarium at a stable temperature.

They are amazing animals, and all though I feel your passion for animals especially small rodents, I would suggest you take care of the doggies. <br>  <br>  If you don't want to take that option, I have another idea. Why don't you get another hamster? If she sees that you take care of that animal too, I mean if you did in the first place in her eyes, she might consider letting you get a bigger pet like a guinea pig. They get really really big. Mine was almost bigger and longer than my chihuahua, so that's something you have to consider. Its not going to want to be in its cage like a hamster, and demands so much more attention than a hamster. You have to always clean the cage, and not to mention you need -TWO- of them, not one like a hamster. They are harder to tame by themselves, and won't feel the same without any other piggies around. With two huge animals in a cage, that will be a lot of food, time, and money. Vet bills won't be cheap either, and with a lot of things that can go wrong with guinea pigs, you better be ready to fork out $70 or more for one vet visit if anything goes wrong. I would seriously consider your options. Read about guinea pigs, who said that you need one so desperately? It sounds like you loved your hamster just fine.<br>  <br>  Guinea pigs will set you back atleast $200 alone, cage and guinea pigs, not including vet bills and any other misc. funds.  Anyways, I don't want to talk you out of it, they're fine animals but I find rats to be more intellegent, friendlier, and more amazing in many ways. I would recommend reading a lot more about guinea pigs before you even consider. Good luck with everything about guinea's.

His only inclination is to get the object, he can't know how long his chain is.   If you're going to play some game where he chases something, it has to be inside a secure fenced area with no chain on him.  If you keep playing frisbee with him on a chain, you're going to end up hurting him.  You especially can't put a dog on a chain with a choke collar.|`|XtDEUKVsaa	He's not used to the chain or a leash. Dogs have to learn their limits.

You might just need a obedience class or trainer for yourself and this pup.  You sound like this is all new to you.  A little time and money now will insure you end up with a great dog for life.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Shrimp are actually MORE sensitive to water chemistry problems than fish, a mature filter is ESSENTIAL for a healthy shrimp tank.<br>  <br>  My shrimp tank was running 3 years before I turned it shrimp only. In an unfiltered tank the chemistry in the water will fluctuate and you'll lose the shrimp.<br>  <br>  There are dozens upon dozens of species of Shrimp out there, from tiny ghost shrimp to monster predatory long-arm shrimp. Do some background reading on these critters, they're more complex than you think!<br>  <br>  I have Amano Shrimp and Crystal Red Shrimp - the CRS die at the drop of a hat if you're not careful. And I lost a Bamboo Shrimp when it shed in the filter casing and I didn't notice until after I'd done a water change, Shrimp are at their most delicate post-shed.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	You will have much more success if you have a filtered tank. Shrimp can be very sensitive to water conditions, and filters help keep the water free of ammonia buildup.<br>  <br>  But a few shrimp put a relatively small bio-load on the tank system, so you dont need a fancy filter system. An cheap air pump connected to an undergravel, sponge or box filter will be OK for a small tank with just a few shrimp. In a heavily stocked tank with bigger fish they aren't really up to the job, but for a small tank they will do fine.<br>  <br>  Most shrimp will need a heater as well.<br>  <br>  Ian|`|zqVDJxUIaa	Yes, shrimp, like all aquatic aquarium species, will require a filter. Shrimp can be quite picky on water conditions, and will die if you don't have a filter. ALL FISH, SHRIMP, other beings need a filter. If you're planning on getting just 2 shrimp, a small and inexpensive aquarium (5 gal) will do. It can house some fish, too.<br>  You MUST get a filter, such as the Penguin Bio-wheel if you want to keep any aquatic species. The Bio-wheel is a reliable and excellent filter, and provides room for beneficial bacteria to grow on (removing toxins, etc.) They only cost around $20 for a smaller model.<br>  Bio-Wheel by Marineland:<br>  <a href="http://www.arcatapet.com/item.cfm?cat=9856" rel="nofollow">http://www.arcatapet.com/item.cfm?cat=98...</a><br>  So, the whole setup for the shrimp would be quite inexpensive, under $100, of course!<br>  <br>  5 gallon tank with lighting: $25-30<br>  Bio-Wheel Filter: $20<br>  Gravel and plants (optional): $10<br>  Heater: $10<br>  Shrimp:$5+<br>  <br>  The whole setup would cost from 50-75 dollars, at most. Plus, if you get the setup listed above, you can even add about 3-4 fish, since shrimp don't produce much waste (waste creates toxic ammonia), and your tank would not be overstocked.<br>  Keeping fish (and shrimp, in this case) is not too expensive as one would think.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that you get Ghost Shrimp, they are fun to watch, because they are transparent, and you can actually see the food traveling through their bodies!<br>  Ghost Shrimp:<br>  <a href="http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/inv/ghostshrimp.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/inv/ghos...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck, and happy shrimpkeeping!|`|1D8tMCYIaa	Guess what, don't be a fool and a murderer.

JiCKFTuIaa	An old man stood right behind me day after day making sure that I would never forget the experience of learning how to train and handle a dog.

LPEO6AsCaa	Golden do come in several coat colors.  From very dark like a Irish setter to the now popular term "White".<br>  <br>  Please keep in mind that this term is used by some breeders to try to trick or fool people into thinking they are purchasing something rare and unique.  This is just not so.<br>  <br>  Since the importation of Golden's from over seas, including England (cream), Poland (snow)Russia(white), Sweden (nordic) ect.  The coat color for a  select few Golden's has in some cases become very light. <br>  What does this mean???<br>  Nothing!  It is just coat color and nothing more.  They are still all Golden Retrievers and here in the USA they are registered as such with AKC and I know in Canada also with CKC (the legit one).<br>  <br>  Anyone advertising their Golden's as rare or special or any other buzz word just because of coat color, well IMO is duping you. <br>  <br>  Coat color is nothing more than your personal preference.  Please keep that in mind when looking for a Golden.<br>  Oh and price is not that outrageous if the dogs lines are sound and also health tested and documented as clear from all the major defects that can aflict Golden's!|`|PM23RDycaa	Breeder referrals from the breed club<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.grca.org/allabout/puppyreferrals.html#INDIANA" rel="nofollow">http://www.grca.org/allabout/puppyreferr...</a> <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.grca.org/allabout/puppyreferrals.html#ILLINOIS" rel="nofollow">http://www.grca.org/allabout/puppyreferr...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  GRCA Puppy Referral<br>  <br>  Buying a Golden Retriever is a lifelong commitment and not an impulse decision.

lDXh0jRVaa	Yes, it's normal. It is called either a hemotoma or a seroma depending on what is exactly in the liquid. <br>  A hemotoma is caused by too much activity during the healing time. If it does not reabsorb into the body soon you may have to have it drained. <br>  <br>  A seroma is caused often when the vet uses two layers of stitches. They rub against each other and the liquid forms to prevent the friction and to aid in healing. <br>  <br>  Usually these will reabsorb into the body easily and should be gone in a week or so. If it does not you'll need to have them drained. To help, you can put a warm pack on the sight a few times a day. <br>  Good luck! Call your vet if you're worried.|`|LURQBU86aa	It's most likely a fluid filled bump called a seroma. Some dogs and cats form these in reaction to the sutures used.

ckqmNmnOaa	I had the same problem with my little pup. He would bite everything & anything. If we ignored him he would constantly scratch us & bite us. A little trick I learned from the vet; every time he wants to bite something I would take my hand and hold his mouth shut and say no a few times. My thumb would go below his chin and my other fingers go his nose. Hold it there not too hard & not too light but make sure he understands that you don't like him biting what he's not supposed to.  <br>  <br>  But puppies are naturally curious and it's normal for them to nip and bite but when those adult teethes kick in, it'll hurt. Buy him lots of toys to keep him entertained ! It'll only get worse when he starts teething around 5 months or so. Good luck !|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Puppies play rough. Your physical corrections are nothing but play to him, so naturally he "plays" right back with more nipping. You're just exciting him.<br>  <br>  Every single time his teeth touch skin, make a sharp yelping sound. Immediately stand up and storm out of the room. This must be done instantly and consistently. If you don't react precisely when he is nipping, he won't understand why you're reacting. If you aren't consistent, he won't pick it up. Dogs thrive on consistency. Anyway, remove yourself from the puppy for several minutes. You may then return quietly to the room. Greet the puppy to let him know that you aren't still upset, but do not invite him to play for awhile. You're still "wounded."<br>  <br>  You're trying to mimic a litter mate; if he nipped another puppy, it would yelp and refuse to play anymore. This is how the puppy would learn not to nip. Every time he bites, playtime ends because his playmate is wounded and leaves. This is canine communication.<br>  <br>  A handy article on the subject:<br>  <a href="http://www.jersey.net/~mountaindog/berner1/bitestop.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jersey.net/~mountaindog/berne...</a>|`|SK4qj3ZEaa	Watch the dog whisper.

Get him something tasty to chew on from your local pest store. If he continues nipping you its most likely in a playful manner. When my pup did this, I would simply pull my hands away and stop playing and ignore him for a minute or two, until he settled down and then start playing again. It may take repetition but he will eventually realize that nipping means play time stops.|`|6z9bNeZ2aa	Puppies are gonna bite. Get a toy that he is allowed to chew up.

Before removing, make sure the incision is well-healed & shows no signs of infection. Wash your hands & clean a little pair of scissors & a pair of tweezers in alcohol. Cut the sutures on one side of the knot & pull the knot, pulling the entire stitch through & out of the skin. After they are out, Clean the incision line with some soap & water & smear a little neosporin or bacitracin on. Still don't allow the dog to lick or bite at the incision obsessively & continue to monitor for signs of infection. No biggie.|`|Um8osMNuaa	lt's not just to take the stitches out why you need to go back, the vet will also check that she has healed correctly. lt can be tricky taking the stitches out, if you nick her skin then you could cause an infection, which would mean a trip to the vets for antibiotics.|`|L22hVXTIaa	I'm surprise your vet didn't use the dissolving type of sutures since that's seems to be favored now.  But, it isn't that difficult to remove stitches IF (and that's a big IF) you know what you're doing.  <br>  <br>  I have removed stitches many, many times.  First, I generally put a very small amount of neosporin on the area.  This really softens the stitches and will usually prevent them from adhering to the skin when you pull them out.  Then, use a very small pair or scissors - even the type you cut your cuticles with will work.  I always like to use magnifying glasses since it really helps to see the stitch - then just cut it being careful not to get any skin and gently pull it out.<br>  <br>  It's not a difficult procedure at all.  Just be careful and watch what you're doing.|`|lDXh0jRVaa	Honestly, as long as you KNOW your dog will stay still there is no real risk to taking them out yourself. You need to be careful, however, not to clip her skin. All you do is cut then gently pull them out. <br>  Since you can take them out now, gently pull up on the stitch, if you have a good amount of room to slip in a pair of scissors then go for it. If you don't, then DO NOT try to. Some vets make very close sutures and it is practically impossible for you to do it yourself. You'll just end up making things worse and hurting her. <br>  Before you attempt to cut them out look close. Is there any discharge at all? Does the wound look healed? If there is discharge, foul smell, or redness at the sight you need to go back to the vet as it could be infected. If it looks good (you'll know if it looks good) then you can safely remove them yourself. <br>  Only do it if you feel comfortable and if you don't...is there another vet in the area you could visit?

VdeV0jUqaa	Cockatoos need a lot of attention- they need about six hours a day outside of their cage and interacting with their family.<br>  Depending on where you live they can be very expensive to buy, as well.<br>  They need a tonne of toys, and because they are large birds they will cost a bit more and probably need to be replaced more often- as those big beaks are very good at chewing up their toys!<br>  'Toos are very intelligent, and make loving, affectionate companions for the right owners- but you get out what you put in to them.

He still has years left of high school, and then there is University. <br>  Cockatoos can be very noisy- they are one of the loudest parrots- and they can develop behaviour problems... and noise problems very easily if they are not well cared for. If your son is planning on going to uni, sharing a house, etc in his future his pet may become a problem.<br>  There are some smaller birds out there that make better first time pets- depending on what you are looking for in a bird.<br>  Budgies are a good first time parrot, Cockatiels are a little more work- but they are a member of the cockatoo family and they do have the classic cockatoo crest- they are still noisy but a much more appropriate pet for a young boy.<br>  Good luck!|`|v6coHbIeaa	NO|`|HQsmRzPsaa	no! and 13 year old is not responsible enough nor will he have enough time as this type of bird requires. start him off with a cockatiel! cockatoos are not a good starter bird!<br>  <br>  he may be into it at first but after a few months or even years you will be the one taking care of it alllllll of the time. you have your son for at least 5 more years and the cockatoo will live about 60-100 years! do you really want to make that kind of commitment?|`|1tOr2qLAaa	I think starting off with a cockatiel is a better idea. See how he takes care of a cockatiel and if he stays interested, in a few years then if he wants one then you can think about it. Birds take a lot of care, they need to be fed, the right diet veggies fruit seed and pellets. Cages needs to be kept clean and water changed.  Cockatoos can have one mean bite, from the way their beak is shaped, a bite from a cockatiel is by far more tolerable. He is already headed for being a teenager and he may decide he is interested in other things.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	No.<br>  They are VERY high maintenance birds. They require alot of attention. No, they DEMAND alot of attention.. We aren't talking about a hamster here, this is the most neurotic of parrots that even many adults cannot handle. They can be ear piercingly loud, and are prone to plucking if they emotional needs are not met. They can also live for 60+ years. That also means they will want to stay put for the next 60+ years. Planning on having your sone live with you a while, say...60 years? or are you just going to take care of the bird when your son goes off to school?<br>  I don't think you have really thought this through.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	I think that they are really good pets I have one my self but I would make sure that he has been messed with a lot cause they do bite if they aren't messed with but yea I think that it will make a good pet for him as long as he treats it ok.|`|3YHZUuhyaa	I wouldn't recommend you getting a cockatoo for a 13 year old boy. They're a lot of work! Why not get him a smaller bird? like a parakeet, lovebird, or cockatiel?<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|MFgT6fg2aa	While cockatoos are very sweet cuddly birds, they are very emotiional. Look at it this way: cockatoos are like two year olds, they are very needy for human attention. Basically, any time your son is at home the bird should be out. They NEED at least 4 hours of affection time every day not including the maintenance and care to stay emotionally healthy. A cockatoo is a HUGE responsibility and is not a recommended pet to children or teens.   To put into simpler words, it would be exactly like caring for a two year old for 80 years. (that's how long they can live!)<br>  <br>  If you are going to consider getting a pet bird for your son, I would HIGHLY recommend something a little more low maintenance. Maybe a parakeet or a cockatiel. I've had both and they are also excellent pets but don't require as much care.<br>  <br>  Please think about and be discretionary.<br>  <br>  Thank you<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	A cockatoo is very demanding , high maintenance bird. They are not recommended for inexperienced bird owners.  You might start out with a handfed ,well socialized conure from a breeder. if he takes good care of it and trains it well then you can consider another bird.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Cockatoos are loud and high-maintenance birds.  If your son is mature, it might be okay.  If he's not, don't get a cockatoo.  They can develop behavioral problems and they are much like little kids. <br>  <br>  I'd suggest a cockatiel instead.  Cockatiels are much easier to take care of and they can learn to whistle, talk, and imitate sounds.  They are usually friendly and much fun.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Here are some links to help you decide:<br>  <a href="http://www.avianweb.com/cockatooinfo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.avianweb.com/cockatooinfo.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/birds/a/cockatiels.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/birds/a/c...</a>|`|9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	You should get one only if you are going to help and if you live in a house not an apartment and if you have a lot of time and resources including money for a large cage and toys and expensive food and vet visits for emergencies. <br>  <br>  Also, it is not different then getting a dog/cat other than it requires a life long commitment since they can outlive most humans.<br>  <br>  I suggest you guys start with a cockatiel! It's a great starter bird and as wonderful as any other bird species. They can be a bundle of joy.
Rw7gi86Naa	Spaying/neutering not only prevents unwanted animals from being euthanized, but it helps your pet avoid future behavioral and health problems. For more information on this subject, please visit this link: <a href="http://www.sniksnak.com/benefits.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sniksnak.com/benefits.html</a><br>  <br>  Please do not declaw!<br>  <br>  If you’re thinking about having your cat declawed, there are many things you should know before you make your decision.  The surgery is basically an American trend, and is considered inhumane and is illegal in many countries, (England, Scotland, Wales, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal, Belgium, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Yugoslavia and Japan).  If that doesn’t impact your opinion about declawing, maybe this website will help you decide: <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a> <br>  <br>  I believe that people who have their cats declawed are uneducated.  It is not very difficult to train your cat to use a scratching post.  The surgery is not simply a trimming of the claws, it’s an amputation of the distal phalanx, including bones, ligaments, and tendons! To remove the claw, the bone, nerve, joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and the extensor and flexor tendons must all be amputated.  If you were to make a comparison, it would be like having the last joint of each of our fingers chopped off.  So of course it is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery.  There are often many complications in the healing process, including infection often from litter box use, resulting in a life-long aversion to the litter box.  Other declawed cats that can no longer mark with their claws, will mark with urine instead, resulting in inappropriate elimination problems.  <br>  <br>  Many cats who have been declawed are traumatized and become withdrawn, nervous, fearful and/or aggressive.  Cats who went through the painful surgery are more prone to resort to biting when they feel threatened.  Since cats have emotional feelings, (just like we do) they can resent you if you decided to get them declawed.  All of these things can cause depression and ultimately lead to an overweight cat.<br>  <br>  If a cat who has been declawed accidentally escapes, he/she would be in great danger.  A cat needs it's claws to defend itself, as well as to escape by climbing.  The constant state of stress, caused by a feeling of defenselessness may make some declawed cats more prone to disease.  Also they cannot stretch their back and shoulder muscles like they do naturally when they dig their claws into a scratching post.  <br>  <br>  One popular alternative is Soft Paws.  They are lightweight vinyl nail caps that you glue on the cat's front claws.  They're great for households with small children and are extremely useful for people who are away from home all day and can't exercise the watchfulness necessary to train a cat to use a scratching post.  Soft Paws are easy to apply and last about four to six weeks.  They come in clear or colors--which are really fun.<br>  <br>  Most common types of damage are scratched furniture, ripped carpets and shredded wallpaper.  You want to eliminate the problem before it occurs.  Buy or build a stable, tall scratching-post, right from the start.  Here are some tips to do it right: If your cat is scratching your furniture or rugs, here is some advice on training them to use a scratching post:<br>  - The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope, (mine like the carpeted ones)<br>  - Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household <br>  - Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk <br>  - Introduce a new scratching-post with some catnip sprinkled on its surface.  Cats love that and it’s more attractive to them <br>  - If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, say "NO" and gently carry your cat to the desired post.  Demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.  If the cat doesn‘t catch on after trying this repeatedly for a few days, gently pick up his paws rub them along the post.<br>  - Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and plenty of affection.  The cat needs to know that using the scratching post results in positive things such as affection, playing and treats.<br>  - When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>  - Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself <br>  - Try some repellent like pepper-dust or some commercial products on your furniture to keep your cat off these areas<br>  - Be persistent and don't give up too soon<br>  <br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never u|`|4SQx8smEaa	Fixing your cat will not stop him from clawing at your carpets...and declawing is considered inhumane...they do not just remove the claw...they also cut off a part of their toe....I use soft claw on my cats, they are plastic/rubber cap that you glue to your kitties nails....it works really really good, and they are not too expensive, you can also put them on their back claws to keep your furniture from getting accidental scratches from when your kitty jumps off.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.softclaws.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.softclaws.com/</a><br>  <br>  You can get thrm from most pat atores...petsmart, petco, and superpetz.<br>  <br>  here is an article on declawing...<br>  <br>  Written by Veterinarian, Dr. Christianne Schelling <br>  <br>  If you are considering declawing your cat, please read this. It will only take a moment, and it will give you valuable information to help you in your decision. <br>  <br>  First, you should know that declawing is pretty much an American thing, it's something people do for their own convenience without realizing what actually happens to their beloved cat. In England declawing is termed "inhumane" and "unnecessary mutilation." I agree. In many European countries it is illegal. I applaud their attitude. <br>  <br>  Before you make the decision to declaw your cat, there are some important facts you should know. Declawing is not like a manicure. It is serious surgery. Your cat's claw is not a toenail. It is actually closely adhered to the bone. So closely adhered that to remove the claw, the last bone of your the cat's claw has to be removed. Declawing is actually an amputation of the last joint of your cat's "toes". When you envision that, it becomes clear why declawing is not a humane act. It is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery period. And remember that during the time of recuperation from the surgery your cat would still have to use its feet to walk, jump, and scratch in its litter box regardless of the pain it is experiencing. Wheelchairs and bedpans are not an option for a cat. <br>  <br>  No cat lover would doubt that cats--whose senses are much keener than ours--suffer pain. They may, however, hide it better. Not only are they proud, they instinctively know that they are at risk when in a weakened position, and by nature will attempt to hide it. But make no mistake. This is not a surgery to be taken lightly. <br>  <br>  Your cat's body is perfectly designed to give it the grace, agility and beauty that is unique to felines. Its claws are an important part of this design. Amputating the important part of their anatomy that contains the claws drastically alters the conformation of their feet. The cat is also deprived of its primary means of defense, leaving it prey to predators if it ever escapes to the outdoors. <br>  <br>  I have also had people tell me that their cat's personality changed after being declawed. Although, the medical community does not recognize this as potential side effect.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	If you get him neutered it will stop 90% of spraying - depends on how old he is and how much spraying he's done.<br>  <br>  Declawing is wrong - neutering has nothing to do with clawing.

It should stop him spraying, impregnating females, stop him getting testicular cancer, to name just a few reasons. As for clawing the carpets, this is natural behavior for a cat. Have you tried him with a scratching post? I cant believe that you would even consider having your precious cat declawed!! That is inhumane!!|`|7WUvPI8maa	Having him neutered will stop him from spraying in the house (it may take a little bit but it will stop within a month or so). It also allows them to live a longer healthier life because they are not prone to have genital cancer. As for the scratching, this will probably not make him stop. Cats scratch to sharpen and also maintain their claws. Buy a scratching post at a local store and place it where he scratches the most. This will help with him from destroying your furniture. Its never a good idea to declaw an animal, though, because if he ever gets out its his only way to fend for himself. Good Luck.|`|xUwWxKjhaa	Neutering will do a lot of good benefits for your cat. I just got my little guy fixed and he is much better. Other than the obvious benefits, my cat is being much more friendly, and less grumpy. He will stop spraying, clawing at carpets and humping objects if he was doing that. You will also see a increased mood and happier appearance.|`|3FOmoaUZaa	If he's already started spraying, he may never stop. U r supposed to get a cat neutered around 4 months old to avoid this completely. They spray to mark territory, so if u have other male cats around, he most likely won't stop spraying after he's neutered. I had a cat who we got neutered when he was 9 month old, and he still sprays. So, if ur cat is still young (4-7 months old) he most likely will not develop this problem. Also, the cost of neutering is usually between $50-75, which is much cheaper than spaying. <br>  <br>  Neutering reduces cat-cat aggression and number of unwanted kitties. It does cause them to gain weight, but obesity is easily preventable w/proper diet and exercise.<br>  <br>  Don't declaw ur cat. Teach him where appropriate places to scratch r (scratching posts/scratching rugs), and reward him when he gets it right. When u see him scratching ur carpet, simply pick him up and put him in front of his post w/his paws on it. When u c him doing it himself, praise him. It's that simple. Also, put the posts/rugs where he likes to scratch b/c cats like to mark w/their paws. My cat has a welcome mat and 2 scratching posts (one next to the couch and the other next to my bed) to satisfy her scratching needs. This is how I trained her, and she rarely uses my carpet ne more. It's much cheaper to get scratching posts than declaw ur cat. (I'm sure every1 is going to tell u all of the inhumane aspects, so I'm not going to mention it.)<br>  <br>  I also give my spoiled kitty a pedicure every week or so.|`|ApG0DpzXaa	Please, please don't declaw him.  Clip his nails and get a scratch post instead.  There are answers in the discover section on types of scratching posts and the evils of declawing, just do a search.<br>  <br>  Neutering also reduces his cancer risk and changes his temperament, he will become calmer.|`|f7zLs18caa	YES!  By spraying or clawing in certain sections of the carpet, he is marking his territory.  Neutering helps to stop this behavior.<br>  <br>  Clipping his nails in my experience is a much better alternative to declawing.  The declawing cats I've met all have biting and litter box issues (i.e. going outside of the litter box).  I'd rather have a cat that tries to scratch at things (but not too effectively due to the shorter nails), than having cat urine and feces around my house.<br>  <br>  I made my cats a "kitty condo" out of carpet remnants, sisal rope, a step ladder, wood (to make ledges) and concrete molds (big tubes), and put a couple of cheap cardboard cat scratchers with cat nip around the house.  I also laid carpet samples on the floor in front of their litter box, because they had a habit of trying to "cover" and scratch the carpet in front of the litter box.  You need to make sure the scratching posts etc are visible around the house, and aren't hidden in corners.<br>  <br>  To further help with behavioral problems, I would buy Feliway, I liked the kind that was a "plug in".  It releases a pheromone that calms cats.|`|DtkLsetkaa	OHHHH no declawing is bad!!!  So glad you asked about it, i don't have much time to type but there are many on here who will explain exactly why, VERY glad you asked about it!!  As far as neutering, it will help with his desire for territory (and his desire to mark it..) and will make him calmer and happier.  He will be groggy for a day or two after the surgery, but will be fine after that.  He will be a much happier, healthier, more well behaved cat.  Good luck to you!!!
Rw7gi86Naa	If you haven't brought the kitten into your home yet, when you see it next wipe him/her down with a towel and bring it home with you.  Set it very casually on the floor, and let your cats approach it, (don't bring your cats to the towel like you're showing them, let them find it on their own).  If you have plenty of time in advance, then leave the towel around for several days, and even bring more towels with the kittens’ scent.  Place them several places in the house, in the same way you “planted” the first one.  It may also be helpful to rub each of your cats down with separate towels and bring them to the kitten.<br>  <br>  When it’s time for the kitten to come home for the first time, as you are distracting your resident cats, have a friend, (someone who doesn’t live with you) bring the kitten in and place him or her in a room with the door closed.  Also ask your friend to get the food and water dishes and the litter box set up in the closed room.  Include toys and a bed, (or just a box with towels).  The litter box should be in the opposite side of the room from the food, water and bed.  DO NOT set up the kittens room before you bring him home.  This will only confuse your cats.  The point is to make your older cats think that the kitten suddenly, (and magically!) appeared, without your knowledge.<br>  <br>  Your cats will approach the door and pick up on the scent of the kitten.  Don’t get discouraged or worried if you hear some hissing and growling, as this is very common.  For the first couple days, spend a limited time in the room with the kitten and make sure to give your resident cats plenty of affection, even more than usual. Another helpful thing to try is to attach two toys with a string, and leave them on opposite sides of the door, so the cats can play together. <br>  <br>  Cats are very territorial animals, and this is why you don’t want them to see the kitten as an intruder that YOU brought home and shoved in their faces.  Cats are very much creatures of habit and routine, so when their routine is disrupted, don’t be surprised if they become very angry.  You must be the judge of when they should meet face-to-face, but don’t push things too quickly, it may take a few days of sniffing each other under the door before they have settled down.  When you believe they have calmed down and are ready, casually open the door a few inches.  Remember, you are being nonchalant about this; do not force them on each other.  You should pick a time after both the kitten and your resident cats have just eaten; feed them a treat that you know they will love, (like some of their favorite cooked meat).  They will be content and their bellies will be full, so they’re less likely to want to exert a lot of energy in a cat fight.  Supervise them and don’t be surprised if one of the older cats swats at or fights with the kitten.  Don’t step in and separate them unless someone’s getting hurt worse than just a scratch on the nose. The kitten will probably retreat into his room at which time you should close the door.  Increase the time you allow them to interact each day.  Don’t leave them together unattended until you are confident that they comfortable with each other.  Be patient.  It may take a few weeks or even a few months, but if all goes well they will soon become the best of friends.<br>  <br>  Extra tip: to ease the initial tension of introduction, rub each cat down with brewer's yeast powder. Brewer's yeast is available in natural food stores. It's all natural, full of vitamin B, and will actually go good for the cats to lick it off. The smell of the brewers yeast helps disguise the foreign odors and each cat will basically smell the same. Don't use anything like baby powder because the talc isn't good for the cat to breathe or ingest. You should use the same grooming tools (combs, brushes, towels, mitts) on both cats to transfer their scents to one another.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zeTGmB3faa	Just bring him out, hold him, put the other cats on the sofa on the other side of you, pet and talk to all. They will hiss meow and give each other a few swats. If they really get into a big cat fight, give them the water spray treatment. This rarely happens, just the normal introduction attitude. I will be doing the same thing in about 2 weeks. My cat won't be happy at first, but she will adjust. She has no choice.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	keep the kitten separate for at least 2-3 weeks.  Introduce them slowly - they're most likely all not going to get along at first.  It is IMPORTANT that you keep the kitten in "neutral territory" ex- dont put the new kitty where the old ones often go.  Keep him in a spare bedroom or something along those lines.  Give them 'visiting times' - like for the first few days take the new cat out for 5 minutes around your other cats - the few days after that, take the new kitty out for 10 min at a time -- etc.. <br>  <br>  They're going to hiss and swat at each other (this is normal).  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your new family member!|`|oF3O8jGSaa	well first hold the cat and let the others come to him. then after that slowly give him a  ittle slack. if they get into a fight during the process then pick him up and take him to the other room do this for a bout thirty minutes a day. and before u know it they will get along very well.|`|fb91d7787ff11d494c4d4fc23a885c5aaa	Just went through this exact same thing! Make sure you keep the new Kitty separate for AT LEAST a week. It's ok if they play paws under the door, thats a good sign. Rub the cats with a towel and let them smell each others scents. Also try feeding the cats with the towel under there bowl. That way they associate each other with good things like eating. After a few days, open the door a crack and let them see each other. At the end of a week, put the new cat in a crate and let the other cats come see him. The less hissing and growling the better. Try this a few times and once they seem calm, try face to face interaction, but monitor it closely! Once everyone seems calm, no growling or hissing, you should be fine. If not, go back a few steps and repeat. I know a week seems like a long time, but you want the cats to be curious rather than feel threatened. I was really hesitant to wait this long but I'm so glad I did because my cats get along great now.

Remember never to force them open either, it's important to let them take there natural course. If they open to soon then they could go blind. <br>  <br>  When I had kittens around, I held them about 3 days after they were born. The mother was fine with it and fine with them when they were returned. I guess it really depends on the mother, if she trusts you and is comfortable with you holding her kittens. Try it out and see how she reacts.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	You can handle kittens briefly in front of mom cat from the day they are born.  Kittens open eyes from about 5-14 days.  Usually shorthair kittens will open eyes by 7-8 days; longhairs take another week.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	"Shorthair kittens begin to open their eyes at 5-8 days. Longhair kittens do not open their eyes until 10-14 days. Isn't that strange? So if some of your kittens don't have their eyes open yet, but the others do, it may be because they are longhaired. All kittens' eyes are beautiful deep orbs of blue at first. They will look like this until the kittens are three weeks old. Then the iris and pupil will form and the kitten's permanent eye colors will slowly emerge. At first, although the eyes are open, the kittens are still almost completely blind."|`|N8wNmQShaa	it could be up to 2 weeks before they open their eyes.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  I have had so many cats neutered during my over 40 years of being owned by them, and I never had a cat have to wear an e-collar post surgery and none of my vets have ever suggested this practice. Cats are not fond of them in the least. I cannot believe you were instructed to keep in on for two weeks., Unless there was a complication requiring more extensive surgery, this is really strange.  I would also think they would have told you that the surgery was complicated if it were. Perhaps they said "two days"?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.justanswer.com/questions/8q8k-male-cat-wear-e-collar-neutering" rel="nofollow">http://www.justanswer.com/questions/8q8k...</a><br>  <br>  Under normal circumstances cats do quite well after this surgery rarely with complications.<br>  <br>  I have a cat who from time to time needs to wear an e-collar because he scratches his neck raw due to allergies and anxiety periodically. He has never gotten pee on the carpet after using the litter box. I take it off when I feed him, as it gets really messy if I leave it on, and replace it after he is finished.  It may be that your cat is still feeling the effects of anesthesia and is a little groggy and not too well coordinated yet.<br>  <br>  If it were my cat, I would call a local vet and ask if this is necessary... but for sure two weeks is totally excessive.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your kitty and thanks for adopting a cat needing a home.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member: Cat Writer's Association<br>  <br>  Edit:  I saw my vet the other day, and asked her the question as I was concerned for you.

So I can add a veterinarian's input now as well.|`|8e13291b33ff9fcfc620b014d57ead81aa	You may take the collar off only when you are able to monitor his grooming habits.<br>  When you are not with him and are sleeping it should remain on him.<br>  <br>  The e collar is extremely important and probably was put on him because he started to over groom the surgical area while hospitalized.<br>  <br>  What you may not be aware of is that there are typically no sutures involved in a feline castration.<br>  Two incisions are made into each sac and the testicles are ligated (tied off) by making a knot of the remaining tissue.<br>  The remaining knotted tissue is placed back in the sac and it is left open. No sutures are used the incision heals by second intention.<br>  <br>  So basically your cat has two open wounds located on his scrotal sac.<br>  If he over grooms or starts biting the area he could cause an infection to develop<br>  Sorry to be so graphic but I just don't think people realize that its not typically closed up with sutures.<br>  <br>  So keep the e-collar on as he will heal faster and not fuss with the incision site|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi i can't believe they needed to put a collar on him that's the first vet i think i've heard of putting a collar on a neuter.  Did they have to go in the abdomen to get the other testicle?  What i would do is when you are there and spend time with him take the collar off.  The major thing is that he does not lick and chew at the wound.  When he has his collar off watch him like a hawk and make sure he does not do this.  I would call the vet again tomorrow and ask them if he absolutely has to have it on and explain the reasons and problems he is having with it.  Make sure he is able to get water and food too..even if you have to hold the dishes for him.  Good Luck!|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	This summer my female kitten came home from her spay, ran under the bed and came out without the e-collar the vet office had put on her.  She never touched her incision and the stitches were removed ten days later.<br>  <br>  In short, I think it very EXTREME that a male kitty would need a collar for 2 weeks..  I would be willing to bet that he will not touch his incisions at all.|`|q0vKbocHaa	sorry, but you have to keep it on, he will lick it and re-open the wound which means you'd probably have to go back to the vet|`|OmEcQevtaa	make your own smaller one itll help and make sure she/ he can see|`|Cu9DU88Paa	Keep taking it off and keep putting it on for the whole 2 weeks. Tough luck... POOR KITTY CUTESY!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!
fOLO4TNhaa	I have been volunteering at my shelter for a long time now. We do have a youth group. Which is 13+. They do the more simple task such as socializing the cats, walking the dogs (With an adult). Playing with the dogs outside of there cage etc. They also help feed and clean. Clean hallways, clean feeding area etc.<br>  <br>  Honestly it all depends on your place and there rules.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	All shelters are different, some require you to be trained (three of my four local shelters require a two hour training session prior to becoming a volunteer).<br>  <br>  Call your shelter and ask what the requirements are, make sure they know you and your dad are both going to volunteer. <br>  <br>  Since you're still a minor, its likely that they'll have you exercising the animals and cleaning out cages or feeding. They can't have you do anything medical (like give shots, or medicate) because you're not 18.|`|paaozogGaa	OOH I am thinking about doing this too, with my mom!<br>  I might volenteer at the humane society, but there are a few no kill shelters here in town and my mom thinks it might be better to support those type of places. Anyway it is great to help out any way you can! I really just want to play with the dogs and cats but there are certain jobs like being a dog walker. I am not sure about the age restrictions though!|`|OrvTG44laa	Usually, they don't let kids under 16 help out with dogs.  At least at the shelter I went to they didn't.  They said it was too much of a risk.  They do let you help out with cats.  You can go to a shelter, play with cats and get community service for it.  To do this, you just walk in.  If you are talking about actually working there, then you probably could.  They won't let you walk dogs though.  You would probably just play with cats, give them food and clean up after them.|`|LURQBU86aa	Generally at the shelter I volunteer at they have the younger volunteers socialize with the animals, which basically means that you get to play with and cuddle the cats and dogs. Good for you for volunteering! Keep up the good work!|`|QVP8zSuWaa	I don't know what your shelter will allow you to do. Probably walk dogs, socialize kitties and things like that. Call you shelter and ask. I am sure they are all different. Mine will not let anyone under 15 volunteer.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	well<br>  <br>  clean up has to be done first<br>  <br>  cleaning up poo, pee, newspapers<br>  cleaning toys and laundry<br>  feeding the animals<br>  <br>  then the fun stuff<br>  <br>  like socializing the cats<br>  at my shelter, you have to be 16 to walk dogs<br>  <br>  <br>  its not just fun stuff. its the gross stuff as well<br>  <br>  signing up..call them or go there and ask<br>  good luck and thanks for volunteering!
OuI5eFcmaa	I have a beagle (notoriously loud) and I simply never let her get away with it. Of course I have had her since she was 9 wks old so she was raised with my rules. If you have ever seen "it's me or the dog" - I use the annoying "Ay" sound to let her know what she's doing is unacceptible - but even more important is to make sure that you aren't inadvertanly encouraging the behavior by giving him more attention when he does this.<br>  It may also help to train him in the basic commands - it will teach him whos boss and make him more eager to please you.<br>  Good luck.|`|L22hVXTIaa	How long have you had the dog?   Did you try to find out where he came from? Have you had him checked out by a vet?  It sounds as though he is depressed or anxious about something.   Could be that he's missing his previous owners?|`|mOFShz3Eaa	is he fixed? my german shepard used to do this all the time! lol so your not alone. we took him to be fixed and the howling meaculously STOPPED !! woo hoo, hurray for quiet dogs!!|`|Yqy9fXcyaa	my dog used to do that he would whine evan if i petted him. so i signed him up for obediance school it really helped alot.|`|L9BvnAXSaa	Some breeds are very vocal.  You may have adopted a dog that is not suitable for you.  Look up the breed of your dog on the internet (if you know) and see if the behavior matches your dogs.  Otherwise you need a animal behaviorist to help you break the dog of a bad habit.<br>  Good Luck|`|1c9bb9b0490977041030a1689485e446aa	well i will tell ya now he is a hound dog, most likely a beagel,this is what they do,Did you try leaving a radio or TV on while you are out ? Sometimes a lil backround noise will help out a little.Any questions contact me direct at thepuppyguy@yahoo.com|`|rjXy9A8maa	You should take him to the doctors or see if somethings in his feet or something.|`|VMY7No0eaa	what breed? Bassets are howlers and some others like Coon hound.<br>  There is a thing that emits a high pitched sound when they howl.. which distracts him<br>  This may be why you found him in a snow bank... someone else got tired of it.<br>  have you tried the no bark collar? with this kind of problem it sounds like something that would really work. <br>  and having it fixed wouldn't be bad. <br>  good luck|`|S8Qpiabdaa	spray him with water but he does probley need to be fixed

When they are sound asleep and snoring, there is energy transfer in the muscles and they will twitch.  My cavalier twitches, snores, eyes open and moving and he often makes little barking noises.  Some of the movement can definitely seem as if they are dreaming.  <br>  <br>  Perfectly normal.|`|WcgKT98haa	Completely normal.  <br>  <br>  Our "special" beagle kicks her legs and feet like she's running then she starts doing a hushed barking noise.  Just a minute ago she was doing this and her hackles raised up while she was twitching.<br>  <br>  It usually means they're dreaming about something.  I like to think that they're chasing something good to eat.|`|tMEUPBo4aa	Your cat is dreaming! <br>  <br>  My tabby cat does that every night, twitches, shakes, and snores louder than I do. Seriously, I wish there was "Nasal Snore Tabs" for cats ... it crazy!!!|`|oF3O8jGSaa	its usually normal because just like us dogs have dreams and they twitch becuase of the dream so nothin got worry about.|`|p2M40EnYaa	He is dreaming. Our dog barks when she dreams and her legs all run. Theres nothing wrong! Dont worry.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	The thing you need to consider here is that your tank is a tall tank, not long. Fish are lateral swimmers and for that reason I would say you do not have room for both the Neon and Harlequin shoal. Pick one or the other.<br>  <br>  Mike E's answer made me squirm - Paradise Fish are monsters, they chewed all the fins off a Betta before I came to the rescue - the Betta survived but had no fins left. Paradise Gouramis need species tanks only. Bettas cannot be kept with any kind of Gourami.<br>  <br>  For your tank as centrepiece look into Honey Gouramis, Colisa chuna. They're not huge but you don't want huge in that tank with those fish. Honeys are peaceful, hardier than their Dwarf Gourami cousins and would work in your tank in a male/2 female trio.|`|gQongGHUaa	way too many fish. i would go a maximum of 12 fish.  i would get 4 neon's, 3 rasboras, 2 cory cats, and for a center piece you could get some gouramis (2 would be enough).  get as many ghost shrimp as you like.  i would suggest maybe 3-5|`|M3pjhIecaa	measure back to front and then times by the length this will give you the surface area, 12sq in per inch of fish is the guide but you could halve that for the neon's, in a standard tank it would give you between 28-36 inch of fish in the category you're looking at, so you're really pushing it for space as im thinking with what you mention you have exceeded that already however, its a guide and im sure if you build up slowly the stocks you should be fine. as a suggestion Kribensis or Rams, these are not overly large will provide a sufficient threat to the tetras to keep them in a shoal.|`|1D8tMCYIaa	I would like to know what the two larger fish are. You need to look up profiles of fish and see how big they get. Most places sell fish either when they are very little or middle aged so you never really see how big they can get. <br>  <br>  You have to cut one or two species of fish out of this considering corys, neon tetras and rasboras like to be in schools of 6 or more. That would be too many fish. <br>  <br>  Also, your shrimp can be eaten very easily by larger fish so you have to keep that in mind when you consider what you want to put in your tank. <br>  <br>  Before you put anything in the tank, you must cycle it first so your fish can live stress free and not die from ammonia poisoning.
a2cjwMKcaa	I haven't worked with DIY CO2 generators, just home brewing, but the principle is the same.<br>  <br>  I suggest the baking soda and gelatin are there to provide needed nutrients for the Yeast to feed on and multiply. They convert sugar into energy and CO2, but they need other elements to actually re-produce. When we buy brewing yeast for fermenting plain sugar it comes with some mystery 'nutrients' mixed in. I suspect they are mostly baking soda and gelatin. So if you add those you get more and healthier yeast cells in your fermenter.<br>  <br>  Ian
Wg1ZTdUYaa	Palpating the doe would be the only sure way of detecting pregnancy prior to the actual delivery of a litter. This is a process of "feeling" the embryos inside the doe. It takes practice, and can be harmful to the doe and litter if done incorrectly.For the novice, it is sometimes just better to just wait the duration of the gestation period and hope the doe kindles a live and healthy litter. the gestation period of a rabbit is 28 - 32 days.<br>  You should be sure to mark down the date when your doe was bred. As the gestation period is 28 - 32 days, a nesting box should be provided to the doe about 25 or 26 days after the date she was bred. The box should be filled with a nesting material, such as straw or another material that she can use to build a nest. In most cases, the doe will also pull some of her fur to include with the nesting materials, and act as a blanket for the new born kits.<br>       The nesting box should be about 2 - 4 inches longer and wider than the doe herself. Larger boxes may encourage her to use it as a resting place, and she may foul the box.<br>       After you believe the doe has had her litter (if any signs indicate such), it is good to try and check the box. Remember, the doe may be protective of her newly born kits, so be careful. Remove any afterbirth or dead babies from the box, as they will decay and the doe may abandon the remaining live kits due to the unpleasant smell.<br>       Mother nature should take her course and the doe should raise the kits with no problem. If you encounter something that does not seem ordinary, contact us and we will try to be of assistance to you.<br>  the male and female should be separated at all times!|`|TrTfowAQaa	if your bunny is still young she will Birth fine on her own. she will only be prego for 28 days. leave her alOne during & after birth. use vanilla on your hands & her nose if you must take a peek! bunnys can be very funny... give her a nest box now. she will pull hair and get very protective if she is close to her due date. respect her wishes if she wants to be left alone. one time many years back we raised rabbits for pets. if she is too old 4 to 6 years (i think) her hips will be set in place she will not be able to birth if shes never done it before. all the babies will be still born long after the 28 day mark & without treatment she too will die. this happened to me once when didn't know the history of one of the does I got. we got her treatment & she pulled through. I wouldn't worry about your bunny just make sure you get them new homes at 4 or 5 weeks old or you may end up with bunnys coming out of your ears!!!|`|NHUyVepKaa	dont worry, look online for what you should get to make a prego bunny more comfortable during pregnancy. you can sell give or keep the babies.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	No fish grows to the size of their tank per say. In a small tank with bad water quality, the fish will get stunted, sickly and die. If, however, you somehow manage to keep the water quality good in a small tank the fish will keep growing, like a Goldfish I helped get rescued a few months back, was a 12" Comet in a 10-12 gallon tank, it could barely turn around, but the owner had managed to keep the water quality healthy enough that the fish's genetics just kept it growing.<br>  <br>  So yes, fish outgrow tanks if the water quality is good. If the water quality is bad, they'll suffer and die before they get to that point.<br>  <br>  House a fish based on it's adult size, never on it's juvenile size. Comets should get 12"-14" excluding fins.|`|SK4qj3ZEaa	Small tanks only slow growth.  Stunted growth from the small tank will cause the fish health problems and it will drastically shorten their life span.

Deb4iqbvaa	If the dog is super skinny, I'd call te ASPCA to check him out. You can make an anonymous report, they will check on him. This guy won't know that you're the one who called. <br>  <br>  He may LOOK mean, but maybe he needs some help feeding his animals. The ASPCA may be able to help him out there. I once met a guy who looked like garbage and actually smelled, turned out he spent every dime he had on his cats. The cats were checked on and they were the happiest, healthiest, most spoiled cats in the world! Then again,  I've also gotten anonymous tips where "the dog is super skinny" and it ends up being a lean dog like a Greyhound who is supposed to look that way.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to call the ASPCA, they have a lot of experience and they know what to look for in situations like this. Thanks for caring about the animals, they can't call the ASPCA themselves so the world needs people like you. :)|`|KmC0K59taa	The hamsters are not in a cage?  They just still perfectly still?

If they are shivering and underweight, then calling the ASPCA would be the right thing to do.|`|7WUvPI8maa	Yes, you should call the ASPCA. Its better to have them come and investigate and find nothing wrong (or that the animals are being neglected) then to sit around and do nothing.|`|GLFEdmJeaa	call the police.

They will investigate him I'm sure. You also might be able to take a video of the act and show it to an investigator.

They are featured on Animal Planets Animal Cops.  Anne Marie Lucas is one of their investigators, if the dogs look underfed then I would contact the Animal Control division of the ASPCA they are known as the Animal Law Enforcement Agents, they do have the power of the police to make arrests and issue fines and citations to people not caring properly for their animals.  The least they could do is check to make sure all his animals are cared for properly including the fact that they have all their shots and are receiving medical care when needed.  I believe they do infact work out of the ASPCA Humane Society that is located in New York.  This is their number to call to report cruelty In NYC: (212) 876-7700, ext. 4450<br>  <br>  I'd call rather than write a letter, it's much quicker, ask to speak to an investigator.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA10283080	Yes call the ASPCA.

Yes, you can call...but unless the dog and animals are emaciated (too skinny) they probably won't be able to do a thing.  If they are knowledgeable about the situation though they may keep a closer eye out.  If you watch the dog shows on tv...they scope them out a while before they process anything.  They do their homework.  I would do it if it were me...how could you watch and do nothing.  If enough people call, something could possibly be done.  I train animals.  They will sit as long as I tell them.  I would not do it all day, it is not good for them to sit still in the cold, not exercise or be loved on.  Do what you know your heart is telling you to do.  I will warn, don't tell him you did it or say any more to him than what you already have.  You need to be careful for your own safety.  You do not know what he is capable of...if he hits animals into that kind of submission, he certainly would be someone I would be wary of.  I wish you much luck love.

987923b8a7fffddd6d84106ce71d68a3aa	Sweetie, how old is your cat? This could be a form of kitty cancer. It sounds bad I know. Please take your precious kitty to the vet, My cat had all of her shots,etc. We had her for 18 years. She had a form of cancer and kidney failure and was exhibiting the same symptoms as your cat. Please take him to the vet and have them run blood tests.|`|8gwgEXDKaa	My friend had this problem. What i would do is feed your cat a lot of soft food. Or you could hand feed her with kitten milk which works when cats need to gain weight. And leave some sort of food for her out at all times. i know usually people only have schedule meals but she needs to eat as much has possible. For the restroom problem. Put litter boxes where she can get to them easily. And if you spot your cat pawing the ground or sniffing around take her to where she can use the restroom. i Hope this helps.
C1eHfhrHaa	It is bad if you did not ask your neighbor's permission.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Without asking, yes.  He could have a medical condition or a penchant for swallowing things whole.  <br>  <br>  Better yet, you should ask his owners before you give him something.<br>  <br>  But good for you and your kind heart.|`|yCR6qg0baa	The tennis ball is ok.... but never give someone else's pet(s) treats though without permission. You have no idea if he's on a special diet or if he has a health problem. Do they leave him outside all day? I don't understand why people buy a dog just to leave it outside and ignore it. It's cruel, but unfortunately, if the dog looks healthy & has clean water, there's nothing to stop them.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	I'm sure you meant well, but please don't ever give another person's dog anything to eat or play with unless you've asked the owner if it's OK.<br>  <br>  Some dogs will tear up a tennis ball and could choke on the pieces (mine don't get tennis balls for that reason).  And you don't know if the dog might be allergic to something in the treat.  If the dog suffered an allergic reaction, the owner and the vet would not know what it might be reacting to.<br>  <br>  Also, it's never a good idea to approach a dog by yourself, especially on the dog's own property.  Many dogs are very protective of their homes and yards, and some will attack a trespasser.|`|lDXh0jRVaa	Yes. You don't know if the dog has allergies and there are a lot of allergens in dog treats. I assume you did not pay for a 15 dollar bag of treat. <br>  A tennis ball can get caught in a dogs throat...they can suffocate and die. My dogs are not allowed to have tennis balls. Also, the material used to make tennis balls severely wears down the teeth. <br>  <br>  Unless you've asked the owner, never give a dog anything.|`|q0vKbocHaa	no its fine, as long as the people aren't against toys it shouldn't be a problem|`|OuI5eFcmaa	If you're worried that the owners may think that this act of kindness was actually a judgment upon them for not properly caring for their dog and being sure that he is stimulated in some way - good. From what you describe, they should be judged for condemning a social animal to solitude and boredom.|`|rjXy9A8maa	No,its fine as long as the owners aren't against toys or treats.Does the neighbors have a fence because if the dogs fierce,you should throw the stuff over.|`|KuUx34hCaa	ask the dog's owner if some thing happen to the dog they might be able to blame you if you don't have their permission|`|hXjsJ2Ctaa	it isn't bad it's kinda nice
1c9bb9b0490977041030a1689485e446aa	Crate training is always best,Another trick is take him out....bring him in...take him out.They go out come in and feel the warm house and THEN they have to go, Try this...it should work. Another thing about labs, they are the #1 dog to own all around BUT they will act like a puppy for up to 2 years. Labs are great dogs.Good for you for not disciplining him.Too many people just wanna hit a dog when they do something wrong. For leash training keep him close to you,Dont give him ANY extra  space to walk in front of you,He is gonna pull but will come around. Feel free to contact me<br>  <br>  thepuppyguy@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  thepuppyguy@yahoo.com|`|AA12192261	give him time please he is only a baby i think he is doing great|`|apMO5YLTaa	well when it comes to puppies they like two things praise and treats. so when you do get your pup to go "number 2" outside praise him and give him a treat. he will figure out that he gets what he wants when he goes outside. it worked with my pups hope it works for yours
o93EwErKaa	At 28 days your vet has a window of about 5 days that he will be able to feel the abdomen to determine pregnancy.  After that an ultrasound or x-ray (done late in pregnancy) will be needed.  It's always a good idea to get a vet involved early to answer any questions you may have and be on call in case of an emergency.  At 4 weeks you should notice her waistline disappearing, but the real weight gain doesn't begin showing until 6 or 7 weeks and maybe more with a large dog carrying a small litter.  Her stomach would also be firm.  Her teats firm and slightly more pronounced.<br>  <br>  The odds of her being pregnant are high.  The clinginess is a sign.  I would be very careful in not feeding her a balanced commercial food preparation.  Pregnant dogs know they need extra nutrition and will eat what you supply for them.  Put her on a high quality puppy food (no corn, no soy, no wheat, no by-products and a named meat in meal form as the first ingredient).  It is normal to have a short period of lack of appetite and maybe even some morning sickness at about 2 weeks, but shouldn't be the case at 4 weeks.  Maybe you spoiled her with table scraps when she went off food during that time?|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Go to the vet. If she IS pregnant, then she has a little under 35 days to go. <br>  <br>  It may not be too late to have an emergency ovariohysterectomy done.
5i8lDbXfaa	"I think he has started having back pain. He doesn't buck or rear but when i brush him he dances around the cross ties like his back hurts. And he hollow out his back when i put the saddle on him. I don't know what to do because i know the saddle fits him."<br>  <br>  Sweetie that saddle doesn't fit him if this is happening with the western and not with the english.  Take him to an actual western tack fitter and have it done the right way.  His is in pain!<br>  <br>  I really think it's the saddle, a normal saddle pad (not the back support ones) is really just to keep the rubbing of the saddle causing damage.  You might look into an actual orthopedic pad. Like this <a href="http://www.horse.com/Ride-n-Lite-Orthopedic-Saddle-Pad-WIR29.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.horse.com/Ride-n-Lite-Orthope...</a><br>  <br>  But first you need to rule out the actual saddle not fitting.  The saddle fitters will also be able to find the right pad he needs with his saddle.<br>  <br>  If it was joint pain, he would be limping or refusing to move. His head will bob in weird ways, like to far down or to far up if his leg joints are the problem.   If you are this concerned call a vet.  : )<br>  <br>  "wait could it be where i place the saddle that could be causing the pain?"<br>  Not tyring to sound sarcastic...but ya thats kinda the whole point is putting the saddle on the right way....<br>  <br>  Watch this video, click on the one that says "Saddle Fit"<br>  <a href="http://www.horse.com/Western-Tack.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.horse.com/Western-Tack.html</a>|`|1gbR22CRaa	You need to contact an equine vet or equine chiropractor.|`|psNR7hDJaa	I would say get a chiro to look at him. Also get a professional saddle fitter out. You may think it fits but it might actually not be at points. It could also be the saddle pad. Has he been getting any saddle sores? Has he had any bad experiences with western saddles for tacking up? Also always check your saddle pad before putting it on as there could be something on it that is bugging him.|`|AA11484393	If he is in pain, the saddle does NOT fit.  Get a saddler and a chiropractor out to look at him and give you some help.  Some of those wide arabs are really hard to fit...especially with western saddles.  If you can't get ANYTHING to fit, I would suggest trying a high quality treeless, especially if you are not doing any really hard riding.|`|RloOJ43haa	How do you KNOW the saddle fits? Are you a saddle fitter?

0nIwKd5Uaa	We used to have a dog who barked at black people also. The biggest problem was that in our town there isn't a whole lot of black people, but luckily there is a little girl (12ish) up the road. We asked her if she could meet our dog. Like when on a walk would she be willing to pet him or even just talk to us or our little girl.  After awhile he stopped barking at other black people as well. I think it has something to do with being different. Kind of like dogs who bark at police, or other people in uniform.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Socialization.  Its highly likely he's just barking at a person that looks different than what he's use to.  Just like some dogs don't like men (if they are primarily around women) or don't like children (if they don't have much interaction with them).  Perhaps your dog just hasn't had much interaction with 'black people'.  Your dog just needs more socialization.  That's all.  As well as some training.  Training him to sit and be quiet when he sees/meets new people will help a lot.  When he's sitting and quiet, the new person can offer a treat.  He'll soon realize that all people are potential friends.|`|MKuDawP7aa	Dogs bark for many reasons: They may be lonely or bored; they may be hungry, afraid or too cold or hot. Also keep in mind that breeds like Fox Terrier, Beagle, Yorkshire Terrier, Miniature Schnauzer, Cairn terrier tend to bark more than others. Barking is a form of communication for any dog and it can be very useful especially when they warn you of a potential danger, but excessive barking can be very annoying. Regardless of the reasons why your dog barks, there are ways to make it stop.<br>  <br>  Here are 5 easy ways to make your dog stop barking:<br>  <br>  <br>  Show your dog who is in charge: As soon as your dog starts barking, tell him in a strong voice to stop. If he continues, repeat the instruction many times. In cause he doesn't obey... <br>  Ignore him: Don't even look at him or turn your head towards him, simply walk away. It's very important to stop reinforcing bad behavior. Many dog owners "bribe" their dogs to stop barking, which usually brings the opposite results. He must understand that what he's doing is wrong. If this technique works and your dog stops barking, then.... <br>  Praise him: Walk over to him and give him a little treat. This way he will understand that being quiet will get him more food and attention. <br>  Take him for a walk: Dogs need to exercise for at least 30 minutes a day. Your dog needs an outlet for his energy or else he will become frustrated and restless. Also exercise will tire him out and make him calmer, because he will be too exhausted to start barking. <br>  Keep him busy: Many dogs bark out of boredom. Give him lots of toys to keep him happy or leave the TV or the radio on to give him a sense of company.<br>  <br>  If you have trouble getting your dog to obey your commands, keep in mind that with proper training this problem can be eliminated.|`|0m6BgESXaa	Jan's advice is terrible x.x<br>  <br>  Don't repeat the commands, you're only teaching him to ignore you.<br>  <br>  Your problem is actually a very common one :-)  The dog is simply reacting to something that he is not used to.  He's not racist, just unsure (racism is a human concept).  It's no different than if he would bark at every person that wore a hat.<br>  <br>  Being black myself, I know what it's like to have a dog bark at me because he's unsure.  I live in an area where there aren't many black people and so the dogs don't get to experience them very much.  I've approached dogs that were fine with white people, asian people, native americans, but when confronted with my own self were very unsure.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is find as many black people as you can and ask if they'd be willing to pet your dog and give him treats so they're not so scary.|`|yXUS7jz5aa	There's not much you can do.One of my boys has the same trait and is getting in to trouble on a daily bases now.If you find a solution please let me know.|`|VtKY6XVvaa	WOW! My dog used to do the same thing and I was so embarrassed. I would take Jan's advice...those are all good techniques to train your dog not to bark|`|qWyVss7Zaa	It's b/c the person has shown fear of your dog at one time or another. Your dog was barking, growling, to be protective. If this person ran, showed fear, etc. your dog takes this as an "award". Alright I scared this person.
Um8osMNuaa	Nothing, if they say no, then it's no. To give a dog the home it deserves all the family need to want one, if not then chances are that dog will have a miserable life or end up in a shelter, is that what you really want, better to wait until you are in a position to get your own dog.|`|PM23RDycaa	Not a damn thing. You were given an answer so stop trying to change that answer to the one you wanted to hear. Life is not fair and there is no rule saying you have to have a dog growing up.<br>  <br>  Grow up<br>  Go to college<br>  Get a job<br>  Ge a dog friendly apartment<br>  Get a dog.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	If a child of mine whined & whined & nagged & nagged about getting a dog that would be the last thing I would get them.  Whiners & naggers are not responsible enough to have a pet much less a dog.<br>  <br>  All the expense would be out of your parents pockets & they may not be able to afford one.  Owning a dog is expensive especially the first year.  The cost of the dog, the cost of all the puppy shots & rabies at 6 months, booster shots, spaying or neutering, food & water bowls, leashes & collars, grooming equipment & on & on & on.  That is all well over $500 & could go even higher & probably is.<br>  <br>  You may have to wait until you are no longer under your parents roof to get you a dog.|`|AA11026827	nothing.  I've wanted a dog since I was 5, I'm now almost 20.  Volunteer at a shelter, that helped me with my "dog-itch".<br>  <br>  <br>  ADDITION:  Gabby, my parents had all the same arguments with me, and I felt the same as you, and I was going to pay for EVERYTHING, not just half like you stated.  You're just not going to be able to change their mind, and as hard as that is to face, you have to deal with it.  They've made up their mind; you have to live with it.|`|p7swtBYzaa	You don't, you wait until you have your own place, then get one.<br>  Dogs should be wanted by every member of the family, not fair to the people or the dog otherwise.|`|KxjUim7yaa	If you can't change their mind. ask for a cat|`|cY8DgJv5aa	I suggest asking them to sit down with you and discuss why a dog isn't an option at this time.  Perhaps when you know why they said 'no', you'll have a better understanding and realize that it really is best to wait.  I don't think parents should just say 'no'.  It leaves room for kids to beg and try to persuade them.  If everyone can be mature and just sit down and discuss it, you'll all be better off.|`|0dda4d5d5420e22adc401448a90f4f83aa	Nothing.<br>  Dogs should not be owned by children, they will at some point require adults - be it vet bills or walking whilst child is at school or a home when child decides to go to university. If you are not able to support a dog yourself for the rest of it's life then you can only get a family dog and if other members of your family aren't willing to take on the responsibility that is that. Bringing a dog into a home where it is unwanted by even one member of the household will only end in disaster.|`|0OSr4gQDaa	there is prob not much more you can do. i just got a new puppy and have had him for a month there is a serious amount of work invoved in training and minding a puppy as it basically needs constant attention for the first few months not to mention trying to house train them and stop them biting and chewing everything in sight!! be sure you really want this puppy before you try persuading your parents again!!|`|OrvTG44laa	First, you have to find out why they're against it.  If they say 'because we said so', or 'we don't want a dog in the house', try to get a better answer.  Once they give you specific answers, just fix the problems they have with getting a dog.<br>  For example, if it's the money, tell them you will pay for it.  Save up, and pay for the dog, it's food, it's toys and it's shots yourself.  If money is the reason and you were going to be paying for it, they should have no problem with getting a dog.  If they think you won't take care of it and they'll get stuck with it, show them you're committed.  Ask to make a deal with them.  You keep up with chores, showing them responsibility, and you can get a dog.  If you have any other pets in the house, take care of them to show you can take care of a pet.  If they are worried about shedding or the dog making a mess, tell them you will train it.  You can get a very small dog, which won't make that many messes.  You can bring the dog to obedience classes, but it's pretty expensive.  Maybe get a trained dog at a shelter- you'd be surprised how well trained dogs in a shelter can be.  If it's because you have other pets that it wouldn't get along with, like a cat, get a dog that is friendly with other animals.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	If you need to come online and ask strangers to help you persuade your parents after they've already said no, you're not mature enough to handle the responsibilities and maturities that come with owning a dog.<br>  <br>  Go do your homework.|`|TAfyS52naa	No is no except it.  Maybe your just to spoiled, or maybe they don't have the money.  Have you considered the cost to care for a dog and todays economy.|`|q0vKbocHaa	Responsiblity goes a long way.

I would show your parents that you are responsible, by following their rules, getting good grades, helping out with out being asked.  Wait a couple of months and do some research as to how much a dog costs in vet bills, food etc. You will need to know how much the dog needs to be walked. Come up with a plan of how you will be able to help with these expenses. Get your plan together  and present this info to your parents.

They should also never be given chocolate or toffee, or similar sweets which could affect their teeth. They should not have foods that contain whole oats with the husks still on, as these can puncture their cheek pouches, which are quite sensitive.<br>  <br>  <br>  THEY CAN EAT <br>  Hamsters will eat all kinds of vegetables and fruit, cereals, seeds and even dairy foods. They are omnivorous, and get protein from eating small insects and grubs, and their teeth benefit from crunching on the occasional hard dog biscuit. In their natural habitat, hamsters eat grasses, seeds and grains. because they are members of the rodent family, their teeth are continually growing, so they need hard items to wear down the teeth. Pieces of non-treated wood are good for them.<br>  <br>  Want more info email me at kaylynroxs@yahoo.com <br>  Had hamster for 6 years!

Who knows, maybe the father was a Greyhound...no tellin.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Obviously it came from the father.|`|Pw0QsBk8aa	i know a terrier dog is a small breed of dog too but as for body type there are alot of diff..  where the bas, is short with most of there  weight in there body area. the terrier is alot diff style of dog  still not big in size but the body style is alot diff.. but this little but kinda of funny for what it is mixed with  still will make you a good little pal - be a good care giver and youll be fine     good luck  with your  new buddy|`|1XLZdOcQaa	Reason your Basset Hound  have long legs is because it's not a purebred basset hound. give this, he might have got his legs from his father. <br>  <br>  Since you cant attach any photo for checking, here's a link that you can try checking to find all dog breeds to validate the features of your dog. good luck!<br>  <a href="http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/sr0.html" rel="nofollow">http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/sr0.html</a>|`|637af0df73292f4d1c8ec85214c9a369aa	When two different breeds of dogs are bred together the puppies will receive traits from both parents in a random fashion.  Mixed breed puppies in the same litter can have vast differences and look completely different from one another.  <br>  <br>  It is very likely that the bulk of traits you are able to see in your puppy came from the basset hound mother which is why your puppy looks so much like one.  However, it could be the trait which controls leg height she gets from her father. <br>  <br>  The other possibility is that mom was a poorly bred Basset Hound which resulted in mom having longer legs than the standard calls for.  In this case it is also possible that the puppy developed the leg height trait from mom which happened to be for longer legs.<br>  <br>  I know the above is kind of confusing.  Dogs are such a diverse species and when you start getting into their genetics there are many variables.<br>  <br>  I'm sure, mixed or not, your puppy is sweetheart and a great companion to you which is what really counts.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|p7swtBYzaa	No pictures here.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, I have gotten several foster dachshunds with longer legs than normal, shorter muzzles and ears, and tails going up, not straight out.<br>  Obviously your dog is either badly bred (back yard breeders don't give a damn what they breed) or there's a mix in there via daddy dog.<br>  <br>  I'm sure it doesn't matter at all if you love your Molly, the long legged beasties I've fostered, and adopted out, were wonderful dogs and are much loved by their Forever Families.   If you are not going to show your dog - and you can't with no AKC registration, what does it matter that you have a very "unique" looking basset?   <br>  I'm sure she's adorable and gets around a lot faster with slightly longer legs, the dachsies I mentioned could jump like no other dachsie, gave them a definite advantage on couch position.
JFuVm9k5aa	i would say no only because of his age, you cannot really progress on him. he is past his peak and although he would be great to keanr little things on and build your confidence...a "companion" or "trail horse" is not what an intermediate rider who likes to do barrels would want. <br>  <br>  a companion/trail horse usua,ly means it is not sound for other types of riding even fat work. 18 isnt THAT old but it is up there and if not kept in condition probably wont be able to compete or barrel race ever again....if even keep a consistant flat work routine.<br>  <br>  he is very cute and im sure would be great for a companion/trail horse but not what your looking for.<br>  <br>  <br>  go for something about 8-10 so it is well mannered and knows its job but still young enough to do more challenging jobs that a young rider would want to do. rescue a TB even but mnake sure you have a trainer so you can find a quiet one and that way you have someone who can help you train it.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Yes, I think so!  His age makes him an ideal candidate for a learner.  He's not spooky, so he would probably be good for you.  The fact that he does English and Western is good because you can switch if you ever feel like it.<br>  <br>  He's cheap, cute, and he has solid conformation.  Yes, he's a bit old but he could easily keep going strong for ten more years.  Just get a vet check to make sure he has no age-related issues, and take him on trial first.  He seems too good to be true to me!<br>  <br>  Some other posters are saying the age is a problem... but honestly it's not!  He's well broke and you can have a lot of fun with him.  He's got at least seven or eight years of riding left in him.|`|WxACyBbgaa	Sounds good it just sounds a bit too old. But your the one buying, just make sure you are going to be satisfied. Good Luck|`|GsnchSsmaa	It says his temperment is a 5 and that he is stubborn and spunky so you would need to be confident and to at least have enought ability to work with him. I dont think he is a beginners horse but you say your an intermediate so you shouls be fine. Just ask yourself if you would be able to control him and if you would get back on if he threw you or something.|`|8OJZYB3Taa	I would say no, due to the fact that he is 18 years old. he is a gorgous horse though. I would look for a good solids broke horse that is between the ages of 5 and 15.|`|H2gwQac6aa	it says he is stubborn and spunky? could you deal with this?<br>  he is 18 not exactly in the prime of his life, shouldnt you be looking for something a little younger?<br>  have you been to see and ride him yet? if not you will not know your self weather its the right horse for you, it took me 3 months to find the right horse for me, but once you sit on and ride you know whats right and whats wrong.<br>  take this as friendly advice, dont rush into anything, and never never ever be afraid to ask the seller anything, ask as much as you like weather they like it or not because at the end of the day its you thats going to be stuck with it not them hope this helps you :)<br>  btw, i would reccomend a vetinary assesment on the horse just to be sure theres no hidden illnesses that you should be knowing abotu :)|`|6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	He seems like a real cute horse. The only thing is that you really need to have confidence - this horse isn't going to be push-button. He's stubborn and spunky. If you're looking for a challenge and are completely confident (even if you're still learning, you can still be confident!) then I'd visit him and see if you guys have the "connection" or whatever. :)|`|wxFK2IpAaa	I would say maybe not since they say he is spunky he might be really up ( fast in a way) but that depends on your skill. (how much have you ridden. walk trot canter jump?Also I would recommend buying a horse you know instead of offline because they listing might not be acurate and they might also have a different perspective on the 1-10 scale.|`|ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	he looks healthy and cute.  i would be cautious about himthough .they say "companion/trail suitable" which to me means he has a physical issue which limits his usefulness.  at 400$ the owner is being honest with you.  also...the "stubborn streak" can really turna "happily ever after"scenerio into a real bummer.<br>  there are tons of horses for sale in md, and even give aways to the right home.  i would keep looking....|`|n2dUmfcQaa	His temperament is a 5, and it say that he is spunky, if you can handle him. he looks great, has a great price, the only thing i can say is look at him, try him out and see if he is what you wanted!|`|m1TQuVkmaa	i think he would be fine with you. just make sure you have the vet check him out before you buy him. it would also be a good idea to ride him a couple times. maybe take him on a trial to see how it works out.|`|nuc5DBD8aa	He seems a nice horse, but out of 10 he is a 5 on high spirit-ness which might not be so good for a first horse.|`|1WkO82e2aa	I would think he is worth looking at but you need to ride and work with him to see if you can handle him. There are different levels of "Spunky". If you have never ridden one that was on the verge of breaking loose and been able to stay in control, then I would be a little wary. It is a horse that would last you for years, 18 is not as old as it used to be. I have a 20 year old that LOVES to go wide open. I also have a horse that is slow as molasses. It depends on my mood as to which one I ride. On the days I feel like I would get aggravated trying to slow my horse down long enough to enjoy the ride, I take the other horse. Just go look at him and ride to see if you enjoy him.|`|oemHtmDsaa	He looks and sounds like a fun horse but he is very old and will probably have to retire in a couple years. You wouldn't be able to do much more with him then trail riding and he looks like a better companion then a riding horse. But if you go very easy on him and just want a friend then go ahead. But you may not have much fun with him riding wise because like I said he is pretty old (18 years!) and for a intermediate rider you may want a horse about the ages of 5-11 ish! Have fun! Ps. You will know when you find the perfect horse!
9kceDOTraa	It's hard to say what you can do about them when you aren't telling us what you have, and if you don't know what you have, that's putting you behind the 8 ball already.  When it comes to fish keeping, you should not buy fish that you do not know what they are and how to care for them.  Keep in mind the word "cichlid" doesn't tell anyone anything at all, because they come from all different parts of the world, and they aren't all the same, like say a Puma and a Cheetah are both cats, but don't look nor act alike.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you do have typical commonly pet store sold Malawi Mbuna, but who knows.  Some pictures would help, along with what your water chemistry looks like.  That 15 gallon if they are the ones I think, is not a proper suited tank to house these fish in.  They will be young adults within about six months or so, and if they are both male, the situation is only going to get worse.  Males in Africans do not tolerate other males very well, especially in a tiny cramped tank like that.<br>  <br>  As far as the food goes, it's not something to worry about at this point.  The species, if they are the Electric Blue and Yellow are mouth brooders, and the females of this species go without food when holding a brood for almost 3 weeks.  Fish almost rarely ever starve to death, nor do they need or use food the same way we do.  They don't need an internal heat source.  It sounds like your problem is a matter of 2 males in a tank too small.  The rock and wood will only help temporarily, as they age, nothing short of a divider in the tank is going to prevent aggression among them.  <br>  <br>  I'm not worried about the size they are now.  Just as a baby, they aren't going to stay that size forever.  When you buy a species of fish, you should buy it with  some consideration to the final adult sizes as well as the growth rates.  Since these appear to both be male, you shouldn't try keeping African Mbuna, multiple species like this, in under 40 gallons.  Either put them in seperate tanks, or get a divider.<br>  <br>  The addition of rocks or wood will work as a temporary solution.  What happens much as with water changes, if you do gravel vacuuming, when you put the decor back in, you change up the structure and boundries, and this resets aggression, usually giving weaker fish types a chance to find a place to fit in.  The addition of new decor would help, but eventually, a stronger dominant male is going to work past this and the weaker will end up in the corner again at some point.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	What kind are they? yes your fish could die of stress. Sounds like you have African cichlids. They can be kept together but not just 2. You need 3 or more so not just one gets picked on. Your tank is not large enough to house theses fish.<br>  <br>  Some fish are just aggressive and there is nothing you can do about it. The cichlids from lake Malawi are aggressive but can live with others of the same kind and size.|`|IFEIP5Doaa	Simply seperate them. Africans are an aggressive species, and most growing to 4+" or more, a 15 gallon really is not large enough for the two of them. If you cant afford a larger tank now (I would suggest a 20-30 gallon for them), put a tank divider in the middle of the tank so that the other is not as bullied around. Which this will work also if you get a 20 long which will be large enough for the two of tem, with a tank divider in the middle of the tank, so each as 10 gallons worth os space.|`|RpYJ2mjlaa	I would definitely suggest separating them, especially if the yellow is a yellow lab. Yellow labs are not as aggressive as other cichlids. I have a blue one, that started out as the tiniest. One by one, ate every other cichlid (6 of them) in the 55 gallon tank, including larger fish. I tried EVERYTHING and nothing worked. Now I'm down to just him.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Cichlids love rocky hiding places. You apparently have a strong dominate fish in the blue. Put some more caves and holes the yellow can hid in...not plants. In a rocky hole or cave, the yellow can defend himself better. If this continues and then yellow looks endangered, you might have to remove him to a nother tank.|`|KAX0HCfTaa	Don't  worry, your fish will be fine.  Just make sure you have a lot of obstacles,  Define boarders like build a short wall in the middle of the tank with rocks.  That will act as a marker so that they don't cross territory boundaries.  <br>  <br>  You can temporarily slide in a piece of glass so that they can establish boundaries.<br>  <br>  You can make caves on the far ends of the tank so they can have holes to hide in during this training.<br>  <br>  Your fish will eventually respect the established areas.  Just watch their behavior and remove the divider when it seems okay but not too soon, okay<br>  <br>  Have fun fish keeping!

AA11902187	Buy another hamster! Or "Do it Yourself" and make a way to connect the tubes. Somehow you can use a drill and drill a hole then shove some PVC piping through it... that would work!!!|`|hXUszU6Xaa	Do you have one hamster or two? If you have more then one, you could save the extra cage for quarantine or separation. If one hamster gets sick, you could keep him (or her!) in the old cage until they get better so the illness doesn't spread. Or if your little furry friends get into a squabble, you could separate them until they learn to behave!<br>  <br>  Good luck!
niztxto9aa	I have several bp's. What I do is I let them do as much as they're going to do on their own and then put them in room temp water for about 10 minutes. After they are nice and soaked I take them out and with a rag I slide it down their bodies and the extra shed comes off easily. Slide down the rag repeatedly until all the shed is gone. The head is a little difficult but you can take that off with your fingers easily when wet.|`|9qn74wi0aa	1st try to just rub/peel it off first. If it feels stuck and does not come off easily ( if you really have to pull  hard STOP this could hurt him) then soak him warm water (not too hot OR too cold try to get it as close to his tank temp as you can, a few degrees higher is OK but mot too much more) then rub gently with your hands. It should come right off after soaking, If not it may not be ready yet, just wait a day or so and try again. <br>  Also make sure you have something in his cage HE can use to rub it off (large rocks, branches) that is what they do in nature so if you have rocks or branches in his tank he will probably do it all himself|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	Do not try to pull the pieces off yourself. Just provide a humid hide for the next shed, it would be ideal too if he had branches or a "rougher" hide to rub against.. Give him a bath in warm water for about 15-30 minutes. This will help a lot. Too little humidity is largely responsible for bad sheds. You should keep the humidity levels at about 60% during shed. This can be achieved by misting the tank, placing a damp towel above the tank and making sure he always has a nice fresh bowl of water.<br>  <br>  Good luck for the next time!
AA11026827	It's within one week from when the lactation starts.  When she stops eating, that's a good clue too.  If her temp is that low already, then it will be any time now (it's within 12 hours of the temp dropping below 100f).  Good luck, make sure you have the vet on call in case issues arise.<br>  <br>  The bubble is actually the start of labor, so she's already starting, just reread and saw that.|`|YnWwcUPTaa	gestation is 63 days start taking  her temperature twice daily when it drops she should whelp approximately 12 hours after the drop.|`|yXUS7jz5aa	Shes probably a few days away.
JgC9a8m2aa	Fur - No two ferrets will ever feel exactly the same. I have seven, all on the same diet, and they all feel a little bit different. Some of them have very long fur, while a couple have a very short fur, and then there's a couple in between that. They all feel soft, but it's a different kind of softness - it's hard to explain, some have a fluffy, cotton-like softness, while the others have a not so fluffy, but still soft feel. LOL, does that make any sense? Their winter coats tend to be longer and thicker than their summer coats (but I think my fert's with the shorter fur are a bit confused about what season it is). A healthy ferret should have a soft, full coat. If it's very dry and coarse and/or there are any bald patches, then there could be a health or diet problem.<br>  <br>  Smell - I've heard popcorn, grape soda, corn chips, doritos, and I don't know what all else. Truth is, they just smell like a ferret. =) They have their own unique smell. It's kind of earthy, natural and some say musky. If they're cared for properly, then the smell shouldn't be that bad (except for whole, in season males), but some people are really sensitive to their scent and think they smell "horrible" (even the best kept ferret). Then there are those, like me, that like their natural scent, but I only notice it when I stick them right under my nose.|`|iuYtcX6Xaa	depends on how well bred it is, if you but it from a pet store it is always coarse like a scotty dog. buy from a GOOD breeder if you are worried about softness|`|TrTfowAQaa	the coat is like that of a wire hair dog of some kind. you can wash them EVERYDAY & they will always have a smell like no other. the droppings have the worst smell of all. worse than cats. they are rather smart & can make good pets. I much like my pet female rats more than any other vermin. they keep themselves clean if you keep the Cage clean. they potty train come on command & make great travel pets. I have a carrying case that fits in my bag so I can take my girl in any place without being noticed or she will ride on my shoulder...|`|9qn74wi0aa	A ferrets coat depends NOT only on breeding but more on DIET!<br>  Feed a ferret a crappy/wrong diet and it fur is coarse. Feed a ferret a good High protein, high fat diet with NO veggies, NO fruit, NO sugar & NO carbs and their coats are soft and smooth (almost like bunny fur) but more hair like. Ferrets are obligate carnivores (which means they CAN NOT digest anything other than meat, they lack a cecum the organ that digests plant material)<br>  The Smell also depends upon DIET and how much you clean their cage. Good diet + Daily litter change (the stuff he poops in)+ weekly changing of bedding (the stuff he sleeps in, ex. towels, old t-shirts, blankets) little to no smell at all. <br>  The smell is a musky smell when properly kept and maintained you can only really smell them if you are right up to them (you have to put your nose up to my ferrets fur before you smell him) and it is NOT a horrible smell, wet dog, or a cat litter box is much worse than a properly cared for and healthy ferret. A musky smell is not a bad smell some peolpe use musk cologne, musk oils, ect. Some people really like the way a ferret smells. I don't like or dislike it, it is just their smell, I've heard some people describe the smell by saying the ferrets head smells like corn chips and their butts smell like grape soda. Don't agree with that 100% but I get the idea<br>  Washing a ferret often does NOT make the smell go away it actually has the opposite effect, as the glands that produce an oil (this oil keeps the skin and fur soft and shinny) have to work overtime to replace the oils lost in the bath so the smell actually gets worse when you wash them too much|`|9b3d00525945c090a16f791aa6c509ddaa	IF THEY ARE SHEDDING THEIR COAT IT WILL FEEL RUFF AND IF THEY ARE NT HEALTHY IT WILL FEEL RUFF BUT IF FED RIGHT IT WILL BE SOFT AFTER SHEDDING AND BATHING ONLY WHEN THEY NEED IT IF CAGE IS KEPT CLEAN AND EARS TO THEY WONT SMELL
C1eHfhrHaa	Look at the parents and talk to the breeder about the lines.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	When he it is around 2 than you will know. Larger breeds put on about 10 pounds each month|`|tKBWZ7mCaa	You can't know for sure, the only way to be positive is to wait and see.  It can take up to 3 years for a Mastiff to reach their final weight.  You can get a good idea from looking at the mother and father, and their parents as well.  The breeder should be able to tell you if your Mastiff has a build more like the mom or dad, which will tell you which family history to look at.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	You can't. <br>  <br>  Looking at the dog's relatives can be a good indicator. How much did Dad weigh? How much did Mom weigh? How about Mom's siblings? How about Dad's siblings? How about the grandparents. If the puppy's family is typically over 170 pounds, chances are, your puppy will weigh a similar amount. If Mom was 130 and Dad was 210, the puppy could be 110 or 190, who knows? <br>  <br>  While the lineage can help you guess, it's no guarantee, though. Two parents over 180 can easily produce offspring who, for whatever reason, stay around 150. A petite dam can produce a 230-pound monster. An average sire can produce a 140-pound dog, or a 200-pound dog. Anything is technically possible. The family's genes do play a role, but they don't decide everything. However large the puppy will grow is up to *his* genes.<br>  <br>  In case you're curious, here are a few weight charts you can consult. You must NOT pay too much attention to them, they're just guides from others' experiences. Your EM is fine whatever size he is.<br>  <a href="http://www.mastiffonlinecommunity.net/viewtopic.php?t=8291" rel="nofollow">http://www.mastiffonlinecommunity.net/vi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mastiffonlinecommunity.net/viewtopic.php?t=30" rel="nofollow">http://www.mastiffonlinecommunity.net/vi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mastiffonlinecommunity.net/viewtopic.php?t=99" rel="nofollow">http://www.mastiffonlinecommunity.net/vi...</a><br>  <br>  Remember that giant dogs mature slowly.

Large saggy nipples can be from having many litters of puppies.  If you are wanting to find out right away take her to a vet and have them ultrasound her.  Then you will know for sure otherwise just kind of hang loose and see if she gets bigger and milk starts to form in the nipples.  Good Luck!|`|L22hVXTIaa	If her nipples only just began to sag (weren't sagging when you got her) then it sounds as though she's pregnant.

oDVx7nSxaa	Unless he's got papers, it's impossible to tell.  The white feet themselves don't indicate that he's a mix.  While the white feet are considered a serious breeding fault (cosmetic only!), it doesn't mean he's not pure Siamese.  However, a mix can look exactly like a purebred.  Genetics are a strange thing sometimes.  <br>  <br>  While it's a fault in the show ring, I personally like the look of the white feet against the dark points :o)|`|RN1wGlWWaa	No.  Unless you have papers to prove its a Snowshoe (which is a purebred - Siamese markings and white on the face and feet), then its just a domestic shorthair that happens to be pointed and has white feet.|`|qWyVss7Zaa	The pointed pattern[1] is a form of partial albinism, resulting from a mutation in tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in melanin production. The mutated enzyme is heat-sensitive; it fails to work at normal body temperatures, but becomes active in cooler areas of the skin.[10] This results in dark colouration in the coolest parts of the cat's body, including the extremities and the face, which is cooled by the passage of air through the sinuses. All Siamese kittens, although pure cream or white at birth, develop visible points in the first few months of life in colder parts of their body. By the time a kitten is four weeks old the points should be clearly distinguishable enough to recognise which colour they are. Siamese cats tend to darken with age, and generally adult Siamese living in warm climates have lighter coats than those in cool climates. Originally the vast majority of Siamese had seal (extremely dark brown, almost black) points, but occasionally Siamese were born with blue (a cool grey) points, genetically a dilution of seal point; chocolate (lighter brown) points, a genetic variation of seal point; or lilac (pale warm gray) points, genetically a diluted chocolate. These colours were at first considered "inferior" seal points, and were not qualified for showing or breeding|`|4aAhEK9daa	It means he's a cat with pointed markings - that's all.  Without papers it's not likely he's any breed - just like over 97% of the cats on this entire planet.  <a href="http://life.familyeducation.com/cats/pets/45684.html" rel="nofollow">http://life.familyeducation.com/cats/pet...</a>|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	I have a kitten I adopted this summer.

The larger cat seems slightly aggressive and is moving his body strangely, which leads me to think this is not a mother-baby situation, but a sexual one. And if both cats are male, trust me...cats can get confused. I've seen cats try to have sex with everything.|`|d0133f3fa1f02f4ead77c1ea5ab2a3fcaa	They are having sex. Seriously!

qlCHegC5aa	Okie doke.<br>  <br>  First. Don't panic.<br>  I managed to hide a total of 16  cats (though they were indoor/outdoor).<br>  And the manager hated cats.<br>  It was kinda my hobby to help strays.<br>  Still is.<br>  <br>  So, you have to put anything that might point to you having a cat (litter boxes, litter, cat food, cat brushes, etc..) in the trunk of your car, or at a friends house. even if you get rid of the cats for the day, it'd be really stupid to leave that stuff around.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure you vacuum the carpets for any hair, bleach anything that smells like them (though cats don't smell much, and they probably won't be looking for it. Inspections are meant to find things wrong with the apartment). <br>  <br>  Do you have a friend who'll take them? Depending on the number of cats, a really close friend/family member could pet sit them. Offer to pay. And offer a cookie; they make it all worthwhile.<br>  <br>  You could leave for the day with the cats, putting them in a cat box or something and going for a drive. Make sure they don't get out. Really make sure they don't get out.<br>  <br>  Book the day at a Kennel. It might cost ya.<br>  <br>  If you need more time, see if you can reschedule. <br>  <br>  Remember though. You have an entire week.<br>  I usually had five minutes to shove them out the window.<br>  <br>  xD|`|cY8DgJv5aa	You're in big trouble buddy.  Be prepared to either be forced to get rid of your cats and/or be evicted from your apartment for breaking the lease agreement.  Even if you hide them, they'll still meow and you'll still be able to smell that you have animals in the apartment.|`|4cfuzx0Iaa	If you have a car you have to be kind of risky for some cats because they can spray but I shove them in my car with my animals and it works out perfectly . =p|`|360c66240ece2cffefc507bfa04c3addaa	Find a friend that can take them in for a few days.|`|0jLj7yJpaa	I have no personal experience with this, but I think I might have some tips. First of all, make sure the cat is somewhere else during the inspection. Ask a friend to take care of him/her for a day. Next, you want to get rid of the evidence. I suggest throwing the litter box away and getting a new one after the inspection. Hide all toys/cat paraphernalia in a closet. If you have a cat condo, hide it the best you can in a closet or another place where they won't look. Smells must be hidden too. Spray tons of stuff all over the place to ensure the cat smell is completely gone. That should do it. Oh, and don't forget the water and food bowls!|`|ZXukJVhqaa	If you don't have friend or family member that could take them for the day, I would take the cats to a boarding kennel.  There ones here have day rates and your cats (I believe only 2) can be put together.  I would also put all cat items in a box in the closet or somewhere outside the apartment. Then clean, clean, clean. Be sure to dust, vacuum, and clean fur off of beds and furniture.  Unless your cats have pee and someone can smell it or damage to your place that looks like animal damage, I think you will be fine.  In my experience, the inspections that are done are so quick that I doubt they will be in your place very long.|`|Cu9DU88Paa	ok CHILL man!! I have had cats even though im not supposed to in a town home before! So listen up, give them to a friend, but if that doesn't work out, then hide them somewhere, if that is too hard, then you are going to have to stay with the inspection people, and follow them in every room and <br>  keep hiding the kitty's! Well' that's what me and my mom and dad, and sister did, so good luck!|`|3O6CTb3saa	Boy that's a hard one as it might be found out eventually and then you will get evicted.  Is there anywhere you're cat can stay at your friends or neighbors?  Clean your house really well so no cat odor or litter smell etc.   Man i can't believe i'm telling you all this but i want to help.  It's so hard when you want animals and can't have them.  My son can't have his mini-schnauzer so i am keeping it for him.  Last resort do you have a good friend who would take the kitty and lives close so you could go visit it all the time?  Good Luck!|`|TjXU0VV0aa	Ive got it!   Put your cat in your gym bag or .. cat carrier or ..whatever you brought it home in lol ... put 'em in your car and take a ride man!  Cats dont tend to LOVE the car .. but its better than getting kicked out of your apt!  :)     Of course you dont want to just leave them in the car .. thats cruel and not too safe .. but .. you can ride around with them.  Hand out with some friends for a few hours. I mean .. even someone who cant keep your cat overnight or .. for a long time .. could probably be cool with having the cat in its carrier or just hanging out for a few hours. <br>  Hope that helps!  Good luck !!  :)|`|vg2xABZjaa	if the person doing inspect has no pets they will smell them.

Just call a family member like grandma and ask her to keep the cats for a day or so. Your problem is going to be hiding the smell of cats. You will have to shampoo all carpets, fabreeze furniture and beds, mop with pine sol. You should also vaccum furniture to get kitty hair off. And keep the litter box out of the house for at least 24 hours. <br>  <br>  Use the time without the cats in the home like an early spring cleaning. To get all trances of "cat" out you will need to deep clean the house.<br>  <br>  Oh and don't forget to hide the food bowl, water bowl, cat food, and cat toys.|`|q0vKbocHaa	do you have a friend that doesn't live in the building?

IuYekkPVaa	Cats are creatures of habit and I think some of them just have these little quirks.  <br>  <br>  I've got two cats, and though I put two separate dishes down at the same time, the female will only eat out of the dish on the left.  If the male cat pushes in and starts eating from the left-hand dish, she won't attempt to eat from the other one.  She's more feisty than he is and so sometimes she'll even smack him to make him go and eat out of the other dish.  Even when we moved house this habit has continued.|`|qlCHegC5aa	Could have a different smell?<br>  They're really sensitive to that.<br>  <br>  And maybe there's a slightly different portion amount.|`|6ff1c5d8716046ac371e8a5ddb670780aa	The short answer is "because they're cats".

AxENuJahaa	What food are you feeding?  If you mix it a bit thinner, it will help Little Darlin to digest what is in the crop faster.  There really is no set times for feeding.  If you mix the formula a bit thicker, it will take longer to move through.  Generally, the younger the bird, the thinner you want the formula.  Instead of using a crop bra, try feeding a bit less.  The "right amount" of food varies from bird to bird, even in the same clutch.  Feed only enough to fill the crop, not so much that the crop is too full for the bird to lift.  Feed less at a time and watch to see how fast or slow the crop empties.  Once it is empty, feed again.  You can try different consistency food to see how long it takes.  That way, you can mix a bit of thicker formula for the last feeding of the night so there will be enough food in the crop to keep the chick happy all night, but still have the crop empty for the morning feeding.  I like Kaytee Exact Handfeeding Formula.  It is very easy to mix up a little at a time and you can mix it to whatever consistency you need.|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	I was going to answer this but I can't improve Gremlin's answer.

2eJcaeOPaa	when he bites you can grab his scruff.<br>  what worked with my jack russell was when he bit i put my finger in his throat he soon learnt that biting was not a fun activity.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	The entire point of yelping is that you must then stop interacting with the dog. The second he bites, you yelp -- and LEAVE. Immediately stand up and storm out. The dog gets absolutely no attention for at least several minutes. (With young puppies, it's a few minutes. You can ignore him for longer as he's older and has a longer attention span.) You're his chew toy. But if he bites you, you remove yourself, then he gets nothing. No chew toy, no playmate, no playing, no affection, no attention. When you return to the room, do so quietly. Greet the dog, but do not engage in any play or cuddling or anything. If he behaves himself well, you can pet him and play with him. He only gets attention if he is going to use his manners.<br>  <br>  If you see him going for your hand, make a sharp noise like AH-AHT! It should be a new noise, not one that he's so used to that he ignores. This is simply to distract the dog, as you said, for a second. THIS is when you swoop in to prevent the behavior in the first place! In that moment of hesitation, stuff a toy in the dog's face as a proper alternative to chew on. He should have plenty of toys (soft, rubber, rope, whatever) around for this purpose. <br>  <br>  Make sure he's adequately exercised. "A tired dog is a good dog." Terriers have a ridiculous amount of energy, so do something to thoroughly drain it daily. Also, tire him out mentally. Have several short, fun training sessions every day to work his mind and teach him whatever tricks you want.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Also, remember that this isn't going to be fixed overnight. It will take a long time of consistency because he's so firmly rooted in the habit of biting you. He may also go through an extinction burst of the behavior.<br>  See the section on extinction bursts in this article for a really good explanation of what they are: <a href="http://k9deb.com/nilif.htm" rel="nofollow">http://k9deb.com/nilif.htm</a>|`|mGoDU2Fvaa	We had the same problem with our Jack Russel. They have such a strong personality that we treated him like one of our children and when he would growl or bite at us we would put him in his kennel for a little while as time out.

He loves his kennel and when he shows bad behavior we typically try to distract him from whatever it is that is causing it or he goes in time out.

Best thing to do is call your vet and ask for advice.|`|AQ3sgTZFaa	take him to the vet, thats what hes for, why would we know what to do, its a stupid question to ask|`|BHKlCJR2aa	hes sick, call an out of hours vet.|`|84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	the exact same thing happened to my dog. I called my vet immediately. They told me to keep food from her for 24 hours and water for 12 hours so her stomach can calm down. (other than humans who should drink a lot when they vomit, it makes it worse for dogs to drink a lot) They told me if it doesn't get better to bring her in the next day. I followed my vet's direction and my dog was fine. I took her to the vet the next day just to make sure. But until you're able to take your dog to the vet this is what you can do until then. <br>  And don't forget to comfort him and give him lots of love!! :o)<br>  Hope he'll feel better!!|`|1c9bb9b0490977041030a1689485e446aa	You have to have a 24 hour vet in your area,this is something that cant wait,if you have a vet...CALL HIM or find a 24 hour vet....something is wrong|`|nvmjQ9tPaa	well dogs get poorly just like us it might be nothing just an upset stomach dont worry about it but if it gets worse or persists then call the vet
Rw7gi86Naa	There are so many possible reasons for a cat to stop using the litter box that it's hard to cover them all. The first reason you need to rule out is a bladder/urinary tract infection, or constipation. You will need to take kitty to the vet to get checked out. Has the litter box been cleaned properly? Have you moved it to a different location? Have you recently changed anything such as brand of litter, litter box or food? Have you used any new disinfectants in the box? Has someone new come into your house that s/he didn't seem to like? Any new pets? Even new carpets or furniture can cause this. <br>  <br>  Here are some suggestions to your litter box problems:<br>  - Provide a box for each cat <br>  - Provide constant access to a box <br>  - Go back to previously used brand of litter and/or <br>  - Discontinue new disinfectant <br>  - Move box to where it was previously used <br>  - Eliminate new or frightening noise near litter box <br>  - Move food and water away from litter box <br>  - If cat is only going in one spot, put the litter box at the exact location and gradually move it back to where you want it at the rate of one foot per day <br>  - If there are several places, try putting dishes of cat food in those areas to discourage further elimination there <br>  - Experiment with different textures of litter, (cats prefer sandy litter) <br>  - Use a covered litter box for cats that stand in box but eliminate outside of it <br>  - Keep in mind that some cats are rather picky, and prefer to have two separate boxes, (one to pee in and one to poop in).<br>  <br>  Problems arise when your cat doesn't like or develops an aversion to the litter box that you have provided. There is absolutely no reason to expect every cat to like the same material, or even for one cat to prefer the same material over an entire life span. If your cat is having litter box problems then you will need to figure out how to make the litter box appealing to the cat. Here are a few options: <br>  1) Pain or illness can cause a cat to stop using the litter box. Cats are very adept at hiding illness, so if your cat is having litter box problems then the first thing you need to do is take the cat to a vet for a medical exam. <br>  2) If you aren't scooping the waste out of the litter every day then you need to start and start now. <br>  3) Perfumes or other odors can drive your cat away from the litter box. Scented litters are unacceptable to many cats, and the leftover scent from a cleaning product could also be a problem. Get rid of the perfumes, and scrub those cleaners away before giving the box back to the cat. Remember that cats have an acute sense of smell. <br>  4) Your cat may feel vulnerable when in the litter box. Is it in a noisy location, (such as next to the washing machine). Is it secure from little marauders like dogs and children, or even other cats? If the box is not semi-private, move it to a better location.<br>  5) Remember those preferences that we talked about earlier. You may need to offer several different types of litter before finding the right one. Strange but true, some cats will not use the same box for urine and feces, in which case you'll have to provide two boxes. The type of box could also be a problem. If the box has a cover, try removing it. <br>  6) Anxiety can lead to litter box lapses. Did some event scare your cat? This could be anything from a new couch to a new cat or even a new person in the house. If you suspect anxiety, confine the cat to a safe and secure place, (maybe a bed room) until the anxiety has passed. Cats seem to hang on to their emotions, so the anxiety could last much longer than the actual event. No need to rush, leave that safe haven available to the cat for as long as possible. <br>  7) If you have multiple cats, chances are you'll need multiple boxes, maybe even with different materials in them. <br>  There is one more important distinction that you'll need to make. Is the cat refusing to use the litter box, or is the cat spraying? Spraying is a territorial behavior and has nothing to do with disliking the box. For more information on litter box problems or spraying, consult with a trained behaviorist.<br>  <br>  Correcting the Problem <br>  The key to solving elimination problems is to make the litter box more attractive, and the area where the cat is soiling instead, unattractive. Sometimes, just cleaning the litter box more frequently or changing its location will correct the problem. Other times, you may need to experiment with different combinations of location and kitty litter to find a solution. You may even want to offer your cat the choice of several different boxes, each with different kinds of litter, to see which he or she prefers. At the same time, you must break the cat's habit of soiling in the new location. Be sure to clean the soiled area thoroughly with a pet odor remover to get rid of any urine scent -- or your cat may be attracted back to the same spot. It's important to keep the cat away from the area. Try covering the spot with carpet runner, prickly side up, or|`|D4N2btkvaa	Clean the area thoroughly, but make sure to use absolutely no ammonia. To a cat that has the same smell as urine, and they will pee there.  Also keep the stress level as low as possible.  Add an extra litter bo, some cats will not pee in a litter box with another cat, even if that cat has lived there a while.  You should have at least one litter box per cat, and an extra, also keep the litterboxes immaculately clean.   He may also feel very safe in that spot, or it may be less loud.  Cats feel very vulnerable while in the litter box so why not put one in that corner that has a covered lid?  It is also extremely to get your cat checked out by a vet, because a lot of medical problems can actually cause this, and you need to rule them out before trying anything else. That may help.  I know from experience that this is a very annoying problem, I hope it is one that gets resolved.|`|UlOKMInqaa	There is a product called Feliway that is supposed to calm cats and stop unwanted behaviors like urinating outside of the litter box. I shadowed at a vet clinic over the summer and they sold/used this product. You can go to these websites for more information:

JfBzzXQ4aa	Why not just a verbal "AH, AH, AH, NO" firm, even tone of voice, & shake your finger at her while looking her stern in the eye. Then immediately give her something good to do, like a sit stay or down stay & then praise her & tell her she is a good dog, all in a business-like tone of voice.  Chihuahuas are smart. I'm thinking that would be enough correction for her to understand, without making her afraid & worried about the laundry basket jail routine. Identify & divert her from the undesirable behavior & show her a good behavior she can offer instead. Keeps you in charge, but very clearly helps her learn the good behaviors. Before you know it, she will offer more & more of the good behavior you have reinforced with her.|`|yCR6qg0baa	You're right, if you've spoiled your pet, her behavior problems are on you. She sounds like she'll need more than your leadership. Please sign her up for "puppy kindergarten" (dog training for puppies). <br>  <br>  You need to buy a crate as well. It's stupid & cruel to trap her under a laundry basket. You wonder why she's afraid? Ha. You need to crate train her. Buy a crate that is just big enough for her to lay down & turn around in, but not big enough to play. At night, take her out for a walk until she goes potty, then crate her up for the night. Ignore her wimpering & barking. Put her crate in a separate room with a closed door. First thing in the morning before you shower or anything, put on your shoes & coat, put her leash on her, and IMMEDIATELY take her for a walk. Don't stop inside the house for anything or she'll pee everywhere. Take her out for about 30 minutes, which will give her enough time to potty. Bring her back in & feed her. After 10 minutes, put up any uneaten food. She should be fed twice a day. Crate her for 30 minutes & then take her for another walk until she uses the bathroom. Then you can play with her all you want. In a day or two, she'll know to go to the front door when she has to use the bathroom. I got a 6 month old lab mix (un-house broken) and she was house trained in less than a week by crate training her. She won't potty in her crate b/c that's "her" space. She loves her crate. She loves taking naps in it without even being told to. This also provides her with structure, supervised play time, and good training.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	A LAUNDRY BASKET?!<br>  <br>  Jesus Christ, when you were a child did your parents put you in the dryer for being bad too?<br>  <br>  STOP putting her under a basket.

She will not know why you are doing this to her. Focus on a positive way to change behavior. What is she doing wrong? How can you show her the right way?|`|4sUqTjc8aa	start watching the Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan. <a href="http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/</a><br>  <br>  Exercise, Discipline, Affection- in that order.<br>  <br>  You should start your day off with a walk for at least 30 minutes. Draining your dogs energy solves a lot of problems. It isn't good enough to play with them or rely on a big back yard. Fish were made to swim, birds to fly, and dogs to walk. They must have a purpose. Walk your dog beside you and never in front of you. You have to establish yourself as Pack Leader (this is the dogs mentality and not a humans so you have to conform to there belief system).<br>  <br>  You must remain calm-assertive. Never angry, frustrated or anxious. With your hand shape like a claw, poke her on the shoulder-neck area. This is where dogs discipline dogs and your hand acts like a "bite". Poke her firm but not mean. If she persists, lay her on her side and hold her down with one hand on the head and neck area and the other on her butt. She might pitch a temper tantrum but as soon as she understands that you are the boss, she will calm down. Her ears will relax and the tension will leave her body. This too is what dogs do to show they are boss and you will earn her respect. She will come to know you as pack leader.<br>  <br>  Also, anytime you go outside for your walk, she must always be behind you. Pack leaders lead and she should never go ahead of you.<br>  <br>  Reprimand her as soon as she displays any attitude that is against your rules with the "bite" I spoke of at the top.<br>  <br>  Make her earn her meals even if it is just sit and stay. She should not get her food until you tell her it is okay. Pack leaders always eat first and then give permission and so should you.<br>  <br>  I also recommend an obedience class ASAP. Trainers will be able to guide you.  Remember, little dogs can control big dogs just with their attitude. Point is that it isn't the size, it is the energy they project. So you must access that energy and let her know you are boss, not her. Reprimand her for the cat chasing too. Sometimes I put my dog on a leash around the house if she gets too crazy. I make her walk around with me while I do dishes and laundry. This reinforces that I am boss!<br>  <br>  Also, if she chews on something you don't want her to, tell her no and replace it with one of her own toys. After a while, she will get the idea of what is okay to chew on.<br>  <br>  I guess Cesar Millan isn't popular? All the technigues above are used by the Dog Whisperer and my 3 dogs changed their behavior in 2 weeks. Very respectfull now.  Sorry you all think you know better.<br>  Good luck. sorry I was so long winded!|`|RqEwgDRdaa	10 minutes is too long.  And no more time outs.  Dogs don't understand this.  When you catch them in the act of doing something, a good Aaannhh! will get their attention, and then you redirect them.  Then really praise them once they are redirected.|`|OuI5eFcmaa	Train your dog.  Even training the basic commands teaches her who's boss and what it will take to please you. Time outs do not work for dogs, as i believe you have already figured out.|`|5vQE1mrzaa	I am the owner of a black lab terrier mix, and the best way to respond to your dog is to think in pack dynamics, not small children or human behavior control techniques. <br>  <br>  The reason the dog gets her way is because you've allowed the dog to take Alpha Status. A dog will allow you to control them if you show that you have authority. Now I'm not advocating using the basket, that sounds like a very bad tactic, but you do want to let the dog know that they have done something wrong.<br>  <br>  I actually use a different tone of voice for commands/negative feedback than I do for praise and conversation speak just so the dog can tell the difference between disciplined commands and when I'm congratulating her on a job well done. <br>  <br>  You also want to make sure the Dog can see what they did wrong. Such as when my dog has an accident I show her the accident, tell her bad dog in my disappointed vocal inflection and then let her out in the backyard while I clean it up.<br>  <br>  But yeah, pack dynamics are the key to a dog, not behavior modification like you might have learned in psychology class.<br>  <br>   If you wish to learn more about the way a dog's body language works, get a copy of The Readers Digest Illustrated Book of Dogs (or you could do a search and see if the information is online). It is a wonderful book that has sections on health and training techniques as well as a listing of typical traits for most major breeds. The pictures help to explain some of the more difficult subjects such as how to perform CPR on a dog etc.|`|7RUoBhV4aa	Ok not that bad. As long as your not hitting her it is all good. One of the most humane ways to train is use a spray bottle. Anytime your puppy does something undesirable spray her. Don't let her see you with the spray bottle though. You want her to make connection between the unpleasant sensation in her bad behavior. Never shout or raise your voice to her. Be a peppy as possible when talking to her and when scolding her use a lower even toned voice. Take her to puppy class or buy up puppy training books. Just no more time out. You want her to enjoy private quiet time not see it as a punishment it will only make her defensive (which looks like she is being agressive).|`|8aOTvtEUaa	Definately stop putting her under the laundry basket, but it seems you already know that. Dogs usually don't understand what they do wrong, Instead of punishing her, ignore her, it will drive her nuts. My dog hates not being the center of attention, just fold your arms and turn your back to her.<br>  I have a 12 week old puppy and if she has an accident in the house which she does many I just clean it up and say nothing to her because you only have a couples seconds after she pees till she forgets, when she goes outside i give her tons of praise and a treat soon she will get it.  <br>  <br>  You should get a clicker for clicker training, it's great, it makes a unique sound and when she does something good you immediately hit the button and follow that with a treat, it really works wonders. <br>  <br>  If you have access to cable watch "It's me or the dog" on animal planet, I am obsessed with this show and they have great techniques that will help you. It's usually on around 9 or 10am EST <br>  It's all about positive reinforcement, I know it's very hard not to spoil something so cute, but try to ease back a little it's better for them and you! Good Luck!|`|AA10627752	Having a dog is like having a child. It takes consistency. Each time she does something wrong you should take the same action every time. I agree that the basket isn't the best idea but I wouldn't go as far as saying it's abuse I mean it's not like you are drop kicking her across the room! With our dogs we find that newspaper works wonders! A rolled up newspaper either swatted on a table or a swat on the behind really works. It doesn't hurt them they just hate the sound of it and the feel of it. Don't treat her like a baseball I am just saying a swift little swat and that's all it takes. The crate can be helpful too. Our dog when ever she did anything wrong she would go to the kennel herself! Dogs aren't stupid but they don't have the thinking process of a human that's why consistency works with them. What ever you choose just be consistent. Good luck!|`|WQlCxeFlaa	Dint put her under the basket.. buy a gate..l.like the ones for kids. Make THAT her time out. When she misbehaves, put her in the gate and sit where she can see you. But dint look at her. Pay her no attention at all! No matter what she does. When she quiets down you can take her out. But every time she starts up, put her back. If she's being protective over someone and wont let you take it away, teach her "Trade" where you give her a toy, and when she goes after it, take whatever she was guarding. The easiest way to teach trade is with little lids with peanut butter. give her a small lid with some peanut butter and her lick it all up.. when you want to trade.. say "Trade" and give her another lid and take the first one. Your dog just needs proper training and she'll be fine|`|oUpWxGmSaa	It's very simple...stop treating her like a small person AND..dogs do not understand "time out."  They do not associate it with a behavior they've done.....only people understand that.  Dogs do not work that way.<br>  You need to really read "A member of the family" by Cesar Millan, watch "THe Dog Whisperer" frequently and get a trainer involved who is willing to come to your home.  Maybe the local humane society can steer you in the right direction.  <br>  The only reason the dog thinks she owns everything is because you let her believe that by treating her as though she is in charge.   And of course she is becoming afraid....she does not understand what you are doing.  <br>  Go to www.dogbreedinfo.com and click on any and all links to dog training and small dogs..etc., .  it's a good resource and will help you greatly, I hope.
74HBMPduaa	Try sitting to the outside of the turn.  Focus on staying over the center of his back.  Put a little extra weight in the outside stirrup.  This will help counter balance him and he will straighten up.  If he is rushing around try loosening your reins.  Most horses will slow down when they are cantering and you loosen your grip on their face.  So, loosen your reins and sit to the outside of your turns and he will slow down and be able to better balance around corners.|`|VvpnsdZraa	are you asking how to stop him from doing this??<br>  <br>  If so put inside leg and lift his inside rein.

You just might have to clean your filters a bit more often.<br>  <br>  I like the idea of using about 50 lbs of sand. Aquarium sand is best but hard to find and more expensive. I use play sand, but for the first week or two it has to settle and you will have to clean the filters regularly to get the sand out or else it will tear them up. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that most African Cichlids are Mbuna and really like rocks, so you might be better off with a gravel substrate, or else many caves. <br>  <br>  I will say one issue with sand is because it is so compact, it tends to breed anaerobic bacteria that can harm or kill fish. So do your best to keep the bottom layer oxygenated.|`|f8RBtCVAaa	well with sand its hard to clean so what u do is just put the siphon just a little over the Debra and pick it up with out sucking up that much sand. the rule for gravel is 1 pound of gravel for every gallon. but with sand sand is not as thick and over the years of cleaning it u will end up with less. but u mainly need about 50 pounds of sand maybe  a tad more. what i love about sand it makes your tank look more like u see it in the wiled.|`|qotUyyVhaa	if u go to the zoo...the bottom of the large fish tanks have barly and sand but instead are covered in large rocks and coral and what not!<br>  <br>  <br>  go like about 1 inch is fine and the rocks arnt everywhere there just like along the side with some coral in random spots but dont go overbord on the "decore"

He is so very right about the wealth of information that you can get from here. Please go and register and do some looking around and learning.<br>  Your temps are too low which you already know. Basking should be 100-110 degrees. Bearded dragons usually at that age do not poop every day. Some of mine only go once a week. Take into consideration that he is in a new environment and it might take him some time to adjust. Mine get off just by me changing their substrate and rearranging things a bit which I try not to move things too much as it does stress them out. Be sure you are dusting those crickets and super worms too with the calcium. Only one of my 5 will drink water from his dish. I mist everyone a couple of times a week and they all get a soak in nice warm water about once a week. Also the salad that you are giving him, mist it some and he will also get water from that. Mark your UVB light as to when you got it so you will know in 6 months that it must be changed.

He had transformed his backyard for growing plants & for the dogs. <br>  <br>  He bring him past every 4 -5 months so we can see him. and he looks great - he has more room to run around. The owner is a really good person - you can tell they have a good bond togther.<br>  <br>  The man tells us- what they do together - how he is been.<br>  He loves watching him play - Playstation together..<br>  So its good. <br>  <br>  So i just want you to know - there are really good people out there.<br>  <br>  God bless x do what is best|`|9NKoHyy8aa	You should, if you don't even have time to train him. A couple of ten minute training sessions a day is usually adequate for most dogs. So if you don't even have twenty minutes a day to devote to him, you should find him a new home. I suggest contacting a Wheaten Terrier Rescue group. They're very particular about who the dogs go to.|`|jvJqmliBaa	Kenneling him up is not the right answer...he has all this energy inside him that he wants to get out and run around..For a good dog they need to be exercised daily, then they behave because they've had there time..You should find it a good home with a nice big yard if you dont have the time for it|`|XXBKCt9xaa	Yes, i believe you should.<br>  Puppies need to be outside, and able to run and grow.<br>  For his sake, give him to someone who will love and care for him.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Yes. You owe it to him to get a home where he will be appreciated, loved, and trained.
SOxdyWQOaa	he likes your cat they could be friends may be shy to people he don't know sounds friendly most I can say is try it out take him in see what happens just keep an eye on him|`|3arJsZ91aa	I have a female cat which has three tom cats chasing her.  Tonight when I got home from work, one of them was in my house (mine refused to come in before I went to work, so had to leave a window open for her).  This particular tom cat is very friendly (to me, but runs away from neighbours), slightly on the skinny side and seems to pop in for the odd meal and a bit of a scratch on the head once in a while.  The last time he came, I gave him a flea and worm treatment, so know that at least as far as that goes, he is ok.  He has quite a wide territory and on odd occasions meets me at the front of my house (where my cat can't get to) and rubs himself around my legs and purrs - he just wants a bit of company.  The other two cats who visit are mostly just interested in any free meal they can get, but as I know they are owned (they have collars), I try to chase them away as often as possible.  I don't think that tom cats realise when a female is spayed, so just go after them anyway.  Mine has an annoying habit of fluttering her eyelashes and wiggling her bum at them and then wonders why they chase her.<br>  <br>  I expect that the cat coming to see you likes Noodles, but also realises that if he is quick, he can get a free meal.|`|0jLj7yJpaa	Some cats act like strays even when they aren't. Trust is a big deal in the cat world and especially if a cat has been abused in the past, they may have a wonderful relationship with their owners, but be wary of other humans. I've known a cat that comes over to eat my cat's food just because he prefers it, I think. He is friendly, but runs away the minute he sees you. Over the years, he's become a bit more friendly towards me and if I call him he will come over and say hello. I've also had cats that like to have other families to feed them. Cats are fickle creatures and don't always want to stay with one family or home. I can tell you to not be too friendly to this cat, because he might just decide to stay with you, and that would break his true owners' hearts.|`|srjPOxW7aa	Most likely your visitor is a homeless cat  that needs  a home. The cat runs away probably because it's either a feral cat or has been abused.<br>  but as long as you leave food out for it and it can get shelter in your garage, he or she should be fine :) and if you want to keep the kitty as yours then just e-mail me I could coach you on a few steps that may help you obtain that goal. hopefully your cat is fixed otherwise their could be kittens coming.
1WmDOPGtaa	This looks kind of fun... let's see:<br>  <br>  Raw feeding: good, if done correctly<br>  <br>  Kibble: see above answer.  Nothing wrong with a high quality kibble that your dogs do well on.<br>  <br>  Vaccination: Good.  (Over-vaccination: bad.  I'm big on titers)<br>  <br>  Responsible breeding: good.  (BYB or mills: obviously bad)<br>  <br>  Owning more than 10-20-30: I really can't pick that "maximum" number, but obviously at some point the dogs aren't getting the individual attention they deserve.  My personal preference is for a "small time" hobby breeder who only has a couple of dogs that are real pets in addition to competing and breeding.  But there are some very well known kennels that are far bigger than I prefer, and with my limited experience I am not comfortable labeling them as "bad."  They're just not for me.<br>  <br>  PETA and HSUS: just plain crazy<br>  <br>  Dominance training CM style: ineffective, over-rated, and often just plain dangerous.  Not to mention unnecessary at least 99% of the time.<br>  <br>  Dog shows: Good, and a fantastic place to learn.<br>  <br>  Hunting with dogs: Can't speak to the event you highlighted, I'm more involved in the "retriever" aspect of things.  I do not personally hunt, have never even held a gun, but I do go field training with my boy.  He has so much drive and is in utter heaven.  How can I deny him that?|`|OuI5eFcmaa	Raw feeding?

I don't happen to feed raw, but do occasionally give something raw for the dogs to knaw on.<br>  <br>  Kibble:  I feed kibble, I think it' depends on what your feeding, whether it's crap or a high quality food.  My dogs have always eaten kibble and they look great and are in great condition.<br>  <br>  Breeding:  I don't believe in breeding bans.   Like anything, there are people who do it right, who have the right goals and there will always be the irresponsible.  <br>  <br>  Vaccination:  I think are a necessary evil.  I don't believe in yearly vaccines and myself do the necessary vaccines for pups and young dogs, but when they mature I do titers.  In my state, the only vaccine required by law is Rabies and that can be done every 3 years.<br>  <br>  Owning more than 10 dogs:  I personally know people who handle it just fine.  My instructor owns 10 dogs, She always has a young dog up and coming, preparing for competition.   I know others who own 10 and also do it just fine.  Some people can't handle 1 dog.  I don't think I should be told how many pets I should be allowed to have.<br>  <br>  PETA, HSUS etc:  Their bad, their main objective is to end pet ownership.  <br>  <br>  Dominance training:  I think some dogs need it, not everything can be cookied.  <br>  <br>  Dog Shows:  I show my dog in breed, obedience, agility, field, earthdog, so obviously I have no problem with it.<br>  <br>  Hunting with dogs:  I hunt with my dogs.

3sB49YNnaa	The basics are the same.  The thing to remember about youngsters is that they are growing fast!  Because of that, they need plenty of nutrition.  That means 18% protein guinea pig pellets with stabilized vitamin C and no puffs seeds or other such stuff free fed, grass hay free fed, lots of fresh water and greens in moderation.<br>  <br>  Baby pigs are at the best age to socialize but they can be a bit skittish.  Don't let that stop you from handling them a lot.  You need to be gentle but handling them a lot is great.|`|MpVQE8tnaa	Forget the wheel guinea pigs wont use them--waste of money|`|TpAqxlbLaa	I have a rodent and I think that the best thing to do is to make sure that they have company and try to make some free time available to play with them outside there cage.|`|SwlJJaT5aa	Just like older guinea pigs, but more fragile, may be pickier.|`|0cEoyTrEaa	there kinda like older guinea pigs but they want more attention.<br>  and give them plenty of Vitamin C<br>  or they will die of scurvy (a loss of Vitamin C)|`|vDHjndrBaa	um i guess just dont squish them and always know where they are at all times, have them checked at the vet monthly and they should reamain in good shape. speaking of good shape you should also get a hamster wheel
3L6q1992aa	ok listen i have used it b4 what  u have to do is (i know this is going to sound wierd but it worked) ok so u have to boil the sand and let it cool then put it in the tank but the down fall is u have to clean it more than u wold if u used something else|`|dnqrBIcjaa	That' s a bad idea.|`|zqVDJxUIaa	Any sand is fine for an aquarium, as long as you BOIL it first! Boiling it will remove any harmful chemicals that may be in the sand. Make sure the sand is 100% pure sand, and not treated with chemicals, because chemical-treated sand will kill your fish.<br>  Good Luck!|`|AA10332192	It all depends on your definition of ordinary sand.<br>  <br>  What I call industrial sand from a warehouse store has a few varieties.  Ungraded industrial sand that has bits of metal, rock and chemicals from crushed concrete, etc.  That is a BAD idea.<br>  <br>  Playground sand.  Very rich in calcium carbonate.  OK for some marine systems and African cichlids, bad for everything else.<br>  <br>  Fine sand.  High in silicates.  Means LOTS of algae.<br>  <br>  In general, buy the more $$ aquarium sand that is treated, sealed and inert.  Its safer in the long run and won't leech into your tank.|`|epHk7Fb9aa	if you use sand instead of gravel the sand will get sucked up into the filter and you will have to replace the filter sooner (after a while costing more money) than you would with gravel. ive seen this happen before. good luck with your fish oh yeah make sure you add chemical no matter what u use if not they wil die quick trust me.|`|U2OAKAQaaa	Sand may be high in sodium. Your fish will not be happy. Use the appropriate gravel.|`|DQBvoMF1aa	No it can't work for you. Unless you want to kill you pets.
zqVDJxUIaa	Aquariums actually don't need gravel! Gravel is purely decorative (unless you have an undergravel filter). (Undergravel filters are not good). Fish actually do better off without it, because waste can get trapped in it, and will contribute to toxic ammonia and nitrite levels. However, if you use sand, you must BOIL it first, to sanitize it, because sand that comes from Walmart is most likely construction or other sand. If you have a good filter, you won't need gravel or sand. However, if you have plants, you will need the sand.<br>  Good Luck!|`|dE5fs9yzaa	As long as it's pure sand and nothing else is in it, it should be okay. Was the sand sold in the flower section? Or is it sandbox sand? Like I said as long as its pure sand you should be okay.|`|jnX9IsSXaa	yea i would think so... i used it for my 10 gallon i used to have and i never had any problem but hey that's just me|`|BMri9tITaa	I don't know about sand.  Unless it was clearly marked for aquarium use, I'd be worried about how clean it was.<br>  <br>  Marbles, mud from your backyard (boiled first, of course), a bare-bottom aquarium, all are good alternatives to gravel and playground sand.|`|RGqs6ySGaa	id say ur best bet is using cash you can take it and turn it into any kind of gravel you want!|`|AXqmo8rlaa	Do yourself a favor and go to Petsmart or Petco and get some aquarium gravel.|`|AxENuJahaa	You can use sand, but you need to make sure it is thoroughly washed.  There is really no need to have anything in the bottom if you don't want it.  The reasons for having substrate is to look at, to anchor plants or decor, and to serve as a home for beneficial bacteria.  The bacteria will also live in your filter, so you don't have to have substrate.  Having a bare bottom tank will make it easier to vacuum up any debris.|`|FAZjuBIsaa	that will definately work.  my dad uses sand and he is a fish owning pro! lol, not officially but u get the idea.|`|f8RBtCVAaa	well if the sand is freshwater aquarium sand. and walmart sells gravel u know but i never seen  sand at walmart|`|DQBvoMF1aa	Use a fresh sand from stream or river.|`|JFEl08NOaa	ya sand would work|`|eC9NUrBkaa	I've used sand in my fish tank and it was fine<br>  x
CqquoBy4aa	It is a swim bladder.  You would have to put the goldfish in another tank.  My goldfish had that problem but it died.  I hope your goldfish is doing well!|`|TYohMrlXaa	Floating is a swim bladder problem, hopefully this is just caused by constipation. Do not feed the fish for 3 or 4 days. They will be fine for a couple days with out food, watch her and see if she improves at all. <br>  <br>   After a few days try feeding her a pea. Just the regular frozen bag of peas, no salt added, take the skin off and chop it into bite sized pieces. <br>  <br>  If this helps you should make peas a regular part of their diet, like just peas one day a week, to help avoid this happing again. It also might help to vary their diet, if you want more ideas check out this website.<br>  <a href="http://www.kokosgoldfish.invisionzone.com/forum/index.php?showforum=12" rel="nofollow">http://www.kokosgoldfish.invisionzone.co...</a>|`|dE5fs9yzaa	If she is floating, it could be swim bladder. check this site out and go to diseases :<a href="http://www.bristol-aquarists.org.uk/goldfish/info/breeding-fs.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bristol-aquarists.org.uk/gold...</a><br>  You could try feeding it some daphnia or cooked but shelled peas and see if its just bloated. Also, are they being overfed? its real easy to do so. Just feed them once a day and what they can eat in a couple of minutes.

Also NO puppy can hold it for 6 hours they can only hold it for approximately 1 hour every month they are old, so just make sure the dog is 6 months old, don't get an 8 week old puppy. My puppy is 12 weeks old and she surely can't hold it for more than 2 hours she goes all the time!!|`|wQxYMCkKaa	How about a Basenji!  They are unable to bark like a normal dog, sometimes they do a weird sort of whiny noise.  anyway not very big they are atanish reddish color.  Look up the breed for more info.

F3FrZ7eAaa	Good question first off.<br>  <br>  Venoms are generally not toxic if swallowed, and must be injected under the skin (by snakes, spiders, etc.) into the tissues normally protected by skin in order to be toxic. But I mean, just say in therory you had a cut on your lip or something, that's still entering your blood stream. Obviously you shouldn't try this.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Marco has the right idea but doesn't go far enough. Venom could enter your blood stream by way of an ulcer or a cavity in your tooth. There was a short story about a man who used to sell curare and "demonstrate" that his competitor's curare was no good by eating it. His competitor gave him some under-ripe pineapple, which irritated his stomach lining just enough to allow the poison to reach his blood stream.<br>  <br>  In other words, don't try it.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	Be a pioneer and you may be a famous pioneer.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Or a dead pioneer.|`|lING8JbJaa	In theory - No, it would have to be injected into your bloodstream.<br>  <br>  In reality - If you were to drink venom and had ANY wound or cut on your lips, in your mouth, in your throat, or in your stomach, possibly even further down your system, the venom would have a straight pathway into your bloodstream which would be harmful, possibly fatal.|`|vV425TqZaa	At the most you wont die, but Venom is actually much more different then poison is because Venom is injected into the skin while on the other hand Poisons are either drank or absorbed.|`|LbNXxRXnaa	Venom is typically injected into the skin, so I'm assuming no.|`|oSXRSKFSaa	it can make you sick but it has to be injected into the skin to kill you.

Substrates can contain silicates that leach out over time and even new aquarium glass can contribute. It's harmless to fish so I think your fish may have died because your tank isn't cycled (nitrification cycle).|`|YedeC4D5aa	in the first week a form of brown algae grown instead of green algae, and i really don't think that the fish's death was related, but i, however, could be wrong, this is a question you should ask to a fish expert or specialist.
EtqjIWX3aa	I stopped in my vet's office to pick up an Rx and noticed a paper on the counter listing all of the pet insurance carriers that they will accept. I am in the process of also researching the best policy for my pets.<br>  <br>  The main question to ask yourself is if it is really worth it in the long run. Far too many people put a price tag on their pet and when the vet bills start piling up, they consider euthanasia, a cheaper alternative.<br>  <br>  However, if you are the type of pet owner who will willingly go into debt to save its life, then pet insurance might be the answer!<br>  <br>  I can not recommend one particular insurance company. It is best to research and find the one that meets your pet's specific needs. Some companies cover pre-existing conditions and hereditary diseases (such as hip displasia) while others will not.<br>  <br>  galtech.com reports the following review:<br>  <br>  VPI Pet Insurance - they offer a number of different priced options; their VPI Superior Plan ($50 ded. per incident, max. annual benefit of $14K, pays 90% of cost) for a 3 year old Huskie was about $30 bucks a month.

269Jcwlaaa	just bathe her in the morning and dry her with towels.....why isn't she allowed inside just for a bath?|`|VsaEOX9vaa	If you can't get her to a doggy wash on the way to the vet I'd give her a bath the night before and tie her up on a grassy area.<br>  <br>  The vet will clean all the area where the op is going to be, and it will be disinfected, etc. still not nice to cover the op table with red dust!<br>  <br>  Hope all goes well for her.|`|tY14vbrKaa	It's obviously a type-o, since you spelled it correctly throughout your question, so ignore the people picking on you for it.<br>  <br>  Aside from the fact that she shouldn't be "outside only", there's no need to bathe her before going.  They will fully clean the area before surgery.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Princess Keshia, take your own advice "speller"  LMAO|`|ho0XRinGaa	She's still a pup, so judge the weather. She sounds great and at least you're responsible enough to have her sorted. It breaks your heart at the time, I know. But you're doing the right thing. Give her loads of cuddles as I'm sure you will! Stuff the bath if it's a problem.!! She'll be shaved anyway. Just be there and she'll be fine! Hope all is well.X|`|PwkYJoVgaa	umm; yeah that might be fine.|`|hE4CXKX2aa	Wouldn't hurt, but the vets clean the area that they work on, or they could simply chemically nuder the animal.|`|Ub8arVLpaa	If my dog got payed I'd more than bathe her.  The tech will clean that area and make sure that things are sterile before surgery.  No need to worry.|`|KuUx34hCaa	it's not necessary|`|6ffd4feb2e23eaa6f5d5f78d385bd968aa	Yes, make sure you give her a good bath the night before. You don't want her to get any types of infections from dust/dirt. The vet just cleans the area they are going to work in. She's going try to lick her dusty self and trying to lick the stitches, this can cause her to get a bad infection.  I say wash her.|`|1EF95BFuaa	umm i have a maltese so i keep her inside my house. I think that you should bathe her the day before you take her to the vet?|`|ZdlENZR6aa	Payed? She's Working? lol just kidding........ give her a bath, its good for her! that's red dust probably is not good for her skin.|`|Um8osMNuaa	There's no need to bath her before taking her into the vets, they will clean the area before operating.|`|e1GCbGrXaa	ring your vet and ask. i'm sure they can give her a wash down on site<br>  also might work to use the word "neuter " instead|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	It would be a good idea, yes. They'll shave her prior to the surgery anyway, but it just makes for a better and easier operation if she's moderately clean (sanitary reasons as well as comfort and presentation).|`|Vp83Fuakaa	they will ciean the area and shave the hair so it really wont matter they ciean were they need it clean dont worry about it|`|I6D7xdcVaa	Payed? Is she a working dog?|`|dwok9z8faa	i think that if u really want to, you can bathe her like the night before and put her in a garage or something- if you can't do that though, then you might as well just leave her be, shes not filthy, the vets will clean her up to sterilize the area, they have touched wet and muddy dogs before, and ur dog doesn't need that extra stress and "trauma"- haha. <br>  (i no my dog hates baths); otherwise, i don't think it really matters and you don't want to put her somewhere she isn't used to during the night by herself...<br>  btw- thank you for getting ur dog spayed. some people think it isn't necesary, but b/c of all the puppies everywhere, more dogs end up in shelters<br>  good luck :)

Bad people have turned the great breed pitbull into a bad breed,There is no such thing as a "good pit"  I sell pups, i could sell a 1/3 more a month if i had pits,I wont get one for anyone. Its just a bad breed.Before i get all the "my pit is great" e-mails just look at what i typed at the start. I know dogs, i am always learning about them,I read everyday about bad pit bulls,Never heard of the lab that attacked and could not be removed from someones arm. The pitbull is not a pet. You all say my pit is a good dog,you have 1 dog,Right now i have 72 at my shop, No pitbulls,I have a few more dogs then you,i know a lil more about dogs|`|TblG3s89aa	my friends have 4 pit-bulls and their all really smart. They are all rescues and one of them was most likely abused and he refused to roll over and he has issues with his paws but they let me come and help train him and i eventually got him to roll over but it took a while even though he is smart. <br>  If you really want him to roll over you can probably eventually accomplish that. First you should build his confidants. You can do that by getting him to jump a hurdle or doing tricks with him and getting excited when he gets it right. Next you can try to do things to get him to roll over such as if he likes being rubbed try rubbing his side and getting him to lie down, or you can get him to follow a treat he loves such as chicken, or getting him to follow a toy. HE IS PROBABLY SCARED BECAUSE LYING ON HIS BACK BECAUSE WHEN DOGS LIE ON THEIR BACKS THEY EXPOSE THEIR STOMACH (THE MOST SENSITIVE AREA) AND UNLIKE OTHER DOGS THAT HAVE LIVED WITH PEOPLE SINCE THEY WERE PUPPIES HE PROBABLY DOESN'T HAVE MUCH CONFIDANTS AND BEING A STRAY HE WILL NEED TIME TO ALLOW YOU TO TOUCH HIS STOMACH KNOWING YOU WONT HURT HIM. IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT WILL TAKE SOME WORK<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|dWK0B5g3aa	I taught my dog bang the other day.<br>  When I say 'bang' and point my hand at her in a gun shaped position, she falls to the round as if she's dead.<br>  However she does roll on her back a bit, she decided that part, so just maybe into a laying down position? It''s a really funny trick as well.<br>  My other dog also knows speak, whenever your dog barks, say speak and do a small hand gesture of a mouth mimic. Only took about 10 minutes to learn. Also doesn't involve rolling over!|`|wQxYMCkKaa	How about army crawl, wave,  maybe you could also try agility.  Have fun!|`|u9QV92KQaa	how to die

v9EXG82Kaa	I had the same problem a few years ago. I had three Rottweilers and walked all three at the same time because I trained them and bought them up to know that they guarded my home (surrounded by a six foot high wall) but outside on the public highway people could walk freely without my dogs interfering. All the local kids loved and played with my three Rottweilers in the woods behind my house and in the street. I must impress that I was always there while the kids hugged them, kissed them and played with them. Unfortunately adults had the same crazy notion that you described and called them killer dogs and demon dogs.I found that I did not have to protect people from my dogs but had to protect my dogs from people. Sadly a few idiots thought they were tough guys and strutted around with Rottweilers that they had made aggressive and threatening and gave the breed and the owners a bad name.  As you have already realised Rottweilers are very lovable and highly intelligent. Probably more intelligent than the owners that got them a bad name. Good luck with your lovely Rottweiler, I wish you well with him. I used to walk my three dogs for three hours a day and but for the fact I am now 63 years old and had two heart attacks I would have another one.|`|0J1cYbXQaa	They are ignorant because they have never experienced a well bred, socialised and trained Rottweiler, who will love people and other dogs if you know the love of a Rottweiler all you will see is a beautiful loving dog who is gentle and sensitive.  They are in my own experience one of the largest lap dogs you can get, you have to blame irresponsible breeders, ignorant or irresponsible owners and the media for how this wonderful breed is perceived by the public.|`|269Jcwlaaa	Um, johana wasn't saying she thought that. she was just saying that is what people hear, so they just automatically think that. <br>  <br>  Anways pit bulls have a worse reputation, and i think its wrong for states to ban them just because so freakin stupid people want to use them to fight.  It's not fair.  All dogs are nice, they are just trained bad.|`|ZCWX81MGaa	i dont no i guess its all the bad press!<br>  i have no problem with them and think they can be lovley dogs!<br>  its not the breed itself its how you bring a dog up that determines whether its nasty or not!|`|tY14vbrKaa	The real question should simply read as follows:<br>  <br>  Why are people so ignorant?<br>  <br>  The answer?<br>  <br>  I'm not sure, but I hear that it's bliss.|`|UXgoY8Afaa	It's very simple -it's in their blood due to thir breed and it's this unpredictability which is what worries people.  So many of the stories you hear on the news are when beloved family pets just 'turn'- having never been aggressive before that incident.  They're not doing it on purpose, it is simply instinct.  If they are a hunting breed, or 'gamers' - whatever the term is, it's always going to be a natural instinct that runs the risk of being triggered at some point, if something small, or fast, sets them off.  Although it may not be active a lot of the time as they are domesticated, you cannot guarantee that instinct is not going to kick in.<br>  I'm sure your dog is adorable, and that you've never had any sign of aggression at all, but if you're asking why people fear the breed, this is why.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Well, its mostly because the people who own this breed (and every other breed on the "dangerous" list) fail to see the negatives.<br>  <br>  These dogs don't need people preaching how awesome they are, they need people talking about understanding the breeds.<br>  <br>  Sure, Rotties are great dogs. But not every single member of this breed is as innocent as people claim. There are dogs out there with medical tendencies towards aggression-- JUST like the APBT, Staffordshire, Shepherd, etc etc etc. <br>  <br>  Every dog, regardless of breed, sex, age, or background holds the ability to attack, maim, or kill a child. It all boils down to the breeding and training.|`|ws4c4GDgaa	The reason most people run in terror when they see a rottweiler is because they wr bread for fighting and thats how people see them now even though not all of them are like that anymore.  I know how you feel I have a bulldog who loves to jump on people and give them kisses but they think shes trying to kill them.  Its only because of the dogs reputation that people judge the dog I myself love rottweilers and wish i had one. Like pittbulls people hate them even though they have a better temper than a german sheppard and a dalmation.

I never judge a dogs breed because its the dog that could develop problems with aggression etc, but this is usually due to the ignorance of the human handler.<br>  <br>  If a puppy is not socialise from the minute you collect your pup, or a non experience owner buys the pup, this is where the dogs start to get there dominance, and if not corrected properly from the beginning that dog will be hard to handle and unpredictable.<br>  <br>  I have little dogs , chihuahuas, and i get fed up with people saying they are yappy and snappy, they are nothing like that i have 9 in my house and 3 poms, and the dog 4 doors down the road makes so much noise and theres only 1, i only hear mine bark when the door bell goes!<br>  <br>  If only us good dog owners could educated these people we would all be so much happier.<br>  <br>  I have never had a rott, but i do think they are gorgeous.

The best dog I have ever handled. Intelligent, obedient, loyal, loving. Also, he gets quite upset if he accidently hurts someone. <br>  You must remember though that they are powerful dogs and their bite is incredible. Sometimes while trying to take a tennis ball from his mouth, he might accidently nip my hand, and it feels like I've been hit with a hammer! <br>  So if a Rottweiller does have reason to 'turn', it can be quite dangerous. The owners, as you say, are the biggest culprits.|`|EXBMxFCKaa	People are ignorant and stereotypical as a result of society, that's all. One dog turns out to be mistreated and aggressive and suddenly the whole breed is condemned to a life of murder. It's ridiculous, it's the same way with Pitts and they're one of the sweetest breeds, my elder sister has two and they're both teddy bears. <br>  <br>  The person makes the dog, not the other way around, if you saw a child hitting a parent you wouldn't say all seven year olds are awful, you'd just be asking yourself why the parents take no disciplinary action towards them, the same should be thought when looking a dog and it's owner (except with training and such, in my opinion any way) <br>  <br>  Johana: People like you that judge based on a majority opinion are defined as "ignorant" by most because you speak in an uninformed manor. Once again, if this were someone saying (no offense) the Asian people I've seen are uptight so all Asians are therefore uptight you'd probably be highly offended, but because it's a dog you can just be a sheep to society and not care about the consequences.
dWK0B5g3aa	If she was friendly with the other dog it could be that she misses him and is pining for him.<br>  Huskies where bred to live in packs and so there are always a big number of them, it could be that she is lonely, if you could offer another dog a home its a possibility, but only when you know why she is wining. <br>  She coud be pregnant but only if she was in heat.<br>  I'd take her to the vet though as they can give you a better answer by checking her over|`|7vJNHaskaa	If you're worried, call a vet and see what they say. If they think it's serious enough, give the phone to your parents to convince them to take your dog to get checked out. Good luck.|`|KuUx34hCaa	more info needed was she in heat if she was not then there is no way she could be|`|u9QV92KQaa	no shes in pain. take her too the vet|`|a108feb2e121c5dbe12470d4f1ab3002aa	I'd take her to the vet for an exam. I know, we all hate forking over the $$ to vets as they usually suggest more tests, but in this case I would. As for Pomeranian/Huskie mix, well, that would be interesting! I'm just to visualize that happening!|`|BTHDFMd8aa	there's a big chance that she is pregnant. you should talk to the vet. maybe she is sick? or maybe it's an emotional problem.|`|0ESxOfdmaa	It sounds like she might be in pain.|`|tY14vbrKaa	Any sudden change in demeanor should be handled by your vet.  Pregnancy is a possibility.<br>  <br>  Wow, HuskyXPomeranian... that's an interesting mix.
