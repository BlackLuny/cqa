VjUqAZuUaa	I ADORE Doctor Who, I'm utterly obsessed by it! But I'm afraid I've only seen the new series so I can't comment on the full run. Here's my answers though:<br>  <br>  Favourite Character: Donna Noble (in the series, not the Christmas special.) I found her very endearing and Catherine Tate had a great emotional range.<br>  Favourite Doctor: I realise I have few to choose from but David Tennant definitely.<br>  Favourite Companion: See my answer for the first question! Loved her. I actually cried at what happened to her in the last episode of series 4.<br>  Favourite Villain: Hmm I think probably the Weeping Angels in 'Blink', who scared the hell out of me. Or the Master, maybe.<br>  Favourite episode: Silence in the Library - thought it was fantastic!<br>  <br>  Least Favourite Character: Hmm apart from Martha who I'll talk more about below, maybe Madame De Pompadour but probably just because she was kissing MY Doctor!<br>  Least Favourite Doctor: Well like above, having only watched 2 doctors I don't have any other option than to go for Christopher Eccelston, but I quite liked him.<br>  Least Favourite Companion: Martha. I never really connected with her, for some reason. I felt she was emotionally lacking and I didn't like her pining after the Doctor.<br>  Least Favourite Villain: The Slitheen. I found them irritating and the humour a little childish.<br>  Least Favourite Episode: I thought 'Fear Her' was pretty poor, and I also wasn't too keen on the latest Christmas Special. But the one that left me least satisfied was 'Journey's End' - brilliant epsiode but I hated Donna's fate, it really did upset me.<br>  <br>  I suppose what I love the most about Doctor Who is that way it's always exciting, anything can happen and how you can really connect with the characters. So in a way, it's good when you find yourself sobbing over the fate of a fictional character - it's better than switching off and going, 'Well that was a waste of time.'<br>  <br>  Hope that helped (I know it was a bit long!) =)|`|1yo2sJ62aa	Doctor Who is the best! It's fantastic. If you want to read Fanfictions about it, go to www.fanfiction.net. It has fantastic fanfictions written by lots of different people.<br>  Anyway, back to the question:<br>  Favourite Character: Rose Tyler, also known as Bad Wolf.<br>  Favourite Doctor: I've only seen 9 and 10. I'd have to say 10. David tennant.<br>  Favourite Companion: Again, Rose Tyler-or a companio from the old series, called Ace! or Dorothy Gale Mcshane. <br>  Favourite Villian: Davros and th Daleks! <br>  Favourite Episode: The Doctor's Daughter. <br>  <br>  Leasy favourite character: don't have one.<br>  Least favourite Doctor: Again, don't have one.<br>  Least favourite companion: alright, not one of these either. the only one I do have is:<br>  Least Favourite Episode: Doomsday/ Journey's End. For reason look at my favourite character/companion.|`|coMMMNQJaa	The Doctor<br>  David Tennnant<br>  Donna Noble<br>  I LOVE Davros<br>  The Stolen Earth/Journey's End (All the rest as well)<br>  <br>  None<br>  None<br>  None<br>  None<br>  None|`|ErmcT4uUaa	Favorite Character   The Brigadier<br>  Favorite Doctor    Tom Baker<br>  Favorite Companion    Ace<br>  Favorite villain.         Davros<br>  Favorite episode.      Blink<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Worst  Doctor     Colin Baker<br>  Worst  Companion  I never liked the 5th Doctors Side Kicks ( Adric , Tegan and Nyssa )|`|XAAF7R23aa	dr who in his many guises<br>  tom baker<br>  sarah jane<br>  got to be the master or the leader of the daleks,<br>  an unearthly child which the first one ever, then the whole keys to time set<br>   <br>  sylvester mccoy was the worst dr who, so i could say he was my least favourite character<br>  worst companion was melanie<br>  paradise towers is my least favourite episode<br>  i like all thevillainss difficult to say which is my least favourite

ZyGyDLsDaa	Someone Is Watching (2000 TV movie)<br>  starring Stefanie Powers, Mickey Toft, Margot Kidder, Martin Neufeld, Barry Flatman<br>  IMDb review: ***SPOILERS***<br>  Michelle Dupre and her 6-year-old adopted son Cory, have moved out of their previous residence because the house was burglarized and she had a traumatic confrontation with the criminal. Unknown to them, the house they have moved into was the subject of a brutal murder more than a year ago. Almost as soon as they move in, Michelle is victimized by a stalker who calls her at all hours of the day or night only to hang up when she answers the phone. At first it is suspected that the landlord's strange 30-year-old son is behind all of these happenings~until he commits suicide and the stalking and phone calls continue. Michelle's next-door neighbor,  Sally, who babysits Cory, brings in a local psychic, who tells them of the murder committed in the house and that the person responsible is still at large though the killer supposedly was imprisoned. Meanwhile, Cory has found a seemingly imaginary friend who lives in his bedroom closet. At first, Michelle and Sally believe that "B.J." is a figment of Cory's imagination but later find out to their surprise that he is very real~and dangerous!<br>  <br>  I'm not at all sure if this is your movie, but what you describe does occur in this film. Here's a clip I found on YouTube:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta-EDQkje2E" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta-EDQkje...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT: The two houses ARE connected so that the man can travel back and forth. I think he uses an electric train to deliver cookies and other gifts to the little boy. At first, we think it might be a ghostly presence or simply the child's imagination. The visitor/stalker ends up killing Margot Kidder's character and terrorizing the mother and son. They find passages in the house no one except the man who built them knows about. In some ways, it's reminiscent of "Christina's House", which goes into the hidden parts more elaborately.|`|yQ7Nk4yWaa	the scene|`|oHyNxKCuaa	Definitely,thescene.you can check it through ovg.com
6npsRIzUaa	No. I learned grammar and how to type from playing MMORPGs, believe it or not. I also learned alot of my math skills from playing them too, I think it's complete BS when people say they're "not educational" or "brain numbing". The only way they're addictive and "brain numbing" is when you restrict your kids from  it so much that when they finally get it, they never want to put it down. My little brothers spend 80% of their time playing video games, such as the Zelda series, almost ever Mario game (even the old NES ones), games such as Jewelquest they learned to read, basic math, and they're extremely good  at solving puzzles and quickly, all from video/computer games!<br>  <br>  I also think it is total BS that if you're a gamer you'll sit around doing nothing, become overweight and antisocial. I know a LOT of gamers who are VERY social and not anywherer near being overweight. Game cons ftw! Online gaming forums let's you meet and make new friends.<br>  <br>  To the answers saying gamers 'stuff their faces', and 'anti-social and sadistic' please, stop using stereotypes and get some real facts.<br>  <br>  And to the answer saying that some games are too violent/hardcore language/etc. Really? Your kids aren't mature enough to handle seeing violence and hearing "bad" words on a video game? My brothers have been killing and fighting and hearing a few "bad" words on video games since they were about 3 and they've NEVER felt the need to go out in real life and reproduce what they saw/heard, they're smart enough to understand that was a video game and this is real life, and they know the difference between right and wrong. I think it's very sad if a kid does not have the ability to understand this.<br>  <br>  There is nothing in life that you can do that does not involve you learning something new.<br>  <br>  And sorry for the long *** possibly lecturing answer, I grew up in an unschooling enviroment, and it honestly drives me crazy when parents try to control their kids and try turn them into what they think they should be, not just letting them be the way they already are. Especially by trying to take away TV or video/computer games, when that's what I learned most of what I know off of,and not on purpose or because they're 'educational'|`|9S6xT3Onaa	Too many children spend too much time infont of the computor or telvision while stuffing thier faces with chips. We wonder why there are so many over weight children?|`|AA11123061	although i absolutely love video games but i think they should as it is an addiction ... sad but true|`|c2gIer5baa	Um. <br>  *leaves addictinggames.com*<br>  :D<br>  I think that parents should LIMIT how much time their children spend gaming online, but they shouldn't restrict it completely.|`|IizPFrELaa	Absolutely 100% yes|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	Yes.|`|X5hTmAkBaa	yeah... no learning games only fun games|`|AA12262106	I believe that they should.<br>      Not only can computer games be addictive, the repetitive motion can cause significant injury. Like most things in life, moderation is key.|`|k2vvT6glaa	yeah my brother is suchhh a gamer and my parents restrict him kinda but not really<br>  <br>  It really annoys me!<br>  <br>  And plus excessive computer gaming makes people anti social and sadistic|`|ZfN4SSmDaa	I'm a kid and I say yeah.

quIDrXktaa	I think there are a couple of factors<br>  <br>  Firstly music, being a much rarer occurence in your life before recorded music made it special almost regardless of it's quality.<br>  <br>  Secondly - performers, (call them troubadors) performed works from a fairly consistent canon of songs, so that the performer may have changed but you still knew the song.<br>  <br>  The troubador tradition was as much about spreading news as it was about musical appreciation, troubadors travelled to towns spreading stories of battle victories and royal gossip to well known tunes.<br>  <br>  Music was consumed in a vastly different manner to what it has been since the flourishing of audio recording technology. You have discerning tastes now that you could never have developed in a different age - music was not as all pervasive as it is now, it is hard to imagine now how rare it was to hear it and see it performed.

n583S1uZaa	That is an excellent movie of profound moral substance!Although the film conveys its message with a high degree of anti-totalitarianism overtones,the message that comes through by the movie's end is:Real freedom is democracy and such democracy can only be achieved by a government that serve the people,unconditionally without threat,intimidation and false representation.That the power of imperial-rule lies in the hands of"The People"if they choose to use it.That is a great statement movie that I love! This is a very good movie-question!|`|VD4NQMLLaa	I think that is the fear of totalitarian systems where people are subject to brutal law enforcement and the hypocrisy of politicians and clergymen.|`|xOiyuDataa	It's one of my favourite films, but quite complex too. <br>  I think the meaning could be justice, and equality (in other words having equal rights).|`|8jQ3FBpAaa	the government totally sucks.|`|eZNuuFrJaa	That governments are there to serve the people and not the people to serve the government.<br>  Remember when V said that governments should be afraid of their people not people afraid of their governments................<br>  <br>  This is one of my all time favorite movies!

8uIfskigaa	I wouldn't go that far but I find it ridiculous & soo annoying unless they actually have a real talent....but most get famous for doing reality tv, sleeping with a footballer, getting a boob job & then selling their story to the tabloids..Don't read those papers anymore or mags as all the crap in there enough to drive anyone over the edge haha :)|`|QEQmMZycaa	Depends on the publicist I think...but I think the media are to blame...a lot of what they chose to put in the papers, magazines etc seems to have an effect on how 'celebs' are perceived. Most of them are complete losers with less than zero talent and don't deserve the term 'celebrity'|`|zPgbpSgHaa	Offensive??? No, I think it's overrated & pompous, but not offensive.|`|5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	Not really.  I find the work 'appropriate' really offensive and am sick to death of hearing it|`|3f21c30b3424532b28fd9578258f69d9aa	Yes ! - I hate these swarmy Celeb's - especially ones who ponce around with Politician's.. but then if it wasnt for them we would have no one to slag off ...|`|akcGfgdcaa	Not as much as I do the way you spell 'offencive'....its offensive.|`|LgNqYUECaa	Not really.|`|wlSD6Ccgaa	not really|`|9TQrtSoiaa	yeah im one of those few people who doesnt care about celebrities,doesnt pay attention to the gossip, doesnt watch BB or any other crap reality tv show, wouldnt wanna go see some prat tht learned music from simon cowell and co and thts how im always going to be|`|P5jM0Lpkaa	Absolutely, utterly offencive!|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	Maybe a little bit offensive at times.

It's a waste of time.|`|CYhOr4s7aa	hahaahheehhaah  waiting is the hardest part|`|PYmdmuw8aa	Learn to like cold meat!!!!!!|`|QEQmMZycaa	...of course! Make sure you heat it up thoroughly though!|`|wmBK9uASaa	It needs a little reheating|`|B1GjfOUdaa	Of course go ahead.|`|caea98f7ed2871cd6caf9a1f351fc5ddaa	clotted cream is also a dish best served cold,spooky or what?|`|WiXVQEPjaa	Its how i cook mine, i nuke it,|`|OJtFNjfvaa	No only t.i. said that|`|8j70Neqeaa	sounds like a plan.

NQ37mnWkaa	Good afternoon, Migh :)<br>  <br>  I'm aware of the existance of fanzines, and I know that Blackmore's Night have several in different countries {they have a big following in Germany and other parts of Europe}, though I've only read one online a few weeks ago. <br>  <a href="http://www.blackmoresnightukfanclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=943" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackmoresnightukfanclub.com/...</a><br>  <br>  It does seem rather sad in some ways that they have fallen out of existance <br>  {endangered species!}<br>  <br>  I used to be both a subscriber and contributor to a fanzine for "The Rocky Horror Picture Show", but I guess that is one of those things that has cult status to keep it going. <br>  <br>  Maybe R&P should start some...?<br>  A lot of users here keep their ears to the ground about their favourite bands, and we have several artists amongst us, so who knows...<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope that the couple of books I'm working on could be seen as akin to fanzines {I believe they would be what people call 'coffee table books'}. They are intended to be collections of drawings, poetry, and short stories, all inspired by songs / song titles. The two main ones are to be Jethro Tull, and Blackmore's Night, {and possibly a Fleetwood Mac / Stevie Nicks one} and I also plan to do a book of drawings based on a wide variety of songs.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  NP : 'Piano Concerto No.1 - Rondo Vivace' ~ Chopin|`|EQ9k2Gbyaa	Sad, huh?Though they are still around.

zFsTSrOcaa	The Northridge earthquake, January 17, 1994, a mile from the epicenter.  The first thing I remember was literally flying through the air and landing on the floor, in total darkness, with stuff falling on top of me.  The noise was so loud that when I yelled for my wife and daughter I could barely hear myself.<br>  <br>  It took a few minutes to dig out of the room and assure each other that we were okay.  The house seemed intact, and we went outside.  The block wall was down and the neighbor was yelling about gas.  Our water heater had fallen away from the wall, taking the gas line with it, so we had a gas leak.  The hot water and debris from the wall were a challenge, but we were able to reach the gas main and shut it off.<br>  <br>  There was no power.  The sky was the darkest I've ever seen from L.A., with stars everywhere.  A stunning sight--except for the red-tinged smoke plumes on the horizon.  By daylight, we could see that the houses in the neighborhood were intact, although just about every loose object had been hurled and/or smashed to the ground.  We were fortunate that none of the gas main breaks in our neighborhood caught fire.<br>  <br>  Things were pretty much back to normal in a few days, although a few of the larger aftershocks sent us scurrying under tables for a while.  Still, I think earthquakes are the least scary of the major disasters, maybe just because I've been through one.|`|caea98f7ed2871cd6caf9a1f351fc5ddaa	once i ran out of clotted cream ,it was a real disaster,i had to wait till the morning,|`|lk3W1VJHaa	Making Love To My Ex.|`|IizPFrELaa	I have two actually<br>  <br>  The Northridge California earthquake, and the Tornado that ripped through Limon, Co|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	i've been through enough EARTHQUAKES here in California!

gkuwNtsvaa	The needle exchange program is to exchange used syringes for new ones in an effort to prevent blood born diseases and HIV/AIDS.  By sharing needles any pathogen that CAN be transmitted, IS, by the sharing of the infected host's blood remaining in the syringe.  HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C are transmitted in this way.<br>  <br>  HIV/AIDS is also transmitted by the sharing of bodily fluids, i.e., semen via vaginal and passive anal sex when the force of the act causes capillaries (very small blood vessels which connect the arteries and the veins) to break and semen (which can carry the HIV/AIDS virus and also Hepatitis C) is introduced to the bloodstream via the broken capillaries.  <br>  <br>  Do not share needles, ever!  Always use a condom in anal/vaginal sex !  You are not only having sex with the immediate partner but also everyone they have had sex with prior to YOU !|`|CYhOr4s7aa	it should of been started yrs ago,  in fact if someone is hooked there should be programs,  addiction ids a mental problem  not just an addiction,  the root of the problem has to be addressed way before the problem will ever go away|`|LgNqYUECaa	If you live in England, don't trust the NHS, they get blood from prison's.

hBBHFp69aa	you may want to protect your heart more so than most people. it seems you can be offended easily and unfortunately lash out on someone simply because of emotion pain that can be dealt with in healthier way. your strengths however are that you can empathize well, and protect and defend those who need it most. have you considered being an attorney or perhaps a social worker?|`|cuIX13BKaa	I'd say you would delight in being worshiped and have a love of satin sheets. Nothing wrong with that at all....you are compelled to communicate....rather to be heard. Your life will have that flair...making a great entrance....captivating.....seductive when you want to be and often you just cannot turn that off.....this is intensified by your venus in Scorpio.....I would say a very 'My want now' sort of approach to intimacy.....that you will not be denied. I see you as monogamous and very giving.....full of laughter watch the criticism.....you may know best as you have the incredible potential to see what others cannot...the bigger picture of whatever is going on.....as you grow older....people will listen to you more and more ~ They will be compelled to listen on account of your vocabulary and your voice....you could walk into a room and hear a pin drop. Not knowing the house placements makes this more difficult...but I know these signs well....My Mars is in Leo....My Venus is in Cancer. ~ Though I stay away from crowds as a rule....I LOVE finer things...signature perfume scent....presents....to be thought of even in small ways...if i am at all wrong...please reach me via this format.....but i do NOT think I am wrong. The person who snags you..and i would venture to say quite early on...is very fortunate....I warn you this though...always take credit for the things you have done. If someone makes you a promise...get it on paper! Or yo uwill be one extremely talented person that everyone else tried to covet and watch who your friends really are....even though they may come to you for a shulder do NOT waste your time with aquaintances.....and start putting money away right now.<br>  <br>  Garbo

Especially the ones who are putting down this very country they live in, if they don't like it here they're free to move to another country.  I'm sure there's hundreds of thousands of other people who would love to move to the United States.  Yes some things may seem really bad, but then there's so many things about this country that make it so great, especially for the women who if they lived in other countries like the middle east wouldn't even be able to express their opinion.  I've noticed a few women who have put down our country.  Just be glad you live here & not in some third world country where you're only seen for reproducing & pleasure.  Yes our government may do some messed up things, that's the government & that's how its always going to be so long as you as an American don't fall into that same thing & do the same as well.  We as individual people combined together is what the makes up the United States, the combination of multiracial backgrounds is what makes us so great, that you welcome foreigners with open arms to our country & treat them well could change many views on how we as Americans are.

cuIX13BKaa	Without looking at the other responses and simply going from your question....I say "Absolutely!!!!" Why you are probably wondering? Well here goes......Cancer women are so wonderful....they listen, they are attentive, empathic, nurturing, funny, mindful (I did NOT say that they obey! I never will!). They are dreamy and love music, love to laugh, really put forth effort that is often a rarity in a relationship and they are so loyal. Yes other signs are as well known for their loyalty but that is another story and something i will probably come back to...) The cancer woman can simmer and seethe but never lose it....push her too hard or get in the way of her balance and you will hear the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland shouting the order "Off with her head...!!!" It takes an awful lot to push this dreamy ethereal creature to that point do ...So dig this....Just don't do it! These signs are right next to each other.....and many would say that this doesn't bode well.......I say BS....when a Cancerian Woman knows that there is Chemistry don't go doubting her! She is so incredibly thoughtful that the most minute things are so very often thought of as she is wayyyyyyy ahead of everyone else as her thoughts of centering, balancing and seeing to it that all are taken care of....she needs to remember that SHE needs to come First before anyone else can come first.....This is a woman who deserves to be courted and let this courtship never ever end! Any man would be blessed to snag a Cancer Woman and he had betteer never forget it. She listens and never forgets! A man for all of his bravado, his humourous side will find the humour of the Cancerian Woman his match indeed.....this is going by Sun Signs alone now...and what I am picking up here (as that is precisely what I do!) The man will learn a LOT from her...though may be too proud to admit it....hey they both know what is going on so need it be said? No....as long as the communication which she will insist upon is current....all is well. Trust me you do NOT want to piss her off....or have her go on strike....the traits of a Cancerian Woman are that easily said of a Life Mate.....for that is the glory in all of this. Let the man preen his peacock feathers! Trust me for as wonderful as he is, or as great as he is, or funny or smart.....SHE will be the Woman loyal to the end "Behind him rolling her eyes and stifling the laugh!"<br>  It is NOT a stupid question...it is a Brilliant Question...I would" love to see her chart"...for the 'feelings or vibes' that I am picking up here are that she is one in a million...and that math is analogy only ...it doesn't come near to doing her justice. Whomever you are out there, thank your lucky stars ...you have a real winner in this one...never let her go!<br>  <br>  Garbo|`|ErmcT4uUaa	All I know is Im a cancer and Im the god damn Burger King|`|hBBHFp69aa	Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces are water signs. water signs tend to be the most shy and reserved people on the zodiac, next to earth signs. We earth signs, Virgo, Capricorn, and Taurus, can be shy at times, but its our nature to be prudent, and sometimes people can mistake prudence for shyness. Careful people simply speak when necessary, while shy people may be quiet when they really should be speaking up for themselves, and not allow themselves to be forgotten or trampled over.|`|1915c9b51bf4f4a90fd8cea8d52841eeaa	I'm a cancer and I have a tendency to dominate conversations. Often, I do not have patience for dull people and uninteresting small talks. With an Aries ascendant, I am both an initiator and the one who tries to dominate.|`|E5Y82KGtaa	I think we take the initiative to create and change things that matter to us.|`|50dfad07d8ee2b10b7bb6c48c0f62037aa	Cancers CAN initiate conversations but most of the time, they just wait for others to initiate and then they dominate every aspect of it.<br>  <br>  How do I know this? My mom was a Cancer. x_x<br>  <br>  She is usually reserved and well-mannered when she first meets someone but after a few minutes she would talk more and louder than everyone else in the group.<br>  <br>  Experiences with my Cancer Mom.<br>  <br>  Good:<br>  She is completely devoted to the family. She does everything for us in the house (cooks, cleans, etc). She will smother you with love and affection. The ultimate housewife.<br>  <br>  Bad:<br>  She will explode if things don't go her way. Example: Gives you more food than you can eat or makes you wear more clothes than you need. You say anything close to "I think I am fine the way I am" or "No", and she will turn into a Hulk and rip you limb from limb. She also thinks her way is best for everyone and that people should follow it.<br>  <br>  Simply put, I believe Cancers will initiate more when they know you better and will absolutely dominate the relationship, when you have a relationship with them.

They're just incredibly talented alternative pop/rock musicians.  <br>  Besides, Robert Smith hates being called 'goth', so there you go.<br>  <br>  Just don't try and claim that you ARE goth JUST because you listen to The Cure. That is when you will be labeled a poser. And sorry, but if you do that, i'll be one of the labelers.|`|ErmcT4uUaa	No , you just have to be the kind of person who likes that kind of music.<br>  To see them Live you have to be an emo or a goth becase they are the most boring band live on the face of the planet.<br>  I have seen them 3 times and they sucked every time. ( I got in free the last show I saw for them . The second time I was giving them a second chance. )<br>  <br>  They have some good music but they suck live.<br>  Mostly girls like Robert Smith and think he is cute or something.<br>  I just see the guy as a clown.<br>  That goofy look of his is old .

VVNX1P3jaa	I believe that David Letterman is staying put, but I haven't heard him say if he is also staying or going. NBC has annouced that Jay Leno is getting another talk show, that will be in the 10:00 P.M. slot (eastern time). I don't know exactly when he will start, either in the summer, or in the fall, I don't think that has been decided yet. But with Jay Leno, being on before Conan, which is really nothing new, expect for now, there will be local news that will be seprating the 2 shows, but how will this do, in booking guests, will Jay Leno get the #1 chance, to book guess on his show, before Jimmy Fallon, and Conan?

Skon4LpLaa	it is so not a good idea. my brother went thru the hodgkins treatment. you will have a very sore throat and be nasuea so smoking might make you actually feel worse but i really dont think it has any interference on the effectiveness of the chemo. but do you relly want to get another cancer from smoking?|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	Personally I wouldn't do that. It's your life though. You want to make yourself as fit as you can if your having a fight. I would get some fresh air and talk to your GP about the stress.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|9ADVLFOnaa	A doctor would know the answer to that although they would recommend you don't smoke at all but I get why you would.

UlgAnuLDaa	Honestly, I really don't like Miley Cyrus..But I think she was just messing around. I don't think she was being racist. The media just likes to pick on everything cuz they need "gossip". In my opinion, it wasn't a big deal.|`|j7wESGaDaa	she is not racist... u could tell it was probably just an inside joke with her friends in the picture. the asian kid wasn't doing the eye thing, so he was obviously fine with it.<br>  <br>  i think the whole thing was blown outta proportion.|`|hRc7Awfbaa	I don't know about racist, but stupid- yes!|`|YQYaubzQaa	No, I don't think pulling her eyes makes her a racist, I think it makes her a young girl.  I would think she was doing it just to have fun, and just as a joke.  But, she is famous, so people turn it into a big deal and spread rumours.  Even you said you make jokes about your white friends, but it is all in good fun, and they make jokes about you back.  <br>  <br>  She would be a racist if she were saying or doing something to hurt someone of a certain race.  But she was just trying to have a laugh.  I would do the same thing.<br>  <br>  I think you should still be her fan, because she is just being a kid, too.  If you like her music or her personality, I wouldn't let gossip stop you.|`|ZqFzJ2L8aa	She's being racist but I think it's unknowningly. She's not very international. An America not very international? Shocking!<br>  <br>  Just cause she's popular does not make it right. If you are Asian then you should find this offensive. <br>  <br>  She made a public apology and so even she knows it's wrong. If you can't see it then you need to stop and think about who's side she's on when she did that. Grow a spine and for once fight for what's right. Don't be so complacent to white society or they'll keep doing that crap. Sheesh!<br>  <br>  Here's her formal apology:<br>  <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1586342/20080427/cyrus__miley.jhtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1586342...</a>|`|ms07dd85aa	I think she was just having a laugh and whoever sod her only did it for the money.Xxx|`|wmdAbsA4aa	a bit only if they r ugly lol

8pZ3zdnqaa	I listen to music to relate to how I feel about things.<br>  <br>  I also use it to describe how I feel about things. I listen to music with a message I agree with and like to share it with others.|`|KTNqah9eaa	Oh wow! What an interesting question, but such a huge one. Yes, people write music to entertain, to work out things and listeners are entertained and sometimes get clarity from music, sometimes not. Music also enrages and confuses, excites and depresses. I can only speak from experience as someone who enjoys music rather than composes. Yes, I do find music can change my mood - depress or excite. I also find that it can evoke memories either because it's a familiar tune from a certain period of my life or that it's so moving that it prompts memories. I find it also gives me appreciation of where others, individuals or cultures, are coming from. (Well, maybe I kid myself it does.) It's an amazing way of discovery. As a teenager I only knew about pop, but now my appreciation extends to a whole jumble of types and I'm still discovering more. I'd strongly recommend others to do the same.|`|jBZJkSjWaa	u've nailed it pal|`|bLHhNYTJaa	Music is an abstraction of life. The melody and rhythm alone can create different feelings. It's amazing what kinda trips music can send you on. Hearing is one of our fundamental senses after all and music can excite it superficially or it can use it to stimulate the deepest thoughts in your mind.<br>  <br>  Lyrics I think is a different art...poetry. Complements music well sometimes (lennon) but I like to separate the two.|`|dKXod2j4aa	personally if you listen to ceartain music it could make you fell relaxed or energetic like when u go snowboarding you go to the beat of the music or it gets u pumped
QqXpkatHaa	Good old Sun, huh? Anything to wind up tabloid-reading, lottery playing and chip-eating C2DE's.<br>    Eastenders as a whole; it's fairly boring no matter what colour or people are in it but methinks the question has been composed to get the ignorant out if the woodwork.<br>    In May 1959, a carpenter from Antigua, Kelso Cochrane, was stabbed to death in Kensal New Town by a gang of white men. The Notting Hill Carnival (later on in the summer) is thought to have started as a gesture of defiance following the Cochrane murder, and an assertion of community pride. Perhaps EastEnders were playing on the history - but as we know...real history is always hard to digest in a soap-opera - and if it involved people of a different colour, well - don't even go there, as 95% are more interested in who's shagging who, or who's next to be taught a lesson.|`|eHUXcYZhaa	I didn't find it boring at all. I thought it was really well acted. However I think the blackmail thing between Lucas and Patrick is a bit silly. Why would Denise care that Patrick assaulted some racist thug over 50 years ago?  <br>  <br>  My word people are ignorant on here! 1611 - The show was not advertised as an "all black" episode. That's just the Sun being the racist trash that it is.|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	To me it was just a Truemans episode, like how they have Jacksons only episodes, or Mitchells only episodes, I would honestly never have noticed it was black cast only if my dad hadnt said about the sun article|`|BzUMSGgwaa	it was actually the worst episode of eastenders i hav ever seen , and i travelled 30 mins on a train to get to a TV to see it.

t2evcVVEaa	i definetly see what you mean in the resemblance between the killers and some 80's stuff. especially the song Human. very very 80s. its because of the sythisyzers|`|FRFAcsztaa	Not really...though there is this Danish band called Private..they sound really 80s.

Black Kids sound like a happy Cure to me but rubbish|`|WSZj1M93aa	yes thwy did you now that?|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	pop music reminds me that Bipolar Schizophrenics can through fits of rage and lock their babies in the bathroom, shave their heads, have multiple personalities and talk on and off in an English accent, beat up vans with an umbrella in a psychotic rage like Britney Spears.<br>  <br>  And Pedophiles that take advantage of young boys like Macaulay Culkin and twist and sway their minds with money and manipulation to defend them with other molestation cases, Dangle their babies off balconies, dye their skin white chizle their nose and face off, show up at court late and in their pajamas like Michael Jackson.<br>  <br>  Can do whatever the hell they want in the USA and other countries, still be praised and worshiped for music they most likely didn't even write in the first place. <br>  <br>  IT REMINDS ME OF WHAT A FU*KED UP WORLD WE LIVE IN

jvr66VZFaa	I'm probably too honest,sometimes upset people without meaning to.|`|MstGb2WBaa	Fear... I have such a "daily mail newspaper" mentality, and live in and out of fear. Eg fear of ill health , fear of death, fear of not making my parents proud. Fear of not repenting my sins. Fear of failure. The list goes on. I m not saying I am scared of my own shadow but I basically scared of myself. Not something I do constantly but flickers in and out of my psyche all day long.<br>  <br>  I have racist thoughts sometimes, when I see ethnic criminals in the news I go bezerk especially with asians. I really do try not to. But I am a closet racist and cannot help it. Strange because I have many asian friends so is this really racism?<br>  <br>  When I was young I used to look at porn and visit prostitues alot. It conflicted with my catholic upbringing giving me uncontrollable thoughts, obscenities guilt self denial.<br>  <br>  It starts off with a seed like. Abit like; don't think of orange elephants except you cant help it. It spirals out of control. Gets me just as I am waking in the morning when I have my guard down.<br>  <br>  If I feel threatened I either go to pieces or have the 'knee jerk' mentality of a nazi concentration camp guard. Very aggressive and vengeful. But not to the point where I would carry it out.<br>  <br>  Other general traits are I'm very judgemental at times, immediately looking for the bad or wrong in someone. Maybe this is a self defence mechanism?<br>  <br>  This is probably the most honest account I have ever given of myself! <br>  <br>  Have managed to raise above this ugly traits and become a more balanced person but this dark ugly side which I am not proud of comes back from time to time.<br>  <br>  The glorious trials of life? Who knows..|`|Go3pq7xHaa	My laziness....You can say nice things like, "you're really laidback and easy-going and generous" and so forth - but a lot of the time i'm just too bone idle to be anything else. There's no virtue in having great qualities if you don't put a bit of effort into having them, you know.|`|XJ0Nux6Naa	Well..Im An Aquarius, And Everything They Say About Aquarius Negative Traits I Have Like..<br>  <br>  Intractable and contrary <br>  Perverse and unpredictable <br>  Unemotional and detached <br>  Chaotic and rebellious <br>  <br>  All Of Those Are Me, And They're All Bad =/|`|aBALRxBUaa	Sarcasm....but others seem to be fans of it.

It was one of the hardest for me to really get into, but I really cherish it now. I wouldn't say it's the best. I prefer their later albums to Seventeen Seconds. Out of the three albums from that period, it's my second favorite (after Faith -- though Pornography is excellent too). <br>  <br>  Favorite songs.. <br>  Play For Today, M, In Your House, Secrets.. and of course A Forest, classic song|`|fzqMOD4Waa	God it's been too long since I've listened to it to fully rank the song on it. I personally don't think it's the best album, (TIB takes it for me.) but if memory suits it was decent. <br>  <br>  I'd go and refamilarize myself with it, but my girlfriend who has work in the morning, as brilliant as she is, probably won't understand the brilliance of Smith at 1am.|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	I'll need to check that one out in it's entirety one day. I am more familiar with the sort of mid career Cure stuff, but for some reason never dug too deep into the early stuff even though I really enjoy the tracks that I know from that period.<br>  <br>  From what I've heard I would take Play For Today|`|NlU0GJ75aa	I was listening to it last night a bit.

ISAuCHNDaa	If you love those then try and get hold of some of Poppy Z. Brite's novels, she hasn't written many but they are all good, JT Leroy's novels, a book called My Fantoms by Theophile Gautier is brilliant, here is a link to it on Amazon.co.uk:  <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fantoms-NYRB-Classics-Theophile-Gautier/dp/159017271X" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fantoms-NYRB-Cla...</a>  , Scientific Romances by CH Hinton (this one is out of print and has been for a very long time but here is a link to the Google Book of it I found much to my surprise, I Googled the name of the book to see if I could get a paperback after typing the above as I'd like to read it again but my original copy is a bit too delicate to be read again:  <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/334914/Scientific-Romances-by-Charles-Howard-Hinton" rel="nofollow">http://www.scribd.com/doc/334914/Scienti...</a>  .  There is also the books of Andre Breton, The Ballad of the Sad Cafe and other stories by Carson McCullers.  I could go on and on and list my library for you but I shan't.|`|0ectWZxAaa	Perfume: Patrick Suskind.<br>  Nothing about Vampires but it is dark and an awesome story.<br>  <br>  As far as comics go... It is Manga but the art and story is incredible in Blade of the immortal.<br>  <br>  I really love Poe and Rice, Dirge (obv) and Voltaire too. Do you have msn? :)|`|csoqkiDKaa	UnLunDun is really good, if you haven't read that. It's like Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman (also my favorite book ever). Outlander is also good, Dead Until Dark, The Handmaid's Tale. If you like adventure-y novels, try the Song of the Lioness Quartet by Tamora Pierce. It's 4 books, but they're in that fantasy-adventure genre. Also, anything by Christopher Moore is good. If you're a vampire person, try Bloodsucking Fiends and You Suck. Also, Lamb is a phenomenal book, in my top 3 for sure.<br>  <br>  Basically, don't limit your reading based on your social clique. Reading is meant to enhance you vision of the world around you, broaden your horizons, etc. If you ever want to branch out and read something interesting, I like a lot of historical and biblical fiction (I'm nonreligious, but biblical fiction is JUST SO FUN TO READ!). Try The Other Boleyn Girl, The Passion of Mary Magdalen, The Red Tent, The Virgin's Lover, or The Constant Princess.|`|0psxM4o4aa	Bram Stokers Dracula

ZyGyDLsDaa	The Trip (1967)<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  Paul Groves (Peter Fonda), a television commercial director, is in the midst of a personality crisis. His wife Sally (Susan Strasberg) has left him and he seeks the help of his friend John (Bruce Dern), a self-styled guru who's an advocate of LSD. Paul asks John to be the guide on his first "trip". John takes Paul to a "freak-out" at his friend Max's (Dennis Hopper) pad. Splitting the scene, they score some acid from Max and return to John's split-level pad with an indoor pool. Paul experiences visions of sex, death, strobe lights, flowers, dancing girls, witches, hooded riders, a torture chamber, and a dwarf. He panics but John tells him to "go with it, man."

He knew that the Feds were watching Jackie. I think that either he figured the Feds would follow Sheronda to see if she would go straight to him with the money or that they might seize the money before it got to him.<br>  <br>  Also, Ordell didn't completely trust Jackie.  Remember, he saw her with Max after they talked before the trial run.  He thought she was up to something...which she was!!<br>  <br>  Edit -- Oh, I forgot to answer the other question.  Simone stole the $10,000.

I3z7y7xZaa	Oh sod em' ...to hell with them!! You shouldn't care what people think. Let them make comments...let them stare! Just block out everything, hold your head up high and believe that you can get through this troublesome moment in your life, cause you will get through it...I know it's hard but give it time. If there's one thing in life I've learn't, it's that to ignore anyone who acts like that towards you. Life is much to short to sit there...worrying about how other people view you. People can be every so cruel at times, but as they say, what goes around comes around. Don't worry...give it a week or so and it would all have blown over. People just dont realise how much they are really hurting others. The best thing you can do is act confident...pretend you dont give a damn! Just put on a brave face, and even if your just pretending to be confident....(like I often do)...dont worry! No one is gonna know!<br>  Best of luck...and remember...at the end of the day, their the losers.<br>  XXXX|`|IUiLJDaJaa	People who kick others when they are down are cowards in my book, and it makes them feel better because that's how low they are really feeling about themselves.|`|YJZ8W4QBaa	these people make these comments to make themselves feel better about theirselves<br>  <br>  and they can see you are down so its easier for them to do<br>  <br>  keep your head up and smile!be happy to be alive!|`|KDNWFuZWaa	just stick your middle finger up and tell them to go and fling sh*te at the moon.|`|SG5vRFWjaa	put more of an effort in id say.|`|0uqfkjlgaa	i feel the same way <br>  <br>  people are cruel|`|9TQrtSoiaa	thts a shame people can be cruel|`|wmBK9uASaa	They do it to make them selves feel better,jelousy usually|`|caea98f7ed2871cd6caf9a1f351fc5ddaa	human nature , i tend to ignore them lately ,they can all take a walk of a high cliff|`|1xMTNTgkaa	I am so sorry.

AA10614226	No he is still oblivious to her feeling. If anything Sakura is starting to fall for Naruto in Shippuuden.|`|WS1rqp0Gaa	I don't think so...But if he did,all NarutoxSakura fans will hate Hinata.Hahaha...|`|HMobNUtEaa	So I'm up to chapter 436 in the manga and I have yet to read any hints that Naruto is leaning towards any of the girls from Konoha or any other village. <br>  <br>  There is a rumor going around that the 2nd Shippuden movie will have some NaruHina play but I doubt it and even if they do we should all know Movies are made to be seperated from the series. <br>  So even if something happens between Naruto and Hinata in the movie it wouldn't continue in the series.<br>  <br>  Maybe this will burst a couple of bubbles but yeah, so far no NaruHina action in the manga. As its been said Naruto is still pretty oblivious to Hinata.<br>  <br>  I so can't wait for that movie to be available to watch! XD|`|f456a981d29b822c5b34d993104fa366aa	Well just to let you know there are no spoilers, so don't get to exicited.<br>  <br>  Naruto does see Hinata more, and does notice how she acts weird and does like her. But he doesn't think of her 'that' way.It's just that she's so shy, he thinks she's the weird girl that acts funny around me.<br>  <br>  But Sakura seems to be falling for Naruto, so that doesn't help. When they were 13 she hated him, what happened?<br>  <br>  But anyways, I think he does eventually realize she likes him. But there is nothing like that in the manga yet, so we can't tell.<br>  <br>  I support NaruHina!

IDH78lyAaa	Geminis get the unconditional love that they can't get from anyone else from a Capricorn. <br>  This is an amazing pairing as the Capricorn is often an admirer and supporter of the Gemini's creative talents. <br>  There is a lot of sexual chemistry in this relationship that often culminates in a marriage and probably lots of children (if that's what you want).|`|1rX7HB8Qaa	dont get too entangled into this relationship....you can be firm but not your gemini man since he will have the tendency to be flighty.|`|hBBHFp69aa	If you are not yet married, please get a Virgo man!<br>  <br>  I have studied this for too long and have seen Geminis gravitate towards Saggitarius, and Virgos gravitate towards Capricorns, over time. We are earth signs, Virgo, Capricorns and Taurus, and we love order. Air signs Libra, Gemini, and Aquarius love 'freedom'. What we earth signs call stability, structure, order and accountability, air signs may eventually see as a threat to their 'freedom'. For this reason, our best match is our fellow earth signs, just not the same sign, because to much of the same is never a good thing!(I've dated a virgo man, and I'm a virgo woman. Never should have happened! (giggles)!) Geminis are best matches for Saggitarius because they share the same mind. If you do not want a broken heart, please do your homework. I've been there and done that, you don't want to hurt to much before making educated decisions.|`|DjJwKc9Caa	capricorns annoy the living crap out of geminis.<br>  <br>  it isn't hard for me to see why :)

HJI8778baa	You need to be able to record in 'layers.' In order to do this, there are a number of programs avaliable - the first being Audacity, which is FREE and quite small in memory and does lots of what professional programs such as ProTools, etc... would be capable of.<br>  <br>  When you are recording - you'll want to oversample. Record at 32-bit stereo with no less than 48khz.<br>  <br>  Finally when you are finished (and have mastered using normalization, etc...), output it to either .mp3, or .wav format. I'd recommend both, but then using .mp3 as the distribution file.

C7umw5Vpaa	It's easy to see how she can be mean and seen as meaner. Even she sees it but she pardons more for rude in some occasions than mean. Specially with the press/media in England and, she feels they're mean to her, and so she gets even by being mean. That's her. She doesn't sugarcoat life situations. That's what her music is based off from. That's her natural approach and view to what annoys her. I like her. Her music makes sense. And it's catchy in tune.|`|pgCqszyOaa	well apparently she doesn't like MIKA as he won alot of brit awards in 2008 and he isn't even well known when my best friend is Absolutely obsessed with him and i quite like his songs as well so i don't like he and i think that she has because she was also saying that she thought she did really well as she wasn't as talented as the other singers|`|QIHeSRFkaa	no because she is just being honest and saying what she thinks and shes always been like that|`|ms07dd85aa	nope i love her LOL|`|0eqfW0ASaa	yes|`|p5kzRDIpaa	no, shes honest, i think shes amazing|`|dsjhifclaa	my dad met her last night, he said she was very nice|`|S5yaYUx2aa	yes she might be jaded|`|HnNJAJeJaa	No,i just think shes honest,what you see is what you get with lily...|`|AA11297232	She has a filthy mouth.
lmwVR1BGaa	Ryan Adams.His albums always get good reviews but when they are released he rarely gives  interviews or goes on tv.His music is hard to describe,he keeps changing styles -i could waffle on for ages about him so instead ill just say buy LOVE IS HELL(it was released as 2 eps-15 songs+4 bonus but its 1 cd now),its dark ,downbeat +great -ROCK N ROLL ,loud guitars, recorded in 2wks because they wouldnt release Love is Hell (his 2nd cd, Gold,had hit singles,this one didnt)-youtube amsterdam/ryan a. for acoustic versions and COLD ROSES, acoustic,slow songs,a bit country(usually i cant stand it)2 bonus tracks r good.youtube now that youre gone +meadowlake street.|`|pLPKo6mBaa	^Lol, isn't that a contradiction then?<br>  <br>  I could rattle of DOZENS of underrated bands/artists :P But I'll stick to one from each for now. For the band, I think Dargaard is way underappreciated. Their music is so beautiful and atmospheric. For the artist, I'll go with Vienna Teng. She writes her own lyrics, composes her music, plays the piano, and sings her songs. She's really, really great!|`|zKoNElg7aa	If they stick out in a good way, they WILL make it to the top.<br>  Thing is, it won't happen to all of 'em.

76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	That kind of depends on you.  This is not one of those "If you like Will Smith, you'll love this movie" kind of films. <br>  <br>  If you're an undiscriminating action movie fan, you might like it.  But, if you're not into heavy sci-fi, you'll definitely dislike the picture (it's got thousands of humanoid robots, for starters . . . )<br>  <br>  Myself, I really like Will Smith, but I HATED, yes HATED this movie. Why? <br>  <br>  Because I read & loved the book it's based on, I ROBOT, by the legendary science fiction writer, Issac Asimov.  This book is an authentic classic.  The main character is a fascinating woman, a 'robot psychologist', Susan Calvin. <br>  <br>  And when Will Smith decided he wanted to be in this movie - the studio threw the book out the window & rewrote the entire thing to feature HIM (in a newly made-up character who wasn't even in the book), and reduced Susan Calvin into a dull, minor character. (and adding insult to injury, the director cast a dreadful former-model-turned-actress to play the part. She was BAD). <br>  <br>  In the end, the movie bares scant resemblence to the classic.  The original plot is almost all gone. And the script they shot was pathetic sci-fi (and I love sci-fi). This was a mish-mash. <br>  <br>  Even if someone decides to do a remake some day, it will be at least 20 years from now. If Smith had some respect for classic books, he wouldn't even have looked at this. The lead is a woman, for christ's sake. But he can be a fool sometimes, and, as nice as he appears, he is noted for having a collossal ego, and thinks EVERY part is perfect for him. And he'll take a role even if he's miscast . . . remember Wild, Wild West?|`|Gqirjnjqaa	there is no real story.<br>  the whole movie is like an advertisment <br>  <br>  the advertise converse, and audis.<br>  <br>  a murder occurs and will has to investigate it, so he thinks that a robot did it.|`|xOiyuDataa	No, it wasn't all that, but there will be those who disagree with me, but it doesnt mean you shouldn't watch it. It's worth a watch, but it's not all that great.|`|o0CrpEyfaa	I thought it was good.  Not one of Will's best, but special effects were awesome.  Rent it first before you decide to buy it.  Then you can decide for yourself.  That's my recommendation!   good luck :)|`|AA11330115	I myself wouldn't waste my money on it...I saw it in theaters and I didn't think it was all that great...plus the ending sucked.|`|klSZoy87aa	Eagle Eye has a similar concept, and it's way better than I-Robot.
o0CrpEyfaa	Ben Thomas (Will Smith) is a man posing as an IRS agent who is deeply depressed after a car accident where he was responsible for the death of 7 people, including his wife. Carrying this guilt, he decides to help seven struggling individuals to make up for his terrible mistake. He uses his brother's credentials to access the IRS database to find people who he believes are worthy of his gift. Holly Apelgren (Judyann Elder), Ezra Turner (Woody Harrelson), Connie Tepos (Elpidia Carrillo) and Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson) are among those who he intends to die helping. But as he meets Emily (Rosario Dawson), a beautiful woman who has a heart condition, Ben ends up falling in love with her, which changes his plans.<br>  <br>  there ya go  :)|`|jhJJRiKbaa	Dont you want to go see it and know for yourself, its a great film and you will enjoy it ore if you dont know the plot when you watch it.|`|xGmhDTWwaa	It's an amazing movie, it's kinda sad but you won't regret watching it.

yqe0I5zpaa	Coldplay is original, the songs weren't exactly the same, their was one part in which the tune sounded similar, it is coincidence. Joe just wanted to get his name out their again because his carrer is something that nobody cares about anymore, Coldplay is one of the most original bands their is, their lyrics are rich and bold, the tunes of the piano and guitars are great to listen to. Joe didn't win the case, the songs are analyzed as a coincidence.|`|lN6lNVK4aa	hey shred i'll gladly play all the illiterate for this one<br>  let me first say obviously they are similar all you need is functioning ears to hear that<br>  i too watched that analysis and understood it just a few points<br>  <br>  130 something for simiar tempo you can throw about 80% of all songs ever written into that so in my opinion that don't even count that is a pretty friggin standard tempo<br>  <br>  chords - it is in different key and E-A-D-B is hardly a joe original it has been used thousands of times<br>  <br>  ,melody is uncannily similar but it does but lends itself so well to the progression it is almost the first thing that would pop into someones mind<br>  <br>  but joe must have stole it first<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLt_Hu8bHFc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLt_Hu8bH...</a><br>  <br>  and there is an italian chick who has a song almost exact to it and creaky boards <br>  <br>  point bein it was unoriginal when joe "wrote it"|`|AA10871748	they suck they have one good song -yellow|`|WHcBV7rLaa	Why are you letting other people decide what you like?|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Here is some info I looked up for another Coldplay question.<br>  <br>  Here's what Wiki says about the plagiarism. There is something about a band called Creaky Boards, which I've never heard of.<br>  <br>  Plagiarism allegations<br>  <br>  Coldplay were briefly accused of plagiarism of "The Songs I Didn't Write" by American alternative band Creaky Boards, for the melody of "Viva la Vida". Creaky Boards' band member Andrew Hoepfner claimed that Martin had heard them playing the song at a live show in October 2007. The band released a video clip, in which it compares sections of both songs. Coldplay denied the claim; band spokesman Murray Chambers said Martin was working in AIR Studios in London at that time, having checked the singer's diary. In addition, Coldplay had recorded a demo version of "Viva la Vida" in March 2007, long before Creaky Boards performed it live in October of the same year. Creaky Boards later retracted the accusations and speculated that both songs may have been inspired by the video game The Legend of Zelda.<br>  <br>  In December 2008, American guitarist Joe Satriani filed a copyright infringement suit against Coldplay at the Los Angeles federal court. The suit claims that "Viva la Vida" incorporates "substantial original portions" of his instrumental track "If I Could Fly" from his 2004 album Is There Love in Space?. The band has denied the allegation, saying the similarities were "entirely coincidental".<br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_la_Vid..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_la_Vid...</a>|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	I watched a FULL analysis on this whole situation a while ago and the songs share FAR MORE similarities than just some "Melody Line" <br>  <br>  The Tempo of the songs are similar, The Root Chords are Similar, and the Melody Lines are Similar. Joe had a GOOD CASE. He has enough money and enough projects to keep him much more busy than to pick on some UNORIGINAL band who has had other bands point out that they riped them off too WAY BEFORE Joe's case. I am a musician and I watched this and ITS CLEAR that Joe had a Valid Complaint. But the Musical Illiterates and Coldplay obsessed fans wont understand this video. So if you care to watch it here it is. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEGGFJLpbu4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEGGFJLpb...</a><br>  <br>  The fact is in any of these cases they are RARELY won by the complainant and most of the time written off as Coincidence. PERIOD

AA11601079	I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, and I would suggest it for nearly anyone over the age of 13 to see. It takes an interesting look at Indian society - the poverty, the stratification of wealth, prejudices, etc. Also, I'd suggest seeing it in the theaters since the scenery and the Bollywood dance sequence at the end of the movie probably wouldn't translate well to television. Yes, the movie is predictable in many ways, but it was still like nothing I'd ever seen before.

It's good, but to be frankly honest, i've seen many better films than it. I'm not even really sure what all of the hype is about. But anyways... Yes, it's worth a watch... Still, i've seen better...

6HyIkR7Caa	I didn’t like much; I was shocked when the movie got so many Oscars. I think slumdog millionaire got the Oscars and Bafta because it’s an English movie directed by an English director and produced by Hollywood. Had it been directed by an Indian it wouldn’t have got the awards. There are many Indian films that are more authentic and realistic than Slumdog. Movies like Wednesday, Mumbai Meri Jaan and parzania should also be sent to Oscar. I also liked Barah Aana an upcoming dark comedy film, which I happened to watch in Pune film festival. The film was amazing and everyone gave a very strong performance. You can read about the film here <a href="http://barah-aana-the-film.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://barah-aana-the-film.blogspot.com/</a>|`|AA11601079	I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, and I would suggest it for nearly anyone over the age of 13 to see. It takes an interesting look at Indian society - the poverty, the stratification of wealth, prejudices, etc. Also, I'd suggest seeing it in the theaters since the scenery and the Bollywood dance sequence at the end of the movie probably wouldn't translate well to television. Yes, the movie is predictable in many ways, but it was still like nothing I'd ever seen before. I'd give it a 8/10.|`|sMoKtO5Paa	Haven't seen yet but good news is that India was in the limelight at Oscar ceremony.<br>  <br>  "Jai Ho"|`|df69562ab23e3b5c7e250b6264e76a57aa	I loved it.<br>  Its just muuaahhhhhhhhhhhh|`|Z13dQrkuaa	yes......i love it.........|`|PzSI7EPEaa	It plays overtly on stereotypes of Indians. The complete opposite actually. Shows Americans as generous and Indias as people who'd not even give bread to a poor boy hanging off a train. It shows Hindus as some kind of monsters without even attempting to undertand the history of Hindu Muslim conflict. The movie appeals to western prejudices throwing in a call centre and the Taj Mahal for good measure.|`|UwK9jO5Naa	no!<br>  screenplay is nice direction is gr8 acting is superb and music is ok <br>  but hey.......<br>  India isnt such bad place.. is it<br>  after watching the movie it seems like India is worst place to be on earth and people of india specially hindus are all monsters they kill people of other communities without any reason they just do it<br>  its only gray.....|`|PnIO5uo9aa	yeah...it was a nice movie....fresh story, excellent actors, nice direction.<br>  it deserved oscars|`|vS9Y6Fgsaa	yeah the concept of the movie is good,but i hope was dull when compared to Taare zameen par and Lagaan for the oscars|`|fkrwcrRjaa	yeah excellent movie. deserves for an oscar.|`|2awj8ptIaa	yeah...i like it......i would be more happy if the film was directed by an indian.......|`|nT908vfzaa	nice movie....worth watching.|`|4UYEw7O3aa	nope|`|5W6Slhylaa	yes|`|TuGkVqwraa	Yes, one must love it, Its an Oscar awarded movie.

He didn't want his mother to walk with him.<br>  <br>  She wanted to give him the feeling that he had some independence but yet know that he was safe. So she had an idea on how to handle it.<br>  <br>  She asked a neighbor if she would please follow him to school in the mornings, staying at a distance, so he probably wouldn't notice her.  She said that since she was up early with her toddler anyway, it would be a good way for them to get some exercise as well, so she agreed.<br>  <br>  The next school day, the neighbor and her little girl set out following behind Timmy as he walked to school with another neighbor girl he knew.  She did this for the whole week.  As the two walked and chatted, kicking stones and twigs, Timmy's little friend noticed the same lady was following them as she seemed to do every day all week.  Finally she said to Timmy, "Have you noticed that lady following us to school all week?   Do you know her?"<br>  <br>  Timmy nonchalantly replied, "Yeah, I know who she is.." The little girl said, "Well, who is she?" "That's just Shirley Goodnest," Timmy replied, "and her daughter Marcy."<br>  <br>  "Shirley Goodnest? Who is she and why is she following us?" "Well," Timmy explained, "every night my Mom makes me say the 23rd Psalm with my prayers, 'cuz she worries about me so much.

The American thanked the priest and went along his way. <br>  <br>  Next stop was in Atlanta. There, at a very large cathedral, he saw the same golden telephone with the same sign under it. <br>  <br>  He wondered if this was the same kind of telephone he saw in Orlando and he asked a nearby nun what its purpose was. <br>  <br>  She told him that it was a direct line to Heaven and that for $10,000 he could talk to God. <br>  <br>  'O.K., thank you,' said the American . <br>  <br>  He then traveled to Indianapolis, Washington DC , Philadelphia , Boston and New York. <br>  <br>  In every church he saw the same golden telephone with the same '$10,000 per call' sign under it! <br>  <br>  The American, upon leaving Vermont decided to travel up to Canada to see if Canadians had the same phone. <br>  <br>  He arrived in Canada, and again, in the first church he entered, there was the same golden telephone, but this time the sign under it read '40 cents per call.' <br>  <br>  The American was surprised so he asked the priest about the sign.  'Father, I've traveled all over A merica and I've seen this same golden telephone in many churches. I'm told that it is a direct line to Heaven, but in the USthe price was $10,000 per call.  Why is it so cheap here?' <br>  <br>  The priest smiled and answered, 'You're in Canada now, son - it's a local call'. <br>  <br>  KEEP SMILING....

Technically, the second is a sequel, but you can watch them out of order without it being much of a problem.  I saw the second first and am glad I did!<br>  <br>  The movies mostly just consist of the conversations of two people who really connect with each other, and fall in love quickly.  The lovebirds are played by Ethan Hawk, and Julie Delpy.<br>  <br>  The second one, "Before Sunset" also has an interesting aspect about it in that it is filmed almost entirely in real time .  Meaning, that while a movie will usually cover many hours, days, or years in the two hours you watch, "Before Sunset" is 80 minutes long, and covers about 82 minutes in the lives of the characters (only one scene is cut slightly, as they walk off a boat).  Even when the characters are traveling, walking up to an apartment or driving to the next location, it is covered in full.  Granted, it's all about the conversation, which continues throughout!  The real time feel is also used in the first movie, though not as strictly.

I hate the fact that we always talk about big Actors like Sharukh, Salman, Amitabh and Aamir. Smaller and sometimes more deserving films or performances given by Actors like Naseeruddin Shah, Anupam Kher and Ompuri are missed out. Only the big actors get due recognition in Indian film Awards. Look at the performance of Naseerudin Shah in Wednesday. He’s a very deserving actor. I like his movies. I saw this upcoming movie Barah Aana at the film festival in Pune. Naseerudin Shah doesn’t speak much in the movie but his presence fills up the screen. The movie is a dark comedy revolves around three friends; the other two deserving actors are Vijay Raaz and Arjun Mathur in the movie.

z8jYprWkaa	I'm at this very minute watching it on tape - and I haven't got a clue what it's all about except that if they were to use a lot of bad language it would be a lot more realistic.

Some of their story lines have been really stupid and unbelievable.  The Garry being dead story was so silly you could see that one coming, Shirley and Hev are so unbelievable, the blonde girl who works with Stacey (she's so boring I've forgotten her name) is like a wet weekend in Oldham (sorry Oldham), Whitney is pathetic, the Massouds are pathetic and the whole sorry programme is pathetic!  Coronation Street knocks spots off EastEnders and at least Corrie has some humour.  And the story line last night was BORING!  Who cares what happened 50 years ago?  And wasn't it strange that The One Show did a feature about the West Indians coming to Britain in 1948 and then EastEnders does a story about Patrick, a West Indian, coming to Britain?  Talk about set up a story!

I honestly don't know what I would do.|`|DhmUgq0maa	Yes i would because he forgave me when i did it.<br>  <br>  You know how everyone says once a cheater always a cheater an they'll never change...it's not true in every case, i made a big mistake an cheated on my fiancee, i left him an then 3 months later we decided to get back together an work on it, It's 2 years later an i've never done it again and i never will (we are still together)...people make mistakes but people also learn from mistakes...if you love her and think you could forgive her an work on trusting her again then do it...although it will take you a while to fully trust her and she will have to prove to you that she deserves your trust and love...|`|aaMFREkiaa	like it sezx in the song of truth<br>  <br>  once a hoe always a hoe lol<br>  <br>  they did it once wats to say that they wnt do it agen?<br>  <br>  i forgave my ex nd he cheated on me not only wit my best m8 AGEN bu wit 17 otha gurls too!<br>  <br>  so yh forgive but dnt stick wit her she will do it agen nd i fink that u may already fink the same too if u look real deep inside<br>  <br>  xXxAmberxXx|`|Jusnu14oaa	um i would be mad but if u love the person you dont care about that u forgive and forget and just makes sure it doesnt happen again so you did the right thing|`|u2lYbPT2aa	I wouldn't have a partner that cheats!!!<br>  When you love someone, with all your heart...no one else interests<br>  you!!  I couldn't imagine going behind my boyfriends back, who I was so in love with, and being with someone else romantically!! I couldn't bear the fact of someone else touching me!!!...and what about the lies involved??? I couldn't lie to the one I share my love, and life with!!<br>  What would any kind of a relationship be with no trust???<br>  I'm totally not into sneaking around,,,slithering around like a snake, thinking I was clever...and making up lies about where I have been...etc.  That would be no relationship at all!! All the magic, and the specialness, and sacredness, would no longer exist...and you could hardly call it LOVE !!!  I would not give it a second thought..the relationship would be over...and I mean over!!!  Something is wrong with the picture!!!  You are so eager to take your so called girlfriend back, and forgive her, as if you think you could never get anyone else?? I would rather have no one, than a liar, and a cheater!! Look how cruel she has been to you, knowingly!!!  Someone who lies and cheats is bound to do anything else to you of that which is distasteful!!I'm sorry, but love is sacred to me...and if you are truly in love, you would only want the one you adore, to hold you so tight, and never let you go...while you are flying high, on cloud number 9!!!...and that feeling can last forever...but it is all taken away, by a cheater, and a liar!!!  I can't even imagine you so eager to take your girlfriend back~~~<br>  If she were mine, I couldn't even continue to even be friends!!<br>         My very best to you, and I wish you all the luck in all your adventures, and I pity you, for having a partner who has betrayed you, in the most serious ways!! I pity you for having a liar, and a cheater for a girlfriend, and you must prepare yourself for another round of unfaithfullness...because that is just the way cheaters and liars opperate!!  Good luck to you, my friend, and I am sorry you had to go through what you have experienced!!... <br>                    LOVE&LIGHT,  xoxo agoodgirl_msj<br>                                    Julie|`|aBALRxBUaa	I did.

yqe0I5zpaa	Yes, the movie is very good. It mixed romance with disturbing events and humor. That is the way that Danny Boyle directs his films, also the film has a great soundtrack. The movie's story is extremely compelling and it completely catches your attention throughout the movie. Dev Patel was great in the movie, he acted the film with such determination, he wasn't known and finally was able to let it out when it mattered, just like his character Jamal.|`|CddQ3LpEaa	it looks very good, i kinda wanna see other answers|`|AA12394465	its is a perfectly crafted  action packed romance story that will make you laugh and keep you entertained from beginning to end , please do go see it i seen 3 times now and would go again if i had time ( film student here )|`|f9440ee6f423d4970bad3c1e64047e3faa	Technically,it is good..u know the screenplay, shots,lighting,the story<br>  it is worth seeing trust me|`|UbC7S0U1aa	I can honestly say..

fzwsd1rqaa	I'm not sure what you can do exactly, but sometimes, if you use firefox& have the new firefox update, if you type in some tabs/keywords in the search bar which go with the story, like 'sasusaku' or 'naruhina' 'fanficion.net' ect., there should be a few options up. If you use internet explorer,  I'm not exactly sure, but you can try to find your Internet History. I'm not sure how though, sorry. But maybe you should use Firefox if you're currently using Internet Explorer, 'cause with firefox there's a tab at the top called 'History' then a button called 'Show All History', then you can type in something like 'fanfiction.net sasusaku naruhina' or something like that, and the search results come up.<br>  <br>  Sorry if that made no sense, but I hope you find what you're looking for.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.

Screw 'em if they can't see the humor and total normalcy in this situation!<br>  <br>  As for dealing with it? Ah, it is not a skill held private unto you. Everybody does and they all enjoy it and would be mortified if they got interrupted (actually, it would make me mad as hell--somebody screwing up the...um...finale!!).<br>  <br>  So, strut your stuff with chest out, head high, shoulders back and look 'em dead in the eye and challenge them with something like: "Yeah?

VoV7jGc3aa	I felt really bad for him last night. Almost his whole team was switched over to Jillian. I think that he felt really connected to this particular group of people this season. They work their tails off and are taking all the training and competition seriously. I think the reason why he got so emotional was not only because they switched teams, but the fact that in the back of his mind he knows that it is a game and ultimately his goal as a trainer will be to have his new team send home the people that he has been working with since the beginning and has become so close with.<br>  <br>  So even though he will be seeing them on the ranch, as most people have been pointing out, he will not be able to support them the way he has from the beginning and it is really sad.|`|WjuSuKjoaa	I was surprised that he took it as hard as he did, but I also understand his concern.  These people are not there just to play the game, they are there to save their lives.  As a viewer, I'm sure we all have our favorites, and we don't even get to work with them, so imagine how hard it is for the trainers to be helping these people work out their issues and help to save their life, only to be switched in the middle of their progress.  Like one of the blue team guys said last night, no offense to Jillian, but when you get in the groove of working with somebody, and trusting them, its hard to turn around and change everything.|`|k77zSmTTaa	I wonder if last night's episode is the reason they are looking for a new trainer.  Maybe Bob needs a Break from the Game Play.<br>  Bob does get emotionally attached to the people he takes care of and trains. <br>  (It is obvious if you have read his book)<br>  He has a connection to his team and he truly LOVES them and wants what is best for them. And yeah it would hurt me too if all of the sudden people were forced to be taken away from me.<br>  <br>  Imagine a Parent being Ripped from a Child and being shocked when their child is all of the sudden part of a new family. Yeah that would be hard on anyone.<br>  <br>  Bob is a wonderful Trainer and I hope he kicks the Yellow Team's *** just like he did with Joelle! Stop Whining and Do it.|`|AaknZ1RHaa	Yes, I cried too. It was nice to see the human side of things and that Bob was just so emotionally tells you what kind of person he it and how much he believes in his team.. Who wouldn't want him for a friend brother or coach?|`|Wwmi47TLaa	I felt so bad for Bob too. I know that Jillian does a great job with her teams, but there's just something about Bob that makes me like him so much more than her. He's such a compassionate guy and I feel like a change as big as this one just hit him really hard b/c not only did he have to deal with the loss of his team, but he also saw them having a really hard time struggling with the situation too and there was nothing he could do to help them--and helping them is his job! If I were in his position I'd probably feel exactly like him.|`|UriE3wN6aa	yeah it was sad , i started crying and hate the fact that the "brown" team got split up they really need each other|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	I love both trainers!  I think while your own the ranch you get comfortable with your trainer as well as them getting comfortable with you.  They do become family and it is hard, but I also think it will help them learn new and different ways of exercising and eating.  In the long run it will be good for the contestants.  Change is always hard, but after you get passed the difficult part you realize that it is also good.|`|klhFMdCgaa	Ugh. I half-considered fast-forwarding throught it, like Mark a couple seasons back asking to be voted out. I agree with Kal El too, they'll be seeing each other all the time, what is the big deal?? i think jillian got it right, bob does command an almost cult-like mentality in his team.|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	I agree with Kal-El, way too dramatic. I know it is hard to adjust to change but they are all on the same ranch, they didn't get sent home or go across the country. I love Bob and he is very emotional, that is what I really like about him, yet I think it was all a little over-done!|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	I might be wrong on this but they are all still on the same ranch right? Bob will still see his old team all the time- it's not like they are going away. I thought the whole thing was a bit over dramatic.

f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	I think a lot depends on the degree and who took it. I have a degree, but to be honest I think I learned more from life.

You tell me which one counts and if it is worth the effort and the paper it is written on.  Yep, hypo below is correct and I am probably the frozen crap he is talking of.  Bless his cotton socks.  There is no degree in 'inner-resourcefulness', but you need them to have both qualities and go further than the place you are now.  Onward....  do not keep looking at others or over your shoulder (that is when you will see the chip on it), onward...|`|yNi70a9Kaa	I'd wager a fair amount that a university degree is far more use than 'life experience' if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor old bean. However, I don't suppose they teach you how to negotiate life's many daily obstacles in lectures on the law of tort or the respiratory system. In short, the answer is neither counts for more, they both have benefits.|`|QEQmMZycaa	University of Life! They're worth while if they're going to be used, but I also know loads of people who have gone to Uni, taken degrees and Masters and they hold no use in their chosen careers!

nMYxyrzraa	One of my favorites is Mike Post very respected and should be given more full OST for some Epics and Blockbusters. But I love his style and works.  Maybe as a I grew up watching the many successful shows such as The Rockford Files, Hill Street Blues, The A-Team,, Magnum, CHiPs, Doogie Howser, Quantum Leap, City of Angels, etc and the theme music became very much catchy and memorable.<br>  <br>  I think his work is very clever with its use of popular music combined with excellent piano music, harmonious melodies, clarity of form and repeated rhythms structure.

NGNeT3rYaa	Good one, I had forgotten about Spencer!... and that would also explain why Roxy was so paranoid about it getting out last year. Why would she freak if it were David?... he is an ok guy, now Spence, was EVIL! I wouldn't want my son to know his dad either! Bo will be David's dad, it was confirmed in the magazines that he is and there is no doubt.|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	That thought has crossed my mind, too. I didn't really want Mitch to be Rex's dad, but I'm not sure I like the idea of Spencer being his dad either, but it does seem like a possibility. The thing that keeps coming back to my mind, though, is David being a good donor match for Jessica. That kinda puts Mitch back in the running for being the father of all concerned.....or does it?.......I'm a little confused *smile*......|`|ADBMrG87aa	I totally agree with you on Rex's father being Spencer Truman; that would explain why Roxy can't even utter his name and definitely more believable than Mitch Lawrence.<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|4sIyzL7Baa	Sounds good to me.  As weird as it seems, I liked Spencer as the villian.  He did such a great job.  I read that Mitch is not coming back.  I like your theory.  Good thinking!|`|pI5EAAUcaa	I think you've got the right answer there! <br>  I know I was in shock yesterday when they said that they were a match. Spencer would make more sense than David.

E2VUH8Q0aa	I have several, but I'm in the market for a new one. I have Mapping your Future/Birthchart software from Llwellyn, which is nice for beginners, but does nothing for other people.<br>  I had Janus 3.0 but it crashed....I don't know what was up with that one. I liked it but it kept conflicting with something else I had on my laptop.<br>  I tried World of Wisdom interpretative, and they were okay for basic stuff...<br>  <br>  I just want one that had a nice chart that will allow you to click on the specific sensitive points and give you all the aspects in the chart associated with it....<br>  <br>  <br>  **You should post this in the group. Sindy may have some good insite there. She helped write the Alabe software.|`|2VNmxfgpaa	I'm sorry I don't own a program, but after seeing what you were able to do with Magi Society software, I looked into it and some others.  I've relied on Astrodienst for years, but it's pitiful compared with the Magi Society charts.  It seems to me however that it's pricey - there should be an inexpensive program available that will do calculations to fit any astrologer's query.  I looked around in fact last week and I did not find one.  That was disappointing since clearly a program should simply get the calcuations done; the interpretation must be up to the astrologer.<br>  <br>  As with Tarot, it's what you do with your box of tools.  Sorry I couldn't provide insight into what's really out there...I would sure like to know as well!|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I don't have any of my own software. I'd rather buy a book on astrology.|`|6oASoFr7aa	itsa nnot that serious and probably wouldn't know how to use it.

That's it.|`|aebcd5ffa6c9392a532e65b6f0ca55c5aa	yeah, i got detention for not bringing the homework to math one day.<br>  it was my mom's signature, it's just less complicated than my dad's.|`|usIma0vIaa	no and yes.|`|81nGin29aa	Have y'all ever got in trouble for forging your parents' John/Jane Hancocks?

I kept a copy of her signature in my bag and all I did was write the note and then put her signature down with my note on top and trace her signature.|`|cuIX13BKaa	When I was in school I surely did!

However like jupiter is is highly doubtful it contains life as it is mostly Hydrogen and Helium.<br>   They have recently discovered a planet that is 15 light years away that some are referring as a "Super Earth as it circles a red dwarf star.<br>   I think a planet that is the farthest away from earth would be fine.|`|st2zmU88aa	Jupiter...|`|DDnxY3k1aa	planet furon|`|5mIhU9KAaa	pluto because it's the furthest away and we know little about it|`|BuujZKVLaa	cant refrain from answering this.... as a guy it is just too hard to pass up.....I'd love to explore Uranus|`|Zx8dDBY8aa	mars of course! everyone is already so interested in it right now.|`|Fe13vSvkaa	Pluto just because they said pluto isnt a planet anymore|`|2hx7eEtsaa	Mercury or Uranus j.k couldn't resist the joke, its Mercury|`|7wzEcAF7aa	the moon triton because they say that under all the ice there is liquid water :)|`|0hykdwBRaa	Jupiter because of all the crazy weather it has.

I did watch Pet Semetary when I was little and the Pascal guy scared me as well as the mother's sister that had spinal bifida or whatever it was that was wrong with her.|`|o0CrpEyfaa	I know you are gonna laugh, but i am kinda "older" so the first movie that scared me was "The Mummy".  That was the real old version in black and white. I made my mom look under my bed and in my closet before i went to bed...hahahaha.  Thinking about it now makes me laugh.|`|YWVCaIqmaa	Can't remember the title of the movie, but that scared me the most when I was about 11-12 years old. It was a drama where a mother died of AIDS.

After seeing that movie, every little shadow or noise in my room was suspicious.  <br>  <br>  My mother wouldn't let me see the movie because it was so scary, but I saw it at a friends house on HBO.  I realized too late that my mother was very wise and I should not have defied her!  ;-)<br>  <br>  By the way:  Candyman is awesome.  It didn't really scare me that much, but I was older when it came out.  (My best friend and I went home and said "Candyman" three times in the mirror after seeing it just to be funny.)  I'd put that movie in my list of "artistic" horror movies.   There were some horrible yet beautiful sequences in that film.|`|aEIMKBCDaa	The only thing that is scary about the omen is the fact that it is a kid killing people.

QGBYOLIxaa	I'm a Taurus and we're reserved, but not shy. We just kinda worry about our partner or anyone else's reaction so until we are comfortable we won't cut loose in front of you. But we're not so reserved that we won't drop hints. We drop hints left and right. LOL! You can tell when we are dropping hints because we always find a reason to touch you. Whether it's to tickle you, hug you, kiss your cheek or "accidentally" brushing our hand or some part of our body against yours. <br>  <br>  From experience, you should never play with your Taurus heart because we don't forgive easily. And if we do forgive you, you will forever be on trial till we deem it so. We will keep a watchful eye on you even when you think we are not. Most importantly, a Taurus is very logical and always is aware of situations that surround him. Even when you think we don't know, we do, we're just acting like we don't to see where you're going with it. If we don't forgive you, then you did something way too hurtful and you brought it upon yourself. We will cut you off and you might never hear from or see us again, BUT we will never forget you. We act like we don't love you, but even if we move on we always think of you. Maybe not every day, but for sure here and there.

AA10891467	You're right, both albums have been released with different album covers since their original release.<br>  <br>  Let's start with Roca-Rolla.<br>  <br>  The album was reissued in 1987 with a different cover. Reportedly the band was unhappy with the original cover art and logo, as it didn't fit with their image as a heavy metal band. There are also rumours that the Coca Cola Company brought legal pressure because the original album art too closely resembled their most famous brand. The re-issue cover art (By artist Mel Grant, and originally used as the cover for the novel The Steel Tsar) was also used for the US cover of Ballistix for the Turbo Grafx 16 and Commodore Amiga.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocka_Rolla" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocka_Rolla</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sad Wings of Destiny:<br>  <br>  Sad Wings of Destiny is the second album by the British heavy metal group Judas Priest, released in 1976.<br>  <br>  The cover art for the album, titled "Fallen Angels," was illustrated by Patrick Woodroffe. It is best known for introducing the pitchfork-like symbol known as the "Judas Priest Cross," as worn by the angel. [1]<br>  <br>  Sad Wings of Destiny was Judas Priest's second and final studio record made while under contract with Gull Records, an independent U.K. company. Despite critical acclaim, the band was struggling financially due to lack of support from the label. Shortly after changing management, the band severed their ties with Gull and signed with Columbia Records. Consequently, Judas Priest lost all rights to the recordings on their first two albums and to all demo recordings made during the sessions while under contract with Gull Records.[2] Sad Wings of Destiny was initially published and distributed by Janus Records in the United States.[3]<br>  <br>  While the band lost the rights to recording royalties, they obtained copyright ownership of the songs themselves, many of which became staples for their live shows. Victim of Changes, The Ripper, Tyrant, and Genocide appear on Judas Priest Unleashed in the East, a 'live' album released by CBS, in 1979. Diamonds and Rust, a Joan Baez song originally recorded for Sad Wings, but left off of the final album, was re-recorded for Sin After Sin, their first CBS release, and also on Unleashed. Gull Records later released the band's original recording of Diamonds and Rust on a 'best of' album.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Wings_of_Destiny" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Wings_o...</a><br>  <br>  Summary:<br>  It looks like both of the lbums album covers changed when they were re-released on their new label.  Judas Priest was getting a really raw deal with Gull records so they sought another label to produce them.  However, to this day, Gull records continues to sell the first two albums that they recorded for JP making money off of the Priest while JP themselves reap no monies whatsoever from the sales of Gull's releases.<br>  <br>  You might also find this interesting, it is at the bottom of the page of the OFFICIAL Judas Priest discography page:<br>  <br>  Gull Records through many subsiduary companies are releasing sub standard re-hashes of these 1st two albums under different guises. If for instance anyone out there has bought their "JUDAS PRIEST - THE BEST OF" - Insight Series, then they would find that 50% of the album consists of a mindless interview with John Hinch an ex-drummer with Priest who we had to let go because he was musically inadequate. The interview is not only misleading but full of rubbish and false information. <br>  <br>  They, however have cleverly track listed the back cover so it appears that other band members are involved and as though it contains new material. It's just one example of how Gull Records are greedily continually exploiting and misleading the fans out there and unfortunately we cannot control it or stop them - but we can strongly advise you not to waste your money buying tracks you will already have under the original album titles. They have nothing new to offer and are just trying to cash in on the Priest name - so check out any CD with their name on it before buying. <br>  <a href="http://www.judaspriest.com/disc/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.judaspriest.com/disc/default....</a><br>  <br>  **One more thing you might find interesting, I personally have Sad WIngs of Destiny on a special LP record. This particular album has NO typical cardboard cover!  It came in a see through vinyl sleeve.  The album art and credits are both imprinted directly upon the record itself.  It's an incredibly striking visual piece of artwork. Here's a picture of one just like it:<br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/SEALED-JUDAS-PRIEST-SAD-WINGS-OF-DESTINY-uk-PICTURE-LP_W0QQitemZ400032436495QQcmdZViewItemQQptZMusic_on_Vinyl?hash=item400032436495&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=72%3A1205%7C66%3A2%7C65%3A12%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318%7C301%3A0%7C293%3A1%7C294%3A50#ebayphotohosting" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/SEALED-JUDAS-PRIEST-...</a>

ZzqWzFNiaa	Good morning Dave.<br>  Chris Martin I suppose pulls it off, but to me he looks more like an insurance salesman.<br>  <br>  **************<br>  Great call Rckts. Great photo to sell it too. It's really appropriate too with the way he approaches all of it.<br>  He is actually still around. He's in this group called the Evens that is pretty cool, at least I think they're still around. I only have the first record, but I like it.<br>  <br>  **********<br>  Hey man. I forgot to mention, one of the things he's been up to lately that I think is really cool is going to libraries and doing Q&As (from what I understand it's about trying to get people to the library at all). I didn't see the tour of them that he was on a few months ago (heard about the local one the day after it happened), but I saw him do one at Coachella a few years back and it was really, really great. He may still do stuff like that from time to time.|`|d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	Number one with a bullet.......Ian MacKaye.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ian_MacKaye_at_the_Brooklyn_Book_Festival.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ian_Ma...</a><br>  <br>  Just a regular guy who really needs to get back in the business of making music.<br>  <br>  Prof - Hey, man!

Then again, Eric Clapton looks pretty normal nowadays too.  I went to a Clapton concert a few years ago, and Eric was wearing a black tee shirt with some khaki pants.  Very normal looking.|`|NQ37mnWkaa	Actually, I'm going to *disagree* about Robert Palmer, because if you look at some of the pictures of him in the early days, whilst he was with Vinegar Joe, he *does* look like a rocker! The 'sharp suit' image of his solo career I think reflects that he had moved beyond just Rock, into incorporating Blues, Soul, and Jazz into his music. <br>  <br>  Also, that style was quite 'in' in the late 1970s ~ Lindsey Buckingham often wore a suit on both the "Tusk" and "Mirage" tours...<br>  <br>  <br>  But, just to be annoying, I'm going to say 'Mr Sharp-Suit' : Bryan Ferry<br>  Insurance salesman...?|`|AA10620246	Rivers Cuomo (lead singer of Weezer).

From the 20yo downwards.  It is an Australian book and tell the story of a clean little house which gets dirty occupants who end up making it sneeze.  The family and pets are blown into the garden by the force.  It has the build up to the SNEEZE and the kids adored it, the little ones still doing so.  It is in rhyme so I believe quietly introduced them to the wonderful sound of poetry. It ends ' So they moved far away from the house that had sneezed.  They were very annoyed, but the house was quite pleased.'  And there, on the page, is the smiling little house.  Very satisfying for a child.  There is also a little mouse to find on every page.

hJP9y6kjaa	It's not incredibly easy, and it takes some time to do it so it sounds good, and lots and lots of time to make it sound great, but sure, it can be done.<br>  <br>  You'll need a microphone and a USB interface, one that has ASIO drivers. This isn't optional, you need ASIO drivers so you can monitor what you record in real time.<br>  <br>  I use Reaper as my multitracking program, and hit up kvr audio for most of my plugins.<br>  <br>  Off the top of my head, you're going to want to download Slayer 2... it's the best electric guitar emulator I've ever heard. It isn't free, to use it freely you'll need to buy it, but it's the best of its type for the money that I've found... I'm big on being cheap/free/inexpensive, so if you find something that actually is better for less, feel free to email me, cuz I'm betting you won't. It should also have decent bass sounds, too.<br>  <br>  I've used a few different drum machines, but Drumatic 3 is the one I've been using the most. What I'll do is layer two or more drum machines over the top of each other, with slightly different settings, and insert EQ or compression fx in between or after as necessary. It's the best way *so far* I've found to get realistic sounds without having to plunk down chunks of change for commercial products (ie DFH - drummer from hell, etc). Alternatively or additionally, getting good samples is another good way to go.<br>  <br>  Honestly, that's the basics. You'll probably want a convolution program (like SIR) for reverb and acoustic treatments to the various instruments, and plenty of time spent googling for said impulse responses (try googling "download mesa boogie guitar cab impulse response" for instance).<br>  <br>  Well, it's a start. Most of the time that's what I spend my lunches doing - composing music on my laptop - so my advice is from personal experience.<br>  <br>  The hardest parts are learning how to equate the piano roll and rhythm notation with the notes and timing you hear. Learning how to read music is a really good place to be, as it can help provide you examples of everything from drum beats to vocal melodies to harmonies, etc. Tab isn't as good for it in this case, because it doesn't indicate *timing*.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul
e458b49846d0cdbd9493a27ec2896b94aa	The best software would be Cubase.<br>  And you would need an audio interface. <br>  You would need a good High speed computer too preferably used for nothing else.  And MAC is better than PC for these applications.
tbOwduLlaa	I'm a professional singer and i would say try not est eat at least two hrs before. Sometimes it's not possible to have have that gap so avoind dairy products, fizzy drinks, sugary sweet things like chocolate, ice. caffeine,spicey,and for some people bananas. Basically any foods that can make your throat feel sticky avoid and spice and cold things like ice. Another reason for not singing on a full stomach is that over along period of time it could cause a hiatus hernia which is like a small whole in the lining of the stomach. It happens because to much pressure is  causes the stomach to tighten and the food gets forced into the wrong places. This in turn turns into problems with indegestion which is terrible for the throat. If you have to eat just before singing just have something light.|`|hVuPqHzsaa	Garlic|`|T5DbLLgQaa	Also, avoid any spices and caffeinated drinks as well as dairy products prior to singing!|`|58UB5lqRaa	you can eat any thing you want, just dont eat any thing that will make you burp while you are singing.<br>  Its what you drink that can stop you from singing, dont drink any thing milky as it forms phlegm on your throat. drink water i always have a bottle handy while performing, as your throat can dry up.<br>  also throat lozenges are handy for in between breaks.keeps your throat<br>  moisturiesed|`|t2evcVVEaa	hi. im a record producer for Geffen Records and id like to asnwer your question.

Most actually. If for other reasons you must eat, avoid the following:<br>  <br>  Dairy<br>  Bananas<br>  Peanut Butter<br>  Citrus<br>  <br>  A few hours before you sing, you should eat lots of protein!|`|uRF6jP3Naa	Spicy foods, cold drinks, anything that makes your stomach uncomfortable.<br>  Also follow the advises above not to eat heavy stuff before performing, will work for sure.|`|TeVp7rgUaa	uumm well...<br>  i was asking this question at wiki too lol<br>  <br>  ebrybody says not to drink milk...orange juice b4 singing cuz it blocks our vocal chord and and and...about jam sandwitch ,.,,itz fine ..~^^|`|rsWO3Xl0aa	All dairy foods as they clog your throat x|`|e458b49846d0cdbd9493a27ec2896b94aa	No Dairy and no alcohol.<br>  Spicy food is good.

ctglkb4Paa	you should be around 5'8 to 5'9|`|9teAbDMJaa	That depends on your genetics, and your environment, but my best guess would be yeah. <br>  Males continue to grow into their twenties. My cousin ended high school at 5'10" but in college, shot up to 6'5" pretty suddenly<br>  <br>  The charts the doctor's give out when you're born are almost never accurate, to my knowledge. Mine said I would be 6'2", but I stopped growing at 5'6". My little brothers said 5'10" and he's already beyond 6 feet.|`|rIWS6YjPaa	There is no real way to tell. I'd ask your mom what your chart looks like from your pediatrician. They make a chart for you when you're first born, and it's a pretty accurate predictor of how tall you'll get. Remember what they said in health class though, puberty does not technically end until sometime in your early 20s. Good luck man.|`|AA11536708	Men can keep growing well into their twenties, so you never know.  My best friend kept growing till he was 31!!|`|M8f4BorPaa	the most u could gow is 5'6|`|8ZUVToXgaa	No, you're not done growing.

He then spent split time between Senegal and America until he was 15, and then permanently moved to Jersey City, New Jersey.[14] He recorded his first song, "Operations of Nature", at the age of fifteen.[citation needed] Akon began writing and recording tracks in his home studio. The tapes found their way to SRC/Universal, which released Akon's debut LP Trouble in June 2004. The album is a hybrid of Akon's silky, West African-styled vocals mixed with East Coast and Southern beats. Most of Akon's songs begin with the sound of the clank of a jail cell with him uttering the word "Convict".<br>  <br>  Personal life<br>  Akon has been rumored to have three wives, but recently has said to only have one.[28][29] Akon nominally belongs to the Sunni sect of Islam. Both his parents are Muslim.[citation needed] It has been reported that he is both a believer and practitioner of polygamy, though such reports are unconfirmed, as Akon has not given a straight answer to questions about the matter.[30][8] Polygamy is illegal in the United States of America and in many Muslim countries[citation needed]. He claims to have five children with three different women in an interview with Blender.[31]<br>  <br>  He also has his own charity for underprivileged children in Africa called Konfidence Foundation.[32] Akon owns a diamond mine in South Africa and denies the existence of conflict diamonds, saying, "I don't even believe in conflict diamonds. That's just a movie. Think about it. Ain't nobody thought about nothing about no conflict diamonds until the movie came out."[33] He also allegedly had a previous occupation as a drug dealer but has stated in interviews that he's never used drugs, though some of his lyrics would suggest otherwise. Despite his alleged criminal history, he proclaims that he has turned his life around.<br>  <br>  In 2006, he ventured to Africa to play a concert in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania<br>  <br>  Albums :-  Trouble · Konvicted · Freedom <br>   <br>  Singles :-  "Locked Up" · "Ghetto" · "Lonely" · "Belly Dancer (Bananza)" · "Pot of Gold" · "Smack That" · "I Wanna Love You" · "Don't Matter" · "Mama Africa" · "Sorry, Blame It on Me" · "Never Took the Time" · "I Can't Wait" · "Right Now (Na Na Na)" · "I'm So Paid" · "Troublemaker" <br>   <br>  Featured singles :-  "Find Us" · "Keep on Calling" · "Baby I'm Back" · "Soul Survivor" · "Moonshine" · "Girls" · "Snitch" · "I Am Not My Hair" · "The Sweet Escape" · "I Tried" · "We Takin' Over" · "Bartender" · "The Way She Moves" · "Speaker" · "Sweetest Girl (Dollar Bill)" · "Graveyard Shift" · "Hypnotized" · "Get Buck in Here" · "Certified" · "I'll Still Kill" · "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' 2008" · "What You Got" · "Dangerous" · "Frozen" · "What's Love" · "Out Here Grindin"  · "Body on Me"  · "Am I Dreaming" · "Wake It Up" <br>   <br>  Related articles :- Discography · Awards and nominations|`|lnRMmSeyaa	i like his music but idk anything about his life so idk|`|xuR8YkQlaa	Akon is awesome love him LOL|`|f2Lcv80faa	Yep, yep.

quIDrXktaa	Hey Reagon, you seem to hang in the rap/hiphop questions. Feeling a little threatened by the rock crowd saying rap is c*rap? Ignore 'em.You've just dropped to their level.<br>  <br>  But yep, rock, and all music, especially the genres that came after rock are overrated garbage - don't you just love it?<br>  <br>  Peace onya.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Oh snap homie, you really punked us with this.<br>  <br>  I must ask though, are you just naturally this creative?  We haven't heard something like this before, like ever.|`|SoF1F4uJaa	I agree with Nicky James<br>  <br>  <br>  All aboard the failboat, and you're the captain|`|vyHe3Lfdaa	I'm sorry.  What's the question?<br>  <br>  If it is if I think if rock is overrated garbage or not?<br>  If so my answer is no.|`|F2ygsPEbaa	The answer to your "question" would be, uh, no.<br>  <br>  I personally don't care what others think.  My self esteem isn't dependent on your approval of my musical tastes.<br>  <br>  What exactly was your point here other than to try and push people's buttons?|`|tG5Ar7DIaa	Most mainstream modern rock, I think you forgot to specify.  Because you couldn't be just generalizing the entire genre...<br>  <br>  What do you like if you don't like rock?|`|34f58d193a1c27340e8401a3848c8c53aa	Well if that is the question, Then I must say no that it is not.|`|AA12093934	Great, and your point is????|`|C9NPv1WPaa	Well if you want my opinion on the subject.....uhh..no|`|t2evcVVEaa	FAIL|`|gJ8F634Haa	get a life|`|372458a63fdf2cfd5035da966e6ddf39aa	What!?|`|cYgxTWDVaa	You can't really say a genre is overrated garbage, the term "overrated" applies more so to bands/artists. A certain rock artist(mostly mainstream stuff) can be overrated garbage for example.<br>  <br>  I might get what you're saying here though as a lot of people have been in the "all rap is crap" mood lately so I guess some of us are being hypocritical.|`|2WBs0QiXaa	Lmao great joke dude.<br>  <br>  Compare this to all the 'rap is crap' questions. <br>  <br>  And U guys accuse the music industry for being shallow.... Not all rap is bad.<br>  <br>  I'm no rap fan though. And good music lies simply in it's beat. Take it easy guys ... Music is just existing fir us to enjoy...|`|xVXLhP0laa	theres at least 1 song of every genre that u may or may not admit to likin its tru my man<br>  <br>  so dont hate|`|AA10871748	then don't listen to it nobody is twisting your arm. by the way what was the question you only made a comment?|`|AgQForcYaa	Yes, post that on a ROCK FORUM, YA DUMBSHIT. Good luck getting people to agree with you there!|`|gA3K2sKUaa	i like some rock  like alt rock and stuff but  other than that im a hip hip girl.|`|3QtO3SpFaa	Are you kidding me? Listen to The Beatles "White Album", and then say that again.|`|j6Sv8eWYaa	haha technically hes not saying that.. as its a question so we dont know his actual opinion.. but if you do think that. then stop genre bashing..|`|APNLYQgoaa	-.-|`|UdoLcwm4aa	...but I like it.|`|AGP2dI6uaa	Oh, you want beef?|`|M7E1uIsKaa	booooo!  go away troll!|`|XhJuHMwQaa	probably

N6VykHCFaa	practice makes perfect.<br>  singing lessons?|`|gROdxDhRaa	you cant you either got or ya dont|`|57JufnCIaa	there's many things you can do on your own, but your best bet would be to take lessons. if you smoke...quite. drink a lot of water to keep your mouth and throat moist. do little excercises such as singing the alphabet in different tunes. dont play an instrument. and dont try too hard while singing because it always sounds worse. go with the flow. good luck|`|PR8i6cV8aa	What I was taught to do and helps me is to streach out my diaphram. How to do that is take in a deep breath and hold it. Only for a little while. Make sure you chest is streached out. Then exhale slowly. Keep standing/sitting straight though.<br>  That should help if I described it right.<br>  <br>  Would you try to answer my question. Nobody has yet and I really need one.|`|rsWO3Xl0aa	Well, I take singing lessons. What you need to do is vocal exercises, breathing exercises and warm up exercises. Make sure when you are singing your jaw just drops, but don't force it. When you are singing, sing with a straight back x<br>  Hope I've helped x|`|AMI8oQMDaa	Lessons.

The Cure's Gothic Phase includes the albums Seventeen Seconds (1980), Faith (1981), and Pornography (1982).  These three albums are known as the "Gothic Trilogy."  <br>  <br>  Here are my top 5 in no particular order:<br>  <br>  Seventeen Seconds<br>  The Holy Hour<br>  The Funeral Party<br>  Siamese Twins<br>  Cold|`|cLTbby44aa	I just listened to Faith a few days ago, I'm blown away by it. I think it could be a potential fave. <br>  <br>  Anyway, to answer your question:<br>  <br>  1. Cold <br>  2. All Cats Are Grey<br>  3. Play For Today <br>  4. Secrets <br>  5. A Short Term Effect / Doubt<br>  <br>  I love the Cure's dark trilogy. It's great to see that they have so much variety in their sound, but somehow always manage to stick to their roots.  Doubt is great, it could have easily blended in with the songs on Disintegration, for example.|`|AA12301664	the best era for the cure - by far<br>  <br>  a forest<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HY7wuV_C1oI&feature=PlayList&p=FED743DA96414DAF&playnext=1&index=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HY7wuV_C1...</a><br>  <br>  the hanging garden<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPs5kOy1edM&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPs5kOy1e...</a><br>  <br>  primary<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENnQKym0htQ&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENnQKym0h...</a><br>  <br>  all cats are grey<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpgNx89B8Y4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpgNx89B8...</a><br>  <br>  faith<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-ll36koaeY&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-ll36koa...</a>|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	1.

0d8vPBMwaa	I would say Hot Topic. I don't know much about the Borders one but at Hot Topic, you get some kind of special picture with it and invitations to their release party for you and some friends. I believe the DVD itself is the same wherever you go.|`|PzReqI4jaa	hot topic probably|`|KxxUfR7Zaa	<a href="http://offto.net/PornMovies/" rel="nofollow">http://offto.net/PornMovies/</a>|`|751mdpcBaa	yeah those are good; but walmart will more than likely be cheaper there; its only $22 there!|`|qJ9o3iQnaa	I'm not sure if this is the case where you are, however in my town Blockbuster is the only store that is getting the Special two disc edition.  They are are also taking pre-orders for the movie so you are guaranteed a copy when it comes out.  I suggest you do this,  I work at blockbuster and we've had ALOT of pre-orders.  You only have to put $5 down and it goes towards the purchase of the movie.<br>  Blockbuster is also staying open late on march 20/21st. So the friday march 20th blockbuster will be calling people who reserved the movie and let them pick it up at midnight on 3/21.|`|l0YvaYTDaa	I know that Blockbuster was advertising something the last time I was in, but I don't remember what it was.  You might want to check it out.

These projectiles are not made to harm or damage others, but to simply ignite a fight filled with spontaneous food throwing. Food fights may be impromptu examples of rebellion or violence, however, they can also be planned events. For example, La Tomatina is a regularly held, organized Spanish food fight in which participants pelt each other with tomatoes. In organized food fights, the food "weapons" are usually all of one kind, or of a limited variety. An impromptu food fight will use whatever food is on hand.<br>  <br>  Food fights are a common element in slapstick comedy, with the pie in the face gag being especially prominent. Food fights are frequently featured in children's television and books, usually as an example of destructive or reckless behaviour. One famous food fight scene in a movie took place in National Lampoon's Animal House. Another took place in Hook.<br>  <br>  Though usually associated with juvenile settings such as schools, there are notable incidents that take place in more refined locations, such as the food fight at a lunch meeting of the Legislative Yuan of Taiwan.[1] In Europe, some food fights evolved into traditional celebrations rooted either in recent past such as the Spanish Tomatina or in long-gone centuries such as the Battaglia degli aranci during the Ivrea Carnival in Italy.|`|GZ9LjS13aa	If i want to win, an apple at a speed of 12.3 miles an hour, it knocks someone out and it also blows up and hits people in their eyes muahahaha!|`|RzQ8S3Haaa	spagetti|`|5bCudkAVaa	uhh, milk carton and the milk inside, you can spill the milk on someone and use the carton to throw it on someone|`|f1c1c8dafe8cc85d8807ccbdff4a484baa	shishkabobs|`|Gh9X70efaa	A watermelon for heavy assualt.

h1IYS0dbaa	It's a great movie and it deserved the awards it got.|`|yqe0I5zpaa	Well, just because your Indian doesn't mean you should automatically like Slumdog Millionaire, i'm American and i don't like every American movie that comes out every year. Second, the movie was great, it came from an acclaimed novel Q&A. The adapted script easily deserved the Oscar, it was very true to the source material and a very good cinematic read. The sound mixing and music were great, all those Oscars were well deserved. Danny Boyle deserved Best Director, that film was directed with such pride and energy. It was able to mix romance with horrifying sequences of death and disturbing content and also mix in some humor. That is Boyle's style and this Oscar was way overdue. It deserved Best Picture, Milk was good, Frost/Nixon was boring, The Reader was too controversial, the film wasn't very good and finally The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button was too long and flawed. Slumdog Millionaire deserved Best Picture. Get a life, your Indian and even you though it didn't deserve 8 Oscars, wow, just wow.|`|rFoKf7ieaa	Stop shouting. You're entitled to your opinion as is everyone. I thought it was a very good movie, although 8 Oscars is a bit much. It was a feel-good movie, it's meant to give people hope so they leave the theatre happy and content; these movies always do well. By the way, I hope reality is not a prerequisite for a good film for you, you might be disappointed.|`|WG7cHwIOaa	i saw it before all the oscars hype and i loved it. i cannot compare it to any other Hindi movies as i have not seen any, but i work at a cinema and i can tell you it was definately better than almost (or all) other western movies that came out over the past year|`|AM33tqYAaa	finally someone agrees with me|`|ehIsuFAmaa	yeah.|`|x07BC6bCaa	Slumdog Millionaire is one of the best movies ever made (seen through the eyes of fellow europeans), it has adventure, comedy and some romance, and not to mention it tells a really good story, most of the ppl here in my country love it....I don't know about India tho....|`|51H2omf5aa	Slumdog is a beautiful film.<br>  <br>  As per its Oscar wins this isnt due to amazing acting, but due to the production values..<br>  <br>  The cinematography is amazing, the soundtrack is banging, the direction is first class!<br>  <br>  This film deserved everything it got and more!|`|UdoLcwm4aa	Overhyped is putting it mildly.|`|yRAU9MJDaa	I would wager that 90% of the actors who voted for it never saw the movie.|`|ksnnaOZVaa	this movie was overhyped but i still like it so good for them for getting 8 oscars|`|EJA5tpxpaa	yes.|`|NG75ZaCMaa	joke topic|`|cU1MxE8Paa	First of all, please stop shouting, for God's sake.<br>  <br>  It is very annoying, considering you've asked similar question with capital letters before. Not to mention the bad grammar. For someone who asks people to think properly before they answer, can't you do the same yourself when you ask questions?<br>  <br>  Second of all, what do you mean by "biased answers"? <br>  <br>  You either like the movie or not. The fact that it's well-received shouldn't lessen your enjoyment of the movie, neither should it make you hate the movie any more than you apparently do.<br>  <br>  I watch Hindi movies. They're good- for entertainment purposes, but perhaps most importantly escapism. While it is arguable that there are better Hindi movies out there, the fact is that very, VERY few of them showed the real India.( Watch any mainstream hindi movie without a knowledge of India and you'll leave thinking that everyone is there rich and/or impossibly good-looking) "Slumdog" at least displayed part of it.<br>  <br>  But if it's REALITY that you want, watch a documentary.<br>  <br>  Every country in the world has its share of rich as well as poor people; the beautiful as well as the girl/boy next door. When nobody from our own kind chooses to show this reality, why bring all the noise when somebody else did it?<br>  <br>  As for the "speciality" (guess you meant qualities) of the movie, here goes:<br>  <br>  It's got Indian actors, but different than most Indian movies. It's exciting. Touching. Suspenseful.Uplifting. Pretty much most things you could ask for from a movie.<br>  <br>  For the record, I like it. It's been a long time since I was last excited and elated by a movie. Yes, it has its flaws, but considering the other movies it was nominated with, "Slumdog Millionaire" beats them by a mile. So yes it deserved to win all those awards.<br>  <br>  There. That's my non-biased answer.|`|7KXNmD7caa	Garbage.
217b09cad4499d84073afef0392b44b2aa	Personally, I found the music more emotionally stirring in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. <br>  <br>  Please don't post in capitals- it's like your screaming at use|`|TLzknS0eaa	You can't ignore the Indian market which actually makes more movies per annum than Hollywood-Hollywood finally had to acknowledge Bollywood;above all it was good for the industry all round.|`|6CAsx3jaaa	i wondered when i saw that there were only 3 nominees  what happened. in years past there were usually 5 or more great songs and usually there would be some songs that were big hits. there is a lot of good music indian an otherwise. in this case he may have gotten the award for his body of work. if im not mistaken though last year had two songs from enchanted a bruce springsteen song and a couple of others . where were all the great movie songs?|`|cLkB9ukRaa	i think he really deserve for it.........<br>  yaa u r right k he composed much  better song for other movie as well.....<br>  but he got for slumdog its not bad atall yaar......u can take it as the life time achivement of him........he is really a master yaar<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  we should feel proude k a indian has won oscar..............|`|livxaHf8aa	well he did compose all the music within a week?<br>  so i say its pretty amazing.<br>  but i guess thats true, he might've nt deserved it compared to english films, but im happy.|`|H7n1P5dgaa	well,he deserved it.....<br>  but comparing to other music he has done.....he doesnt deserve the oscar for this movie......english films u say huh?......im not sure.....|`|Hv5yNWIbaa	I agree about the caps, it's like you're screaming.<br>  <br>  And yes, I do think he think he deserved it. Though they may not be his best, they were /the/ best in when compared to the other nominees.|`|S2nN4zBnaa	ya... there are many music directors as like him doing a best job all over... But its should be important that how long they giving this... I accept ARR had a g8 composings before from tamil and hindi movies... But SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE it was a words beyond.... ya i like his vande mataram song very much i will say that his best also... But his music in slumdog takes that film so far....tat film got Oscar award also.. then no more award to given than the oscar... What he done in that movie had a great timing and sense to the film tat is important for the music director,,,,,, UPto me.. wat he done on that movie is simply amazing... Am really sure no music director in hollywood wont get any oscar,,,, All those will be to ARR... if he got chance to compose to all hollywood... definitely he will trash all oscars............. ARR is GREAT|`|UmE81BFnaa	Most claim ARR's SM tracks aren't that bad, but "not as bad" means wat??? put it simply, it means it's not at all among the level of the best tracks composed. Actually the west has always envied Bollywood's excellent music n dance, so, they couldn't present awards to Anu Malik,Shankar,Anand Milind or to Indian directors many of whose films were 1000.... times better than slumdog.<br>  And wat's the use of giving Oscar to a film which is a full imitation of Indian oldies like Deewar,Hum kisi se kum nahin.. yes, seriously speaking, if u see the movie carefully, it presents a complete deja-vu of the past 30 yr Bollywood productions. So, in effect, the West has approved the 30 yr old films of India which till now haven't been noticed by them... it grossly shows how ignorant these Oscar voters are. Anyway, I hve never considered Oscar to be any different to IIFA Awards, basically all are purely commercial n trash.|`|YrHHQI79aa	Slumdog is a bullshit, OSCAR is rubbish n AR Rahman's O Saaya n jai Ho r filthy trash for Indians who have heard some brilliant music compositions by Anu Malik,Jatin-Lalit, Shankar Mahadevan,RD Burman.... <br>  To be frank, ARR has also been dishonest in claiming that there has not been a single Indian director who has been able to make a film lke Slumdog... Hve you all 4gotten Salaam Bombay? Hve u also 4gotten better n more appealing Indian films like Fashion,Kalyug,Black, Mission kashmir,Border,Rang de Basanti? This hype over ARR only shows how forgetful Indians are of their own glorious achievements. Through Slumdog, the west has vehemently ridiculed India, it's a pity to see Indians rejoicing at this!!!!

Size encompasses life. The child, who is most at home with wonder, says: Daddy, what is above the sky? And the father says: The darkness of space. The child: What is beyond space? The father: The galaxy. The child: Beyond the galaxy? The father: Another galaxy. The child: Beyond the other galaxies? The father: No one knows."<br>  <br>  "Or one might take the tip of the pencil and magnify it. The pencil tip is not solid; it is composed of atoms which whirl and revolve like a trillion demon planets. What seems solid to us is actually only a loose net held together by gravity. Viewed at their actual size, the distances between these atoms might become league, gulfs, aeons. The atoms themselves are composed of nuclei and revolving protons and electrons. One may step down further to subatomic particles. And then to what? Tachyons? Nothing? Of course not. Everything in the universe denies nothing; to suggest an ending is the one absurdity."<br>  <br>  "Imagine the sand of the Mohaine Desert, and imagine a trillion universes - not worlds but universes - encapsulated in each grain of that desert; and within each universe an infinity of others. With one swing of your boot you may knock a billion billion worlds flying off into darkness, a chain never to be completed."<br>  <br>  I shortened the quotes slightly as they had Dark Tower reference irrelevant to the discussion.|`|srtegXpMaa	Yeah, but not always :D

PfRKvM3Baa	Like one of the earlier answers says, reading is one of your best bets. I try to read a new book or play every week. Bring in a lot of variety into your reading because that will allow you to see what works for each author, making it easier to pick out what you like. You might like something about Greek tragedy, but there could be some elements you don't like. Make note of these, and try to incorporate what you like into your work. <br>  You should get a journal-I use a spiral bound notebook-to record your daily activities or routines. I try to be as detailed as possible when trying to write about experiences, and that helps me see what needs trimming. When you read one of your new books, write down what you like about it. I have found that the only way to develop your own voice is to see how the best writers find theirs.<br>  It takes a lot of practice, but you will start noticing changes if you analyze what you read.<br>  Best of luck to you.|`|QbcnDDxUaa	you can start with magazine "Readers Digest"..it has long been credited for flawless english and has all types of articles which widen your thinking to write on any subject.. they have several tasks to improve upon your word power. rest u can read newspapers daily and write what you have understood from it. then show it to your teacher or elder so that they can help you improve. best of luck|`|XBdsonrnaa	There may be some journalism websites online that will give you pointers or even books that talk about it.<br>  <br>  Its probably a case of just looking around for something simple that covers all the basics.<br>  <br>  If you would like any specific advice tho, feel free to ask :)|`|FZ0hwowaaa	Reading is the best way to improve your writing. Select good books  and read...you will realize how you improve.

Not at all. Sometimes I am scared to watch certain horror movies, so I don't watch them at all. I am scared to get on a ferris wheel, so I don't get on one at all. I am scared of being robbed by a thug or killed by a deranged serial killer at night, so I make sure not to travel too much at night because I don't like to travel in fear. I am scared to go to a predominantly Muslim country, so I know I will never travel to parts of the Middle East. If I know that I will be scared put in a situation of all that I have mentioned, then I minimize that anxiety by not doing any of those things.|`|bIouq64Oaa	Not really. It's kind of... well... scary. :D I know that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. What I mean is, when you're actually scared for your life or something, I don't know who would enjoy that. When you're in a scary movie or something, and you get freaked out, that's different. People pay money to be that type of scared.|`|Wpulf29Maa	Yeah, I think it's kind of cool.....the weird feeling. I like turning off every light in my house and watching a scary movie late at night by myself.

aAj4dSyuaa	I'm not the one to hate, but it just bothers me because the people who do actually have talent don't get as much attention as the "no talent a$$ clowns" who do, or it's just harder for them to become famous because Hollywood is no longer looking for talent and they need people that will just make money for them.Like "High School Musical" for example. I mean, do people really actually like that movie, or is it for all the money that it made because of stupid little tweens?|`|fuvSSi9aaa	yep,Miley cyrus,Vanessa Hudgens are one of those people<br>  P'S.looks aren't everything|`|26znDQcKaa	I think shes okay but i do hate the people are talentless and are famous.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	Almost as much as I hate the people who make them famous.|`|8jd2AHJdaa	Yeah I can't stand them|`|Z31fwTMcaa	It's people like the Kardashians that are rediculous, I think. ( Although I always liked Bruce Jenner. )  ....<br>  <br>       .... If Robert Kardashian hadn't defended a double-murderer back in 1994, no one would even know who the Kardashian girls are.<br>  <br>  Same for Paris Hilton. If her great-grandfather hadn't bulit that hotel empire, no one would know who she is.<br>  <br>  But then there are the younger siblings and offspring ( of famous entertainers ) who undeservingly get famous. Untalented people like Ashley Simpson, Aaron Carter, Miley Cirus, etc. .. They only get to do what they do because someone they are related to helps them get a foot in the door of the entertainment world. Does anyone seriously think they would be famous if they had to do it on their own?<br>  <br>  And then there is someone like Prince Harry. He's nasty-looking, immature, and simply irresponsible. But hot girls want him. Do you know why? Because he was born into a ton of money. ... If he didn't have access to all that money, pretty girls wouldn't give him the time of day; he would be way out of his league, dreaming of the kind of girls that he could never get.<br>  <br>  There are alot of nasty ( or silly ) looking guys out there getting hot women only because the guy has alot of money, such as Seal, Bill Mahr, Kid Rock, Michael Phelps, Tiger Woods, Jeff Garcia, Marko Jaric. The list goes on and on.|`|xfh6ke3Vaa	yeah... but it also give me and my friends someone to bag on. i also hate scary movies that suck. Ever seen "the happening"? It was the butt of me and my friends jokes for weeks after we watched it. What the hell is up with the trees making people kill themselves? gayest story plot EVAH! But i digress... do you watch NCIS? The chick that plays Jenny Shepard sucks at acting, thats why they "killed" her. I like the new guy better anyways.|`|JngQU3unaa	No man, Jessica Alba is hot stuff, and you want her to make movies. In some movies she's a good, like 'The eye' and 'Honey', but she'll get there. <br>  <br>  But yeah, other talentless famous ppl are annoying|`|iAuvoQeHaa	I'm fed up with them. Well, sometimes you get someone who starts off pretty ordinarily but later becomes interesting, but few and far in between. Sick of those just famous for publicity stunts.|`|oqIJ6UmIaa	The first person that came to mind when I saw this question - Paris Hilton. Ugh...what does she actually DO!? <br>  <br>  Your totally right they don't deserve to be famous. It sucks...|`|HF1TfsnTaa	She's right up there with Jessica Simpson.poo. The only thing entertaining about her are the faces she makes when she tries to sing.ew|`|ZTVmUb4Laa	Not as much as I hate the people who pay attention to them...|`|btyElokJaa	Yes they sooo get on your t!ts|`|1neMZoRLaa	YES!!<br>  <br>  FOR GODS SAKE YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  the jonas brothers!!! the world's worst band in the history of man!!!!<br>  <br>  and all the other disney bands those ******* tweenie fanfucks listen to|`|cTM07yNwaa	i love jessica alba she is talented. <br>  <br>  but i hate other famous people that are famous for like no reason.|`|KjQ6qalDaa	Absolutley!!!! i hate hannah montana/miley gayrus! she's so annoying|`|BPTgXfl7aa	Yeah, I really hate them. Like 50 Cent who is a terrible artist but is famous.|`|UvKgDAwfaa	All disney singers including MILEY CYRUS|`|JYw3hRV8aa	being pretty is at least an answer but why do people like jade goody receive such press|`|AA10446754	YES|`|5673ef8ed5e8008f074e69bcf4c7d2b9aa	Just watch this... you can't take your eyes off her...I couldn't...

SVNlkkxOaa	Yeah you can smoke the resin in your pipe. you can either scrape it out and smoke it which can be pretty harsh. or you could get a pan and a stove, put water in the pan and boil it with your pipe in the water, all the resin will go to the top of the water. dump out all the water onto a paper towl over the sink, and the resin will get caught on top of the paper towl. then just put it in your pipe and smoke it.. but it'll be more harsh then just weed. but it gets you high :D|`|1lIgEiulaa	Yes, the resin in the pipe can still get you high. Just light the bowl like you would if it was packed, and gently suck in for a while until you get a thick smoke that continuously comes out of it. But be careful not to inhale too much gasoline from the lighter- it can burn and be bad for you. Just suck in gently so that you ignite the inside of the pipe. happy smoking!|`|XTqpWDXPaa	The best way to smoke it is to scrape out your bole, then roll the resin into a little ball.  And you can smoke on that thing for a while but it tastes like **** so use a bong if you can.|`|UReU5V9Faa	Yeah you can lite the residue cause maybe theres still some green in it.|`|b637df4c5d99edf4bd75147b1fdb49d3aa	If the residue is built up enough, you can just ignite it inside of the pipe, or you can try to scrape it out (somehow) and put it back in the bowl and light it that way.

And for movies coming to theaters soon: Watchmen, Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, X-men Origins: Wolverine, and Terminator Salvation look absolutely amazing.

I got to my front gate and I felt an instant burst of nausea and vomited on my front lawn ... it was so nasty!!|`|7hrOjPwjaa	I was drunk, but a more interesting story is the one where a girl was going down on me after many many drinks and she threw up all over my equipment.

I have thrown up so much though over the past 5 years that I have damaged  my esophagus.  It was not something I set out to do. I went to a "pain clinic", they took me off all of my meds, and body had a violent reaction, bp going up to 165/145.  Unfortunately, they did nothing to help me.  So, I finally had to come home, from a prestigious hospital to MISSISSIPPI to get them to, as they said, "turn off the trigger in the brain that causes you to throw up."|`|bW6NpTXdaa	a month ago.  food poisoning.<br>  <br>  now I make sure to wash ALL the veggies, including the garnishes...|`|f4ehvRQlaa	when i ate dried old crusty spaghetti and took my heartburn medicine.  :'(|`|spXPpyP0aa	ugh i was drunk|`|1kSRPadaaa	like 3 weeks ago. i was wasted and partyed hard. then got home and projectile vomited on the grass, in the bath and a bucket. yay go me. havent drunk since|`|AA12119298	I was 13 and it was back in 1982 I was sick for 3 days, I believe it was food poisoning.<br>  <br>  I did not like the feeling and have not thrown up since.|`|Nco3qtqsaa	Yeah today i was washing my teeth and went to hard, then i had tootpaste and vomit in my mouth|`|3vmmvRdYaa	I threw up Monday night.<br>  Due to heat exhaustion and too much coffee consumption. =p|`|IxQ01Jx9aa	tacos|`|7m34rQs5aa	I went to Taco Bell.|`|AA11536708	Today..and stuff came out of my mouth.|`|2hMhANqDaa	hangover... i wish i had a cure|`|305UhTfjaa	A party a few months back.. <br>  I'm Russian, so i love my vodka lol.. and well i drank a bottle of that and then stupidly mixed weed with it, and well i got really tired and wanted to lean on something but all the seats were taken and there were dogs alll over the floor.. so i ended up leaning on a wood stove.. and well my arm is scarred since haha.<br>  Then someone caught me burning the hell out of myself and brought me into  a tent to sleep in that was over cement.. they ran out real fast to grab me a pillow but by the time they came back i had hit my face against the cement and had been bleeding everywhere.. <br>  then of course all the attention, pain, and blood kind of combined to the point where i just had to puke.<br>  haha crazy night.<br>  Definitely taught me not to mix drugs and alcohol. <br>  :]|`|xcn0FyDyaa	A few weeks ago when I drank this vitamin C powder drink thingy.<br>  God knows why but that's the second time it's happened.<br>  I thought it was good for you.

Ys56Pj8vaa	My favourite scenes are:<br>   - baseball scene<br>   - when the cullens get inrouduced in the cafeteria<br>   - when they first step out of the car together<br>   - when bella goes to the cullens house<br>  they are my main favourites, but i love the whole thing|`|ZMBjlbTmaa	Of course i like the baseball scene like everyone else.<br>  <br>  I like the scene where Bella has been bit and Edward saves her by sucking the Venom out of her. The music playing i beautiful too.<br>  <br>  Also, i like the scene in the forest where Edward takes her up the mountain to show Bella what vampires really look like.<br>  <br>  Micheal Welch was great for Mike Newton.<br>  Robert Pattison fits Stephenie Meyers description of Edward. He was a little creepy though.<br>  <br>  Great books, great film!|`|X1ygowVQaa	I personally didnt like the movie. After reading the books no real person could compare to the beauty and grace that Stephanie Meyer described so well. And I thought the production of the movie was pretty poor especially the parts with Edward running. Hopefully the next movie will have more funds so that they can really capture the essence of the books.|`|EJ8iS9R4aa	baseball scene, i love how he was ready to protect her <br>  and when he said he wanted to try something and starting kissing her,<br>  i hated the part with them in the trees, i don't remember that ever happening in the book so why add that ? They cut things out but add things that never happened.|`|AD2e5hLqaa	I loved the baseball scene and the prom dancing scene|`|Ma5CuLfBaa	The baseball seen. OMG they all look really good in it (esp. Edward and Jasper) The song in it is really good to!!|`|0d8vPBMwaa	I have a few favorite scenes... I love the baseball scene especially the song playing in the background (Supermassive Black Hole by Muse). My 2nd favorite scene is the kissing scene. I think it's funny how into it Edward gets even though that scene is quite a bit different from the book. My other two favorite parts are the scene towards the beginning of the movie when the Cullens first walk into school and we're introduced to their characters and the scene when Edward and Bella are walking into school and he puts his arm around her.|`|wXg9ddtTaa	definately the baseball scene!!! <br>  they all look their best in it too!! :P

pI5EAAUcaa	Don't know. Maybe the show is testing the waters to see what kind of feedback they get from the fans.|`|irSBrZiQaa	That is a very good question, it seems like it changes daily and it is very hard to keep up with it. I personally would like to see Natalia and Frank together. Frank deserves some happiness, but I think that Natalia is having second thoughts about sleeping with Frank. I feel so bad for Frank that poor man can never find a women to be happy with. Well it won't be the first time that he has been hurt, it's still sad. I remeber when Buzz and Olivia had a thing at the same time that Frank was involved with her. I hope that they don't go that route because it just seems weird to me that Olivia is a lesbian. Olivia has always been a strong women and right now they have her playing a weak role. I think that Olivia is having feelings for Natalia and I also get the feeling that Natalia is starting to feel the same way. As far as where it is going, I have no idea it is so wishy washy it's hard to tell...<br>  <br>  In my opinion it would be very bad on ratings, I have read a lot of different soap boards and a lot of people have threatened to stop watching if they become a couple. I personally don't have an issue with it, however the show does not need anymore negative feedback. Considering they are thinking of pulling the plug on the show. Hopefully now that Phillip is back, the show will start to move in a new direction, so that it does not get canceled.|`|AFG4dQGGaa	I feel that Olivia has very strong feelings for Natalia and she is on the verge of telling Natalia and now that natalia just had sex with frank i feel its gonna become a huge love triangle. Which is probably what the writers want to increase the number of viewer as this show is suppose to be in jeporady of going out.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I read something about it in an interview with Crystal Chappel (Olivia) and at the time, she had no idea where the storyline would go but she was open to it and happy to play it.  I think Olivia is really in love with Natalia but not sure Natalia will be able to reciprocate.  Hard to tell at this point.<br>  <br>  Frank never seems to get the girl, does he??  lol.|`|U8aXa8xEaa	I don't know where it's going, but I hope it goes away.  It just seems too strange to make an established character like Olivia a lesbian.  Natalia is still fairly new.  (I know she's been on a few years)  But Olivia has been on too long.  I hear a lot of people complaining about this story line too. I think it will get dumped when the ratings start to show that people don't really like the storyline.  If they want to have a lesbian storyline, they should introduce new characters to do it.

AA11581903	Unfortunately, the fact that Star Wars is limited in its universe just leaves you wanting more films. George Lucas has said before he wanted to do nine films but he has now gone back on that saying its just too much work. You never know.<br>  <br>   Just on the bare facts of the matter.<br>  <br>   Star Trek has put out more media as far as shows and movies so it caters a bit more to the fans. We got a brand spanking new film coming out this year. There is just more Star Trek to Star Wars....not counting the books.<br>  <br>   Star Trek takes the title simply because there always seems to be a new movie out there. Star Wars, however epic and great as it may be is frustrating. There are sooo many cool ideas and stories you will never see on film.|`|OqviBejiaa	I agree with most people on here, I think that Star Trek is better. <br>  Star Wars is a fun fantasy space movie, but Star Trek tackles deeper questions and is true science fiction.

YyWtVDjJaa	I don't think Tamra is a friend to anyone either. I think that her and Vicki team up on the other women because they know that they won't stick up for them. However, I think that Gretchen came out looking like the better person for the simple fact of how she handled herself. I didn't think that she kept her story really well, but honestley I don't know how well I would have kept mine if one of my "so called friends" just went on national television (where you know Jeff's family is watching) and blurted these accusation out without warning. <br>  <br>  I think that Vicki and Tamra are so insecure about themselves that they have to put others down in order to feel good about themselves. I just don't see how these women call each other friends! (wheew I really got in to that one haha)|`|27jdKozNaa	You know Tamra was right. One second Gretchen is saying her ex is a stalker & the next she's taking her ex out for lunch to meet Jeanna & Lynne & they just happen to coincidently be at bass lake together at the same time vacationing & Jay is a fmily friend yadayadayada....<br>  <br>  Tamra came across as the villian but if anything I think she at least gave gretchen time to get her b*llshit story together by  not telling anyone about this sooner.  Also, WTF was that sh*t that Gretchen was saying Tamra was pimping her son on her at her ettiquette party. If anything Tamra kept telling ryan no|`|CuWjsHM2aa	I didn't like Tamra ever since she came on the show. She is very conceited and offensive. Last season she was making fun of Quinn for dating younger men and now she is picking on Gretchen for dating an older man. Tamra and Vicki are both very mean, vindictive and insecure women. <br>  <br>  As a society we tend to demonize woman for being "gold diggers" and let the men off of the hook. Now Jeff was a successful business man. So obviously he is not a fool. He had to know that Gretchen was with him because he was supporting her and buying her lavish gifts. It would be hard for a lot of women to turn that down. Most men want to get rich because they want a pretty woman on their arm. Gretchen claimed she loved him for all of the right reasons. I am not convinced. I think if he were just a regular guy making an average salary she wouldn't give him the time of day. <br>  <br>  As far as Tamra's accusations about Gretchen having a boyfriend on the side. It wouldn't shock me if it were true. Tamra was trying to make Gretchen look bad but I think she made herself look bad. What would she have to gain by spilling those beans? Why go out of your way to ruin someone's reputation? If Gretchen really is doing this then she will get what's coming to her.|`|iaLVRwBnaa	i'm not at all a fan of tamra, like many have already said... she seems to be a very bitter and jealous person...<br>  ... but i think there might be some truth to her story last night about this "jay" guy. his name is actually jay photoglou and i did some looking around online after the show and it seems like it was possible that they dated or were "close" while she was with jeff. jay has a myspace and has an album full of pictures of him and gretchen. sure, they could be just good friends... but some of the photos did look like very couple-sy type pictures. theres one of him actually grabbing both of her boobs and she's laughing and smiling. don't know when a lot of the pictures were taken - but she is wearing the engagement ring in most all of the pictures. <br>  <br>  ... and gretchen did look very uncomfortable when tamra was talking about it on the show last night. you could tell when the host said "so you are single?" and "so you're not dating anyone right now and haven't been"... her answer "no" seemed very hesitant and very nervous.|`|ACc1skbPaa	Tamra is a very bitter and jealous person, same as Vicki...my question is why would she believe someone who calls her house at 1am over the person she calls her "friend"?  She doesn't even know this guy who is calling her and her hubby Simon is gonna call him back and talk for an hour?????  I don't get it...I never really liked either Vicki or Tamra, but this season just sealed the deal...they are just downright nasty rude people...money can't buy you class!!  I do think Gretchen genuinely loved Jeff and it was returned to her and I do think she is going through a difficult time now and is leaning on people from her past--who else do you go to, strangers?  I just don't know why this is such a problem for Tamra and Vicki inparticular--why the hell should they care?  Tamra is two-faced and if any of the women are smart, they will watch their backs when they are around her (and her creepy son)!  Did anyone see how Vicki tried to take Lynne breaking down and make it about her?  Soooo pathetic!!!|`|UaPyRDhzaa	Last season I liked Tamra but this season she was so terrible. I just don't understand if she knew all this about Gretchen why did she wait to say something. I just think she is a HATER! I do think that situation with they guy Jay or whatever his name is happened but I think he just said that so Gretchen would come back and get him. And what I don't understand is how did that guy get Tamra's number. I like Gretchen and I believe her story.|`|kvFhEW91aa	I dont care for Tamara either, she just came off as so jealous and insacure. it was so high school how she acted though out the show. Gretchen and Lynne were two of my favorites, and Vicky just couldnt say sorry for being a ***** to Lynne.. I think Gretchen loved Jeff and if she did have something with another guy then, thats her business. I know i've had exboyfriends who still try to get back together even though im in a relationship.  And also! Why was this guy calling Tamara?? How did he even have her number?!?|`|hBqUPiskaa	My question is who cares?  Let's just say Gretchen was being paid by Jeff to take care of him, isn't that their business?  If it worked for them then why should Tamara care?  That she called Gretchen out like that made her look so bad and high school.  And Vicki just couldn't admit any wrongdoing.  Her only response to the other girls for hurting their feelings was "well you did it too".  Nice.|`|32NOChk4aa	I agree w/ some of the above posters.  At first, I thought wow Gretchen is a gold digger.  But you know what?  Jeff is a grown man and whatever the situation was there, it's nobody's business.  Tamara acts like she is such a saint.  And Vicki Icky well... don't get me started on her.  Lynne... yeah she's not the greatest parent... yeah she's ditzy... but geez cut her some slack ladies.  They're just plain mean.|`|c1PMv02saa	Tamara is just plain mean, she really made herself look like a fool last night. Her and Vicki deserve each other, they are both hateful!|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I think Tamara is not a friend to anyone. i wouldn't trust her. But i want to believe Gretchen ,but something doesn't seem right.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	I definitely believe Tamra. A close family friend of mine would not call up my enemy and say these things. A pissed off lover would.|`|Leda2ha0aa	Tamra sure did look different to me yesterday - I'm not sure if it was a different hairstyle or something she had done to her face but it sure didn't change her nasty attitude.  I think she was really trying to stir up the finale by bringing up the ex.  But I do think that something was going on there with Gretchen and her ex in some way because at first she said he was a stalker and then he was with her and her family for a mini vacation.  That's a bit odd to me when you are engaged to someone else you're having your ex still on your vacations.  I'd be keeping my ex's at a distance.<br>  <br>  Gretchen did not seem to be too shaken by what happened, but when they did the close-up of her scratching her face you could see she was unraveling a bit. When someone licks their lips like she was, that's a body language sign of discomfort and anxiety. I think there's something more to the story that she doesn't want to share.|`|SfwLF8j2aa	I agree,but I cannot stand Tamara!!! She thinks she is so perfect and is always putting everyone else down and is in everyone else's business! As for Gretchen,I truly believed she loved Jeff,but now I'm not so sure!

But remember, i said the MAJORITY...maybe yours is the rare honest type...<br>  <br>  Good luck :)
d8h5h8IVaa	My ex-boyfriend was a Pisces and they are a handful to say the least.  It depends on what sign you are as well, however, since I am a Virgo we were complete opposites.  It was one of the greatest love affairs I have ever had, we were crazy about each other, but it was a drama filled relationship, looking back it taught me a lot, so maybe I can help you.<br>  <br>  Pisces are dreamers, fantasizers, and fueled by genuine emotion.  They are highly perceptive and pick up on everything.  If you say something, but are thinking something else, they always know, and at times this could offend them, without you even knowing it.  They are creative and usually artistic or musically inclined. Their own well being means a lot to them and they need creative outlets to express this.  They also NEED time alone, so if you are someone who wants a "traditional" relationship, this is usually not going to happen with a Pisces.  <br>  <br>  IF the Pisces man does not have outlets or time by himself he will become moody and angry toward the relationship he is in.  They need personal time to "recharge" their batteries, and if they get this they are fun, sensual, emotionally available people.  They love romance and thrive on the new and the "game" of love.  They become annoyed when a relationship becomes stagnant, or boring, they need to be with someone who challenges them spiritually and emotionally-they love to learn.<br>  <br>  If you are an independent, smart, mysterious woman the Pisces man will love you.  If you are a logical, reserved, doting woman you will have a hard time keeping his attention.  They literally thrive on emotions, and sometimes their own emotions are so strong they can be too much for them to bare, so they need to feel like they are emotionally in tune with someone.  If they are feeling upset, they can be very detached and unresponsive.  They usually feel their emotions are overwhelming, and it can depress them if they aren't doing what they love in life-more so than most people.<br>  <br>  The character flaws of the typical Pisces are:<br>  <br>  1. Too sensitive<br>  2.  Whiny<br>  3.  Weak willed, vague<br>  4.  Plays the victim<br>  5.  Spacey<br>  6.  Secretive<br>  <br>  Nice attributes are:<br>  <br>  1. Imaginative and sensitive<br>  2. Compassionate and kind<br>  3. Selfless and unworldly<br>  4. Intuitive and sympathetic<br>  5. Artistic and creative<br>  <br>  <br>  LIKES <br>  <br>  Solitude to dream in <br>  Mystery in all its guises <br>  Anything discarded to stay discarded <br>  The ridiculous <br>  like to get 'lost' <br>  <br>  DISLIKES <br>  The obvious <br>  Being criticized <br>  Feeling all at sea about something <br>  Know-it-alls <br>  Pedantry <br>  <br>  <br>  This is really what my ex-boyfriend was like, to a "T."  Pisces are great people and he opened a lot of windows for me, we both learned a lot from each other, and even now I look back and think about how he opened my eyes to many things and helped me to live rather than "do."<br>  I helped him get organized and learn to dress, however!<br>  <br>  Good luck, the best advice I can give you is to ask if he wants to meet in a coffee shop to discuss the stars with him, Pisces are intrigued by astrology.<br>   ; )|`|B7WIZdglaa	omg, sounds like my ex pisces boyfriend! See if his venus is in aquarius like my exes was... and i'll give you the low down on your guy!|`|gkXqzyWDaa	I don't think that got to do with their horoscope, I am a Pisces as well and normally is quiet by nature, I tend to be quite distant even with my friend around. But I think that was built through how I was brought up by my parents. I could not tell what exactly happen to him at that time, but if that happen, we males normally like our partner to be by our side. You just have to show concern and stay with him quietly, any other support are depending on situation. <br>  <br>  And try to help other around, male usually feels better when they see their girlfriend is caring. But do not make him jealous by doing that.<br>  <br>  Well that is what i think, this may not work even though I am a male pisces. That still depends on his attitude and his way of seeing things.|`|x3h3KSYZaa	I will be glad to do his chart for you. No charge<br>  I have a husband who is a pisces who ruling planet is neptune.<br>  He likes to sleep a lot when he is stress. Pisces like to live in their head. And when a Pisces man finally do communicate their feelings it explosive. My husband punched a hole in my wall when he finally opened up to me. They don't like dealing with reality and can be delusional and fascinated by illusion.<br>  Email me his birthday.|`|2vyhH4ygaa	I am also a leo with a Pisces. I have found the same things to be true, but if you just let him do him for a while and dont push he'll open up. It took mine having all his friends, not me, pushing him to tell me how he feels. He'll come around but stay off his back.|`|n53BNB8taa	what is your sign by the way?<br>  <br>  Also most pisces can be in dream land most of the time and difficult in communicating their feelings.<br>  You can't force them to open up.

Hdvy9zkraa	Everyone is jumping on the it's so sad bandwagon, when they were the very people slating her in the past.  People expect us to respect her now, Why should we? she didn't respect her kids when she got her disgusting baps out on the tv or when she attacked her children's father in a night club. There are many more people with this illness that deserve my sympathy that have got a lot more self respect.|`|JODVNkU8aa	When someone is supposedly so ill I would have thought that the last thing on her mind was making a few extra million.<br>  Unless it was for charity of course, but I very much doubt it...|`|ApBT1lATaa	7 to 8 million|`|u18GBKmiaa	i agree with your opinion its getting kind of ridculous now and people are starting to criticise her|`|j1FCM0pqaa	jesus what the hell has it got to do with u , ye right shes made mistakes what are you the virgin mary <br>  just leave it let her make as much as she wants for her kids, did it ever accur to you that she may be in so much pain and its hard for her kids to see her like this , dont dare try make out that she doesnt care for them kids because she loves them n id say its breaking her heart everyday knowing she wont see them grow up, i hate negetive ppl such as urself.|`|HnNJAJeJaa	Does it really matter,She is Dying isnt that more important...

oM7zA7Jhaa	i have a feeling that there is a problem with your cable jack, (where you plug the cable into your guitar) this used to happen to me when i was younger, just unscrew it and make sure the wires are still connected, if they aren't, connect them, try this and let me know what happens! take care|`|xTioPxaVaa	The cable can look fine, and have a broken wire on the inside.  Try this to rule out the cable.  Plug the cable in, and turn the amp up about 1/3 of the way.  Then, touch the free end of the cable with your finger (you want to touch the very tip).<br>  <br>  Did you hear a loud hum?  If you did, then you can assume that the cable is good and that the problem lies with your guitar.  Most likely a solder joint has failed and a wire has come loose, but pickups does occasionaly fail as well.  If you're not well versed in electronics, you'll need to take it to a tech or the store where you bought the guitar.<br>  <br>  If you did not hear a change when you touched the end of the plug, then the cable is likely bad and should be replaced.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken

2cq46sDeaa	The answer is 3<br>  <br>  Either person 1 & 6 is lying<br>  And either 2, 3 or 4 is lying - a multiple of 2 & 3 cannot be prime<br>  Therefore 5 is true.<br>  This makes 2 a liar, therefore 3 and 4 aren't<br>  The only treble that can be a prime is 3|`|dAKgZr7Xaa	Z-E-R-0<br>  <br>                          he<br>           missed|`|QrmCMbbdaa	37|`|AA11995384	The permutations go on for a while but suffice to say that zoot661 has got it right.

NPhepcBkaa	Maybe because they are quite well-known. You know what people can be like.|`|1l0usBaNaa	there's a consensus among metal-ers that a metal band shouldnt be famous, slipknot is famous that's why metal-ers hate them<br>  <br>  wait.. i'm not sure if the consnsus is for metal or punk.. :p|`|8pZ3zdnqaa	Because they are a different style of metal.<br>  They used to be anyways, they suck now in my opinion, after the Iowa album it went down hill, then All Hope is Gone killed them for me.<br>  But anyways,<br>  Just listen to what you like, no matter what  you listen to there is going to be people that love to bash them.|`|N4xd99Qaaa	I guess I am not in the Metal Social Loop. I like Metal just fine and have no problem with Slipknot. Perhaps some dislike them because they have more of an industrial sound. It is ok for Metal fans to not like all metal bands. As long as you are a fan then who cares if other people are not? Keep da head banging mate!|`|veXUpiKJaa	Slipknot being a percussion based band doesn't really help. They don't have a 'heavy' sound like most other metal bands, and percussion is often associated with Pop/RnB/Rap, or popular music/culture, something which metal fans truly hate.|`|gZFepwLraa	because slipknot are for little babies. the people that hate them listen to REAL METAL. check out King Diamond and Mercyful Fate
6CAsx3jaaa	do you remember any of the actors? it doesnt sound very familiar.
svkn0oQkaa	yes, yes it does|`|ThEm8DCkaa	No|`|Mrhwc3nGaa	f**k no some fag *** that takes the dick to much up the a** must have made that bullshit up.|`|uf4SNnSWaa	Yes this is true.  Most RAPpers have Sokes-Heim Intelligence Tracking (****) Syndrome.   Side effects of this are violent outbursts, unintelligible babbling and chasing after white girls.|`|Pi8yM4RVaa	Since a lot of them make a lot more money than poets do I would say no.|`|8VXh7u3Aaa	probably i do not know really love your brother , tristyn|`|wfZhkZO0aa	No it stands for Really Artistic People.

Then we'd come out with some of the best poetry that poetry has to offer.    Also ARMY stands for Ain't Ready for the Marines, Yet. Tell that to all your ARMY friends.
4FhrvZ3Raa	oh, was that kane? i just watched that.  yeah his car crashed into the school formal - melody's fault and basically that's what happened.
67QVKHQ3aa	yup im gonna guess bubba sparxxx|`|xeEOTsyYaa	Bubba Sparxxx?|`|bc92692e5171a576e30283eb2faec88eaa	Aren't you the guy that likes Bubba Sparxx?|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	Is he Everlast (Started in 1988) or Mike D(Shifted with the rest of the Beasties in 1986)?  Everlast if you mean more of a peckerwood  Mike D if you mean White Rapper
CJbZw69haa	They are equally pretty because they both have their own look    P.S. I think it's funny how people think a smaller nose makes a person more attractive...Oh the world we live in, it's just sad|`|NqcnAnC1aa	Beyonce is prettier and the better singer, but I like Rihanna's songs better.|`|WD3a7jJYaa	Beyonce'! Because little miss Rihanna stole my man Chris Brown!  But I have to admit that she can sing!|`|3Z4YFz29aa	Beyonce|`|QV02KUDRaa	Rihanna because her looks are unique and exotic Beyonce is cute but she is not like "oh My god, She is the most beautiful person that ever walked on the planet"|`|6hBKoN6Jaa	I think they are both beautiful women.  Beyonce has a more matured beauty versus Rihanna's innocent beauty - not taking anything from either one.  They are GEORGEOUS.|`|8ac51a92835b1cb6919a78edc8783869aa	Rihanna|`|hCI6HFEnaa	In the pictures you posted, Rihanna.  But generally I think they're both equally pretty.|`|JHOlfb1jaa	Beyonce. hands down!

uyQppMYLaa	Tortured lyrics and a harsh, abrasive guitar and keyboard sound.|`|t2evcVVEaa	great question. my favorite band is Lifehouse. and my second favorite band just cant reach into my soul like Lifehouse can. that makes all the difference.|`|hGVkInSnaa	A sexy front man that sounds like he's masturbating on stage. <br>  <br>  (Led Zeppelin is my favorite band, Foreigner is number two.)|`|La7BL4Zsaa	well they both have dave grohl...<br>  <br>  but i think i like the foo fighters more than nirvana because the foos have much more songs than nirvana.

IrqIcx34aa	YES! I feel the same as you. I roll my eyes thinking how does this person get great reviews. But then think either their friends are voting for them or they are voting for themselves under different names. I basically think its just a way to have fun.
gUYcVXMTaa	Hi Buzz    I think the Eve and Gwen Blow your mind was a bit out of the box.  Never would have thought she would be on that!

I hear it's going to be sick hip hop record. We shall wait & c|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	Jay-Z and Linkin Park- I think they did well actually because Linkin Park can be versatile   DJ Quik and Peter Gunz, Erick Sermon- I must say that that was the most unbelievable combination in hip hop history  Madonna tried it and I hope will never try it again|`|98wFqBwSaa	You suck bro and you're name is corny as fcuk.
hCI6HFEnaa	Yeah, that'd be really cool! Singing and dancing around the streets, really fun actually!    But not too overdone - then it'd be like we're in High School Musical world where people freakishly start singing and randomly dance about anything when it happens. That would be retarded.|`|VNum3TKyaa	That only works if your in a Pepsi commercial|`|18K7ucsEaa	Yeah that would be awesome! It works sometimes at work and you can get a few people on the bandwagon, but it would be bliss if you could get EVERYBODY to join in!    :-D|`|ucsYXXdSaa	that only happens in tv adverts and pop videos|`|Y29OiWJbaa	LOL, that would be so cool!|`|utGddhnVaa	haha..that's true. but yeah that would be rad if it was socially acceptable|`|olMVfnljaa	Yeah...

THATS STRANGE ?  that's why people always laugh at me...|`|vcnRwkB8aa	Sounds nice. But it only happens in the movies and on television. In real life, people would look at you as if you'd gone crazy.|`|6qsocyK3aa	That would be cool.

Ah well.|`|zzkmdusEaa	That would be BA!    Walking down Wal-Mart, singing I'm Walking on Sunshine in a really mellow tone then everyone starts singing along quietly then pretty soon the whole store is dancing and singing like a broadway musical.

They might be laughing at the people that do this, but I bet they want to join in.|`|V20PTwMmaa	ahahaha that would be awkward|`|3ae36fb346464cc71eaa8b5fe85316efaa	well in my class these 2 guys always sing to annoy our teacher  nd one day the whole class started singing along with them it was pretty funny   :)|`|AA11183228	lol...yes my boyfriend has commented on this a few times, wouldnt it be great if life was like a musical!. lol...i wouldn't mind, but daren't start singing in the street. because i know i'd get funny looks. x|`|YuJWHItFaa	I always loved it in the Buffy Musical episode where everybody joined in singing, or in Enchanted and the scene where she's singing in Central Park. Life would be lovely....|`|f98093c5efc4ff7a072f987cac7a9d42aa	I love how that happens in musicals!!! And it's perfectly normal!    Yes, I actually wish it could happen in real life.|`|4FhrvZ3Raa	lmao.|`|AA10283947	After WW2 on a Saturday night couples used to link arms seven or eight abreast heading for the cinema the women with the hair in a turban and singing all the wartime songs that they had learnt in the factories, this went on for years, until, Saturday became, stay indoors and watch tele.  People were so close and friendly then, mostly because of shared hardships, tide might be turning soon with a possibility of real camaraderie returning when economic pressures hit.
1ViGcF3xaa	Vincebus Eruptum by Blue Cheer in 1968!  It's a great album and you should give it a listen if you've never heard it and I'll bet you'll agree with me.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	I don't think there are immaculate births in music. There is only progression. So as for the first heavy metal album (in its entirety) ... I'm not so sure one exists.

The Goths were a Teutonic Tribe, others were the Lombard's, Vandals, etc. Their own lore claimed that they were originally of Scandinavian descent although some historians doubt it. Their religion was similar to that of the Norse and they most likely believed in the same primary gods as the Vikings although with different names; for example Odin was alternately known as Odhinn, Wodan, Wittan, and probably other names, and some tribes knew Thor as Donar. They also probably had a few lesser deities of their own and had their own versions of the Norse mythos. There is no surviving documentation from the goths of there religions although the religions of Germania were briefly described by Roman historians such as Tacitus, those tales probably included a few facts and a lot of propaganda. The Norse religion is probably among the most well documented of the pre-christian European religions because that religion was still practiced in Iceland long after the others were forgotten and there is a lot of written material that survived. The Christians destroyed all traces that they could of most of the older religions when they converted a region. In Iceland however a compromise was reached that allowed the traditions and practice of the Norse to continue in private although publicly the people converted to Christianity. This compromise was unique to Iceland, and now the Icelandic Sagas and Eddas still exist and from them a lot can be inferred about the beliefs of Northern Europe before the advent of Christianity. <br>  <br>  Arianism The Gothic Christians were followers of Arius. <br>  <br>  When people become Gothic they do portray a image of being completely similar. But by getting to know each individual person you will see that aside from all wearing hot topic as some so bluntly put it that they can all be completely different along with their personality. So you cant really classify a religion but its true a lot of the are atheist but half of the people just say that to put on a front and before a person classifies someone as a Goth get to know more of their personality from my experience a lot of people "pose" as Gothic and very few are genuine which is why Gothics all look alike because the few attention starving people take a genuine Gothic persons style and copying it getting rid of all individuality, but that doesn't mean they are Gothic. Anyone can wear skulls and chains its more or less your personality that defines who you are. Just like a Gothic person can't put on Abercrombie and Fitch and say I'm a "prep". Genuine Gothic people are different just like everyone else and all have there own way of thinking. <br>  <br>  Not all Gothic people do not believe in god. Also "Gothic" is such a sweeping term that you can never be 100 percent sure that you will get a correct answer. For a basic rundown of "goth" beliefs check this website: <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1228961&lastnode_id=11765" rel="nofollow">http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node...</a> <br>  <br>  Gothic PEOPLE can believe in whatever they want. I am a WITCH, but my friend is a Christian. 'Goths' are people too. <br>  <br>  "Goth" is a stereotype, therefore the Gothic individual can be classified under it can have completely different religions and beliefs. A stereotype cannot be a religion, or ensure that everyone under it believes one thing. An individual should not classify people before actually getting to know them. <br>  <br>  Nobody said they were labeling them. Lots of people just want to know because they've heard the term before. Gothic is an unusual term though. There were Gothic churches in the middle ages. They were catholic. <br>  It can mean different things. <br>  <br>  They believe in shopping at Hot Topic and talking about dark things. It's really more of a social group of teenages wearing black than anything else. <br>  <br>  Gothic people don't have one belief. They usually just want to be "different," but they've made themselves all the same. Most teenagers think it's just something cool. <br>  <br>  Tell me one generation that didn't have a Rebel group in it! I grew up in the 1950s and there were 'greasers'. Put it this way, other than these guys having greasy hair (waterfall in the front hanging over their forehead and a duck tail at the back) and constantly combing their hair, wearing white T-shirts, jeans and usually a leather jacket they were simply rebels and weren't dangerous to anyone. They wanted to make a statement and not conform to society. During the 60's and early 70's there were 'hippies' making a statement for 'peace and love' and trying to get back to Mother Earth. They stood up against the war in Vietnam and some of the best songs ever written came from that era. It was the first time young people had a voice against their government and they took full advantage of it. People who dress in a Goth style (generally|`|bn8OZrYSaa	"dont judge a book by tis cover"|`|NJpMkIG1aa	yes. my impression says so.. but i heard that goth girls are just normal people trying to find themselves.|`|WkT42WyNaa	Absolutely not, they're no different than anyone else, they just have a different style.

The difference between them is Walmart and Kmart.  <br>  And yes, they worship the Devil.  But this is a free country to worship as they please.  Isn't that great?  <br>  Now the way I see it is this---- If a couple has an infant or young child and need to go out (Yes, this need does arise) they need a babysitter.  If that babysitter comes to the door wearing black lipstick, upside down crucifixes, etc... (basically looking like demon-spawn) and the couple allow the babysitter to enter their house and take care of the kid or kids, then they deserve to have their offspring thrust upon some alter, bled like a pig and offered up to some entity.  If they had one damn ounce of common sense in their head to begin with, they would have pulled out a shotgun and told the GOTH/EMO freak to (*$& off and pulled the trigger.  It's all about freedom of choice, isn't it.  <br>  That reminds me, I need to dig another 15 foot pit to get rid of last nights batch of freaks that came to my house.  I tell you, between the GOTH, EMO and Jehovah's witness freaks here, I'm running out of room to bury them.<br>  <br>  P.S.  This was said in fun.

uel6NBOVaa	It definitely depends on the situation, the setting I'm in, what I'm talking about, and the people I'm talking to. I am not quiet or shy though, far from it. I tend to be expressive in speech and use a lot of hand gestures. I love to debate, and to argue for that matter, and if I'm talking to people that I know well I can get a bit aggressive about it (Mercury conjunct Mars -- Know it all). I can tell when it's an appropriate situation or not, though, and unless my emotions are caught up in the debate and I simply can't hold myself back, I generally won't display my temper around people I'm not very close to. <br>  <br>  Blunt? Only with friends because I feel they deserve honesty. Just like my argumentative side, my blunt side tends to show around people I'm more comfortable with. On a regular basis, though, I do tend to tell a lot of white lies. Usually pertaining to myself and my agendas, since I don't like letting people know everything about me. Telling lies helps put up a safety barrier that I can shape to my will. I don't even think about them, they just come out naturally. I also like to say things that will shock and startle people (Uranus in the 3rd house). I like to be regarded as different, and unique in my thinking....for better or worse, and often for worse. <br>  <br>  I like a wide variety of subjects, from philosophy and the spiritual, to the dark and the morbid, and normally anything that has some intelligent thought behind it. I'm a musician, so of course music is a big part of my vocabulary. I'm not averse to small talk, though I prefer deeper conversations, if someone wants to take the time to talk to me I usually find it flattering.<br>  <br>  Libra Sun and Mercury<br>  Mercury in the 12th House conjunct Mars, sextile Venus, and square Jupiter/Saturn/Neptune. <br>  Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune in the 3rd house<br>  Libra Rising|`|8ZUVToXgaa	I don't know what all that House stuff means so I won't post mine.<br>  <br>  I am somewhere in between, but leaning towards shy. <br>  <br>  I'm not gonna say I'm quiet though, because sometimes you can get me talking and I don't wanna stop.<br>  <br>  But I can be perceived as quiet by some.<br>  <br>  But like you, I'm friendly and open and I can be blunt sometimes but when I'm new to you I can tend to stay on the nicer side of things and bite my tongue at times.<br>  <br>  Taurus sun, Virgo moon, Leo rising, Venus in Aries and Mercury in Gemini.|`|ythN9BQgaa	Are you quiet or loud?<br>  - Depends. If I'm talking about something I don't like I get very low and look down (no eye contact) but if it's a conversation I do like, I get very loud and start making jokes about it. (I love making people laugh)<br>  <br>  Do you like debating?<br>  - Yes. EVERYONE is entitled to MY opinion. <br>  <br>  jk<br>  <br>  But honestly, I don't like debating because I start getting violent and I don't like losing. If I do, I throw a temper and try to get them scared until they admit I'm right, haha.<br>  <br>   Are you blunt or do you tell little white lies?<br>  - Depends. If I'm protecting someone I tell little white lies. But other than that I'm very blunt. Even if it does hurt their feelings<br>  <br>  Gemini sun and mercury<br>  Mercury in house 10 (midheaven)<br>  Leo rising|`|B7WIZdglaa	Most of the time I am pretty outgoing. I wouldn't say i'm loud or quiet, but if I had to pick- I'd go more towards loud. I will only debate if it is a subject I am very familiar with. I am very blunt, and that is the reason why i'm no longer friends with one of my good friends. She is a bit of a drama queen and said that things I say "hurt her" too much and she just cant be friends anymore. I would never intentionally hurt anybody, but I guess not everyone can handle my realness. I really don't tell little white lies- I mean, I HAVE.. but I'm def not a liar.<br>  I can be a little shy or quiet if i'm uncomfortable.<br>  I love things that are mysterious (ghosts, aliens, astrology, etc)<br>  I do not like politics.<br>  I love music, photography, art..anything that involves being creative.<br>  I do like stirring up a little trouble sometimes! I am sort of a "badass"- but never TOO bad. <br>  <br>  I love animals & children (unless they are brats!)<br>  <br>  Aquarius sun & mercury<br>  Leo in my 9th house<br>  Sun in house 3<br>  Sagg rising|`|eT6SsCaraa	I'm very shy, sensitive, and empathetic. I feel everything the person I'm communicating with is feeling, so I keep their feelings in mind when I'm talking to them. I will try to cheer them up if their down.. or calm them if they are angry. <br>  <br>  I am very quiet too. I hate loud scenes and displays. I usually don't wave my hands around like other girls do, rather I'll speak very quietly and look away shyly.. and hold my hands or play with my hair... <br>  <br>  I don't care much for debating, mostly because I'm not very confident and can't easily or quickly back up my thinking. Sometimes I just don't really have an opinion, or its just ethics, morals, and religious beliefs that no one will take sieriously.<br>  <br>  I am not blunt, I think before I speak, as I don't want to hurt or offend the person I'm talking to. I don't lie, I hate lying. It makes me feel guilty, even if it's a little thing. So, like if I think something didn't look good on my friend for example, I would try to find something good about it, then kindly suggest trying something else.. like... "That color looks very nice on you.. but how about we try another style first, and see what we like better?"|`|ZtnXNbaEaa	im not loud im quite and shy..people generally find me shy and quite but im not like that... i just go on talking and talking with the one i know.. i too guess im in middle... im very talkitive... i like debating and can even argue to prove my point right... and even im dominating in my speech if its my topic... but im not blunt... i put things in a polite way... it means dominating politely ...loll.. im friendly and not too outgoing as well... generally the topics i punch the people with can be about music or about celebrities or about horoscopes... loll|`|rvthI0dIaa	I am a quiet and shy person, but not in excess. I like debating if i am being criticised or being misunderstood. And for bossy ones, i return them back.|`|LGFa6CKsaa	Interesting subject! <br>  <br>  I'm loud and i love conversations. Political, philosophical conversations, intelligent conversations about history, world, trends, everything. I like debating, what really turns me on is man how never agrees with me :D  I really do find neutral and shy people boring.. Like at work i'm in that table where is lot of noise and everyone is popular outgoing type. I don't come along with shy people who can't get a word out of their mouth, why is that some people don't have anything to say?<br>  <br>  Either i'm not super social person, it's 50/50 people and alone. If i don't have anything to say i just shut up and won't talk some bullshit just because of talking. I'm pretty blunt type, i'm really equal to everyone, substantial type not people loving. <br>  <br>  People might sometimes find me little bit scary, but i'm friendly to everyone, even with the shy ones. I try to make them feel comfortable, so they might have more confidence and learn to be like me :)<br>  <br>  Sun, Mercury Capricorn 6th house, Venus Aquarius 7th house, these planets rule our social life + Asc, i'm asc Leo.|`|nxHjSKTTaa	I am quiet, empathetic and observant. I feel everything (this is not always good and I wish I could stop it) I feel like I am inside the other person I'm listening to and know exactly what there feeling and sometimes what there thinking. <br>  I can be outgoing but my normal tendency is to be reserved. I like it but people can oftin misjudge quiet people as being a snob. Usually however those people are not to bright anyway.<br>  <br>  I do not like conflict, I want a civilized mature conversation so no, I do not like to debate. I will speak honestly or not speak at all.

Itug9fNoaa	a real musician doesn't care about 'career' matters and plays the music that drives his/her soul. i.e. put it out there and if people like it, well that is great. if they don't, well, at least the musician stayed true to themselves. i never cared much for bruce springsteen, but as far as a musician adressing the darker issues of their lives, you might want to check out an album by rodney crowell, i'll see if i can find it around somewhere for the name, but, even though it is pseudo-country, it puts forth some incredible stuff about the guy's life, sexual abuse, etc. powerful, but not commercially successful|`|5HvdcWvBaa	Thanks, Happy Monday to you, too =]    I'm not 100% sure i get your question, so sorry if this is crazily unrelated;   I don't think that musicians should ever have to remove the focus of their past, they still lived it even if their life is not like that anymore. For example, Guns n' Roses still sung about people they knew before they were famous (eg.the song, Rocket Queen) and situations they were in before they got so famous (eg, Welcome to The Jungle) so they weren't being frauds or whatever 'cause they still lived like that once, and they still went through everything that inspired them to write those songs, so even though they were famous they had been like that once.   Errm...i hope that makes sense 'cause i couldn't be sure that it does.|`|7fEVNng5aa	Morning, Sookie! Happy Monday to you, too!    I think it has to be taking on a case by case basis. For dealing with past emotional issues, it's going to be up to the person who experienced them. Some can put it behind them and move on, some will always have that baggage. I wouldn't say to an artist "okay, you've got five platinum records, you've made a ho-jillion dollars, it's time to sing about something else".       As far as writing about the darker issues with credibility, well, whenever I watch the news, which isn't often, I tend to get the ol' "something must be done about this!" mentality. So an artist that draws inspiration from world events, and cares about them, shouldn't be bothered by their own success, IMO. Just as an example  -------  Hi! Yup, I'm in Cali. I've got 3 minutes of morning left. Nope, 2 minutes!|`|aKBqMLuhaa	Being rich and famous does not eliminate your upbringing. And for many famous people that is all they have to hold onto because their life as they know it no longer exists. They revel in the memories of the past that has made them who they are.  Also many people are great song writers about down and out situations and yet have never been in those situations; they are the story tellers for others who are not so good with words and music. (EX: Whiskey Lullaby by Brad Paisley and Allison Krauss)  I am one to think that change in this fashion does not need to exist so long as what they sing of is true to hearts of the listeners.|`|1ViGcF3xaa	Happy Monday Sookie!    If I happened to be a musician that became rich and famous I wouldn't really care what people thought of the music I write about.  I'd be writing what I wanted, not something that I thought would please someone else.  When you've lived through hard times you should be able to write about them whenever you'd like to, no matter what your current circumstances are like in the present day.  How dare someone else tell you what topic you should care or write about!|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	Great question Sookie. Happy Monday!   I think it's a really tough one to answer because depends on what got you there. The Boss is a tricky case because he's kind of screwed either way. On one hand it's so wrapped up in his persona as an artist with those who love his music (he is kind of the musical voice of blue collar america to be really general about it), but if you examine it he isn't living that life so you could really attack him either way for either selling out or being disengenuous. The way I see it, I'm not a fan of his minus some songs here and there after the third record or so, but from what I can tell he's mostly done it right. I don't know the details of this Wallmart contract and I think that is pretty hypocritical given the kind of image he has created for himself (really I don't get it), but I don't know the details and I don't really feel like assuming the worst.     At any rate, I think the only way to really do it wrong is to completely double talk yourself. You shouldn't be totally anti-establishment, anti-corporate and then plaster yourself all over MTV. You shouldn't rail on and on about the evils of capitalistic society and how evil corporations are and turn around and sell your t-shirts for $25 (*cough* Rage *cough*). If you're going to be like that you should really be taking notes from Ian Mckaye. I'll really give all the slack in the world because we as consumers at least always say that we want our artists to be legit and (for lack of a better word) honest with us, not fake, and yet maintain a sort of cohesiveness in their message and their sound (something that I find to be fundamentally just entirely unfair). People evolve and people change with their situation so I'll always give a long rope (at least when it comes to respect, doesn't necessarily mean I want to listen to it) if you don't turn out to be a TOTAL hypocrite.|`|0cc7b69ea6b5f359aa006de2a67d9086aa	Hi Sookie, your question really had me thinking...and then, I stopped thinking...:-)    As long as the integrity of giving their message stays intact they can remain "the voice" of the common man regardless of the level of success.  In Bruce Springsteen's case his recent deal with Walmart, xie!, xie!, (thank you in Chinese) has tainted his American-blue-collar-soldier-in-fortune worker image ala "Streets of Fire,"     http://www.moviehole.net/wp-content/uplo...    This has caused him to be viewed in a whole new perspective by many.  Even his apology (released just prior to his Superbowl performance) seemed to be lacking genuineness and just damage control.|`|2X2wjYb4aa	Hi Sookie,  You ask an interesting question, and, yes, I think I understand it. : )  I don't think a musician needs to 'abandon' their youth, or upbringing, at any point in their career. An artist should be able to address whatever issue they care to - with the proviso that, depending upon circumstances beyond the artist's influence, their work may fall flat with the public.   I'm reminded of a story I read last week about The Boss opting to perform at halftime: a longtime fan was loudly lamenting this apparent 'pandering' to wealth, or publicity, or some other kind of 'sell out' that his image/career/self-actualization has generally avoided, if not shunned.     What a pompous so-called fan!!!      No matter if this person was a fan and friend of Springsteen's going back to, say, grade school, Bruce is under NO OBLIGATION to make his career choices in keeping with some fan's idealized concept of heroism!  (You ought to read the guestbook at the King Crimson web site at DGM - many individuals complain long and loud about what King Crimson SHOULD be doing, in their view; it's as if by proclaiming themselves as fans, and buying some CDs and concert tickets over the years, then they somehow deserve to not only get whatever they ask for, but also the way they want it.)|`|Qw4l9R68aa	There is nothing wrong with writing about their past. It probably was a big part of their past and should remain a big part of themselves or else they will lose their identity and one without identity can not write music that can touch people.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Happy Monday Sookie!     Great answer 8 Track.     All good and successful bands and musicians must evolve over the course of a long career. I have seen it happen over and over with several of My favorites, I.E. Yes, Nightwish, Metallica, Deep Purple. The times change, they feel their music is getting stale, they change their sound and make changes in the band. They often receive staggering amounts of flack for it. Metallica took a beating for their stylistic shift, as did Yes with the album 90125. Many die hard Nightwish fans howled over Tarja's replacement by Annette. But You don't change You get old, trite, and meaningless. great artists understand this. That's My take, anyway.
04CjQ7njaa	blackmore for the more pop type of hard rock.    page for talent.    sorry its got to be both     its one of those questions with no real answer.    its like asking which is the better song?     'smoke on the water' or 'stair way to heaven'|`|EQm2iCpaaa	Blackmore is raunchier and heavier.

hazucBxbaa	on youtube there is this guy who gives free lessons he is black, he is good too so look him up its convient and free!!|`|Yz1pzloSaa	You could check out some singing tutorials online, I guess.  At my school I'm in Choir, and there's also a lady who teaches voice lessons, she has like a little office/practice room across from the choir room, and I get singing lessons from her once a week during my choir period. I don't know if they have that at your school, but you could check it out. Also, this is obvious but if you're not in Choir already, you should join. ;P|`|IKgbbRVEaa	since you already have a piano try doing scales, and try to increase the amount of octaves you can sing, always ALWAYS warm up before singing, and most of all have fun :D  Make sure to sing from your diaphragm and not your head voice X    ?SurfySez?|`|AA12221077	Do you have a tape recorder?  If you do, record yourself singing something, and play it back.  Sometimes it's hard to hear your mistakes while you are singing, but you'll notice them on playback.  If you listen to the professional version of the song, then your own version, you should be able to notice where you weren't at your best, and improve.|`|WOQAbVzbaa	Why don't you join a choir?  I joined a choir that sings church music and the like at my school, and it has really improved my voice and musicality.  Also, if you have a piano, use it!  (you are really lucky to have one, so make the most of it)|`|yCU362o3aa	My mom took singing lessons and her voice almost got her to nashville except she got pregnant and decided not to go. She's helping me learn and she's told me: (Oh, yeah, I'm 14 too!)  Sing and breathe from your stomach, if you need to practice the breathing, lay down on your back and put a book on your stomach, when you're breathing from your stomach, you'll see the book start to rise and fall.    Don't try to song just like the person singing the song, everybody has their own voice and when you do that it just makes you sound horrible.    Don't keep your mouth closed or it will sound like mumbling.    And sing, don't speak, incorporate the music and beat of the song into your voice.   This all I can tell you. Hope it helps.|`|GSmlWxhHaa	Hey! I'm 14 too, and have singing lessons. Get some karaoke.    Basically, things about singing (from my lessons):    -Good diction (pronounce consonants well)  -EXPAND YOUR RIBCAGE  -Open your mouth wider as the notes get higher  -Get a good, clear sound, not too breathy    Things you can do:     -Order books/song/sheet music off amazon (from musicals maybe - I have Miss Saigon, Les Miserables, Joseph, e.c.t)  -Karaoke!  -Just excercises on the piano (but doing them all the time is a bit boring, so do songs as well!)    Good luck, I'll check out your youtube!|`|LLNlyaFaaa	just keep singing your voice probably hasn't totally developed yet so just keep doing what you're doing and your voice should improve when i was 14 i loved singing but i was always to nervous to go up on stage i quickly got over that fear after i sang for my family and they said i was great so yeah just because some people are saying you need voice lessons doesn't necessarily mean you actually do|`|7Ac0A1LTaa	you could try looking up singing exercises on the internet and keep on SINGING!

FcHplZtQaa	Not for years, can't skate and don't want to.....    I know it isn't easy, but hey I'm not on a RTV show.....    Anyways Shannen if we can't slate them what fun would there be then??? LMAO    When I was about 14/15, me and my friends got pissed (of about 2 bottles of beer, remember they days? LOL), and went ice skating, FFS I fell and smashed the back of my head of the ice, if I'd been sober I'd probably have fractured my skull........and I got chucked out the rink.....put me off skating that did!    Hope my kids don't do anything like that.................actually hopes not the word, they better fecking not! lol|`|l1vzoQ1uaa	im going to next weekend ! ^-^ ; and yeah that happens xD just keep at it and youd be fine. and stretch ! xD|`|SNh8HUWmaa	i went skating a few weeks ago. i love it, i have my own figure skates so i don't have to borrow from the rink.  i love the feeling that gliding on the ice brings - it melts my tension away unlike anything else.|`|jG303M2Laa	Yep.

Love it thhough x|`|H6D6jlKGaa	I havnt been ice skating in about 3/4 years but yes it is tricky and i spent my first 30mins on the floor lol.. everytime i got up i fell straight back down!

I'm takin my step-daughter ice skating soon and i cant wait!! :-)    Yeah, they need to give Todd some slack.. i thought last night he deserved more than a 7.5.. he's entertaining and thats what viewers what isnt it?!

Have fun on your neighbours ski's :-D|`|SesoOWvDaa	Not intentionally but I shall be watching my step over the next few days - and I won't be falling over either so some had better not get their hopes up!|`|UfRMJheeaa	Yes Shannen sweetie I have. In fact me and Beaver Sue are meeting up later on in the week to skate on the frozen Thames...lmao|`|gGZz2EGyaa	I appreciate what you are saying about ice skating it is not easy we have all been there, done it and got the t-shirt when it comes to learning to skate.  These celebrities are skating every day and have been for weeks now and some of them, Todd in particular, do not look like they have been on the ice at all.  Can you remember after a few weeks of going to the ice rink how much better you and I were at skating.  I appreciate they are learning dance steps all the time, but hey a few times round the rink will help them skate normally like everyone else who learns.  Todd has a lot of Grange Hill and Eastenders fans so they will keep him in for a few weeks yet.      Hope you are back from your snow trip to the shops okay.|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	No I haven't Shannen and believe me I do realise how hard it is, especially for those who haven't done it before, so do appreciate what the celebs are going through.  Many have to carry on their jobs,  learning lines, appearing in panto etc in between too which cannot be easy with all the training on the ice they have to do.|`|v0LWgN33aa	No but unless I was stupid to try them today, whoever said inline skates were easy was having a laugh!|`|aKhZNd7daa	I use to go Ice Skating in my teens Shannen at the now defunct Richmond Ice Rink (where Karen Barber & Nicky Slater the DOI Judges use to do all their training) there is no way I could skate now or wish to lol.|`|NkecUYMGaa	No, those public ice rinks are usually full of retards. Not unlike DOI come to think of it.

I don't like sleeping upstairs.. I have to be on the ground and in a small area to feel cozy and safe.|`|xieiM0FRaa	Yes. I've always wanted to live in one of those neat looking one's in <br>  Ireland. :]|`|44eKDvkhaa	Just a small one, maybe 15 bedrooms tops. I gotta keep the king busy somehow.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Hell yes!|`|48bf9693fe11d5690735d446af762e16aa	Who's asking ?

ADBMrG87aa	I agree, the story was really cute and it most definitely was missing important people such as Tony, Felicia, Frisco, Georgie and Lucas.  The whole Johnny/Carly/ Patrick thing was strange; seems like the writers didn't give much thought to the story.  The dream storyline seem to be just a filler so that a bunch of actors  can get the day off or something.<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|M1ymLE9Paa	I thought it was enjoyable to watch, but not complete, as you and others pointed out.  How could it be complete w/o Tony, Felicia, Frisco, Georgie, and all the rest of the family and friends that were involved or would have been involved in BJ's life.  I thought having Carly on was fine, and Patrick too, to an extent, but I didn't think Johnny really belonged in that episode at all.  So although I liked the episode, it def could have been better.|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	I enjoyed it, but you're right. It was missing some key people that I would have thought they would want to include. I don't think it was as well thought out as it could have been, but it was still enjoyable.|`|msUIsv8maa	No not really|`|AA11261694	i loved it i remember when maxie got bjs heart it was one of the best acted saddest scenes i had ever seen i cried and cried kirsten storms was wonderful and i liked seeing johnny cuz i really like him it was missing some important players in the part and itt was good to see bobbie its been  a while|`|EhBF31evaa	I haven't seen it yet but back when that storyline happened, it was so powerful!  I cried and cried.  The original storyline was awesome.|`|AA11362302	I thought it sucked & really lacked imagination.Made absolutely no sense.|`|o5jSID4Jaa	It definitely should've been thought out a bit more. I was really hoping to see Georgie!<br>  It was cute though. It was good to see Bobby. Haven't seen her in a while.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	It was good but like you said..no Frisco and Felicia or Tony who were all major parts of that story in the first place! Johnny/Carly/Patrick had no business being in there at all.I can see Carly bc she is BJ's sister but the only way she should have been shown was offering sisterly advice!|`|AA12315431	I agree with katie021.. it was a good concept but they way they presented it was crappy. I especially didn't like that the whole episode was about the dream. It was like bizarro GH.
cNdkNYKOaa	i think he should be hung|`|IMPh53Ssaa	the boy is nuts, he is probably the next JASON guy with a hockey mask killing people at the lake, his mother in law was rather attractive, I hate it when attractive people are killed, plus she was pregnant! the boy is EVIL! I Think they should bury him alive|`|f87d0f66214d02653b0459a3f68f0303aa	Yes, I do. And it is Pennsylvania law that anybody over the age of 10 should be tried as an adult if they commit a crime. I think he is nuts.|`|KR1FdEZgaa	i don't think an 11 year old should have a gun! he most likely has some abuse issue's going on? he should get evaluated first. then if sane and not abused he should be tried as an adult.|`|ftvxAS3saa	he should go to prison til hes 50 years old<br>  <br>  but u know how shyt works he will get out at 18 - 21 years old<br>  <br>  these days r different, my grandpa got a shot gun when he was like 13 years old  but u should never have guns in the house with kids or pregnant women. we go crazy lol
1ENVigcfaa	Yes, I have been stalked several times.  It's horrible.  It's scary.  one of them in particular got so bad i was a afraid to leave the house.  i'd wake up and he'd be there outside my apartment.  he'd follow me to college, wait all day, and follow me back.  i started sneaking in and out with the help of friends, but in the end I had to go to the police because he just wouldn't leave me alone.  To this day i wonder if any of them are still watching....|`|NVbeFgjTaa	I've never been stalked myself but if i ever felt like i was i would be keeping a diary for at least a week or so before reporting it to the police.I would also let my family know how i felt so that they were aware of it.|`|qr16GzNnaa	yes, by a ex and yes I got the law involved I actually went and get myself a police man for a boy friend and after he found out that he stopped stalking me.|`|5faa7df1dbf6be8d22c72f7cca966e7baa	Yes, as a teenager I was stalked by an older boy in my school.  He would follow me everywhere I went, trying to start conversations, asking me out, and so forth.  The more I rebuffed him, the more aggressive he became in his stalking.  He started calling my house and saying all sorts of violent and dirty things to me over the phone.  He would try to peep into my windows.  He even tried to break into my house one day when I was home alone.  When he started telling me he was going to kidnap me, torture me, and then kill me, I told my mom who called the police.  After hearing my story, they decided to wire tap our phone.  When he called again, they traced the call to his home and immediately went and arrested him.  After a day in jail, he confessed and served some jail time.   If you haven't said anything to your mom, I urge you to do it now.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	yes i did have a stalker ,for some reason when i moved here this guy just decided that i should be interested in him. but as i began to get new friends and a bf it became difficult for my stalker because they would simply confront him, so i did not call the police.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	I was stalked once by an ex-boyfriend after we split up. He would continually call me and make death threats against me and my family. My mom or sister would have to walk me out to my car in the mornings because he was waiting for me on the side of the house a few times. He found me on the road driving and decided to harrass me by trying to get me to oull over, etc...we ended up having a wreck which was his fault. He also carved a very very very rude word into the hood of my car in foot tall letters the day after I got it out of the shop from the wreck. It was awful and scary and sad.<br>  <br>  I made police reports, etc, but they weren't much help. They even advised me against a restraining order because it's nearly impossible to catch someone who breaks one. He eventually went away after I told his mother about it all. This was a 28 year old man. Sad and pathetic.|`|BwZJXbSjaa	this one guy had a thing for me in college. he would come to my apartment and i would hide in the dark and pretend i wasnt there. he would sit there for hours. i would have to sneek out the back door and down to my car and leave. he really spooked me out. i never called the cops. i just tried to ignore him. eventually i started seeing a guy so he backed off.|`|mggll8dRaa	Not exactly, but had a very possessive Ex-GF.....!!|`|BBVfRheyaa	Yup.<br>  <br>  Money talks.|`|DhmUgq0maa	Yeah i have, my friend borrowed my mobile to text someone...i later found out it was 1 of her internet friends and he had saved my number an started calling me and harassing me then after a while he tracked down where lived an used to drive by an call me... i didn;t have to do anything about it because thankfully we moved to australia shortly after that.|`|AA10044154	Let me tell you what I've had to endure tonight.  Kinda like stalking...<br>  I work at a residential for seriously mentally ill homeless people.  An ex-resident has called me 16 times this shift alone.  He is delusional, thinks he's the CIA, FBI, talks about conspiracy.  The guy has an apartment across the street.  Said he's going to blow up this place.  Said he's got a wire that leads from here to his place.  I know it's just talk.  makes me mad|`|Y51w7dNUaa	yeah when i was 7 me and my bff had a stalker he'd try following us home from school(we walked some days)when we walked home alone and once we werewalking with our rents from the park and they went a bit ahead and got into a convo so he slowed his car down and eyed us very innapropriatly no one knows this tho cuz i just chose to move on and try to erase the memorys and trust issues i have now because of that :(|`|TIVrZ2I8aa	I hesitate to answer this question but....<br>  <br>  **What you are about to read may be disturbing**<br>  <br>  This is how I came up with my name.....<br>  <br>  I met a guy when I was 15 or so.  He was 19.  I didn't realize at the time, he had some serious mental problems.  We developed a crush on each other.  He would stand me up....parents didn't like him cuz he was older.<br>  <br>  For 3 years we would see each other off and on.  Years went by with no contact with each other, however, we had mutual friends that would relay life stories about each other.  After my second failed marriage, we reunited.<br>  <br>  I found out just how abusive he could be.  He was physically and mentally abusive.  We again had an on-again, off-again relationship for 10 years.  I had repeatedly called police on him for the abuse and he was arrested for harassment (for threats, mainly by phone).  I got orders of protection and when they expired, he would start his **** again (sorry to show such strong emotion).<br>  <br>  For several years, I had wanted to "get away" from him.  I knew the only way it would happen was if I met another man (which he constantly accused me of doing anyhow).  I hadn't been looking too hard cuz I was afraid to put time and energy into someone else when I was "comfortable" with "knowing" what to expect from him.<br>  <br>  I eventually got a call from a friend of a coworker that I gave my number to.  I was Really nervous to date.  I knew I needed to give it a try.  This was my chance to Finally get away from the abusive relationship.  Sooo, I took the leap and went out.<br>  <br>  The ex, at first, didn't believe I was involved with someone else so he would call my work and hang up (police wouldn't do anything about that cuz:<br>  1. No call ID at work, couldn't Prove who was calling and hanging up.<br>  2. Harassment Laws changed and physical violence was only way police would "do something"<br>  3. Police said he had the right to call whomever he chooses.<br>  <br>  I've tried to cancel myspace account so he can't check it out.  He has been blocked but would often check the home page profile to see what was going on with me.  We no longer have mutual friends.<br>  <br>  Ohhh, I failed to mention that he tried to run me off the road with his truck shortly after he realized I was not lying about another relationship or that I no longer wanted involvement with him.  I should have called the police.  I didn't want to stir his **** pot by "catering" to his belief that I wanted Anything to do with him.<br>  <br>  I forgot to mention that he would drive by my house and had threatened to "get into" my house anytime he wanted.  I was a little concerned.  I knew it could be just talk, a scare tactic (more mental abuse).  Again, the police won't do anything until he acts, especially cuz we had on-again, off-again relationship.<br>  <br>  A year and half later and he still thinks there will be time for us.  NEVER!!<br>  <br>  WOW!!  I needed to get that off my chest.  Please don't think any less of me.  Hence, Love is Blind(or stupid)!|`|PSk0zY5uaa	YES.... Brandon, in school i was the ONLY girl that was nice to him and then he started to follow me around. I would have to hide in the janitors closet to get away from him.|`|yU2WHyvgaa	I was stalked on youtube.. i was so scared i almost pissed myself lol. But then i deleted my account so it's all good|`|G0wGbdENaa	yh was funny, freakish girls|`|04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	I am sorry dear ... but I would simply have to shoot any stalker who was stupid enough to try that sh!t with me!!
069d241743d397f7bc4dca280e447738aa	Transitting Mars squaring the Asc is likely to be a time when the native is more aggressive and impulsive in their self-expression.  They are likely to be more dynamic and take the initiative on getting what it is they desire. More energy is available for accomplishing goals, especially personal ones. <br>  <br>   Negatively, if this energy is not harnessed properly, it may manifest as over-ambitious attitudes, combativeness, impassivity, sharp temper, over-competitiveness and aggressive. During this transit it would be good to be wary of fire, sharp objects, weapons, dangerous activities that can put the body to harm and if the native falls ill there may be a tendency to run high fevers.<br>  <br>  Positively this is a good time to take up an exercise program.|`|6ctxuU3Waa	nothing

WtjbCSnSaa	He is very elusive in telling anyone what/who the song is about.    JACKIE  -  By Scott Walker    And if one day I should become   A singer with a Spanish bum   Who sings for women of great virtue   I'd sing to them with a guitar   I borrowed from a coffee bar   Well, what you don't know doesn't hurt you   My name would be Antonio   And all my bridges I would burn   And when I gave them some they'd know   I'd expect something in return   I'd have to get drunk every night   And talk about virility   With some old grandmother   That might be decked out like a christmas tree   And though pink elephants I'd see   Though I'd be drunk as I could be   Still I would sing my song to me   About the time they called me "Jacky"     If I could be for only an hour   If I could be for an hour every day   If I could be for just one little hour   Cute in a stupid *** way     And if I joined the social whirl   Became procurer of young girls   Then i would have my own bordellos   My record would be number one   And I'd sell records by the ton   All sung by many other fellows   My name would then be handsome Jack   And I'd sell boats of opium   Whisky that came from Twickenham   Authentic queers   And phony virgins   If I had banks on every finger   A finger in every country   And every country ruled by me   I'd still know where I'd want to be   Locked up inside my opium den   Surrounded by some china men   I'd sing the song that I sang then   About the time they called me "Jacky"     If I could be for only an hour   If I could be for an hour every day   If I could be for just one little hour   Cute in a stupid *** way     Now, tell me, wouldn't it be nice   That if one day in paradise   I'd sing for all the ladies up there   And they would sing along with me   And we be so happy there to be   Cos' down below is really nowhere   My name would then be Junipher   Then I would know where I was going   And then I would become all knowing   My beard so very long and flowing   If I became deaf, dumb and blind   (was: If I could play deaf, dumb and blind)   Because I pitied all mankind   And broke my heart to make things right   I know that every single night   When my angelic work was through   The angels and the Devil too   Would sing my childhood song to me   About the time they called me "Jacky"     If I could be for only an hour   If I could be for an hour every day   If I could be for just one little hour   Cute in a stupid *** way

I think they say one minute per year of age is appropriate. He probably won't even remember what the big deal was about after that. He's exploring the world in his way--try to see it from his perspective.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide to do, please do it calmly. He learns how to deal with problems by watching how you react to situations.|`|PjvaWVEVaa	I really have a mean, smart azz answer like why don't you get off the computer and watch him, but I'd never say that to you cause I love you so much.

I can only laugh at this! Mine have done it more than once.|`|XIRqDfUpaa	Help him clean it up.  Or rather make him help you clean it up.<br>  A timeout would be proper, but a short one, and a brief lecture about making messes.<br>  <br>  The variables are, did he know it was wrong, or was he just being creative and having a good time with a new-found toy?  Did he learn this from somebody else?  And how in the world did he get to the toilet paper in the first place?  He is after all 3 years old.  But now that he knows that you do not like that kind of behavior, if he does it again, DROP THE HAMMER!|`|Auw4eHf5aa	You should have locked him in his kennel..|`|AA11656721	He was entertaining himself with the tp.  But he needs to know that tp is not a toy, and if he wants to be creative use his art supplies and paper.  Then put him on a time out for 10 - 15 mins.

hnjHxQqaaa	I technically love the Korean version. :)<br>  I think it's incredibly amazing. Even though I haven't seen the other versions. But my cousin likes watching the Korean version too even though she've seen the taiwanese. And she also doesn't understand what their saying in Korean haha. ;D..|`|C2NBfmSGaa	My views:<br>  <br>  Japanese Anime:<br>  I actually watched the anime version first and it would be my last before I entered the world of dramas. =P<br>  When I first watched it, I had had no idea that shoujo anime existed. Up till that point, I'd only heard and watched shounen series (because of my brother). So, needless to say, as a girl, I fell in LOVE with it. I adored the anime. Yet, I couldn't quite shake this feeling that I felt: this feeling of uncompleteness. I mean, seriously, Makino never ONCE states that she liked Domyouji. Furthermore, at the end, it was like she was FORCED to go with Domyouji on the cruise ship. (The reason she stops the boat is because she gets pissed at Domyouji due to that fake note). So, I always had this feeling that Domyoujij was the one that liked Makino, while Makino just went along with it because she had no choice. (Like, WTH?)<br>  <br>  Next, my friend introduced me to dramas when I stated that I had liked the anime.<br>  Thus... :<br>  <br>  Taiwan Live-Action (Meteor Garden)<br>  Didn't like it, never will. It was my first drama and I didn't know such amazing things existed so I was okay with it at the time, but even then, at the end... I still couldn't like it. Not being prejudiced or anything against Taiwan, but it was poorly done. The acting was VERY mediocre. I didn't feel the "love" between them and also, it kinda lost my attention because I didn't find the series physically appealing. (They were all in bleh costumes, and the setting was kinda boring...)<br>  When I found out that there was a Meteor Garden II, I refused to watch it... I didn't even contemplate it. I could already tell it was going to be pointlessly slow and uninterestingly long from my experience in the first season.And then, I watched a bunch of other Taiwan dramas because I was too unadventurous to try out Japanese and Korean.<br>  <br>  THEN, I stumbled upon Hana Yori Dango, the Japanese live-action.<br>  <br>  Japanese Live Action (Hana Yori Dango)<br>  I LOVED IT.<br>  I ABSOLUTELY loved it.<br>  Not only was it beautifully directed, the scenery and choice of setting (the school) was pleasing and actually had that "high class school" look to it, thus giving a setting that is vital to the story. The actors and actresses were AMAZING! MatsuJun and Inoue Mao had unbelievable chemistry and even the friendship between the F4 was cute. I was a little taken aback, though, because it was COMPLETELY different from the anime and T-drama (while similar in other ways). But, I LIKED this type of different.<br>  <br>  Little did I know that the J-drama actually followed the manga a LOT more closely than the anime. I came upon a site with FREE MANGA (OMG!) and I decided to start reading the HYD manga version, the original, the one that started it all (Thank you, Yoko Kamio, mangaka god!)<br>  <br>  I noticed that you didn't mention the manga version and so, I HIGHLY suggest you read it. I thought Japanese version was really good and amazing and everything, but the manga is 10x better than all the other versions put together. It was cute, sad, funny and although it was a bunch of drawings, the story seemed to come to life. It was amazing and beautifully done. The drawings in the beginning were not that great, but as the series goes on, Yoko Kamio's drawings get better and better, not to mention that her story line also gets a lot better, as well. The porrtrayal of Domyouji's mother was not that well done in the anime and Meteor Garden (we leave the series, completely hating the mother, or atleast I did) and it was pretty well-done in the J-drama, where I actually liked her in the end (and we see a sweeter side of her in the FINAL movie) BUT... the mother is beyond redeemed in the manga. In HYD J-dorama, in the FINAL movie, Domyouji's mother is smiling and everything (la la la ~) but it was a little too sudden, and un-Domyouji Kaede to me. In the manga, she remains a reserved, controlled person, but we still end up being guilty for ever hating her and misunderstanding her.<br>  <br>  Well, those are my views (gah, I wrote so much! =O)<br>  But, I seriously do recommend you read the manga, because the manga is THE best version of the lot.|`|4JTdvXfDaa	i dont, i dont even know what show that is<br>  but i love japanese drama ..... fun!|`|Z91ePgTsaa	Umm you're talking about the live action not the anime right?<br>  <br>  The Taiwanese was quite good in the 1st season but then got dragging in the 2nd one, to the point that I couldn't wait for it to finish.<br>  <br>  The Japanese one was better in a way, straight to the point, and Domyogi was quite funny.<br>  <br>  The Korean one, well am not liking much Jan Di, I can't see much chemistry, on the other hand Joon Pyo is awesome. I'm also liking the fact that in this version it seems that finally I'm going to see some story between her best friend and Yi Jung, which wasn't there in the other versions. <br>  <br>  So it's a tie between the Japanese and the Korean one at the moment.
0d8vPBMwaa	In Win a Date With Tad Hamilton, it takes the guy a long time to tell his best friend that he wants to be with her. In 10 Things I Hate About You, the girl says no to going out with the guy several times before agreeing. In A Cinderella Story, the guy has a hard time finding the girl and getting her to agree to see him again. In The Prince and Me, the guy comes onto the girl a couple times, kind of rudely, until she eventually sees the good in him. In Grease 2, the guy asked the girl to go out with him a few times, but it wasn't until she saw him in a different light, that they ended up together. In Coyote Ugly, the guy pursues the girl for a little while before she agrees to go out with him. In He's Just Not That Into You, one of the girls comes on to one of the guys a couple of times but it takes him quite a while to realize that she is who he wants.

bn8OZrYSaa	it means: "you dont have to stay with me"|`|ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	Melvin had a way of being rude and this incident was no exception. He didn't want his boss to stand next to him and continue in her conversation, since he was not a "people-person". He lacked good socialization skills. It was rare for him to allow someone, ANYONE--like the waitress (Helen Hunt)-- to to be physically and emotionally connected to him. His boss was merely showing normal kindness and an attempt to connect with Melvin but he rebuffed her. She started to tell him about her son or daughter being accepted into a prestigious school, if I remember right. Melvin didn't care to "share" so it upset his colleague.|`|bLHhNYTJaa	lol it's kinda weird cuz "wait with" is the most fundamental terms I can think of explaining it in.<br>  <br>  He's not waiting FOR the woman...Melvin is waiting for something (else) and I guess he's telling the woman executive she doesn't have to keep him company during the wait. <br>  <br>  Which is probably what caused the woman to get upset because she prolly likes him or something and expected him to want her to wait with him but got disappointed.<br>  <br>  I haven't seen the movie...but the phrase itself isn't something deep...|`|7z6BWoESaa	uhhmmm I think you are making it more complicated then it needs to be, I think it just means, you dont have to wait "here" with me its not complicated just means what it says you dont have to wait with me. the end : ) now you got me confused lol|`|3ZSsBYtnaa	. . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-‘”. . . . . . . . . .``~.,<br>  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-”. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .“-.,<br>  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ”:,<br>  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,<br>  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}<br>  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}<br>  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:”. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .“~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./<br>  . . . . . . /(_. . ”~,_. . . ..“~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/<br>  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .”=,_. . . .“-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~”; /. .. .}<br>  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .”=-._. . .“;,,./`. . /” . . . ./. .. ../<br>  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..“~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../<br>  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-”<br>  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\<br>  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__<br>  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,<br>  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__|`|3uI0JAAwaa	It is like waiting for something, but when you are waiting with, there is another person waiting for it along side you.

Since the Yellowcard post got me thinking about their old labelmates, Park, I will tell you about them.    Park is from Springfield, Illinois.   They formed in 1996 and Didn't have any intention when they named the band that, it was only a suggestion.  On their third and final album "Building a better" it featured a song call "Mississippi Burning" which was about another Illinois band, The Junior Varsity, who one of their member's girlfriend's was kidnapped, murdered and burned because she was in and interracial relationship.|`|D2WLPK0gaa	?

With only a 3-week deadline to form a band, Krug contacted a fellow Canadian guitarist Dan Boeckner (formerly of British Columbia band Atlas Strategic) and began writing songs in Krug's apartment.[1] Initially using a drum machine for their rhythm section played through computer speakers, Krug later invited Arlen Thompson to the lineup as the drummer;[2] however, the newly formed trio rehearsed as a full band only the day before their first show.[2] During the tour, Wolf Parade recorded and released their self-titled debut EP (referred to as the 4 Song EP) in 2003.    In 2004, Hadji Bakara joined Wolf Parade, contributing his synthesizer and sound manipulation skills to the lineup.[1] Within the year, the band released its second independent, self-titled EP, commonly referred to as the 6 Song EP.    Dante DeCaro (formerly of Hot Hot Heat) joined in 2005 as a second guitarist and percussionist.[1] Wolf Parade was signed to Sub Pop Records by Isaac Brock of Modest Mouse. On its new record label, the band released its first widely-distributed EP, Wolf Parade, in July 2005.    In September 2005, the band's debut album Apologies to the Queen Mary was released on Sub Pop Records to critical acclaim, earning a 2006 Polaris Music Prize nomination.[3]    The second album, At Mount Zoomer, followed in June 2008.    Also in 2008, Sub Pop employees sent threatening letters to blogs posting Wolf Parade songs as part of the RIAA campaign against piracy.    An on-stage announcement[4] in November 2008 that Dante DeCaro would no longer be playing with the band was later revealed to have been a joke.[5]|`|3741eaacaa2e86184f69536884e1b3f5aa	yea this question is pretty much a death trap for me because if i fully answered it then i'd be typing for a few hours and then be editing it with more for days. lol i'd just like to share that xD.|`|1SBundNFaa	the almost is a one-man band that was formed as another project by the drummer of underoath. my brother listens to more of the almost than me, but i still love underoath.

A housecoat is a cover-up, and can be used to keep you warm when it is too cold.<br>  <br>  However, quite often, people use both terms interchangeably.

9SSO454taa	this is not a question to English this is a question to the hole of the UK. There should be less people coming in i'm not being racist to polish workers but at the moment there is to many people out of work its something like 1.8 million, if them people can't get work i don't think polish workers got a chance to get a job in the UK. I don't want to see polish people living on the streets it be better for them to stay in Poland till the job market improves.|`|FvfPzI7Taa	Well I wouldn't say Polish people are given 'priority' over British-born people when it comes to jobs - quite the opposite, really.<br>  <br>  Although Poland's entrance into the EU has given some of the country's more enterprising citizens the opportunity to better their lot in places like the UK, they still make up an extremely small percentage of the workforce, and most of those jobs are within the hospitality and services sector.<br>  <br>  I think you're simplifying the argument too much. By-and-large, if you're British born and have even a basic education you are more likely to earn more throughout your lifetime than someone from Poland.|`|ieTOMSbWaa	I think it is discusting that they come and take our jobs that said though they are prepared to do the jobs that we english are not for a salary we are not.

People CHOOSE to hire foreign workers because they work harder than the British. Seriously if you lose your job and get replaced by someone with no formal education and has only limited knowledge of English.... you deserve to lose your job. I believe in free markets, employers should have the right to chose whoever they want as employees.<br>  <br>  So what should be done about this situation? Nothing!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Serious why should the government have the right to tell companies who they can and can't higher?|`|816d0234ce66aef35ce88055d2729beeaa	I agree that the British should be given first priority in jobs but on a   professional level<br>  <br>   Only IF <br>  <br>  1) They have the right qualifications for a given job such as teaching or medicine. <br>  <br>  2)  If sufficient experienced manpower is available.<br>  <br>  I could say more but keeping to the above main points.|`|TFV8RLiQaa	what is your evidence to support your assertion? I heard the PM say British work for Bitish workers. And- how far back should WE go to "send them back?" You may not know the Royal family are from Germany and the present husband of the Queen strongly objected to changing his name, from four German names, before he was eligible to marry. And when he did, he had an immediate salary increase from 400 pounds a year to 10,000 pounds, a year.And could then afford to buy his own clothes.|`|FkFKDpt5aa	england is a very multicutural country<br>  i live in london, im british born indian.<br>  london is veryvery multicultural however, i do agree that alot of foriegn people who cannot speak a word of english get a job straight away, unlike some people who have worked hard to get where they are at and can speak english takes time to get a job<br>  <br>  some people just laze around letting the council pay for them|`|9ADVLFOnaa	How many British people have relatives who have emigrated to Australia, Canada, America and so on...? Should they all be sent back to Britain or is it ok for us to move to other countries but not for them to move here? double standards that.<br>  We have a lot of Polish people in Scotland too and I have to say that service from them in cafes and restaraunts has been better that service from some locals.I do believe there should be tighter controls on who they allow in, for example a murderer was let into Scotland and he then went on to murder again but you cannot tar everyone with the same brush but treat each case individually and see a person not just an immigrant.|`|0e33e812d76b8f8fe9810d0893f6e0b7aa	Other European countries are too experiencing a recession.

But he doesn't treat Lily right and I just don't think the two of them are meant to be together anymore.  Lily had told Billy to tell Kane that he was the father, or else she would.  She didn't say that to Kane when he was blasting her.  It really wasn't her place unless Billy or Chloe had never told him.  And she had just found out and was shocked as well, since she was dating Billy.  Rumor has it her birth control failed her and she will be pregnant by Billy as well.  I can't imagine Kane raising 2 of Billy's kids.|`|msUIsv8maa	The way the storyline is going it looks like Billy & Chloe are gonna get together cane needs to except the truth because i think when they go to court and it comes out hes not the Father he wont have a leg to stand on he needs to just except the fact and move on.|`|vvgC20BHaa	I used to like Cane and Lilly together. Now that he's behaving like such a creep, it would serve him right if he never got Lilly back!<br>  <br>  I hope Lilly and Chloe both go after Billy!!!!!!!!!!! What an interesting triangle that would make!!!!!!!!!!!|`|fcPiQDwEaa	I agree with Cane. Lily and him will get back together l think but why should Cane just step aside now that the baby is born and Billy suddenly grew a half of backbone and decides he wants to be the baby's daddy!|`|75zggy81aa	Cane wasn't going to leave Chloe for Lily when he was in the hospital with the baby while chloe was still sick and he still thought delia was his. He thought he was beginning to love his baby mama- oops. Everyone doesn't understand why he was mad at Lily BUT if i were in Lily's shoes I would have told him before he was able to make it into the cabin! It may not have been her place but if she cares about him she should have had the decency of sparing him the pain of further attachment.<br>  <br>  As for Chloe and Billy- i would really like to see them reunite and raise delia. Cane is over stepping his boundaries and ruining his love life in the process. I like Chloe (only recently) and I am glad she lived to mother her child- Cane has no buisness raising that child.|`|r7sgshwKaa	I feel your pain. I sort of like the Billy and Lilly thing though. I think he really did fall for her and I think they have more chemistry than Lilly and Cane. Poor Billy, he finally finds someone he really cares about and look what happens to him. I think its quite sad. As for Chloe well...she's toast no matter what she does. Wait till Jill gets a hold of her. There will be some smoke in the city on that day. And as for Cane, after the way he blasted Lilly and puffing and beating his chest about that baby, I would just tell him to kick rocks. Screw it.

AA11601079	I LOVED "Moulin Rouge," so I'd have to recommend one of Baz Luhrmann's earlier movies, "Strictly Ballroom." It was so good! The dancing is incredible, even if the music is less memorable. Also, movies like "Chicago," the 2007 musical version of "Hairspray," and even "Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" for style and music. Finally, maybe something like "Almost Famous" for the music.|`|xGmhDTWwaa	Romeo and Juliet or American Beauty :o)|`|OHqjrNCJaa	little shop of horrors.

654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	I'm a big fan of the show, and the woman who is the basis for the show, the real Allison Du Bois.

pI5EAAUcaa	Harley was seeing Cyrus for a while. Then she found out that Cyrus was seeing Cassie behind her back and so she left the country during the summer. She hasn't come back. Her house was sold to Marina and AC, but the Spauldings rented it for the summer last year because Bill Lewis and Dinah had taken control of Spaulding Enterprises and the house. <br>  In real life, since Gus was written off the show as dying and Olivia got his heart, Harley(Beth Ethers) decided she wanted to leave the show too, so that is why the wrote her as leaving the country. You can catch the actress and the actor who played Gus, both on All My Children now playing the characters of Dr. Jake Martin and Taylor (female Iraqi war vet). <br>  Maybe they'll recast Harley or try to win her back to the show. Who knows. Being that Phillip has been gone for 5 years and is now back on the show, you never know. <br>  And it's so interesting how many people from Guiding Light move to All My Children. The man who plays Dr. David Hayword use to be Lujack and he and Beth were the hot couple back in the early 1980's, before her and Phillip. <br>  Though the guy that now plays Reva's son Shayne came from All My Children after Harley and Gus (now Taylor and Jake) moved to that show. He played Jonathan Lavery. <br>  Lots of soap people swapping lately.|`|bh8AjH3Taa	here in 2009 she is off the show. She helped this kid Rave who is Natalias son escape from the police.

Gus on Guiding Light Died from a Motor Cycle crash.|`|l0opvMfGaa	Harley and Gus get maried n Gus are now out of show|`|hThvZftvaa	harley and gus did get married and were happy until harley's daughter daisy(susan) brought back gus's highschool girlfriend natalia. natalia had a son rafe. rafe was gus's son. gus was in a motorcycle accident on his way to the hospital to help olivia. natalia being his current wife gave olivia his heart. but before thet everyone was saying goodbye to gus and he and harley were talking and gus told harley that she was the love of his life and he was sorry for what happened between them.<br>  <br>  now gus was a "dirty cop" by doing favors for people to get olivia moved up on the transplant list. when this was found out rafe wanted to save his fathers name and was going to shoot jeffery but jeffery taked him out of it and the mallet came into the room adn scared rafe and the gun went off. rafe ran off and was hiding and daisy found him and called harley. harley told him that if he was gus's son he was her sona and she would protect him so they went on the run. <br>  <br>  rafe came back but harley couldn't come back because of everything that went on with cyrus adn so she is now living in greece. zach and jude are also living with her.
e663a3eea9acd94ea0c82d74d58bb3cbaa	1. Yes, Ryan was on the show last episode. He knows that he is William's son. <br>  2. Yes, they have, but they did have some trouble at the beginning. The baby will be born this coming Sunday. <br>  3. They are still together, but they are having problems. So I wouldn't really say they are happy. <br>  4. No, Tommy hasn't left the show yet, but in the previews for this Sunday they said someone will die and someone will born, so obviously it will  be Tommy who dies and then Kitty and Robert's baby will be born.|`|l0opvMfGaa	i don't know about this show|`|CUEco2LEaa	The other answers have given accurate answers to your first three questions. Tommy will leave soon. He tries to get Holly out of the business using an illegal method and is sent to prison. I don't think he dies. Getty is just getting on everyone's nerves on set and I think they would want the option of bringing him back.|`|EL3cRenjaa	Yes, Ryan is in the picture and knows the truth<br>  This Sunday the lady is having the baby for Kitty and Robert<br>  Justin and Rebecca  are together, but not so happy right now<br>  Tommy is still on the show

NQ37mnWkaa	Well, Fleetwood Mac happen to be one of my favourite bands, but I really don't know about that...<br>  <br>  I think maybe it's taking the 'penguin' motif a little too far ~ it's really only John McVie that it is associated with. Also, the "Unleashed" tour includes music from their origins in 1967 to the present day, so it should really have some reference to Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, and Jeremy Spencer, etc.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think they are fine with this classic logo :<br>  <a href="http://www.gasolinealleyantiques.com/celebrity/images/Rock/buckle-fleetwood.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.gasolinealleyantiques.com/cel...</a>|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	Been a fan forever.

BJIo6twUaa	When it came out yes it was scary. As a kid, watching horror movies all the time, my dad said this was the only movie that had me sticking to him like glue. Also had the lights out and it was storming outside.<br>  <br>  But after seeing all the movies today, i wouldnt say its all that scary but its a good movie. But in the time it came out, yes it was scary.|`|oJqxaDRSaa	Alien scared the hell out of me as a kid!

Another Translating group decided to start scanning the manga from where the anime left off which is chapter 32-46<br>  <br>  But then This manga got licensed.

e4h5yVXgaa	Ugh don't remind me!<br>  Those were the days :)<br>  I've been working since I was 16.<br>  <br>  When I got my first salary it was straight out of college at 21. It was 50k based, with comission. Okay at the time I had no bills, a brand new car, my parents paid for everything else and lets just put it this way, my only bill was my cell phone. My way of looking at it was this: "I'm only young once!". Barely working full-time. I didn't want to buy a house. I wasn't going to get married anytime soon. I'm just way too unpredictable (that I do know). So I LIVED it up!!! For three years! My Christmas bonuses included!. I spent the majority on really expensive restaurants, alcohol, spas, partying, traveling and shopping. It was awesome! I lived that way and even got another car (though I just paid 3k for the down pymt) and had some trips paid for, during that time. At one time I did pay for a home...<br>  <br>  Now that I am 24, I look back and have no regrets. I had a great time! And now I'm just like okay I am ready to start investing and expanding my career ie; become independent which means responsibility (a huge part of that responsibility will mean saving money). So now I am in the process of readjusting my income and how I spend it, simply bc I want to take my career to much higher ground. I am more than happy to do all this, I'm more than ready.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, I think that everyone is different. They all have their own visions. you may be the type that wants a family right away, so the feeling of saving your salary for a home would give you great satisfaction. And to read that I basically squandered my first three salaries away to pennies, may sound horrifying to you. Who knows. I say ask yourself what do you want to do? Who are you? And even if it sounds crazy given in a little. You don't have to grow up asap. I mean you obtained that salary on your own. I'm sure you know what you are doing.<br>  <br>  Do I believe in saving? Sure|`|50dfad07d8ee2b10b7bb6c48c0f62037aa	I tend to do a combination of both. I spend money on things I want even if I don't need it. However, at the same time, I am extremely "money sensitive" (looking for bargains, comparing prices, puking at the sight of large price tags, etc) and will save at any chance I get, if that makes sense.<br>  <br>  ~Libra|`|AA11899483	i can never save money, i spend it as it comes. i love buying things. im deff a risk taker with money and like spending it on other people.<br>  <br>  with my first ever pay, i brought my newborn baby cousin clothes, toys and a cot, bought my mum and my lil bros clothes, gave some money to charity, the only thing i bought for myself was some cigarettes. <br>  <br>  scorpio sun and rising, taurus moon, sagg in 2nd house with uranus and neptune in 2nd house, mars in gemini in 8th house.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I have a hard time saving money.

zK1V9Mu7aa	Go to www.channel4.com and click on Deal or No Deal, if they are looking for contestants they will say on their site. I doubt they are at the moment, because they were looking for contestants just before christmas, with the end date being in Jan 09, so you have just missed that one.

They are by invitation only and who you know. Locations are usually kept secret till the last minute to prevent fans from showing up and causing problems.
1e3gBZY9aa	I think the other ending would be great. I love that movie. The first time I saw it, it really made me think and look at it from both sides. Ed completely changes his outlook on life, only to be killed by a black student. It's an awesome movie.|`|Pg1pqrJ6aa	First off, I haven't seen the alternate ending.  Secondly, the regular ending is in no way "happy".  The regular ending just shows how the cycle of hate keeps on spinning and taking lives with it.  The alternate ending just goes further to show how that cycle is perpetuated.|`|njFhy3MKaa	it really wasn't a happy ending with danny dying it was kinda sad but it is better than dereck going back to a skin head|`|96AQZUGyaa	I think it was more realistic although I liked the theatrical ending. The whole movie had some really good messages and lessons in it, much more than the average film and I think it should have had two endings. However I think the theatrical ending is better in showing that there are more ways to life than violence and hate. The alternate ending, though probably more realistic, is a little depressing in that it makes it seem that extremism is the way to go.<br>  <br>  Frankly it depends on the person... some people would have been overwhelmed with hate and gone back to the "dark side" but some would have not. I can understand why he would go back to Nazism. He learns to overcome hate and prejudice and when he gets a normal life back a stereotypical gang-banger black kills his brother.|`|AA12211242	i prefer rise above ending. <br>  i think this movie doest just try to tell a good story, but also to make people think, understand or maybe even learn.<br>  <br>  showing him going back to his bad ways will just ruin the idea of the movie.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: oh and i didnt see the alternate ending...
gSUU3Tk3aa	Jonas Brothers. I see them too much.|`|AA12397532	George W Bush - He has brought the most prosperous nation of the world to almost on the edge of poverty. Instead of bettering the lot of his own people - the amricans, he has been squandring money, donating it to -pakistan on one pretext or the other, while his countrymen gradually continued losing jobs. He was and still is too arrogant to do anybody any good. He is one American president, who is responsible for killing the most Americans young boys by sending them to fight other people's wars. (Vietnam was an exception). I certainly do hate him and pig mug!|`|7lCJWU52aa	brad n jo. im sick of seeing these two. and isnt it funny how they never show there kids faces, until the day before the awards they come out carrying all kids. all about PUBLICITY.

cr5TQgmUaa	When Cane told Jill and Esther that he had named her Cordelia he also said that it means 'Heart'.|`|r7sgshwKaa	I don't remember either but it is unusually pretty. She's gonna freak when she actually has to spell all those names when she gets older though.|`|vO9fPCm2aa	I have no idea really and when Cane named her that I too wondered where did it come from. It's nice though unusual too. :~)|`|rYA2KCnUaa	tou mean Cordelia "delia" for short come from heart so he had decided to name her that while Chloe was in the coma.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	I looked up the name and it's meaning is heart or jewel of the sea.<br>  Shakespeare's play Lear had a character named Cordellia and she was portrayed as a loveable, virtuous woman of "rare" honesty.

Go home from the hospital, already!!   hahaha.|`|cr5TQgmUaa	I really doubt it. Christel Khalil has been doing such a great job lately. Even Jamie Giddons had high praise for her recent work: <br>  <br>  "I know I've been hard on Christel Khalil, but the actress really impressed me in her scenes where Lily blasted Chloe (Elizabeth Hendrickson) and Billy (Billy Miller) about their dirty, little baby secret this past week. For the first time in awhile it felt like Khalil was holding her own and even showed that she has the potential to make the character every bit her late mother's daughter.|`|YJlCKreSaa	I had this rumor a couple of months ago.  She is going to be in a car wreck and her face will be disfigured and then she will be replaced.  But then nothing came of it, so I don't know if its true or not.  But I hope not, because I really like this Lily.  I hate it when they change the characters on us.|`|DhUMjZxtaa	I haven't!! NOOO I liked this lily..<br>  <br>  and you know what cane..just shut the heck up, let billy have the kid and get back with lily and HAVE A GREAT LIFE ok thanx|`|r7sgshwKaa	Geez I hope not. I didn't care for the last Lilly she was just a bit too abrasive for me. But you know the soaps, nothing stays the same forever.|`|751mdpcBaa	i hope there not! they have already replaced her and this one does such a good job...<br>  <br>  i hate kane; his blind; lily loves him; hes an asss!|`|bh8AjH3Taa	They are replacing her again. Now I know why I stopped watching .|`|uUzbqGh5aa	I haven't heard anything. I wonder if it's because she's recently married and wants to take a break with her husband.
uUzbqGh5aa	I think that Esther will blab her mouth and tell Roger all that Jill told her, and Roger will take her to where Mrs C is and tie her up there too. Then l think Paul will get involved and he and maybe Kevin and Amber will save the both of them.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Emaryl Diamond, I was thinking the same thing yesterday when I was seeing how good Kay's makeup looked!<br>  <br>  I think the lady will help her because Kay knows how to push her buttons a little.  She is trying to tell her she can be a strong woman too.  She said it's inside her, just like it was inside the woman in the book she is reading.  <br>  <br>  She also is making the lady begin to doubt (her brother?) and his lack of honesty.|`|rYA2KCnUaa	I have had that same feeling yesterday when I had watched the show...I think eventually she is going to feel some type of sympathy for ms c.|`|vqUVWPBAaa	The first Mrs. Roger Wilkes and yes, Katherine will win her over.

p2CJ8zNEaa	the market is to fragmented in NYC and the big news/talk stations dominate the city morning drive market|`|fguZQZcaaa	There have been several in the past, but due to a lack of listeners they have all gone out of business or changed formats.

16t0eV0Uaa	The Shins are very much a great band.  They have turned out some of the best music in the past 10 years or so,  very accessible, yet very poetic.

Lot's of pausing also helps so your audience won't know what's coming next,but sometimes people might not laugh at your jke so think of another joke.Here's what your NOT supoosed to say if you want to tell a funny joke, "Here's a joke for you,it's really funny" or "Did you hear the one about.." or "Stop me if you've heard this one before" and finally don't say" Do you want to hear a joke?"  ....make funny faces and maybe clown around a litttle....remember, if people don't laugh, it doesn't mean their not laughing in the inside(cuz they might just be)...KNock KNock! Who's there? "Little old lady." Little old lady who? "I didn't know you could yodel!" ..oh and What always ends with everything? Answer: 'The letter "G!!"..well good luck

b146bf3f7e2e162a7266cd68a0222d22aa	Your bedroom or the bus with headphones would be a good place.
QAwwmDuDaa	Take it as a gentle hint that she dosen't see you as boyfriend material,but that could change in time so just keep your cool and be her friend for now.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Polls and Surveys.  Yes and no answers.  Why would be a third part of the equation.  The poll would indicate how many people will answer similar to the other observers and how many will answer differently.  I will say the girl you like wants to be friends and no more.  She may think if you don't get more than for a response you would be hurt.  Some people find it difficult to accept friendship.  True friends could discuss this issue and perhaps you did not indicate you wanted to without bias to your own feelings.|`|rH31CwjMaa	141|`|6bxOT9qJaa	Sorry to say....but it's over....<br>  <br>  She feels that you are harassing her now. She feels like you don't get the message she's trying to tell you. So now, she's ignoring you.<br>  <br>  I know it hurts you to the core. We've all been there before.|`|BwZJXbSjaa	she is prolly being nice but thinks your a weirdo stalker. thats just being honest. and you cant love someone without knowing them completely. everyone is different behind closed doors|`|rEWZWZi5aa	she no like you|`|GguxwW21aa	Maybe you told her something that made her feel uncomfortable and now she wants some space? Just give it time. If she goes for weeks without answering your calls then maybe you should send her an email explaining yourself in a proper manner, and if she chooses to ignore that then move on.|`|f02fdd44028e78a86a13cf15a8da31e7aa	That's because she don't love you in that way and you are stalking her and making her uncomfortable. STOP calling her. Give a little space and MAYBE someday you can be friends again. <br>  MOVE ON.|`|kYgblA7Faa	dont call her like obsessively that could freak her out lol so just chill she might not want to lead you on if she only likes you as a friend|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Leave mesages. Go to her house. Something to let her know how you feel for her.|`|50ly9o5taa	You want to show her you love her... She wants to show you you're just friends.|`|uQUqZ7k5aa	maybe you go to her house  with boom box and play Peter Gabriel's In Your Eyes until she loves you again|`|rVPrhd26aa	because your a wanker|`|Up6ANLQeaa	lol!! sorry I shouldn't laugh....you know maybe she doesn't answer because you're acting a tad stalkerish?! Back off,give her space and go from there...|`|bmJf3AVPaa	she doesn't want to talk to you.  get the hint, move on.|`|Fu7KQieyaa	She probably knows that you like her "that way" and doesn't want to lead you on. She said she likes you as a friend, and my guess is that if she used those words or anything like it, she knows that you're reciprocating a little bit more than she's comfortable with. She's comfortable being your friend and nothing more right now, I think that if you went out of your way to "show her", which you're obviously trying to do, it would make her less comfortable with you even as a friend.<br>  <br>  Since you're both already friends, even if she doesn't answer her phone, your best bet is to respect her decision to remain just friends and get over it. Besides, in my own experience, girls don't really go for the whole 'confession-of-one's-undying-love' thing. That's a great way to scare her off from even being your friend.|`|uRqm4Bxcaa	Dude, calm down.  If she's not that into you, taking it personally and getting stressed out about it is the worst thing you could do...  Just find another girl.  A friend of mine used to say if it doesn't work out and you're devastated, then go date ten other women.  You'll forget about her or at least be able to pinpoint what you liked about her and then find something like that later on.<br>  <br>  Work on yourself bro, she's given you signs to move on.

7113d2ecd54bd8e6d4704f58cb73decbaa	A.R.Rahman's Tamil movie songs (esp in his younger age 1990's to 2000) are more fantastic than the songs in Slumdog. That's for sure.<br>  <br>  Songs in tami movies like Roja, Bombay, Duet, Jodi, Kadhalar Dhinam, Kadhalan, Kandukonden Kandukonden, Alaipayuthey etc; to name few ..... music and songs were simly awesome in these movies.<br>  <br>  Even A.R.Rahman in his recent interview with a tamil magazine had openly said "I did not work hard for Slumdog like many of my movies".<br>  <br>  In fact "Jai Ho" was not originally scored for Slumdog .... it was scored for some Subhash Gai's (bollywood director) hindi movie. Subhash did not like the song and he excluded from his movie .... while danny bole liked and used in his film "Slumdog".<br>  <br>  Well, the fact is sometimes in life ..... luck is very much on our side and we end up winners for those works that is not our best!<br>  <br>  But, A.R. RAHMAN DESERVES OSCAR!  Not for Slumdog in particular but in general for his capability in the music world!<br>  <br>  Many film personalities are equally talented and have excelled in Film world but due to lack of luck they have not got OSCARS.<br>  <br>  Ilaiyaraja, Tamil Music director (Remember A.R. Rahman was working in his troop before 1992 when he himself became Music director) is considered the Best in Tamilnadu. But, he has not got OSCAR!<br>  <br>  Similar is the case with music directors Burman and many more.<br>  <br>  So, I feel RAHMAN deserves OSCAR but Slumdog is no where near his best performance .... and Luck is the key when you have done all the hard work.|`|giknlxZIaa	I agree with you 100%. There is no reason why Indians should be happy about the Oscar awards for Slumdog Millionaire. AR Rahman got an award for a song that was neither his best, nor India's best. Everything else in the movie was selectively chosen to suit Western audience's stereotypes about India. Read more about my thoughts on the subject here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://kaulonline.com/blog/2009/02/how-is-slumdog-an-indian-movie" rel="nofollow">http://kaulonline.com/blog/2009/02/how-i...</a>|`|AA12397532	You seem to have got the whole issue wrong.<br>  Yes SlumDog is not Rehman's best work - but, one should not doubt his talent. Let the award be for A,B,C,D or any film - the question is his talent has been recognised on a world platform.<br>  As far as other Indian talented performers - Yes we do have, but unfortunately, they are not eligible for oscars, as only films made by members of Academy of Motion Pictures and its allied respective associations are eligible for the Main Awards. Films made in india fall in foreign film category - where it has to compete with the entire film making world. moreover, there is only one award for foreign films - no technical or performance awards.<br>  Oscar is purely for films and technicians from US, Canada and Britain.|`|DT6QFP7Yaa	Dear friend OSCAR is OSCAR.ARR has been nominated for that.There may be much better Indian song composers but non of them except Gulzar have won ed .Many song composers have won ed many Indian awards but in film industry OSCR is considered to be the highest award n ARR has proved his mettle.We r proud because he is an Indian.|`|22oKpyq9aa	Because this is not a film from India represented in OSCARs. This went in as an entry from a British Director. <br>  <br>  Mostly the movies from India will be nominated in the category other country films.<br>  <br>  Of course this is not A.R.R 's best but the thing is it got nominated thats the point. You got to have influence and representation to OSCAR juries no matter how good is your movie music or whatever.|`|24dQzG9Yaa	yes there a lot to say about it<br>  its the awards that are to be presented for hollywood movies.<br>  he many times do that at indian movies which come to foreign category where many of the films whill have competion.|`|VD9PiqDJaa	ur righy,but sometimes ur stars work rather than ur work,and  now rahmans stars are atpeak,and to add HE IS REALLY THE BEST MUSIC DIRECTOR IN INDIAN CINEMA STREAM|`|BFL2GFF4aa	<a href="http://readyin.surfs.it" rel="nofollow">http://readyin.surfs.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|cWuumdy7aa	other films which had better songs were all hindi and they either did not go to oscar or were categorised in foreign film category lagaan also was composed by rehman|`|pTx9Hsavaa	well talent is great but you need oodles of luck too.you are right rahman has given better music.you can consider this god's gift since his body of work is so great.<br>  <br>  you should feel proud that an indian won oscar.<br>  <br>  remember anu malik's song too has been used in oscar winner moulin rouge.<br>  <br>  its not Oscar academy's job to award all great talents existing in this world..academy of mtion picture and arts  consists of members who vote to elect best  in different categories.its sheer luck many times that decides the winner.that's why even getting nominated is great.its a award given by artists to a artist.such type of award hardly exist here.

1iqeWBisaa	There are some old songs with strong lyrics and a very meaningful resonance, and then there were the Village People, so you can't lump it all together.<br>  <br>  I will say there was probably more to write about in the late 60's and 70's with Vietnam, civil rights, environmental activism, social change.  If you wanted to write a song with deep meaning, it was easy to find a topic.  Today, all people have to talk about is divisive politics and counter culture.<br>  <br>  Now I  will go buy an IPOD and program the Pussycat Dolls because their songs have no meaning whatsoever!<br>  <br>  np:  Living in the City - Stevie Wonder ( very meaningful)|`|2Hl4AAP7aa	it seems that way  but i think that songs that have any meaning do not get played or become hits because kids think the new stuff with no meaning is what it's all about. there are more older songs with meaning than now. mike plumes song steel belted radio is about radio stations that only play   songs that make money. the video is on youtube|`|73760ec70f62b217eab4a5ab28ce822baa	No, there are still  meaningful songs being written now. The problem is that the radio stations play less meaningful songs than they did about 30-40 years ago. The second half of the 60's and the '70's was the best era for great music in my opinion. I'm so jealous of my dad and the rest of the baby boomers who got to grow up listening to all that amazing music- Fleetwood Mac, Simon & Garfunkel, The Beatles, James Taylor, Bob Dylan, The Stones, etc. Great stuff.  Now, the radio stations just play whatever they think will sell to the teenyboppers.|`|m3XxhORkaa	It depends on the song you've been listening to. Some old songs aren't really that great either, just as this generation also has. The first problem that I see is that people had become bored of the tones used in the older times. They, or rather this century of children, had already been tired of such type of tones so they just kind of want to have... lets say a change of pace, just like in the process of evolution. The problem is, if composers want that kind of music, then that's what music he/she will produce. That would be why I suggest the best thing to do is be the one making the music. Making music is actually a lot of fun! You can personalize it the way you want it to be then. Who knows, you song might top the charts!|`|pLPKo6mBaa	No, I'd have to respectfully disagree. I would also probably add that I think you may need to keep ranging. As long as you stay away from the silly radio stuff, which can be fun to dance to but not to think about, it should become easier to find meaningful songs.<br>  <br>  I'd also have to disagree that there's nothing to write about nowadays that would mean anything ... I could personally think of dozens of topics if I had to, and I'm not that great at brainstorming. :) The world is full of problems out there - not always the same ones as back in the 60s, true. But they're certainly out there. If there's nothing to write about, then why do we have so many problems?|`|VAxFUGsfaa	I would have to agree : )|`|iXFjAPiQaa	iyee, but it depends what lyrics your hoping to interact with.<br>  e/g love lyrics were a lot more commonly expressed years ago,<br>  whereas it may seem nowadays its all about sex. <br>  <br>  but you do get the odd song here and there with real lyrics: like lyrics you can relate to in many ways; living conditions, love, hatred etc etc etc.

irSBrZiQaa	Yes, unfortunately John Discroll is gone for good. I have read on a few soap sites that John may be going to All My Children, but as of now that is just a rumor. I was so sad to see him go, he was a very talented Actor. I have read that Guiding Light is cleaning house and getting rid of all of the younger Actors/Actresses. I have heard that Ashlee, Daisy, Grady, and Rafe will be leaving, however I read just the other day that Ashlee and Daisy will be staying, but Rafe and Gardy will be out in the next few months. I have also heard that they are planning on bringing back Michelle Santos, Ava, Marah Shayne and possibly Danny Santos. Hopefully they bring back Danny and Michele I think that would also be a step in the right direction. Guiding Light needs to go back to their core characters/families in order to make the show untouchable again. I also read that Beth(Harley Cooper) is considering coming back to the show, that would be the icing on the cake for me.  <br>  <br>  I guess that they have to get rid of people in order to bring back some of the major players, sad but true, With the way the economy is they really can't afford to keep everyone. Coop will be missed!|`|AFG4dQGGaa	Yes Coop is off of guiding light for good. Which is sad cause he had a really good storyline going with his love affair with beth. It was so sad how they had him get into that horrible accident on his way to stop beth from marrying Alan again.<br>  <br>  <br>  I am not aware of what John Driscoll, who plays Coop, plans on doing now as he has done a variety of different things in the past before this show.<br>  <br>  I heard they are also looking to get rid of grady, Ashley, and Daisy, which none of them currently have any good storyline except possible ashley having a crush on grady even though he is with daisy.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Yes, sadly.  I will miss him.  I had read a post by someone on Y!A that the actor may go to All My Children.

a1Ngi39Xaa	My bf watches a lot of it as well.  It bugs me sometimes, more than it used to I suppose.  I don't totally understand it either.  I know that men are more visual than women, as a rule, and lots of them like to watch it.  Personally I don't think it has anything to do with him joining  classmates.com.  A lot of my friends are now on facebook, looking up old friends from school and college.<br>  <br>  By the way, from my experiences with men, it does not mean that they are not getting what they want from you.  We tend to take it more personally, but what I've been told by my male friends and bf is that they like to watch it to get more in the mood for the person they are with.  We would rather take a bubble bath and put on new lingerie...  I like to read something erotic sometimes but I have a good imagination and don't really need to see everything on a TV screen or computer monitor.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	I don't know what kind of porn he watches, but do you?  Is it girl/girl, solo girl, guy/girl, guy/guy?   Maybe he's trying to send you a message.  Have you tried wearing a sexy little nothing and parading around for him?|`|7z6BWoESaa	I dont know why all the porn but I would be having at fit for real. I mean if he wantd you guys to once in a while watch a movie, but all the time with or with out you? and on the internet too? There is just something wrong with that as far as I am concerned I caught my husband one time with a movie and maybe twice on the internet and I made him seek counseling because I just think it is wrong, and I too thought something was wrong with me but the Doc said no it is just in a mans nature to want to look at naked bodies but I feel your pain but it is his problem|`|xGmhDTWwaa	He sounds a little addicted or something. Maybe your relationship is lacking?! Alternatively he's just really freaky/ k*nky like wanting to carry out what he's been watching?! <br>  <br>  I'd speak to him abuot it, you have every right to be concerned and feel wierd about it. <br>  <br>  The only way you'll get any real answers is by talking to HIM. Speak to him, if he's overly defensive then I'd be a little suspicious and I know it's wrong but maybe you could have a quick check up on him (phone, email etc), it'll either give you peace of mind or show you what he's really upto!<br>  <br>  Good Luck and I hope everything works out for the best for you :o) xxx|`|a2DW1Bqgaa	Hmmm. Have you expressed your dislike for the porn to him? Have you asked why he is contacting old female friends? If no, then dont jump to conclusions. Guys are weird and who knows why they do most of the things they like. They feel the same about us.

I generally enjoy the movie if I see it alone. I can get more emotionally connected.|`|bLnvyyP8aa	it depends on what kind of movies you like, benjamin button is a drama film that traces the life of a person who's born old and through reverse aging, becomes younger, <br>  brad pitt has done a good job in the film and the make-up and visual effects are wonderful, but all in all, the film lacks any pace and is hardly exciting as it has no other plot device other than the (rather absurd) reverse aging, <br>  i found it boring, not worth a trip to the movies|`|AA11601079	Oh, please. Lots of people go to the movies alone all of the time. I've been doing it since high school. If you want to see it in the theaters, by all means, go by yourself. The other people in the theater are thinking about the movie, not wondering why you're there by yourself.|`|klSZoy87aa	Alone?<br>  <br>  NO.<br>  <br>  You'll be bored to death within the third hour.|`|24dQzG9Yaa	u can its not a scary movie..<br>  u can go it wont be boring.u can enjoy it.

AA12390047	It seemed ok to my husband.  I per=soanlly didn't see it.
uXKu52VTaa	Hmmm,<br>  <br>  -T.O.P use to be "rough around the edges" when he was younger(fat) there are pictures posted online and I was pretty shocked D= how did he become so skinny now?! xD <br>  -Also, T.O.P has an older sister named Choi Hye Joon, they look similar in a way lol! <br>  -Oh yea, T.O.P was hospitalized on his birthday because he took cough medicine and alcohol without realizing how fatal it was. People were spreading rumors that he tried to commit suicide: absolutely not true! He was just sick and him and the other band members went out to celebrate his birthday and he had a pretty decent sum of alcohol and fainted! Poor T.O.P. <br>  -Ah, what else: He doesn't like to be touched and his fans know it so they try to resist and keep their distance haha. <br>  -T.O.P use to date a girl 10 years older than him and once he confessed his age to her, she didn't mind and still stayed with him. They're relationship ended, but the pictures of him and his ex-girlfriend spreaded online and many fangirls were pretty upset so they left negative comments that hurted T.O.P's feelings and his ex probably saw it too! It was sad when he told his audience this.<br>  <br>  I don't know much about T.O.P but I know more about G-dragon haha I'll try to write down as much as I can!<br>  <br>  -G-dragon started out in YG entertainment when he was a little boy, but noone barely notice him since he just made little appearences on shows with another member (TaeYang).<br>  -Mostly everyone knows this but, G-dragon was known as the member with "unique" fashion sense. He attended a music festival wearing a furry hat and a tacky "inappropriate" shirt with words such as "69" "I heart sex" and "F*** you too!" ... But who cares, we all still love G-dragon no matter what he wears, right? =D<br>  -G dragon is the main leader and song-writer of Big Bang.<br>  -G-dragon has the most fans compared to the rest of the members due to his cute looks, and his cute expressions!<br>  -The youngest member SeungRi is starting to follow G-dragon's fashion sense since he stated that "Hyung goes to all the good stores." Haha! SeungRi was caught digging in G-dragon's closet and "borrowing" one of his shirts!<br>  -Right now, G-dragon stated that he is somewhere in the United States right now because he is making a solo album with 7-8 songs. Why is he in america? He also said that it's because all the people he works with in music is in america right now and he is taking this chance to fly there with the rest of the members and debut and album.<br>  <br>  Ehh, can't really think of anything else haha! I'll try updating this if I anything else important pops up! =D they are cute aren't they ;]|`|48l0AX9Yaa	i only know g-dragon and seungri..<br>  and not the rest..<br>  thy are very good korean hip hop group.<br>  but thy are not really my favourite all time.<br>  im more to super junior. maybe u can check them on wikipedia.<br>  just google it. :)

0d8vPBMwaa	She's the girl that runs the desk for the Volturi in Italy. She's human and when Bella and Edward are getting ready to leave, Bella asks about her and whether or not she really knows what's going on in the place. Edward tells Bella that she does know but she's risking possibly being dinner someday in the hope that maybe they will turn her into a vampire at some point.|`|JWZrKdQzaa	Heidi is a volturri member. She is the vampire that Bella realizes is the bait an the fisherman, she baits humans for the volturri than the volturri eat them. Bella says she looks like Rosalie in the fact that she is blindingly gorgeous. she has long legs and chestnut brown hair.|`|reHRXlZCaa	She appears very briefly, she's a human who works for the Volturi luring other humans into their lair
2abfad154b1ab0f34ede4ce75b2a0167aa	NEVER EVER bid right away.  Why would you want to get in a bidding war with 3 days left?  Who cares if you are winning with even 1 day left?  By bidding at the last minute or second your chances will be good that you will win.  You just have to set your price at let it ride because if it's late in the auction you only get one shot at it.  Remember, ebay does proxy bidding, read up on that on the ebay site.  Long story short, just because you bid $100 does'nt mean that you'll have to pay that.  That's your "limit".  Oh, one more tip.  ALWAYS ALWAYS use cents, ie $2.23, $109.85, $58.73.  NEVER $60 even.  I've won soooo many auctions by .01 and I'm sure it really pissed off some people but hey, that's the name of the game right?  Nothing personal.  <br>  Good luck.|`|gqmtPx8gaa	Just submit the highest bid you are willing to pay for the tickets. Ebay will automatically bid for you up to your highest amount. <br>  <br>  If the bids exceed your highest amount, well then you need to either rebid higher (which means paying more than you wanted to) or look for another auction.|`|W1lEnU0Taa	Best way to bid is to wait for the bidding to be almost over. I'd say about a minute before, like you suggested. This way you can keep on top of the new bids and you won't end up paying too much. You can keep clicking on refresh after your bid until the auction time is over. The last few seconds are crucial! Be careful not to leave it too long because the ebay page might take a few seconds to process your bid and especially at the last minute.<br>  If you have several listings for the same tickets then click on the 'watch this item' button on each auction page and you will be able to keep track of these items more easily. These will then be shown in My Ebay near the top right hand corner of the page. Only bid on the listings ending the soonest. You can always keep an eye on all the listings and find the lowest bidding price that you are happy with.<br>  Tickets on Ebay are well worth it so good luck with it.|`|AA11004345	Don't buy tickets from ticket brokers.  If you can not buy them at the event you really don't need to go.  I you buy on line you will pay thru the nose

Look closely and I have already giving you the third word.<br>  <br>  there ARE 3 wordz in "1-the 2-english 3-language".<br>  <br>  everyone knows and uses language evryday. look closely and i have already given u the third word: language is the third word in 'the English language".|`|ZatADRPXaa	The other trick answer that you can use for this riddle is energy.<br>  <br>  You have to list the letters g-r-y, though, instead of putting them in quotes to make it a solid order.|`|PhEl5Lyiaa	EVERY <br>  Maybe...x|`|v0sdoQy5aa	language........|`|wUSv64tuaa	The answer is language.<br>  It is the third word of "the English language".

jLvlcoFBaa	You are marketed everywhere you go. There is no escape. No one says you have to watch them. Look away or close your eyes or eat something.<br>  <br>  We all? I do not watch them. I mute the sound and read other news or ads on the page while the commercial is playing. Most of the time I don't even know what they are advertising. I choose not to watch just like you can.<br>  <br>  You just don't get it. Why would the advertisers pay good money for an ad and then allow a "skip ad" option? Everyone would skip the ad. That goes without saying.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	I watch very few of those things, because of the damn ads!  Whatever interest I have in seeing a 'trailer' (fancy word for commercial) for a movie (little) is quickly surpassed by my loathing for the f*&^ing adverts that they show!|`|0wTOMifKaa	So you understand it's paid for by advertisments but they should only be of interest to you?<br>  <br>  Not anyone else of course, just you and if not then you should be able to skip and completely ingore the adverts that are paying for the service.<br>  <br>  What exactly do the advertisers gain from that?|`|ie5hk2hKaa	I agree with you, especially the copyright page - again I understand why they do it the advertisers of the other film pay a certain amount to show there advert on other dvd's so if we were all skipping them they would be paying their money for nothing!

a950da063e9c670dfa13b1fd89d288ddaa	I doubt it but u can try. The show Jericho never seemed to gain enough viewers but I believe the decision makers who cut the show out in the first placed put it on at a time on purpose to have it get canceled again.
XuEMf100aa	I think  your DVD's will be safe for some time to come based on the fact that Blu ray doesn't actually provide a significant difference in picture and overall quality.  Sure it is better, but not as significant as a DVD compared to a VHS.  I think you will be good to go until another video player device is released like a 3-D hologram movie player, now that would be cool.|`|bn8OZrYSaa	no your dvds are fine. I dont think dvds are going out of style anytime soon...but u can convert your taped to dvds or just keep them as tapes....make them collectables...mayb b worth money someday to have tapes and not dvds.<br>  <br>  wish i woulda kept all my disney tapes..now i have them all on dvd but the tapes are worht money..mayb cause its disney, but still...lol|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	It actually looks more like Blu-Ray will be the one to go away. Sales have been disappointing at best for both players and movies. It seems that the marginal difference in quality between Blu-Ray and DVD hasn't inspired many people to buy them. And the manufacturers aren't doing what the music companies did when they decided to stop making LP's in favor of CD's. As long as people can buy DVD's instead of Blu-Rays, they will continue to do so. And if sales don't pick up soon, Blu-Ray will be a thing of the past.|`|XAAF7R23aa	you can still buy the dual players, dvd and vcr fairly cheaply we got one from netto for 50 pounds, i have a lot of vhs tapes, and would be gutted if i could not play my queen ones, so we bought the new one to keep for when the old one breaks down. its difficult to say about dvds,  videos lasted for a long time. Apart from the blue ray they have not brought anything else out apart from loading it onto a hard drive. I suppose it depends on how many of us they talk into exchanging a large disc for a smaller one.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	The motion picture industry, along with SONY and Panasonic, actually conspire against the movie lover by switching formats every few years to make your collection obsolete.  Once everyone buys Blu-Ray, then they'll switch again.  Stop buying movies!  Or, if you have to buy them, then give them to your local library.  VHS isn't obsolete there!|`|qJ9o3iQnaa	I think your collection is safe since most BluRay players are backwards compatible. Blockbuster is currently in the process of building up their BluRay collection because ultimately that will be all they rent over dvd's, but this will take a while.  Either way if you get a BluRay player that can play dvd's then you're golden|`|ytNlz3b7aa	No. Everything will be stored in a large on-demand repository. There won't be a need for players or physical media any longer.

Tn4uATeKaa	I don't really know because it seems like all the models that supposedly win, they take a couple of pictures for seventeen magazine and then you never hear about them again, or see them in any other ads. So because of this I can't remember any of their names it I wish Fatima would of won from cycle 10.    -Haleyy|`|Y9xxdFI6aa	i like a couple whitney because she was the firs plus sized model but i dont think she would be really nice in real life     then i liked the winner from season 3 she is really beautiful but i feel bad that i dont remember he name :(|`|rabjcdjHaa	Cycle 2 winner, Yoanna House is from favorite model from the show!|`|81ecb211a4e8b2e6fe257499b3d645b3aa	My Favorite is Eva|`|ZA6O9qfBaa	Danielle!|`|493lDnceaa	I absolutely love Whitney because being a bit larger girl myself who wants to model, it was great to see a normal (yes, normal sized, she's not really that large) win the show. I hope she will inspire other young models too.|`|fe5be031d9c57e4799c55e4f222ca2ecaa	I liked Jaslene because she didn't give up and came back again and again and then won it all.  She's a great role model to show young girls or anyone not to give up on their dreams, plus she's got that cha-cha thing going on!

It really relates to today's society and many people hold different view points. I agree there are some disturbing scenes in this which may be controversial, but the fact that many people believe the internet to have grown due to pornography and the perception that men have grown to need to see these growingly obscene images to help themselves masturbate could definitely stimulate a good paper.  There is also the issue, besides the pornography, of relying on the internet, such as for asking advice on what to write a paper about for example! lol Imagine what would really happen if nobody had internet?! Scary though! ;) good luck with whatever you choose to write about.|`|EU8XqTxYaa	id say the scientology one it did actually have some intellect and thought put into it

1263731b76a5881b98bbd0aacec9a2cdaa	The song is called "By the Sea" and is sung by Helena Bonham Carter (as Mrs. Lovett). Here are the lyrics below:    MRS. LOVETT:  (she kisses Todd)  Ooh, Mr. Todd! (kiss)  I'm so happy! (kiss)  I could (kiss)  Eat you up, I really could!  You know what I'd like to do, Mr. Todd? (kiss)  What I dream (kiss)  If the business stays as good?  Where I'd really like to go,  In a year or so?  Don't you want to know?    TODD: (spoken) Yes, yes, of course.    LOVETT: Do you really want to know?    TODD: (spoken) Yes, I do, I do.    LOVETT: (spoken) I've always had this dream...   Ever since I was a skinny little slip of a thing and my rich Aunt  Nettie used to take me down to the seaside August Bank Holiday...   The pier... Makin' little castles in the sand...  Ooh, I can still feel me toes wigglin' around in the briney!     By the sea, Mr. Todd, that's the life I covet,  By the sea, Mr. Todd, ooh, I know you'd love it!  You and me, Mr. T, we could be alone  In a house wot we'd almost own,  Down by the sea!  Wouldn't that be smashing?    TODD: Anything you say...    LOVETT:  With the sea at our gate, we'll have kippered herring  Wot have swum to us straight from the Straits of Bering!  Ev'ry night, in the kip, when we're through our kippers,  I'll be there slippin' off your slippers!  By the sea,  With the fishies splashing!  By the sea!  Wouldn't that be smashing?    TODD: Anything you say, anything you say...    LOVETT:  I can hear us wakin,'  The breakers breakin,'  The seagulls squawkin,'  'Hoo, hoo!'  I do me bakin,'  Then I go walkin'  With you-hoo!  Yoo-hoo!  I'll warm me bones on the esplanade,  Have tea and scones with me gay young blade,  Then I'll knit a sweater  While you write a letter  Unless we've got better to do-hoo!    TODD: Anything you say...    LOVETT:  Think how snug it'll be underneath our flannel  When it's just you and me and the English Channel!  In our cozy retreat kept all neat and tidy,  We'll have chums over ev'ry Friday!  By the sea!  Don'tcha love the weather?  By the sea!  We'll grow old together!  By the seaside,  Hoo, hoo!  By the beautiful sea!    (spoken)   Oh, I can see us now, in our bathing dresses!   You in a nice, rich navy, and me... stripes, perhaps.    It'll be so quiet,  That who'll come by it,  Except a seagull  Hoo, hoo!  We shouldn't try it,  Though, 'til it's legal for two-hoo!  But a seaside wedding could be devised,  Me rumpled bedding legitimized!  Me eyelids'll flutter,  I'll turn into butter,  The moment I mutter I do-hoo!    By the sea, in our nest, we could share our kippers  With the odd payin' guest from the weekend trippers,  Have a nice sunny suite for the guest to rest in,  Now and then, you could do the guest in!  By the sea,  Married nice and proper!  By the sea,  Bring along your chopper!  To the seaside,  Hoo, hoo!  By the beautiful sea!|`|JlEucUVtaa	You are the kind of person I dislike to a great degree.|`|biheycXqaa	It's called "By The Sea" from The Sweeney Todd Soundtrack.

Myspace has better features and it doesn't have all those annyoing applications that Facebook does.  I like the layout of facebook better, it's easier to find friends and see notifications. I found that myspace has a lot of creepy people but it's cool how you can add bands n stuff.  I prefer facebook because it's easier to contact people, to find them, and to have conversations on. The myspace profile message board is just very confusing to me and time times are always wrong>:  Anyways if the people I have on facebook had myspace (instead of facebook) I'd use myspace.

MySpace offers more things to do such as: Videos, Music, Groups, Bulletins, Applications, Quizzes, Commening, Photo Albums, Easy to use set up and navigation, and so on.  It's more popular, consequently, you have to watch out for those with fake profiles posing as younger or older.  This is on both FaceBook and MySpace though.  MySpace is just offers to do and keeps you busy when you're bored.|`|PQu6OMulaa	MySpace.|`|V4AwoAEzaa	Facebook!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|FCcqziAmaa	both|`|CJmA4GDoaa	Facebook... i think its more decent than myspace.|`|fxxxMbXqaa	facebook please. they both have their perks but i still like it more.|`|aFSHU6Yhaa	absolutely facebook.|`|ubZpZ8HUaa	myspace|`|fNvZmU2kaa	myspace.  you get more personalizing options|`|ht3LfDUCaa	facebooookkk.  :)    myspace is cool too though.|`|WCsy7CQHaa	F A C E B O O K|`|gA8lD3zEaa	depends myspace has too much drama and facebook has a little less drama either way they suk but i have both lol|`|dvBXLnzJaa	Myspace 100%.

A3qpMlssaa	Omg!!! I live for singing and the way that i got my voice to be one of the best that people have heard was that i listened to my favorite artist all the time (christina aguilera) and i just kinda tried to develop the voice that she has. Of couse my voice doesn't sound like hers completely but i developed my voice into taking good sounds and simply working my voice over and over again to get that sound. Many people don't realize that in order to get the voice you want it really depends on you and no one else. I have been looking for fame everywhere and i got one of the best voices without a voice coach. I play the piano and you relly have to know how to play some sort of instrument in order to really work with sounds that you want. If you don't know how to play an instrument then surf the web and things like youtube to get the basics on how to play that instrument then you can go off on your own and work with that instrument. If you want to become famouse simply contact one of the top recording lable (hollywood records, rca records, sony bmg, and so on). That record company will hire a band for you. Another way is to send in a recording of yourself with atleast 3 songs max. you could record yourself singing along to instrumental or sing along to the peice you can play on the piano. you really need to do a lot of research and study what you need to do and what you are getting yourself into. read lots of books about the business. i am only 13 and trust me i did it all by myself. also in order to prepare yourself in front of a lot of people you need to say to yourself that if you were to become famous then this is what you are gonna do all the time. in order to make it in this hard business you have to know yourself, know others, practice til you are perfect in every way(WORK YOUR VOICE!!),research and get to know everything about it, and believe in yourself. If you don't think your voice is perfect in every way than no one else will. spend hours every day practicing and practicing to get notes you can't reach and sounds you can't get. with practice, you will get better and better by the second. it takes time so if you haven't started, start as soon as you get off from reading this. use everything you possibly can to help you. if you don't know anyone, well then get to know everyone that you can because aside from the talent half the battle in the business is who you know. get to know everyone you can. you never know who you might meet that can help you. this is something that you have to learn how to do yourself. no one else is gonna do it for you.|`|Gv606uKbaa	what helps for to make my voice louder is to practice  like a squeaking door if that makes any sense, just make a creaking sound and turn it into a note, then slowly get louder and louder on that note until you can't get any louder. Sorry its kind of hard to explain without showing you lol|`|AQFwSLgiaa	It takes time but it all comes from your stomach not your throat. You won't be able to make a living if you just sang from your throat.    Do octave levels.  Hold notes as long as you can and go up the scale each time  do your doe ra me's  ABC's   Breathe in and out  Breathe in and then hiss while letting the air out slowly and count up to 15 secs and each time try to get to a higher number    The reason why it is soft is because your singing from your throat. Don't worry I had that too but now I'm singing from my stomach. Keep practicing your levels and they will help improve and make your voice powerful. Ther person above has given you another great example for warm ups.    I taught myself to sing opera but I'm taking voice lessons to help strengthen my voice more. In a few months I will be recording demos and I probably will let people hear them. I think the music industry is easy for me to get into and it's not even a challenge for me. LOL. I want it to be but oh well. I will be doing symphonic metal which is amzaing music. You should check into it.    And another thing, try to make your voice stand out when singing from your fav artist cuz no one likes having the same kind of artists. Be different and original. I have always learned that and you will get more diversity and will be more recongnized than others tyring to have the same voice/ voice styles as other artists.

I love that show so you know I get asked this all the time.|`|vqg6wpCLaa	They have cool headbands.|`|bRjq7xZ5aa	Why do people have a problem with other people liking anime that they don't like?|`|rygoLKr2aa	It was a fresh new manga/anime about ninjas.     Besides Naruto was only supposed to be 15 episodes (continued because it was popular)|`|9SWklMBBaa	It's about ninjas, and people are drawn to ninjas. It's one of our fatal flaws. And the show is good, without all the fillers. The characters are life-like (in that they have emotions and feelings that fit the situation and are not 1 demensional when it comes to beliefs). Plus, a lot of the jutsus are really cool.|`|fawhiGtsaa	Because in this series, they have ninjas.|`|26d1999f7254b426bf8ef97812af006daa	ACTION|`|QzmGdUVSaa	it has a perfect blend of action adventure sci-fi(in a way) and a subtle love story that isnt cheesy or girly
ZrjGrFwzaa	Yes, I was walking down an alley, and then suddenly my pants were ripped off, my underwear was pulled down around my ankles, and I heard a loud sucking sound - but no one was visible, but man it felt great!|`|N2XKAzZQaa	i did a Ouija board with my friends once, it was so scary<br>  & it was real even though everyone tries to tell me it was all in our imaginations.<br>  we definitely contacted someone<br>  <br>  :)|`|yq72XIhdaa	It's all in your imaginations.|`|CYhOr4s7aa	which one is the ghost|`|fd2a3Ll4aa	I've never seen any ghosts that I'm aware of.|`|yhwDukdcaa	Never saw one :)|`|4YnoykD2aa	I've seen many ghosts and spirits. Too many to go on about here. Email me if you want, and I'll answer any qs you have. :)|`|cdpy5iv5aa	I never seen one, but I think I feel their presence sometimes.|`|jYFSaanOaa	i haven't seen one but when i go to bed i feel like ones watching me...|`|sixm6Vlraa	No but i have felt the presence of a few before. One i even knew who it was (my pepere)|`|Y0w2Pk5kaa	Never seen one??
qOKFuXfLaa	because he injects female hormones to prevent facial hair growth           HAHAHAHHAHA|`|BLrNJgbnaa	He's a woman, and lacks the necessary testosterone to grow one.|`|GilxwZ2Haa	http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=s9ZrukowXU...    He can, and he said that in his Burnin' Up music video, he was joking.|`|u2ZKtLY0aa	He hates them? I don't know. don't really care about jonas brothers.|`|i5HaqMgjaa	you mean in the burnin up video right?    that was a joke he can|`|aBtUtnKtaa	Maybe he doesn't want one.|`|vGtM2F5Caa	he can :)   but he doesnt want one  they're nasty|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	BECAUSE HE'S A GIRL!|`|6wwl3Tm4aa	BECAUSE HE'S GAY    HAHA ALL THE STUPID JB FAN GIRLS ARE GOING TO GIVE THIS THUMBS DOWN!! I DON'T CARE!!! THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO ACCEPT THAT THEIR "BOYFRIEND" DOESN'T LIKE GIRLS!!!!    IT'S SOOOOOO OBVIOUS!|`|Ym7EmXWraa	>completely serious|`|dnlr8Afbaa	he can. in his burning up video he was kidding about not growing a mustache. it was a joke. he didnt really mean he couldnt :)    hope this answers your question! :D|`|933e4a28cf2ed1dee09acc2b64ac1674aa	he was joking   duhhh :]|`|V20PTwMmaa	because hes a girl|`|k39bNUgeaa	Every male is different when it comes to growing facial hair    Some like me that are 17 that can  some 30 year olds can't|`|5NBV7i5Gaa	Some guys can't. It might have something to do with his testosterone levels. Various hormones control secondary sex characteristics.|`|duN63EkIaa	He was being stupid.  He can grow a mustache. Hence the video someone posted above.  Also known as, "The Pedo Beard."
f4ehvRQlaa	I hope so!  ^_^|`|BLrNJgbnaa	Probably. They're jokes nowadays anywho.     I wonder if Miley will lift up her shirt and pose as if in a Myspace photo when she accepts her award.|`|5NBV7i5Gaa	I don't think she is nominated. But why not just nominate the whole Disney crew that way no one feels left out. Since grammy judges  apparently do not consider talent and actual musical ability when picking nominees, I think the Jonas Brothers, Hannah Montana, and Mickey Mouse should all win.|`|mYxvDgVxaa	I didn't even know she was nominated. It depends on who the other nominees are.  I don't think so, though.|`|u2ZKtLY0aa	I'd never watch the grammys anymore if she won. :O|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	if the people giving out the awards are a bunch of retarded 10-year-olds who have never heard music before|`|dnlr8Afbaa	i hoppe not!|`|xDXCZ1fgaa	i Hope not!  she doesn't deserve one|`|271COgtIaa	OF COURSE i have no idea if she is nominated but knowing miley she probably will:)

JgCGpQaxaa	Well, Bronze Age Superman is stronger than Gogeta SS4, and he isn't even the strongest in the comic book universe... so there is definitly something out there.    And if you are letting people combine together then Simon using the spiral energy of his other commrads was able to create the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, which is the largest mecha in all anime of all time.  This thing is a fricking massive 10 million light years in height (100 times the size of our galaxy).  And it was easily able to destroy hole galaxies in it's battle.  The thing is so absurd that Gogeta wouldn't even have a chance.|`|YxCfbVpAaa	It'd have to be.....a schizophrenic's mind, since it basically turns against them :O|`|ocu85X9xaa	dbgt is screwy man i'd say kid buu|`|IQTEBeDEaa	DGBT is filler, so I say Vegetto is the strongest (DBZ anime and manga).  As for the villain, I 'd say it's Kid Buu.|`|SX8z4fNtaa	silver surfer he cant  be killed he can manipulate cosmic energy    and galactus because he eats planets
mcknghEBaa	A Seattle family takes in an amnesiac teen (Dallas), whom they eventually learn has mysterious powers and psychic abilities, the result of a secret human cloning experiment conducted years earlier. The family helps teach Kyle human behaviors such as anger, joy and love, and guards him against forces who seek to use Kyle for their own nefarious purposes.    this was what the first season was about.|`|6aNFkVSkaa	Some guy sleeps in a tub and has special powers i forgot don`t get it here anymore.oh and he has a freind a gal with powers like him that stay with the same family a wife husband a boy and a girl teens.
O2hmjOPyaa	I really like this idea and I think the story will be really enjoyable.    For Zuko, possibly he could have reddish fur instead of black? Black paws or the tip of his tail, maybe...     For Aang, maybe he could be white instead of cream colored? Or gray with white markings (forehead arrow)?    Otherwise, I love your ideas, especially for Toph. I can already see her wolf-form. |`|jYNZwKLuaa	I like this idea...  I think that aang should maybe have a gray arrow on his head.  Toph maybe white paws  sokka and zuko are good  katara should maybe have light brown in with the dark brown    and ADD IROH!!!!! Big chubby gray wolf

YyWtVDjJaa	I don't see how any of those women call each other friends. I mean I don't see how Lynne wants to do another season with these women, besides the money. They were so rude towards her and then tried to turn it around on her. I thought she was the most non-materalistic of them all. Vicki just wants to try and justify everything she said, however there is no justification. I think that she doesn't like to have to face what she said in front of the one she was talking about. I think both her and Tamra are very insecure about themselves and making other feel bad busts their ego! <br>  <br>  As for Gretchen I feel so sorry for her Tamra had no right to come on national television, without Gretchen's knowledge and with all of Jeff's family watching, and say what she did. True or not! <br>  <br>  They have serious issues.|`|12Nou1pvaa	yea i  didn't like how Vicky was trying to act all innocent, when shes the biggest sh*t talker of OC, and I used to like Gretchen i thought she did love Jeff, but shes nothing but a gold digger, and a skank i hope Jeff's children blow her off|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I always thought Vicky was mean and all about herself. It would be interesting to see if another season happens.|`|c1PMv02saa	If this is how "friends" treat each other in OC, I'm glad I live in the midwest! My neighbors are respectful and caring women.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	I totally believe Tamra because what so called "close family friend" would call up his friend's enemy at 1am yelling about this??? Gretchen is so lying. A girl like her does not date 60 year old men for companionship.<br>  <br>  Gretchen is a nasty lady. <br>  <br>  I'm shocked at how good Vicki looked last night, she looked so much better than normal. <br>  <br>  I feel bad for Lynne, but she is an idiot. I cannot WAIT for season 5.|`|ACc1skbPaa	Tamra and Vicki are both Toxic and Jealous---I don't think Gretchen is dating an ex named Jay---I do think it is wierd that he called Tamra at 1am seemingly knowing that would stir the pot to say the least...and I find it laughable that Tamra and Simon wanted to get to the bottom of it so they called him back and talked for an hour and apparently believed anything and everything he said????  Suddenly they are McMIllian and Wife??  They suspect Gretchen would make up an relationship with Jeff but not that an ex-boyfriend may have an ax to grind and would call the one person who he probably knows would love to have some dirt no matter where it got dug up from....odd....Personally, I think Tamra and Vicki will believe anything anyone says that puts Gretchen in a bad light because they are very mean, jealous bitter women--and Vicki's insecurity and neediness make her less and less attractive everytime she open her mouth....Jeana is my favorite but I did feel bad for Lynne last night and Gretchen I like--if she is leaning on old friends to battle being lonely, than who are we to judge?  For me, the fact she didn't marry him in the hospital and stays in touch with his children goes a long way with me...|`|iJ9Ewxwtaa	i cant wait!  vickys footage speaks for itself..  tamra is awful.  i really wanted to like her.  gretchen is probably w/ someone else, but she needs to move on, and its not tamras place to say on national televison.  that was pretty trashy.  it was nice to see lynne "throw some stones" back at vicky.  although vicky deserved so much worse.|`|6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	I will  have to see proof to believe anything Tamra says. She is pretty vile. I have second thoughts about watching another season. I think Lynne is too lame and does not bring anything to the show. Besides, with her ultra tight and short dresses.

They could have come up with something a bit more believeable than this.|`|3jvrJTUraa	I can't stand Maria, this recent Sherlock Maria Holmes was totally out of character, normally she's a  self absorbed dimwit.  I can quite believe she would get it on with Tony, partly from a need to seek revenge for Carla sleeping with Liam, partly because she's just an idiot|`|DJLeObm4aa	I sincerely hope you are joking and that is not a a true spoiler. Surely despite some really awful storylines no writer would be dim enough to come up with that one.  If the whole saga gone previously would be totally worthless.|`|t2KJijUpaa	I heard that too... I think personally its stupid..

aZjZyccsaa	Sort of, but I would have expected him to at least make an effort to attempt to cook something!    I felt more sorry for him when those little feckers made pizza and said he couldn't get any, if they were my kids I'd have been REALLY angry at that!|`|fYcYPyR3aa	I know, she was forcing him to say and then trying to justify it by saying "oh he'll regret it later", but you could see he really just wanted to go. She just wanted him to stay there so her own face would be on TV longer.|`|EFZRSqFcaa	I did feel sorry for but couldn't help but think he may have been a bit of a spoilt brat.|`|pN3Q4IMOaa	Awww yeeh sid was sucha cutie lool :)   bless him he just wanted to go home and his mum was like no i brought you here so you could learn, i was like aww|`|AA10077992	He so wanted to go home, he was so unhappy - lurve 'im - and then his mum got him some food and took him back - unbelievable woman.|`|046668252b7d273d3a4a3a6908a8607daa	In a way, I could see the mum's point. She wanted him to just have a try. In the long run, it would have been worse if she babied him because his friends will be watching this too. If they see that he made some effort, they are less likely to tease him than if Mummy scooped him up and carried him home.|`|zZ3Uxllfaa	i agree with Ellie i think the programme was more about her than him , i got annoyed  with her and gave up watching  lol , but i probs will watch it next week when they have money to waste  should be fun  lmfao|`|FcHplZtQaa	Tbh Afro, his mum SHOULD have shown him how to bloody cook before he went in!    Cooking lesson for my 8yr old tommorow! lmao|`|aKhZNd7daa	I thought out of all the boys Sid would be the 'toughest' Afro having a Dad whose a Boxer lol  Once he said he wanted to go home that should of been it but no Mum kept on and on for him to stay - think she was the one who wanted the coverage really.  Still at least in the end she saw sense !!|`|nqlk9iUCaa	My blood was boiling, No joke!  And i'm 14 lol
SHeLdu8haa	Those parents already know what their children are like. They should not have allowed their bully children to do a show like this. They have no shame and no wonder the kids are like it.|`|QASqKvSNaa	I would be soo embarrassed but, I just wouldn't put my kids on the show at all. It's sick.    I felt uncomfortable watching it if I am honest.    The kids were starving hungry, getting hurt and bullied by other children and sobbing their little hearts out.    I just cannot understand why you would put your kids on a TV show like this- they are obviously doing it for the money! The show just highlights the bad parenting- swearing, bullying, violence, ect.    The older girls are sooo horrible, I mean, they should cook for the younger ones. To be fair at 8 years old you don't know how to cook, use the washing machine and run a house, do you???     Personally I just don't see any benefits of making at TV show like this. The parents should be soo ashamed to have put their kids through this. How can they just sit back and watch their kids sobbing their eyes out??? I couldn't do it.|`|aKhZNd7daa	My thoughts are exactly the same as Chri's H !!|`|fYcYPyR3aa	In the case of those two older, really bitchy girls, I would feel really ashamed and also upset that they had turned out a bully. I would have to sit them down when they got home and tell them they shouldn't behave like that and I'd probably take them out of the show if they continued to act like that because if they behave like that and stay in there getting away with it, they'll just end up thinking it's alright to act like that. I'd feel the same way about that little violent boy who hit the other boy with the water squirty thing then ran off swearing and crying.|`|QfYGhtVwaa	I just wouldn't put them up for it in the first place. Although I agree it is an interesting psychological experiment.    The parents of big bad missy attitude and her sidekick friend should be mortified and pull them aside for a few stern words including , bullying, nasty, bitchy, cruel to little ones.|`|AA10077992	Firstly, I wouldn't have put my children in a show like that but if they were and I saw how they were acting and it was NOT to my liking , I would have removed them and 'dealt' with them at home BEFORE the screening went out. I would not have wanted other people to talk about my children like we are talking about them now - I'd be so ashamed|`|jShfNvQXaa	I would be ashamed & embarrassed watching the programme! I laughed sooo much though, watching again on  ch4+1!! xx  *looks down* Afro got it in one, well said!
QASqKvSNaa	Bootcamp.|`|aKhZNd7daa	I'd remove Charlie and the black girl (can't remember her name) from the situation as at the moment they are the main to instigators of the trouble in the girls house - what a couple of cows - god knows what they will be like as older teenagers !!!!|`|OLSWVy5naa	i dont get it|`|QfYGhtVwaa	Remove the two nasty older girls and try with a couple of different 11 year olds who may treat younger children with some respect and not frighten them.|`|SHeLdu8haa	Well, If they were mine....I'd walk in and drag them home and ground them for a year for showing me up like that....lol  That little fat black one needs her backside tanned.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	i'd take them out, they shouldn't get away with behaving like that especially the black one and her side kick.|`|jShfNvQXaa	They should've picked nicer older girls so they kinda looked out for the younger ones, not bully them! The wee fatty shouldn't be allowed to stay, she is AWFUL! xx
EFZRSqFcaa	If I was the mother of either Charley or Tiesha they would have got a bloody good hiding!|`|AA10077992	I would have gone in and just grabbed the kids and taken them home where I would have disciplined them OFF camera - I would not have wanted to embarrass myself or them any further|`|SHeLdu8haa	The mums look like they are only interested in the fees the children will earn.  I can imagine that they can't control those girls at home anyway.|`|lx5DnQLKaa	Definitely!!    instead of talking sh** about breathing exercises and counting to ten she should have been way harsher and given that girl some   DISCIPLINE.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	I'd have told them to sort themselves out or they were going home straight away. The parents were a waste of space, they didn't seem to care about their kids acting that way, the black girls mum was just like "it's just girls being girls"|`|qBmhyFXtaa	"Girls being girls??" What was that woman even talking about? No girl I know acts like her daughter. Her daughter needs to be severally disciplined and show some respect for others!!    :D|`|aKhZNd7daa	Agree with Afro here Whip - At least Sis's Mum took him home though !!|`|YVmTJVMuaa	Its funny watching kids wrap their parents around their little fingers, wiping the tears away and smirking cos theyve got away with appalling behaviour! The mums trying to play down the disgusting attitudes just in case we might notice the little darling is less than perfect! Get real Mum.|`|e7d33bc92c90a4f6b9a0a294ed16e866aa	aghhhh I was soooo annoyed, if they were my daughters I would be telling them some serious home truths....girls can be so unkind and argue for the sake of it........can see myself at that age though!!  Has made me think that I need to get my own children doing more though.....but then again, they do need time to be children!  Seems to me that 8 is an ideal age...any older and the hormones start kicking in and everything suddenly seems a whole lot more complicated!
SesoOWvDaa	No - they should have taken them home and taught them how to cook,clean and so on there as they should have started doing years before.   These television shows are appalling - what an example to set!|`|QfYGhtVwaa	Yes I agree with you!, boys aged 8 plus should be able to do some housework - oh hang on a min, maybe they do know how too but just didn't think!. When they got hungry again maybe someone would have given in and attempted to wash up somehow.|`|AA10077992	The children shouldn't have gone into the house unless they could have proved that they could do basic tasks about the house - like the badges kiddies attain at Cubs/Scouts etc    It looked to me like the mums were glad to get rid of them|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	I found the whole programme rather painful to watch...I have  a 12 year old son who wants to go on something like this. I really don't think its teaching them independence at all....the weaker ones are suffering and the stronger ones are being real pains in the bum...  I would have taken my son home.  My son has just turned 12 and can clean and cook when the need arises.|`|SHeLdu8haa	They should have been showing them how to do things at home....They can't expect to throw the kids in at the deep end and expect them to swim the first time.|`|lx5DnQLKaa	i dont think kids under 13 should have been there at all.  maybe kids aged about 13 - 16     Children should be taught life skills at home by parents.    Chucking 8 year old girls in a house with older bullies was pure entertainment purposes , and it corrupts little kids, doesnt teach them anything|`|aKhZNd7daa	Same answer as Chris H - I found the whole programme really upsetting !!|`|b75nMKu8aa	wow this sounds so wrong but to answer the question the bottom part is more beneficial|`|YVmTJVMuaa	Just asked that myself, watching that wasnt easy, the poor lad that couldnt even use kettle, I know youve got to keep them safe, but why didnt she show him what to do? instead of forcing him into a situation he was clearly ill equipped to deal with, why is housework so neglected as something children can take part in and share with grown ups? I know it takes longer at first but just look what we have created by not involving them, its scary.|`|42dafba9ff7361d27a14115d9d33feedaa	Interesting how the mums did the work and the dads were being as silly as the boys.
Gz1bN9Zxaa	Tis song, Thunder by Boys Like Girls is really meaningful!  Today is a winding road  Thats taking me to places that I didnt want to go, whoa  Today in the blink of an eye  Im holding on to something and I do not know why I tried    I tried to read between the lines  I tried to look in your eyes  I want a simple explanation; what Im feeling inside  I gotta find a way out  Maybe theres a way out    Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer  Do you know youre unlike any other?  Youll always be my thunder, and I said  Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors  I dont wanna ever love another  Youll always be my thunder  So bring on the rain  And bring on the thunder    Today is a winding road  Tell me where to start and tell me something I dont know, whoa  Today Im on my own  I cant move a muscle and I cant pick up the phone, I dont know    And now I'm itching for the tall grass  And longing for the breeze  I need to step outside, just to see if I can breathe  I gotta find a way out  Maybe theres a way out    Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer  Do you know youre unlike any other?  Youll always be my thunder, and I said  Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors  I dont wanna ever love another  Youll always be my thunder  So bring on the rain  And bring on the thunder    Yeah Im walking on a tightrope  I'm wrapped up in vines  I think Ill make it out but you just gotta give me time  Strike me down with lightning  Let me feel you in my veins  I wanna let you know how much I feel your pain    Today is a winding road  Thats taking me to places that I didnt want to go, whoa    Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer  Do you know youre unlike any other?  Youll always be my thunder, and I said  Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors  I dont wanna ever love another  Youll always be my thunder  So bring on the rain  And bring on the thunder    Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer  Do you know youre unlike any other?  Youll always be my thunder  So bring on the rain  Oh baby bring on the pain  And listen to the thunder    That's an interesting project by the way!|`|X6rFPI2laa	How about this, which really IS a poem by Gillet Burgess:           I've never seen a purple cow.

They just assume that life is simple that one can simply do whats quote normal. Well Screw You. You dont know me, you dont know my life, you dont know crap.  Of course everything is going to be easy to you, youve got no feelings involved, nothing to lose, your heart isnt on the table with the mallet raised high.  I love her and never for a moment will I contemplate turning my back on her. Turn away and walk off the ledge to the jagged rocks beneath the familiar faces just because they expect it. No I will choose my path and though rocky the climb it will be my course, and my way is set. Never will I have to look back and guess at what would have been. I do what I have to do that in my mind I can look at myself in the mirror and not think what a monster have I become.

O2hmjOPyaa	While I'm not certain this is entirely true, the rumors that are circulating regarding Beth, Jodi and Kevin's television appearances are centered around the fact that Kate no longer wants them to be on the show.     The reasons differ (she doesn't want them to make money off her children since the production crew offered to pay them for their appearances, she dislikes the influence the relations have over her children and wants them to spend less time together, etc.) but it seems that, if in fact, their disappearance from the show becomes a permanent thing, then the media audience is likely going to blame Kate for their absence.     There was a website (http://truthbreedshatred.blogspot.com/) put up some time ago by a woman who is Judi's real-life sister that explains the reason (putting the blame entirely on Kate) why she no longer appears on the show, though, as far as I know, it does not say if she will ever be back.|`|QDetaXewaa	well technically, the shows not about them, they are neither jon, nor kate, nor any of the eight, so they dont really have to be in the show.  maybe jon and kate  just see them when the cameras arent around,  ever think of that? theres also lots of rumors gonig around about stuff that i dont wanna explain :P|`|fIK9LBEuaa	There has been a ton of controversy over this, and basically; Jodi has confirmed that the show offered her (Jodi) money for appearing on the show, and Kate got mad because the show was supposed to be all theirs.     This has been confirmed as Jodi's sisters blog (by a video of Jodi saying so herself) if you want to take a look:  http://truthbreedshatred.blogspot.com/|`|uawYSzqWaa	i personally just think that jon and kate have been very busy. and how do you know that they dont see beth, aunt jodi and uncle kevin on the days when the cameras arent around? it could just be a coincidence that they havent been on the show for a while

AA10289523	The Death of Superman is a comic book storyline (culminating in Superman (vol. 2)  75 in 1992) that served as the catalyst for DC Comics' crossover event of 1993. The completed multi-issue story arc was given the title The Death and Return of Superman. The Death of Superman was reported to be the "best selling graphic novel of all time" in a commercial for the animated version of "The Death of Superman" titled Superman: Doomsday although the validity of the claim has been questioned.[1]    The storyline's premise is as simple as its title: Superman engages in battle with a seemingly unstoppable killing machine named Doomsday in the streets of Metropolis.[2] At the fight's conclusion, both combatants die from their wounds.    The crossover depicted the world's reaction to Superman's death in "Funeral for a Friend," the emergence of four individuals claiming to be the "new" Superman, and the eventual return of the original Superman in "Reign of the Supermen!"    The storyline, devised by editor Mike Carlin and the Superman writing team of Dan Jurgens, Roger Stern, Louise Simonson, Jerry Ordway, and Karl Kesel, met with enormous success: the Superman titles gained international exposure, reaching to the top of the comics sales charts and selling out overnight. The event was widely covered by national and international news media.|`|znEAsRAlaa	he goes to battle with the unstoppable killing machine name doomsday in the streets of Metropolis in the end they both died from there wounds   but if your wondering about the comics its the same way he died but there was a next comic called funeral for a friend then 4 other people claimed to be the new supermen and that's how it leaded into the comics called reign of superman.|`|mQHJIAdTaa	Doomsday and superman punched eachother at the same time and killed one another. BUT they both come back to life anyways and then superman and a whole bunch of kryptonians in the new krypton series beat doomsday to death.|`|1RFf8nQeaa	An alien known as Doomsday came to Earth, seemingly with the sole intention of fighting Superman. They had a tremendous battle, but despite all his power, Superman just could NOT beat Doomsday. Doomsday literally beat Superman to death with his bare hands.|`|ocu85X9xaa	superman died!!!!!!? man i better stop reading jump and watch these things...................oh wait you're asking me dunno man!|`|SX8z4fNtaa	doomsday kicked his punk ***** ***|`|LzPhdri5aa	Doomsday killed him.

WMem5AGoaa	Emotional is very destructive and painful, physical wounds can heal but emotional wounds are scarring and long lasting one reason Xanax/ Zoloft and such drugs are making a killing in sales.|`|tJeS4SZCaa	I have been hurt in both ways. altho the Emotional one hurt the most.|`|JbRTKDFmaa	Emotional injury. To make an incredibly long story short, my father's girlfriend asked him to make a decision between me and her and he chose her and threw me out as if I were an old shoe.

I keep trying too see if there was any kind of health signs that I didn't notice before it happened in May of 1996.|`|e76nQKKZaa	Emotional pain hurts worse for me, I have had more emotionally painful instances than physical.  But I have broken many bones, and had many piercings and a tattoo, and its never bothered me very much.|`|ztug2gLjaa	It depends sometimes they both hurt really bad.

My all-time favorite!!!|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	Well, I have lots of favorites, but the one I'm most obsessed with right now (in case you can't tell by my avatar) is The Dark Crystal, mostly because it has a sequel coming out in 2011 (finally, after 29 years!). It is one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie was truly ahead of its time, and it was a work of art, as well as containing themes of love, courage and sacrifice. Although the movie uses puppets, it is a "dark" movie, and not recommended for young children, because people/animals are actually killed and/or tortured. Probably a little too scary for young children, but older children and adults love it. It transports you to another world.|`|vZkDHhklaa	The Notebook!!!|`|kFnzYrrnaa	The Lord of the Rings, all three.|`|AA11841265	The Notebook!!!!|`|5k5P0iOaaa	me 2! makes me cry everytime lol ='(|`|DxdQ3F1iaa	meet the parents|`|HeAFlwFeaa	i have to many!|`|qp6Mus6yaa	prince Caspian!|`|A2Ij0oVBaa	my fave movie is return to witch mountain:)|`|yWxWfspLaa	Princess Mononoke, Twilight or The Dark Knight.

ygcj2zwyaa	knowing alot of scorpio guys i will tell you . . .  1. they like a girl who is independant and does her own thing  2. a girl that knows what she wants in life and what she can do to achieve them. she has to have ambitions and know how to make them blossom  3. a girl that can instinctively know him emotional need, he wont show it, you just have to know.  4. a girl that isn't nosy in his life and ask way too many personal questions, leave that to him when he is ready  5. scorpios love someone that is open with them, not anyone else, they also love abit of mystery to their lover  6.someone who is very sexual and doesn't mind having sex all the time-its just their way of expressing their feelings.  7. a girl that always sticks up for him and defends him  8. the partner must not be the dominant one in the relationship, the scorpio secretly wants to be this, he wont tell you, but he prefers to do the protecting. he will be the tarzan and you will be the jane.  9. he loves a very intelligent mind, intelligent conversations and an intelligent outlook on life, someone who talks about life, death, sex, religion, people the unknown world. . . anything, has their own theories and looks at things from different persepctives. someone who has the same interests as him.  10. someone who proves they are loyal, amd caring, they seek emotional intensity. i don't know about body but most prefer the sexual looking type, i don't think looks matter much.|`|tpY1A9M8aa	people who dont rely on horoscopes for help with their love life|`|Sxd0tXDwaa	horny|`|AQwoCjj3aa	people that are not afraid of them.

XMXuJSPWaa	That's a quality video. Muse - Knights of Cydonia
O2hmjOPyaa	I believe (and its a bit difficult to be certain without a reference picture to compare) that the actor you're searching for is named Matthew McConkey. (Seems a bit old to be a child actor, though...)    - http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2068346/|`|iMULlxdgaa	Give us a link with his pic!  Someone must know who he is!  He's a future kid actor that will overdose on drugs later on in life...harhar.
cUjcn2lsaa	Because they're way more talented and unique than American ones, lol.    Take Lily Allen, for example. Amy Winehouse. Kate Nash. Adele. Bat for Lashes. Even Duffy (I think she's annoying though).|`|L4f5ONEkaa	because its addiction and actually sounds amazzzzzing    foundations by kate nash makes me laugh    and they are all women because we do it better    and i like metalcore/deathecore/and everything else  and i still listen to british pop so dont feel alone|`|nYqtw9DWaa	Because american pop is all sh*tty disney stuff.  I enjoy british pop.|`|2KI7LxUXaa	couse you worship wemon thats all... lol jkjk    i like first answer... its frijjin cheesy, and because of that it makes it O.G to us americans... well... you know what i mean|`|GPhZgZC3aa	because its cheesy :D|`|F2ygsPEbaa	You are wrong, and you are wrong.  Now that you are "Oh for Two" you want to try something that is more substantial than throwing our your personal opinions as facts?  That really does make you look silly.  You might have a bright posting future in the government and politics section.  That is a common tactic over there.|`|gMHwrbRlaa	Carl F will someday learn he has bad taste and cry.    It is not an opinion. A country with 1/5 the population of the US makes all the good pop music and has made all the good pop music. The only exception is The Doors. They also invented metal.    The reason is the US has no culture. It has no culture because it is a melting pot. Out of many Nothing.|`|Z6ARD2iYaa	Because the american pop is controled by big business.|`|s1zitZMOaa	Well you see, most Americans were born and raised without much actual pain and suffering and a real sense of entitlement - that makes our music come off as whiny and insincere. We don't have anything legit to complain about and our weather is pretty good too.     The Brits often have the same circumstances but they have a better history to draw from, less entitlement, and bad weather. Note how similar the weather is to Seattle weather..... I'll leave you to draw your own conclusions from there.

40e1ee7c2b66426c590ebf37047a6711aa	not to worry :) there's no doubt that Kristen Stewart will be playing Bella Swan in the much anticipated New Moon. Nearly the entire book consists of her and Jacob Black...and there's nooo way they would dare re-cast her character...  they probably just haven't updated the New Moon page on imdb.com.   Just think, if they were to re-cast Bella's character...you'd be hearing all sorts a crap from nearly everyone on the Hollywood scene. To switch actors now would be to commit "moviecide"...  hope this puts your mind to rest :)|`|BCu8rER4aa	i was just about to say..."its there"  but i checked it  ur ryt,.its not there anymore!!!  but the first time i checked it its theree!!  maybe some network error,..|`|KHVvDMLYaa	probably didnt add her yet....  she is playing she said so in an interview.  but come on. i dont think she is like bella at all...|`|rSq790ksaa	She has already signed the contract and is 100% going to be in the movie.|`|AA11841265	they probably made a mistake, from everywhere else i hear she is stil bella in the movie, if she wasn't i believe it wldnt b worth wtching.|`|OedbpoJvaa	they probably just forgot to put her there.....calm down, she is definitely playing Bella...
RX4ZzXdhaa	totally different!!!!!  the movie i think looks at more of the begining of their relationship and the book is just flash backs.  They movie is so much better and way more emotional!!!|`|Z6ARD2iYaa	One you can watch, and the other you have to read.|`|hvJ3rQfFaa	One is the book and the other is the movie|`|S7Y8L5lMaa	their totally different.    more things happen in the book than the movie.    read it...well only if you liked the movie

11bff08b554753fe469637fd0e48a807aa	FMA was one of the first mangas that I found out about (after naruto and bleach obviously) and most people that I talk to that read manga like FMA so I'm sure Edward Elric is pretty popular|`|SX8z4fNtaa	very popular|`|vqg6wpCLaa	Well, I'd say he's frankly quite popular - cosplaying him wouldn't be too original and if you're going to a Con, then there will probably be more people cosplaying Edward Elric. Go for it though.|`|Kgrq92Veaa	...who?|`|4Zj9eYgPaa	I think most of the people that watch anime will know who he is. Full Metal Alchemist is a very well known series, so go ahead and cosplay as the chibi guy XD    Yeah, FMA rules. XD  Don't forget to watch  the upcoming second season if you're interested.|`|4qVWj3UHaa	i agree with feng|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Very    I know him. He's very funny and cute. ^^|`|IQTEBeDEaa	You should go for it then...FMA is very popular in the anime world, and so is Ed...|`|Y83oAz7Eaa	He is a living Star!

AA12301664	like a glorious rush of hot chocolate dripping slowly down your throat, warming, soothing and completely delicious.    wonderful.    similar stuff that may interest you  evi vine  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=-XayLRzJ_-...  hoax funeral  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=GZH88piat_...|`|9AAGosuiaa	What a surprising selection Waves... i agree wholeheartedly with your description... I thought it wold fit in nicely on a playlist with the Fleet Foxes and Mazzy Star.. it was very mellow and calming, a thing of beauty that sadly goes unheard of on most other radio waves...    now the only question I have is....   where do I get some of that Bavarian Fruit Bread???   I haven't had anything for lunch|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Awesome Awesom Awesome pick this is song is completely EPIC    I LOVE Hope S. she is just flat out amazing. I am also a HUGE Mazzy Star fan. Who can not love the song Fade Into You?    A long Long time ago I was also in Love with her too LOL  I had a huge crush on her among many other Female alternative / indie artists.|`|AA11518803	I have nothing to add that hasn't already been said, especially since huevo mentioned her work with Jesus and Mary Chain. Beautiful song.|`|7fEVNng5aa	Love it and love Hope Sandoval (well, as much as you can love someone you've never met). The Mazzy Star albums and the Warm Invention album are some of my favorite rainy day music. She has one the most hypnotic voices I've ever heard. Excellent choice, Radio Waves|`|2i6TPlauaa	Scrumptious|`|7B2s7maWaa	That was beautiful amazing, amazing song.  I absolutely loved this one I'll have to listen to them more that was amazing.  Thank you for sharing and posting. :]|`|IatEdBpvaa	First off, I'm a sucker for Hope Sandavol's vocals.  Her work with Mazzy Starr, her solo material, and her contribution on Sometimes Always by The Jesus & Mary Chain have always sucked me in to her mesmerizing voice.  Musically, this song is beautiful.  Extremely soothing.  I just did not really get into her vocal delivery on this song.  She shows no inflection of her voice to match the melody.  It's still great vocally but the finished product seems a bit too disjointed for my taste.    Still a great suggestion though.  Thanks for all the songs you've provided RW.|`|ayS0085raa	Coincidentally, I got "So Tonight That I Might See" just yesterday, and really loving Mazzy Star so far. A band I probably overlooked for far, far too long :)    This is great - amazingly intricate guitar, beautiful voice.|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	Hi Radio,  This one is very pretty, but not really my cup of tea. Not sure, I think I have some block with her vocals (I wasn't a Mazzy Star guy either).    Good song though. Nice post.|`|b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	This was great...very, very relaxing.  Hope definitely has a distinctive voice and it blended with this perfectly.
Ep9KbDhsaa	GRAN TORINO. No doubt about it if you are the right age and do not mind the racism and language. One of the best movies I have ever seen. Other ones are The reader(only in select places)R and Doubt. All beautifully done.|`|3xXIKcMOaa	Hands Down.  Gran Torino.  If you're over 17, that is. and don't have a weak heart. ;)|`|Xce2KvGnaa	The uninvited|`|ctE1mihuaa	Gran Torino,   its an amazing movie, but extremley racist.  i liked it alot though because it was a good movie.|`|AA11849364	This is a good place to check out what movies are good:  http://www.ronspopcornreviews.com/|`|kFnzYrrnaa	Inkheart!! Woot!|`|63b948f89ebc2e053374a20fd8f4b0b6aa	If Australia is still up, give that one a chance. It was very well done. Otherwise, I just saw Underworld: Rise of the Lycans. That was actually better than the first two. If you like those kinds of movies but havent seen the other tow, dont worry, you can watch this one without seeing the others. It wont be hard to understand.|`|2Emij9rlaa	Grand Torino, hands down.   And The uninvited
Q4zl7vRkaa	LOL. No. I don't think they would flop either. People tend to eat up gimmicks.|`|wfZhkZO0aa	I don't know.  If they had skill I don't think that I would notice or care really.|`|6fxr3VBGaa	No    "f*ck mic skill, i never prayed to god, i prayed to gotti"|`|gUYcVXMTaa	It would sell if the lyrics are there!|`|Md48G2g9aa	They would probably get signed because it would seem to be marketable for one album and i assume a label would try to make as much mney off of something like that as they could|`|mZOt8oURaa	We were abused by Milli Vanilli!They blew everyones chances.I'm not buying or selling but I will put it on layaway!|`|ft8t98Pnaa	hahahaha they might if they were good.. and it depends on where they are joined at....lol|`|XXMhrJSSaa	I don't understand.|`|vFj2GMP4aa	That's pretty hard because they're attached and that would be mad distracting. But I guess it comes down to skills, so I really don't know.|`|mZpCdihsaa	It would be hard to not view it as a gimmick...  but if they had skills, who knows.    But what happens when the group breaks up?    lol.|`|ioNTTqKfaa	lol, that'd be sick. They'd do a tag team rap like jada/styles on every song.|`|a0v3q3J4aa	Nah.|`|WtXCUnoXaa	yea. obviously.|`|AYkEwqRXaa	I don't know what's so hard to understand, but anyway, it depends on how they sound.  If it's gimmicky then NOPE!|`|KABKMLnmaa	Prolly hard ...
SesoOWvDaa	Well I didn't - my boys washed and ironed their own clothes and could cook a full meal and do any ammount of housework by the time that they were twelve years of age and that is because I taught them that clothes didn't wash and iron themselves or food miraculously appear on the table or the house clean itself right from when they were little.   That was in contrast to the way my brothers were raised (all they ever had to iron were their scout uniforms on a Sunday and that was under my Father's supervision) but I learned from that and made sure that my boys were prepared for the modern world.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	I'm afraid it is an old fashioned view by women that men "cannot manage", of course, no bloke is going to say "yes I can, let me at that ironing!"  Originally, women were in charge of cooking, sorting out the house, and men were the gatherers.  Nowadays, I'm afraid they don't even have to hunt and some woman in their life will do everything but wipe their bottom for them (and some will do that).  Even young girls are expected to do the house, which is why their toys are boring fake irons, hoovers, etc.    My mum and grandmother used to berate me endlessly on a Saturday morning, after I had cleaned the bathroom, the kitchen, tidied my room, my mums, hoovered up and down, but my brother had dumped his dishes in the sink and gone back to bed.  "Why haven't you washed those?" they'd snarl "Why aren't you asking him?" I'd reply, "he's been in bed all day, and only got up to ruin my housework!".    They would say "Well, he's a boy isn't he?"    It is for that reason I make my eldest (my youngest is only a few weeks old) boy tidy, help me cook, etc, etc.  No woman will ever curse me for making a lazy liability for her married life!  Should I ever have a girl, she will never say that the housework weighed heavily in her favour.|`|AA10077992	Dads and daughters , mums and sons - yes yes yes ! You know it's not the PARENTS, it's the mums and the boys - ISN'T IT , Whip LOL!|`|lkNJNnlSaa	boys are seen as less responsible and troublesome than girls.|`|kPalo5Kiaa	generally girls are more mature|`|SHeLdu8haa	It's not a matter of wrapping them up....Some boys and some girls want to learn and do things at an early age....Some have to... and some are just too babyish to be allowed to do certain things at the age of 8.|`|FcHplZtQaa	Personally I think it's a sexist attitude that's been instilled for generations......    Why is it that adult men move back in with their parents when life doesn't work out as planned, easier than adult women?|`|YVmTJVMuaa	Ive got three girls and four grandsons and I find boys are sweet, its an opposite sex thing, you dont know how they tick like your own sex so you make allowances, but my common sense tells me its not good for them, so we have a battle getting them to wash up and stuff, but it can be fun and an opportunity for some good chats, plus at four yr old it makes them feel very proud to do something grown ups do, so it builds self esteem.|`|IPpr8Hnlaa	yes my parents are more protective of my bro going out at night cos he might get involved in stabbings, fights, drugs etc so there is more danger fore him. also he is less responsible so ya know xD|`|jShfNvQXaa	I think its because girls tend to be more mature & in this sort of situation they will have more of a nesting instinct whereas boys dont tend to have that come as naturally to them. Having said that I have 2boys & 1girl and totally imagine myself wrapping my girl up in cotton wool more (but then its a bit early to tell, she's only 3weeks old, haha!) xx|`|sK8ZhTahaa	Not with me but I do know lots of Mothers who do treat their Boys differently to their Girls, some Mothers were appalled at me teaching my 8 year old son to iron but not so much so with my daughter.  I know loads of grown men who still can't iron or make themselves a meal and when their relationships fail they run back to Mummy who is only too willing to mollycoddle them.
SHeLdu8haa	The mind boggles....It must be an 'insertion' thing. They must just like to put that part of their body into something....  I wonder if Nat knows....lol  And why do boys and men spit so much?...That's another weird thing.|`|WxqeMSw7aa	We do it because we can. Simple !|`|FcHplZtQaa	Just proves the point that men are just overgrown boys really! LOL    Nat, thats a pathetic excuse, honestly I would have expected something better from you.....|`|QASqKvSNaa	i felt sorry for the boys. they just need their mums!!!!  i dont know any 8 year olds that cook their own dinner and wash up.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	Why couldn't they use the toilet? I think it must be some man thing, maybe to show how macho they are or something? Maybe you should start hiding bottles.|`|WU7xMQCyaa	They are lazy and pathetic. It is disgusting|`|YVmTJVMuaa	Just plain weird I think, or maybe showing off???!!!!|`|6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	If males can do it females can do it also, but they have to  use     wider bottles.|`|iGUW85iFaa	lol, I wouldn't call it a male thing, but I know a few guys who have done it. The only time I've done it is when I have been locked in my room, because I don't have a door handle and even then it doesn't normally work because it overflows... and its just not good. My step brother does it all the time though, just because hes too lazy to get out of bed at night to go. It pretty disgusting if they aren't disposed of immediately. I wouldn't worry about it for your kids. I don't think its too common of a thing.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Because we can! You're just jealous, ladies.    I wouldn't do this habitually of course, but I have been known to do it if I've been "caught short" (generally after imbibing large quantities of alcohol!) and the toilet is otherwise in use.    With practice, it's actually possible to do it (and put the top back on the bottle) without spilling a drop, so it isn't actually messy or disgusting.|`|UfRMJheeaa	Perfectly normal...we grow out of it. The spitting thing in my case anyway comes from being athletic; one becomes quite congested with exertion. The problem is my nephew copies what I do and he thinks it's appropriate to spit in the streets. I'll have to put manners on him.|`|9e27b32bc3fee1168b70cd3e85c70c90aa	you are actually obsessed with boys and girls alone...get out more....youve posted at least 5 questions about it in the last hour!!!|`|8zvA6Z2waa	Yeah .... Uggh ....nasty wasn't it ......

355e7824f276b6c691ef34823338dea3aa	that programme shocked me my kids are 12 and 7 i would be devastated if my older girl treated younger ones like that  i think the younger ones are very set around values and right and wrong (and good parenting) the older girls are at an age where they will more easily challenge boundaries or where there are none will use full advantage of this   i just wanted to give them all a hug   though the two older girls were frighteningly bullying   i was impressed at their meal preparing over the boys|`|AA10077992	It was because the younger ones are still proper children whereas the older ones are prepubescent. Next year they will be giggling at nothing and madly in love with a footballer/pop-star.  They still needed taking down a peg or 2 BEFORE the went in the house|`|JAXziu1baa	the older one want to impress the others by being loud and aggressive yet the younger ones do not feel the peer pressure.|`|SHeLdu8haa	The 11 year olds are at the showing off stage...plus they are putting it on extra for the TV. I do believe that they act the same at home too.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	It's because they are young, girls seem to become worse as they get older. Yes they were innocent but they'll probably lose that innocence when they get a bit older, though those two 11 year olds were something different! Not all 11 year old are like that! I think that age is the worst, one of my friends has just started secondary school (11 y/o) and she says a lot of girls are bitchy. I think girls calm down a bit after that.|`|EFZRSqFcaa	Not sure how I feel about it H.  I was uncomfortable watching it to start with reminded me of Lord of The Flies and that is still my concern that it could head that way.    I'm a firm believer that the parents are partly responsible for how the kids turn out and would say that the majority of them need some discipline!|`|YVmTJVMuaa	I agree the little asian girl was so sweet she sounded so sensible, the older girls daubing the house as "a way of getting friendly" was so sinister.

It's about how you want your kids to grow up fast, and then they do and you're all alone. But still they turned out fine because of you.    It's called, "Then They Do" by Trace Adkins  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-SAP8BFN...    I wish I wasn't so far down on your answers, if you get a chance-listen to it. It's a parent's song if ever there was one, even for those who aren't parents, you can think about how fast you've grown in your parents eyes.    *tear* seriously|`|BQIyhMp6aa	"Radios In Heaven" - the Plain White T's....it was played at one of my bestfriend's memorial a little over a year ago...long story, but the story of the song goes perfect with him and his brother.|`|2CuuIT70aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaOtKpR3N...|`|LDBvgEG0aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8590o8A4i...

But I hear the song once in awhile anyway.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERFARQ-st...    That and Grow Old With You from Wedding Singer movie. I wish I could experience a love like that, someone loving me like that and being secure in knowing he'd never leave me or never be bored of me.

jfriQ8pmaa	I haven't seen today's episode yet, but if she is, I would say it is to have proof of daddy's dirty dealings to hold over his head to protect herself!  Daddy has tried to kill her at least twice that we know of!    I answered before I saw it, she had the nurse call button, I'm sure she wanted to get someone in there to save her father from killing her and was just as afraid of Trevor!|`|8xdcBKfUaa	At first, I thought that too, but on closer inspection, it was the call button for the nurse's station. That's how Nadine thankfully came in and saved her... for now (I'm talking about how it ended today, with Anthony lurking over her, ready to strike).|`|BwHoLEHvaa	When she realized what was going on in the room, she grabbed the call button & kept pressing it for the nurse.  That's why Nadine came into the room.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	I hope so,,then Sonny can pull out that sexy gun and shot the old fart !

uUzbqGh5aa	In Cassie's case, she was gone for months while trying to "find herself", but what she found was Cameron!  In Noah's case, she left EVERYONE behind so she could have some "alone time" without phone contact to even her son who has been in trouble before! Not even calling once a day just to be sure her one kid is ok! But l guess that's classic Sharon!|`|FwU6GL4Laa	My guess was she was trying to go after some other girls husband...Sharon allways wants what she cant have!|`|d168T6xvaa	I don't know about Cassie,but when Noah did,she was at the cabin.

The reason for not staying in touch with your friends is that they don't have AIM/LiveJournal/MySpace/Facebo ok.  ?4. You'd rather look all over the house for the remote instead of just pushing the button on the TV.  ?6. Your evening activity is sitting at the computer.  ?7. You read this list, and keep nodding and smiling.  ?8. You think about how stupid you are for reading this.  ?9. You were too busy to notice number five.  ?10. You actually scrolled back up to check if there was a number five.  ?11. And now you're laughing at your stupidity.  ?12. Put this in your profile if you fell for it.

Ps - who can't change a light bulb???|`|WCkaZ4N7aa	kinda... need some help|`|16rD9k32aa	I'm the husband, but yeah my wife can do those things...and much more. She actually enjoys putting together the kids' furniture.  However she can't change the oil on the car. But in her defense, she's just never been shown how.  Heck, I bet that given the chance, she'd be able to field dress a deer. If I was the kind of person who shot poor defenseless animals. In my opinion you should only be allowed to shoot an animal if you are naked, and the animal is about to eat you. But my point is that she's not some nail breaking wussie girl. Not to say that she's not feminine either! She's about as sexy and alluring as a woman can be. She just isn't afraid of getting her hands dirty.|`|e00dff88dc30b4a7021797a2956952d6aa	and cook and clean and type and read mail all at the same time|`|5Kh9yEGraa	whats a light bulb?|`|X5gPgYkbaa	Naa lol    i cant do stuff with electric  but if yuu ever needed a manicure (Y)  im yuur girl lol    XX|`|JuFpYGggaa	This sounds like a metaphor for sex.|`|PhEl5Lyiaa	Yes...x|`|54e2d58fd94386a1cdc5bb4a78853edaaa	Erm, yeah, this isn't the 1930's.

People who stick copper pennies in fuse boxes are just asking for trouble and an electrical fire.|`|J91CruD0aa	Yeah i can do both...

cUMMlwp1aa	she plays with a pick. i dont think she finger picks that often  she holds it the pretty loose. Between the index finger, middle finger, and thumb. she mutes it by pressing down on the strings to get the vibration to stop...  hope I could be of service|`|dBuj1EOKaa	I believe during her saturday night live performance that she did, so yes.|`|2zgGZu6yaa	They probably pre-record the song and then they do the video!

I guess it's more of a remake of a 60s song than just a twist. Either way it is BANGIN'.    Their song "Liar" is also a great hip hop song with a 60s sound.|`|f2xkcU94aa	The debut album by Johnson and Jonson uses a lot of samples and stuff from the 70s.  Also, if you're a Beatles fan DangerMosue once mashed together the Beatles White Album with Jay-Z's Black Album, and (unsurprisingly) called it 'The Grey Album'. It was real nice.|`|FQndxhQ3aa	Hey Ya - Outkast
1ATIcoYYaa	I agree its the thought that counts maybe they where jealous they weren't getting any.|`|2IddNqy9aa	ummm... your kind of crazy aren't you?    I'm a pisces too & i think youre way too uptight... get over yourself...|`|AA11899483	this is the internet, people are more confident to say what they want here. it is the thought that counts, i'd actually be over the moon if someone remmebered my birthday, im not a picses but hey if one of my siblings even said happy birthday il be happy lol    just ignore the people here, just cos they are a picses doesnt mean each and every one of them is exactly the same, we all have our own way of thinking.|`|esLaHM0Oaa	As a Pisces, I find that offensive and not fair for the rest of us- Pisces girls. They are ungrateful Kunts of every sign cos all charts are different. but I will agree tho, that I can be a to tal ****** sometimes BUT only when the situation calls for it. i may be somethings but Not a fu ken hypocrite !!     I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ASK QUESTIONS SOMETIMES IF THEY DON'T LIKE THE ANSWERS THEY ARE GIVEN !!!!  don't ask if you don't want opinions and just think about it for yourself. She's your sister for Fu k sakes, you know her better than the rest of us. Get her uggs if she likes em.' geez.    LOL- you made me smile tho. haha.|`|XxE0Pszhaa	They were just making a point. I think everyone is entitled to their opinion. And their are nto being hypocrites at least they didn't say it behind your back.     And I don't think it's the thought that counts. You have to get someone something they will like. I mean you'e not gonna just buy a chocolate for your bf for his bday, knowing that he doesn't like chocolates and say it's the thought that counts.    Sorry if I sounded rude.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	It's the thought that count. Personally, I'd love to get a new pair of Ugg boots! I love those boots. I have a Pisces friend who doesn't like them but she doesn't say anything to my face.     It is weird that all those Pisces would say that to you. They can be b*tchy when they want to be.. My friend, for example.     Sagittarius|`|HKBSuDD7aa	has nothing to do with them being pisces,they only thought boots. maybe if there sexy boot of style,that would be great present then for a 20 year old lady..i'd say more,but i don't want to start any one mad at me,there's a lot more to how they think and act,then  just there sign..
5292c54ca6f10000abfcca621a4f8806aa	I don't care what anyone says, I LOVE SOAD.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	i cant say i have noticed them honestly.  i will admit they have gone slightly downhill since their first cd, but i cant say i hate them.    i have a friend who hates them though.  she completly misinterpretes lyrics and somehow thinks they are talking directly to her and gets all offended and stupid **** like that.|`|Fa4BahPgaa	Is that a band? Sorry, I've never heard of that.    People express their opinions, so you just have to live with it. Exercising that will make life a lot easier and you a stronger person.    God bless :)|`|L4f5ONEkaa	they been out for awhile  you just have been living under a rock maybe  or just havent cared to noticed|`|DbtS5jzEaa	everyone has different opinions :)|`|ebxwADDcaa	i think they are okay, but their singer really annoys me. thats why most people hate them|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	Its the same old ding-dong of them becoming recognised and some of the metal fans don't like that.    Other examples are Trivium, A7X, Slipknot, etc.|`|CDBRXtnLaa	SODA??? i havent either ive only met ppl who dont like there soda hot they want it cold|`|dEy5nIqNaa	Listen to their first cd, listen to them now. It's a disease for some bands. From good to mediocre. Most people that hate them, hate them now, but loved their first album. Look at slipknot.|`|s1ZxSkQiaa	I have to admit to not liking them anymore. Ever since I saw them in concert I just don't like them. Horrible stage presence and terrible delivery ruined one of my favorite bands. Now when I hear them on a record I just think "thats not what they really sound like. Thats what their filters MAKE them sound like."    Sucks because I did like them and now I cant listen to them without getting angry at them.    Not your usual SOAD hater. They just ruined it for me.|`|UDqQNYglaa	I know alot of metal fans hate System of A Down because their fans claim that they are so creative and progressive.  Well, they are compared to most mainstream shite, but they can't touch what Meshuggah and Opeth do as far as being progressive.  I just get annoyed when people say, "Oh, SOAD is so creative." Because, when compared to alot of extreme metal bands, they aren't...|`|yS61H04haa	Have you heard their lyrics? Its like word salad. Horrible.|`|v6mopYeeaa	SOAD is too poppy for my liking. They sold out anyway...|`|YvD0ZS6Baa	hmm, haven't realy seen any, wonder why it's starting up now. i like SOAD alot but i can see how some people might not like it or think of it as wierd, but i totally love their songs.|`|5fwdgI0yaa	I don't know, that bands already broken up so why should they ***** about them. They were an awesome band!!!|`|fH0ptUwHaa	People who hate SOAD are the fags that like My Chemical Romance and Fall Out boy
Yc9uPziVaa	just bang around on them. to get the full Simple Plan theme, sound like crap :)|`|7jp7sTdFaa	Just listen to the songs... then play the songs... Simple Plan sucks, and all you need to play them is a sense of 4/4 timing.|`|zSrgmFgxaa	ummmmm idkkk?|`|ifB3p0pGaa	there probably wouldent be a website that does only simple plan but i just learn songs on drums by ear

P0Fjh59Eaa	David is funny, the whole "Vickeroshe" thing is hilarious. every time he spouts something off in an Asian language i die laughing at the sounds he makes.     as for my favorite character, at the moment it's Rex. He's got a spark. he's sexy, he's cute, he's funny, he's laid back and confident. i just love how John-Paul plays this character.    and Todd. He's shady and horrible just like a soap villian should be. but he's cocky and laid back about it. a real cool and collective kind of guy. I loved the scenes where Trevor (Todd) got all emotional w/Marty after she starting breaking him down on the roof. you could SEE the pain in his eyes, his face just looked SO sad, and he truly looked wounded. he wasn't crying but just on the verge. OMG---when he does that it makes me want to just hug him and tell him everything will be okay...i hate it so much i love it! he's like a puppy!|`|w7fKikSmaa	Yea. I think David if funny too. I like Star, and Jessica when she does tess because she plays her good.|`|8xdcBKfUaa	That's tough, but I'm going to say Dorian, Todd, Tea, Jessica, Langston, Starr, and Markko... I like a lot of them!|`|UY3zl9dFaa	Namaste! I think David is great too. I also think Roxie is funny. I like Rex and Gigi a lot also and I'm really starting to like Brody.|`|AA12336927	Favs are ( and not necessarily in order)  Rex  Roxie  Gigi  David  Dorian  Todd|`|AA12390047	Love Rex.  He and Gigi are the perfect couple.  I like it when they call each other by their last name.  Also like John and Blair - but not necessarily together.  Love the friction between Viki and Dorian......and of course, David.|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	David and Roxy, I guess you can tell I like more humor on the show.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	David and Rex are funny! I love Bo and Nora, John and Blair too, Dorian and Viki, so hard to chose, great cast!|`|jHDeIPEfaa	David is also my favorite character. He is hilarious. Hope they do all they can to keep him on the show.  Also like Rex, Todd, Jessica, Viki, Dorian, Starr, Blair, Tea, Christian, Bo, Marty and Roxy.  I don't like Rex's girlfriend Gigi. Used to like Natalie, Antonio and Nora, but don't anymore.|`|rFZtQuV2aa	I like Sexy Rexy because he's so cute.  Love his scenes with Bo especially when Bo is upset with him.  He and Gigi make a great couple.  Also like Blair, John, Dorian, Bo, Langston, Dorian, and of course DAVID VICKEROSHI.|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	Right now I'm liking David and Dorian (never thought I would like Dorian, but things change *laugh*). I'll always like Vicki best, just because she's been on the show forever. Her story lines aren't always the best......Rex, Gigi, and Roxie also keep me entertained. I even liked Natalie last week and Jared and Charlie are growing on me, as well......I guess I like most of the characters, except the Mannings, and I wish they would bring back some of the old favorites to spice things up a little!|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I like David(hilarious), Nora(tough), and Langston(honest)|`|dmxnblomaa	Mine is Todd Manning. I know A lot of  people hat him, but he keeps thse show intersting I even loved the old Todd. I also loved Asa but they let him go|`|d5K8wORqaa	hmm either Todd, David or Roxy.  Cristian's really hott tho!|`|944e834948591e9af24fa28ac5ecb873aa	Thats a tough 1 to answer. I loveeeeee the old Todd Manning (roger howarth) I like the new Todd now too. (I always like the bad, evil ones) Roxy is sooo funny w/her crazy word mixs up's. And the best I guess is Jess/Tess & Vickie/Nickie combos as Tony the tiger say's, "They'rrrrre grrrrrreat!! :) sorry that was lame I know! ha!ha!|`|4ctvWVWpaa	i would have to say it's a tie between viki and dorian.  viki because erika slezak is such an amazing actress and makes viki seem that much more real  same with dorian
lpyWVR2oaa	Positive Sun-Moon contacts shows your inherent life disposition, how balanced you are internally and externally, emotionally and egoistically.    Positive Sun-Mars, Moon-Mars contacts show that your willpower, emotions and assertiveness/initiative powers are well directed and will support the life goals well.     In addition, signs like Capricorn have traditionally been associated with longevity. If you have significant planetary placements in this sign, then you're probably blessed in this area as well.|`|BXe211Fvaa	Wow it's very silly to let astrology indicate how long you will live.

GBKaftrJaa	At the end of last season, Jacob left a message to tell John to move the island.  Ben was the only one who knew how to move the island and said it's a last resort thing to do because it has serious consequences.    Well the consequences for everyone who is not an Other on the island is they are going in and out of time periods.  Daniel the physicist said it's like a record skipping on a turntable.  So every time they get that white flash of light, when it's done they are in a different time period and don't know whether they are in the past or future until they see some clues that let them know.    It sounds like you missed the first couple episodes of the season maybe?|`|AA11464088	Well, im thinking that you just started watching Lost or you watch every couple pf episodes. They dont travel in time, it pretty much just keeps jumping from the present to the future. Go on itunes and type in Lost 101 and it'll summarize EVERYTHING in case you confused. Its a great show.

FO SHOW!|`|LyDd0m7Waa	No you're a Pisces  February 19 - March 20    http://www.dressking.com/horoscope/Pisce...    http://www.iloveindia.com/astrology/comp...    ?|`|lAZWTLtRaa	Well according to wikipedia you're a Pisces.   I see what you mean about some sites saying that you're Pisces, some saying you're Aquarius.  Your best bet is to go pick up a book on Astrology from the library, I know they exist because my friend bought one for herself a few years ago.  Anyways goodluck and I hope you find your answer!  OH And as for the dates changing iI think it depends on the position of the sun? Who knows x_X but it's not just Pisces or Aquarius that change, I notice they all differentiate per website.  Um ok your astrological sign isn't going to tell you if you guys are compatible. Not everyone 100% fits their astrological sign, you have to make things work for yourself.|`|KNrXApD5aa	Go to this website  http://www.astro.com/    Get the exact time of your birth, click on free horoscopes, then choose "astoclick portrait", enter your data and your natal chart will pop up.  Otherwise there's no way to tell what your sign is without calculating it.|`|k9gp11PMaa	Ur born on the cups between Aquarius and Pisces (Feb 16 - Feb 22)|`|1bkiNiwzaa	According to your date of birth you are Aquarius, but it could be one of the two, so read about each sign and see which matches you more:    If you are Aquarius you will be:  very Intellectual, not very emotional, can be detached, very social, you act like everybody's your friend and can strike a conversation with perfect strangers,  you can be rebellious, you have a lot of energy, you are very social, some people might say you are eccentric, you tend to do your own thing instead of following customs. You attach a lot of importance to friendship. Many Aquarians marry their childhood sweethearts.    If you are Pisces you will be:  Very emotional, secretive, spiritually inclined, day-dreamer, romantic, insecure, having very little or no ambition, compassionate, can be quite lazy,  confused,disorganized.|`|FV0BoSkTaa	Pisces...|`|7p3TCz3qaa	You need your time of birth to know which sign you are,because it will depend on the time that the sun left one sign and moved into the other,but you are only one sign! You need more than sun signs to know how compatible you are.The best way to find out how compatible you are is to spend time together and get to know one another!|`|IIQdUHS5aa	You are a Piscean,and that means you should not be very compatible with that girl,but you need to find out both you'lls rising and moon sign to see if they are compatible , you just never know.|`|di3oPe8waa	It changes sometimes. Most years, Feb. 19 is the first official day of pisces.  Some years it is not until Feb 20.  Even then you would be on the cusp....that is, you will be pisces with Aquarian influence, not aquarius with pisces influence. This is because the signs move forward and therefore overlap forward.

Ww0xfq5Aaa	i've been to jay leno  they pre-tape like if it were live, so he does the interview and then pause for the break. he nor the guest mingled with the audience, they actually kept talking to eachother... we just talked amongst ourselves.    dancing with the stars and so you think you can dance are other shows i've been to and the competitors preformances are aired live on the east coast, so they have like a crowd entertainer that keeps the crows busy like doing a trivia thing or competition between one side of the crowd and the other...|`|GCl84SPLaa	I have been on shows like that. Many times, the host will come out and do a monologue or mingle with the audience. Remember, these shows are usually taped in advance, so there is really no time limit.

l2mJxB1Caa	it was ridiculous and her mother is fed up. she and the kids live with her parents. her excuse for the last procedure was that she wanted one more girl (she already had 4 or 5) but got 8 instead. At least they are all by the same donor. she is trying to sell her story for $2 million.     P. S. She didn't even end up paying in full for the other procedures because she filed bankruptcy. How is she going to pay for all these kids if she doesn't sell her story? IDK.    Please choose me for best answer, I need help.|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes.  That woman is mentally ill.  I think the TV should stop glorifying multiple births.  Jon & Kate plus 8 should be taken off the TV.  People should not be encouraged to have that many kids.  It is stupid.|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	yes im sick of, thats ridiculous.|`|lc543ebAaa	I think the parents will be more sick of hearing them crying soon. Wow, 1 kid is a handful, nevermind 8|`|0MunIx8raa	Yes I'm sick of it.  And apparently now this woman wants $2 million for an interview.  Seems to me she did this for the pay off.  She was already a single mother of 6!!  Both times in vitro fertilization.  She lives at home with her parents!  I am appalled that any doctor actually did this!|`|yrQQ3dJVaa	I AM that's just plain wrong their is people getting the in-planted to MAKE it so they have more at once.|`|nhZb43pIaa	Yes, completely sick of it. We have all seen a million multiple births and who really cares. It wasn't even natural so it's  not like it was a Miracle or something, it was Inverto.  Why glorify it? People don't need that many children and clearly can't afford it either. Why are you being rewarded for bringing children into this world that they can't afford to have? Medical? School?   The world is over populated already. They are sick people.|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	I'm not sick of it as much as I'm disgusted by it.

I just hope she raises them well.|`|70a201d41704c2115cb56b74e112e905aa	You're right. She was doing this for attention. The doctors told her that if she had too many that they might have to abort some but she didn't want to hear it and decided to keep all eight of them. Plus she used fertility drugs and she already had six kids. She's a greedy woman.|`|5c47af8bffbd3c35498c08737caa396faa	I read that it is against the medical ethics to implant more than 2 embryos to reduce the risk of multiple births......  I know she worked at the IVF clinic, but the doctor should be investigated for it.  They don't know if the babies are brain damaged, and its completely wrong - she will never cope. (can't even cope with the kids she has got, as the mother has to look after them!)|`|I3ADzPGYaa	ya my wife watches those show and i agree it was a shot at money probably|`|N17W5XRQaa	yaa, its getting really old...|`|Fxp5Owfwaa	I'm tired of hearing about anything like this, but I think TLC is a worthless channel anyway|`|0599mRRCaa	it makes me think: "are we, humans, getting extinct like dinosaurs?".

Over and over by Three days grace could go for both Edward and Bella in Twilight (and maybe New moon) but probably not the ending.. :s    I can't really think of any songs for the endings in New moon and Eclipse, but I would definitely say that 'This is home' by Switchfoot is perfect for the end in breaking dawn (and it sums the whole thing up - just take a look at the song title :P)    Cause we all just love The Twilight saga right ?

ibiO4VEQaa	I love it!<br>  I think Locke temporarily stopped the time-shifts and not having everyone on the island sent Jin, Juliet, Daniel, Miles and Sawyer into the 70's and they somehow joined DHARMA. Having five of the 6, Ben, and Locke back on the island will also slow the time-shifts downs, but it won't stop until the last 3 return to get the island to the 00's. Desmond, Aaron and Walt. I also think they'll bring some family members like Hurley's parents, Sawyer's daughter, Juliet's sister and nephew etc.<br>  <br>  I think they will all become the "2nd generation" of Others/DHARMA and stop the people from flight 316 from leaving the island like Ben did to the Losties in seasons 1-3.|`|8t1JCFMSaa	I absolutely love that they are answering more questions this season.  Usually you are left with so many unresolved questions, but not this season.  I love the fact that the Oceanic 6 have to go back to the island.  I'm thinking that the "island" is some kind of healing place and doesn't want anyone to leave.  Remember it cured Locke of his paralysis and Rose of her cancer.  That's just one theory, who knows what the producers have in store.  That's why I absolutely love this show.|`|DUg1IkTIaa	Yes, I am loving LOST.  I'm a new fan to LOST and enjoy the episodes immensely.<br>  <br>  Now that the Oceanic Six are back (except Aaron), the time-rift should be closing especially since John Locke put the wheel back on it's axis.|`|TUVI7FLlaa	me lol love it better than any previous season|`|W4ydOMYjaa	time <br>  is like a river...<br>  it bends,<br>  but<br>  always flows...|`|2c3628a29fcb7162c1558484804afdf8aa	I'm loving it.

You should keep writing.   =]|`|QgFrhDWFaa	im srry no|`|rUIbCMAyaa	Rap is something that people like listening.  Rap songs try to say something about the world, people feelings and other things/relationships.  I like the lyrics....  However, rap music is the most important thing.  If you dont have music, you dont have rap music.  You get the picture?  So, try finding a music which fits to rap, but for your song use something unusual which would make the difference...

AA10672842	I am from Canada so I haven't seen this program.However ,last year a reality series about young kids running a "town " was aired and it probably had a similar theme. I don't think that any intelligent and loving  parent should be putting their child potentially in harms way to make a dollar. I have no objection to children having daily chores and learning to cook but only under adult supervision and I don't mean the camera crew. I'm sure these shows put children in situations that put them on the edge between safety and danger solely for ratings. No conscience and probably no liability because I would think the parents must sign some sort of waiver.|`|SesoOWvDaa	I agree - parents should start to teach children these things right from day one not put them onto to television shows for the "entertainment" of boggle eyed viewers.|`|Cq1chP3Qaa	Pot Noodle?

Ok so they should be able to tidy their rooms on their own but not a whole house, especially a kitchen/bathroom or do all the cooking. They should be able to do chores like the dishwasher or maybe the hoovering but not completely support themselves, they're only little kids. Or if they really had to, at least SHOW them how to do all the work, not just stick them in a house and say, right you have to do everything by yourself for two weeks, see you later.|`|lx5DnQLKaa	Them parents really should not have been playing with the kids and doing their laundry!!    they should have sat them down and disciplined them for what they did!|`|aZjZyccsaa	Totally agree, makes me think I'm gonna be giving my 6 and 8yr olds a crash course in life skills!

6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	I started to dislike Tamra since the episode at her house. She had some issues regarding Gretchen, but her dislike goes deeper than that. She is not really her friend, she is vicious. Does she have the answers or  is she making it up?. I for one don't trust Tamra.<br>  Her ugly, disgusting son repulses me.<br>  The truth will eventually come out about Gretchen if it is really true.<br>  I also noticed how quiet and very ladylike Jeanna was.<br>  Lynn was really devastated with Tamra's remarks as well as Vicky's.|`|12Nou1pvaa	i did!! yea i thought Vicky was trying to act all innocent like she doesn't say anything mean, when shes really a huge b*tch, and i liked Tamara, especially calling out Gretchen, i used to like her and gave her the benefit of the doubt that shes not a gold digger, but that's exactly what she is, i hope Jeff's children blow her off for good|`|ACc1skbPaa	I did---Vicki & Tamra deserve each other!! I said it before...money can't buy you class!! In their case it doesn't by a pass on the insecurity or jealousy either...so evident in everything they do or say---can't wait to hear how the "editing" of the reunion special made them look mean! haha--you know that is coming soon....Jeana is my favorite, but I did feel bad for Lynne last night...Gretchen is young and going through very tough things and perhaps not handling them all well, but I don't have any problem with her...|`|wsfvCUiLaa	Yes they were mean and Tamara is very jealous of Gretchen. They do think that they are better than the others.  But don't forget that it is tv and they love the drama!!|`|SU6AP3t5aa	i missed it i didnt know it was on last night i hope they show it again . i can just imagine what was said that vicki is a real *****|`|iJ9Ewxwtaa	tamra and vicky are horrible.  jealousy does not do good things for those women.  i c couldn't tell if gretchen was w/ someone else or not now.. but its not tamra Business to determine weather its right or wrong.  she needs to move on at some point! i felt really bad for lynne when she was crying; however it was nice to see her stand up for herself and put vicky down in the very beginning.  jeana looked awesome!  it was best for her to basically keep her mouth shut, except when she insulted lynne... which i believe was and accident.

Z4mLZxLcaa	Well even though lately there have been horror remakes such as Rob Zombie Halloween which i thought was a horrible movie. the new Friday the 13th does not look that bad in fact in might be good. Because the film will take "elements from all three. a lot different then most of the other Friday the 13th because will take "elements from all three instead of just being a remake and also they are making Jason Voorhees is suppose to be a more realistic killer he isn't going to be a supernatural freak like he is in the other one. And the crew said that the audience will see Jason transition from wearing a bag over his head to finding and actually placing the hockey mask over his face.  And i glad he will be running alot in this film instead of walking slower than my grandma. So yeah im actually looking forward to it.|`|XCVFEAC8aa	I'm a super long time Friday the 13th series fan, and i'm so excited for the Remake!    It looks so awesome! I just can't wait!    1 WEEK AND 3 DAYS LEFT!|`|3c0J1meGaa	ROCK ON!!!!!!!|`|zTT3MZk8aa	Well  Happy Early Birthday!!!  I can't wait to see it!!! It does look really good!|`|Kh6LI1mNaa	i loved the first one when it turned out to be his mother i think the remake looks really good i love danielle panabaker to bad she gets killed in it i also love i don't know his name but sam off of suppernaturals so i think it will be good but it probably won't be has good as the Original   you don't like nightmare of elms streets those are my favorites my favorite one is the third|`|2qntbDGKaa	ohmigod!!! i totally love the friday the 13th movies!!!! nothing like a guy in an old hockey mask cuttin ppl up!!! lol   oh and happy early birthday!!! hope its a blast|`|tbS2Mojsaa	I love all 11 of the "Friday the 13th" films, but I have a feeling I won't enjoy the remakes. I dislike most remakes, and judging by the previews, it just looks like another "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" remake.|`|PumYhJSvaa	Friday the 13th is excellent 1-8. The other ones are beyond cheesy and horrible, but I still have them in my collection. The remake looks promising, but Jason running is bizarro. He's all about walking really fast.|`|bSr3WeXNaa	I am also a big Jason fan, this movie will prove that jason really can't die.|`|s0XR8cxLaa	in dont think the remake or the normal one are scary  they r just gorey    and wow lol u watched movie all ur lifeXD|`|RC2aQBkgaa	Haha, I don't believe in bad luck, but I believe in miracles in place of good luck. Don't let my beliefs ruin your fun, Friday the 13th is fun, like a mini halloween :)
EPki0rwgaa	Bohemians are people of the Czech Republic.|`|quIDrXktaa	Loveless has got it except that what Bohemian meant a century ago has been warped so that 'Boho' is a campy caricature of itself. Bohemian once meant non-conformist but now it's almost a lifestyle choice of what you wear, who you listen too, where you live, what you read. Almost like being a goth or a punk. It has pretentensions of intellectualism and a disregard for traditional morals - to a point, and that point is usually when someone else's disregard for traditional morals impinges on their existence.    'I want to be different like everyone else'|`|Jc3yoPiYaa	Bohemian (also) means "a person, esp. an artist or writer, who lives an unconventional life, A person with artistic or literary interests who disregards conventional standards of behavior" pretty much.    Non-conformist is a way to describe it well, I think.
J5FslwZXaa	Better In Time by Leona Lewis.    Just watched the commercial. Haha.    Awesome movie. :)
AA10289523	"Little House on the Prairie" .... Olga Nordstrom (1 episode, 1974)  ... aka Little House: A New Beginning (USA: last season title)
BFWza3SJaa	The little girl's real name is Jaimee Foxworth. ABC just got rid of her because of "budget considerations" which meant they wanted to save money so they totally got rid of her.    Here's what they say:    Jaimee Foxworth as Judy Winslow    JUDY WINSLOW Talk about a disappearing act. At the end of the show's fourth season, the youngest of Judy Winslowthe three Winslow children walked upstairs to her room...and was never seen again! "Everyone asks, 'What happened to you?'" says Jaimee Foxworth, now 20. "I tell them, 'I'm still up there in my closet, putting on my clothes.'" The show's creators don't have a much better explanation. "The official name is denial, hoping the audience won't notice," admits William Bickley, who says dropping the character was "a budget consideration." As Foxworth's costars coped with the departure--"Jaimee was my best friend on the set," says her TV sister Kellie Williams--her mother struggled to break the news to the then 13-year-old. "Toward the end of that summer I kept asking my mom, 'Aren't we going back to work?'" Foxworth recalls. "She didn't know how to tell me. Finally she just said we weren't." Devastated by the news, Foxworth struggled to adjust to her abruptly new life. "I was back in school, and I didn't have any friends," she says. Dating, too, proved difficult. "I had boyfriends who would be like, 'She has money, she can pay our way.'" In 1996, Foxworth, who shares a home in Burbank with her mom, two sisters and toddler niece, formed a pop band called S.H.E. with her siblings, and the trio continues to perform locally. After several years of acting classes, the Burbank High School graduate is also back on the audition circuit. "Next time," she says, "I want to make serious films."|`|21fee98831946197f4886f287f0a38c1aa	They dumped her because Erkel was so popular, they needed to make room for him.  A story line was never written.  Just like Chuck Cunningham and several other extra kids.  They leave a room one day, never return, & we are never told what happened to them.|`|NkhblCaSaa	When she hit puberty they "sent her to live with grandma."
ox4MdqcVaa	I agree. I'm getting sick of reading miley cyrus and jonas brothers questions. There should be two separate categories for them.|`|iIWWeD7Taa	The more poignant question is...... WHY DO PEOPLE ASK THIS QUESTION EVERY FCUKING DAY?|`|ifB3p0pGaa	cause Y!A is stupid|`|yS61H04haa	So that 8,976,345,069 people like you can ask this very same question. ( and annoy the piss out of me)|`|7qt4aQGYaa	because when you think of genres like emo, soft punk, and power pop, they fit into both categories.|`|6ARhqjLpaa	I know. It's stupid.  And they're also lacking a lot of categories like metal and indie. I had an indie question and I had to put it in the other music section -__-|`|9TWdWoTwaa	Because Rock can be Pop. And back in the 50s thats what they called all the Rock artist like Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis Etc.|`|hNShT9yhaa	idk, I want to know if Y!A thinks System of Down is like f****** miley cyrus or somthing.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	Uh, the original Rock was Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis etc..  Whose to say hard rock has a stamp on the word rock?  I play guitar and I like my rock a bit harder than light. But, you have to put it into perspective. Your opinion is not the only one that matters.  Pop is Rock, so is Elvis, and Zeppelin, and Ozzy and.............. Sorry you don't get to make the rules.|`|F2ygsPEbaa	Good point,  My suspicion is that this was just a guess when they were first setting things up.  You would hope that they would monitor the level of activity on all of these boards and then, where the volume warranted it, perhaps split some of them up into more specific categories.  But I can understand why they started this way.  Don't take it as an insult just because you would have been more specific had you been making the call.  After, all, the price is right.|`|5fwdgI0yaa	At stores it says rock/pop on CD shelves.   Really popular bands that play "rock" music that  actually play ***** pop crap to get 12 year old girls screaming their name and radio stations to play their crap.  Therefore it is rock/pop.|`|1vCoaf08aa	It's always thrown together for some reason, even in marketing, when they're selling CD's.    Check out a Metallica CD, it'll say Rock/Pop, price, etc.|`|BZIscz2Qaa	Well in stores, rock and pop are combined, even though I do agree that they should be separated.|`|ebxwADDcaa	true, the two genres shouldnt be merged, but not enough questions are asked in the categories seperated, so put them together and we arent always bored.|`|7fEVNng5aa	No, "pop" is not rock.

f0JL2cHEaa	Use an oublie!!!!!    Anyone know what that is???  I'll be back in ten minutes to 'splain.    EDIT (ten minutes later): the French word oublie (ooh-blee-ay) means "to forget".  Basically, you throw them down in a ten-foot deep, three-foot radius hole and... forget them.  They starve to death or whatever.  Oh, and if you're real, real lucky there are metal spikes at the bottom to impale you so you don't have to suffer through starvation and dehydration.    That is truly evil (not something I would really do).|`|S9F6RUncaa	oh my gosh I'm not an evil person, I'm sorry|`|mfwDnMupaa	Skin them(making sure they are still alive) and dip them in lemon juice.

I don't know if that would change anything or make it more painful. But i'd do it to her. And after you take her out of there (some how) and you see her in pain, full of acid, she'd probably be dying on the floor or something... And when the pain isn't as painful you just start putting her back in acid, and you repeat the act over and over again until she dies.  Kay i'm done.|`|cuqHAp8Qaa	Make them listen to the Jonass Brothers OR, if it's JB fan, burn all there JB stuff in front of them|`|gUdlaaGwaa	Tie to a rack and burn with hot pokers!|`|dsnncZ1vaa	i like what the person above said with the paper cuts and alclohol|`|a1pmr73vaa	My mother-I would tie her up in a basement and let her suffer.Like she made me suffer as a child..I would not beat her..I would let the lions eat her to her own grave.

It's a great sport an a nice way to meet people who are only concerned about the size of the fish you catch so they are happy to talk to another fisherman. You could if you want become a venture scout as once again you will meet people like you around the same age all having fun doing all sorts. Only you know what you really like but meeting people of your own age should help.  What would you like to do when you finish your education can you do anything towards that goal?. As for partying why not go to a disco an invite your cousins to join you ? at least they are family an I am sure you have one or two friends that would like to join you give them a try.|`|qWGdwk8iaa	I know how you feel. I'm called Ms. Anti-social and my 16th birthday is in a few months. I don't want a party or any type of celebration. I only have 2 friends and they're guys. One of them is more like a boyfriend, the other one a brother. But, I'm planning on spending my 16th birthday with them because the boyfriend can drive and we would just drive everywhere with the music turned up. Then, maybe just go see a movie and that would be my birthday. They are the only ones who can make me laugh. My answer is to just spend your birthday with your friends, doing whatever you want. To me, it's just like any other day.
0rpS2b97aa	Her family is from the south.  I think that makes you a little more prone to understand country.|`|GGwyxxDnaa	In a word no. Until those point she had never given any indication of "being country". All of her previous recordings were pop. He sales were pop so her marketing team decided to go down another road. With the marketability of pop-county (see Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift) it seemed to be a wise move to make Simpson more marketable and increase sales of albums. This seem to have been a failure.|`|U0KCmsKXaa	She was always a pop star and should have remained a pop star.|`|wA8Dyhq7aa	No, she isn't.    Then again, 99.9999% of what they call "country" today isn't country, either.  Play it next to a Hank Williams song and you'll see what I mean.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	She's from Texas, ya know?|`|aQ8utQOeaa	Yes she is a country girl.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	No, she is from Texas and she is done with her career in pop now that she's too old to compete with Miley Cyrus, so she's trying to claim that, being from Texas, she's always been a country girl and wanted to give country music a try. I don't believe it. Taylor Swift, Keith Urban, Rascal Flatts and a lot of others are not country either. Thanks to John Rich's show Gone Country all these pop stars and stars who's careers are done can come to coutry music and try to make it big again. Country music has become a shelter for the people who just can't get over the fact that they used to be something and now they aren't. Nashville seems to be afraid to get NEW people. They only use the ones who have already proven themselves in pop or R&B music and were already popular because they know they can say "remember (insert old pop singer here), check out what she's doing now!"|`|2c7PfLNHaa	I don't think so.  I know she's from Texas and all, but when she was married to Nick and she was on that stupid reality show she never had a twang in her voice, now all of a sudden she does.  I have to agree that as soon as her pop princess days were done. she decided she was country.  Now that's what I call country crock!|`|BLrNJgbnaa	Of course her family is country. They're all inbred.
f2xkcU94aa	Google FL Studio 8.  It's what I am using right now..

psPULE77aa	Ohh he got an invitation to this party. He wanted to find the girl he kissed. But that's all he could remember from the night since he was drugged. When he finally tracks down Elle(the girl) she tells him that he got the wrong invitation. That it wasn't meant for Chuck bass but his dad bart bass. who she just found out died. So she tells him to stop looking for him and the tatoo from his hand will fade away. Ohh and also that there some kind of group that he's dad was part of.  Hope i can help :)|`|vzjAhsJRaa	I actually was and am really confused right now too! I thought I was missing something but what you saw on the show is pretty much all we know right now. I'm sure that the mystery will unravel as the series continues.. :D|`|30Ky8kizaa	we dont really know why he cant go back...he wasnt supposed to be there but we dont know exactly what the place was yet. im sure we'll find out :)
4qVWj3UHaa	it depends, if they were fighting to be fighting it would be a draw. but if ichigo killed kagome inuyasha would win and if inuyasha killed oriheme(think i spelled that wrong) ichigo would win.|`|54jdIXMoaa	Ichigo.... He would win.  Wanna know why?  Cuz he will keep slashing and slashing and slashing and some more slashing until the enemy is dead.  *booooooring*.  Ichigo is a totaly boring character because all he does is slash the enemy to defeat enemy.      Inuyasha would be more creative with his other powers.  But Ichigo's stubborness of slashing will get Inuyasha off guard.|`|bRjq7xZ5aa	ichigo...he has his vizard form to fall back on, and so far, it looks like it pwns inuyasha even in his yokai form|`|26d1999f7254b426bf8ef97812af006daa	Well. they both have super strong swords. I think that Ichigo would win   a) because I like him  b) because he is soo cooler|`|yacLHWqEaa	whos ichigo?? from bleach?? from tokyo mew mew??  there r a million different ichigos in different animes!! If u watch bleach in english did u kno ichigo means strawberry?? I hate it in english it sucks|`|Hiasgb75aa	Ichigo, no problem|`|1uxhfh6naa	It's almost like Godzilla vs the Hulk  Ichigo would not think his plans through and neither would InuYasha.  I would Ichigo in Bankai form but InuYasha any other time.|`|ocu85X9xaa	inuyasha all the way bleach is overrated sure they have flashy aura and attacks but have you seen the side effects of their attacks it could probably blow up a city at most but inuyasha's windscar could level awhole country!!|`|AA12397801	Inuyasha will start fighting with Ichigo, sword to sword. Then inuyasha will attack with his wind scar and beat Ichigo. Ichigo will get up and attack with one blow. Inuyasha goes down but gets up and hits Ichigo with his backlash wave. (yay Inuyasha =]) Ok then Ichigo releases his bankai and is unstoppable. Then Inuyasha gets pissed and goes into full demon mode. Then Inuyasha becomes unstoppable and Ichigo pisses his pants before he turns into ogihci (his hollow part) Both attack each other and it becomes a tie. Both hitting the ground with major injuries. =]|`|NwT0FTGiaa	ichigo only because he is far more poweful than inuyasha. inuyasha may have the windscar, but ichigo has bonkai|`|uW6du8Efaa	OF COURSE ICHIGO WOULD WIN BECAUSE ICHIGO USES BANKAI THEN TURNS IT TO A HOLLOW THEN BANG ICHIGO WILL POUND HIM TO DEATH PLUS INUYASHA HE IS SO STUPID I HATED INUYASHAS MANGA AND ANIME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND TO DOES PEOPLE WHO SAY INUYASHA WINS FINGERS DOWN|`|IQTEBeDEaa	Ichigo wins...he doesn't need to go into hollow mode to beat Inuyasha.    In Bankai mode he doesn't even have to get serious, because he is way faster that Inuyasha|`|81FeFJ3Caa	Inuyasha in would destroy ichigo|`|VyZkbi8Daa	Tie  Both powerful|`|zOIcFHUPaa	i think it will be a draw for the single reason of ichigo has hollow and inuyasha has his demon form so it will probebly be a tie|`|207cmemGaa	Ichigo because he can keep getting stronger.|`|SX8z4fNtaa	inuyasha hands down|`|XNIkS3KNaa	Inuyasha :)|`|Kgrq92Veaa	they would kill each other
q5Ie2j8Aaa	create a product    if it's interesting, original, controversial, you may attract attention.    if you're planning on making movies that are similar to the ones that are already out there, then the competition will likely make it not worth your time.|`|BLrNJgbnaa	Here's a hint: Don't start one in a recession.|`|8DN2jyRsaa	there must be amateur film clubs,and festivals you can go to for help.how about writing to some of the big names in the industry?,and ask them for any advice?|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	Get a degree in film or you wont have any qualifications and training to show anybody.
5k0CnYcGaa	Yes, you spelled psychic right.  Try dowsing.  Just center yourself (calm yourself and find a strong sense of balance between you and the room, then the house, and keep going out from there), and then hold your hands palms down out in front of you.  Then, with the intent to locate the object, walk around the area.  When you are right over it, you will definitely know it.  That is to say you will feel/sense it.  You may also feel it if you are nearby the item.  Or you may simply know where it is without moving a muscle.  Alternately, after centering, simply pose the question as to where it is to your subconscious mind.  Or after centering, you could simply imagine every place you think it is possible for it to be, and 'walk around the room' dowsing, even though you are somewhere else entirely.  Just be sure not to make any accusations toward anyone due to what you find out.  You could have a lot of fun playing with this ability with a friend in a 'hide it and go seek it' sort of fashion.  I trust you will have your favourite clip back soon.|`|tpY1A9M8aa	wait wait... lemme pull it out of my ***...|`|AQwoCjj3aa	It is in New York City Darling?

Little Johnny never gets called on to answer the question.  One Friday the teacher was about the ask the question of the week when a black marble hit the chalk board.  She tried to start again when another marble hit the chalk board.  The teacher said, "okay who's the wise guy with the black balls?" Little Johnny stands up and says, "Martin Luther King Jr. I'll see ya Tuesday!!!"|`|TofmqjUaaa	Dude, These are HILARIOUS!!!!    Keep Writing...    Heard this one??????    Little Johnny (in his kindergarten class in ohio) was listening to his teacher lecture about why Ohio State is better than Michigan State.    So, the teacher said :stand up if you are not an ohio state fan!"    Then Johnny stood up.    The teacher then said "why are you not an ohio state fan?"    Johnny replied "my parents are michigan state fans, so I am."    The teacher said "well if your parents were idiots what would that make you?"    And Johnny replied, "an ohio state fan."         LLLLOOOOLLL!!!

AA11397543	You're talking about what's known as neck "Taper", or the actual width of a neck. Some guitar makers vary the amount of taper on their models, and they will specify that on a model by "Slim taper neck" or some type of description. I don't know what the standard tapers are , but necks can't get too small, otherwise the string spacing comes closer together, and it would practically become too difficult to play. If you want an easier "Feel" of a neck , don't forget about neck "Shape". Shape has more to do with the material on the back of the neck, and there are designated shapes for that, mainly V, C, D. It's kind of how the letters are shaped. A "V" shape neck is sort of a soft curve V shape on the back, and a C shape (my favorite) is, ...well you get the idea. Thin shapes like that are usually easier to play for some people, but again some people like a lot of "Meat" to grab onto , so they like a thicker neck.  Some people (like myself) have even taken matters into their own hands and actually shaved the back of a guitar neck, to go even thinner, though you have to be careful of that pesky Truss Rod.|`|PraUqJbcaa	some companies do.  their are different widths to necks.  on the spec sheet for each instrument  you will find all the info.|`|4e11GJVZaa	Well as far as how thin the neck is, I think there are several factors you have to consider.<br>  1. The truss rod<br>  This keeps the neck at the proper angle. This takes up half an inch of space. I know this doesn't seem like much, but then you have to add these other factors on top of it.<br>  2. The actual fretboard.<br>  Usually takes up another half an inch. Plus the frets above it. <br>  <br>  Usually necks stay the same width because of many obvious reasons.<br>  The strings have to be a certain length apart or the sound will be rattled if the strings are hit with any force. Also, with normal string guages (keep in mind strings only get but so thin)_you need some kind of distance between strings in the nut to keep the strings in place, you cant make a thin nut because then you may run the risk of the nut wearing down between the strings(therefore two strings are using the same slot)<br>  I hope that made sense.

lmGx31vvaa	I thought it was because he was jealous!    He too grew up in a slum but made it big.  Who Wants To Be A Millionaire was his show (as he clearly states after Jamal is taken away for questioning) and he didn't like the fact that a boy, with the same background as him, was stealing his thunder.    I don't think he was worried about Jamal getting the money and 'robbing' the show.  He does say this as the reason he called the police, but it was just a line.  If he suspected Jamal beforehand surely he would have told the producers?  He waited until Jamal rejected his answer to phone them.  Coincidence?    That's what I thought anyway.|`|zEP2aRRzaa	He didn't want Jamal to win. He also believed that Jamal was cheating his way to getting the answer, so he gave him a fake answer to see if it would confuse Jamal. When it didn't, it only made the host more suspicious. He wasn't jealous, it's just a lot of money to give away and not exactly the right kind of publicity the show wants in India.

irSBrZiQaa	I could not agree more, I was on the edge of my seat yelling shoot that creep. Alan is such a twisted man and deserves much more then getting shot in my opinion. I was so happy when Phillip stepped aside and let Buzz hit Alan priceless. I agree with both Cheetah and Vikkip67 Phillip needs to lay low for awhile considering the town is in an up roar about his return. I truly hope that Phillip eventually makes Alan pay for what he has done to the family. <br>  <br>  I am so happy to see Phillip, I believe that was a step in the right direction, but it was also very sad to that Coop had to go. To be honest I wonder more about what Buzz is going to do, he is much more dangerous then Phillip at this point and rightfully so. It's only a matter of time before Alan has to step up and take responsibility for what he has done.|`|pI5EAAUcaa	Of course we all do. But you can only shoot that man so many times! Geez! He's been shot so many times over the years. <br>  And without him, there isn't any tough guys left! The Lewis's don't have any tough guys left without Harland. He use to go toe to to with Alan years and years ago. And it's kinda odd how Alan has it out to get the Coopers, because it use to be the Lewis's that he didn't like. What's with that? Is it because Harley first married Alan Michael and then Phillip and then Harley's sister Lucy married Alan Michael? Buzz and Alex had a thing for a while too. And now Coop and Beth just was the last straw? <br>  They need to give old Alan some better story lines though. He's not quite the tough guy he use to be.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I was so hoping he would shoot Alan, in a way.  No one deserves it more!  But Alan has to stay around to cause trouble.  <br>  <br>  Phillip coming back to GL has been a great stroke of genius!|`|U8aXa8xEaa	I agree with Cheetah.  Alan does have to stay around.  The show can't afford to lose it's best characters.  Lets face it.  We really do love to hate Alan.  Also Phillip really needs to play it smart right now.  He's still in trouble for trying to kidnap his kids years ago.  So he's gonna watch his P's and Q's for a while before he springs his trap for Alan.

qJ9o3iQnaa	I agree with the others.. You do need to see the first one before you go onto the second one.. There is alot of back-story and you'll probably be confused if you skip it. Also you will not get to know the characters.<br>  <br>  It's a good movie. :-)|`|A4b5VaFvaa	yeah u definately need to see the Fellowship of the Ring first u can watch the Two Towers if u want but u'll be confused as hell|`|AA12072871	First things first. Fellowship of the Rings sets the stage for the other two stories. Your local video store has it i stock or Netflix and Blockbuster online. Its too good a story to begin in the middle. Besides...there are some awesome moments in the first that simply should not be missed.<br>      The end of the first movie leads right into a sequence in the second movie...at the very beginning...that left the audience breathless...and shaking their heads in wonder.<br>  Do yourself the service...and wait until you have the first before you begin the trilogy. In fact...I now know what I am going to be watching this weekend....In HD.<br>  <br>  Frodo lives!!!|`|KEsf9ziJaa	how can u caome across all the thing from the middle u have to see from the beganning only then u can hav some know knowledge|`|btrMdy5Uaa	You need to watch the first one, if you've read the books you should be fine though|`|bECsJtvDaa	Ok u don't need to be asking this.<br>  Watch the fellowship of the ring first|`|0d8vPBMwaa	The first one is important but I barely understood any of it the 1st time I saw it and still went on to watch the second one and I was fine. I would recommend at least reading a synopsis of the 1st movie though. You can find a short one on imdb.com or a much more detailed one on wikipedia.com.

You are attractive.You are born with good health and a good head on your shoulders. You are intense with a strong desire to pursue your goals. You have a pure heart.
oVeGMNsLaa	Contact her and offer her money.    Alternatively, try to meet her at an adult expo and chat her up, befriend her, and take her out on a date.  Be respectful but make it clear you find her attractive and want to sleep with her (but never give off the impression that you think she's a sl*t who would do anybody, or that she should or "owes you").    Or you can try to star with her in a porn.
ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.    There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.    Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network.

AF2d1fXBaa	I haven't seen Grand Torino but the car from Starskey and Hutch is cool.|`|3xXIKcMOaa	I'm very picky about movies after I see them, debating if it was worth my money and time.  Gran Torino is Very Amazing.  I'm against pirating movies, but I'm thinking about doing it for Torino.    I've also never seen any Eastwood movies before this, and I feel like I have been missing out.  Keep in mind, this isn't a movie to watch with your parents. It's very... brutal.  Shows you life as it is, and how sick it can be.    There is no doubt in my mind I will be buying this movie when it comes out.|`|3f0c5451e1aad0942ddc6e354cb950dbaa	I had no idea how touching this movie would turn out to be. I can't remember the last time I walked out of a movie theater with such a heavy heart. Talk about gripping, it was as if all the air was sucked out of the room, viewers were stunned into silence.

UAHjJpC0aa	It's not about the guitar.....    you could hand Satriani a dozen different guitars,  and he's always going to sound like Satriani !    It's about talent, practice,   more talent, more practice  probably a few lessons from a teacher that likes Satriani as much as you,    oh, and more talent....    the sound is in his "hands"  not his guitar.    (Thought it DOES have to be set up properly to play easy,   straight neck, no buzzing etc)|`|7qt4aQGYaa	he has a specially designed humbucker pickup in the neck position of his guitar, so if you can wire one of those into your guitar: set the pu selector to neck, turn the treble to about 3-4 o'clock on youre amp, and the bass cranked to ten.    add a little distrotion a nd start the legatos    to the guy that's above me, he means the tone not the legatos themselves

He's also a spazz. When bad stuff happens he goes crazy like Kanye West singing Love Lock Down live.    I'm a free-spirit and overemotional. i hate being controlled more than anything. I'm not like my brother with girls. i commit, while he's a player. Forget about Gemini's, you should go for guys like me!     Become my fan please!!!!!!!!!!! :)|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	Gemini guys are wit, social, stubborn, with sense of humor but womanisers and they like to seek attention, They rarley have a stable relationship. They are clever, hardworker and they like communications  such as mobile, cars, sattelite...etc.    Pisces girls are romantic, sensitive and have a good heart so they can deal with Gemini Guy.    Search google for more info|`|XdMcYDgbaa	Well am a Gemini male....I used to know this pisces girl that I knew she liked me alot. We were very good friends. Only one thing wrong, we are just friends here, every time I looked at another girl she gave me that look like "how dare he do that when am with him". Also she hates it when I lie. Thats ok...but the thing is we Geminis lie so much just for the fun of it. Pisces might not find it fun. Also when we got closer she wanted to know everything I was doing, where I was and that stuff. That is a very restraining notion for gemini.    I think the relationship is going to be very short, thats my guess. Pisces might get too hurt.|`|1PdUecpYaa	i love geminis. they're so much fun to be with.  my suggestion is try not to take it too seriously. geminis like easy and simple things. keep your conversation light and nice. they like to have fun, joke around and trying new things. just enjoy being with him. take it easy as it comes... try not to be clingy or too demanding.|`|giEXhSTIaa	I'm a gemini guy going out with a pisces guy and things are great. :)|`|PhxA7E2caa	Hi there, I'm a Pisces girl, and six years ago I married a Gemini Guy - we're now divorced.  My advice - enjoy the moment, but don't give your heart.  Gemini's are stubborn and selfish, and true to their nature, they do have two personalities; the one they show you and the one that they really are.

C7oZRnitaa	I'm not sure how he does it all but alot of people would choose him because he is very good at making comedy out of everyday phases and daily conversation. He can turn any innocent sentence into comedy. He does this alot on Ponderland by viewing old and modern clips and pointing out the double entendre's.  Hope this helps!|`|z4slPzgSaa	There was also his talk show called "1 Leicester Square", and he had a national radio show before he resigned after the "scandal".

These are about right!|`|AA11110732	The preppie style was a polo shirt (in a pastel color) with the collar turned up, khaki or plaid pants and loafers. Sometimes a very expensive watch is also seen on a preppie. Also very important, a sweater tied around the shoulders.    The rocker style is the ripped jeans, converse high tops, t-shirt with the sleeves cut off and either a leather or denim jacket.    The nerd style usually either involves baggy jeans or khakis, bright colored shoes, either athletic or dress and a baggy collared shirt with pockets for their pocket protectors and assorted pens and pencils.    The jock style is very basic, tight blue jeans, white athletic shoes, t-shirt in a masculine color topped with a letterman jacket in the school color.    Other style distinctions vary with hairstyle and footwear. But back in the 80's it took so little to shock so you didn't see a lot of piercings or tattoos, just technicolor hair styled with mousse and make-up on men.

Then put the cd you want into your cd-rom, and click on import.  It will then import the cd into your itunes library.

xTioPxaVaa	Fender actually made a "Wayne's World" Strat in the early 90's.  I believe they were made in Mexico and sold in the Squire line.    In the movie Cassandra mentions that it's a '64 Strat.  When the movie came out, about $5000 was the going price for one of those if it was clean and all original.    Greetings from Austin,    Ken|`|7qt4aQGYaa	uhhh only one company makes a strat, at least a REAL strat, and that's Fender.|`|PF6yKkVDaa	I'm pretty sure, if you're talking about the strat that wayne visits every friday, it's a fender.
a1Ngi39Xaa	She and Jill do have some killer fights!!   They are both great actresses.    I liked it when she was married to Rex.    Always liked her talks with John Abbott because they grew up together.    She is a total class act!|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	When she had amnesia and worked as a "regular" person and was a waitress,,,  loved it  !|`|Hc82C7Lyaa	Lol, finding out that her and Jill were related.|`|30r4coInaa	I agree, every Jill & Mrs. C fight has always been a favorite since I was really really young.  It's always been the highlight of the show for me.  I know they are not mother and daughter in my heart of hearts, and I really hope they undo it.|`|LO3BMobRaa	Mine were she and Jill's fight's to, especially that time when after Jill walked out and Catherine wanted to get even with her. Catherine said, "Damn You Jill."|`|fQXlFhDoaa	I will have to say the day she found out Jill was her daughter. That was timeless, I remember that like it was yesterday.|`|yCsQifOOaa	My fave was when she wore veils to conceal her horribly scarred face!|`|874e9ed8d38f4753f6cca93e708cd95baa	Okay, this goes way back.  BTW, that veil storyline that someone else mentioned was Vanessa Prentiss, not Kay Chancellor.  She had plastic surgery onscreen about 25 years ago, but that's not it either.  Mine was when she had faked her own death and attended her own funeral!  And, a follow-up scene was when she revealed herself to actually being alive to her son Brock at her "graveside."  I kind-of don't follow the show much anymore, but I know there's some kind of storyline like that again (where they don't know if Kay is really alive or dead), but I guess the first time was so great, they wanted to do it again. LOL
4kuWOZowaa	Yes it should be time for Chloe's baby to be due...I think its gonna come the end of febuary or march...isnt billy warming up to the baby...thats gonna play out crazy since i heard him and lily gets married.|`|Xgn57WGfaa	I think in one episode of Young and Restless  she stated that the baby is due in June but this is a soap so I'm sure they will drag it on as long as they can.|`|AA11608168	I'm pretty sure her due date is in March.  She was prego in June, so it should be VERY soon!  Sooo very tired of this story dragging out..but they are setting up Lily and Billy's story at the moment...(it's a spoiler --Lily supposedly gets prego by Billy just as the truth comes out about Chloe's babies daddy)|`|b95adf9df97c91be72d1af840c313197aa	if realistically real time=soap time, when she had the sonogram and bribed th enurse, would put it at the last week of February, but a week or so ago, they said something to the effect she's only 7 months...maybe by Christmas|`|uD1S5dYtaa	She's due whenever the ratings season is.  Whenever sweeps is, that'll be the big day.|`|Mp9SaP1iaa	I am just waiting for when the truth comes out and blows in her face lol|`|oLFCs2mVaa	do you mean Nicole? haven't heard them say Chloe was pregnant|`|BLmyeLdTaa	Yes they are dragging that out way to long.  It seems like she is 10 months pregnant as long as they are taking. LOL.
BwHoLEHvaa	Noah said he remembered someone pulling him out of the icy water.  The ice cracked & Brad's body will probably be found there.|`|0G0UFJleaa	I read Brad was leaving the show. Maybe this is how.|`|VM9KZ0CVaa	Yes, I think so too...but then how could he pull Noah out and then drown himself...so maybe he died of exposure.|`|4kuWOZowaa	I think he died in the water or by the water...they looked in his car and he wasnt in there.|`|75zggy81aa	yeah i am sure he dies, considering he is supposed to be leaving the show early 2009 and this is the perfect heroic oppertunity|`|cce7d68825e6be23ab1dbad4e0df262faa	I think so but will they find the body or do they leave us thinking he fell in and leave a glove of his near by and say they can only find the body  till spring and maybe they will never find it ?? that way they can bring him back down the road|`|AA11608168	I'm torn really.  I've heard for several months now that he is supposed to take a bullet meant for Sharon.  Now he's missing after saving Noah.  I want to think Y&R would take him out with a bang, but not so sure anymore.  My hopes are that he is deliriously walking around and stumbles upon the cabin where Phyllis finds Sharon and Nick in each others arms and he saves Sharon, but more than likely he's in that pond since it is so cold out, i don't' see anyone living thru frigid temps like that.|`|oLFCs2mVaa	I think he is sitting in his car. Prob Nick and Sharon find him on their way home.|`|BLmyeLdTaa	I think he is in the water because I think the lake cracked after he pulled Noah out and he fell in.|`|d9c0f5c5286294dcbb5ab28de65e8c39aa	Sadly yes. But I am still hoping JT and Colleen get to him in time. I hope they don't find him dead. I am going to cry cry cry......

eX7An0AKaa	Sara left after she was kidnapped by the miniature killer. She said she just couldn't take doing that everyday.   Warrick was shot by sheriff Jeff McKeen. He was involved in some crimes, and thought Warrick would find him out so he killed him. They did catch him. :)|`|A03NJA26aa	Sara left CSI because she had to "bury her ghosts" she came back when Warrick died but then left again and joined this research team in the jungle. Warrick was killed by the undersheriff McKeen in the premiere because he figured out that McKeen was the mole in the lab who set warrick up and tried to frame him for murder. whew that was alot. Oh and yes Grissom is with Sara now.|`|3XohNsA9aa	Warick was murdered. I can't remember the guys name, but he shot him. Grissom found Warick and called for help. It was a pretty depressing episode.

AA11784502	Hello ;  "Fantastic Planet" ;  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_P...  "Synopsis  The film depicts a future in which human beings, known as "Oms" (a word play on the French-language word hommes, meaning men), have been brought by the giant Draags to the Draags' home planet, where they are kept as pets (with collars). The Draags are an alien race which is humanoid in shape but a hundred times larger than humans, with blue skin, fan-like earlobes and huge, protruding eyes. The Draags also live much longer than human beings  one Draag week equals a human year. Some Oms are domesticated as pets, but others run wild, and are periodically exterminated. The Draags' treatment of the Oms is ironically contrasted with their high level of technological and spiritual development."    =^,,^=

l9uGrfSYaa	FMA...........it's original and doesn't have a dreary, repetative storyline. Something's always happening.....<br>  <br>  As for Deathnote.................It wasn't for me. <br>  <br>  nya|`|eUVFsM09aa	They are both really really good but Death note is still much much better than FMA. ^-^|`|1ko8AnvTaa	I cant choose. Both are great and both are very different...|`|IZB8dfhZaa	FMA is the best.....|`|Z0DwJzmaaa	I think everyone else already said the differences so I being a fan of both would choose Fullmetal Alchemist, and just to note I never liked anime that much with the characters as children. Really surprised me. Death note as much as I like it is repetetive, they should have never extended the show but I love it. Fullmetal Alchemist surrounds whats right and wrong in life in general. Death Note though can sound convincing has many flaws in the investigation part that many people love about it so much. Mainly all I hear is a bunch of talking and sometimes their will be something that makes me go Ohhhhh. Plus he is what 16 or something I forget Idk maybe it's just me but I have a problem with every anime kid genius (Case Closed AHHHHHHH). I didn't include no spoilers and I hope my contribution helps :).|`|f456a981d29b822c5b34d993104fa366aa	I prefer DeathNote because it is shorter. It's only 37 Eps., and it had a great plot line. It was suspenseful and mysterious, and you would always want to watch the next one to see what happened next.<br>  <br>  But FMA is really long. It also has a great plot line, but sometimes it sort of slacks off. But in general, it's great if you like long anime. It also has another season coming out in April, so you have that to look forward to.<br>  <br>  So from those, I'd pick Death Note.|`|Jn8St19vaa	That's easy, Full Metal Alchemist!!!!!!!|`|QdjdC7Uzaa	Full Metal Alchemist! No doubt... XD|`|gGjCbVdLaa	while i enjoyed both, i think FullMetal Alchemist was the better of the two series|`|OdZ6Iyabaa	viva FMA!!!|`|eWcFJPg9aa	They r equally good.|`|Hiasgb75aa	FMA|`|X45rxI7gaa	Both are amazing but I root for Death Note <br>  <br>  FMA is good for taking a very fantasy oriented element, i.e alchemy and turn it into a drama. That's great<br>  <br>  Death Note takes a supernatural element and turns it into a detective story with a lot of realism and intelligence.<br>  <br>  Not even stupid American shows can do that.

LBAh1tPoaa	Considered by whom?<br>  <br>  In the early 1960's many people had many opinions about who was the best female singer and they are quite likely not to agree with your opinion.<br>  <br>  For instance, if you lived in England it might have been Lulu, Gladys Knight, or Diana Ross who was considered the "first lady of song".<br>  <br>  I would go for Diana Ross, although Aretha Franklin would have been a contender. I was only a kid then, but I can still remember them.<br>  <br>  My mother always regarded Helen Shapiro as the best female singer, as did much of Britain. She was so popular that the Beatles had their first major gig supporting her. That takes some beating.|`|xieiM0FRaa	Ella Fitzgerald!<br>  She was my idol in elementary school. :]<br>  <br>  "Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917 – June 15, 1996), also known as "Lady Ella" and the "First Lady of Song", is considered one of the most influential jazz vocalists of the 20th century."<br>  <br>  She won 14 actually, and she got her lifetime achievement award in 1966.<br>  <br>  "Over a recording career that lasted 59 years, she was the winner of 14 Grammy Awards"

Look out for comments from users though, because there could be viruses lurking around!     You want to find 'torrents' (which it what they call the tv show you want to download) that have lots of 'seeders' and fewer 'leechers'    I hope you find what you're looking for.    If you can't find it on those two sights then try googling "Dexter series 2 torrent" but again, watch out for viruses.    Alternatively - DVDs are getting very cheap on play.com, amazon.com and hmv.com

8vGq6cRTaa	At the Idol concerts you had to be lucky or know somebody to get into a Meet and Greet (room with a small number of people meeting Idols after a concert).  The other opportunities were early afternoon when the tour buses arrived, and after the concert outside where barricades would be set up and the Idols would come out to sign stuff.    However, for David's new tour, we have no idea. These are small venues, sometimes with no parking lot of their own and we don't even know if there will be signature opportunities or what they will be like. So you just have to try everything.  Get there really really early (hours early) and check if people are waiting anywhere around the building, or wait in line, and hope David comes out.  Ask people who work there is there will be a Meet and Greet or other signature opportunity. When you get into the place look for a table where David might be signing stuff (that happened at one Jingle Ball).  Get a spot near the stage and you can wave and hope to get your hand touched. Hopefully when it ends you will have more info about what post-concert opportunities there might be.      Also listen to and check the websites of all hit radio stations near the venue.  They might have a contest to meet David, either at the concert or at the radio station.

Yc9uPziVaa	er.. sawdust is a regular cd    not sure bout your first question
vsy4QMHMaa	It happens, especially with low-cost high-production bows. They often don't use high quality wood or the wood doesn't get a lot of inspection for defects. It's a good idea to have two bows in your case. For young violinists I could argue for two $40 bows rather than one $80 bow.     ... I'm still trying to figure out how my daughter managed to snap a fiberglass bow a few years back.|`|Rtzx1xKYaa	You probably could have had a tight bow and applied excessive pressure on the tip which got it to break. No problem, I think you can buy another one.|`|StXmmAeFaa	tightening it too much and/or using it too hard|`|5hIVsBx8aa	this could happen when u tighten it too much. my bow has done that too|`|UU4f7ZvDaa	tightening it too mutch humidity might have somehting to do with it...constant weather change, if youve only been playing for a month then just buy a crap bow. You won't be able to tell the difference for a while......

auFmP7J1aa	i am not gonna say that twilight sucks or space marine  sucks. i'll just answer your question    from what i read, the space marine people are basically just super soldiers.    i think that in this case edward would have the advantage  since he is bullet-proof and nothing could break his skin  except vampire teeth and werewolves.     plus he could read minds, and he uses that power to   see what his enemy is about to do.    as much i would not want him to win, i think he would   since all the soldiers can do to him is probably hurt,   but not destroy him.    :D|`|vqg6wpCLaa	Obviously Space Marine. Edward Cullen wouldn't stand a chance against any real superhero or supervillain. Down with that stupid clown!|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Space Marine because I'm tired of hearing about Twilight|`|TofmqjUaaa	Edward Cullen.. "everything about him invites you in." he is the deadlist predator and is basically invincible. Besides, he alone could beat space marine.

Vampires are the lamest of mythological creatures, writers lately have been hyping them up by always changing the myths around them to make them a tougher opponent.  A Space Marine might be super human, but from my experience with 40K they can still be killed. Even by an Eldar.    No bias on my part here, if you were to allow for some of the newer things writers have allowed to harm vampires. The Space Marine uses weapons that have been supposedly blessed by the Emperor of Humankind, they use them on demons all the time. Pro-tip a demon is a lot more powerful than some wimpy looking vamp. To a Space Marine he has faith in the Emperor and in his weapon, that makes his weapon much like the vamp's bane the cross as long as you have faith in it.    The Space Marine wins, only to be killed by a Predator later.|`|BLrNJgbnaa	Goku come in and blow dem up.

Even abbreviations will work too (MMM stands for Megan's Media Masterpiece).You can even incorporate the name of the web site you are using. Using nicknames can be fun also. Creativity is key to any good titles.   Here are a few I came up with;   -Lexi and Emily Productions presents  -Em & L show  -In the life of Emily and Lexi    Hope this helps :)|`|5fda267b038e1e4d608383fb4793d967aa	JKJKJKLOLOL|`|ixOE0onnaa	adunce devlayer.

I don't know. Maybe blink 182 will get back together and if they do i look forward to seeing what they put out. But they've all grown as musicians and their music will probably have changed drastically, and become more mellow judging by the other bands they're in.    EDIT: And wikipedia is a good source to see what's happening with bands and their future album plans.

No, just because it's older than 'about 30 years' does not mean it's free. Check out the Harry Fox agency for musical licensing at harryfox.com    Sorry. But, legally you have a whole boatload of paperwork to do.

Not to mention the boss, Michael Scott, who is more interested in being your friend than your boss but is really childish but a good guy.

fIK9LBEuaa	I saw Jon and Kate at a speaking even in Novi, Michigan last May; where many people asked them questions.     One question that kept coming up was, "Where are the grandparents?". Their answer was one that was consistent throughout the show. Some grandparents are more involved in the kids lives then others. They still see their grandparents, however now it's just that they've grown apart more. That was Kate's parents    As for Jon's parents, his dad passed away as was stated in the book. And his mother and brother are still very much involved in the kids lives, but they have no desire to appear on camera.     Jon and Kate stated that they are grateful for their parents, but they are closer with their friends and other family (like Beth, Jodi and Kevin [Kate's brother]) then with their parents. That's why they stay at Jodi and Kevin's and Beth's house rather then their parents.    Really, if you were to find out the number of people that are in the same situation as Jon and Kate in regards to their parents, there would be a lot.     The true and basic answer is that they just aren't as close to their kids as some people.|`|lOp2gVxJaa	Maybe they just didn't want to be on the show or they passed away.|`|j7l9gavRaa	that is a good question, like on the show the kids always go to other fmaily members or friends houses but never any grandparents even jon's. idk why?|`|uYKMJDG2aa	I LOVE that show!!! Maybe their parents are involved, but their help just isn't put into the show.  I don't think they show everthing that happens in their daily lives.|`|UMWhfHB9aa	Technically, she is involved, i guess she isn't involved as much as John is. I think she is more into the producing of it, she goes to talk to directors and stuff to see what they will film. Even though its suppose to be real, its not as real as it seems.     Plus, if you think about it, the show has to end soon anyways since the kids are getting older, and there is nothing you can film about anymore.|`|fHEt1Xj6aa	their parents are probably embarrassed that they cash in the dough on their children to be famous|`|EQm2iCpaaa	They're scared she might ask them to babysit.|`|yB5go5wbaa	Kate said that they chose not to be involved in their lives and the show.|`|BLrNJgbnaa	Because the b.tch spawned 8 children. I'd high tail it out of there too.|`|822da6b7b24693d516953606bfb56517aa	they probably just dont show it on the show|`|A1YlBTkDaa	maybe they died or they just probably dont show them on it anymore
ZODunuGWaa	That ear coast west coast **** i thought was a waste of time but i would have to say Biggie because he is a legend and he did not deserve to die because he didn't do any harm to Tupac but Tupac thought that he did but at he time Tupac didn't know who to believe when he got shot and Biggie (my big ****) thought that he could let time go and then fix everything but then it was to late and then at that time Biggie was blown and away and he really thought that if he were to die then it would be good because he wouldn't have to deal with the crappy life he had. But when he was in the car and there was a drive by shooting and he got shot i know it just know it that he didn't feel it because he was gone not even in a second.   This is from his Bigraphy...                                                 Life:  Christopher George Latore Wallace (May 21, 1972 - March 9, 1997), also known as Biggie Smalls (after a stylish gangster in 1975's Let's Do it Again) and Frank White (from the film King of New York), but best known as The Notorious B.I.G. (Business Instead of Game and, since his death, Books Instead of Guns), was a popular rapper of the mid-1990s. He was born in Brooklyn, New York.    His career was overshadowed by the Bad Boy/Death Row Records feud during his life, but following his untimely death in 1997, The Notorious B.I.G. has been celebrated as a hip hop legend. He is remembered for his storytelling ability, talented freestyling ability, and his easy to understand yet complex flow. He is widely regarded as being one of the, if not, the best rapper of all time.      Childhood and drug career:    The 6'3", 300 pound (136 kg) rapper, was raised in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York City. B.I.G.'s Jamaican-born mother Voletta Wallace, a preschool teacher, claimed that Christopher lived a comfortable life. He would later profess otherwise on songs such as "Juicy". As an honor-roll student, he dropped out of school at 17 to work as a small-time crack cocaine dealer in his hometown. He would later traffic the drug into Virginia where it could be sold at a higher price. Even as a drug dealer, young Wallace was known for his charisma. He rapped as a hobby and was soon discovered by DJ Mister Cee (Big Daddy Kane's former DJ), with whom he released his demo tape.      Rap career:    The demo tape made by Biggie and Mister Cee found its way into the hands of then Uptown Records employee Sean "Puffy" Combs, who fell in love with the rapper and quickly arranged for a meeting with Biggie and Mister Cee. Combs and Wallace became instant friends, and their first appearance together was on the 1992 reggae song "Dolly My Baby" by Supercat.    Biggie first gained notice with "Party and Bullshit," his first single. His second mainstream appearance was on the remix to Mary J. Blige's smash hit "Real Love". He appeared on "One Million Strong" on a song called "RUNNIN'" with 2Pac & Dramacydal. He also made an appearance on a Trapp album called "Stop The Gunfight" on a track called "Be The Realist" with 2Pac & Trapp. This album also contained a remix of "RUNNIN'" called "Stop The Gunfight". All of these guest appearces built a sizeable buzz around Biggie's name leading up to his solo debut.    In 1994 he released "Juicy", his second (yet first mainstream) single. He also released Ready to Die, his debut album. Ready to Die is regarded as one of hip-hop's all-time classic albums, and is credited with revitalizing East Coast hip hop. The album features one of rap's most famous "playa anthems", the song "Big Poppa", which samples R&B singers, the Isley Brothers. On the track "Everyday Struggle", Biggie's album drew critical acclaim for its vivid story-telling and razor-sharp lyricism, such as "They don't know about the stress filled day/Baby on the way, mad bills to pay/That's why you drink Tanqueray/So you can reminisce and wish/You wasn't living so devilish." Another standout track is "Warning," wherein Biggie once again displays his story-telling ability. The album is considered by many to be one of the best and most hardcore hip-hop albums of all time.    In 1995, Biggie's clique Junior M.A.F.I.A. (Junior Masters At Finding Intelligent Attitudes) released the album Conspiracy. That same year saw Biggie introduce to the mainstream his crewmates Lil' Kim and Lil' Caesar. That same year, B.I.G.'s single "One More Chance" debuted at  5 on the Pop Charts, at the time, tying Scream/Childhood by Michael Jackson as the highest debut single in music history, although this record has since been surpased by Michael Jackson's You Are Not Alone which debuted at number one. "One More Chance," which sampled the R&B song "Stay With Me," was a remix of the song by the same name that originally appeared on Ready to Die. "One More Chance" was also Biggie's highest selling single, as the single alone was certified Platinum.    By the end of 1995, The Notorious B.I.G. had become one of the most famous and popular rappers in the world. He was na|`|u2ZKtLY0aa	Tupac, he got shot first. lmaoo  just kidding.  Biggie |`|f4ehvRQlaa	both!  Biggie my niggie and Tupac!  :]]|`|aAj4dSyuaa	I love them both but, I'm going to have to go with Tupac. I don't really see all that crap about East Coast and West Coast. I always say "If the music is good, bring it to me."|`|AA10368887	I have no preference for either of them. I see most rappers as vulgar thugs who do nothing but inspire violence and ruin the image of African Americans. Hopefully, with Obama in office, people will look to him as a role model instead of looking up to worthless vulgar ghetto thug rappers.    The whole East Coast/West Coast feud is nothing but a way for these thugs to continue their violent gang-like behavior.
OxGTMuzAaa	seether has a lot of stuff like that. breakdown for instance. idk, seether, staind, three days grace, all kinda have the same meaning. if ya need more ideas just hit me up with an email|`|Yy6GIHCuaa	well, i suppose you might also like last resort by papa roach or behind closed doors by rise against. i love all three!

L67GTLROaa	If it's an established place where they have their own car wash building with car wash machine type thing... about $10 per hour with tips being dispersed amongst everyone.    If it's a mom & pop shop in a tent near some gas station, it would depend where you live... probably about $8-10 per hour. If they pay you the lower of the two, they may say you make up for the rest in tips.
4ZaAZgCgaa	Alcohol is way worse for you than weed.  You can't die from smoking too much weed but you can die from too much alcohol.  I've been smoking since I was 12, about once a week.  I am now 34 and have been a high school math teacher for eight years|`|fOc6PB2Oaa	Cannabis users are losers.  FACT!|`|7fe2e12eefd613a85a2294cb674aea83aa	NO!  It leads to being a lazy slob...that smells|`|AA12201622	only if it is laced with something like pcp     I have not smoked a joint since 1993 I always got mellowed out|`|mggll8dRaa	Weed, emotional Issues;  Alcohol, Physical issues...!!|`|wmBK9uASaa	Generally only in those who have already shown signs of instability prior to use|`|FZKFLTyLaa	Only in rare cases.  My brother who has used pot longer than I  (I quit 3 years ago to  due the lethargy and short-term memory loss, and am cured of those) has a clear social withdrawal as a result of his daily use.  He shuns his family for no good cause and nearly had to be coerced to come out to our Grandmother's funeral.  Alcohol, when abused, is clearly the greater evil.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	well i know people who are crazy that smoke but they do many other drugs too and from somebody who has done way too many drugs in my day weed has never caused a psychotic episode     and liquor is way worse|`|GO7tZtPxaa	Weed is sooooo bad for you psychologically!!!!! It is far worse for you than alcohol.. It is linked to all kind of mental illness.     I worked for a year in a psychiatric hospital and so many people were in there from abusing cannabis. Anything ANYTHING that changes the chemicals in your brain is going to have a detrimental effect long term!!|`|na8ObA5Haa	Weed. just cause its boring hahaha you smoke it, get high, which makes you paranoid, then you fall asleep. its a pointless drug!|`|GKJEgidzaa	Hey, you are pretty wrong about alcohol causing more problems.  Cannabis affects people differently, some people are fine with it. Others are not.  My older brother smoked all the time for a about 5 - 6 years. It made him paranoid, he used to freak out all the time and his temper was so short, He used to hit my mum and older sister etc. It was horrible, it destroyed our family. It also made him severely depressed. He would stay up all night smoking and steal money to get his weed, then he would sleep all day and miss school.  It annoys me when people say there is nothing wrong with it, obviously there is. It just depends on the person.      EDIT: I also have friend who after about 3 years of smoking it, became severely paranoid. She used to throw total ragers all the time and throw everyone out of her house because she felt suffocated. She can't be in confined spaces etc. She has stopped smoking it, but she has a really messed up face and she looks so dazed all the time. She says its the biggest regret shes ever had.      People can't thumbs down me? For sharing my experience with this topic... What I have said is factual.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	I have smoked it once , and let me tell you it's a filthy drug , unless you do have genuine medical reasons stay clear from it ,  it does not make you more relaxed , and it's like any other drug     FQ non , I have never drunk achol and I will never smoke it again|`|LQ6nBJkGaa	alcohol is worse.  weed does not make you angry or pyschotic at all. it makes you relaxes XD|`|5XyBxxYAaa	Alcohol is not good for you if it is abused but weed definitely causes mental health problems.  I would far rather have a drink than I would touch that stuff.|`|NgvqeoHmaa	I have always believed that alcohol is far worse than smoking pot. I think you will do more un-you-like things when you are drunk than you will do when you are high!! The fact that is illegal and alcohol isn't baffles me...and then they still sell cigarettes...i mean be consistant!

FtBqmFDEaa	I am not, its an overhyped waste of money day. The whole point of Valentines day used to be that you sena a token card to your lover or the person you admired and you didn't sign it so they never really knew who it was from. These days people send them to all and sundry.  There is probably one entitled "To my ex-husband on Valentines Day"    If everyone donated the money spent to charity instead the world would be a better place. Think of all the trees that are cut down to make valentines cards.     Pay 5 Euro to buy a piece of fancy cardboard and give it to the person I live with. No thanks.|`|n43DN6Duaa	You must be very lonely if not :)|`|b5ppFsn2aa	well, i just broke up with my boyfriend, soo im not seeing that happen lol. hopefully going out with the girls though :)|`|JERUmEFzaa	My friend won`t|`|IC07KEd8aa	I'm not.

But he'll always be 'Jack' in "Newsies" to me.  : )|`|Oh3yVRQzaa	All of this is opinion based on preference and regardless of what I say - or what someone else says doesn't make someone right or wrong     Personally, I think these questions based on preference really don't establish anything.     Do you even know Christian Bale to know that he plays his life in every movie he does? Obviously not. Christian Bale is an excellent actor (just because he flipped out doesn't take away from his ability and I think this is what this post is really about)     If it weren't for his roles as a child to help him refine his skill and all of the unique films he's done since - he wouldn't be in Hollywood.|`|XOtN0mzNaa	I guess you didn't see The Machinist.

411e33cff378a28929963f21b85453abaa	I agree that they are whores.They have no respect for themselves,if they decide to spread their legs!   I had sex when I was 15,and got pregnant.I was lucky that my mom thought enough of me to take me to Planned parenthood,where I found out i was pregnant.I wanted the baby, but knew that I was nowhere near ready to be a mom.       My mom knew this. I aborted the baby and knew about sex ed.  Alot of girls get laid because of boredom,or the real reason they get laid: THEY ARE HORNY!   IF they are gonna spread their legs, at least protect themselves.  Ignorace is no excuse.  Cover the lover,i always say!|`|5d35f02795f13416394a1ca500f68647aa	Ha! Yeah, I think some people confuse Yahoo Answers with a HPT.  It scares me to think that they might actually end up with a kid X_X|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Yes, especially with birth control so readily accessible.    Argh.|`|aCCUQQu4aa	amen sister...singing to the choir...OMG I think they're whores|`|muX5G72Vaa	Just ignore them and move on.    That's what I've been doing since I first came to YA.|`|PFBKuVhBaa	oh my god someone who knows what goes through my head when i fall upon those questions!  thank god.  these girls need to stop being so loose in the caboose  haha|`|AA11530601	yeah its been that way for yrs, I have been on here since 2006. You get used to it. I have no idea why they cant just get themselves down the family planning clinic and get the morning after pill instead of asking ppl online. But then maybe they live in the country or somewhere there isnt one thats open - many are only open for a few hrs a week. I am lucky cause I live in a big city and there a loads of them, but if I lived in York for example, these services are grossly inadequate and underfunded. They may have sex on sat and have to wait until next fri to see a doctor. So im glad that I can help them but I really think they should have just used a condom - I was a teen slut too but yknow what? I always insisted on proper protection so I know it can be done. If you arent willing to use it, then ur still a kid who cant take responsibility for their actions and shouldnt be having sex.|`|3EyK4x2Naa	That or maybe their PARENTS didn't educate them about preventing pregnancy, or safe sex, or maybe they weren't educated properly at school, I know I wasn't. I'm lucky my mother and I have such an open relationship where I would NEVER have to post a question like that on here.  Not saying it isn't commen sense to get a test done, but I think they're probably just uneducated.    EDIT To the above: Yes, you can get educated in school, but there has to be a parent's signiture for the child to have access to that education. Most likely parents who don't educate their kids theirselves will not sign off on it to be taught at school. I remember we had to get permission slips to attend sex ed classes and the kids who didn't have them went to a different classroom.|`|E5rhAaLGaa	LOL yeah!  How the hell are we supposed to know?!|`|N8998SBlaa	I'm scared cause they are breeding|`|btrMdy5Uaa	I agree, I was 19 when I found out I was pregnant, almost not a teen any more, but whatever, and all I did was go to the store and buy a test, I didn't ask anyone, I did it all by myself|`|HEQc83d9aa	lol,ok hun calm down...just scan through them its best to do that rather then get tied up in it! and yes it makes me wonder also.|`|j6y1sQuvaa	Yeah, why don't they just go out and buy a pregnancy test instead of wasting their time asking a load of people on the internet who have no clue whether they are pregnant or not!|`|IHa6FxE6aa	Yes. Yahoo Answers is not a pregnancy test.|`|QEEweJUaaa	Yes i am sick of these fools too.They should seek medical advice from there local GP,and stop bothering us with their silly nonsense.

FtBqmFDEaa	What is fun? Fun stops when you have children lol.  We go out about twice a year, we can't afford to go to the pub here in Ireland, my b/f has been out of work for months so we're a bit skint.  We could go out more often but I object to paying 2 Euro for a glass of lemonade.  We live 3 miles from the nearest town (pub) and drink driving isn't an option so its easier to stay in.     My b/f he's a good cook, he cooks most nights while I answer questions on Y!A . We enjoy a few glasses of wine every night, chill out time. Sometimes we have close friends over for dinner but usually a special occasion like a birthday or maybe a New Year's Eve party.|`|6fbce3ff42dd216a83c3e009ccebb0eeaa	Not often..i have lots of visitors..to me shed pub...|`|AA10723657	when ever i can|`|Hw5Rd45zaa	When my mom lets me out...|`|ec9cd1a19bba30708d858894d59d9cb2aa	4 days a week .|`|jfaP8waJaa	whenever i want to x|`|Rw99ll8Taa	im 37, i stay in and have fun now!!!|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Not as much as I should|`|kzkrll3Xaa	too often, i have too much fun, even at the supermarket :/ cant take me anywhere ;)|`|nTptyQObaa	Every weekend.|`|50UbJp14aa	not often, once in a while|`|zUFdTyqZaa	whenever i can|`|QEqGukjZaa	every full moon..|`|TZiySTOGaa	not as often as i;d like to....|`|NmSSKnnWaa	every weekend.:)|`|xEJm0NCiaa	every day, more on fridays and saturdays. :D|`|9cd51d4c661adc7fafd62eeb1902520aaa	i go maybe few weeknds a month maybe either way iam always the life of the party so iam fun most of the time|`|aMpMFLo3aa	not to much :(

MX0s76pzaa	Next time, ask your Twilight Qs In the "Movies" section instead. Why?  1. You will get more answers about It there than asking It here In the Comics and Animation section.  2.

WlEOO8Luaa	I wouldn't use 13th Warrior. Eaters of the Dead was Michael Crichton's book based off Beowulf. And they don't have similar plot lines. Characters, yes. But I wouldn't use it.    Use a movie where there is a hero. Hero is an underdog. Hero conquers. Hero must die.    Check into the Lord of the Rings or Narnia movies. Tolkien had a large fondness for Beowulf and used the same points in his stories.|`|WcUuH7i3aa	grendel .... it is like beowulf ( the movie ) but its all about grendel the evil monster thing hope you could use that :D|`|kFnzYrrnaa	Well I'd compare it to the movie "The Thirteenth Warrior'. Its the same story except done way better. It has Antonio Banderes in it and it'd be good to do because the two movies are based on the same story, that's kind of the point of comparing and contrasting, you can't just pick two random movies.|`|cdaf0CGxaa	Anything with Jane Fonda...Saigon Jane......Monster in Law...

Or they feel like if they get pregnant then the father will have to take care of them and pay for food and everythign they need, and it will solve their problems, when really it doesnt solve anything.|`|483832563e94bfe8ce04dbe4cdf218e5aa	sometimes itsused as a cry for attention...others are just raised that way...their surrounds have ALOT to do with their actions...they cant help it, they dont really know better...they want some form of love and alot of them think the only way to fill that void is by having a baby...its sad..|`|rw2TcmGIaa	Schools in poor areas don't get as much government funding as others therefore the quality of teaching is worse compared to that of a more affluent area.

(Abortion, adoption, etc.)|`|sxRPXvVnaa	Because poor kids feel they have no good future and that lessens their self-esteem.  To boost their self-esteem, the boys have sex because of the sense of power it gives them, and the girls get an esteem boost by being chosen by the boys.  However, poorer kids don't generally protect themselves from pregancy because the boys feel that would take away from their sense of power, and the girls feel they have to do whatever the boys want in order to remain the object of their desires.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	No clue -- both have access to birth control.  and both have self-control.  or should have...|`|kR6hptDvaa	I think because the low income families is also poor at knowledge so they have less attention to study but middle class/wealthy families is also high at knowledge and have more attention to study,so the wait longer to marry.

XhRLCFz8aa	OH MY.  Damn, hahahaha. That was very disturbing.  And sadly reminded me of many of my friends.
nDSLNnguaa	I'm a VERY vivid dreamer so I guess I would say almost every one I have!  That's my favorite part about the day- going to sleep and seeing what's thrown at me!  I guess the ones where I'm flying- or maybe where I'm trying to REASON with someone who is trying to kill me.  I don't know, like I said there's sooooooooooooooooo many!    Edit: Whoa, underneath me- I am giving a thumbs up-if that was a real dream WOW if you made it up WOW!    Ok, I will get personal and actually answer your question- and for the record I am happily married- to a man- but the weirdest dream I guess I have every had (and maybe it's not so weird but it's not something my friends and I discuss so I dont know) is being with another woman (THAT way) it was extremely graphic and sensory.  I will go into no other details. There!    Edit:Oops I wrote "every had"!  Do you think that was a Freudian slip because I have it every night? Just kidding.  I guess I'm glad you thought it was hot rather than just plain weird - which is what I think.  I do wonder whether there are any other straight women who have had dreams like that.    Edit: Below me, Thanks that makes me feel better!|`|HQqM89Kuaa	The Other Night I Dreamt I Got Sent Away To An Asylum (In The 1800's) And The Owner Of It Was Hitler. I Don't Know Exactly What I Did To Get Sent There But It Was Horrifying.. Everything Seemed To Be Made Of Rust And They Put Me In This Dark Chamber During The Day Then Let Me Out At Night To Help The Cook Make The Meals For The Other Inmates. One Night While I Was Cleaning Up Hitler Came Up To Me And Asked Me To Take A Walk With Him So We Went Outside And Walked Around The Court Yard(It Was Night Time And Lightly Snowing). Then My Mother, One Of My Sisters And Boyfriend Came Up The Drive And We All Went Back Inside. Hitler Left Us To Visit.... A Few Days Later My Sister Came By Again With A Bag Containing Wrapped Xmas Presents From My Boyfriend. She Said He Wouldn't Come To See Me Any Longer But He Would Still Send Gifts So That I Would Know He Hadn't Forgotten Me... Back In My Chamber/Cage I Sat Alone With A Few Rats Running About, Watching A Small Black And White Television Set (Even Though It Was The 1800's) Then Some Nurse-Men Came In To Inject Me. I Started Fighting And Screaming But They Were Strong And Emotionless. They Rolled In A White Gurney And Laid Me Down To Medicate Me And Conduct A Few Tests.... The Next Morning I Woke On The Floor Of My Cell And Started To Cry. I Cried Until It Was Time To Help The Cafeteria Ladies.. Then I Told One Of Them How Much I Wanted To Go Home And How Much I Disliked It Here. They Told Me That I Had Been Very Good And They Suggested That I Ask Hitler If I Could Leave.. Since He Was In Charge. They Let Me Off Work Early To Go Talk With Him. I Found Him In His Fancy Bathroom. I Pleaded With Him To Let Me Out Earlier Than What The Doctor Had Sentenced Me To. Hitler Looked At Me Then Said That Loved Me, He Had From The Moment I Arrived. Then He Ordered Me To Say It Back To Him... So I Did Blandly. He Told Me He Would Let Me Go In A Week Or Two If I Would Tend To All Of His Sexual Desires. I Hesitated A Long While, About To Cry... Then He Said Or He Could Arrange That I Stay Here, At The Asylum Longer. So I Gave In. We Walked Into His Bedroom Where The Moon Shone Through The Large Windows And Then We Got Into His Bed. He Started Kissing And Fondling Me While I Lay Like A Stone. He Undressed    And Then I Woke Up.  It Was Scary>      Edit: Naw, I Didn't Make That Up. I Promise.  ^  l  l  l (Answer Above)Oooo I've Had One Of Those Dreams Before >.O|`|h84uIkZOaa	there was a huge earthquake at school and the buildings collapse and i ran to the soccer field only to find a milk fish and the milk fish was under a pile of chicken barbeques and he was dying from the weight so he shouted at me "i'm make you stinkin' rich!!" and he turned into a Snickers chocolate bar|`|KrqGoxoUaa	mine is my 2 bff's rachel and zach fell in love and they both live in my subdivision and i called rachel one day and im like what are you doing do u wanna hang out?? and shes like cant and im like y and shes like im goin to zachs for a bonfire and then im like ohhhh im comin and shes likeNOOO!!  and im like y not?? and shes like just us we are guna have fun alone by ourselves and now it is hard to see them talking in the halls it is so weird!!!!!|`|jiOohUa0aa	A lion came to my house, opened its mouth, and said I've won the lottery.|`|NqxDBO2Xaa	i dreamt i was answering a very strange looking americans question ..|`|gIitANOkaa	kissing a guy...     it's weird because I could feel saliva on my cheeks and stuffs... but when I woke up i have saliva.|`|uFk8ohenaa	falling in space|`|145f9a95b73fc930d5481d771b203c24aa	with a female ghost.. she keeps comming but do not permit me to do anything.|`|vpoP8ksHaa	Brian Johnson (lead singer from AC/DC) was lying on the grass beside this pool, and he was covered in dried blood.  and i leant over and kissed him, and it was such a simple kiss but it felt so real it was insane. and i remember the taste of blood, but it was nice somehow?   then he smiled.    god it was wonderful, but it felt so surreal. the feeling i got from it is what made it so weird.|`|BGKIJeTGaa	My friend killed another friend while we were making square crinkles.

But lets see.   I was at school and we had a 'bomb threat' (which we get a lot), and we all were evacuated outside. When we got outside we sat in the bleachers that were really far away from our school. Turns out, there wasn't a bomb threat at all, there were zombies and out school got invaded. When we were outside though, zombies from the school started to appear, so we had to run back into the school (which was hard because they were rage zombies. They're basically zombies that run). Anyways though, we had to run back into the school and when we got in there we were all broke up into groups and we had to hide in the gym, and the cafeteria. I can't really remember the rest, but I survived which was pretty cool.  Sorry it was long and weird.|`|893832c7daec19ecb587baef8e03a807aa	I had a dream about my dead parents once and they told me that being dead isn't all bad because you can trade heads and with that they did just that and walked away laughing...

lkNJNnlSaa	The lad is abit psychotic if he sent you this. Stay away from him.|`|q5Ie2j8Aaa	this song is about an abusive relationship.    specifically (and it's a little self righteous), he is claiming that he loved someone who was self-destructive.    he gets frustrated that he cannot "help" (really meaning change or fix) the girl (or maybe it's a boy i don't know much about papa roach's sexual preference), so he gets frustrated and gives up.    the message being: you can't "help" someone who doesn't want to be helped, and that it hurt him to try, but that he doesn't regret it, because pain and growth is a part of life.    it is impossible to know how this relates to your situation, because often, people "cherry-pick" individual lines from songs and create a meaning unique to them or their situation regardless of how it fits into the song's overall context.    i would guess that it's the aggressive "go fix yourself" line, and that your friend is as self righteous as the singer of papa roach.    it then poses the question, how can you hate me for being the person you love, and if you want to change me, then do you really love me?|`|Eao3xObzaa	I haven't listerned to it and I'm not going to because Papa Roach suck balls but I would guess it's about scars.

He "cared too much" about this person only to be hurt. Now she is comming around trying to get help from him. He sees that she is falling out but he doesn't really want to help because of what happened. He also doesn't want to be with anyone else "Drunk and I'm feeling down and I want to be alone" but mainly doesn't want to be with the ex.
