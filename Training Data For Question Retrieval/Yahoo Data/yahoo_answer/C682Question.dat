20060621021755AAOWFdT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is my boss being a jackass?	My boss is only 3 years older than me, but he's constantly joking about how young I am and how short I am. I'll answer questions when people ask and such, but the other day he called me antisocial and is constantly telling me to smile even when we're not dealing with the public. When I don't smile he basically laughs it off. When I walk by, I hear him mention my name, and he'll also throw things at me saying I better be on guard. A couple days ago, I shared the same shift as my friend. He seemed extremely surprised that I was actually instigating conversations and such. I was in a good/hyper mood that day and somone threw one of those spongey balls at me, so I took it and soaked my boss, and yet again I surprised him. I think he likes me, but then, again I suck at reading people. Anybody else have a boss like this?

He's has always been friendly with this one girl, but I know for a fact he just likes her as a friend.  But he hadn't been teasing with her for a long time.  He does like to tease.  Today I was asking her a question and he went by and he actually interupted me talking to her to say something to her and then laughed a lot.  Then walked off.  Do you think he did this to get to me?  Maybe I just want it to be that.  But interupting me, he knew I would be observing this.

The next night, I had plans with my family so we couldn't go out. I went to bed that evening and woke up in the middle of the night from a dream where I had been surrounded by dozens of roses. Even after I woke up, I could still smell roses. I laid there for while and couldn't believe how realistic the smell was. I finally got out of bed and went to look out the window and found a dozen roses on my windowsill. He had come over while I was gone and left the roses for me. I will never forget that. What a great way to wake up!!
20060701120240AArNy4a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am interested in this guy who is a friend,when he is nice to everyone.......any clues............need help!!	I meet this guy in the fall once for coffee and we have talked on the computer alot since. We have established a friendship and seem to have alot in common. Due to circumstances for myself I am not able to date right at this time. I had a very important event happen and he offered his help no strings attached. He and myself went away for a night as he helped me in the moving of a busniess, just the two of us. He worked so hard and all he asked for was me to buy his food and accomidations for the 2 day trip, and I did. He was such a gentlemen, and never made me feel uncomfortable? In fact, I felt more comfortable with him then most people. We shared a room , but seperate beds as I wanted him to respect me, and I want more then a sex thing!. He opened doors for me and would go get our vechile to pick me up at the door of the places we ate. We had a great time. How do you know if a guy is just a gentlemen to all ladies, or if he may have alittle interest in me when our friendship is new?

20060704131732AAvS20D	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it impossible to have just friends?	Ok, here's the scoop- I've got a friend that's a girl, who's dating a guy(also a friend of mine). I have no romantic interest in the girl, I've known the two of them for the same length of time, and recently the two of them are having issues, and now I'm stuck in the middle. NOW, why am I being blamed for whatever issues the two of them are having if all I've done to date is listen to the girls problems and offered advice to both of them- The guy seems to think that since the girl is even talking to me we're doing something.

I have been depressed almost everyday for the last three years.  My wife of seven years is not here for me emotionally, physically or sexually, not like it should be. We split up for a year and a half and reconciled a year in a half ago. She was 33 started "dating" a guy she worked with after just one week. He was only 27. He got what he wanted and broke it off after just a few weeks. Two months later she moved in with another guy. He left her for somebody else after getting his bills payed for a year. The credit was ruined, car repossed and all. Shortly there after she decided it was time to reconcile and moved to Florida with me.The first year she went back home several times and "seen" the first guy and even "seen" him once down here. I found out called him and told him that if it didn't end that I will come see him :- ) I love her and our five year old son very much, but I am now 44 and need a wife that is true and will be here for me. Lady T says she will be... lol..

Then my friends told him i liked me,   he told the school and broke my heart again   Then, I realized something,   i didn't like him--i loved him.   i felt like i needed to "save/change" him   I sent him a deep email and...   he fowarded it to everyone in the grade   He broke my heart again   Now he is chasing after a barbie doll girl who doesn't like him back.

And I focus on my priorities, and it took me a while but I realise that I really only have two real friends. People think that I'm acting weird, should I stop acting the way I'm acting now?

20060813130012AArTyuF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is it when the one that hurts us can be happy with out remorse?	I was married 14 byears,  I thought all was good.  I was 38 she was 27 when she asked to have my baby.  I knew I didn't want anymore children.  But I gave in.  Now we have a beautiful 10yr old daughter.  Well my wife hd an affair.  They are not together.  but she says she is happy and gotten on with life.  While I am stuck wondering why did she do it.  I will never understand why she wanted she thought she needed an affair.  I thought that a marriage was forever and you woulfd work any issues in a marrage out that would benefit the family as a unit.  If she wasn't happy. then why didn't she make it clear.   I am struggling with all this.  Has anyone else been through anything like this?.  I think the root was her co-dependency on her MOMMY.  Who crries allot of guilt because my ex was sexually abused by her grandfather.  What ever my ex asked them for , she always got. GRRRRRRRRR

He has been telling me that he wants to grow his hair long "like the guy from ACDC".  I think if that's what he wants than he is old enough to make that kind of decision.  My exhusband and his girlfriend have threatened to take him to get it cut.  He (my son) has a huge swirly on the front of his head and it stands up and since his hair has started to grow (it's like an inch long on top), the calic is growing out and finally starting to lay down.  He's had the same haircut since his very first one.  My ex's mother is the one that has always taken it upon herself to take him and cut his hair and it is driving her crazy that it is touching the top of his ear.  What do you think?

20060722214703AAayTAM	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Relationships when you have PTSD from a rape?	6 years ago I was violently raped.  For three years I was in and out of hospitals.  Since that time I was able to put my life back together in every respect but relationships.  I have a wonderful boyfriend of two years, who loves me more than anything and treats me like a princess.  We have talked about getting married, but before that can happen, I need to change the way I treat him.  I have a problem feeling close to him.  I also take out all my anger and frustration out on him... I'll go off and just start screaming and worst off, I don't even realize it.  I know part of the reason is because I'm subconciously pushing him away because I don't want to get hurt... but I don't want to do that.

20060728003250AA2HrkG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	People on myspace?	I recently started a myspace thing to talk to old friends and whatnot and i started getting emails from girls that LOOK attractive and seem ok to talk to. They say theyre average or athletic and whatnot. But when i agree to meet a few of them they are rediculousy fat!  I'm not talking a big chubby which is fine, but i'm talking 5'5" 170+lbs!  I think its bullsh*t. They seem to think you wont notice that they're twice the size they say they are.  My friend who just started one went to meet a girl and on a hunch i warned him and went with him. The girl must have been 190lbs in a tank top. He thanked me so much for saving his life because he turned ghost white when he saw her.  I understand that there are fat people, but why do they try to hide it and not mention it on their profile and get mad when you book it out of there for being disgusting looking?  I even say 'no fat chicks' on my profile and they STILL try to pull a fast one. Anyone have this happen?

He spends tons of time with mommy and daddy, and says that I don't love him when i dont want to go over there. If i dont agree with him I'm selfish.

I am 27 and my bfr. is 46, he also has three children from his previous marriage.   I lived with him for over a year, and this cohabiting situation is bothering me.   I don't want to marry him, I don't think he is right for me. However, the fact that he is not offering to commit is bothering me.    I would never push him into that, cuz it wouldn't worth nothing. He has to come to it by himself.    Anyway I just want to know his reasons but I can't ask him directly.   Any suggestions on my situation???

And that's true that I am more drown to responsible, level-headed older man , the total opposite of my ex husband.

20060901114005AAKU3I7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is my mother too negative?	I am 25. Mom is 49. Always had a great relationship. Recently, she has been so negative. Step-dad last his job, her mother died, her brothers are fighting with her, she hates her job, etc. I live 1.5 hrs away in a larger city than her with ideals not as her. She pushes her religions, theology, and "right" ways on me, my wife, my other family, even my friends. I have tried to talk to her, but she does not listen. I finally wrote her an email and told her I could no longer stand for it and I did not want her in my life being negative. Recently, I was in the hospital - she did not even come down to see me. Would call, and then ask for me to call her back so she did not have to pay the charges. She will not listen to me on the phone for rambling about her own problems and whining about life in general and how unhappy she is. She can't stand my friends or my sister in laws (they are a homosexual couple) and refers to them as "the lesbos". Am I wrong for telling her to go fly a kite?

I have one child and am with my child's father. You see, we met before I went to the other side of the world. When I got there, I found out I was pregnant and then returned to have the baby near my family and my partner's excited family. Now, almost three years later, I feel a nagging in my soul that is telling me we never had that much in common to begin with and are only together for the sake of our child. We get along great, and he loves me alot,  but "it"just doesn't seem there for me.  WHAT DO YOU THINK, O GREAT VOID?
20060923183322AAbI2ET	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Are arab men only sweet and nice, until they get a ring on your finger?	the reason i'm asking is because over this past summer i met an arab man or should i say boy. he's 19 and i'm 15. the guy totally took me by suprise by asking me to marry him. first i refused, i couldn't beleive my ears. he told me he loved me etc. i asked him if  he beleived in haveing more than one wife, he said no. "theres only one love for me" all while placeing my hand on his chest lol. then i brought up religion, he's muslim i'm christian. he said i could convert, i told him no. then he said he'd convert, i said fine. he asked me again would i marry him. i kinda sorta said yes when i let him slip the ring on my finger. i told him i wasn't legal yet. he said "will you wait for me then". i'm sure you know what means. i said yes, and asked him if he'd wait for me, he said yes.we said that when i was 18 we'd marry. i dont know what the hell i was thinking. since the summer i've thought about what our marraige would be and possibly telling him i cant.he's so serious its scary.

20060928220332AA8F2wb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Black Men, or better yet, ALL men..... What do you think about this interview done on Serena Williams???	THIS IS A MUST READ.       Subject: Serena Williams Interview      Ms. Williams we are all interested in your new boyfriend.    There is no new boyfriend . I stopped playing with boys when I stopped dating black guys. I have a new man in my life and yes, he's white.       So you prefer to date white men instead of black guys?       Let's be real. If you are a successful black female you only have two choices...date outside of your race or date other successful black females.       What do you mean by warped mentalities?       Well, where do I begin? Many of them were raised predominantly by women and had this feminine/bisexual complex. Where they wanted to be treated like a female sometimes. For example, I would have the money & they would have the sex. I would teach them things. You know, all the things a woman likes a man to do, I would end up doing for them.       ((there's more but it all cant fit in this window. but what are your thoughts?))

Every time we've been together on a date we've made love and he has stayed over (He has about an hour or so drive).  Last night I think I might have talked too much, I don't know.  I did drop the f-bomb a couple times, enough for him to mention, and I don't know I must have really talked about stuff that turned him off.  I asked hime if he ever wanted kids, and there are a few stupid things that I said.  I didn't mean it I don't know why I can be so dumb.     He left a 2 a.m. and we didn't make love.  It's just not our m.o..  He always stayed with me   We do have a big age difference, maybe last night I looked too old or someting.  God I am going crazy I wish I could just call him and ask.  What was it I did, or said.  Oh the age difference...he's 23 and I am 36.   Oh well I gues it's anyone guess.  Doubt I be hearing from him.  I shoudn't ask him what it was I did, right?  I mean would he even be truthful.

20061022193341AAoMj5J	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am in Japan for business, My fiance is home..hangs out with guy who admits wanting to date her.  What to do?	I was ok with her hanging out with him when I left.  I had e-mailed him and I thought I could really trust that he did not want to break her and I up.  We had some problems the first weekend I was here (I broke a promise, about going to the bar), I TRUELY only went and set at the Kareoke bar, I was TRUE to her.  I realize that I did break a promise, no matter why, it was a broke promise.  She has confided in him and he has now e-mailed me and said that he does love her and doesn't care about me or what I think.  That he is going to try to get her.  How do I work with the fact that obviously he is going to agree with her every thought about me...in order to make me look bad, that he knows she is in a vulnerable place because of missing me, and she believes he is only being himself?  He is using everthing against me, he is a guy.  I LOVE her more than anything...

I'm not into overly froo-froo stuff, and I don't need to use it, but I feel like I should take advantage of it, lol..      Extra note - We are doing a medieval themed wedding.  With Celtic influences and wildflowers...  Was thinking that we could potentially use them to put dried flowers/herbs/potpourri type stuff in... dunno.

20090227144056AA4zQws	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im stuck in this dilemma help?	Okay im in a really bad predicament. one of my friends gf is having her bday party at a bar and a bunch of friends are going. i said i was going. Now one of our friends who i am really attracted to didnt know about it and refuses to go now, so she asked me if i wanted to go on a date with her. Thing is she has alot of guy friends and is very flirtacious so i dont know if shes interested in me as a potential bf or just friends. She gives me signs that she wants more though but i dont know. If i go though i know im gonna get made fun of and make some people really upset if i dont attend this event. On the other hand if i dont go with my other friend who i am attracted to i feel like she will think i dont see her that way. To make matters worse i have an event the enxt morning of this night which requires my full attention and i know if i go to the bar i would drink and probably get home late. What would be the best thing to do

20070113091633AA7vFUc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Heightism 101?	really what underlies the fact that a lot of women don't date guys their height or inch or so shorter.      and if you only date tall guys does that mean that a short guy can't be attractive to you, at least physically?         shorter men are stronger lb for lb    short men make the best special forces and navy seals    A lot of bosses are short   Alexander the Great was 5'4"   Bruce Lee   Robert De Niro & Al Pacino    Would you not date any of them         I love hearing "personality is most important but I don't date anyone below 6' tall even though I'm 5'3"  hypocrits      I just hope that all stuck up women are midgits in their next life time.      Ps... I'm not short but stuck up people is a real pet peeve of mine.  I love asking these questions b/c it make people re-examine themselves and hopefully let them see what/who they are.

So awhile ago, he went to our store and I said something in a very shrinky voice, it was "Gear" I think and He repeated it and as I looked at him, He turned his back away from me. And I noticed that most of the time, I glance at him and he glances back. and then i'd look away. haha! i know, i'm crazy

20070114164741AAwuPmZ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is this a bad idea?	People tell me this is a bad idea and when I think about it i really can't understand why practically it is a bad idea. I'm halfway through my senior year of high school, have basically been friend-less for a year and a half, and I tried to make friends in the beginning of the year but I was too shy to make it work. So I told people I was giving up and they said it was a bad idea. Why? Five months and I'll be out of there, never see any of them again. I used to be obsessed with the idea of being friends and doing things with them but I can't even make myself want to anymore. I can't see myself really having any more fun than being by myself. It was all an ego thing too, I mean i really liked them, but primarily it was an ego thing. They used to like me but they don;t like me anymore because I'm so shy. So whats the point?

Don't worry, there is no "seven year itch" for either of us...I promise...so no nasty comments about me hiring a Hooker for my husband or anything like that.

Hope you all had a wonderful Christmas, and hope you'll have a grand New Year. This morning I took my mom and her dog to the vet to get checked out, no...just the dog got checked out not my mom. Anyway, As I was driving I noticed every time I took a curve or was a ways from the next car her facial expression  changed like she was about to die! Her hads came up to the dash! Now I only got that away with my ex wife who drove like a mad woman! But I drove the speed limit knowing how much my mom hates driving. It made me really nervous. My question to you is...Do you know or you are a nervous passenger when someone else is driving? If your driving does the passenger make you nervous with their responses? If your riding are you the passenger that makes the driver nervous??? If there is many of you that do this, you all need some sort of help because it really gets on my nerves!!!!

20090227142033AAy6rIi	Family & Relationships;Family	My stepdad has a weird religion, and thinks he can do what he wants to me? Could he get into trouble?	Okay so i have a stepdad thats been living with me, 15, my mom, and my little brother, 11. He comes from this weird religion where men can do what ever they want to women. I'm talking "what ever he wants"! He thinks its okay to touch me in ways he would touch my mother, and my mom doesn't even do anything. I'm not aloud to speak to my real father or any other male figure that does not live in my house. I had a male teacher, and he made me switch out of that class. Hes teaching my little brother that its okay to put your hands on women. And he claims that if i were to ever break any of his rules he has the right to just sell me to some other family who goes by his religion. He's just messed up or something, he came out wrong.      The thing that really gets me is the fact that my mom goes along with it. What is your perspective of my situation? Also if i were to go to someone about this, could my stepfather get in trouble, since this is his religion? Also how do i clear my internet history?      PS: I live in the USA. My stepdads from some foreign country, im not sure. Hes been living with us for like 4 months now. My mom knew him for about a year before they got married. I don't know what she saw in him.
20070106181450AAwYBa5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I tell my fiancee how jealous i am?	3 months ago I asked my fiancee for time apart. things were moving fast, marriage was coming, and I thought I needed to think alone. She was very upset, but I insisted and didnt see her for a month. I realized how much I loved and I asked her to take me back. At first she was still angry at me and she was dating someone else. She kept dating him for about 1 week. She eventually forgave me and we are engaged again. Recently I found out that she had sex with the other guy the night before she took me back. She says she wanted to experience him, but that she wanted to teach me a lesson and test my love. She also said wanted the guy was very sweet and she wanted to thank him. She told him she would go back to me, so the last night she admits they did it almost all night, three times. We have talked a lot, about how she was hurt, and I have expressed its ok to tell how she enjoyed the sex. we are back in love and my heart knows that, but I cannot stop my head from being jealous. advice

NOW...   I have a friend (male) who I know as he competes as well. He is also 27, never went to college, lives at home with his parents, drives an old DelSol, work as a Cage Cashier making 13/hour and was recently fired from his minimum wage job at GNC (the same job he had 6 years ago). He hasn't had a gf in 6 years and while he says this is due to him being into "bodybuilding" since girls don't like muscles I think they aren't into him because he is broke and living with momma... of course I would never say that to him. Today he sent me a text saying something is missing in his life and no girls will date him. Again, he thinks this is because all four women said he is "intimidating" but I think they are lying and it is due to his lifestyle.   What should I tell him? What can I do to help him?

20061215105857AAwV4Yp	Family & Relationships;Family	How can you show someone to look at a situation as "the glass is half full"?	our chauffer knocked the back of my dad's vehicle today into a post. unfortuantely my dad was in the car. my chauffer is an excellent driver and i know on a normal day he wouldn't be so careless but today he had an argument with one of the maids so i think he was a bit upset. anyway, my dad didn't scold him or anything but i know in his heart he blames him. and my dad doesn't just "blame" people- he goes to the extent of thinking that the person involved was careless because they don't CARE- which is SO not true. so i tried 2 explain 2 my dad dat he shud be thankful that a WORSE accident didn't happen n maybe this was the universe's way to prevent a worse thing from happening dat day. but NO, my dad does not believe in my "babble" and he believes that everything can be prevented by our control!!    how can i help him realised that he should not be so negative?

Last year this guy liked me but I wouldn't go out with him and he had many friends (very popular) he is a big jerk too and so he started coming up rumors about me...

20090227142651AAie4lf	Family & Relationships;Friends	Can my friend get away from  his house/adoptive parents?	My friend is 15 and its constantly getting in trouble with his parents for NOTHING. example: His parents wish to send him to military school for listening to System of a Down, wearing an Enjoi shirt ("Narcissistic Panda"), and for things such as washing his hands in the kitchen sink. Well actually they said "because he's always in trouble/grounded" but the stuff listed above is what he gets in trouble for. We live in South Carolina and I would like to know if there is anyway he could possibly get away from his parents to go live with another family? If not, or if there is a way but is very difficult, could a teacher's help and support help him escape? Please reply :]

20061128085028AANCrEa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would you ask someone to be your bf/gf if you don't love them?	So I just asked this question earlier " Before you ask someone to be your bf/gf do you tell them you love them first?" and most people said no. I just don't understand why you would call someone your bf/gf if you don't even love them? Why not keep dating until you're sure of your feelings? I've never told anyone I loved them coz I've never loved anyone and for me I have to love the person before getting into a relationship with them.

20061213152432AAsCtP4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I need to do so that my exgirlfriend and I can someday be friends.  I miss her and don't understand.	My ex and I broke up about a month ago and she told me at the break up and throughout this time that she wants to work on our friendship.  She broke up with me and I have been trying very hard to be her friend.  She told me there was still a very strong physical attraction (on her end) but she still wanted to talk, however not see each other.  (She wants to fool around and I want to have a relationship)  I have tried to email her once 3 weeks ago, we inadvertently met in person 2 weeks ago, and it was awkward but I though manageable.  She stated she wanted to grab coffee sometime and catch up but when I called her (a week ago); she did not return my call.  I sent her a Christmas card on Monday and she will get it today.  I did not say much in it only the generic happy holidays and signed it with "take care".  I just get the impression that she doesn't want to be my friend.  I asked if she needed more time and she "said" the contact was fine.  What am I missing and what should I do?

20061219170053AAyGGxu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband's ex-wife moved to another state with his 15 yr. old daughter. Over two years ago we started?	paying for her braces, we almost had them payed off and only 2 more months until she had them removed. Then she moved to another state with her mother when she started going to another Orthodontist. This Orthodontist said he didn't like the way the other had done her braces so he started all over with a big bill that we have to pay. Her mother signed the contract for the bill but my husband's lawyer said we have to pay it. Also since she moved out of state our insurance doesn't cover his daughter. Now we will be responsible for all medical bills. My question is has anyone been through this and what was the outcome. My husband didn't give his ex approval to move out of our state with his daughter.

20070123083233AAJCHVv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does anyone have this problem?	My husband has been with 4 women previously before me and I am soo jealous.  I know it's in the past and I shouldn't worry about it, but I still do.  I had never had sex with any guy before I was with him, so I guess that's why it bothers me so bad.  It doesn't effect our sex life, but there are times when we are fighting that I spit out something mean and evil about his past.  For instance, the other night we were arguing because he hasn't wanted to *** in me (i was off of bc) but I told him that it never mattered to him before b/c he did with other girls without a condom or with them on pills.  Please help!

20070318121706AAnUUaT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys question: what keeps you from proposing to the woman you say you love?	I have been with my bf for almost 3 years. We were in the same state and I asked him to move in together, he said he is not ready. So I decided to move back to where I was from originally, for financial reasons. I knew I should have broke it off then, but he wouldnt let go, and we kept seeing each other, long distance relationship.It became very difficult for me to keep this relationship, as I slowly lost friends, I felt I was married to him but never could do anything with him ( because he is not here) and because my friends are gone ( he is jealous). He kept talking about marriage, and wanting me to move there. So I told him, propose to me and I will move. He wouldnt, saying it is either the money, or we argue too much... etc.. I became so angry w him all the time, b/c he wouldnt give me what I wanted, I wanted to be with him, and by his side,but he always acted ok with the distnce. I was the only one with the urge to be 2gether. Why didnt he propose if he loves me ?

My friend (I'll call her Heather) and her boyfriend (I'll call him Josh) went out and were a really cute couple. Well, Josh always flirted with me. And I just kinda pushed him away 'cause I wasn't going to do that to my best friend. Well, a week later he broke up with her. I didn't know why, but she didn't even care. Then, he goes and asks me out. I'm shocked, but Heather was the one who told me to say yes! She said she was going out with a new guy (which I'll call Jay), and she said she was happy with him. And she said she didn't like Josh anymore and wanted us to go out. So I said yes 'cause Heather told me she didn't care. But before I said yes, I made her pinky promise that she didn't care, and I said, "I'm making you do this 'cause I wanna make sure you don't care because I would never go out with him if it bothered you." Well, I broke up with him 2 days later 'cause all he talked about was Heather. Now him and his friends hate me, and him and Heather are flirting. Did I do wrong

Fala-me, busca-me e ao lugar que queiras irei, do teu lado, alí estarei. Tudo o que tens a fazer é sentir que n?o te esquecí, sou teu amigo, sim, teu amigo fiel, quando te sintas vencida e dentro de tí n?o encontrares paz e à dor te entregues pelos outros, olha dentro de você e alí me encontrarás...sou essa pequena luz de amizade. Fala-me, busca-me, e ao lugar que queiras irei. Do teu lado...sempre, alí estarei, a distancia jamais existirá para este carinho sou teu amigo, sim, teu amigo. Já sabes que na minha alma você tem um lugar. Um porto onde chegar, aberto para teus sonhos, tuas penas e sentimentos, e eu estou oferecendo para você..fala-me, busca-me, e ao lugar que queiras irei, do teu lado sempre alí estarei.   jl5        (Carole King)

Posso chamá-la para passar o dia em um clube muito bom daqui e fechar uma parte dele para nós duas para termos mais sossego e privacidade. N?o seríamos incomodadas por nada! Ah... também quero que nós tenhamos um contato mais frequente e íntimo. Só espero que esse vínculo excessico n?o atraia a curiosidade ou aten??o incoveniente.

20070224063305AAlID17	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I find this girl?	Ok this is going to sound silly, but their is this girl that I found on littlepeoplemeet.com who is 4'8" tall and a cosmopologist in Mushkegon, Michigan. It has been over 30 days since she has used the dating website so I assume she quit it. I saw her profile and I really would like to meet her.       Would it be wrong to try and find her she is only a few hours away. I am thinking about just showing up at the hair salon she is at and pretending I am a customer. The thing is I would have to locate which salon she is at and that is hard to do without calling the salon and asking for her by name.      I feel like this is stalking behavior and I should let it go and find someone else. But we matched up so well in our profile! It is a shame she hasn't used the dating site for over 30 days.

20070331111330AAgSwoe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Which one should I go for? One likes me and with the other I'm not so sure.?	Ok so first of all, I am a freshie in college. Mike is a gentleman who calls me ma'am and opens doors, etc. I like being with him but in conversations he is a bit intimidating cuz he is quite bold and talks a lot. Smtimes I'm afraid of saying smthing stupid because he is quite judgmental and slightly arrogant (it's actually kind of endearing :P). I don't know if Mike is attracted to me but he does like me as a friend since he invites me to hang out with him and friends. Also, I like the fact that he is intelligent, ambitious, family-oriented, and religious. Then there's Raj who is really a sweet, sweet kid. He will go out of his way to do things for me and, according to my friends, he really likes me. But, he is party dude (I don't do parties) and he drinks to get drunk every once in a while. He is very responsible and intelligent, but he has no ambition to do anything unless something is given to him to do. However, I can talk to him real easily and tease him. Which one should I seek?

20070322185747AA9oeGa	Family & Relationships;Family	I need advice please help?	well my brother just recently called me today and crying which he never does and freaked me out because he was crying. I asked him what's wrong and he didn't want to tell me so then i finally had to guess and he said he thinks he bisexual. And he was crying because he thought i was going to see him differently or stop talking to him! I immedeately told him to not worry about it and i was upset that he saw me as this horrible monster who would get mad at him and stop talking to him! I told him that was his own choice and life style and i was nobody to judge him! he told me that he had found out or was thinking about it like about a year ago and barely had the guts to tell me right now. O fcourse i love my brother and this is not going to change the way i see him he is still going to have my respect and love as a sister! i just wanted to know if any of you have gone thru the same thing?

20070312205744AAafEjL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does my exboyfriend want me back?	Hi all, this is what happened. serious answers please! My ex bf broke up with me two weeks ago, and his reason? we argue too much (we did every week) but besides that everything was perfect. He told me wants to be alone and not in a relationship. I begged for him for a week and realized it wasnt working, i pushed him further away. For the past few days, ive been his friend trying to spark up old memories and stuff despite ppl telling me to leave him alone, but i KNOW i want him back and things CAN work. He had been giving me the cold shoulder, but hanging out with him today in his room...at one point he said 'dont think anything of this when i do this' and he came over to me and hugged me tight for like 20 seconds. He did this twice today. Usually he'd not pay attn to me, i think he was caught off guard that I WASNT beggin for him back. I stayed really positive. He also said 'Ur making this hard for me' WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN? should i keep this up? should i leave him alone?

20070421155729AAcInke	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need help.......?	I just played my boyfriend to the left. I played him like a spiker plays a volleyball. He approached me from my right side, prior to that this guy set him up. As he approached from my right side I hit the volleyball hard as I could(I jumped) from top. For once in a great while it didn't go into the net. The angle I hit from was so sharp. Probably was a clear 45 degree angle.       We just broke up and his families home just burned down. Now he wants to come stay with me. I still love him but I just don't know about us. things between us are getting hellish. We have the best time together whether we have money to waste or not. What should I do? I have a sexual weakness for this person.   What should I do?
20070309123418AAHvJtI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think that this guy likes me?	There is this guy who I have had a crush on ever since I started high school. It's not for the looks but for the personality. I first met him through his older sister. The guy I like is in the same grade. We started talking once we first met. Now I have known him for over 7 months. I have gotten pretty comfortable being around him. He always likes to make me laugh and loves to challenge me. A few times a week we have tickling wars and he always tries to tickle me. We have held hands a few times during the tickling wars and once even held hands when we weren't. Only for a few seconds though.But after I had first met him he had a "church thing girlfriend". He told me it was only a "church thing" but that was right when I met him. Now he and I flirt more and more everyday. I can't help but wonder if he likes me and doesn't know that I like him or he just thinks of me as a friend. I have tried to hint that I like him and sometimes I think it works and sometimes it doesn't. Does he like me?

20070514104627AASo2Hu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should this will be contested?	My Mom died 17 years ago. My Dad remarried to a widow who was extremely unsecure financially.  My Mom and Dad own their own home - my step-mother own a few pipeces of furniture - lived in a one room apartment and had a ton of  credit card debt.  My Dad married her - and of course paid off her debt, and gave her the life of leisure.  All children of both my Dad and my stepmother were adults at the time of their marriage.  Under his new wife's influence Dad sold the homestead and they moved into a prestigious senior condo complex.  Dad became ill and eventually ended up in a Nursing Home for a number of years were he passed away.  We (his children) completely understand that he wanted his wife to be financially secure and comfortable for the remainder of her days as well.  Now that she has passed away, her will also included dividing the property with her five children as well as us.  As it ends up they all get more money than we do - Dad's natural children. This doesn't seem fair to me.

20070309150428AAcS8fI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it possible to have a long-term, successful relationship with someone you meet on-line?	I want to know if it is really possible to make a relationship work with someone you initially meet on-line.  The reason I ask is that I have belonged to a couple of on-line services (eHarmony.com and Match.com) and it seems like the only people who've contacted me are guys who want me to give them money or guys who just want a physical relationship.  My profiles have been very straightforward about what I'm looking for in a man (someone who is honest, doesn't use bad pick-up lines, etc), but it doesn't seem to make any difference.  I would appreciate any feedback.

20070131104053AAj0lRN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Dominating women only please?	I married a dominating woman and I’ve been asking questions about how to handle her and I love the feedback I’m getting from you women. If I could marry you all I would! But I do love my dominant female so she’s the only one for me. Well I pulled rank on her this morning and took the wind out of her sails and now she wants to jump on me like there’s no tomorrow (after trying to lay the pity party guilt thing on me. Seems also like a trick of dominating women. When they know they lose they turn submissive just to get control and then turn back to dominating when it doesn’t work). So now I’m looking for addition advice on how to handle you all when you mouth off and just throw a tantrum to get what you want (come on you all know you do it). Some have said not to even flinch when you all get all dominating and you’ll stop arguing and respect us more. Does that work? It also seems like you all like to be dominating but then like us to throw you down and make the call when it comes to the bedroom? Are you all really submissives in disguise? Or only about certain areas in the relationship? Seems like all you dominating wives have the same things that you like and dislike. So bring them on girls, you’re really helping me with my wife (even though she thinks she’s still in control). It’s fun and it makes our relationship that much better.

There's this guy friend of mine, that I'm developing a crush on and he's really shy, so I don't know if he likes me or not because one of his friends told me that he likes this other girl. But when he found out I like him he started to show mixed sign.....here's the signs he shows:   -when talking to me he looks at me for 2 seconds then turn away, as if he's nervous or something(so it's like he afraid of looking at me straight in the face and avoiding long eye contact)   -when we're alone he's always the one who's starting the conversation, like asking "how's your life going?" or "how's your morning?"   -when we're talking he smiles a lot   -remembers things that I talked to him about   -he once called my name and wanted me to wait for him so we can walk to class together alone.   ........so does he like me or is he's just being friendly?    P.S. He doesn't act like this w/ his friends, but often he's really quiet around everyone, and when we're in a group of friends he doesn't talk that much w/ me, but will only talk if I strike up the conversation......Thanks you guys!^_^   ---(I'm sorry that it's long, but I'm really confused)---Thanks to the ones that helps^_^   -Alinn

20070227143659AAuG6gF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Tiene una madre el derecho de negarle sus hijos a un padre?	Hace varios anos atras, mi hermano se divorcio de su primera esposa con la que tuvo dos hijos. Esta desde entonces se ha dedicado a no dejarle ver sus hijos. Ella le ha hecho creer a los jueces de Massachussets (que es adonde viven) que mi hermano es un suicida y que por dada razon no es apto para tener derechos de visitas con mi sobrino y sobrina. Es cierto que una vez el intento quitarse la vida por la depression que sentia al no ver a sus hijos pero desde ese momento nunca volvio a intentarlo y recibio trato medico para ello. Pero ella se agarro de esto para decirles a los jueces que el es un mal hombre y que maltraba a sus hijos. Esto lo decia por que mi hermano les imponia quehaceres en la casa como cortar la grama y ordenar sus dormitorios. Yo le juro que mi hermano no es un mal hombre ni mucho menos un mal padre. El adora a sus hijos y nunca los maltrato.. Ella logro que ellos no quieran saber nada de su padre. De esto hacen 5 anos. Por favor ayundenme para poder ayudarlo.

Is it considered cheating on his part if they are seperated and he meets someone else and starts dating?       Dating while seperated, but not yet divorced... cheating or moving on ???

20070308102002AAgkz8X	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My g-friend and I broke up about a month ago and I want to get back together.  How should I proceed?	We saw each other for the first time in about month two nights ago.  The conversation was good.  Emotional.  Heartfelt.  But she seemed unsure of getting back together.  We then hugged, or embraced, more accurately.  Then started kissing.  Then started kissing some more.  And then ended up going to my house for more kissing.  And then a goodbye.  I reached out to her yesterday and she said she is not sure if this is a good idea.  I feel horrible. Rejected.  I wrote her a letter articulating my feelings.  I suppose in the end there is nothing left to do, but wait.  Unless you have any other advice.      Thanks.

20070320063406AAQcKmw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was he just being rough with me or was it?	abuse? My ex wants to get back with me. We broke up when he had an argument because he said I was flirting with some other guy. He ended up punching the other guy and we had to leave the club. We went back to my bf's place and in bed he attempted to say sorry and we began kissing and making up. But when he insisted that I was flirting I got the hump and back off. He then demanded that I open my legs because I had got him going; I just starred back defiantely but then he just prised my legs open and entered me forcefully. I admit that I did come, but got up and spent the night in the living room. When I spoke to him in the morn he was apologetic but insisted that it was just rough sex and not rape. He seemed v upset that I should say these things about him. Admittedly after 2 yrs of dating he has never done anything like this before. Now he has been in contact and wants to get back together.and I am not sure. Should I tell the police, forget about it or what?

I have had a crush on this man for a long time since I was 14 I am almost 21 now. He is a neighbor or was until his house burnt down. He's 31 years old. But I don't care he is just so dang cute. Some sh!t went down about 6 years ago. Some freinds of mine was harrassing him and putting my name on it (I find that stupid and idiotic and personally would never do it) He called the cops and was saying this and that. No idea. He said he was engaged to be married. But I don't know if that ever happended or not. He stopped waving. He stopped talking. I have loved this man all this time! I just wish he realized it. I'm very shy, and scared to do anything. I see him walking through town and my heart goes to beating really fast. I smile and wave and think omg I would die to be with him. He's been in trouble with the law and is working on getting his life turned around. With me being so shy what do I do. How can I get him to notice or even talk to me??

My husband moved to a new are about six months ago and have spent alot of time with our neighbors, an attractive couple we seem to have alot in common with.  Recently they confided in us that they swing and they're interested in having us join them.  After the initial shock, curiosity took over and we'd like to go see it for ourselves but have no intention of "joining in".  We're no prudes, and have enjoyed an occasional "couples" porn movie together, but thats been the extent of our "adventures" so far.  Would it be wrong to just go and watch like voyeuers?  Frankly, the though of real couples in this setting is kind of a turn on.      Any thoughts on the subject?  We'd love to hear real swingers opinions on it.

20070423092341AAC2Kof	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Le digo que quiero que nos casemos?	mi novio me dijo que en un mes se ira para el gabacho, osea, para estados unidos, obviamente se ira de ilegal y eso me da miedo, el se va porque segun el aqui no le va muy bien, y el quiere juntar una lanita(osea dinero) para que cuando regrese nos casemos y tengamos una casita y el quiere comprarse un carrito, yo lo apoyo en lo que el quiere, pero a mi nadie me saca la espinita de que talvez aya se encuntre a otra, ya saben que las chicas de estados unidos son unas aventadas y unas facilotas, yo no quiero perderlo, es mi amor, mi hombre, es con quien quiero estar hasta el dia de muerte y el tambien me dice lo mismo, en fin, yo he pensado en la idea de casarnos por lo civil antes de que se vaya, es como para sentirme mas segura de que no me fallara y aunque digan que no, saben bien que cuando hay un compromiso las cosas se hacen mas fuertes, pero no se como decirselo, como le digo que nos casemos antes de que se vaya, y que lo esperare hasta que el regrese...ustedes que me aconsejan??

20070426092509AAgXbOx	Family & Relationships;Family	Mi padre nos trata como bebes?	somos 4 hermanos, todos de 30 a?os y algo más. durante toda nuestra vida no hemos tenido una gran cercania con nuestro padre, por el contrario si con nuestra madre. lamentablemente mamá fallecio a dos a?os y nos quedamos con papá en casa. el asunto es que nuestro padre siempre nos ha tratado como bebes, de hecho nos habla y nos aconseja como tales. pareciera que el duelo que lleva acrecentó esa extra?a actitud en él. en mi casa no existe mucha comunicación, caso nadie se habla, parecemos extra?os entre nosotros. tengo planes de irme a vivir con mi novio y no deseo dejar a mi padre asi, sin hablarnos y distanciados. quiero acercarme a él pero no puedo, no siento la confianza para hacerlo, y se nota que a el tambien le cuesta acercarse a mi.
20070427141938AAPRtnm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I get him back? I called off the wedding, and now I feel soo bad!?	I am a very impulsive person. It's gotten me in trouble often. The good thing is, that this impulsivity also allows me to be adventurous and creative, but lately, it's been really hard on my man. I just moved to nyc to be with him, and hated my job. I've been flip-flopping and my impulsiveness had reached its limits (quitting a job, asking for it back, not knowing what to do as far as my visa...), and I said 2 days ago, I thought I should move out (he was picking on me when he got home, and I just couldn't take it anymore! I have a VERy stressful job, adn when I come home, I want to be in peace!)  Needless to say, the day has come, and I don't want to leave. However, this would play into him blaming me for being impulsive. Also, I asked him to marry me again, and he said no. I asked him because my visa is expring and I'm afraid we won't be together if I'm in another country. If it was up to me, we would wait longer to marry, but I feel like we don't have time. HELP!!

20070430154538AAZtaVG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So i have this thing for a girl?	She is funny, popular, attractive and single      But the only problem is she is way outa my league and could have the pick of many other guys. So how do i make myself stand out. I am not blessed in the looks department, and alot of other guys know her alot better than me. But i reckon if i could get closer to her she may like me.But i only ever see her in clubs so its hard to get to know her.   I met her through a mutual friend (but even this friend is not like a close friend of mine, we just play on the same sports team at uni) and we had a good laugh and even shared a kiss, also she gave me her number. But she was very drunk, and i don't think it meant much as she ended up 'pulling' and then going off with some other guy!   So what should i do??

So, i started dating this guy a couple months ago, but broke up with him cause it wasnt going anywhere. we started hooking up two months after, and continued hooking up. now, he told me a month ago, that he wanted to stop hooking up cause he "wanted to have a girlfriend and i think this other girl is a good opportunity" and he knows i dont want a boyfriend (which is true). but i started liking him, for real.

You had only had one boyfriend before this and kissed him one time. There is this new guy at a new school that you are going to. You know for a fact he likes you, and you think you like him too.

BTW i am the guy that likes her in this situation haha.
20070519210640AAhpEAG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex dumped me out of the blue, why wont he tell me the truth?	Was in a three year relationship then out of the blue he becomes distant, saying that he's tired for a couple of days, then dumps me only saying that he was unhappy, didnt know why but he doesn't feel the same way. And thats it, i asked him for an explanation, i told him i wanted the truth, i didnt care how much it would hurt me, none of this sugar coated bullshit. Then he just completely avoided me. Why is it that ex's cant tell you the truth, instead completely ignore you like you meant nothing to them, I even hinted some reasons like is it someone else, have you cheated on me, or is it something i did wrong or, you dont want to be in a relationship anymore, or you want to be single with your other mates. But he just denied it and said he doesn't know. Whats with that?

My ex told me he loved me, albeit a bit under the influence, we still had a coherent conversation, he wasn't just blathering away. Generally we are very sadistic and cruel towards eachother, but alot of the walls came down and he complained that he couldn't get over me and expressed concern for me. I just don't understand why he doesn't want to be with me if he loves me and doesn't want anyone else. He also wants to be friends. I don't know how to act when I see him, I just can't get him out of my head, and I was doing an ok job of getting over this until now. Now I'm wondering why we couldn't have made it work. Why he didn't try, and if nothing else, if he was so horrible, why do I want him when I could have someone else who would treat me right. Why can't I stop obsessing over him when he probably isn't thinking about me? I just don't know what to do.

20080918155730AAKPMzy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Just been hurt, he won't admit, please help! 10 points!!?	My friend William has been my best guy friend for three years now. He's always been there for me and I can always talk to him. Today he told me he hated me. Now, my friends (including him) say that, but in a joking way. Whenever he says that (in a joking way) he usually says "I love you" or "Joking!" or will give me a hug. But today he was completely serious when he said it. Then he walked away. I am so crushed. I don't have any romantic feelings for him, he's just the friend, but still, even guys that I have liked that will ignore me or be rude or tell me off, haven't hurt this much. A guy has never hurt me this bad. My friend noticed how depressed I was and went to go confront him twice but he denies it and won't even confront ME. And supposedly HE "like likes" me, I know he does because he has admitted it to me several times and whenever I'm sad he comforts me.    I don't know what to do. I'm breaking inside and I can't figure out how to get him to apologize or if he really does hate me to tell me why.       Please help. I'm sorry for the lengthyness of it, but it's a big problem. I am going to award ten points to whoever can help me the most.      Thank you so much. I will add to this if you have anymore questions.      God Bless.

There was a hot chick was at a restaurant eating alone so I decided to go over there and sit next to her and try to talk to her and hit on her. I think she was thinking the same thing because she had already ordered food for two (along with 2 other plate full of, what I assume where appetizers), and it was my favorite, lobster. So I sat down and started eating, and I introduced myself and asked her how her day was. She started saying something but the lobster was really good and I was focused on that, so I was mainly agreeing with her most of the time and acting like I was paying attention. She was really good looking, she seemed a little slow though, if you know what I mean. I wouldn't put it against her. The whole affair ended when this one guy with two babies came out of the bathroom and saw me kiss his pretty women (she of course, acted like she didn't want it, playing hard to get). He must have been pretty jealous that I was a young, good-looking man, who was in love so he started chasing me with a butter knife and I have to jump in a dumpster and hide from him. I forgot to get her phone number but I should be able to find her again sometime, seemed like this restaurant was one of her regular places. I think she really might be the one.
20070724042124AAVp4pi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	No one has answered my question yet after hours and hours! :'(  ... chance to redeem yourself please?	ok hear is my question again. i didn't recieve a response (sob,sob) so it would be great (please :)) if you could give some feedback:      Im interested in occupational therapy as a career as i would really like to help people.       i know that you do not need physics or chemistry or even maths b to get in but i was wondering on the amount of science involved. Is it hard? And what about the amount of maths?       For people who do OT, do you find that you need to use the anatomy and statistics skills you have learnt most days or did you just forget it after doing your uni exams?       i have also never had any experience with people who have disabilities.       any comments, help etc would be much appreciated. thanks!! :D

Sempre fui muito determinada e para conquistar um objetivo, n?o pensava duas vezes se tivesse que prejudicar ou fazer alguem sofrer para isso, o que importava era apenas o meu bem estar e o que fosse melhor para mim, se alguem me prejudicasse pensava logo em dar o troco me vingando. Hoje mudei minha forma de pensar, gra?as a pessoa que amo, que n?o aprova a forma que eu encarava e lidava com certas situa??es, que n?o gosta e ficava muito triste quando eu agia de forma egoista e mesquinha. Sem contar que tudo que vinha facil ia facil tambem, e que quase nunca eu conseguir me sentir feliz, mesmo tendo praticamente tudo. Hoje me arrependo de tudo que fiz, que de alguma forma tenha prejudicado ou feito alguem sofrer. Sem contar que atualmente acredito na lei do retorno. Gostaria de saber a sua opini?o a respeito?

20070808052503AABhiKe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do?	I have/had a crush on a guy at work. The thing is we used be close friends and I started liking him as more than a friend. I got the since that he liked me too since he always flirted with me and cracked jokes, etc. But, he has a gf in the Phillipines whom he is engaged to since I helped him get the ring for her. He only gets to go back there once every 2 years and I think we started experiencing sexual tension since we had a convo about doing it. I called him a dog since I thought he was comin on to me but then he denied he was serious bout it and said he was kidding. I apologized to him but then he started ignoring me. He said I should focus on someone else and it's best that we no longer be friends since I was too weird.Yesterday, I emailed him saying that we were both wrong for talking about sex, he blamed me for being weird. i got mad and told him not to b my friend, just a coworker. he told me not to email him or talk 2 him unless work relatd. thing is i think i want him.

Lembra que eu contei que havia mandado uma msg de celular para minha " ex" ( Faz 15 dias que terminamos o relacionamento), dizendo que estava comendo comida japonesa e lembrei dela, e que ela era uma pessoa especial e tal? Pois é, ela me respondeu a msg dizendo que a msg era linda, e que eu tb era uma pessoa muito especial, e que quando eu quiser companhia para comer comida japonesa, é só ligar para ela! O que vcs acham disso? O que significa ela ter me respondido isso depois de três dias que eu mandei a msg? é melhor eu ficar na minha e n?o falar nada? Ela estuda na minha sala!Por favor, dêem suas opini?es! Valeu! Abra?o!

20070707154548AACTu0W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are women really the ones to be worrying about aging?	i don't see why women start to feel like they're losing their sex appeal when they get older. i'm 19 and i find women in their 30s much sexier than girls my age. and i still find women in their 40s very sexy. a lot of guys feel that way. i can't imagine guys in their 30 and 40s finding women in their 30s and 40s unattractive.      i think we're the ones who have it tough. most girls around my age are mostly attracted to guys in their teens and early 20s, and never guys over 30. when women get older, they just start to be attracted to older guys, because they find themselves less atractive, so they lower their standards. but there are still plenty who admit they are mostly attracted to guys in their late teens and 20s.      in general, a woman in her 30s is sexier to guys her age than a teen girl, and is even sexy to teen boys. but a man in his 30s is most likely not sexier to women his age than a teen boy, and is definitely not sexier to teen girls.

I guess thats the reason why in society you sometimes see drop-dead, good-looking gorgeous girls that look like models with ugly, obese, or just not attractive boyfriends, but you never see a good looking guy that looks like Brad Pitt, Tom Brady with a fat, unattractive female. Like a unnatractive man has a much easier chance of getting laid or getting a girlfriend than a unnattractive woman has a chance of getting laid or getting a boyfriend. That just shows you that girls, females overall are verbal-oriented species, and us guys, males, are visual oriented species. It's like girls are turned on more on what they hear than see, and us guys are always turned on by what we see. Seriously, why girls love confidence so much? why is it the most extreme thing they find sexy in a man? WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! why is it always about personality for them?

Cresci em uma família ignorante e paupérrima, daquelas que só almo?a fora quando coloca a mesa no quintal, ninguém me estimulou a estudar, hoje trabalho numa multinacional e estudo Pedagogia na esperan?a de melhorar de vida, mas n?o consigo entender porque as pessoas ao meu redor agem assim, de forma t?o medíocre, pensa comigo: O cara da periferia estuda, estuda, ninguém apóia ele, as garotas do bairro o desprezam, os colegas zombam dele, porém ele consegue se empregar, ser bem sucedido,e as mesmas pessoas fingem que n?o est?o vendo nada disso, ele nunca é reconhecido.    Parece que a maiorias dessas pessoas s?o frustradas e desabafam criticando ou ignorando o sucesso das outras, ou eu estou enganado?

20070712064003AAfVWsX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Could this girl be interested in me?	Well anyway, there this girl that I like shes 16 and Im 18. I asked her to prom which was a little awkward at first since it had been nearly 5 years since I had seen her in person. I went to the prom and hit it off with her.Another day her younger sister had a birthday party and all of their family and some friends were there. I said hi but we didnt really hang around each other or say much. Later I found out that she complained to her friend that why I hadnt talked to her. I then asked if it was still awkward being around me and she said it was because I was being too quiet, and because I said I was tired when I saw her at the party, she though that she was boring me and it kinda made her not wanna talk to me. Then when I told her it was because I was working a lot, she said oh:well thats good' Ill talk to you later". So i was just wondering what your interpretation could be of all this? Do you think she might be interested in me at all?

Before I knew they were getting married, I started getting some strong feelings for her nephew. (BTW- He is 1 yr older then me.) But they just got married on Friday. And Friday night I had a sleepover with him and his sister. I told his sister that I liked him and asked her if he had said anything about me to her. She told me that earlier that day he had said that I was really pretty and it was cool that I talked to him. (He thought I was really shy before) So I got really excited. After we talked about that, she told me that she had feelings for my brother (They're 16.) She told my brother that she liked him. And she told her brother what I had told her. So is this totally weird that we are almost going out???? I mean we're not blood related so......       And yesterday he was all quiet around me and wouldnt even look at me but this afternoon he was all talking to me and messing around!

I don't stop him, because I feel like I bring so much confusion and stress into his life that I could at least give him that...but sadly my facial expression gives me away in the end and he gets so mad at himself for not stopping.

20070613171525AAD2vE2	Family & Relationships;Friends	Im upset ='(?	me and my best friend are in my drama program at school. I was rehersing for a romantic comedy called "Barefoot in the Park". My friend was doing "Alice and Wonderland". So me and my friend both got our costumes. Turns out i bought mine and she made hers by hand. It took her 3 weeks to make it . 2 days before the performance our teacher tells us to show her how we have come along in memorization and staging. Turns out mine was fantastic that she had never seen anything like it. But that my friends was horrible. Her partner didnt have her lines memorized, bad staging, no emotion. My teacher told her to get off the stage, she wouldnt perform. She burst out crying and  ran out the door. I hugged her and told her that there was always next year.  What was worse was she didnt come see me perform and she left this message on my machine crying her head off. Allthogh she told me to break a leg (which is good luck) I still felt i could do more. What can i do to make her feel better?

I mean how do you tell someone whats in your mind when all they do is interrupt? I don't want to tell her anyway.. Because it always ends up in a fight.  Also, why do parents always make it seem like they don't believe in you? Like you're never going to go anywhere in life.. And why do they always make you out to be just some other stupid kid when they know that you're really street-smart?      And why does she(my mother) keep insisting I need to see a psychiatrist even though I keep saying "no"? She thinks I've some issues I need to sort out. I'd be lying if I said I don't have problems, in fact, I do have alot of them and there's always alot of things on my mind and I have been having family problems lately and have been getting frustrated with school.. The thing is, I just don't want therapy, it makes me feel like a psycho. I just want to be a "normal" teen.      What to do?

I have this best friend Benjamin and i kinda liked him and I couldn't get the guts to say it to his face but i asked him in an email to hold my hand if he likes me and if not then to just tell me that he doesn't feel that way towards me.      How he's like:   He once asked me on a date but i told him that i had to go somewhere and i really had to go somewhere im wasn't just saying that because.  He also was talking with some of my friends and said that he wanted to take me to Spiderman or someting. and then i came back and everybody was like this and that and he was somewhat embarresed and he didn't want them to tell me that. He's kinda shy....so do u think he will get the guts to hold my hand or not? if u need more info tell me what u need.....

Okay so I liked this guy(we'r sorta friends), and my friend had no idea who he was, so I showed her.  She automatically likd him and flirted with him. Then she asked me to ask him out!

I've seen some pictures online where many old and fat looking men getting young women to dance with them and kiss them.These old guys go to bars, parties, and etc to find young girls that are my age. It seems they are after these girls for fun not love.Girls seem to love their outgoing wild behavior.      I'm a young man still in my teen years and many people tell me that I'm handsome. I don't go to parties, night clubs, or all those things because I'm kind of reserved. I don't want to do anything wild, I just want someone I can be with or spend time with. Yes I'm still a virgin because I'm waiting for that someone.

20070819141033AAsJsZa	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do you think about my testimonial about a friend?	If I know anything about her, I know she would hate to see me on here crying like a little baby.  Well Alexis, I'm sorry I just can't help it, I just can't believe this is happening.  I really don't know what to say.  I even don't know if I'm the right person to be here speaking about her, but...      I want you all to know three things about Alexis.      The first thing is she knew better.  She knew how to be a better person, she cared, she really cared...and I respect the hell out of her for being that person.      The second thing I want you to know, is that she was there.  She was there for me when others were not.  She was someone you could talk to, and she was the person who could make you feel better.      And no matter how much pain I was in, when she and I were together it seemed like all the pain just went away.      My one comfort, my one saving grace is that I know, I know at one time she knew better; and how much of a friend she was to me.      You can call me a selfish son of a b**ch, but I'd give anything to have her back here.  I miss the hell out of her and I love her, and I will always remember how you were.      She was my best friend, probably my only true friend.  I'm sure there is a lot of people that she knows who would say different, and say the same.  She was such a beautiful person, such a kind hearted person, I can't really find the words to describe what kind of a person she was, I knew Alexis for about four years, and out of the 15 years that I've been around, the years that I spent with her were the best.      I truly can say that I love her.  I got alot of good memories that you left behind in my heart, they are what's keeping me here.  I, I wish this thing was all a bad dream, and I could wake up and you were still here with me.           My greatest memory of her was when a kid next to me was talking crap about my mom, and she just tells him off. Such a sweet person. The relationship we had wasn't something we had to work on, it was already there. and when all this started happening it was gone. I just want her to know that I love with all of my heart, and hope that she comes back soon. I love you Alexis.       No matter what happend between us, no matter what's happening now, I'll always be your friend.
20070819100245AA7jroW	Family & Relationships;Friends	A farewell message...?	I don't know what happened, it just didn't seem real.  We used to be so close.  It's like one moment she's beside me, and the next she is gone.  When ever I'd be in such pain, whenever I was with her or talking to her, it seemed like all the pain just went away.      What I loved about her most was the she was so funny, she was so damn funny.  And she knew better, wasn't into drugs or alchohol, the perfect person.  And then she changed.      My greatest memory of her was when a kid next to me was talking crap about my mom, and she just tells him off.  Such a sweet person.  The relationship we had wasn't something we had to work on, it was already there.  and when all this started happening it was gone.  I just want her to know that I love with all of my heart, and hope that she comes back soon.  I love you Alexis.

Me ensinou os primeiros passos.   As primeiras palavras.   As lembran?as mais antigas que tenho de você,   é sua m?o segurando a minha para me dar prote??o.   Sua voz doce, cantando cantigas de ninar,   me fazendo dormir e sonhar.   Um sono sereno, tranqüilo,   Sabendo que você estaria ali a me proteger.   Você que lutou, sorriu, chorou.   Mas n?o deixou a amargura tomar conta de seu cora??o.   Você que me ensinou a ser mulher,   mas continuar com meu sonhos de crian?a.   A ser forte, sem ser amarga.   Abrir meus caminhos,   Tomando sempre cuidado com as plantinhas ao redor.   Com você aprendi a ser "gente" que respeita "gente".   Aprendi a ter fé, aprendi a aceitar os defeitos das pessoas.   Aprendi que o amor tem que ser incondicional.   Minhas melhores lembran?as,   s?o as que você cria todos os dias...   no amor que sinto em tudo o que você faz.   No brilho de seu olhar   M?e...   Que Deus a proteja sempre,   Te ilumine, te de for?as para continuar sua batalha.   E que eu possa sempre sentir e ter esse amor maior   em todos os momentos de minha vida

Perdi meu pai muito cedo, ent?o tive q amadurecer, tomar conta da minha irm?, fui pouco crian?a. As coisas comigo agora no mundo adulto s?o mais práticas. Sempre arranjo namorados q dizem: " Vc precisa ser mais delicada e carinhosa" ou "Vc n?o me trata com do?ura!" Procuro tratar outros da melhor forma possível e ser educada, mas ás vezes chego no meu limite e dali n?o consigo passar. N?o consigo colocar apelidinhos, nem falar como crian?a! Já tentei até mudar pra agradar outros, mas n?o consigo!!!   Meu último relacionamento terminou assim:" Minha vó e minha m?e me elogiam e vc n?o. Estou acostumado a ser tratado com elogios e muito carinho. Quero uma pessoa mais parecida comigo, mais delicada" Depois dessa fiquei super deprimida. Afinal o que há de t?o errado no meu jeito?

She texted me saying that she isn't bothered by it at one point then she says it has and then she says it hasn't again, the point of my question was that ever since then she hasn't really texted me much probably twice over the past couple of days even though I keep texting her asking what she's up to and such but I don't get a reply. My question is should I keep texting her? or just wait till she texts me? Want an opinion from someone who knows the answer as I don't want to end up biting myself in the *** by continually bothering her with text messages when i'm unsure to just leave her alone if she's not in a mood to talk because of the recent loss

20080925112746AAScplN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can i find a decent girl who is not a slut or princess?	So i just read a testimony on Yahoo Answers about a little girl only 14 years old who is thinking about dumping her boyfriend because he's not well enough endowed.      This really makes me despair.  I'm about to turn 28.  I've only had two serious girlfriends, and only one that I went all the way with.  It seems to me that every girl I meet is either living in this fantasy where a man will dote on her till he drives himself to the grave, or she is a slut.  Or she's BOTH!  Or they are unattractive.      Are there any girls out there that are 24-28 that are actually smart, loving, unselfish, AND beautiful?  Are you "reformed sluts"?  And should I be ok with the fact that other girls have had WAY more sex partners than me?  Am I doomed to marry a girl who has a kid?  Can I trust women to love and NOT run off like everybody else I've ever known?

20070607121951AAVsGm8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dumped her but still have have feeling of her?	I have just dumped my girlfriend for cheating on me twice with two different men within five months. The first time I forgave her after a heart to heart talk. She promised me that it will never happen again. But she cheated on me again just few streets away. I ordered her to move out which she did but she was shocked and crying when packed her stuff and asked her to leave.      However, I still have feeling for her. We have been together for two years. Giving a person a second chance is ok but a third chance? I thought about this but said no way because I'll never trust her. Still this feeling of her comes back and I wonder whether I should think twice about my decision. What do you think? She just 19 and I'm 30. Could this be because of the age difference thought the guy she has cheated with are in my age? Thanks for your help

Me and my boyfriend have been together 3 months. We actually met online. But as I learned more about him, I found out that before me, he constantly hooked up with people he had just met online. He took down 2 out of the 3 profiles I knew he had. But he still, at least once a week, gets IMs, txt messages or phone calls from random people he has met up with. He promises he would never cheat on me since my first and only other serious boyfriend cheated on me, but that he needs his space sometimes. I want to respect his privacy and let him have his friends, but I found an IM from 3 weeks ago were he said he misses being single and free again. I miss being single and free sometimes but I think I love him. He also has been in a few relationships before but never in love. I want to offer him everything including my heart, but don't know if I should. Please, any advise would be appreciated!

Outside, roast a pig, have drink fountians and pineapple chicken, and champagn, and kegs of beer.  Deorate it nicely, but have it be a little more casual.  At this,we cut the cost of a caterer, a full bar, and a hall.  The place is 100$ to rent the park, we need to rent the tents, the table and chairs and pig roaster.  Anyone think we could save money this way???

Ele fez loucuras para conseguir casar comigo pq eu tinha desistido.

20070717025700AAIU9fk	Family & Relationships;Friends	Old friends coming back into my life?	Some friends I stopped seeing last year, through their choice, because of something they think I did they hate me. Now a year and 2 months later, one of them has added me to my myspace profile which I denied and so sent me a message saying 'why did you decline, i'm not going to be nasty or anything etc etc it's just weird not to be efriends with someone anymore'. My other friends/family have said it just sounds like they wanna snoop on my profile/post comments saying stuff about me. The past year has been difficult and now I've started to get back on my feet to join the USMC so for them to start crap off again is not what I need, but I would give anything to have those friends back because I'd known them so long...
20070719003601AAkXNM0	Family & Relationships;Friends	How should I solve MY problem?	So I have this friend who I feel is stealing my best friend. My best friend hasn't said anything but I know she knows how I feel and she tries to hide everything they do together which I kinda like. But the other friend doesn't get it and tells me everything they do together and my best friend always tried to quickly change the subject. They are also going to Europe next summer without me which I can't bare the thought of. Now we all dance together and I think they might be training to do a duo but I don't fully know yet. This is my problem not any of my friends , just to make that clear. What should I tell the friend who's stealing my best friend?? What should I do?!?!?!?

20070719212707AAqR7Z8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Minha namorada nunca dá o bra?o a torcer, pois terminamos a 1 mês por causa de minha imaturidade. o que fa?o	Bom, pra come?ar, tenho 18 anos, namorei durante 1 ano com uma menina. No mês passado, terminamos, pois ela disse que as vezes eu ficava jogando piadinhas, ou jogando verde pra colher maduro. Mas n?o, morria de ciúmes dela, afinal, ela é linda, e estava come?ando a amar ela de verdade. (Mesmo com tanto tempo de namoro!) Porém, uma semana depois que terminamos, topei com ela em uma balada, na qual ela já estava com outro. Me senti um lixo, daí, resolvi tentar esquece-la , mas n?o consegui. Depois de ter visto ela várias vezes com outros, eu acabei gostando mais dela. Hoje, voltamos a ter o papo de antes. Ela voltou a me chamar de "Meu lindo". Porém ainda sinto que ela n?o quer voltar. Ela alega que vai voltar comigo, depois que eu me decidi em algumas coisas. sinto que estamos próximos, porém, as vezes penso que ela pode estar querendo me iludir, pra depois me dar outro pé na bunda. O que vocês acham que devo fazer? Correr atrás? Me declarar? Estou sem saida.

20070723140105AAyJT23	Family & Relationships;Family	Meus pais esperam demais de mim, que devo fazer?	Tenho 15 anos, meus pais s?o bons mas esperam de mim a perfei??o. Sou boa menina, excelente aluna e procuro atender às expectativas deles, que s?o as minhas também. Mas é estressante viver assim, a vida á injusta. Se você costuma cometer erros, ent?o todos acham normal, natureza humana. Mas se aqueles considerados ícones (n?o sou, claro) cometem um pequeno erro, passam da glória ao inferno astral em 1 segundo. Meus pais confiam que n?o vou cometer erros. Sou suficientemente madura para n?o confiar em mim mesma, n?o sou Deus, e já disse a eles que é bom terem os pés no ch?o. Hoje acho que s?o muito egoístas, n?o gostam de mim, n?o se preocupam se estou feliz ou n?o, tudo o que querem é se vangloria com os amigos "Temos orgulho de nossa filha, vejam que pais extraordinários nós somos!". Enquanto eu for o que eles querem, v?o me exibir como uma jóia de valor. Se um dia eu cometer um erro, e todos, n?o apenas adolescentes cometem, vou ser execrada, virar lixo

Well ever since my boyfriend (of 4 years) & I got together there was this girl who was always tring to break us up. She would text him all the time telling him to dump me because she wanted to be his girl.. She even text me once saying :"your lucky you live with him or I would make you history". Finally I broke down & called her. She told me she really likes him & he likes her  too. She said that he has stated "if i wasnt dating christy, i would date you".  I confronted him & he would say "if i wanted to really be with her, i would have broke up with you already & been with her" but did admit that he did say he would date her if we broke up. I was so mad & didnt want them talking anymore because she always tries to steal him. I made him choose her or I, & he picked me. But then the next day he's talking to her again and lies to me about it! He said I am just immmature & said this whole thing is my fault. How is it my fault when all I did was state the obvious? So we fight about it alot

Ok so I have been working with this guy for about six months now.  We never really talked that much until a few months ago when he started joking with me at work.  Then, we started play shoving and stuff.  Eventually, we found each other on myspace and started talking on there and on IM for hours.  Now, we text each other almost every night for one or two hours a night, even if we have spent all day working together.  We watch TV shows together and comment on them. The other night he texted me to tell me he lost his toothpaste (lol).  When we are at work, we have all of these inside jokes now and he'll do anything he can to make me laugh.  I really like this guy and I think he really likes me as well but might be a little shy...and I'm shy as well...      Do you think he likes me as more than a friend? And if so, what should I do to move things forward? And sadly, neither of us are teenagers...we are adults.  I feel like I'm in high school all over again!

20070819012703AAYIRBH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I tell the truth to a guy who I asked out not knowing, (he turned me down) but now I do want to ask him	The guy used to be a college teacher of mine, a few years older than me. Many years back in college, I prayed with him for his dad. After that prayer, I felt compelled to invite him to my church, but I never did. I now have befriended him just within the past year and a half. We are both working on a project together with some other people. The truth is though, my mom, likes to social dance as well as myself and wanted to invite him to a social dance. So she asked me if I could ask him only because she thought it may seem weird inviting him since she is older. After he turned down the offer, I didn't realize till later he probably thought I was asking him out on a date. When I realized it, I felt so grieved within me because I have never asked a guy out in my life. I don't ask guys out because I feel that real gentleman pursue the ladies. So for this to happen, all of a sudden I felt like I was belittling myself. This event took place last November-ish, but since then I’ve noticed our unique relationship has had a different feel ever since. I still wish I could ask him to my church though, which was my original desire for many years. But I have a feeling he may think I’m trying to ask him out. What should I do?
20070819013310AAFsKz3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he just being friendly, Or is he interested in me?	I met someone randomly and he seemed sweet. After about a couple of times hanging out his actions changed. We mainly hang out with a bunch of friends around.   When he started changing hugs got added in which didnt surprise me because I initiated the first hug, Which was just being friendly ya know. Then after that he started looking at me differently, and he will drop everything hes doing for me (like if I come up to him an hes with anyone, even with his buddies I know, he'll stop what hes doing and chat or whatever), Also hes publicly and personally added compliments (I kinda figure its just out of being nice). But then theres things that make me wonder because we havent exchanged phone numbers, He responds like once back to me online if I say something and just lately hes often had a female or more at his side.   His buddies are super friendly with me and one acts like he might know something..

20070908234829AAdP5Uc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like this guy but I'm pretty sure he like my friend..?	Okay so I like this guy and yesterday I went to a carnival with a bunch of my friends and he was there too. So me and one of my other friends marie* were hanging out with him like the whole time. We went on like a million rides together mostly (the zipper, the gravitron) but after a few times on those rides your not scared anymore so you just use it as more time to talk. So while we were riding all of these rides we were all talking and having fun. But me, Im shy around guys, im not bad looking or anything but im just not good about talking to guys I like (he knew I liked him too). So we weren’t talking to much.. But him and my friend were talking a lot (or atleast it seemed like a lot) and while we were on rides I started noticing that he would put his arm around her but not me while riding. She doesn’t like him she likes someone else. But how do I get him to notice me more? We are all going to the carnival again tomorrow, so any ideas or tips for me to do to make him like ME instead?

It all started that i stayed over this place one night (he owns a house with the ex, i had never met her yet) and the ex came home, i was in the shower and she attacked me in the shower and told me to get outta her house, then she starts screaming at my bf, acting like they are still together and he's cheating on her with me (she's been sleeping with a teen for the past few months), i just leave and i send her a nasty email, she shows this email to all of my bf's family, they are so stupid they attack me too. i also got a death threat from the ex's brother (which i made a police report).   My bf and i have now been living together for 5 weeks but i still feel so resentful and bitter that i was put thru this drama in the first place, as i would never expect anyone to go thru this for me, i also feel used.

But last night we kissed (and not the way a friend would kiss another). He took me back to my apartment like any other time. But at the end we had sex. We were both sober, and we’ve always just been friends nothing more. And the thing about it is that we aren’t single. Why would we have sex?

20070923200649AACgkbb	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What are some good books on getting over a breakup?	My daughter is having a really hard time getting over a break-up. She's a teenager and very emotional. I believe she truly loved this boy, although she definitely coul'dve done better. Now he is treating her terrible and she keeps going back for more. I've tried explaining to her that he loves the attention, and she needs to move on. However, as someone who's been there myself (haven't we all?) I am getting worried.  It seems as though she's very emotional and really gets worked up. She's saying things like she's going to 'punch' him if he gets in her face, etc...Truthfully, this boy will and has already and enjoys getting a rise out of her...Does anyone know of a good book or a few good books that I could read to guide her better??? Or, if there are good books, geared towards teens, that would be great too! Thanks so much for any advice you all may have.

20070925132015AAJFbuv	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this crazy or what? or am I?	I feel like I am in high school.  I became friends with this guy at work about five years ago. We have trulely confided in one another with our most intimate thoughts on life; love and everything.  When I got divorced about three years ago, I went through a hard times and he was there for me in the capacity of a friend, and helped me financially.   One day he was helping me out and we stopped at a park to talk.  I thanked him for helping me and then kissed him on the cheek and then we kissed really. It was very mutual and after that its like whatever between us.  We would steal moments at work talk for hours get each others pressure and desires up by touching.  We have not had sex yet.  There have been plenty Ops but I know I am scared because I really love him and too me these are unchartered waters. But I cant figure his story out.  Every bone in my body tells me he is in love with me and he has said so I dont get the brick wall I am facing.  I want to leave him alone but its hard.

So here are signs for both me and K      K...he looks at her..he talks to her in person but wont talk to her on AIM...and he did hear those rumors about her liking him.       Me..he looks at me too....a lot. He wont talk to me in person at school..but will talk to me on AIM. and a lot of awkward things happened with him between me and him ..one is in an AIM chat room I said something after he did and it became something awkward.      And when both K and me are around him..he will look at us both.. and once he even listened in on our convo. so really those he like one of us and if so witch one or not..than tell me no he doesn't like any of u

20071007132741AAkKJwo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this a valid reason to break up with a nice guy?	My boyfriend and I broke up a few days ago, and although I feel confident in my decision, I also feel that the reasons I decided to end our relationship could be a bad reflection of who I am as a person.       We dated for about five months, and he was a nice guy with good intentions and a great sense of humor. However, despite being the same age (22), we lead very different lives. I recently graduated college and currently work as a behavior analyst/teacher for children with autism. He got certified as a mechanic, but no longer wants to pursue such a career, and now works part time in a deli. His social life outside of work was a bit reminiscent of that of a high schooler, mostly revolving around video games and marijuana.       Basically, what I'm asking is: was this an appropriate reason to break up with someone who is otherwise a sweet, genuine guy?

20071202042715AA82H1Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This guy I like wants to visit a girl in another country..does he have feelings for her?	This guy I'm friends with (and I'm sort of in love with this guy) is planning on visiting a friend (girl) who lives in another country. He tells me she is a friend but I'm really worried as I don't know her and wonder why he has to do this. He met her when studying overseas a year ago and they've been in contact as friends. She visited him once (before we got together) and they've kept up the contact by chatting. Am I paranoid? I can't help feeling that if a man needs to visit a woman, he must have feelings for her. Any words of wisdom would help me.

20071212181528AA9iOcu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Pens?o Alimenticia...Quero receber mais!?	é o seguinte na minha a??o de separa??o com o pai de meus 2 filhos ficou acertado que ele pagaria para os filhos o valor de 1 salario minino ( R$ 400,00 ),ajudando com despesas como remedios, vestuarios, cursos, material escolar e convênio medico e que também meus ex deveria arcar com o valor de R$ 700,00 para mim pelo periodo de 1 ano ate eu voltar ao mercado de trabalho ( atualmente eu trabalho ).    Dando um total de R$ 1.100,00 (1 salario minino R$ 400,00 das crian?as + R$ 700,00) , mas ele nunca me pagou esse valor e sim pagava apenas o valor de R$ 700,00, hoje já se faz 1 ano da separa??o e ele passou a me pagar agora apenas R$ 400,00 ( 1 salario minino ) conforme está no mandato de separa??o.   Como fa?o para ele me pagar os valores atrazados, vale a pena entrar com uma a??o judicial, tenho chances de ganhar ou só vou me estressar.

Sempre tive muita paciência e nunca deixei o ódio tomar o cora??o, sempre achei que o amor acalma e resolve tudo.   Mas cansei. Sempre tive pé atrás para confiar nas pessoas, conto em uma m?o quantas pessoas realmente confio. Na tentativa de confiar em mais pessoas, sempre me d?o motivos para n?o confiar em ninguém.    Uma pessoa que eu confiava muito mentiu muito pra mim e continua mentindo. Dessa vez deixei o ódio tomar conta do meu cora??o e me sinto ótimo. Claro que a pessoa n?o sabe disso, apenas xinguei-a em pensamento e n?o desejei lá muitas felicidades. Tou certo em deixar o ódio subir às vezes ou o amor tem que prevalecer sempre? Esse amor até hoje n?o me deu nada.

20071227012804AA3DG73	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about my ex-boyfriend?	My ex and I had been on and off all through high school.  Since timed passed and we're both in college (different ones) I still think about him.  Over Christmas break we started talking again and decided to get together to go see a movie.  All during the movie I felt like he kept trying touch my hand.  Later that night we went back to his place.  Joking around we started tickling each other, and all of this soon elevated into sex.  During sex I accidently said "I love you" and he said it back.  I haven't really talked to him since.  Now I have this empty feeling and I've never felt so confused.  Should I just leave him behind forever?  I feel like I'm chasing a fantasy.

20080101212917AA9vM3Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My g/f keeps pushing me away  - she has commitment issues - do i give her more time to work her stuff out?	i started a relationship with a girl that works for me. It was, romantic n intimate. I went away for a month, since being back shes different,  not intimate n never around. Yet she gives me the keys to her apartment and says dont go.She a latina and usually really into me. I ask her what the problem is ,she says she feels different since my ex wife has moved back into the same area. I asked her if she wants to finish it she says yes then burst into tears saying she loves me so much but she ALWAYS DOES THIS WITH GUYS SHES IN LOVE WITH. She says she feels second place (even though im getting divorced) the irony is if she was around more id be with her all the time. last time we spent all our time together. This time she says she′s always with her family. Friends say latinas r always with their man, she′s with someone else, but she phones n text me and tells me shes missing me. Should I simply give her time n try n prove i love her, or is her commitment issue simply going to repeat

( I asked for a kiss the second time she came over) Now, when I see her, she asks if I STILL HAVE her number? Why? She already rejected me. IS she playing hard to get? Or is she trying to see how far I will go to get it?      I haven't spoke too her in more than a month. She already rejected me, so I am having a hard time calling her too see if she wants to go for a drink. what would you do? thanks.      She is going thought a divorce after 12 years. She was 21 when she got married.   I'm SO stupid for ASKING FOR A KISS!!!!!

20080205151457AADXAFs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP!!! Mature answers from GIRLS Please!!!?	Im 21. I have been seeing a girl for almost 4 months. I asked her in 2 weeks how she felt about a relationship and she said she gets really scared b/c of a bad past relationship. The relationship lasted 3+ years and the breakup was very bad and occurred 3 or 4 months before I met her. She was very nice to me and things went great for the first two months. She then said she wanted to take everything slow and she freaked out and got very scared at how fast it was going. We slowed down a little but she was still somewhat comfortable. She then got scared again and now she is very distant and closes up and puts a guard up against me. She doesnt want to hang out nearly as much with me but when we hang out we have fun and then she closes ip and doesnt answer my texts or answers very short answers. I know she was hurt very bad and is terrified of relationships. What should I do when she gets very distant like this and is it normal fir her if she scared?

20080209174432AAs8QF5	Family & Relationships;Family	My mom just won't listen!?	I'm 14 and I prefer to do my own laundry. I know how I want my clothes sorted, water temperature, etc. I am very picky about this stuff. I tell my mom that I will do it, and I do,..if she doesn't get to it first. I have told her multiple times not to touch my laundry, but she does anyway! And she does it all wrong so that my clothes shrink, or get worn out to fast.      When I ask her not to do my laundry she says, "Well then it won't get done." If she would give me a chance it would! Like today, she used the washing machine all morning so I couldn't do it, then I was gone all afternoon at a party. As soon as I got home I went to get my laundry and the hamper was empty.       I'm independent & this may seem trivial, but it makes me really angry! I have a large wardrobe, I don't need to do laundry twice a week! What can I do!?

I would to meet someone I can fall in love with, but I am having a hard time at it - dating is tough!. My most recent GF dumped me after 5 months without warning, because i wasn't "attentive" enough (probably because I wasn't 100% attracted to her, but i still liked her as a person and was willing to "settle").

See, this will sounds horrible, but all I've really been able to look at this week is his double chin! And it's driving me mad, I can't stand it! I've found myself feeling angry and acting like a ***** to him when I've seen it. But it's seems so much more.....THERE recently! I know he can't be gaining weight because he works out!      I'm really hoping this is just something that will pass...it makes me feel horrible. Should I tell him how I feel....? I don't want to, because it will hurt his feelings. Or does anyone have any advice about how I can just get over it?      Oh, and please don't say anything like " Get a new boyfriend", please.

He was busy that weekend, but asked if we could talk next (this weekend).  I was upset and told him I would give him a call when we could meet on Saturday (this was Friday, March 14).  I called on the 16th and gave him a time and asked him to call back with a place.  No call or email all week.  I sent him an email for a place on Thursday. No email back.  I called last night no answer and no call back.  I wish we weren't breaking up, but if he wants to let me go why won't he just call and get this over with?  I want to move on with my own life, but he isn't letting me know where we will meet and when.  I am getting angry and don't know what to do.  I am about a week shy of mailing him his stuff back because of his behavior. He wants this not me.

20080331115629AAcsMGQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He moved my head when giving him head, does it mean he didn't want to c*m in my mouth or i was doing it wrong	i've been with him a year and i've only given him head twice (including that time) and the first time he really enjoyed it (there was a 2 month gap between the first time and the second)   we was having sex but stopped before he came so i could give him head, he didn't c*m in my mouth the first time i done it, i stopped before he could so could it mean he was just being polite and stuff   or was i really bad at it?
20080401201057AA8tULR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Crush or friend?	So I moved in to school a week early this year and the football team was already living here for practice. I met a guy that lives down the hall from me during that week and we hung out a few times, and he would always tease me and make fun of me. Then my (now ex) boyfriend came to visit and this guy teased me ALOT about him, he would always say something about the boyfriend to me. Then school started and we didn't see each other that much, even though we have one class together. Today he came up to me and just started talking as if no time had gone by and he then walked me to my class.  Does he have a crush on me (or did he?) or he just a really nice guy looking for a friend??
20080403163456AABurIR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend has trouble getting turned on... help?	Ive been going out with this girl for about 6 months, were both 18 and since shes been on birth control, started about 2 months ago, shes been really hard to turn on. She tells me that its not that im not attractive to her anymore or that she doesnt love me, its something wrong with her. She will still have intercourse but i can tell its just hurting her if anything and shes not exactly enjoying it as much as she use to. I do everything i should to try to turn her on, i complement her, kiss her gently, but nothing seems to work. Is there anything scientifically proven which these may be signs of or is it me? She claims to the bottom of her heart its not and im not sure if i should believe that. I would hate to think its something with her. Can somebody help? how do i turn her on? suggestions?
20080403165255AA2Pcf8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need your quick look at this question about a party.  Give me some ideas please. THX?	I have been invited to a pool party.The party is for one of my good friends [a girl] and there are also gonna be lots of single girls. I'm 22. I know how to deal with girls. I mean I'm not the virgin guy, but I'm looking for some funny stuff that can attract the girls. you know what I mean? Like girls usually are attracted to guys who have a good sense of humor and do some stuff that make them laugh. I have some stuff to say and do, that always makes the girls laugh and get attracted, but I'm looking for some more. Tell me anything that has worked out for you before to make a girl laugh. Please be specific. I know this is a bit fake, but the fact is that guys will usually try to do anything to catch a girl they want.   All answers are appreciated.

Hes always calling me wanting me to go places with him (swimming,cookouts,movies) by hisself or with his friends and he always introduces me to his friends as his girlfriend. When we talk he tells me all his deepest goals and fears and stuff and he tells me that one day he want me to marry him because he can feel we meant to be together. But the thing is he lives with his babymama and has 2 kids by her(2yrs,1yr old) but why would he do all that and introduce me to his friends without the fear of one of them telling her?

Almost two years ago I broke up with the love of my life, who was my first love. Scents he has moved on. I've had a relationship scents then too but it didnt work out and I realize that even after two long years I'm still madly in love with my EX      I confessed my feelings and ask if he would come back, he said no, he see's a future with the woman he is with now. But he was insistant that we remain friends and keep in contact. Even when I told him it might be to painful for me.   To this day if I call him and ask for advice he will stop whatever he's doing and help me.      For example I needed help looking for a new compter I asked what was the best place to buy one. Not only did he tell me a good place but went the extra mile and personally picked out one perfect for my price range. When I offer to pay him for his help he always tells me I could never afforde him      This cant be normal, do you think he still has feelings for me or is he being super nice?

We dated for 6 months and everything was great. He broke up with me because the he felt like he had no time for a relationship. We’ve been hanging out a lot lately, kissing, hugging and stuff. He said he still had love for me and misses me all the time but has not said anything about getting back together. In my heart I know him and I are perfect for each other. I’m wondering if I should stick it out until he is done with school (he has a year left) and continue being “friends” or move on with my life?

20080707124009AA4s7MW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why Dont People Believe There Does Exist Women Who Strongly Share The Views Of Men On What The Womans Role Is?	It is unreal the number of times Ive been "assumed" of as being a man after posting one of my questions just because it seems to be a mans P.O.V.       I do have opinions that differ from other women, and theres nothing wrong with it.       I do believe that women should cater to men, its the best way of keeping him, but because the word "cater" means "to serve" the feedback that I got from most women was negative, and some men accused me of being a male because women dont think this way.      The truth is: I am a woman and I do believe there are roles that only women should play in the relationship, but there is for men too.      I agree that men should help to cook, clean and care for the children, but since these are wives home duties, the men should help out BUT only when they can. Men should work outside the home and come home to what his wifes duties provide, a clean home, well behaved and fed children and a hot meal & bath for her man.      Our mothers did it for our fathers, why cant we?
20080707132701AAaHptk	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can you help me make sense of my current situation?	first off, i have been with my current boyfriend for a year and a half. First we were friends and then when he broke up with his gf of 4 years we started to hang out and then we became a couple. In January we moved in together to a new state to start our lives together. He is my first long term relationship and I thought that it was a perfect match. I gave him all the love I had because he became my best friend and only friend. I thought I found my soulmate and I could never be happier. He is a taurus and i am a virgo, he is always the center of attention and way more conversational than me. I have looked into our sign compatability and it says we should be perfect for eachother. I love being around him when its just us, but when we are around other people I feel inferior so I dont talk. I have become so introverted around him and other people it makes me sick. I used to be a bubbly happy person who like to joke around. Now I dont find happiness in anything, not even him........
20080707133621AAjXp8X	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Who do i pick?!?!?	ok here is the thing. when i was only 13 i liked this guy that is 10 years older than me. well my parents would not go for that so i didnt even try to date him. then a couple years later i started dating my husband, we have been married for seven years now. me and my husband started having some problems a couple years ago. he is a great guy but i just dont know if my love for him is as strong as it once was. i also see alot of his dad and grandfather in him. which is not to good because they are not very loving to their wifes. what i mean by this is when their wifes cook they dont appreciate it, they put it down. and they also put them down alot about everything they do. they look at the bad in their wifes and hardly ever the good. i never see them hug, kiss or even hold hands. they are always grumpy. now my husband can be caring but he is more like them all the time. i dont want to grow old with someone who will not appreciate me and the things i do for them and be in a bad mood all the time. i have talked to my husband about this and he said he will not be like them but he doesnt see what he does and dont want to open his eyes to it.       well the first of last year the guy that i liked when i was 13 kinda came back in the picture. this is after i started having marriage problems. we did get into contact with one another but not physical just talking on the phone. he was someone good to talk to. i had no one else to really talk to about my problems. well i decided that it was best for me not to talk to him anymore because i felt it was unfair to my husband, and i did tell my husband about it.       ever since i talked to the guy i have really strong feelings for him. but i dont want to leave my husband at the same time. i dont want to hurt my husband. if i was to go then it would upset A LOT of people. but i am not %100 happy with everything. we do have a little girl and that is another thing that keeps me with my husband because i dont know what i would do if i did not see her everyday.       i guess i have went on and on but i dont know what i need to do. i have prayed to the Lord and i feel he was leading me were i needed to go but at the same time it didnt feel right. so i dont know what to do. can someone please help me out.

It's been driving me crazy! :[?	okay so me & my boyfriend are together for about 8 months. we used to fight alot like everyday. & recently i realized i really am love with him. but since like a week ago, he doesn't really call anymore. it just seems to me that he doesn't love me anymore or not as much or doesn't care. but when i talk to him about it, he tells me that he loves me with all his heart & will never leave me. & that he really cares about me & that he'll do anything for me.

20080803211151AAgLqfg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to tell if guy friend is anorexic?	Hey ok so how do I tell if my guy friend is anorexic. I'm a guy and don't know much about eating disorders but the kid is kinda my best friend so I feel like I should say something.      Is it possible for guys to be anorexic?      Also, what are the symptoms? Like do they just not eat or do anorexics display a certain behavior?            Two weeks ago he, me and my girlfriend and his girlfriend all went and got pizza. I had a regular slice and he only had a diet coke! He said he wasn't hungry but he like never eats. When we hang out and we eat his excuse is "Oh I just ate," or "Oh I'm not hungry.No Thanks!" or "Oh thats not healthy."      I THINK I heard him telling his sister(Who is 10 years old!) to stop eating pretzels because "Eating is not cool."         Anyway I want to know, what are the symptoms of male anorexia? And How do I say it to him without offending him?      I think he has lost a lot of weight recently and it doesnt look safe to me. He is 6 foot and is and always was at a good weight. He would eat a lot but never really put on weight. And now his new thing is not eating.    What do I do?      Thanks!            P.S-He is a teenager, were all 15, if that makes a difference in the psycological part of it.

20080804151718AALJRAL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Someone please explain this love article for me?	if you are willing to read a somewhat long story...then go ahead, just a warning.       This is from GQ, the one where Seth Rogen is on the cover. Its called, Summer Love Overheated. Its about a man (Junot Diaz) who meets this really hot girl whose smart, and tolerable for his violent mood swings. it pretty much describes what she is like, then he is saying that his attitude toward her isn't working, and a part of him knows that this amazing relationship is going to end, but another (bigger) part of him believes in the better, and happy ending. even she knows that their fling is in trouble.       so she suggests a "Special Day" where they go to her favorite place (lake, park, etc) and while they are there some thing happens...      "We sat down on the bench looking out over the lake, the only people in the park, it seemed, but before we could even say 'start the reconciliation' this outdoorsy white dude bounded out of nowhere and right in front of us started throwing a stick into the water for his two dogs. The bigger dog, a spaniel, would jump back before the poor smaller dog could even get five feet out into the shore. This happened a couple of times; the smaller dog would start paddling back and then the stick would fly over its head, so of course it would dutifully turn around and start swimming back out toward the stick only to be beaten to it by the spaniel."       "After about five of these throws, the white guy was satisfied, and he and his big dog started to walk away, leaving the little dog still struggling the water. I was the only one who noticed the poor f*ck go under. "Your dog', i told the guy. Fate would have it that he was the lone mother-f*cker in Holland who didn't speak English. 'What is it?' my girlfriend asked me. 'his dog is drowning,' i screamed, and that's when she cried to him in dutch and the dude, giving out and anguished cry, jumped right in to the lake. Brought his dog out in no time at all. My girl was saying 'Dios mio'. The little guy, some kind of beagle mix, couldnt have been under for more than ten seconds, but he was dead as f*ck. Eyes glassy and everything, the color of old smoke, water pouring out his nose holes. White boy tried to blow air into the little guys lungs, tried squeezing his ribs and hold him upside down, but the perrito was dead. white boy said something to us, miserable, and the girlfriend translated. Its not even his dog. It was his girlfriends. He was just taking it out for a walk. Right there my girl burst into tears. Well, that was it for our special day. that was it for my reconciliation trip. that was it for our relationship."       why did the gf break up with him? and what do u think? if you would like the full article email me.

Just meeting and getting to know someone then going from there. Why are most online women that we seem to share common interests or even physically attracted to, so cold? (there is a real person behind there) they don't even respond to a simple: Hi you seem interesting, i would like to get to know you more. meaning just that.....not, wanna meet up, go out, wanna have sex, etc. Basically just like meeting and talking to someone at....a bar for instance. I love meeting new people. there putting them selves out there, like me. so what the deal. even so when you get past that first awkward IM, phone call, email etc, its like "ok bye, ttyl". No working up to a: well i have to go soon or i have to be here at this time. its like a freaking dropped cell call. is it me? wtf? its probably stupid and pointless to ask this type of question "Online" but i figured i would give it a shot. Females: tips secretes, etc. what is going on up there when your online. and why? Thanks.

20081018125457AAclTAM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this relationship worth saving?	I'm 27. My boyfriend is 28. We have been together for 4 months and I think it could be a perfect relationship. But there's a couple problems.  For starters, we rarely see eachother.  I've seen him 3 times in 3 weeks. He has a very busy work schedule and I'm in school.  He lives with his parents so he can save money and I haven't yet been to his house. He hasn't invited me even though I've asked.  He said he wants me to meet his family during a fun occasion.  I don't understand that logic.  Also he rarely calls. He says he's not a phone person.  I haven't heard from him in 2 days even though I've called and left messages. I'm torn up and don't know if I am overreacting..

20081117155447AAbzRtK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Question about swinger friends?	My wife and I are friends with another couple who are swingers. She told me when I first met them that they were swingers. We rarely ever see this couple, but I have thought about developing a friendship simply because they happen to live nearby us, while most of our other friends live 45+ minutes away. It's just easier to hang out with people who are near by.       So about a month ago we were at a social gathering and the swinger wife was telling me that she and her husband had talked about swinging for years but she just recently got the courage to do it. Now she's all about it. She asked if we were into it, and I could tell she really wanted me. My wife later explained that this couple had only invited females into their bedroom and just recently got into the couples thing. So that cleared up my first question.      Now I am wondering if I should bother being friends with them. My wife and I are not at a point in our relationship where we are willing to consider the swinging lifestyle. Part of me wants to be friends with them, but another part of me says they are only interested in us for our hot bodies. I guess what I want to know is if we should spend more time with this couple for the sake of having more friends close by or if it would only cause problems.
20090103214906AAo0t5m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A girl I hardly know, glares at me...why?	If you've already read this, feel free to just skip this question lol. Anyway:      So I've barely spoken/talked to this girl who's in one of my classes.   She's cute, though, and I wouldn't mind getting to know her better...   The thing is, every time I've come across her, whether it was passing   her in the hall, or coming in the classroom and happened to catch her stare, she's always glaring at me... like literally looking into my eyes and glaring at me, it's like a spiteful, "wtf are you doing" glare... in turn, I get flustered and confused, and just avoid eye contact ... (oh and btw, I'm 99% sure there wasn't something goofy on my face or that she heard a bad rumor about me or that she was squinting to see something, we were right next to each other)      Does this necessarily mean I don't have a chance and should just move on? I'll talk to her, mind you, but I'm just a bit discouraged that she might already think I'm weird somehow lol xD Is it highly possible she might think I like her, and therefore not be interested, which is why she would glare at me ?

20081004005302AAd00AB	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What would set one ex apart from another?	My ex and I broke up 7 weeks ago. He had another ex, before me: who only lasted LESS than a week. Him and I lasted two months. I know it's not very long. He always talked crap on her with his friends. However, my mutual friend told me that my ex never talks about me in a bad way. What would set one girl apart from another?
20081028203552AAc0dKL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I give him a piece of my mind?	Okay so this guy i wasn't officially going out with all the sudden started to ignore me and finally said (through a text message) that he no longer liked me.  However, i find this to be most likely not true since the entire summer he sent me love letters and never stopped talking about me to his friends... it was a bit obsessive actually...      anyway, should i send him a message and give him a piece of my mind?
20090104213145AAYIBNq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So we're going on our first date tomorrow, and she's already texting stuff like this?	I saw her for 20 minutes today (day before our first date), she was with her family and a friend of hers so I didn't want to be awkward and just gave her an one armed hug over her shoulder as we left...      20 minutes later she texted me commenting on the half hug, and I promised I'd give her a full one tomorrow... she asked for more than one hug, and asked if there was anything I'd want in return since fair is fair.  I said back hugging is something we both want but a kiss would be nice, to which she just was like 'awww'.  She also had been hinting at cuddling earlier today too...      Is she seriously already hinting as far as she seems like?  We were texting for like 5 hours already today, and I do really like her, this is just going a little overboard if I'm not just overreacting.  Any suggestions?

20081009081015AAFkhM5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do if you found out a guy you were dating was slow, mentally?	Lets say you meet a guy/girl and they seem totally normal. He/she seems kinda ditzy, but you always have a great time with him/her. They make you feel great, better than anyone else, and you fall in love with them. He/she loves you more than you could ever imagine.      But when school comes around you find out they are in "special" classes because of a learning disability and he/she is kinda slow. Would that change things?
20081228234816AAtkDfO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What is happening with men these days? (Mature answers only, please)?	Okay, I am a divorced single mother in my 30s.  I would love to be involved a loving, functional relationship with an honest, stable, mature, and hard working man.  I date, but lately, I have found that a lot of men are looking for a hand-out.  I do not mind helping out if there is an emergency.  But it seems at times that a man will $50 here, a $100 there, you to death, and it is like they expect it.  I stopped seeing a guy after he "needed" about $700.  I really was trying to be there for him and help him, but he still had attitude and excuses.  He never even offered to take me out.  Then, another man that I knew previously, we started going out, and within 2 weeks, he was asking for $10 and $20.  After $50, I told him that it wasn't going to work out.  I went out to a club last night.  I met a guy.  He seemed nice enough, so I gave him my number.  During our first real conversation, he asked what I was cooking for dinner.  I told him, and he asked if he could come over for dinner..... Hunh?  I know that there is a recession, and times are hard right now, but I am a single mother of 3, and work hard everyday.  What is up with the MEN looking for the hand out?

For example,  I just dropped my book, and my dad suddenly yells "WHAT WAS THAT ?!" really loud, & I say "It was nothing dad, just my book!" and he thinks I'm yelling at him, and he goes like "ARE YOU YELLING AT ME ? Are you talking back?!?!" I then go like "No. I always talk like this, I thought you couldn't hear me from the other room so I raised my voice" then he gets really mad, and says, "____ come over here now!" then he gets the belt out and he wanted to hit me. I started to cry, and said, "I didn't do anything..." and he yells more and says "DON'T TALK BACK TO ME, I thought you dropped the laptop so I asked, don't yell at me!", and I said "I thought you wouldnt hear me if i didnt yell..." andd he said "Don't talk back to me" again, and i went in my room crying, and he says, "come back here or i'll hit you!" but i don't wanna ... he didn't even hit me.         I feel like killing myself everytime something little like this happens.. is something wrong with me ?

My fiance and I have been arguing off and on for the past 8 1/2 months and well.......it's been 4 days and we haven't had (you know)! I am frustrated and don't have any intentions on cheating but the fact that he doesn't initiate bothers me and how he blows me off! I am not a needy person but lately I feel unfulfilled by him as I used too. He's a rock emotionally and I often am trying to please him and end up annoying him, which in turn I am even more disappointed. I just don't get him! Any man would be jumping at sex!?

20081112154751AAXTtP0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys.... What do you think? ..... Would you date me?	Guys.... What do you think? ..... Would you date me?      My hair color is medium blonde. It is pin straight and it's length is slightly below my shoulders. I style it many different ways, usually half ponytail or blown out with slight curls for parties and messy buns for everyday and school.      My eyes change color with what I chose to wear or, supposedly, my mood. They are most often a clear light green with yellow and hazel speckles. The can turn a dark blue green to dark green to medium blue green.       My teeth are perfectly straight, thanks to two years of braces and at night retainers. I have dimples, which everyone says are sexii or cute .       My lips are always coated with a flavored lip gloss, usually from Victoria's Secret and sometimes CO Bigelow. My favorite is Carmel Apple from Victoria's Secret and Chocolate Mint from CO Bigelow.       I am 5'4. I weigh 112 pounds.       I'm toned from swimming, running and horsebackriding. I have breasts (my bra's: 32C) hips and a but, but what girl doesn't???      I like to wear not to baggy not to tight sweat pants. I wear all different washes in jeans as long as they are low rise.       I love tight shirts, that are mostly modest. I like to wear extremely low but layered shirts, too.         I am talkative, adventerous, and lovavble. I am trusting and honest. I love to be loved and love to love[if that makes sense]. I'm not smothering and I'm not the jealous type.      What do you think? Would you date me?      PS: I'm sorry I can't provide a picture. Where would I be able to share one, if you know?      If you could explain what you say, or just state that's a good or bad complement.      I'm not always sure what a guy means. Like "interesting" can hae so many different meanings. "Sexii" can also have many different connotations.       Thanks agan for looking at this and for your opinions.      Luv ya all for answering me! Thx!

20081123030407AAKGCwJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband is unable to satisfy me. What do i do?	I've been married 4 years, to my childhood sweetheart of 7 years. we love each other. But since 4 yrs now, i have communicated to him abut how I am dissatisfied with our post-marital sex life. Before marriage, it rocked- he could go on all night!    I am not very much into porn, though I have resorted to it as a last option, or say when one of us was travelling with work. However, I had earlier in the marriage confronted him, and he had confessed then that he would view porn in his office. Obviously, since he was busy jerking off, he wasn't as interested in me any more. however, he promised to stop watching it... (i dont trust him 100%, but hey big deal, i've enjoyed a few times as well- only when I have been totally frustrated by his lack of interest in me.)    My point and problem here is: I haven't let porn affect my sex drive or interest in him. Then why he doing so?    The funny part is I am 6 months pregnant now, and he is the one with decreased libido. I could have sex every day, multple times in one night, whereas he has shown interest only say, once in 2 weeks! I have tried to talk to him about it- he says he is not interested because lately we've been fighting a lot and he cannot get himself to have sex with me. But he said he jerks off sometimes when alone- say after i've left for work. Fair enough. But what about all these last 4 years?? And how do i seek satisfaction?      I ask: what do men want? and what do i do? Should he or me (or both of us) see a Sexpert? please help. I am going nuts with this lack of passion in my life. Should i simply watch porn and satisfy my urges?

20081007234137AAzUApl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Umm..Boy advice please?	Short Little Story =]      Okay. So, I’m a freshman. I know this senior guy from debate. We weren’t really close, but I was having a bad day at one of our tournaments. He was determined to make me feel batter. So, we talked, and I suppose that night he wrote a song about it. I told him about my life and he told me about his. We talked about our problems, and religious stuff. He told me today and sang it while he played his guitar. It was so cute. It was about how God was still there, and I could always turn to him. It really made me rethink my life in general. It was amazing. Then, after school we were talking and I said how wanted to go to formal, but my mom wanted to meet and approve my date before she’d buy my dress. I said how I was annoyed and no guy would want to meet a mom. He said he loved meeting moms, and he would meet her and then I could hook up with someone else. So, now for questions. =)   1. Do you think he likes me?   2. Should I ask him if he will go to formal with me?   3. And should I give him this poem I wrote?   4. What do you think of the poem?   5. THANKS!! =D   --------------------------------------...   Forgetting his forgiving ways,   I turned away from an important friend,    I didn’t recognize he was always there,   And will be ‘til the end.      My life had taken a turn for the worse,   And all my hope had been lost,   I thought he’d given up on me,   Every part of my faith had been tossed.      But then this amazing person,    Opened up my eyes,   His words changed my perspective,    A miracle in disguise.      I thought my future had been ruined for good,   But I couldn’t have been more wrong,   It’s just the very beginning, and one incredible person,   Showed me this through one special song.      I thank him with all my heart,   For lifting my spirit in hard times,   I wouldn’t have realized without him,   And so I show my gratitude in rhymes.      I’ve always had one amazing friend,   And now I know I have two,   I appreciate your guidance,   I couldn’t have done this without you.

20081028204210AAjAbz0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does this look mean?	So I have this friend that I hang out with regularly, and recently I realized that we often share this silent stare at each other. It isn't an awkward silence or anything, It is just when he randomly gets quiet and looks at me in an endearing way and I just gaze straight into his eyes. It seems to last however long I want it to last because i am always the one to break the intensity, he never seems like he ever wants to budge. Sometimes it is when we are talking and sometimes it is when I am working on something when he is around. When it happens it is as if the world doesn't exist around us, like it is just the two of us.       Here comes the catch... He is married! AHHHHH!

20081228230254AA8rnFs	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why does he react this way whenever I mentioned other guys to him if he's married?	I long distance friend I have, we met 2 years ago. He's military and I work as a contractor in the base he was duty when I met him. Since then I contacted him and been in touch by email.       Sometimes we talk on the phone and chat a little bit. We are friends who enjoy each others communications. But, I've noticed that every time I talk about me meeting or hanging out with other military guys he acts like "whatever" or "U-huh" like the time I told him I was in touch with another guy and he said "cool", in that tone guys do when they don't like talking about something, or when I said I was invited to their xmas party and he went "Uh-huh, so did you guys have a good time?" in a tone you know?      Why would he be this way if he's married and we've always talked about we being friends, nothing else.      I gotta say he's very protective of me, and cares about whatever happens to me.....I don't know, even at long distance.

20081003212002AAT88nz	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Could I be addicted to sex?	I'm 21. I live with my boyfriend, and I'm also Bi-sexual. I masturbate at least twice a day. And I'm not talking 10-20 minutes, I masturbate for at least an hour, while watching porn online. Even though I have a very serious boyfriend, I've gone to other male friend's houses by myself looking for sex. It has never happened! But I know if I went, and my friends tried to come onto me, I can't say no. I can not say no to sex. I even felt guilty, as if I had cheated on him, even though nothing ever happened. I've been late to work because I was masturbating. I like to be tied down, spanked, whipped, hair pulled, even anal. Tonight I was at work and it was all I could do to not go to the bathroom to play with myself. And because of that, I felt like I was having withdraw symptoms. My skin was crawling, I was short of breath, and I was pulsating in a place that I'm sure you can imagine for yourself. My boyfriend just thinks I have a high sex drive, but I think it's more serious. It never stops. I never stop wanting more sex, and I'm rarely satisfied after sex. We are intimate around 3 times a week. And if I am satisfied, it's only for a few minutes, then I want more.

Wait for the guy who kisses your forehead just because.       Who wants to show you off to the world when you're    in a t-shirt and sweats.       Who holds your hand in front of his friends.       Who thinks you're just as pretty without makeup.       Who is constantly reminding you how much he    loves you and how lucky he is to have you.

I tried calling her but her sister keeps answering the phone and telling me I'm a horrible man for making her cry! WHAT THE HELL DID I DO!?

I love his soft green eyes. He is the man of my dreams. He has the cutest freckles. I love his smile too. He also has such beautiful skin too. I love it when he looks pale. Not the type of pale when you look sick, but the way Edward Cullen has his pale skin. I imagined Adam Levine to look like Edward Cullen. He was the first thing I had in mind when I read Twilight. And I imagined myself as Bella. I have brown hair, brown eyes and cream skin like she does.       I'm so in love with Adam.

20081009084325AAAL3jx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship advice please :(?	Hello everybody. I feel really bad for sticking this on the internet but i've bored all of my mates with this particular problem for a long time and need some advice.   I have been with my boyfriend for 4 years. However, for a long time i've felt that somethings not right. I just don't feel a strong enough connction to him. When I get this feeling, I think about it so much it makes me ill. It comes and goes but if i really loved him surely I wouldn't feel this way. He really loves me and is in many respects the perfect boyfriend. Thats what makes the situation so difficult :(.    I'm 21 and hes 26 so he wants to settle down. I've never been single really (about 3 months after breaking up with my previous bf of 3 years) and I just don't feel ready to settle down. Its tearing me up inside because hes so lovely, but this has been going on for such a long time now that I just don't know what I think or feel anymore.    Anybody got any advice or been in the same boat before?

20081013095024AAiQ8nI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do married people only want to swing with other married couples?	Last year,I tried my hand at meeting swinging couples. I was a single guy at the time,and none of the people I encountered wanted a single guy in the mix. They wanted either a single girl or a couple.Now,I'm 27 and I recently got back into the "swing" of things(yes,a pun). I met a girl who turned into a "friend" with benefits and asked her how she felt about meeting other couples and she was all for it. The first three couples we met,all said they'd rather "play" with another married couple,so we went buy cheap rings at Wal-Mart to "pretend" we're married,and ended up "playing" with the next couple we met. Now,everytime we meet someone,we always wear our rings and pretend we're married. My question is,why do married people only want to swing with other married couples?

20081018121453AAUsZEv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need MAJOR help!!!?	Hi people. Ok, so i started college this fall and i met this guy whos in my class, Frank. We now hangout a lot and im starting to think he might like me but im not too sure. One time he called me and was like what are you doing and i was like im at home and he then came to my house and came in my house and met my parents and stayed for a little, and then he asked me to dinner one night just me and him. I just went to the mall just me and him the other night. He's really cool and has an awesome personality, BUT he is always saying stuff about other girls to try and make me jealous and i dont know why he does this, it is so annoying. I enjoy chilling with him and stuff but i think he might like me which is fine because i like him too but i dont know if he likes me for sure.    Sometimes he looks at other girls and just whistles, but he does this when were around other people, but when its just me and him he sees girls and comments on how skanky they look. And the other girls he talks to are his friends. He makes comments about my girl friends like oh i got your friends number or he'll say stupid stuff like im going out wiht your friend tonight and then he'll say just kidding. But, still it bothers me even if hes kidding. When its just me and him he acts so cool but when we're around other people he acts stupid. WHat do you think about this?  THANKS IN ADVANCE!!

20081117202059AAUCtaI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do if I haven't seen or talk to my boyfriend for a week?	I can't believe I feel like this, I'm suppose to act strong and not needy but your feelings is your feelings. I do as much I can to keep my mind off by hanging out with my friends but I can't keep the fact away that I need his attention. I have got into an argument with him before about not spending that much time with me ( I don't mean like everyday 24/7). A girl gotta feel appreciated by her boyfriend, right? He told me he want to start all over and do it my way, even though he doesn't have a cellphone, he used his sister phone to give me a call. I LOVE IT! it makes me happy to have a boyfriend that cares. Suddenly, he stopped calling me and it was this week. I try to visit his work to see if he's free to hang out but he wasn't there. I know he's a busy man but if he loves me, he won't have a problem fitting me into his schedule. He's a really caring boyfriend but I don't think I can feel like this most of the time, there are times I just want a break. I can't do it, how can I see him or talk to him if he DOESN'T have a phone? he have a myspace though, he haven't comment me that much no more. Don't say he's cheating because I DO trust him.
20081117212807AAzlfMz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	******%%%%((((((((((Easy question))))))))))))))))))))))…	      I told this man that I liked him Because he thought that I didn’t like him and I know that he likes me, he asked me out on a date but I had to cancel it because I had to go overseas because My grandmother was very Old and sick he said that he would see me once Im back. I tired talking to him when I was overseas but he stooped talking to me for no reason for 3whole months he did not talk with me. He works in the army so I tried to talk with him and he never replied. Therefore, I wrote him another Email after that asking him if he was ok. And saying that I was concerned about him. He did not answer. He was on line 4weeks ago and I know that he saw that “Email” So I wrote Him one finally Email Just asking how he was and if we were still “friends” with me? He did not answer and he was talking with all his other friends expect ME. I felt depressed so I deleted him that was 2weeks ago. I moved on & I forgot all about him. Then today he sent me a friend request over face book, asking to be friends with me again and he left me a Message saying ( SO “DONT KLNOW WHY YOU DELETED ME AY!! HARSH,)                why did he come back? After all this Time and what should I do now? 
20081117203133AARO5WR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend is 35 he wants a break? After 2 1/2 years?!?!?	My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 1/2 years..I have a 7 year old daughter ( whose father isnt in the picture) We have a great relationship except for a few moments which every relationship goes through. We just celebrated my daughters bday together and he even bought her a gift. I brough up the "marriage" talk to him and he said that he doesnt want to plan it all out..why can't it just happen when it happens... that he didnt know if it was going to be in a month, 6 months a year..etc.. He lives an hour away from me and I commute there every weekend..I told him that it was becoming hard on me being that I work all week then have to pack every friday and drive all the way there...I told him what I wanted and I told him to figure out what he wants...So Halloween night my daughter and I went there to go trick or treating with him.. he wasnt himself..very distant and quiet.. We got back and I put my daughter to bed and I went and talked to him..He said he wants a break he needs time away to see how he feels.. That he doesnt know what he wants...So i cryed and said ok and left the following morning. I havent heard from him since... Not even a text nothing.. What should I do? Should I contact him? How long should I give him? He assured me that he wasnt going to be seeing anyone else and that he needs to see how he feels... Do you think he is just really breaking up with me but the coward way out?? He is going to be 35 years old so I hope he wouldnt be that immature like that..I am just lost right now very confused ..what would you guys do?? I cant just go out and party it up like the other posts say b/c I am a Mom and I just don't do that..So please help!!! Thanks               Today I text him just asking him how he was doing..he said fine I guess..under the circumstances...and he said he needs a few more weeks to see how it is without me...wtf???? how do i take that..what the hell does that mean..
20081117214359AA51wvI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He says I'm hard to figure out?	What does it mean when a guy who I have been talking to for about a year tells me I'm hard to figure out?  I ask him what he means by that and he says he can't explain it and I'm just hard to figure out.  Could there be feelings that he is hiding?

20081126204858AAxfYzi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me? HELP!!!!!!!?	Well i have this friend and she and I get along great. We have a lot in common and we hang out with other friends mostly. She openly talks about this guy she likes from another town, but we talk and text all the time and we sort of flirt and I really like her. The guy she says she likes cant make it for the school dance at our school so i asked her to go just as friends and she said yea it would be fun. Her friend (also my friend) kept telling me to ask her to the dance and is always "joking" about me liking her. I don't really know what to think... does she like me? is she confused about me and the other guy? what should i do?   
20081130195403AAN2mDv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What can i Do about my fiance and I fighting a lot? Should we break up? Help!?	ok..      so i have been with my fiance since may. that's when we met.. and got engaged in july. we live together and have since we met. (i know thats strange lol)   Hes 26 and i am 20.   he even got my name in a heart tattooed on his back.   we plan to get married in june.      so...   here's the thing.      we fight about things all the time. stupid things. he LIES about the stupidest things. it really pisses me off.      like, he'll lie about what hes doing at home when im not there.      one day i called and im like what r u doing? and hes like reading a book. and im like yeah? why do i hear you typing on the computer in the background?      and he wont let me hang out with any male friends without him. it drives me crazy!      ohh and last week he called me "Nikkie" May. my middle name IS NOT may. and he swears he doesnt know a may. so i think ok... he slipped? THEN he does it four more times last week. claming he didnt- but trust me, i heard it.      so tonight we get into a fight.. and ive been trying really hard not to yell/scream at him. im just so sick of it. anyway, i asked a friend to come hang out in like January (they live in the state i use to live in) and he freaks. so i tell him how im sick of the yelling and stuff and that he needs to leave and go to his moms or where ever.. and he wouldnt leave.      ok, fine, whatever. i told him, you cant keep stressin me like this, it isnt fair to always be hollerin and screaming at him.      his answer? LETS GO GET MARRIED TOMORROW..      yeah right. after a fight i wanna rush down to be ur wife.      No.                     so like, what do u think?   i want your opinion of this whole situation.      and maybe how i can get him to like.. not always fight with me or lie to me.      thanks
20081207151542AApGdL4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	IS THIS A GOOD IDEA? IF MY BOYFRIEND DOESN'T SHAPE UP WITHIN ONE WEEK I'M DUMPING HIM?	I love him more than anyone, but I can't take it anymore :(   *He constantly ignores me even when I tell him simply, "i love you."   *The last time I saw him I tried to initiate sex and he rejected me and told me to cut it out and I was totally embarrassed.    *He asks for bl0wj0bs all the time, but says my vagina smells so he'll turn me down for sex a lot :( It hardly smells (esp. as bad as his penis)   *When we started dating he wanted to buy me an xbox 360...now when i even mention that I like a psp he tells me it's stupid and a rip-off.   *We went shopping and he asked me what videogames I liked...so that he knew what to buy his sister, but he told me he bought me a bunch of cheap stuff...I mean his sister is awesome, but that was kinda rude...esp. since xmas is my fav day ever:(   *If I start crying he tells me I shouldn't cry or I'll have more wrinkles...I'm 18 and don't have wrinkles. I have eyelids!   *He wears the same clothing three days in a row, hardly brushes his teeth, and is too lazy to even go to the bathroom to pee...he uses a bottle!   *I always have to text him first and he hardly responds...   He says he loves me, but is just really busy with schoolwork this semester. Well, his finals are finished early this week so I'm giving him a week to shape up. I'm not telling him...I'm just doing this because as much as I love him, I can't take this anymore.   Good idea?    Thanks ^^
20081229213854AAtPWyP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My wife won't touch me so what can I do?	My wife and I have been together for about 7 years.  When we met, she was a heavy-drinking party girl and a nymphomaniac, to boot.  I guess I was the male equivalent, just not so boisterous.  We even gradually grew together: from friends, to f*** buddies (to infer the vernacular), to a monogamous couple as we matured.  For 5 solid years thereafter, we were very romantic and had an excellent love life.  Then began the steady decline.  Now, I can't touch her with a 10 foot pole.  We have had sex 2 times since a year ago, last November (I've counted).  The last time (February) ended abruptly because she violently demanded that I stop.  I have tried wooing her, romancing her, dropping the subject and giving her space, every suggestion or cliche piece of worthless advice in the book.  She continues with the "it's not you, it's me" line.  She responds to suggestions of therapy by throwing things.  Even trying to talk to her about it just ends up in 2 hours of me getting yelled at and a bad night.  The whole time she has, at least, remained otherwise loving and even jealous (sometimes inexplicably so); but, now even that is waning.  Lately, she is becoming emotionally distant and secretive, composing anonymous e-mails at night, and she has changed all the passwords... even some that I need to use!  The only comforting things (I guess) are that she is still jealous and she never leaves the house... so I know she's not cheating.  At least, not yet.  I'm at an impasse.  I'm a 30 year old man whose sex drive and need for affection is not diminishing.  I hate seeming selfish, but something's gotta give.  Cheating on my wife is not an option, but this is getting rediculous.  I know someone has already asked this question on here but none of the answers help.  I need a second opinion.  Or a third, fouth, whatever.
20090103164446AAgK2iC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Unstable relationship?	Ok. So I like this girl who is currently going out with a guy. The thing is, their relationship is kinda unstable, they fight a lot and stuff.   The girl and me, we're good friends. What and how should I do ?   Thanks in advance.
20090105205619AAQ6kl9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Three weeks into dating someone..should I ask where this is going? or let him make the move? ?	We've been on maybe a little more than a handful of dates, extravagent dates. I am 21, he's 32. I am not sure how he feels about me just assuming that since we are still continuing to casually date he's interested ;) But, I am not sure how I should approach it. I'd like it to be more and if its not, I don't want to continue thinking there is a chance..Any advice?    -Head Over Heels
