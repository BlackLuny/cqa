AA11307940	Could be if you are using the New Mail, it is difficult to load on most older computers, it needs Adobe Flash Player and Javascript upgraded and a very fast internet service. Click Mail Classic at the top of the mail screen and follow the prompt. If this is not the problem, then it's because Yahoo has been doing maintenance and upgrades to their sites causing many problems for all of us lately. You can access your mail here for now, it's basic, no frills, but it works.  <a href="http://us.m.yahoo.com/p/mail">http://us.m.yahoo.com/p/mail</a>  or:  <a href="http://uk.m.yahoo.com/p/mail">http://uk.m.yahoo.com/p/mail</a>  or:  <a href="http://de.m.yahoo.com/p/mail">http://de.m.yahoo.com/p/mail</a>|`|CQzs2hCbaa	try switching to the classic version

This is the 29th and it is not repaired.<br>  I have reported people for questions that embarrassed me . They were not taken off. I have reported people for using the F word and talking about things I would not repeat. They stayed.<br>  I have thought about leaving too. I don't know.

fc0d67c70eea7ade396d194de9999650aa	Je mehr Werbung, desto mehr User, desto schnellere Antworten(über die Qualit?t der Antworten kann man streiten)....Meiner Meinung nach ist die Werbung(oder Kommerz) gut für Clever|`|AA10001391	Ich hab auf Clever noch kaum Werbung gesehen - h?chstens ab und zu links unten auf der Startseite. St?rt überhaupt nicht.<br>  Ich denke Yahoo! schaltet da erst mal keine Werbung, um zu vermeiden, dass die Leute abgeschreckt werden, die das st?ren k?nnte. Schlie?lich soll doch Clever erst mal wachsen bevor es dann richtig Kohle abwirft :-).|`|a40627217c133cb7268171d4715f098aaa	SEHR VIEL. Google kontrolliert den Markt bis jetzt, aber mit dieser Idee kommt Yahoo zurück. Content um sonst, dazu tausende von Mitgliedern, der Perfekte Gesch?ft in der Suchmaschinenwelt. Aber ich bin nicht sicher ob es so lange dauern kann.|`|a93a2c6abf3b7f46b614018039a5fe1caa	Wacht auf Leute, Yahoo ist doch kein Wohlfahrtsverein. NATüRLICH machen sie das alles hier um Geld zu verdienen - und wer ihnen das vorwirft hat noch nicht ganz kapiert wie die Welt um ihn herum funktioniert. Du gehst ja auch nicht zu deinem B?cker um die Ecke und beschwerst dich, dass er das alles "eh nur wegen der Kohle" macht.<br>  <br>  Die meisten Internetseiten verdienen ihr Geld ?hnlich wie Zeitungen und Fernsehsender - vor allem durch Werbung (abgesehen von Seiten wie Amazon oder Expedia, die ja etwas verkaufen). Je h?her die Einschaltquoten, bzw. die Auflage, bzw. die Besucherzahlen desto mehr Werbeeinnahmen. Daher auch die Motivation z. B. eines Fernsehsenders ein m?glichst popul?res Programm zu bieten. Da m?gen jetzt einige das kichern anfangen in Anbetracht dessen was so über die Kiste flimmert, aber so traurig es ist wird darüber in gewisser Weise "demokratisch" entschieden, sprich die Masse der Leute sieht den Mist halt gerne.<br>  <br>  Und das ist auch okay so, denn diese Unternehmen haben schlie?lich auch Mitarbeiter die sie bezahlen müssen, was der ach so schlimme "Kommerz" erm?glicht, womit wiederum Arbeitspl?tze geschaffen werden und die Wirtschaft angekurbelt wird.<br>  <br>  Natürlich kann Werbung auch nerven, z. B. die Werbeunterbrechungen im TV. Aber wenn hier so ein kleiner Banner vor sich hinflimmern würde st?rt das doch keinen wirklich oder? <br>  <br>  Wenn dich Werbung wirklich so st?rt mu?t du in ein Land gehen wo kein Kapitalismus herrscht. Nord-Korea soll sch?n sein ;-)<br>  <br>  (Sorry, hab ?hnliche Kommentare schon so oft geh?rt und gelesen dass ich das hier mal loswerden mu?te)|`|0aab77b2bddd168275bdfd26f77dc986aa	.gemessen in €: keine ahnung - ansonsten?<br>  das entzieht sich auch meina kenntniss.|`|7361ffe3e5cf608706996e2979163ea4aa	Clever ist Kommerz.

AA10001291	You can't delete just part of your account, like Answers or 360. I do think Yahoo! you make it clear that once you ask or answer a question, it is part of the Internet forever. It will never be removed unless it's reported as a violation. A lot of people don't want others to see what they've asked/answered. My only suggestion to you is to delete everything you can from Answers and 360, make sure no one can contact your from either service, and don't return.|`|0238b94bf81559ebc2e87cdd61d31ab9aa	Just don't come back.

2e34ws6zaa	Most sellers on Amazon are either individuals like you and me who just want to get rid of their stuff, or small overstock companies who can sell their merchandise at 'wholesale' pricing, which is generally cheaper than the 'listed' price.  The effect is generally twofold: <br>  <br>  1) Cheaper prices attract more customers, which can equal more profit.<br>  <br>  2) Despite being loads cheaper than the listed price, wholesale companies can still make a profit off the price they sell the item at.  (Even if it's sold for a penny, they can scrape by with a few cents from the shipping costs they charge you.)

5986dcde46925ee5940b7c2b41c47c5aaa	Hola linda!<br>  <br>  mira quizá no es que se les quiera más.. Lo cierto es que se valora más a la mujer.. <br>  <br>  En nuestra ignorancia de hombres.. cuando una mujer no es virgen nos da esa inseguridad de desconocer la verdad de su historia..<br>  <br>  y mira desde mi punto de vista voy a tratar de justificar:<br>  <br>  Si te casas conmigo y no eres virgen<br>  <br>  en la boda voy a estar pensando, cuántos tipos habrán en ese público.. de los que sean acostado con la mujer que me caso..<br>  <br>  vamos a comer o un super mercado,,y te saludan tipos, o nos quedan viendo.. y me da esa mala espina de que probablemente hiciste diablura con ellos, etc..<br>  <br>  Celos, inseguridades, impotencia, incertidumbre.. Todo eso lo evito si estoy con una mujer que es virgen al momento de estar conmigo.. Entonces es un "plus" que me permite valorarla...<br>  <br>  Sé suena machista y todo lo demás.. pero es la verdad..<br>  <br>  Por otra parte las relaciones sexuales yo las justifico cuando se dan entre dos personas (hombre y mujer) que se aman, que viven un romance de tocar las estrellas... Acostarse con alguien por mera calentura, por experimentar,, es contra la moral.. contra los principios de autoestima y valoración.. Te lo digo yo que fui promiscuo.. pero ahora solo con mi se?ora..<br>  <br>  Un abrazo linda y cuídate, tú vales no dejes que se hable mál de ti por un momento que quizá no vale la pena.. Mira los hombres somos muy dados a hablar más de la cuenta.. talvez le tocamos la vulva y ya decimos que nos mamó, etc|`|0dde23a7fbce255585e1a651c5ce914eaa	nop?????? para nada????? es un prejuicio???

la tiene muy preocupada, solo es cuestión de enfoques, hay quienes son vírgenes del cuerpo pero tienen la mente muy corrompida y hay quienes ya no tienen eso a lo que llamas virginidad pero mucha madurez, así es que tu puedes darte cuenta de que hay miles de cosas mas importantes que esa dichosa virginidad.|`|T4moerbXaa	Pues eso de que las quieren mas por ser virgenes, yo creo que tiene parte de verdad, pues de otra manera dirian de ti que eres una facilota, y tambien yo te aconsejo llegar al matrimonio virgen, pues esa magia que envuelve la primera vez es lo mas bonito, sino, ya sabras a lo que vas, y ya no es lo mismo, cuidate mucho y yo si te recomiendo que cuides tu virginidad...|`|3PEA8Armaa	Es cierto , pues es lo más puro que una mujer le da al hombre con el que se casará, además es una ordenanza de Dios que no andes fornicando, mejor que te cases, pero primero hay que conocer a alguien que tenga tus mismos principios moral y valores, para que puedas pensar en hacer primero una amistad, y si de ahi surge otra cosa, entonces sabrás que hacer.|`|6Aw9Luq4aa	Pienso que el valor de la mujer está mucho más allá de un simple himen o una experiencia sexual, son mucho más importante los valores, esos sí hacen que los hombres nos quieran más, creo que si un hombre condiciona la virginidad en la mujer no es digno de ella.<br>  Según tu pregunta anterior tienes solo 13 a?os y creo que aún no estas preparada para una relación sexual, te aconsejo que confies bastante en tu mamá, que ella sea tu mejor amiga y te oriente en todo lo relacionado al sexo sin meterte miedo, la responsabilidad y la madurez son factores indispensables a la hora de iniciar una vida sexual.<br>  Un abrazo!|`|Lpur61m8aa	las prefieren virgenes, sino de als otars van a pensar qe son unas

ba61e49db406a01601fe046bc7d3ec5eaa	Wow I can't believe how paranoid the other answerer was. Let me tell you about my experiences with eBay. I've been a member since 1999 and have completed about 85 auctions (mostly buys, a few sells.) I've bought everything from video games, to movie dvds, cloths, speakers, and mp3 players and have never been ripped off once. eBay is a fairly safe way to buy things and can net you some really good deals. You'll be ok as long as you follow a few simple rules:<br>  <br>  1.) ALWAYS read the entire auction before bidding, sometimes people feel they got ripped off when really they just looked at the picture and the price and failed to read the details about what your getting, the condition of the item, shipping costs, etc.. <br>  <br>  2.) ALWAYS look at the sellers user feedback, this is a big indication of whether your more likely to have a good experience or a bad experience. Take note of how many people have rated them, and how many of those comments are positive and negative. If someone has hundreds or even thousands of completed auctions and received lots of  positive feedback and very few if any negative comments,  you can safely say its very unlikely that things wont work out. That said, I've bought things from power sellers with over 5000 completed auctions and I've bought things from sellers with very little feedback (everyone's got to start somewhere, I just wouldn't buy anything to expensive from a new seller.) Not once have I been ripped off, same is true of the many friends I have that use eBay frequently. <br>  <br>  3.) Go and get yourself a free PayPal account that you will link to a bank account or credit card and use to pay for everything you buy on eBay. This is free because PayPal makes money by charging the seller a fee to accept PayPal payments (not you.) PayPal offers buyers all kinds of protection if things do go bad so that you can get your money back (check out paypal.com for details.) For even more protection, link a credit card to the paypal account instead of a bank account. This is because credit card companies offer tons of fraud protection to their customers (surprisingly more then banks do), if you get ripped off you can simply call the credit card company and request a charge back if it comes down to it.<br>  <br>  On that note, eBay strictly prohibits selling pirated goods on their site (including copies of dvd movies.) Should you get a bootleg, you can get your money back very easily. The same is true if you find the disc is scratched very badly (as long as the auction did not disclose the condition of the disk in the description)<br>  <br>  So if your thinking of getting into eBay, go for it! You'll find its a lot of fun, you can find some great deals and also find a lot of cool stuff you might not be able to find anywhere else. I've found people on eBay are generally good and want to do right by their buyers. There's always a chance things can go wrong, but rarely will you find yourself without any chance of getting your money back.<br>  <br>  Buying something fairly cheap like a dvd is a great way to get started buying stuff from eBay and learning the ropes! Good luck!|`|ZGiaZXlfaa	well i would not try it. when you use Ebay it is a gamble with your bank account. people have been getting hacked on Ebay alot, and if your pin is let into the wrong hands it could ruin your life. so i wouldn't risk it, also my friend bought a DVD from ebay about a year ago. she bought the "other sister" a week later she got the case, but she never got the DVD itself. she kept messaging the Ebayer, but sadly she was scammed 15 dollars.

28d6b247dbaac5aea6f4f1980e00962baa	Yes I went to college.  My undergraduate degree helped me get into graduate school.  My career is from my graduate degree.  Yes I like my job.  Although I need my graduate degree for my job, my work largely uses my undergraduate studies skills.  So, yes, the degree helped.  Without my undergraduate degree, I would not have been able to go to grad school and I would not have been able to have the job that I have now, which is perfect for me.
24c92661915a4582662b691cb05dc0baaa	Hmmm...sounds like your animal could be a marine animal with lots of fat and maybe fur to protect it from the cold. It will need a food source, such as other sea creatures or water plants. Maybe it hibernates during the coldest part of the winter. You could also have some kind of a land animal that hangs out near hot springs to keep warm. It's fur might be some kind of  a wierd color from minerals in the springs. For more ideas, I'd look on Wikipedia at animals like fur seals, whales, polar bears, penguins and similar cold weather animals and see what kinds of characteristics they have developed to live in the cold.<br>  <br>  You might want to invent some plants that thrive in cold temperatures for your animals to eat or use to live in or for nesting material, and state that the soil is very rich in nutrients.  A seed pod that bursts when it freezes and realeases it's seeds might be cool. It also might be fun to have plants that produce a special sap in cold weather that contains a chemical that works as an anti-freeze. Maybe there are very delicate flowers that are protected from the elements by huge leaves that the plant uses sort of like umbrellas. Your plants probably have really really long roots to go deep down into the part of the ground that isn't frozen to get nutrients, but also keep the plants from being uprooted durig bad weather and all that erosion you'll get from the frequent rain.<br>  <br>  I'd also think about what kind of chemicals are in the atmosphere, which will determine what color the sky is, and how many moons you'd like to have.|`|qRJztNNZaa	Hello<br>  Is the animal real or fake?<br>  If u have to choose a real animal penguins may be good. Penguins live in cold weather and eat fish from the ocean.<br>  Since ur planet is mostly ocean different kinds of fishes may be good and are also a food supply for the penguins.<br>  IF you were to make up an animal I think that the animal would have to have adaptations to the colder climate like a warm coat of fur, or maybe its skin/fur changes from season to season to blend in with snow or other things.
