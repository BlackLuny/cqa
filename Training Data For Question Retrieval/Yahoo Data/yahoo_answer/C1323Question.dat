20090202200403AAInE9U	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why are homo sapeins the only species where the female has to physically impress the male?	The only species I know of, anyway (feel free to correct me).      Think about it - doesn't it seem weird how in most animal species, the male is the one with the showy feathers, fur, etc. who must impress the female? Why Is it that for humans, females are encouraged to wear makeup, starve themselves, get implants, wear heels, or do whatever physically torturous beauty rituals their culture has - while the males are praised for not investing time in their physical appearance? Isn't this backwards?

Especially in American culture, why do men think they have to be so macho, to validate their masculinity?

He stole my purse and i had a nice sum of money in there only he took the wallet out and threw my purse down with money still in purse. I also do not keep my credit cards or id or anything in my wallet only thing in there was my insurance cards and ss card. I know it could have been worse and i am happy that it wasnt but i am so nervous to go anywhere anymore. It was 11:30 am that this happened..broad daylight!
20070218125516AAnDaKQ	Social Science;Psychology	Was I abused?	Well, when i was younger, as a toddler, my mom used to smack me. Thats what ive heard from my sister and her. Like when i wouldnt go to sleep she would smack me and i'd cry and just fall asleep. I even have a toddler picture of me with a pink mark on my forehead...also, My aunt used to make me cake and stuff like that and we'd have bad eating habits. I used to eat alot. When i was a child, at my home they would make pasta and i'd eat like three large plates of it. So, now I'm obese. And also my brother used to wrestle with me and make me cry tons and my mom wouldnt do anything about it..and sometimes he'd hurt me. He terribly verbally abused me i suppose--because he would make fun of me because of my weight constantly and id get teased by kids at school--and people knew me to be extremely sensitive. He was a cruel person and would ridicule and humiliate me constantly, until i was old enough to fight back for myself. Theres much more but im running out of my limit.just email me@wayxgone

20090202203211AAS5YSR	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Strangest, most unsettling dream of my lifetime?	Last night: I came across a village of people on the edge of a forest who used to have a protective shield around them, but after a "pulse of air" (thats how they described it) lost all security. Now this guy called dominic, slaughters them when they are in the dark, and follows them in the sunlight waiting for night to come.. so he can, well... slaughter them. When hes in the light he appears in a red button up shirt and looks normal, but in the night he has blades that come out of his fingers and wears a (slightly kinky) leather suit. Now during this dream there were many cat and mouse chases between me and him (him being the cat).There was one where he was chasing me through the forest and I hid in a pile of wood outside of this lady named "yaga's"(??) house. The next chase was at midnight, and he came to my friends house and posed as a gentlemen to my friends mom in order to enter the house. I remember that he was so evil, because he was so decisive. One scene that really stood out to me was when I was in a dark barn, he had just killed one of the village people and sensed that I was in there, I rushed out of the barn, and he was behind me!! But for a really strange reason I started singing to stall my death. I almost was trying to pretend I had fallen in love with him, and then really DID feel in love with him, even though he was disgustingly evil. He kissed me, pulled out a blade and slit my throat, and then I woke up... O_O any ideas?? Anyone??
20090202204438AAwP4aG	Social Science;Psychology	What can i do to be less....?	What can i do to be less paranoid? Besides relax, what can i do to just stop being paranoid and tense? Yoga? Meditation? I never have time for this. And i run and jog but it's painful and gives me stitches and never actually calms me down. My best friend always tells me i'm being paranoid, and i look at myself and he's right. I AM paranoid. Idk what to do about it. And i mean, very paranoid. I'm always afraid someone i love is going to die or people hate me or my close friends are going to go away or some apocalyptic event is going to destroy the world. I just can't look at the positives in life. I'm not depressed, i don't have some disorder. I'm just so paranoid. I'm only the slightest bit OCD, but come on, EVERYONE has a little OCD in them, yes? I can still be happy and stuff, but i'm so paranoid. And i always expect the worse thing that can possibly happen in situations. I always think someone's going to die. I'm over protective of my parents and really don't like when my mom goes off to the grocery store alone at night even when it's right down the street. My father is homeless and i'm always thinking he's dead (of malnutrition). Please help, is this just anxiety? I'm not sure. I'm 13 (turning 14 on the 11th yay =]) and the constant stress of hw and the fact that i have no friends doesn't even help my paranoia. Please give me any advice u have =] thank you

I am a good student, who just switched majors to something that interests me (History and English), I have come out of the closet and have let those close to me know I am gay, I have joined a load of clubs to keep busy, I have a job, I love my school, I just cannot figure out why I still feeling like dying is a good idea. The bad things I can think about in my life are that : I am afraid that my close family and friends will reject me because I am gay(even though they have accepted me for being gay), I am an urban loving kid going to school in a small town even though I LOVE my school, I have a panic disorder, I have crushes on people who are straight, and I am afraid that my life will not get any better even though all my friends say my life will improve dramatically. I just dont see it. Can you please help me? Btw, I am Catholic so please dont tell me to reach out to Jesus, I have/am trying. Thanks!

Then, I came across a picture of him on someone's Myspace, and I went into a hyperventilating fit of sobbing and scratching my arms till they bled. Like, violent and intentional.

20090202221448AAoRCY3	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Men: Which one from your woman? Respect or Love?	Men, there is a book called "Love and Respect."  In it, it says that to men respect is much more important than love.  Men communicate with each other with respect.  And they understand it more than love.  So the book proposes (and uses studies to prove) that men prefer respect from their wives than love.  In fact, the book says that men need respect  just as much as women need love.      Men only...  do you agree?

I hear women complain about being labeled s luts and being judged negatively upon their looks and sexuality all the time. - Yet conversely I don't recall hearing too many women complain about getting more positive sexual attention or an easier time attracting suitors/ yet these occurrences go hand in hand.      How can women so often complain about the positives without doing so about the negatives- if it's truly about equality?  Or is it simply obvious that women would apparently rather have a clear advantage relative to men in this area without any consequence?

20090202215633AAtuoU0	Social Science;Psychology	Unconsciously personality changing?	I've been wondering this for a few years now, for it has happened. I have this thing where when I first encounter people that I don't know, I've been told by close friends and family that my personality changes quite drastically, such as the tone of my voice. I get very soft spoken, and also very very formal. Even my vocab changes, to the extent where I use bigger words, or just act very very formal and distant. Im not shy at all, im actually quite sociable. Many and I mean if not all my friends say that I am completely different when they first met me, to manners, tone of voice. and many people take me for being weird. which later on they come to realize Im different. the thing that I ask is that I do this unconsciously. I honestly try very hard to not act that way when it comes to people I first meet. but it just happens.. and its been a bother.. for I give people different vibes from what I really am. such as a relaxed/open person. 3 years ago, I was diagnosed with a social disorder. Can that have anything to do with this? Sorry for the long post, any ideas to change this bad habit of mine?

20090202224923AAmUwN3	Social Science;Psychology	Need help from a Physiologist!?	I have been in love with someone for 10 years.I'm a virgin.We can't have sex.    I am afraid of the pain.If a finger,tongue,tampon or anything goes near THERE I panic,and I mean PANIC.I totally freak out.    Talking or reading about sex or penetration or breaking hymens makes me queasy and gives me head aches and grosses me out (I vomited fainted once while reading up on what happens to the hymen during intercourse)    I keep telling myself the pain will not be as bad as I think,but my unconscious seems to believe it's going to be an excruciating experience.I just can't control my body,when it comes down to doing "it" I panic and scream and squirm.    Is this Genophobia? I have always assumed I was Genophobic.    Is there any way to get over this without therapy?    Please help.

20090202193309AAUAEvb	Social Science;Psychology	I believe I am crazy. Am I? or is at least some of this stuff understandable.?	okay so I believe i have quite a few mental problems which I will describe below. Since its so much to read ill try to break it up nicely. I'm going to seek help and this is pretty much just to get it off my chest before hand.          Okay so first is what I believe my social problems to be. I'll save what I think the root of all these problems are until last.       I think I'm scared of relationships, I just read another post and it made so much sense to me. I keep everybody at arms lengths, even friends. I think this started when I returned from Iraq.       Second I think I have an inferiority complex. When ever I meet somebody I tend to think they are better than me so I feel like its expected that I'm rejected. I spend most of my time alone, but not because I want to...Maybe im afraid of being scolded.      I'm very likable, and my mood changes a lot. I'm attractive, and have some self confidence issues, but all in all I think pretty well of myself. If I think well of myself how could I have an inferiority complex?      and the root of all the problems I believe is my sexual fantasies. I fantasize about kidnapping and raping women. I would never do it, but I finally opened up to a friend about it and she told me that I don't think I would do it... but if i ever hit rock bottom I might. Maybe? probably not but its better to be safe than sorry.       However, this is not something new I realized. I remember when I was in 5th grade I would day dream about kidnapping my teacher and cutting her breasts and vagina off so I could use them whenever I pleased (I was little and did not realize that it didnt work like that...).      So that got me thinking... why at such a young age did I have such disturbing thoughts? I came to the conclusion that it is because I have always viewed women as objects because my whole life I've been looking at porn. My parents never stopped me, and never punished me. I believe that is why I was drawn to the military, I craved some sort of discipline. I am out now by the way.       So while I'm getting intimate with a women (it has been a while as I have just given up) I have confident with everything I do until I slide it in. Then I get so nervous that I cant perform. I have had sex plenty so its not "You're just new". I believe that I get so nervous because subconsciously I am thinking about the above stated problems. Has my other mental problems given me E.D.? Possibly.       Maybe this is why I'm afraid of relationships.... Maybe this is why I feel inferior than everybody else... because I am...      Anywho, thanks for listening everybody.... and I am going to seek help next week when I get my net paycheck.       Does anybody else have anything to add?
20090202195722AArF0d5	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	How do you know if you should go to therapy?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.   Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.   Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..   On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my life.

20070826143951AAdnZCq	Social Science;Psychology	How can I be labelled quiet or are they just biased or trying to protect themselves?	When I'm working in such a way that it's more behind the scenes and not in meetings or frontline, I am a quiet person except when I take breaks- I tend to chat up a co-worker.  In the beginning of my employment and throughout, I would talk every so now and then with a fellow data entry clerk but work only most of the time since it's more effective to catch details.   Yet, I am called quiet by a few people EVEN though I contribute to conversations just as evenly as or even more so than many others on breaks or in meetings! I critically look at myself and still can't see why people think of me as more quiet than others or am I just an unfairly singled out?      I do , however, have a more monotone voice, daker personality, etc. and am female on top of this.  Could it be these nonverbal cues and vocal tone that contribute to me being seen as quiet?

20090202212528AAIC5aC	Social Science;Psychology	Im always thinking about bad memories of my childhood, teenagehood, why? Long Story please read..?	Every single day, as I work, drive, study, walk, listen, or just clear my mind. Those negative images, and past events are always haunting me. I never forget the day my mom and dad separated, I clearly remember seeing the police come, my dad yell and verbally abuse my mother, his violence and rage throughout the house. I remember it like if it were yesterday that he were slamming doors, punching walls, throwing chairs and whatever else was near him, breaking glass, cups, and plates, all the while I was mortified that he was going to hurt me. Possibly do some kind of beating on my mom. I remember being little and my dad always rejecting me, I was always told to be quiet. This taught me to have my mouth shut even to this day.This is why people tell me im so quiet. I remember eating at Taco Bell when I was little, It was my mom, dad, older brother, and me, I was so happy for some reason, and when we were all at the table, I was talking, my dad told me when people eat at the table you have to be quiet, no talking. I remember feeling crushed and hurt, because I didnt know what i did that was so wrong?    I remember being at my private school, my dad was a school teacher, he gave preferrential treatment to my other classmates over me. For one christmas concert, instead of usually filming me, he had the the camera on me for a few seconds then left the rest of it, and zoomed in onto another girl named Desree, ( he cheated on my mom, with Desrees mom) I remember the horrible feeling i had watching how he had gave her favor over me. Always had recorded me, but this concert he took the focus away from me and video taped her :( I felt like I was no good, i felt ugly and fat, accompanied by a million other feelings.     I always remember my dad telling that i was overweight, suck in my stomach, and he would even laugh at my posture, jokingly he would tell me to fix it and sit straight. I remember him always yelling, being violent, being the one whom always controlled everyone. I remember us going to bookstore, and my dad would always distract everyone with a book or magazine that they liked, and he would go look at "artistic nude photos" if i even came close to him he would raise his voice at me, as though I were an inconvenience. I remember unintentionally one time I popped out of nowhere to ask him "dad have you seen the Barbie Book?" he turned at me with a sour angry face and loudly said "NO I HAVE NOT SEEN THE BARBIE BOOK" at the same time trying to be discreet and close the book he had in his hand, but I knew what it was, i thought he was sick for doing it. Im always thinking of negative things that occured to me I dont know why?

20090202212010AADoVPP	Social Science;Psychology	Simply put, what the hell do I do?	I have issues with mirrors. I have to place bottles or things of similar size and shape in a straight line touching the base of the mirror to keep things inside of it. It sounds stupid, but it makes sense when I do it. I've held out for close to a month now and my life is going to hell. I've let myself go because I'm too busy comfort-eating to exercise, I stopped working on my social skills that were already lacking, my skin is a mass of acne from all the stress, I only passed my classes this last semester thanks to teachers who like me for the fact that I'm quiet, and I've been toying with the idea of killing myself. To make things worse I've been hearing someone call my name when no one is around, and last night the walls were breathing. When I let it go too long like this, I can feel something with me in the room, not doing anything but scaring the hell out of me. It feels more thick in that part of the room. I don't like looking my reflection in the eyes because they don't feel right, if you know what I mean..not like they look weird, they just feel weird. I talk to my reflection when I'm home alone, and I can hear the answers in my head, in my speaking voice (but not the one I use in my thoughts.) I haven't told my friends anything because they already think I'm on drugs and they won't believe me. I briefly had a therapist who listened, seemed interested, and then told me I was starved of attention. It might be all real, it might all be in my head, but it feels real enough that its destroying my life.
20090202212207AAoVBc1	Social Science;Psychology	Do You Think I Could Be Psychic?	Okay so lately i have been saying things & the become true. For example i was walking to school with a friend & the traffic was bad I told my friend "The traffic is so bad, one of these days, a little kid is going to get hit." My friend & I walked in to the school & about 5 minutes before the first bell a little 5th grader was hit by a car. My English teacher is a great teacher & a wonderful mother, some of my friends & I were talking about her & I mentioned I wished she would get pregnant. What do you know 3 weeks later she announced she had discovered 2 days before that she was pregnant & that it was unplanned. There is a girl at my school that had gotten in trouble a lot a few years ago but not much lately, I had mentioned it to my friend that she had been acting odd & that I bet she will get i a fight soon & then she did. I also pick up my phone randomly & right as I pick it up it goes off. It is as if I knew it was going to ring, but I didn't. I love helping people I just know how different people work & what helps them most, I want to be a psychologist. Could i Be psychic?
