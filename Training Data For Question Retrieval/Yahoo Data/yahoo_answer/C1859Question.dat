My windows computer doesn't recognize and/or obtain the default gateway and thus my internet on that computer doesn't work. This is the first time that it has been acting like this. I was using the computer fine yesterday and nothing was wrong with it. It is connected through an Ethernet cable. I know it is not my hardware because I can access the Internet through my Linux distro. All of the other computers in the house work, but they are functioning through wireless connection. Any ideas as to why this occurs? If I open the connection settings, when I click close, it freezes, just that window, all the time. Don't know if that is relevant. I did  ipconfig /release  and  renew  and none have yet to help me. If you need any other info, just ask. I am using a laptop that is connected to my network to type this.

20080317125739AAmz4QG	Computers & Internet;Software	I am editing something in adobe audition. Could someone help me?	Okay work with me as this may not make sense but I have an mp3 i recorded from a video and I am trying to edit it in Adobe Audition. I want to create an accapella of it so there is vocals on no music. Because it was taken from a video the quality is a  low and there is no "extra layers" to it so I cant get the accapella effect to work. Is it possible to create the extra layers in multitrack or something to make it work. I placed the same mp3 in the 3 multitrack slots and mixed it. This seems to get the "Central Channel Extractor" to work but the accapella still has the music in it so i'm assuming the volumes in multitrack needs to be adjusted or something. If this is at all possible (and my question made sense) could some give me some tips please.

20081002091212AAuP72C	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Wireless usb router (linksys)?	i recently bought a linksys wireless ubs router for my desktop in my room. i was under the assumption this was the way to get internet in my room. i have verizon fios in my kitchen computer. i thought it would pick up on the fios connection which it did. but i keep getting a message that it can connect to the access point but no internet can be found. fios is wireless, i have a laptop that can pick up and connect with no problem. do i need a wireless router or what? i cant understand why the router cant pick up the internet. i also see a lock next to the verizon connection in the profiles available to connect to, which i dont understand either. can somebody please help?

20071102104002AA1APX2	Computers & Internet;Software	Why can't I click save in OpenOffice?	I have open office and have been using it for a while, but now I realise that the save button is greyed out and I cannot use it. I can use Save As and chose a file name myself but I don't necessarily always want to do that. It happens even when I have an already saved document open so it can't be anything to do with an unsaved document making me save with save as so I give it a file name.      My computer is a Windows XP Media centre Edition if that is important.      How do I make my save function work again? Would a re-install do anything?

20080202122835AASDdOf	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Can't access the true administrator account on Vista since I can't run the command prompt as an administrator?	I am unable to access the true administrator account because one of the steps in doing so with Windows Vista Home Basic is to run the command prompt "as administrator" because when I try to do this the computer completely ignores this as though I never clicked on it in the first place. In fact, I am not 100% certain on this but I believe most if not all programs I have ignore the action "run as administrator" What can I do about this because without the true administrator account, there are some programs I cannot even uninstall even though I installed them myself among many other restrictions. However, I know someone with a laptop who has the same version of windows and it allows them to open the command prompt as an administrator, so why can I not with mine? This is a very serious issue so I greatly appreciate anyone who can help. Another very important note, I cannot use the method in which one has to open "Local Users and Groups" because I have Windows Vista Home Basic.

Did a clean upgrade on desktop from XP to Vista, having no other problems except for when put into sleep mode, once you move the mouse to wake it up the mouse and keyboard no longer work. I've tried unplugging the mouse, etc, nothing happens, and then I just have to basically unplug/turn off all power to the computer.      Is it just that you can't put Vista into sleep mode? What are my other options??

"Nicht installieren wenn sie nicht absolut sicher sind" "nur installieren wenn es tats?chlich ein bestimmtes Problem behebt" "dieser Hotfix wurde nicht ausreichend getestet" usw usw.

20090304224340AA6lm9o	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Help!!!! I need your advice!!!!?	I am a business graduate from Fresno, California and I need your advice. I initiated a web site last month, (name is not being disclosed until publishing) I have been brainstorming and have received very valuable feedback but that's not you and I need you.    The web site structure is more of a natural appearance than just colors. There will be a sense of comfort once you enter the site. The site will be based on you. What do you like? What's your favorite place that is full of energy and comfortable? My answer would be a mall and the attractions and environment that are welcoming.    My questions to you,   What can I bring to my website that no other web site has done?   My site will be of advertisements, sales, socializing, entertainment, inviting environment and more.   What do you consider before shopping on a website?   What would you suggest? If I do use your idea as a main plot I will reward you once the site is put together. It must be unique.    Background images? (look and feel)   Background Music? (hip hop, country, reggae, rock, etc.)   Gaming? (sports, fighting, adventure, etc.)       Anything Else?      IM me for your suggestions if you would like.

If I set the print areas via page break preview it wants to print both either landscape or portrait, it won't let me tell it to do one of each (which I could do in Word for example using 'from this point on')       Is there an easy way to do this rather than having to go through menus (I have a lot of these to print).

20090304173544AA9pTQ6	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Programmin in C help?	Write a program to read in 3 integer values and then print them out in ascending order.   In each case, the main function should read the values, call helper function(s) to determine the highest and lowest values, calculate the middle value (a + b + c – min – max), and print the values in ascending order.    In the program (lab6.c), you should use two helper functions,   int minof3(int a, int b, int c);   int maxof3(int a, int b, int c).    Create several sets of test data for the program, with the input values in all possible orders, with duplicate values, and with positive, zero and negative values.
20090304181139AARKpWy	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Can anyone help with a  relatively easy C++ problem?	This program takes inputted miles (start and stop values with increments), converts it into km, and then makes a table of values.  I have it doing this, but the next part is to put it into four columns instead of two (for example, if i picked from 1 to 20, the first two columns would be from 1 to 10, and the last two would be from 11 to 20).  The hint it gives me says "Find split = (start+stop)/2.  Let a loop execute from miles = start to split, and calculate and print across one line the values of miles and kilometers for both miles and (miles - start + split + 1).      My variables aren't named the same, but they're close enough to not be confused.  Can anyone give me a push into how I should go about this?      #include     using namespace std;   int main()   {       void makemileskmtable(double,double,double);       double start,end,inc;              cout   start;       cout   end;       cout   inc;                     if(end<=10)       {       cout << "Miles        Kilometers" << endl;       }       else       {       cout << "Miles        Kilometers      Miles        Kilometers" << endl;       }              makemileskmtable(start,end,inc);              system("PAUSE");       return 0;   }              void makemileskmtable(double x, double y, double z)       {            double a,i;                                        for(i=x;i<=y;i=i+z)                        {            if(x<10)                        a=i*1.61;            cout << i << "              " << a << endl;                                    }           }

Really I just need either code, an activex, or dll for visual basic/c# 2008.   Any help will be greatly appriciated.

(HP)   But to tell you the truth I have no idea how to operate it. I tried starting the exe, then selecting "create virtual machine" -> give it a random name -> selected windows 98 (I want to run programs that require windows 98) -> Chose a ram above recommended settings (500mb, because 64mb seemed a little bit low) -> select "a new virtual hard disc" -> accepted the default settings -> pressed finish.      But when I select my virtual machine in the console and press run, it just gives me a DOS-like window that eventually tells me to    "Reboot and select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device"      What the hell?

20090305041729AARva5k	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Internet...cant browse most pages. doesnt make sense?	Your Question   problem browsing.. pages won't open...started recently. Have tried everything. Please help!?   Hi, the computer I use at work is connected to the internet and I have never had any problem using the internet. The other day, I couldn't log into email or facebook. I could go to any page without logging in, but when I tried to log in, it would show me that page you get when you're offline.    I don't store any temporary files so I know I'm not offline looking at saved pages. I can search with google. I still can't log into anything but today I can't go to most pages (harmless news pages for example) unless using a proxy.   I've checked all the internet settings I can think of and the firewall is turned off, anti virus options that interfere with internet are also switched off. There is no filter or block on adult content or anything. I should be able to see any page I want. I was able to download mozilla firefox to see if it was just I somehow messed up internet explorer settings but mozilla wouldnt open any pages at all or search in google so I uninstalled that. I don't know why it suddenly started being weird but it is possible that my technophobe boss suddenly got it into his head to mess with settings but I've restored factory settings in my browser and I'm able to log into answers (but not mail) with a proxy so it doesnt make any sense to me. If you can shed any light on this I would really appreciate it! Thanks

20090305042622AAH6vOn	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Cleaning seemingly permanent smudge marks on glossy laptop screen?	I have an HP 6258se laptop and it has one of those glossy screens. There seem to be permanent smudge lines, running up and down, possibly from the keyboard when it is closed, but I'm not sure.      When I clean the screen, all but these lines come off, they don't seem like scratches, but they are impossible to remove.  There is also a tiny bump on the screen (like the size of the very tip of a thorn, tiny tiny) that seems like an extra piece of plastic but I can't scratch it off.      Like I said, the lines are my main concern, as it is a nice HD display... Is there a solution I could use (liquid solution I mean) to clean this or is there a safe way to buff this out using a Dremel tool or something?       It's a real shame, you can see it when there is a glare on the screen and I'm pretty sure it's from the keyboard, but that would imply a scratch, but they are not rough to the touch.      Thanks in advance!

20070323113543AAfDaEC	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	I have 3 different BSoD errors and my computer is going really slow, how do I fix them?	My computer is giving me 3 different BSoDs at different times.      It regularly crashes:   When logged onto Windows Live Messenger   When loading Cubase (100% crashes)   Some other times, seemingly random      The error codes I have got are:   0x0000007F   0x000000F4   I don't know the other one   (these don't match)      My system specifications:   CPU: AMD Athalon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4200+   RAM: 1024 MB   Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 6200 TurboCache   Hard drive: SATA - not sure how much memory      The BSoDs started after I took it to the computer shop to be repaired. There was a bunch of driver errors/incompatabilities/whatever and they sorted it out, they installed windows again over what was already there they said. This is when all the BSoDs started and the computer has been going really slow (the stuff they were supposed to fix was fixed)      They said I needed to reformat and re-install. Isn't there another way to fix it?      If you need any more info, just send me a message and I'll add it.
