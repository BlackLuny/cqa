20080706170149AAOh68r	Beauty & Style;Makeup	The Bodyshop Two sided blush?	I recently bought a blush at the Body Shop.  I'm not too sure of the name, but is a loose powder, whose lid you unscrew.  Then, the top opens and there is a opaque shimmery cream.  I'm not sure if it's supposed to be cream blush.    I think it could be highlighter, but then again I'm not too sure.  It's not that blendable, but then again it doesn't say it is or isn't.    If anyone else has this, could you tell me what it is?  And how do I use it?  I don't want to go out and buy another cream blush, if this is what it is.      PS-The powdered blush works great, I have problems with it, it's just the creamy side.

Okay, so a couple days ago I recently purchased a pair of jeans,   I ordered it online, and I was not really sure of how the sizes go, so I picked a size 26, but now I figured out I'm a 24.   I am a size 0 in American Eagle, Hollister, Abercrombie, etc.   26 is too big, and it's sorta baggy, and I like my jeans tight.   I threw out the receipt, so I can't exactly return it,   so I was wondering if there was a way to get the jeans tighter WITHOUT having to get them fixed, or give them away.         Thanks <3   xoxo

20070218124616AAyVfM5	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	What would you consider the ideal height difference?	I have seen this question asked several times, and all of the answers are, "Love conquers all," and "It shouldn't matter." Please spare me. Chances of a 6'0" woman dating a 5'2" man is pretty slim. Even if you do choose that, it more than likely wasn't what you were looking for. So basically, I want to know your ideal height difference. I asked a height question before, but I didn't take the responders height into consideration. So now I will. Example: I'm 5'3, and I prefer men between 6'0-6'2. My entire range is 5'10-6'4.

20070613164024AAtaW4D	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	In your opinion, is there an age limit on beauty (physical beauty)?	I'm 25, going on 26, and have started to dread birthdays. I feel that I'm an attractive person, and often get complimented on my looks. I think I picked up somewhere along the line that looks are a woman's most important assett, so it became very important to me to keep up my looks. I'm afraid, though, that in dwelling so much on my appearance, that I've lost sight of my identity. I can't help fearing that after 30, I'll begin to lose my looks, thus losing the attention that I receive from my looks. I think appearance does play a big role in how we are treated. I went through an awkward stage in my teens, and lost so much confidence. I've gained it back, in part because more people started giving me positive attention for my looks instead of negative attention once I left the awkward stage.       I keep in beauties in mind like CZJ and Angelina Jolie, who are both in their 30's, I believe. I wish I could stop focusing on looks so much, but it's difficult with society's obsession with it.

OK here's my problem, I've always had a slight farmers tan but this summer I spent all day on a boat and it got terrible. It hasn't gotten any better during the winter months. Now my Winter Formal (basically prom) is in a month. I've found a great dress and I don't want my white shoulders blinding anyone. Is there any way I can get rid of farmers tan without actually tanning. Are there any sunless tanners that you can recommend? I have a pretty tan everywhere else besides my shoulders if that helps any. Thank you so much for your help :)

20090130190415AAoXSuZ	Beauty & Style;Hair	What can i do about oily scalp in the mornings?	okay, I have long hair, but my scalp gets oily after a while...not so much throughout the day, but when i sleep my oil glands go into overdrive and when i wake up i have an oily scalp and massively oily face.  I have the face thing taken care of, but because my hair gets oily when i go to sleep i have to take showers in the morning and blow dry my hair, and as long as my hair is, it takes FOREVER and so im always running late it seems...I've heard of putting dry shampoo on it but i have no idea where to get it. i looked at the closest stores that had hair products worth a ****, but didn't see it.  SO, in conclusion, what i would like to know is: 1) does ANYONE know where to get dry shampoo and what brand works best and 2) if you don't know about the dry shampoo, do you know any other tricks to get rid of oily scalp?   because this would let me sleep for an extra 45 minutes to an hour in the mornings.

Whenever I put foundation on, it takes away my natural glow and moisture. So it covers up my uneven skin tone but sorta ruins it too by taking away my natural shine. I wear powder too after foundation and I swear it makes me look dry and it will sit in my laugh lines and make me look like I have wrinkles. I'm 19,so I don't want to look dry with wrinkles haha.   Anyone know what I can do? Any ideas for good hydrating foundations?

For as long as I can remember, my  nose and I have always had a love-hate relationship. I'm in my late teens and want to get a nose job when I get older but I'm afraid of the outcome.  I feel like I might lose my identity and not like my nose and want my old nose back. I like my nose sometimes and hate it other times. I am asian and I know your nose keeps growing into late 20's but the bridge of my nose is not very prominent and I just want it to be a little bit higher.      What do you think?
