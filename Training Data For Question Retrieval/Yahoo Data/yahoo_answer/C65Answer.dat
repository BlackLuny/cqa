VOccyg7daa	Facts aren't going to change these lunatics minds, they never have in the past. Global Warming/Climate Change is just another way to collect taxes, nothing more. It seems that there are more and more true scientist around the world that are coming out against human responsibility of climate change.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	This is an absolute outrage!  We are completely reorganizing society because of this "problem" and we have people dummying up the data?<br>  <br>  Did they think that no one would notice that the reason October was the "hottest ever" was because they used August data for a large part of Siberia?  I can understand having incomplete data but why not use the October data from the previous year and highlight exactly why you did so and the errors this might introduce.  Using August data is inexcusable.<br>  <br>  These people should be charged with fraud for intentionally fudging the data on a matter of this much importance.|`|6d6cbb5a2b06e880fd999f1286785016aa	No.   But I do think the whole global warming thing suffers from equation manipulation.  So many scientists try to scurry around the data to paint a somewhat rosy picture. The hard data clearly suggests we are setting an exacerbated trend upwards in CO2 and temperature, Big problems.|`|DBu1AzjHaa	no|`|b538976641cc2a50041772f307796f66aa	Yes it always was.|`|Ko2QX3Cvaa	To me, this whole debate seems ridiculous. Even if you don't believe that global warming is man-made (I myself can't ignore the possibility that this may just be a natural cycle in the Earth's climate), you can't deny the impact we humans have on the environment. Global warming shouldn't be our only reason for supporting eco-friendly habits and policies. And it shouldn't be your only excuse not to.|`|R0LM9Hy8aa	The models used to predict global warming in the future can't even tell you what happened 5 years *ago* when you plug in actual data from weather that has already happened.<br>  <br>  Global Warming is a scam perpetrated by governments who want more control and taxation and academics who want more "research money".<br>  <br>  You want to study gray squirrels? Not a chance for a grant. You want to study the effects of global warming on gray squirrels? No problem getting money!|`|a9e937dafab0e1205c0c23b2f6caefa6aa	there has never been a single article published in a peer reviewed publication that even tries to deny the existence of global warming.<br>  <br>  only opinion pieces like the one cited here and 'scientists' who on the payroll of oil companies.|`|2b7VqUXXaa	That famous “hockey stick” graph was based on phony data. Someone “accidentally” reported the August temperature figures in October which made it look like Siberia was melting.|`|nYjVW8Fbaa	not phony data, but incomplete data which can give faulty results,|`|peEHzKGDaa	Yeah, planet Earth has been faking it the whole time.

They pay attention to the issues and the facts.  <br>  <br>  The people who did not vote for Obama realized that his campaign rhetoric was unrealistic.  They knew his followers would eventually be duped.  <br>  <br>  The sheer volume of Obama's broken campaign promises proves that his opponents were correct.|`|gSdeVUOTaa	Nope.|`|oojO4WAraa	Nope.

RyFCRcIUaa	dependent(s)!<br>  <br>  YOU can apply for a Drivers license in Hawaii <br>  or contact Illinois DMV and ask them the regulations for Military members and their dependents, You might be able to extend the expiration of your drivers  license by mail.|`|ft8t98Pnaa	you apply for a DL in Hawaii..... you should have done that within 2 weeks of you moving there.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	You should be able to renew your Illinois license by mail, if you don't have any outstanding citations against you.|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	Ugh, I just had to do this in January, but different states. Here were the rules I had to follow. If Illinois will allow you to renew your license online, do it before it expires. Most states only let you do it once online, then you have to show in person. If you plan on going to school in Hawaii at all, I would encourage having a license from there to prove your residency. <br>  <br>  Technically, you are now a resident of Hawaii, so you are supposed to get a license from Hawaii. But the online renewal does make it easy to circumvent that rule :o). Hope that helps.|`|AA12071655	You are a civilian and thus you are subject to the laws of the state in which you reside. If you drive only on the base, your Illinois license is good until it expires. If you leave the base you have to conform to the same laws every other civilian conforms to. Your husband is different; he's active duty.|`|zGVVxuFLaa	Every resource I've found, plus my experience during 3 years of living in Hawaii as a military spouse, says that Hawaii allows military spouses to retain their out of state license as long as it remains current.<br>  <br>  As the other posters have said, call Illinois or check their website.  Many states allow online renewal - they'll just send you the new license.  It shouldn't be too complicated.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	Switch it over to a Hawaii license.  Go to the DMV.|`|fyWbMXOHaa	You can renew your drivers license online in Illinois as long as your record is clean. You can also do this with vehicle registration. If you call the Illinois DMV they will also change your mailing address only so that you get all your DMV paperwork (renewals and whatever). But check with Hawaii first because every state has their own "rules" on military people having to change their drivers license.
gSdeVUOTaa	Amazed it is that high.|`|oojO4WAraa	It would be better if they and the Dems were working together for the good of America and both parties had approval ratings up around 75%.|`|DLvHWOo7aa	Marijuana is actually rated higher than republicans.|`|KF48OjyDaa	That's higher than I expected|`|67ThRN4Taa	No, because I sincerely believe that the republican conception & philosophy of government is both better than the democratic party's and closer to what the founding-fathers intended.  Unfortunately, once they get into office, a great many republicans don't actually follow through.  Fiscal policy, for example; its suppose to be low taxes, low government spending.|`|HZy629kLaa	That seems pretty high.<br>  <br>  WSJ:<br>  <br>  Americans are hopeful about his leadership, and opposition Republicans are getting drubbed in public opinion, the new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll suggests.|`|4KlVkaDaaa	Yes.  It's the logical result of years of horrible policy and divisive hatemongering pushed by the party.  The only thing they had going for them was fiscal responsibility, and they forgot how that works many, many years ago.|`|bMtBtYDsaa	And the democrats approval rating is 0% with republicans....don't you wish we were on your side.Wouldn't that make you feel good.<br>   All united and happy... with all the tax hikes and pork spending that will never happen.|`|de0fc1da097f66a349eb15de28f1834faa	Sounds like they polled congressional democrats, when they call average citizens through out the country, get back to me.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	I wonder what it will be when gold is over $1,000 / oz and we've pissed another trillion dollars away?|`|XVxH0FFAaa	26%...isn't that what Obama's approval rating has dropped since Jan.20?|`|AN9HVBZoaa	Link?|`|Iv5gv2V2aa	Yes, I do not consider myself a strong Democrat, and I did not vote for Obama, but the fact is the economy has always been better when a Democrat was in office.  You will here strong Republicans say it was messed up before Bush took office.  Well then he had 8 years to fix it then.  You can not blame this economy on Obama and I think he is doing a great job for short time in office.  He trying to accomplish a lot of things very quickly.|`|bARPX1auaa	Are you glad you have a platform to stir up even more hatred.<br>  <br>  Republican or Democrat, we're all Americans. <br>  <br>  The truth is it's us (the citizens) against them (the politicians)...party lines will not matter when the US is no more.<br>  <br>  So-called representatives from both sides are responsible for America's problems and BOTH support a collapse of the American economy for the introduction of a socialist world government.|`|WXG94nKAaa	Is it as high as that?

Rachel Madow was on Jay Leno last night and she explained it, just google the clip. But hey we own 80% of the company now. As a majority owner we should oust the CEO and board of directors, as obviously they are quite ineffective.|`|54dc81bbc372d3bb6d12660dc6fc3623aa	The current situation is way beyond regret... It's time to pay the piper. In case anyone is wondering, this saying comes from the practice, prior to WW1, of soldiers going in to battle to pay the company pipers to play a dirge for them when they died in battle. The battle for or against AIG is going to last a long time and have some far reaching implications worldwide.|`|pS4e5OtZaa	Government will have no regrets.

It all depends upon the needs of the Army.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	It depends but usually you stay at least a few years.  Moving someone every year is not cost effective especially with a family.<br>  <br>  The first time I was stationed at Campbell I was there for 3 years and then got caught in the Korea/Campbell rotation.  My husband is now stationed there and it has been 4 years and we haven't moved.|`|KvTGiR6taa	First-term (those in their first enlistment) enlisted members assigned to a CONUS (stateside) location must have 12 months time-on-station before being eligible to move to an overseas location, and must have 24 months time-on-station before being allowed to move to another CONUS location.|`|AA12215565	its not the same all the time same may stay and same go its up to the army

ErTVzpUUaa	Obama doesn't have the balls, I wished he did, because I'd like to see Rush demolish him!|`|HZy629kLaa	Hmmm.  Run the country or line the pockets of the leader of the republican party?  I think run the country.<br>  <br>  Does it matter.  According to cons no one watches them anyway.  So let Fox do it so the world will know.<br>  <br>  Rush is an idiot.  See, we can say it and not have to apologize.|`|Cc5V8dQwaa	Obama should have kept his big mouth shut about Rush. He essentially called Rush out. Now Obama's goon squad are going into protect Obama mode by ridiculing and undermining anyone that disagrees with him.<br>  No he shouldn't debate but he did bring it on himself.|`|Ko2QX3Cvaa	The fact that a talk radio host just challenged the President of the United States to a debate is laughable.<br>  <br>  Like Rush Limbaugh is at the top of Obama's priority list.|`|9GOX09eQaa	obama wouldn't have snow ball's chance in hell against the quick--extemporaneously spoken Limbaugh....<br>  <br>  Bring it on---that would be more fun than a barrel of monekys!|`|AA11592327	When and if Limbaugh runs for president, Mr Obama will debate him. Until then why should a United States president debate a radio DJ.|`|gZEn8k6Saa	Nope that is why the will not air it|`|DLvHWOo7aa	Probably I mean why would you take the President away from a crisis to debate an entertainer?<br>  <br>  Let's take the conductor away from the train to play yatzi while it plows out of control down the rails<br>  <br>  <br>  Sounds like typical Republican policy to me.|`|AA10264185	If Rush wants to debate Obama he should run for President in 2012.|`|BIQrsl4paa	The libs won't acknowledge it, but they all know that Limbaugh could beat Barry, Joe and Geitner while asleep. Lord knows what he would do to them if he debated them while awake.<br>  Besides, Barry hasn't got the cojones to debate Rush, that's why he wanted one of his flunkies to do it while he was busy snowing the liberals, errrr, I mean campaigning.<br>  <br>  So much fun to see the libs denegrating Rush, when in fact they know that their boy is scared silly of him.|`|AA11593971	I know... I've been expecting this. Once again, Obama is trying to send out his attack dogs after a private citizen... just like he did for Joe the Plumber for instance. But this time he's picking on one private citizen who can actually stand up to him. I doubt that Obama would have the guts to take Rush up on the challenge, but wouldn't it be something to behold!|`|D6kwriPxaa	Rush is an entertainer, and he is doing everything he can to raise listenership.  If Rush wants to debate, let him run for office.|`|gMxtD2Xoaa	you don't challenge the president to a debate he is a an entertainer...<br>   why don't we get uncle milty to address congress  <br>  more and more idiots everyday <br>  less thinking everyday<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  are you all zombies...please no
flV8NKruaa	YES!!! Finally someone who sees the truth.<br>  <br>  The republicans have been enacting class warfare and wealth redistribution for decades.<br>  <br>  Why do rich people need tax breaks?<br>  Why do rich companies with billions in profits need government subsidies?<br>  Why is the rich only taxed at 15%, while people who do actual work are taxed at 35%?<br>  The poor and the rich get the most benefit from our government.  I cannot really fault the poor, but the rich have been getting richer and richer on the middle class!<br>  Why is it that the average CEO salary in 1970 was 40 times the average worker, but in 2007 the average CEO salary was 250 times the average worker?  How is that sustainable?<br>  <br>  KUDOS on your question!|`|089e8d35b7463b74daf5b60e025ccdc5aa	Yes, the Iraq war was the largest redistribution of wealth from the middle class to the wealthy in the history of the world.  And in fact, I believe it was the agenda of the Bush administration for its entire 8 years to redistribute wealth this way.  In that sense, the administration was a huge success.|`|AA10079277	Which policies would that be?  And if so, why haven't the democrats done anything about it?  We are in year 3 of Democrat control, how long before they finally do something?  What are they waiting for?<br>  <br>  The real sad part is that we are now bailing out these companies and crooks.  So they have no incentive to fix the messes they've created.  We are now encouraging them to screw up.  Brilliant policy....|`|kTOJ9XYcaa	No, unless their name are Susan Collins, Arlene Spectar and Olympia Snow.  <br>  <br>  So you think that you earned to keep what you think is wealth redistribution. <br>  <br>  DTG|`|BQY8b2YOaa	Nope. Learn this definition this definition of capitalism which has worked extremely well for over 200 years making us the most powerful nation in the world.<br>  <br>  Capitalism - <br>  an economic system characterized by private of corporate ownership of capital goods and by prices, production and distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in the free market.<br>  <br>  Of course there are ups and downs in this economy, capitalism. But the system has worked throughout our history. What Obama is doing is bringing us into an economic system that has been proven not to work throughout history i.e. socialism or communism. Learn the definitions of those terms and tell me how they do not apply to what Obama is doing.<br>  As for your question, I have to ask you one. Who creates employment in this economy? The wealthy. If they were not around there would be no middle class. <br>  As the saying goes "No one has ever gotten a job from a poor person".|`|1oxBCtmZaa	No, they didn't.<br>  <br>  It's not a zero sum game.       What I earn doesn't come at your expense, and what you earn doesn't come at my expense.   It's not a fixed pot of wealth.    Some people "got richer" faster than others - nobody "got poorer" when the GOP ran things.|`|Yzcptoagaa	I don't think you can blame Republican politicians for the entirety of the system that concentrates wealth in the hands of a few.  But that is a long-standing problem, and the Democrats are at least closer to the solution that the Republicans are.|`|AA11593583	Nope. It was Democrats. They were the ones who actually started this whole mess way back in Jimmy Carters time and they have only aggravated it with subsequent inaction on some things and actions on others. <br>  <br>  Do just a little research before you start laying ALL the blame on Republicans.|`|ujxh8Pb2aa	Yes, the Republicans always redistriute it upwards to the richest 1%, and the Dems trickle it downwards to the other 99% of the population.<br>  Yet they have more than 1% of the population vote for them, pretty amazing.|`|zI3YXvGLaa	if you look at the Avg Income in the US, it has decline over the last 8 years...despite the boom.<br>  <br>  The rich have gotten much richer...but the middle class has taken a hit.|`|gMxtD2Xoaa	yes as did the democrats <br>  <br>  they are two sides of the same coin.....|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	What Republican policies would these be and what percentage of Democrats in Congress supported or opposed them? Be specific naming actual Executive Orders and bills passed by Congress. Additionally name actions by Democrats which stood in defiance of such policy.|`|KHjgyGXSaa	No, no really.  You can save your money, you can invest your money or you can waste your money.  You do not have to spend it on one group vs another. you can do your own footwork and get answers you understand or you can hire someone and risk getting ripped off.  You can invest in a company you know or you can join an investment pool and risk being taken for a ride by some savy broker.  You are the one directing your economics right now.  Obama would like to change that. Taxes are the one exception to this rule.|`|ypSp9ieKaa	i dont see how they could, you know, since we have FREE MARKET. if YOU bought something from a republican, and you could have either not bought it or bought it from someone else, then its YOUR DECISION. now you see people are obtaining wealth , and you get njealous and make it seem like they got there from taking advantage of people. Its not. Its just class envy.|`|peEHzKGDaa	Yes, it's redistribution but from the poor to the wealthy.  Of course if it's from the rich to the poor, Cons call it "immoral".|`|AN9HVBZoaa	I'm not wealthy and I lived better before Obama was in office!|`|5Ho518J9aa	Yes. This is what is called the New World Order. But wait...it's Democrats, too. Did you actually think that someone could screw up this country this bad by accident, let alone a constantly changing chain of Presidents who pushed the same agenda further and further, alternating parties, toward Fabian Socialism? Is it just a funny coincidence that every major world leader and head of state is talking about a One World Government? Face facts, folks. Our nation is slipping through our fingers as we bicker over Partisan nonsense.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Both republicans and democrats are guilty of this.

A speaker who has learned the art of Athenian Oratory.<br>  <br>  First, while Gordon Brown was sitting with the President, Obama leans back slighly and turns his head away from Brown to ask someone off camera, "where are the Brits".  Obama then goes on to welcome the Prime minister - err [pause] Gordon Brown etc.<br>  <br>  For one moment there I thought we were gonna get a Bushism but no, instead we got the pause thing.<br>  <br>  What was on Obama's mind is how to convince the world that the plans for recovery are his own.  Unfortunately this is not so, because he has [drat] already told everyone it's Gordon's idea.<br>  <br>  Mainly this is to deflect any possible future flack when the whole pack of cards crashes to the ground.<br>  <br>  Well, good luck everyone and if you are still wondering where to put your money, how about Gold?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.goldprice.org/gold-price.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.goldprice.org/gold-price.html</a>|`|x12mMdApaa	when is this guy going to tell me how great I am.|`|aJWjqaAPaa	"Do not mention Gold"|`|LIpCGz4oaa	i must be on candid camera.
AA11963685	I think anyone that wants our President to fail isn't much of an American.  I didn't like Bush - but I sure didn't want him to fail at anything.  It just hurts the rest of us.  It seems like more people care about partisan sniping right now than they do the future of their country.  If they really cared about our problems, they wouldn't be hoping for Presidential failure.|`|HZy629kLaa	I don't but republicans want anyone who is not part of their angry insane base, like dems and independents, to suffer.  They are vindictive and want the country to fail and want layoffs everywhere, people living in the streets, foreclosures, soup lines.<br>  <br>  Republicans can be so angry and hateful.|`|TQYQUNYHaa	Rush does not want Obama to fail but what he and the Democrats are not on board for doing the right thing.

Rush limbaugh is a self confessed drug addict...I don't listen to anything he says or consider anything he suggests.|`|yRAU9MJDaa	Yea, that makes Rush a racist alright.  Obama's stimulus plan is doomed to fail because of the nature of the plan.  It has nothing to do with Obama, nor race.|`|qgvXbMMBaa	Yes. I like the fact that Obama is black and I think he's cool.

The affidavit of support constitutes a bond in the amount of $30,000.

To each his own  ;)|`|AA11142865	In NY it's illegal to smoke in public places - including bars.<br>  <br>  The disadvantage? Second hand smoke also leads to lung cancer! Read some health and science magazines.  The number of people who get lung cancer from 2nd hand smoke is equal to those that die from mesothelimoa which is an asbestos caused cancer. <br>  <br>  The people you are around, and ESPECIALLY the kids aren't smoking - and they shouldn't be forced to breathe in your smoke which is detrimental to their health. YOU are making the choice to smoke NOT the people around you. <br>  <br>  People should NEVER be allowed to smoke in front of children. <br>  <br>  2nd hand smoke leads to a slew of other respiratory conditions as well. <br>  <br>  You can be naked at home, but not in public. Same with cigarettes. Have one at home, but don't force everyone around you to breathe your smoke. <br>  <br>  I'm an ex smoker and I never smoked around my kids and I only smoked around other smokers. <br>  <br>  It's no longer debated, it's proven.|`|Hf94X5Wvaa	Yeah, no, see 2nd hand smoke actually isn't bad for you, just irritating and nasty smelling, since, y'know, all the medical reports claiming second hand smoke is deadly were actually based off a single report from the EPA which was crooked and mostly falsified from the beginning...<br>  <br>  I have a better idea, why don't we ban anyone who demands other people follow his way of life from public, then people can still smoke, and people who don't like smokers can just avoid it.|`|PPKuHl9baa	2nd hand smoke is harmful to others. The smell is worse though. The smell of cigarettes stick to everyone around them and is hard to wash off.|`|7bIrMvziaa	Well I don't think it will ever be banned from bars<br>  But they can get cancer from the smoke breathed out and the smoke burning off of the cigarette.|`|xbLl2fZRaa	smoking in bars is baned in some places in wisconsin and illinois|`|BUsMbbW1aa	I'm ok with that as long as smokers don't pay a vice tax on tobacco.|`|AA11476694	No and no.|`|FPUgQnIFaa	Second hand smoke is more harmful because the smoker is filtering it where as the 2nd hand is much more toxic.<br>  They are now also talking about 3rd hand smoke ie: on carpets, drapes, clothes, hair and on and on.<br>  <br>  In canada all smokes have to be covered now. They can't be open to the public eye anymore.<br>  <br>  I'm a smoker and I agree with the ban. The more it's hidden the less kids and teens will see it(other then ouside on the streets)<br>  Smoking is in my opinion one of the worst things you can do to your body-it prolongs healing times, kills your lungs, kids have asthma because of it and so many more reasons.|`|NicJVXfYaa	No.<br>  <br>  Compulsory morality is the greatest enemy of freedom. BTW, no conclusive study has proved the effects of second hand smoke from PUBLIC places. You walking outside with a smoker twenty feet from you, will not harm you. The British Medical Journal estimated that the amount of second hand smoke that is breathed in by non-smokers, is equivalent to about a grain of salt. Per year.|`|TSwPDDVjaa	My grandfather died of emphysema due to smoking is entire life, and my grandmother's lungs were in worse shape than his were, and had never smoked.  Obviously she might have been a rare case, but I really think people's lungs react differently to second-hand smoke, but how do we determine who those people are.  So yes, smoking should be banned from all public places.|`|RS6pMCZhaa	SHOULD it? yes<br>  IS IT HARMFULL TO OTHER PEOPLE? yes, it releases gas and when people smell it (breathe it in) its very bad for them/us.<br>  and 2nd-hand smoker's can STILL have lung problems thats 1 disadvantage<br>  <br>  i hope i helped you thank you|`|E9vflF0Caa	Yes cigarette should be banned because of its pernicious effects to the health of the society.

She's going to need to be living and working in Canada to get you there if that's what you two want.<br>  <br>  So, she goes home and gets to work on your immigration to Canada and building a financial future for the both of you there, and you get a second job if necessary to pay off those bills and get going.  <br>  <br>  There's no excuse for horsing around for all these years if you two really want a life together.  Keep doing what you've been doing all these years and you and your marriage are going nowhere and have no future.|`|2YLjd9uSaa	You should take back what you said about that officer. She did listen to you, and she took pity on you. If I had been working that day and heard your story, your wife would be in Canada right now. You owe her some gratitude, not criticism.<br>  <br>  You are the one who got married without making the proper arrangments for living legally in either Canada or the U.S. You are the ones who dragged your feet since 2005 and are still not prepared to live legally in one country or the other.<br>  <br>  Your wife was not given an I-94 valid for one month so that you could apply for an extension of stay a few days later. The form for an extension needs to be filed 45 days before the stay expires.<br>  <br>  Most Canadians do not receive an I-94 because most Canadians don't abuse U.S. immigration law by living in the U.S. since 2005 without an immigrant visa. I have no doubt that her application for an extension, if filed, would be denied. You certainly are not going to get an extension of one year.<br>  <br>  You placed yourselves in the position you're in.You should have handled it by now.

So not only will you need time to pay your debts but you'll also need it to wait for your application to be approved (unless you've already started that).<br>  <br>  Wish you the best!

Stewart posed the question why did Obama go to Canada before showing a clip of Obama almost saying "Iowa" when he meant to say "it is a great pleasure to be here in Ottawa." <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Stewart quipped that Obama went to Canada for his first foreign trip as president because he can "mess up" here, calling Canada the diplomatic equivalent of a pre-season game. <br>  <br>  <br>  The Daily Show also aired a clip of Obama signing the visitors book on Parliament Hill, to which Stewart asked "Canada has world leaders sign their guest book? Are you a country or a bed and breakfast? No disrespect." <br>  <br>  <br>  Stewart also poked fun at the fact that Obama spent only seven hours on Canadian soil, saying that his first diplomatic trip on the show's "How Long Americans Stay in Canada Scale" ranks above a firecracker prescription drug run and just below an underage Montreal bachelor party. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/capress/090225/entertainment/obama_cda_stewart">http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/capress/09022...</a>|`|089e8d35b7463b74daf5b60e025ccdc5aa	You can laugh at whoever you want to whenever you want.

AA11966821	Lots of erroneous assumptions here.  People on "fixed incomes" are generally the poorest people, e.g. retirees on Social Security.<br>  <br>  Inflation is killing a lot of people, especially those on fixed incomes, as property taxes, rents, utilities and especially food are rising in price.  Food prices are up over 10% in the past year.  People on fixed incomes do not spend money on things that are declining in price, as most of those are non-essentials.  The price of most items at McD's, et al, have risen 10% or more in the past year -- food has one of the highest inflation rates, after taxes and utilities (much of the utility increases are due to tax increases).

Obama is the most un-presidentail , dishonorable man to ever hold this office. He is a disgrace to America, to our Constitution, and to the american way of life. He is an admitted drug user, a manipulative pathological narcissist, and a true conartist. <br>  <br>  I am put off, not just because of his shallowness but also because there is an air of haughtiness in his demeanor that is unsettling. He is not a genius, In fact he is quite ignorant on most important subjects.<br>  <br>  Obama shows many symptoms of pathological narcissism, which is different from the run-of-the-mill narcissism. To him reality and fantasy are intertwined. This is a mental health issue, not just a character flaw. Pathological narcissists are dangerous because they look normal and even intelligent. It is this disguise that makes Obama treacherous.<br>  <br>  This narcissist Obama will say or do anything to reach his personal objective. He is focused on one thing and one thing alone and that is power. He has no time or interst in things that do not help him to reach this personal objective. All other issues are meaningless to him and he doesn't want to waste his precious time on trivialities. When in the Senate, If an issue was raised that did not help Obama in one way or another, he had no interest in it. His"present" votes were safe votes. No one could criticize him when things would go wrong. Those issues are unworthy by their very nature because they are not about him. Anything that does not help him personaly is beneath him and not deserving of his attention.<br>  <br>  Like most narcissists, he is callous and even ruthless. As the norm, narcissist lack a conscience. This is evident from Obama's lack of interest in his own brother who lives on only one dollar per month. A man who lives in luxury, who takes a private jet to vacation in Hawaii, and who has raised nearly half a billion dollars for his campaign has no interest in the plight of his own brother. Why? Because, his brother could not be used for his ascent to power.<br>  <br>  Obama cares for no one but himself. His election was like no other in the history of America. The issues were insignificant compared to what was at stake. There is nothing more dangerous than having a man bereft of conscience, a serial liar, and one who cannot distinguish his fantasies from reality as the leader of the free world! I hate to be an alarmist, but one is a fool if one is not alarmed by this dishonorable man. <br>  <br>  Obama has set America back decades... America is the bastion of freedom. The peace of the world depends on the strength of America, and Obama's weakness translates into the triumph of terrorism and victory of rogue nations.|`|pgn2eSpwaa	unfortunately any survey can be manipulated, <br>  of those answering 67% said they thought Obama was responding to the supposed economic CRISIS. <br>  <br>  that does not account for those who refuse to be polled, those who are not home when survey takers call, and those who have unlisted # <br>  and cannot be contacted<br>  <br>  just because he is a charismatic figure and is viewed as a more regal figure than GWBush does not mean he is effective at meeting the demands of the job....<br>  Since he took office the REcovery has cost the stock market and thus all businesses that can hire about 30% of their operating revenue, so <br>  they lay off more workers, causing greater hardship. <br>  that means those working will be footing the bill for more people not working, and our share of the cost of government will go up as well. <br>  <br>  It's a worse PONZI scheme than Madoff's, because nobody will get the payoff from it|`|YNj2i2Inaa	Let me answer on behalf of most conservatives, please:<br>  <br>  "It proves that the *****, alligator monkey boy has some JEW friends in this country who like all his fancy spendin and some QUEER as_s lumberjack fag buddies up north.

When the federal government initiates programs based on this tax revenue or projected revenue, the programs will eventually have to be funded by other means in order to sustain them. Such as the new health program signed by Obama. His actions have appeased some voters, until they realize the funding is not maintainable under the current system and the funding will eventually come out of their pockets in a form of new taxes on something else. So although the program sounds great on the surface, in the long run it will be unable to sustain under the current plan.|`|AA11447210	It would change little.

When you receive welfare all year and then get an additional load for earned income credit, which boils down to something for nothing, it's welfare on top of welfare. Plus they are getting a boost on it as well. Rewards for extreme failure as a human being. Punish the working class. Don't these types make you so proud?<br>  <br>  So, the next time you find that you have been taxed twice or there times on the same money that you've earned think of all of the help that you have given to these "under priviledged" welfare types.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Yes indeed. <br>  <br>  The Crash of 2008 has left the high priests of the Cult of Free Enterprise with a great deal of egg on their faces. The same politicians, businessmen, professional economists and media commentators who insisted ad nauseam that all economic problems were best left to the market, who denounced every social program as a drain on the national budget, pleaded, amidst the backdrop of failing banks, for gargantuan government bailouts to prop up their corrupt and crisis-ridden institutions. The advocates of private property and economic individualism had no compunction about placing the collective assets of the American people at the disposal of the banks. It was widely noted that the US government offered socialism for the rich, while insisting on capitalism for everyone else. Of course, government policy had nothing to do with socialism. All of the measures taken were aimed at securing the interests of the most powerful sections of the financial elite. But the massive state intervention in the economy has dealt a staggering blow to the intellectual legitimacy and prestige of capitalist ideology. This, in turn, clears the path for a resurgence of socialism and Marxism.<br>  Every historical crisis compels the major classes to adopt an independent standpoint and advance, with greater or lesser clarity, a class solution. The initial calls for national unity and common sacrifice will rapidly dissolve into mutual recriminations, mounting hostility and open conflict. It is not possible to chart in advance the precise timetable by which this process will unfold. Several years elapsed before the collapse of 1929 was answered by a movement of the working class. But that movement came, first in the form of the bonus marches of 1932 demanding unemployment relief, then in 1934 in the outbreak of insurrectionary strikes in Minneapolis, Toledo, and San Francisco. This was followed by the formation of the CIO in 1935 and the eruption of sit-down strikes 1936-37.<br>  There are many reasons to believe that the crisis this time will unfold more rapidly. First, even before the crisis had begun the American working class had experienced a protracted stagnation and decay in its living standards. The last 35 years have been characterized objectively be increasing exploitation. Moreover, for all the bluster and arrogance of the ruling elite, the position of American capitalism is in an historic sense far worse than it was in the early 1930s. There was a certain historical confidence that underlay Roosevelt’s assertion that there “was nothing to fear but fear itself.” As Trotsky said so well, “America’s wealth permits Roosevelt his experiments.” The situation today is vastly different. The trajectory of American capitalism, on a downward slope for decades, is now falling off a cliff.<br>  The objective crisis of American capitalism has far-reaching implications for the development of the social consciousness and political orientation of the working class. In the final analysis, the great problem of the development of socialist consciousness in America, even in periods of industrial militancy and violent class struggle, reflected the power and economically privileged position of American capitalism. This objective foundation of “American Exceptionalism”—the peculiar resistance of American capitalism to the challenge of socialism—belongs to the past. As history has so often shown, the intersection of global decline and economic crisis is a trigger for revolution.<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/jan2009/task-j13.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/jan200...</a><br>  While Keynesian measures provide no economic antidote to the breakdown of the capitalist economy, they do perform an important political function for the ruling class. Roosevelt's New Deal did nothing to end the crisis of the 1930s, but it did help create the illusion that a solution was possible and thereby performed an invaluable service in blocking the development of a socialist perspective in the working class.<br>  As world capitalism enters its most serious crisis since the breakdown of the 1930s, and the ruling classes draw on their own experiences, so the working class must assimilate the lessons of history. The only way of preventing a repeat of the experiences of the Great Depression, which culminated in the deaths of millions in World War II and the use of nuclear weapons, is the overthrow of the historically-outmoded profit system. The year 2008 marks a milestone in the disintegration of world capitalism; 2009 must become the starting point for a resurgence of the struggle for international socialism by the world working class<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/jan2009/pers-j02.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/jan200...</a>|`|AA10231921	why must the government ensure a prosperous life for all? that is not government's purpose.|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	<<a prosperous life for all?>><br>  <br>  make sure the republicans don't get back in control.<br>  however, capitalism is not a failure.<br>  it is, in fact, a spectacular success.<br>  it's not perfect, just as no system is perfect.<br>  but when you compare what's happened in the US compared to most of the world (up until 20-30 years ago) capitalism pushed the US ahead of everyone.<br>  <br>  want more proof?

It will be in all the history books and maybe you can catch up on it!|`|dfo8gSaraa	It's really very simple, he got more electoral college votes than McCain.<br>  This concept is not new because of Obama.<br>  <br>  See, winning an election without controversy (like the last 2 Bush wins) is something we're not used to seeing for a long time.<br>  Trust me, this last election is more the norm than the exception.|`|59iSPST0aa	I persoanlly think Opera had a lot to do with it.  She has LOTS of power and money.|`|FDVuAiHOaa	He got the most votes.|`|AA11963685	Two main reasons.  The first problem for McCain came over his pick of Palin.  After the honeymoon was over, she turned into a national joke and people seriously questioned his judgment in choosing someone clearly unfit to be a heartbeat away from the Presidency.  Then he told us all that the economy was fundamentally sound hours before Wall Street imploded.  That was the straw that broke that camel's back.  All of sudden everyone starting remembering McCain admitting he knew next to nothing about the economy and his chances to be elected went straight into the toilet.|`|03rOCajTaa	can you think of a million reasons...well there is your answer<br>  <br>  I have heard:<br>   he is looking out for the low income people<br>  they want a change<br>  one liked him b/c of his ears(she was 18 first time voting)<br>  wanted our troops back home<br>  he is full of ideas how to make US better<br>  of course you have some that claim they voted b/c he is "black" as I use that term loosley<br>  Personally I don't care if he is orange!

You very well could have a warrant for your arrest because you failed to appear (FTA). Pay it, Pay it, Pay it before they pull you over again and take you straight in. I agree. Do not write a letter. Just go pay it. If you cannot pay it in the next day or so, call them and at least tell them you intend to pay. As it appears to them right now, you aren't going to--so set them straight.

Not one of these staged things put on by a leftist media person and designed to make the Democrat look good?<br>  <br>  A REAL debate where each person gets to show what he's REALLY made of, with no MC fawning over the Democrat and tossing softball questions?<br>  <br>  I'd love it!  Limbaugh is no intellectual heavyweight, but he'd make mincemeat out of Mr. Teleprompter!|`|32cb8156ad7b656220324d46a1f150c3aa	only if Stearns is the questioner...<br>  <br>  <br>  and no ppe allowed.....|`|JthubNIsaa	Obama won't.

ROFL.<br>  <br>  Sorry Water... I get your point, but Rush Limbaugh is not what I would consider  a private citizen. Not by a long shot.|`|jLxBvXZ5aa	I would love to see it, but Obama is not up to the challenge.

Limbaugh would be crushed.  Limbaugh has never been in a real debate.  Whenever he is getting schooled, he shuts the mike off and rambles.  Ditto heads never notice this.|`|P8aBAmHKaa	If Obama debated Rush Obama would have to hang his brains on the wall to start off even with Rush|`|HZy629kLaa	Seems like we should be seeing a Limbaugh/Steele debate.

Obama made promises that he didn’t keep, he lied to the American people, and no amount of spin will change that. Obama won’t debate Rush because Rush will crush him with the truth.|`|CdGNZxLTaa	I would love to see Limbaugh a Obama debate! However I don't think Obama has it in him.<br>  You make a good point, Ideas is would should be debated/talked about not time wasted attacking each others personality etc etc|`|F6wwpbBWaa	Yes!   Rush will wipe the floor with B. Hussein Obama and as for the comment about Obama hanging up his brain to debate Rush, Rush can do this with half his brain tied behind his back just to keep it fair.|`|GSCD9vq3aa	Limbough would be kicked out the white house, do you think obama would debate with rush limbough, your probably 11 years old.|`|AA10231921	i would, but NO TELEPROMPTERS ALLOWED.|`|09aGRz8paa	i would like to see that.|`|6QLgIgxCaa	While it would be interesting it would never happen. Rush would win the debate even if he were on the wrong side of the issue (I don't think he is but just for the sake of argument) because he is not a politician and can say whatever he wants. Obama on the other hand has to be too diplomatic to ever win a debate, his speaking ability would not save him.<br>  <br>  What I do find disturbing is that dems and the media do not point out any flaws in the substance of what Rush said but rather divert attention by saying he wants Obama to fail or point out how powerfull Rush is compared to the leader of the RNC.

To try to silence a voice simply because you don't agree with it is a violation of these freedoms that are set forth in the US Constitution.<br>  <br>  If you don't like him, don't listen to him.  If you disagree with what he says, then find a forum for you to express your own views.|`|MM8rqTMtaa	I would hope that it would, but I doubt it.  It's one thing when we hold our little bash parties on forums like this one, but it's another when the government is the one attacking someone critical of the administration.

"To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public."|`|SSeWnDPkaa	I'm so scared of Communists...I can't wait to the republicans take control and we finally have a true dictatorship....(this was just written to downplay the first guys ridiculous ish).<br>  <br>  In my opinion if someone did what Rush did to President Bush after 9/11 then they would have been considered traitors and would have possibly faced jail time.  Rush is an entertainer.  <br>  <br>  Democrats should reinstate the fairness doctrine so no one side can rule the media and the problem would be solved.|`|4a2b4c38598195f530e54c08fa3e232aaa	Oh please. Are you implying that the democrats started this campaign?  I hate to break it to you, but Rush started this campaign because he is a media whore and the republicans for backing down after they made some comments about what a bag full of crap he is.  <br>  <br>  How exactly is this a direct assualt on freedom of speech.   Please tell me, I would love to know.  By your  little diatribe, because someone doesn't agree with Rush's BS rants, somehow his freedom of speech is being infringed upon.  Give me a break.|`|kzNnMrMHaa	You can only talk trash and lies for so long before people start wising up and it is happening now. The liberals are using the GOP and Rush as diversions to the inept and corruption of this administration. The world's investor's have already wised up to this administration's irresponsible fiscal policies as evidenced by the plummeting stock market.|`|eoXRd3lIaa	Rush is not the question. The question is, Do you cherish free speech? My suggestion to all! get a copy of the Constitution,fold it up, put it away and forget about it.

Freedom of speech does NOT entail freedom from criticism.  The Democratic Party's effort to equate the mainstream GOPers with a far-right loon like Limbaugh (along with his pathetically devoted fanbase of delusional Dittoheads) is simply them expressing their own free speech.  "Tit for tat, in other words."<br>  <br>  Quite the contrary, the Democrats and liberals in general benefit every time Rush opens his fat mouth, spewing the exact same rhetorical dreck that has been the backbone of the conservative movement since the 1960s.  His insistence on trying to goad Obama and others within the Democratic Party establishment into a mudslinging match with his firebrand, in-your-face, and patronizing manner will surely turn away the majority of Americans who aren't exactly on the far fringes of either end of the political spectrum.  The only thing that is truly backfiring is the far-right's lame attempt to continue branding Obama as a "socialist."<br>  <br>  Keep it up, Rush!  You're doing a "heckuva" job to help ensure a Democratic supermajority in 2010.|`|Ht4lD0XTaa	It worked for Hillary in the "Great Right Wing Conspiracy" campaign.  Obama however doesn't have enough brains to power Hillary's big toe, so yes I think it will back fire on them.  Obama is weak and those that think Rush doesn't have a right to be heard need to leave this country.  I've had this same argument with liberals before and it is apparent they do not believe in our rights to free speech.  They apparently do not have the intelligence to turn the channel if they don't like what they hear.|`|UpZFb6X5aa	No,I don't.<br>  <br>  It's not a freedom of speech issue, like the conservatives who are objecting to any criticism are trying to lie and twist it into. Limbaugh--or anyone else--can say whatever they please.<br>  <br>  SO CAN THE REST OF US!<br>  <br>  Here's your "freedom of speech" according to Rush and his apologists--he gets to insult people, lie, and say anything he pleases. But if anyone dares to object or criticize what he has tosay--why , then, we're "trying to take away his free speech."<br>  <br>  BULLS**T. If I--or anyone sees fit to respond to what the says by criticizing it--that is OUR right of free speech.<br>  <br>  And REAL Americans are not going to be fooled or intimidated into silence.|`|djUMvICoaa	I think the Democrats need something to keep the spotlight off Obama.  He seems like he's getting more and more unsure of himself since taking office.  While doing that  campaign trail he seemed unflappable, now he has to dig for what he wants to say.  I would be looking for something else to  divert attention away from the obvious too.  Along with what he has told the people he wanted to do and not being able to get it is going to make for all kinds of potshots at him.|`|f9f4407b08469472a7b821eb01936d16aa	This is not a direct assault on freedom of speech. No one is trying to shut that fat lying drug addict up. Long may his foul breath pollute the airwaves.<br>  <br>  However.<br>  <br>  In a time of national crisis he is openly and proudly hoping for the president, and the country, to fail. Why? So he can somehow prove that he is right. For him politics matter more than people. Politics matter more than country. Politics matter more than patriotism.<br>  <br>  Funny how it was treasonous to suggest that Bush was wrong. But now it's somehow f*cking brave to actively encourage failure so your party can take control again. Is this man insane? Are the people who listen to him so addled with hate that they want the country to fila so they can - what - effect a coup?<br>  <br>  If the politicans who kneel before Rush Limbaugh - a fat, failed, thrice divorced, drug addict hypocrite are not men enough to stand up to a bloated lying loser, then they deserve to lose their upcoming elections. And every single one of them will...<br>  <br>  Bottom line, if criticizing George Bush was treasonous behavior,  then wishing Obama and the counrty fails is treasonous too. Period. End of discussion. If Republicans are going to make rules, then the least they can do is live by them and not be such blatant lying hypocrites.|`|ipWRgKetaa	Yep. It always does.|`|32cb8156ad7b656220324d46a1f150c3aa	The only two errors I see are <br>  1. President Obama responding to Rushs' comments. 2.

Big time.<br>  <br>  The Democrats have always wanted us to do as they say, not as they do.  It is becoming much harder for them to even try to hide this fact.|`|AA10079277	It does not matter.  It is way too early for any election/party stuff to matter.  It is all trivial pandering to divert attention from the mess we're in.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	WHAT ASSAULT are you talking about?? <br>  Rush is running his mouth off, which he has every legal authority to do. By opening his mouth.. he accepts the responsibity that OTHERS will excercise their OWN FREEDOM  of speech, to respond to his ranting. <br>  If the shoe fits, wear it. <br>  Or did you think that Rush can say anything he chooses, and NOT have anyone express their opinion of his stupidity? <br>  I repeat.. there is no assault on his right to speak. There darn sure IS an assault on the content of what he says, or may be trying to do. <br>  It is no different that Jerry Springer, who sets up acts of hostility and conflict on his show, for NO OTHER REASON than to make money off persons who think that is entertainment. Much of talk radio/ tv, operates on the same idea.. <br>  The reality is that this country has problems that NEED to be solved, by persons working as a team, not to put on a show. Limbaugh is a leader at inciting arguments.|`|rJLeVoMKaa	I think the criticism of Rush is caused by two things: 1-His popularity and ability to give a voice to the average everyday person.  2-He holds the Republicans especially the conservatives feet to the fire of accountability by making them take stock of the leadership.  3-He is not liked by the Washington elites because he is not one of them.  He criticizes both parties when they do not follow the tenants of the Constitution to act tyrannical.  He is seen as a threat to their power because he makes the average American think for themselves in a motivated manner that leads action.  In a sense, he is like the Samuel Adams or Thomas Payne of the 21st century.

The latest is that the government is going to set up some kind of board that will insure that there is "diversity" on the airwaves.  Only one conclusion can be made from this.  Our only chance is that the congress starts to get scared for their jobs.  I don't think that will happen this time.  I do not think that they think we are going to be able to do any thing about it.  They hope to make such drastic changes so fast that it will be too late when the country wakes up.  The goal is to make it impossible to get rid of the changes and impossible for the Republicans to ever get back into power.

bARPX1auaa	You make some good points.  Giving OUR taxes back to us would be a better stimulus plan for the economy.<br>  <br>  If one understands the monetary system, inflation, fractional reserve banking practices and taxation you have no choice but to be skeptical as to what, if any, benefits will come from the stimulus plan as presented.<br>  <br>  I actually question if there is another agenda that we (the people) are not aware of.  It sure seems as though there is a movement within government to collapse the economy for the purpose of introducing the Amero and Socialist World Government.  All the indicators are present.|`|NiYIPrkQaa	It really depends, in some cases giving money to these large companies when they are in trouble can actually boost consumer confidence. However, when we are in a deep recession, it is far better to stimulate the consumers as you have stated then it is to give money to sinking ships. The Government hesitates to give consumers money because they believe the consumer will only pay down bills and save the rest resulting in no significant consumer spending. I believe that if the consumers in a recession received a stimulus in a larger form on the order of several thousand dollars then, yes!, we would pay down bills, but in addition we would also create disposable income and begin spending again. There is no right answer here, it's mostly a matter of opinion.|`|i2eZXTgkaa	Here's an example: food stamps.  The package has a lot of money for food stamps in it, and when poor people get them they run out and buy food.  They can't put it in the bank, and it is no good not being used.  The owners of the store selling food then make money, and are able to hire more people because their business is doing better.  In the meantime, people without enough food have food.  Apparently, food stamps are _the most_ stimulative, resulting in 1.73 of stimulus for every dollar spent<br>  <br>  Added: Awesome Nana: hey, don't take my word for it, take the word of the economist (Mark Zandi, one of McCain's economic advisers during the campaign) whose testimony before Congress is at the link.

I agree, alcohol is MUCH worse. I've never heard of anyone getting into a car accident because they were stoned. It doesn't effect your vision hardly at all, not like alcohol does. Sure, there are some stronger versions that could cause "hallucinations" but that is very rare. Alcohol causes worse than hallucinations, it causes you to have double vision and effects your brain so badly you don't know what the hell is going on. I really think they should legalize it and save the space in jail for the really bad people, people who kill other people, rob, rape, and assault...so much worse than people who smoke pot.|`|a531cd98fd2b70b96fa7a80f7571935eaa	Because corporate shills want to control the public.

There is only 1 reason why recreational drugs are illegal... and that is MONEY. The people selling/importing them are making trillions which is funneled through banks which make billions off the money.    On the other side...the drug laws prop up the justice system giving tons of jobs to cops, judges, probation officers, halfway house councilors, all the way down to people who collect pee in a cup and test it.  When someone is busted the state seizes money, cars, property and the person is sent off to a private prison which is paid by the state for housing them and in turn can use them for slave labor.  The truth is Aspirin and Tylenol kill more people than cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and ecstasy combined while tobacco kills about 25 times as many yearly.  The war on drugs is used to strip Americans of their rights, institute a police state, and to make money.

If your fingerprints aren't taken, how does one verify that it was actually you that was cited at the time of the incident.  <br>  I suspect that your name will be in a localized database but if the train is asssociated with the government, access will be allowed to other government agencies.

el8yX5q3aa	I agree with you.  Everyone should pay equal taxes....and everyone should be FORCED TO WORK.  If you are on a government program...let the government find a job for you and you get off of welfare  in so much time or you are off the money train.<br>  <br>  First off...Why do you think this money was given to us?  WE worked  and EARNED this money you want to take!  We didn't just sit back and collect it.  We EARNED IT!  YOU GO OUT AND EARN IT!   Second...who do you think helps the poor with jobs and charities and other things?  Poor?  Get real...we have given cars to people and helped paid their mortgage and bought food and clothes and play Santa to three families a year ...bought refrigerators..paid utilities and dentist and doctor bills...bought medicine  etc.    OTHER people that have money do the SAME THING.....STOP SAYING WE ARE SELFISH...we GIVE AND GIVE AND GIVE..and you know what...that will stop when we have to give it all away.    You don't want Blacks and others being generalized...stop saying we are selfish.  WE are the ones that give to YOU...we are the ones that give to grants etc....not YOU!<br>  <br>  Granted...SOME need it...I have no problem with that...but let's be fair.  There are plenty of them having babies and doing things to stay on welfare to get free money...and I have seen it and YOU have seen it...and they need to get off their butts and work.  <br>  <br>  I work in the public and see people with those food stamp credit cards...getting lobster and shrimp and their kids have cell phones and Ipods..(not even cheap mp3's...but IPODS...and PSP's...and how are they on welfare?  I just don't get it when we work two jobs and buy HAMBURGER!<br>  <br>  Making some people pay more..and making businesses pay more is going to cut back on charities...benefits and jobs and make people more dependent on BIG GOVERNMENT....so they can sit back with their hands out.<br>  <br>  Now everyone cool down....if you need it OK...but let me add...my husband and I worked two and three jobs each to make our family work...and pay our bills.  Why can't others do that.??  I see them working ONE Job and not making it and complaining and getting welfare when they can work.  It certainly would cut back on trouble and affairs etc.....<br>  <br>  We paid our bills...we paid out our home and we put our kids through college without grants and help.  We help others too....but asking us to give our money up that we worked hard for ...what incentive it there for businesses or people to do well?  We can all sit back and collect money...and not pay taxes.  <br>  <br>  People need to be RESPONSIBLE about what they buy and need and put on credit and pay for what they need.  We paid our bills and paid for food and clothes...we did not go out and buy things we could not afford and our children had to deal with that.  Go out and PLAY...that is what you do.....not sit in front of a computer and TV and play games on the computer.  <br>  <br>  If more people were responsible we would not be in this recession as we are now.  It is those that abused the system...bought above and beyond their means...used Clinton's excuse that  you could use food stamps to buy a home...etc.<br>  <br>  I can understand people wanting to BUY a home...but you save for it and you afford what you buy.  We didn't buy our first home until we were almost 40.....we just could not afford it.  Now we have our second home we BUILT and it is paid for.!  <br>  <br>  If we hit a depression...people would KNOW what it is like to not have those things they went into debt for.  <br>  <br>  America will become more socialist.  We are already to a certain degree. <br>  <br>   I have often said...I wanted Obama to succeed...because if it is good for America then it is good for me.  But it is not.  I do not want him to succeed because it is NOT good for America.  HE IS NOT GOOD FOR US.  He is going to make things 3 TRILLION TIMES WORSE!<br>  <br>  When only less than 15 percent of the stimulus is going to the people...and the ONLY JOBS created are GOVERNMENT jobs...what is there for the private sector?  Listen....those that think this is good...you have no idea what government will do to your life.  You are allowing them to CONTROL IT...and you think you will have a say.  You will not.  You are blind if you think that.  Blind and stupid.  <br>  <br>  The Government is supposed to support the people...not take over them....and they are not supporting us.  WHAT ARE THEY DOING TO SUPPORT the people?  What are they doing to make us strong and independent and create businesses that will stimulate the economy and allow them to prosper?<br>  <br>  This Government is BIG BROTHER...and believe me...you will not like it.  You will not have the say you have now.  You are young and foolish and immature if you think otherwise.  You want the money and the free rides without working for it...without earning it.  Don't tell me you deserve it when you are in your 20's and 30's .......you haven't done enough in your life to EARN anything.  We have to work to retire and now we have to hold off until we are 70 to pay for the young and yet the young are the ones bitching....we want more...we want more.<br>  <br>  We want more too...we want to be able to have a say in our medical and financial that we worked all our lives to have so we can rest in our older years.  You young people have a life to live...you should work...you should pay taxes...you should pay your way and stop asking for mommy and daddy and others to pay for you.<br>  <br>  I hope when you young are older like we are...you have NOTHING....and you have to struggle and people take everything from you.  When the government does that......remember.....YOU WANTED IT.  It might seem a long way off to you...but let me tell you...years go by quickly...your life goes by quickly....you will be here...just like us.|`|I9FOycm6aa	Like the guy who robbed banks once said, Cause that's where the money is...|`|qeLikL8Haa	they have more to tax and spar then a poor person|`|687852ecae21fabd1dfd4f89a2eefd48aa	The rich have a LOT of excess monies.<br>  <br>  It costs people the same to live each year.

Every time the economy starts to tank the rhetoric about taxing the rich to pay the poor comes out. By and large what happens is some numbers get shifted, A few people pay more, a few people pay less. The large majority of taxpayers will see very little real change from this. One of my soap box issues the last 10 or so years is that when someone comes along proposing any real overhaul of our taxation system, they get ran down by those who are deeply invested in the status quot. Washington is chocked full of people who are deeply invested in the status quot. One of the main problems with taxation is that the current system is completely out dated and in serious need of a major overhaul to begin with. Every single politician that has proposed this over the last 10 to 15 years(And maybe longer) has been shoved to the sidelines by those who are invested in the way things are done now. The problem is not with who is taxed. It is with the system of taxation and oversight currently being practiced in this country.|`|BHyIl8pJaa	We tried Reaganomics which is taxing the middle and lower classes, and giving tax cuts to the upper 1%.  Both Bushes followed in Regan's footsteps.  Regan also believed in spending no matter the deficit, and look where this has gotten us. Over 11 trillion in debt and many middle class families losing their homes.  The Reps. thought that cutting taxes on the rich would trickle down to the lesser, but this has been proven false.  If we continue to let the rich get richer, the poor will only get poorer, and then who are you going to tax?  If America has been good to you (the upper 1%) then you should show your gratitude by paying these taxes and quit complaining.  Is it not enough to be really well off, Do you really need all the money?<br>  My family runs two mid sized companies and make more than many americans, and we do not mind paying a little more to benefit from this nation.  It all comes down to how greedy you really are and how much you care about the future of a once great nation.<br>  Where would this 1% go if they left and be better off than they are here?  China...ha ha, Russia, are you kidding me?  This nation has the resources and advantages that many others do not share, and I say if you want to leave, then go!  Others will then have an opportunity to take up where they left off.  It is called a Free Market for a reason.|`|LvELjQ2saa	so you'd rather have the lower class of the united states taxed higher? great idea considering we are in a recession, which affects the middle class/lower class more than the rich.  rich people are  still making a lot of money, maybe not as much, but enough to continue their lifestyle.  this is not true for our middle class.  they've had their wealth cut in half over the past year, and cutting the middle classes wealth in half creates a much bigger burden for our economy, obviously.  sorry bro, trickle down economics doesn't work in times like these.|`|W8VmNhJQaa	Oh please--we're so sorry the rich have to pay more.

The media is the reason this underqualified man is president, and over the next four years ppl will see how detramental he is going to be to our country. Congress focusing on steroids is absurd, and so is our media. Heath Ledger dies and is on the news for weeks, when 25,000 children die every day from malnurishment.

Reason for freedom, reason to raise democracy, reason to free the female rights, reason to destroy the fanatics before they grow any stronger and kill us all. The argument we get is; America is the nation who brought the plague of terrorism. My argument to this is, America started the campaign to destroy these lethal creations by the cia to prevent future destruction.....better stop it before it grows big- show them the power and make them think more than once before they act.<br>  <br>  CIA bred osama, saddam due to reasons which are based on political issues(SURE, there is always PROS AND CONS).<br>  <br>  Why should Bush see the Soviets failure??

Even though I would not put it exactly like that. Come on McCain produced his birth certificate, just like Bill Clinton, and every other person that has run for the office of the President of the United States of America. Why has Obama refused to do that?<br>  <br>  What was it about my post that caused someone to give it a thumbs down? Did I offend someone?|`|Z6TNsJluaa	The people has voted. They wanted change.

My mom was born in Hawaii before it was a state. Her birth certificate says "The Territory of Hawaii".

KKH9y0ECaa	I don't see how Brown was the Chief Architect of the financial crisis, surely the seeds of the crisis were sown with the US Housing Sub Prime Mortgage Crisis.<br>  <br>  Easy credit and the lending policies of the banks were universal and although I am not a fan of Brown, he can not be blamed as the Chief Architect of a Global Crisis, nor is Britain some form of economic superpower able to bring the global economy single handedly to it's knees.<br>  <br>  In terms of solutions to the crisis, both Brown and Obama are trying to kick start their respective economies through public spending using Keynesian economic policies, whose architect was John Maynard Keynes rather than Brown.<br>  <br>  As for the press conference it seemed very awkward, however Obama can not distance himself from Brown whilst at the same time calling for Britain to send more troops to Afghanistan. It should also be remembered that Britain's contribution in Afghanistan is second only to the US and that Britain has been allied with America in the so called War Against Terror since the events of 9/11.|`|AA11530144	You seem to know something the rest of the world dosen't know?

He took the war on terror to the enemy instead of fighting these animals in your back yard. he had to sign bills so loaded down with lib pork that it two interns to carry them into his office just to get one little thing he wanted.

It's ok to admit that our past president was wrong...just get over yourselves already.|`|OA3Mgsuaaa	Sigh.<br>  when are you going to realize that this recession was not caused by government spending? This crisis was caused by thepoor lending practices of banks. Lending practices that were mandated by the Democratic Congress in an effort to increase homeownership by the poor. Banks were threatened , and fined, for not loaning funds to minorities and in depressed markets, regardless of the ability of those people to pay the funds back. Now the Democratic congress grills the same bankers asking them what they were thinking. <br>  Now we have a new President that rushes through a pork laden stimulus bill, that only provides 1/3 of the funds in the next 12 months. Over a half of a trillion dollars is slated to be spent in 2-4 years. Then he approves a budget increase that will dwarf any deficit run up by Bush.<br>  You cant have it both ways.

For so called religious people they sured don't understand karma at all. It doesn't matter if they blame Obama. We sane people have to ignore them. You can't argue with an insane person & expect them to get anything from it. You have to just remain strong & centered. So what is next for the dems.

Sometimes I agree with them and sometimes I don't. I have some liberal views and a few more conservative ones.

Both can dole out punishments.|`|AA11312653	IMO any nearby adult should rebuke, reprove, chide, admonish, or just plain yell at any nearby misbehaving child. If you avoid actually striking the child, it is very unlikely that the consequence will be worse than dealing with irrate parents. A little trick I learned from Miss Manners is to grasp the child firmly by the wrist or upper arm while saying very very sweetly "Please be careful, Angel. You could get hurt doing that." MM goes on to explain that by "grasping firmly" she means with considerable force -- enough pressure to convey to the child where there hurt may be coming from but not so much as to leave tell-tale bruises in the shape of your fingers. <br>  <br>  Etiquette does not mean one has to stand by and do nothing when poorly supervised children are negatively impacting ones own activities.<br>  <br>  How parents are to impress upon a 3 year old the undesirability of failing to restrain the natural impulse to run, scream, and touch everything in sight without resort to a swift swat on the posterior is something I have not been able to discover. At home or on play dates, a "time out" may be very well. When busy parents have no choice but to brings tots along for shopping and other errands, then the "time outs only, no butt swats" model means that the child, and not the parent, is in control of the itinerary. Sorry, but I can't spare 10 minutes for "quiet time" every hour or so during a busy day.<br>  <br>  I was pleased by the way a neighbor dealth with the situation. Her 10 year old daughter threatened to call Child Protective is the mother spanked her. Mother told her "I can't stop you from making the call. Here is a grocery bag. Put every thing you are going to need for the next two years into it, because you will be in foster care and not here after you make that call."|`|BY02DhfWaa	the people that made that rule up is the people that don't have kids they have to be corrected or they will end up in jail at the age of 10. i correct my children now if the school don't beat them like they did when i was in school  they are able 2 but a step mom or dad don't have the right because that just makes them rebel . because the step parent is not blood and they just come in and try to take over and it dont work that way .|`|oojO4WAraa	People and police and teachers are all allowed to correct children.|`|RYQ3i0ZNaa	If you have to resort to physical force to discipline your child, you are a crap parent, end of.

I WILL be the one correcting MY children.|`|S5H0NmEWaa	Your question is flawed because it isn't clear what you mean by "correct children" or "not allowed".<br>  <br>  Are you saying that parents are not permitted to discipline their own children? Because that isn't the case. Unless you think that the only means of "correcting children" is to use unreasonable physical violence against them.<br>  <br>  Are you suggesting that the police cannot arrest or caution children? Because there has never been a wider range of youth-targeted penalties. ASBOs were introduced with children principally in mind.<br>  <br>  I dread to mention school, as you probably think caning should be reintroduced, so that teachers should be given the automatic right to beat children.<br>  <br>  The problem with schools - which is symptomatic of the wider problem, such as it is (and it's not as bad as you probably think) - is that ordinary people are not taking responsibility for widespread adult selfishness and negativity which both stigmatises young people and means that parenting no longer focuses on discipline and respect in a meaningful and healthy way.<br>  <br>  Be under no illusions, though - the bleeding-heart liberals you probably loathe are no worse than the flog-'em brigade like you. Neither approach puts the child at the centre. (And if you think that putting the child at the centre means pandering to a child's immature, selfish desires, then that is a great example of what I'm referring to).|`|HctybHFvaa	im 14 not 21 plus but im still answering your question.

These professional qualifications are really the determining factor.

Not an easy endeavor.|`|dAsrWr3Maa	It all depends on what state your in and what the laws are as far as expungement in your state.  I'm almost certain that you can't have your record sealed unless the conviction date was when you were a juvenile.  As far as expungement: In the state of NC the only way to expunge your record is to be charged but not conviced of the crime.  If you were convicted then its very doubtful it will be expunged, but you can check further into that in your state.  You'll need to fill out a petition of expungement at your court house and file it with proper personnel.  If im not mistaken you actually "serve" a copy to the DA and they will forward it to the judge to be reviewed.  You can only have one expungement in your life time so make sure its something you wanna do and stay clean from now on.

39KUKALFaa	You know I am highly critical of Obama, but Bush does deserve to be tried.  I do not really think that he is guilty of what you say he has done, but I do believe that he extended the war to keep the price of oil up. so let him be prosecuted!|`|Cs6oslgpaa	OK|`|kTOJ9XYcaa	Sorry, God tree he did not kill them but the Islamofascism kill them.<br>  <br>  DTG|`|Xv9AaAl2aa	Lets try focusing on the big issue at hand for the country right now; the economy!!!!  Going around crying about Bush (and yes it's crying like a baby) instead of talking about this bail out plan(s) is a weak attempt to take the public's eyes off the fact that O'bambam is wayyyy out of his league!
S5H0NmEWaa	Scenario: a fire has broken out.<br>  <br>  Person A doesn't know what to do, so he runs out of the building screaming.<br>  <br>  Person B spots the fire, but doesn't know where the fire alarms are so he runs to his manager and yells "fire".<br>  <br>  Persons C, D, E and F are in the office and hear Person B yelling "fire". They leave their desks and crowd into the lift. Person G thinks you shouldn't use the lift, but knows where the fire alarms are, so he hits the button. The fire alarm sounds, and the safety system disables the lift.<br>  <br>  Person B's manager runs out of his office and yells "everybody to the emergency gather point!" <br>  <br>  Person H runs out of his office and yells "everybody out the back fire escape!"<br>  <br>  Person I was on a cigarette break outside when the fire alarm went off, so he and Persons J and K go to the pub.<br>  <br>  Person L thinks it's a fire drill and stays in the staff room, listening to his iPod.<br>  <br>  Thirty minutes later, you have three staff in the pub, four trapped in the lift, a dozen round the back of the building, a dozen more at the emergency point, four burning to death in the lift and one in the staff room. When the fire brigade arrive, nobody can tell them how many people are in the building.<br>  <br>  If everybody knew what to do - sound the alarm, use the emergency exits and gather at the designated place - then mess avoided.|`|AA11206283	Because people panic in emergency situations, and having a clear, well defined plan of action will minimize the panic effects.|`|avhgLEu8aa	To make it easier and clearer for people to know where they should go, what they should do etc. That's why some places have fire drills, so they know what to do.|`|DyTFo9vJaa	because when there is a fire everyone freaks out and will get hurt if there is no procedure, this is also the reason they have fire drills, so that when there is a fire everyone has it in their head to be calm and go out whatever door you go out when you do the drills|`|cx2EmEHtaa	In the Kings Cross station (UK) fire a number of people died because they tried to go back the way they came in instead of to the nearest emergency exit|`|BUsMbbW1aa	Too avoid chaos in the actual event of a fire.|`|hMrMvOWfaa	If you don't "the consequences will not only be to put yourself and who is with you in immediate danger but also to risk the lives of others who may need to save you under worst conditions than a planned evacuation plan."|`|h2pgvZYuaa	Because when you are in a situation where adrenaline is running high and everyone is scared, if you don't have a clear thought out plan thing can get confusing quickly and people can get disoriented.|`|AA11506593	So that people don't die. So that people know main & alternate routes to evacuate from. So that people have a fighting chance of surviving.|`|UZcUIfwIaa	It helps avoids panic when people know what they need to do.

gSGQcgeLaa	This is why you need to THANK EVERY VETERAN YOU COME IN CONTACT WITH.   They go through the bloody hell of a mess that war is, all the way across the world so that we can sit at home and play on Yahoo Answers and sleep safely and soundly...Thank you to all veterans and active duty reading this!|`|WcTZ7n8waa	My grandpa was a veteran. He used to do the same thing. He died when I was two but he told me about it. He said that when he went away he did some bad things that he hates. Now that I'm older I know what he meant.|`|uAHutoJzaa	Went there, did that, moved on when I came home.|`|YCXxP43Laa	Yes with my grandfather and Great Uncles, though that was in the 2nd world war, I'm in England so none of my relatives went though the horror of Vietnam!<br>  <br>  I know people from the Falkland's war, and the first Gulf war. <br>  <br>  My friends husband was serving when an embassy was blown up about ten years ago; he had to pull out body parts etc, and there were young children in pieces. He never really recovered... it's called survivors guilt. He seems ok most of the time but is a very heavy drinker.<br>  <br>  Yes it's sad; but unfortunately war is, and you're right your grandad is a great and courageous man!|`|WYPEG8l7aa	My grandpa served in WW2 and he's never done anything like that he was in the infantry too and got his legs shot to hell. He could still walk and all that but the scars are messed up.|`|AA10925759	He is or was one of those guys. <br>  <br>  I am a career soldier and all of my family has been so. I have seen the most horrid things on the planet. <br>  <br>  Over the years there is only one left from my original team... me. We all made life choices. We are not talking about a year or two but decades. <br>  <br>  There are two types.  Those who bemoan the fact that they were in a war forever until the end of time. <br>  <br>  Or others. Those who celebrate life and honor those who have been lost. My heart hurts in a way. My wife knows all. She knows about when I was on the run from people for days. She knows who I am.<br>  <br>  I chose to celebrate life.
AA11598520	Or that he's not concerned with the daily ups and downs of the market? The man says one thing one moment and says or does the opposite the next. How anyone can believe what he says still amazes me.|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	You know how many millionaires were made during the great depression who bought stocks low and made millions when WW2 erupted and the economy healed?  Yea, it is not a bad idea.  Buy stocks at their worst and let them sit for years and increase.  It is common sense people.|`|K71Qoakwaa	It has dropped out of continuing negative momentum, and would have dropped a lot more if Obama pursued the GOP's "do nothing" strategy.<br>  <br>  As for me, I'm BUYING!  More General Electric!  Dow Chemical!|`|AA11450062	Well it is common sense that you buy when it is low. This is simple stuff people.|`|flU2gf54aa	I'll be buying again as soon as the bottom hits and starts a climb. Right now cash is king.|`|IMPh53Ssaa	I know I have stopped contributing to my 401k since October, It won't stop until about a year from now the bad times will keep rolling|`|gwLtwEnOaa	Your premise that the stock market drops is Obama's fault are in error.<br>  <br>  The stock market is dropping because all the major banks/corporations are in a cash/debt crunch and can't cover their expenses so they are getting cash by liquidating their investment vehicles which are, in turn, giving them even more mass losses, ROFL.<br>  <br>  If you want to 'blame' something for this, it was the mark/market Enron accounting rule adopted by a Bush family goon in the late 90s for Ken Lay.<br>  <br>  Obama is definitely at fault in one way ... he -still- hasn't made that accounting rule illegal ... so all the bank balance sheets are all still fraudulent.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, buying stocks until all of this liquidation is over may help the banks and stabilize the economy but is not immediately sound investment advice for right now ... because the bad stuff isn't over.|`|lTx8Hoheaa	Obviously you don't know much about the stock market.<br>  <br>  Right after a big drop is the best time to buy.
xxDjV6Axaa	Nothing this man says has been the truth.  I don't see why that is so hard to understand.  I think we could put together a volume of the lies he has told so far.|`|AA11424005	Economics are obviously not Barak's strong suit.
2rcSILkWaa	So...what you're saying you'd feel better if he said he wouldn't go after tax avoidance schemes.  That sounds just like Republican logic.<br>  <br>  I know you're trying to make a point, but just like most positions, you're not thinking logically.|`|JV75Iz3eaa	Geithner is quite the pants load, just like his boss.|`|sTSBk9jhaa	Yup!|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	Team Obama.  They are the new Godz of the universe and don't have to obey the laws that everyone else does.|`|25faf33e24f40cd4a39b1314c62123a4aa	Just another Obama administration "Do as I say not as I do"
sMssDP1Xaa	Of course it matters.  It's a clear signal that the free market has no confidence in Obama's plans.  <br>  <br>  The fallout will be the American people who will not be able to afford to retire since their 401k's are now worthless.|`|X81oLqMtaa	Have you forgotten that the DOW dropped nearly 50% in the last year of Bush's term?<br>  <br>  In terms of numbers, Bush's 50% (approx. 6,500 points) was a lot more than Obama's 30% (approx. 1,200 points).|`|33b29bdd98f8d8d34167893336d47bfeaa	The position of the market and the economy at the beginning of term really doesn't matter as much as where they are at the END of his term.|`|khdFNlJ7aa	yea, and I imagine they would have more confidence in McCain and that bimbo Palin. McCain definately would bring us into a war that we could not afford to go to , if not 2 of them. NK and Iran|`|DiDCG9UBaa	Obama gave a speech today and so far the markets up over 100 points. Looks like he's a good thing now (according to that logic).|`|4SLjJvcqaa	Lets see<br>  <br>  The Stock Market had already gone off the edge of the Niagra Falls when Repuiblicans were calling the shots<br>  <br>  Somehow Obama is supposed to be able to "fix" 8 yrs of BAD G O P Policies in 7 weeks<br>  <br>  Funny<br>  Republicans waited for 30 yrs for their party to change Roe V Wade (and they still haven't)<br>  but<br>  think Obama can work miracles in 7 weeks<br>  <br>  <br>  Patience grasshoppers|`|oVmGcRVtaa	And when the unemployment numbers come out next week you will see even more negative fallout from the village idiots (mis) management of the past eight years.<br>  <br>  Have you thanked little georgie bush for the mess he left the country in?
74dfcb1be61ec91aea7144815438e380aa	we are only going to get out of this mess if we do what our grandparents did, find the necessary common ground that makes us all Americans and disregard the elements that try to divide us. all the money on the planet won't bail us out if we're not all rowing the same direction. They rallied around defeating the true axis of evil, Nazi Germany and Japan. That took priority over partisan politics. The question we have now is what will it take to get us out of this current divided mode and into one where we're all pulling the same way?|`|AA11424005	The stock market has already crashed.  Most indexes have lost more than 50% of their value.  That is the definition of a crash.<br>  <br>  Some will say the economy is already in the tank.  Almost 700,000 private sector jobs were lost in February.<br>  <br>  Anyone with discretionary assets is sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the bottom.|`|PCVJg5ieaa	Do you ever wonder what if Obama's stimulus does work and the market recovers.  Obama is golden for the first two years.  He's got until 2011 before he even has to start showing results.  <br>  <br>  In terms of being prepared: luckily we can spend, spend, spend until the cows come home.  If we have to have the government employ everyone on works projects, we have the bond rating to do so and would have to spend another 5-6 trillion before that even gets threatened.  So, they are prepared to fix the problem.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	Most economists were forecasting this to be a tough year regardless of a stimulus or not.  The stimulus is designed to soften the blow and also try to keep it from getting even worse...<br>  <br>  Of course I wonder what happens if it doesn't work, just like I wondered what would happen if they did nothing and it didn't work.<br>  <br>  I am prepared as much as feasibly possible|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	If you'd like to logically explain why you feel it won't work then fine.  If you'd like to explain a better plan...go ahead.  Other than that I'm not spending my time creating situations we're not in and possible solutions...there are too many possiblites.<br>  <br>  Our country needs to work on fixing what is broken and work on the situation we're in currently.  By fixing our problems we are working on being prepared for the future.  The government is working on preparing us for a difficult future by first trying to keep people in their homes, make education aforadable, dropping tax breaks for businesses overseas, and keeping credit avaliable so the market can progress.  Also, by focusing on renewable engery.<br>  <br>  That's my thoughts.|`|13KBWzBXaa	Obama is a Keynesian. He believes deficits are good and that government can go as deep into debt as it likes with no ill effects.<br>  <br>  There are some great lectures and speeches on things economic (Austrian School vs. Keynesian Socialism) on the Ludwig von Mises website, <a href="http://mises.org)" rel="nofollow">http://mises.org)</a><br>  (Direct link: <a href="http://mises.org/MultiMedia/mp3/)" rel="nofollow">http://mises.org/MultiMedia/mp3/)</a><br>  <br>  Edit: I wish you had email so I could ask you what your nic, "Water Over Gold" means!|`|ZWePAEZUaa	What goes around  goes back around.|`|b90f0a4c32cc3dde140d446b8bb1d11aaa	It won't work and the market is going down to 5,000, will recoup a little and then crash.  Spening money you don't have doesn't help the economy.  If they had let bad banks fail, insurance companies fail, then the market would have come back, slowly but it would have been legitimate, and then we would come out of this, but with Socialism on the march, we are doomed.|`|8SFoQvVLaa	Of course people wonder.  We also wondered what if we sit by and do nothing to stem the problems.  And?<br>  <br>  Most economists are advocating intervention rather than hands off.|`|AA11450062	I will tell you right now it will go down to 5000 before we start recovering from our Republican economics.|`|ProDw5xAaa	I'm not conviced it will work, but I will take a wait and see approach.|`|I9FOycm6aa	Oh, well. What can you do? At least we tried.|`|8EbJJ0zZaa	Sure...but I know that doing nothing wouldn't have worked either....so, what are we to do?|`|c3vPZfghaa	I already know it is going to crash anyway, so I don't bother wondering.<br>  The only thing that is going to prevent it from crashing is job creation of jobs that have to stay in the USA.<br>  The whole problem is the Republican free trade they wanted, and keep expanding to send jobs overseas.<br>  Most Americans are wondering if they'll have a job next week, or if the Chinese will have it.<br>  That doesn't usually do well for consumer confidence for people to think that way.<br>  <br>  You right-wingers got your Reaganomics and free trade, now quit crying about it, and quit trying to blame Democrats that took office in 2007 for it.<br>  <br>  Wait until you see what happens when all the jobs that can be done over the internet start moving to India, like has been the goal of the Bush admin for the past 8 years. Right-wingers claim that stuff creates jobs in America, but that isn't what will happen.<br>  <br>  but if Obama just sat on his hands and let it crash, you people would be bashing him for that to, after Republicans opposed it and talk-radio cherry picked data to convince their listeners why Obama is was wrong for not doing anything.<br>  <br>  The time to oppose bail-out is before you need them.<br>  You don't worry about putting on a parachute after you jump out of plane do you?|`|FATyhyZ2aa	Yes, I know that this is not under "Religion" category but it's all I have to base my answer on.  /  I too subscribe to the "Be Prepared."  /  I had seen a PBS documentary on how people survived 1920's stock market crash.  It seemed only those with a faith in God the Creator took it all in stride.  They didn't let newspaper reports tell them how to "feel" or how much "hope" they should have.  A lot said that it was a positive experience b/c they were actually forced to leave a bad work environment & were "inspired" to risk following that dream they had suppressed.  Each of them not only survived the crash, but actually built their fortunes b/c of the crash.  /  Same show asked flood survivors of Mississippi River, "What now?"  Young families who'd just move in for 1st crops were shattered & wailing.  Old timers said, "Well, you been here a lot then you know this sort of thing happens sometimes.  That's why you always leave a little something for yourself from the booming years."  They took it in stride!  /  So for me this means that I can choose how I will look at failure or success and not allow some newscaster to tell me that I'm heading for failure.  /  It's more prudent to listen to counsel from those older & wiser than these young newscasters looking for trauma ratings.|`|qC9pcfP5aa	Do you understand that the economy has already tanked? Our backs are against the wall and it's fight or flee. We choose to fight for our country and our economy.|`|6CU00J1Yaa	Well, since free market capitalism has failed miserably, Obama's stimulus plan is worth a shot. Hey, it worked in the thrities.|`|uAHutoJzaa	You don't call this a crash?
klj3cOFPaa	It's true Rush helped the Democratic cause.  He helps their cause every time he opens his mouth.<br>  <br>  But face it:  The Republicans invited Rush to speak on behalf of their party.  Rush is not an opposition party; he's just a prominent spokesman for the Republicans.  Even the Republicans agree--otherwise they wouldn't have invited him to speak!|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Why dont we all ignore the Rush Bashers?<br>  <br>  Its just bait to insult us with.|`|HZy629kLaa	No.  Just the leader of the opposition party.  Why can't any elected republican say anything against him without having to apologize in 24 hours?<br>  <br>  Sounds like the leader to me.|`|n2kBUWQOaa	Hi My Business Plan,<br>  <br>  The answer you gave on Yahoo! Answers was reported by the Answers community:<br>  <br>  "Rush is an entertainer. Why do you liberals insist that he is considered a god? Man, as soon as Obambaia started talking, you liberals raised him up and made him president. No vetting process, no Idea of what his political persuasion really is. You people believed him from day one. Well, Rush is definately a political powerhouse, he is also an honest, genuine human being. He has a better grasp on the political process, and is more knowledgeable of the operations of our government than Obambia could ever dream of. So, your question should not why are the GOP afraid of Rush, but rather Why doesn't the Democrats have a professional that is Rush's equal?|`|fSEiHz8Gaa	Whether you like it or not, he is a big influence on the conservative wing of the Republican party and many many conservatives look to him for leadership.
4Wgf6WZraa	probably nothing, that's why conservatives couldn't support him.|`|EPObVPzVaa	Sadly he would be doing more of the same but at least taking longer to do it.|`|AA11598520	We wouldn't be heading toward socialism. He tried to block the pork on the spending bills, but the Democrats naturally stopped him. Maybe he's true to his word.<br>  <br>  Democrats may not like what Obama is doing but they still won't go for the other guy. Amazing! No wonder we're in this mess.|`|X81oLqMtaa	He would be marching around in a circle in the Oval Office with his fingers in his ears and loudly shouting "the fundamentals of the economy are strong."|`|c3vPZfghaa	Expanding NAFTA to include Columbia to send many of our jobs to Columbia while claiming it was job creation.|`|6B1sxgtOaa	Cannot say!|`|261e200ff9afed850c06278f61c34b85aa	He would have cut taxes, instead of all the pork spending. When the rich are taxed, they don't sell their homes. They get the tax money from the business.  They pay their taxes in 3 ways. They make employees work harder for less. They make customers pay more for less. They make shareholders earn less on investments. Unlike the democrat party, Republicans don't get more voters, by creating more poor people.|`|5kK2f9Utaa	Well, he's not President so you shouldn't address his as "President McCain". I think if he WAS president we'd be in the same mess as before. We are still in a mess but right now its too early to see dramatic changes, it's barely been 2 months! <br>  <br>  I voted for Obama so I will back him up :)|`|Hb7TW09saa	probably nothing of any value since he had no clue about economics or the gravity of the situation.|`|AA11450062	Well he should of realized that if he attack Obama for new helicopters that he should look up who ordered them, Republicans.|`|eIZw7EXCaa	Not destroying the stock market and the life savings of millions of investors.|`|HZy629kLaa	There is no President McCain.|`|uAHutoJzaa	Who can say.

Ocyrox5baa	I think he wants to bring us to our knees in every sense to destroy our way of life and further his party's control.  The steps you mention are becoming obvious to those of us who aren't swept up by his charisma and eloquence.  <br>  <br>  As a sidenote, my oldest son considered joining the guard for a brief time.  He told me that although he doesn't see an end to this deep recession, he doesn't want to be on the government side if civil unrest occurs.  I can see his point.|`|LTNLIT98aa	he's a godddamn MONSTER who must be stopped--<br>  <br>    VOTE OUT CONGRESS AND HOUSE in 2010--then obama won't have any communists to back his HITLER-STYLE politics--his robbing me--his hijacking of my taxes--his corrupt Marxist crap--<br>  <br>  WE CAN STOP OBAMA--and his Mob Criminals in DC from stealing us blind!|`|AA10284358	Obama knows not how to fix a country only how to wreck one. and he's very good at what he knows.

Smart like a fox|`|ujIinLzGaa	Obama wants to be a dictator, but he will not succeed.  31 states are already considering secession or declarations of sovereignty, and 3 military commanders have already said that he is not fit to be commander in chief.  Obviously, public perception of his competence is plummeting.  He will probably have to resign soon, if he doesn't want to cost the democratic party what little respect he has left them.|`|xLm6tO7Zaa	Here's an honest answer to your question.<br>  <br>  Most people like yourself, want civil unrest anyway. You were to afraid to do it when the village idiot was president because that would come across as not being patriotic but now that there is a black democrat in the white house, you can claim he's a socialist and use that excuse to move towards civil unrest.|`|wqchA8B7aa	You had the largest removal of rights in history under the Bush Regime - The patriot act.

But maybe they will be going out to FOBS alot or attacking drug issues...|`|n2oEhdZiaa	It's not common, but there are Airborne and Air Assault MP units (just like any other support unit) and there is certainly a need for people to be familiar with basic helicopter ops because of the terrain in Afghanistan.
esOaJoqBaa	No. Recon's typical mission does not invole roaming around in any sort of mechanized vehicle. While they may do that in the current wars, that is not their primary purpose. Recon is designed to quietly reach behind enemy lines and gather information while not being seen or heard. It is hard to do that while riding in a Stryker. Their missions are best accomplished by parachuting or any waterborne clandestine entry.<br>  <br>  Cav. Scouts are designed to be the forward element of a large force. Recon is the silent ears and eyes of larger element, but may be nowhere near the friendly lines.|`|ZB1vk86Maa	Recon Marines are not anything like Cav Scouts. They are more along the lines of Rangers. Recon is not considered a SOF but they damn sure could be if the Corps wanted it that way. The Basic Recon Course is not easy at all. They also get all the high speed schools. (Jump, Dive, HALO). Sorry to break your heart but if you wanna be high speed you have to put in the work to get there.|`|tcA1w24jaa	Depends, there are 2 kinds of Marine Recon remember, there is "Regular" green Marine Recon, who are more akin to rangers, etc, and often show up as part of a larger fighting force. Then there is black Force-Recon, who are more along the lines of the SEALs and Delta.<br>  <br>  So you're right and wrong in part.|`|MfZU1UpFaa	Recon is....Special Forces(I hate using that term, its an Army term) the next level is MARSOC...its the most elite, better than SEALs, but i still have a lot of respect for SEALs|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Yeah, Recon is like Army Cav Scouts, Rangers, SEALs.. all those guys basically do similar jobs. They all think they're better of course, but really they can do each other's jobs if need be.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Don't forget that if they are heavy (armored) they are in Bradley's too.<br>  <br>  I don't know the answer to your question, I would guess they would be similar, but I really have no idea.|`|AA11885685	Short answer is yes.  Since they are both used as recon.  However, knowing marines/army of both types i would say a marine would think they are better but i believe the training is equal.
8RflQ9DVaa	Well said Zodiac. And to answer your question... I've never identified myself based on my political registration (Democrat), I've always voted based on issues. But I have learned much this past year and am leaving the party, if only to make a statement. I would NEVER consider the Republican party, but I need to find out more about the alternatives before deciding on one.|`|Dh8i9msPaa	This past election I voted for a 3rd party candidate, since I felt they were capable. <br>  I won't vote for 3rd party, just to vote for it. <br>  <br>  But I get what you are saying.|`|CNSGz12zaa	I already did that years ago.|`|6B1sxgtOaa	Already have, Independent.

But I'm not quite ready to throw him under the bus like so many. I would never vote republican as that would be going against all I believe in. So yes if the democratic party does not follow through this time around independent voting next time around could very well be.|`|Hb7TW09saa	I already did after this past election based on how the party handled themselves and basically by propping up Palin, which blew my mind. I'm an independent now..just got my new license at the DMV 2 weeks ago and changed my party.|`|U50orfPhaa	Watch this and people will RUN to the republican party!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Obama went to this MARCH with these leaders!

AA10389562	Some Republicans have momentary lapses in which they regain their intelligence.  Unfortunately, these lapses do not last long and they quickly regress back to the brainlessness of bowing to mouthpiece of the fanatical base.<br>  <br>  As a Republican for 35 years, I am depressed as I watch the GOP sink ever lower as we actually take the words of a comedic entertainer seriously.  Words that are spoken for the sole purpose of increasing broadcast ratings and thus Boss Limbaugh's income.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Rush is just another guy.<br>  <br>  Conservatives are NOT the kind of people who idolize celebrities.  It's not part of our culture.|`|BIQrsl4paa	Once again, you have confused Conservative with Republican.<br>  Rush has stated, more than once, that he is a Conservative and not a Republican.<br>  He will, to the best of his ability, help Conservatives get elected and if they also happen to be Republicans, that's ok too.<br>  <br>  By the way, I like your link. It's just too bad that the Liberals have to stoop so low to make themselves feel superior.|`|c3vPZfghaa	Rush is like a large cult leader.<br>  If they criticize him he can motivate 14 million people to vote against them.<br>  Not that it would make much of a difference on a national scale, but it would really hurt someone in a party vote.<br>  Rush will be the end of the GOP. All his followers think he cares so much about country, God and morals, when in reality he cares about Rush.<br>  Nothing else.<br>  Rush wil either have to hang it up, or help the GOP suicide itself.|`|Hxttt7G0aa	This whole thing was set up to cause a rift with republicans, and create a diversion from the crappy way the Obama administration is doing business. Notice? No more talk about all the criminal tax cheats, lobbyists, and other riff raff Obama is putting in his cabinet? In the foreign policy screw ups Obama is committing? <br>  <br>  In the fact that the Iranians who democrats swore wouldn't have nuke capability for 10 years, have it NOW.<br>  <br>  Imagine if Bush had been such a stinking screw up? They would have had red meat for decades on that, in stead of the twisted lies they have to try to pass off now.|`|9klx10iKaa	Democrats gotta have some one to attack, Bush is gone so they are looking for the next best one.<br>  <br>  Obama is destroying this country, wake up and stop playing these petty little school yard games.|`|VtXvmOIXaa	Because there are few original thoughts in the republican party anymore and Rush is the loudest voice.<br>  <br>  Look at the way tblbaby has twisted the fact of Iran having nucular capibility.Ignoring the fact Obama has only been in office for less then 2 months.Which realisitically means they got that capability while Bush was president.So now she's blaming it on Obama.|`|jVUEohsNaa	I must admit, Rush articulates my thoughts exactly...|`|de0fc1da097f66a349eb15de28f1834faa	First of all Michael Steele is the leader of the republican party.<br>  <br>  Rush is the leader of the conservative movement within the Republican party.<br>  <br>  RNC chairs come and go, Rush has had the same job for 20 years.|`|35b8ac78ca5c09c7481fe35c062bdfa0aa	it amazes me that people claim that Rush is the leader of the republican party.

There are a lot of Democrats who criticize Obama's decision to extend the US force in Iraq beyond 16 months and increase the numbers of US troops in Afghanistan, yet also support him on other issues.|`|98EXXItdaa	You know what would be nice?  If liberals actually were capable of thinking for themselves long enough to be willing to be critical of their leadership for a change.<br>  <br>  This mindless acceptance of the reckless spending coming out of Washington right now really doesn't say good things about your kind.|`|39KUKALFaa	This is dream world stuff.  Rush is a commentator.  Steele is right - Rush is an entertainer.<br>  <br>  Is Warren Beatty - an actor - more talented that the rest of the Dems?  Maybe.<br>  <br>  The way Steele said it was wrong, but his point was right.<br>  <br>  Rush would not want to be leader of the Republican Party.

Same with Iraq, if Saddam had just been assissnated, someone else from his party would have taken over and done the same things. The invasion was to get rid of the whole government and change the whole political setup of the country. You can't do that with assasination.
mFa5ZDtcaa	Unfortunately, I don't think Democrats are any where near the end of their spending orgy. I expect another 2 trillion at least in additional spending before the summer is out.<br>  <br>  Obama's entire deficit reduction package is based solely on the economy recovering in a year.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't, the country will be bankrupt.<br>  <br>  Right now (9:30 am Eastern) CNN radio news just reported the "economy is crashing right on schedule".

The problem is so bad, though that I liken it to the Roman Empire.  Every great Democracy has crumbled from within.

Y5S2dDkYaa	Heres a short answer to your series of questions<br>  <br>  1) Most politicians are loyal to their party first and their country second.<br>  <br>  2) Dissent can easily be written off as stubborn partisanship or unpatriotic radicalism.<br>  <br>  3) Ideally legislators defend the constitution - realistically they defend their constituency.<br>  <br>  The way Democrats are trying to coax republicans into going along complacently with their current agenda is sooooo much like the republicans coerced dems three years ago into supporting theirs  - all in the name of our countries best interest - But BEST INTEREST IS A POINT OF VIEW.|`|6B1sxgtOaa	What is patriotism?  I define it based on how it measures up to the Constitution. Is what is going on Constitutional? If it isn't then it is not Patriotic and needs to be stopped no matter what it is.  People need to think for themself and quit depending on Washington and the media to define the terms for them. THINK!|`|v0PY0UDAaa	You hear crickets because its true.  Both parties are corrupt to the bone.  All the accusations thrown back and forth are grandstanding for the most part.  There are quite a few pots calling quite a few kettles black in Washington.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	You are fundamentally wrong.<br>  Democrats indeed define patriotism that way.<br>  Most Republicans declare patriots can disagree as long as they support America.<br>  "This same squawking" was never labeled unpatriotic when the Democrats did it. Their overt support for hostile foreign powers was. We always recognized "minority dissent" as dissent. It isn't the same thing.<br>  <br>  I also define patriotism based on how it measures up to the Constitution. That isn't being "literalist," it's being American. A large portion of the GOP and 100% of the Democrat caucus FAILS this test.<br>  <br>  -Bush was indeed a Constitutional transgressor, but I'll wager NOT for reasons you have in mind.<br>  -Obama is even worse. I honestly cannot think of even a single Obama program idea that is not an unlawful usurpation.<br>  -FDR never had a moment's reluctance. He fought vigorously against The Constitution right out of the chute.<br>  -Lincoln was the only President (so afar) preferring to wage war against Americans rather than keep Constitutional fidelity.<br>  <br>  The Constitution has flexibility built-in. It is NOT flexible about circumventing that mechanism nor should it be - ever.|`|lwccQoEZaa	Yep.|`|EhoJ9mgsaa	Our govt. has been rocking a fascist fashion for about 7 years now.|`|8EbJJ0zZaa	It's called politics.
cruEHRJ7aa	Obama has always been a free trade advocate, no matter what he said during the campaign. Democrats aren't for protectionism anymore than Republicans are. They know that if they tried to start an American-only commercial policy, then they'd lose billions upon billions in foreign revenue. We have customers in almost every country in the world. No politician is seriously going to say "Let's give up all those customers and hope that all Americans are willing to buy only American-made products for the rest of their lives."|`|XrU1I1wjaa	You want manufacturing jobs? Guess what? You ain't getting it. Americans love their 40 dollar DVD players from China. How low do you think American wages have to go before these jobs come back? The answer: more than you can bear.<br>  <br>  As far as Gaza (not the West Bank). The deal is this: you pay Israel a lot to destroy it. And you pay Hamas goons a little to rebuilt it, so Israel can do it all over again later.|`|EhoJ9mgsaa	NAFTA is a precursor to NAU (North American Union......described as a "borderless community")<br>  <br>  That's also the reason why no one ever closed the border.<br>  <br>  Your new AMEROcan masters can't wait to unveil their plans.......|`|AA11598520	Because he flip flops or, in the case of campaign promises, out and out lies all the time. This should be no surprise.|`|25faf33e24f40cd4a39b1314c62123a4aa	Obama is taking this country places we don't want to go. Just one big mistake after another.|`|HcFHLGIaaa	He's a Panda...<br>  Ya know, <br>  Eats, shoots and leaves.|`|3caq6SFxaa	The same reason he is not using his pen to cut out wasteful spending in the ills he signs-the President does not have line item veto and to unilaterally breaks treaties is not politically good to do and even the legality of that would be very questionable.  Treaties are made by the State Department and represent the word of this country, it is then ratified (approved) by the Senate and the President signs it or vetoes it.  Once signed it is basically a written promise of the government and a law we must live by or we retract the treaty and start negotiating again but that really takes all parties being willing.  He promised those two things throughout his campaign and knew he did not have the power to do either but many people do not look or research but do things on blind faith and that was very evident the last election cycle.  No Gaza refugees are supposedly being brought to the US but we are providing $900 million to rebuild Gaza.|`|n2kBUWQOaa	Once the Cap and Trade gets through, manufacturing that still remains in the U.S. will be gone forever. The cost to do business will be too high. go fill out an application at McDonalds, because those will be the only manufacturing type jobs available (building the better burger).|`|Cmd0legkaa	He also flip flop on the "no lobbyists" in his white house. Then their was "the most transparent government" ever, then the "no pork" thing. Then days after spending more money than any president in history, he says he will reduce the deficit by half. I would say it is par for the course.|`|BQY8b2YOaa	Obama is a politician who said what he needed to say in order to be elected.

I STRONGLY agree with absolutely everything else. The only reason I agree with abortions are because I'm more of a realist. I realize that typically when a child is aborted the mother of the child would most likely be a bad mother. I mean, she doesn't want the kid in the first place. So, why even bring it into the world. I don't look at it as killing a baby. I look at it as killing a future rapists or murderer. I know that it's probably more like, 30/70 that it will be one of those but still. What's funny is that even though I'm on the liberal side most libs would be angry at WHY I view it this way which usually makes my conservative friends ok with my choice on that issue. Funny how the world works aint it?|`|98EXXItdaa	No, I don't always support my party.  A few examples..<br>  <br>  I think Republican leadership has been too interested in cutting taxes, without following through on the need to cut government spending.  The two need to go together. <br>  <br>  I think the Republican party has become to beholden to the extreme, religious right.<br>  <br>  I think the Republican party has taken some insane stances on gun control.|`|cdfaf090d61b4780b0e9991dfb477d46aa	Im not a member of nor do I support any parties. Ideology is all that matters.  Political parties are just a big sponge to soak up a bunch of money so they can fund elaborate campaigns to tell people what they think people want to hear.  <br>  Its all about the individual candidate and what they are saying and doing. Its an ideological perspective for me. Thats how I vote.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	I am very upset at the GOP right now because of their unwillingness to provide a dissenting voice that defends basic conservative values of fiscal responsibility (we need massive budget cuts to end the crisis of too much government, the real cause of the recession) and national security (like standing up to the crazed racists in Iran before they get nukes).|`|0wiaAdJiaa	I consider myself a Democrat but I do not always agree with the policies that the have.

Why, because  the bible thumpers left the Democrat party and became Republicans.<br>  <br>  <br>  Add:  I agree with 'Sociald"  Too bad so many on Y/A don't know the difference in a political party and an ideology.   One person answered the question using ideologies, conservative and liberal, instead of political parties.|`|V44ARW4maa	actually, you are asking a very good question and you ought to get some good responses--one would hope, anyway. While there are, as you say, some who always blindly agree with their party, most moderates and independents support the issue first over party stance/position. And when one throws out those hardcore leftists--maybe twenty-five percent, then throws out the twenty-five percent right wingers, it's that middle 50% that push a particular issue one way or the other. It seems in here, there are only the hardcore left and hardcore right, not too many thoughtful, wise, intelligent (not to mention good looking) moderates/independents. Well, except for you and me, that is...|`|Vh9CbtLUaa	Not at all.<br>  First of all, I'm a conservative on most things. There is no Conservative party where I live so I had to make a choice. My over all beliefs coincide more with Republicans than with Democrats, therefore I registered Republican.<br>  Republican brand does not mean you "must" follow, it presents like minded people for you to check out.<br>  I'm in favor of an English only Amendment. I think we spend too much money on translations and translators that could be put to better use.<br>  I think you need to be born here legally to acquire citizenship.<br>  I am against welfare payments for able bodied males.<br>  I am against welfare for able bodied females.<br>  I don't think states should encourage single mothers with support.<br>  I think Affirmative Action is unnecessary and should be abolished.<br>  We need less government in our lives, not more.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	There have been a lot of things Republicans had a problem with what their elected officials did. One reason why we let them get thrown out of Congress. <br>  <br>  Here in NC we let Elizabeth Dole get tossed after one term. Pretty rare for a Senator. Reason? We didn't like her "No See'um" service and high spending habits.<br>  <br>  Funny, her successor Kaye Hagen (D) campaigned against her and blasted her for her voting for increased spending. <br>  <br>  Kaye has voted for every spending bill so far.<br>  <br>  Congressional Democrats went into this last election with the lowest approval rating in history. Democrats not only re-elected them, but increased their power.<br>  <br>  Who appears to hold their candidates responsible?|`|8rGZFBKOaa	No, because I have a rational, thinking brain of my own.
hbOFDysJaa	I completely and totally agree with you and I forget what the percentage is, but the wealthiest 1% pay WAY MORE than 40% of the taxes in this country...it's like 50% or 60%.  And the idea, PJ, that they pay 2% of their income while the average citien pays 27% is ludicrous.  Okay, they have write-offs.  So do most people.  It doesn't knock them down to paying 2% of their gross income in taxes.  They STILL pay a LOT more than YOU do!!!  A lot more money AND a higher percentage!  <br>  <br>  It's not fair that people are punished for their success.  Why don't we get the 40 million employees in America that don't pay taxes to pay.  Let's start with Obama's friends.  He seems to know a lot of people that don't pay taxes.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Rich people are a nuisance to our government. They pay the majority of the taxes in this country. They pay their own way without relying on the government for anything.

People are rewarded for hard work, determination, and good life decisions. I've worked since I was 15 years old under a parent consent letter. Since then, I've served the military honorably, started my education and plan to be in the 250,000 range within 4 to 5 years from now. I couldn't have done all this if I were comfortable sitting in my trailer smoking weed all day with an income. It was the fact that I wasn't given everything that made me strive for more, the American dream still exist in the heart of conservatives. If someone can't cut it in this society, I say, let them starve. I grew up in a dilapidated trailer in the south. No running water and barely any electricity. No cable or internet. Fleas and ticks, mattress on the ground covered in mold. You name it. Now, I'd say I'm doing pretty good. Own my own home, veteran status, great job, paid for schooling, and a 2007,    35,000 vehicle paid for. I guess I wasn't GIVEN enough to prosper.

He appealed to able-bodied people who are too lazy to work hard and typically don't earn enough to pay taxes, and, are too uninformed to save or invest any money they do earn.<br>  <br>  Those people drain society, they don't contribute to its success.<br>  <br>  The rest of the hard-working middle class was likely fooled by Obama's crafty eloquence and charm and they wanted to give the newby a chance. <br>  <br>  That won't last long.  The hard working, tax paying middle class, of all income levels, is the backbone of the nation.  IMO, the middle classes of all economic levels, will see through Obama soon enough.

The illegal population has no moral, or legal right to be here by any stretch of the Imagination I don't care how you cut it. The only peaceful solution is for the illegals to go home to their country of origin, and fight for their rights there, instead of jerking off our system that was designed for the benefit of our citizens, and legal immigrants.

PCVJg5ieaa	You and another citizen applicant stand with backs to each other then walk ten paces and turn and shoot.  Whichever one lives gets citizenship.<br>  <br>  You mean "Dual Citizenship" which works pretty standardly in the United States so long as you do not serve in the armed forces of another country (although some allowances for Israeli citizens).  It is a simple form to fill out--although for marrying it is slightly more difficult and long of a process because you must qualify for citizenship in both countries first: which may take years and significant bureaucratic jumping.  The kids will be easy and just filling out the necessary paperwork after birth is simple.  But she needs to consider what exact benefits are given to her from 'Dual Citizenship'.  I suspect there are no real benefits (at least no one that I know has seen any) and that it will be a lengthy hastle with out a positive result.|`|CM3Fl3WRaa	Not that simple. You must qualify for citizenship in the other country. <br>  For example: For the Canadian spouse to become a US citizen they have to become a conditional resident for 2 years followed by a permanent resident for 1 year and then apply for citizenship. They have to live in the US. <br>  The Canadian government has similar laws to become a Canadian citizen. <br>  Since you can not live in two countries at the same time AND you have to live with the spouse it is going to prove difficult. It can be done by living in one country until that spouse gets citizenship and them moving to the other country to get citizenship.<br>  The children on the other hand will be able to get both citizenships by filing the proper paperwork.<br>  There is no paperwork for dual citizenship. If you have one citizenship and you acquire another you are a dual citizen.|`|eYgR2SNlaa	Dual citizen is on a bi-lateral bases, USA needs to have a treaty signed with the respective country where its all spelled out<br>  <br>  just go here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_citizenship" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_citize...</a>|`|TQW5E6olaa	It means you're a citizen of both countries, you get two passports and a citizen's rights in each country. In some cases, you have to go and live in the other country first to get it.<br>  <br>  I have a an application in to have dual citizenship in Chile, Bella too, we just have to go live there for a year.

We need to cultivate businesses with low regulation, and low taxes. This also applies to our aristocracy. They are leaving the country in an alarming rate to flee our crippling tax system.<br>  <br>  We also need to cut government spending to the bone. Defense and foreign relations and that's about it. <br>  Trade does not even need to be regulated. Let the free marktet handle it. It can not be wrong.<br>  <br>  Everything else can be handled at the state or private level, such as welfare and education.|`|VOccyg7daa	You do realize it is those very people that create the jobs that Obama keeps talking about, don't you. What good is going to happen from raising their taxes, they just cut more of the labor force. I can't believe any American would be in favor of a tax rate in excess of 70%. That's 70 cents out of every dollar going to the government and that's just the federal government, then they have to pay taxes on the state and local level too. How much is enough for you people? Personally, if I were making that much I wouldn't want to feel like all I was doing was paying for my federal government. You are ridiculous and your plan will lead to higher unemployment. People and companies will start to move out of the US at an even higher rate just to avoid the taxes and I can't say as I blame them. You are going to tax our country into third world status.|`|i5MiFhMyaa	Well now you have a brand new government. Don't you know that Liberals believe in big spending, big government, and big taxes. Mind you Bush grew the government too, and also, along with Pelosi, Obama, and McCain pushed through this awful $750 billion TARP bailout (i.e. gift) to the Wall Street banks and their greedy executives.<br>  <br>  So yes, much higher taxes are coming for all.

Because that revenue source is simply going to pick up and move someplace where people don't view them as the enemy.|`|cr5EoqVjaa	Your question is confusing as you seem to take multiple positions on many issues. In addressing the basis of your initial question, it has been proven and Obama has acknowledged that lowering tax rates, especially the capital gains tax, INCREASES the amount of revenue coming into the govt. <br>  <br>  That is why we conservatives are in favor of tax cuts.|`|oOUmH0Uyaa	It's not that we can't sustain tax cuts... it's that we can't sustain expansion and wasteful spending of the government.<br>  <br>  Who will repealling these tax cuts impact? The rich right??? Good! Soak it to those greedy loads! Right??<br>  <br>  Let me ask you this: Who provides the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of jobs in this country? - This very group that you want to punish, who by the way, already bears over 50% of the tax burden in the US. Have you ever been employed by a poor person? Remember, these people who provide jobs and the goods that we need, want, and desire run the market - NOT the government. - Why? Look at our public school systems and social security and medicare and everything else the government touches. THAT'S WHY.<br>  <br>  There is hope for industry though! Right now, China, Mexico, and about a dozen other countries are providing tax incentives for companies to relocate. When these companies do, the US loses jobs AND taxes... This "spreading the wealth" thing will turn into "spread the tax burden". One day the government will not be able to afford to let the botton 40% of the population not pay taxes, like it is now. Oh, and what about jobs? - Looks like more welfare!<br>  <br>  Why don't you pick on your boy Obama?... He signed the single largest spending bill in the history of the world two weeks ago. Now, he's proposing the largest budget we have ever had in this country that includes a $1.75 TRILLION deficite. Also, he plans to unveil over $1 TRILLION in NEW healthcare spending over the next few years. <br>  <br>  Now tell me honestly; How much will we have to raise taxes on 4% of the population to make up for all of this massive spending AND try to pay down the debt we owe?????????????|`|fsEr4x6oaa	I find it funny that the misuse of credit is what is being blamed for all of these problems. Yet, the new gov. is doing it more than ever. People seem to think that spending and bailing out these companies is the answer and I find that foolish. If you keep helping a fool, than who is the fool? Tax cuts put more money in the pocket of the masses, and they spend more. That is the engine that runs the economy. Regardless of what Obama and the others think, there are 300 million of us and only a few thousand of them. We are the ones that run this economy. Did you ever stop to think that when gas went to 4 dollars a gallon, people stopped spending, could no longer afford the extras, our economy started to fall? When they make it where we can't spend, we won't. More taxes will do the same...

He is, by his own admission, a businessman who cashes in by pandering to conservative values.|`|oOUmH0Uyaa	Yes.. to some extent. Actually this is a PERFECT representation of how the free market works. Rush's success depends EXCLUSIVELY on the demand the public has to hear him. Simply put, if no one wanted to listen to him, radio stations that make money in advertising during his program would begin to carry comeone else. MILLIONS of people listen to him because they want to hear what he is saying.<br>  <br>  Contrast this to the failed liberal talk base - Air America. NO ONE wanted to listen to those guys. Consequently, ratings failed and sponsors left in droves.<br>  <br>  Funny, because this is why liberals in Congress want to reinstate the "Fairness Doctrine". This would require radio stations to provide equal time to conflicting political viewpoints... In essence, it would FORCE private radio stations to air programs that people do not want to hear. This will cause the radio stations to lose money and then most would simply decide to not carry either conservative or liberal talk radio... thus satisfying a political desire that liberals have to silence the voice of opposition.<br>  <br>  Notice how the Fairness Doctrine doesn't apply to television or printed media. Both of those industries by the way, are predominantly owned and managed by liberal-oriented people and organizations.|`|Ar7swtCPaa	He is not the boss of the Republican party at least not in my eyes, he is very vocal and that makes the libs detest him.

I also can't see how a democrat can call him "stupid". Take for instance, Obama, saying he wants to bring "jobs to America", but then turns right around and contradicts himself saying that "globalization is the answer". Not only that, Obama swore against ridiculous spending. Enough said. Rush is right, Obama is not our Messiah, he's more of our...adversary really. Obama is against all American ideals, such as an armed civilian force, small government, equal power between state and federal. I don't know man, hopefully Rush opens some eyes and these Dem.'s might take a lesson, because they view him as some name calling crook, but really need to see him as an inspiring leader who actually has proved plans.|`|AA10079277	He is jnot the leader, so the question does not make sense.<br>  <br>  His audience is only about 1/3 of the people that voted for McCain, and of all republicans, it is even less.

He has grave doubts about public education, public health programs, and the United Nations.  There is an element of fear of the new and untried that permeates his diatribe.  In short, the perfect Republican candidate for any political office. In the 19th century he would have been a member in good standing of the Know Nothing Party.|`|KIL9HrRhaa	Facts are substantiated where possible, otherwise what follows is my opinion:<br>  <br>  Rush Limbaugh is the epitome of what's wrong with the US today (greed-driven, cigar smoking, FAT rich white guys). Rush is horrible, horrible example of a conservative by the definition of the word itself and I would venture to say (based on what we can infer) a narcissistic  miserable human being. The details of his personal life that have been made public let us know he does not seem to cherish the conservative values; multiple failed marriages, drug addiction and the only god he seems to worship is himself.  People make mistakes, but good, morale people are just a bit more humble and remorseful about them. With Rush, there is not humble bone in this mans body. You could almost say he is like a false prophet for the GOP; mask off, he actually does represent the current GOP party... and that's the problem.<br>  <br>  What he is really good at is providing entertainment through political talk radio and making boat loads of money for himself doing so. When a democrats is in office his skills (as an entertainer) become much more profitable... Someone with his wealth has no doubt lost a great deal from investments as the stock market continues to fall, so he's doing what he does best... He's marketing himself and his entertainment product... Do not for one second think Rush is going to save the GOP or that he has ANY intention of assuming a political role. When he's gotten himself in a corner in the past (some years ago) he always retreats to the "I'm just an entertainer" line and has said multiple times he has no interest it entering politics (see paragraph 1 for why).<br>  <br>  The GOP is in real trouble because, well because THEY THANKED THE COUNTRY under the previous administration. Much like the rich, self-obsorbed auto industy CEOs that arrived in Washignton in their private jets to request bail out money, the GOP doesn't 'Get it'. As a party they failed the US citizens and for them there is no bail-out of sympathy. As a party the GOP is bankrupt and they brought it all upon themselves... How long it takes their outspoken pundit's to acknowledge that is anyone's guess. It has made watching the news more entertaining these days as they try to claw their way out of the hole they are in; refusing to accept their fate and the death of their ideas they are using right-wing talk radio in the southern states to appeal to the "bubba laws" Don't touch bubba's guns, don't tax his cigarette's or booze, try to scare bubba into thinking Democrates are going to destroy his right to become a multi-millionaire someday (their agenda has been to brainwash blue collar workers, but to the blue collar workers are much brighter than the republican party gives them credit for)<br>  <br>  To be clear: I believe Capitalism is the absolute best system when appropriate checks and balances (regulations) are in place. Because I want those regulations does not make me a Socialist, I'm an independant, but I have many friends who are democrats and they view this the same way.<br>  <br>  Obama just landed in Washington and he walked into a flood knee deep and rising... But the GOP will continue to their spew rhetoric warning us of looming Socialism, which is all grossly over-exaggerated. I listen to conservative talk radio and it's fear mongering at it's worst. So much opinion is stated as fact... There is much more hypocrisy in the GOP camp these days.|`|K71Qoakwaa	With lies, distortions,  and character attacks that work only on simple-minded haters.

(In so many ways, though not perfect, those were grand and heady times in which to live.  Nothing was unobtainable or impossible.)  Anything in a stage of growth is in its best stage of life.  Too much prosperity, however, like someone dangerously obese due to having too much money for food, if not controlled for moderation, leads to fast living.  Fast living, figuratively speaking, brings about a quicker dotage and demise.  <br>  <br>  Demise, or death, is the first and necessary means for positive change (which the 'death card' in the tarot signifies) to a better state of existence.  Change is constantly in effect and must be if existence is to continue.  A lack of change is nothing more than death in slow motion.  Hence, "the best is [or can be] yet to come"  Only if we don't allow it to be screwed up, however.<br>  <br>  The system is presently in a state of change or dissolution (flux.)  Hence, the state of flux in which all seems to be in a state of madness.  The eternal sequence, if survival is to continue is: solution, DISsolution, REsolution, and solution once again.|`|tLBjsrEFaa	Kennedy was not that Great, if he was never assassinated he would not be remembered as great|`|PXV0rXsCaa	most of those people are dead by now. aging kills.

What you do is fit every vehicle with a transponder. You then fit a transponder in the roadway at intersections. When the vehicle passes one, its transponder triggers the roadway unit which in turn sends a cost signal back to the vehicle. No location data, no "big brother" data, simply "here's the cost to pass me".

No tax on vehicles under say 30K.<br>  <br>  No corporate taxes at all, you should realize the consumer pays all corporate taxes anyway.<br>  <br>  USE taxes only, and tax heavily.

This time was simply more flagrant. The biggest problems aren't even being talked about, including 1) bankers refusing to loan each other money because they all know the crap they are hiding on their books - so why should we loan them ours in savings, etc., and 2) the loss of confidence around the world in the ability of the US to protect political or economic interests - this is not going away unless Obama can do more.

AA11312653	Some people find themselves in financial difficulties through feckless overspending. And some are in financial difficulties because their paycheck barely covers little luxuries like food, shelter, and transportation. I agree that it is foolish to forego health insurance for the sake of having money to take an expensive vacation or drive a luxury car. But if you are suggesting that there are no working people who are simply unable to afford that weekly expense, you are incorrect. <br>  <br>  Do not forget that there are a goodly number of people who have the insurance and still put off using their benefit because they can ill afford the copays and deductable.|`|SS1VReF0aa	You are making an assumption, one clearly not based on any facts (or you would have presented them)<br>  <br>  The truth is, yes there are people that do not have health care and could if they wanted to...but there are also people that are doing everything possible to get off the ground and just can't find affordable health care. I'm not sure what percentage fall into each category...because that would require extensive research I really don't care to do.|`|SSLekPAnaa	Very good points. Many of the people on Y!A claim health care is too expensive, and yet they have the money for broadband internet. Priorities people!

Many employers do not offer health insurance.  And getting quality coverage at a reasonable price is difficult.<br>  <br>  When I started my own business, it was very difficult to find affordable insurance for my family that actually covered our real needs.  My son had asthma when he was very young, so NONE of the insurance companies would cover him for asthma issues.  Even if he gets a common cold, the insurance companies say it is asthma related and won't pay for it. <br>  <br>  So we have health insurance that basically covers us for extreme medical emergencies, but not for basic doctor visit for my son.  And this doesn't even include the cost of medicine.<br>  <br>  You can sit where you are and criticize, but we have a real problem with the cost of health care, and as more and more people lose their jobs, and health insurance,  in this economy, the problem will only become worse.<br>  <br>  You need a dose of reality.|`|OoHN2qjDaa	The thing about health care in the states is that even if you have it - it might not due you one lick of good if you fall unexpectedly ill one day.<br>  <br>  For example, a friend of mine just had a premature birth due to preeclampsia (the baby is fine if you were wondering). However, her and her husband's insurance company is going to great lengths to deny them any coverage for her sudden medical expenses, even though preeclampsia is a fairly common condition in pregnancies and occurs without any prior warning. <br>  <br>  So, take that how you will.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	the fundamental reason health insurance is "so high" is that you are asking it to pay for things that aren't random future events.<br>  <br>  other insurance is about random future events, not about statistical certainty or paying for bad past choices.<br>  <br>  health insurance should be too.|`|39KUKALFaa	You are right, but the real reason that they want socialized medicine is so that particular groups like gays can get more than their fair share of the money.<br>  <br>  At the moment, the Dems have killed health insurance by mandated coverage for their politically powerful friends and banning interstate competition.<br>  <br>  McCain (a deadhead) was right that there should be competition in interstate insurance markets.  If that had happened then health insurance would be cheap.|`|8SFoQvVLaa	Some, sure.  However given that the average family coverage is about 12,000/year...I'm sure many really can't afford the coverage.<br>  <br>  I think you are confused about who is without healthcare.

I'm sure that there are those, but the problem is that many employers do not offer medical insurance to their employees, particularly if they are part time. And to buy medical insurance on your own is extraordinarily expensive. I'm self employed and I can afford to buy medical insurance for my family. It costs me $1,800 a month. Yes, that's a month. And it continues to rise. Now, I can afford it, but I have a feeling that most folks could not. That's an awful lot of cell phones. <br>  <br>  That is NOT to say, however, that I believe that government should be stepping in to pay this for me. In fact, my wife and I were discussing it the other night. I am determined to make sure that you, my neighbors and others do not spend a dime on my maintenance and up keep. *I* am MY responsibility. <br>  <br>  But as I mentioned, most folks can't afford this. But what is the government's role? I do not believe it is to pay for it. But perhaps they could take measures to decrease the COST of medical insurance and medical care. You see, that's something Obama has yet to talk about. They're all about paying for it and no one is looking at the cost. It used to be that folks could afford medical care in this country. They could afford medical insurance. We can't any more. Why is that? Malpractice suits? Multi-billion dollar law suits against drug companies? I don't know. But the COST is the answer, not 'who will pay'. You take care of the cost and payment is not an issue.

WhUV9k6Jaa	There are two main consequences of not engaging in free trade.<br>  <br>  1 - The reaction of our trade partners.  For all our blessings, this country does need resources from other countries.  Whether its petroleum from the Middle East, uranium from the Balkans, or coffee from Columbia, we don't have or produce all the things we need.  By not engaging in open and free trade we risk a negative reaction by the countries who export these necessities to us in terms of pricing.<br>  <br>  2 - Competition keeps you sharp.  Whether it's developing new technologies or determining fair wages in the labor market, to stay on top a country must out perform other countries.  By not engaging in free trade we're essentially coddling ourself and this will breed inefficienies that will slow the economy's growth rate.<br>  <br>  China and Japan learned over a century ago that sealing your borders from free trade slows progress.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	The ONLY problem with Free Trade is that a unionized workforce will make you less competitive in antique labor pools.<br>  <br>  As long as your industrial sector stays on the forefront and does not rely on old industries you can easily avoid job losses in a Free Market. The problem with the US markets is that our education system is so pathetic (because they focus on liberal indoctrination and job protection over actual education) that we consistently rely on old industries (which are also plagued by a unionized workforce) in which we cannot compete.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	re-read Adam Smith.  the key part is the huge returns he depicts in the pin factory from specializing labor.  Productivity per labor hour literally soared -- this allows prices to fall for all consumers while the now specialized labor commands a higher wage.<br>  <br>  In Malcolm Gladwells' current book [Outliers], you'll find a wonderful discussion of the 10,000 hours practice rule.  It takes about 10,000 hours of practice with corrective feedback for any human to wrap their mind around the methods by which outstanding results can be produced with comparative ease.<br>  <br>  This 10,000 hours is what makes the productivity gains that Adam Smith discusses possible.  Humans need to be trained and trained intensively with near immediate corrective feedback to become maximally productive.<br>  <br>  free trade simply extends the participating human population from your limited trade area to a much larger one.  The huge size and scope of the free trade area that we call America [one single nation with nearly uniform trade and commercial laws] is key to why America's economy continues to outperform Europe's.<br>  <br>  We aren't smarter.  We do work slightly longer.  Our health isn't significantly better.  What we have is a lot more trade and a lot more competition.  And that's what offers our people the opportunity to specialize, get their 10,000 hours in, and become more productive than the people of any other nation.<br>  <br>  free foreign trade simply allows a nation to specialize and gain that advantage in productivity.  It follows that average wages in export industries are higher than average wages in domestic industry.  The export industries are more specialized and thus are able to pay workers more for being more productive.<br>  <br>  This observation about export workers being paid more than the average domestic worker holds for every nation because of the productivity discusses above.  It is why protectionism is such a losing strategy -- you kill your best paying jobs when exports decline while shifting workers in to efforts where they can't be as productive as foreigners and thus aren't work paying as much.<br>  <br>  [exports fall because other nations rightly see you as trying to hog the pie and thus retaliate against your exports -- which are your best paying jobs.]<br>  <br>  As America discovered in the 1930s, export jobs can fall a lot faster than new jobs can arise to replace them.  For one thing, excess capacity doesn't exist in the domestic industry that will replace the imported goods you won't allow any more, so companies have to spend months to years building the needed capacity -- which means that the replacement jobs won't show up for months to years.<br>  <br>  [not to mention that the replacement jobs won't pay as much as the jobs lost in export industries.]|`|JV75Iz3eaa	Yes, comparative advantage and the division of labor underpins all successful economies.<br>  <br>  Erect trade barriers at your own risk and, as always, be careful what you wish for you just might get it!!<br>  <br>  Edit:  Give Spock best answer, he took the time to actually reference Adam Smith.

I don't believe we can compete with many countries simply because of what it cost to live in the USA and with the exchange rates as they are hiring a employ in India even cost less, take for instance $750.00 USA dollars is like $50.000 Rupee's in India.

But when a few control most, then the comparison becomes relevant, but more to the feudal system where there are nobles of various ranks, most likely based on the wealth they control.<br>  <br>  Many of the wealthy this day became so by plundering our 401(k)'s with basically worthless stock that nevertheless had good S&P ratings through the games accountants may play under current regulations.  So I think I would rather compare them to those folk with eyepatches and parrots on their shoulders.<br>  <br>  But REAL capitalists are definitely a thing of the past.  Established money has rigged the game to its own advantage, with the complicity of the government, and what we have today is "free market" corporate feudalism rather than free competition capitalism.<br>  <br>  The indicators are like this:<br>  <br>  When 80% of he money is in the hands of 20% of the people, we have a healthy situation for free market/free competition capitalism.<br>  <br>  When 85% of the money is in the hands of less than 5% of the people, we have a serious problem.  Call it feudalism, oligarchy, economic domination, mercantilism, whatever--tis what our forefathers struggled  with to bring forth this nation four score and seven years before the Gettysburg Address.  And it seems to be what we have here, now.|`|438e26d7b22965d7e9bbd6ed05be2455aa	you can compare them, but you can't equate them.  i'm curious, what purpose would such a comparison serve?  if the concept is that dictators crunched their economies, perhaps an extremely thin line could connect the two.  otherwise they are worlds apart.|`|raLSNm3Paa	Yes, they use those tactics to control a nation for profit.

Their Wall Street and banker bailouts, no bid, over paid government contracts - like Haliburton and Blackwater (Xe), our costly war for oil in Iraq, deregulation and tax cuts for the rich have killed this economy. And the heartless bastards don't want to help people who have lost their jobs now. Republicans, like Roy Blunt of Missouri, even voted against freezing congressional salaries while the economy is such bad shape. The wealthy take care of their own and screw everyone else.|`|8a3bb05fac18cc11e58899cd0251e212aa	And Obama's spending is what?  Frugal?

6OLiuM9Gaa	I think it's tradition and fear.<br>  <br>  Traditionally the military work has been left to the men while the women stay home and take care of the families. Remember these traditions are from when the 18th century when this country was founded.<br>  <br>  Within the last half century or so, women have decided they don't want to be limited to housekeeping and raising children. They want to mix it up with the men... for the purpose of this discussion, in one area in particular... in the military. The military and legislators said, "they'll never make it." Women said, "Equal representation." So, to accommodate the women, the military had to lower physical standards for them. Women just don't have to do what men are expected to do to qualify for the same jobs. This inequity in the system has contributed to men considering women as universally weaker than men. <br>  <br>  I think some men are afraid of being outclassed physically by women. If 95% of the men who try for SEAL duty fail, and if one woman were to qualify (using the same standards as those applied to men), that would mean she's stronger and tougher than 95% of the guys who tried. So they don't even let them try.<br>  <br>  The inequity cuts both ways. If a man tries and fails, he's given another chance. A woman isn't even given the opportunity to try and fail. <br>  <br>  Realistically, I don't think many women want to subject themselves to the stuff SEALs go through... just to qualify. The only reason so many guys want to try is the legend (stories, movies, books). They really don't have much idea what they're getting into. But, if a woman wants to try... and if she's willing to accept failure based on the same standards the men are required to meet, then why not let her try.<br>  <br>  There is a precedent. In the US Forest Service, the most elite firefighters are the smoke jumpers. These guys jump out of planes and parachute into rough terrain where they take on nature at her worst. Some of those "guys" are gals. And some of those gals excel. They jump out of the same planes as the guys. They carry and wield the same equipment as the guys. They fight the same fires in the same terrain as the guys. They face the same dangers as the guys. And they get there by meeting the same standards as the guys.<br>  <br>  I don't think all women dream of being SEAL. I don't think many could qualify. But I know some pretty strong, tough women who might make it if they're interested. I know they're stronger and tougher than most men. If they want a chance, why not give it to them?<br>  <br>  There are a lot of excuses:<br>  <br>  As one poster suggested, men may feel protective. In the teams the poster is absolutely correct. You always look out for your buddies. They also look out for you. That's part of the training. And, on a mission, everybody who goes in comes out. And, I'll tell you, when the stuff starts hitting the fan, the training takes over. If it doesn't, you're more liable to get hit by some of the stuff.<br>  <br>  Some point out the opportunity for sexual encounters. Yeah? And your point is? If a girl can rip a guys arms off and beat him to death with them, it's unlikely that the guy is going to try anything. But the point is moot. Do those who use this argument think that no sexual activity occurs in the military since women aren't allowed in the SEAL program, and that allowing them into the program would foment an ongoing orgy that would destroy the military?<br>  <br>  Some will point out the problem of periods. What difference does that make? If a woman is willing to put up with it, why can't the guys? Some will say the scent can be picked up by dogs and give a position away. I would point out that in Vietnam the enemy could smell us (without dogs) because of our diet... until we adopted the Vietnamese diet.<br>  <br>  A good leader tries to find the best personnel he or she can find, and then tries to make it as easy as possible for them to do their jobs. Just maybe some of those personnel might just be women.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Because G.I. Jane is just a movie not real life.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Dont have the strength to do what the men do. Also something to do with men being more distressed seeing a woman being harmed than another man|`|mRgiBvzUaa	I think it's interesting that only men seem to be replying to this question. <br>  And I also think it interesting that only one has the nerve to come out, not for women, but for fairness. I guess that's going to get me some of those thumbs downs just as it did Gugliamo00.<br>  <br>  I for one don't have any ambitions to get into any Special Operations organization. Honestly, I don't know of any women who do. And I realize the military is probably bound by regulations, and that to change those regulations will likely take an act of Congress. I don't think that poster is disputing that. But, were I so inclined, and were I to accept the consequences of my decision, and, knowing that I may well fail as do apparently about 95% of the male applicants, If I were willing to take that risk, how is it reasonable to deny me that right? <br>  <br>  My boyfriend was SEAL for 12 years. He's trained me and taught me quite a bit. I'm only about 5/8" and weigh... well, let's say about 120. But I'll bet I could out-run, out-fight, probably out-lift, certainly out-swim most of those who posted here... and I'm not even interested in trying out for Special Operations.<br>  <br>  I also know a woman who's a trainer at a local gym. She could probably out-lift most guys. <br>  <br>  I know another woman. She was a Navy Officer. She swam in a meet for the Navy representing her district. She took a first place, two seconds, and a third. She was the only woman swimming in the meet, and she was competing against men. That was in San Diego. In case you're not aware of it, San Diego is where the SEALs live. You can guess how excited they were to be beaten by a mere woman. <br>  <br>  I realize these are isolated instances of excellence in specific areas, but, as the other poster suggested, maybe there are isolated instances that might excel in multiple areas, maybe enough of them to qualify for a Special Operations unit of some kind. Then again, maybe not. But why not let them try?|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Because a female just can't handle the task of a SEAL. There's the physical part, but then also the psychological part that a woman just can't do. That's why woman can't do combat and special operations. <br>  Women should and can do many other jobs in the military though, which is a good thing in my opinion.|`|4uike3ARaa	Because so far, Congress has not authorized it.<br>  Realistically, while I will posit that there are probably some women, somewhere, who could meet the physical standards of the SEALs, those women would be quite rare.<br>  If Congress ever lifts the restriction, I'm sure that one day, there will be women SEALs.|`|9GZWLoNNaa	Females cannot serve in combat positions in the military. To the idiots who say women can't become a SEAL because they are physical inferior are misinformed.|`|VCRuNNvtaa	hmmm  so.... men are superior to women physically and mentally with the exception of a few very rare man-like women.|`|AA11885685	Women do not have the strength for the mission.  I believe though they could serve on a sub.  That will come before navy female SEALs.
4f3cjyw7aa	State residency often differs from "school" residency.<br>  <br>  For instance, I live in Maryland and you are a resident after 90 days (or something like that).  But to be considered "in state" for tuition, I had to live here for 1 year, have my car titled here, have my voter registration here, have most of my possessions here, and pay taxes here.  Check with your school on their "in state residency guidelines" because they will differ from what the state says you need for legal residency (which is usually just 60 to 90 days).|`|pgn2eSpwaa	per most  university websites and state law notations you must prove 1 yr of residency before you can pay in-state tuition<br>  <br>  but this does not include temporary residence in campus housing for the purpose of attending college or university. <br>  <br>  there are some methods which you can use to attempt to establish a permanent address, but this may be challenged if you show more than one residence (where you got mail) during that time|`|PEN3hha7aa	call Arnold, he will tell you..  Buying a home, getting a driver's license and having utility bills in your name come to mind first.  There is normally a time factor involved too.  Florida used to have FREE college tuition (courtesy of the Tourists) for anyone that was a state resident.  They also have/had a Homestead Act where the state would give you 25,000 free to renovate or fix up your home if you lived in a trailer.  She said that was because the state did not want prospective retirees looking for a place to live to find a bunch of lots/homes/trailers in a bad state of disrepair.  There are certain counties in Nothern FL that will not sell land in less than 5 or 10 acre plots just to keep the commercialization in South Florida.  Alachua County used to do that.

What example of the cradle to grave socialism do you want to use: Russia where millions starved, lived in what would be substandard apartments and had the right to go to a prison camp for saying anything negative about the government.  Prefer the Swedish model that was dismantled because it got to the point you had less people working then being supported by the system?  The poor in America live better then 90% of the people in the world.  It is funny that as China moves towards a more capitalist society and free market they have more food and less starvation.  Socialism like it's further movement of communism are both very good sounding but have the same major flaw-People do not operate like that.  Under Marx all worked to the best of their abilities and each got what they needed: Problem is some people want to do very little and that number grows as people figure out I am working hard but getting nothing more then the person who does nothing.  This is what happened with the Swedish system as time passed more and more people decided to do some thing besides work since they didn't have to work.  If you are really willing to give up your freedom and the inherent risk that comes with it for your security then use the freedom you have and go where that is given to you but do not force your viewpoint down the rest of the peoples throats so you can have it easy.  I think that it was Benjamin Franklin who said that people willing to give up their freedom for security will soon have neither; the point is anything the government gives you the government can take away.   One cause for the current situation was a government (both Democratic and Republican) that decided it would be great if every American owned a home and even now more Americans own then ever in history but it also meant many people with out the financial ability to actually do it bought and a large number bought much more then common sense would have permitted-for all the talk about the greedy bankers and mortgage companies the greed of the buyers and sellers is as much to blame as anything else-I can buy a $500,000 home with this payment and sell it before the ARM goes up and make some money is not a home buyer but a house investor just like a person who buys and sells stock for a living stock and they were interested as much as selling or refinancing later then in having a permanent or long term home.  A home is a place you buy to raise your family in or for you to live in long term and not three to five years until the ARM goes up or can sell before then for a profit but a house is an asset you buy to sell when the market goes up.  My home value has fallen but so what-it is my home and not primarily an asset to me; if it keeps going down it means I don't sell it to move further out in the country after my wife retires and will stay here but that is not important as it is my home first.  People who wish for cradle to grave security are those sheep who will give up every freedom they have and of those people around them to feel "safe and secure" but they will not have safety or security in the long term so will end up with nothing.|`|7ZJHBKk9aa	You are correct, in socialist or communist states you have a job, housing, medical care and education provided by the state. All of these things are provided and controlled for you. You are told where to work, when to work, and how much of your state controlled earnings you will be allowed to keep. You are told where you are going to live, how large of small of a home you can have and how much of the earnings from your state dictated job that you are to give to the government to live in that home. You are also told exactly what you will have in that home, how much furniture you are allowed to have in order to be fair to everyone else, how many TV’s you are to have, what you are allowed to watch on that TV, how many radios, what you will listen to on that radio, how many computers you can have, if any, what sites are state approved, what books you are required to have and the ones that you are forbidden to read. You are told where to go to school, you will be taught, by whom, what state approved curriculum will be used in the class room. You will be told what doctors you will be allowed to see, what medical conditions you will be allowed to see a doctor for, when you can see a doctor, and doctors will be told who and what they are allowed to treat. There are also other things for you to consider. You will be told where and when you are allowed to travel, you will be told what you can and can not say and to whom you can talk to. You will be told by the state if you can or can not have a car and what kind you are allowed. In the Soviet Union there where even special lanes of the road that ordinary people could not use, they where reserved for government officials so they did not have to deal with traffic. You are told if you can or can not go to church, even what if any religion you are to follow. If you look at history you will see exactly what happens if you do not follow state regulations to the letter. Millions of people have been imprisoned, placed into forced labor camps, tortured, beaten, starved, shot and hung for not holding the same views of such socialist states as The Soviet Union, Communist China, North Korea, North Vietnam, Cuba, Venezuela, Germany and Italy under socialist rule, and countless other countries. How can any of these things be preferable to freedom of speech or any of the other rights and liberties given to Americans by our creator?|`|YsQQ30YJaa	In socialism everyone has a crappy job and a fixed income. No ability to excel.<br>  In socialism, the government decides what kind of house you deserve and where you live.<br>  In socialism education is controlled and the people are heavily propagandized.<br>  In socialism there is no incentive to develop modern medicine, that;s why "hospitals" use the same needles over and over again.(I saw this documented some years ago)<br>  A "stable" job that doesn't serve your needs is long slow torture, no freedom to educate yourself and move up the ladder.<br>  I saw films of long bread lines in the old Soviet days and many people got nothing after waiting all day.<br>  Behind the Iron curtain of old, workers were asked why production was so low. They responded that if they made ONE more widget in a particular day they would then be expected to make that same number the next day and so on with no pay increase-thus no incentive to produce.<br>  Odds are you are too young to remember all this but I do.Socialism is no dream, it's a nightmare!
62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	The SCOTUS just last year in KENNEDY V. LOUISIANA determined that the death penalty for this crime is disproportionate to the crime committed. <br>  <br>  "The U.S. Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional a Louisiana statute that allowed the death penalty for the rape of a child where the victim did not die. In Kennedy v. Louisiana, the Court held that all such laws, where the crime against an individual involved no murder were not in keeping with the national consensus restricting the death penalty to the worst offenses. As a result, the only two people sentenced to death for this crime in the modern capital punishment era no longer face execution. Both were sentenced under the Louisiana statute that was found unconstitutional. No one is on death row for any offense not involving murder.<br>  <br>  The Court noted that the defendant, Patrick Kennedy, had been sentenced to death under a law that was not embraced by 44 out of the 50 states. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the 5-4 majority, stated, "Based both on consensus and our own independent judgment, our holding is that a death sentence for one who raped but did not kill a child, and who did not intend to assist another in killing the child, is unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments."<br>  The Court pointed to the danger in laws such as Louisiana's, which allowed the death penalty where no murder was committed: "When the law punishes by death, it risks its own sudden descent into brutality, transgressing the constitutional commitment to decency and restraint."|`|zmmP52P3aa	because libs value the lives of rapists more than those of innocent children.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	I truly and firmly believe that such people should be put to death!

All of which cost thousands of dollars.<br>  How about this tax break: 10￠ bullet to the head after a decisive trial.|`|3caq6SFxaa	Personally do not think child molesters should be given the death penalty.  Did you know that in almost all prisons they are kept away from the rest of the prison population for the safety of the molester?  No tattoo child molester on their foreheads and then put then in with the rest of the prison population and have all guards leave and surveillance cameras turned off for three hours each day; no where as quick and easy as the death penalty would be.|`|8SyUHkPXaa	I agree with you: this heinous act deserves the death penalty.<br>  Edit: Actually the other answers are correct...

Because its probably their actual philosphy on the way things should be according to their view of the world.

But I do have an opinion about Limbaugh and what he represents.  This is a brave new world we are living in.  Many, especially those whose level of education is less than perfect,  live in fear of change.  They see Rush as representing the way things used to be.  This is what some people call the John Wayne mentality.  Shoot first, ask questions afterward.  He is a man who tells it like it is.  No subtle innuendos. He's a straight shooter.  A true blue American.  He can not tolerate anything he deems as  un American.

First of all you did not need to give up custody of your child to join the Army.  All you needed to do was to assign someone to be their guardian.  Yes it should be the father if he is willing and able.  You should have gotten everything in writing.  The only thing I can say is get a lawyer.  You also need to get a family care plan in place.  Also look into who is going to take care of the kids while you are working those long hours.  Remember the Army is not a 9-5 job.  The courts will need to see that your children are not going to be neglected because of your career.  Good luck to you.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	Did you think about all that when you were signing up?

tdIuoIc1aa	talking to another lawyer is questionable because they will always recommend changing to them - since they want the money. you need to talk with your lawyer first and if you have a friend who is a lawyer, or legal aid, go to them for an opinion. firing your attorney is always an option.<br>  <br>  btw if the police obtained a key from someone to enter the home, was that person a legal resident of that home? if so, you have no case against the search. if it was just a girlfriend who had a key, then it was an illegal search|`|xxDjV6Axaa	First, tell him your concerns and that it is to the point where you think maybe someone else should represent you.  The court frowns on people changing lawyers for misrespresentation so he won't want that.  It might be that easy to change the situation.<br>  <br>  If he continues though, I would get another lawyer.  This is your future and you can't afford to care about hurting his feelings.|`|gMxtD2Xoaa	you need to consult with another lawyer...good luck....|`|26d7bc79cdc0ea1eb58f4883915007a1aa	What kind of evidence did the police obtain when they illegally entered your home?  Did they have a warrant?  Where you there when they came in?<br>  Why do you think you don't have grounds for an appeal?<br>  I would recommend you at least go see a public defender to talk about your case and find out if your attorney really has dropped the ball like you say.<br>  Also, keep in mind that if money is an issue and your attorney really is failing to adequately represent your interests, you can always sue him for malpractice.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|PEN3hha7aa	I would fire this person. yesterday.  You don't have to know the law to know that paying someone to do something who won't even return your phone calls is flat out wrong.<br>  <br>  I would start by getting as much written documentation as I could as fast you can.  That includes transcripts of the court proceedings.  I would also not go to a County Legal Aid Department.  All they will do is refer you to someone and you may not be any better off.  if your municipality has online court records you might go so far as to research them and find similar cases and maybe someone that will be honest with you.  Understand that most people will not be real interested in talking about past litigation, even if you are totally up front with them.<br>  <br>  The only other Red Flag I can think of is if you get a new attorney and they say anything bad about your current attorney you need to walk out the door immediately.  Dishonest mechanics do that all the time just to make you think you made a better choice before They take your money too.<br>  <br>  The best legal advice I ever heard came from a local attorney at a first time home buyers seminar that I attended.   He told us flat out "if you don't get it in writing, it never happened".    Get all the documentation you can.  Soon.<br>  <br>  Talk to some other legal people too because I don't understand something.  What do your grounds for appeal have to do with who represents you?  Common Sense does not always apply in the legal system, but what does he or she the attorney have to do with the laws that are in place?  The lawyer you choose is like deciding what to wear to work;  you can and do change work clothes every day, but the fact that you have to go to work to earn a living does not change.  <br>  <br>  Last, you are doing the smart thing by not giving details of the case to anyone.  If this current attorney wants to be a butthead about it he/she knows they can take you to court and make your life emotionally and financially miserable.  They won't care if they win or not, all they will care about is "paying you back" for what you supposedly said or did, and they are using the money YOU paid them to do it..  Think about that for a bit..
9YOXpVM0aa	The points system works really well to bring in educated immigrants but it has some flaws.  <br>  <br>  If we talk of the system before the modifications to it at the end of last November, it had the following flaws.. For the immigrants, they might have thought that they were being allowed to immigrate because there were jobs for them.  However, since there are no points for being of a certain profession, immigrants with education there is no need for in Canada could still immigrate but they couldn't find jobs.  Then they end up really bitter and make websites such as notcanada.com<br>  <br>  The same flaw in the system causes another problem, mainly that the system gets clogged up by all these "not needed in Canada" people and the people with education actually needed get stuck in the queue.<br>  <br>  The most recent modifications are designed to fix this.  They have now in addition to the points system added some other qualifiers, namely that you need to already be working or studying in Canada or you have a job offer of you are of one of 38 professions they have deemed as most needed.<br>  <br>  It is still a flaw in the system that they do not take licensing into account.  Some of the professions on the list of 38 are under licensing requirements and for some of them, it's extremely hard, time consuming and expensive to get licensed so you could still end up with people who immigrate to Canada because they are on the list of 38 and then can't get a job because they can't get licensed.<br>  <br>  Anyway, it is up to each person to do their homework before they immigrate anywhere and find out if there are jobs for them and if they have to take an exam to be able to work in their profession.  In some cases, they still choose to immigrate, even if they have to change professions but that is up to them.  If they do their research, at least they know what to expect.
k5P8XK62aa	It depends, hotel rooms count as homes and are thus exempt. However in areas other than rooms then it's the normal ￡2,500 fine (plus costs, so figure about ￡10,000 going on fines that have actually been issued) for the management and the hotel.<br>  <br>  The guest would get a ￡50 fine...<br>  <br>  But then again, given the closure rate for pubs has increased seventeenfold since the smoking ban came into force, more and more landlords are likely to be prepared to take the risk.
AA11622716	yes.
iaugc41aaa	It all depends what happens in the administration.  The status means that the company is technically unable to pay its debts.  The administrators can, however, trade through and sell on the business as a going concern.  At that point, the new owner may honour the old terms.<br>  <br>  The real problem comes if the company folds completely.  If that happens you become simply another unsecured creditor and your chances of getting anything out at all will be somewhat remote.<br>  <br>  Sorry.
AA10925759	That one answer about the landlord not having a key. That is bull pucky as there are certain legalities involved. Plus if there ever does happen to be a major emergency and the landlord or emergency responders have to take extra time to enter.... you could end up paying bigtime. <br>  <br>  You said your landlord is cool. Your girlfriend signed a lease for a year so that is what she signed up for and that time has passed.<br>  <br>  You currently have no lease at all. So you would be legally covered if you get a new one be it month to month or another year. Most any landlord is not going to have an issue with that knowing that if you say happened to not pay they can take legal steps. Finding a new person would cost her money in the end anyway.<br>  <br>  Talk to the landlord and let her know what is up. That in itself will give you legal backup. Regardless she is not on the lease. If she is caught there the police will just escort her out. <br>  <br>  The key thing. Inform the landlord. Best way to go about it is to offer to pay for it or do it yourself. You can get a two lock combo for around $40. <br>  <br>  Once all of that is done check any windows and such as your ex might be leaving them unlocked. If you know what times she goes over ponder taking a day off from work so if they show you can call the police. <br>  <br>  Cover your butt.|`|4uike3ARaa	No repercussions legally, but she might key your car.<br>  Watch out with someone like this.

Do not hesitate to get police involved. <br>  But change the locks first, with the landlord's approval.|`|H9k65Ve0aa	All of her belongings are gone from the premises, she has relinquished<br>  any rights she may have had. So to cover all the bases, tell your landlady that she has moved out and give her a key to the new lock, voile!|`|9f8XoDKJaa	I think the landlord has to re do the locks.  Ask them too for that reason.<br>  <br>  And sign a contract with your name on it not theres.|`|VjgqZetcaa	I agree with Ben. As for some of the other answers, there is absolutely no reason that a landlord should have a key to your place, and this is always a negotiable term.  Change the locks and don't give a key to anyone.  If it's an "emergency" then they can break in and bill you for the extra damages.

Law A writ issued to bring a party before a court to prevent unlawful restraint. [<Med. Lat., you should have the body] Source: AHD<br>  <br>  The basic premise behind habeas corpus is that you cannot be held against your will without just cause. To put it another way, you cannot be jailed if there are no charges against you. If you are being held, and you demand it, the courts must issue a writ of habeas corpus, which forces those holding you to answer as to why. If there is no good or compelling reason, the court must set you free. It is important to note that of all the civil liberties we take for granted today as a part of the Bill of Rights, the importance of habeas corpus is illustrated by the fact that it was the sole liberty thought important enough to be included in the original text of the Constitution.|`|rsJt3CKaaa	The Magna Carta

pgn2eSpwaa	there are fees which the court allows an attorney or private party to execute a will or estate filing, but there are also fees which the court assesses against the estate, beased on the value of assets which are transferred to heirs. this is one of the more thankless tasks of an executor, paying estate taxes and fees, as the heirs always assume the executor is skimming funds from the inheritance, when in fact many "estates" are not legally obligated to account or enter a probate filing, as the net assets of property and funds is below a statutory limit <br>  (once debts have been resolved, what's left is less than the minimum amount required to submit a probate filing - each state has a set limit, <br>  and some refused to allow the reduction for debts against assets, so fees may be based on the value of property, not the net estate, which may explain the situation the lousisiana person described)<br>  <br>  per Chapter 206 section 16 of MA  law<br>  "An executor, administrator, guardian, conservator or trustee shall be allowed his reasonable expenses, costs and counsel fees incurred in the execution of his trust, and shall have such compensation for services as the court may allow. Such compensation, expenses, costs and counsel fees may be apportioned between principal and income as the court may determine."|`|AA11206283	Q: Does the executor get paid?<br>  <br>  A: Yes. In addition to all out-of-pocket expenses in managing and settling the estate, Personal Representatives (executors) generally earn a fee of about 2% of the probate estate for their work. (This varies moderately in jurisdictions and generally decreases as a percentage as the size of the estate increases). <br>  <br>  All fees and reimbursed expenses are subject to court approval. The court in cases of unusually difficult or extraordinary circumstances may allow additional fees. On the other hand, if a Personal Representative is derelict in duty, the court may reduce or deny compensation, and the Personal Representative may be held responsible for any damages they caused. This is an important reason to share the burden with an expert at the cost of the Estate. It is an investment well made.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	In Louisiana, they have the legal right to determine how much time and energy goes into the handling of the job and they can charge whatever they feel is reasonable. They can pay them-self what they feel is justified in their viewpoint. They can be paid as much as the probate lawyer and this is separate from the rest of what they grab out of the estate and take. If the Executor is smart and greedy, they end up with all of it unless you want to challenge your relative in court. It is pure greed.

First and foremost it means long family separations from family and things that people would otherwise be enjoying if they were back home.  These separations are not just single or solitary as many people have deployed now two and thee times in the past several years.  Not only that but then when they are back home they are required to maintain certain standards and meet certain training requirements.  Some of these things are on a two or three year cycle and so a person deployed for a 6-15 months is pushed to get things done, once they are back home in a lesser time frame.  If they don't they get punitive actions taken against them, maybe passed over for promotion, even though they did their job while being deployed, and have nothing to look forward to 12-24 months down the road but another deployment.  Raising a family, spending time with them and also being able to enjoy the things that everyone else outside the military is able to enjoy all take a back seat to this situation as well.  This all affects their morale and how they view their career and job in the military.  I personally have known several people that turned down promotions and chose to get out rather than stay in and take any more deployments and the stress that it puts on them and their families and their lives.|`|AA11701133	Your friends and family are your morale boosters.  The longer you're away, the lower your morale.  Also, with the constant threat upon their lives, there really leaves no down time.  There are also no vacations or weekends off while deployed.  You live the war every minute of every day.|`|lAng0Cfpaa	I think during World War 2 there was a just cause and all the soldiers knew that back home they were dropping bombs in London so they had a strong morale and kept fighting for years.<br>  At the moment the wars that are going on do not seem to have the same relevance to anybody so i guess it would lead people to ask why are they even there in the first place?

Any sign or marking on any roadway, highway, freeway, stop, intersection, parking area, parking garage or whatever is there for a reason. You cant pick and choose which ones are "legally binding" and which ones you want to follow and which ones you dont. Just pay the ticket and drive the right way next time.  you could have hit someone going the wrong way.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	It depends.<br>  Is the parking garage municipally owned (by the city, county, etc.)? Then yes, the cops can ticket you there.<br>  Or is the parking garage privately owned, but the property owner has a contract with the city to allow the cops to enforce state traffic and parking laws there? Then they can ticket you there. Many shopping mall parking lots operate that way.<br>  Otherwise, if it's private property and there's no government contract, then the cops can't enforce most traffic and parking laws there (handicapped parking rules being an exception). For instance, if I were to simply nail up a "no parking" sign in my own driveway, it wouldn't be legally binding if a guest of mine decided to ignore it.<br>  <br>  But as a practical matter, you could still get sued if you cause an accident by driving the wrong way. The judge in a civil court isn't going to care whether the sign was enforceable under the state traffic code, since ignoring a fair warning would be deemed an act of carelessness either way.|`|a8e1KcS2aa	Pretty sure that it's private property, and in many jurisdictions, traffic citations can not be given on private property... however, certain moving violations ARE able to be issued on private property...

But the negateve fluctuations are caused by seasonal vagaries particularly under Rainfed cultivations, irrigated areas dependent on seasonal (rainfed) tanks, Dams depending on seasonal river etc, lack of adequate power supply for lift irrigation particularly in summer, low farm gate prices offered by traders (most important snag), etc<br>  <br>  The govts are not able to concentrate much on farm sector albeit the largest rural population dependent on the enterprise, due to the increasing demand for massive funds from more important - contributing more to GDP, more tax earning, more influential (like trade and services) competing sectors..<br>  <br>  If only reasonable farm gate prices are ensured and the basic inputs like assured power for lift irrigation, timely release of water from govt canals (by proper maintenance of tanks, dams and conveyance channels etc) are provided, this sector would make a bumper contribution to food grain pool, the industry depending on agrl raw materials etc besieds producing abundant labour in the rural side (that are affected due to less cultivation for want of water power etc..) and reducing poverty greatly..<br>  <br>  But the rulers and political parties are using the sector for playing political games rather than tackle the problems seriously and sincerely..|`|GllB4mPZaa	Don't disturb him, he is busy in cricket projects.|`|WETYSQcfaa	well v r already surplus in production of major food grains like wheat n rice.

n2oEhdZiaa	When you substantially increase your score from one test to the next (usually 20 AFQT points or more) then you have to take a confirmation ASVAB.  Basically, they want to see if you test again and your score drops a lot or if it stays near the higher score.  It is a way of checking for test fraud.  There may also be a brief interview with an officer at MEPS.  Typically, this happens when kids take the test in HS to get out of class and fail it on purpose and then try later, or occasionally kids who are not computer literate will score much higher on the written test because they are more comfortable.  Just relax, it's not too big of a deal.  Even you score less than the 55, your score will stay at a 55.  They just want to see that it doesn't drop down into the 20s or whatever.|`|IdtzdpqGaa	Normally there is no reason to take it again unless he wants you to try and better your score, good luck, study study study|`|jeLehwmpaa	ive never heard of someone having to retake it a third time after the practice test with you recruter and the real one <br>  just tell them no your already sworn in|`|7lkOdoyHaa	I heard just today, from an AF recruiter, that the Air Force is now requiring a minimum ASVAB score of 65 to be eligible for enlistment.

If you just want to get laid and don't care if she might be a child, then you run the risk of many years in prison for having sex with a child.|`|62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	Yes, most statutory rape laws throughout the country include a clause or section that states the either ignorance of the minor's age or misrepresentation by the minor of his/her age is not a defense.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	Yes, you can.<br>  <br>  You can argue that she lied and looks older and you may win, but it's generally expected that the adult would confirm her age on his own and 'know better'<br>  <br>  So, yes, you can be charged and can lose.|`|AA11409272	Ignorance is not a legal excuse|`|704e5d296085ea43392282942c0cf641aa	YES.<br>  <br>  Sounds like somebody is in deep doo-doo!|`|VjgqZetcaa	Yes, statutory rape (by definition) protects minors REGARDLESS of whether they are good liars, obtain false identification, attempted to consent (which is impossible), signed sworn papers saying they were old enough, or the rapist is simply a poor judge of a person's age.|`|2rcSILkWaa	Yes.  A person always has to be sure of what they are doing.  Ignorance is no excuse.<br>  <br>  Same thing as a bartender giving an underage person a beer because the kid gave him a false ID.  He'd still get charged for allowing it to happen.|`|tOBUxfYvaa	Yes they can but they will likely be given some leniency if it can be proven that they were deceived.|`|jRXQ6kgCaa	Yes!

6b4d4fb2e519a8ffe2f58e1c9e3c4a2baa	IN THE FIRST SENTENCE IT SAYS SHE WAS CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER!!!!!! PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU ARE POSTING!!! ILLEGALS AREN'T RELEASED BECAUSE THEY LEAVE THE COUNTRY!!!! JUST ASK SOMEONE  WHO HAD A FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER KILLED BY AN ILLEGAL DRUNK DRIVER!!!|`|vOI3u9jfaa	I would not care if she was pink.GET A ROPE!|`|CM3Fl3WRaa	She is being charged with "attempted first-degree murder". You cited this fact!<br>  If it was an illegal alien they would be in jail. Illegal aliens are a flight risk! So many run back to their country that AZ has laws against releasing them! <br>  <br>  GREAYTONY:VERY GOOD POINT! and if you've seen the news reports, they always show a very good picture of her too....hmmmm! why? because she's white? because she's a student? or ?<br>  <br>  Now, if that was an illegal immigrant, they would have used the worst mug shot they could come up with and post it..plus she would be behind bars to. The headlines would make sure that you knew that she was an illegal, especially if she was from Mexico. They'd probably even tell us what city in Mexico she was from.<br>  <br>  1) that is a standard mug shot in the AZ Republic. Do you honestly expect us to believe that the Pima county sheriffs office has a special set-up just to take pictures of illegal aliens that makes them look bad? If you think that illegal aliens look so hideous in photographs that is your opinion and not a reflection of the police photographer!<br>  2) Do you think white women look so much better than illegal aliens? Are you saying that illegal aliens are NOT from all over the world? Are you saying that illegal aliens are "brown" only? Isn't that rather racist?<br>  3) If she was an illegal alien and released she would most likely run back to her country of origin. It happens so much that AZ has laws against releasing them!<br>  4) If she was Mexican as you state and they released her. She would of slithered back across the border where the Mexican government would protect her and refuse to extradite her back to the US! <br>  5) the AZ Republic is pro-criminal! You cite it many times yourself!  One picture and now they are no good?|`|eu6UQElYaa	Actually plenty of women, not illegal, have gone to jail for similar actions.  This girl has been arrested.  In case you didn't read the first line yourself, she has been charged with attempted murder.  Not everyone sits in jail after being arrested, even those charged with attempted murder, that's especially true when the investigation isn't complete yet, which it sounds like it's not.  They are having her surrender her passport and she can't leave the jurisdiction so it's pretty obvious that she'll be going to court and likely seeing prison time.  <br>  <br>  If this were an illegal, you'd never hear anything about it.|`|iWLeHnlnaa	VERY GOOD POINT! and if you've seen the news reports, they always show a very good picture of her too....hmmmm! why? because she's white? because she's a student? or ? <br>  <br>  Now, if that was an illegal immigrant, they would have used the worst mug shot they could come up with and post it..plus she would be behind bars to.

FKN9kBvLaa	Your only hearing from the extreme righties here who come here to vent their frustrations because they really can't do anything else.  Remember, the internet is a breeding ground for unpopular opinion (if it were popular, they would have won).  They're angry because the country is basically evolving without them.  And lets face it, they aren't very intelligent.  Most of the ones you hear from here would rather see Obama and our country in RUINS, just so they can say "I told you so".  I didn't like Bush (the man not the colloquialism..lol), but I wanted him to succeed because my country was at stake.  Most of the Cons you hear from here are so hateful, institutionally racists (see the guy who called Obama "President Buckwheat a few answers above) and blindly patriotic that there judgment is EXTREMELY jaded.  They won't support of give Obama credit no matter what he does.  At least Liberals gave Bush A CHANCE to screw up the country (and he did) before we started criticizing, they aren't even doing that.  They all just assume that all the things Obama's doing are going to fail or screw us up, without even waiting for the results. <br>  <br>  This is not a forum for intelligent debate, just polarizing hate and banter from both sides.  I just come hear for the laughs|`|c1566a746196b29f9589775543f6928caa	Your forgetting that the budget surplus that Clinton ran was only a paper surplus.  We were still in debt because of the spending that started in President Johnson's administration.  That is like saying I saved $50 while shopping at Kohls, but you spent $150 on crap you did not need.  <br>  <br>  Regardless of who is in power right now, people need to realize that we cannot continue to spend like we are.  The whole economy will collapse due to hyper inflation.  We had 26% interest rates under Jimmy Carter.  If China does not keep buying our debt, we will have to raise the interest rate on T-Bills to attract investment.  This raises the cost of buying things for you and I.  <br>  <br>  The country is basically bankrupt.  Everyone (republicans and democrats) has been yelling about this for years.  Bush was bad, but Obama will be worse when it comes to spending.  <br>  <br>  If only I were king, I would veto everything that came out of Congress until spending was under control.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	Because the Democrats on here are so vacuous.

And when Obama gets through with it, he'll make Bush look like a miser who hates to borrow a dime. <br>  <br>  "About how Clinton was the one who actually ruined the economy (they all forget he had a budget surplus, I suppose)"<br>  <br>  No, Clinton did not have a budget surplus.

Their  tax cuts helped the rich while the middle class tax burden went up. They defend the rights of businesses and corporations over the average American citizen. Some corporations pay little to no taxes while Republicans send the message that they pay the highest taxes in the world. Tax breaks were given to ship American jobs over seas in order to pay slave wages in third world countries to increase their profits. Now that Americans are hurting, the GOP is crying about the financial burden of our grand children. What a joke!!!

Possibly, in the modern sense it has gone further in that we now tend to censor ourselves.  This is because people are not sure of the boundaries of what is and is not acceptable.<br>  <br>  I take issue with the premise that you can legislate people to like each other.  But the fact that 'offence' has become such a catch-all has had the paradoxical effect of creating a sense of injury that did not exist before.  People can now take offence at anything and everything because they know they can take advantage of it and attack their enemies.  So PC promotes the worst in human nature.|`|RYQ3i0ZNaa	So many ways.<br>  <br>  One example: my school is full of "chalk boards" rather than "black boards".

Sorry, but if a member of my family was murdered, I wouldn't want at the back of my mind the question of "are they here because they're the best, or because they were fast-tracked for being a woman/African etc." - the best person for the job is the best person for the job, and sex or race should not be considered in any way, especially in important jobs that sometimes people's lives rely on.|`|888173de53a1103582161858fdde458caa	The stars Y/A's puts on United ***** College Fund.<br>  <br>  I notice sometimes ***** is there and sometimes it's all *****.<br>  <br>  Refresh a couple of times and it will change.

The single place I feel (what I consider) 'political correctness' has gone too far is in pretending (especially in mass communications -- television accounting as the principle offender) that stupidity is a 'valid' 'opinion'. I consider it the harbinger of the collapse of society that the knowledgeable and informed commentator expresses a responsible and thoughtful opinion followed by the absolutely brainless halfwit that expels excrement from a shredder while we nod our heads and chant, “Well, he is entitled to his opinion. It is free speech after all.” Stupidity is not an ‘opinion’ nor is it an entitlement, it does not compliment and encourage free speech, it interferes and sabotages it. I understand it’s a dangerous idea but at this point, I would not automatically oppose an intellectual elitist action squad that polices mass media, and when the brainless halfwit expels excrement from a shredder, the intellectual elitist action squad swoops in, calls the stupid, stupid then removes them from the proceedings. That is my only complaint.|`|a9e937dafab0e1205c0c23b2f6caefa6aa	political correctness usually boils down to simply being considerate of others feelings.<br>  <br>  i'm not really sure why anyone who is a normal adult would ever have a problem with that.<br>  <br>  but it's a bit rough on sexists, racists and bigots - and generally calls them what they are...|`|AA11130104	It brings about unequal protection under the law.<br>  <br>  If I scream at a gay guy I am guilty of hate speech and can be prosecuted in many places.<br>  <br>  If I scream at a hetero guy, I'm just a jerk|`|e2facf0a453208536391b6d4d3f72b15aa	If that isn't the greatest oxymoron of all time...political correctness, the words just make me laugh.|`|14gytfMLaa	Do you know what?

uvWH4Ioyaa	The majority of criminal defendants end up pleading guilty or nolo to a lesser charge even after they have requested a jury trial. If this case goes to trial, there are too many variables to accurately predict an outcome. The jury will be told, after all the evidence is submitted, that they must be unanimous and find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of every element of the offense. If he has a sharp lawyer, he'll try to turn the case around and say it was "self defense" and that you provoked him, etc. If he is convicted, he may or may not get jail time, depending on his prior record and many other factors including the prosecutor's recommendation. The judge could give him a suspended sentence conditional on his good behavior and require him to stay away from you. Or the judge could make him pay a fine. Too many variables to give you a definite answer. It would be best to talk with the prosecutor or victim's rights advocate, if any.|`|9d3779e08741de60c8b3afd027f91e1eaa	3-6 months jail time.

He sponsors civil war and violent behavior.  From one of his epasodes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mad max threatens California<br>  <br>  Mad max is a 1979 Australian film which tells the story of social breakdown, murder, a nd mayhem in post-apocalyptic Australia.  The film tells the story of the violence and blood shed that can be expected when civilized society is deprived of necessities such as food, water, or energy supplies.  It is an orgy of violence and bloodshed that present day  Californians should be thinking very seriously about.<br>  <br>   A January 17, 2009 story in the Los Angeles Times  by Evan Halper and Patrick McGreevy is headlined “California controller to suspend tax refunds, welfare checks, student grants.  It tells the story of  California’s ongoing financial crisis, brought on by years of liberal and Democratic dominance in California politics.<br>  But more importantly, it provides a chilling glimpse of what is in store for the people of America if  Barack Obama, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi are permitted to impose their ideal of what America is all about from their respective perches in Washington.<br>  <br>   According to the Times, State Controller John Chiang said he had “no choice but to stop making some $3.7 billion in payments in the absence of action by the governor and lawmakers to close the state’s nearly $42 billion budget deficit.  More than half of those payments are tax refunds.”  The state expects to be $346 million short of funds in the month of February, and by March the state could find itself totally insolvent.<br>  <br>   The controller anticipates that the suspended payments could be “rolled into IOU’s if California still lacks the  cash to pay its bills by March or April.  In a most unfortunate  choice of words, the controller said that it pained him to  “pull this trigger “ but that it was a “critically necessary action.  California officials have already designed an “IOU template” and are now negotiating with banks to determine whether taxpayers, students, and welfare recipients would be allowed to cash or deposit them, if and when they’re issued.<br>  <br>   Just ask yourself…Who  but a  bunch of liberal Democrats would even dream that  banks would exchange  cash for a worthless piece of paper that is  backed  by…nothing?  If you think that’s a good idea, you might also think it would be a good idea to elect a young inexperienced , radical leftist of questionable  citizenship as President of the United States.<br>  <br>   The times tells us that, “the payments to be frozen include nearly $2 billion in tax refunds; 300 million in cash grants for needy families, blind, disabled; and $13 million in grants for college students.”  The state will continue to pay more than $6.6 billion in school and healthcare bills.<br>   In the face if this looming disaster, the governor is asking for tax increases, spending cuts, the relaxation of some environmental regulations and legislation to allow some government  construction.  The governor has ordered non-essential state employees to take two days off each month…without pay …and most state offices, including the Department of Motor Vehicles, is to close on those two days.<br>  <br>   If you’ve never lived in California and have never visited a DMV office to acquire a drivers license or car tags, you have no idea what that means.<br>  According to the Times, the state has also stopped payment of bond money covering more than 5,300 public works projects in progress.  276 of those projects have been exempted because they are nearly complete and the cost of shutting them down would be greater than the cost to finish them.  In the meantime, contractors are warning of the unintended consequences of stemming the flow of public works funds, suggesting that such action would be taken at significant cost.  <br>  <br>   Caltran s Director Will Kempton estimates that the state would incur an estimated $350 million in legal costs, breach-of -contract claims, and expenses for securing dormant construction sites.<br>  To say that California is a state teetering on the brink of anarchy would be an understatement.<br>   What happens when welfare checks and student aid funds are cut off and public works projects are suspended.  Democrats in Sacramento will almost certainly find a way to ram tax increases through the legislature and the governor, threatened with another kind of “ cutoff” by his liberal Democrat wife, will sign them into law.<br>  <br>   But tax increases are exactly the wrong prescription.  As corporate taxes increase, businessmen across the state will react.  Some will lay off workers, increasing the ranks of the  unemployed, while others will simply close their doors and announce a move to Arizona, Texas or Oklahoma.  College students from San Diego to Sacramento will stage violent protests, shutting down most colleges and universities and over taxing police and National Guard forces.<br>  <br>   Taxpayers due refunds and public works contractors|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	This is a silly question.

Republicans did not advocate a complete privatization of Social Security. The plan was to allow investment of 5% of future FICA taxes by individuals. These investments could be varied and did not necessarily have to be placed in the stock market directly. No one advocated privatizing education. What was advocated was allowing choice in selection of schooling options. As for the private sector. Sustained jobs and economic growth are not produced by government and never have been. The private sector is responsible for this function whether Democrats can actually admit this to themselves or not. Your positions are laughable because they are not based on factual accounting of the plans you mention.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	Ummm.  You do realize that your Social Security is backed by treasury bonds with no money to redeem them don't you?

YupMCYHlaa	The Republicans have a long-standing strategy of encouraging partisanship and polarization.  It began with Nixon, but it really got going with Reagan.  In the 70s more and more Americans were registering as independent, voting for 'the man, not the party'.  But the Republicans saw this situation didn't benefit them, because they have always been the minority party, and the only way a minority party can seize control is through angering theie 'base', getting them all riled up, getting them to the polls.<br>  <br>  Right wing talk radio plays a big part here.  The RNC comes up with 'talking points' which it faxes each morning to Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, and they hammer on them all day long.  They know their audience doesn't want to hear both sides of the story, they only want their own unfortunate prejudices reinforced.  So Limbaugh and Hannity et al come up with ways to blame all our problems on Democrats.  And, as you can see, right-wingers post this malicious crap here like a bunch of parrots.

How as George Bush responsible for the spending with a Democratic majority in Congress that had to approve it, both sides filibustered or threatened too (the Democrats quite frequently prior to 2006) and the bills to increase supervision of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac plus keep them out of the sub-prime market were stopped by the Democrats lead by Frank, Pelosi and Reid.  Both parties messed up the economy and as far as "neocons" blaming everything on Congress; that is probably a reaction to "Bush did it all" from your side including the passing and signing of the NAFTA treaty which was signed by former President Clinton early in the second term.  Both parties screwed it up so both should take responsibility and quit playing the blame game.  As far as the republicans are always partisan-explain the "great years" of former President Clinton who had a Republican majority most of the time or former President Reagan who operated with Democratic congress well?  Most periods of real prosperity have been when Congress is controlled by one party and the Presidency the other for most of the post WW2 era Republicans had the Presidency and the Democrats controlled Congress or vise versa and as the old saying goes it takes two to tango.  Link below is Presidential vetoes- former President Bush had 10-two over ridden or 12 (two were attempted pocket vetoes that failed) so either way 8 bills vetoed so as President vetoed less  bills successfully and attempted the least number of vetoes of any modern President serving more then two years (Harding did a little less); actually stopped eight bills passed by Congress and former President Clinton thirty five in his eight years; the king of veto was FDR with over 600.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	No. Nazi Germany was not socialist.<br>  To most people, Hitler's beliefs belong to the extreme far right. For example, most conservatives believe in patriotism and a strong military; carry these beliefs far enough, and you arrive at Hitler's warring nationalism. This association has long been something of an embarrassment to the far right. To deflect such criticism, conservatives have recently launched a counter-attack, claiming that Hitler was a socialist, and therefore belongs to the political left, not the right.<br>  The primary basis for this claim is that Hitler was a National Socialist. The word "National" evokes the state, and the word "Socialist" openly identifies itself as such.<br>  However, there is no academic controversy over the status of this term: it was a misnomer. Misnomers are quite common in the history of political labels. Examples include the German Democratic Republic (which was neither) and Vladimir Zhirinovsky's "Liberal Democrat" party (which was also neither). The true question is not whether Hitler called his party "socialist," but whether or not it actually was.<br>  <a href="http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-hitler.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-hitler.h...</a><br>  Then there is the enabeling act. The only party to go on record voting against it were the social democrats after communists had already been thrown in jail.<br>  <br>  A two thirds majority was needed, since the law would actually alter the German constitution. Hitler needed 31 non-Nazi votes to pass it. He got those votes from the Center Party after making a false promise to restore some basic rights already taken away by decree.<br>  However, one man arose amid the overwhelming might. Otto Wells, leader of the Social Democrats stood up and spoke quietly to Hitler.<br>  "We German Social Democrats pledge ourselves solemnly in this historic hour to the principles of humanity and justice, of freedom and socialism. No enabling act can give you power to destroy ideas which are eternal and indestructible."<br>  <a href="http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/timeline/enabling.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/ti...</a><br>  I'd also like to add all Neo Nazi parties are openly far right|`|i6QfwNTJaa	no they were deranged ppl<br>  if u think they were socialist then ur wrong.<br>  they wanted to rule the world for crying out loud.<br>  what kind of world would we live in if they would've succeeded? yikes!<br>  don't want to think about that.|`|krAlopvsaa	Anti capitalists are socialists. <br>  <br>  It does not matter, <br>  Do not imagine as a straight line, but as a circle.<br>  <br>  Once you get far enough right or left to kill people based upon idelogy you are at the same point.<br>  <br>  Hitler ran on change and a different form of government.

They refer to the seating arrangements of the french Parliament in 1791, and aren't really helpful in modern times.<br>  <br>  <br>  To answer your question, they were socialist. They may have attacked the SWP and Communists for political reasons, but look at the OED definition of socialism:<br>  <br>  A political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole. <br>  <br>  From Wikipedia:<br>  <br>  Nazi publications and speeches included anti-capitalist (especially anti-finance capitalist) rhetoric. Hitler attacked what he called “pluto-democracy,” which he claimed to be a Jewish conspiracy to favor democratic parties in order to keep capitalism intact. The “corporation” was attacked by orthodox Nazis as being the leading instrument of finance capitalism, with the role of Jews emphasized. The National Socialist party described itself as socialist, and, at the time, conservative opponents such as the Industrial Employers Association described it as “totalitarian, terrorist, conspiratorial, and socialist.”<br>  <br>  The Nazi Party’s 1920 “Twenty-Five Point Programme” demanded:<br>  <br>      …that the State shall make it its primary duty to provide a livelihood for its citizens… the abolition of all incomes unearned by work… the ruthless confiscation of all war profits… the nationalization of all businesses which have been formed into corporations… profit-sharing in large enterprises… extensive development of insurance for old-age… land reform suitable to our national requirements…<br>  <br>  Nazi Party officials made several attempts in the 1920s to change some of the program or replace it entirely. In 1924, Gottfried Feder proposed a new 39-point program that kept some of the old planks, replaced others and added many completely new ones. Hitler did not mention any of the planks of the programme in his book, Mein Kampf, and he only mentioned it in passing as “the so-called programme of the movement”.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hitler said in 1927, “We are socialists, we are enemies of today’s capitalistic economic system for the exploitation of the economically weak, with its unfair salaries, with its unseemly evaluation of a human being according to wealth and property instead of responsibility and performance.” However, Hitler wrote in 1930, “Our adopted term 'Socialist' has nothing to do with Marxian Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true Socialism is not.” In a confidential 1931 interview, Hitler told the influential editor of a pro-business newspaper, “I want everyone to keep what he has earned subject to the principle that the good of the community takes priority over that of the individual. But the State should retain control; every owner should feel himself to be an agent of the State… The Third Reich will always retain the right to control property owners.” Party spokesman Joseph Goebbels claimed in 1932 that the Nazi Party was a “workers’ party” and “on the side of labor and against finance”. According to Friedrich Hayek, writing in 1944, “whatever may have been his reasons, Hitler thought it expedient to declare in one of his public speeches as late as February 1941 that ‘basically National Socialism and Marxism are the same.’<br>  <br>  Private firms did exist and Nazi Germany, but they and all workers worked for the state. Putting the state before the rights of individuals and firms is socialism, plain and simple.

The reason why the Republican Party received bad grades the past four years is because of the peoples' disagreement with the Bush administration. And now the newer, younger, and more conservative Republican leaders are kicking out all the older, moderate, social conservative Republican leaders who were all tied in with the Bush administration. But ever since this dominantly Democratic controlled congress has taken office it has constantly received one of the worst approval ratings in the history the the US Congress because, in the eyes of the people, they've accomplished absolutely nothing that can be considered successful. Now, this doesn't mean that the Republicans are going to dominate because there are more Republican seats up for election than Democrat seats, so the Dems have a slight advantage. But with how low congress's approval rating is, the Republicans can actually gain a bunch of seats. Illinois is usually a Democrat safe haven. But there is no way the Democrats will win most of the Illinois elections in 2010 because of how much controversy is plaguing the Illinois Democratic Party. The IDP actually has a lower approval rating than the US congress. So that one state right there can take a sharp turn into Republican control.<br>  **************************************...<br>  Thanks for the response. It's not popular for questioners to respond back to their posters. We all appreciate it.<br>  <br>  But I disagree with you there. What the Republicans seem to be doing, in my opinion, is just sitting on the bench and waiting for the Democrats to mess up somehow. There are a few Republican congressmen who have spoken out against President Obama, but we haven't heard from most of them. So how can most of the population be angry with the party by not working with the president?... I don't consider that a bad strategy. Because after they just suffered one of their worst defeats in the history of the party they need to sit aside, wait until the Democrats make a mistake, and quietly rebuild their conservative base which they're actually doing a pretty good job at that right now.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty much as conservative as one can get. So I am excited to see the socials being kicked out of the Republican Party. Plus, think about it, when the Republicans stood completely for conservatism it was somehow easier for both major parties to work with each other. Once the Republicans tried to turn moderate in the 90's, that's when the government got worse at getting things done.<br>  <br>  Although I think it's a good strategy for the Republicans to sit on the sideline for now, it does disappoint me to see that the Republicans are putting more attention into rebuilding their party than trying to give a conservative voice in the government.<br>  <br>  As far as the reason why the American people are still not too fond of the Republican Party, I still feel it's because of the Bush administration. Otherwise, why else are the Republicans trying to keep quiet right now?... I dunno. That's just my opinion. But the 2010 elections are going to be exciting. My prediction is that the Republicans will pick up a few more seats but in the end the Dems will still control congress.|`|NwBfuUNaaa	The simple answer, YES<br>  They are on a path of More DOOM, keep in mind I predicted the DEM gains in the Senate, at 100% correct, the electoral college count, I said 364 and there were 365 for Obama. <br>  So I know a little bit about what I am talking about. They are alienating The Independents by their obstructive behavior, criticism without any alternative solutions. Also, by identifying Rush Limbaugh as there leader, it is turning off Independents and they can't win an election without them.|`|vFGojyBHaa	It's too  early to make predictions based on polls but based on the direction of the economy and the ill-fated stimulus bill along with the omnibus porker...get ready for a shift to root out all incumbents.  If that holds true, the Congress will shift back to the Republicans in 2010.|`|98EXXItdaa	It's unlikely.  Look at what Obama and his lackeys have done to our economy, they aren't going to be able to escape that in the next election.  Look for a pretty substantial loss by Democrats if there isn't an amazing shift in the economy in the next year and a half.|`|OEhH9hcvaa	GOP screwed itself and if they don't change their mentality<br>  even a dog won't vote for them anymore of course with the exception the rednecks will keep voting for them by calling the rest of the country a bunch of terrorirsts...<br>  <br>  but American people don't really pay attention to the rednecks|`|fAp3YMfmaa	I think congress could do wihout republicans. Except Ron Paul.<br>  <br>  He is so sexy, I want to make love to his scalp.|`|Un3YxFvRaa	The Conservative people will get elected... obama has lied and lied and lied and people like pelosi are a joke..even in her home state...|`|UqLEMXAgaa	I hope so.<br>  I don't want to go back to dog eat dog America.<br>  I want something more Humane.|`|9PoGLVmXaa	They won't lose seats if Osama and Pelosi keep their present trend.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Oh no not at all. They'll be gaining maybe even as much as they did back in 94.<br>  The Dems blow every opportunity they have of keeping control by wasteful spending and higher taxation.
6AgnCKCPaa	Nope, for obvious reasons..|`|9qKAy0dlaa	Not really that bad, there's always a way for things to work out. Let's say that Alqaida or Iran will get into Iraq and take possession of it politically or by force. Then we have the door open to go kick some ***. No one needs to lie about WMD or anything and the end would be a reflection of the means. If that doesn't happen then the means justified the end for those who support those means.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Doesn't really matter.  The job there is done and we stand to gain nothing from staying.  We are in the process of redefining the war on terror and moving to afghanistan.  With the economic crisis that the United States is in right now we can't really afford to fight to large ground campaigns.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	As much as I DON'T LIKE OBAMA, the agreement with Iraq to withdraw the troops was already in place by the Bush administration, it was signed warly last year. Obama will pull them out a few month earlier than tht to be able to say, look what I did I pulled them out!|`|CE4hcUmhaa	It was "smart" politically, and by smart, I mean fashionable, not intelligent.<br>  <br>  By announcing a date, he hopes that the insurgents will reduce their activities waiting for the withdrawal of US troops, making him look good, but the violence will escalate once the US has withdrawn.  Plus, he is hoping that this announcement will be construed as him fulfilling a campaign promise.<br>  <br>  He could have announced that the troops would be withdrawn and the date/time frame would be withheld because of security concerns, which is what a strategic thinker would do, rather than a career politician who can only think in a short term, tactical sense.|`|qvuQSQvpaa	cuz they cant do nothin about it either way. MOST of the ppl over there want 2 be free of america and ESPECIALLY free of al queda and any other terrorists. so they gon be happier and fight even harder to keep what they gained when america leaves|`|m8EalLc6aa	I think non Violence is always paramount to fear and intimidation. If you think this pointless war is worth it then you are mistaken.|`|djUMvICoaa	It's about as smart as it would have been to have told Hillary Clinton that she was going to lose back in 2007.|`|XVxH0FFAaa	nothing Obama says is smart!|`|9ee484e9e095465dc08ec9cbd5f90786aa	who say if Obma is smart. I don't think they teach common<br>   sense where he went to school.|`|hKMFiG6Vaa	I don't think anything Obama is doing is smart.|`|WA8y0JAMaa	the word smart and obama cant be used in the same sentence|`|5YTkGB5yaa	No but at least he's keeping 50,000 troops there.|`|95gEZ22Caa	No lets stay forever!!!!

Typical Repub.|`|pYRZcfsJaa	do any of you libs know why Rush said "I hope he fails"? a little something called ratings, he knew that is he said that he would get loads of attention and more people would start listening to him... and oh look, it worked.<br>  <br>  and all you libs take it personally like he is a politicain or something... you all need to calm down.|`|GNNh52OMaa	someone who is a talk radio host that seems off his rocker gets this much attention, i'd say there is fear amongst the opposing faction. <br>  <br>  what are you dems worried about if rush is a failure?|`|GqTSa85daa	So you say.  Rush is a true American, unlike the left wing liberals.|`|ypSp9ieKaa	the democrats have a new boogeyman. It makes me smile a little on the inside to know that people like you fear him so much.<br>  <br>  and by the way, tell which Republicans have identified him as the new face of the GOP. Its the liberals that are cooking this one up, and its hilarious|`|89239f44272f2582fcdd0bed556489b2aa	He can't seem to control his mouth either. Frankly, I don't understand why he has so many loyal followers. It makes you wonder about their intelligence. I used to listen to him on ocassion, but even though I agreed with some of his objecitves, his arguments were so riddled with falsehoods that I didn't think he had any credibility. His entire line of reasoning can be summed up with "Republican good! Democrat bad!". The world is a lot more complicated than that.|`|AYH0RPsjaa	Oh really your blow salesman did pretty well for himself AND he had plenty of terrorist pals too!<br>  <br>  I don't need Rush in 2012- I need Cheney Bush 2012.|`|AA11775172	Of course they will, he fits right in with the Republican base, fundamentalist christians, KKK and gun crazy rednecks.|`|t8JlnuqFaa	People who are afraid call others names. Don't feel bad, though, Obama is also afraid of Rush|`|NcQVQiQMaa	lol.  Yes, and Rush is making millions off these dittoheads.  Go Rush.|`|Spixxn8Gaa	I can sense your fear and weakness. It smells like KFC|`|NRVLBFmYaa	WHY are they looking to RUSH?! What about Ron Paul? What the hell is wrong with the stupid GOP leaders...dumb.|`|FKN9kBvLaa	Perfect example of their lack of intelligence and leadership.|`|AcWMpmPwaa	no, we're not following, we happen to be able to think for ourselves, but what he is doing is keeping us energized, trying to educate the repubs which need to learn how to play the lefts games, and try to convince the fence leaners the error of their ways...besides...look at yourselves, you guys can't stop talking about the guy, your obsession has turned into insanity and us conservatives are relishing this!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0918eb31ce1520001d965c6085d6abc5aa	I served over there as a Marine in infantry. I'm glad I went, and we got rid of a dictator.

Obama is just what this country needs...and pigs fly.|`|fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	Well, what's another lie, right? <br>  The successful liar is telling many lies one after another, that way it's hard to keep up with the stuff and watch it happen. And the secret is to be as evasive as possible... that will assure always a way out, and open door, for a flood of excuses.|`|8207ee7a6b82ec38c948d336e393f122aa	The guy is a schmuck. He is a puppet - like the ones we had when WE were kids where the 'man' flopped around on the stick when you pulled the string.<br>  The B has now guaranteed the deaths of many more American servicemen and given the bad guys a timeline for their next attack here.<br>  I'm sure they'll all blame GWB, though.<br>  And I love the fact that you noticed the NEW vocabulary.<br>  I call a spade a spade. Not a leaf shaped object that comes to a point with a base, black in color. How stupid are people?????|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Well, supposedly we did achieve "victory," though it's hard to say because I'm not entirely positive we know who the enemy was supposed to be.<br>  But it certainly is a novel idea that, once we have achieved our primary objective, we stop fighting and leave!|`|2CxfFENRaa	It will be just like the 90's when we were not at war with people that were at war with us.  Hence 911|`|DB9QbZoQaa	I do not know.<br>  <br>  This I do know: And be assured; He will serve His purposes.|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	Any victory in Iraq has nothing to do with Obama. He opposed the war yet boasts about the benefit of the war for the Iraqi people. He opposed the surge and yet boasts that the Iraqi people have a better life, a democratic process, and no longer are subject to a brutal regimen. His words are hollow. With 50,000 troops to remain in Iraq, it is more like downsizing the war, not ending it.|`|SahUDTLnaa	No my friend you were not wrong. God bless you.|`|jLxBvXZ5aa	No, you are not wrong.  You are brilliant, and it is the morons who do not see as clearly as many of us do with the way things are shaping up for this country, or should I say being torn down.  I would never leave<br>  a job before it was completed.<br>  All this president has is the ability to speak without saying what he really means.<br>  <br>  Carmen<br>  .|`|wbIEau0qaa	george bush... no seriously though, this war doesnt have an enemy that can be seen like the wars you mention with the previous presidents. its alot harder to obtain the victory tag. <br>  <br>  i am all for pulling our troops out, the war is costing billions, plus we can use that money to secure our borders and defense intelligence.|`|lPwdDpxgaa	I appreciate your sarcasm.  If people want a 'knife blade' here it is - Obama is a treasonous globalist puppet, hell bent on following orders to weaken the US militarily, destroy its economy, re-distribute its wealth and resources, give up its sovereignty, and cause enough strife and suffering to make the people beg for help.  Then he will deliver us, lock, stock, and barrel to the soon-coming neo-communist world governing body.  Sharp enough for you?|`|Ga3lCQTNaa	Does anyone not understand the ramifications of disclosing the time<br>  frame of Massive troop re-deployments. To the civilian I'm sure this<br>  means nothing to you. To those that are in harms way, It is an open<br>  invitation to take target practice at Troop carrier Aircraft, Convoy units,<br>  and other structured mechanized movements. This is now why when<br>  we said back months and months ago, this inexperienced empty<br>  headed suit, Would start to show his ignorance in copious ways <br>  when and if he took office.

How do you know if he did or did not consult our enemies.He went on Muslim television before he even talked to the families of the sailors killed on the U.S.S. Cole.Could the "end"of combat in Iran be the "start" of combat" here in the U.S?  After all his crony,ophs Secretary  at the Homeland Security has banned the word terrorist.This is the new list of a Obama vocabulary book sold to the masses. Or is it a playbook." A rose by any other name can only smell as sweet"Or stink like pig crap.Aren't they getting money for that too? Obama is in a league of his own,still I wonder who's league.|`|p2G5KJywaa	I figure as long as we have troops in Iraq there will be conflict. He said the other day that it would be at least Dec. 2011 (which means 2012)before we are out of there.<br>  Hows that work? <br>  <br>  Obviously he must have some pretty close ties to the other side to get intel on what they plan to do. <br>  I suppose if he can be buds with Muammar Gaddafi anything is possible.<br>  <br>  edit: No Lev... most people realize very little I'm afraid. Even when it bites them in the a&&. I'm wondering if he'll use the promise of getting troops out in his next campaign too. Assuming he's still in office. <br>  U.S. Virgin Islands sound pretty good huh? My luck it'll belong to China before I get there. Actually that sounds like a deal they might go for.

The only way for this to happen according to the belief is to bring on the Muslim equivalency of the Christian Armageddon. Hence, no peace. In fact, complete and utter destruction of those who oppose you.  America will be the last man standing. Don't take my word for it. Look at Europe. It has been Muslimized. America is next. What is scary is Obama is an appeaser with Muslim roots. Just my opinion.|`|GtazNrplaa	Daddy should have just Nuked the joint in the first time and that definitely would have saved a lot of the allies lives.

So who are you going to blame for this.|`|HizAP9Z8aa	Probably increase spending, debt, and inflation.  Transfer wealth from producers to consumers, bail out failing automakers, insurance companies, and mortgage companies.  Wait, that's what Bush did, and what Obama is doing.  Where's the change?|`|DiDCG9UBaa	McCain probably wouldn't do anything since he believes the economy is fundamentally sound.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	Unlike Obama, he wouldn't have continued the "failed Bush policy" of high spending and futile tax rebates.<br>  <br>  His economic plan, vetted and supported by economics PhDs from our foremost universities, was to make the current income tax rates permanent, reduce business tax rates, reduce capital gains tax rates, accelerate depreciation schedules, and to reduce the growth of the federal budget as much as possible, with a hawkish eye against earmarks.<br>  <br>  That was his plan. It wasn't a secret. So, what's it like asking questions and making snarky infantile remarks from a position of ignorance?|`|VSX9tzJaaa	probably pass bills asking for more money for the war. he wouldn't be worried about this country. then he'd probably be giving speeches asking if there would be any man willing to go out with his daughter since she's bi*ching that she cant get any man to give it up to her since the election.

What he said was he would bring a brigade home a month, that a small force would stay behind and that some troops would be redeployed to afghanistan. The only difference here is a 3 month difference from what he said while campaigning.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	No, you didn't listen.

If this president fails on the economy we will be looking at more than a decade of hard times. To have an arrogant commentator encourage people to seek his failure makes him a worse threat than AlQaeda. But that would be fitting, GWB told us he would pursue those that attacked us but rather allied with 3 or the 4 countries of origin of the attackers & ignored AlQaeda to invade Iraq. The man speaks for the party that helped our enemies out more than anyone else.<br>  BTW: to claim that we are doing the same thing, the same way as we did in the 30's clearly indicates that you are uninformed about the history of the 30's and what we are doing different this time.

6UPRisOiaa	You need to have a strong background in accounting, so at the least an associates or bachelor's degree in business. More than likely you would need an MBA and CPA.    With a criminal justice background, you could then easily transition to forensic accountant.  But remember, most auditors have more than a degree.  In order to audit work product, you generally have to have a great deal of experience to find "what is wrong."  <br>  <br>  I would suggest that you contact the IRS or FBI, forensic accounting divisions and set up a meeting with one of them to talk about career opportunities.  Thanks to this administration......the government may be your best opportunity for future career advancement.

3eb0DIxGaa	It will create a few jobs, but it will lose some in the profit laden insurance companies. But this is not the point at all. The Auto Industry can't get profitable until health care costs are lifted from their obligation. Most big and small business pay a high premium for health care. That cost has grown exponentially to the point that American business can't compete with foreign  business, who have government paid health care. It's a matter of levelling the playing field.|`|G2auAv1Saa	Without any private insurance companies wouldn't that loose millions of jobs? <br>  The rate a medical provider is reimbursed for government funded health care (medicare/medicaid/VA) is so much smaller than that of private insurance companies- medical providers would also be forced to make cut backs in staffing.|`|wqchA8B7aa	Perhaps, but then the Richest of the Rich, and their Republican figureheads, would lose some power and money!  Can't have that happen.|`|96e391ed38447964faf042cf980c1571aa	no.  The only jobs created would be goverment oversight ones.  The healthcare industry already has a severe shortage at all levels and anyone with a degree in any medical field could easily leave a job one day and get another the next. The medicare and medicaid system has more rules and regulations than a nuclear power plant, and there are members in the medical community that speciallize in making sure a facility complies with those regulations. (and the paperwork that goes with it).|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	No, in fact it would likely eliminate some. Universal healthcare does not mean expanded healthcare or an increase in quality of health care. It just means that those who can't pay for the service themselves will be assisted to pay for it by government. In other words, tax payers will pay for the health care of those who do not pay taxes.|`|wbIEau0qaa	it would publicized the health industry. not necessarily create more jobs|`|TxRRITveaa	sure, you would need hundreds of thousands of beaurocrats to run it.|`|cdfaf090d61b4780b0e9991dfb477d46aa	Well if you are talking about a goverment ran and regulated system, then it would create a bunch of goverment jobs, while a bunch of private sector jobs of the same type would be lost.<br>  Medicare/Medicaid (ya know the govermental healthcare program that we do have already) is one of the most mismanaged programs out there with tons of money unaccounted for annually and its going bankrupt.|`|3caq6SFxaa	Probably not in the long term or even anything besides very short term and most of those jobs would be government jobs tracking reports.  One thing or way it kept being talked about to save money is through administrative efficiency-what that means is you save money by doing the paperwork better, consolidating (possibly) and going to standards forms making things process faster and easier.  The big cost savings there is you use less people to do that so actually jobs would be lost not gained.  You might have more nurses or doctors but even if that happened it would be a very small number compared to the administrative losses.  At the very start you would or could need temporary help to get things together and standardize things but that would be just that short term and temporary.  If you keep the people on the payroll to "save jobs" after that then you have no cost savings.  What it really could represent if you go full blown nationalization is a decrease in private sector jobs and a smaller increase in government jobs-less working taxpayers supporting more tax paid employees.|`|8Zpmm22raa	It would loose jobs,,,,,the private  doctors would have to take a pay cut and say forget it.<br>  <br>  Now a giant new government bureaucracy would be invented with 10 chiefs for each worker, with plenty of useless government jobs.<br>  <br>  Name one program, or department the government runs, that is efficient, and up to date, with great customer service?<br>  <br>  How is that DMV office workin out for you?|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	It will create some jobs in a bureaucracy controlling your health, and eliminate other jobs (private insurance jobs, etc).

1oxBCtmZaa	It's not so much a matter of pushing costs on to customers (cost-push inflation doesn't really exist, technically speaking) or, at least with incremental increases, the incentive to bake more bread (i.e., the idea that small business owners will decide not to grow the company because the return on the investment will just be taxed away - though if we were to go back to Carter-era tax levels, yes, incentive would again become relevant as it was then).<br>  <br>  The issue is that all equity is retained after tax earnings.     What you save in taxes on last year's income is a component of what's available to reinvest this year.   Thus, income taxes come directly at the expense of investment of real equity in the private economy.   That is how tax hikes cost jobs: there is less capital to invest, thus banks (which lend at a ratio to capital) will lend less to the business, thus there will be less investment - i.e., fewer jobs at the bakery, at the flour manufacturer, at the wheat farm, at all the companies providing farm inputs such as tractors and fertilizer.<br>  <br>  The dollar the Dems want to take from me to funnel through a bureaucracy to give, six months down the road, about a quarter to some guy who loses his job when Timken cancels its second shift, is a dollar I'd have spent on something with a ball-bearing in it.|`|AA11530144	Welcome to the real world your taxes are going to get higher and higher you squandered your chance (greed ethic)|`|7EkeIcw4aa	I think this question is too hard for liberals to understand.

k8ivyYfaaa	You should shred all debt/credit card receipts and anything with an account number on it, like bills.  If you have paper recycling like I do, then take that shredded paper and put it in the recycling; fewer people are likely to rifle through that recycling to find personal information.<br>  <br>  So there's 2 answers to this question:<br>  <br>  1- If the garbage can is on private property, you can be charged with trespassing if you 'dumpster dive'.  However, for example, if you live in an apartment complex and you go into the big dumpster FOR the complex, you will not, because you live on the property.  <br>  2- If the garbage can is one like the big, green 'Waste Management' dumpster, there are some states where the content of what's in that dumpster is 'owned' by Waste Management, so by going through it, you can be charged with trespassing.<br>  <br>  If someone is going through your garbage on your property (the street is not your property and in many states, grass and driveway between the sidewalk and the street is not either), you should call the police.  If it is not on your property (like if you left it for the trash man in the two places I listed above), then it's in public property and you don't have any recourse.|`|AA11779483	once you throw something out, you are relinquishing your claim on it, and it is fair game.  as long as someone isn't also trespassing to get to it--like its on the side of the street--it belongs to whoever wants to pick it up.|`|VEi3R0craa	I don't know the law on this and if I was you I would call your local police station to see if there is a law against that.

What percentage of successful African Americans agree with Rush?<br>  <br>  Steele confronted Rush- quite rightfully, in my opinion. And then Steele found out the limits of the present Republican party and how far he could go. Looks like Steele will have to scale down his plans. <br>  <br>  What would be cool is if Rush made Steele a guest of honor on his show- but that would be helping Steele and Rush seems to have plans of his own...|`|7de370467c1bd78c2289f9e195b0bb85aa	DONAVAN MCNABB IS OVERRATED AS A QB.

9XJLlPaEaa	No, that's what alcohol is for.|`|FByiwAk2aa	No, not at the age of 18. Cannabis should be legalized but the gov't should regulate it and control it as they do with Alcohol. Tax it, grow it, regulate it, and reap the benefits!<br>  <br>  Marijuana has been classified as a class 1 drug putting it in the same category as Cake, Meth, and Crack among the list. Evidence and SCIENTIFIC studies have shown that Marijuana is beneficial for many medical ailments and further, Marijuana has far less negative health and side effects than Alcohol and Tobacco. <br>  <br>  Further studies have shown that Marijuana does not contain any treats of addictiveness nor has Marijuana been associate as a direct cause of death. However, Alcohol abuse and consumption continues to be a growing  problem among adults and teens and is the leader is vehicular deaths. <br>  <br>  Most people who are opponents of the legalization of Cannabis are opponents because they lack they education and understanding of the benefits. Since the gov't made Cannabis illegal in 1937, they've done so by marketing untruths and untested and non-scientific beliefs that Marijuana will cause the user to go crazy, loose memory, or even death. The gov't further marketed against Cannabis with billboards and articles depicting a "white woman with terror on her face being chased by a black man" stating that when "****** smoke reefer, they become animals and wrap and attack white woman." Not only is this the dumbest thing I've ever heard, but over 60% of the US population has tried Marijuana and I certainly don't believe that 60% of our population is crazy. Of course marketing campaigns like this were done during the 40's and 50's when America was in it racial stage. <br>  <br>  But first, for you uneducated folks out there who are against Cannabis. You must educate yourselves as to why Cannabis was made illegal in the first place. <br>  <br>  Cannabis prohibition was started with the help of the Pharmaceutical companies, Petroleum companies, and William Randolph Hearst....yes the same William Randolph Hearst of the famous Hearst Castle located in San Simeon, Ca. Pharmaceutical companies did not like the idea of cannabis steeping into their cash flow and causing competition in the drug market. With that said, Marijuana has been used for medical ailments for centuries and many believe was started by the early Chinese Dynasties. Petroleum companies didn't like Cannabis because at the time, Hemp oil was a direct competitor to Petroleum products for in home heating. Not only was Hemp oil a cheap alternative to oil, it also was more efficient and can be used to make other fuels.....such as the gas you put in your car and it burns cleaner than petroleum based products. Hearst lead the charge and at the time he was one of the wealthiest men in the world. At this time, Hearst also owned and made most of his fortunes in his paper mills. Because hemp is a cheaper alternative to making paper than trees, Hearst believed that his paper mills would go under. Why did all this entities detest Marijuana....simply because it is a weed and can be grown just about anywhere. Not only can Cannabis be grown easily, it is less detrimental to the earth than normal crops such as corn or cotton. Further, at the time it was nearly impossible for the gov't to regulate Cannabis.<br>  <br>  Lets face it, if Cannabis is made legal the black market dies, the gov't reaps the tax dollars, and in turn the US citizens reap the benefits of having additional tax funding for education and law enforcement. Just because Cannabis might become legal does not mean that everyone will grow it. It takes time and a tone of care to grow quality Marijuana and costs to build a simply grow room can reach thousands of dollars. Americans are lazy, we won't take the time or spend the money to grow Marijuana if we can walk down and spend a few bucks on enough to have a nice time! Also keep in mind that you can make you own alcohol and beer right in your own home and the gov't allows so much to be made, however it is time consuming and fairly expensive to maintain and make....so once again a typical American would rather drive a mile or so to a store and pick up a 12 pack. Also keep in mind that Meth can be made in your home with typical household products.<br>  <br>  Really what you have to do is way the positives and negatives and if you do so after you educate yourself you will find that Marijuana should be legal.<br>  <br>  This topic can go on and on and on. But the bottom line is that if you take a pain med like Darvicete you would actually be better of smoking a spliff to relieve the pain by simply looking at the side effects of a perfectly legal prescription drug. The same goes if you take a muscle relaxer like Flexirol or Valium. The worse side effect many will see from Marijuana is a serious case of the munchies.....but you will love everyone. This doesn't mean that Marijuana is for everyone because everyone is different. But not everyone drinks or smokes either. Oh and lets point out that you don't have to smoke Cannabis<br>  <br>  Oh and I shouldn't forget to point out that the FDA, yes the Food and Drug Administration, the same FDA that is funded by the US gov't and its tax payers does not test the prescription drugs out on the market. In fact most prescription drugs are released to the market in a "test" phase and the FDA only steps in and begins making tests when a number of complaints and issues arise. The only thing the FDA requires is that the drug companies make the public aware of the side effects one may acquire while taking the drug! Hmmm, wow, that is gov't regulation at its finest.|`|Ipq6Bvh3aa	Making drugs illegal has only negative affects:<br>  <br>  It increases the demand for alcohol<br>  It provides a source of income to illegal enterprises<br>  It gives the government a means of disenfranchising and imprisoning the poor;<br>  it destabilizes poor Latin American countries; <br>  It wastes large amounts of money in enforcement activities;<br>  It causes otherwise law abiding citizens to hate the police; and<br>  it provides a scapegoat for society's ills|`|03rOCajTaa	well you can go to the netherlands and smoke it ...its legal there<br>  I'm against it b/c it does damage to the brain...if they says it doesn't any more then smoke up I guess<br>  I still wouldnt't I think smoking anything is gross...but that is just me.|`|b844256a273aaed20dd13e0a5e4a82b0aa	No, only for people who need them medically.<br>  <br>  The rest of the people should be punished severely.|`|RRxlVNHQaa	yes!<br>  weed is an erb not drug.!<br>  smoke1 *****

t3QAaSN9aa	I don't care what a president's religious beliefs, or lack thereof, are. The important concept is to maintain the separation between religion and government so that it wouldn't matter at all what a president believed as far as religious matters because it would be wholly irrelevant.|`|f9crUDTwaa	What makes you think this country hasn't already had an atheist president . I wouldn't expect that every president has been honest about their religious affiliation . We all know that an openly atheistic person would never get elected any more than an openly homosexual person ...|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Atheist, no. Agnostic, yes. There's a big difference. An atheist believes that there is no god. An agnostic doesn't subscribe to any particular religion or give any religion more credibility than any other. In other words, they are not afraid to say they don't know.<br>  <br>  One could argue that atheism is a religion in itself. But, being agnostic means that you are not influenced by any religious beliefs, not even the belief in no religion.|`|6UPRisOiaa	Again, it is not just the professed faith of a leader, but the associated (or perceived) value system that goes with that faith.  People can speak to following the tenets of a particular religion but be in practice make policy that stands in opposition to those tenets. (ex. Pelosi, Kennedy, Reid).  So it is more than just a profession of faith that is desirable to most voters.  It is also someone who might appear to uphold the tenets of that faith.  (Though we have seen that leaders of the past talk out both sides of their mouth in faith matters just as in all matters.

I don't know how this religion thing first started, or why humans created images of these Gods, good and bad, but, I think it was a way of controlling the masses!  I don't see anything wrong with having a President who is NOT bent by Religion. Maybe we should all believe in only what we can see!|`|01e7be90a0bc3f8793113187512fc895aa	This will never happen. Do you remember Obama's swearing in? When the oath was a little screwed up and then they posted pictures of Obama saying the oath later without his hand on the bible?<br>  <br>  People went ape-****. They started freaking out and I was in 20 arguments that DAY about Obama's religious standing.<br>  <br>  Obviously, any logical person would understand that religion, having no place in government, shouldn't matter.

That was his mistake. McCain lost because he was a moderate too.|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	It's very simple. The only defense of the indefensible is to lay blame elsewhere and provide  a scapegoat. It's the American-political way. (ust ask Scooter Libby, or Oliver North ;)<br>  <br>  Right now, the GOP is in disarray. It would be more injurious to them to deflect blame or scorn to an "active" GOP'R. (Just ask Jindal.) <br>  <br>  So, who are you going to lay blame for your troubles on?? The guy who's gone, out of office, mending fences in Crawford....<br>  The GOP has run out of answers, so they rely on the same, time-worn "fear and smear". Now, they smear GW.  I think it's very interesting they are turning it inward at their own party now, though. But, that's just because I'm a liberal. ;)<br>  I'd be very surprised if the GOP can muster the cooperation and support to run an effective campaign fo rat least a couple of elections.....I can't wait for the "Palin/Limbaugh" ticket.

We've been making those criticisms of Bush for YEARS now.|`|YupMCYHlaa	The GOP is in trouble and they know it.  They don't like to talk about it, but they sure know it.  They know they need to come up with a new image for the party, a new face, for 2012.  The problem is that they're split between those who think GW Bush went too far and those who don't think he went far enough. Those who think they need to work even harder to undo the New Deal, and those who think we ought to just live with the New Deal.<br>  <br>  I wish she'd asked Norquist what he thought of Reagan.  Bush was only following Reagan's lead.  They both talked about tax cuts for everyone but really only used them to concentrate wealth.  They both promised that balancing the budget would be their highest priority, but once in office behaved as if debt simply didn't matter.  Both made the govt. significantly bigger and more expensive, and both made us less free.  Both believed govt. regulation of business was just evil, just as a principle, and pursued the wildest, most imprudent deregulation schemes.  Both ran corrupt administrations with officials who believed the laws didn't apply to them.  And both used 'plausible deniability' to pretend they didn't know what their staff were up to.<br>  <br>  But I give Norquist credit for seeing the elephant in the room.  None of the other Republicans have the guts to criticize President Bush, because that's an admission of the failure of Movement Conservatism.|`|R7Hexutqaa	That's pretty far under the bus.    But the change people want is not reduced spending and reduced taxes (those are always welcome, however)  <br>  <br>  What they want is responsible government working to solve problems and a prudently regulated business climate to prevent the kind of problems we are having now.  The Republicans don't believe government should do these things.  That's why they lost ground.|`|hIuWPD3xaa	As I was watching Jindhal trying to distance himself from Bush in one breath and promoting the very same conservative Republican policies in the next, I couldn't help but dream of future campaigns when Democrats are going to be able to show these clowns side by side with Bush spouting the VERY SAME NONSENSE, including promises of rosy outcomes for the country!!!!|`|HZy629kLaa	I'm surprised they didn't burn him in effigy at CPAC he was such a bad word.<br>  <br>  BTW, Norquist was yelling that whole interview.

People blame Bush as it is anyhow, so there's no effort on our part to back any of this up. Obviously he masterminded the whole thing himself, as he is a genious, and we had no part in this ourselves. We simply stood by and watched in dismay, doing nothing to stop it.

It is considered a form of murder (at least, "manslaughter") in most places.<br>  <br>  The term "Slippery Slope" refers to the argument against euthanasia. First, you kill only those suffering from terminal illness, and then people with less than terminal illness but who are in constant pain; and then you start offering it to people who are merely depressed.<br>  <br>  The argument is, that once you say it's okay to take someone's life because of a qualitative state, then where do you draw the line>|`|PBq7ODPzaa	It isn't unconstitutional but is against state statutes and may be against US code.

WKvl8zlCaa	As long as they don't contain any racist remarks or outright lies and insults, then go right ahead and ask a question, or give an answer. Too many of the postings on here about President Obama, are just angry white children ,regurgitating the vile filth that they hear at home or school. The reason so many republican whites voted for Obama, was because they are tired of the xenophobic elements of the Republican party.  Here in WA state, Obama won because of a LARGE  number of "cross-over" white republican voters voted for him.  Why? Because the Republican party is fading from power ! When "W" stole the elections, it left no clear transfer of power from the incumbent, to the republican candidate. Then there was the republican primaries.  There was no candidate that 'fought' his way to the top.  It was just a fuster cluck to the BOTTOM ! McCain was just the LAST one to sink to the bottom, and that put him at the top of the heap AT THE BOTTOM !  There is no unity in the Republican party.  All that is left is bickering,confusion, and nasty attacks on President Obama.  As long as the 'right' keep attacking President Obama with smears and fears, they will continue to fade from power !|`|ErTVzpUUaa	Somewhat, but I couldn't get any posted about Pelosi last week after Obamas address to the nation!

If you get a certified job offer approved by Service Canada, you may apply for Provincial Nominee immigration without having to qualify by points, that is at least in BC and AB you can, possibly also in MB and SK.  That would give you permanent residency.

They have a test online which will tell you whether you might have enough points to apply for immigration.  Having enough points to be allowed to submit an application does not mean it will be approved.<br>  <br>  If you can find a job, an employer can apply for a temporary employment visa for you.  Do you have a degree and expertise in a field where Canada is short of qualified workers?  They do need (last I checked) experienced mining engineers who are graduates of top-rated Schools of Mines (preferably with masters) in mining engineering.  The jobs are north of Yellowknife, Northern Territories.  <br>  <br>  They really don't need much else as Canada has excellent schools & universities.  If you were thinking of casino employment or other low-level jobs, forget it as they have a serious glut of such workers in a very depressed market.  <br>  <br>  There is a worldwide glut of employees  -- of an estimated BILLION people! -- at almost every level.  There is a glut of some 20+ million US citizens in the US alone.  Not counting all the employment visa holders, illegal aliens, etc.

They did it; who else is there to blame. <br>  <br>  As for the Obama Administration, how can we judge that it's making the economy worse?  It was already in freefall mode.  He's only been in office 6 weeks.  We need a little more time than that to judge its success or failure.|`|K71Qoakwaa	Their approach to fixing it is not making it worse.  So far it's prevented it from getting even worse that it has.  It will take time for ti to actually get better-- that's how bad it is.<br>  <br>  It's Bush's fault since he was in charge.  And it's the GOP's fault, since it's the ultimate result of their no-regulation obsession.|`|qHg0c9r4aa	Maybe for the vast amounts of money spent on a war that should have never happen, that didn't exactly help.

7Wj0KW6Aaa	You can ask for supervised visits, but keep in mind they're a bit of a joke. Anyway, how are you supposed to decide who gets to supervise? It certainly can't be any family member or family friend. No police officer will want to take time to "babysit" a "mother". The detailed records are great! Make sure you continue to keep them. The letter from your step daughter should go to the guardian ad litem. He is there for the children and should have all the reports and information on what the children feel. He should have been able to talk to them in private about what they want, if they're old enough for that. You need to go to this meeting with a calm head, but more importantly you need to know the key points on which you WILL NOT budge. You need to have a plan, an idea of what you want out of this. Likely she will not be very cooperative so don't lose your temper. I think that you should ask for the supervised visits, but be understanding if they bring up the difficulty of granting such a thing. If they say that they don't want to go the supervised route, then ask that the mother have less visitation with the children or no visitation until she can grow up. It is doubtful that she will lose ALL visitation because that is the most base right a parent can have and no court wants to go that far in most cases. I hope all works out for you, good luck!|`|OBT3C4zHaa	My parents just recently went through this. You basically just try to talk things out and try to meet each other half way on a plan. You will be able to bring up supervised visits. I would be careful bringing up the letter that your step daughter wrote because your husband's or husband's ex's attorney will probably try to say your getting the kids involved or that you even wrote the letter for her.<br>  <br>  In my parents divorce, I wrote a letter and gave it to my mom, she took it into mediation but it wasn't even considered because my dad's attorney said I wasn't smart enough to write it and that the kids shouldn't have any say at all.<br>  <br>  Supervised visits are kind of hard to be granted because the courts don't want to put such harsh limitations on parents visiting their kids unless absolutely necessary. My dad drove drunk with my 12 year old sister in the car and he picked me up from places drunk. The courts wouldn't believe it. It's very hard to prove things in divorce cases. Like you, my mom has EVERYTHING written down that my dad has done wrong and his terrible new girlfriend. It didn't help us much because it's really just hearsay. Things such as police reports will hold up better but don't go calling the cops over everything because the attorney will use that against you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, these things are difficult.|`|9d3779e08741de60c8b3afd027f91e1eaa	Mediation is all about bargaining.  There is no judge here who will set the law.  If you bring up something she did that you disliked, you can bet she will bring up something dumb that she disliked.. "too much sugar" or something dumb.<br>  <br>  The best way to go in mediation is never to give up something for free. If she wants some visitation, then you say "ill give you this if you give me that."  <br>  <br>  Every major negotiator does that and it works, so try it out.

One stops their, while the other cultivates, weeds, waters and protects it from insects.  Harvest comes around and the first farmer has a meager yield of sickly fruits.

Under Obama  The second farmer will have all his food taken and distributed to the others who didn't work for it.  So in the second year the second farmer doesn't work so hard and everybody starved.  End of Lesson.  You should get what you earn.<br>  Next point... when you work with a company (people gathered together to make money), you are joining a team.

Man, as soon as Obama started talking, you liberals raised him up and made him president. No vetting process, no Idea of what his political persuasion really is. You people believed him from day one. Well, Rush is definitely a political powerhouse, he is also an honest, genuine human being. He has a better grasp on the political process, and is more knowledgeable of the operations of our government than Obama could ever dream of.

QlrIUIfOaa	Reagan and W proposed tax cuts as the cure for everything.  How did that work out?<br>  <br>  No, tax cuts will simply enrich the already wealthy and fix nothing - in fact, if history is the guide, they end up making things worse.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Amazing the lies that show up in this section.  Clinton brought us to a surplus and we had the best years in memory.  Bush never expanded the economy: he borrowed and spent.  Can a family temporarily increase their standard of living by borrowing against next years income?  Of course.  But eventually you have to pay back what you borrowed and your standard of living crashes.  <br>  <br>  Eventually is now.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	Although the Bush Administration did encourage home ownership, it was the deregulation of banks and the stock market that allowed them to make fraudulent loans which they had no intention of keeping to maturity.  Instead, under the new "rules" (read, lack of rules), they bundled the loans and sold them as stock.  In addition, the loans were made without any regard for the real value of the property. Because there was no established value to the stocks, those who bought them and traded them were trading in more of the imaginary money on which this country has been run for the last 30 years.  Outsourcing has been going on for a lot longer than the Bush administration, but they did nothing to stem it.  In addition, they did nothing about the desire for companies to not only outsource but to hire illegal aliens as a work force.  But they probably won't acknowledge the role the Fed played in things, with Greenspan keeping the interest rates artificially low to stimulate the economy.  <br>  <br>  No, tax cuts will not save the economy.  They have in fact contributed to the explosive growth of the deficit.  Bush got three tax cuts passed in his first year in office, yet the deficit continued to grow throughout his administration.  This allowed the economy to grow for about five of his eight years, but the bill started coming due a couple of years ago, and now we can see how well tax cuts work.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	There is too much misinformation in your post. <br>  <br>  I suggest you educate yourself properly regarding the issues you addressed before it is too late and Obama puts America into a major depression with his reckless spending spree.<br>  <br>  BTW:  It was not the Bush Administration who insisted on extending home loans to unqualified and uneducated people.  <br>  <br>  It was the democratic ruled congress led by Pelosi, Reid, Frank, etc.|`|PfCga0X5aa	And they say Dems tax & spend - the GOP just spends and spends and spends with no plan to pay.<br>  <br>  You're right, without jobs, nobody can affort to buy a house.

As a legislator, he supported allowing cities and states to regulate guns on a local level.|`|FDVuAiHOaa	It's a common conservative attack point:  make the liberals look like *gasp* communists who will *gasp* take away yer guns!<br>  <br>  SSDD|`|AA11130104	socialism is defined as:<br>  # a political theory advocating state ownership of industry<br>  # an economic system based on state ownership of capital<br>  <br>  So far with Obama we have a government takeover of the financial sector and the auto industry...sounds kind of socialist to me.<br>  <br>  Obama is raising taxes on everyone (weather he admits it openly, it is what his policies will do).  This seems like government is trying to own our capital.<br>  <br>  so yes, I would say that obama is a socialist|`|Q4NFFBizaa	I dont think that Blair holt will pass but who knows. i think most people just want responsible gun owners. We don't need criminals running around the streets with guns. The Ban on assault riffles should be re-instated, I mean really do you actually need an AK47? Whats the purpose? Are you gonna join the Iraqi army? We can never have our right to bear arms taken away, but government can limit who can get them and make a process on how to get them. If it makes our society safer I am all for it. O and by the way Obama is not a socialist.|`|DiDCG9UBaa	Obama is not I socialist (I can say that since I know what socialism is). There's absolutely no type of legislation whatsoever to restrict the number of rifles you can have in your household. It's really that simple.|`|cVEHvqxEaa	No.
TgUj8tV9aa	It's up to Obama if he accepts them or not. Bush had them ordered for him when the economy was OK. It's not now and he should refuse them.|`|geOapas4aa	I do understand having multiple helicopters. You want decoys to be out there too, not just the President's helicopter, in times of distress. No matter who is in the White House, you must protect them, thus the extras. However, 28 is excessive.<br>  <br>  Why is Obama getting the blame? He's the man in the White House now and it's up to him to scale back the fleet. They haven't been produced at this point, so it's his job to trim back on this excess.|`|PfCga0X5aa	This is just a part of their "game" - they think it's a game and they had better wake up soon, or every state in the union will become "BLUE".<br>  <br>  Maybe that's what they hopin' to do.... Hmmm.|`|PXV0rXsCaa	to make the other party seem bad.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Republicans are not deep thinkers.  They will seize on anything as a basis on which to criticize Obama and they hope that people won't actually look at the facts.|`|4SLjJvcqaa	Notice McCain was all for them when he thought he'd be a passenger<br>  <br>  <br>  ROFLMAO|`|diWKJGUvaa	They're not that bright.|`|wbIEau0qaa	right wingers are ranters, they cant blame anything on Bush, so they pass alongthe blame. the answers from the right wingers, re emphasizes me|`|DB7UMkGCaa	Bush ordered those helicopters years after 9/11 (in 2005). And if Obama thinks its a waste, then he can cancel the contract (though I think the government would be sued)|`|dHjya1Yoaa	Because Obama will be using them?... Personally I don't care either way... If they were ordered months or even years ago it shouldn't be a big deal today, it should have been a big deal when they were ordered.... But I don't see why he got them from Lockheed Martin... their Helicopters suck...<br>  <br>  <br>  ADD: Wow... and we are not the deep thinkers? That is so obvious considering it seems like some of us have given a legit reason as to why they are called Obama's Helicopters... While the Dems once again result to name calling.... that is so obviously thinking deep here... :/
QlrIUIfOaa	Yes.  We must rid the US of the extremist right wing Neanderthals (apologies to a relatively intelligent sub-group).  We must admit that the only reason the R Neocon Party exists is to reduce the tax rates for the rich.  When we confront that fact, we will be able to reject them totally and move on.<br>  <br>  Perhaps my Party, the moderate Republicans, can make a comeback by embracing intelligent spending and freedom.  Nah, not gonna happen.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	Last I heard there have been no medical breakthroughs discovered through ESC research.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, last I heard (about 2 years ago) there had been over 1400 medical breakthroughs in Adult Stem Cell research...<br>  <br>  I think if you follow the money you will see why so many people support ESC.<br>  <br>  And do you really trust what comes out of Iran?  I mean, really?

pGOvVUu2aa	No checks this time. A slight increase on paychecks, and tax breaks. Last years stimulus comes out of this years tax check for most. Really screwed me up!|`|oojO4WAraa	You don't get a stimulus check.  Workers get a reduction in their federal withholding tax.|`|wbIEau0qaa	no checks, just tax breaks|`|Yb8IYQJPaa	You are gettig a $13 tax break, havn't you been paying attention.
ZNe6B9TQaa	yes. they are responsible and you can get a decent amount of compensation. Any damage to your car, home, any clean up that had to be done.  Did your car not working make you late to work.  It will be such a small amount of money compared to the grand scheme of litigationt that you will probably settle really quick.  Get a plaintiff's attorney that specializes in property damage.  You can include attorney fees in the compensation you seek, too.|`|e81f5e9fdac66f6ab45eb4396a39fb24aa	The puddle didn't just *poof* into existence around your car - you saw it - you drove through it - you made the mistake.<br>  <br>  If the construction company is at fault for creating a hazard you are equally at fault being fool enough to drive through it.|`|AA12089018	Why dont you just call your insurance company?<br>  <br>  If you do go to court, you are going to need evidence, etc.... because a judge isnt going to go on what you "believe" since you arent an expert in flooding.|`|UDaFpPp8aa	Google Glenroy Hotel, Sydney<br>  Same thing happened at the pub I worked at. Opposite was a new construction site that once commenced, water flooded the Glenroy Hotel, forced the closure of the Iron Duke Hotel and closed approx. 300m of Botany Rd which is an arterial Rd in Sydney. Everyone blamed Baseline construction. Baseline construction blamed Sydney Water and Road Transport Authority. All is still in court because millions ($$$) are owed to all sectors for loss of income and repair damages. I know it sucks but I don't think you have a chance in hell as the complaint will sit under 6 metres of 'the things to do' file. The buck will be passed on and on until you give up and stop pestering them. Every phone call will be answered, "Sorry Sir, you'll have to call"..........and on and on and on.|`|AA11622716	Your question makes sense but then you say that you drove into the puddle.  If you saw a mass of water, and drove into it, no jury in the world will find that anyone but you is at fault.  You can sue anyone you wish, for anything you wish, but if you drove into the hazard that was created by another, you are the sole cause of any damages.|`|BZMPax7Naa	Compensation for what.  It's common knowledge not to drive though standing water.  It has a tendency to stall out car engines if it gets high enough around the engine.  How do you not see a puddle approaching?  Were you on the phone?
PXV0rXsCaa	i think the ideas that you came up with are fine|`|cdfaf090d61b4780b0e9991dfb477d46aa	How about that the trade rate of the US to Canadian dollar changed and it became more expensive for someone to 'buy' the Canadian dollar.  <br>  That is one of the few redeeming things about your currency falling in value is that it tourism to your country becomes more affordable.  And when it isnt tourism drops.
JUyid5Wgaa	To make this country believe that he is for America. I find that very hard to believe since he has spent the last 20 years listening to Rev.

3oNcHdgCaa	It depends.<br>  Unless the photos show some clear proof of where the crime occurred, the cops will have no way of knowing who has proper jurisdiction.|`|3k3Urj2Qaa	yes they could use that as evidence on a case against them, it is about as smart as recording yourself during a robbery <br>  <br>  that would be pretty stupid huh ?|`|BrSDvWacaa	It would take more than pictures to prosecute someone.  You'd have to catch them with the plants or smoking the stuff.  If the photographer is a cop (or an informant who wants to prosecute) and he has samples of the product and is using the photos to back up his story there might be a case.  But, still that would only be his word against the user's.  A second cop or other corroborating witness would likely be needed to nail a conviction.  They would have to prove that the stuff in the pictures is the same stuff as in the samples and that the user had possession of the actual stuff when they witnessed it and the photos were taken.|`|RDQittNDaa	You can definitely be arrested for having a picture of yourself with a marijuana plant.  However, it would be harder to arrest someone for having a picture of them smoking marijuana because it would be harder to prove that the person was actually smoking marijuana and not something else.|`|lcNQ2w57aa	You people who live your entire life around smoking pot - you amaze me. You take pictures of yourself, youtube vidoes of yourself smoking pot, with lots of plants and then you wonder "why am I in trouble?" <br>  <br>  Apparently you're no Rhodes Scolar.|`|VdcOghmLaa	yes..... for possession of illegal drugs...
25faf33e24f40cd4a39b1314c62123a4aa	Here is a legal discription. <br>  <br>  hostile witness<br>  n. technically an "adverse witness" in a trial who is found by the judge to be hostile (adverse) to the position of the party whose attorney is questioning the witness, even though the attorney called the witness to testify on behalf of his/her client. When the attorney calling the witness finds that the answers are contrary to the legal position of his/her client or the witness becomes openly antagonistic, the attorney may request the judge to declare the witness to be "hostile" or "adverse." If the judge declares the witness to be hostile (i.e. adverse), the attorney may ask "leading" questions which suggest answers or are challenging to the testimony just as on cross examination of a witness who has testified for the opposition.<br>  See also: adverse witness leading witness
Ot7PJrddaa	As long as you don't miss a drill or annual training period because of it you have no worries.  You can't be punished by a civilian court and the military for the same offense.  Your clearance will be subject to review.|`|AA10709853	you will get into trouble with the military as well.  in fact you can pretty much guarantee you will lose your clearance.  you violated UCMJ.  you know the whole standing order thing about NOT  BREAKING THE LAW.  <br>  <br>  if you are lucky that's all that will happen.  if you are not:  AR 15 with loss of rank, loss of pay, extra duty and possibly be kicked out altogether.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Yes, you can get in trouble with the army too.  You can get an article 15 for anything punishable by civilian law enforcement.  The key is will your command find out about it.  My guess is that you shouldn't count on them not finding out.<br>  <br>  You can also lose your security clearance over it.|`|XzStbSPnaa	If you tell on yourself, your going to get nailed, If you don't tell and they find out, you'll get nailed. But, there is always the hope that they won't find out. The Military has no law when it comes to DOUBLE JEOPARDY. Keep quite and hope for the best. You'll be in the same amount of trouble but, if they don't know then your scott free.<br>  <br>  YOU CERTAINLY CAN be charged in civilian and military for the same thing. DWI for example.|`|DUtOWHARaa	Did it happen during a drill wknd?<br>  Do you already have your clearance?<br>  <br>  You should let your squad leader know what's up.<br>  <br>  If this happened on your own time that WAS NOT during a drill weekend, you will not be subject to UCMJ action.  You can possibly lose your clearance over this though, or be denied a clearance if it's still in the adjudication process.|`|O9FojdEMaa	expect trouble from your CO|`|JDAbWnJraa	Do not listen to ANYONE on here that tells you to "let someone in your unit know about it."  They are wrong and you will be simply making a fool of yourself. If it happened on your own time and you were not in uniform, then it holds no bearing on your service in the reserves. It is an underage drinking citation and is not a felony, or violent misdemeanor and will not affect your security clearance. When/if it comes time to redo your clearance, make sure you list the violation if asked and it falls within the time frame they are asking about. i.e. in the last 5 yrs... You can't and don't want to lie about it when asked, but you sure as heck don't need to be offering up anything.
dMcpULcdaa	It can take up to 45 days after the paperwork has been processed providing that your Nominee did make it through MEPS. And the same with Basic Training|`|D81XrnY9aa	When a person first enlists, it takes longer to get your money since they have to be gained into the ANG system and then forwarded to the GRAP program saying they are a member of the ANG. This will take 6-8 weeks from what I have experienced.<br>  When they leave for BMT, I have got my money 2-3 weeks afterwards everytime. I have put a few in this last year and this is what I have experienced. Great program and fun to be a part of. I paid off debts with my GRAP money and it is great to get to follow people through the process I once went through.
AA11593971	We had a similar problem many years ago. It was compounded by the fact we were afraid the dog... which was really big and mean... would hurt our pets. We ran an electric wire, such as that used along cattle fences, to where the dog usually dug. The charge wasn't enough to kill him, but it definitely got his attention. It only took one or two attempts at sticking his nose or paw under the fence and getting zapped and then he totally stopped trying to dig under ever again. You can find such fences at any farm or tractor supply store. It's perfectly legal since the wire is on your side of the fence.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	Collect all their dog crap, and while they're gone just dump it all right by their front door. If that doesn't change their attitude, then it's lawsuit time. And if you spot their dog loose in your yard, you can call your city's animal control department and have the dog removed.|`|MbrE7JLsaa	Yes. If he is damaging YOUR property, then you have the right for law suits.
X81oLqMtaa	You know the GOP is in serious trouble when they put a 14 year old up on stage at the CPAC convention to give a speech on politics.<br>  <br>  As for the interview on CNN, I missed and don't have access to Youtube.|`|5hxWSezPaa	He seems to be a very smart kid who is using the wrong shade of lipstick.

bkav003oaa	The timing is not well known, but the words are. <br>  <br>  To me the timing matters little, the words themselves are at the least irrational no matter when they were spoken.|`|kCwhs8Reaa	Because now it is an issue. The Democrats and liberal media are not disputing any of what he said. They are attacking one small fragment of an entire argument. They know what he said is true and they are worried this will effect Obama's rapport with the conservatives. They are hoping to kill is "patriotism" or credibility in the hopes that people don't pay attention to the message and the lies that Obama spreads.<br>  <br>  This just shows you how stupid the Democrats think the public are, that we couldn't figure this stuff out on our own!|`|lr74sHPLaa	who cares, im one of the 75% of reps who have never listened or payed attention to rush.<br>  <br>  looks like dem/libs are obsessed much?|`|MEReSvZeaa	I agreed with him when he said it back then, even though I WANTED to be hopeful of the Obama administration.<br>  <br>  Now that Obama has proven to be every bit the communist that Rush claimed, I still agree with Rush:  I want every single policy that Obama has laid out to fail, and I want it to fail FAST so he can pull his damn head out of his ***.|`|x12mMdApaa	Rush is correct, I agree with him!!!|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Why are you gullible?<br>  <br>  If Rush didn't support his plan before - why would he support his plan after?<br>  <br>  I hope and want Ohbama's plan of National Socialism (fascism) to fail!<br>  <br>  I want America to succeed! And so does Mr Rush.|`|Zf5gSpKnaa	I, too, want Obama to fail at implementing his socialist-lite policies.  This is far different from wanting America to fail.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	EVERYONE knows he said it.<br>  <br>  BUT people are now saying he said he wants AMERICA to fail, something he never said.|`|AA11593971	Darlin'... I know exactly what Rush said. I heard it as it was ORIGINALLY said on his show. He said that if Obama was indeed a Reagan Democrat as he has sometimes claimed, he would support him, BUT if Obama pursued his socialist policies, Rush hoped he would fail. <br>  <br>  That sentiment is no different than any of the multiple statements made against Bush's policies by Libs. They don't agree with a policy... believe it is bad for the country... and hope the President fails in implementing them.<br>  <br>  You may disagree with the stand, but there is nothing horrible (as you seem to think) with the statement.<br>  <br>  I hope this clarifies your misunderstanding.|`|AA10079277	I don't know why people missed that.  I don't thnk many people missed it when nearly the entire elected body of Democrats wanted the same exact thing for 8 straight years, wanting Bush to fail.  In fact, not only wanting, but doing everything they could help him fail.  Why would they miss one, but not the other?<br>  <br>  Perhaps it is because Rush is not an elected official, he is a talk-show host.|`|pYRZcfsJaa	maybe because he is a talk show host and not a politician...|`|tP8W6Q1Qaa	look at what Obama is doing to this economy! Its not Bush this time but Obama! Its Obama policies that are preventing the free market to correct itself so just because he and many many others want Obama's policies to fail doesn't mean they want America to fail.

Do you know how ridiculous that comment is? Seriously, sit down and think about that....wow|`|spuz7DvNaa	Have you ever met a liberal with an actual brain?<br>  <br>  <br>  Indoctrination and propaganda.

America will survive with out Obama succeeding possibly much better and safer than if he succeeds. RUSH IS A TALK RADIO PERSONA I suspect you are a serial poster and Obama's Chicago henchmen hope to use internet posting to back up their claim for using the backdoor for enacting the "fairness doctrine" nad if that happens starting 2010 the democrats can kiss their majority goodbye in the House and 2014 the Senate because Rush will put the 35 million Conservatives that did not vote last election into the voting booths in both years. The liberal do not have enough votes if the moderate and conservatives and the "BLUEDOG" democrats to beat the republicans.|`|DypTl9Zdaa	I said the same thing.  I want him to fail!  For Obama to fail means that maybe just maybe he will not ruin this entire country.  So far his achievements are disastrous and will continue to be if he is not stopped.  Get a grip.  Who cares if he said that anyway?  You Dems constantly said that about Bush.  You wanted the war to fail...you wanted Bush to fail.  Blah blah blah blah.  I'm stunned just how ignorant people are who conveniently forget this is fact.|`|uGkLRQsxaa	he explained himself the day after Obama's inauguration (Jan 21st) on Hannity's show and several times since then, your sense of time is a little off there buddy<br>  <br>  The liberal media are the ones trying to soften it up?? You got that the other way around, the liberal media are the ones twisting it to say he wants the COUNTRY to fail. yes, hes said he hopes the stimulus package fails and Obama's policies fail because they're not whats good for the country or the economy|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	There is no new interpretation. Rush Limbaugh outlined his reasons for the statement in January on his radio show. Interestingly enough I hardly ever listen to Rush, but I just happened to be listening on the day in question.

I agree I want his Carter style policies to fail, when I say I want Obama to prove me wrong, I am not saying I want his policies to work, but for him to find the way that works himself, that the free market system works, that Capitalism works (when executed with morals and respect). What Rush said at CPAC only reinforced what he said in January.

The District Attorney is usually elected or appointed, while the adas are hired.<br>  <br>  Average annual wage for state lawyers (which most DA's are) was $78,310 in 2007, but that will vary a LOT by jurisdiction. The OES lists wages by experience, but the category is ALL lawyers, so that would be skewed for your specific question.
us5rh2I5aa	Its a gamble, I had some that were like your own apartment, and some that were with 4 people.|`|IMPh53Ssaa	When I was in there were 3 to a dorm, it was OK but sometimes by room mate brought her boyfriend over at nigh and they had sex,  kept me up|`|LcAiHBsaaa	I was on Little Creek Amphib base in Virginia Beach and they were pretty nice... you shared a room with one other person and then shared a bathroom with your neighbor.  (Bathroom had your toilet and shower... so if you come home from work and have to pee like Sea Biscuit, you're outta luck! hahaha) Your room had your sink and mirror, a little refrigerator and a microwave.  Not too shabby compared to some of the barracks I've had to stay in.  You also had outside access and like a hotel room key to get into your room.<br>  <br>  Portsmouth Naval Hospital barracks were super nice... my friend that was an HM (Corpsman) had her own room, then shared a kitchenette and bathroom with her neighbor.  Much nicer than the Little Creek base...  it all depends on where you go and which are the nicest.  I'm thinking that the hospitals will probably have the nicest barracks :)

8dc5NMexaa	When the response to the requests for admissions are not timely served, then they are deemed admitted, and one can not be permitted at time of trial to introduce evidence that would controvert the deemed admission.  <br>  There is a procedure rule for filing a motion with the trial court asking to set aside the deemed admissions, and in that motion one must  specify the deemed admissions, what evidence is being offered to show why they should be set aside, that the failure to timely file the response to the requests was not due to "conscious indifference."  And further why the moving party did not file within the time period a request to the court or seek an agreement from opposing counsel for a continuance of the 30-day (usual time period for admissions request) period.  To the latter, you can state and prove that you, in good faith, relied upon the sending party that you were going to receive the documents in time so that you could comply with the requests for admission; however they arrived late outside of your control.  Produce the documents immediately to opposing counsel with a copy of your motion to the court to set aside the deemed admissions, and file the motion to set aside, obtain a hearing on the motion at a time as early as possible so that it is not close to trial date thereby losing your argument that the opposing party is not prejudiced by your motion, and then upon the hearing at which you have the burden of proof, it is within the sound discretion of the judge to sustain or deny your motion.  Verify [signed before a notary as to the information set out in the motion as being within your personal knowledge and true and correct] your motion to set aside.  In your motion to set aside, also state that the opposing party will not be prejudiced by an order sustaining your motion.  Prove at hearing the contents of your motion.  <br>  If the court denies your motion, then you have built a record upon which the appellate court may grant you relief.
NiYIPrkQaa	It depends. If you already received a notice from them saying the IRS accepted your return then it will be about 10 day's.

6OLiuM9Gaa	Don't think so... any more than it would be disrespectful to have "In God We Trust" or "E Pluribus Unum" tattooed on your body if you're not currency, or "Don't Give Up The Ship" if your name isn't John Paul Jones.<br>  <br>  It might be ill-advised to use the Marine emblem, or any other emblem or logo for that matter.<br>  <br>  But I was Navy. for 25 years... not Marines... so what do I know? ;-)|`|uurgL3oZaa	No, but it's just about as dumb as walking down the street with a tattoo that says "doctor" when you're not one.|`|QqxrVVnlaa	No, not at all. It's a Latin term that has been around for thousands of years. The USM Corps simply appropriated it because it sounds cool and groovy!|`|441GSyaMaa	Not really, it's known as the motto of the USMC, but it's latin - so it was around before the marines used it. It's also the motto for the Dutch Royal Military Academy, being formed in 1879. In fact loads of places, china Marine Corp, Hungarian government guards and even the motto for the Ukrainian city Lviv.<br>  <br>  Also, the city of Exeter in Devon, England has had the motto since 1660 and claimed for of been adopted in 1588 to signifies the loyalty to the english crown...<br>  <br>  So it's much more than the USMC slogan... if you still believe it, why not tattoo it? lol<br>  <br>  Hope I've given you more of an insight lol|`|zLUQJxJkaa	I don't think the Marines would be happy.. I know a guy that has "Semper Fidelis" engraved on the inside of his wedding band because it mean's "Always Faithful".<br>  But I don't think it'd be good to wear it or have a tattoo of it.. it's like copying a brotherhood or something.<br>  Perhaps "Molon Labe" or something like that would work?|`|968837a2f6943f22a9655689e9626ee9aa	I don't think it's disrespectful.<br>  But I do think it's rather arrogant to assume the US Marine Corps are the only ones who have this as a motto.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semper_fidelis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semper_fide...</a>|`|Ot7PJrddaa	I think so - it's so much a part of the Marine Corps that you should be a Marine to have it on you.|`|JPlVt9xYaa	It is disrespectful to have any foreign matter stuck on your body. That is to say, why would anyone want to decorate a body like a billboard? It doesn't make sense to me. As a former Marine Sergeant, I wouldn't mind if anyone or everyone used the "Always Faithful" slogan if they really meant it. I think we should all adhere to this truth. Wouldn't it be nice if we had that slogan as our own?|`|ILgk3OLOaa	When I went to boot camp and we were doing some medical stuff our first couple weeks there was a kid who had all sorts of Marine tattoos.  Keep in mind that Marines take their title as serious as cancer.  The title is earned, never given and the kid was just a puke of a recruit.  This kid mysteriously ended up getting hurt and medically discharged.  I think it will be funny to explain how he was never an actual Marine but has all these tats.  What a moron.|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	It is an honor to be a Marine, an honor one earns.  It is odd when people use our motto's who were never in the Marine Corp.|`|80f46f96ec87da284c65875f2a90422daa	Especially if you dont even spell it right.<br>   Semper Fidelis!!!|`|QIwhMrBraa	i wouldnt say so much disrespectful as it is a bit sad, sort of a marine wanna be tryin to look hard|`|AA12181502	yes especially since your spelling is incorrect! Doh!!|`|ZyBXnK6eaa	weird...........|`|mMaZi9iaaa	I don't think that it is disrespectful, at all. <br>  Semper Fidelis mean "Always Faithful" in Latin. The phrase is a motto for more things than just the Marine Corps, though that is the most widely known. There are more disrespectful things you could put on you body.<br>  If you are considering this as a tattoo, I would just advise that you think very carefully and make sure its something that you want, for the rest of your life.<br>  Good Luck!!!|`|IVEanAo0aa	I dont think Sempre Fidelis- Always Faithful would be a bad tattoo if you are not a Marine.<br>  <br>  I would however have a heartache about it if you were never in the Marines get the tattoo and then head to your local bar and tell "war stories" and how you fought so valiantly.  That would be my problem with it.  Other than that get the tattoo and where it proudly.  Not many this day and age can say they are Faithful to much of anything much less say they are Always Faithful.|`|fyWbMXOHaa	Depends on why you do it. If you are doing it to impress your boyfriend DON'T! If a Marine sees you with it they will more then likely ask because they are so tradition oriented. Now if you do it as a memorial, I do not think so. I grew up a Marine brat and when my father passed serving I did a memorial tat on my shoulder blade and it says Semper Fi daddy. I have never caught flack over it, even being Army.|`|hd1reKRuaa	Disrespectful: No.<br>  <br>  Will you get messed with if a Marine see's it: more than likely.<br>  <br>  I guess it really depends on your motive.<br>  <br>  Its alot like getting a fraternity tattoo that you were never in.|`|MfZU1UpFaa	ima poolee, leave for MCRD SD 08-03-09....yea, it would be disrespectful, not to be harsh, but you were never even in the MARINE Corps......spell it right, Semper Fidelis.......|`|NiYIPrkQaa	You have to earn that right! If Marines see you with it and ask you what unit you were in and you can't answer it will be awfully embarrassing.|`|HO5CLjvTaa	It Would Be To A Marine If Your Not A Marine.|`|qdP5WAMgaa	i wouldn't say disrespectful but weird yes!|`|s0iQ2JeYaa	its not disrespectful but its funny hahah if you see a marine i would hide it !!!!!|`|wzwUcjvhaa	Depends on were you put it Lady ...Maybe add ''reception centre''

It will make a rally or two, but then drop.  Understand that Obama wants the stock market to drop and for everyone to lose their money, because the stock market to him is Capitalism, and he is a Socialist/Marxist, so he doesn't believe in wealth, he believes that everyone should be equal...So now he comes out yesterday with that assinine remark that people should invest in the market because you can get some bargains and it is good for long term, so I say this since when has he become a stock analyst?  He detests wealth, enntrapenuralism, business, because he wants everyone to be dependent on the government from birth to death...Now that he is in the White House, has anyone seen him tighten his belt?  Don't let him fool you or anyone else, his agenda is to bring us to our knees and march us all on the road to not only Socialism but Marxism.  If he has his way, this country will not be recognizable..it will be a deep in debt third world country, with shortages, gas lines, high taxes on everything that isn't nailed down except for those who are not destitute, food shortages, unrest in the streets, increase in crime...It is not a nice scenario, but this is what we will expect.|`|JthubNIsaa	Most of the people don't have anything tied up in the stock market so what happens there has no meaning to them.

I hope he fails. What are you laughing at? See, here's the point. Everybody thinks it's outrageous to say. Look, even my staff, 'Oh, you can't do that.' Why not? Why is it any different, what's new, what is unfair about my saying I hope liberalism fails? Liberalism is our problem. Liberalism is what's gotten us dangerously close to the precipe here. Why do I want more of it? I don't care what the Drive-By story is. I would be honored if the Drive-By Media headlined me all day long: 'Limbaugh: I Hope Obama Fails.'

Look at the references here on Y!A -- how many times do you see the words fat and drug addict used in questions and answers regarding Limbaugh?|`|8EbJJ0zZaa	I can't speak for others....but I personally don't have a problem with what he says...he is entitled to his opinion(I don't agree with him, but he is free to express it)....the problem I have with Limbaugh, is the same problem I have with O'Reilly/Hannity, etc....it's not what they are saying...it's how they say it.....they're just a**holes....who never let a dissenting opinion get a word in....there are ways to disagree without being disagreeable.|`|DLvHWOo7aa	His opinions are personal . . .|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	His biggest critics don't have the balls to debate him one-on-one on the issues.|`|mkCjcG5oaa	I think his assertion that if Obama lowered the capital gains tax it would be the gateway for all wealth and economic prosperity on Wall Street is total bs.  It's a small component of the financial markets that basically benefits the Warren Buffet level income investors only.  They do a lot of investing though so he does have a point but, if you think that someone with that kind of cash is holding off on investing in say GM, because they want less tax on their investment return, then I think you're lost in the forest of details.<br>  <br>  At any point it is a complete lie as well.  George Bush signed a reduction of the capital gains tax to 5% into law until 2010 before he left office.  As usual, Rush is out in left field.  Would you rather have to defend his blatent lying or the fact that he is a belligerent weiner?|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	They don't have anything else to attack him for...except one misquoted statement designed to cal out the attack dogs.

But they aren't laughing....|`|ErTVzpUUaa	I asked a somewhat similar question yesterday, it seems like the liberals can only make mean, jr. high comment about Rush, or comment on his past transgressions!

tCZnLNoaaa	Limbaugh is addicted to cheese burgers.  Obama was never addicted to Pot.  He tried it a couple of times just like most people do.  Limbaugh hid his addiction for years while he ridiculed people for their drug use.  To me that make Rush worse.  It's like if he were to  put people down for over eating.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Rush stopped.<br>  <br>  Ohbama still enjoys an occasional Blunt.<br>  <br>  The proof? He remember his lines. He had to use a tele-prompter the other day to introduce a nominee.|`|AA10264185	A lot depends on when the drug use happened and whether or not it is still going on. The major difference between Rush and Barrack is that Limbaugh has called drug users scumbags and advocated putting them in jail. That makes him a hypocrite. Blaming drug use on addiction to pain killers rather than being a recreational user is a weak rationalization. As they say in narcotics anonymous, "a drug is a drug".|`|bef202d85afc8aa7378d77f3bc4fd7e8aa	I heard President Obama admitted to smoking pot in the past. I suppose that. It's psycho-active influence can open ones mind if used properly.<br>  <br>  Rush's addiction showed he has a deep weakness within him.<br>  I saw this on Yahoo News:<br>  "In 2006, after years of pain killer addiction, Limbaugh was charged with "doctor shopping" for prescriptions.

Was in the Boy Scouts but never got a single merit badge."<br>  <br>  Here's another Rush Fact: he said,<br>  "Take that bone out of your nose and call me back." <br>  - to an African American caller, while hosting a Top 40 music program under the name Jeff Christie in the 1970s|`|75GcSkF6aa	Rush's was recent<br>  <br>  people that get addicted don't use the drugs to cure their pain all the time<br>  <br>  they abuse them because they are addicted<br>  <br>  doctor shopping, multiple doctors giving prescriptions......sound like a drug user to me|`|AA10079277	Limbaugh got his illegally from legal channels.

wCdfMZdFaa	Well, UK banks are regulated by the FSA which is an institution set up to enact European Union directives governing the banks.<br>  <br>  The particular piece of legislation in question comes from the Basel2 convention on banking and enacted via the EU under the uise of directives.  Specifically the rule called mark to market whereby banks can only lend out as much as their assets are valued on the securities market.<br>  <br>  Since bundles of mortgages count as assets the banks were considered to be worth quite a bit as they have lots of them.<br>  Banks can increase their asset protfolio and subsequently their worth by buying bundles of mortgages (mortgage backed securities) on the stock market.<br>  <br>  But some bundles of mortgages were rated as being performing assets ie the people who owed money were paying on time when in reality they were not.  <br>  <br>  When this was discovered by the US Securities Exchange Commission there was a panic and traders stopped trading in Mortage backed securities and so the market price for MBS's was buger all.<br>  So the banks became over valued and overnight suddenly found themselves having lent out more than they were worth.<br>  So they stopped lending to each other and subsequently to us.<br>  <br>  What we should have had is "mark to model" where banks could lend up to their asset worth based on a less arbitrary valuation system.  The US chaned form Mark to Market to Mark to Model in the first bailout bill in September last year.  We should have done likewise but Gordon Brown cannot chane the rules on banking.  He has to pursuade the council of ministers in the EU to recommend to the commission that they modify the directives.  That requires agreement form all 27 members and would take many months, if not years.  Just look at the attempts to modify the Common Agricultural Policy.<br>  <br>  The sad fact is, Gordon Brown doesnt have the power to act even if he had correctly identified the problem.<br>  <br>  But even then he had no control over the origin of the crisis which was all to do with the growth of the Sub Prime lending sector caused by a US democrat administration in the form of the Community Reinvestment act where the government viewed credit referencing as a form of discrimination against minorities and therefore offered to be garanteur to the banks for any mortages that failed.  This created an entire industry rush to sell mortgages in the sertain knowledge that eoither way they would still et their money and thats when they started offering bi bonuses for high sales of mortgages.<br>  <br>  Then when bundles of sub prime mortgages were discovered to be faulty they rebranded them to make them more saleable on the securities market (they didnt want to be stuck with a bunch of stinky mortgages)  This practice should have been identified and stopped by the Bush administration in the first term but the US SEC didnt pick up on it in time and they were massively under resourced.<br>  <br>  Brown never had any control over it.  All he could ever do was react to the crisis but he is limited in what he can do by the EU.<br>  So really he is doing all he can do and gambling that shoring up the assets of the banks will restore their prior worth on the market and jumpstart interbank lending.<br>  <br>  To do this he is throwing every penny we have at the crisis and borrowing to prop up the welfare state and government operations.<br>  Browns folly was squandering the wealth left by maggies reforms and selling off our gold reserves to buy votes in the public sector.  Had he not done that we perhaps would not have to borrow to bail out the banks.<br>  <br>  But then the biger problem is that nobody really knows how bad the situation is in terms of how many bad mortgage securities there are and because people are loosing their jobs and cant pay their mortaes the problem is going to get worse and we might not even be able to borrow enough money to keep the banks afloat.  The west has been borrowing form China and chinas wealth is form western consumer spending.  As spending retracts so does Chinese wealth and therefore loans will not be forthcoming.  This may well cost everything we have.  It's a vicious cycle.  <br>  <br>  Then there's the really bad news.  So far this has all been about mortgage backed securities.  This does not affect banks who do not deal in mortgages.  Ie car finance, credit card companies and the likes.  All of these sepcialize in unsecured debt and as people start to borrow on credit cards to pay off loans and mortage payments there will be an emerging credit card crisis and when people lose their jobs and cannot pay them then wider financial services will also begin to collapse.<br>  <br>  This may well be fiscal armageddon.  The factory reset button push on capitalism itself.<br>  <br>  Does that about cover it?|`|5axNEp8jaa	Because he relied so heavily on the false economy he also thought it was he who was the most successful manager of it when times were good.

Seems they're now all either pleading ignorance or lack of appropriate powers.  Most of us knew the UK was only appearing to be prudently managed - but Brown ignored all the warnings about the massive debts and definitely bears direct personal blame for a large part of the current crisis.<br>  His lie about the UK being best placed for the up-turn is arrant rubbish and he fools no-one by constantly babbling about 'global solutions' we have little or no way of influencing.  His reputation is in tatters and it would be far better if he went to the country in June so that his un-elected position as PM can be cancelled. <br>  Even Muffin the Mule would stand a better chance at the next General Election - so why does he prolong the agony ?|`|doLyOac0aa	Gordon Brown is just one big act|`|YHPYg7pWaa	Let us be honest,Gordon Incompetent Brown was riding on the backs of policies that the previous Conservative Government  put into place.<br>  Now when it comes to brains;Even my Granddaughter's gerbil Freddy knows that over the space of 200years there are peaks and troughs in the economic cycle and you put money away in the good prosperous days to cover the times of the depression.<br>  But what does our boy Gordon Incompetent Brown Do?Why he spends all the surplus money like there is no tomorrow; Like writing off the bad debts of the South American dictators and propping up questionable African regimes.<br>  Now coming closer to home;Why did he not not put safeguards into place to prevent this sort of Banking collapse.<br>  yes!When the political history books are written about this period Gordon Incompetent Brown will go down as the Arch bungler of all  time.<br>  Putting it another way,My Granddaughter's Gerbil Freddy could have made a better job of it!Why?Even he would not have sold our gold reserves for $240 an ounce that is now worth $940 an ounce.<br>  It comes to something when we have a Prime Minister who has not got the brains of a gerbil!|`|ab37b6bdb0bbbf15c8bbba9c3715bb8faa	As is now coming out of the woodwork much to Brown the Clown's dismay is that he was warned as long as four years ago that the debt situation was unsustainable but chose to ignore this advice and did nothing.<br>  Dear old Hal, Gordon must be pleased that someone has swallowed his guff.<br>  robert c  I think you do your daughters gerbil a disservice|`|AA12349988	Because bankers should have been able to regulate their own industry - these guys got paid an absolute bloody fortune to run their businesses.

In 1995 Clinton loosened housing rules by rewriting the Community Reinvestment Act, which put added pressure on banks to lend in low-income neighborhoods.<br>  <br>  The stimulus package was nothing more that payback, earmarks and Pork:

We have a winner!!|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	The simple answer is yes. Somewhere behind the scenes is the designer, but really your average Democrat does not seem to understand the dangers involved with creating too large an entitlement mentality. If they did they would never support the process. Most Democrats are not socialists at heart, but many of their leaders are without question. They are just skillfully manipulated through social conscience to go along with these plans.<br>  <br>  LA_native_30: Just for the record FDR did not get us out of any War. That would be Truman.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Democrats don't want bigger government.<br>  <br>  They want effective government.<br>  <br>  <br>  Something America has lacked since the disaster of 2000 and the alleged election of George W Bush|`|ErTVzpUUaa	That's how it's done!|`|oOPhM172aa	yes|`|b2efe4c24f079486fbaff579f92c1c00aa	I believe that is the plan!!|`|Souvww0maa	Power for the sake of power.<br>  <br>  It is amazing how forward thinking George Orwell was...|`|ipWRgKetaa	Yep. That's pretty much the idea. But it comes from their basic belief that these masses are inferior and that without their benevolence, would essentially lay down and die. They, like socialists through out history, see the masses as stupid, incapable, irresponsible and in need of their superior intellect and guidance. <br>  <br>  So, whether it is simply a desire for power or their innate belief in the imbecility of man, neither is a very good motive and frankly, it is probably a combination of the two. So there you go. Pretty sick, huh?

It is far bigger than that.  Obama will need far more than 6 months to get us out of this mess and most people realize that.  Bigger and more efficient government is the answer to an economy heading for a depression.  No one is spending, loaning or buying in this country.  The government must work as a player in the economy just to get that economy going again.  What part of this fact don't you conservatives understand?  The fact remains, which Obama has already stated, that the economy will not be turned around in six months.  Your very question scares the crap out of us who understand economics because your question tells us that you have no idea what we are headed for because of the folly of the Bush administration and those on Wall Street for the last 8 to 25 years.  We are headed for some very tough times and we are just beginning.  Obama is trying to spend our way out of it like FDR did during the depression.  It worked then bringing unemployment down from 25% to 10% before he decided to try to cut the deficits and spending and then he saw a rise in unemployment again to 15%.  But his plan was working well before the war started.  Obama is trying to avoid a deeper recession than we are headed for by spending on infrastructure, education, and new energies to create jobs which create demand.   He needs to spend.  If he doesn't spend now our economy will be far worse and ultimately will need intervention anyway.  If we wait to start spending when we hit bottom, where ever that is, then he will have to spend even more than he is now to get us out and it will cause much much higher deficits.  All economists are saying the same thing and they are also concerned that he isn't spending enough.<br>  If you're one of those types who are misguided enough to think the market = the economy then you couldn't be more wrong.  The market is irrational.  We should all remember that during the dot.com bubble of the nineties when Greenspan stated this very thing.  Now what we have in the market is irrational pessimism.  The market is not an indicator of the overall economy.  For example, today the numbers for february's unemployment came out and the numbers are at almost 700,000 people lost their jobs in February.  Yet the market is up 2.0%.  That's completely irrational.  The market would love it if our government would end social security completely and give all that money to the banks to bail them out.  You'd see the market shoot through the roof.  However, if the government did do this it would be really really bad for the overall economy if the government ever did that.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  for the inflation fear mongers out there:  There is no chance of inflation right now.  The huge problem we have right now is deflation.  That's why the feds put the interest rates at 0%.  When you see interest rates rise is when you will start seeing inflation.  Because the fed sets interest rates higher to counteract inflation.|`|74dfcb1be61ec91aea7144815438e380aa	My prediction is that that is exactly what he's been telling us. he's been saying that this won't be easy and won't be fast and will probably take a year to start seeing a positive affect. who told you 6 months?

I think that bigger or smaller government in the case of the financial situation now is irrelevant but, that won't stop naysayers from pointing fingers.  Success or failure at this point has almost nothing to do with policy and has almost exact correlation with how deep the money sucking hole that is AIG really is.|`|JXklGG7Naa	I hope so. But probably not. The media and the celebutards will continue to worship him; all the people (the majority of America) that borrow their political opinions from Joy Behar and Oprah Winfrey won't even know what's going on because they're going to believe Obama the millionth time he says "it's going to get much worse before it gets better."|`|O5KOwhovaa	1- Six months is nowhere near enough to fix the economy considering that Shrub spent nearly a decade messing everything up<br>  <br>  2- Bigger or smaller government isn't the answer.

It has continued to tank every time some new bit of information has come out about just how bad Bush left the economy.<br>  <br>  Also, there are the typical market scumbags who are short selling and driving the market down to make more money.  Why isn't Congress looking into this and stopping it?  Naked short selling is what tanked Lehman Brothers.  Why is it allowed?

To go along with "Uncle Tom", "token" and "alleged black". It's interesting how racist the Democrat party actually is, even as they scream that it is the GOP that is racist.<br>  <br>  As for Rush and Steele, the fact is that Rush had spent a lot of time supporting Steele's run for Senator. He'd talked him up on his show, had featured him on his show, and had even campaigned for him. So when Steele implied that Rush's show was "incendiary" and "ugly", Rush was rightly a bit miffed.<br>  <br>  And when you consider that Steele said that just after Rush had invigorated the GOP party base at CPAC, it didn't make much sense to knock Rush. You don't start off as party chairman by alienating your base constituency.<br>  <br>  Now, I don't care if he apologized to Rush, but he sure as hell needed to explain himself to the registered Republicans who he expects to elicit funds and volunteer hours from.<br>  <br>  Ahhhh... why do I bother? This goes right over the heads of the terminally adolescent leftists.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	I don't watch Rush, but I think this is a retarded point of view.  Even if he was racist (which I don't think he is), why would he ruin his career by doing somethig that stupid??<br>  <br>  Why do you think that all Republicans are racist and expect black people to pick cotton and sweep porches??

Better yet, let's here that one about Democratic tolerance. You are the poster child for what is wrong with race relations in this country. The majority of Republicans seek to erase the unnecessary racial distinctions while many Democrats insist on perpetuating them at every turn.|`|dHjya1Yoaa	Afternoon Edna.... nice to see your racist question today...

2a9MLpZRaa	No it's an attempt by the higher ups in the Democratic Party to paint all Republicans as angry and divisive people and secure their hold on seats in Congress and the White House.  This allows them to set the pace of how and when the Republican Party does things for choosing their leadership.  I don't think that is such a good idea because in our Rush we'll put someone up that either isn't ready or never would be ready.|`|Kn90YAzYaa	Doubt it.

As a matter of fact, the GOP is beginning to distance themselves from this jerk because he's gone TOO far to the right, if that's possible. I find it hard to believe that anyone would listen to his incessant rant and believe any of it.|`|X81oLqMtaa	I doubt it between Limbaugh and the democrats.  <br>  <br>  However, I bet the Senate Democrats and Republicans are in cahoots over the next approrpriations bill with the 9,000 earmarks.   <br>  <br>  The Senate voted overwhelmingly the other day to keep the earmarks in place and couldn't have gotten that big of a vote without a lot of Republicans on board.|`|k6hicodfaa	Democrats will also get an increase in fundraising and get to say in the coming elections--look at how the Neo-Cons still think like Limbaugh even after all these problems.  It's great marketing!|`|0cee90c25888a78a0b401efe2b753fd3aa	that would depend on whether or not it is profitable to Limbaugh.  He is concerned about only two things :  himself and his money.|`|I9FOycm6aa	Not likely.|`|A3UftwH9aa	It is certainly possible, albeit extremely unlikely, given Limbaugh's sordid past and his history of aiding and abetting hardcore GOP operatives in their quest to smear prominent Democratic politicians.  <br>  <br>  I also find it humorously ironic for one to claim to be a "critical rationalist" yet apparently be so predispositioned to baseless conspiracy theories such as this.  ;-)|`|nYjVW8Fbaa	people are so stupid, everything is a conspiracy, if people could focus on the issues instead of making them up the world would be a better place|`|bMtBtYDsaa	Now you know the democrats ...you know how they are.|`|SjTAVdcKaa	Doubtful, but its a fun thought.|`|AgxtBVwoaa	No

That 410 budget was left-overs from Bush's year!  <br>  <br>  Can Bush sign the bill into law?  I don't think so.<br>  <br>  Obama says he's signing this as the "last one from a dead administration" but he has closed Gitmo, he has shunned other policies of GW Bush, so what is his excuse for accepting that this piece of expensive over-spending should be passed without his reading line by line, as he professed?<br>  <br>  He can still blame things on Bush.  Milk it until the end.|`|p9rbEdpdaa	Looks like you weren't paying attention. That was the other guy who was in such a froth about "earmarks" here is what Obama said in the debates<br>  <br>  "But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget. Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion.<br>  Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.<br>  So my attitude is, we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What I've called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent.<br>  But let's go back to the original point. John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important. And, absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely."<br>  <br>  Sound like maybe you are a little confused. BTW, since you obviously aren't an economist, someone needs to tell you that this is what MOST economist suggest as the best way to get out of this Republican induced financial crisis. People have been losing their homes, thier jobs and their way of life for the past eight years. Time for a change, don't you think? Now the next Republican droid that feels a need to post  this inane question again just needs to check the facts here and save us all the trouble of answering this same inane, tired question time after time.|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	Oh yes he will. Obama will sign the omnibus bill and blame Bush for all the earmarks since most of it was drafted while Bush was still in office. Obama will not get rid of earmarks or lobbiests-they are vital to his reelection and the reelection of the democRATS.|`|AIbT2nUYaa	he got elected and doesn't care.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	TALK TO CONGRESS. <br>  congress WROTE the bill, and did the voting on it. <br>  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/04/martin.earmarks/index.html?iref=mpstoryview" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/04/m...</a><br>  Are you open to another view on this? read the above commentary, which puts the truth right smack dab where it belongs. <br>  It is PORK if it isn't for your county. If your county has 90% unemployd, and a bill will put THOSE persons back to work, you might not call it pork. <br>  As for Pelosi.. why do you fall for the garbage that she wanted money for a mouse? That was proven to be false. Nothing in the bill is for any mouse (read it.. don't just take my word for it. Read). There is a project for wetlands restoration. And no, there are no frisbee parks allowed. Yes, one was requested last year by some guy in Austin, who NOW is fully aware that excessive or irrations projects WILL be cut. Or did you think that the money was not going to be reviewed, and investigated? <br>  Many earmarks were legislated before Obama took office. <br>  Try a FAIR CHALLENGE. (they are rare around here). Is YOUR state or county getting funds? DO you know exactly what those funds are intended for, or do you have involvement in making sure that they are not misused? <br>  I'll actually agree with you that the country is going down the tubes, and millions are losing work/ homes and more. Obama did not lie that he does not like wasteful spending, and I don't like that billions of dollars has to go to rescue. <br>  The intent of those billions is to make sure that someone's child does not go hungry, or become homeless. It is up to US to see that the intent is followed.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	What? Obama Lied?

o0JOTzj0aa	It's hard to get a jobless person to agree to doing something for free when they really need the cash, but from my experience, offering to meet their transport costs and helping them out with lunch would probably be a big incentive.  The bottom line is, many jobless people can't afford to travel to a job that doesn't pay.  Another issue is that in reality, most people don't like having to work - they only do it because they get paid to be there, so whatever voluntary work they do would need to be fun, fulfilling and interesting.  If there was a possibility of getting something back from it, that would help too.  Maybe working towards a qualification while doing the work, or something.<br>  <br>  And by the way, the jobless are not made up from bums who dont want to work.  There are a lot who CANT find jobs right now since the economy got so bad.

Nejnh1Bqaa	They do it, because we let them get away with it.  Government aren't afraid of us anymore, they don't fear the wrath of the voter.  Why?

j3o8q7e9aa	If it's voluntary, I wouldn't supply the information.  However, I don't think you should be denied a job on the basis of ADD as an employer doing so might very well be violating the Americans with Disabilities Act.|`|aTLiaEGxaa	Yes, ADD is not a disqualifyer for employment. I am an officer and know several of my collegues who have ADD and epilepsy. Both of these conditions are treatable and when treated correctly can make you function well in this field. Frankly, on occasion, I think ADD suits the field well, as these officers are always on the move and very proactive.|`|a8e1KcS2aa	You'll be fine, as long as you can pass the other requirements of the job.  As the above answerer stated, the Disabilities Act will protect you from discrimination.  As a police officer, I was never asked about ADD, however it is probably because I don't have it nor do I take medication for it.  It will come up somewhere on your doctors' reports, but it should not be a problem.  I mean, I know a few officers with insulin pumps because of diabetes, and the potential for disasterous situations resulting from blood sugar issues never prevented them from getting hired.  Good luck, we seriously need more PO's out there.

He and Nancy Pelosi agreed to give $2 trillion to their pet special interests, but the funny thing (which they are bound to discover soon) it that the they do not have the money.|`|AA10231921	no, that's the problem.|`|IM30PoPNaa	Not exactly, but when the "somewhere else" is the distant future, it can appear to be something from nothing.<br>  <br>  Essentially, the thinking behind the Obama stimulus plan is like the thinking behind the Bush tax cuts -- borrow from the future, spend money now, and assume that the future will be paid back by higher tax revenues and a booming economy.|`|b7db0601f1b31d8dadd9eda35fc909f3aa	Well, they can inject a lot of hot air and meaningless rhetoric to cover up their real intents.<br>  <br>  But when the money supply is artificially expanded by government edict and their owning the presses, it just lowers the actual value and it will be like Germany right before Hitler; the money being printed so fast you had to get paid twice a day and spend the 200,000 Mark bills immediately, like in minutes, before they decreased in value.  Saw some in a curio shop.<br>  <br>  This borrowed money is "funny" money...no backing but promises for the future and hope the perpetrators will be gone before the birds come home to roost!<br>  <br>  But, we do not study history anymore, not really, and what happened in Germany before Hitler moved in to forceably clean up and destroy one group to confiscate their money is not mentioned much as an 'orrible example of what politicians can do with an economically unschooled public and promises made of  hot air and distant future hopes.<br>  <br>  So, no.  We may not see it directly, or we may as more money pursues the same goods and prices start rising.  Or our children, even Obama's children, whom parents love, will bear the impact in high prices and no money when the deferred disaster hits home.<br>  <br>  I do also see great significance in that Economics is hardly taught to most of our people, and most of the rest seem to be taught how to fudge and finagle others out of their money and goods legally, if not morally!<br>  <br>  The Government does not grow any crops, but does often produce real croppers that may get caught.  It does not go out and mine precious metals, except out of taxpayer's pocket, and transfer that to other pockets, taking off quietly a good bit from the top.<br>  <br>  Government adds no value, so to give to one they have to take from another..and taking from our children, who are too young to know, or our grandchildren, who may never realize they were robbed, to "give" us money now...well, we are uneducated in reality, by the Government-run schools,so we believe it!  Shame on us.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, those who do not learn from the past are condemned to repeat it.  Hope you all love the re-runs coming up!!|`|97ef16e9c13a4597a175d5786da95200aa	Not really.

x12mMdApaa	I plan on having a huge garden of my own, but what I don't grow myself I will purchase from local farmers.|`|54dc81bbc372d3bb6d12660dc6fc3623aa	I'm getting a lot more picky about where my produce comes from with the health issues that have arisen over the last few years. I do plant a little myself now but I have a good bit of acreage and I am looking to expand what I plant, though my job puts a limitation on the amount of time I can spend on it. I know several small farmers that run "Truck Farm" operations. I  make it a point to know what they grow locally and what they run a truck down to the port to pick up off the ships. This is a part of knowing your growers and the region of the country that you live in. You cannot grow limes in the Midwest. Not out side of climate controlled greenhouses. Which actually increases the drain on the resources and is more costly than importing, though it gives excellent quality control. I try to stay educated on this issue. There is a lot more to it than just quality, food miles, or regional pest and diseases. It's more about what you are willing to pay for and what quality you get for the dollar you spent.
t3QAaSN9aa	If you had actually been paying attention to what has gone on during the past few years, you would realize that Wall Street has been destroying itself.  If the stock market has to get back to fundamental basics before it can rise on firm ground, then so be it.  <br>  <br>  Obama was elected because the economy was collapsing after 8 years of Bush Republican economic policies.

They say a body in motion tends to remain in motion unless acted on by an outside force.  So it is with the world we live in.  Since the 1970's mega-corporations, not out of malice or even simple greed have collectively suborned governments to their advantage...even our own.  The drive for profits created not only honest competition, competition that was overseen by honest and impartial referees, but a darker form of competition that if not 'played' meant losing.  Less 'supervision' lead to more of this dark competition until the entire system, now running 'in motion' has come to its inevitable end....a system dominated by the greediest and the most corrupt. Wealth without work...commerce without morality and politics without principle brought us here.  Dishonesty lead to where we are, not of simply individual 'bad' people, but of a system that encouraged good people to look the other way, to discount the dishonesty and to decide to 'get theirs' while the getting was good.  P/Obama has the right idea....save the American wage-earner who ultimately through his labor pays all the taxes and creates all the profits.  If he fails, we all fail.  But either way, the world will never be the same for any of us...and that's a fact.  No kiddin'!|`|AA10079277	It is not a question.  The proof is right there in black and white.  It is a past-tense thing.  Look at Wall Street.<br>  <br>  Perhaps it will turn around, but this far, anyone who says anything to the contrary is unable to see facts or unable to make conclusions based upon facts.|`|tGe2jvWDaa	It is funny that people can be swayed by a Charismatic speaker, however, the Markets are not so easily fooled! Not even Obama can sway the Market with his emotional heartfelt speeches that are aimed at more Gov't control of our lives.

Between he and Geitner every time they open their mouths the market drops again. The simple fact is that Wall Street does not have confidence in the administration plans. Anyone who states different does so purely from a partisan perspective. Many will state that Bush precipitated the market condition. Even if we choose to accept this, as it does hold some truth based on Bush's actions in pushing through the first stimulus bill. It still does not negate the fact that Obama has not and will not restore confidence by following the same destructive spending patterns.

AA11494150	You did not say where you are from. Traffic laws are established by state law, so the answer will vary.

Otherwise the passenger will get the ticket.<br>  <br>  North Carolina's transpoorting open container law covers liquor not beer so the driver would be okay as long as the passenger owned up to it.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Many states have open container laws. You could easily find yourself on the side of the road taking a sobriety test.

The driver would get a ticket.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	You would get a ticket for Open Container!|`|k8ivyYfaaa	Simply: it depends on the state you live in.  Wyoming used to have an open container law, which allowed all but the driver to have open containers of alcohol in their possession... but I believe that law is since repealed.  MOST states will charge the driver and the passenger, as the driver is always responsible for the actions/persons in their vehicle.|`|HZvdr8VLaa	Well, I near a small town in Tennessee.  Here, it is not a crime to drink (as a passenger) .  If we got pulled over , the cop would probably ask for a beer and ask me if I wanted to shoot his gun!  I am not kidding, I have stood on the side of the road and shot the cops guns with him before.  I couldn't believe it.  haha|`|2rcSILkWaa	I believe most states have "open container" laws and require that the transport of alcohol be only done with sealed containers.  An open container is a no-no, and the driver will get a ticket.|`|ybtJJmJHaa	It depends on the state law where you're at. In Tennessee the passenger can drink an alcoholic beverage in a moving vehicle provided they are of age and the drink is not within the immediate control of the driver, i.e. in their cupholder.|`|GGIvqgPMaa	You are not suppose to have any open containers in your car. If your friend is stupid enough to drink a beer in the car while you are driving you probably need new friends.|`|lcNQ2w57aa	The driver will get a ticket for sure and if the cop wants, he can also cite the passenger, so you both could get tickets.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	Both of you get a ticket.

They try to stick it to Bush but seriously, the man can't do anything himself, know what I mean?<br>  <br>  Let me ask you a question... when those bombs blew up the Iraqi capitol... how many Iraqi soldiers were a threat to us exactly?<br>  <br>  You would think they would at least would have captured Bin Laden.|`|AA10322834	Answer is straight.To minimize Bush's anger on Muslim world.What USA got from this war?They loose and get down their economy.Bush should be trialed for the destruction of USA economy coz he is only one who is responsible this hard time.|`|It9YoDdfaa	well, penydred, one reason you might have got a thumbs down is because the hijackers were not Syrian and Syria is not our ally, rather i think you have Syria confused with Saudi Arabia.|`|SJr2tYeTaa	because the majority of senators( both republican and democrats) voted for it<br>  <br>  The reason was not oil<br>  <br>  If it was then why have we not recieved a drop of Iraqi oil?|`|AA10896470	Are you new???|`|HQI2Kqziaa	I'm sorry but where exactly were you on September 11, 2001?|`|wCdfMZdFaa	The technical reason was that Saddam refused to comply with UN resolutions regarding weapons inspectors, detaining them and diverting them thus giving the impression that they were hiding WMD's.<br>  While the UN doesnt mind being defied by tinpot dictators the US does.<br>  <br>  The case was made to remove Saddam on those grounds and on the grounds that he was a mass murderer.  Since the UN would not grant a resolution to allow an invasion on those grounds alone the US fabricated intelligence on WMD's in order to get one.  They didn't but they went anyway because really, who cares what the UN thinks?<br>  Half the people who speak there have no democratic mandate to do so.<br>  <br>  The broader reason for the invasion was because of neocon "War on terror" ideology.  The theory is that terrorism invaribaly comes form failed states, countries at war and dictatorships and therefore there is a domestic security interest in promoting democracy abroad because no two stable democracies with mature civic institutions have ever gone to war.<br>  <br>  Ideologically sound but impractical and diffcult to implement.|`|U2H1I9Sfaa	because Bush sent us there

As a result, we propped up a vicious dictatorial puppet state in South Vietnam, and we killed about 5 million civilians.|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	If you find a good answer let us know.

There was a lot of truth in that!  The USA was rightly very afraid of that, but getting involved in a murderous war to prevent it was, in hindsight, a gross error.  The fact remains that the spread of Communism back then was a deadly threat, and needed to be countered.  The USA was the only power that decided to do something about it.|`|3caq6SFxaa	john W has a very good answer and if you look in to it you will see that when the French withdrew the French Indochina colony was split in to South and North Vietnam (we had very little to do with the French defeat and we did not send advisers in to help them).  When that was done the South East Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO) agreed to help keep South Vietnam free.  Vietnam was not the US against North Vietnam but SEATO against with many other countries providing troops and support.  A large number of Aussies served, Thais, South Koreans, Philippines and so on.  It was an extension of the Cold War and was designed to stop the spread of communism and the Domino Theory was that if South Vietnam fell other countries in the area would also.  The theory was partially proven as both Cambodia and Laos fell to the communist but Burma and Thailand were able to contain it.|`|pYRZcfsJaa	to stop communism... or something like that. it was JFK's fault that we got stuck there.|`|9d3779e08741de60c8b3afd027f91e1eaa	It was an extension of the cold war.  The USSR had N Vietnam and the USA had S Vietnam.  At that time in history, the USSR was making moves to take over the whole world.  Cuba, Korea, Vietnam... anywhere they could get their hooks.  The US was in a race to stop them.  So the USA delivered arms and training to the SVN.  Over time, they added more troops to do patrols and defense.  Ultimately, there were 200,000 troops there doing combat against Guerilla war.  Technically, the US didnt lose the war.  But the public back home was tired of it, so they lost it politically.|`|kDsQASr4aa	damn you got some good answers here|`|n2oEhdZiaa	We didn't kill 5,000,000 people... we saved them from Communism!

AA11993638	It depends, there is limited information by law they can discuss with authorities or another individual. Example is if you threaten your own life or that of another person, or there is a reason to believe you are a threat to someone including yourself. Otherwise if no threat is made or you have not committed a crime, then the psychiatrist is held by HIPPA laws of disclosure. Which means if you signed paperwork stating someone else can be informed of your treatment, then they are allowed to talk freely with that individual only. The psychiatrist does have a duty to report if you admit to a crime or in cases of abuse.|`|a4XA69uGaa	It depends on how old you are. How do you expect your parents to take care of you if they don't know what's going on. If they are legally responsible for you than they should be told if you are severely depressed, or on drugs, or have 7 of the 12 signs of a teenage serial killer. So she may tell your parents (depending on your age), but nobody else unless you have confessed to planning a crime or hurting yourself or another-then she is legally obligated to report it to the authorities. Other than that, nope she can't tell anyone.|`|AA10892706	If you tell your dr. that you plan to hurt yourself or you plan to hurt someone else, all bets are off - she would be obligated to report you to authorities.

235bcacadf560b8452c6d79f769b9159aa	This is not a good question, why not just attack those in America that cannot defend themselves due to sickness, physically or mentally? You sound as if these SS recipients are multimillionaires, living a life of luxury on a far away beach in the tropics! Let's be reasonable and not kick people when they are down and out! Many seniors eat dog and cat food just to survive and that is when they still can stay at home before being forced into nursing homes which can have several unpleasant things happen to them if they get in the wrong place at the wrong time! Please leave the Social Security recipients alone, they have all they can do to find any happiness when struggling to pay bills! Many disabled veterans also qualified for Social Security, lets not turn on them like an ungrateful, rabid dog! Thankyou, I am sure you will re-think your question and position!|`|oVmGcRVtaa	The fact that "I" also contributed since I was 16 years of age and I am now 67 years of age and a 100% service connected disabled veteran make my collecting that amount of money a bad thing?<br>  <br>  Many of us old farts are unable to work because of physical problems.

ot6OJ7JWaa	You can't complain, just by smoking the weed you were doing something bad and you should be happy that nothing worse happened to you. <br>  In my opinion, it is hypocritical to be complaining about that kind of thing. Next time check about the time restriction, at any rate. And you shouldn't be driving (on a mountain, no less!) while under the influence.|`|pmB7EDq1aa	Yes he probably thought u guys were being suspicious he had every right to pull you over especially if you were the only car there then he was probably going to investigate... plus once u saw the lights u started to leave ... sounds suspicious to me|`|k8ivyYfaaa	Seeing a car late-night where there aren't normally cars is probable cause to pull the car over.  So yes, what he did was perfectly within the confines of the law.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Cops can do whatever they want whenever they want. he had every right to stop you. You are complaining but you should really be thankful you didnt get in trouble for the weed.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	People may be stopped based on reasonable suspicion which is a very low legal standard.  Reasonable suspicion is when an Officer has a reasonable articulate belief that a crime has been, is being, or was committed and the person before them did it.  You were parked in a dark area, possibly where there is a time restriction, and you tried to leave as soon as the Police showed up.  The Officer can probably justify the stop, especially if it was a park and you were there after hours.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Why would he NOT be allowed to pull you over?<br>  Even if the park doesn't have a no-after-hours-rule.. he can still pull you over.<br>  Cops can do that, if they think something is up they can pull you over whenever and wherever.<br>  What made him think pull you over is his call, but it's not unlawful.. it's lawful actually- he's supposed to do that.|`|VP1yQRwNaa	Just be glad you didn't get arrested and stop the whining.|`|OGCohFyNaa	Unfortunately, he was well within his duty. He's supposed to check into anything suspicious, and I'm sorry - but a car full of people just parked somewhere, 9 times out of 10 you're going to find a car full of people doing drugs or something that they're not supposed to be doing. People don't just park and hang out in their cars. It's a good thing that you didn't get in trouble - you wouldn't have gotten tickets, you would have gone to jail! (Trust me on this - it's not fun.)<br>  <br>  Anyway - next time take a little more precaution when you are trying to find a place to smoke. Maybe ride with fewer people (crowds tend to draw attention) or find a place that's inside so you're not seen at all.|`|dAsrWr3Maa	Hahaha omg this question cracks me up.  You openly admitted on a public site that your smoking marijuana?  Wow....some balls, then other people are giving you advice on how to not get caught next time?  Sorry had to throw that out there.<br>  The cop was more then justified.  He had reasonable suspicion for the stop (which wasn't really a stop to begin with, you were pretty much already stopped) and for that matter he had probable cause to take you and your friends to jail LOL.  <br>  <br>  Being on top of a moutain engaging in illegal activities probably isnt the smartest idea.  I bet you still had weed in the car.  How about quit smoking the stuff and you wouldn't have to post ridiculous questions.

The Good Thing is alot of the Bush Crap is getting reversed but nobody at the corporate level is getting jailed for it.  I wonder why it was so easy for Halliburton (the VP's old CEO Job) to get a govt contract and possibly not having to go through the bid process?  Why was there all the allegations of fraud in the news and suddenly, mysteriously they all disappeared???  Then comes the Blackwater Incident that tries to make us think they are enforcing accountability over there.  Heard anything about Blackwater lately???? Nothing more than a scapegoat, just like 911 was intended to divert attention from the bs that was going on here in this country on the daily basis.  Let's start a war and blame the Muslims for everything so we can look like we are doing something when we just want their oil.<br>  <br>  It is a proven fact by many inventors that we do not need gasoline to run an automobile.  Those people got bought off decades ago and are never heard from again.  Those ideas will "magically surface" again when we run out of oil and there is no more money to be made from it.

I4e8Hn3zaa	Infrastructure repair is what is needed for reasons of public safety. some new projects are needed also, and some are pork-barrel projects. They should be evaluated individually.Those jobs are temporary, but do infuse the economy with cash which will circulate through the entire economy. <br>  As long as they are accomplished by awarding contracts to the lowest cost competent contractors, go ahead and do it. The work needs to be done anyway. <br>  Only a small portion of what the Obama administration is doing is building infrastructure. Mostly it is building POWER and growing the size of Government, the size of the welfare rolls and assuring ongoing costs that will continue for decades if not forever.

pd4VLvoHaa	I guess I pretty much agree with you. Specifically, I hate commercial advertising in any and all forms and think it is the most vile and destructive action humans have ever committed against their own kind. The essential motive of the advertisement is to make you believe something without regard for its accuracy in the hope you will become dependent then contribute disproportionate value for the duration of your life. In a science-fiction premise, you would never imagine anything more heinous and obscene. These perverse motives are the fundamental flaw of market economics and advertising is the most gruesome visible symptom. I no longer believe any advertisement sells the shoe, the soda or the investment or the car anymore. Every advertisement is selling the same product now: disproportion, grandiose expectations, psychopathic greed, unlimitied 'individualism' and hatred of society and humanty.|`|9XJLlPaEaa	I hate partisan disinformation.

xmQKZzAwaa	It won't be just one event but a series of related events starting off with the stimulus plan follwed by higher taxation on businesses which will lead to more lay offs and businesses shutting down. Higher taxes and special taxes will also cause more investors to leave the stock market which will cause more lay offs and businesses to shut down. Since the unemployed seeking benefits will far surpass those who are lucky enough to have a job and after all the funds are depleted from the rich who did not flee the country in the beginning, the tax burden will be left to the middle class. After the middle class is drained dry and other countries refuse to help. The government will then start confiscating private property which will cause a mass riot.

Actually I'm pretty much as conservative as one can get. But I don't see eye to eye with you when you say that the economy died because President Obama lied. The economy was going downhill before he even took office and I blame that on the radically liberally dominated congress that we've had for a few years. Now, I completely disagree with how much spending Obama has proposed to congress along with the rest of his socialist agenda. It's ridiculous to believe that more spending and wasting will fix the economy. But the president doesn't have many powers at all that have direct impact on the economy. That's what congress is for. And remember, this is mainly a capitalist country. Which means that we, the people, control a massive majority of the economy. We can't blame the government for problems that some of us have caused because that is when the government will step in and try to help the situation which will only lead to socialist policies... Yea, President Obama is the closest thing we've had to a socialist president, but if we're going to get pissed off at someone over the economy, we should be pissed off at the few of the people who screwed over the economy and the congress who passes every spending bill, not the president. <br>  <br>  As far as the economy being dead, it's not, by a long shot. The only way an economy can be dead is if everyone runs out of money to spend which can only happen under a government that has complete control over the economy (socialism, communism, ect). What people seem to forget is that this is a free, capitalist country. By theory, this economy should fix itself every single time it gets in trouble because there is no higher power telling us what to do with our money... It's not like the US is running out of money. There is still the same amount of money flowing around the country and the world. But since business has been, generally, so good over the past 25-30 years big business owners and CEOs raised the prices of their products. Now when I say this it includes everything from gasoline to groceries and every other everyday needs. <br>  <br>  Another thing that happened is that some major corporations were outsourcing jobs to people in other countries because they work for less money. This, in all, laid off thousands, possibly millions, of jobs for Americans (and it's the primary reason why India's and China's economy grew massively). So then the unemployment rate goes up because there are many more people w/o jobs. After they lost their jobs, they had to do something to make end's meet so they go get jobs with low paying salaries and, POOF, greed caused a recession.<br>  <br>  Another thing that happened is that many Americans' credit ratings were shot. They were buying things they couldn't afford. So they have to make monthly payments plus interest to the banks that loaned them the money. Over time, with people losing their jobs and their salaries lowering, they're not able to make their monthly payment to the bank. So more and more interest and more and more penalties started adding up for the average American which only made them poorer. This also almost destroyed the banking system because less people were paying their bills. So the banks were running out of money and, therefore, they had to start laying people off.<br>  <br>  There are a few other big things that happened like the crash of the housing market which absolutely killed my dad's career as a realestate appraiser until the market picks up again. That's the great thing about this economy; THE MARKET WILL PICK UP AGAIN. Every market that went downhill will go up again because business owners, CEOs and banks are losing lots of business. So to fix their businesses, they will have to lay off many of their foreign workers, hire more Americans, which will raise the state of the economy, which will mean that more money is being made by average Joe. And this will happen in every company in every industry in every market. For their businesses to thrive, they need the people to thrive... Markets like the housing industry isn't controlled by a CEO or an owner. It's just a bad time for the market because there was a lot of buying a decade ago, so the people who bought houses, now, are settling down. Markets like the housing market rise and fall in waves and the people involved just have to be able to tough out the bad times.<br>  <br>  So my point is that the economy is not dead. Yes, I agree with you that the government is wasting a bunch of money. The Democrats are doing this because they want it to look like they recovered the economy by the time the next election comes around when, in fact, the economy will fix itself. And it's only a matter of time before it does start to go back up. And who's going to get the credit? President Obama and Nacy Pelosi and her liberal congress with their "stimulus package" because they decided to throw out a bunch of money during the heart of the recession... Just like FDR and his BS new deal.|`|x6R6HaMCaa	The economy was pretty terminal before he took office, and I believe he's going to do a good job to help it. Have some faith. These are bad times economically, which were created in large part by American stupidity, and so now Americans are just going to have to suck it up and be strong. We've done it before, and we came out on top... we can do it again, but we're going to have to stop demanding things from the government while simultaneously refusing to give anything up. Also, if not cutting spending, how the heck to do you define "saving" in terms of government budget?<br>  <br>  <br>  Added: I kind of want to know what you thought about Bush, because seriously, spying on American citizens? WTF? That like IS the definition of "Big Brother". And driving America TRILLIONS of dollars into debt? It's like he just never looked at the tab... I don't actually get how that much money can be spent... And it seems that all I ever heard in the last eight years was bad news. "thousands die in terrorist attack; we're invading a country that a lot of you guys didn't even know existed; now we're starting another war; we're cutting funding for important programs; our government is illegally spying on us; thousands/millions of Americans are losing their homes; Americans are losing their jobs; we're heading into recession; we can't handle s**t" .... Are any of those things untrue? Now at least millions of americans have hope, and are willing to work to make America better. <br>  <br>  Do you respect Abraham Lincoln? He suspended Habeas corpus, because the country was in crisis. Well, Obama is NOT going to do that, but if he has to take some uncomfortable measures, and I have do live a little less comfortably and make some sacrifices so my country can be a better place, I am willing to do it, because I think America is awesome, and I want it to work. I'm sorry if you don't feel that way too.|`|f9crUDTwaa	Obama may have lied ... all politicians do .

Rush as a conservative should be talking about personal liberties, sound economic principles getting rid of the federal reserve(or at least have oversight) and the constitution. But he detracts from all of this by stirring the pot for his ego. This is not a leader this is an egotist!|`|AcWMpmPwaa	now we all know rush would prefer something a little more competitive, don't you think???
f36a70ysaa	Obama has criticized Rush publicly and Hannity. If he is more then just talk and believes in his ideology he should be able to debate it with the two men he has publicly called out. I don't think he will, he knows that his ideology always does badly in open debate.|`|n4NdXUPfaa	Obama sees Rush as insignificant especially since he is a distraction to the cause of getting this country back on track.  Rush is the one who want to see Obama come to his show.  Obama see him as irrelevant.  Rush is a car crash that is sad, but everyone likes to see.  A person people love to hate, hence his high ratings.|`|3h37vetbaa	What would Pres.

He will debate him in a open fair floor. Not on Rush's show so he can OVER TALK him, cut him off mid sentence and just be plain ridiculous.

Unless you want to see how many times Obama can say "uh" in a single broadcast, I would recommend not even bothering to listen to this "debate" he would have with Rush.<br>  <br>  And the answer is obvious, Obama is a coward and will never debate Rush.  He was too much of a coward to even go on Chris Wallace's FOX News Sunday or the O'Reilly Factor until the election was almost over.|`|ERGGLvYiaa	Obama wouldn't have the marbles to do it...He most likely wont even address it.

I mean, come on!<br>  <br>  Obama claims this is the worst economic situation since the Great Depression (which is wrong, the early 80's were worse than this! but I digress), and he is wasting his time having little temper tantrums about a TALK RADIO HOST! REALLY???<br>  <br>  HOW OLD IS THIS GUY???<br>  Isn't there an age requirement for the President? I am sure it is AT LEAST 13, right?|`|v0G9s9ktaa	No.<br>  <br>  rush is trying to boost his ratings and Barack will not help limpbaugh out by going on his show.<br>  <br>  you have no business speaking of "cowardly" since your boy rusty punked out and dodged the draft (with a boil on his butt) when he should have been fighting in vietnam.|`|HZy629kLaa	Rush talks, Obama does.

Obama gets elected, Okay, only 60 million people voted for him, but then the republicans all start kicking up a fuss about things that are not true, have not happened or just pure simple fantasy. <br>  <br>  Obama has not done anything that Bush did. If you read something in a paper, check it out elsewhere, see who is saying what. The first rule of being intelligent is to use that thing inside you skull called the brain, to work out whether people are just plain lying to you, misrepresenting the facts or what.<br>  There is nothing worse than being against something because you believe you won't like it. How do you know? Maybe it will be good for you.<br>  I bet all those who voted for McCain voted for Bush and thought they were getting integrity back in the white house and all the other rubbish, and what did they get, a massive economic crisis, thousands of americans being killed in iraq, many more being injured, and a president that was a laughing stock in the rest of the world. <br>  <br>  Obama has done more work on the last 40 odd days than bush ever did. <br>  <br>  Chavez is in a difficult position. I was living in Spain in 2002. Spain was one of the two countries that recognised the new undemocratically elected govt in venezuela so fast they had to know it was coming, and they helped out too. The news reporting was so biased it was laughable. I am guess the same was true in the US.<br>  Get this, those that can communicate to the world have money, enough money to buy a computer and pay for the internet, and pay to live in a place where you can get internet. They hate Chavez, because they are getting a raw deal, they are making themselves amazingly rich from people being really poor, dying in the gutter and being completely ignorant through lack of education and health care. <br>  Those who cannot communicate with the world are getting a better life. Is Chavez silencing the opposition, or is he preventing another coup d'etat like the American supported one in 2002? <br>  Well of course in the US they are going to claim the former, but how do you know? You can't, because the news reporting is biased. <br>  Chavez did not close down the opposition when he first came into power, everything he has done has been done democratically, venezuela is a democratic nation, so why is america complaining? America loves democracy right? Wrong, they supported Saddam, the Khmer Rouge, Franco in Spain, Pinnochet in Chile, how many others can be named? Lots. America is not about democracy for others, it is about getting money out of them, making sure they do not become anti-american, and will do anything to make people hate those countries. <br>  <br>  Maybe people should open their eyes, instead of going onto yahoo answers and making short statements that obama is a socialist or a communist, find out what those terms actually mean. McCarthy is dead, the cold war is over, you are free, so be free, rather than act like a slave to the nation.|`|Izw8c3uNaa	YES a DEBATE WITH RUSH and PALIN<br>  <br>  WITH KURAK ASKING simple questions<br>  <br>  ha ha ha hahah<br>  <br>  ICANT WAIT<br>  <br>  <br>  ha ha hahahha|`|mBZU9a1Baa	Because they are both Socialist brothers!|`|0d6d73c79e6856ec69bb6c658154c1ccaa	Because that is what a socialist pig does!|`|u1bFsnCPaa	What is funnier to me, is the amount of morons out there that voted for Obama, and refuse to open their eyes to what is happening. <br>  <br>  Fairness doctrine, Obama is in favor of it, and it will shut down opposition on the radio, but leave the print, online, and television media alone. Sounds fair to me, since Obama has fans in the newspaper, on TV, and the far left kooks online.<br>  <br>  There is a formula the liberals have perfected, and they use it to destroy people dare oppose them and tell the truth. First they identify, then they demonize, then they repeat the lies until believed, and they finally destroy.|`|eoXRd3lIaa	Hide and Watch. That's exactly where we are headed. Get rid of free speech and opposition and let the government led you around by the nose,just a country of happy little plebs, with no recourse. We will all have to be brain dead liberals still blaming Bush. I can see kids 2 generations from now. "Mommy,its raining out side.Bush did it, Bush did it. Mommy,Whose Bush?" It's really getting old.

But it may take time before the money begins to hit the system and it is quite possible that the entities that receive the additional funding will hold onto it similar to how the banks have hoarded the money from their bailouts. <br>  <br>  The only way the market will stablize is if the gov't can stop the forclosures. Which I might point out will be difficult because you cannot re-fi a home when the value of the loan is far greater than the physical value of the home. <br>  <br>  My wife and I bought our home over three years ago and owe rough $255K however the housing market in our area has taken a plunge leaving our home worth $160k. Further our rate is that of 3 years ago and rates have taken a plunge since. But we cannot re-fi the note because the home does not have the value of the current not. The lender is Wells Fargo, whom will adjust the rate but not the principle. It does not make since to adjust our rate when we will still be $100k upside down because it will take roughly 10 years before the house will have equity in it or possibly more but certainly not less.|`|U50orfPhaa	I think alot of people who develop natural energy for us are losing their jobs.    Most Corp. are closing- so that TONS of jobs gone .   Since Obama don't support drilling, coal or natural gas- more car dealers are shutting down.  and Manufactures.   Since food costs are rising because of the liberal new taxes food will cost more and more people will lose those jobs!   <br>  NO HE's Making it MUCH MUCH WORSE!<br>  He actually is adding a Tax on Small business now- UNBELIEVABLE!   95% of us work for small business and NOTHING in the stim package to HELP THEM!

Jimmy Carter had little impact on the last major recession (worse than this one actually), yet was blamed for the woes.

Things were started on a downward trend by the last few years of his term with layoffs starting due to companies moving overseas. The military was cut to almost bear bones limiting our ability to respond to an attack. Plus as someone stated it is not the president that has final control over spending, but congress. You may as well have asked who left the better economy, Carter or Bush, but then you would still not be comparing apples to apples. But we are under a current situation closer to while Carter was president, you might want to start being concerned.|`|UvzKiis0aa	Clinton had the better economy.  Clinton may not have been the best human in the world but he did try to work for the American people and not just the special interests. <br>  <br>  Bush was deliberately destroying the US economy to enrich his friends.  It is why he fixed the facts around his desire to invade Iraq to repay his Big Oil campaign contributors.  All of the statistics like unemployment, poverty, etc. coming out for the last months of Bush Two are all back to Bush One levels.  So the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	You mean after 6 years of the Republican control of Congress?

I don't know that.<br>  <br>  I don't like Rush and don't listen to Rush.<br>  <br>  And here's something from the Congressional Budget Office. If Obama hadn't done anything the net difference in the economy by 2010 would be zero. <br>  <br>  But Obama is spending money (authorized by a Democrat controlled Congress)like a drunken sailor so the national debt is expected to jump by about 20%<br>  <br>  Obama can rightly say he inherited a trillion dollar deficit. But you have to remember this. $700B was authorized for TARP during the last days of Bush's term by a DEMOCRAT controlled Congress. And Upon being sworn in he asked for a "Stimulus" bill that added $787B on to the deficit. And now there's a $410B Omnibus bill on the way and who knows what is in TARP2.<br>  <br>  Those facts don't come from Rush. They come from everywhere! Obama may have inherited a deficit. But he's not doing ANYTHING to make it smaller. <br>  <br>  It's easy to say you will make the deficit 50% smaller by the end of your first term if you increase it by 300% within six months of taking office. <br>  <br>  I could tell Obama how he could have reduced the deficit he inherited by $700B. Tell the folks that got the first half of TARP to give it back. And don't spend the second half of TARP.|`|AA11963685	It's what they do.

They know what he says is hogwash and asinine but they have no elected officials brave enough to put down the extremely popular President Barack Obama for fear of losing votes in 2010.

Osama bin Laden offered his help in beating back Hussein and it was rejected in favor of the Americans coming in.  It infuriated bin Laden and the main thrust of their agenda against the United States began in earnest.  It may be that Clinton should have taken harder action regarding the U.S.S. Cole, but it wouldn't have deterred the plan for 9/11.  This particular group of terrorists bounce back like flesh eating zombies.|`|pgdTmT6caa	Yes, we had Osama at gun point and Clinton did nothing about it.  9/11 would never have happened had he gotten him right then and there.  It would have been over with.  But no this is the Democratic way lets be friends is there moto.  It's not that easy.|`|AA11369432	No, It was  George. That is why he ignored the warnings at first.|`|CCA0mTgsaa	I THOUGHT IT WAS GEORGE WASHINGTON'S FAULT|`|zlmnfFpYaa	The fault lies with the perpetrators, the 19 terrorists and their supporters.  Failure to detect the movements, planning and training of the terrorists can be attributed partly to Clinton, with some going Bush's way too.   The policies of the Clinton administration that prevented interchange and sharing of intelligence between the various security agencies was a major reason the plot was never detected.  Obviously, those policies were in effect until after 9/11.  <br>  <br>  The Bush administration had a pretty full plate for the 8 months he was in office prior to the attack, so any realistic expectation that he somehow magically should have discovered the plot is misplaced.  The simple fact of the matter though is that the attack occurred during his tenure, so he gets some of the blame.|`|p8ahZa8iaa	Partially.   He gutted CIA operations and even helped to foster a sense of mistrust among the various intelligence and law enforcement agencies.    His one attempt to get Bin Laden was a joke, we ended up hitting an aspirin factory instead.  Of course, at the time, the Republicans were accusing him of trying to deflect attention from the Lewinsky Scandal, so he wasn't getting a lot of help either.    But you can blame several other Presidents as well.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	My neighbor lost a daughter in one of the towers on 9/11. Her family was obsessed with the investigations as to what lead to this horrible tragedy.<br>  <br>  To make a long story short.......at first they hated Bush. After what they learned in those hearings, they despise Bill Clinton and were very supportive of Bush. Clinton had Osama in the cross-hairs on 2 separate occasions and called off the hit both times. These hits date back to 1996 and 1997. The US KNEW back in 1994 that Osama was planning on using US airliners as bombs and NO ONE was warned, NO security was put in place and they were able to carry out this plan. <br>  <br>  They are convinced their daughter would be here today had Clinton done his job protecting the American people.|`|Un3YxFvRaa	the muslim world has hated the US and it's Christian-Judea roots forever... just as it hates Israel.  It could never do anything about it, until oil was discovered there some 70 years ago... since then, it has been a goal  <br>  <br>  I was privy to documents re: 9-11.  It was a terrorist attack aimed at disarming America for Islamic rule.... <br>  <br>  Period.|`|4pHTkTUaaa	I don't think it's necessarily his fault, he could have taken more precaution.  But I don't know if anyone was prepared for the magnitude of that.  I also though, do not think you can blame Bush for that so soon after taking office.|`|0ffdb9dc23ea4daa66d018dcdabc0a14aa	well Clinton started it, so essentially yes.<br>  Clinton was really busy at the moment in the oval office trying to bang monica lewinsky, he didnt really have time for much else.|`|VMuZYfMwaa	No, it is Israel's. If not for Israel and the US support for them, the Muslim world would not hate us.|`|BUsMbbW1aa	In a sense, yes.|`|x6R6HaMCaa	No, it is not his fault it happened. It is the fault of those who carried out the attack. Hate is an evil thing, and nothing can justify killing thousands of innocent people. The Islamic terrorists are filled with hate for Americans, whose government may have done unjust things in the past, but Americans themselves are largely good people (even if they did semi-elect Bush twice). Even if bad people were killed in the attacks, murder is always murder, and the people who crashed those planes, planned the attacks, and were filled with hate are the ones responsible for committing murders thousands of times over.<br>  <br>  And if you meant, was bill clinton lax on security measures, it still wouldn't be his fault really. If someone robs a store that doesn't have an alarm, they're still at fault...|`|99a6c52cfb9842cdf983abb381e0fbf8aa	No one but the terrorists is at fault.  However Clinton did change policies that caused the FBI, CIA, Defense dept, and local and federal law enforcement people to not be able to communicate with each other.  This was apparently to help keep the law off of Clintons back.  The result was that even though the 20 known involved that were in our country were under suspicion by various agencies, 2 and 2 were not put together.  If all the known facts were put together the government may have stopped the act from being carried out.  The other problem was our appearance to be a paper tiger. This made us a more attractive target.|`|UqLEMXAgaa	I can tell you no more about it.<br>  Usama was on hold for the outcome of the election.<br>  He said if America elects the idiot son of the oil man he will do something.<br>  I studied this for years.<br>  George's dad forced Usama's dad to do things Usama found to be wicked.  Not the normal kind of laundry...|`|OEhH9hcvaa	only in part 9/11 happen because we went there to bomb them for 10 years just go and read the 9/11 commission report
mMaZi9iaaa	Was your waiver granted by advise of your civilian doctor? Or was it something the MEPS Station issued you?<br>  <br>  If your waiver was granted by the MEPS station, you will probably go through the same process for the Army.<br>  If you got a letter from your civilian doctor, getting a waiver w/ the Army will be easy too.<br>  In either case, you will need to talk to your recruiters (Army &Air Force).|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Stick with the zoomies, since they've already approved your waiver.  The Army would likely take six months to make their decision, since they're a larger service.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	Your waiver was granted by the Air Force waiver authority.  You will have to reapply to the Army waiver authority and it will take a long time if it gets approved at all.  If you have already submitted the records and completed a PFT, that will speed it up a bit.  Good luck.

8gnp5Kkjaa	You should be able to pay for most of it outright with that bonus.  What kind of financing depends on your credit rating though in addition to your base pay.  I hope you're able to do it.  Being in the military means a steady income for the next few years at least and they know that at car dealerships so that may have some impact.  Just don't let them screw you on the interest rate.  If they can't get you a good one, usually a local bank will be able to.  All you have to do is call them and get some estimates on what the loan terms would be.  You can then refinance the loan with the bank that gives you the best rate.  That's what I did with my Jeep a year ago.  <br>  <br>  Props to you for deciding to enlist.

I would recommend you finance through a military credit union.|`|fe57457146ff1608077b527bfec6f2dcaa	You probably can.  I can't recommend that though.<br>  <br>  Find a good enough car (if you really even have to have one) that you can pay for completely up front.<br>  <br>  Save going into debt for another day when you are earning more and when the economy is in better shape.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Wait until you get to your permanent duty station.  If you get sent overseas, you may not be able to take it with you.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	You might want to wait after AIT because you usually don't get a break after basic.  Also you won't technically have a permant address yet unless you use your home of record.<br>  <br>  It will depend on your credit and how much you put down.  Also they still might ask for a cosigner.  Just be sure to shop around for the best deal and get your payment set up on allotment so you don't have to worry about it.  Also check into insurance as well.  I recommend USAA.

They are graciously offering him that he can get his cash back if he's changed his mind.  If he still wants to immigrate to Canada, he doesn't have to do anything and they will continue to process his file and he will not be able to get a refund if he changes his mind later.

FByiwAk2aa	Make it legal, tax it, regulate it, and reap the benefits! But it won't happen anytime soon. But the good news is that the gov't will stop the raids on medical dispensaries and patients.<br>  <br>  There is currently a bill being proposed in Cali that calls for the legalization of Cannabis that will help with the states budget woes!<br>  <br>  Some quick PROVEN SCIENTIFIC facts about Cannabis:<br>  <br>  1) Marijuana is not a gateway drug. In fact, studies show that most tokers do not even drink or smoke tobacco. However, studies have proven that Alcohol is the leader in the "gateway" drug arena. Oh and you can make your own alcohol too!<br>  <br>  2) Studies have shown that Marijuana does not cause memory loss, nor does it cause depression (if it is being used alone and not with other drugs....prescribed drugs that is and alcohol.<br>  <br>  3) Hemp oil can be used to create methane gas which can be used to replace gasoline fuels and also burns cleaner producing less emission. Hemp oil can and was used for heating oil for homes. <br>  <br>  4) Hemp is more durable and has stronger fibers than cotton. It also can be grown nearly anywhere and does not suck the nutrients out the the earth like other crops like cotton.<br>  <br>  5) The big zero.....regarding deaths attributed or associated with Cannabis. Unless you're a smuggler!<br>  <br>  6) Over 60% of our population has tired Cannabis. 42% believe it should be legal for any use, 51% believe it should be tested and legal for medicinal use.<br>  <br>  7) Over 33% of the inmate population are Marijuana related convictions and each inmate costs the tax payers on avg $38,000 per inmate, per year to be in prison. That's a ton of money that can be put into the system if they weren't incarcerated. <br>  <br>  8) Last year there were over 255k marijuana related arrests. Again wasted money!<br>  <br>  9) The leading drug problem among US teens.....well it is the drugs in your medicine cabinet. The same drugs that are prescribed by a doctor and the same drugs that are legal. Oh and by the way, the FDA does not test the drugs. In fact the FDA doesn't do any testing until they receive complaints! <br>  <br>  10) Cannabis isn't illegal because it can cause you harm. In fact, Cannabis is less likely to cause you harm than any of the prescribed drugs, alcohol, tobacco out there. Cannabis is illegal because it competes with the prescription drug market, petroleum industry, clothing industry, and paper mill industry.<br>  <br>  There plenty more but this topic is asked a few times everyday. Those of you who are against the legalization of Cannabis, please keep in mind that the prohibition started because companies such as Johnson & Johnson (pharmaceutical), William Hearst Corp. (made his fortune with paper mills...destruction of trees!), Son Co Oil (big oil company), and last but not least and well known....the DuPont company who feared that Hemp fiber would keep them from making it big because it competed with the newly designed synthetic fiber DuPont created. Oh and that at one time our gov't begged for the public to cultivate and farm hemp products for clothing and the use of rope for for mourning lines for ships.|`|FNMMm7Dnaa	the government would tax it like cigerettes and drug dealers would only make money selling a more potent type .|`|YupMCYHlaa	I agree.  Besides that it would provide billions in taxes.  Pot costs almost nothing to grow and package, so it could be packaged 1000% and it would still be much cheaper than it is now, so people would be happy to pay it. It could be sold in liquor stores and subject to the same laws and restrictions.  <br>  <br>  It would be a blow to organized crime and all they represent, including corruption of the police (same problem as we had during prohibition).<br>  <br>  The problem is that any politician who dares suggest that our current drug policies aren't working is instantly jumped on by his competition as 'soft on drugs'. So they have to compete with each other to be 'tough on drugs'.  <br>  <br>  In fact I think the whole reason this is a big topic of discussion all of the sudden is that Republicans are claiming that Obama wants to legalize pot, but I've never heard him say anything like that.|`|khdFNlJ7aa	<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/24/BAO416354C.DTL" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cg...</a><br>  read that article, SF supervisor Ammiano is already trying to get it done.

The film tells the story of the violence and blood shed that can be expected when civilized society is deprived of necessities such as food, water, or energy supplies.  It is an orgy of violence and bloodshed that present day  Californians should be thinking very seriously about.<br>  <br>   A January 17, 2009 story in the Los Angeles Times  by Evan Halper and Patrick McGreevy is headlined “California controller to suspend tax refunds, welfare checks, student grants.  It tells the story of  California’s ongoing financial crisis, brought on by years of liberal and Democratic dominance in California politics.<br>  But more importantly, it provides a chilling glimpse of what is in store for the people of America if  Barack Obama, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi are permitted to impose their ideal of what America is all about from their respective perches in Washington.<br>  <br>   According to the Times, State Controller John Chiang said he had “no choice but to stop making some $3.7 billion in payments in the absence of action by the governor and lawmakers to close the state’s nearly $42 billion budget deficit.  More than half of those payments are tax refunds.”  The state expects to be $346 million short of funds in the month of February, and by March the state could find itself totally insolvent.<br>  <br>   The controller anticipates that the suspended payments could be “rolled into IOU’s if California still lacks the  cash to pay its bills by March or April.  In a most unfortunate  choice of words, the controller said that it pained him to  “pull this trigger “ but that it was a “critically necessary action.  California officials have already designed an “IOU template” and are now negotiating with banks to determine whether taxpayers, students, and welfare recipients would be allowed to cash or deposit them, if and when they’re issued.<br>  <br>   Just ask yourself…Who  but a  bunch of liberal Democrats would even dream that  banks would exchange  cash for a worthless piece of paper that is  backed  by…nothing?  If you think that’s a good idea, you might also think it would be a good idea to elect a young inexperienced , radical leftist of questionable  citizenship as President of the United States.<br>  <br>   The times tells us that, “the payments to be frozen include nearly $2 billion in tax refunds; 300 million in cash grants for needy families, blind, disabled; and $13 million in grants for college students.”  The state will continue to pay more than $6.6 billion in school and healthcare bills.<br>   In the face if this looming disaster, the governor is asking for tax increases, spending cuts, the relaxation of some environmental regulations and legislation to allow some government  construction.  The governor has ordered non-essential state employees to take two days off each month…without pay …and most state offices, including the Department of Motor Vehicles, is to close on those two days.<br>  <br>   If you’ve never lived in California and have never visited a DMV office to acquire a drivers license or car tags, you have no idea what that means.<br>  According to the Times, the state has also stopped payment of bond money covering more than 5,300 public works projects in progress.  276 of those projects have been exempted because they are nearly complete and the cost of shutting them down would be greater than the cost to finish them.  In the meantime, contractors are warning of the unintended consequences of stemming the flow of public works funds, suggesting that such action would be taken at significant cost.  <br>  <br>   Caltran s Director Will Kempton estimates that the state would incur an estimated $350 million in legal costs, breach-of -contract claims, and expenses for securing dormant construction sites.<br>  To say that California is a state teetering on the brink of anarchy would be an understatement.<br>   What happens when welfare checks and student aid funds are cut off and public works projects are suspended.  Democrats in Sacramento will almost certainly find a way to ram tax increases through the legislature and the governor, threatened with another kind of “ cutoff” by his liberal Democrat wife, will sign them into law.<br>  <br>   But tax increases are exactly the wrong prescription.  As corporate taxes increase, businessmen across the state will react.  Some will lay off workers, increasing the ranks of the  unemployed, while others will simply close their doors and announce a move to Arizona, Texas or Oklahoma.  College students from San Diego to Sacramento will stage violent protests, shutting down most colleges and universities and over taxing police and National Guard forces.<br>  <br>   Taxpayers due refunds and public works contractors demanding payment for work already accomplished will clog the courts with lawsuits.

XIZKNNuhaa	So far everyone is pretty much right about the Marine infantry part and the tours we do for Iraq and Afganistan. Except that the Marines aren't always first in on any current conflict. The SOCOM (Spec OPs) community is normally there first if anything. Also, the Army has been in on the ground spreadheading the last few major events with or without the Marines (Domincan Republic 1965, Grenada, Panama, Desert Storm, Bosnia and Kosovo Army shows, Haiti, OEF, OIF (Fallujah1 &2, Ramadi). People forget about our airborne forces jumping in and taking objectives before most huge land forces come in. Even in Desert Shield in 1990 we had a whole brigade of the 82nd on the ground with a few days in Saudi Arabia in 1st week of August. Since it's all about joint ops, we both roll together. I have served with and was even wounded with some fellow Marines (3/8) in Iraq, so it's no different than WW1 or other conflicts in the past.<br>  <br>  The Army grunts are normally made for long term deployments and sustainment. Even though in Vietnam (Marines had 13 month tours, Army 12), Korea and WW2, we both fought in the same theater for the same amounts of time. Nowadays, due to  ship to shore rotations, sea duty and other duties, smaller size, the Marines aren't going to stay on the ground as long as us. We have 10 active divisions (which each one having about 10,000 to 20,000 Soldiers), 6 separate active combat arms brigade size units (the NG has 28 Bde combat teams alone. A brigade has about 3,500 troops), 5 SF groups, 3 Ranger battalions, 6 Psych Op battalions, 1 CA Bde just to give you a idea.<br>  <br>  Now as for Marine Boot Camp vs. Army Infantry BCT, yes, thiers might physically more demanding here and there. and yes it is longer. Thing what your UNIT is like and WHAT YOU do next will determine how far you go in combat. If you 'slug out' and never do p.t. or train on weapons because your in a bad unit, it won't matter how hard a D.I or a D.S. was. <br>  <br>  -If you go to a LAV, Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion in the USMC or Mech, Armored Bradley/CAV unit in the Army, you take the chance of being squared away due to mounted units having a different outlook things...it's all about maintence, gunnery and motorpools.<br>  <br>  -If you went to a good Marine infantry light battlion or a light/airborne infantry in the Army you will have a good chance of being squared away.<br>  <br>  -If you go to a Recon Battalion in the USMC or a Ranger Battalion in the Army you WILL be squared away.<br>  <br>  -If you passed selection and made it into Marine Special Operations Battalions (MSOBs) (where most Force Recon members drifted over to) or US Army Special Forces then you are squared away and can teach others.<br>  <br>  <br>  Everyone will give you a bias opinion toward their favorite branch, but I know we were all dirty workers on the same construction site. Do some research and think about do you want to be a Marine or a Soldier? We have many prior service Marines around my unit. Heck I work with an attorney who was one. It's common. Just thing about the long term goals and what future you will have. The Army is just bigger, but that doesn't always mean better.

Keep in mind Marines aren't just soldiers, they are sailors too!  These guys originally started out in the brigs onboard the old ships.  They were given the opportunity to repent for lack of better words and became the boarding parties the Captains would use during the wooden-side days.  They got the nick-name "leather-necks" because they used to wrap a a leather belt around their necks to keep their heads from being chopped off as they boarded the ships.  Marines are a specialized branch in ground warfare and guard our US Emabassies.

Those records -- which raised questions about Mrs. Clinton's role in the Castle Grande deal -- were subpoenaed in 1994. They were missing until early 1996, when they turned up in a White House room next to her office. She says she doesn't know how they got there.<br>  <br>  C is for Cattlegate, Hillary Clinton's mysterious ability to turn a $1,000 investment into a $100,000 profit on cattle futures, a feat experts say was virtually impossible in normal trading.<br>  <br>  C is also for Castle Grande, a real-estate scheme that federal regulators say was a sham. A federal inspector general's report found Hillary Clinton drew up the legal papers that were used to improperly funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars to Seth Ward, father-in-law of her ex-law partner Webster Hubbell.<br>  <br>  D is for Billy Dale, the career head of the White House Travel Office, who was fired along with six other career staffers, to make way for Clinton cronies in Travelgate. The White House then brought in the FBI to justify the firing, and Dale was hit with criminal charges that wrecked his life for two years. A jury cleared him in just two hours.<br>  <br>  E is for Mike Espy, the former agriculture secretary who was forced out over charges that he got gifts and favors from Arkansas-based Tyson foods, whose owners were longtime Clinton backers. A special counsel has brought several indictments, though not against Espy.<br>  <br>  F is for Filegate, the improper White House rummaging through 900 FBI files on Republican officials in the Bush and Reagan administration. The White House says it was an innocent snafu. Republicans suspect an enemies list. Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr and several congressional committees are probing.<br>  <br>  G is for Golfgate, ex-White House aide David Watkins' improper use of presidential helicopters for a personal golf outing. He was forced to resign. In the 1992 presidential campaign, Clinton aides tried to use taxpayer funds to help settle a sexual harassment case filed by a fellow campaign worker against Watkins.<br>  <br>  H is for Hillary Clinton, whose role has been questioned in Filegate, Travelgate, Billing-gate, Whitewater and Castle Grande. She denies any wrongdoing.<br>  <br>  H is also for Hubbell, in jail after pleading guilty to bilking law clients on charges brought by Whitewater independent counsel Starr. Hubbell was previously the associate attorney general, the No. 3 Justice Department office.<br>  <br>  I is for Indonesiagate, featuring the Lippo group, a firm with long-standing ties to Bill Clinton, Clinton cronies and Arkansas. Republicans want to know why an Indonesian couple -- of apparently modest means -- with ties to Lippo gave $452,000 to the Democratic National Committee and what the firm may have gotten in return. Lippo also hired Hubbell, at a reported fee of $250,000, for the five months when he left the White House and went to jail.<br>  <br>  J is for Paula Jones, who accuses President Clinton of sexual harassment, saying he dropped his pants and asked for oral sex in an Arkansas hotel room while he was governor and she was a state employee. The U.S. Supreme Court will rule this fall on whether her case must wait until after Clinton leaves office, as he demands.<br>  <br>  K is for William Kennedy, another ex-Hillary Clinton law partner who became a White House lawyer and was forced to resign after concealing his failure to pay nanny taxes. He was reprimanded for his role in Travelgate.<br>  <br>  L is for Craig Livingstone, the ex-bar bouncer with a history of drug use who was the head of White House security. Two FBI agents say it was Hillary Clinton who demanded his hiring, which she denies. Disgraced Clinton political guru Dick Morris's hooker pal, Sherry Rowlands, claims Morris told her a "paranoid" Hillary Clinton was behind Filegate. He says he only told her that's what polls show.<br>  <br>  M is for Jim and Susan McDougal, the Clintons' Whitewater partners, both of whom have been convicted of fraud. Jim McDougal is said to be helping Whitewater independent counsel Starr. Susan McDougal is in jail for refusing to say whether President Clinton lied when he denied knowing about an illegal $300,000 loan to bail out Whitewater. The loan wasn't repaid, and taxpayers were left holding the bag.<br>  <br>  M is also for disgraced political guru Dick Morris.<br>  <br>  N is for Bernard Nussbaum, the former White House lawyer who barred federal investigators from searching Vince Foster's office after Foster's death. Nussbaum also withheld Foster's diary on Travelgate problems from federal probers for more than a year. Nussbaum was forced to resign for botching damage-control efforts.<br>  <br>  O is for Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, the frequent flier who drew up an enemies list of reporters, hired an|`|Souvww0maa	The decimation of our Military and Intel services<br>  The propagation of Nuclear secrets to China<br>  Terror attack after Terror attack<br>  An dead camel in Afganistan and a burned out shell of an Aspirin Factory in Somalia.|`|x12mMdApaa	when I think of Clinton I think of Monica.|`|9klx10iKaa	He does not have one.

Much, much longer.<br>  <br>  Whether or not you learn a trade depends a lot on what you sign up for.  Infantryman is a big occupation in the military, but does not prepare you for anything as a civilian.  Navy and Air Force are better for learning a future civilian trade, but you can do it in the Army or USMC if you are careful.  Regardless, there are no guarantees you will learn anything useful outside the military.<br>  <br>  You will get fit.  Army and USMC are both good for that.  If you cannot they will discharge you.<br>  <br>  You may see the world - again it depends.

I researched and researched until my eyes were about to fall out of my head.<br>  There are pros and cons to everything in life and this is no exception. Pros: pay is steady, chances to travel, job experience of some kind, medical, fitness, GI Bill, housing, etc. Cons: long term commitment (what if you're in for a year and decided you hate it), you go where the MILITARY wants you to go, possibility of going to a war zone and having to fight, etc.<br>  Consider and research all of these things in depth, go to a recruiter's office of each of the branches, talk to people who are or were in the military.<br>  In the end, it's all up to you. For me, it's a deeply personal decision and statement about how I believe in my country and the freedoms and beliefs it represents, how this country has granted me with so many opportunities and rights that some in other countries do not have. I get excited about being in the military, doing right by my country, fighting for what I believe in. This is a big decision that will have a huge impact on the rest of your life, look into it and then make your decision.<br>  I wish you luck on any endeavor you choose!|`|AA12215565	go for it

I know I'm required to stick it out, but I'd really appreciate it if you would release me from the requirement."<br>  <br>  Then your employer is going to ask themselves if they want to spend a lot of time and money training and paying an employee with no motivation to perform and who is just going to quit.  You really aren't any good at most jobs for the first three months anyway.

I just noticed that you are in the UK.

That one day thing the other respondent posted sounds far more realistic. In the U.S. (or at least in my state) the employer could recover a bonus or advance (it sounds like that is not your case) but could never recover your future labor or dollar value thereof. That's slavery (not that our economy is not already slavery but that's a blatant enough form of slavery that even U.S. law cannot enforce it).|`|k8ivyYfaaa	Depending on the state you live in, it would also depend on the contract you signed.

Only the legal immigrant or us citizen get the benefit from government.  Don't be race people.  I think there are many way that government could do somthing to prevent, but they do nothing.  At least we should offer some kind of work permit to allow illegal immigrant who willing to work and pay tax.  I think this country is the country of opportunity, but whoever live here legally take it for granted.  Also, with the people that already here illegal, we can charge at least $1000 per person and allow them to work or stay in our benefit let them pay tax and beable to contribute to our country.  Don't be selffish american that we only take, but not give.  this country can not live without immigrant anyway.  There are good and bad people everywhere. Don't just point out to only mexicans.

But on the other hand if he was gainfully employed and contributing to the family I am sure you and he would both find renewed happiness.<br>  <br>  You can enlist all the way to the age of 42 now thanks to the two war fronts in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The military needs people who want to serve badly.<br>  <br>  He would get paid well for someone with no formal training and no college education.  I have been doing this for 14 yrs and I know I cant complain especially with the economy the way that it is now.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say take him to a counselor but if he is depressed enough or has some serious medical problem they may medically disqualify him before he even gets started.

The pay is not that attractive for an E-1, so if you think you should join for pay you are thinking wrong. Don't get me wrong it's a steady paycheck and great benefits, but with a family as E-3 or below it can be financially strapping.

HZvdr8VLaa	The results of a field breathalyzer can be altered by something as simple as chewing gum or smoking.  They are not known for their accuracy, I think they should be banned.  Not to mention , cops are not trained lab technicians, and know nothing of how to preform lab tests.  There are many variables here, so , you have a chance to beat it.  The blood test will be accurate.  It is a very reliable test.  If it comes back positive, I would hire the lawyer ONLY if he can get it dismissed.  If he can't , you will still have a suspended license regardless of what your lawyer tries to do.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	Your breath test was most likely a 0.13 since a 1.3 would be over three times a fatal limit for most people.  If the breath test was accurate then the blood test will probably be a little higher then the 0.13.......blood tests are usually higher then breath tests.  How long was it from the time you threw up?  Also was the breath test into a hand held device or "tabletop" one.  If it was hand held was it a brownish box or a gray and yellow contraption that beeped?
AA11206283	You probably won't go to jail; unless you don't get some kind of agreement in place with the people you have written the checks to that will let them know when you will get these checks redeemed. <br>  <br>  Call them.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Call the stores and explain the situation.

The problem will be compounded. Call them, try to make payments.|`|k8ivyYfaaa	It really depends on the laws of your state.  Generally, if you did not intend to commit fraud (ie pass the bad checks), then you will not be charged with the crime.  <br>  <br>  One thing that's concerning is that you said 'I don't have the money to pay them, and I won't'... if you honestly made a mistake, then you should make the effort to pay the checks.

If you are criminally charged, your defense would be to explain why you thought you had enough in the account to cover them.<br>  <br>  However, in most States there are civil penalties - typically two or three times the face value of the check - for passing a bad check. You are also liable for the court and collection costs.<br>  <br>  If you go to the stores and set up a payment plan, they may be willing to accept so much a month and you'll only have to pay the actual amount. If you don't, they will sue you, get awarded the value of the checks, plus the double or triple damages, plus court costs, plus collection costs, and they will be able to attach your assets and/or garnish your wages or other income to get their money.<br>  <br>  Richard

Over half the people we interview have applications elsewhere.<br>  <br>  The only thing that would make it bad is if you made some comment during an interview hinting that you preferred some other department.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	No.  There is nothing wrong with showing interest in more then one department.  If they ask you just be honest and tell them you have applied to other agencies.  There is nothing wrong with telling them (whoever it is) that you would much rather work for them but applied elsewhere for a back-up plan.|`|tPvjd8qqaa	If you get into the interview portions of the hiring process you will need to have an answer for this.  If you are a good candidate and the oral board or interviewer likes you, they may see the need to speed up the hiring process to get you before the other agency.  <br>  If you use the shotgun approach and apply to everywhere, they may think you aren't too picky about where you work.  So if you use that approach, you'll have to have a good reason for it.  <br>  If you use the shortlist approach then you need to say why you selected the agencies you selected..

The problem with this issue right now is that it is tied to so many other issues like religion, national pride, militarizes, governmental planning, etc... the list goes on.

In the industrialized countries populations are actually shrinking.   Thanks to aids and malaria,  Africa is now close to zero growth.   China and India's growth rates have been falling precipitously and will come to zero growth within the decade.  The real problem is the age distribution of the population, with fewer and fewer working age persons, particularly in the West.

Just as in the 1920's, 30's and 60's, when oil was predicted to run out,  there is an abundance of oil and other fossil fuels available for hundreds of years in the future.  The costs of extraction and exploration are an issue, as well as the polution and (if you believe it), climatic issues,   but there is a lot of oil, natural gas and coal.     <br>  <br>  Best  you find the facts from primary sources, rather than get information from slogans friend.|`|QFLtTeKEaa	In the last century the population the of the earth grew from 1 billion to 6 billion.

Their leaders do not want to give up their source of support, because most people who participate in a religion were born to it.    <br>  <br>  I don't think it is going to be reversed on an international level jointly, because those of us who feel this responsibility to future generations over the issue of population are also the type of people who want to cooperate with the laws and rights of nations and people.

Conditions precedent are listed in the Constitution as well as Representation of Peoples Act. The objective of any election is democracy. The voting right has been secured by people of different nations by bitter struggle against the ruling monarchy or oligarchy with loss of millions of lives due to the repressive acts of the rulers. Indians got this right without any struggle due to the sagacity of the leaders immediately after independence. You may remember that under the Government of India Act 1935 too, elections took place for provincial assemblies in 1937, and voters (and consequently candidates) were only tax-payers, i.e. landowners and very few Income Tax payers.<br>  Strange as it may seem, Sri.K.Kamaraj, who emerged later not only as an astute statesman but also the king-maker of India, was not a tax-payer. Sri Muthuramalinga Thevar, the silver-tongued nationalist leader, bought a goat for Kamaraj, paid the livestock tax of the municipal body to get Kamaraj enumerated as a voter. The Constituent Assembly too was elitist and feudal by and large because of its class character but the pervading nationalism of the times aided by the best legal brains of the times, Rajendra Prasad, Ambedkar, Rajaji, Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar, N.Gopalswamy Ayyangar, K.Santhanam, Vallabhbhai Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru, Govind Vallabh Pant and others ensured that no inequity is inbuilt into the democratic process.<br>  Contrary to the opinion amongst the educated class, the vast majority of MLAs,MLCs and MPs are well-educated and academically equipped people. The uneducated or semi-educated representatives constitute miniscule minority as per the statistics available and provided by the Election Commission of India.<br>  Another pervading myth is that lack of education on the part of the elected representatives is the cause of the ills of the society. Though the basic premise is wrong, almost all politicians considered corrupt are highly educated people. The city-dwellers who are English-educated may consider a couple of suave and polished leaders as great and capable. But can anybody explain why these worthies acclaimed as great economics experts, have brought a situation wherein (a) good quality rice sells at Rs.36 to 40 per kg (b) granaries are brimming with no space to store further grains (c) farmers have got only Rs. 10 per kg for paddy with the resultant cost of only Rs.18 for rice and transport, packing loading unloading and storage expenses by international standards is only 10% and profit margin 10%, and consequent retail price ought to be Rs.22 per kg.(d) Farmers are committing suicide unable to pay debts (e) not even 30% of rural deposits mobilised under savings bank accounts @ 3% p.a. interest is lent in rural areas by banks and even the lendings carry an interest of 12% to 16% .(f) No say for the farmer in regard to input cost or output cost whereas all other segments of society can dictate terms, lobby and pressurise the government.<br>  It was the nearly illiterate Kamaraj, who was responsible for widening the scope of education to all with nearly nil school fees, understood the problems of children in poverty conditions by providing free meals and free uniforms and educational accessories. It was the non hi-fi Karpoori Thakur who did the maximum for the farmers.<br>  Coming to the basic question, it is uncontitutional to provide any prescription of educational qualification for elected representatives. If at all any such discriminating feature has to be introduced, by way of an amendment, I would suggest that the maximum (funny?) qualification should be SSLC/ matriculation for a period of 25years at least, so that the real exploiters of the society who have divided the nation as India with elitist decadent culture and Bharat, the real culture languishing in poverty and penury crying in the night and crying for the light for the dawn of an era of pragmatism and equity in the polity and economy. <br>  May I remind that liberty is a fiction if there is no equality, equality is a farce if there is no fraternity and fraternity is a fraud if there is no justice ?|`|wCdfMZdFaa	No.  Since when were qualifications indicative of intelligence or ability?<br>  Deomcracy is government by the people for the people.

Try getting selected for a major party without having the right proscribed background.<br>  <br>  This is why we have MP's who dont identify with the problems and difficulties of ordinary people.  They have never known hardship.|`|rkZhVpvgaa	I agree with you that there should be minimum qualification for MPs & MLAs to contest elections, as is necessary in other fields.<br>  <br>  I would also like to add that even there should be age limit for retirement from the politics for MLAs/MPs.
AA10123414	Perhaps because you make more.<br>  <br>  "I thought child support was to "support" your child..." - You thought wrong. Child support is to pay their share of supporting the child.|`|ewd9n2lRaa	Because that child support order was probably in place before you filed yours and unless that child support order is modified and your child added into it the older child is probably going to always get more child support.  All you can try to do is try to modify yours.|`|AA12146958	Child support needs to be modified to allow more equity. But you will not get the same amount as the first one gets. Hers will probably be less and yours a little more. But that is something you will have to deal with thru the courts.|`|OlkxOXuhaa	Your situation shows how this law used to be fair, but now it is not.<br>  I'll try to explain this as best I can. <br>  <br>  Years ago, the lawmakers made support laws; and those laws required a father to pay less support for the second and third child because it was ASSUMED that the parents had all their children together. They thought that the moms were the parent of all daddy's children. The lawmakers also assumed that the kids all live with their mother IN THE SAME PLACE. <br>  Stay with me. <br>  It used to be rare when a man would have children by two or more women, and equally as rare for a woman to have children with more than one man. The lawmakers assumed that when a man and woman divorce, the kids all had the same mother, and would all live under one roof. Since the price of keeping the roof over the children is the same whether one kid or a hundred live there, the second and third child required less money to support than the first. The lawmakers knew that, and at the time, they were right.<br>  Therefore, the man's obligation was to help the woman pay the portion of the rent that the kids needed as part of their support. <br>  <br>  However, the father got a break because the rent (and all other "fixed costs") stayed the same, no matter how many kids lived there. The mother would not from being entitled to"double support" for two kids,or "triple support" for three, because "fixed costs" stay the same, and do not increase with each subsequent child. For example, property taxes on the home where the children live do not increase, no matter the number of children who live on the property. The heat bill is the same, whether one child is being warmed, or ten.<br>  This all began to fall apart when it became more common for people to have kids with more than one person. (You've heard of a "babymomma?" "Babydaddy?") Fifty years ago, there were very few divorces, and therefore, reproducing with someone other than your husband or wife was scandalous, and rare. But now, people are living longer, and having more than one marriage is more common. On top of that, divorce laws were loosened, and divorce became much easier, and therefore, more common. So, having kids with different husbands and wives (or partners) became more common. <br>  But the law didn't catch up with the times. At present, one father may have kids living with three different mothers, and living in three different places. Because the law is outdated, the father is still not required to pay more support, even though it appears that his support payments should be equalled out and reapportioned.<br>  <br>  Just because it's the law doesn't mean it's fair. The lawmakers didn't really intend for a law to be unfair to not only mothers but children. It was the times that made the law unfair.

What do they matter if a state is going to secede?  Why quabble over details?  F the liberals and their little marxist experiment, they can have it, worry about details such as laws later.

Dictating for people to do research before they answer your question, rather than you doing research to answer your own question, is pretty lazy.  Don't you think?<br>  <br>  But, no, there is no prohibition.  But you'll have to do a little research to see if I did mine.|`|1AgD0dsBaa	You should not ask a question from people and ask them to research properly if you don't even know the answer to  your own question as for how to research. Just look back to 1864 the end of the Civil War. <br>  <br>  After the Civil War Lincoln had made all the states of the Confedracy except Kentucky and Mississipii to include in their state constitution that it would be illegal to seccede. The Union states do not have that in thier constitutions from my past research.<br>  <br>  Under Article X states have a right to excersice and over rule mandates by the Fed. Gov. However since the Reupblican Goverment under Linclon made laws to super ceed State Constitutions and The US Supreme court made it harder for States rights to exist over the Constituiton.<br>  <br>  You could do the research on the Internet.

Maybe I'm just not understanding what you mean by 'politically correct'?|`|nNmusYZSaa	I don't think it's possible to be politically correct in all you do and say, period.   I also dispute that the attempt has anything to do with patriotism.<br>  <br>  "Political correctness" is just a form of politeness, nothing more.  It doesn't restrict debate to refer to black people as African Americans, or as people of color, or whatever the ones you know prefer to be called.  It doesn't help debate to refer to gays as fagggots, or to call men with "ED" impotent.<br>  <br>  Of course, it can be taken to ridiculous extremes, but there is no harm in the basic concept until somebody totally derails the debate with endless corrections of terminology and arguments and reasons about which words may and may not be used.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Of course it's possible to be a civilized human being, who avoids hate-speech, AND be patriotic.<br>  <br>  Whoever told you not being rude and hateful prevents all debate was lying to you big time.

He used it for recreational purposes in his younger years.  It never interfered with his life like it did Rush.  Oxy is considered to be man made heroin.  It is very addictive and very controlled by the government.  Doctors and pharmacies have to report every prescription given out and who is getting it and for how long.  Unless they lie on their reports, doctors are only allowed to prescribe it to a single person for so long and then they are required to either prescribe another type of pain killer or weening the patient off of it in a certain amount of time.  For Rush to be addicted to it for so long tells me that he either doctor shopped, which is illegal, or his doctor was highly unethical and liked the money Rush was paying him more then the law.   <br>  <br>  That is why you hear more about Rush's addiction.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  #########################<br>  <br>  You tube?

An officer needs to be able to articulate mere reasonable suspicion to approach a subject, and ask the following - their name, where they're coming from, and what their destination is.  One needs to answer these questions truthfully.  If you fail to give them the correct name, this is also a crime -  a misdemeanor, Criminal Impersonation.

People then choose sides at their entry point into political consciousness. Because the underlying philosophy they support is so blatantly detached from reality it is easy to poke holes in it. Unfortunately we somehow identify with these philosophies and therefore treat it emotionally as a personal attack. This results in a display of childlike egotism which seeks to protect an immature philosophy.<br>  <br>  It is basically the same principle as religious fundamentalism. It is an immature form of understanding that when attacked , hardens around core concepts that are not well enough understood to withstand scrutiny.<br>  The danger is that the concepts may become locked into this immature state through this need to defend them. <br>  <br>  So in a way it is arrogance that refuses to admit that 'well i'm actually not conversant with the subtleties of the subject' and seeks to cover up this lack of understanding by shouting down the opposition with slogans and oversimplified point scoring tactics.<br>  <br>  The classic example of this is the cut and paste knowledge culture presented in these political question sections.|`|BWlcmjc6aa	This question got my attention because I have been thinking we should have another choice for our vote.

a8e1KcS2aa	Bail is set to ensure your appearance at court.  Once you fulfill your end of that bail agreement, your monies will be returned to you.  As far as the jail thing goes...<br>  Misdemeanors may be punishable by fines/up to 1 year in jail.  If you're record is clean, that is a mitigating circumstance.  I'd recommend getting a lawyer, or representation from the Public Defender's office.  They will be able to strike a plea bargain that will probably involve fines/community service, but no jail time.  If you got into a fight with her, did she strike you at all?  If so, especially if she was the aggressor, you can also press charges for offensive touching.  That might make her more likely to withdraw the charges, and also might be a mitigating factor in the incident.  While I am in no way a lawyer, that's generally what I've seen happen in fighting incidents and that's the course of action that I'd recommend.  And yes, she will probably be present at your court appearance as the victim, but that'd be at trial.  You have to still go to a preliminary hearing first, as I'm assuming you've already been arraigned and plead not guilty.<br>  <br>  Of course, I also assume you're a female.  If you're a male hitting women, I hope you get what you deserve, a LONG ride in the back of the police cruiser belonging to the guy who has about 30 IA's on his jacket.|`|AA11317951	dude u can't be hittin girls....no matter how much they deserve it you can't strike them.<br>  <br>  What u need to do is apologize to her, be apologetic to the court and show remorse. They usually go pretty hard on people who do that stuff but since its misdemeanor and ur first offence its likely u will get probation or comm service or something. You gotta just make it seem like ur sorry<br>  <br>  and like I said before....NEVER strike a woman no matter how much they are asking for it...it will hurt you worse in the end. Good luck
iTetA3oCaa	They should be embarrassed and should be running for cover.  One of the most often repeated campaign promises was an "end to Earmarks" yet we have had three or four bills, a few executive orders, etc. that all provide benefits to special interest groups.  Obma, pelosi, and Reid are all just passing legislation to advance a liberal democratic agenda that has failed in the past.  There is nothing that will help solve our current problems in this garbage and I hope the American people finally realize that the government can not give you anything until they take it either from you (in most cases) or from someone else that worked hard for it.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	Oh he'll sign it. Obama is a hypocrite....I believe that has been established.|`|UzRijICuaa	Democrats and republicans alike can rightly be ashamed by the earmarks in this bill.  They all need one way tickets home.

Your program will not be near as good and will cost you a lot more.Secondly insurance companies charge around 10 to 15% to administer the coverage you buy the rest of the premium is used to pay claim that you the insured have. The administrative cost of government run programs like Medicare, Medicaid, Title 19 and the Champus program all have admin. costs significantly higher then that.

3JTuL6vOaa	well unfortunately in the 90's  our foreign policy was abandon and we replaced it with cruse missiles and idol threats. This made allot of ppl mad at us and turn allot of ppl against us.  The war on terror is allot like the war on drugs. Everyone has a lot of ideas on what to do but know one knows exactly how to get it done.  It seems that when we come up with what seems to be a good plan we have to televise the debate about it for a year or better before we put the plan into action and I don't know for sure but I don't think that America has cornered the market on t.v. and we are just giving up the plan. so our enemy can regroup and figure out a way to hide from us.  Honestly I don't know what the answer is on this war strategy but someone needs to figure it out or get us out of there so our boys and girls can come home.

They do most of the grunt work and are the foundation of the army. The officers do more admin stuff like planning and signing papers all day. When you start out as an officer you go out sometimes but not often, mostly you spend your days in the talk planning things. <br>  <br>  Any officer automaticly outranks any enlisted personell. They get paid about double what enlisted men make and any enlisted personell all the way to Command Sergeant Major of the Army have to salute you. <br>  <br>  Having been in the army I honestly think being enlisted is more fun, and you get more in the mud training. Officers do get paid more however and are less often in harms way. <br>  <br>  With your degree you would start Enlisted as an E-4 (Specialist) as an officer you would start at the bottom (O-1) as a 2nd leiutenant.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: The first commentor is wrong, as an officer you get two choices, a primary and a secondary choice as to what general field you want to be an officer in (IE. Artillery, Infantry, etc.) and usually you will get your primary, however it is based on needs of the army. Enlisted you get a contract saying you have only one job and can sometimes get choice of duty station as well.

6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	If the accident is his fault your insurance company will have to take care of it. You need to check your policy to see if he's covered. If he's 25 or older he's probably is covered. <br>  <br>  If he get's pulled over drinking in your car he will get a fine.

If he can't do that for you tell him to get his own car.|`|fT365jd5aa	You both could get sued if there was an accident -- him for causing it and you for negligently entrusting him with your car (you know he's drinks in the car, and still loan him the car anyway). <br>  <br>  I know people in California who have been pulled over for a DUI while driving someone else's car.

Then you might be able to estimate how long it will take to get a job, because first the money will be pumped into the economy via giving it to the governor's of the individual states - so first your state must get the money, then your state must start projects, then your state announces jobs--usually construction jobs are the very first ones to come---the rest pretty much follows those.<br>  However, I do not believe that Obama's attempt to turn the economic freefall around will work.  The bailout of the banks has showed us how greedy those in charge really are.

AA10118655	No. It's not a crime to be receiving food stamps (unless they are stolen or forged). Companies are only looking for criminal background, and some now are looking at credit scores.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	Daze, a person's credit rating has nothing to do with their income.

It will not show up, and employer cannot hold it against you, even if he knew.<br>  Unless, of course, if you obtained the food stamps fraudulently and you were convicted for welfare fraud.|`|ylg9ejceaa	That is false. Food stamps or any type of government assistance does not show up on a backgroud or credit check. After all.. a back ground check shows criminal activity.. getting assitance is not a crime. Also, jobs can not disgrimiate against someone because of economical status. Your information is kept pretty confidential when/if you are receiving assistance.<br>  <br>  **I agree with a few others when saying just because you have food stamps or other forms of assistance does NOT mean you have bad credit! If you are "poor" and need food stamps most likey its because you lack money.. therefore more then likey dont have credit cards and loans therefore dont really have the same debt issues. Its very possible for someone to be on welfare and have a great credit score. People can be on welfare and still be financially responsible. They could just be going through a hard time, laid off from work etc....|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	No...<br>  <br>  Although if you get food stamps, that probably means you have poor or no credit.

Then I'm mad at you for getting food stamps!|`|Un3YxFvRaa	If that is true, then a huge percentage of the population in the US today under Obama's current expanded welfare state, have a problem....|`|cz5XbKfOaa	No. What people get confused about is that when apply for a job some employers will ask if you are receiving food stamps. This is only for them to get a tax break if they hire someone that is on food stamps. Telling an employer that you are receiving food stamps is optional. Background checks do not show that you are on food stamps.|`|GXxC8CIfaa	There is no way they can find out that information by doing a background check on you.|`|5nAnWp3daa	looks good that you are working out of it. i rather you on food stamps than robbing and selling drugs.
d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Have they ever? The answer is no. Partisan politics will always exist. Presidents enjoy more or less support based on their actions while in office, but Lincoln had it right.<br>  <br>  "You can please some of the people all of the time, You can please all of the people some of the time, but you cannot please all of the people all of the time."|`|55NKPb82aa	The President is merely the most important among a large number of public servants. He should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct, his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal, able, and disinterested service to the Nation as a whole. Therefore it is absolutely necessary that there should be full liberty to tell the truth about his acts, and this means that it is exactly necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right. <br>  <br>  Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. <br>  <br>  Nothing but the truth should be spoken about him or any one else. But it is even more important to tell the truth, pleasant or unpleasant, about him than about any one else.|`|75358d4fb890522547a8f3145f0b6fbeaa	Yes, some people are very mature when it comes to politics.<br>  <br>  For instance, look at my parents.

They taught my sister and me to think for ourselves and respect everyone's right to their own opinions.<br>  <br>  I grew up to be a moderate conservative, my sister grew up to be a liberal.  She is my best friend.  I married a conservative man, she married a liberal man.  They love each other like brothers.<br>  <br>  It is all about respect and civility.<br>  <br>  As to being happy with the current President - that will be determined by if I believe his actions are what is best for our country or not.  If his actions are best for our country, I will be very happy with him.  If they are not what is best for our country, then I won't be happy with him.

Electing a man for president because, "Hey, wouldn't it be fun to elect a BLACK guy?"  was not the way to get a skilled leader.<br>  <br>  Obama is bad for this nation, I hope he fails soon and badly. <br>  <br>  NOBAMA!|`|wCdfMZdFaa	Considering less than half of the country voted for him, I wouldnt think so.<br>  <br>  If you want maturity study policy not politicians.|`|D9AUzmZRaa	Mature people ARE mature when it comes to politics.|`|G2PRIe3laa	Were Cubans happy with Castro|`|lFzFtiCBaa	not til 1776 comes back around....|`|f36a70ysaa	Mature people are.|`|SPsYrJJEaa	No and NO.!!|`|CM1dfztQaa	You can please some of the people all of the time, all of the people some of the time, but never all of the people all of the time...I think that's how the saying goes.<br>  <br>  About the maturity deal, I don't see that happening on this site. There are too many kids that get on here just to stir the pot. The best thing we can all do is ignore them. I'm guilty of letting it get to me from time to time, but I decided to stop answering most of the ones who spew hate.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	No and No.<br>  <br>  That is why we have an election between all of the parties - so all sides of the arguments can be heard, and the loudest one wins.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	yes, if you are around classy people they are very happy with the President. I am fortuate to have over 100 democrats that I call friends & they all are very happy with our President. They don't hang out in places like this.|`|4TT8lSgwaa	People get mature during their last breath and none of any presidents ever pleased every body.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	Most of us are quite happy.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	No and uh....let me think....NO!
ndQkhqZeaa	Jeez Mr. Williams! Can you read? She said dated--that means past tense.<br>  <br>  With all that anger you might be going to hell.<br>  <br>  You should try searching the sate data base.|`|Zm8sQpKLaa	sometimes. There are times that part of the deal is that they are only required to register for a specified amount of time. Also, skip the national database register and go with your state assuming that your state has one.<br>  <br>  A temporary protective order sounds great, but they aren't passed out like game pieces at McDonald's. You have to have a reason to get one against someone.<br>  <br>  The fact that he tried to contact you once probably isn't going to be enough to get a TRO. <br>  <br>  Contact your local police department and ask them about him, if he is in the registry they will know, they will know where he lives and just about anything else there is to know about him.<br>  <br>  Good job on being cautious.|`|QjdHnrZiaa	Get a restraining order, and they have to contact him.  Then you know where he is.|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	Get a restraining order and contact your local authorities on the subject.

AA11494150	If you are just paying the ticket, the amount will stand. <br>  <br>  If you contested the ticket, and the facts came out in court that your actual speed was higher, they could raise the cost.|`|tPvjd8qqaa	The judge could raise the penalty but it isn't likely.  But what usually happens if you go to court, is that they charge you court costs which can easily double the price of the ticket.  If there is more likelihood of you being found guilty than not, you'd be better off just paying the price as listed for this one.  Or if traffic school is an option, do that.|`|dzgt4PEGaa	Are you required to go to court? Usually if you are give a price, you can pay that and it is an admission of guilt.
WBwlKbLeaa	Besides that he is a piece of dung, I believe he had an unregistered gun and some drugs.
04zSamlHaa	Wel in Fla and most states, when you receive a ticket, your options for resolving the matter are printed on the back of the citation. You need to take action toward one of those options within 30 days of the citation date. If you don't do one of the options or notify the court your drivers license will be suspended.|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	They will come to your home and Tazer you.  It hurts like a b itch, but only for a little while.<br>  <br>  If you're not a terrorist, then you won't mind the pain.  Only terrorists complain about law enforcement.|`|zejFr1Ciaa	If you ignore it long enough a warrant will be issued for your arrest. I would suggest you contact the courts and see if you can set up a payment schedule that both of you can live with.|`|lcNQ2w57aa	First off you should receive a ticket for your first grade writing style. I find it hard to believe you're old enough to drive a car. Second, if you're so irresponsible that you can't look into what steps you need to do to take care of a ticket and wait a month later and ask in a yahoo group, perhaps the bus is more your speed.<br>  <br>  You have the option of making payments on your fine, but personally I think you won't even do that right. Just ignoring it turns it into a warrant for your arrest and I think that is most likely the most realistic outcome of this situation.|`|oAOUAVVAaa	If you don't pay the ticket, they will suspend your license, and it will stay suspended until you have paid the ticket.  No warrant for your arrest or anything like that.  All you have to do is pay the ticket and all will be good.
