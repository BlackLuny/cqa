20090222044459AAPK5jT	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What is the most used feminist buzz word?	"Patriarchy" (and variations thereof) or "misogyny" (and variations thereof).  These two words have lost their meaning they are used so redundantly.        Let me put it another way using a drinking game analogy:  One side takes a drink when the word patriarchy (+ variations) is used, the other takes a drink when the word misogyny (+ variations) is used.    Who passes out and/or pukes first?

This is long so I tried my best to shorten it      …me & my guy friend have our ups and downs    …started developing feelings over the years    …turned into something way deeper.    …think he may not want to ruin the friendship by getting into a relationship.       …Life is short    …we known each other for almost 4 years   …still just friends.    …Reallllly close friends.    …confused    …he said the L word and I couldn’t say anything back...    …because I felt he never saw me like that    …I mean were just friends right?    …wasn’t a friendly love ya either.    ...don’t understand    ...he said it and he still doesn’t show it.    ...We are still just friends.   ...he’s slowly showing it    ...but life is short    ...tried the moving on so many times    ...doesn’t even work anymore.    ...I have tried many times to talk to him.    ...I mean reallly talk to him. I almost give up.         I’m a strong woman but sometimes I get upset and it hurts. But he’s never ever seen my pain.       So with reading my summary here are my questions.      1. If he saw my pain would he come around? I don’t have forever      2. Is it a good idea to hang out with him and hopefully get through to him?      3.*******(BIG QUESTION) he's basically going to think " here we go again" if i try to talk to him AGAIN. I really need to know if this is going anywhere and if not i need to move on. So.... how do I talk to him again to where he will listen to me.   so..... What should I do???

20090222130033AARdmXe	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Should domestic abuse suspects get to keep their guns?	article:    http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...       excerpts:   Any changes would come too late for Gail Pumphrey and her three children, David, Megan and Brandon, who were fatally shot Thanksgiving Day 2007 by her ex-husband during a custody handoff in a Damascus park. Or Destiny and Richard Spicknall, ages 3 and 2, who were shot to death by their father after he bought a handgun in Howard County. Or Mary Crawford, whose ex-husband fired a shotgun at her in their Carroll County home, narrowly missing her. Each woman had obtained a protective order, but the men either were allowed to keep their guns or to purchase another one. Pumphrey's former husband killed himself; Richard Spicknall and Steve Crawford were convicted.          Judges in Maryland and Virginia are allowed to order firearms removed after a court hearing in which a final protective order is issued, but the law does not require it. In Maryland, that authority is limited to handguns; judges can't take rifles. Nor can Maryland judges confiscate guns when a judge issues a temporary protective order limiting a suspect's contact with a victim for a week, a time when passions in domestic conflicts can be red hot and violence is possible.         As of Jan. 29, there were 7,230 final and temporary protective orders open in Maryland. Of the people under such orders, 132 had firearms registered with the state police.

20090222164509AAo1wQ7	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why is it that star athletes usually do not make great coaches, but medicore athletes do?	Magic Johnson was not a very good coach. He didn't like it, was constantly frustrated, and the players weren't fond of his coaching style either. His only coaching year was also the lone year in the 90's that the Lakers did not make the playoffs.      Michael Jordan is said to not be a great general manager. He was responsible for picking some players in the first round that turned out to be scrubs.      However, Steelers coach Mike Tomlin played football in college but wasn't good enough to make the NFL. But, he has a Superbowl Ring as well as a "coach of the year" award.      Phil Jackson was a mediocre player in the NBA yet is considered one of the greatest coaches of all time.      And there are other examples but there's no need to go on.       Why do star players tend to be mediocre coaches? One theory I can come up with is that star players have extremely high standards that most players cannot meet.

20090222165915AA5otfp	Social Science;Psychology	How can I learn to trust others and accept their kindness?	I live in a very argumentative family. No one in my family gets along. My mom's side of my family and my dad's side hate each other (and my mom and my father's mother especially hate each other). My father does nearly nothing for me. His mom talks trash about my mom (even when I'm in her house. She thinks I can't hear her). My father is also raising his girlfriend's son (who isn't his) who's a big troublemaker. He cuts school a lot, steals from my father and runs away from home. He even attempted to molest me once.      When I was younger, my mother used to spank me with a belt when I misbehaved. She denies it, saying it never happened, but I completely remember. All it really did is make me very scared of her and to be at home. I always forgot what I did wrong within a few hours. All I remembered was the spanking and I repeated whatever it was I did wrong. School was the only place I felt safe, simply because hitting wasn't allowed.      My family also yells and criticizes me a lot and for pretty much everything. My hair, my taste in clothes, what I like to watch on TV. Just about everything! They rarely have anything nice to say, whether it's about me or another family member.      My family has always been this way and because of it, I have a lot of problems with myself. I've been depressed since I was 11 (I'm 14, about 15 now), I've repeatedly thought about suicide and I've run away from home three times. But mostly I have a very hard time trusting other people. When someone says something about me or tries to help me with something, I find it so strange. I think they're doing it because they have to rather than that they care or they're just trying to be nice.      I'm trying to overcome this, but it's so hard. No one in my family is a good role model for me, so I have to follow what other people do to learn what's right. I mean I understand what kindness and trust is, but it still seems strange to me because I'm not used to it. I'm suspicious of everybody. How does a person learn to trust and accept kindness when they haven't seen it enough?

I eventually landed on the bed and then I woke up...      #2 Again I thought I was awake in the dream. I was lying in bed and there's someone in the room who looked like my mum. I thought it was her and said what's going on. Then her face changed and it was actually the 'devil'. He started talking in this weird horrible voice but I couldn't hear what he was saying. I tried to scream but I could only whisper as he was coming closer to me. Then I woke up in my bed...      Help please? It would really be appreciated. Thank you!
20090222155959AA1CDa6	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	So you want equality?  Or do you want a pro-feminist society?	How about equal rulings in divorce and child custody cases?  Women, by a large margin, tend to get custody of children and also recieve the largest amount of assets (I presume because of the children?)      How about equal (or atleast some power for both parents) in regards to whether or not to abort or keep a child?  It's her body, but it's THEIR child.      How about equal consideration for employment (not enforced preference for females)?  Does affirmative action even make sense as a tool of equality?  In time, females WILL gain equal representation in the workforce WITHOUT affirmative action.      How about equal sentences for the same crimes?  Period.      How about equal requirements for the more physically demanding careers.  It's not about sexism, it's about ability.      How about less fundraising for single-gender issues and concentration on what would benefit us all?      I'm all for equality, lets do it.

I went back to bed and the second dream happened   The second one was taking place at my residence (I was at home at the time of the dream) and my best friend's boyfriend raped me (I didn't actually see the rape).  She was in the shower and came out and was talking about it with me.  I didn't want to tell her who did it. It was really weird.     Any ideas about what these might mean?   Thanks

A) Price declines, shifts supply curved to the left   B) Lower price, shifts demand curve to the left   C) Lower price, shifts demand curve to the right   D) Lower price increases the real income of buyers enbabling them to buy more      im thinking it's C but not sure...am i right?

20090222173944AAj7pVD	Social Science;Psychology	How to cope with death?	my beloved father passed away last month from a horrific accident at work. He was on a ladder fixing a sign, got electrocuted and thrown off..and died in the hospital 2 days later after being declared brain dead, paralyzed, broken ribs and spine, and eventually all his organs burned up from the electricity that never left his body.      His death was so horrible and sad, and he was truly an AMAZINGG person...so our whole family is having a terrible time getting through each day. I cant figure out what he ever did to deserve such a death, because he was sooooooo nice to everyone, ALWAYS always smiling, extremely hard working, self-less, caring, and just wonderful person all around. He always made the world around him smile.      Also, his mother (my grandmother) is absolutely devastated, and I feel so bad for her because they had such a close relationship      any kind words of advice?? (nothing religious please)

So Mike and Kim have been together for a few years,   Kim love's Mike with all her heart but Mike has lied to kim many times,   because of this Kim cant bring herself to trust Mike!

Mike also says he may not ever get back with Kim!      Kim is destroyed as she loves Mike very much and cant bear to live without him!   if Kim was your best friend or even a stranger, what advise would you give her?     or   How would Kim make Mike fall in love with her again?

And if you don't know what other countries think, what do you think?    I believe: Obama is turning into a dictator, and we are turning into a socialist nation. And he is ruining an economy that isn't in as bad shape as he claims.

20090222175240AAlRuqM	Social Science;Psychology	Who can you trust these days?	i dont know what happened or why ive been like this, but ive been through a lot in the past few years and have pretty much isolated myself from a lot of people. i was so great in high school had so many friends and in so many clubs, but now because of all ive been through, its like psychological that i cant seem to be social as before and make good friends.  i feel like many people are fake.  i find someone who i can talk with and have a good time but when they are around other people they act different. i dont know if its me that has the problem or everyone else, but the worst part is letting someone get too close or personal because how are you supposed to trust them? i am starting to be confused about my own identity because everyone else is so inconsistent. its just crazy. should i see a school counselor or something?
20090222165535AA70lwO	Social Science;Anthropology	Who is to say that our lives are more important than the lives of animals?	Okay, granted... we are at the top of the food chain. Bravo. Most of us being meat-eaters, we've probably eaten a good few cows, pigs etc etc But whenever you observe an animal's behaviour (or even an insect's) you can see how responsive it is to pain. You touch a spider and adrenaline will ignite through it's body, making it sprint away from danger. Animals look after their offspring and make sure they are fed. So how do we honestly know that are lives are more important and that animals don't matter?

All the same kids and teachers where there. But we were in a wierd country and there where hardly any people around. but chickens where there. I picked up a baby chick. I put it back down adn i began crying like it was in pain.    Then we later found out it broke its leg and we had to ride in a helicopter na dtry to figure out who did it. I thought i did but turned out it was some boy.    Then there was another part of it where we were at another part and watching them put a chick into a grinder thing to make a chicken nugget. It was just a baby chicken flat. I was offered one but told them i was a vegetarian(which i am) and they said take it so i did and it apparently tasted normal. While they were grinding it my ex who i still ahve feelings for, had their arm around me and hand on my butt.      Then all my friends where on my bus and coming back to my house for one reason or another, and i was sitting with my ex and passing things up and music playing and i was laughing and having a fun time. Then i woke up.....

20090222163434AAF2sd4	Social Science;Psychology	How would you react in this situation? please read?	Please read. I'll make this as short as I can. My sister found out she was pregnant instead of being honest with her best friend at the time she told some phony random lies to her to cover up the truth, she acted really weird. I guess it was her way off handling the pressure situation. She called her up the next day to apologize(her friend knew she was lieng at the time) but her friend felt so hurt and betrayed she cut her out of her life. My sister later went to her house and bought her chocolate. But she wanted nothing to do with her.       How would you react to my sister in this situation?      Is her best friend being selfish and overreacting?      Would you look past the lie and help her through the situation or drop her because she lied to your face and cant be trusted again?   Be Honest      My sister later found out she wasnt pregnant by the way

20090222175812AA1xdJk	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	How come some people can't accept that most feminist are bi?	Why can't they?  I'm bi and so are a lot of other feminist on this board and in real life.  A lot of us are attracted to girls and feel aroused by watching 2 women together.  Why do some deny it?  Look at most women on this board, they are mostly bisexual or bi-curious.  It's one of the main reasons I became a feminist because a lot of girls at my college who were bisexual were into feminism and equal rights.  I'm very supportive of equal rights and it was a secure way to meet other women into the same things.

20090222181431AAUOJjg	Social Science;Psychology	Read below...! its a long and interesting read?	The question is too long really to put in the question box so this will have to do!      I have this overwhelming urge to drop everything I know as order and succomb to the chaos that is uncertainty... there is only so much we can explain within our normal parameters that it seems stupid to not try and explore the powers of our own mind - which after all is the only key we have to existence. If we are granted the possibilities of exploration should we not undergo them? There is such a realm of wonder out (in) there that we cannot imagine... dimensions, beings, emotions, colours.... It is so conceited to repeat the mundane steps and rituals we take every day, accepting this is all there is to be had, without ACTUALLY experiencing the miracle of life, soul, god, existence...      It has been assumed, by the worlds greatest minds, that there may be more than 10 dimensions in effect at one time in the universe. we can understand 3, or perhaps 4 depending on our interpretation of time.  This could account for our flagrant inability to explain or understand the existence of the very everything we exist within - what was there before the big bang? what is the universe expanding into? what is god?...      well my proposition is that THIS IS GOD! The miracle of experience, of vision, of question      but we are only experiencing a fraction of everything that experience has to offer. There are dimensions which we can only reach through psychedelia, DMT produces remarkable and similar spiritual experiences - something which cannot be measured within our own conscious dimensions - yet is undeniably there.      does anyone else want to explore like this? the very miracle of dreaming is an extension of the godly ability to trip into the universe as we dont know it.    there are questions which cannot be written in words, and answers which can only be expressed in emotion such as confusion - there are entire worlds within us that extend beyond our normal parameters, mazes of logic, the paradox of uncertainty....      it seems so stupid to accept our everyday lives as life when there are so many things to experience beyond our control!   lose yourselves, take a leap, ask the question....      is this really real?

20090222190249AAHS7Gh	Social Science;Psychology	Would u think she's clingy or needy?	Your friend is VERY shy and quiet. She opened up to you in the past year when you both worked together. But unless you're face to face, she will only communicate via the internet or text message. Never calls you. She sent you a text inviting you out to dinner with a bunch of her friends. You weren't able to go but thanked her for thinking of you. She wrote back "no problem for thinking of you. You're always welcome. Miss you"      Would you think this shy friend is clingy or needy?

20090222184516AAZhS7n	Social Science;Psychology	I still have imaginary friends?	All through High School I never made an attempt to make real friends and relationships because I always knew I had my Imaginary Friends who'd never betray me. Nowadays, I'm about 40-50 (I'm not telling you my exact age because I'm afraid of giving too much information to "real" people), I live with my mom in her basement, and I don't know any real people besides my mom, the clerk at the store, and my mailman. I don't like to talk to any of them except for my mom (whom I continually hit on), and the mailman whom I hit with a baseball bat if he tries to get to close to my mom.      I don't have any real friends because I have my imaginary friends. One of them is a Power Ranger (I love that show- I have all the seasons and action figures), one's a dragon (I've always nursed a soft spot when it comes to dragons), one's a mini Hitler in dog form, and one is scary clown who attracts little children into his van by offering them candy. Although they aren't the best of people, they're fine once you get to know them.      The problem is, my mom has been trying to get my involved with "real" people. What's the difference between real and imaginary people? I've lived so long without knowing real people, I think I've forgotten the difference. Is there one? What's so great about "real" people? Real people can hurt you, and scary clown doesn't it like it when I hurt...      I hope I've explained my predicament well enough, so I guess my question is this: "Is there a problem with how I'm living my life?" Is there anything wrong with having imaginary friends? I'm happy how I am, but sometimes I wonder what life would be like with the paranoia and pills I go through everyday.

20090222191708AAWDd41	Social Science;Economics	Hard economics question... can you get the answer?	When government spending increases, the aggregate demand curve   A) shifts to the left because the higher level of government spending raises the interest rate and lowers total spending.   B) does not shift.   C) shifts to the left because private spending is being crowded out.   D) shifts to the right because more output is being demanded at every price level.   E) shifts to the right because a reduction in the price level causes the interest rate to be reduced and thereby stimulates spending.
