ek8iGsRfaa	it's a very slow read, but it's a good book. I think it would have been illegal in Germany too. That part was very weird. It's even weirder in the movie because the boy looks so young and she people mistake her for his mother and what not. It's just a weird story overall, but it definitely makes you think.

Q4jsE1cFaa	Ah. Yes. I had this debate in class once. I was randomly selected to be on the "for side" and I was beaten by the "against" side.<br>  Here were some good points made by the other team:<br>  1. There were thousands of Innocent women and children who died or became sick due to multiple radiation effects. If you really want to get them, describe how they were incinerated instantly and left an ashy shadow on the ground where they were standing or mention the sicknesses in detail.<br>  2. The war was going to end anyways. Japan was weakened and was slowly collapsing. War costs and casualties were slowly forcing Japan to surrender and it was predicted they would have surrendered within the month.<br>  3. Always try to hit emotional strings, if the debate allows for it. Mention how this destroyed their economy, Mention how the major damage of the city has permanently impacted their culture. Mention child deaths and women deaths.<br>  4. There is a great end all line. It was used and then the teacher ended the debate. "If America was able to create such a devastating weapon, America should have been able forge peace equally as powerful." If there is a closing statement part, use this. If not, use this as a device to get you out of any corner they try to throw you in.

They had tons of industry.<br>  <br>  So the South could not make or craft anything in large numbers, such as clothing, guns, ships, cannons, tents  and bullets.

QUjJELtVaa	This poem has always kind of always summed up for me what a lot of people seem to do when those around them are being persecuted.  Absolutely early on Hitler could have been stopped but I think by the time people really understood what was going on they couldn't.  <br>  <br>  <br>     In Germany, they came first for the Communists, And I didn’t speak up because I wasn’t a Communist;<br>  <br>      And then they came for the trade unionists, And I didn’t speak up because I wasn’t a trade unionist;<br>  <br>      And then they came for the Jews, And I didn’t speak up because I wasn’t a Jew;<br>  <br>      And then . . . they came for me . . . And by that time there was no one left to speak up.|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	Well it documented fact that those who refuse to participate. Nothing happened to them so it was pretty much a choice thing to an extent. Unfortunately Hitler starter most of his people really young so they were more brain washed to follow orders. The ones that were older, just didn't want to loose their position or status. So no I think it was going to happen anyway.
AA10923178	The French were interested in the rich fishing grounds off the Canadian coast from the 1500s. A little later they were interested in furs in the interior like in the Ohio Valley. They built settlements and forts along the St. Lawrence River and the Mississippi, Missouri & Ohio River Basin.to protect their trade routes with the Indians. After the voyages of Columbus the Spanish founded settlements throughout the Caribbean, South America and what later became the southwestern part of the United States. They were mostly interested in gold. They were also interested in converting the native peoples to Christianity.Like the French they founded forts and settlements. They established missions throughout the American southwest in California, New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas for this purpose. The Spanish called their North American lands "New Spain". Thr French called their North American lands "New France." An example of their rivalry was in  Florida which was contested between the French and Spanish, The French at Ft. Caroline and the Spanish at St. Augustine attacked each other. I hope that this has been a help to you.
Bkl0515eaa	1) The atomic bombs violated the rules of war.<br>  Using any type of weapon in deliberate, indiscriminate attacks against civilians was and is against the rules, customs, and laws of war, as described in the Geneva Conventions, Hague Conventions, a 1938 League of Nations Resolution, a 1961 UN resolution (General Assembly 1653), and the Just War tradition of the Roman Catholic Church dating back hundreds of years. The purpose and effect of the bombs was not to destroy military personnel or weapons, but to cause as much civilian death and devastation as possible in order to intimidate the Japanese government into surrender. If somebody did that to us, we would call it terrorism.<br>  Your opposition has two choices: 1) they can say that the rules of war must be followed by everyone, in which case it is logical to conclude that we broke the rules by dropping the bombs; or 2) it is OK for us to break the rules when we feel it is necessary. Most Americans believe #2. But that is a clear case of hypocrisy and double standards. Another way to make the point would be to ask how they would like it if someone did it to us. For example, if the Native Americans had nukes, could they drop it on Washington DC to prevent the Americans from taking over their land. Almost everyone who ever fought a war believes they have good reasons to kill the civilians. Without rules, everyone would do it.<br>  The opposition might argue that there were no international laws against the use of atomic bombs at the time. That is technically true, but that would be the same as saying since there were no laws against slavery until the Thirteenth Amendment was adopted in 1865, all slavery committed before that was OK. Law or no law, killing civilians in war was and is recognized as wrong by almost all civilized people. Another example is the human sacrifices performed by the ancient Aztecs. Although there were no laws against it at the time, most modern civilized people would say that practice was immoral.<br>  <br>  2) Is it OK to aim for civilians if they live near military targets? Some may argue that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were in fact military targets, containing manufacturing facilities, and in the case of Nagasaki there was Sasebo Naval Base about 10 miles away. But then, why were the bombardier aiming points the exact centers of both cities? Would it be OK for an enemy to aim for Staples Center in central Los Angeles to take out Los Angeles Air Force Base 10 miles to the southwest, Northrop Grumman 7 miles west, and JPL 10 miles to the Northeast, along with hundreds of thousands of civilians in between. Or aim for downtown Norfolk to take out Norfolk Naval Base 5 miles to the north. Or Balboa Park in downtown San Diego to take out North Island Naval Air Station 2 miles to the west and San Diego Naval base 3 miles to the south.  It may take decades or centuries, but eventually the hypocrisy of the US slaughter of German and Japanese civilians will be acknowledged. Again, the opposition has two choices: either the rules are applied equally for everyone, or they can be hypocrites and say the rules apply to everyone except us.<br>  <br>  3) Is it OK to kill hundreds of thousands of civilians even if their nation is militarily defeated and no longer a threat? Just because their leaders are too stupid to realize when they are defeated, innocent people must die? Japan is an island nation, and its strategic offensive capability is based entirely on naval power. By 1945 Japan's navy was destroyed. We had 30 heavy aircraft carriers (Essex class and similar) to their none. We had 10 new battleships (Iowa and South Dakota classes) and 15 older battleships (North Carolina, Colorado, and Pennsylvania classes) to their none. We had hundreds of cruisers, destroyers, and submarines to their less than fifty. We had 30,000 aircraft in the Pacific and 40,000 in Europe to their 5,000. We had 30 million tons of commerical merchant ships to their 1 million tons (soon to be zero thanks to our submarines). Looking at these numbers, you don't have to be an Annapolis graduate to see that they were not a threat. The US Navy had Japan completely surrounded. Nothing was getting in or out, they were completely cut off. Without steel and oil, they could only build wooden ships powered by sails and oars. No matter how you slice it, they were done, even if their leaders (and ours?) were too dumb and stubborn to see it. We could have maintained a strategic quarantine on them for decades with no trouble, and they would be trapped on their little islands for as long as we felt necessary.<br>  Most Americans say the atomic bombs were necessary to prevent an invasion that would have cost millions of lives. But was an invasion really necessary? Japan was completely defeated, and they did not have the ability to harm anyone. As long as our navy had them surrounded, it was impossible for them to rebuild and make new threats.<br>  <br>  4) An invasion would have been a senseless waste of lives. Such a costly action would only be morally justified to eliminate a dire threat to our nation. By that time of the war, Japan was not a threat. The only real purpose of invasion, or the atomic bombs, was revenge. Is revenge a good reason to kill hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians? Some people say the Japanese civilians were not innocent, that they allowed their government to commit war crimes. But that is the same argument Bin Laden used for the 9/11 attacks, that American civilians are guilty for the "evil" policies of the US government. Why is it OK for us to kill civilians, but nobody else can kill civilians?<br>  <br>  5) Is it OK to kill civilians as penalty for the crimes committed by their evil leaders? The Geneva Conventions prohibit killing people for crimes they did not personally commit. Again, either the rules are the same for everyone, or we are above the law.<br>  <br>  I would concentrate on the rule of law, and the concept that the rule of law should be the same for everyone. Try make the point that we consider ourselves above the law, that we don't have to follow the rules, but everyone else does. And we don't get punished for breaking the rules, because we are stronger than everyone else.|`|280dd58dd120cca55b24aed29c6b90beaa	Why are you in the opposition ?<br>  <br>  The fact is that President Truman ordered that a Commission be made up to analize the two alternatives  A) Not droping the bomb. <br>                       B) Droping  the bomb <br>  With the object of calculating as tight as posible the number of casualties that Americans as well as Japanese would have with each alternative.<br>  The commission was presided by a top notch scientist of the time William Bradford Shockley (Nobel Price 1956 - Physics) considered by TIME magazine as the best scientist of the century. <br>  The final results were as follows:<br>  <br>  A) Not droping the bomb.<br>  From 2 to 5 million american casualties due to the order given by the Japanese military in line with the "Bushido" code of honor NOT to surrender and that all japanese should give their life for their emperor. The total japanese population was obliged to resist the americans. <br>  Rifles and guns were distributed to all the  population. When these were not enough, sharpened bambo spears and axes were distributed to women,  young boys and girls, to kill americans. <br>  Two million Japanese soldiers were also present to defend their  sacred mainland.<br>  Japanese, would have around 10 million deaths.<br>  <br>  B) Droping the bomb  <br>  American casualties : Cero <br>  Japanese casualties :  Maximum 200,000<br>  <br>  Finally there  was a total of 160,000 japanese dead. Adding  up Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br>  <br>  The result of the Commission was handed to President Truman with the following comment : <br>  <br>  "If you choose not to drop the bomb, tomorrow you could be accused as responsible for the <br>  unneccessary  death of 5 million american boys".<br>  Immediately Truman ordered  the bomb to be dropped. <br>  Droping the bomb saved millions of lives, American as well as Japanese.<br>  <br>  In truth, the opinion in favor not to drop the bomb<br>  is  well intentioned and idealistic but does not consider the over all convenience of using it  to end the war and  SAVE ON BOTH SIDES, MILLIONS OF LIVES . The contrary would have been an undiscribable useless carnage and tears in american homes. <br>  These are cold facts.<br>  I would have liked to be on your side.<br>  Can you still switch sides??

f4d1b694bbe5d754965c49f945a6756daa	It was just barely a victory. The main thing it did was to force Lee to withdraw his army back into Virginia. <br>  <br>  When he was not pursued by the Army of the Potomac, he was allowed to regroup. I don't know why, McClellan seems to have imagined there was some huge force waiting for Lee in the Valley, and thought his battered army was too weary and depleted to pursue them. Little Mac had a tendency to imagine much larger forces against him than there actually were. <br>  <br>  He had basically created that army, reorganized it and disciplined it and revitalized it, giving it the kind of morale that took the soldiers through some very rough times. He may have become so attached to his soldiers that he didn't want to risk them to enough of a degree that they could accomplish their ultimate objective. That's one thing  that command places in a person's path, that need to separate themselves enough so that they can hazard a risk for the greater purpose, and then try to cope with the grief of the losses. <br>  <br>  It's a very delicate balance. Grant didn't seem to have that problem, and to some, including Mrs. Lincoln, he was a "butcher" because of it. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Finally, with the withdrawal of Lee back across the Potomac into Virginia, Lincoln had the victory he needed to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which required the Army of the Potomac to reclaim territory in order to make it stick, something which at the time, they had shown no particular ability to do.|`|7d4296b653689a306cac74432add2e63aa	In the first place, the Union "victory" at Antietam is a debateable notion. In fact, the battle essentially a bloody stalemate. Politically, Lincoln used the notion of the self-proclaimed victory as a pretext for issuing the Emancipation Proclamation.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	Although Lee had won a narrow tactical victory at Antietam,his severe losses (added to those at Second Bul Run the previous month) caused him to abandon his invasion of the North and retreat back to Virginia.This outcome gave Lincoln sufficient confidence to issue the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on slavery (23 September) which effectively doomed the Confederacy's hopes of international recognition by foreign governments, particularly Britain and France, something which had seemed all too possible just weeks before.<br>   Thus, at the strategic and political level it was the Federal Government that gained most from the outcome of the battle, making it one of the most decisive engagements of the whole Civil War.

This gives her haunting beauty, but also marks her as a Graceling. Gracelings are beings with special talents—swimming, storytelling, dancing. Katsa's Grace is considered more useful: her ability to fight (and kill, if she wanted to) is unequaled in the seven kingdoms. Forced to act as a henchman for a manipulative king, Katsa channels her guilt by forming a secret council of like-minded citizens who carry out secret missions to promote justice over cruelty and abuses of power. Combining elements of fantasy and romance, Cashore skillfully portrays the confusion, discovery, and angst that smart, strong-willed girls experience as they creep toward adulthood. Katsa wrestles with questions of freedom, truth, and knowing when to rely on a friend for help. This is no small task for an angry girl who had eschewed friendships (with the exception of one cousin that she trusts) for her more ready skills of self-reliance, hunting, and fighting. Katsa also comes to know the real power of her Grace and the nature of Graces in general: they are not always what they appear to be.|`|XKWJg9Ruaa	Try The Mediator Series by Jenny Carroll [aka Meg Cabot]<br>  Normally I don't like Cabot's books, but this series was good.|`|hqhQPUPMaa	The Lord Of the Rings is excellent, but it's hard to read for younger ppl.

That was a powerful story.|`|7eEEIJlcaa	im pretty sure it means that by writing he learns all there is to learn<br>  in other words he doesnt just write to teach other people, he learns from it too....i think<br>  i hope this helps!|`|zxhppf3Caa	Well, If this quote is him referring to writing "Night" or anything about the Holocaust, he probably means that by writing down his experiences he is attempting to understand them: why did the holocaust happen? Why was he able to survive when he watched so many around him die? Writing allows you to pour all of your emotion and experience out, giving you the ability to look at what your thoughts in a more objective light. <br>  Perhaps this is what he meant.|`|TYzNTT7caa	There are two reasons to write: to make others understand what you say but, surprisingly, in writing one discovers an order and significance that one did not know was there before one started. Therefore, writing educates the author as much as it may the reader.|`|R02aazVdaa	He wants the reader to understand his story, but also he tries to understand his own experiences whilst writing.|`|l9Xg8Dv4aa	James, another way to say this is: I teach in order that I may learn.|`|1jMwr6E0aa	"I write to understand as much as to be understood"<br>  <br>  Simply put I would say that the path of becoming a writer leads to a deeper understanding of not only yourself, but of your characters. I've heard several authors talk about how once they pen the characters they take on a life of their own, and they don't know more about them than the reader does. The conflicts and the themes in their writings often stem from personal experiences. People write about situations because they want to understand them better. The easiest way to understand something is to try to put yourself in someone elses shoes and imagine the situation was happening that way. As a writer trying to understand things about yourself you have to write for all parties involved. This means you need to understand the motives, influences, and points of view from characters that may be nothing like you. Lastly, writing is of course a means of expressing youself. So the second part of the quote is self explanatory. Wiesel wants to be understood as much as anyone else.|`|uy7XEPrbaa	This quote means that Elie is trying to use his writing as a way to just get it all out and try to understand why certain things in his life happened. Being a Holocaust survivor, Elie was emotionally scarred for the rest of his life after going through what he went through, and he never really understood why it all happened. He is trying to show others how cruel people can be and is trying to teach others to learn from their mistakes, as well as him learning from the mistakes of the Nazis.|`|cP041buKaa	i think it means that he(or she) writes so he(or she) can understand what they cant, and so that other people can understand and so that people understand him/her|`|Z7Lq05q2aa	by writing, he understands himself better<br>  and thats as much of a reason, if not more, that he writes compared to some people who write to explain themselves to others|`|IYedguFpaa	He writes to understand his experiences better, and for people to understand them too?|`|hoDOnzMzaa	HE WRITES ENOUGH TO BE UNDERSTOOD|`|aAernkJkaa	It means that from writing novels he learns a lot he doesn't just teach people he learns things for himself

AA10209040	I didn't like it the first time I read it, but it was better the second time around. I still think the ending is stupid (he had a C-section? Really?). It is similar to Julius Caesar (I haven't read Richard III), but Julius Caesar focuses more on politics whereas Macbeth is more about human nature.
PYOn4jL2aa	its really good!
3CzjZNUfaa	I don't think Claudius ever feels sorry, and I don't think he's a good king. I don't think Hamlet's looking for a "romantic revenge" per se, he just wants revenge. I also think you have too much plot summary, as opposed to analysis, but depending on who you're writing this for, that might be okay. Also, you spelled "world" wrong in there somewhere, and forgot the e on the end of shakespeare in the first sentence.<br>  <br>  Really though, it's a fine essay. I don't like it, but I doubt I could write a better one.

7f7aa0ea5dc924471fffd54e742f67ddaa	I would say that 1968 was not a bad year for the U. S. in history, just because Richard "Tricky Dicky" Nixon became the President, because the people in power were nearly pooping in their pants when they saw the revolution about to occur in their own back yard!<br>  <br>  The Yippies at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.<br>  <br>  No "light at the end of the tunnel" in the war in Vietnam. Barricades in Paris, protesters in Mexico City. The very real threat that socialism was the dominant ideology, and that America's support for dictatorships in Latin America, and in Asia was exposed and ridiculed. <br>  <br>  For the politicians, like Nixon, who made a career of anti-communism, 1968 was a "bad year" in America, because it appeared they were the losers, and nobody in the United States wanted to be a loser. Since World War I, America had always chose and fought for the winning side. By 1968 the youth of America rejected many of the social, political, and economical ideas of their parents/grand parents.<br>  <br>  1968 was only a bad year for those who were afraid of change, of revolution, and of socialism.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	Because Nixon became President.|`|RxO3w4neaa	1968 is considered one of the most tumultuous years in modern history. Protests in Europe, Asia, and Latin America that often ended in violence were commonplace, (Prague Spring, May Revolution, massacre in Mexico City, etc) and the United States was not exempt from the tension. Some of the events of the time:<br>  <br>  January 30- The Tet Offensive occurs in Vietnam. Though the North Vietnamese were beaten back by the combined American and South Vietnamese counterattack, the battle showed the North Vietnamese were not going to quit until the end, and public opinion shifted from tentative support to virulent dislike.<br>  <br>  March- The My Lai massacre. A group of American troops led by a Lt. Calley murdered innocent women and children in a Vietnamese village.<br>  <br>  Same month- LBJ, after realizing how he only narrowly defeated Eugene McCarthy in the New Hampshire Primary, withdraws his candidacy for the presidency.<br>  <br>  April- Columbia University students take over the campus because of  Vietnam and force the shutdown of the school.<br>  <br>  Same month- Martin Luther King Jr. is assassinated<br>  <br>  6/6/1968- RFK is assassinated.<br>  <br>  August- Police clash with anti-war protesters in Chicago in the Democratic National Convention<br>  <br>  December- The beginning of the Zodiac killings. (Zodiac Killer)<br>  <br>  Indeed the year was hard for Americans, and I've heard some amazing stories from folks who had to live through that hell.... Hope I helped!|`|yJXlvFfeaa	2 assassinations..Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther Ling Jr.  The riots in Chicago showed police brutality all over the World and the Tet Offensive in Vietnam took the US  by surprise.
aeODdMATaa	Eclipse, because well it has more action than the others and I love all the arguing that Edward does with Jacob, its funny.|`|daza5A4vaa	Alright..<br>  Let me first say that I have read the series.<br>  All four books.<br>  <br>  Now..<br>  Go away. Use the search bar. Crawl under a rock. I don't care. Just leave.<br>  <br>  Is it really necessary to ask this question when it's been asked every day for God knows how long?<br>  <br>  There is a search bar for a reason. Why do you people find it so hard to use it?<br>  <br>  To answer your question, I liked New Moon the best.<br>  Edward was hardly in it at all.. And there was tons of Jacob, the most realistic character out of the whole series.|`|S4W7FojCaa	I liked New Moon.|`|ujzkiqU0aa	i liked all of them except New moon, in the beginning Edward left!!! that wass soo sad i almost cried :'( and then the hole book was about jacob and that was extremely boring..until the end and Edward came back then i was happy :) lol Twilight was pretty good, Eclipse pretty good too, and Breaking dawn was pretty good too, lol it was funny when Edward like Chewed up the Headboard and when there was feathers all over the place :) lol, and i liked at the End when The Volturi came and Bella used her sheild and all that..and the very last part when Bella lets Edward read her mind :) theres too much more to say so i guess im done :D|`|XMyz1NOkaa	i liked breaking dawn the best i have read it three times and twilight is right behind i did not like new moon only because edward  left her but i will go see the movie|`|E5IktYWMaa	Eclipse Most Definitely|`|cP041buKaa	i love them all. But my faverite would have to be Breaking Dawn, because its the conclusion. all the bad ending. Everyone has a happy ending, and thats how i like it.<br>  <br>  i want to bring something up:<br>  <br>  ok, alot of people say that they hate New Moon because of Edward leaving. even though it was kindof boreing without Edward, i think it was a very important book. cause while edward was away, Bellas' and Jacob's friendship grew stronger, which is a very important facter in this book.<br>  <br>  But i like them all :)|`|FaBx9W4Faa	I like the last one Breaking Dawn because Bella is finally turned into a vampire. Throughout the books me and my friend were very impatient to find out if and when she'll turn into a mortal. Also, she finally has a baby with Edward, Renesme. And Jacob finally stopped liking Bella for once and found Renesme who he imprinted on. Overall, the wolf guys and the Cullens had a peace treaty going, on in the end, and they stood together as a family, in the end, to defeat the Voultri. And it was a happy ending too:)|`|Jy6XF0ljaa	Eclipse was my favorite. It had the perfect balance of action and romance in my opinion.<br>  Twilight was great too..the one that started it all.<br>  I had a hard time getting in to New Moon at the start. It was hard without Edward :(<br>  Breaking Dawn got a little long..I think it could have been edited a little better.|`|za9b8cHKaa	Hey, I read the whole series and thought that it was awful. Twilight was slightly less awful and wasn't as rushed and immature as they others, so I suppose I'll have to pick that.|`|Bc8kmZ95aa	um, first, i am OBSESSED with twilight, its number  of everything in the whole galaxy and second, i am obsessed with ALL OF THEM.|`|ykt1beVVaa	I A FAN. I LOVE THE SAGAS (READ ALL OF THEM ). IT IS TOO HARD TO SAY BUT ALL THE BOOKS ARE THE BEST|`|w3yrnDEiaa	This question has been asked many times before you. Please consult the Search Bar to find the answer.|`|CMrpz3mNaa	Twilight because it was so sweet.. but eclipse because you really got to see their relationship|`|XxBvHD4Kaa	AGH I can't pick a favourite!<br>  They were all awesome! <br>  I tried to put them in order of how much I liked them...and it was impossible! I love the Twilight Saga <3

I LOVE TWILIGHT!!!|`|CMrpz3mNaa	I like twilight, but i like eclipse too. =) i like alice, so cute and funny!! and emmett bcuz he's so funny|`|w3yrnDEiaa	This question has been asked many times before, please use the search bar.|`|XDNer3Huaa	OH DEAR LORD<br>  Use the space bar<br>  For the country|`|EqZ0zBhDaa	my favorite is the breaking dawn! i just love how they get married and i love how bella becomes a vampire. My favorite character in this book was renesmee.|`|Bc8kmZ95aa	um...i am obsessed with all of 'em. i love em all. i like alice....
DDTiZRvzaa	When Alice was younger, still human, she claimed that she could "See the future", people got scared and worried and admitted her to a ansylum (I think I spelled it right, anyway that big long word is like a Koo Koo house.) While there, a vampire (James) finds her. He is attracted to her blood as much as he is to Bella's. He tries to kill Alice. But, there was a unnamed vampire, who was Alice's doctor, who protected Alice from James. He changed Alice into a vampire, so James could not kill her. The un-named vampire ends up being killed by James. <br>  <br>  How she met Jasper.......she was out on her own, so was he. He was traveling across America. She had a vision about the Cullens (who at the time was only, Emmett, Edward, Carlisle, Rosalie and Esme), then one about Jasper coming into a diner....forgot which state......and then she had a vision about her and Jasper becoming part of the Cullen family. When he showed up at the Diner as expected, she explained to him and they set out to find the Cullens.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!! Don't worry their story is very confusing, parts are scattered through all four books! I get confused alot!|`|GZonOcBhaa	i don't know how alice met jasper. i think somehow they met after carlisle changed them in their family. Alice didn't remember where she lived before she was a vampire or what happened to her but she found out later. Everyone that is in the family now was sick when they were human and Carlisle was a doctor, and when he saw they weren't going to live he changed everyone. Carlisle changed everyone in the family except for Bella of course. :-)|`|gteQDUMpaa	james tells bella in "phone call" thats the name of the chapter. alice saw that jasper in a resturaunt and she saw that he was going to be her mate so she waited in the resturant for him then they went to the cullens cuz she saw that carslie and his cult were "vegitarians"|`|XDNer3Huaa	Must we go into this? Why can't you just read?|`|INev6aIkaa	Alice was turned by a vampire who didn't want james to turn her into a vampire i think he cared because he fell in love with her... but any way she cant remember why she turned because she was insane she saw pictures of the future in her head which is why she can tell the future as a vampire. it is inferred that the day she checked into the asylum the day her family consider her dead after she turned she had a Vision of a man and went out looking for him( she was siting in a bar or a restaurant when jasper walked by and stopped she looked at him grabbed him by the arm and said "what took you so long" LOL)|`|hqaSMGD7aa	There's a Twilight wiki, it's probably there.|`|Bc8kmZ95aa	thanx 4 the 2 points and stop being a lazy bum! re-read that book, girl!|`|daza5A4vaa	We could do without repetitive Twilight questions..<br>  If you're going to be insensitive, then why can't we?<br>  <br>  Read the book. Seriously, it's not that hard.|`|RrtUV5wcaa	james tried to kill her, but some other unnamed vampire came a long and saved her and turned her into a vampire to keep her from dying, and she found jasper because she saw him coming in one of her vision thingys
0Hd6py0Caa	Yeah i agree wit u. I read them in March last year, then Breaking Dawn when it came out, i just finished reading them again. Wait until later this year to re read them<br>  <br>  You should try :<br>  <br>  Blue Bloods by Melissa De La Cruz<br>  Morganville Vampires by Rachel Caine<br>  Den Of Shadows by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes<br>  House of Night novels by P.C Cast<br>  Generation Dead by Daniel Waters<br>  Vampire Diaries by L.J Smith<br>  The Host by Stephenie Meyer<br>  The Twilight Saga by Stephenie Meyer<br>  Vampire High by Douglas Rees|`|D20ue82Iaa	It's not a series, but try Scribbler of Dreams by Mary Pearson.  It's absolutely amazing!  Very much a "star-crossed lover" story.  I've read it about four times a year since I was 15...and I'm going on 21 now lol.  Highly recommended.  I LOVE the Twilight series, and this book is right up there with it for me!  :) Good luck.|`|eTS2nd70aa	Oh, definitely the Gemma Doyle Trilogy...first book is A Great and Terrible Beauty.|`|ykt1beVVaa	yea well read them again|`|b1580e3d6f73c9d9495a1dde6ceb4c23aa	THE HOST<br>  <br>  <br>  lololololololololollolololol<br>  <br>  Just an impulse.|`|693a8567ca4d67a82605245743aa0f26aa	Try the Sookie Stackhouse Novels they are based on the HBO series TrueBlood.|`|JnSrN3guaa	read them all over again! [:<br>  <br>  if you want a "i love you but i can't be with you" book, read stephenie meyer's The Host. it's awesome! =P<br>  <br>  if you like vampires (the traditional kind) you should read Vampire Diaries. it's a series, too! =]]<br>  :D|`|fpuHVNYgaa	Vampire Diaries is almost exactly like Twilight series. A lot of readers think Stephenie Meyer got her ideas from Vampire Diaries series which was written 15 years ago.Vampire Diaries takes place in a high school like Twilight with a human girl and a vampire boy have a forbidden love.Also the vampire boy lives off of animal blood not human blood like Edward Cullen.I think SM copied her ideas from this book and lied and said it came to her in a dream. Read Midnight sun on SM website as it is the same as Twilight but Edward is the narrator.

Second, edit the book, or have someone you trust edit it for you.  Third, look online for reputable agents or check Literary Agents Marketplace (it's a book).  There is no reason a publisher should NOT publish a book by a 12 year old, IF the book is worthy of being published.|`|tHpxUaIcaa	That sounds like a good story! Very deep for a 12-year-old I think. But there's nothing wrong with that. I've written a novel already and I'm in the process of editing it. I also plan to have more books than just one. Don't worry about what age you'll be when you publish it, odds are you won't be 12 when your books get published. On average it takes about 3-8 years for a new time author to publish their book. I've been working on mine for 2 years and I'm still not done!  I'm 18 and I'll most likely be 22 or 23 by the time my novel is published. Finding an agent is the most difficult part, finding a publisher is somewhat easier I hear because the agent looks for one for you. You should stay focused on writing your story and making it the best it can be. That's why I'm still working on mine. Don't worry about getting an agent or finding a publisher until you get to that point. I'm going to look for an agent this summer because I'm almost done.  Good luck with your story!

AA10209040	Twilight definitely does NOT follow the hero journey. Nobody learns anything or develops as a character. There's not even really a conflict.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for a good example of a hero journey, you should read Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card.|`|w3yrnDEiaa	Bella has no journey in Twilight, she just finds a boy and falls in love with him. She never develops or overcomes any struggles. She is not even a hero, she is just the protagonist of a romance novel.|`|yazZH4khaa	There may not be a hero in the sense that we generally think of a hero.  However, I believe that any teenager or young adult that can think for themselves and not just follow their peers, is a hero in another sense.  Bella was able to ignore the fact that the other students ignored the Cull ens and befriended them. Seeing them for the people that they were on the inside, not just judging them by their outer appearance.  Being a hero is never easy.  Bella was judged by others for simply associating with the Cullens, yet she was strong enough to put all of that pressure aside and make her own decisions.|`|fpuHVNYgaa	Bella is the heroine in the end of twilight series in the last book Breaking Dawn when she becomes a vampire and uses her gift her shield to protect her family(The Cullens and the werewolves and the other good vampires) from the Volturi.

Bk4eIAWWaa	A hobbyist, no. At the point a person begins they don't need to start with film or a DSLR (like gryphon said) heck, I started with an Instamatic. As they move up, they can decide if film is the direction they want to go or an area they'd like to investigate.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	I believe film is the best way of learning photography. High schools and colleges that ripped out their wet darkrooms a few years ago are now putting them back due to instructor and student demand.<br>  <br>  By using a film camera the student has to actually think rather than just shoot, check, delete, shoot, check, delete. Never forget what Ansel Adams said: "Pictures are not taken, they are made." No, he didn't mean made as in Photoshop.<br>  <br>  At photokina 2008 Rollei introduced 4 new films. Kodak introduced their new Ektar 100 last Fall.|`|35f126768433fb7bc9a5037cf6657dbcaa	i wouldn't send anyone an old camera of mine...it would not be a favor to them at all (i use things till they absolutely die and go up in smoke)<br>  film is good to have and to learn<br>  but to learn on?  i dunno, i think every photographer ought to do some film shooting to round out their experience...and film shooting actually makes learning lighting and composition necessary not optional, because it costs money to buy and develop film...you can't just download it and photoshop it.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	I think it is a good idea for the main reason that they have to learn how to use the camera in order to get good pics.  Too many people get DSLRs and never take it off of AUTO... to me that is just an expensive point and shoot.<br>  I started out on film over 20 years ago and then went digital.  I've seen the best and worst of both worlds.  As far as some people saying that for serious work use MEDIUM FORMAT film... yeah I gotta say they are right on that one after seeing results.  But I've seen results on MEDIUM digitals too!  Now that is a different ball game... too expensive with damn good results|`|j5Apt8hWaa	The reason for teaching aspiring photographers using a 35 mm SLR, or really any film camera, is to do two things.  1) help the instructor provide personalized assistance when the student is just starting to learn how to expose film, using a light meeter.  There is no better way to see what problems a student is having with coordinating the controls of the camera with the light meter.  When a student has developed their own film and made a contact sheet, there is no way to hide mistakes in exposure. 2) Since the student knows that thee is a finite number of images on a roll of film, they will take more time to accurately set the exposure on the camera and learn to expose each frame perfectly. <br>  <br>  The cost of the 35 mm SLR is minimal and if the student chooses wisely, once they have developed the skills necessary to be able to compose, expose, develop and print images, all they have to do is add a digital SLR to their existing system and use their developed skills, they are quickly into the digital world with only about a $50 blip in their equipment budget<br>  <br>  It is perhaps in the printing of the negatives, the student soon is impressed at how important perfect exposures are when producing images destined for markets, or in the case of an advanced amateur, images for display or competition at various contests.  Future pros, indeed learn the techniques necessary to become successful, by starting out using film.  The problem with digital cameras, the user can delete all their mistakes and any attempt to help them perfect their skills, are lost ... when there is nothing to perfect as far as what they show their instructor.  There is also the temptation of the digital only student to use the machine-gun technique to shoot their images, hoping that they will get one good shot out of a few hundred, were as those who learn using film, learn to take measured shots, eventually becoming able to get a 3 to 1 return on their images.<br>  <br>  While digital cameras are nearly a perfect choice for photographers on a deadline (photojournalism or sports), many other fields of photography, lend themselves to using film, especially when the original image needs to be shot using an 8x10 inch view camera still used by some advertising photographers for clients like cruise lines, automobile manufacturers, banks and adult beverages just to mention a few.<br>  <br>  Photo artists use film, since as with all art, the artists must control all the processes from choosing the film, to using archival print mounting prior to exhibition.  This includes the development of the film, printing and archival processing of the prints. ... this all has to be done by the hands of the artist, or of course it has less value ... to the collector for sure.|`|k8AcVixTaa	I recommend it.  If you really want to learn and understand photography you need to know and understand where photography came from.  Digital has not replaced film for many pro's.  I use my film 4x5 for my serious work and use digital for not so serious work.  I have two digital cameras.  Nikon D40 and Nikon D60.  I have a love/hate relationship with them.  While they are convenient they lack discipline.  Any body can take a digital photo and "fix" or "improve" it with photo shop.  Film takes a longer commitment as you need to do the photo right so you don't have to "fix" it in the darkroom.  I like to play with images in photo shop especially with old prints I did in film and a few have been made better depending on my interpretation at that moment.  <br>  <br>  Nope. To experience photography you need to understand how it came to be.  <br>  <br>  BTW - my 4x5 film camera is 30 years old and still out performs in quality and focus than my $600 Nikon D60.|`|65109cb8f29d34e3d6fc411bd1edae58aa	I recommend film because it slows people down a little, gives them time to think, and because it is so much more affordable than digital.<br>  <br>  A decent digital kit is $600. <br>  <br>  <br>  A great film camera like the N90s with a 50mm is only $100. $500 will buy a lot of great film like Velvia and Pan F. Digital doesn't come close to those.|`|WXAkvhImaa	I started with digital and went to film to improve my skills.<br>  <br>  It's all about learning to compensate for the cameras flaws, you learn how to be a lot more adaptive which helps doubly when you go back to digital.|`|2bVxBCgzaa	I think it's good to know as much about anything as possible, but it's not really that necessary, as long as you understand the basics of when to override your settings for a specific challenge.<br>  <br>  Here's what Ken Rockwell says about it- (I'm prepared for all the thumbs down...:-)<br>  <br>  ------------<br>  "It's important to be fluent with the technical concepts, but those are only a starting point. <br>  <br>  People spend too much time worrying about gear and technique. They completely forget that mastery of technique & equipment is merely the first step in a much longer journey toward the creation of great images.<br>  <br>  I teach photography very differently from the old farts. In the first 150 years, which were from about 1835 through about 1985 with the introduction of the first real Matrix exposure meters (as opposed to ordinary light meters), one needed to bridle oneself with many clumsy technical inconveniences before one could produce any photograph at all. Since it's only been about ten years now that many cameras know how to set themselves properly over a wide range of conditions, many old timers still haven't learned that for most people one may completely ignore camera settings. That's right, I usually shoot on autofocus and program auto exposure any time I can!<br>  <br>  It's sad when people ask me to suggest a camera that fits the pathetic requirements for beginning photo classes, which usually require a totally obsolete manual camera. Good gosh, run away from those classes and learn to love your point and shoot. Automation is good: the camera is not thinking for you, it's just setting the rudiments of focus and exposure which rarely require creative thought. The auto cameras free your creative juices to concentrate on what is important, which is heat, passion, fire, composition, expression and lighting.<br>  <br>  I suggest going out and trying to express your feelings carefully and see what you get. Once you get familiar with things you may want to seek out technical advice from someone who really knows. It's more important to go find things about which you are passionate and attempt to convey that fire through images first.<br>  <br>  2.) FORGET TECHNIQUE WHEN STARTING<br>  <br>  "I am not a scientist. I consider myself an artist who employs certain techniques to free my vision." Ansel Adams in his Autobiography, page 254<br>  <br>  Worrying about manual exposure settings and technique distracts you from your passion, just as if your lover were to stop to answer the phone in the middle of a steamy one-on-one. <br>  <br>  Many people still mistakenly think that mastering simple issues like shutter speeds and depth of field is all there is to know about photography. Those have as little to do with photography as typewriter repair has to do with composing a novel. They are necessary evils, and by no means the central point.<br>  <br>  For larger format cameras like 120 and 4x5 you probably will have to learn technique because those cameras are not made in enough quantity for their manufacturers to justify the efforts in automating them, but for 35mm and digital almost all cameras can do this themselves better than most of the people who would insist you set the camera manually. Don't fret the technique unless you have to. Most of what you see in my galleries was shot in program automatic mode. Tell that to your photo teacher.<br>  <br>  Watch out, I know people who actually enjoy having to fool with the settings on their view cameras. This is OK, but don't let that mislead you to worrying too much about it. Start with an automatic camera so you learn the important points of how to express your feelings first. You can learn f/stops later.<br>  <br>  Old farts like to make themselves feel important by making you think that you need them to teach you the secrets of fiddling with your camera. They will try to get you to believe that all this crap is required to make photographs. They will insist you waste your time with manual exposure settings, and if you are stupid enough to believe this you'll also spend all your time worrying about which lens is sharper instead of having your own solo show at The Whitney.<br>  <br>  There are 150 years of photo technology programmed into your 35mm camera. Use it.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to start off with your 35mm SLR set to matrix metering, program auto exposure and autofocus! Your images will actually be better than dispassionate people who waste their time with manual methods because most cameras have better programming inside them than most photographers do! Your modern SLR camera probably uses the Zone System to figure exposure, which very few photographers understand.<br>  <br>  You need to worry about seeing, feeling, composition and lighting, NOT about f/stops as you start out.<br>  <br>  Yes, technical ability, in fact, virtuosity, is absolutely required for successful photography, however, this ability is nothing more than a mandatory prerequisite with which one might then be able make great photos. Luckily much of this fluency today is incorporated into automated ca|`|b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	I think it's a good idea...as will most experienced photographers tell you.  Many of them have used BOTH digital and film, but still recommend a film camera to learn the basics of photography.<br>  <br>  Unless of course you think someone who doesn't know anything at all about photography should just run out and buy a $500 or $600 DSLR, because all their friends told them they need a DSLR to take "awesome" pictures.  They don't know anything at all about photography or how to use manual exposure...but they run out to buy a VERY expensive DSLR camera, and then treat it like it's just a cheap point and shoot camera and take snapshots on auto mode.<br>  <br>  Keep your little digital point and shoot camera.  No one wants it.  I sure wouldn't want it.  I would much prefer a medium format film camera, with completely manual exposure.  <br>  <br>  I've used both digital and film, but mostly prefer film...because film just blows digital away.  Especially medium format film.<br>  <br>  I have an 8 megapixel digital camera, but I just use that for snapshots when I'm out with my friends.  For REAL photography, I use film.|`|bocePfyYaa	Since acquiring my Sony a700 I don't see myself shooting film much. I thought I would until I actually had the camera. Digital really has come a long way towards the quality of film.<br>  <br>  For a photography class it is important often to use 35mm because it is harder for the student to hide mistakes or whatnot. There is no delete button on a film camera. That being said, it is harder to cheat with digital because of the EXIF file that tells all about the settings used to make an image. The instructor will know if you used the auto modes. But with film, there is always that possibility.<br>  <br>  You are also much more likely to take the time and learn the techniques to get the images right the first time with film. Every frame you shoot costs money with film whereas you can just delete a botched frame with digital.<br>  <br>  They both have their advantages. And I appreciate both. But I doubt I will be shooting 35mm much outside of my upcoming photography classes.|`|dai4nP0yaa	Haha, well each has it's advantages. <br>  In my opinion, the big things for film.<br>  <br>  1.Knowing you have only a limited number of shots means you make more of an effort to make each one count. With digital you can shoot thousands of crap photographs to get five good ones, on it's own it's not as bad as it sounds, but going through all those photographs afterwards is a hell of a job, not to mention you don't really learn how to "make" photographs that way, but just how to push buttons.<br>  <br>  2. Working with film tends to teach (or encourage you to learn) alot about the technical workings of a camera. I mean let's face it, how many people truly understand every aspect of how their digital camera works? While with mechanical (ok, fine not necessarily all film cameras are purely mechanical) cameras, it's pretty simple to understand. The thing about understanding about how the camera works is,  even if you move on to digital, the basic principal is the same. If you start this from the digital end, you'll quite quickly run into questions about metering matrices or image compression strategies, and after that may not survive long enough to realise that almost no photographer understands exactly how those things work, but only how they can be used.<br>   <br>  3.Consider this, after continuously poorly exposing rolls of film, you either learn how to use the bloody thing or give up on photography. And this is helped by the fact that you can't really judge your results until you develop the prints. Ofcourse with digital you can see your mistakes almost immediately, but in my experience if you take say two rolls of film, first you have to wait until the rolls are finished, then developing takes a while, after all that waiting if you get crappy pictures you'll make sure the next time the pictures are better otherwise it's just not worth the effort.<br>   <br>  4. It's a kind of snobbery, or perhaps we could say "discriminatory nostalgia". Getting more or less everyone to start with film keeps film alive, and for now it's important to keep film alive. In many ways digital doesn't quite match up to film yet. And old processes do have a charm all of their own (Just think of silver-halide plates). I mean commercial photographers tend to have time constraints which make digital extremely appealing, but if hobbyists usually don't have tight deadlines and so film is still an interesting medium. Oh yeah and aren't darkrooms much nicer than being stuck in a chair in front of a monitor? (Honestly I never did like darkrooms, I was always too clumsy and impatient to properly develop film myself but many people claim to enjoy it).<br>  <br>  As far as I can tell, digital has relatively few (even though very large and important) over film. <br>  1. It's just way quicker and more convenient to print and edit.<br>  2. New lenses. And fewer scratched lenses.<br>  3. Alot of auto- thingummies. It does tend to encourage new photographers to depend on purely automatic settings (which may not necessarily be a bad thing), but it's also often very useful and convenient.<br>  <br>  Throughout this I've used film and digital as people tend to see them. So actually the comparison is mechanical film cameras vs... rather than strictly film vs. digital. I did this because from experience when people talk about learning with a film camera they often don't really include say the Nikon F6 in the list of film cameras.|`|e185922a05d6a34cd1ab11b31d21af0baa	I like film as well but also fully embrace digital photography and  would agree that using film unless it is polaroid is not an easy way to learn photography(though it was the method I used).  Traditionalist, or shall I say film photographers shouldn't discourage digital photography on the basis of it not being traditional or not as visceral as they should consider that the method in which digital photographers work is quite similar to antiquated photographic techniques like the glass collodion photography of the 19th century, a photographic processes that predates roll film/sheet film.  In the old days you would take an exposure, go back to your portable darkroom(or studio darkroom if you were a studio photographer) and develop your plate.  If the plate didn't look right you would scrape off the emulsion, put a new emulsion on and shoot the scene again at a different exposure.  If you think about the digital photographer who takes a photo, looks at the result and in the field deletes that photo only to take another, it sounds more similar to pre film methods. If you want to make another analogy isn't that laptop that digital photographers carry around just a more compact version of the 19th century photographers portable darkroom?  <br>  Now with regards to teaching, the benefit I see with film is that it helps students to pre-visualize without shooting blindly and en-masse in hopes of getting a good image.  When I learned photography I had to learn it based on theory.  If I didn't learn this theory my photographic projects with their short deadlines would never have been done on time. Ideally a digital slr with only manual features(no aperture or shutter priority) would be the best choice for a people who really want to learn photography.|`|qXAvXHdYaa	I have 2 issues - one - why tell people to start learning on a 35mm film camera or a DSLR?  Let them get a $200-$300 point and shoot with some advanced controls.  I never understood people who just blindly tell someone to run out and get a Sony A200, Nikon D40 or a Canon XT kit to learn on.   <br>  <br>  Why spend all that money when they don't know how to use the gear, let alone have mastered photographic basics.<br>  <br>  I started out on an advanced point and shoot camera and upgraded to a Nikon N90s, then shortly to a Nikon D50 - and now to a D300.<br>  <br>  If it had not been for the digital camera and the fact that I could get instant feedback, I would not have gained the skills I have today.  I am a self taught professional.  No access to a darkroom or proper training on how to process film(I let pro labs do that for me when I need it, which by the way has been never since starting my own business).  Money is a factor as well.  Paying for film and developing and prints.<br>  <br>  I say, if you want to learn on film or if you are taking a class and that is what they require, then by all means doso.  However, photography is photography.  Taking 50 crappy pictures with a DSLR is no different than taking 24 crappy pictures on film.  You just get to know sooner on digital that the images are crap and potentially give you the ability to do an instant reshoot if possible.<br>  <br>  I say learn and grow on digital.

Just breath and enjoy your life, its all you have today.|`|CJxD6YKKaa	Sound like you are young but wanting to date someone older. Age doesn't really matter if both parties don't care. <br>  <br>  As for myself, i would never date anyone with age difference more than 2(either younger or older), but individual varies. So, to me, age matters. However, i would not discriminate others who do not share the same view. They have the right to do so as long as it is legal.<br>  <br>  You are just 23, i am just 21, generally, our mental age should be around the same, i don't feel myself old, i am still young. <br>  If you are confused about life, try to find answer from religion, it may help.|`|bbr2v6Jkaa	No it is not a retarded statement? You just have no motivation right now? Many people do not for this is a repeat of the great depression! Read about it on www.history.com you will see the similarities but it is much easier now with the government aid and it is necessary for the population has quadrupled in size since then. Age is history and that is all. However there are ages and stages, You are just in a slump, when you get your next breath you will perk up again. I know people in their 70's still have an active imagination and want to seek more out of life, that is what you need to do. Go in search of the tomorrow you dream about?|`|bp2kMAr7aa	As long as both parties are legal adults age does not matter.|`|6kD5euncaa	You need to travel .|`|dlGP3iZ6aa	I wish I was 23 again...|`|XxDQGEalaa	As life expectancy increases, the generation gaps should stretch out. Many people enjoy a young adult lifestyle well into their thirties and forties now. <br>  <br>  It shouldn't matter as far as relationships go, but there is still a lot of stigma attached to age. You just have a better chance of success with someone you have a lot in common with; someone closer in age.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Over the years, everybody becomes aged. It is only those who, in line with their age, are able to utilize their available time, resources, energy and knowledge to the best advantage of their own self development and for the development of others in the society. A multi-dimensional growth is required to prove the worth of a person. Mere age is not sufficient. Based on age nobody will get a job. It is only based on the qualification, experience and skills, that one gets a suitable job.|`|zZY3JX30aa	I don't know, let's see; you're 23, try "dating" a 12 year-old. Does age matter?<br>  <br>  Seriously, if two people are 18 or older, it doesn't matter, unless it matters to one party or the other.|`|GfNVcq7Naa	That seems so sad to me.

SS9hE8rnaa	I'll just mention that its not Dleacroix, but Della Croix. In French this means "of the cross." Gee, do you think it may suggest some Christian symbolism somewhere.<br>  The mispronunciation is intended to call ur attention to it, I think. <br>  <br>  (I grew up in a small town not too far from where Jackson lived. There was a family who spelled their name "Garcia," but everyone pronounced it Garsha.)|`|qDSvOOwBaa	I, for one, don't understand how something like this could be given as a student assignment. Obviously, whoever gave out this assignment has no idea about Shirley Jackson the writer or the inter battles this story is about. While Ms Jackson was immensely talented she was horribly erratic, mostly due to her struggles with hard opiate drugs and alcohol.A struggle she would lose at far too young an age. There is no "Symbolism" in The Lottery-it's about her-as she said so, so many times.<br>  Sorry I can't help you with the assignment<br>  <br>  Ridiculous--In the Extreme!<br>  <br>  s_e_s|`|JfOuzOJGaa	One question?

zZY3JX30aa	That really depends on your personal beliefs. There is no way for anyone to be absolutely certain, it's all a matter of belief.|`|AA11564934	There is no god, the question is moot|`|q6H2ru3waa	All you have to do is to have faith and believe today while you are still living, you can be saved if you repent now you don't have to wait until you are close to death, because you can't repent after you die then it's too late.  now is the time, tomorrow is not promised.  God bless!|`|iTi26ojQaa	No matter the sin, big or small, God will always offer his forgiveness, to accept or decline that forgiveness is up to you. You can accept his forgiveness, and learn from your mistakes, or you can keep sinning, but there are many consequences for sinning.|`|380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa	Here's one scenario given by some seers:<br>  <br>  A person, after passing on, "cocoons" in his or her own consciousness, much as one dreams after a day in the life.<br>  <br>  Sooner or later, the person realizes "I'm alive," aka waking up as one awakens in a lucid dream.  Then, a period, not marked by time, ensues, in which the individual gradually becomes educatable by benign helper beings, Angels, who stand by waiting for more awareness to gradually develop.  At that timing, the person becomes educatable.  Without a physical platform for its character development, there is learning at the level one is at, often based on what one knows or has experienced during embodied life.<br>  <br>  Some examples worth reading:<br>  <br>  "Testimony of Light," Helen Greaves,<br>  "The Great Divorce," C.

Faith is what we do when we believe and you need to develop  faith. That is all. Don't fear dying? We all have to give up these bodies someday, and that is welcomed when we are so old we can't walk without breaking bones! OUCH! ha ha <br>  God forgives all and he knows you in your heart very much so and will know you are good and why you doubt, he knows EVERYTHING!<br>  So don't worry, it is not written that he won't accept you if you doubt, and maybe someday you won't doubt so look to the future for a little faith.<br>  After all wouldn't it be grand to have a being that is so wonderful as God in charge when we pass away and live in his many mansions as he has stated?|`|idedCbIYaa	Your beliefs should be a test of faith.

A stanza should not be repeated CONSTANTLY; it should be repeated subtly and conservatively. <br>  <br>   Think about it this way, if I were to write a poem right now:<br>                          This Poem Makes Me Want To Die, Ryan F.<br>  <br>  I want to stab my eyes out.<br>  This poem makes me want to do it.<br>  I want to hurt myself.<br>  This poem is not fluid.<br>  I want to die a thousand times.<br>  If you're writing such a poem, keep POETRY in mind.<br>  Perhaps you need poetry defined.<br>  For now, however, I can only scream, cry, and writhe.<br>  For This poem sucks really bad and makes me want to die.<br>  <br>  As you can see, I wrote a poem in a similar fashion to yours, but my verses are VARIABLE.

ilV7PClvaa	For us to properly answer your question, we need a little more information.<br>  <br>  Firstly, are you doing this on the computer or by hand?<br>  <br>  Secondly, how much time do you have to finish it?<br>  <br>  If you have a long time, and you're comfortable with drawing complex images, then I suggest you draw a classic dragon vs. hero battle scene. Probably make the scene take place at dusk, as this will give the picture a sense of untamed mystery and will allow you to add dramatic shadowing to the characters.<br>  <br>  If that's a little difficult, another common poster idea is just to have the faces of all the characters in the book/film/game. Make sure the villain's head is looming in the background, but not so much that you ignore the main characters.<br>  <br>  We can't really give any more information until you do. : )

FqyZRkYGaa	For an argument to be valid, the form must be correct...AND THAT'S IT...premises and conclusions can be false as long as it follows argumentative form.<br>  <br>  For an argument to be sound, all statements must be true. (premises and conclusions)<br>  <br>  For it to be sound AND valid, premises and conclusions must be true, and must follow the argumentative form.  Hope this helps, Good luck<br>  <br>  All but your bottom two are correct; reasoning above.<br>  <br>  To the responders who contest that number 2 is no, peruse the example:<br>  <br>  Mitch is a cat<br>  All cats are mammals<br>  Therefore, Mitch is a mammal<br>  <br>  This argument follows the argumentative form of:<br>  <br>  A is B<br>  All B are C <br>  Therefore, A must be C-----This is Valid and sound<br>  <br>  To make it sound but not valid (like number 2),<br>  I will keep the truth value of the premises but switch the form:<br>  <br>  Mitch is a cat<br>  Some cats eat vegetables<br>  Therefore, Mitch eats vegetables<br>  <br>  As you can see, it doesn't necessarily follow that Mitch eats vegetables just because some cats do.  This clearly shows the form is INVALID, meanwhile all premises and conclusions can be true at once.  Your welcome|`|2oc6TDiGaa	3. no valid arguement cant have false premises( you assume premises are true but i think they have to be true)<br>  4 yes they can have false conclusions<br>  <br>  idk the rest havent learned about sound.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	yes<br>  no<br>  yes<br>  yes<br>  no<br>  no<br>  <br>  Your second answerer is an idiot. I wonder if that perspective is just as valid to them?|`|RbsByuRTaa	1-2)Based on MS Word's definitions, I'd say that a sound argument is one that is well supported. Like a building that is structurally sound, it won't easily collapse. A valid argument is one that is, or at least seems, "logical" and "justifiable." A sound argument is therefore the result of a great deal of induction - or facts and/or evidence - followed by some deduction - or assertions derived from the evidence; and a valid argument may be anywhere between that and an argument comprised mostly of deduction based on a small amount of induction.<br>  <br>  This being the case, a sound argument will tend to be valid, but a valid argument could have little enough foundation to be unsound.<br>  <br>  3-4) "Valid" is only relative. A valid argument can have false premises if the basis for the argument is an abridgement of the truth or even a somewhat believable untruth but inspite of having false inductions, all of the deductions are logical and proper. And of course, if one makes a proper argument based on false premises, the conclusion ought to be false as well.<br>  <br>  5-6) If an argument is sound, it will generally be based on a substantial amount of truthful evidence such that if any untruthful evidence were used, it would stand out and be discarded. A sound argument is a valid argument that cannot be based on false premises or have false conclusions.|`|6kD5euncaa	They're all YES . All perspectives are valid and equal – true...

644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	Most people try to avoid war, and a lot of people certainly didn't want to make the sacrifices and pay the costs (human and economic) that a war would imply. However, I doubt pacifism was a leading concern in 1939, but the belief that the oceans were big enough to keep us out of the war was more important.<br>  <br>  As you note, the U.S. was not ready for war in 1939 (or even 1941), but FDR did take some measures, such as increasing the military budget and initiating a peacetime draft. In any event, it took only about six months after Pearl Harbor to get on a war fitting, so I don't think your second point is valid.<br>  <br>  Another factor against entering the war was pro-Nazi sentiment, as represented by Charles Lindberg, Henry Ford, and a few others. This was not widespread, but it was a factor.<br>  <br>  The U.S. and Japan nearly came to blows in the 1920s as a result of the Versailles Treaty; the Japanese felt like they got short-changed. And yes, the US had economic ties to the Allies, but I think the cultural and friendship ties with both Britain and France were just as important. Certainly Lend-Lease was a very provacative move.

1iX27Wzvaa	That kind of depends on what you mean by "up a key".  To which key are we transposing? <br>  <br>  So, why don't I tell you how to figure it out for any key?  Well, that's a little complicated, too.  I know, from the chords you've mentioned, that this must be the key of A.  You'd think it was D, huh, since that's the first chord.  Can't be, though, because all 8 notes of the scale are represented in these 4 chords:<br>  <br>  D F# A, A C# E, F# A C#, E G# B<br>  <br>  That's 12 notes, but only 8 are unique.  Let's rearange to be in alphabetical order and add the octave:<br>  <br>  D E F# G# A B C# D<br>  <br>  Now, if we play these notes ascending the D string of the guitar, we'll find we're fretting:<br>  <br>  2 --- 4 --- 6 --- 8 --- 9 --- 11 --- 12<br>  <br>  This corresponds to a pattern of intervals like so:<br>  <br>  whole step, whole, whole, half, whole, half<br>  <br>  And everybody knows (you will after you read this, anyway) that a major key must have the following pattern from root to octave:<br>  <br>  whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half<br>  <br>  Playing our scale starting from A on the 5th string, we'd go:<br>  <br>  0 ----- 2 ------ 4 --- 5 ------- 7 ------ 9 ------ 11 --- 12<br>  whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half<br>  <br>  So, it must be the key of A(major).  (We could call it F# minor, or some mode of D and be correct, but let's keep things simple.)<br>  <br>  A B C# D E F# G<br>  <br>  Counting the scale tones from A, we find that D is the IV chord, A is the I, F#m is vi, and E is V:<br>  <br>  IV, I, vi, V<br>  (the little roman numerals mean minor)<br>  <br>  Now pick your new key.  I like E minor, but that doesn't help us, so let's use its relative major key, G major:<br>  <br>  G A B C D E F#<br>  <br>  Counting the scale tones from G to find the chords for the progression we've discovered we get:<br>  <br>  C, G, Em, D <br>  <br>  That's down a full step.  To my mind, the first key down from A is Ab.<br>  <br>  Did you mean to transpose up to B, so your first chord is E?  Then you want E, B, G#m, F#.<br>  <br>  Course, you could just use a capo.|`|Y6TDCkaYaa	you would play the song in the key of D because of the circle of fifths<br>  <br>  <a href="http://files.meetup.com/227762/Circle%20of%20Fifths%20wheel.gif" rel="nofollow">http://files.meetup.com/227762/Circle%20...</a><br>  <br>  the chord on the left and the chord on right of D are the chords you use and also the minor chords below in the most inner circle woul also be part of the key<br>  <br>  play around with it until you get the song a key higher<br>  <br>  Good luck!
Y6TDCkaYaa	i love this song!<br>  <br>  so you would be playing it in the key of A because of the circle of fifths<br>  <br>  <a href="http://files.meetup.com/227762/Circle%20of%20Fifths%20wheel.gif" rel="nofollow">http://files.meetup.com/227762/Circle%20...</a><br>  <br>  and if you want to play it in the key of E then you use E,A,B and a chord in the minors of those three chords (F#m,G#m or C#m) just find out which one works<br>  <br>  Keep on playing!<br>  <br>  Good Luck and God bless|`|wGEYqauWaa	It's in the key of A.  If you want to play it in E then you need to transpose every chord up 3 1/2 tones. So A becomes E, E becomes B, and so on.|`|PU0wfROvaa	It doesn't state the tuning, so just stick to standard (EADGBe)
FWXiTCgoaa	Basically, no matter how hard we try, we're history. "Chemo alone... can't preserve us" means that our efforts are in vain. The narrator is asking what will be our reputation when we all die. How will we be remembered? The general theme is disillusionment and death. And yes, the passing of time is destroying everything.|`|mctTbw9Vaa	Quite a complex poem. I like it.<br>  <br>  In a literal sense, the poem is saying:<br>  Our existence is a strange one, we don't know why we are here. While we try to make colleagues and fit in with groups, we are also struggling to be individuals. The struggle to be ones own person is difficult, but the dying rose with a persistent leaf is at least showing effort to keep from being overcome. Science is trying to find a meaning to our existence through various forms of measurement (decibel, lumen, Richter) to find a reason, any reason as to why we are here. Although the religious pay respects to their higher-ups and people try to make their live here reflect a better possibility for anything after this life, we don't know if it works. We try to recycle to save our planet, to prolong it's life, but we don't know if it actually is. The need for discoveries in medicine are to prolong our own lives. Soul, habitat, and body. Nothing is forever. The end result is what we did show into the world, from our lives. What did you do that people are going to remember you for? Are they going to remember you in a good light, or a negative one? (Rhetorical questions, to be answered by you if you choose.)<br>  <br>  You were pretty close with the first idea, but not quite. Your second part was pretty dead on. <br>  <br>  I feel the general theme is about living the way you wish to be remembered. Don't shove down the small kid with the box of cool shaped rocks because he digs in the sandbox for them all day. Instead, promote him. He may discover something new, and dedicate it to you and your help.<br>  <br>  I feel that the passing of time does destroy everything in this poem, but it is inevitable eventually.<br>  <br>  The theme is similar. In Ozymandius, a traveler happens upon a statue, torn down by weather, time, and possibly other humans. The statue is depicted to have a "sneer of cold command." The sculptor clearly felt contempt for the King. That is the reputation that outlived the King -- His anger and fear was meaningless, people did not remember him in a wonderful light, and now his statue is alone and destroyed.

tNVDvJELaa	A good poem should produce a different response for everyone who reads it. It should even produce a different response each time the same person reads it. Therefore, you should be pleased if people see things other than "exactly what you are trying to convey." People who simply don't "get it" are probably not even trying. It's kind of like trying to get ordinary people to understand mathematical proofs -- they tend to clam up and block any sort of understanding. This happens for many different reasons, one being that poetry simply isn't "cool."<br>  <br>  Because poetry is no longer a popular genre, it is unlikely that you will gain a large readership, but I don't think you should be pandering to the lowest possible reader anyway. Just keep writing the way you see things.|`|LEp7IFdvaa	Interesting question.  A poet needs to write to a certain audience, and at times that audience can be more general or more specific.  Unless you are a poetic terrorist (one who forces others to read your poetry even when they don't really want to), anyone who reads your poetry should be in a frame of mind to "think".  However, if they are in the proper frame of mind and still don't "get" your poetry, then you need to ask yourself whether or not you're really writing for a general audience or a more specific one.  Chances are that they simply are not into poetry in the first place and are not in a frame of mind to understand the metaphors you've created.  Maybe they understand it, but don't like the rhyme, or the meter, or the voice, etc.  <br>  As long as you remember that poetry is an art form that tries to convey to others your perspective, whether it be emotion, vision, understanding, etc., then you should be okay.  Think of it like this: if you discovered a new way to mathematically prove your existence, would you show it to everyone, or just mathematicians?  If you showed it to everyone, only the mathematicians would be able to even grasp what you're trying to convey.  The same holds true with poetry.|`|P4I2dCS5aa	While someone who understands poetry as an art form will be much more willing to seek out subtle additions to a poem, the premise of a good poem is to convey a dramatic or emotional message. As such, if a poem is well-written, it WILL appeal to someone who is not a poet. This is the beauty of poetry, it allows you to connect to people.|`|Jqf2H9Nhaa	im not sure theres a technique<br>  poetry is a bit different from other forms of literature..<br>  to me, its straight from the heart<br>  or even straight from the soul<br>  if people do not understand you, they might not think deep enough<br>  it doesnt take a poet to understand poetry, however, "understanding" a poem isnt really the point<br>  to me, i believe the reader is supposed to get whatever they want from the poem<br>  theyre supposed to feel it themselves, and want whatever they want from the words...

3cEqH3pfaa	The Sumerians and the Akkadians lived roughly in the same area as the Babylonians (Mesopotamia) in small city states. They have no direct descendants (but see below), for they, like the Babylonians, gradually fused with each other and other peoples who came to the area in what is today Iraq. The Elamites came from a roughly the area of modern day Iran. They were effectively destroyed as political force by the Assyrians, and later absorbed by the Persians who migrated into the area. They had no direct descendants.<br>  Modern day Chaldeans and Assyrians claim descent from the Babylonians and  ancient Assyrians.|`|JVHCFXXVaa	No they aren't the same and their descendants are mixed so there is not one group/race or people that they became.|`|6wb3fBpzaa	these people and this is just a guess, were divided into countries such as greece, ejypt..
OIqkx8Mqaa	Not bad, not bad at all. I would wager that you are a better poet when you're tired then when you are completely coherent. The placement of punctuation and randomness of line length and rhythm adds to the chaos the poem suggests.  I would maybe break it into two or three different stanzas though. That would help with clarity. <br>  <br>  Edit: I think that the girl below me is crazy. The repetition is important to the poem. Lots of great poems have a repetition of words. <br>  Edit2: And don't listen to the people that think the poem has no point or whatever or doesn't make sense.|`|6en8QlaUaa	Truthfully, I think it's scattered and dark. There's too much "weeping" going on and it never finds itself throughout.<br>  It lacks any type of cohesion and leaves you puzzled as to what it means.<br>  <br>  <br>  This is my opinion but others might like it.|`|oECtQgtlaa	hmm...<br>  that was......pretty good :)<br>  9 ou t of 10 i guess.when you said that the man was weeping blahblahblah....it gets a little bit boring.so..try not to use the same words so many times.i love the rest of the poem tho,i think you really are better than me :p|`|yL7ODtuYaa	Yes i guess that your poem is one that have a lot of ingredients and i think you should collect all your poems and publish a book, it will sell like rock cakes.|`|qUR5mPTKaa	"I must say though, that you have a lot of emotions and thoughts in this poem, but it all sounds like your just throwing out random words out there that really don't make sense with the each phrase after another."<br>  <br>  I disagree with this completely. The thoughts, emotions, basically the overall rhythm is precisely what makes this poem, at least for me, really good. I liked how you started with the word Exhaustion. It has this impact that I can't even begin to explain.<br>  <br>  I liked the first part best.|`|xUDotk1Laa	hard though freestyle....<br>  you need to work on proper indenting it and arranging stanzas to make it more interesting.....|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	I really like this one.  Thanks for sharing :)|`|pzCWpNFoaa	Very descriptive and interesting.<br>  <br>  I must say though, that you have a lot of emotions and thoughts in this poem, but it all sounds like your just throwing out random words out there that really don't make sense with the each phrase after another. It doesn't seem to be flowing is what I mean and I don't see smoothness or like I'm getting anywhere, there is really "no point" at the end of the poem, it's like when I finished your poem I was like "ugghh? that's it, what is this about, ugghh? I didn't get it" , no but yeah I don't mean to sound negative, but there is no meaning to it. You have great words and very powerful emotions in there, so don't get me wrong I think you'll improve very quickly, you're doing really good. Anywho 8 years ago I used to write poems and did it as a hobby and when I was in school I had a thing for writing and journalism and was nominated by a Professor in my class to attend Maya Angelou's readings and poetry and I went and it changed my life and I think that your poetry so far is phenomenal.

AA10303012	Yes, that is correct.  Lee stayed up all night anguishing over the decision he had to make about which side to choose.  He had been asked by both North and South to lead their respective armies, and was in fact an officer in the US army at the time.  Now he would be leading an army to battle against his current army as he decided that he could not "raise his sword against his home state of Virginia"<br>  <br>  I have often  wondered how much sooner the war would have ended, and how many more lives might have been saved had he not fought for the Confederacy.  It was his military genius that kept the South in the war for as long as it lasted.  His home in Arlington VA is only a few miles from Washington DC.  If only he had lived a few miles further north and east, he would have been outside of Virginia, and he probably would have sided with the North.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, his home at Arlington became the site of the veterans national cemetery, because that's where the Union army decided to bury the many bodies being returned from battle, outside of Lee's front door.  The Union officers thought that since Lee was responsible for so many of their deaths, that he should provide a place for them to be buried.<br>  <br>  I disagree with the other answerer that Lee was a "southerner".  He did not believe in slavery, and was an ardent supporter of the USA. The only thing that made him a southerner was the couple of miles distance his home was from the Capitol.  His wife in fact was a descendant of George Washington.|`|knKVjOE6aa	Yes, That's right he was offered command of the Union army but wouldn't take it because he didn't want to fight his home of Virginia.|`|MPJI4APBaa	That's what I remember hearing.

The word derives from the Italian colorare (to colour; to heighten; to enliven) or colorazione (colouring, coloration).<br>  <br>  The term normally refers to a soprano who has the vocal ability to produce notes above C#6 and whose tessitura is A4-A5 or higher (unlike lower sopranos whose tessitura is G4-G5 or lower).<br>  <br>  It is also applied to a voice-type, the coloratura soprano, most famously typified by the role of Queen of the Night in Mozart's Die Zauberfl?te.[1] This type of soprano has a high range and can execute with great facility the style of singing that includes elaborate ornamentation and embellishment, including running passages, staccati, and trills.<br>  <br>  Other female and male voice types may also be masters of coloratura technique, but the term coloratura when used without further qualification means soprano coloratura. Richard Miller names two types of soprano coloratura voices (the coloratura and the dramatic coloratura)[2] as well as a mezzo-soprano coloratura voice[3], and although he does not mention the coloratura contralto, he includes mention of specific works requiring coloratura technique for the contralto voice.[4]<br>  <br>  In Jazz music, it's called "scat singing"<br>  <br>  In vocal jazz, scat singing is vocal improvisation with random vocables and syllables or without words at all. Scat singing gives singers the ability to sing improvised melodies and rhythms, to create the equivalent of an instrumental solo using their voice.

2PDBxlYDaa	I feel the two are connected. Those who wants freedom often defy the current authorities, freedom comes with its own price.

Guide lines to peacefully get along with others, that is why freedom and laws to provide for freedom go hand in hand, rather than anarchy and freedom by far!<br>  Anarchy comes when there is too my tyranny and too much restraint on the freedoms allowed by the laws that are governing us? This is what creates anarchy or the feeling for revolutions! Anarchy is very close to Tyranny too, for they both want control in a fierce way. Take a look at when France went to anarchy to over throw the monarchs, king louis and marie antoinette? This was only to gain control of that existing government and their wealth? Brutal and violent as well.<br>  The difference is very clear, freedom is a word used for specific conditions made by our democratic governing laws and the US is the closest thing to heaven when it comes to that on this planet. However that is why we all should vote, that is a freedom neglected by many.<br>  Good luck|`|SI46bZ8vaa	they are two different concepts.<br>  anarchy is a form of government, with little to no existing government on any level.  It is essentially impossible to exist because even when a family group forms there is a governing body, thus negating any type of anarchy.<br>  freedom is a loosely defined term often tied to free will or decision.<br>  in america we tend to define it as the right to vote, participate in government, own property...our freedom is pretty much defined by the consitution.<br>  other ideas of what freedom is have existed throughout history|`|3e725e3766e7c2feb409def323af3e0eaa	It depends on how you define freedom. Political philosophers differ on what freedom is... <br>  <br>  However, from what I understand, freedom is never conceived of without some governing force and anarchy is free of any governing force.|`|uyn5d1dHaa	Freedom, currently, is liberty within the extent of the law.<br>  Anarchy is the absence of law and, therefore, perfect liberty.|`|A01w1dHqaa	Freedom is free of fear. Anarchy is refusing to be part of a system in which you must trust others.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Freedom need not be socially defined. It may be a purely internal state.
kxzcilZzaa	First of all honey, take a deep breath and be thankful that you are only 16 =] you still have time yet. If you are interested in art, it doesn't matter how good or bad you think you are at it. Speaking as an artist myself, there are many types and styles of art. My advice would be to take as many art and creative writing courses you can get your hands on in this beautiful system of free education and explore your interests. Just remember you don't have to know what is for you just yet. Check out painters like Marc Chagall. It just goes to show that anything that you do is art and it's all in how someone sees it =]. By the way, you're photograph was very nice. I'd buy a print of it. Check out deviantart.com. set up a profile and talk to other artists. They'll give feedback on work and offer loads of help. Great for any budding artist. Check me out (ConstableParrot)
3zGnJEvSaa	Na filosofia, Empirismo é um movimento que acredita nas experiências como únicas (ou principais) formadoras das idéias, discordando, portanto, da no??o de idéias inatas.<br>  <br>  Na ciência, o empirismo é normalmente utilizado quando falamos no método científico moderno (que é originário do empirismo filosófico), o qual defende que as teorias científicas devem ser baseadas na observa??o do mundo, em vez da intui??o ou fé.<br>  <br>  O termo tem uma etimologia dupla. A palavra latina experientia, de onde deriva a palavra "experiência", é originária da express?o grega εμπειρισμ??. Por outro lado, deriva-se também de um uso mais específico da palavra empírico, relativo aos médicos cuja habilidade derive da experiência prática e n?o da instru??o da teoria.<br>  A doutrina do empirismo foi definida explicitamente pela primeira vez pelo filósofo inglês John Locke no século XVII. Locke argumentou que a mente seria, originalmente, um "quadro em branco" (tabula rasa), sobre o qual é gravado o conhecimento, cuja base é a sensa??o. Ou seja, todas as pessoas, ao nascer, o fazem sem saber de absolutamente nada, sem impress?o nenhuma, sem conhecimento algum. Todo o processo do conhecer, do saber e do agir é aprendido pela experiência, pela tentativa e erro.<br>  <br>  Historicamente, o empirismo se op?e a escola conhecida como racionalismo, segundo a qual o homem nasceria com certas idéias inatas, as quais iriam "aflorando" à consciência e constituiriam as verdades acerca do Universo. A partir dessas idéias, o homem poderia entender os fen?menos particulares apresentados pelos sentidos. O conhecimento da verdade, portanto, independeria dos sentidos físicos.<br>  <br>  Alguns filósofos normalmente associados com o empirismo s?o: Aristóteles, Tomás de Aquino, Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, George Berkeley, David Hume e John Stuart Mill. Embora no geral seja relacionado com a teoria do conhecimento, o empirismo, ao longo da história da filosofia, teve implica??es na lógica, filosofia da linguagem, filosofia política, teologia, ética, dentre outros ramos.|`|3573c49df95704f1d9acca1417c24823aa	Já deram a resposta... ent?o n?o vou ficar enfeitando sua página com textos de 100 linhas!<br>   <br>   David Desmond Hume... <br>   Te lembra Lost?<br>  <br>   é...

Limita o conhecimento à vivência, só aceitando verdades que possam ser comprovadas pelos sentidos. <br>  <br>  Rejeita os enunciados metafísicos, baseados em conceitos que extrapolam o mundo físico, devido à impossibilidade de teste ou controle. A no??o de gravidade, por exemplo, faz parte do mundo sensível; já o conceito de bem é do mundo metafísico. <br>  <br>  O empirismo provoca revolu??o na ciência. A partir da valoriza??o da experiência, o conhecimento científico, que antes se contentava em contemplar a natureza, passa a querer dominá-la, buscando resultados práticos. <br>  <br>  O inglês John Locke (1632-1704) funda a escola empirista, uma das mais importantes da filosofia moderna. Apesar de partir do cartesianismo, Locke discorda de Descartes sobre a existência de idéias inatas produzidas pela capacidade de pensar da raz?o. <br>  <br>  Para Locke, as idéias vêm da experiência externa, pela sensa??o, ou da interna, via reflex?o. S?o também simples ou compostas. A idéia de comprimento, por exemplo, é simples: vem da vis?o. A de doen?a, fruto da associa??o de idéias, é composta. <br>  <br>  No século XVIII, o escocês David Hume (1711-1776) leva mais longe o empirismo ao negar a validade universal do princípio de causalidade, uma vez que n?o pode ser observado. <br>  <br>  O que se observa é a seqüência temporal de eventos, e n?o sua conex?o causal. Só por uma quest?o de hábito pensamos que o fato atual se comportará como outros que já observamos no passado. <br>  <br>  Para o empirismo contemporaneo, também chamado de positivismo lógico, representado pelo austríaco Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), a filosofia deve limitar-se à análise da linguagem científica, express?o do conhecimento baseado na experiência<br>  <br>  Um abra?o, Helda|`|c5571a263068a4ebf6b74e6a87bc7d22aa	Maricy,<br>  <br>  O colega Fortuna deu uma boa resposta mas acho que os usuários devem conhecer um pouco mais sobre o assunto, que é importante em nossas experiências de vida, por isso posto o link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirismo" rel="nofollow">http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirismo</a><br>  .

4dee9724a56cc28e5517a81b2cff9c35aa	Quatro elementos essenciais concorreram para a industrializa??o: capital, recursos naturais, mercado, transforma??o agrária.<br>  <br>  Na base está a Revolu??o Inglesa do século XVII. Após acabar com o absolutismo monarquico, a burguesia conquistou os merca-dos mundiais e transformou a estrutura agrária. Os ingleses avan?aram sobre esses mercados por meios pacíficos ou militares. A hegemonia naval lhes dava o controle dos mares. <br>  Era o mercado que comandava o ritmo da produ??o, ao contrário do que aconteceria depois, nos países já industrializados, quando a produ??o criaria seu próprio mercado.<br>  <br>  Até a segunda metade do século XVIII, a grande indústria inglesa era a tecelagem de l?. Mas a 1a primeira a mecanizar-se foi a do algod?o, feito com matéria-prima colonial (Estados Uni-dos, índia e Brasil). Tecido leve, ajustava-se aos mercados tropicais; 90% da produ??o ia para o exterior e isto representava metade de toda a exporta??o inglesa, portanto é possível perceber o papel determinante do mercado externo, principalmente colonial. <br>  <br>  As col?nias contribuíam com matéria-prima, capitais e consumo... mas os capitais também vinham do tráfico de escravos e do comércio com metrópoles colonialistas, como Portugal.... provavelmente, metade do ouro brasileiro acabou no Banco da Inglaterra e financiou estradas, portos, canais. A disponibilidade de capital, associada a um sistema bancário eficiente, com mais de quatrocentos bancos em 1790, explica a baixa taxa de juros; isto é, havia dinheiro barato para os empresários.<br>  <br>  Depois de capital, recursos naturais e merca-do, vamos ao quarto elemento essencial à industrializa??o, a transforma??o na estrutura agrária após a Revolu??o Inglesa. Com a gentry (pequena e média nobreza rural) no poder, dispararam os cercamentos (expuls?o de camponeses e uso da terra para cria??o de ovelhas), autorizados pelo Parlamento. A divis?o das terras coletivas beneficiou os grandes proprietários. As terras dos camponeses, os yeomen, foram reunidas num só lugar e eram t?o poucas que n?o lhes garantiam a sobrevivência: eles se transforma-ram em proletários rurais; deixaram de ser ao mesmo tempo agricultores e artes?os.<br>  <br>  Duas conseqüências se destacam: 1) diminuiu a oferta de trabalhadores na indústria doméstica rural, no momento em que ganhava impulso 0 mercado, tornando-se indispensável adotar nova forma de produ??o capaz de satisfazê-lo; 2) a proletariza??o abriu espa?o para o investimento de capital na agricultura, do que resultaram a especializa??o da produ??o, o avan?o técnico e o crescimento da produtividade.<br>  <br>  A popula??o cresceu, o mercado consumidor também; e sobrou m?o-de-obra para os centros industriais.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Mecaniza??o da Produ??o:<br>  As inven??es n?o resultam de atos individuais ou do acaso, mas de problemas concretos coloca-dos para homens práticos. O invento atende à necessidade social de um momento; do contrário, nasce morto. Da Vinci imaginou a máquina a vapor no século XVI, mas ela só teve aplica??o no ,século XVIII.<br>  <br>  Para alguns historiadores, a Revolu??o Industrial come?a em 1733 com a inven??o da lan?adeira volante, por John Kay. O instrumento, adaptado aos teares manuais, aumentou a capacidade de tecer; até ali, o tecel?o só podia fazer um tecido da largura de seus bra?os. A inven??o provocou desequilíbrio, pois come?a-ram a faltar fios, produzidos na roca. Em 1767, James Hargreaves inventou a spinning jenny, que permitia ao artes?o fiar de uma só vez até oitenta fios, mas eram finos e quebradi?os. A water frame de Richard Arkwright, movida a água, era econ?mica mas produzia fios grossos. Em 1779, S Samuel Crompton combinou as duas máquinas numa só, a mule, conseguindo fios finos e resistentes. Mas agora sobravam fios, desequilíbrio corrigido em 1785, quando Edmond Cartwright inventou o tear mecanico.<br>  <br>  Cada problema surgido exigia nova inven??o. Para mover o tear mecanico, era necessária uma energia motriz mais constante que a hidráulica, à base de rodas d’água. James Watt, aperfei?oando a máquina a vapor, chegou à máquina de movi-mento duplo, com biela e manivela, que transformava o movimento linear do pist?o em movimento circular, adaptando-se ao tear.<br>  <br>  Para aumentar a resistência das máquinas, a madeira das pe?as foi substituída por metal, o que estimulou o avan?o da siderurgia. Nos Esta-dos Unidos, Eli Whitney inventou o descaro?a-dor de algod?o.<br>  <br>   <br>  Revolu??o Social: <br>  A Revolu??o Industrial concentrou os trabalhadores em fábricas. O aspecto mais importante, que trouxe radical transforma??o no caráter do trabalho, foi esta separa??o: de um lado, capital e meios de produ??o (instala??es, máquinas, matéria-prima); de outro, o trabalho. Os operários passaram a assalariados dos capitalistas (donos do capital).<br>  <br>  Uma das primeiras manifesta??es da Revolu??o foi o desenvolvimento urbano. Londres chegou ao milh?o de habitantes em 1800. O progresso deslocou-se para o norte; centros como Manchester abrigavam massas de trabalhadores, em condi??es miseráveis. Os artes?os, acostumados a controlar o ritmo de seu trabalho, agora tinham de submeter-se à disciplina da fábrica. Passaram a sofrer a concorrência de mulheres e crian?as. Na indústria têxtil do algod?o, as mulheres formavam mais de metade da massa trabalhadora. Crian?as come?avam a trabalhar aos 6 anos de idade. N?o havia garantia contra acidente nem indeniza??o ou pagamento de dias para-dos neste caso.<br>  <br>  A mecaniza??o desqualificava o trabalho, o que tendia a reduzir o salário. Havia freqüentes paradas da produ??o, provocando desemprego. Nas novas condi??es, caíam os rendimentos, contribuindo para reduzir a média de vida. Uns se entregavam ao alcoolismo. Outros se rebelavam contra as máquinas e as fábricas, destruídas em Lancaster (1769) e em Lancashire (1779). Proprietários e governo organizaram uma defesa militar para proteger as empresas.<br>  <br>  A situa??o difícil dos camponeses e artes?os, ainda por cima estimulados por idéias vindas da Revolu??o Francesa, levou as classes dominantes a criar a Lei Speenhamland, que garantia subsistência mínima ao homem incapaz de se sustentar por n?o ter trabalho. Um imposto pago por toda a comunidade custeava tais despesas.<br>  <br>              Havia mais organiza??o entre os trabalhadores especializados, como os penteadores de l?. Inicialmente, eles se cotizavam para pagar o enterro de associados; a associa??o passou a ter caráter reivindicatório. Assim surgiram as tradeunions, os sindicatos. Gradativamente, conquistaram a proibi??o do trabalho infantil, a limita??o do trabalho feminino, o direito de greve.

She founded a religious order that carries on her work today.<br>  <br>  Both of these people also show, as others have done in the past, just how powerful a force for change that one person can be--something to consider when we fall back on the old excuse of "I'm only one person; what can I do?"|`|1vi7PX0Faa	It's Mahatma not Muhamed.

O97uZDN5aa	to answer the same tired, old question, edward cullen may not exactly be a pedophile, but he's definitely a creepy stalker. the guy followed a girl around for months and watched her sleep, without her knowledge! how obscenely eerie is that?!? the whole emotional abuse edward puts bella through is astounding. and this spineless girl thinks it's 'romantic' and that 'he's trying to protect her 'cause he luuuurrvvves her'. that's bullsh*t! plus the main point of the story is that to live happily ever after, you must be immortal, astoundingly beautiful and give up your family, friends, career aspirations (did bella even have friends? or a BRAIN??)

Well, technically, I suppose you could see it that way...

Try to fluff it up, meaning: pause in the right places to describe the scene and take your reader there. Latch onto the reader and her interest and promise never to let go.|`|za9b8cHKaa	Ooh, that Dwayne is nasty.<br>  <br>  There is a bit of telling instead of showing going on e.g. "It was Dwayne; then anger on his face was powerful" but the plot is interesting enough.|`|rOMTKmjDaa	I'm afraid it's all a bit too Lifetime for me.|`|hdcrxbSTaa	it's really intense! i'd want to read more.|`|49BRunStaa	well im a huge romantic so when i was reading your piece i got the feeling that jack and the main charactor have a thing.

You can find one at <a href="http://www.repairmyguitar.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.repairmyguitar.com</a>|`|7b63def867c561eab8cd40248dfce114aa	The buzz on your string is probably due to the set up of the guitar. <br>  <br>  The basic principle behind it is that your string is too loose and the amplitude of your string's vibration is taller than the distance it is from the fretboard. When you pluck it, it will start hitting the fretboard and it will cause an inconsistent, buzz sort of sound.<br>  <br>  The way to get rid of it is either to restring your guitar, or fix the bridge so that the string is farther away from the neck. Some acoustic guitars do not have adjustable necks, so you may have to just replace it and try to give it more tension.<br>  <br>  Good Luck. Have a nice day.

b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	It depends on the lighting conditions.  The "Sunny 16 Rule" says that on a clear, sunny day, you should set your shutter speed to the same as the ISO rating of your film, and then adjust the aperture for the lighting conditions.<br>  <br>  So in your case, you would set the shutter speed to 1/400 (or the closest available number) and set the aperture to f/16.  If it's a little hazy or partly cloudy, open the aperture to f/11.  In the shade, open the aperture to f/8.  In the late afternoon, close to sunset, you might need to open the aperture to f/5.6.  You'll have to judge the lighting conditions, and it takes practice.  But after you've practiced for a while, you'll get the hang of it and usually you won't even need a light meter.<br>  <br>  One other thing you need to remember is that the aperture setting will also affect the depth of field.  A wider aperture (smaller F-stop number) will have a more shallow depth of field, which will make the background look soft and blurry.  Sometimes that can be useful, for when you want to draw more attention to a subject in the foreground and blur out the background to make it less distracting.  That technique is called "selective focus."  But otherwise, if you want everything in your picture to be as sharp as possible, you should try to use a smaller aperture, like f/11 or f/16.<br>  <br>  You can also leave the aperture at the same setting, and change the shutter speed.  That can get a little tricky though.  Also, if you use a shutter speed around 1/50 or slower, you really need to put the camera on a tripod.  If you use a slow shutter speed, the camera will pick up any movement and even a tiny bit of vibration or camera shake will make the picture look blurry.<br>  <br>  The "Sunny 16 Rule" applies to both film and digital cameras.  It's a general guide for using manual exposure.|`|k8AcVixTaa	The general rule is to use the shutter speed that matches best to the ASA of the film you are using.  I would shoot the 400 at 1/500 of a second but open the lens from F16 to F11 or even F8 if using a telephoto lens.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	below is a link to recommended settings for ISO(asa) 400 film... this one was for Kodak slide film but will work in most cases|`|FeUmyxqqaa	the rule is f16@125th @100iso, so at 400iso @ f16 you need a shutter of 500th

He was married by a protestant minister (though this does not really say much- Queen Elizabeth locked all practicing catholic priests away in the tower. Those that held catholic views had to surpress them or endure imprisonment and in many cases death).<br>  <br>  Although Shakespeare was a Christian, he was very interested in the ideas of paganism and other early religions. This can be seen in plays such as King Lear and MacBeth.

AA12343309	There are 3 types of DNA tests.<br>  <br>  Y which goes from father to son only<br>  <br>  Mitochondrial which goes from mother to both sons and daughters but only the daughters pass it on to their children<br>  <br>  Autosomal which you get 50-50 from both parents.<br>  <br>  Y & Mitochondrial are used by people involved in family history to match themselves with other family trees, but they are a colossal waste of money for someone who just wants to get an idea of their regional/ethnic background. They represent a very small part of your DNA and a very tiny part of your ancestry.  The reason people find them valuable in family history is they both go back in a straight line virtually unchanged. <br>  <br>  However, if you were male and could have both done, right off the bat they would leave out your maternal grandfather and paternal grandmother. <br>  If you get back to your 6xgreat grandparents, you are directly descended from 510 individuals.<br>  Your ancestry pyramids as you go back.  You would get your Mitochondrial DNA from only 8 of those people and if you were a male you would get your Y DNA from only 8 leaving out a total of 494 people.  Since from your Avatar you are a female, you could only have Mitochondrial done and therefore it would leave out 502 people.<br>  <br>  Most of your DNA is Autosomal.  You have 23 chromosomes each from both parents. Only one each is made up of  your Mitochondrial and if you were male your Y.  They are the DNA that determines your sex.  The other 22 each have your Autosomal DNA and you get that 50-50 from both parents.  <br>  <br>  There is one company that will take your Autosomal DNA and match you with population groups throughout the world.  They won't tell you that you are 1/2 of something, 1/4 of something else and 1/4 of another something else.   What they will do is give you your top matches.  You have to understand that the same DNA crosses national, ethnic and racial boundaries.<br>  <br>  This is the only company in the U.S. that I know of that does Autosomal testiing for regional/ethnic affilliation.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.DNAtribes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.DNAtribes.com</a><br>  <br>  When you go into their website, there is a way you can email them by going under "feedback" and ask questions.<br>  <br>  FamilyTreeDNA does do Autosomal testing but they won't give you an analysis.  I think at one time they did.  I had to take my results from them and send them to DNATribes.<br>  <br>  Now, I asked DNATribes if my sister with whom I share both parents had the same Autosomal tests would her results be the same and they stated:<br>  <br>  "Two siblings will each obtain unique results. Family members do typically share some regional or ethnic genetic affiliations, but in some cases matches can vary substantially between siblings."<br>  <br>  While you get your Autosomal DNA 50-50 from both parents, it will not be a 25-25-25-25 breakdown from your grandparents.  You get 50% from your paternal grandparents and 50% from your maternal grandparents but the breakdown between grandmother and grandfather will not be even steven and it will vary between you and your siblings.<br>  <br>  Also I can see if there is more than company the results from others can have some differences due to one company not having population samples from certain areas that another will.<br>  <br>  Now, the companies that only use Y & Mitochondrial will advertise that they will help you discover your "deep ancestral roots."  They will show you the origin of your nomadic ancestors going back thousands of years but it is ONLY in two lines and you come from a myriad of family lines.  One company tried to tell me that the only reason a person would want their Autosomal done is if they were biracial.  That is a lot of malarky.  Don't let them spin you.<br>  <br>  This company does Y & Mitochondrial for free and is working to use Autosomal but they aren't at the present.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.smgf.org/pages/how_it_works.jspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.smgf.org/pages/how_it_works.j...</a> <br>  <br>  Also here is another link that explains DNA<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pa.msu.edu/~sciencet/ask_st/060293.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pa.msu.edu/~sciencet/ask_st/0...</a><br>  <br>  I had found a site that stated you don't get Autosomal 50-50 from both parents so I asked a question on the Biology board and got this reply.<br>  <br>  "Actually, you do inherit your autosomal DNA 50-50 from each parent. That site is wrong.<br>  <br>  "Your mother's egg contributes one set of 22 autosomes and one sex chromosome (an X). Your father's sperm contributes the other set of 22 autosomes, and another sex chromosome (either an X or a Y).<br>  <br>  "Where the 50-50 part breaks down is when you pass on your DNA to your children. Each of your children will get half their DNA from you, but they won't necessarily get an equal mix of what you inherited from your parents. They could inherit a more from your mother, through you, and less from your father, or vice versa.<br>  <br>  "Another way to look at it: you inherited 50% of your autosomal DNA from each parent, but you didn't necessarily inherit exactly 25% from each grandparent. Your maternal grandparents contributed exactly 50% in total, but it could be biased in favor of either your maternal grandmother or your maternal grandfather|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	There are two tests  know about. One is for sons of sons of sons . . . because we men get our Y chromosome from our dad entirely; none of it is from our mom. So, it is unchanged, except it shifts a little over time. In my care there is a fellow named Samuel Pack, my 4th great grandfather, who is a famous dead end (in Pack circles, at least). Samuel was born 1720 - 1740, probably.<br>  <br>  My DNA matched 34 out of 37 with another male Pack who was a proven descendant of a George Pack who died in Maryland in 1754 and had sons George and Samuel.<br>  <br>  So, my Samuel is almost certainly a son, grandson, nephew or grandnephew of their George, and if I hired someone to wade through the land records of Maryland I could probably prove it. That isn't the same as knowing it, but at least I have narrowed down the possibilities,<br>  <br>  The other thing they do is ask people where they are from. Then they compare your DNA to "Known" samples. Native Americans, Asians, some Jewish people and a number of other groups have known markers. So, they can take a stab at what ethnicities are rolling around inside you.<br>  <br>  Here is the FAQ page from the company I used<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.familytreedna.com/faq.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.familytreedna.com/faq.aspx</a>|`|9qYU2R2Daa	Ancestry by DNA is a good way to verify which countries your ancestors are from. The best company I know of is called DNA tribes and is in USA.<br>  Your autosomal DNA is tested to give you an analysis of your ancestry four generations back.

Have you ever said something like "this shirt makes me look fat", or  asked "Do these jeans make my butt look big?" well i think this quote is trying to tell us that we try to take our good qualities, and hide them behind the bad qualities. For example, I always am telling myself that I am fat and ugly, but others tell me im just to self conscious. <br>  <br>  This quote is trying to encourage us to show our light, or good qualities, instead of masking them with our bad qualities.

It causes them to have different opinions about life, it causes them to be noticeable, and as a result they fear someone criticizing them out of their own feelings of inferiority.

Think about how much time you spend thinking about other people or their negative traits and you'll see it's not much at all and that's exactly how much time they spend noticing your faults.

Smear it around the edges a bit.<br>  <br>  After that, lower the opacity to 30% and start building up a gradient. Lower the opacity to 5-10% as you get to the most faded parts of the gradient. Just remember, the lower the opacity the easier it is to get a smooth gradient. Use the smudge and blur tools if the gradient looks too coarse.<br>  <br>  You might want to turn up the brightness of your monitor to maximum every so often to check your work, as it will reveal imperfections in your gradient. <br>  <br>  Another option that probably won't look as good as handpainting it would be to use the radial gradient tool (setting the right side of the gradient to your darkest color, and the left side to 0% opacity), but it probably would look crappy. <br>  <br>  There might be a third party filter or macro that accomplishes this as well, but being a traditionalist I tend to like painting things by hand...|`|91bshee0aa	im not sure wat to call this effect 2 but the best web site for photoshop tutorials is <a href="http://www.tutorialized.com/tutorials/Photoshop/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.tutorialized.com/tutorials/Ph...</a><br>  .<br>   i agree with akhil_viju... its probably few effects used to make that photo and the person who made it knows for sure but i thing he played with lighting effect.. it would be much easer to say for certain if we could see the original picture|`|AA10833445	If U call it an effect, Only you know how you did it.

I suggest you use the next years to build up experience, stay in school, do drama in year 11 and 12, do amateur shows, extra-curricular classes, and then try applying for a local uni course. Trust me, there are too many actors out there and not enough roles. Everyone wants to be in Home and Away and Neighbours; very few actually do it. Not only that, but you're competing with all the NIDA graduates, which would make it that much harder.<br>  <br>  Those Aussie actors who are in Hollywood have spent the better part of 20 years developing their career - first in Australia, and then overseas. Do yourself a favour; take some classes and do some shows first.<br>  <br>  Think about attending WAAPA, NIDA or VCA or one of the many great courses out there (there are heaps) when you're ready. <br>  <br>  There's a lot of indie films being made in Australia, for which you can audition for without an agent; check the first link for examples, or Quiet On Set.<br>  <br>  DON'T sign up for one of those American talent sites. They are scams and never have anything for Australian auditions.

XUQaRpgxaa	To Kill a Mockingbird<br>  <br>  The story takes place during three years of the Great Depression in the fictional "tired old town" of Maycomb, Alabama. The narrator, six-year-old Scout Finch, lives with her older brother Jem and their widowed father Atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt for the summer. The three children are terrified of, and fascinated with, their neighbor, the reclusive "Boo" Radley. The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo and for many years, few have seen him. The children feed each other's imaginations with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house. Following two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone is leaving them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place. Several times, the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their disappointment, never appears in person.<br>  <br>  Atticus is appointed by the court to defend a black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a young white woman. Although many of Maycomb's citizens disapprove, Atticus agrees to defend Tom to the best of his ability. Other children taunt Jem and Scout for Atticus' actions, calling him a "******-lover". Scout is tempted to stand up for her father's honor by fighting, even though he has told her not to. For his part, Atticus faces a group of men intent on lynching Tom. This danger is averted when Scout, Jem, and Dill shame the mob into dispersing by forcing them to view the situation from Atticus's and Tom's points of view.<br>  <br>  Because Atticus does not want them to be present at Tom Robinson's trial, Scout, Jem, and Dill watch in secret from the colored balcony. Atticus establishes that the accusers—Mayella and her father, Bob Ewell, the town drunk—are lying. It also becomes clear that the friendless Mayella was making sexual advances towards Tom and her father caught her in the act. Despite significant evidence of Tom's innocence, the jury convicts him. Jem's faith in justice is badly shaken, as is Atticus', when a hopeless Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison.<br>  <br>  Humiliated by the trial, Bob Ewell vows revenge. He spits in Atticus' face on the street, tries to break into the presiding judge's house, and menaces Tom Robinson's widow. Finally, he attacks the defenseless Jem and Scout as they walk home from the school Halloween pageant. Jem's arm is broken in the struggle, but amid the confusion, someone comes to the children's rescue. The mysterious man carries Jem home, where Scout realizes that he is the reclusive Boo Radley.<br>  <br>  Maycomb's sheriff arrives and discovers that Bob Ewell has been killed in the struggle. The sheriff argues with Atticus about the prudence and ethics of holding Jem or Boo responsible. Atticus eventually accepts the sheriff's story that Ewell simply fell on his own knife. Boo asks Scout to walk him home, and after she says goodbye to him at his front door, he disappears again. While standing on the Radley porch, Scout imagines life from Boo's perspective and regrets that they never repaid him for the gifts he had given them.<br>  <br>  I can't really remember how it ends anymore i just posted the whole plot for you to read.<br>  <br>  Ciao!!|`|ARePrfj6aa	There is a Pageant for Maycomb County and Scout has to dress as a ham. On Scout & Jems way home from the pageant (it's night and halloween), they get attacked by a man (Bob Ewell) He was planning to stab them with a knife, but the chicken wire in Scouts costume saved her life. Someone saved Scout and Jem, and got them home. JEms arm was broken. The are various people sitting in Jems room (dr, Sheriff Tate, Atticus, Scout, and the man who saved them). Scout realizes who the man is and it is Boo Radley. Boo had also stabbed Bob Ewell and killed him to save the kids. Since he was shy & didn't like to be in the limelight, they announced Bob fell on the knife and died. That's pretty much it. :)|`|DvToP5h7aa	Explanation of Chapters 27 - 31 ("Part 5") <br>  <br>  Although Jem and Scout could have died, the incident with Bob Ewell serves as a vindication for the Finch family and their values. Bob Ewell, who the town stands behind during Tom's trial, turns out to be a man so cowardly that he not only stalks Helen Robinson, he tries to kill two innocent children. And the man who comes to their rescue is none other than Boo Radley, a man whose self-imposed exile has made him the prime topic of gossip in Maycomb. It was Atticus and his children who understood these men no matter what the situation. Although the town knew Bob Ewell to be trash, they would defend him over an innocent black man. It was Atticus who saw the truth and stood by that. <br>  <br>  As for Boo Radley, it was Scout, in chapter 31, who points out that anyone who saw her walking Boo Radley back to his home would see a real gentleman. Not the man Stephanie Crawford claimed looked into her windows, but a man who came out of seclusion to save two children. We also now know that it had been Boo who was leaving the presents in the tree for Jem and Scout. He has been watching them for many years. Boo Radley is a sensitive and kind man who apparently has had quite an affinity for the children all these years. <br>  <br>  Throughout this entire ordeal, the Finch family has survived. Much has been heaped upon them the past months and years, but all have come out stronger for it, Jem and Scout in particular. They have gained a new sense of human nature and are better people because of it. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.homework-online.com/tkamb/part05e.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.homework-online.com/tkamb/par...</a>|`|17b8d68d2416136c4c415502cc901eeaaa	scout is in a thanksgiving pageant at school dressed as a ham. then when jem is walking her home, they get attacked by that ewell guy, but boo radley saves them and ends up being a really cool dude. the end.|`|Yz981zO6aa	In the very end, Scout is sitting in Atticus's lap as he reads to her at Jem's bedside ( Jem has a broken arm) and it says "he will be there when Jem wakes up in the morning"|`|xJoMSkI5aa	The last line of the book, however, suggests the possibility for some kind of happy ending: “[Atticus] would be there all night, and he would be there when Jem waked up in the morning” (31.56). How hopeful is this ending? On the one hand, whatever danger may threaten, Atticus will always be there to counter it. On the other, he’s basically doing damage control, watching over his unconscious son after he was nearly killed. While the ending offers a comforting image, it comes out of pain and struggle, implying that neither the comfort nor the pain wholly wins out.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/What's Up With the Ending?/To Kill A Mockingbird|`|ceBTTCPwaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<br>  <br>  These links should give you detailed and excellent answers to this and other questions :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html</a>

AA12047401	The destructive power of jealousy, maybe?|`|DvToP5h7aa	Jealousy<br>  <br>  Othello is the most famous literary work that focuses on the dangers of jealousy. The play is a study of how jealousy can ruin lives – even with only the most circumstantial evidence of guilt. Jealousy here is harnessed as a weapon, a weapon made so lethal because its victim ultimately destroys himself and others around him. It is interesting that Iago uses jealousy against Othello, yet jealousy is likely the source of Iago’s hatred in the first place. In Othello, jealousy takes many forms, from sexual suspicion to professional competition, but it is, in all cases, destructive. <br>  <br>  Full List of Themes:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/themes/literature/william-shakespeare/othello.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/themes/literature/...</a><br>  <br>  ===============================<br>  <br>  Do not use these essays as your own, teachers are not stupid and any seismic changes in your ability will stand out like a sore thumb.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.slashdoc.com/docs/O-12.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.slashdoc.com/docs/O-12.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.slashdoc.com/docs/O-13.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.slashdoc.com/docs/O-13.html</a>|`|4eJpf7o2aa	I have no sample essays for you but I can give you the themes and motifs, at the top of my head.<br>  <br>  - Racism<br>  - Manipulation<br>  - Jealousy<br>  - Betrayal<br>  - Power (this includes the Power of Love in reference to Desdemona's love for Othello).|`|A6mczoMbaa	White vs. Black, clearly.

cWuumdy7aa	The International Standard Book Number, or ISBN, is a unique umeric commercial book identifier based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering (SBN) code created by Gordon Foster, now Emeritus Professor of Statistics at Trinity College, Dublin for the booksellers and stationers W.H. Smith and others in 1966.<br>  <br>  The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108. (However, the 9-digit SBN code was used in the United Kingdom until 1974.) Currently, the ISO’s TC 46/SC 9 is responsible for the ISBN.<br>  <br>  Since 1 January 2007, ISBNs have contained 13 digits, a format that is compatible with Bookland EAN-13s.<br>  <br>  A similar numeric identifier, the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN), identifies periodical publications such as magazines.<br>  <br>  An ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a book. The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned after January 1, 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007. An International Standard Book Number consists of 4 or 5 parts:<br>  <br>   <br>  The parts of a 10-digit ISBN and the corresponding EAN-13 and barcode. Note the different check digits in each. The part of the EAN-13 labeled "EAN" is the Bookland country codefor a 13 digit ISBN, a GS1 prefix: 978 or 979 <br>  the group identifier, (language-sharing country group)<br>  the publisher code, <br>  the item number, and <br>  a checksum character or check digit. <br>  The ISBN parts may be of different lengths, and usually are separated with hyphens or spaces. <br>  <br>  The group identifier is a 1 to 5 digit number. The single digit group identifiers are: 0 or 1 for English-speaking countries; 2 for French-speaking countries; 3 for German-speaking countries; 4 for Japanese; 5 for Russian, and 7 for Chinese. An example 5 digit group identifier is 99936, for Bhutan. In general, the groups are 0–7, 80–94, 950–993, 9940–9989, and 99900–99999.[7] The original standard book number (SBN) had no group identifier, but affixing a zero (0) as prefix to a 9-digit SBN creates a valid 10-digit ISBN. Group identifiers form a prefix code; compare with country calling codes.<br>  <br>  The national ISBN agency assigns the publisher number (cf. the category:ISBN agencies); the publisher selects the item number. Generally, a book publisher is not required to assign an ISBN, nor is it necessary for a book to display its number (except in China; see below). However, most book stores only handle ISBN-bearing merchandise.<br>  <br>  A listing of all the 628,000 assigned publisher codes is published, and can be ordered in book form (€558, US$915.46). The web site of the international ISBN agency does not offer any free method of looking up publisher codes.<br>  <br>  Publishers receive blocks of ISBNs, with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them; a small publisher may receive ISBNs of one or more digits for the group identifier code, several digits for the publisher, and a single digit for the individual items. Once that block of ISBNs is used, the publisher may receive another block of ISBNs, with a different publisher number. Consequently, a publisher may have different allotted publisher numbers. There also may be more than one group identifier used in a country. This might occur if a popular identifier has used up all of its numbers. The cited list of identifiers shows this has happened in China and in more than a dozen other countries.<br>  <br>  By using variable block lengths, a large publisher will have few digits allocated for the publisher number and many digits allocated for titles; likewise countries publishing much will have few allocated digits for the group identifier, and many for the publishers and titles.

In a perfect speech situation (hypoth) as described by Habermass the words I use will have an identical meaning for you as they do for me. Language s both vague and ambiguous. If I were to say to you "I have just been stung by a large bee", without me showing you a picture or something of similar size to the bee in question, how can you possibly interpret the word 'large' in the way I mean? You have your own mind's eye view of  a large bee.<br>  This whole thing goes a lot deeper as in most speech situations we are describing our take on reality, how we believe things to be, our interpretation of it, from the data our sensory apparatus presents it to us. So in speech we almost always speak in general terms with broad meanings.<br>  I would say that for most of us emotional detachment in thought is virtually impossible but being aware of the role our felings play in 'rational'(?) thought does help.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Philosophy is the high holy church of the obscure.

After the great revolt of 1957, the anti British feelings and a sense of nationalism started growing simultaneously. The circumstances led to emergence of the sense of nationalism mainly were (1) Influence of English education and english literature. (2) Down fall of domestic economic condition (3) Economic exploitation under British rule, <br>  (4) Differential treatment between British and Indians (5) Emergence of Indian literature - contribution of Bankim Ch chattopadhyay,(1838), Rabindranath Tagore(1861), Swami Vivekananda (1864),(6) Emergence of various social and political organisations like Brahmo samaj, British Indian Association(1851), Bombay Association (1852), etc.(7) Influence of National News paper and magazines(8) Ilbert bill controversy and of course the back drop of reformation movement led by Rammohun Roy and others.

ceBTTCPwaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<br>  <br>  These links should give you detailed and excellent answers to this and other questions :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html</a>|`|DvToP5h7aa	All the recourses that you're likely to need.<br>  <br>  To Kill a Mockingbird - Harper Lee<br>  <br>  Study Guides:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/harper-lee/to-kill-a-mockingbird.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aresearchguide.com/mock.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aresearchguide.com/mock.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.homework-online.com/tkamb/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.homework-online.com/tkamb/ind...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bellmore-merrick.k12.ny.us/mockingbird.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bellmore-merrick.k12.ny.us/mo...</a><br>  <br>  A Research Guide<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aresearchguide.com/mock.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aresearchguide.com/mock.html</a>|`|otqMLiiRaa	when atticus exits the court house after defending tom robinson. scout doesnt undersatnd why all the black people stand up when he leaves but jem does.

TbTO5SXlaa	You are looking at two very different kinds of photography. However, with the right equipment one camera can be used for both.<br>  <br>  Your idea of investing in a DSLR is correct. It merely becomes a question of which DSLR. Since you've used a film camera the transition will be much easier for you. If you have several lenses for your film camera then you'd be smart to stay with that same brand of DSLR - unless your film camera is a Canon F series which used the FD lens mount or an Olympus OM series or a Minolta SRT or X series. Unfortunately lenses for those cameras are not compatible with their current DSLR counterparts. <br>  <br>  When Canon introduced the auto focus Rebel 35mm film cameras they abandoned the FD lens mount for the EF mount.<br>  <br>  When Minolta introduced the world's first full-featured auto focus 35mm SLR (the Minolta Maxxum 7000, 1985) they abandoned the SR lens mount for the A-mount. The current Sony DSLR cameras use the A-mount.<br>  <br>  When Olympus adopted the 4/3 format for their DSLR cameras they abandoned the OM mount.<br>  <br>  Nikon has lens compatibility dating back almost 50 years. Almost every Nikkor lens ever made can be used with the current Nikon DSLR cameras.<br>  <br>  Pentax is still using the K-mount first introduced in 1975 so any K-mount lens ever made can be used on their current DSLR cameras.<br>  <br>  One bonus offered by Sony and Pentax is they have their respective versions of Image Stabilization (IS) in the camera body. That means that a 20 + yr. old Minolta maxxum AF lens on a Sony A300 will become an IS lens, just a a 30 + yr. old Pentax lens will on a Pentax K200D. Nikon and Canon can't make that claim since they have their respective versions of IS only in certain lenses.<br>  <br>  Now back to landscapes and underwater photography.<br>  <br>  For landscapes a tripod is one of the best accessories you can have. A good wide-angle is also needed. You also need to know how to maximize your Depth of Field (DOF) with your camera and lens. One of the best places to learn this is at: <a href="http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html</a>  Here you can calculate DOF for any lens. f-stop, focal length and subject distance.<br>  If you're unsure as to what DOF actually is go to: <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/learn/?/key=depth+of+field" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpreview.com/learn/?/key=dept...</a>  This is a good, eay to understand explanation.<br>  <br>  I know from yrs. of experience that if I focus my 21mm lens at 6 feet and use f16 my DOF will be from 2'-2" to infinity. I shoot in Aperture Priority and use a cable release to trip the shutter. The shutter speed is whatever the camera sets and since I use a trpod its not important. Obviously you'll want to be in manual focus since you probably won't have a subject 6 feet away in your landscape. <br>  <br>  (NOTE: Shutter speed would, of course, be important if its a windy day. Then I might use a higher ISO since I refuse to give up f16).<br>  <br>  So for the best results in landscape photography:<br>  1) Use a tripod<br>  2) Shoot at your camera's highest resolution<br>  3) Use a low ISO<br>  4) Use Aperture Priority<br>  5) Use manual focus<br>  6) Use a cable release or the camera's self-timer to release the shutter<br>  <br>  For underwater photography you'll need an underwater housing for your camera. These are very pricey. You can check here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.scuba.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.scuba.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.marinevisions.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.marinevisions.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.housingcamera.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.housingcamera.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/underwatercamerahousings" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/underwatercamerah...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ikelite.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ikelite.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ewamarine.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewamarine.com</a><br>  <br>  If you plan to go deeper than a meter or so you'll probably need a waterproof flash or other light source. <br>  <br>  In my opinion, unless you plan on doing a whole lot of underwater photography, one of the Olympus Stylus SW series of water proof and shock proof cameras might be a really cheap alternative.<br>  <br>  ****** EDIT ******<br>  <br>  I forgot to mention that every lens you own should have its own UV/Haze filter to protect the front element. You'll also want a circular polarizer to darken a blue sky and remove glare/reflections from glass, water, snow, sand and painted metal - but not from polished metal. I suggest buying your filters in a "thin" or "slim" mount for use with wide-angle lenses. Don't waste money and risk image quality with cheap filters. Buy Hoya, B+W, Heliopan or Tiffen brands. Add a lens cloth and you're good to go.|`|wwmArsKJaa	Instead of thinking digital, try thinking film first. This will teach you the basics, as well as help you to learn from your mistakes, instead of just erasing, or correcting them. Additionally, you'll spend a lot less money on the camera itself. You will be buying film a lot, but that's the beauty of learning from your mistakes. You'll become more selective about your shots. As far as lenses are concerned, start with a couple of decent zooms. Perhaps a 35-70, and a 70-200 for starters. A polarizer will be good for enhancing color, and reducing glare. If you decide to work in b&w, consider purchasing at least a deep red filter for enhancing contrast. You can get other colors as well, and they will have different effects.<br>  If you're going to do underwater photography, there are a few waterproof models out there. A decent camera shop ( not Ritz ) should have a good selection to show you.<br>  Whatever you do, start with film first, and get your basics down.|`|Pc7TjHMjaa	I have no experience doing actual underwater photography, so I can't help there at all.  I have done some at an aquarium and those photos came out okay, but I have more camera than I had back then.<br>  <br>  I would not recommend buying a film camera, especially not a new one.  The film people are hardcore about film and I respect that.  I just don't agree.  With my current camera and an empty memory card (8 Gig CF card, cost me $25 US) I can shoot about 3400 pictures with a 10.1 megapixel camera.  Doing the math on that is purely pointless.<br>  <br>  I am a working guy photographer.  I make a little money at it, but nothing worth bragging about.  I shoot Olympus.  I have an e-500 and and e-510 and 4 lenses.  Its not a great camera in low light, but in all other situations, it has done a great job for me.  The Olympus E-520 kit is available for about $550 US new, with 2 lenses.  My advice to everyone is buy what you want the first time around.  Don't settle and find yourself kicking yourself 2 months down the road because you didn't.  There are a quite a few lenses available for the 4/3 system which wasn't always true.<br>  <br>  As far as filters and such, its totally your choice what you want to do.  Circular polarizers are like everything else, you get what you pay for.  I had a nice one for my old camera which I used a few times.  I bought a cheap one from Ebay that I used one time and probably will never get out again.  It is unlikely that I will buy another one.<br>  <br>  My favorite filter by a lot was my Hoya Infrared (or near infrared if you're hardcore) filter.   I used it with my old Olympus C5050 (which I kept around strictly for its IR capabilites) and turned out some amazing shots.  SLRs from what I am told, are not capable of infrared shooting due to the mirror.  I did hear you can replace the mirror with glass and it will work, but I'm not destroying a camera to find out.  This is one of my favorite images that I took with the IR filter.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pbase.com/inspzil/image/18301191" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbase.com/inspzil/image/18301...</a><br>  <br>  Bottom line - More megapixels is better.  Stick with the big names, Canon - Nikon - Olympus - Sony.  I've heard some good things about Sony's dSLR.  Good Luck|`|tZnsc6hvaa	It could depend on what kind of underwater photography that you are taking.Underwater photography could mean the kind that you'd do in your aquarium, or the one when you go into the sea to snorkel and take pictures.

By the same token, one must understand that the words, the tone, and the voice will impact the reception of the poem when it reaches each reader or listener.  Thus, if profanity is necessary, you need to use it, but if it would diminish the message, or be added just for shock value, then it probably should have been left out.  There is no general rule...but if you want to use profanity in a venue that prohibits it, then you need to be aware of the censorship to come.|`|qMy3vsSUaa	Answering your interesting question:<br>  I ain't no edjucated guy, ma'am, but here is what I think: <br>  Profanity IS profanity. The four letter words are used in some poems, but when I come think of it, I find it doesn't relate to the original meaning of poetry.<br>   Those great poets and writers were masters of English that they used words/expressions which enriched the intended meaning away from the F-words. They had full respect for English, English literature, the field of poetry, and the reader.. and their poetry could be read by any (age).  <br>  There ain't no censorship involved here, no limitation on freedom of expressing one's feeling, and none of that crap...<br>  Its just hard for me to read a poem written in a gutter language. <br>  How many in this section 'd put up with the crappy language of rap songs, or its attached KINETIC education, or the IQ level of its teenage fans.<br>  The bottom line is: when the poet uses the FwordK, that means he is out of words, vocabulary, alternative expressions, you name it.. or else he ain't having no respect for his reader.. when poets are suppose to make the world more beautiful!!!  <br>  <br>  This poem is a perfect form for bringin' out such genuine question.|`|ffpuzctBaa	Life is not pure, therefore poetry shouldn't be either. Poetry, as much as it is an art form, is an expression of the human experience in all its forms.

He became a Marxist while working as  library assistant at Peking University and served in the revolutionary army during the 1911 Chinese Revolution.<br>  <br>  Inspired by the Russian Revolution the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was established in Shanghai by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao in June 1921. Early members included Mao, <br>  <br>  Over next few years Mao, Zhu De and Zhou Enlai adapted  ideas of Lenin who had successfully achieved a revolution in Russia, argued that in Asia it was important to concentrate on the countryside rather than the towns. <br>  <br>  Mao worked as a Kuomintang political organizer in Shanghai. With the help of Soviet Union the Kuomintang gradually increased power in China. Chiang Kai-Shek as new leader of the Kuomintang carried out a purge that eliminated the communists. Those communists who survived established the Jiangxi Soviet. <br>  <br>  nationalists imposed a blockade and Mao Zedong decided to evacuate the area to new stronghold in  north-west of China. In  1934 Mao  and some 100000 men and their dependents headed west. <br>  <br>  They experienced  hardships.  passages included  crossing of  suspension bridge over  deep gorge at Luting, travelling over  Tahsueh Shan mountains and swampland of Sikang .<br>  <br>  The marchers covered about fifty miles a day and reached Shensi. It is estimated that only around 30,000 survived 8,000-mile Long March. <br>  <br>  When Japanese Army invaded heartland of China 1937, Chiang Kai-Shek was forced to move his capital from Nanking to Chungking. He lost coastal regions and most of  major cities to Japan. he agreed to collaborate with Mao Zedong and his communist army. <br>  <br>  During Second World War Mao's well-organized guerrilla forces were well led by Zhu De and Lin Biao. As soon as  Japanese surrendered, Communist forces began a war against  Nationalists  communists gradually gained control of  country on 1949<br>  <br>  In 1958 Mao announced  Great Leap Forward, an attempt to increase agricultural and industrial production. This reform programme included  establishment of large agricultural communes containing as many as 75,000 people.  communes ran their own collective farms and factories. Each family received a share of the profits and also had a small private plot of land. However, three years of floods and bad harvests severely damaged levels of production.  scheme was also hurt by the decision of the Soviet Union to withdraw its large number of technical experts working in  country. In 1962 Mao's reform programme came to an end and  country resorted to a more traditional form of economic production. <br>  <br>  As a result of the failure on the Great Leap Forward, Mao retired from the post of chairman of the People's Republic of China. His place as head of state was taken by Liu Shaoqi. Mao remained important in determining overall policy. In the early 1960s Mao became highly critical of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union. He was for example appalled by the way Nikita Khrushchev backed down over  Cuban Missile Crisis.<br>  <br>  Mao became openly involved in politics in 1966 when with Lin Biao he initiated Cultural Revolution. <br>  Lin Biao compiled some of Mao's writings into handbook, The Quotations of Chairman Mao, and arranged for a copy of what became known as the Little Red Book. <br>  <br>  Zhou Enlai at first gave his support to the campaign but became concerned when fighting broke out between the Red Guards and the revisionists. In order to achieve peace at the end of 1966 he called for an end to these attacks on party officials. Mao remained in control of the Cultural Revolution and was able to oust the revisionists. <br>  <br>   Cultural Revolution came to an end when Liu Shaoqi resigned from all his posts on  1968. Lin Biao now became Mao's designated successor.<br>  <br>  Mao now gave his support to Gang of Four: Jiang Qing (Mao's fourth wife), Wang Hongwen, Yao Wenyuan and Zhange Chungqiao. These four radicals occupied powerful positions in the Politburo after the Tenth  Congress of 1973. <br>  <br>  Mao Zedong died in Beijing on 1976.|`|iEBlvAkWaa	Wikipedia has loads on him.

I presume you mean the most recent siege in 1798 or 99 (I have no reference handy) when Bonaparte tried to take it.<br>  <br>  Briefly, then, Bonaparte had lost his Mediterranean fleet in the battle at Aboukir Bay. He pressed on with part of his army, hoping to march north through Syria and overthrow the Ottoman Empire. His aim was to establish a French empire in the near East and move on to India, disrupting British trade.<br>  <br>  Acre was held by Djezzah, a bloodthirsty fellow but without military aptitude. Capt. Sir Sidney Smith RN arrived to reinforce him with two warships, and captured the French cannon which were being sent round to the siege by sea. When the French army arrived, they found their own guns grinning at them from the walls.<br>  <br>  The fighting was long and bloody. After unsuccessful attempts to storm the town, the French withdrew in disarray to Egypt. Bonaparte had a plan to facilitate the withdrawal by killing his own sick and wounded with opium overdoses, but was prevented by his head of medical services who flatly refused to cooperate. <br>  <br>  There is much more to tell, but this is enough for now. One last word - Sidney Smith has the honour of being the first leader to defeat Bonaparte in a land campaign.|`|AA11657414	two good answers about the same city 600 years apart!|`|6e8af9deff7a2588bb4959771651cb16aa	1187 saw the crusader kingdoms reach their low point. The crusaders fought amongst themselves, while at the same time Saladin was unifying large parts of the Muslim world, eventually coming to surround the crusaders. Despite this, the crusaders failed to observe their truce with Saladin, and eventually Saladin decided on war. In June 1187 he invaded Palestine. Guy of Lusignan, king of Jerusalem, was able to raise an army of almost equal size to Saladins', but it was badly led, and the crusaders suffered a decisive defeat at the battle of Hattin (4 July 1187). Guy was captured, while the most able Crusader leader, Raymond of Tripoli, died of his wounds after the battle. The aftermath of the defeat saw the effective end of all but a tiny remnant of the crusader kingdoms. With their garrisons lost, Saladin was able to capture most cities, including Tiberias, Acre and Ascalon. Only at Tyre, where a combination of strong defences, and the arrival of Conrad of Montferrat with fresh troops thwarted Saladin. From Tyre, he moved on Jerusalem, which surrendered to him on 2 October 1187. News of the lose of Jerusalem broke on a stunned Europe, where moves were soon in hand for a fresh crusade, the Third. However, for the moment those crusaders left in Palestine has to survive.<br>  <br>  The defences of Tyre were amongst the strongest in Palestine, with land access to the city only along a narrow isthmus, heavily defended by a series of walls. After the fall of Jerusalem, Saladin returned to besiege the city with a stronger army, complete with a siege train, and combined with a fleet. However, the siege engines proved to be unequal to the task, and his fleet was destroyed in a battle with the crusaders. Saladin withdrew to besiege Krak des Chevaliers, leaving the crusaders with a safe port for reinforcements. However, the crusaders continued to squabble amongst themselves. When Guy of Lusignan, released by Saladin under oath not to take up arms, found a priest to declare the oath invalid, Conrad refused to give him control of Tyre. Luckily, Saladin concentrated on the Crusader castles in northern Syria, before in March 1189 returning to Damascus.<br>  <br>  The Siege Begins<br>  Reinforcements for the crusaders has been slowly arriving at Tyre. Early in 1188 two hundred Sicilian Knights had arrived, while in April 1189 an expedition from Pisa joined them. This party soon argued with Conrad, and accepted the leadership of Guy, then camped outside Tyre. Encouraged by this reinforcement, Guy decided on a desperate move to regain himself a capitol, and at the end of August marched towards Acre. The expedition should have been a total disaster. The garrison of Acre was twice the size of Guy's army, while Saladin with his main army was in the area. A combination of illness and cautious advice decided Saladin against such a move, and Guy was allowed to reach Acre, arriving on 28 August 1189.<br>  <br>  Acre had been the favourite residence of the kings of Jerusalem, as well as the richest of the crusader cities, and was strongly defended, by the sea to the west and south and by strong land walls to the north and east. Saladin had visited the city several times since capturing it, and it was well garrisoned and supplied. Three days after arriving at the city, and despite the disparity of numbers, Guy launched a direct assault on the city, which predictably failed. <br>  <br>  Reinforcements arrive<br>  It was soon clear that Saladin had made a grave mistake in not attack Guy before he reached Acre. New parties of crusaders, motivated by the fall of Jerusalem were beginning to arrive in Palestine, and Guy's active siege of Acre attracted most of them. In early September a Danish fleet (which allowed a blockade by sea) and a Flemish and French contingent arrived, while by the end of September a German party arrived. These were all small contingents, and the main body of crusaders were not to arrive until 1191, but they were sufficient to alarm Saladin, who moved to attack Guy's camp on 15 September. Although the attack failed, contact was made with the garrison, and the two forces found themselves camped very close to each other.<br>  <br>  Soon after this attack, Guy was strengthened by a truce of sorts with Conrad of Montferrat, who agreed to join the siege although not to obey Guy. With this reinforcement, the crusaders decided to launch an attack on Saladin's camp (4 October). Confusion within the Muslim forces nearly handed the crusaders a great victory. Saladin's nephew Taki, commander of the right wing, feinted a retreat, with the intention of luring the Templers into a foolish attack. Unluckily, he also fooled Saladin, who moved troops from the centre to help his nephew. Saladin's right and centre broke and fled, with the crusaders in pursuit. Saladin then counter attacked with his undefeated left wing, forcing the crusaders to retreat into their fortified camp, where Saladin was unwilling to follow. The battle had been a victory for Saladin, but still left the crusa
6JD1KKYcaa	this is funny!<br>  the poem is simply describing the room.|`|213df96cd601a86457f2e97e4a811bb8aa	I think it is a very funny and entertaining poem. I don't think too much attention has been paid to metre, rhyme and rhythm, but its the humourous surprise element at the end that is its high point. The descriptions are very real too -- all elements of a messy boy's room.
LEp7IFdvaa	The poem is about how we should look to the world of innocence that children inherently understand, but we as adults forget in the hustle and bustle of everyday life.  The poem is written in rhyme in the following pattern: aabbba (although he uses slant or half rhyme), then cdeeed and eeed.  The feet are 434443, 434443, 4443.  The reason there aren't more "feet" is because he uses anapaestic combinations rather than iambic or trochaic.  "blows black" is an alliteration, "peppermint wind" is a metaphor, as are "asphalt flowers", "chalk-white arrows".

cTvP6j7Haa	I'm oldish, but fear has not set in.  What i've heard is that the older you get the less the fear becomes.  To an eighty year old, it makes no difference ~ happy to be alive and just as happy to move on.  So I live until it is time to go, which, by the way, is my decision.  And if  I've accomplished anything or done nothing is only my responsibility.  Not my parents, wife, church or religion could force me to do anything that I (can't make a bigger capital) did, or did not want to do.  Good bye very nice, cruel world.<br>  Peace.|`|8379c575798db3493c5c0194efc05e70aa	Can I want to live forever or is that not allowed?

7ONKVbbiaa	It is standard. IF you have documents in-family that reliably provides the info, then you can skate by, without them. If you know when they died, have you tried defining the name of the funeral home, and contacting them? They will have a file with the death certificates, and in many cases, provide that to family members. In other words, the record IS valuable, but there MIGHT be other ways to get it. For some of us.. the funeral home is 12 states away. For you, it might be a 1/2 hour drive. <br>  However.. the general cut off line for birth/death CERTIFICATES (not the same as "record") is about 1900, and varies from state to state. Even if your ancestors were here in 1700, that means you would be shifting to other types of documents. Example.. a probate file is standard when someone dies, to deal with their property. This is even when they didn't leave a will. <br>  Once you get into the 1800s, what you find in other countries is random. The main source may be church records. EACH COUNTRY will have its own specifics. My personal experience is that I have not worked overseas as much as US. <br>  At rootsweb.com's front page.. look to the top where it says mail lists, then click to find ones for the various countries. Free, dear..right to your mailbox. There also is a volunteer network called usgenweb, which includes a world version. In other words, sites to focus on what the other countries have. <br>  On the surface, it may seem that if you get one record with the info, that is enough. Sometimes not. The reason is that ANY record can have a mistake. It usually shows up by having 2 things, and they conflict. So, which is the RIGHT answer? You have to evaluate each to juggle the facts, or get a 3rd item. If you only have one item.. the error might be there, but you won't see that it is wrong. Same with the census.. you are getting the top of the iceberg, and not seeing what is on the original. I don't have a subscription at this time, or I would email jpegs to you. Once you see some of the original pages, you'll see what I have been saying. Same for some of the offline sources. Since I started research 30+ yrs back, there was NO internet to do this. That isn't a bad thing, because it means I am aware of how much is OUT there but not on the computer. <br>  Props to you for your enthusiasm. Mostly it is the older folks who care about the ancestry (read-we have credit cards). There always is SOME $$ involved, but you find what is easily out there, then go for more if need be. As you are finding.. it takes time to zero in on ONE FACT for each of them, each of them are different (so the same source won't work for everyone). Genealogy is never "done". <br>  Hang in there. It is a learning thing.|`|an1b4pXxaa	Hi Tom, this doesn't answer your question but have you seen this record?

ugiUyhOwaa	Well, in the past stories, vampires are popular to be weak under the sun's rays. So, it means that they do not go under the sun, which makes their skins white (and sometimes pale white).<br>  <br>  But as the time passes, authors began to create their own versions of vampires. In Twilight by Stephenie Meyer, for example. Vampires do not burn under the sun but shines instead while P.C. Cast and Kristin Cast's House of Night Series, sunlight only makes a vampire fledgling uncomfortable. This alteration to the vampires nowadays can make them not only of the white race but also the other races. <br>  <br>  So maybe the answer to your question is: Vampires differe in every story because it is an author's interpretation of  a vampire.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	It depends on the how the author has decided vampire-ness is defined. <br>  <br>  Sometimes they can walk in the sun, other times they sparkle, and some times they perish.<br>  <br>  It also depends on if they differ at all from when they were turned (if they are turned vampires as opposed to born vamps). Some stay identical to how they were when their human lives ended. So if they were tanned then they will be in the after life.|`|cgz85foTaa	Not all vampires die when they go into the sun.  They did originally, but nowadays authors have come up with own interpretation.  It depends on what the author wants vampires to be.|`|213df96cd601a86457f2e97e4a811bb8aa	I guess it is just up to the imagination of the writer.

Aim for "5 veg + 2 fruit" serves a day.<br>  At least eight glasses of water a day, also don't forget calcium. A big glass of skim milk on a regular basis is one way to go.<br>  Steer clear of smokes, over indulgence in alcohol and artificial sweeteners, which contain a few nasties and also hype you up on too much caffeine, which can make you overly confident = injury.<br>  You're getting heaps of exercise already, so the occasional treat is perfectly fine, just try and avoid having takeaway and crap as actual meals.

AA10729271	Do some research, find out which publishers have children's book divisions and try to get in touch with someone from their art department, just like an writer you send them some of your best work and then hope they like it. Most will provide submission's guildlines, like formats etc. You could also aim for being a cover artist, sometimes that can pay decently, romance novels covers's can be quite profitable since they tend to have the same artist illustrate the same series.
LEp7IFdvaa	Yes, I understand.  It is not uncommon to wonder on ones existence, especially at so young an age.  It sometimes seems as though you shouldn't be here, that your very being is somehow a mistake...but the reality is that you "are" here, and that you do have a purpose, although you may not know it.  The good news is that those who wonder about this end up being very self-aware and become very productive members of society because they've taken the time to study themselves as well as others.|`|vtafeEIJaa	Thanks for your time......It`s fine|`|AA11590905	I like your poems.

Besides, why would you trust the writing advice of someone who can't even SPELL "writing" and who recommends that you read a lot of Dan Brown?

Difficult in the sense that I know of only one mainstream writer that did it well and that was Erica Jong. Regardless of your skill it always seems somewhat awkward. I would leave it as bland as possible and more or less for the imagination.<br>  Perhaps, the most important thing is not to spend to much time on it. The editor of the book is going to get rid of it anyway so why waste your time on something that I can guarantee you is going in the trash.<br>  <br>  s_e_s|`|7CHt3IE1aa	The defining reason for including/excluding a sex scene depends on yr target audience, as everybody has already said, but something to consider is your own comfort level- if you can write a good sex scene, then why not write it and then decide if you want to keep it. If you can't, then don't bother worrying about it.<br>  <br>  Mr point is, I am very good at dialogue, and scenes of violence, but I can't write a sex scene without embarressing myself, so I don't tend to bother. If I felt like my work HAD to have one, I would just need to keep chipping away.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, I don't know what Spooky e is talking about- an editor won't automatically cut anything out of your book.|`|za9b8cHKaa	If the target audience are over the age of 14 and if it is useful to the plot then I think it is acceptable. Like you said, you are not going to go into great detail. Sometimes simply implying that they occur or avoiding them can make your writing seem immature.|`|Q7H8hZJDaa	Why not? ;)<br>  Though please consider you're target readers.<br>  Just don't be explicit (in anyway).<br>  Try to put some poetic substance (i.e. metaphor) to it, be 'mild' in describing it so you won't offend your readers.|`|TU7vDI95aa	Definitely include them, just don't be graphic.|`|yZbtteBiaa	It depends on who you intend to target. My suggestion is to leave much of it out because if you go to in depth, it makes your novel seem more of an erotica than a love story. <br>  Keep it completely out if you plan to target readers under the age of 18.
4d8QwNQGaa	. Christopher Columbus, while obviously a genocidal imperialist undeserving of the word great, probably changed history more than anyone else. Though other Europeans, nomadic Asians and maybe even Chinese explorers reached North America before he did, it was his expedition that started the massive exodus of people leaving the old world. This lead to the end of pretty much everything that American history had been prior to his arrival. <br>   The effect he had on trade was enormous. There are places in Russia where sunflowers stretch away as far as the eye can see even though they used to only exist in the new world. Tobacco, peppers, corn, potatoes, and thousands of other plant and animal species spread through out the world  in every direction.<br>     Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein,Napoleon, Hitler, Ceasar, Mao, Martin Luther, Martin Luther King Jr., Joseph Stalin, Abe Lincoln (Though the genius of General Grant and the ruthlessness of General Sherman probably did more to free the slaves) And what about Lee Harvey Oswald,  Sirhan Sirhan and James Earl Ray or whoever  else might really have been behind their atrocities?<br>    All this being said, it may be that the greatest people in history didn't change history at all because the greatest people in history killed them and erased their entire cultures. <br>     Thanks for asking this question because I enjoyed wondering about it.|`|6kts0SaVaa	Hey Go and study Indian history.

Stop eating junk food and snacks, and eat healthy meals - and do it long term.<br>  <br>  Also, as a teen you should not be dieting at all unless it's medically necessary. Your body is still growing. You can do yourself real, permanent harm by denying it the nutrients it needs.

See article below the video in source.<br>  One of America's most famous strippers, and the first to have silicone implants, Carol Doda, used it in San Francisco in 1964 at the Condor Club ( second source) and " go-go girls " in the Peppermint Lounge of New York City were using them in the mid-sixties.|`|d88ef8f1c01d01e57c385835f3395a78aa	Though seeped in legend and myth most of those myths lead you to an Oregon Bar called Mugwumps back in 1968.

bbr2v6Jkaa	Yes go to www.history.com  get it all there every bit of it. Just type in what you want to know and search.<br>  Audio/Visual as well. Look up the internment camps they had for the japanese in WW11.  After WW11 there was a Japanese guy who owned a piece of land in Oahu, Hawaii. He grew water chestnuts, and till 1981 he had that field and it was a historical place for it sat between on of the largest shopping malls in the world and their parking lot! ha ha <br>  He refused to sell his land. But he died and it was sold and made into a parking lot. Today like it or not the Japanese own and run Hawaii.<br>  The Hawaiians hated them for obvious reasons and many men who fought them in the war still hate them today. For at least 50 years we have disliked the Japanese for their trade divisions of finance almost bankrupted our country in the 70's but it turned around on them and it has been 18 years and they still can't make up the money they lost when they made bad investments. So it does not look good for them in the future.|`|iZEPEPcBaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Japanese" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jap...</a> <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mansell.com/pow-index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mansell.com/pow-index.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.historyonthenet.com/WW2/pow_camps_japan.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.historyonthenet.com/WW2/pow_c...</a>|`|djRz1NoYaa	Can't give you links but the idea of comfort women was generally accepted in the japanese military because of the Japanese nationalistic ideals and the notion that every other race was inferior as well as women being lesser than men, thus comfort women were not really regarded as humans but as mere objects of pleasure and indulgence. As far as feelings towards the Japanese after WWII, they were not really accpeted into American or Australian society for a good 20-30 years. This is probably most prevalent in the 'White Australia' policy, where only white people could emmigrate to Australia. They were also forced to sign a treaty that meant they couldn't really have power again. They are in friendly diplomatic relations with most of the world though. hope i could help. And sorry it aint from the web, just a bunch of books i've been reading over the last year or so.

O05HQLohaa	The part of Christine is very demanding. To do it every day would totally exhaust most.  It is not uncommon for the lead parts to be played by two.  <br>  Sometimes one will play the lead for a few months before they start alternating.|`|szFG9r4Maa	I just saw Phantom in NYC on Feb 14.  And only one actor played Christine.  There is an understudy, but she did not perform...|`|cTvP6j7Haa	Most likely one of two reasons.  The one is the understudy of the first, to enable the lead singer to have a day or so off.* And if one of them gets sick or hurt, and can not continue the part the other takes her place.  Number 2.  The one actress can sing but not act, or vice versa. Seen it a lot in school drama's actors can't sing and singers can't act.<br>  A Hell of a predicament.<br>  Peace.<br>  <br>  * and then you buy the wrong program.

8379c575798db3493c5c0194efc05e70aa	If you don't believe in God, obviously then you have no reason to think of any Hell or Heaven after death!! The carrot of Heaven and the stick of Hell were imagined for those who chose to believe in God, so as to keep them aiming to be a good and loving person.|`|A01w1dHqaa	It sound like an unusual thing for a good loving person to aspire to, but I think you will change your mind.|`|EPe2p55Eaa	if there is no god, why so many worshippers around the world? lol....only a evil doggies said no god why?|`|2MfMyh4Maa	If you are a good and loving person, and you admit that there is a possibility that God exists, then why can't you come to the conclusion that your goodness and love are gifts of God?<br>  <br>  You have these wonderful gifts yet you refuse to thank the Giver.  And if you don't think the Giver exists, then why ask a question that presumes He does exist?<br>  <br>  It isn't that you deserve hell.  It's that you want to be apart from God, which you have shown here.|`|ky3B42f6aa	This "god-person" that all these people think is so loving and great is perfectly willing to see millions and millions of "innocent children" die in the most horrible manner -- century after century -- from disease, crime, accident, war, etc.  So, I guess it/she/he is going to love to see you suffer for eternity -- that is what it/she/he apparently enjoys the most.<br>  <br>  But, relax, there ain't no bogeyman.  This is just superstitious nonsense put together to control the weak-minded masses.  And, it works!|`|zZY3JX30aa	One way or another, believer or not, we're all going to find that out!<br>  <br>  <br>  When you die, it will be between you and your "God", so what other people believe about it is entirely moot.|`|368a65d0c864e9d2efce27cfa3ebd33baa	Even if you were the worst SOB ever, He would not be happy about you going to Hell.

Finally you did what was expected didn't you?<br>  <br>  God loves His every creation if it is on the right path of truth, kindness and all good things, He has no Ego and He is<br>  not a barbaric dictator who would punish His own people for not believing in Him. He is the symbol of goodness and if you<br>  believe in goodness then it is equal to believe in Him.|`|cTvP6j7Haa	God does not make you suffer.  The only people that you can blame for your suffering is you and the billions of people on this earth. You suffer from what goes on in your mind, your house, your street, your town, your country and the world at large.  Because you suffer in your mind, where nobody but you has any control over, that is why (you suffer).  Believing in God or not believing in God, changes nothing about what is happening between your ears. <br>  Peace.<br>  <br>  P.S. The question says: "I have already created my own hell".|`|fV2SYj60aa	I've always wondered this.. why would a "loving" God let you suffer for eternity because you didn't believe in something in a world HE created.<br>  <br>  Kind of an asshole move.<br>  <br>  Which is why, if anything, I'd be more likely to believe in a wrathful God.  Way more believable.<br>  <br>  Anyway you probably just go to like, that middle not-hell not-heaven.. **** what was it called..<br>  <br>  ...a ghost?  Lol.

CDVatdYnaa	yes and we ought to return to a simpler age and do away with science ecetera.<br>  <br>  NO no no! sorry, but everythign develops. you cannot return to an era, the style of painting rose out of the society, history, economics. you cannot transplant a painting style into another period of time. our art rises out of ppl and their life experiences, what is important to them, what they feel they need to express, and of course techonological developements.<br>  <br>  confusing and strange maybe threatening for you, but for others it is challenging and exciting. <br>  <br>  i'm not sure about your level of knowledge of art from your expression of opinion. that is not a criticism. my comment would be to go and find a book on picasso and read up on why he felt the need (NEED!) to paint like he did. Why did Monet paint such soft pictures, why did any of the Renaissance artists paint what and how they did. <br>  <br>  You refer to Picasso's paintings as not being beautiful. i think firstly, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, secondly does art have to be beautiful? <br>  <br>  Personal favourite artists are Mondrian, and Blake, Hopper, American realists, Stanley Spencer. Their art (irrespective of beauty of the painting) speaks to me, there is something in those pictures that i look at and feel a connection to or drawn to. <br>  <br>  By suggesting art is getting out of hand you make it sound as if it's an unruly child that needs to be kept in check. i'd argue it's a wild experimental mentor, leading and testing, and keeping us on our toes.<br>  <br>  thanks, i enjoy a bit of discussion about this everyso often. and you're right, all opinions are equally valid.<br>  <br>  :)|`|1NuKii8qaa	It is one of the functions of contemporary art -if function there must be- to confuse and not to be beautiful. It was not different in the passed, every real art movement has kicked around, and the  Renaissance  era was a big shock to -for instance-  god-fearing people coming out of the middle ages where other norms for art existed. <br>  Of course, every new setting has its mainstream -and often irritating- followers, and only time will tell which are the real artists with the most renewing and profound influence. I think we should realize that  what we are now used to and even call classic and not-disturbing to our psychological need of harmony and beauty, was once shocking or disturbing. And if it wasn't, it was not interesting or was quickly aborted.<br>  One more thing. Pretending that anyone van splash paint on canvas, etc, is reducing art to a piece of canvas with splashes on it. Modern art asks more from its witnesses than a simple look.|`|2mWjyFXFaa	originality is number one....feelings and emotion is adopted to do  art work...so let your emotion flow with the art you want to portray......good luck...we have  rights to our own opinion...but we owe this classical artform....it is very  unique. that is why they become known ..God bless you...|`|9GcjDIqNaa	No. Picasso Is overrated like beer|`|ga2gHkJdaa	personally, I didn't care for the Renaissance era paintings. I felt that most often the people were incredibly ugly and I don't find their body shape appealing at all, which makes it difficult since half the paintings and stuff are naked.<br>  <br>  Personally, I enjoy art that is different. Something I've never seen before. I do like abstract though. It can easily add color to a room without being overbearing or making it stuffy like a renaissance painting might. I suppose in the end it all depends on what you like.|`|xByCCGWbaa	I personally agree with you. It is absolutely amazing how famous artist like Leonardo Da Vinci can create an incredible and detailed technique like 'sfumato' (now long lost in time). <br>  <br>  I'm not saying color harmonies in certain modern and pop art paintings is not excellent, but in my opinion, it's far from being art. Art doesn't equal difficulty, but content. A canvas that looks like a palette or something a kid in kinder garden could paint is not content. I have an idea!!! It should be called 'splart' (nice portmanteau huh?). Maybe even "graphic design" oh, wait... is taken.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Pop art is so over .... clearly you have no idea of the various art movements, or you wouldn't be writing this. <br>  <br>  Anything goes in today's art, and while this does have its downside, it also means that anyone can be an artist - but this doesn't mean that anyone is going to be important in an art historical context, nor does it mean that anyone will get rich from it. <br>  <br>  As it happens, Picasso's abstract work was only a small part of his total output, he was gifted in many areas, including simple line drawings. Picasso remains important in the context of art history because he challenged traditional concepts of painting, and went from having the paint medium represent something to having it represent itself, with the subject painted in cubist manner used to indicate the starting point. <br>  <br>  The problem with returning art to the Renaissance era is that the any art can only reflect the society in which it was made. The Renaissance era is long over, but we have the Internet age with associated cheap travel, and a very global society now. Artists during the Renaissance also had to struggle to do what they wanted: many of them used devices such as camera obscuras and camera lucidas to get a realistic rendering of a scene, but due to the religious mindset of the time, had to keep this secret. Also, they needed to learn about anatomy by cutting up corpses, not pleasant at the best of times, but can you imagine what that must have been like during a hot Mediterranean summer? When you look at Renaissance paintings that include babies, think about this: those children were probably dead when they were used as models for the paintings. Infant mortality was much, much higher than it is today, and it would have been easy for artists to find a baby's body they could use. Gruesome to our minds, yes, but these were the conditions in which those artists had to work. Likewise Michelangelo's David: he was quite possibly a local rent-boy, and the chances are he was dead from disease within a few years of this statue being made, but he is immortal. <br>  <br>  Life was very tough during the Renaissance, and oddly art from this time seems to be the opposite. Perhaps art today is such rubbish because our lifestyle is so much better?|`|g8kIjpwSaa	Part of the characteristic of art is that it can, and must evolve over time. And people rarely appreciate innovations in the way art is created until decades or even centuries later.<br>  <br>  Even in the Early Renaissance era, painting John the Baptist without a beard was considered wildly inappropriate. Do we even care now? Nope. In fact, we use ALL Renaissance art as an example of what real art is supposed to be, even though at the time it was created, a lot of now famous Renaissance work were considered in poor taste or even heresy.
Ua5Y9PeDaa	Yes there are family coats of arms and there are also shops that will rip you off by selling a coat of arms that is not yours. <br>  <br>  Coats of arms belong to a specific lineage. They were granted to a person and inherited by his descendants, so all arms, are family coats-of-arms by definition. Do you have a coat of arms in your lineage? Only researching your genealogy can tell, but you can make your own at: <a href="http://www.makeyourcoatofarms.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.makeyourcoatofarms.com/</a>|`|AA12343309	There is no such thing as a family crest.  A crest is part of a coat of arms.  Coats of arms do not belong to surnames.   The biggest myth there is is that everybody or every family has a coat of arms.  <br>  <br>  Peddlers who sell coats of arms(they use the misnomer family crest) on the internet, at shopping malls, in airports, in magazines sell them like they belong to everyone with the same surname and they don't.  They were granted to or assumed by an individual man.  If you were to purchase one of their walnut plaques, tshirts, keychains, coffee mugs and display it like it was yours, you would be guilty of usurping another man's identity. Or if you printed off a picture of one from one of those websites and displayed it like it belong to you, you also would be guilty of usurping another's identity.   Anyone with pride in themselves and in their family would not want to take on another's identity.<br>  <br>  The bad thing about them is a family history comes with them.

Your name does not have a coat of arms. That is not how heraldry works. A coat of arms is something assumed by, or granted to, a unique individual and passed on to his heirs.  There was no "first person with my surname who was assigned a coat of arms."  It is possible that one of your patrilineal ancestor's had a coat of arms, but unlikely.<br>  <br>  The internet sites that offer "surname family crest"  are a scam.  How did the myth of surname arms start? A clever marketer took some heraldry books and made a database of many coats of arms. Instead of recording the actual person who bore the arms, he just associated a surname with each one (often the surname of the original armiger). The point of this scam was to increase the number of people who would identify with a particular design, even though by tradition using an unrelated person's arms is theft. This clever scam has made millions for the con artists and made fools of many people.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a coat of arms in you ancestry, then you can assume a new design.  There are many resources who can help, such as the IAAH. <a href="http://www.amateurheralds.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amateurheralds.org/</a><br>  <br>  (One response to the other posts:  The idea that arms are  passed down unaltered only through first born males is a UK tradition which is not really followed.)|`|rFTPRbRqaa	I don't think so, but looking on the net is not accurate, why? because your ancestors could have had different last names and you could be taking someone else's family crest. <br>  <br>  As for paying for a picture of your family's crest of coat of arms, i really don't know, haven't looked much into it.

If you did, you would already be aware of it, as it is passed down in the family from the person it was granted to.  It is not some fancy design created for a last name and belongs to everyone with that last name.  That is not how it works.<br>  <br>  Coat of Arms were granted to INDIVIDUALS, not assigned to surnames. Just because someone of your last name MAY have been granted one at some point does not make it yours.  Also, it may be that several men of the same surname were granted a coat of arms....each one different.....and maybe none of the men were related to each other.  Likewise, it may be that NO ONE of your surname was ever granted one.  In order for you to be able to claim any Coat of Arms you must be able to do the following:<br>  <br>  1. research your family tree to see if you have any ancestors that were granted a Coat of Arms.<br>  <br>  2. If you do have an ancestor who was granted one, then you can only claim it IF the following is true: The person who rightfully can claim a Coat of Arms that was granted to their ancestor is a male descendant who is the first born son, of the first born son, of the first born son, of the first born son, etc., all the way back to the person who was originally granted the Coat of Arms. If you do not fall in that line, then you cannot claim it.  If you do fall in that line, then chances are you are already aware you have one.<br>  <br>  To use a Coat of Arms based on your last name is meaningless.  It is about as accurate as buying a picture frame at the store that has a piece of paper in it showing an image of a child holding a flower and claiming that is actually a picture of your child.

In present day Australia these groups are further divided into local communities<br>  Although there were over 250-300 spoken languages with 600 dialects at the start of European settlement, fewer than 200 of these remain in use – and all but 20 are considered to be endangered. The population of indigenous Australians at the time of permanent European settlement has been estimated at between 318,000 and 750,000,[ with the distribution being similar to that of the current Australian population, with the majority living in the south-east, centred along the Murray River.<br>   The term "blacks" has often been applied to indigenous Australians. This owes more to superficial physiognomy than ethnology, as it categorises indigenous Australians with the other, unrelated black peoples of Asia and Africa. In the 1970s, many Aboriginal activists, such as Gary Foley proudly embraced the term "black", and writer Kevin Gilbert's ground-breaking book from the time was entitled Living Black.<br>  In recent years young indigenous Australians – particularly in urban areas – have increasingly adopted aspects of Black American and Afro-Caribbean culture, creating what has been described as a form of "black transnationalism." <br>  There are a large number of tribal divisions and language groups in Aboriginal Australia, and, correspondingly, a wide variety of diversity exists within cultural practices. However, there are some similarities between cultures.<br>  <br>  Religious demography among Indigenous Australians is not conclusive because the methodology of the census is not always well-suited to obtaining accurate information on Aboriginal people. The 1996 census reported that almost 72 percent of Aborigines practised some form of Christianity; 16 percent listed no religion. The 2001 census contained no comparable updated data.[There has also been an increase in the number of followers of Islam among the Indigenous Australian community. This growing community includes high-profile members such as the boxer, Anthony Mundine. <br>  .<br>  In traditional Aboriginal belief systems, a creative epoch known as the Dreamtime stretches back into a remote era in history when the creator ancestors known as the First Peoples traveled across the land, creating and naming as they went.[<br>  Indigenous Australia's oral tradition and religious values are based upon reverence for the land and a belief in this Dreamtime. The Dreaming is at once both the ancient time of creation and the present-day reality of Dreaming. There were a great many different groups, each with its own individual culture, belief structure, and language. These cultures overlapped to a greater or lesser extent, and evolved over time. Major ancestral spirits include the Rainbow Serpent, Baiame, and Bunjil.|`|AA10061871	why would the climate be any different

HxXduL1maa	Sir (Hans) Wilhelm Ernst Hans Franz Heysen, OBE (8 October 1877–2 July 1968) was a well-known German Australian artist. He was particularly recognised for his watercolours of the Australian bush. He won the Wynne Prize for landscape painting a record nine times.<br>  <br>  Wilhelm Ernst Hans Franz Heysen was born in Hamburg, Germany. He migrated to Adelaide in South Australia with his family in 1884 at the age of 6. As a young boy Heysen showed an early interest in art. At 14 he left school to work with a hardware merchant, later studying art during nights at Art School in his spare time.<br>  <br>  In 1912 Hans Heysen had earned enough from his art to purchase a property called "The Cedars" near Hahndorf in the Adelaide Hills, which remained as his home until his death in 1968 aged 90.<br>  <br>  The Heysen Trail was named after Sir Hans Heysen.<br>  <br>  His daughter Nora Heysen was also a successful artist.<br>  <br>  Heysen was born in Hahndorf, the fourth child of South Australian landscape painter Sir Hans Heysen. She was raised at The Cedars in Hahndorf in the Adelaide Hills. She studied art from 1926 to 1930, at the School of Fine Arts in Adelaide, under F. Millward Grey and sold paintings to the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Art Gallery of South Australia in 1930. From 1930 to 1933, she continued to study two days a week at the School, and worked in her own studio the rest of the time. In 1931 she visited Sydney with her parents, and spent two weeks studying at the Julian Ashton School.<br>  <br>  Her first solo exhibition was held in Sydney in 1933. In 1934 she travelled to London with her family, remaining in Europe, after they returned home, until 1937 studying and painting. When she returned to Australia she returned briefly to Adelaide and then moved to Sydney.<br>  <br>  In 1938 she entered two portraits in the Archibald Prize. Her portrait of Madame Elink Schuurman was awarded the prize and she became the first woman to win the Archibald. There was a controversy involving criticism of her win by painter Max Meldrum. On October 12, 1943 she became the first women to be appointed as an Australian war artist. "I was commissioned to depict the women’s war effort. There was that restriction on what I did. So I was lent around to all the services, the air force, the navy and the army, to depict the women working at everything they did during the war".  During her service Heysen completed over 170 works of art and was discharged from service in 1946 in New Guinea.<br>  <br>  While in New Guinea Nora met Dr Robert Black, whom she would marry in 1953. Following her discharge from war service she went to London, returning to Sydney in 1948. She continued to paint, exhibit and travel with her husband. In 1993 she was awarded the Australia Council’s Award for Achievement in the Arts and on January 26, 1998 she was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for her service to art.<br>  <br>  Her works are held in the collections of the National Gallery of Australia, the Australian War Memorial, the National Library of Australia, the National Portrait Gallery and several state galleries.<br>  Also visit for paintings:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nla.gov.au/exhibitions/noraheysen/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nla.gov.au/exhibitions/norahe...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/heysen.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au...</a>

It was published in 1996 and won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography.<br>  <br>  McCourt writes his memoir in the present tense from the perspective of a young boy. The memoir often distances Frank, the young boy who simply reports on events without forming opinions, from McCourt, who offers the reader a deeper, more adult perspective on those events. Frank is lively and streetwise, thoughtful and sensitive. Though physically weak and prone to infection, he has emotional strength and a survivor mentality. He is also a highly intelligent, diligent student and a quick thinker.<br>   <br>  As the narrative progresses, Frank strives to reach beyond the limitations forced upon him by poverty. He becomes determined to achieve success in life and to provide for his family and, indeed, he is relieved to leave school at age fourteen in order to get a job. Though he does not explicitly acknowledge it, Frank is burdened by the necessity of acting as a father figure for his family.<br>   <br>  As Frank matures, he starts to suffer from an overwhelming sense of guilt. He worries that by sinning he has doomed himself and the people he loves. Frank channels the disappointments of his difficult life into self-recrimination. Frank escapes his fears and guilt by reading, watching movies, listening to the radio, and daydreaming. He also thinks optimistically about the future, gradually focusing not just on what he wants to do for his family, but on what he wants to achieve for himself. Frank reconciles himself to the fact that in order to reach America, he will have to take risks, pass up safe jobs, and perform ethically dubious tasks such as writing threatening letters for Mrs. Finucane and delivering Protestant newspapers.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Angela%27s_Ashes" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Angela%27s_Ashes</a> : Includes Angela's Ashes summary, character analysis, themes, style, historical context, critical overview, essays, media adaptations, compare and contrast, topics for further study, and sources.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/angelasashes/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/angelasash...</a> : Includes chapter summaries, context, plot overview, character analysis, themes, quotes, key facts, study questions, and suggestions for further reading.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela%27s_Ashes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela%27s_...</a>

AA10729271	I had a dream i was abducted by aliens (who had secretly infiltrated the chinese government) and taken to their strange space ship, where there were several other hundred people. All we did all day was sit around and watch the tv, which made no sense because all they showed were random clips from old tv shows, many not even in english. I suspected that the tv was trying to brainwash us so I tried to avoid it. <br>  <br>  Also, in the middle of this big hall where we were kept there was a pool of purple/lavender liquid crystal, in which there was a statue which I thought looked like Charlize Theron, and upon closer observation I realize that is was her--for real--and that the crystal was slowly absorbing her. I noticed that people avoided the pool, which was odd because it the was the only interesting thing in the place, and then realized why when when Charlize exploded, sending a shower of purple crystal liquid everywhere, some got on my shirt and then people screamed at me not to let is touch my skin because if it did then it would start to eat me and I would end up being the next 'statue' so I managed to get the shirt off, but got some on my hands and so had to hide them because I was afraid of what would happen if they realized i had been 'infected'|`|486086855c284971aec5175eef3a52dbaa	Your ma needs your room to take in lodgers and is dropping subtle hints that you have to move out.

ceBTTCPwaa	Night is a work by Elie Wiesel based on his experience as a young Orthodox Jew of being sent with his family to the German concentration camps at Auschwitz and Buchenwald during the Second World War.<br>  <br>  Theme : Inhumanity Toward Other Humans<br>   <br>  Eliezer's spiritual struggle owes to his shaken faith not only in God but in everything around him. After experiencing such cruelty, Eliezer can no longer make sense of his world. His disillusionment results from his painful experience with Nazi persecution, but also from the cruelty he sees fellow prisoners inflict on each other. Eliezer also becomes aware of the cruelty of which he himself is capable. Everything he experiences in the war shows him how horribly people can treat one another—a revelation that troubles him deeply.<br>   <br>  The first insensible cruelty Eliezer experiences is that of the Nazis. Yet, when the Nazis first appear, they do not seem monstrous in any way. Eliezer recounts, “[O]ur first impressions of the Germans were most reassuring. . . . Their attitude toward their hosts was distant, but polite.” So many aspects of the Holocaust are incomprehensible, but perhaps the most difficult to understand is how human beings could so callously slaughter millions of innocent victims. Wiesel highlights this incomprehensible tragedy by pulling the Nazis into focus first as human beings, and then, as the memoir shifts to the concentration camps, showing the brutal atrocities that they committed.<br>   <br>  Furthermore, Night demonstrates that cruelty breeds cruelty. Instead of comforting each other in times of difficulty, the prisoners respond to their circumstances by turning against one another. Near the end of the work, a Kapo says to Eliezer, “Here, every man has to fight for himself and not think of anyone else. . . . Here, there are no fathers, no brothers, no friends. Everyone lives and dies for himself alone.” It is significant that a Kapo makes this remark to the narrator, because Kapos were themselves prisoners placed in charge of other prisoners. They enjoyed a relatively better (though still horrendous) quality of life in the camp, but they aided the Nazi mission and often behaved cruelly toward prisoners in their charge. At the beginning of the fifth section, Eliezer refers to them as “functionaries of death.” The Kapos' position symbolizes the way the Holocaust's cruelty bred cruelty in its victims, turning people against each other, as self-preservation became the highest virtue.<br>   <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_(book..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_(book...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/night/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/night/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/N..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/N...</a>|`|DvToP5h7aa	Night - Elie Wiesel<br>  <br>  <br>  Night - Faith<br>  <br>  Night is a dramatic book that tells the horror and evil of the concentration camps that many were imprisoned in during World War II.

6UFfW4l6aa	Guitar-wise, for metal you want jackson, dean, ibanez, and esp. Amp-wise, your looking at line-6 spider on the insane setting and then you want a line6 uber metal pedal. Check them out. :-)|`|hJP9y6kjaa	I could write quite a bit about how to get a heavy tone, but I think I can boil it down to a few guidelines.<br>  <br>  1) a guitar that is comfortable to play, is properly set up, intonated, action low but not *too* low, etc. If you can't play your guitar, then none of the rest of it matters much, right? Well maintained, new(ish) strings, etc.<br>  <br>  2) The advice on the high-gain amp was right on the money. If your amp can't deliver, then you won't get a good tone - period. Your amp and speakers are the foundation for your tone, and are where you should spend the majority of your time and money getting the best you can. Good brands are Marshall, Mesa Boogie, Peavey, Crate, Randall, etc.<br>  <br>  If you have a good high-gain amp, you shouldn't need a distortion pedal. I wouldn't suggest more than 50 watts of amp - more watts means more volume, but also the louder you have to crank it to get that "cranked" sound. 50 watts is loud enough to gig and practice with a full band, but you don't have to turn it up as loud to get that cranked tone.<br>  <br>  <br>  3) You need good speakers. My rule of thumb is to look for speakers rated for at least 50 watts, with plenty of bass response. More speakers = better, in general, so a 12" speaker is better than a 10", 2 12's are better than 1, etc. More speakers = more treble and bass = pushing more air = you can hear yourself better. I prefer higher watt speakers because I don't like a lot of breakup when I play - breakup can reduce bass response, and I want a clean solid low end.<br>  <br>  4) High-output pickups. Again, a topic I could go on for hours about. You want pickups that balance out the tone of your guitar (bright guitars need darker pickups, and vice versa). A rule of thumb is that for passive pickups, a higher DC Resistance will usually correlate to higher output.<br>  <br>  I prefer a high output bridge pickup and low output neck pickup - it has to do with sustain, and it helps balance volumes between the two. My current fav passive pickups are Seymour Duncan - an Alnico II Pro in the neck, and an Alternative 8 in the bridge. Great cleans, coil-taps well, great chunky distorted rhythms, lots of picking dynamics, and the A2P has a very "Slash" lead tone to it. Me likey!<br>  <br>  My fav pickups for rock/metal are Dragonfire Actives (link below). They're not very detailed as far as tone goes, but the relative lack of complication means they distort superbly. Great for metal rhythms.<br>  <br>  5) EQ. I cannot overstate how important EQ is, especially with high-gain. EQ -> distortion -> EQ should be the building block of your tone - tweaking before and after your distortion (whether amp or pedal) will give you tons of control over how it sounds - the difference between a lot of high-gain pedals and amps comes down to differences in the tone stacks, ie, how they're EQ'd!  Investing in an EQ pedal, or better yet a rackmount EQ effect, is a good way to hone in on that perfect tone without going from pedal to pedal, amp to amp, pickup to pickup, etc etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  Right now I'm running an LTD EC-50 loaded with the Dragonfire Active pickups into a Boss Metalcore into a Boss GT-3 set up as a low-gain preamp/speaker simulator with EQ and volume control into a Crate Powerblock (basically a 75-w power amp) into a Tubeworks 2x12 cab. Sometimes I'll use an Epiphone Valve Jr instead of the Powerblock, you can't beat the sound of tubes after all... and yeah, it's just as loud.... god I love tubes...<br>  <br>  I am loud enough to hang with my buddy and his Marshall MG 4x12 (and don't scoff, he actually gets a killer tone out of it), and gig/play with a full band, so I have no worries.<br>  <br>  Although I generally don't like pedal distortion, I *do* like the Boss Metal Zone for 80's scooped metal stuff, and the Metalcore for more modern "recto" style chunk. Both would work well for what you're going for, especially if you can't afford a nice high-gain tube amp (which are bloody expensive).<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|06nDkqBlaa	For metal you should DEFINITELY get an amp with "high gain", remember those 2 words when looking for an amp and you should find something that suits you, look for a an amp that has a closed back, it will give you meatier tones. Dont get a Fender amp, Fender makes orgasmically clean sounding amps and are fantastic, but not what youre looking for. <br>  As for a good metal guitar, the key is in the pickups, DO NOT buy a guitar with single coil pickups, look for these keywords "hot pickups" and "humbuckers". Jumbo frets can be fun (your fingers wont touch the fingerboard as much) and are pretty common on metal styled guitars.<br>  Electro-harmonix Metal Muff is one of the best metal distortion pedals out there, ask anyone. its about $80.

Sound like Obama?|`|7kUyIGQhaa	1. Nazi message- the nationalist/traditional message appealed to conservatives, while the contempt for democracy and discredited institutions such as church and aristocracy appealed to the more rebellious.  The message was simple and easily conveyed with images and words, disguising the lack of substance.  The constant refrain that Germany had been laid low by enemies from outside and inside (communists, democrats) allowed Hitler to set himself and the Nazis up as the only strong defenders.  This political method- create the impression of powerful enemies and a pressing emergency, then set up the party/leader as the only possible protector- is very powerful and has been used by political leaders everywhere (such as Robert Mugabe, George Bush, Winston Churchill).<br>  <br>  2. Hitler- Hitler WAS the party so it's hard to separate 'Nazism' from 'Hitler', because the party embodied his own personal philosophies.  His life was seen as the very epitome of what Nazis stood for: a brave, simple, modest man fighting for Germany itself.<br>  <br>  3. Strategy- partly Hitler's own insightfulness about how crowds behave and what messages appealed, and partly the similar genius of Goebbels for propaganda an an emerging mass media age. The 1936 Olympics are the model for every modern Olympics- just look at how the Chinese used the torch relay recently.  Hitler also had a brilliant sense of when to compromise- after the 1933 elections he did a deal with industrialists- previously suspicious enemies- to secure the extra votes for his majority.  The SA was part of this, allowing Hitler to take on the other extreme parties, while looking like he stood for 'order'.  His destruction of the SA showed he knowed when to change tack.<br>  <br>  4. Overall context- extremist parties were hugely popular in times of great trouble, when only an extreme party has the will needed to sweep away the rotten old ruling classes.  We will see this ourselves in coming months: established politicians will never overthrow the idiot company leaders who created the financial crisis, and the people might turn to radicals because only they are not controlled by existing powerful interests.<br>  <br>  Really it is impossible to separate historical events like this- everything interconnects and links up, but it's a convenient way to break history down so it can be taught a bit at a time.

Nor does higher education, for that matter.<br>  <br>  The ways that you get Equity cards are performing in regional theatre which gives Equity credit or professional theatre which does the same. You can also work in a theatre with Equity credibility and earn points. You need a certain amount of points to get your card. This is the easiest way to get your Equity card and the way in which you have the best shot.<br>  <br>  Another way is to audition for an Equity show and be offered an Equity role. The director will buy you into Actors' Equity.|`|ky3B42f6aa	You get a card because you deserve one due to youracting experience etc.  So do not let some "fancy" agent con you.

Love Sauron"|`|ceBTTCPwaa	The One Ring is an artifact that appears as the pivotal plot element in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth fantasy fiction. It is described in an earlier story, The Hobbit (1937), as a magic ring of invisibility. The sequel The Lord of the Rings (1954–55) reveals that its powers are much more encompassing than mere invisibility, and concerns the quest to destroy the Ring, revealed to be malevolent — being created by the primary antagonist, Sauron.<br>  <br>  Picture of ring : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:OneTrueRing.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:OneTru...</a><br>  <br>  The ring-inscription is in Black Speech, the fictional language of Mordor, and is written in the artificial script of Tengwar. The inscription symbolizes the One Ring's power to control the other Rings of Power.<br>  <br>  Normally the One Ring appears perfectly plain and featureless, but when cast into fire the inscription appears in fiery letters on the inner and outer surface of the Ring. A drawing of the Inscription appears in Book I, Chapter 2 of The Fellowship of the Ring, "The Shadow of the Past". A transliteration appears in Book II, Chapter 2, "The Council of Elrond", where the inscription is read by Gandalf.<br>  <br>  Roughly translated, the words mean:<br>  <br>  One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.<br>  <br>  When the Ring was first forged, Sauron spoke these words aloud, and Celebrimbor, maker of the Three Rings of the Elves, heard him from afar and was aware of his now-revealed purposes.<br>  <br>  The inscription uses Elvish lettering because all forms of writing Tolkien describes at that time were invented by the Elves.<br>  <br>  Some recent editions of The Fellowship of the Ring accidentally omit the first two clauses of this phrase from Chapter 2, an error which was corrected by the time of the 50th Anniversary editions. An extended verse introduced three of the races inhabiting Middle-earth, as well as the eponymous title character, the Lord of the Rings:<br>  <br>  Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,<br>  Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,<br>  Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,<br>  One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne<br>  In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.<br>  One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,<br>  One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them<br>  In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.<br>  <br>  Gandalf first learned of the Ring-inscription when he read the account that Isildur had written before marching north to his death and the loss of the Ring. When Isildur had cut the Ring from Sauron's hand, it was burning hot, and so Isildur was able to transcribe the inscription before it faded. When Gandalf subsequently heated the ring that Bilbo Baggins had found and passed on to Frodo the inscription appeared, and the wizard then had no doubt that it was the One Ring.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_Ring" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_Rin...</a>

0OJ43kpsaa	Please let me know how much Subject credit I earn for you at school.<br>  <br>  Also, try readi Wiki, as it has some excellent summaries.<br>  <br>  When this story was written, early in the C18, France was still ruled by a king. The Revolution and the guillotine were some 60+ years away. Life was crushingly hard, and everyone was heavily taxed.<br>  <br>  There were no mcadamised roads, just dirt tracks filled with wheel ruts. James Watt was not yet born. There were no trains or cars, just horses, carts and coaches.<br>  <br>  Life expectancy was low. Public health was an unknown concept. Cities were death traps, especially in slum areas which followed no building code (not surprising, because these hadn't been invented) and had poor or no sanitation.<br>  <br>  The last major outbreak of bubonic plague had occured in London, followed by the Great Fire, about 60 years beforehand.<br>  <br>  Life was so hard and mean that most citizens chose to spend much of their lives drunk. Alcohol was the C18 equivalent of crack cocaine.<br>  <br>  There were no McDonalds or Burger King, no shakes, no fries no coke. Bread was a staple food, if you could get it. In 60 years, the French Queen would lose her head after suggesting her starving people should "eat cake" (brioche, actually) if they couldn't get bread. It was a media beat-up, even way back then, but it gained notoriety in the retelling. people ate whatever they could get their hands on, even rats.<br>  <br>  Around this time, but in England, there were some nasty incidents regarding bread. All the best people ate WHITE bread. Check out Billy Joel's recent cover of "Uptown Girl" (living in her white bread world). Only poor people ate grain or bran bread. So, to meet the demand, some enterprising British "bakers" used bleach to turn brown bread white and sell it for more money. They also POISONED all their customers!<br>  <br>  Sometimes, however, Governments got it right. The Brits would insist, in another century or so, in forcing bakers to add IODINE to the bread. One surpising result was that thousands of people were released from mental asylums because their only problem was an iodine deficiency. But I digress.<br>  <br>  Back to France.<br>  <br>  Backward, smelly, poor and unhappy. Toilet paper was not yet invented. In fact, even today, esp in French camp grounds, a toilet is a hole in the ground with two places to plant your feet and squat. The only difference between such a toilet and a shower is the height at which the water arrives.<br>  <br>  The lower east side of New York is a paradise compared to France in the C18.<br>  <br>  And in 60 years the citizens (citoyens) will rip up the cobblestones to use as missiles, barricade the narrow streets and turn Paris into a revolutionary fortress until Napoleon rises to the top and threatens to conquer Europe.<br>  <br>  Does that give you a picture?
AA11779954	Here's a timeline:<br>  <br>  1452<br>  <br>  On 15th April, Saturday, around 10.30pm ("at three o’clock in the night" in Renaissance time), Leonardo is born in Vinci out of wedlock to Caterina, a farmer’s daughter, and Ser Piero da Vinci, a notary (1427-1504). Recorded by Leonardo’s paternal grandfather, Antonio di Ser Piero da Vinci.<br>  <br>  1457<br>  <br>  The 5-year old Leonardo is listed as a dependent in the tax assessment declaration of his grandfather, Antonio. <br>  <br>  1462<br>  <br>  Leonardo’s father is employed in Florence as a notary by Cosimo de’ Medici, il Vecchio, “the Old”. <br>  <br>  1469<br>  <br>  Following the death of his grandfather, Leonardo probably moves to his father’s household in Florence, where Ser Piero is working as a notary at the Palagio del Podestà (the seat of the chief law officer, today the Palazzo del Bargello).<br>  <br>  <br>  Now for some more detailed biographical information:<br>  <br>  Leonardo recorded his earliest childhood memory in his notebooks. Explaining his obsession with devising a machine for flying, he explains that as a baby, a kite (a kind of hawk with long tail-feathers), landed on him and stuck its tail feathers into his mouth, repeatedly hitting his lips with its feathers. This experience was certainly traumatic, and historians believe that it would indeed have influenced the boy to gain interest in flight. <br>  What historians do not know is in whose cradle the baby Leonardo was resting when the bird landed on him. Was he in the custody of his mother, or his father? An illegitimate child, he was born on April 15, 1452, in the town of Vinci. His father, Ser Piero, an up-and-coming notary, definitely took Leonardo into his home when the child was three; before then, he may well have been living with his mother, Caterina, so that she might breast-feed the baby: it is unlikely that Ser Piero could have afforded a wet nurse. <br>   <br>  At any rate, Leonardo probably spent most of his time as a child with neither parent, but with his paternal uncle Francesco, who would later remember Leonardo in his will. Ser Piero was busy in the nearby city of Florence, and Caterina had married a man named Accattabriga. Francesco worked as a farmer, and Leonardo probably spent a great deal of his childhood out of doors, observing nature and possibly sketching it.<br>   <br>  Commentary<br>   <br>  Leonardo's status as an illegitimate child certainly affected his personal development. Although the upper classes of the quatrocento usually ignored illegitimacy, allowing bastard sons to inherit their fathers' property and power, the middle classes were quite particular. As a notary, Leonardo's father Ser Piero was positioned quite solidly within the developing middle classes, which were full of clubs, guilds, and unions that carefully regulated the opportunities of a boy like Leonardo. As a bastard, he would never be able to attend a university or even become a notary like his father. Also, Leonardo no doubt felt neglected by his parents. Not only was he illegitimate, but his mother was soon distracted by her legitimate children, and Ser Piero probably spent most of his time away from Leonardo, in Florence. <br>   <br>  Thus lacking anyone in whose footsteps he was expected to follow, Leonardo could develop freely into the universal man he would become. He spent his days with his uncle Francesco, tending to animals and exploring farmland, observing the nature and landscapes that he would later sketch and study. Because he was not expected to become a notary, he was free to pursue drawing. Also, although as a notary Ser Perio probably ensured that the boy had a proper "elementary" education, Leonardo had to learn many things for himself, thus initiating what would become his habitual autodidacticism; he would later teach himself Latin, physics, and human anatomy. <br>  His mirror writing was probably a childhood trait that was never rectifies during his education.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little.
ceBTTCPwaa	Yes, because of the plane that flies in the book.<br>  <br>  Fly Away Peter is a 1982 novel by Australian author David Malouf. <br>  <br>  Fly Away Peter has an unusual structure. The first half, the sanctuary of Queensland, represents paradise, or the garden of Eden. Jim understands the birds, and keeps records of them in "The Book". By naming them he is symbolically creating them, an idea which is evocatively described in an early chapter. In this way, Jim acts almost as an Adam figure. If this were the case, Imogen, who shares his love of nature, represents Eve, and the wealthy landowner Ashley would represent God. Ashley deserves this as it is he who decides to make his land into a sanctuary, and invites Jim to "be his man". The snake would have to be Jim's father, a twisted bitter man.<br>  <br>  Into the tranquil paradise comes modernity in terms of a "clumsy" biplane. The birds and the plane are contrasted to highlight the beauty of nature.<br>  <br>  Jim and Ashley are drawn to the war, in a section which represents hell. Jim survives whilst all around die. His beloved birds are replaced by rats, and he despairs. He reaches his nadir in the bottom of a bomb crater, and almost loses his mind. He gradually recovers by returning to his birds. By this time he has seen his friends "blasted out of existence", reduced to mental wrecks and losing limbs.<br>  <br>  Jim eventually has an epiphany, and determines that "life isn't for anything. It simply is." Whilst this may seem depressing, it makes sense to Jim, and in a charge towards the enemy, Jim is shot down.<br>  <br>  From this point, the story takes on a dream-like quality, and although Jim does die, it is never clear at exactly what point he does die. Regardless, his spirit endures, and he finds himself literally returning to nature, digging in the soil alongside his fallen mates. He realizes he has all the time in the world, and is overjoyed.<br>  <br>  In the final chapter, Imogen morns the death of Jim, and the senseless waste of human life. She seems ready to give up when she sees a surfer - something completely new to her. Symbolically, the surfer falls, and his board rises behind him, like a tombstone. Miraculously, he rises, and stands upon his board again and again. In this way, Imogen realizes, life must continue. She continues to mourn Jim, but also sees a future without him.<br>  <br>  The entire novel consists of dualities...war and peace, paradise and hell, birds and rats, life and death, nature and man-made, etc. Despite the impressive exploits of man, they are shown to be negative (like the war) or ugly (like the biplane) in contrast to the beauty of nature. In one scene where a mammoth is uncovered, together with the spears that killed it, we are reminded that the entire history of mankind is one of violence.<br>  <br>  One idea which is explored throughout the novel is that of "mapping". Jim thinks that the birds must map out the landscape and keep a picture of it in their minds, to help them in their migrations. When he goes up in the biplane, he appreciates this fact. During his epiphany he has an out-of-body experience, and can see himself as part of the landscape, with his life mapped out.<br>  <br>  Malouf was regarded as a poet before he wrote novels, and much of his writing in this novel is poetic. Malouf himself describes it as a novel which explores ideas (such as the meaning or purpose of life) rather than story.

However, my guess is that something like that would be 'closed' auditions: that is, without an agent you simply wouldn't get in. And without experience or training, you won't get an agent. You can't just randomly send your headshot to a director, it doesn't work that way.|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	Narnia<br>  c/o Aslan the Lion<br>  321 Lamppost Lane<br>  Wardrobe, Spare Oom 54321|`|cqDsR7gqaa	Exactly what the person above me said.  What you can do tho is contact your local extras casting agencies (sometimes called background casting agencies).  They might be able to get you an extras job.  Its pretty much just a lot of waiting around.  Then you stand around in the background.  But you would be on set and it is interesting to watch the actors work.<br>  <br>  Tho it is important to keep in mind that if you aren't a SAG extra then you might not even be cast then.  Films have to cast a certain amount of SAG extras and only then do they use the local castings.<br>  <br>  That's about the only shot you have at getting in the Chronicles of Narnia.  Sorry.

Interest rates equal to 1% below/above prime.*  Are all valid terms of a contract.  The moment it is 'safety critical', it is more a criminal offense than a common law offense.<br>  Peace.<br>  <br>  * Do you really think that the bank's lawyers would let a major flaw, like that, into their loan contracts?|`|03k5qduQaa	Laws are structured to implement a moral code of conduct within a stratum, and if found to be wanting or exposed to exploitation, deconstructed and rewritten as conclusively as possible. The reasoning pertaining to the creation of laws are to protect the interests of a group from abuse of another usually powerful group. It takes into account and creates clauses for exceptions to the general rule if worded appropriately. Although the laws may be legally challenged and altered, it is generally considered a crime for individuals to exercise personal bias directly infringing upon anothers liberty, rights or general enjoyment of living.<br>  <br>  The banks offer tiered interest terms depending upon the economic climate. If interest rates are low clients are able to take advantage and contract a stipulated period of fixed term interest guarding themselves against any increases warranting greater interest demands. Alternatively high interest rates being detrimental to the seekers of loans are advantageous to the saver who gains a higher income and return for his invested capital.<br>  <br>  Certainty of terms does not always prove beneficial to the astute and speculative investor or business person. Variable interest rates ensure his money is not attached to a low rate of interest should rates increase, or a high interest rate should fluctuations decrease the rates and payments accordingly.<br>  <br>  Uncertainty is the nature of high return business. Capped or fixed rates and term are favourable to corporations or individuals seeking to determine monthly outgoings for a given period. Banks are a business and are entrusted by their shareholders and investors to gain maximum return in profits in a fiercely competitive market. <br>  <br>  State ownership vaguely promises to control the volatility and power the banks wield but is as with all such vacuous and indefinable gestures as exposed to corruption or mismanagement as the present system, more so as politicians tend to be short term contracted employees and have no bode with long term treasury fortunes other than their immediate popularity in the form of tax cuts and increased expenditure to curry favour with their voters and paymasters …<br>  <br>  To answer your question - yes the involvment of less than scrupulous individuals caused the discreditation and subsequent collapse of the banking institution. Orchestrated and engineered by a small group of ''common {law} criminals'' to destroy and usurp their former formidable power ....<br>  <br>  The individuals concerned become common law criminals only if prosecuted and found guilty as charged. Until any misappropriation is evidenced they remain innocent until proven guilty. Common law criminals are by nature business persons found wanting in matters of jurisprudence, criminalised mainly for being lacking in the wit and guile to efface any such allegations of irregularity and misconduct.

kzdF7KkOaa	Well, in a 2D image. If the portrait is of someone looking straight out of the image, then where ever your standing {if you can see the picture} the eyes appear to be looking straight at you. <br>  <br>  In a 3D image the face appears to turn away as you walk round it, so you will look at a profile or full face depending on position.  The picture will always be full face, but the face will alter in width as you walk to the side.|`|MNPWJPWhaa	It's like this because in a two dimensional painting, the figure is flat and is looking straight ahead. When you change the perspective you are in, the picture narrows and the eyes are also narrowed. The eyes would look at you no matter which position you are in. A three dimensional figure is three dimensional, so when you change your perspective, the eyes don't look at you (excluding the front). try experimenting by drawing a picture of a person and stick it on a wall. Change your perspective frequently and observe what happens. Try getting a family or friend to try the three dimensional experiment. Make sure the person looks straight ahead.

cgz85foTaa	I liked it a lot too.  It was an easier read than 1984 (even though I like that book too).  I loved it a lot more than 1984 because it dealt with burning books which is horrible to me.  Montag is a better character then Winston and Fahrenheit 451's ending actually had hope for the future.<br>  <br>  similar books:<br>  The Giver<br>  1984<br>  A Brave New World<br>  The Handmaid's Tale <br>  Anthem<br>  Atlas Shrugged <br>  The Children of Men|`|ygGr1nX7aa	It is an awesome work, and I'm glad to hear you enjoyed it and understood Bradbury's message.<br>  <br>  When I was in school, I got top marks on an essay comparing F451 to Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell.  It's another book that gives a frightening view of a possible future (well, 1984 was the future when Orwell wrote it), and there are some interesting parallels between the characters.  It's a classic and well worth picking up.|`|AA11199739	It's wonderful when a book has such a profound effect on a person.<br>  <br>  I haven't read this novel, but I almost feel inspired to read it because you love it so much and enthusiasm is catching.<br>  <br>  If you want similar books, just google greatest science fiction novels or perhaps also google greatest fantasy novels as well.<br>  <br>  You can also read other novels by the author that you love (Bradbury).<br>  <br>  Happy reading!|`|vAdtlZDpaa	I never actually read the book but I loved the movie.

1TPGdaXJaa	In Buddhist philosophy, love and compassion are at the core of becoming unselfish; essentially removing yourself from the "selfish" point of view in life.<br>  <br>  One of the meditations involves thinking about someone who you care for and love, and meditating on all of the emotions that you feel when you think about them. Then you can think about a good friend, and the emotions you would feel if you suddenly ran into them. Then, the question is raised why can you not feel this way for all living beings? <br>  <br>  So I do not think love is selfish. The only way I can maybe see what you are saying is if one person loves another (romantically speaking), and wants them all for themself. But in that sense, I don't think that is pure love - I think there is a lot of jealousy mixed in that type of situation, and it is the jealousy that brings about the selfishness.|`|OqlXBUsaaa	love may be related with its negative forms like selfishness,,,<br>  love seems to be selfish, when it does not consider the others' feelings or when one acts to be stingy in sharing his beloved,,,<br>  <br>  but upon closer look, it is done out of love,,, that would mean that selfishness is not present with that act, since the act of being stingy(not generous enough) is to possess the object of love, fearing it might get loose or lost, but yet done out of love,,,<br>  whereas true love goes further by eventually permitting to let go of its object of love, selfishness does not but wants to possess the object alone.... <br>  and love embraces all things including pain, wishing the goodness and well-being of the beloved as well as the lover..|`|C8u2jBu7aa	Not quite. It is a paradox. It is the highest form of both Selfishness AND Selflessness.|`|B1GjfOUdaa	True love is not selfish.  If there is selfishness in a relationship there is no love.|`|i2ZAVM2aaa	To me Love is the Purest Form of Fulfilment|`|ghMJyzsOaa	While we are bound by these earthly bodies we will always be creatures who operate from a selfish point of view. It is a natural aspect of our living nature. Both enter a relationship for affection, procreation, security, and both always endeavour to strengthen their version of love. If there was nothing to be gained from being in love, I'm sure it would not have the collective point of interest and appeal it has surrounding the idea of being in love. Both, even if they are unaware, are in a relationship for themselves, and for each other. We act and live in a way that projects selflessness, when in love, but if we trace its trail back to source, we  quickly learn that our feelings evolved from our self point of interest. Love is power. <br>  <br>  Moreover, we work together to keep that power energised, it maintains happiness, joy, and correct treatment of the other vice versa, when love fades, and this energy is lost. The life of the relationship can dissolve, without love or the prospect of love in anything, nothing can be gained on an individual level or mutually with a partner. Love is energy, that makes us feel good and we all want it so much. It can cause two people to sacrifice themselves in extraordinary ways, but it is only the power of love that makes them so committed to what seems like a selfless act. Because they both want to maintain these self euphoric feelings of "love freedom power" And they need each other to accomplish it.   <br>  <br>  Love grows from our selfish point of view, there Is no other place for it to come through, but once it does grow in power we understand what actions are required for it to continue existing in our realm of thinking and feeling. When one is faced with the prospect of losing the one they love, It can be devastating, or when one fears losing the one they love. These two points of focus will always self-preserve, both, will, from their self point of view, do absolutely everything they can in their power to preserve their love for one another. When one loves most are accompanied with the fear of loss of that love. Our Selfish point of view. Bless You!|`|adLSRFrZaa	If we look at the behaviors we normally classify as selfish, usually there is a rational motive involved.  We steal something because we want it.  We decide to steal something, and there is a rational component to our behavior.  <br>  <br>  Love, on the other hand, can lack this rational component.  Mother Nature casts a spell on us when we are in Love.  Love has an irrational component.  When we are in Love, we cannot rationally decide to stop loving that person at that moment.  We may be selfish in Love, but there is a distinction to be made between Love and other selfish behaviors like stealing.|`|cTvP6j7Haa	Yes, and the same side of the same coin makes it also selflessness.  It is one of those ethereal emotions, that everyone experiences and nobody can discuss or put into words.  If you have lived it, you know what it is, but you could not tell your lover (recipient of such love) about it, without getting lost in a muddle of words.<br>  Peace.|`|oGVvEl3Maa	no. not at all.  <br>  <br>  i believe that you are confusing lust with love...<br>  and i do not believe that there is any 'pure' form of selfishness...<br>  "love is patient and kind... it is not boastful or rude... it does not insist on its own way..."  1 Cor 13<br>  <br>  i believe that selfishness is dust on the lamp of the heart.<br>  perhaps that is your ego lying to you...?<br>  <br>  My thoughts!|`|cMLBBNGcaa	No. Love is an involuntary emotion.

mlAwNRWhaa	satisfaction and acquiring things beyond your satisfactory level...|`|621a4d17d13b63e02ffc57e463e95ed2aa	Q:  What makes happiness? <br>  A: Lots of things can create happiness, both concrete (something real that your senses allow you to see, touch, hear, taste, smell, etc..) and abstract (something in your mind or heart that allows you to know or feel something). Basic happiness, comes with the basic necessities of life: food, clothing, shelter, leading to health. Wealth and wisdom can also lead to happiness.<br>  <br>  But what, ultimately is happiness? Isn't happiness just an answer to alleviate sorrow? Isn't happiness simply that which overcomes despair, whatever that may be? Sometimes, it seems it doesn't take much of anything to make a person happy, just something, anything, to provide a sense of well being, safety, confidence and the like...|`|04bSzgxgaa	It is true happiness comes from within and on the whole we use outside stimulus to trigger the emotions and chemicals that make us experience feelings of happiness.

ecF1pHzXaa	According to history, USA joined to support Cuba defending them form Spain. While Spain send the boat called Vizcaya to NY, USA send to Cuba "Maine". It wasn't clear what happened to the Maine boat but I said that it blew up inside the boat, but that theory wasn't convinced by the Americans; they thought Spain did it and so it starts the Spanish-American War. At the end in 1898 USA and Spain signed a Peace treaty (Treaty of Paris) agreed to USA to have as their colony Guam, Puerto Rico and the Philippines.<br>  <br>  Is not consider a violation per se. But is a decision of them to accept their independence just like USA had theirs when the British governed their colonies.|`|550e4912823fee98e745442e7bdab33faa	Spain ceded these territories to the US as part of the treaty ending the Spanish-American War.

swiOhDo2aa	This is like beauty - it's in the eye of the beholder. Some annexations are justified on ethnic or cultural grounds (the people of the Sudetenland are all German really, so...), some on the ground that an area has already been annexed by a foreign power and so may be taken back - "It was the law of conquest; force with force is well ejected, when the conquered can." All annexations of whatever sort will, however, naturally be resented by the annexee. A few examples:<br>  <br>  The Palestinians and their supporters regard the annexation of Israel as the right, moral and just thing to do. Similarly, until recently there were many Irish republicans who deplored the past British annexation of Ireland, but themselves wanted to annex Ulster. In the 2WW, Germany and the USSR jointly annexed and partitioned Poland - in the rest of the world, only the Nazis and Communists applauded the fact; the rest, largely, were horrified.<br>  <br>  Some annexations are so far in the past that they are no longer controversial. Since the Reconquista (a war lasting centuries, down to Fernando & Isabel) when Christian Spain annexed the Moorish provinces, no N. African or Islamic state has tried to retake the territory. There is, despite Plaid Cymru, not much appetite in Wales to reverse the annexation by England; on the other hand, ETA in the Basque provinces in Spain are still, vainly, refighting the same sort of centuries-old war for their independence.<br>  <br>  So, no simple answer. Sorry.|`|550e4912823fee98e745442e7bdab33faa	Not always.<br>  <br>  Some people do not want to be part of a city under any circumstances.|`|0OJ43kpsaa	Dud question. Is annexation a LEFT thing to do? Is annexation GOOD? (Hmmm, from whose point of view, the annexor or the annexee??).<br>  <br>  Annexation of a group of people who WANT to join the annexor is scarcely worth mentioning, because both groups are virtually of the same mind.<br>  <br>  The Sudetenland is an interesting example, because I don't believe there is a mass of undoctored evidence to say that Sudetenland Germans were anxious to reunite with Nazi germany. The Czechs certainly did not want it, because they had built their frontier defences in that region.<br>  <br>  The Ukraine initially greeted the Germans as liberators from the oppression of wartime communism. Germany could have gained a large ally and a major food centre. However, germany and the Ukraine were not "of the same mind" because the Nazis classed Ukrainians as untermensch -- subhumans.<br>  <br>  Annexing a population with a differing mindset to your own is a recipe for insoluble, longterm trouble -- e.g. the Middle East.<br>  <br>  You cannot solve issues by drawing a line through them, e.g. Korea, Vietnam.|`|KHhbO3rxaa	Annexation can mean many different things; you don't explain yourself well.|`|DGgAtm0kaa	Depends on what you are annexing!

However, we all have to die everntally for lots of reasons, one being that our bodies get old and tired out with the years. Plus, if no one ever died, the world would be very over populated.

To make space for a more Intelligent and knowledgeable next generation.  My mother could not set the preprogrammed dials on her CD player.  Was a job, my brother-in-law had to do.  She could only switch on or off and press play.  And that is why she passed on, to be returned as a new baby, into the then living conditions, without being called old hat.  Like her mother before her was scared of electrical power - that was from the devil.  (and she was an atheist)  Btw.

Death is not cruel and scary. It's a blessing to die, to be non-existent. Why is it terrifying not to feel when you won't be aware of not feeling? Why fear what you can't know? Perhaps the greatest gift bestowed on humanity is consciousness, but why is consciousness wonderful or worth so much?

By that I mean, you didn't exist as you know it before you were born, you existed perhaps, but in a different way. Perhaps it is time you come to peace with the growth of existence, with death come rebirth and visa versa. <br>  <br>  When I used to ask this question, I always ended up saying, 'well wherever I was before I probably was happier than I am now,' I can't imagine being in this existence forever, its to laborious and painful. I don't think that where you go is a place of darkness.<br>  <br>   I think here is the place of hell, now is the time to do all of your growing so that when you get to the other side that is probably a bit like  here, you can continue growing over there with no obligation to come back.<br>  <br>   I know many people detest Syliva Brown but she helped me find inner peace, maybe you could try reading that or other spiritual books, don't just take my advice, this is how I reasoned and dealt with it. <br>  <br>  Death allows rebirth and everything is a circle unto itself, I think death is probably the most scary of subject matter because there are so many questions and uncertainty that come with it but it is a process: we will all die, with that fact it might be a good idea to configure in  your mind your own peace with it.|`|Zhz1LhOvaa	I think Death Exsists obvoiusly but i also agree that time is laid out kind of like on a line. <br>  <br>  So for example. When you drive down a road you can look back and see where you have gone. Therefore you can see the path you travelled. Then when you look forward you see the end of the road but you cant garuntee how you are going to get there. therefore you could crash (die) on the way under many circumstanses. I think no matter when you die there is still some road (TIME) ahead and so i think it carries on but not in a heaven sense. <br>  <br>  If you belive that there are many demensions and parallel universes (Quatum Physics) then i think the energy is transferred to a different place and time along the line i was describing. If Steven Hawkins proves his theory then this will be true. <br>  <br>  This answer your question.

I cried so hard in this book. <br>  <br>  My Sisters Keeper - Jodie Picoult<br>  One girl had cancer and her parents genetically engineered a genetic match for her. Once the "test tube baby" grows to a teenager she requests medical emancipation so she doesn't have to donate her kidney to her sister.

A psychiatric institution that is turned on its head by McMurphy, a man obviously not insane. The manipulative warden Nurse Ratched dictates the ward with shocking consequences.<br>  <br>  Tuesdays With Morrie - Mitch Albom<br>  The true story of Mitch Albom's old professor who is dying and every tuesday, gives Albom a lesson of life. <br>  <br>  The Poisonwood Bible - Barbara Kingslover<br>  A Reverand, his wife and four daughters move to the Congo to try and convert the locals to christianity. The point of view of all the daughters allows us to see how they grow and mature and learn that their father is not all controlling.<br>  <br>  The Obernewtyn Chronicles - Isobelle Carmody<br>  A post-apocalyptic world ruled by a dictatorship of a government. Some people begin to show signs of advanced mental abilities (read others minds, have visions of the future etc) and are burned or taken to "farms" which inevitably mean death.

I55HAkiwaa	ASSOLUTAMENTE NO! AL TEMPO VIGEVA LA GIURISDIZIONE ROMANA anche se i sacerdoti hanno contribuito soprattutto dopo l' episodio del tempio! La questione di Pilato potrebbe ingenerare delle contraddizioni ma il potere di condannare a morte era solo in mano ai romani! L' accusa di Deicidio è alla base di tutto l' antisemitismo Dopo Cristo. Una dei motivi fondamentali per cui nei secoli questo popolo è stato perseguitato. La stessa chiesa, con Giovanni Paolo II, mi pare abbia chiesto scusa. Inoltre la crocifissione, era in vigore presso i romani e non presso gli ebrei che piuttosto usavano al lapidazione. E' stato un gesto emblematico e le alte personalità religiose ebraiche hanno fatto al loro parte per paura che quest'uomo provocasse una vera e propria rivoluzione.

La pena era la morte. <br>  Ponzio Pilato, però, aveva capito che condannando a morte un personaggio con un tale seguito di fedeli, avrebbe avuto più guai di quelli ke immaginava, quindi propose al popolo la scelta fra liberare Gesù, da molti creduto un pazzo o uno stupido, oppure Barabba, un assassino, sperando ke il popolo preferisse salvare Gesù. <br>  Così non fu. <br>  Aizzato dai sacerdoti, il popolo preferì Barabba, e Gesù fu suppliziato e crocifisso.|`|bc34061af7ca934d3936e660434e518faa	bah se leggi la bibbia devi dargli retta ma ricordatri la bibbia deve essere sempre tradotta in un contesto piu ampio quello secondo me voleva dire ke il popolo nonostante fosse arrivato il salvatore nn lo voleva<br>  <br>  p.s.<br>  anke se sei atea risparmiati ti prego le risposte ha fatto diventare un esaltato un eroe perke per te è un esaltato per noi un maestro<br>  <br>  p.p.s.<br>  arivedi buona questa ahahaha|`|f6d30c2bb21a689104ec513d2a2cb489aa	Se lo avessero ucciso gli ebrei, Gesù sarebbe stato lapidato perché era questa la pena prevista per i bestemmiatori.

liberare lui o Barabba e hanno scelto Barabba.<br>  <br>  Questi sono i dati storici.<br>  <br>  La teologia spiega questi fatti come un preciso disegno divino e cioè che se gli avvenimenti storici reali di allora sono effettivamente questi e Gesù di Nazareth è il Messaggero divino che l'anima buona del popolo ebraico aveva elaborato nelle sue concezioni precedenti perchè venisse a salvarli e nelle concezioni ebraiche e nelle loro leggi morali, come ha fatto rilevare papa Giovanni Paolo ll i pii ebrei hanno sempre visto il "vero volto " di Cristo dentro di sè, tuttavia, eproprio per volontà del Padre è stato impedito loro di riconoscere in Gesù Cristo il vero Messia e lo sarà finchè sulla terra non si saranno verificate le condizioni alle quali la speranza biblica le associa e cioè che " quando arriverà il vero Messia sulla terra verrà il regno di Dio, tutti si riconosceranno fratelli, e ci sarà un regno di pace, amore e fratellanza fra tutti gli uomini e tutte le creature del creature del creato.<br>  I Cristiani riconoscono in Gesù Cristo questo messaggero divino e pertanto è per Sua stessa volontà che gli avvenimenti storici sono avvenuti nel modo in cui sono avvenuti  e noi dobbiamo accettarli come tali e non incolpare nessuno perchè se è avvenuto così è perchè Lui l'ha voluto e noi non dobbiamo chiederci niente ma accettare la Sua volontà perchè Lui sa perchè l'ha fatto.<br>  Gli ebrei stessi comunque sono già stati perdonati perchè ignari, non consapevoli e strumenti innocenti della volontà Volontà e dei disegni divini che, in tal modo, il Signore ha destinato ad essere depositari dell Sua eterna e immutabile legge mentre ai Cristiani ha assegnato il compito ( da svolgere non certo contro loro fratelli maggiori che, ripeto, Cristo sa che dentro loro conoscono già il Suo vero "volto"e ha già "perdonato") 1) di credere in ciò in cui gli ebrei credono e cioè che esiste un solo e unico Dio per tutto il genere umano ( e questo non era necessario dirlo ai discepoli ebrei di Cristo ma specialmente ai pagani come Paolo e tutti quelli che non conoscevano e putroppo non conoscono ancora la vera e profonda conmcettualità ebraica) ma soprattutto di diffondere la fede e la fiducia nella Sua Bontà e il concetto pertanto che ogni essere umano è il proprio fratello colcompito però di cercare di diffondere questa certezza, di dimostrarla con le proprie azioni e non trarsi indietro nel mostrare e cercare di convincere che comportamenti umani che non tengano conto di quelle leggi morali e dell'amore che ciascun uomo deve avere verso gli altri uomini sono leggi sbagliate e l'uomo deve correggersi se segue leggi che lo spingono ad infrangerle e alla violenza e alla sopraffazione di altri uomini.<br>  Sarà allora, quando il lavoro che Cristiani ed Ebrei portano avanti insieme perchè si realizzi questo disegno divino di pace e fratellanza fra tutta l'umanità, che, quando sarà avvenuto e le scritture si saranno realizzate che Il Signore darà agli Ebrei il permesso di riconoscere anche il Suo Volto umano ed essi potranno riconoscere in Lui il vero Messia che aspettano.<br>  Ebrei e Cristiani sono lo stesso popolo  che insieme anche se con diversi compiti lavora perchè sia fatta la volontà del Signore, perchè si avverino le scritture e perchè " venga sulla terra il Suo Regno" come ogni giorno preghiamo e per realizzare il quale dobbiamo impegnarci in uno sforzo d'amore ma anche imparando cosa significa veramente amare, allontanando da noi domande inutili e pensieri sbagliati su chi non lo merita o cercando di corregere chi, anche se in nome di Dio, sbaglia e si discosta dalle sue vere ed eterne leggi del bene.<br>  Ecco perchè credo che su certi fatti storici voluti da Dio non dobbiamo più soffermarci ne chiederci niente in senso negativo nè lasciare che le nostre anime si riempiano di uno sbagliato rancore ma disporre la nostra anima al bene cercando di ascoltare le parole che Israele dice  al mondo aperto e disponibile dentro ad ascoltarle perchè spesso non sono parole umane ma grida di dolore che l'umanità non sente, non ascolta, non capisce.<br>  "Padre, perdona loro perchè non sanno quello che fanno" e se il Signore ha perdonato non dovrebbe mettere in pace la sua anima ogni cristiano e dimenticare fatti puramente storici ed umani per comprenderne i significati più spirituali e profondi.<br>  Chi massacra quel popolo ( senza ovviamente parlare di ogni singolo la cui anima e il cui operato in vita sarà Dio stesso a giudicare come quello di ognuno di noi) massacra se stesso, e chi massacra quel popolo massacra Cristo stesso che quel popolo rappresenta.<br>  Non parlo di simpatie o antipatie personali che sono un'altra cosa e nessuno ne è esente) parlo di sentimeti, di idee, di concetti.<br>  nessun altro popolo sulla terra ha resistito per 5000 anni e non è certo, a mio avviso, perchè li si considera gente caparbia e tenace, questo non basta, ma perchè difendono un principio unico e valido in eterno di cui tutti siamo chiamati a farne parte e, senza invidie assurde, chiunque, se vuole, fa parte ed è popolo eletto perchè è dentro di sè che da sè sceglie di essere eletto e appartenere a quel popolo in qualunque forma esterna di ritualità si esprima.<br>  <br>  La religione ebraica ( in quanto religione = concentrazione di dogmi, interiorizzazione di concetti e ritualità esterne ) è nata si può dire nello stesso momento in cui è nato il Cristianesimo, prima era ,per quanto ci fossero  ovviamente preghiere e ritualità, la storia di un popolo o meglio di una etnia che, con la dispersione degli ebrei ha perso queste caratteristiche e si trasformata in una religione.<br>  Perso il proprio stato e il potere politico la religione ebraica ha continuato ad essere professata sotto qualsiasi regime politico in altri stati al quale gli ebrei sono fedeli a condizione che li si lasci liberi di professare la propria fede.<br>  Nel posto dove hanno instaurato il loro attuale stato e possono per esempio mettere in pratica statalmente il riposo sabbatico e le tradizioni del popolo non le impongono 1) perchè le questioni morali ed etiche appartengono a ciascun individuo personalmente per cui uno ha diritto di professare la religione che crede e con la ritualità che vuole<br>  2) perchè , per quanto la religione ebraica sia un modo di credere che coinvolge tutta la vita e ogni singolo momento della vità di ogni ebreo e si possa anche considerare un sistema di vita, sta proprio nel concetto che esiste un solo Dio creatore di tutto il genere umano che rende ogni uomo un individuo unico e irripetibile assolutamente uguale di fronte a Dio a tutti gli altri e pertanto preserva l'uomo dalla schiavitù che i suoi simili tendono ad imporgli.<br>  Politicamente gli ebrei hanno accettato domini politici imposti loro da Assiri, Babilonesi, Greci, Romani, Arabi, Mongoli..........si sono ribellati solo quando qualcuno voleva loro togliere la libertà di credere come ritenevano giusto fare o quando qualcuno voleva loro imporre loro di attribuire ad un uomo ( per esempio Augusto) la adorazione e la sottomissione assoluta che si deve solo a Dio.<br>  Tutti pertanto sono da considerarsi fratelli fra loro tanto che nelle loro preghiere invocano la pace su di loro come ebrei e su tutti quelli che credono che esiste un solo Dio per tutti gli uomini il che si esprime con le parole ( Shalom aleinu ve al kol Israel intendendo con la parola Israel non solo gli ebrei sparsi in tutto il mondo ma tutto il mondo monoteista ).|`|7644b0f5e369a23322dbcdef5baf582faa	si ce un velato antisemitismo ma dai per favore ragazzi come si fa a dire una cosa del genere|`|777ac571fb0b8c7bdad8a7de6397fe2faa	un antisemistismo nemmeno tanto velato lo si trovava nel canone della liturgia sino al vaticano II quando di parlava di perfidi giudei, in ogni caso storicamente non è attribuibile agli ebrei la crocifissione di gesù anche se quelli che vi assistettero erano ebrei, in quanto erano uno sparuto gruppo di persone e perché la crocifissione di gesù fu un fatto politico e non religioso, appoggiato anche da roma|`|d6c8796efaaa359d5f26a20592e65f16aa	Gesù, é un fatto storicamente accertato, fu condannato dai suoi CONCITTADINI ebrei i quali , nelle persone del grande sacerdote e i componenti del sinedrio, lo accusarono di bestemmia perché dichiarò pubblicamente di essere il "Messia" e quindi "Figlio di Dio".<br>  Essi preferirono liberare Barabba.<br>  La condanna a morte fu emanata ed eseguita dai romani dietro le fortissime pressioni degli ebrei e per quieto vivere, in quanto agli ebrei era vietato, dai romani stessi, di comminare la pena capitale (gli ebrei dell'epoca, se non avessero avuto questa imposizione dai romani lo avrebbero fatto loro; gli ebrei avevano diversi metodi per le esecuzioni capitali tipo la lapidazione ecc.).<br>  Conclusione:<br>  Si gli ebrei dell'epoca condannarono il loro concittadino Gesù di Nazaret a morte.<br>  Non c'é antisemitismo in questa affermazione ma prendere atto della verità storica.

Poetry needs colour and emotion, personality, not doctrine and argument.  It may argue, but in its own way.  I hate the adage but it is quite true, I suppose, try to "show not tell".  Rhyming is good and often necessary, but don't get hung up on it.  The more you read and practice, the easier it'll get.  You might find yourself doing it without even realizing!  <br>  <br>  P.S:  The fact that you're 13 doesn't really mean that much.  A lot of people write at that age, they don't all carry it through to later life.  What it means is that you have interests that go beneath the appearance of things, don't let that fool you into thinking you're 'ahead of the game' or something.

vUpjOUQQaa	A degree in any discipline is always a bonus , particulaly in looking for employment. (Fine Arts degrees are the exception, that is why most FA grads work at mcDonalds LOL).<br>  <br>  A degree shows that you are a critical thinker, able to research and question properly and do not jump to hasty conclusions without facts. That is why tertiary qualified people tend to take senior leadership and management roles.<br>  <br>  There are jobs as historians but these are usually tied up with either university teaching or research.<br>  <br>  Generally historians will branch off into a discipline and write books , one of my favorite historians was Shelby Foote who sadly passed away in 2005. <br>  <br>  What he did not know about the American Civil war was not worth knowing. He wrote a 3 volume work on the Civil war which is still in demand in higher learning institutions world wide since first publication in 1958.<br>  <br>  I am a lover of history as well. best of luck in your endeavors.<br>  <br>  Edit, I agree that australia has virtually stooped teaching history in the classroom,. generally because australian history is rather dull, largely political and spans a very short period of time.<br>  <br>  Australia and America both became countries around the same time (1770s)<br>  and in the same period america has had a revolutionary war, a civil war as well as the history of the west etc etc , Australia has had nothing that even compares to that.<br>  <br>  But still i am proud to be an Aussie and would not swap it for the world.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	SCHOOL TEACHER<br>  <br>  HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE|`|7kUyIGQhaa	Your major will cease to matter a few months into your job, but your knowledge of history, ability to draw historical parallels, and to understand historical references, will impress the hell out of people and make you sound smart.  The lessons of history will help you deal with everyday problems, understand human behaviours and psychology (much better than a psychology degree!), and generally be sure of your decisions.<br>  <br>  Anything involving writing and argument is greatly assisted by knowledge of history, and just reading history will make you learn the techniques by imitation.|`|NmvaEmKBaa	I work in an industry that is full of business majors. I am a History major and a writer. From my observations, there has been absolutely no distinction between their degrees and mine, other than to say that I am a far more interesting person to talk to and popular at parties. The knowledge of history has made my writing exponentially better as it has forced me to do a large amount of research on any topic I write about (or even ponder). <br>  <br>  Money wise, a history degree will get you no more or less than almost any other major and if you love history, you will love going to school. If you love going to school, you will learn more. <br>  <br>  Easy!!|`|LyS5lPAEaa	it is worth getting u could become a histrorian and maybe one day become famous or get paid lots of money|`|0OJ43kpsaa	hi Patrick,<br>  <br>  Keep the faith, Patrick. Computer tech is a specialisation. Engineering is a specialisation. Sports medicine is a specialisation.<br>  <br>  History is an EDUCATION.<br>  <br>  How do people know whether something is new or has happened before? They ask an historian. Except if they're journalists, because asking for facts like that would most likely get in the way of a good story.<br>  <br>  Mind you, I am a journalist, but when one of our state premiers (aka Governor) anounced an election for December 7, I muttered "oh, great story" and then had to explain to everyone else in the news room what was historically signficant about December 7 (1941, Pearl harbour). BTW, the Governor lost the election, sank out of sight!<br>  <br>  You can't understand where you're going to if you've never known where you're coming from. Historians give the world meaning. We explain how it fits together.<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean that history can't change, or that there's a single "right" way to understand it. History is the survival of the fittest explanation.<br>  <br>  Let me see. Teaching can be a great option, from high school to college and so on. Research grants may help make you a published author. There are conservator and research posts at major museums. They are even Analyst roles within military and intelligence establishments, who need smart people to compare the was-then with the here-now.<br>  <br>  Can't picture an analyst? That was the role of Alec Baldwin's character in "The Hunt for Red October".<br>  <br>  Australia has almost stopped teaching history. The candle has almost sputtered out. But some of us keep hoping the nation will see sense, and there is talk of some mandatory history subjects in an inaugurl national curriculum now being debated and written. Wish us luck!
WJLl0d3Jaa	You're using it on auto setting, amirite?<br>  <br>  Turn the main dial to Tv (or was it just T for pentax?) which is Shutter Priority. You will have manual control over the shutter speed then.<br>  <br>  Going full manual is also an option. Please take your DSLR off auto mode now and then, the amount of manual control you get cannot be duplicated by a point and shoot...if you're going to use it as a point and shoot, then you've wasted your money.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  <br>  Rehash that flash/Tv question for me man, not sure I understand. One thing to keep in mind, flash will help stop action (which is also what high shutter speeds do).|`|TbTO5SXlaa	If the delay only happens when you use the flash then the flash is causing the problem. The flash has to recycle (recharge, not "warm up") before its ready to take another flash picture. The only real cure is to A) Don't use the flash or B) Buy a Pentax external flash or C) Just learn to accept the delay. Obviously "B" is the best choice.<br>  <br>  I suggest a thorough READING & STUDYING of the Owner's Manual for your camera.<br>  <br>  These books will also help you:<br>  <br>  "Digital SLR Handbook" by John Freeman.<br>  <br>  "Understanding Exposure" and "Understanding Shutter Speed", both by Bryan Peterson.<br>  <br>  Photographer and author David Busch ( <a href="http://www.dbusch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dbusch.com</a> ) has written a Guide for your camera. Buy it. It will clarify any parts of the original Manual which are confusing to you.<br>  <br>  I also suggest subscribing to at least one photography magazine. My personal favorite is Shutterbug.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	The camera slows down for a couple of reasons. In the auto settings with the flash up the camera needs to obtain focus, calculate the exposure and then fire the flash. The flash then needs to recycle which depending on the condition of your battery can take a few seconds. Then it will start all over again. <br>  The write speed of your card can have something to do with it but not really with single shot pictures. If you are firing off a number of pictures in a row this will effect the speed as the camera has to clear the buffer before you can take another picture.<br>  On the manual modes with no flash it should be instantaneous. The other thing that will slow it down is that in low light the camera sometimes has trouble obtaining focus. Especially when there isn't much contrast. In this situation you can either manually focus or add more light.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	It will very likely be due to the speed of your memory card. Cards that are ideal for photography are much faster than standard SD or CF cards. When you take a photo the image has to be transferred to your memory card. A slow card makes the camera slower to respond for the next shot. It also takes much longer when you a taking raw or tiff shots - they contain much more data than jpegs.<br>  <br>  If you drop into your local camera store they will show you the different card types and relevant speed ratings. Fast cards are definitely a necessary investment for serious photography.|`|lEpQgeRJaa	If I knew the answer to that I would tell you but I suggest you download the user guide (link below) if you don't have a copy. Failing that you could join a photographer forum.
wsOjj9qJaa	To answer the first part of your question, you should practise turnout and your strength and stamina. Ask your teacher for some good excesses. To answer the second part of your question, of course you can be good at ballet when starting late. It just takes lots of hard work and practise. The Contemporary and jazz will help but you will find ballet needs far more discipline with maintaining turnout and poise, etc. Good luck.

You might mention that you'd like to keep word of your involvement between yourself and the administrator. Also let him or her know that if in the course of handling the situation they could spare your sister any further cause for bullying...(ie keeping her name out of the conversation with the bully) you would appreciate it.|`|IcHarGt7aa	There are three logical things you could do, the decision being yours based on the situation.  If this has been going on for a long time, it is most likely that your sister has not stood up to this bully.  Standing up to a bully is easier than it seems.  Remember that bullies thrive on fear.  Just telling them that you won't be afraid of them anymore no matter what they do can be quite powerful as well as personally freeing.<br>  <br>  The second thing you might do as her sister is make an anonymous call to the administration office and tell them about the situation.  Say you don't want to embarrass your sister by "tattling," but that THEY need to resolve it.  Tell them it is their job to keep the students safe.<br>  <br>  Your third option is to deal with this girl directly.  Find out when and where the bully girl picks on your sister and be there.  It is not pathetic at all, just risky as you could get in trouble for being on the property of a school you do not go to.  <br>  <br>  These problems are not easy, but if your sister does not stand up to this punk now, she will always allow other people to abuse her.  Unless she is in some way handicapped, choose the first suggestion.|`|BrrYGLfMaa	In my own opinion the best thing to do this without you beating the other girl is to report this to her teachers or to the school principal.

Let's say he didn't know he was chosen, but someone shoots at him and misses taking his life. The chosen person pulls out his own legal fire arm and kills the person who shot him. Now one person is dead. Does that satisfy the requirement that one person dies to save others?<br>  <br>  4)The primary question, however, is >Who gives anyone the right to choose another and kill the other?< Nothing in natural law and the rule of law provides for the creation of a person who chooses who lives and who dies.<br>  <br>  The affirmitive (your side) maintains that allowing a human to keep the life he owns may mean the death of others.<br>  1) HOW is this to be decided when no one has a crystal ball?<br>  <br>  The answer to that is the answer to the ethical problem considered here. The possibility that such a situation arises only when we see someone already taking innocent lives, such as Hitler did, or as Mugabe is doing.<br>  <br>  Who is to say that killing Hitler would not have propelled Goering to do worse things as retaliation?

ceBTTCPwaa	Into the Wild (1996) by Jon Krakauer is a bestselling non-fiction book about the adventures of Christopher McCandless. It is an expansion of Krakauer's 9,000-word article, "Death of an Innocent", which appeared in the January 1993 issue of Outside. Krakauer intersperses McCandless's story with a discussion of the wilderness experiences of people such as Everett Ruess, John Muir, and John Menlove Edwards, as well as some of his own adventures. Krakauer first went to Alaska in 1974 and has returned there twenty times since. He spent three years carrying out the background research work for this biography.<br>  <br>  Chris McCandless grew up in Annandale, Virginia, and died at age 24 in a wilderness area in the state of Alaska. Though the evidence is inconclusive, it has been suggested that Christopher McCandless died of eating a wild potato root which had a poisonous fungus on it, leading to his starvation. After graduating in 1990 from Emory University, McCandless ceased communicating with his family, gave away his savings of $24,000 to Oxfam and began traveling, later abandoning his car and burning all the money in his wallet.<br>  <br>  In April 1992, Jim Gallien gave McCandless a ride to the Stampede Trail in Alaska. There McCandless headed down the snow-covered trail to begin an odyssey with only ten pounds of rice, a .22 caliber rifle, a camera, several boxes of rifle rounds, and a small selection of reading material — including a field guide to the region's edible plants, Tana'ina Plantlore. He had no road map or compass, having left his tattered map with Gallien.

Its a true story about a young man called Christopher Johnson Mccandless, so no the author is not sharing his own experiences.<br>  <br>  Why dont you look it up on google or wikipedia? I'm sure you will get the information you need. :-)|`|4zscfvvoaa	It is a great book.  I am assuming that you didn't grasp the greater meaning, or didn't read the whole thing.<br>  <br>  Summary:<br>  <br>  Story of a kid, or young man, that has the whole world.  High achiever, in a great school.  Comes from a good family.  He turns to a transit lifestyle and travels the country.  Then he decides to go into the wild.  His name was Chris, right?  It has been a long time since I have read it.  Anyway, he ended up dieing in that bus.  The sad thing is, he was not that far out in the country.  He was only miles out from help.  He had a journal though.  He took photos of himself up till the end.  He looked happy, and his writing were that of someone that was pleased with life.  He was only like 24 or so.<br>  <br>  If I remember the layout correctly, it starts off with him being going into the wild.  It talks about the guy that gave him the boots and all.  He hitched a ride.  Last person to see him alive.  It then goes into some history.  Later it comes back to the bus.  He was discovered by hunters.  Then it really get good.  At the end of the story the author meets with the parent at the bus.  It is interesting.<br>  <br>  The author writes a few chapters about his experience in Alaska.  Those chapters could have been done without.  The author is very famous for nature books though.  He also wrote Into Thin Air.<br>  <br>  So you have to write an analysis.  Your needing a thesis.  Well, that is going to be hard.  You have to take a stance on your view of the book.  I would write something about it being a story of a free spirit escaping from society and social norms.  A good thesis is hard to come up with if I am not writing the essay.  Something along the lines ... ... ... Although Chris had the potential of great social status available to him, his heart would have never rested if he didn't embark on the trail to freedom.<br>  <br>  I would use supporting arguments such as his writings, his time in the desert, his freelance spirit, and his roaming the country.  I hope I have helped somewhat.  It is not that easy to do, since I feel you did not read the book.  If that is the case, I hope you consider reading it.

7CHt3IE1aa	The easiest way to identify the speaker is dialogue tags eg,<br>  <br>  'You're a pathetic excuse for a soldier, aren't you lad?,' boomed General Claudius.<br>  'Yes, sir, I'm sorry, sir,' whined the legionary.<br>  <br>  In those two lines we know who us speaking because we're told. Even if I hadn't told you, we could guess- no legionary would dare speak to his commanding officer in such a manner. Notice also the dialogue attribution- the General- a big, powerful man- will 'boom', whereas the legionary, a minor soldier whose biggest ambition is not to get latrine duty, will 'whine' to show he isn't that important.<br>  <br>  Even the words inside the quotation marks can identify character- an insult followed by a question implies confidence, where an apology implies subservience.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, don't go overboard on the dialogue attribution- it's the lazy writers' method of characterisation.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Yr teacher sounds like a pain in the backside. Go tell them that 900 words isn't really enough to create anything more than the broadest of stereotypes.|`|I7YFlxPMaa	New voices? I'm assuming you mean two different ways of speaking. It really depends. Maybe one of them can use proper English, and the other could use slang.

7FsbxYbgaa	All of these answers are right, it does take time, but you need to be practicing the right way too. It should take about a month to get used to your braces and start getting your upper register back. Make sure not to overplay in hopes of that making the adjustment faster. Play until your lips start hurting, and don't push it after that. Don't force too much to play long or high because this runs the risk of doing permanent damage to your lips. If it is unbearable and not getting better you can always go with using a Braceguard. I don't have experience with one but I sure wish I knew about them when I had braces.|`|pgUfi7XMaa	You just have to get used to having metal in your mouth because I have braces also.

YiY9Yd2Jaa	You give no indication as to your gender, but I'll assume that you are female - most guys wouldn't bother about preparing for a photoshoot. <br>  <br>  Don't overdo the makeup, concentrate on getting your hair and clothing looking attractive. You only need to ensure that you facial skin doesn't shine - the photographer will do the rest. Using eye drops to ensure clear and bright eyes also helps. Do not lean forward in any pose (this is why they often seat subjects on stools - to make them sit erect) Even if it is a "glamour" shot where you are displaying cleavage, you can lean your body forward but keep your head erect.<br>  <br>  Skin blemishes etc, can be easily removed in post processing, so don't go to great lengths to cover them. Keep your head high - it improves the jaw line and appearance of the neck. Imagine that you are making yourself appear taller than someone of equal height who is alongside you, gently stretch upward - but do it while keeping relaxed. Clean any jewelry that might be in a shot - make it sparkle.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	I went and found links to help you prepare for your shoot.  Most of them say about the same thing.

This allows light trails and such to form, but at the very end of the exposure the flash fires and freezes that actual subject.<br>  <br>  This is called second curtain sync.<br>  <br>  If you are just using the pop up flash, you will have to go into the custom settings to enable second curtain sync. Your owner manual can tell you exactly how. Just search for "Second Curtain Sync" in the index at the back.<br>  <br>  If you are using a hot shoe mounted flash, you will need to set this in the flash, as it will over ride the settings in the camera.<br>  <br>  On the back of the flash is a button that has a couple of side facing arrows and a lightening bolt.

T88SgE59aa	I will assume you are referring to Herman Melville's "Bartleby the Scrivener."  Bartleby is one of the most interesting characters in all of American literature.  He is very independent and, at times, very depressing.  He takes a job as a scrivener (scribe) with a law firm only to be fired shortly thereafter for his apparent laziness.  When his boss asks him to do something, he often replies "I would prefer not to."  That phrase becomes his mantra throughout the story.  Actually, it is this preference not to do anything that leads to his death.  In the end, Bartleby "prefers" not to eat and eventually starves to death.  After his death, it was determined that Bartleby worked at the dead letter office.  This is the office where all of the undeliverable mail is sent.  This is supposedly where Bartleby developed his strange behavior.<br>  <br>  I hope that answers your question.<br>  Happy reading!!!|`|CLpSZQL5aa	Um, is that the Bartleby who keeps saying "I'd prefer not to," or whatever? That story annoyed me. Assuming I'm right, I'd say he crazy from working in the dead letters office.|`|JeOB5AAcaa	He is a lover of James, Oh shoot, wait a second, that is Bartles. Sorry:).<br>  c

c97884712264a19f23634b93afda8d19aa	The propaganda used by the U.S. and by Nazi Germany were very similar.<br>  <br>  Both countries used base nationalism and patriotism as the foundation of both nations' rhetoric. Both vilified the enemy while glorifying themselves. The same themes can be seen in the propaganda of pretty much any nation.<br>  <br>  Of course, the propaganda of the National Socialist government tended to be more ethnic/"race"-focused, but this was not universal in *all* German propaganda.<br>  <br>  It's interesting to note that both the U.S. and Nazi Germany called out for women to "do their part" in the Second World War. While American women were temporarily allowed to perform "men's work" (i.e., industrial work), German women were were urged to breed like rabbits in order to further the Aryan "race" (because there was a dramatic drop in birth rates in Germany following the Great Depression and to the end of the Second World War).<br>  <br>  Although the Nazi Party was anti-modern, the propaganda it used was very modern and, in many ways, superior to that of other nations. "Triumph of the Will" is a perfect example of pro-National Socialist propaganda. Stylistically, it is hailed even today as being the most perfect film ever produced. In addition, the Nazi Party spared no expense in producing propaganda posters, which is evident in the powerful symbolism and stunning artwork of the pieces.|`|AA10813012	American propaganda focused on poster with advice and movies that explained "Why We Fight". In reality, it wasn't far from the truth. News outlets retained independence, and often reported stories that weren't favorable to the government.<br>  Hitler's propaganda was far more insidious, infused with Nazi race ideology and inflating or outright lying about facts. Speeches, movies, newspapers, and almost any information outlet was fed what to say... or else.

The same thing happened.  I really liked the book so much better!  During the fashion week in Paris, she walked away from Miranda and cursed at her!  It was really great!  But...they didn't include that in the movie!  The book is 100,000,000x better!  I highly reccommend it!  Miranda is sooo much meaner in the book!  It is hilarious!|`|8068df1cd72c924194cff1a1cd68b049aa	she did. but at the end. she didn't just walk away form Miranda. she told he to go f*** herself. it was the best part of the book, and they ruined that for me in the movie. also Miranda was about 15 times meaner in the book than she was in the moive|`|5325349a212895c2e5cccd74cae37712aa	Yes she did. But she leaves early like in the movie, but for different reasons.|`|AA12089073	Yeah she did, the few things they got right in the movie.
o6Fyeg6Faa	Besides the fact they were both American and that families were torn apart by family members fighting on opposite sides. That would be about it.|`|AA11805053	Civil War, lynching, Jim Crow South, Sit-ins, Marches, murders of Civil Rights workers, or any of the things which ultimately served as the canon fodder which brought about the Watts riots of 1965 and other riots in America to follow.  We must remember, that the original reason Lincoln decided to fight the Civil War was to preserve the Union--not to free the slaves.  Slavery emancipation came later as an ancillary part of the original notion.  So the idea, that the war was fought to free the slaves is a fantasy.  The invention of the cotton gin had more to due with freeing the slaves than anything else.  Since, thereafter it became unnecessary to exploit the free labor force which slavery had provided up until that time.  There were lynchings occuring up North as there were down South.  The difference was in the frequency.  The entire issue of "social equality" with Americans of African extraction was reall about the same.|`|kbmzgdFBaa	I supposed both were mostly from English background, but different ideas|`|HDAVotctaa	Both were fighting a war for the preservation of a way of life. After the South seceded from the Union, the North's goal became just to preserve the Union as best they could.  The South left the Union to preserve what the North threatened to destroy: the slavery system.<br>  <br>  Ummm, other than that, the only thing that comes to mind right now is that both sides wanted Robert E. Lee as general.  He was the North's first choice, but chose to fight for the South because he was from Virginia.|`|LMeg8uSyaa	they both wanted to earn territories and defend their commerce|`|fa1675168a0af0b3dbe466a9c2efc9b5aa	The main similarity is that they were all Americans.Both sides fought for what they believed was right.As to them being mostly English that is totally wrong.Both sides had regiments of all races,Irish,Swedish,Scots as America was and still is a melting pot of all creeds and races.In the end it was Americans fighting Americans.|`|xB2A7SKfaa	The North was an industrial society, which the South was unable to mimic.  Where the North could achieve a multitude of tasks, with machines, the South was still a farming community.  <br>  <br>  Slavery wasn't necessarily the KEY element on why the Civil War was fought.  Essentially, the South did want to pursue a different course of action than the North, regarding the governing of its states.  <br>  <br>  You could more or less compare it to the American Colonies' War against the British.  <br>  <br>  A key factor in the slavery consideration, is that not a great deal of people in the South owned slaves.  What you need to remember is that it was very expensive to own them, as you had to provide the necessities for them.  Seeing as a great deal of the Southern population were farmers, and a large majority were of those were fairly recent immigrants, then that wouldn't allow for the monetary ability to own slaves.
Zf60Ce3Qaa	check out some of the books on amazon.com about starting a photography business.  I am in the same situation and I have found several books that look helpful that I plan to order.  I would also set up a website if you don't have one yet.  Put an ad in your local paper.  If your grocery stores have a bulletin board as you enter that you can post business cards do that.  If you are looking to do senior portraits go to local schools and ask if you can put an ad on their bulletin board, many will let you.  Sign up to be in local craft fairs - they are useful not only to sell your work but to get your name out there.  Print up brochures to have at the fairs telling what you do and giving your web address.  Many county fairs also rent booths and those are a great place to get local exposure.|`|5ee66136e5dbd58e2d1825fb144ebcd4aa	It depends how far you are prepared to travel, we have found that the best way after refferral business is the internet, it's a medium that is permenantly there, and you can showcase easily at very low expense. It does require optimizing, which is not that hard to do, but does require effort, on of the ways to do that is to link to related sites. It takes about 3-6 months for it to start generating business, but is always handy to show prospective local clients what you do.<br>  If you have a site already, contact us on our contact page and we would be happy to link exchange with you.|`|LAQ0wNd3aa	There is a huge national televised sports event with pay per view as well October 19, 20 and 21 in San Francisco California.
