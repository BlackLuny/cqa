AA12360662	First of all, if there is any gay related news or things happened to you that you experienced in day time, that can link up the relationship between you and your boy friend.  However,<br>  <br>  Projecting your boy friend being bisexual could suggest that there is some sort of insecurity in you.  Some people would dream of their partner cheating, in your case, bi sexual may be another way to say that you are seeking for attention from him.  <br>  <br>  There is something you want him to know rather than just relationship.  In dream,  you magnify the situation and therefore you had this dream vent out.|`|ugJHDON6aa	that is hot.  i mean, if he is bi, enjoy it with him.
gexz9Dk8aa	i know people who travel usually have a gerat, interesting life. When i'm 17 or 18, im taking an international internship overseas (i'm thinking spain, or somewhere else warm). i'm even taking spanish lessons online.<br>  <br>  Also, have u noticed how people in third world countries get such happiness when they get offered the simplest gift? That's because they appreciate everything. Your have to pay attention to details to take in every joy in life.<br>   <br>  and have u noticed what else makes people happy? other people! interaction! i'm thinking u don'thave too many people to talk to. or overprotective parents? something holding you back? <br>  <br>  if it's external (parents, finance) then the best u can do is try to do exciting things that make your day interesting. <br>  If it's internal (low self esteem, confidence) , then what u should do is break out of your comfort zone. start a sport. something u know nothing about. I started gymnsatics, even though i could not do a cartwheel, a handstand, a forward rol, or touch my toes. Now i can do the splits and round off +. I'm starting 3 new sports this year. I can't wait!<br>  <br>  Last but not least, people may have said this to u, but CHANGE YOUR OUTLOOK ON LIFE. find someone that inspires you. Shawn Johnson, great gymnast. I know i won't be as good as her ever realistically, but she gives me something to look up to. There's this guy in my skool. he's bungee jumped, traveled to gd knows where, and he's the nicest, ambitious guy i've met. sad to say, he's my crush.<br>  <br>  Not saying get a crush for a good time haha! but yeah, i hope these tips helped you, because i had to do that all by myslef, with no help from anyone else. I was unhappy, so i just changed my outlook, and the way i approached issues. good luck, hope this helps!|`|306Dk9Ywaa	Life IS boring and repetitive. Its all about being a well-rounded individual. Its all about knowing as much as you can in your life, gathering wisdom and sharing your experiences with the rest of society. You may be in school now, and have the same routine every night, and in 10 years you'll have a job, and have a repetitive and boring routine in that. Find yourself while you can, change it up a bit every once in a while. Be spontaneous, but not stupid.|`|ufjzzm7Saa	I know exactly what you mean, with a few crap things in between.<br>  I'm not sure how to help you in class because the topics might just be boring, you know? Anyway, maybe after your homework you can try going for a run or something. It'll make you over-all happier and you're getting some excersise and something to do with your life.|`|Pw1fCNvXaa	life is what you make of it.<br>  <br>  if you find it boring, may i suggest following the ideas of the film Yes Man, saying yes to everything that comes your way. a friend of mine tried that out, and hes now a sushi chef, involved in a play production, and going out with a girl he met as a result of both.<br>  <br>  what do you have to lose?|`|S5vUEJ9Kaa	first, discover urself who you really are. refine it. find a group. enjoy if does good. if not eject. knowing yourself is your key to a happy life. <br>  <br>  know thyself - socrates|`|oiKRLPkNaa	it seems that you are in existential depression.the only way to get rid of it is to read.i mean you should read about the questions that you ask.otherwise you will loose your life.believe me|`|UCdAHm4Uaa	I know what you're saying and I totally agree. Maybe the meaning of life is to be repetitive and boring. Not for people to be repetitive and boring, but for life to be that way. Well, that's life! (C'est la vie!) <br>  <br>  So is this really how life is meant to be? Is it our jobs to change it; is it our job to make it interesting and spontaneous? I think so.<br>  <br>  This is somewhat difficult to do when one is a student and life seems to revolve around homework and such. So what do I do, being a teenager and student, like you? Whatever I feel like doing at that time. With restrictions, of course. I'm not going to go off vandalizing property, but I have fun! Just this past weekend, my friends and I had a movie marathon, but we ended up only watching one movie. The rest of the time we played Rock Band, talked, wrote/ read some funny stories (it's a long story about these stories...), and other things, too, that made the day really fun.<br>  <br>  Of course you have to make time for homework. A great thing to do when you have, say, a research project and you get to pick your topic, pick something fun that's actually somewhat interesting. Every year at my school we have this big thing, sort of like a Science Fair, but it's not all about science. Last year, I picked Haunted Ohio (which is where I'm from), and not only was I interested in it, but everybody else was, too. This year, I picked Greenpeace, because it's fun to read about some of the things they do and did to stand up for what they believe in.<br>  <br>  Change the littlest things in your life, whether it be trying out crazy, spontaneous outfits (but not ridiculous, gaudy ones that make you stand out the wrong way) or a new catch phrase. It'll help you make your life a little more interesting. Sometimes it's even fun to have a word of the day.<br>  <br>  I guess what I'm really saying is that what you have to do is get out there and LIVE! Have a girl's night- out or in. Go bowling. Go to the movies. Go shopping in another town where there are new things to try and new places to go. But most of all, be adventurous. But don't be stupid. Don't go off and get yourself arrested. <br>  <br>  Okey dorkey? =]|`|14dc5a2caf80531c380c037d989d53edaa	The inherent "problem" with life is ones own Fate Karma.  That is, we design our own Fate Karma in concert with a "judge" at the close of our past life.  And a portion of each life has  to include "Karmic debts" or actions taken against oneself because of actions one took against others in past lives.  And too, the purpose of Karma is to cause us to slowly move from  attachment to the illusion to an attachment to Reality.<br>  <br>  As one rises in Spiritual Evolution within oneself, one automatically begins to sense the physical plane as less exciting, less challenging and less fulfilling than it was previously.  But one has not awakened to ones Spirituality sufficiently to discover the reason for this... and this is the difficult stage of transformation.<br>  <br>  I believe it helps to focus on the fact that ones Soul is a Perfect Soul and that one doesn't have to "prove" anything to anyone.... except oneself.  To be at Peace knowing that ones very life is a learning experience... and that one needs to enjoy this physical plane as unique in that one can pretend on this plane... and one has to actually struggle to achieve on this plane.  <br>  <br>  In higher realms of reality one merely holds a thought and it manifests, and there is no struggling.  So this plane is our opportunity to "play" in physical ways that cannot be done on any other plane of Creation.<br>  <br>  To enjoy life, do so from the perspective I have just laid out... since this is what we are here to do.<br>  <br>  Peace|`|p20v99N2aa	Huh, wait until you're an old Dweeb like me.

Find a hobby, or do something that interests you. If you really want to get out of your rut, try looking at aspects of your life that you want to change, and visualize how you can make that change.<br>  <br>  Try going sky diving. That will mellow you out, and help you to appreciate the small things in life. :)|`|j7hxpwTdaa	hi twin|`|3dRuVAosaa	People arn't born with a facinating life :) Life is what you make of it. You can live life to the fullest by living each day like it was your last. What would you choose to do if you only had 24hrs left before death calls? It sounds easy but how many people can actually live life everyday that way? <br>  <br>  It would mean doing what we say and saying what we mean. It would mean no more procrastination or lies. It would mean telling people how much you care about them instead of just assuming that they know.<br>  <br>  Obviously, you cant do everything you want to in 24hours but I bet you could accomplish atleast 50% in your current life. You could even start by setting short term and long term goals of what you want to accomplish in life, places that you want to go to, ambitions etc.<br>  <br>  It works. Its a great source of motivation. The accomplished short term goals creates motivation for the long term goals. For example, working hard at school & doing your best would help you get into the major you are interested in university.<br>  <br>  It does pay off in the end. I'm not sure how old you are but I'm guessing it would take awhile but believe me, the fruits of your labour will be as sweet as candy!<br>  <br>  I'm guessing most people lead ''normal'' lives, living from day to day with the same routine, maybe its because they choose to? Not everyone fancies change.<br>  <br>  My long term goal is to work for the United Nations, Travel to third world countries, build schools or hospitals, educate kids and equipt parents in third world countries with skills so that they could provide for their own kids and etc. Its a lot of stuff and I may not be able to accomplish everything but it gives me great satisfaction to do everything I possible can in this life :)|`|45d774f93cd8fa9f498a7d7487bd0caaaa	Life may be felt repetitive and boring because the one who is living that life may have disowned the ardent daring risks of sublime adventures or the deeper reflections from the warm throbbing vaults of their own chest or soul.<br>  <br>  In the name of good order and for the sake of security and for the hope of survival and of greater unfolding or power, people may use certain paradigms, impose those paradigms on themselves and on others, and they may so methodically go on in their life repeating some methods, procedures, either more or less diligently, in a dedicated sacrificial way, or slovenly in tiredness and or lack of imagination, because they may feel it necessary and right to do so, because they may feel it their duty to do so, because their own imposed or chosen creed may demand of them to behave so.<br>  <br>  Now, enough with all this. For even in the grip of habitual repetitiveness of all life, we might try and find chances of great merry moments, of great laughs, of wildly feasting and dancing in good company, of dedicating ourselves to bodily perspiring exertions in an admirable style, in work or in sports that may lead on to chances of winning medals and glowing fame and also of serenely enriching our own bank-account with $ ￡ € or other precious currency.<br>  <br>  We might try and ever more diligently daringly warmly, in loving or in fair jousting interaction, work at building up, or adding up to, some glowing magic memories for a future.<br>  <br>  What the future may have in its safe for us, we cannot in advance surely say, not yet, maybe never at our present level of evolution, maybe later, maybe after some unexpected huge metamorphosis that may lead on to a great glowing apotheosis of sublime certainty and of ardent perennial bliss.<br>  <br>  Whatever the outcome, we may hope that after all our sincere daring or adventurous exertions we will be able to honestly say that we have been living our own life to the fullest, that we have tried to be astute and fierce, in the style of the proverbial good old fox, that we have done some things of which we may be proud, and that our failures, small or great, were inherent to our own life experiments, for gaining more experience and for doing better next time in a similar circumstance of our life or in a new unusual unpredicted circumstance in our world.

Not really anything to worry about.You need to deal with the fact that this GF may or may not be The One .Takes a Lot of Time to figure it out.Sit back relax ,,, and think about it. both of your positions in life as in age and all other things.Don't rush things . Could make a Mistake that way. O.K.? Cool!|`|C5PPgdRDaa	I think you are afraid of losing your GF. there might be something which you are not okay about your gf.seeing the same dream again means you are too much thinking about your gf interested in soneone else.|`|S5vUEJ9Kaa	Your Paranoid bout losing your GF.|`|QBlJj924aa	I think your paranoid.|`|PEz2YMeXaa	You don't trust your gf and subconsciously it's bothering you, that's why nothing happens when you're awake but when you go to sleep and your subconscious takes over you're having the same dream repeated.<br>  <br>  Lack of trust-- Typical in couples.|`|xezI4AlNaa	You dont trust your girlfriend.
gs2aPltGaa	First of all I am not trying to knock you down but maybe open your eyes to the way she is thinking. <br>  <br>  I use to be in an abusive relationship myself, which I only stayed for 3 months of the abuse before I picked up and left. When you are with someone for so long just the thought of leaving and being alone to face the world is scary enough, with or without that financial help. <br>  Abused women do not wake up and think : oh I think I am going to keep trying on knocking deaths door and hopefully he will answer me this time.: thats not how it works. There are things he may be feeding her to scare her into staying. an abuser is a manipulator as well. He could be telling her she wont last without him, or his money, that he will track her down and kill her if she left, or in my case he could also be saying that he will kill himself if she left (which my ex played the suicide card 4 times before I had him committed). these are all forms of abuse and she her first instinct is not to protect you or her friendship.. why she stays is to protect herself. although she thinks that staying is protecting herself (and anyone from the other side of the glass can say she is nuts for staying) she doesnt see that just by staying its not helping her.<br>  <br>  Sure you can offer your help but most women think.. :oh sure...for how long. for a month or two, can you be there for her financially? can you be there for her emotionally? and to be quite frank, I dont want to step on your toes... but Im not sure you are ready to help her... You are already telling her your friendship will be over if she stays with him.. Why would you abandon (or threaten to abandon) a supposed friend emotionally and physically? You arent helping my adding more mental problems to hers.<br>  <br>  When she is ready she will leave... as I did, as many did. She just needs to find the proper resources to help her.<br>  <br>  Instead of going down a road of ruined friendship, educate yourself with materials that will help her move on to the right road. Contact your local catholic charities. they have information on lawyers, shelters, rent aid, psychologists, and all the resources needed to help abused women break the ties and move forward safely. Shes not safe with him running around threatening her.<br>  <br>  and if anything...Do not abandon a friend. You may be the only person who can help her move forward.|`|EQQFisd8aa	Sorry about the situation at hand.<br>  Trying to help to me would mean, trying to get a solution that would best be for the both of them to live happily there after.<br>  <br>  Like they say, things of the heart are best left to the parties involved. <br>  Have you ever tried to find out why she wont leave? Most of us women are afraid of being on our own after have been in a relationship for some time. So basically i would suggest that you talk to her and get more details about their relationship before you move in to help.Because helping would be  alittle tricky if you don't have details or root cause of the problem.<br>  However, threats are not very good when mediating.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best dear|`|OsNV8ISwaa	i personally don't think you are selfish you are entitled to your own opinion as your friend is hers. all i can say it that until you have been in a situation like the one your friend is in then you can never fully understand that it is hard to hate someone that you love. while it is difficult for someone on the 'outside' to understand what keep the person in the relationship it is often that when the 'abuser' is being nice you cannot imagine your life without them. so you take the crap for want of a better word because without it you do not get the good.<br>  So i suppose all that i can say is that she has made her bed, if you feel like this has to be the end of your friendship then that is your choice but one day she will see him for what he is and when that day comes she is going to need all the support she can get.|`|S5vUEJ9Kaa	my advise: Take an Enneagram test on the net, know the meaning of your Zodiac, and also Carl Jung's test.

EQdsvEuKaa	if their priorities don't change, they won't change either. people get hooked on the past because they still dream of living the way they were before circumstances changed. it is necessary to accept and adapt to change but for some this is hard because they are so emotionally invested in the past, and have little expectation or hope for the future. <br>  <br>  you can help a person to move on by giving them new and better things to  focus on, help them see that there are things in the present and future that also require their attention. it is an immature thing to stay in the past when the situation around you is demanding change; ultimately, others around you end up taking on the responsibility.|`|AA11736670	Once they know that your still listening and haven't yet drained you of your own life.They want move on because they still have someone to listen.<br>  They sure want gain friends they will lose them and you sound like your ready to run?|`|Dk8AYLgKaa	It's because everyone has different personalities and different things might have happened to them. In some cases, problems might have really been caused by someone already dead. I know that I trust other people much less and have a problem working up a relationship of any kind with anyone cause I'm nervous around people. I don't blame my father for doing that, but he did change me in a way that can't be reversed. <br>  Some people just find it hard to forgive. I got over it.|`|jBZJkSjWaa	once these ppl learn how to forgive it'll all fall into place.....ur will is ur strongest weapon.. no matter how many times u loose or fall it is the will to try again that makes u a hero...and they have to look how far they've come in life and not at others....but as i said if u are positive the others will follow.. u know ppl tend to look upon others  so if they see that u are positive they'll copy from u..|`|C5PPgdRDaa	it is so becuz some people have problem in excepting the reality.they mostly think of the past and pay much more imp. to their past rather then their present. its indiviualistic and you can't force them to move on.

It is moving from a subsistence, agricultural based economy to a more manufacturing based one.  The western countries all made this move a hundred years ago (or more) and so have had that amount of time to grow to their current wealth.<br>  <br>  China will eventually catch up technologically and with their huge population will overtake the US in economic size but they are unlikely to have a higher GDP per capita as the US will continue to grow once the economy recovers from its present shambles.|`|7Ct2SSEuaa	That where you are mistaken! China is not a poor country, it has got many resources and is indeed developing very fast. Since you are talking about GDP per capita, I guess you must know that GDP per capita is obtained by taking GDP and then dividing it by population. <br>  <br>  What happens is that dividing GDP by 1.3 billion gives a smaller figure than dividing GDP by 300 million. I just hope that you are getting the picture but then you should also consider than fact that income distribution is not the same all across China. If China had a smaller population, its GDP per capita would have been much higher today!|`|6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	China is not as poor as you think, you are using exchange rates to compare and China currency is undervalued. To compare relative standard of living GDP PPP is a better measure  and that gives a per capita income of $6000 which is about where the US was in the 1940. However they are still poor compared to the Industrialized nations. They started to industrialize late because  of their political problem, and  they had a bad 20th century,  it started with a revolution  and then WWII followed by a civil war which resulted in a communist victory.  It is only in the last 30 year they have gotten their act together, and since then have  been growing rapidly.|`|LTfcpjBraa	It's not as poor as it seems, there are tons of rich people in China.

Its economy is growing rapidly in the face of the worldwide crashing economy whereas USA is suffering...You never know: China could surpass USA and get far ahead of it. <br>  The global economic crisis = a chance for China to "reverse" the situation, meaning it would no longer be 'poor'|`|Tx39ik9Yaa	Thats because China is still developing with huge population that expands faster than jobs created.|`|QdKgHtMfaa	They are rich in population so that means they will never go poor

D6FBLQfwaa	Great question! The answer is that they were actually FAR more accepting of variation then many societies around today. For example, the roman empire was full of black africans, semites, and germans, and they didn't view any of these variations as wrong. The Romans and the Greeks also felt no disgust for homosexuality, and the greeks actually promoted it! I hope that helps a little!
1ZXKxuh8aa	Well, basically, you're subconcious is getting cold feet.  It's very natural for these dreams to occur.  You'll have them right up to the day you take your vows or longer.  The only thing that controls whether they come true or not is you.  The real question isn't the dreams, it's whether you're happy with your partner.<br>  <br>  If you're unsure not about the wedding, but the relationship all together, then you should seek some form of partnership counseling.  Especially with a baby on the way (congrats by the way)  <br>  <br>  If all is good on the home front, and the feelings with your ex are just a nostalgic mindset, then you my dear are good to go.

You are not taking or accepting responsibility for your actions. In particular, if you are running from an attacker or any danger, then it suggests that you are not facing and confronting your fears.  <br>  <br>  To dream that you are trying to run but cannot make your feet move as fast as you want them to, signifies lack of self-esteem and self-confidence. It may also reflect your actual state of REM paralysis while in the dream state. <br>  <br>  To dream that you are running alone, signifies that you will advance to a higher position and surpass your friends in the race for wealth. Alternatively, you may be running from some situation or from temptation. Or it may also mean that you need to hurry up in making a decision. <br>  <br>  To dream that you are running with others, signifies festive and prosperous times. <br>  <br>  Marriage<br>  <br>  To see a marriage in your dream, signifies commitment, harmony or transitional period. You are undergoing an important developmental phase in your life.  The dream may also represent the unification of formerly separate or opposite aspects of yourself.  In particular, it is the union of masculine or feminine aspects of yourself. Consider the qualities and characteristics of the person that you are marrying. These are the qualities that you need to look at incorporating within yourself. <br>  <br>  To dream of a proposal of marriage, suggests that some situation will take a turn for the worse. <br>  <br>  To dream that you are getting married to your ex, suggests that you have accepted aspects of that relationship and learned from those past mistakes. Alternatively, it  means that a current relationship shares some commonality with your previous relationship with your ex. However, you will not make those same mistakes.  <br>  <br>  Wedding <br>  <br>  To see a wedding in your dream, symbolizes a new beginning or transition in your current life. They reflect your issues about commitment and independence. Alternatively, your wedding dream refers to feelings of bitterness, sorrow, or death. Such dreams are often negative and highlight some anxiety or fear. If you dream that the wedding goes wrong or ends in disaster, then it suggests that there is more negativity that needs to be dealt with. <br>  <br>  To dream that you are getting married to your current spouse again, represents your wedded bliss and happiness. It highlights your strong commitment to each other. It may also signify a new phase (such as parenthood) that you are entering in your life.  <br>  <br>  To dream that you are planning your own wedding to someone you never met, is a metaphor symbolizing the union of your masculine and feminine side. It represents a transitional phase where you are seeking some sort of balance between your aggressive side and emotional side. Two previously conflicting aspects are merging together as one. <br>  <br>  If you are getting married and have dreams of your pending wedding, then it highlights the stress of organizing a wedding.  Conflicts over wedding details, tension with family and in-laws, fear of commitment, and loss of independence may all cause wedding anxiety dreams.  Research has shown that up to 40% of brides and grooms have dreams about their ceremony and things going perfectly. <br>  <br>  Partner <br>  <br>  To see a partner in your dream, suggests that you need to seek the help of others in order to accomplish mutual goals. Alternatively, a partner symbolizes the duality of your personality. Also consider your waking relationship with your own partner. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|inST4SlAaa	i bet this is your first child<br>  <br>  the dream is all about fear worry over the pregnancy and delivery and the father keeping his end of taking care of the baby.  <br>  <br>  everything will be alright, this dream was about fear, not sadness|`|BmHzkztYaa	its nothing but your  fears or wishes , do what u feel or think better and take her also in confidence
ec55348158c3fd8764f5daba79c0af3daa	This is a pretty complex question and the answer is also fairly complex.<br>  <br>  When I was growing up the only computers in existence were those big old-fashioned kind that took up several buildings, so my escape was in other directions.  Where we lived we didn't get television until I was in my teens, and I went to the library or found other things to read.  I read newspapers, magazines, books, whatever I could get my hands on.<br>  <br>  Our exposure to different experiences is partly a reflection of our interests, but it also helps shape them as we mature and develop as people.  Reading is a wonderful activity--one I highly recommend.  You can absorb information and ideas so much more quickly through reading than you can through television or other means that the other activities don't even compare.<br>  <br>  Sports is an excellent activity for developing competitive spirit, physical skills, cooperation, etc.<br>  <br>  The classical definition of learning is "a change in behavior resulting from experience."  Much of that experience is gained while we are children or young adults.<br>  <br>  This is a very interesting question.  I don't think it can be answered even fractionally in a forum like this, however.  Everything you experience is part of who you are.  Everything affects you as a person.<br>  <br>  You can change your tastes--many of us do as we grow--but that usually comes when we either tire of doing this the same old way or are suddenly inspired by something new.<br>  <br>  Even your dreams affect your tastes--although it can also be said your tastes affect your dreams.<br>  <br>  For a 14-year-old, Katie, you are a very deep thinker.

xsyAljhaaa	It makes feminists look like complete hypocrites, liars, and vindictive, unscrupulous bigots, because they not only refuse to see that there is just as much discrimination and sexism against men, but also actively and frenetically oppress anyone who would even suggest that men are also victims of anything in any way. Feminists are generally very sexist and openly advocate discrimination against men.  They disseminate lies through the media to get oppressive, anti-male legislation passed that gives them police powers that no regular citizen should have -- the VAWA. <br>  <br>  What little discrimination and sexism there is against women is trivial, but the feminists stick to a hysterical, false communist ideology that results in discrimination and vilification of men. They paint themselves as eternal victims of a phantom, imaginary conspiracy of oppression while they have more rights than the supposed oppressors, but still shrilly scream and moan about how bad they have it. Because of this irrational, childish, selfish behavior no sane person can take what they say seriously.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	I think that there is a disparaging attitude towards women that still prevails today.  You only have to read some of the questions on this site to realise this.  Many of the comments and questions are flip windups, but at the same time, it would never occur to me to make such a derogatory comment about any person, male, female, black or white.<br>  I think it is going to take another 100 years before this attitude is done away with, where women are accepted totally as equals and we are all accepted as individuals, rather than as being classified as one of a certain gender.<br>  The respect is missing and there is a definite blame culture, where some men are starting to see themselves as victims.<br>  The resentment is very evident, but I suppose it always has been there.  Men throughout the ages have made disparaging comments about women and it continues to this day.|`|NV3eIjLcaa	I think there needs to be a determination and declaration of ability and value (when considering the two genders or comparison of any select group for that matter). For instance, is it discrimination to treat a cockroach worse than a hamster? How about giving a termite less consideration as opposed to a stray cat, being that both are simply bothersome animals?  I'd think that the common notion here would be that the 2nd animal in each circumstance is of more ability, 'civility' and ultimately able to garner greater empathy due to it being a more substantial and conspicuous creature.<br>  <br>  <br>  -- Now, what about 'giving' women the same rights as men? Well if we use the same logic we did above concerning the other comparisons, a contrast of women and men seems to show that men are simply of greater occupational value than women. Women however are the gender alone afforded the responsibility of gestation- however even with this it has been decided (by society itself) that women are not of equal value to men. Women are not considered of equal ability to men to a society, and therefore were often not given equal rights.  <br>  <br>   >>> Notice however, that if women are not considered of equal ability, can it be considered as "discrimination" if society doesn't feel them worthy of equal rights to men?  (Remember the logic used concerning the animal comparisons)|`|kxcDDMw9aa	I don't support any discrimination but more and more I am becoming apathetic towards women's problems. Feminism has always portrayed women as the lone victim of oppression. Nobody will admit that men have been oppressed and exploited by society just as much as women have. Feminism has also demonized men and supported the myth of female superiority. It has pressured governments to pass sexist legislation against males and turned people's issues into women's issues. it has denied the oppression of males entirely, trivialized the suffering of men and claims to fight for equality when it is no more than women's advocacy. <br>  <br>  I am apathetic now.|`|4s31OKf5aa	My opinion is that it's discrimination and naive to think that discrimination can only happen to a women.<br>  My opinion on sexism is that I don't think it should be tolerated on any level unless it is in good fun and EVERYONE is laughing, in fact that's also my opinion on racism too.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	My ex-husband is not college educated.

4N13iiFpaa	The simplest way to achieve conversational hypnosis is through storytelling. When a story is told, if the listener's attention is kept, the person begins to relive the experience as if it was their own. So, if you wanted to help someone with depression, make them a little happier, you should tell them a story with a strong feeling of happiness.<br>  <br>  Another thing that helps is to gradually switch to second person while talking, for example instead of saying "I went to the beach and had a great time and then I got an ice cream cone and was happy", you might want to say something more like "You know that feeling you get when you are so completely relaxed, like you're lying on a beach, and the you get up and get an ice cream cone and just feel so happy and relaxed right now". See what happened there, without being obvious you suggested that they felt relaxed and happy.<br>  <br>  I hope this post helped, and if you can afford it I would strongly recommend getting Igor Ledochowski's 12 CD set, "Power of Conversational Hypnosis", it truly is a fantastic resource.

I truly believe there are very few people that can honestly say they have absolutely no respect for themselves even when it may appear to others they don't.

There are also strong environmental and social influences, such as inconsistent parental discipline and low social status of the family. However, it appears that genetic influences are more founded on evidence, whereas environmental influences are less clearly defined. Nonetheless, it would be dangerous to assume that genetic influences alone can increase an individual's risk of developing an antisocial personality disorder, since this would disregard the nature-nurture argument of psychological behaviour. <br>  <br>  There are also neurobiological influences, and damage to the brain can cause antisocial personality disorder and criminality in some individuals.|`|9b97445bbe624f83afb38f68e510c6d6aa	b|`|PZGpFzTsaa	c

It also doesn't imply a responsibility/consent on a man's part to be the pooper-scooper for life.<br>  <br>  Edit : Of course, that isn't a secret.<br>  <br>  But I have to add that I neither agree with you saying 'I do' equates to perpetual sex nor with the Feminists who are quick to brand something as 'marital rape' just because the wife had a 'headache'.<br>  <br>  Capricorn : "Forcing yourself on your wife because she's not in the mood on a particular night is NOT okay." That's what I'm referring to. Raises a lot of questions. Are you one of those Feminists who tend to call men 'marital rapists' just because they wanted sex when she wasn't 'in the mood' because it was a full moon night? Can't mood be induced?<br>  <br>  Well, Capricorn, you can get back under your bridge as well. I thought I saw the other side of the discussion until your name-calling started. Let's just agree to differ.|`|AA11307468	I'm a single woman who has many married friends.  Not once have I heard of a single marital contract that states that the wife must have sex with her husband every time he's in the mood or vice versa.  No vows I've ever heard have indicated that either.  I would like to know where you get your distorted ideas from...|`|PwvU3LQBaa	Does that also mean that my husband has to give me sex anytime I want it?  If it does, then he is not fulfilling his duties to me.  I want it a lot more than he does. <br>  <br>  Also, I don't really care for shopping.  He does more shopping than I do and will spend a long time looking for clothes.  So if he is not fulfilling his duties, does that mean I don't have to haul around the shopping bags or sit in the store for an hour or 2?|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Pssh, my mom and I always shop by ourselves.<br>  <br>  In Canada, if a marriage is never consummated, it can be annulled. That does not mean that either spouse has the right to compel their partner to have sex with them. Both are allowed to turn each other down if they don't want to have sex that night.|`|oojO4WAraa	No.  Have you listened to the vows?  The woman is saying "I do" to the vows.  I have never heard a judge or preacher ask "Do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have sex endlessly when ever he wishes...."etc.|`|3ISGQ4Csaa	K, first off carrying shopping bags and having sex are two different things. If a woman doesn't want to have sex, and the husband makes her anyway then that is marital rape. Just because a woman gets married, that doesn't mean that she must have sex with him whenever he wants even if she just completely worn out, and a respectable, respectful and mature man would understand that! A wife is not her husband's sex slave!|`|gHxmYuGmaa	Continued or repeated refusal of sex in marriage can be grounds for divorce.|`|jf1f7vNxaa	HAHAHA<br>  <br>  you've clearly demonstrated the one-way street that is the modern American marriage.|`|x5MYW2LPaa	It's actually ' I will'|`|qLBsTaDlaa	I'm with Chizzy on this one.<br>  <br>  Why would you want to marry someone you wouldn't want have sex with?<br>  <br>  I heard sex helps with headaches!!|`|nJs0UBDraa	my god Jocelyn, wtf!!|`|BkleL3F4aa	saying no is illegal<br>  <br>  <br>  if you are a mexican man|`|IuP0ryOMaa	my husband doesnt give it up whenever I want it, so why should I return the favor??  And he doesnt even hold my shopping bags, heck he wont even go to the mall with me!!!  Are you saying that I am getting the shaft here??<br>  <br>  Edit ~~ I just wanted to ask, I am curious about this...but is this marital contract to bang your spouse whenever you want an imaginary one....because it wasnt in my vows (or his dammit) nor did we sign anything stating so, and if he is breaking his contract by not giving it up then dammit I will have resaon for divorce~!~<br>  <br>  I'm making him carry my shopping bags from now on...I have seen the light!!  Thanks to you...if he doesnt give it up then hes taking me shopping and going to carry all my bags.  Thanks a bunch  :)<br>  <br>  Edit~  I understand, he totally broke his end of the contract!!  I have been holding up my end.  So to be fair, I can sleep with his best friend...right??  Or should I be kind and just slap him with divorce papers?  Any advice will be helpful as this contract is all new to me.

We can also say to safeguard our interests.|`|HI0oQriqaa	to decide either to work for a living or depend on obama.|`|aHxHpT8qaa	I would have to say, survival would be the primary defense mechanism. It can play tricks to survive even painful situations (I am post surgical brain surg.) I have been able to survive the twenty four seven pain that I have been left with, I function sorta well, I'm able to survive the pain by playing games in my mind... No medications help.|`|Hz9xPds2aa	the mind is a reflection of sensory data, and then what we think about what we recieved. so we make conclusions and judgements. but the person weilding the mind (one's ability to reflect ) is not the mind, so the mind is not an entity by itself. Most of use believe ourselves to be the thinker, thus there is no distance to observe what one thinks, and when it's like this - we use our mind to primary get confirmation for our being alive as the thinker. So defense is to prove to ourselves we are right, we can see, we are smart, we are alive, etc. It's defensive because by getting this validation from outside world according to how we express ourselves and react, we then tend to keep our false-image of ourselves intact. <br>  <br>  as far as primary purpose for our ability to reflect, it serves for us to eventually be able to recognize ourselves as the creator of the reflecting abliity. Once we recognize ourselves as source, as that behind the mirror, then this starts the dissolving of the mirror, or what is known as the beginning of spirituality, growing in being, shrinking in personality. The mirroring or duality nature of mind is no longer needed, once one has seen and known oneself, thus one starts to make a new structure which is direct and doesn't need past-tense reflection and reaction. rather one gradually becomes spontaneous and direct in one's interactions in the world, as the mind changes....<br>  betsy|`|M3Xmqlt8aa	We may simply have retained a trait that was necessary for the effective function of the fright, fight, flight mechanism from a time in history when ordinary conflicting ideas resulted in more frequent and immediate violence.

The primary purpose would be people looking for a way out of pain and loss. It's purpose would be too avoid lack and poverty in any area but from what I read it would not solve the root problems.
un0C52G8aa	There need to be regulations on this. A lot of fertility clinics will implant multiple fertilized eggs into women to increase the odds of getting a successful pregnancy. The problem is that if they all successfully implant, that means babies that have to be delivered prematurely and they often are sickly and require very expensive medical care. The octuplets are unusual in that they were born relatively healthy and never required any assistance with breathing. Still, that doesn't make it right for the fertility clinic who treated that woman to have done what they did.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	No, I don't think the government should legislate how many babies a woman can have at one time, but rather that she shouldn't be able to purposefully conceive more than is SAFE at one time using technology. If she had become pregnant the natural way she would not have had 8 babies, of course. I understand IVF helps some women, and yes, it does cause multiples sometimes, but her doctor was irresponsible, she already had 6 and being pregnant with 8 is not safe for her or her babies.|`|2e41580c4f9ca26f64c21c7dcc27e33faa	"Feminists, do YOU think that the government should legislate how many babies a woman can have at one time ?"<br>  <br>       ALthough this is a situation I find extremely bizarre, no, the government should not be involved in the reproductive rights of any human being, male or female|`|dYa5AEwSaa	yes i think that we should of regulate the childs that born in around the world, because actually are many in the world, and is necesary a reform of that womens have only  two or three childrens, especially for the current overcrowding.|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	I don't think the government should have a say one way or the other...however, the government also should not provide financial assistance for women who voluntarily have more children than their financial situation allows for.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	Yes, but only when they can't pay for them themselves.<br>  <br>  If you are rich or wealthy parents then have at it.<br>  <br>  Other wise You should not have any.<br>  <br>  Why should everyone else pay for these kids.<br>  It is disgusting!|`|ftbIWNydaa	F.

This is for everybody<br>  for crying out loud..............................|`|jk0rAkEjaa	It has already been done in China.|`|c8tyG5z3aa	I think it should depend on your financial income. My mom was going to have five kids, but had two miscarriages and as of right now I have two sisters. We're financially stable, but with two more children it would be hard but we'd still get by. It depends on how the kids are raised, how many toys, clothes, etc things are bought for them and other things that aren't necessitates.<br>  <br>  Your question doesn't really specify if the amount of kids one should have should have a limit or the amount of kids one can take care of should have a limit. The government should not be able to force abortions onto women. (I'm pro-life here, but even if I was pro-choice I Still wouldn't want the government forcing me or anyone else to get an abortion). So regulating such a thing would be a very large hassle.<br>  <br>  As for the mom, I don't agree with her having 8 MORE kids on top of the ones she already had, but they are her children. No one even gave her a chance yet, which I do feel that she deserves. I have a feeling the kids are going to be taken away from her, but she should get off her *** and prove herself and get a job. A good paying job. Other than that there's no hope for her.|`|Mjl0X0SCaa	I do not think the government should regulate how many children a woman can have.  I do believe that there should be some type of regulation as to how many embryos are implanted at one time to ensure the healthiest outcome for the mother and the babies.  You want to have 14 kids, fine, but I don't think you should have 8, or even 6, at once.|`|KyocDVuZaa	They should go through the same procedures as rying to adopt a child if they want to have that many babies. Its inhumane to bring a baby in the world intentionally for self profit (like the octuplet babies im sure it was a publicity stunt) they should check there income and financial and physchiatric status before they let them do anything|`|ivejg4whaa	I honestly think that there should be a limit to how many babies a woman or couple can have based on their income, but how is there a way to control it without being inhumane?<br>  Tough subject.<br>  This recent case is disturbing to me. But the doctor is as much at fault as she is for condoning her psychotic behavior!|`|82FuhGKaaa	No the government should mind their own business. The woman should not be having more kids if she can't take care of the ones she already has, but she should decide how many kids she has, China's already doing that. Just think, if your parents decided not to have any kids, you wouldn't be here. And to "Chino Big" there is plenty of room in the world for more people, have you ever been out in the country?|`|Q5oBepLeaa	Yes because the ones that come out paying are the Tax Payers! <br>  <br>  i think there should be a law on how many kids a women can have, i also believe that they should do like a income check to make sure you will be able to afford it as well....why does the child have to suffer?|`|bXcmhRUOaa	I don't think government should be involved,  but I DO think that a medical ethics review of the doctor who did the in - vitro is called for.  This is an ethical question,  not a legal question.|`|h4TxVSp3aa	I think this woman should burn in hell, she cannot afford those children and had so many u cant even THINK of how much goverment tax money will be issued to her.

This is a population growth question for everyone.|`|VAsTZ6mYaa	That would effect peoples freedom though. If you start telling people how many children they have then how long will it be before Government tells you what and how your going to do your life?|`|QHI9HSiqaa	I very much think that the government should never, EVER be able to designate how many kids someone can have at one time.  How would they even enforce that?|`|NBDQRBvzaa	no i dont think so|`|F79SsXYpaa	I think a woman can have as many children as she wants as long as she is able to fully support them by herself ( whether she is married or not ) obviously, a single mother who is on food stamps and lives in a cluddered 3 bedroom house can not fully take care and nurture 14 children, but someone who is making enough money and lives in a big enough house with enough time that can, should be allowed to. however, there should be a law on how many embryos can be implanted. i think this octomom needs psych evaluation. those children deserve a good home and good parents and love and care. how on earth is a single mom who is too busy trying to become the next "Jon and Kate Plus 8" going to be able to provide that? i dont want to have to pay my hard earned money for her stupidness. good luck to you!|`|YQOT68xFaa	Nope. If I'm allowed to kill as many of my babies as I want - either through selective reduction or abortion - then I should also be allowed to birth as many as I want at once. <br>  <br>  I do think it's irresponsible to implant that many embryos at once, and it's even worse when a person does that and then abort most of 'em. I wish that clinics would implant no more than 3 at a time. It's so much healthier.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	The government should not take on a role like that; people should have the common sense not to have kids they can't afford. In the case of OctoMom, they should have sense, period.|`|AA10329269	I am NOT a feminist. But absolutely in no way should the government start regulating anything to do with the number of babies you have. The only way to enforce something like this is by forced sterilization or forced abortion....either of which are a little too Nazi-ish for my tastes.<br>  <br>  But there are some logical laws the government can make - and they have to do with the doctor. Right now there are no laws restricting the number of embryos a doctor can implant. Right now the "guideline" in 2, but it's obviously not followed by all doctors.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Not really.  I think that if a woman is struggling with 6 kids and wants six more, the doctor needs to use discretion and say no.  <br>  <br>  But, in reality, we can't tell someone how many kids to have.  We can limit the amount of publicity they get, though.<br>  <br>  Boozy: "Feminists embarrass women, thanks to them I have to work."<br>  <br>  Are feminists depending on you to pay their light bills?  Are they depending on you to feed them?  Keep yourself at home then.  Your coworkers probably hate you anyway.|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	No, not the government. <br>  <br>  But a professional with as much education as a doctor ought to display some sensibility when a patient makes such a high risk request.  There is such a thing as professional ethics.|`|oojO4WAraa	There should be laws and regulations on how many embryos can be implanted.

You can have confidence in yourself but not flaunt it in others people faces. Especially if you're actually not that brilliant and you just don't know it so you look like a twat.

S0n3DinFaa	Marine archaeology is also known as maritime, underwater and nautical archaeology. Each terminology has specific meaning and purpose in which water plays a dominant role. In India it is known as marine archaeology. In maritime or underwater archaeology we study the past activities of human from maritime finds, usually from shipwrecks, sunken ports and settlements. Nautical archaeology is studied and explained as maritime archaeology, specializing in maritime activities and technology of ships, boats and other crafts. Marine archaeology is primarily concerned with exploration, investigation, documentation and recovery of the material remains and physical traces of human activities found on the foreshore and intertidal zones and on the seabed. Over the years the National Institute of Oceanography has undertaken the exploration and excavation of submerged ports and shipwrecks in Indian waters. The paper highlight the sources, findings and the progress made in India in the field of marine archaeology since its inception in India.|`|BLTo4xL9aa	Maritime archaeology (also known as marine archaeology) is a discipline that studies human interaction with the sea, lakes and rivers through the study of vessels, shore side facilities, cargoes, human remains and submerged landscapes. One speciality is underwater archaeology, which studies the past through any submerged remains. Another specialty within maritime archaeology is nautical archaeology, which studies vessel construction and use.<br>  <br>  <br>  Archaeological material in the sea or in other underwater environments is typically subject to different factors than artifacts on land. However, as with land archaeology what survives to be investigated by modern archaeologists is a tiny fraction of the material originally deposited. The issue in maritime archaeology is that despite all the material that is lost, there are occasional rare examples of substantial survival, from which a great deal can be learned.<br>  <br>  There are those in the archaeology community who see maritime archaeology as a segregrated discipline with its own concerns (such as shipwrecks) and requiring the specialised skills of the underwater archaeologist. Others value an integrated approach, stressing that nautical activity has economic and social links to communities on land.

When is underage unacceptable?|`|m89kGXBnaa	It depends. In some cases, she is not, but the man is still breaking the law and if he knows this (knows she is under 16 in the UK, 18 in other places) he is still liable.<br>  <br>  At 15, we consider people not old enough to make fully informed decisions. Several may be. Several may not. If they are not, they can be influenced into doing things without fully understanding them, or the possible consequences. Hence a victem. Similarly, we don't allow them to drink or smoke although we will a year/three years later.<br>  <br>  If the man is much older, it is considered much worse, as they have greater apparent authority, ability to influence. When I was at school, it was generally known certain 15 year olds were sleeping with older guys (occasionally girls) but nothing was really done because it was recognised these girls (and boys) had the ability to make that decision, had even chased it.

I was not psychologically a "child". I just wasn't. I had a very dark outlook on humanity. I contemplated spiritual issues. Legally, I was a "child" but in many other senses I was terribly precocious. In the Renaissance women were married off at 13 to men in their 40's. That is shocking to us now, but women were satisfied by it then. It wasn't paedophilia. Alot of younger teens, lets face it, are still very immature. But alot aren't and make clear and lucid decisions. Even in those 15 years they absorb and inculcate the messages and wisdoms in society so we shouldn't underestimate them.

(but I can't blame her for thinking that way, cause i've thought of it)<br>  When she's 18 and she sleeps with him again, then it's fine because she's practically an adult.<br>  It all depends on what state/country she's in.<br>  It's different.<br>  She may need a parents consent as well if she's a minor and having relations with an older man.|`|wjtSQxKIaa	Legally, yes. The law is written under the assumption that a 15 year old doesn't have the mental capacity to make that decision. <br>  <br>  A 15 year old can't enter into most legally binding contracts for that same reason. <br>  <br>  And the law you speak of is applicable to both boys and girls under the age of 18. Although from state to state the age can vary. In NY a 17 year old can have sex with someone up to four years older then him/herself.|`|AA11782843	Under US laws, she would be considered a victim as it falls under the statutory rape laws.  Its strange, because in most of Europe and Canada, the age of consent is 15 or 16.  Now, there may be some 16 yr old who may not have the maturity to deal with a guy 3 years older..but some would.  I think it depends on the age gap and if it obviously consensual.|`|htcfyWblaa	If the "15 year old girl" is ready for sex and she really cares for the guy why does it matter. Maybe that person regardless of age is right for her. Age is a limitation and It shouldn't be. I'm not saying 15 year olds should sleep with a 76 year old. I just think that if she has consent and isn't mentally handicapped, it is fine.  Being 18, only means college, and a real driving license|`|1xDtS8wwaa	That depends where you are and how it's legally defined in your area.|`|7vk4xoKZaa	Legally yes she is a victim. If she makes the choice to be then she can be. She can be a victim because she is under 18 and I take it the man is not? When she is 18 she can still fight to be a victim if she wants but when they are over 18 they become an adult and make their own choices.|`|HNAdM1hSaa	I think that legally, she is indeed a victim as she is not an adult; and therefore, she does not possess the mature mentality of a consenting adult.  If three years later, at the age of 18, she sleeps with the man again, she is no longer perceived as a victim in the eyes of the law; however, that does not mean it is not part of the ramifications resulted  directly from her "underage" relationship.    =P
8d8ejHPfaa	Hi Maude+Me, how are you sleeping at night?  Are you getting enough sleep at night, or dealing with insomnia?  When someone is sleep deprived, they can start to dream during the day.  If you are getting enough quality sleep at night, then maybe you should get a good check up, and tell the doctor about it, these hallucinations could signal an underlying health problem or chemical imbalance, have you mentioned it to your parents?  If you're screaming in the middle of class, I'm surprised your teacher hasn't taken it up with them, have you discussed it with your teacher?  If a check up doesn't reveal an underlying health problem the doctor may need to refer you to a sleep lab for more study of it, it could be a sleep disorder such as narcolepsy or something where you fall asleep during the day....  If there is a lot of stress going on at home or school, you may be checking out in order to cope with it, you should explain to the doctor if there is much stress as well...<br>  <br>  On your additional details, yes that information helps, if this stuff started right after your horse died, the grief could be causing you to check out in order to cope with it.  Many people downplay the role of companion animals in our lives, there are many who don't understand when somebody grieves the passing of a companion animal, sometimes it's hard to find some sympathy about things like that, but for many people our companion animals are members of the family, close friends, and thier passing affects us just as much as a human death, sometimes even more so.  If you are having trouble coping with grief from the passing of your horse, then consider asking your parents to take you to a therapist to talk about depression, and get some treatment for that....In sympathy, beatlefan|`|AA10740859	Don't know how old you are, but it sounds like you are letting yourself fall into a trance like state and something from your subconscious emerges.

It's when you want to have sex with someone, and that's often as far as it goes. It is similar to "falling in love" with someone.

Love is when your lives become so tangled together that it would be impossible to continue with yours without them alongside you.<br>  <br>  You can be in love with someone without knowing everything about them, but you cannot love them because if you did then you wouldn't actually love them rather you would love the person you know as them who may not be the real them if you don't know everything about them.|`|atDbSj5Saa	I'd say you have a point with getting to know the person.

DaokQBKhaa	Nothing wrong with being smart. However, when people are calling your *** smart it's not so good.

b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	In the US the laws are some what unified although not exact.  <br>  <br>  If a single mother wishes to place a child for adoption then they must try to notify the father and get his consent.    This can be done by advertisement if his name is not known or direct contact if he is known.   If he objects there will be a court hearing to determine if his rights will be terminated by the court.  Some things the court will consider - whether he abandoned the mother during the pregnancy, whether he paid any support, his criminal history, his relationship with his other children and if he has consistently supported them.   <br>  <br>  Men who wish to be part of their children's lives are supposed to sign into a putative fathers registry if they suspect a pregnancy.   <br>  <br>  Juvenile/family courts can terminate either parents rights for abuse or neglect.|`|p0LsYvJTaa	In the U.S., if the father is identified on the birth certificate and signs off on it (if the couple are not married), the mother cannot sign a child off to adoption without his consent.

zym14EeJaa	Well first of all you need to know that your not to blame for any of this and your a great, loyal person. At them moment your life seems to be in a bit of a mess, but all messes can be cleaned up. I think with your first problem in relation to your sister in law is to give her some time, she may be experiencing post natal depression she seems to be taking her anger out on your brother on your whole family which is not fair. When she realizes she made a mistake cutting you out of her life she will come back. Her mother also seems of unsound nature and certainly not a role model for a child. So the best thing to do is give her maybe 2-3 months and instead of calling her, drive down with a gift for the child, and tell her that you miss her company and even though things with your brother and her didn't work out well you would like to still remain friends with her and also you would like to see you nephew. The next thing to do is confront your husband that you feel sad and lonely and if he still doesn't seem to care, there is no point in being with him. In relation to your job you can always re-apply for another job or take time out choose a new career path. Life is like a bouncing ball when it hits the grounds and gets as low as it can the only way it will go will be back up. Thing will improve, your not alone, you never will be. Its time to look at your life and re-evaluate it, think what is important to you and what isn't then focus on the important aspects and forget about the rest, good luck with everything:) It will all work out. Stay strong!
6IXrgxqSaa	The cause behind this type of behavior you see in people is our ever growing egoism. Egoism is our inner intention of acting and relating towards others only for self benefit. Man is ready and willing to exploit/use everyone for the sake of his own personal gain. Our egoistic aspirations to enjoy at another's expense and to rise above everyone is so bad we prefer to see others down in the dirt cause it makes us feel superior to them. Its like if we don't see how we can get any personal gain out of someone to us they don't exist or might as well disappear. Our egoism seemingly gives us all the justifiable reason to hate one another cause in a person's mind's another persons good is not good because it doesn't him or her.<br>  <br>  This has a negative effect because all of humanity is connected and dependent of one another like one global family. One global village. On the hand every day we realize how connected we all are in economy, culture, science and education and every other realm. On the other hand, our egos have grown to the point that we cannot stand other people. Our negative egoistic connections with others damages society and ourselves as well being that we are included within society, even though at this time we still don't recognize it. It is our egoism in humanity that brings  us all the troubles/suffering felt in our lives which includes the growing global crisis in the world today.

Ny5FYSvEaa	I think the problem would be worse on the gold standard.<br>  <br>  The gold standard only prevents inflation because the Fed would be willing to exchange a certain amount of money for a certain amount of gold. But people can still expect money to lose value, and if they did, they would all go to the Fed and get gold instead. The Fed would run out of gold reserves and then the whole system would crash.<br>  <br>  The gold standard does not require any less economic management, just in different forms. It originally failed because it required free movement of gold between countries, so it could go where it was needed, which stopped happening. With the current situation, I think countries with gold pegs would be even less willing to trade their gold to another country.|`|SjTAVdcKaa	I'm just starting to research this and I'm starting to think the answer is yes.

I don't care what the gender is of the abuser or victim, sexual abuse and rape are reprehensible. Thanks for asking another positive question about feminists. You might be surprised just who doesn't care if women are preying on young men.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I think it's a general attitude.  People feel that men/boys cannot be raped (false), so they assume that the man must've been interested at the time.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I think that any rapist, especially when they are abusing a position of power, should be shot.  I think it's sick for a teacher to go after a student, or a boss to go after an employee, or anyone to go after anyone sexually.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I bet it was Twiglets that gave me the TD...<br>  <br>  Oi, Twiglets, get a life, lighten up, and proudly accept the Thumbs Down I gave you.|`|AA12022384	The judicial system is more lenient on women rapists than on men. Female rapists are usually seen as less culpable than male rapists by the courts due to female on male rape being widely, but incorrectly, considered impossible.  This misconception is believed by society in general.  Therefore it is not surprising that feminists hold the same opinion as the rest of society.<br>  <br>  The need is to convince society as a whole that female on male rape is a reality, just as damaging and should be dealt with in the same way as male on female rape.<br>  <br>  By making your question suggest that it is only feminists who consider female on male rape is less serious and consider the penalties should be more lenient you divert attention from the fact that any group of people, however they were chosen would have the same opinion. <br>  <br>  If you are seriously concerned about men who are raped, then you should realise that the vast majority of men who are raped around 86% are raped by other men.<br>  <br>  You talk about rape then give an example using the word seduction, these are two different things.<br>  <br>  To turn this into a feminist issue detracts from the horrors of the crime for the victims of both sexes, it makes your question look like another cheap attempt to do a bit of feminist bashing.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	They claim not to be, yet we have seen feminist authors writing their articles in tabloids & broadsheets alike, excusing female paedophiles saying they are "misguided, searching for love" etc. while their next article condemns a man just for looking at a girl of 15 who looks 19.<br>  <br>  Incredible - but predictable.<br>  <br>  <br>  ETA, Zindzi - no I hadn't given you a T/D, however, given your crappy attitude and predictable 'blame a man' syndrome - you've just earned a T/D from me now.|`|p0LsYvJTaa	Personally, I am equally appalled by both crimes. We need to get society to let go of this idea that a 15-year-old girl abused by a 35-year-old teacher is a victim (which she is) but a 15-year-old boy and a 35-year-old teacher is "lucky" (nudge, nudge, wink, wink). Both the girl and the boy are victims.|`|pYimIJAWaa	What a strange idea - what would make you think such a thing? You obviously don't know much about feminism.|`|NmQCYizTaa	I think they should act more or less equally for the both of them. I say more or less, because with a man sleeping with a girl, there is more likely to be physical harm done to her - e.g. torn hymen, a lot of pain if she's tensed up, and she also has a chance of getting pregnant. Whereas for a boy being seduced by a woman, he had to be just that, seduced. Full intercourse isn't possible (unless she penetrates him anally) unless he is sustainably erect, which implies some amount of sexual excitement (I'm not a guy so correct me if I'm wrong here.) Of course, any sexual contact with a minor by an older woman is still wrong, but the physical consequences for a girl can be (are not always but can be) worse.<br>  <br>  Edit: I am assuming you mean non-consensual sex. Consensual sex I think, with a 15yr old, isnt really wrong as such for either gender (I don't think someone should go to prison for consensual sex with a person 1yr off legality,) but certainly questionable as to why the 35yo wants to have sex with someone so much younger.|`|c48xLEolaa	It's ridiculous. People always say, "Oh, a 15-year-old boy would love to have sex with his teacher", as if there are no 15-year-old girls who have the same fantasy.

I would have loved to bang a good looking women for as long as I remember starting when I was a child like most men would. We don't feel like victims when this happens, women do.

xuwJ6Vn3aa	Your anger symtoms i can def. relate. sometimes i feel powerless if my mother tries to make me do something or control me and i seriously imagine punching her in the face! If theres nothing to eat i get pissed off, especially when im hungery BUT i dont have those urges to stab someone because of it (sometimes i do with my brother...but thats another story) . I think you may have a problem. I mean ppl PMS and get angry and stuff but not ALL the time and it doesn't happen for a peroid of 5 months all of a sudden. Call your docter or talk to a phsycologist. and remember try to just leave the room when you feel like that and EXPLODE somewhere else! That will help you to control your anger.

bOaqWNxRaa	I understand what you mean. But someone who is truly sociopathic probably would not have such self awareness. <br>  <br>  Most people are generally motivated by their own selfishness. I mean no disrespect, but can you honestly say you're different from them in that way?<br>  <br>  I admit it- I am selfish. I am lazy. I am stubborn. I am the furthest creature from perfection imaginable or conceivable. I think that we sometimes find habits in others that we also resent about ourselves. <br>  <br>  There is still good left in the world and in society- but mark my words, dear brother- you have to look for it. If you continue looking for the negative, that is what you will discover. And I assure you, whatever you search for, good, bad, or indifferent, it will be there. <br>  <br>  I think it's just human nature to be selfish. It is perhaps instinctive, and goes along with self preservation. Some selfishness is necessary, and is even a good thing. But then, some people are just greedy, and I frown upon that. People that are stingy and miserly and refuse to help their fellow man and woman repel me. But you know what, I don't always do the right thing, either. I am no saint. But I believe that we should walk in love, like Jesus himself. We'll never reach the point of impeccability that Jesus is and has, but we should strive to become sacred.<br>  <br>  What we lack in this modern world is not passion, but compassion.|`|gViGPF0Faa	A lot of people are downright rude and disgusting. But there are people out there that feel the same way you do. It is hard when everything people do and say is stupid and annoying, but you can't do anything about. Just live your life, and you will find your own group of people who absolutely feel the same way.|`|XYBHM8aSaa	I feel that way sometimes, too.  Sometime I'm more ok with someone being rude or careless because it seems less fake. <br>  <br>  When I do meet anyone who is genuinely nice outside of my circle, I am really surprised that there are nice people left.|`|4XM9MAhMaa	Yes, I feel this way all the time...want to IM?<br>  <br>  T.T<br>  <br>  Dude, I'm really sorry...just look for hope though, there are others out there who really do care..|`|OUWTvtVVaa	Sometimes the little things could annoy me but sometimes they don't. If I am under pressure or expecting something, I would be more picky.  The other time I always assume that there would be someone else taking care the mess, so I don't have to pay attention to them, unless that's my duty. A clerk would smile, say please and thank you, that's the professional attitude. I know they are fake but they make people feel more comfortable, better than someone pick up a phone and said" What? not here"Hang up.<br>  Your feelings are normal, but if you feel frustrate all the time because those things that I think it's not normal|`|0927731821194fa8f6322a8fb8b4928daa	Exactly.<br>  <br>  This is how humans work.<br>  <br>  We put on a false face to get things - from the obviously fake thank yous to the not so obvious fakes.|`|euQFQzc5aa	Theres a little more to being a sociopath than what you are describing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yeah the world sucks...as do most people.

pYimIJAWaa	Please say you're kidding...<br>  <br>  Reasonable human beings (not just feminists) think it is rape when a man forces himself on a woman (and vice versa). <br>  <br>  btw. why should it matter if their married or not?|`|oojO4WAraa	"against her will" should be a clue.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Because a big part of marriage (besides sex, people) is RESPECT.  If your wife is like, "I'm really not in the mood tonight", piss off and leave her alone.  Surely you can go without sex for a night.  There's no law saying that you have to have sex on command.<br>  <br>  <br>  If, however, she's refusing sex constantly, you need to go to a marriage or sex counselor and figure out the problem.  Or shower more often.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	Actually it isn't just feminists who are against rape, it's any man or woman who isn't a complete psychopath.<br>  <br>  To those people who think a married man is entitled to sex when ever he wants, how to you feel about violent men who force sex on their wives after beating them, or forcing sex on them in front of their children? It happens. So you think this is ok????|`|3ISGQ4Csaa	Because "against her will" is rape, and why would a loving husband want to rape his wife? And i do agree that if the woman never has sex with her husband, the marriage was never consumated and therefore is grounds for divorce. But why would anyone get married if they weren't going to have sex with their spouse at all? What's the point?|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	Because its not feminists who say so its society.  Marriage does not mean you own her and she does not have the right to be left alone.   "Not today" does not mean never.  Why would a 'man' want to force himself on someone......|`|XnEnelsBaa	Rape is Rape! Just because you have a marriage certificate doesn't change that? <br>  <br>  Our sexual lives can be a lot more complicated than I suggest. I exclude any kind of consensual sexual role play or BDSM activity. Rape is an assault, a crime of sexual intercourse with or sexual penetration of another person without that person's consent. <br>  <br>  I am conditioned by my western upbringing in my answer. I must accept that other cultures, may have a different viewpoint.|`|bEQe1bNmaa	Ok, imagine if a big hairy biker dude came up to you and, ahem, "imposed his body" against yours because "he wanted physical love" I suppose you would be cool with that?|`|qLBsTaDlaa	Ask any at least halfway sane man (and many insane ones) they are gonna say forcing themselves on a woman is disgusting.|`|IuP0ryOMaa	feminists dont say that....the law does.
BkatcMZbaa	Dreaming is not your choice. It comes in when your are asleep and not everyone has dream.   Dream in the night is not the same as dream in the day and DAY DREAMING is out.

If you said dead tree's, that would mean that you'd need a noun after that to show that the dead tree has a possession. I don't think that's what you mean.<br>  <br>  The person is either interested in botany or being a poser.|`|RBQrgByeaa	Kind of cliche.

4c03ca2af0670791eae96802dcc67d06aa	This dream is telling me that, though you've never really kissed anyone before, perhaps you'd like to...or there may be something else that you're wanting to do and because of the situation of your friends being on your mind, this situation came to mind in your dream of confronting your desires.  Also, the fact that it was disgusting at first could be your subconscious battling over whether or not you should try whatever it is you're wanting to do.  There's the part that says it may be dangerous or disgusting or something to that effect, but then there's the part of you that says that if you just go through with it then you will find that it's not so bad after all, and you may even be happy with your choice.  A lot of times, rather than actually portraying what it is that you're dealing with, your subconscious uses symbolism to relay the underlying meaning because it may be hard for you to acknowledge exactly what it is that's bothering you.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Good luck and God bless.

Like i have to cry once in a while to function in life. Its natural and shows you're not cold hearted. <br>  I think the best way to stop yourself from crying in a certain situation is to take a deep beathe or 2 concentrate on a funny occurance you've had. then when you get home have a good cry about it all.|`|seKgoU4maa	Just let em out.

RBQrgByeaa	Yeah. Especially in a social setting, how people act. Or criminal behavior -- how does someone turn bad? Marriage fascinates me, too. What's loyalty? Love? What's cheating, what's not? <br>  <br>  Half of my M&D questions have to do with the ethics/morality of borderline risque behavior. I love the responses to questions about playing Twister with hot neighbors, etc. What are the boundaries?

And why some people wear the most amusing/amazing outfits in public.  lol|`|oB5aKIOOaa	Every person is a mini-psychologists, constantly assessing and forming opinions about others that come into our lives. What fascinates me the most is the biases that we carry into the interpretation of human behavior. Often times when I'm people watching  I recognize that what I may be interpreting as introversion or extroversion is merely my perspective that may or may not be true. Even when I begin to form a standardized opinion of a certain group of people there is always that one person who just refuses to fit into that mold. <br>  <br>  I'd say that behavior fascinates me more than others, but that would probably be why i'm working on my doctorate in psychology. =D|`|m89kGXBnaa	More human thinking.

Its completely normal and they can help as long as they dont just resort to prozac.<br>  Personally, whenever im at a massive low point i walk out into the countryside alone and spend some time with nature and think stuff over.<br>  Exercise and a healthy diet also do wonders for your depression.<br>  <br>  Good luck i hope you can get back to normal life soon!!|`|lDXh0jRVaa	Until you're feeling awful enough to tell your mom and get professional help you're going to be stuck in this boat.

It is also the hardest too.  I've talked to couselors in the past and it doesn't help right away, but takes time and will help you in the long run.  It's always better to get help from someone you don't know (which would be professional help).  You can get professional help through your parents' health insurance usually.|`|AA10501503	You NEED to talk to someone.  It is basically the ONLY way to get help because you are just ruining yourself this way.  Don't change  who you are, get help.  Professional help can make life worth living.  Chances are good that your parents, if they love you and treat you decently, want to know what's going on.  Tell them.  You don't have to tell them everything, but tell them something, enough to get help.  Or go to a school counselor.  In most states, you are of the legal age where you no longer have to release info on what you say in therapy or even that you are seeing your school counselor.  The only way that info would be shared with you parents is through the insurance and that would only be if you are paying for therapy and doing it through the insurance.  Try if you can to get to talk to the school counselor or psychologist/psychiatrist.  You can't keep living this way...you need to live and live well, not just survive.<br>  <br>  If you can get on medication, make sure and also go to therapy while you are on it...meds alone don't work well, they can work, but therapy and meds are the best combo.  Most people (above 70%) of those who do both therapy and meds lead very happy lives and can manage their depression much better than those who only do therapy or only do counseling.  But getting into counseling can help you through this.  high school and college are the roughest years...getting through them is hard, but their is a sun on the other side.|`|n9KeHcFkaa	forget professional help you need Jesus and tht wasn't supposed to be funny i'm going to pray for you and the best advice i can give you is just be you being something your not is not attractive.

ptWHIVjZaa	When you wake up, lie in bed for an extra two minutes or so and just try to mull over the dream.  Consider what you were feeling, who was in it, etc.  Think through it, if you think about it while you're awake, you're more likely to remember it.  Write about it, even if only a word or two on a post-it before you do anything.  It's easiest to remember what dream you were having when you first wake up, try to work backwards and what dreams you had earlier in the night.  Write down EVERYTHING you remember, don't skip it because you think it's weird or it doesn't matter.  Soon, it'll be easier for you to remember what you dreamt.|`|XkxD2zIuaa	I started remembering my dreams more often and in more detail just by consentrating on the dreams just as i wake up. If you wake up and get straight out of bed to do something you usually forget your dreams. A dream journal helped me alot also, so when you start remembering the dreams write them down. This way you can spot similarities in your dreams and you go lucid more often. If you're really into lucid dreaming and want to learn more I suggest you get this product: <a href="http://saltcube.com/?hop=95279" rel="nofollow">http://saltcube.com/?hop=95279</a><br>  It's gonna cost you some money but for me it was totally worth it.

When he fell asleep and became relaxed enough, his hand would relax and he would let go of the spoon, and the spoon would hit the plate, causing him to wake up. He would then record his dreams so that he could paint them.<br>  I have absolutely no idea if this actually works or not, I'm not sure how comfortable it would be, but if it worked for Dali...

45d774f93cd8fa9f498a7d7487bd0caaaa	For the little that I know, Raymond A. Moody Jr. and Stanislav Grof report a lot of such out of body possibilities. Such experiences are still quite subjective in our time, in the sense that only those people who get them really know how they are, what they are about.<br>  <br>  Thus we may put ourselves in a position of expectant wonder about it. We may treasure those descriptions and perhaps be able to compare them with some experience of our own. But many people who listen to such out of body reports react skeptically.<br>  <br>  I would rather say that we may feel or sense that there is quite much in our own inner and outer world that we cannot directly perceive, or that we cannot convincingly share with others.<br>  <br>  Not yet.

jSPj3S6faa	Honestly?  More people suffer from clinical depression than can be believed.  This is what your symptoms sound like to me.  Please see either a medical doctor or a mental health counselor as soon as possible.  Symptoms that you describe are recognized nowadays as legitimate problems and are treatable.<br>  <br>  The hard part is just getting started on such a path to recovery.<br>  <br>  Having clinical depression is not a weakness; it is a physical illness as much as cancer is.  You cannot be expected to walk it off or snap out of it.  Those who respond in that way are sadly ignorant.<br>  <br>  I am completely serious about this; I have lived it and have enjoyed life later due to proper treatment by real professionals.<br>  <br>  Please go do this now.
EFOP8Lxdaa	Kinda... there is this old cemetery near my house and I'll walk through it sometimes... I like to wonder about the people who lived, what there life was like, and what they died from... I look at some of the graves (some from the 1800s) and some kids died at 10... it's so sad. But peaceful at the same time....|`|h2Ueeu1naa	i do. it's kinda interesting. i wonder what their lives were like, & how they died.|`|233bbb5ff35324aa581bb39605c0d28daa	yes i love them|`|gDEFlWnOaa	I definitely understand what you're saying. They're extremely peaceful; occasionally I would go and tend to graves that were neglected. I always did wonder as to the person's story.
dFHsAXDMaa	In 5 Years time I hope to have watched my oldest daughter who is going to Northeastern in the fall for premed graduate and go on to med school. I will see my daughter who is going to be a senior in two years graduate and find her dream in life and be reaching to achieve it. my 14 year old will graduate from High school and go on to college in a career choice of his own. And finally, I will watch my youngest enter high school and go to his football games every friday night and his basketball and baseball games to...he is my little jock.  my goal is to continue being a nurse for terminally ill cancer patients until someone finally finds a cure for this devastating disease... and continue loving my children husband and family. all while enjoying life|`|AA11569882	I'll be 25...

4c03ca2af0670791eae96802dcc67d06aa	It sounds like your subconscious is contemplating spending time in a scary place without much security.  Does that sound like something that is currently going on in your life...or perhaps something that is shortly to come?<br>  <br>  Black cats are primary symbols of back luck and misfortune.  The fact that the cat bites you indicates a direct attack on you.  The missing window is a breach of security, which leaves you vulnerable to outside forces.  The restless dogs indicate something or someone trying to warn you of the danger to come.    The annoyance in the dream indicates, predictably, your frustration at being so vulnerable.  You get out of bed and look around the house, which shows that you are trying to perceive every aspect of what is happening, trying to figure out what is happening and how to either stop it or even prevent it from happening.  That's when you find the missing window, which completely subjects you to the outside world (or whatever it is that you fear, either subconsciously or otherwise) and scares you into waking up.  If you have the dream again, try to finish it to see what the outcome is.  If you cannot, then take it as a sign that the ending is unknown, as it is whatever you make of it.  Try to make the connection between these scenarios and the events in your life.  Only then will you know what to do.  Try not to worry so much.  These dreams are almost always sprung from fear.|`|kZT828wJaa	It probably wasn't installed properly as construction codes in dreamland are fairly relaxed. It no doubt fell and hit that black cat which was wandering about causing bad luck in peoples nightmares, but your window hit it, and it wandered upstairs and bit you in retaliation for the pain of being hit by the window. It all makes sense to me.
sGvEU9j8aa	This seems like a REALLY REALLY difficult situation.<br>  He is with another girl, so what can you do, you dont want to tear them from each other, no one wants to be a home wrecker, but you cant help how you feel either.<br>  Give it time, if he really does have feels for you, it will show sooner or later, and he will come to you, i mean how long can you really hide your feelings before it just comes out....i know from experience,  icouldnt hide the way i felt about my ex.<br>  Anyway, it seems to me, that he either 1) is like that to alot of people, some people are just naturally friendly you know? and it comes off as the wrong way.<br>  2) He is not fully committed to her, and he has feelings for you, and when he met you, he sensed the chemistry as well...<br>  if this is the case, your feelings can only blossom...<br>  <br>  either way, if you think its love, and really worth sticking it out, go ahead...i cant argue with you there, because love is an amazing feeling...especially what you are describing.<br>  When i read it, it was as if i could feel everything you were explaining again.<br>  I know the feeling when you look into his eyes, and itslike nothing else matters, and from the very beginning there was a connection that was undeniable....and when you kiss him, the world literally collapses, and when he holds you in his arms, you just feel so safe, you never want to leave, and just stay there forever. Stay there lost in his eyes, lost in the moment forever....<br>  That is worth fighting for...every bit.|`|4XM9MAhMaa	1) He could be a Player.<br>  2) Baby Daddy's need to stay with their baby mama's...sorry.<br>  3) If I were you (and I like you), I would stay out of the drama...but if you REALLY feel there's a connection, maybe ask if he were to get a DNA test and see if you could go out sometime? I dont know...I feel like that's bad advice. But the last thing you want to happen is to find yourself in the situation of consoling him (if they get in a fight) and you and his "chemistry" cause you to go further with him...ending up with both you and the girlfriend prego, and he leaves....and discovering that way that he is a player.|`|585b7dfd77e867b2877fe507e55eb149aa	Well, you've only known him one day. You don't really know if he's telling you the truth about the girlfriend or if he even lied about saying it might not be his baby. Guys lie all the time about babies. So I would only consider him a friend or you might just end up in one great big mess. You might not even like him after you get to know him a little bit better. He just might be a player. Good luck.|`|TO4bRflyaa	Love is so complex at times, isn't it? Here you are with a colleague who seems destined to be your man, but there is so much confusion to be cleared before anything positive happens.<br>  <br>  Your friend already has a girl he loves. And she is pregnant. His girl needs a lot of emotional support at this stage and he will commit himself to her. So we can safely say that the next 7-8 months will be dedicated to her.<br>  <br>  You are pretty sure that you have fallen for him. Good. Now I want you to apply the brakes here and take stock of the situation. Do you think he will leave his pregnant girl for you?  <br>  <br>  I understand that you are highly interested in him. I would advise you to take things slowly. Since you guys work at the same place, you will always have a chance to observe him. I think he is confused with himself and what he wants in life.<br>  <br>  Give this relationship a chance ONLY after you have exercised caution.<br>  <br>  Remember, love is blind but relationships are not.|`|jSPj3S6faa	Wow, this is a tough call.<br>  <br>  It's tough mostly because it is somewhat obvious by his actions previous to your appearance that he is committed to the pregnant girl-friend.  He certainly seems to be quite the catch.<br>  <br>  I cannot blame you for being attracted to such a guy.<br>  <br>  However, we have to accept the reality of the situation.  He has a previous commitment.  The fact that he clicks so well with you may be the effect that he has on many people and not just girls with whom he had romantic intentions.<br>  <br>  I know of a similar fellow who has been a close family friend for thirty years.  Everybody loves him and he sincerely loves everybody else.  It's just the way he is.<br>  <br>  I feel that this is the case here.  He is probably a very good and sincere and open friend; but I believe that he fully intends to stay with the girl he has openly shown you.  His friendship can easily become a greatly treasured possession in your life.  Don't push for romance.  Be sincere. Be open.

If you really want to get rid of him, stop answering his calls on the weekend, don't return his calls & when you run into him tell him that you've just been really busy.

D0JsiC0Paa	Not really; it's more of a social thing - it's the stigma that follows, the permenant label that psychologists are afraid of ascribing to a patient. It varies more from country to country and culture to culture - in Japan only an estimated of 25% of patients are diagnosed simply because the stigma is so great that practitioners are afraid to pass the diagnosis.
T9SHuVVnaa	No - If the value of the Euro is 2 (for example) and the Yen is more than the Euro (yen = 3) then the USD cannot be more than the yen (3) if it is less than the euro (2).<br>  <br>  Confused much?|`|7c007d90b52d84105c8a22e166229b79aa	No, exchange rates rise and fall in each currency, and {in theory} are independent of each other. I trade in USD/EURO/TURKISH LIRA. It is common for the dollar to be rising vs. the lira, and falling vs. the euro,and the lira rising vs the euro but falling vs the dollar, while the euro is rising against the dollar and falling vs the lira. Say that fast three times, and you are ready to enter the currency market.

Most travel by foot, some by bicycle, and a few travel as some of their medieval counterparts did, on horseback or by donkey (for example, the British author and humorist Tim Moore). In addition to people undertaking a religious pilgrimage, there are many travellers and hikers who walk the route for non-religious reasons: travel, sport, or simply the challenge of weeks of walking in a foreign land. Also, many consider the experience a spiritual adventure to remove themselves from the bustle of modern life. It acts as a retreat for many modern "pilgrims". "
fvuEtkROaa	Yes,  and lots of it. A psychiatrist is a doctor (MD or DO) first, and then  specializes in psychiatry.  A psychologist is not  a physician.

Rt4bJfVAaa	This is very general but they are mine.  Don't have names really.  I guess it's because for me all people collectively impact society in a positive way that we overlook.  Too many times we think it is one person.  When all the while it is the one person that is a reflection of the society he comes from.<br>  <br>  1) As a group the framers of the American Constitution and the republican form of governement that recognized men got their inalienable rights from God alone.  The rights of man do not come from government.  That means the government itself must be a righteous one.<br>  2) The goodwill of the American people whose prosperity enabled them to give and share out of the goodness of their hearts.  It is volunteer.  <br>  3) To the nameless and faceless good samaritans in all societies.  Whether religous or not.  <br>  4) To good instructive educators who challenge their students to be the best so that what they give to society is the best and the brightest they were entrusted by their parents to teach.<br>  5) The church. Especially those that never compromise the values of a religious and holy God for which all men are accountable for their deeds.<br>  6) To all good people of faith whose quiet and silent witness for Jesus Christ is a presence that most unaware of.  And only made aware of when they are not there.<br>  7) The entrepeners and creative people of society.  To make things useful things that enable man to progress in the world in medicine and technology.   And artists and writers and who create beauty and worlds of reality where people can dream while they are awake.<br>  <br>  For me personally and without question it is Jesus Christ.

8d8ejHPfaa	Hi Andrew, well, a ship is for navigating through water, and water is often associated with emotions in dreams, so ships also have associations with water and emotions.  That you are working on a small model of a ship suggests that you are examining a facet of your emotional life in minute detail.  You notice the glue says toxic, so that leads me to the idea that you are exploring emotions that are toxic, something like anger or resentment. You get careless with the toxic substance, and wind up with a "situation on your hands", and you're "stuck with it".  (have you possibly had a fight with someone lately, perhaps where you have communicated your problem with them in a toxic, as in less than healthy way?)  Another possibility may be that toxic emotions have left you emotionally "stuck", unable to move forward emotionally (Perhaps as in a relationship that went bad). You go to the hospital (you're looking for healing of the emotions) when you get home, you are unable to use your hands (healing is delayed).  This offers implications of being unable to reach out to others.  Being unable to do things offers an impression of feeling helpless to do anything about the situation.<br>  <br>  If you aren't sure what this situation is about, since it is a recurring dream, when you have it make sure that you write it down, and write a jounal entry for a few days before that, and then when you have a number of them together you can start to examine the journal entries for what they have in common, you may find a particular person, or situation, or attitude shows up in your writings about your day.

I never speak out while I study, its more natural and seams to work better. I also never go over the same info more than once in a short space. Try to imagine the book, like a movie in your head, Whenever I read its just like the movie theater, it helps you remember things too. If your reading a text book, imagine its a documentary, its not that fun true, better than dry text though. I would also recommend studying in fifteen minute interviews, with 5-10 minute breaks, cramming is stressful and you'll find its easier to learn if you take a more laid back approach.|`|3CSoSRmtaa	It's called reading comprehension.  When i was seventeen I had a reading comprehension test done at a local DVR.  They diagnosed me with a fourth grade reading level.  They suggested I start reading children's books first to get my mind to focus on things I already knew and could read easily.  Then after I read baby books, I read toddler books (where I understood and could repeat what I just read), then children's books (I could summarize a whole chapter), then, honestly I read harry potter and I was hooked on reading (I could summarize the whole book).  My level of reading has risen two grades in just less than a year.  I began to see that reading wasn't a chore and that it is a blast putting myself into the adventure.  I love reading to this day and I still read children's books.  I hope you can overcome this too in the ways you find helpful.  Good Luck to you.

mVTGl6HGaa	a benchmark is the act of running a computer program, a set of programs, or other operations, in order to assess the relative performance of an object, normally by running a number of standard tests and trials against it. The term 'benchmark' is also mostly utilized for the purposes of elaborately-designed benchmarking programs themselves. Benchmarking is usually associated with assessing performance characteristics of computer hardware, for example, the floating point operation performance of a CPU, but there are circumstances when the technique is also applicable to software. Software benchmarks are, for example, run against compilers or database management systems. Another type of test program, namely test suites or validation suites, are intended to assess the correctness of software.<br>  <br>  Benchmarks provide a method of comparing the performance of various subsystems across different chip/system architectures.

4c03ca2af0670791eae96802dcc67d06aa	There are various viable interpretations to this sort of dream and many things to consider when interpreting your personal meaning behind this dream.<br>  <br>  For one, who is the guy in your dream?  Is it someone you genuinely have feelings for?  If so, I can see your perspective of it being like cheating on your boyfriend.  Or perhaps you've been experiencing lingering feelings of being dissatisfied with your current boyfriend.  However, if neither of these are the case, there are alternative interpretations to consider.<br>  <br>  Have you recently had sex or the desire to do so?  If so, that may be why you're dreaming about, and the guy in your dream could simply be a random person as sexual dreams are typically about the pleasure, rather than the love behind it, which would explain why your boyfriend was absent from it.  His later appearance in your dream where he is annoyed could be the resulting guilt of your actions as you start to realize that he was not your lover.<br>  <br>  Another thing to look at would be whether or not something else is going on in your life that you're inclined to try or some repressed feelings you want to get out or something within you that is boiling over.  Sometimes people who are repressing memories or feelings or secrets or any number of things have the overwhelming feeling that they may soon explode and are in desperate need of some sort of release.  Sex tends to be the number one thing that comes to the minds of people looking to relieve tension.  In this scenario, the fact that your boyfriend appears says that whatever feelings you're harboring may have something to do with him...or, as I've mentioned above, could be the result of guilt you experience when you realize you've just made love to someone who is not your boyfriend.  If this is the case, you should confront whatever it is that's on your mind and causing you to feel this tension.  You'll feel much better, and I assure you that your dreams will be better.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  I wish you the best of luck.|`|I1TybdSpaa	if its not the same person every time then i think there is nothing to worry about i often do it my fella works long hours and i think its my bodys way of saying im sexually frustrated if he was home more then i wouldnt have them but you havent cheated so there is no problem it may be that either your not getting enough or what you are getting is not satisfing you try to spice it up a bit and see how you get on good luck.|`|VBIICVR1aa	well ok.... ummmm u may have feelings for someone else other than your boyfriend and it could b considered cheating if you keep thinking about the same guy over and over|`|1715e418d258647b8c5712fb7cb128d6aa	could be but if your dreams have me in them its only natural|`|AA12360662	You have a dream of guilt conscience.

1SrMF55Daa	Okay, heres the tip, to when you begin to get nervous start off by put ting your lips together and breath through your nose, Take slow steady breaths. It may sound lame but its a technique that helps you relax.  It doesn't sound like you have a problem with communication, in my opinion it sounds like you buckle when you get anxious and nervous.  Let yourself ease into the conversation by relaxing. Change your mind set and become involved comfortably with the person your speaking to.  Keep in mind, if they're going to be a long term friend, they'll accept you just the way you are...you could have a handful of friends, but in the end, you'll be able to count all you true friends on one hand.<br>  Good luck to you and try the breathing technique..<br>  <br>  <br>  also, here is a site that can help you, its about communication issues, its a great site and talks about books you can get that are highly recommended:|`|dc5bTUtmaa	Hiya, l know what you mean, the psyco- babble people have come up with the label, "social anxiety".

Keep quiet most of the time.|`|6N8aZlhbaa	Conversation is a two-way process, you have to talk, but you also have to listen. You have to listen to the other persons conversation and that will guide your thoughts and conversations. Here are some notes I took from a great book that helped me become a better conversationalist. <br>  <br>  Great Conversation<br>  <br>  1. Start with small talk – even with folks you know to warm up to conversation<br>  a. Focus on common subjects<br>  i. Work<br>  ii. News, weather, sports<br>  b. Tip-toe through looking for commonality and areas of deeper interest<br>  c. Looking for shared experiences, deeper interests, common ground that you can move on to if you want to expand the relationship<br>  <br>  2. Being a great conversationalist is not all about ‘knowing what to say,’ but more about learning to enjoy the experience of talking with others and having a positive outlook.<br>  a. Good conversation results from an intricate (but not complicated) web made up of many things, to include<br>  i. Expectations<br>  ii. Attitude<br>  iii. Body language<br>  iv. Feelings, and <br>  v. Knowing what to say<br>  b. 75% of people fear personal conversation more than they fear public speaking<br>  c. Most people aren’t good at it so it takes work<br>  <br>  3. What does it take to be a good conversationalist<br>  a. Extroversion – NO<br>  b. Honesty – Yes<br>  c. A caring attitude – Yes<br>  d. A genuine interest in others – Yes<br>  e. A willingness to try – Yes<br>  f. An open attitude – Yes<br>  g. A willingness to share (openness about yourself) – Yes<br>  <br>  4. Being a good conversationalist requires a working knowledge of:<br>  a. Social norms<br>  b. Motivation<br>  c. Body language and facial expressions<br>  d. The ability to coordinate verbal and non-verbal messages<br>  e. Managing a repertoire of appropriate topics and conversational history<br>  <br>  5. How to begin<br>  a. Find safe, low risk situations or environments<br>  i. Find places where your likely to meet people who will have no reason to remember you or meet you again (at least not soon)<br>  ii. Nothing big is riding on the conversation<br>  iii. A place where you can keep the conversation relatively short<br>  b. Find a situation where the conversation isn’t the main event<br>  i. The gym<br>  ii. Church<br>  iii. The office<br>  c. Set reasonable expectations and measurable goals<br>  i. Exchange a couple of sentences with XX people at work or church<br>  ii. Introduce myself to two new people at (the gym, work)<br>  d. I will stumble – but keep going and it will get easier<br>  <br>  6. Keep a journal so you know that you are making progress<br>  <br>  7. What makes up good conversation – what turns other people on and helps them engage you in conversation<br>  a. 55% - Body language, facial expressions, eye contact, & gestures - SMILE (but not when it’s inappropriate)<br>  b. 38% - Voice (speed, variety, volume, & pitch)<br>  c. 7% - The actual words<br>  d. Smiling (when appropriate) is probably the most effective conversation tool available. Your face needs to say ‘I want to talk with you.’<br>  e. Make a conscious effort to:<br>  i. Look at the other person when they are speaking but don’t stare<br>  ii. Focus on their conversation<br>  iii. Nod appropriately<br>  iv. Smile when appropriate<br>  v. These things will help you focus on what the other person is really saying rather than thinking about other things or your response<br>  vi. Pace yourself when you speak<br>  vii. Breath regularly so you don’t run out of breath – something I do<br>  viii. Pay attention to the other persons mood<br>  ix. Keep your own body language open<br>  1. if sitting, lean forward slightly <br>  2. if standing, try to turn so you are fully facing the other person<br>  <br>  You can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in them than you can in two years trying to get them to become genuinely interested in you – Dale Carnegie<br>  <br>  8. Conversation is a complex process of relationship building through the exchange of visual signals and words – not just an exchange of words<br>  9. For a conversation to work both parties have to converse – that means you too!!!<br>  <br>  To others ‘shy’ appears ‘aloof,’ introverted appears as ‘snobbish.’ <br>  <br>  10. A few questions are okay to start a conversation but too many seem like an inquisition<br>  <br>  11. Conversation is give & take<br>  a. Share the talking<br>  b. Share the listening<br>  c. Share the questions<br>  d. Share the answers<br>  e. Share the spotlight<br>  f. Share the responsibility for bringing in new topics<br>  g. This sharing won’t guarantee a good conversation because some people won’t share and others want to dominate – but if you run into someone who actually wants to have a conversation they will help keep it going<br>  <br>  FINDING THE RIGHT WORDS – Ideas are like rabbits, you get a couple and learn how to handle them – pretty soon you have a dozen – John Steinbeck<br>  <br>  12. Pre-planned ‘stock’ openers usually sound phony and flop<br>  <br>  13. Most conversational topics and ‘openers’ fall into a few general areas<br>  a. Begin with free information that is appropriate to the situation<br>  i. Any unsolicited information provided in addition to the main focus of the conversation or answer to the question<br>  1. Example <br>  a. H

c2b69802ef9d960e8e16708b4ecfdc15aa	MOST DEFINITELY, YES!<br>  As awful as it sounds, I always felt that way about my younger sister.  (Unfortunately, my ONLY sibling.)  Not only were we incompatible personalities, but I just could not stand to get physically close to her.<br>  Logically, I know it is probably not her fault - and I can't even say she was a "bad" person - but something in her personal energy field has always repelled me - big time!<br>  All I EVER wanted from that girl was DISTANCE!<br>  <br>  Our personal energy field extends out about 3 feet from our bodies on all sides, and we are all somewhat reluctant to let others - especially strangers - into that space.  I believe that is why most people instinctively gravitate toward chairs or barstools that adjoin empty ones.  Chances are if there are 10 seats at a lunch counter and five people seated there, if no two of them are together, then you will usually see the five occupied seats perfectly alternated with the five empty ones.<br>  Do scenes in movies and TV shows where two people are right up in eachother's faces seem uncomfortably unrealistic to you?  They do to ME - simply because people don't really DO that in real life.<br>  <br>  I believe it is those whose energy signatures we DO feel attracted to who become our closest loved-ones.|`|bES0ltC8aa	Yeah I believe so ... people have that ora ... there is this person on my bus that makes me go crazy mad.... havent even spoken to the kid or anything . n im not the type of person to hate on someone for no reason... or hate someone period, just not me .. but for some reason that kid drives me crazy|`|46uiaxPUaa	Yes, some people have a very bad energy to them. Sometimes there are people that i don't like and i've never even said a word to them.
FdY5qFE7aa	They may be strong but sometimes where no options  or hope left for them, Possibly suicide is the best thing for them.<br>  I feel pity for their family and friends too..<br>  I lost my elder cousin... He did the most stupid thing...He was cheated in love so he swallowed acid and phenols when there was nobody at hone... But luckily he was saved, but his condition was very serious..After 2 weeks of hospitalization, he came back to home... and the next morning, when we went to his bedroom, he was not there, We searched everywhere. No news from him for 2 days, then it was heard that his dead body was found nearby well..|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	I feel really.. sad for them.|`|JxUFDutxaa	I think I understand to point that they do it because they feel trapped in their situation with no hope in sight.<br>  That can be a devestating feeling.<br>  It's unfortunate that sometimes those people fall through the cracks and don't get the help they need.<br>  It's not always easy to just think good thoughts..or to "buck up"|`|464cd149b8bc7f1afebea410c89ca583aa	Persons who commit suicide are deeply troubled. If they succeed in committing suicide it is often due to the fact that they were crying out for help and no one listened to them. New research indicates that  there is a genetic basis for suicide (it runs in families, for instance the Hemmingways: suicide plagued the talented Hemingway family for three generations  and may be due to a genetic trait passed unwittingly through the clan, say mental health experts.<br>  <br>  The Los Angeles County coroner's office ruled Margaux Hemingway's July 1, 1996, death a suicide by massive barbiturate overdose. The former model's suicide is the fifth among four generations of relatives. Her famous grandfather, Ernest Hemingway, killed himself with a shotgun 35 years ago. The novelist's father, brother and sister also committed suicide.<br>  <br>  Most persons who die by suicide suffer from a mental disorder, such as clinical depression, alcoholism, or drug abuse.<br>  <br>  Having read alot about suicide and done a research paper on the topic, I discovered that different types of suicide exist: altruistic suicide (this type of suicide is found in the Japanese kamikaze pilots of WWII, these pbenefitingup their lives because they thought they in crashing their planes into allied ships ,they believed they were benefitting Japanese society. In egoistic suicide: Egoism is a state in which the ties attaching the individual to others in the society are weak. Since the individual is only weakly integrated into the society, the person committing  suicide  believes his act will have little impact on the rest of the society.Anomic suicide: Anomie is a state in which there is weak social regulation between the society's norms and the individual, most often brought on by dramatic changes in economic and/or social circumstances. This type of suicide happens when the social norms and laws governing the society do not correspond with the life goals of the individual. Since the individual does not identify with the norms of the society, suicide seems to be a way to escape them. Examples include the spike in suicide rates during the Great Depression.Fatalistic suicide: Fatalism is a state opposite to anomie in which social regulation is completely instilled in the individual; there is no hope of change against the oppressive discipline of the society. The only way for the individual to be released from this state is to commit suicide. Durkheim saw this as the reason for slaves committing suicide in antiquity, but saw it as having little relevance in modern society. Contemporary sociologists have argued that modern fatalistic suicide occurs in such societies as Jphilosophere social mobility is so limited by social norms that individual fulfillment is impossible.<br>  <br>  In 1964 A french  philospher created a new reason to explain why people commit suicide. Jacques Choron  called this "type" "rational suicide" and believed  it existed  when there is no psychiatric disorder, when there was  no impairment of the reasoning of the suicidal person, and the person's motives appear to be justifiable or at least understandable by the majority of contemporaries in the same culture or social group. An example of rational suicide is someone who kills themselves because they  they have a terminal illness, or because they feel that they simply cannot cope with all the demands that the world places on them.|`|MrLdBraoaa	They... are... weak...!<br>  ONLY THE STRONG SURVIVE!|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	I have often wondered what people who commit suicide think we will think.  I generally just think they're too selfish, weak, and cowardly to work through tough times, opting for a permanent solution to temporary problems.|`|fF1WbPltaa	It is usually a sad waste of a life. Of course if the person is nearing the end of their life and it is unbearable, it is still sad but understandable.|`|AA11142539	I think there's two types of people who commit suicide: those melodramatic fools who are trying to show someone something and basically proving they're idiots, and those who rationally "opt out" of life.<br>  <br>  I have no feelings whatsoever for those emotional basket cases that off themselves, I think it's better if they cause a sharp pain now than drag everyone into their drama, but I do kind of admire the rational self-euthanizers for overcoming their fear of death and rejecting the social mores of the time.|`|oFeNwMheaa	they need help!|`|mzhFrm5Taa	That there was obviously alot more to them that nobody else paid attention to. I don't judge anybody when a person committs suicide, I don't know the full story, I don't know what exactly happened or why, I'm not gonna go judge anybody based on what like, the news ,might say.|`|Tvcn83Adaa	It is a tough question to answer.  I feel bad for the people who are left behind that have to pick up the pieces, and question themselves not knowing why and what they could have done.<br>  <br>  I have a few members of my family that were suffering terminal illnesses.  When the pain was too much, and there was no other hope, they choose to end their life.  The whole family knew and got to say their good byes.  It was painful, but understandable.|`|RwRCwJXMaa	I think it is the most selfish act a person could make. Obviously they don't think of all the people in their life that they are affecting. It really pisses me off and most suicides are for stupid reasons, oh Im ugly, she doesn't love me, i cant get a job, etc... CMON people! Suck it up these are things that every person delas with PuSSys!! You hit a very touchy subject here. I have a few friends and family members who have done it or tried go talk to a counselor r suttin and get over it.|`|Xtqq71KGaa	every case is different.  but i think it's wrong, because it means you opt out of learning the lessons you're here to learn.<br>  and you'll just have to learn them again later.|`|pWoMaxwkaa	They're under the influence.<br>  They dont enjoy life.<br>  They are having some hard times in life.<br>  And they gave up.<br>  <br>  I dont like hearing of suicide or homocide.|`|LVDV6PjKaa	Why...|`|mK1qUhkqaa	They never got proper help...|`|xwZV9jgPaa	really it depends on the situation and who the person was. for instance, a young child or teen committing suicide b/c of being bullied all the time or no one paying attention to them at home and them feeling like everything is their fault and there is nothing to live for....for that person I feel sad. That man who murdered his 4 children and his wife in their Mason home in Cincinnati then he killed himself in jail. I feel like he is a selfish prick who took the easy way out instead of rotting in jail for the rest of his life.|`|33e18371c231caed609d57632064134caa	it is sad to be so hopeless|`|d397dMRZaa	I think its a sad issue. Perhaps, if the person spoke up or someone who "cared" for them noticed there was something wrong then they wouldn't have done what they did. They must feel so lonely beforehand and that no-one has time for them. I understand why people do commit suicide but if they held on for a little longer perhaps their "knight in shining armour" would be there to help them.|`|7UfuqGmcaa	I think it's really sad (it kinda depresses me a bit and I can't get it out of my mind).  <br>  <br>  People who commit suicide are putting a permanent solution to a temporary problem (as you know nothing in life is constant).|`|eEoeURDHaa	I feel horrible for them, I've been to the point of where I've wanted to end it all, but I never do, only because I tell myself the next day will be better.<br>  <br>  Why anybody wouldn't feel sadness for somebody in that situation is beyond me.|`|lnRMmSeyaa	they think that they are only ending their lives, but they are actually ending it for all of their family and friends, so they r selfish!<br>  <br>  i know that sounds mean but my friend is traumatized now because he saw someone step in front of a train|`|pvDVFrKwaa	I think that its a tragedy that someone is in so much pain, has so much going on in their head that they the only way out is to die.

People walk away from their problems all the time.  But people contemplating suicide are stuck in the context of themselves.  Their self hate is a rebellion against life and the responsibility that comes with living.  If you know someone contemplating it, they can rescue themselves by repeating throughout the day, "Everything is beautiful".  This works even though they don't believe what they are saying.  The only obstacle to everything you want in life is you.  By affirming that life is beauty, we give it value.  Just saying and thinking it opens the doors to experiencing it because we are creating with every thought, feeling, and action.  <br>  <br>  They might also say, "I fully and completely love and accept myself".  They key to being loved and loving, is loving ones self.  Eventually, we all must face the fact that we create with every thought, feeling, and action.  Since life holds us accountable, we must to take accountablility for our own lives and realize that we can chose differently if we aren't liking the results.  <br>  <br>  Ultimately, I think people contemplating suicide need someone to show them how dynamic life can be.  Anything is possible: rags to riches, troubles to freedom.....it is all there for the taking.|`|7QExwh6Kaa	it depends on the reason. if the person can explain why they want to do it, and it sounds reasonable, i dont see why that person shouldnt have that choice. <br>  if the person cannot explain why, they just want to, then that seems like that may be more of a cry for help than an acctual wish to die. this sort of person should get help, and when they end up killing themself, that shouldnt be seen as their fault, they have been failed by other people, not the other wya round.|`|SAhAc8EXaa	it depends on why they do it.|`|DqhkNeHnaa	Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. I think people who resort to it are hopeless and it's sad they can't see past their situation and realize that things can  get better.|`|y5QvNNRFaa	people that end a life that was given to them are crazy. from what we no you go strait to hell so whats the point. i think that they are crazy and i cant imagine what could of happened to someone for them to end there 1 life|`|k72I3Z3Laa	This question cannot be answered realistically unless you are in a position where you may consider suicide. Many people will have an opinion on the subject, but if they were faced with it they may think different.|`|nIwZ73J7aa	i think its quite stupid because they are leaving everyone else who loves them behind. there are other ways of solving problems other than death.|`|cfj0RJLTaa	They weren't enjoying life so they took the easy way out.<br>  :O
I8DXi3B3aa	Sometimes the reasons for immature outbursts are medical, like hormone imbalances or even diet related. Sometimes the causes are social: how you were raised, the methods you've learned to use to deal with the world, your personal experiences. And sometimes the reasons are psychological: persons with ADHD, anxieties, obstinate defiant disorders, or other problems may act out because they crave the stimulation of provoking a response.<br>  <br>  Perhaps a good step to understanding and eventually changing these behaviors would be to get to know yourself better. Notice WHEN, WHERE, WHY, and TO WHOM you act this way. You may begin to see patterns that guide you.<br>  <br>  Make sure to provide yourself with adequate sleep, nutrition, exercise, and meaningful relationships. Consider therapy or discussing this with a doctor. Ask a trusted friend or loved one what patterns they see. <br>  <br>  Just seeing yourself in this honest light is a really mature thing to do. Keep being honest with yourself and keep striving to be the mature person you know you are capable of. Congratulations of trying!|`|opwR3BrMaa	Just look yourself in mirror and try to smile four to five times you will start enjoying the smile and do what you like to get out of it. Do right things only.
cfj0RJLTaa	I think it would be harder to interact [talk] with a child that is TOO grown... because they might try to be a know it all. I don't like kids like that because it makes me want to start shouting something along the lines of how old they are, how they might not have experience in whatever they're talking about, they think its better to be old too fast and that would make me pissed off. But if I had to interact [talk] with an adult that's TOO childish then it could probably be funny and with the personality I have I would probably criticize them and back talk them to cause an argument! <br>  <br>  But I guess it all depends on what kind of interaction.|`|KwNpyp3saa	An adult who is too childish.<br>  <br>  A child who is too grown, well then they will learn or you have to realize they are individuals and accept it. With an adult who is too childish, this is more difficult to deal with. You almost have to assume the role of parent and even then you can't do anything about it but ignore it.|`|50UbJp14aa	an adult who is TOO childish. because they will always be like children who cannot talk|`|AA11658197	a childish adult - because the childish adult cannot be sent to bed or grounded|`|mSt1LGfjaa	an adult that who is to childish..ummmm we must be talking about my ole man..haha,,sometimes he just wont listen,,

piDDZ6Ywaa	Yes, it happened to my ex boyfriend. We was so close, ringing each other and telling each other concerns and our feelings; then we both drifted apart. l'd do anything to roll back to 07' when times were absolutely great. </3|`|ddRs5zfhaa	Yeah.<br>  I moved on. I felt like there was nothing else I could do.|`|R6lxaKiEaa	Yes it is part of life.  Everyone in your life serves a purpose. <br>  <br>  You let time continue to go by and eventually you/or the person will realize what that purpose was.<br>  <br>  Me and my God Sister was tight growing up.  Eventually we grew a part because we no longer shared the same interest. We recently reunited and things are not the same.  But as I look back it all makes since why she was even  in my life.  I love her, and she loves but we both know that we can not be the way we use to be.|`|FN8meC6taa	I have had that happen and I also had that same person come back years later acting the complete opposite by not giving me any space at all and truely being nuts over me!

If it was not meant to be it was not meant to be. Find someone who can give you what you need.|`|4KF4v3Dcaa	Yes only 100 times.<br>  <br>  Well i always get rele upset, but theres nothing I can do. So i have to let go<br>  And i hate it!|`|On57DVlAaa	Yes. It's happened to me many times. Unfortunately, it is a fact that we become distant from the ones we love without realizing it, and it comes to a point where you can change it. <br>  What I always do is just keep the good memories with me. You can't push things. We move on. We change. We gotta accept those changes, and all we got to remember them with is memories. Memories are beautiful. Changes are part of who we are, and part of growing up. <br>  Sometimes it's betters to drift apart then to be friends for years, and then since you are pushing things, arguments happen and the friendship is shattered. Be glad that you distanced yourselves from each other before the changes caused a problem.<br>  <br>  :)!|`|AgBH66nJaa	It happens a lot, I think it doesn't help if you loose interest in eachother or if you spend too much time in someones company you can become 'bored' of them because the excitment of seeing them wears thin. I'd try a gift or a gesture, something to show how much they mean to you, but sometimes we have to accept these things take time. All the best xx|`|opwR3BrMaa	It happens a lot because of the modern life that everybody lives. Because of it people who are close become far. Even brothers don't have time for family gathering. The solution is the you try to be in touch to it as far as possible through media like phone, chat , mail and so on.|`|Xzdyz8Kiaa	Yes. I let them 'go'.  A true friendship is built on the ability of both to make sure that does not happen. The moment it happens, you have proof that it's not as special as you thought it was.|`|4JneH0QDaa	since i was 3, i had a best friend (or at least i thought i did) in the age of 20 (well and before that frankly) i figure out that this distance should have come a looooong time ago. Some people just don't seem to be that close as they thought they did, especially when you are a teenager. My best friends are the ones i have since college, they are like brothers to me.<br>  I never regret it that i lost contact with that particular one, in my case you see, he wasn't worth it, or lets put it this way, we had no idea what friendship means to act as good friends.<br>  In your case you may need to talk to your friend, maybe he really doesn't have enough time, even though good friends always find a solution.<br>  For example, the ones i have since college live in different towns, but that doesn't stop us to communicate or pay a visit to each other.<br>  The thing that will make you figure out that your friend is not close to you, is when you meet each other again. If you have nothing to say, not because of the 'distance' but really nothing to say, then you should move on. <br>  You'll meet a lot of people later on, just try to be a good friend and build  a new friendship with less demands and more understanding. <br>  You'll change, you will be able to have the ones you want in your life, as long you make sure to them that you will be there too.

p7MM283Taa	I think that there needs to be open discourse between men and women. I think that men need to be open to reading feminist work, discussing concerns that are unique to women, etc etc. In addition, I think that women must also be open to talking to men.

I don't want a guy that's been with a bunch of girls, it's disgusting to me.<br>  <br>  If he cheated and like you said there was no chance he'd ever do it again, then I wouldn't care.  But only if there was 0% chance he wouldn't.<br>  <br>  Physically abusive but would never do it again - wouldn't care.<br>  <br>  Crime - don't care<br>  <br>  But your hypothetical question saying that they would never do it again, is completely wrong.

Depends if she treated those partners with respect.<br>  <br>  Would you consider it your business (assuming you have a moral objection to that behavior)? Yes.

And 2, why did the first marriage not work out? What were the agreements? Was it an open relationship?<br>  <br>  Is this your business? Yes<br>  <br>  Would you care if your partner was once physically abusive (but wouldn't do it again)? I would, I would want to know their reasons for changing, and proof of their new respect for the bodies of others.<br>  <br>  What if he or she committed a major crime but went through jail, is sorry for it and wouldn't do it again (murder, rape, molestation). This would concern me.<br>  <br>  Is the past really just the past? Why or why not? It depends, it really does. The change would need to be sincere and I would want thought out reasons as to why I could be confident in the relationship.|`|DqhkNeHnaa	Yes. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour. That's just a fact. People don't change and become total different people... they may learn from their mistakes but their tendencies are still there. If someone was once an alcoholic no matter how much time goes by that they don't drink... they can go back to that at any time. <br>  It's very naive of you to think otherwise.|`|mY4m47WTaa	If the past stays in the past, then it might not matter, but if your partner is mapping the past forward (or is stuck there emotionally or behaviorally), then yes, it matters quite a bit. Sometimes you don't find out until it is too late.|`|00yHUtXuaa	Our past is mostly a product of our decision-making abilities....|`|dtug4wEdaa	It doesn't.|`|QQQ36jMOaa	For some of that, no, it wouldn't matter to me.  It wouldn't matter how many partners he had.  I wouldn't have a moral objection to the number as long as it stays in the past.  Now if he had been married and cheated on his wife, that I would have a problem with--because I would wonder if he would cheat on me.  Cheating takes a certain kind of mentality and if he was alright cheating on his last wife, I would have to question if he was alright with cheating on me.<br>  <br>  If my partner was physically abused, how is that his fault?  I would feel for him, sympathize him, and certainly not hold such abuse against him.  Now if he was the abuser?  Hmm, I think its wouldn't matter until the first time he raised a hand against me.  I'm willing to forgive one their mistakes, but the second he tries to hit me, he'll find himself out the door on his @ss.<br>  <br>  Rape, murder, or molestation is something I can't forgive.  Sorry, call me narrow minded if you wish but there are certain things I will not associate myself with.  Having been a victim of rape, I can NOT understand the mentality of one who would commit it.  I wouldn't want to be around the person--knowing that somewhere there is a woman or man who suffers the same emotional trauma I have due to this person's actions.<br>  <br>  So in the end, the past matters in SOME areas for me.  I can overlook or not care about some things--but I will care about some others.

m89kGXBnaa	The eyes collect the information, but a red cone, firing alone, cannot be sure whether it is firing for a low intensity red light or a high intensity yellow light, (due to the discrimination curve of cone response to light - i.e. the respond stronger to light closest to their optimium point AND to stronger (i.e. more intense) stimuli). <br>  <br>  The only way to tell is compare it to the firing of a cone with a different wavelength optimium - i.e. a green cone - if the green cone is firing low, it's likely a red light. If it's firing high, it's likely a yellow light (mid way between the two).<br>  <br>  This comparision ONLY happens in the brain, in the visual cortex, not in the eye. The eye may gather information, but has no sense of it - it doesn't see, really, it can't gather meaning from the light it takes in.<br>  <br>  The Young-Helmholtz theory did, I think, set out the colour opponancy theory - the idea we see colours as a mix of different 'strengths' from the combinations of cones, rather than seeing them immediately. Read the source below to understand better, though.<br>  <br>  We see colours made up of two sets of colour opponants (red-green, blue-yellow). When I tell you pigeons (and shrimp) have considerably more colour opponants - (16, for shrimp, I think, maybe 8 for pigeons) you may understand why we are seeing something very different. Pigeons can tell the difference between true yellow  and yellow made of a mix of two light, for example - we can't|`|550EahFsaa	when your dreaming your in a deep state of mind and that means your brain is talking control but you cant exactly see properly in a dream that's because your eyes are closed. when you see something your eyes work as a camera and project the image to your brain.

67ThRN4Taa	I'm reminded of a line from a Shirley Temple movie, "We always want what we haven't got."<br>  <br>  In the movie, Shirley Temple's family are vaudeville actors.  (I saw it 30-odd years ago so I may get some details wrong).  The father decides that life on the road isn't good for the kids, so he decides to buy a farm and become a farmer.  To cut to the chase, he knows nothing about farming and can't make a go of it.  The movie ends with him deciding to get back into vaudeville.  That's when Shirley Temple utters her line "We always want what we haven't' got."<br>  <br>  When I'm single I'm miserable because I don't have a woman in my life.

iUzSlmSbaa	You should communicate with each other, talking about how you feel, discussing things that are important to you, hopes, dreams, fears....you should both be able to always talk about what's on your mind.. that can bring you closer together and strengthen the bond between both of you.. listen and talk to each other. hear each other out.. you will get to know about things concerning each other you don't know yet, that can lead to more respect for each other and to more trust.. and understanding in every way...<br>  <br>  Don't take each other for granted. Spend quality time together.. you can also do things independently from each other.. that's important sometimes to do some things without the other.. maybe you with your friends, and allow him to go out with his guy pals. Trust has to be there on both sides. If you love each other you got to take that leap of faith.. and when he is spending time with friends or doing something that you are not interested in... you need to let him have some time on his own, same as you need to be able to do the same.. but quality time together is very important...more than quantity time.. and to talk, if something is wrong, it's ok to argue sometime but to always try to find out what led to the argument and to try to find a solution... together...

D0JsiC0Paa	Well, like someone mentioned the expensive but somewhat easier way is to go to a trained therapist - but then that isn't to say that therapy is no work on the part of the patient.<br>  <br>   Secondly, it is much easier to see a spec of dirt in the eye of another but not to see the log in one's own as the ancient proverb goes - so it isn't hard for us to find the faulty thinking patterns of others, it comes quite naturally.<br>  <br>   As for identifying our own and correcting them, will that is the basis of all Cognitive Therapy - read 'Feeling Good', it is a great handbook and the first Cognitive Therapy guide written for the lay person; by a student of the guy who invented it - it's got some good intros and exercises.<br>  <br>   As for what you can do personally, what works for me is to write down situations you encounter that you felt you acted well or more importantly poorly in - may they be personal, professional or emotional - and then to see what you did, why you did and see your thoughts and justifications written down on paper and then to scrutinize them for inconsistencies, things that made sense at the time but don;t quite match up now, self-defeating thoughts and thoughts that are superfluous or even things that could have been done better, get over the illogical 'firewall' in your thinking of saying it all seems fine and be determined to find one thing wrong. <br>  <br>   Lastly, we learn our illogical thought patterns the same way we learn everything else - through repetition; and so the only way to correct the faulty patterns and learning to recognize them is to be constantly vigilant and look for them and take the exhausting steps to do it differently until it becomes as second nature as the illogical thoughts prior.|`|WQWA7L5zaa	You can tell your thinking was faulty somewhere when you don't get the results you expected. Then you must work backwards and verify every piece of data that you thought was true and find which one was false. Next you ask yourself why did you think it was true. Next you make a note of this event and learn your lesson so you don't do it again!<br>  <br>  Be careful about logical faults. You can pick them out when you can say "But this doesn't follow!" When you draw a conclusion, try your reasoning several times and examine every step of the process to double check that everything follows logically. Only then can you be reasonably certain that your conclusion is correct.<br>  <br>  Do the same when someone is proposing you a conclusion. Con artists are very skilled at logical faults, that's how they con people out of their money in the first place.<br>  <br>  One common error of logic is to assume that one thing is the cause of another just because the other thing happened after the first one. There is a Latin saying that goes "post hoc, not propter hoc" which means "after that not because of that".<br>  <br>  There is no intelligence without logic. Too bad for us, but the world seems to want to fool us all the time. But if we keep our logical mind sharp we can't be fooled. It takes more work than just trusting blindly  someone who looks like a good person, but it's worth the effort!|`|ljy6jKupaa	i would suggest getting a therapist to help you with yourself and leave others to themselves

8QdtFVe2aa	Absolutely not! Gregory Mankiw, a Keynesian economist at Harvard, disapproved of the bailout plan. Here is his response: <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2009/02/my-preferred-fiscal-stimulus.html" rel="nofollow">http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2009/02/m...</a><br>  <br>  More info about Mankiw and his work on New Keynesian economics may be found on Wikipedia.<br>  <br>  That being said, most Keynesians probably favour the government bailout plan. Yet it is not correct to generalize; different Keynesians will interpret situations differently.|`|x114YWtPaa	Yes, all Keynesians approve the bailout plan.  Some want more, and others want less quantitative easing (increase in the money supply or inflation).  Many Monetarists are also in favor of a bailout.  Only economists of the Austrian School and the Public Choice School are against it.  Only Austrians and Public Choice schools were against the bank bailouts as well and events have proved them correct.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	More government involvement, of course they do.|`|6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	Almost all economist favor some plan to save the banks or and least  government action to prevent the repercussions that would result from their failure, but the differ on the details of the plan.   Someone remarked when things started to fall apart, "There are no Libertarians in a financial crisis." and that seem to be true for economist at least.

yD0n1O5kaa	I'll share my experience, and you decide what to take and what to leave in terms of advice or answer.<br>  First of all "Life is suppose to be wonderful for all of us"<br>  How we feel about ourselves is the most important thing in the world.<br>  If the whole world can tell you how beautiful you are, but you yourself don't believe it than you'll never believe it.<br>  The self love has to come from you.<br>  How on earth can self love come from you when you are depressed?<br>  Practice.<br>  In our heads we hear our own voice.  We hear our own words telling us we are unattractive, or unworthy we are.<br>  It is up to you to change how you feel about yourself.<br>  I use to do this as many times as I needed:<br>  I would do some self talk in the morning before jumping out of bed - <br>  "I love myself. I am powerful, caring, understanding, beautiful, amazing, and I love who I am and what I have."<br>  Do self talk in the morning and before you go to sleep.  After 30 days even 15 days and notice the difference.<br>  You'll enjoy life more.  You'll notice when you love yourself, you'll draw positive people into your life  You'll realize how beautiful you are.<br>  I trust all will be well for you. Why? Because life is suppose to be wonderful for all of us.|`|y0NWmdh8aa	from your icon you don't look unattractive at all<br>  <br>  maybe the only person who thinks you are unattractive is you|`|50UbJp14aa	Just look at a mirror and say to yourself, that you are beautiful no matter who says what,  i bet your beautiifful, just take pics of yourself with confidence or get someone to take them for you and show it to your peers and just be proud of who you are.|`|XiQhSDttaa	The problem is that you care too much what people think of you.<br>  Who you are is not based on your appearance. People probably dont see you as unattractive either.. <br>  Theres also this thing...  where in your case, you would look into the mirror every morning and say to yourself/person in the mirror, "You are beautiful." Soon enough, you will believe it

Then do not rely on hackneyed homophic assertions to challenge those men who may 'flag' feminist beliefs, or indeed, those women who hold same... and hey! presto! you may cast off the mantle of infantile misogynist.  However, I doubt that you will for long, as you will still use facile interpretations of biologically determinist arguments to mask your sexism. x|`|xBd96wvRaa	You need to keep asking yourself that question. <br>  Find the root of why you feel this way. <br>  <br>  Was your mother a crappy one?

Because you believe they believe anyone who detracts from their doctrine is merely masking an infantile misogyny?|`|Q5BM2POnaa	Assuming your question is legit, you need to get to the root of the issue; probably something to do with your childhood and most likely your relationship with your Mother, or perhaps how you saw your Father treat her.<br>  <br>  Assuming you're well into adulthood, and have been feeling and doing these things for many years, its probably beyond the point of self-diagnosis and self-healing.

That's why you talk so long.<br>  Just tell him you were scared when he originally expressed an interest...but now that you feel more comfortable about him....you would like to know if you could start over.<br>  But you need to be the one to admit your feelings and see how he answers.  He might just think you're a flake, or he might jump on the chance to get back into a more serious aspect of your life. Either way you need to get his answer, and respect it.

Maybe you should mention if he would like to meet for a coffee somewhere... then you have other people there. You won't meet him at home. You are in a public place but you can get to know each other a lot better if you talk in person. That gives you and him an opportunity to see if there is ''a connection'' between the two of you... to talk online or to talk when face to face is different... you should casually mention what he thinks of meeting for a coffee.. name a place where you meet.. if he says yes.. that still obliges you to nothing at all.. you only talk to each other and either it will make the friendship stronger.. then you know he is a nice guy, and then you may not feel shy once you met him, and if it's not meant to be, at least you will find out and not wonder if you missed out on a great opportunity.. you can just casually mention... ''We have been chatting for hours and for years now.. how about meeting and talking in person rather than online?

I`m an easygoing person and always want to get along with everyone. However, I fear my whole life. But it is a life WITH fear, not a life IN fear. It is a cliche, I know, but you can embrace your fear or run from it. Life is beautiful and it is horrible as well. If you don`t know how to be afraid you will forget how it feels to be safe. It is important to know one to be able to appreciate the other. I know it`s tough but it`s supposed to be. What you do about it, talk with someone, learn a defensive technique, bring a friend or a can of mace with you, it may solve your problem but it will not erase your fear. If you want to be brave you do not to be strong or experienced or cunning, you just have to embrace the thing you fear most and realize that that fear is what should push you through and not hold you down|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	Maybe you could tell the bus driver about the threats so he can be aware & try to walk to class & around school with another person or in a group of people.

Waiting for a girl to initiate sex may have you waiting a very long time. Women still for the most part expect you to make the first move, and ask her out. Probably asking a girl, "Do you want to f**k?" Will make her leave even if she wanted to say yes. If she goes back to your place, that's a very good indicator, and like the one girl basically said try to kiss her, hold her hand, etc. If she doesn't laugh and push you away by your forehead when you try to kiss her, you probably have a chance. The thing is you have to take it slow and get her into it. If you move too fast before she's hot, then you may turn a sure thing in rejection.<br>  Now the PCists aren't going to like me saying this..but some girls, just some, want you to be very aggressive and make all the moves while they pretend it was all your idea, so that she can still be a good girl. YOU were the one who wanted to have sex, not her. You have to be careful though and be able to tell when "no means no" or when it is just a part of the courtship. Like a girl screaming no get off of me, that would be the former, and if you are making out with a girl and she pushes your hand away when you put your hand up her shirt, but later when you've been kissing her neck for awhile longer, you try again and she lets you. Never go straight for the...uh...vagina. Kiss her for awhile then maybe hand up the back of the shirt. When it seems right go for the chest, then take the top off. then later rub the thighs, go for the gold, but outside of the pants. Maybe pull your thing out about now, put her hand on it. Try to get the pants off, if she's not letting you wait and try again or say something like, "I just want to take you pants of not your panties." Well I don't want to continue bc I don't feel like being more graphic, but I think you got the idea. Problem with this method, that works very well, is that you may get the girl very horny and manipulate her into doing things that she didn't want to do before she got hot. This holds true especially with virgins. At the best she may not care, or will feel used and/or embarrassed and not see you again. At worst a feminazi friend may try to convince her that it was rape and you will have your world turned upside down, and be scarred for life even if the cops decide that it wasn't rape and it goes no further. The local newspapers will have branded you a rapist and people like to talk.|`|1xDtS8wwaa	Bull honkey. Most of these answers are crap.<br>  <br>  Physical contact is the key. If she doesn't seem receptive to your casual physical contact (brushing her back as you lead her into a door, touching her hand during a conversation at dinner), she's not into you.

VgPG5WMsaa	Your question is very interesting and important. In Christianity males have a God given leadership role in the family. The masculinity the Creator has bestowed enables men to fulfill this role under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.<br>  Men and women are not meant to be competitors but each is to employ their inherent characteristics both to honor God and to bless their offspring and culture at large.<br>  <br>  Because the radical left despises Christianity, they have worked to undermine the traditional Christian family. They see the family as a rival to the statism they favour to nurture human needs. The family was instuted by God and is the most effective and inexpensive means to raise children and good citizens.<br>  <br>  The gender confusion the left has fostered has destroyed family cohesion and has left the sexes feeling unfufilled and<br>  in despair.|`|pWoMaxwkaa	I personally think that masculinity is important.

I think gay men are attacked more than gay women also.|`|nBa2euH4aa	Masculinity is very important. The more important question is "what is masculinity". A big reason it seems to be not as popular is because masculinity is confused for aggression or other incorrect stereotypes. IF we understood how wonderful both rolls are, maybe we wouldn't have so much body confusion. As a women I love masculinity and I hope you find out the wonderful attributes of the roll.<br>  Good Question!

NAGiNKFWaa	I participate on several dog sites, so when I post a question it is because I do not know the answer to the question.  I expect everyone who has an answer to submit it, and I take advice from everyone from the "oh my Gods" to the people who just own shelties.  My potty training tips were written and re-written by dozens of people from school teachers to top champion breeders, to people like me who grew up on a farm and that is how we did it.  When an issue comes up that I have not dealt with or heard of, I post a question.  I don't just believe an answer because it was submitted though.  I researched every answer to make sure that I had the best med or product, or trick for that issues.  Sometimes choosing several answers as a solution for the issues.  I don't think there is just one way to do things, you have to do what works for you and your dog.

By the end of the 1st trimester, your son or daughter will have grown to 3.4 inches (8.7 cm) long and weigh about 1.5 ounces (43 grams).

That way it is always too late.|`|p7MM283Taa	This is a question that will give you a lot of diverse answers. There are many pro-life feminists, and many pro-choice feminists. I will give you my own opinion.<br>  <br>  I think that when a woman discovers she is pregnant (which is usually within the first one or two months) she should have the choice as to whether or not she has the child. If she knows she cannot handle single motherhood, and the poverty that often comes with it, she should be able to avoid this. A big reason that I think choice should be available is because we cannot judge the woman's situation - many people would not encourage a woman who was raped to have a child. How do we define rape? If a girl is forced into sex by her boyfriend, this is rape, but many people would think she was a "slut" and that she chose to have sex, just because the man who raped her was her significant other. I do not think a woman should need to justify herself - any moral dilemmas she faces due to her decision should be her own. She should not need to justify herself to any of the more "enlightened" powers who will decide her future with this child.<br>  <br>  Edit: I do think it is irresponsible, however, to have an abortion after four months, when the child is clearly developing and a woman has known she has been pregnant for a while.|`|1xDtS8wwaa	This a blanket question.
