rvTcDJ6yaa	I have also heard there is not much to see in Milan either. I never went but a day was all my flatmate told me she needed for it.  Venice is quite small. I had 2 nights there and that was ample time to get around....there is also not a huge amount to do there...a market next to Rialto Bridge, San marcos square ( duomo and doge palace) and thats about all I really saw that sticks in my memory. but as its so different to others its a must see. There are other churches around but once you have seen one, you have seen them all!    Verona has a lovely setting and I really enjoyed it...around the "colloseum"is a main area of cafes etc and you can go to the opera in the summer time...romeo and juliette stuff etc. I had 1 night there and it was not quite enough. I will say I loved the garden there...forgotton name ( its out of the main area but walkable.. its a formal style but has a roman feel ( I had a lovely day there so thats what I remember.    Bologna has a medieval feel...the main duomo is quite impressive..i had very little time there eg an afternoon ( i was flying out the following morning) but it looked ok as a city...take a close look at the fountain near the main square/duomo area...i walked past it 4 times before I looked at it properly and then I laughed!  I hear there is one of those body museums there and there is good parmesan cheese and I bought great balsamic vinegar from there too! mmmmmmmm|`|TfyYx7A5aa	I live in Milan and i can assure you that you'll find the best nightlife of all Italy...|`|DotPKf7Aaa	Try this go to http://www.easydestination.net/europe/it... and choose guide of city you want to travel.

Interstate 96, for example, exists solely within the state of Michigan. Many spur and loop routes exist only in a single metropolitan area.    The answer can be found on the Federal Highway Administration website. In short:    ".....the Interstate System is more than just a series of connected highways. It is also a design concept, with highways designed to handle high volumes of traffic safely and efficiently at freeway speeds. Moreover, the Interstate System is not limited to routes passing through two or more States. Many Interstates, such as circumferentials/beltways and spurs, are confined to one State.    Although Hawaii's Interstate highways are not connected to those in the continental United States, they are built to Interstate standards. The fact that they carry an "H" number, rather than an "I" number differentiates them from the connected system of Interstate routes on the continental United States."

Be careful when you do this. Do not stop until the full fart has been expelled. Walk an extra 30 feet to make sure the smell has left your pants.    FLY BY    The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping.  Walk in and check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come  back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.  People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.    ESCAPEE    A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop  in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of embarrassment.  If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen.  If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it.  No one likes an escapee. It is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.    JAILBREAK    When forcing a poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace.  This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should  happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom to  spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.    COURTESY FLUSH    The act of flushing the toilet the instant the poop hits the water.  This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom.  This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.    WALK OF SHAME    Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just  stunk up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone  walks in and busts you. As with farts, it is best to pretend that the smell  does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH.    THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (P.F.N)    A group of co-workers who band together to ensure emergency pooping  goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the where  abouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS.    SAFE HAVENS    A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least  expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex.  This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.    TURD BURGLAR    Someone who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to  force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments  that can occur when taking a poop at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall  until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.    CAMO-COUGH    A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you  are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert  potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an  ASTAIRE.    ASTAIRE    A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that  you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is  occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace.    WATERMELON    A poop that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.    HAVANA OMELET    A case of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an ASTAIRE.    UNCLE TED    A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you should always wait to poop when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees.|`|NfE0iA8Baa	No.. that place is so crowded and dirty.  Do not think thats a good place to stay|`|lPDRQH7aaa	I do live in NYC and I love it.

8II1frHiaa	you are talking about the system followed some centuries ago, now it is completely changed.  There is no humans treated as untouchables or like sudras.  But, the caste system continued as Forward community, Backward community, Scheduled caste, scheduled tribes, and in backward community, there is a division like backward and most backward.  All are equal before law. The rule is common for all.  The caste system is utilised for getting school/college admission, employment opportunities only. i think you are asking difference between untouchable and sudra.  Sudras are the persons who are not bramins and untouchables are the persons who are not sudras.  This is the system followed some centuries ago  and not now.  Now, all learned are bramins and those who are not learned are not bramins..|`|AA11272288	This was century old traditions of Indian culture irrespective of any religions .Its not visible now .|`|XrEqv6K9aa	Such sort of caste system used to be there in India earlier but not now. It was not only in Hindus but in Muslims also. Now there are no untouchables. Many people of such castes are now occupying highest positions in government.   Do you know that the Constitution of India after independence in 1947 was drafted by Dr Ambedkar who came from a a s called sudra family?|`|3t2oJeruaa	The Vedas classified every one into four castes.    It must be composed of four classes, Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras.      1. The Brahmins were placed at the top; the Kshatriyas were placed below the Brahmins but above the Vaishyas; the Vaishyas were placed below the Kshatriyas but above the Shudras and the Shudras were placed the lowest of all  2. The third feature of Chaturvarna was that each class must engage itself in an occupation assigned to it. The Brahmins' occupation was to learn, teach and officiate at religious ceremonies. The Kshatriyas' occupation was to bear arms and to fight. The occupation of the Vaishyas was trade and business. The Shudras' occupation was to do menial service for all the three superior classes.       At this stage Shudras still enjoyed some rights. The right to collect food from villagers, the right to collect corn from each villager at the harvest seasons and the right to appropriate the dead animals belonging to the villagers.     The Untouchables   while the Shudras period was marked by the imposition of Vedas doctrine and at least considering Shudras as lower in the ladder of Hindu caste structure, the untouchability resulted in creating the total outcasts. Physically this meant ousting the untouchables even from their habitats and pushing them into a ghetto. Ambedkar called them, people of the Indian ghetto. All forms of contact were forbidden by the use of rules of untouchability.      but now since1950 india's constitution says that untouchability is banned and according to it no one is born untouchable , its just the image in people's mind!!!:)|`|pI5jKfmaaa	Let it be made clear there are no untouchables nor any sudras .In India an Act of Parliament made Untouchability practices a cognizable offence and one is liable to be arrested with out bail.    The untouchablity feature in the caste system was one of the cruelest features of the caste system. In the Indian society people who worked in ignominious, polluting and unclean occupations were seen as polluting peoples and were therefore considered as untouchables. The untouchables had almost no rights in the society. In different parts of India they were treated in different ways. In some regions the attitude towards the untouchables was harsh and strict. In other regions it was less strict.     In regions where the attitude was less strict the untouchables were seen as polluting people and their dwellings were at a distance from the settlements of the four Varna communities. The untouchables were not allowed to touch people from the four Varnas. They were not allowed to enter houses of the higher Varnas. They were not allowed to enter the temples. They were not allowed to use the same wells used by the Varnas. In public occasions they were compelled to sit at a distance from the four Varnas. In regions where the attitude towards the untouchables were more severe, not only touching them was seen polluting, but also even a contact with their shadow was seen as polluting.    If, because of any reason, there was a contact between an untouchable and a member of the Varnas, the Varna member became defiled and had to immerse or wash himself with water to be purified. In strict societies, especially among the 'Twice Born' (the three top Varnas) the touched 'Twice Born' also had to pass through some religious ceremonies to purify himself from the pollution. If the untouchable entered a house and touched things of a Varna member, the Varna members used to wash or clean the places where the untouchable touched and stepped.     In some incidences the untouchables who associated with the Varna members were beaten and even murdered for that reason. Some higher hierarchy Jats also had servants whose job was to go or walk before the high Jats members and announce their coming to the streets and to see to it that the streets would be clear of untouchable people.     The orthodox Hindus treated anyone who worked in any kind of polluting job as untouchable and did not have any contact with them. According to orthodox rules any one who does not belong to the four Varnas, meaning foreigners, are untouchables.

2EVoNHHbaa	DC is on the border between the northern states, which get a lot of snow, and the southern states, which don't.  This is reflected in our snow patterns: some years we get several large snowfalls, and some years (such as 2008) we barely get any.      Couple that with the fact that DC has a lot of folks who come to work here from all across the nation, many of whom have barely seen snow in their lives.  Those folks have no idea of how to drive around on ice and snow.      The combination creates a bad situation when it does actually snow, such as yesterday.     On the positive side, the local governments, after having tried to ignore snow removal and preparation for many decades, are finally getting serious about it.  Metro now knows how to operate its trains despite snow.  The highway departments know how to pre-position trucks filled with chemicals before the snow even starts.  Yes, it costs a lot of money, but local residents appear pleased.|`|wNK5Bzv1aa	You don't take chances on ice.  Even 1/2 inch of ice is dangerous.  I live in Dallas area.

You don't want to mess with that.|`|BMkVOR0caa	You are correct.  Also people do not know how to drive.  One snowflake and you have 100 accidents.  Obama was correct, The residents of Washington DC need to grow up when it comes to winter weather.|`|245ZYuDTaa	I live in an area where the town folds up when it snows also. I do think it is better to not to be on the roads when they are icy.|`|mlAW436Daa	What I think happens is the weathermen make the weather sound worse than it's going to be. Viewers are more likely to stay up and watch the news if there's a hint of major storms/school closings and things like that. So I think this mentality affects everyone. Here in Cleveland the kids didn't have school and I don't think it's that bad out. The major wanted the workers downtown to stagger leaving work so that everyone wouldn't have to leave at the same time. But yeah it seems like evryone over reacts nowadays to the weathermen.|`|e746acef219bc12d4577eee9e5a21969aa	The snow was no big deal, ice is a real problem. People in DC are from all over the country and world and people don't know how to drive in winter weather.

My neighborhood, which is on a hilly area, was not plowed / salted until late afternoon. We don't panic, we just prepare ourselves for the worst esp. with icing can cause power failure than just snowing.     OOOOH! yea we only get 1 or 2 good snows per year, so we make the most out of it. From early december, we hear NE and Mid west get lots of snow, yet it usually gets pushed away when it is about to hit our area. Throughout the season, it is one of those "Alas!" moments. most snow storms are false-alarms.|`|a4jg2r6Daa	See up in Chicago... it doesnt ice it snows. Snow is bad but it's less dangerous than ice.
AA12210908	Good plan, Utrecht and Gouda are both worth a day-visit, but since you are not long in Amsterdam either, you are right. Train would be the best. Every 15 minutes a train leaves, at .07, .22, .37, .52 from Amsterdam CS. the trip takes 30 minutes. At Utrecht CS you can walk to the center (Oudegracht) in less than 15 minutes. Gouda is then 20 minutes from Utrecht and there are even more trains than 1 every 15 minutes. You can buy a return ticket Amsterdam - Gouda and travel via Utrecht costs 18 euro 60 cents.   Maybe I would start in Gouda, since Utrecht has more to offer for dinner.   On http://www.holland.com/uk/ you can find information on The Netherlands.  On http://www.gouda.nl/content.jsp?objectid... some links in Gouda. On http://www.utrechtyourway.nl/utrecht/def... information for tourists in Utrecht.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Take the train, much faster.     You'd need to get up early to do both towns in one day, I'd actually take an entire day for Utrecht, there's so much to do there.     Not having Dutch is absolutely no problem anywhere in the Netherlands if you're a tourist. The Dutch are excellent when it comes to speaking other languages.|`|BgfBpkA3aa	use the train, fairly cheap and very reliable. the majority of dutch speak good english.   as far as doing them in 1 day, thats depends on how much time you want to spend there!  have a nice time|`|hrFmo6iYaa	It is possible to cover both towns but you'll have to be specific on what you'd like to see! Best way would be by train (http://www.ns.nl/cs/Satellite/travellers... Utrecht is very pretty, especially the canals are worth it, don't know Gouda that well but I'm thinking that as you are that specific, you'll know what you want to see already.    I would say Utrecht first and then Gouda, you can travel back to Amsterdam in the evening when all is dark.    English is fine, no problems at all.     Enjoy your trip!!

CyP7VMHHaa	No airline is always the cheapest. Airlines limit the number of discount seats per flight. Once they sell out, you pay more. Depending on the availability of those discount seats, Airline A may be the cheapest for travel on Monday, Airline B on Tuesday, and Airline C on Wednesday.    If you want to find the cheapest fare, just go to a good search engine such as www.kayak.com. You can also easily try different dates and see if the fare is cheaper.    Forget about the previous suggestion to use Allegiant  Air.

AA12217678	Hi, there!  It is nice of you to be interested in your native country. I am a Bulgarian, but currently live in the US, so I believe I can give you a  nice prospective on the things you are looking for.  I would not say that the people there are nice, I am sorry, but I just want to be honest with you. They are one of the ruddest people I know! It is not like you are used to in the US-great customers service,everyone is smilling at you and being polite! Over there, the lady at the ticket boot will snap at you, if you ask for your buss schedule, the waitress  will look at you like you are waisting her time and we even have a saying, that if translated will go something like that: " I dont care about me beeeing ok, I just want the other person NOT to be ok!" That speeks for it self!   I dont know if you speek bulgarian or not, but if you dont, then you will be looked upon differently! People will try to show their best side in front of you-to try to impress the foreigner! And, of course, they will envy you and try to take advantage of you, so beware!  I am not saying that all are like that-there are some very nice and genuine people,its just that they are hard to find now days. In a way I dont blame bulgarians for being like that, after everything they've went trough and the miserable life majority of them live right now,just struggling to make ends meet. One thing I can tell you is that there are no false pretenses out there and they'll tell you straight in the face what they think about you!  Varna is definitely not a poor city. It's actualy one of the biggest and prettiest cities in the country!  The scenery in Bulgaria varies greatly. You can see broken roads, falling appart buildings that should be condemned,but there are actualy people living there, a lot of garbage  and old cars. But nature is simply magnificent!!! You can find all you wish for-long beaches covered with soft golden sand and top notch resorts along the Black Sea coast, incredable snow capped mountains, great architecture and old ruins, sparkling lakes and great peacefull valeys.  I think it will be a journey of a life time for you going back and trying to find your roots. Keep an open mind and good luck!:)|`|9FW0XcCuaa	I've only been skiing in Bulgaria but from my experience the people are very nice and can speak good english.

Very near Varna. I think if to compare with other areas in Bulgaria Varna is not poor. It is nice town, has very old history, interesting architecture. i think it's the biggest port. Varna is surrounded by summer resorts. and i was staying in Golden Sands which is i think the most popular.. it was great, very clean, lots of clubs, good beaches etc. Bulgarians like most of Southern Europeans.. very enthusiastic, not shy at all, overall  Bulgarians seemed rather similar to Greeks for me. BTW older Bulgarians shake their heads for yes, and nod for no :)

Several of the streets have resident only parking.     $700 per month is cheap.     Somebody will eventually say it, but since I'm gay it won't be as offensive. West Hollywood is the center of the Los Angeles gayborhood.     Car thefts and car break-ins are going to be your biggest worries.

CyP7VMHHaa	It is not at all unusual for airlines to periodically change the colors on their aircraft. Northwest was on their third design since about the mid-1980's when Delta bought them. The reason is usually nothing more than a desire to have a fresh design after using the same one for many years. Occasionally, it's simply cost savings. A new design might be cheaper to apply and maintain than the old one.    New colors don't necessarily mean different aircraft. They are often the same aircraft with a fresh paint job.

Lot's of seagulls, rabbits, crab and all kinds of aquatic life.  This is also  near Kitty Hawk where the Wright Brothers completed their first  flights.  Hang Gliding and kite flying are among the most popular  activities in the Outer Banks.

FKApExj2aa	Hey :)    A perfect weekend break would be in the Lake District.  It's a such a beautiful place, with plenty to do.  You can relax and enjoy the scenery, walk around the beautiful little villages etc.  Or, you can go shopping in the towns, go fell walking etc.   You can just get away from it all. :)  If you want more information, visit http://www.lake-district.gov.uk/.  On this website, it can tell you about things to do, and basically all about the Lake District.  http://www.lake-district.com/     Another beautiful place is the Yorkshire Dales.  Like the Lakes, it's beautiful and historical, but with lots of things to do, such as exploring villages, visiting special events and looking around the towns.  For information, visit http://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/  It tells you all you need to know about the area.  To find out about accommodation, and food & drink, visit http://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/   It's such a great, unspoilt part of the UK, well worth a visit.    Finally, another great part of the UK is Devon.  Devon is unique, beautiful, rich in history, and with a great selection of things to do.   Whatever your interests, Devon could suit you, from the Arts and Craft centres, to walking in the hills, to visiting cities such as Exeter and Plymouth, to visiting Devon's beaches.  For more information, visit http://www.visitdevon.co.uk/  This tells you all about Devon, including accommodation etc.    Hope I answered your question.

JcZIjpU4aa	I would recommend coming down here anytime from mid december to march, that's when the summer time starts here. The funny thing is that summer is the cold season and winter is the hot one, reason being that one of summer's characteristics is the wind, it gets very windy, so its a very nice combination of sunny days but with a cold breeze. Also don't get me wrong, cold isn't like the cold people are used to in the US, its still warm and nice hehe.   About La Fortuna, its definitely worth visiting, I would say at this time of the year is when you have the highest changes of seeing a lava flow since the volcano's peak should be clear of clouds. Go to Baldi hotsprings instead of Tabacon (which is the famous one), Baldi is cheaper and in my opinion nicer, or you could se about staying at a hotel with access to the river.  Hope this helped!|`|CdBdP2ymaa	Feb or Mar   (Not as hot).|`|rgDLovFhaa	Depends, do you prefer monsoons or swarms of mosquitos...|`|vj6YpJn8aa	Daytime|`|IVSqQQzlaa	It's hot year round but it's better to go during the dry season from December to April.

They have a really active night life, the whole city is filled with so much history and culture, and the best thing is that the city feels so safe because the people there are really cool.  I went with a group of about 17 people that went there for the first time and everybody wanted to go back, so we planned another trip and most of us went back again.  A professor I went with is buying property out there after she went for the first time.  The city is known for sucking people in, so the population keeps rising and you may see some people from the US that just decided to move out there because it drew them in.  I would really recomend it, I've been there twice and I'm definitely going back again.|`|fUdBPu01aa	Make sure that you cross the border at 35,000 feet. The border is lawless and dangerous.

6qsTmMQaaa	It depends on when you're going. If you're going within the next few weeks, remember that it is still winter here, so bring warm clothes. I'd hold off on skirts, but you might want to bring one or two, just in case you are going to be going to a formal dinner location. Of course, if skirts aren't your fancy, you can wear slacks and a nice shirt.    Anyway, I'd bring a pairs of long pants. I prefer sweats or slacks, for jeans aren't that good at keeping out the cold air. If you have flannel lined jeans, great, bring those, but otherwise I'd hold back on jeans. But, if you wish to bring them, feel free. I'm not trying to hold you back from bringing anything; I'm just recommending things.    I'd bring a few sweaters, long sleeved shirts, or t-shirts if you wish, boots for the icy sidewalks, and maybe a nice wool hat. If you have any other accessories of warmth, such as earmuffs or gloves/mittens, I'd definitely bring those. It is rather cold in the city now.    The quantity of what you bring really depends on how long you are staying for. If you're staying for a week, I'd say bring about five pairs of regular clothes (pants, shirts, socks, underwear...the basics, really). If you are staying longer, feel free to bring more of what you need. Also remember that you will be able to shop for some great clothes in the city, so make sure you don't over pack. You should save room for some new clothes and souvenirs.    I hope you enjoy New York City!|`|HI0oQriqaa	bring a lot of money and warm clothes.|`|qhvQDcdfaa	warm clothes, its winter|`|Hsyjt3wTaa	bring a lot of money. Your going to want to buy A lot of things.

8Y7LQ6TGaa	Prague is a lot cheaper. Krakow is also great and cheap.      Krakw is a great place to visit.     Costs are about 1/2 what they are in places like France and Spain on the Euro.    Most things are a short walk from the old market square, so stay near there if you can. As such, the old town it is full of old churches, gorgeous buildings, and a very large and vibrant town square lined with cafes. There are lots of classical music concerts. Visit St. Marys Cathedral and the other great churches in the old town. Walk up to Wawel hill and visit the Royal Cathedral and Palace. Take day trips to O?wi?cim (Auschwitz) and to the Wieliczka Salt Mine, and perhaps to the Eagle-nest Castles in the mountains. Visit the Museums.     The most striking thing I remember from Krakw is the Krakw Hourly Trumpet Signal    Every hour a golden trumpet shows above Krakw's central Grand Square in the west window just below the spire of the higher, municipal tower of the St. Mary's Basilica. Then a characteristic trumpet signal, known and dear to every Pole, played by a live trumpet player, resounds all over the city's Old Town historical district. All of a sudden the melody comes to an abrupt end. The Krakw signal, or Hejnal Mariacki, dates back to the Middle Ages when it announced the opening and the closing of the city gates. The bugler also played it to alarm his fellow citizens whenever he saw a fire or enemy forces. And the melody's abrupt ending is said to commemorate a bugler shot through his throat by a Tatar archer in 1241.    My advice would be to rent a condo near the market square, inside the Planty. I had one last June, it was great, just a stone's throw from St. Mary's. The market square has several dozen outdoor cafe's, and there are hundreds of restaurants/bars within a block or two.    Drink lots of Zywiec.    Warsaw is worth a few days, for all of the WWII monuments, memorials, and  memories, Getto museums and memories, plus the old town. It's a 4 hour train  from Krakw/    Get the Rick Steves DVD on Eastern Europe, which covers these cities, plus others.        Prague is great, you can easily spend a week there.    Prague has the market square, charles bridge, and the castle hill with  St Vitus Cathedral and the palace a short tram ride away, or a longish  walk.    If you get a condo in the right place, you can walk to the major attractions in each city.

It's more interesting and nicer on the eye.|`|7gfNIajYaa	My best mate went to prague with her boyfriend there not so long back and said that she had  ablast,but it was very hot over there and that she was buying drinks to cool herself down every five minutes...Id go to Prague but Amsterdam would be fun too...I think the Euro situation isnt that annoying or anything,I think the thing you have to think about is how much you have to bring with you. Hope you have a blast wherever you choose XD|`|RNkMcDIWaa	Prague. For sure. No question.|`|EdKDmheXaa	I'm going to both! Why don't you do that?
ilz08Y3taa	I completely agree with you, I think it's very shallow of us to stop others from coming here to better their lives.  Everybody in America that isn't Native American is an immigrant anyways.  And I agree, there are many of them that work hard and do jobs that average Americans wouldn't do.  Of course there are some criminals, but there are criminals from everywhere and that's just a part of life.  There were criminals coming from Europe to Ellis Island years and years ago and there will continue to always be some criminals everywhere.    I think the reason immigrants (especially from Mxico) get so much riff from everyone has a lot to do with racism and false stereotypes.  I also think people are scared of them because they know that they will work hard and that they have the opportunity to disprove these stereotypes because of the education that America offers to everyone.  I'm sure there are many other factors, but these are a few.|`|eY8MNX6baa	I agree with u, i was an illegal immigrant but now i'm a permanent resident. we all have the goal in life to improve our lives so i don't thinks it's fair to take a way a person's ability to succeed. we aren't doing any harm to anyone and why can't we all just get along and come together regardless of race or legal staus? i wish all people would think like u but the thing is they don't and everyday it's getting harder for us. my grandpa died a few years ago and my mom wanted to go see him but she couldn't because she was illegal at that time and was afraid that if she left she would never come back. i mean The U.S. is a great country so ofcourse we want oppurtunities here. thank u for thinking like that u must be a great person|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	We need all the jobs we can get for our people. The illegals are also a big part of crime and gangs in this country and bring in a lot of illegal drugs. You need to do your home work about illegals. Statics say there are at least 15 million here illegally. That makes them criminals and why should they not have to follow the laws like every one else. Your home work is a little biased. There is nothing racist about it but as usual when some one says something you don't like play the old race card.

The only thing I can suggest to you is that you look to stay another night (Sunday nights are very, very inexpensive in comparison to Saturday nights) or, if you decide to go to AC, you can stay at a hotel right outside of the city (like in Absecon), their rates will be much lower than those of the casinos and it's only 3 miles away.|`|2fac0fc1df4b92965950b7dbc86606b1aa	There are a few hotels right near the Tropicana that are reasonable, and all you have to do is walk a block or 2.

86ea0f606c4289ae57db03fa34a6da0aaa	I'm sure this is perfectly acceptable behaviour in Nigeria. We live in an ethnically diverse society so you should be more sensitive to cultural differences.|`|4VrKKOwnaa	obviously your a country fan, if the nigerian man is 'threatening to rap'|`|AA11141136	Very difficult situation. You have to report this to whoever is responsible for managing the accommodation. You should also consider visiting your nearest police station to report threatening behaviour. The Police are unlikely to act, without more serious events happening, but you will have registered a complaint, which may be beneficial later, if things get more serious. The other thing, is to change your accommodation, if at all possible. I have a student friend who had trouble with a house mate. She, with the support of the other residents, told the landlord, that either he goes, or they all will. The landlord told the troublemaker to leave.|`|daJk1VePaa	if he grabs you stab the flipping golly wog in self defence!|`|7XIyslo5aa	Wtf?

In the meantime, I'd mess the whole place up while he was out and then leave permanently...surely there must be somewhere else for you to stay!    I think that when you are in danger the police can help you out with women's refuges to make sure you're safe...you really should be reporting this....    Apart from that, is the home you're in owned by the university you study with? If it is report him to them and see if they can help you move. Otherwise, is you want to leave it as it is, you'll just to try to find another flat share...this isn't a man by the sound of him-this is nothing but a COWARD and a BULLY.|`|NfE0iA8Baa	Report to the head of the student home about this incident.  If that doesnt get better , make a police report for records.  You may consider rally support from other students staying in the home in making the repot  ? If not consider changing to another place to stay.    you need to be safe before you can complete your studies|`|rdUBlF2Uaa	yeh you've come to the right place.

fc61095727fe8a17ac058f0c1b8e3bf2aa	That wont cover office space, phone lines, equipment, advertising etc. My suggestion would be to do something where you dont have a large initial investment and can work from a home office. You can do the home party type of businesses that sell make up, jewelry, tupperware or candles. If you are very sales oriented you can actually do well at this. Do you make anything that you can sell at craft fairs? Can you offer your services such  as IT, website development, tax preparation, payroll processing, office services etc? Can you do yardwork or walk and groom dogs or pet sit or house sit? I have no idea what your skills or interests are so all this is pretty general and based on others that I know who do these things as individual businesses.

h1IYS0dbaa	Switzerland is first of all a federal country with 26 cantons (similar to the states in the US). The cantons have their own government.    The federal state has a government called "Federal Council".    The Federal Council has 7 members. These members have all their own departments. The departments can be compared with ministries.    The 7 Federal Counselors have equal rights. One of the 7 Federal Counselors is the "President of the Confederation" for one year. He is so called "primus inter pares" (the first among equals). This means, the President of the Confederation is equal to his colleagues. His function is more representative. However, he doesn't have more rights than the other Federal Counselors.     The 7 Federal Counselors are together the government of Switzerland. They decide together. Politically (and not legally), a Federal Counselor has of course more power within his own department.    The Federal Counselors are elected by the members of the parliament. The Swiss Parliament has got 2 chambers. When there is an election of a Federal Counselor, they come together and vote together.    The Federal Council is the executive in the Swiss State.    The legislative power is in the hands of the parliament. However, the people of Switzerland have also a system of direct democracy (similar to the one in California). In such a system, the people has direct legislative powers.    Switzerland doesn't have a prime minister or a royal family. The only king that we have over here is Roger Federer.
CuH55g5daa	The Mandate of Heaven ( Pnyn: Tinmng) is a traditional Chinese philosophical concept concerning the legitimacy of rulers. Heaven would bless the authority of a just ruler, but would be displeased with a despotic ruler and would withdraw its mandate. The Mandate of Heaven would then transfer to those who would rule best.    The Mandate of Heaven had no time limitations, but instead depended on the just performance of the ruler. The Mandate does not require that a legitimate emperor be of noble birth, and in fact, dynasties were often founded by people of modest birth (such as the Han dynasty and Ming dynasty). The concept of the Mandate of Heaven was first used to support the rule of the kings of the Zhou Dynasty and later the Emperors of China. "Mandate of Heaven" was also the first era name of the Qing Dynasty.    Basically once a chinese emperor acquired the throne he states that he has the mandate of heaven or the approval of heaven to rule. He obviously does not, but to placate the people's fears or to calm them after internal strife he gives himself a second-to-godlike status. The people believe in superstitions and why can't the man who leads the country have the will of heaven?     Of course this does have its repercussions say if there was suddenly a major famine then the people could say the gods took away their favor from the emperor and then overthrow him. But generally, unless something goes terribly wrong the people believe the emperor has the will of the gods|`|ZVYY7nOlaa	The Mandate of Heaven is when god or heaven gives someone the divine right to become emperor of China. When a new emperor comes in power, peace and prosperity is restored. As its dynasty goes on, they become too comfortable. Tax and corruption increases. Soon they get overthrown by new people and they take over by the mandate of heaven. It's like a cycle.

Seriously?.. I guess it is human nature to enlist only in affairs that will "benefit" them.

Ergo, it is up to him to get a fair deal on his own end.|`|CuYQ57mjaa	I worked formerly for an agency under the US government that covered the regions in southwest pacific. The job was prestigious as I normally meet top man of every company.  It was my job to participate in the slate, select and award committees.  As projects were worth millions of dollars, we must pass the federal acquisition training.  And the art of negotiating must be learned with skill.      The people we met in the negotiating table would be the owner or authorized officers of the company who could decide with finality on the spot.       We were trained to know what we want out of the deal before going into negotiations. We had thorough knowledge of every line item of the bids. We listened and were open to suggestions and options.  We gave reasonable time for them to consider our final offers.    No one wanted the same thing out of a deal that a win-win situation was the desirable outcome. But at the end of every negotiation, it was always on our side the most favorable one.|`|esE0yImYaa	Win-win??? is a big question?    under negotiation situation each negotiator pushes the threshold of the other negotiating party. a buyer would only buy as much but would push the price at its lowest. the seller however would sell as much but pushes the prices to its highest. thus satisfaction is attained when a deal is conceived within a threshold. A buyer could buy without reaching the lowest price  and the seller could sell just above its asking price which may mean that the buyer wins and both parties are contented with the deal.    i say its "happy-happy" deal and not a  "win-win"    a compromise will never be a win-win because at the beginning you lose some.     truce is also not a win-win. no one wins which boils down to one point no deal is made until another negotiation. waste of time & resources    a good negotiation means a deal is made. a bad one is when no trade is made. (both parties loses- time & resources) thus negotiation is always done within a time frame.    i did some negotiations with San Roque Power Corp. San Roque, San Manuel Pangasinan. they were about to sue the construction company i was representing because different interpretation of the contract. i struck a deal that SRPC supplied the materials, we provide the labor. the company i represented lost financially but was happy about the deal. so is that a win-win or happy-happy?    my philosophy- push to strike a deal within the threshold.
g05wGcPhaa	Hop over to the driver seat and take control of the wheel. There's nothing better than taking road trips. Although there's not usually much to see if your taking a straight route it's always fun just to take control and run the road. Listen to country music on the way down. Although I'm not a big fan of country songs, I tend to get in the country mood when driving long trips lol.    If you want fun outside of the car then stop in Orlando if you past it along the way and go to the mall for a hour or two and look around, you might see something interesting.

wg0hmrvWaa	Well that's not easy, plus-que-parfait is not exactly a "swingy" tense ! it's a bit heavy...    I've been looking at a few usual suspects on this web site, without luck, maybe you can try on your own :    http://www.parolesmania.com/    However, I found an promising result with a "chanson fran?aise plus-que-parfait" entry in Google (one never knows !)  : it's a song called "Au plus-que-parfait" by David Koven on his latest album. I haven't been able to find the text or to listen to it yet, but it's bound to have some plus-que-parfait beyond the tittle !    http://www.musicme.com/David-Koven/album...    Enfin, I found another website on which you can search words from the text and not only the tittle. For instance I put "j'avais compris" and it gave me a list of songs (for instance this "M" song. I don't know the song but M is a very good artist. Maybe you can try a few verbs : j'avais perdu, ...etc    http://www.musikiwi.com/recherche/  http://www.musikiwi.com/paroles/m-quand-...    Good luck !    (I had fun, anyway)    Later on : I had such fun I just couldn't stop. "Les Cornichons" by Nino Ferrer looks fun and has at least 2 sentences with PQP (avait oubli, avait travaill).

It is also a question of reverse-discrimination. There have been many large-scale genocides since the late 19th century,the worst being in the Belgian Congo with an estimated 20 million victims. No one has suggested that it should be illegal to deny that these genocides occured. To extend an unlawful privilige to one group naturally begs the question why Africans,Armenians,Cambodians and Ukrainians are not extended the same privilege. Right now a new wave of anti-Holodomar propaganda has been unleashed,claiming the Ukrainian staged-famine genocide of 1933-34 simply never occured. This is outlandish but truth always wins out. I don't feel threatened by it and I do not see how any infringement of freedom of expression can be tolerated without setting a dangerous precedent for other and future limitations.|`|Ic8FLXm5aa	crime or not it simply doesn't matter.

You also might want to go to the dollar store and get a rain coat. That is way cheeper than if you are on the island and it is raining. I know in St Thomas we had to pay $7 for a rain coat you could get at the dollar store. I usually take a plug in strip because there is limited plugs in the cabin. I also take a fan because sometimes the air does not get as cold as I would like it. Hope this helps.

Don’t tense up or fight it, but instead, let your body sway with the aircraft movements.<br>  <br>  *Keep distracted. Watch the movie even if it’s bad or you have seen it already. Read a book or do a crossword puzzle. Do anything that keeps your mind occupied and not dwelling on morbid possibilities.<br>  <br>  Avoid coffee or other caffeine products as an overly hyper state of mind will only exacerbate your anxiety. <br>  <br>  *Listen to peaceful and calming music. Your mind tends to wander and hear sounds that either don’t exist or are perfectly normal flight noises.<br>  <br>  The rubber band technique. Wear a rubber band around your wrist and if you feel yourself becoming agitated, snap the rubber band against your skin. Apparently, the pain is a reality bite, and takes the mind off the turbulence.<br>  <br>  Breathe deeply as often as you can, and remember that the sick bag in front of you can be used as an anti-hyperventilating device as well.<br>  <br>  ...and you'll enjoy Canada. it's a wonderful country.|`|yzKrwvxSaa	dont jump out of the plane|`|MQVmh5hiaa	You should take a music player<br>  <br>  Electronic<br>  <br>  Or Fall asleep|`|i47AGNpJaa	Bring your Bible along and read scripture.<br>  <br>  And it's understandable to be afraid.

Just need to carpool more and have better transit.<br>  <br>  I am laughing that you think that we can simply drive from Toronto to Arctic Canada. What would I do with my dog sled then, if it was that easy?<br>  <br>  You mention if I wnated to go to Florida, Texas, or California.  Why would I want to go there except to see old retirees, see rodeos, or Arnold Swarzenegger respectively?<br>  <br>  There are much better ways for the US to save money - such as stop producing spray cheese.

9NpXU7D2aa	well you can't pick what building you are in. you can choose if you want a standard room or a preferred room. the only difference is that the preferred room is closer to the main lobby, dining and shopping area of the resort. its also closer to the buses. the rooms themselves are all uniform.  so if you can handle a little bit longer of a hike (maybe a couple minutes further to walk) and want to save the extra money it would cost for preferreded room then you should pick a standard room.|`|I6pmPb1Baa	ahhhh i love that resort!  i've stayed there before.  its always great to get in a building close to the bus stops.  but other than that theres really no differences between the buildings.|`|Gq0t3ERIaa	If you want to be close to the marina/food court etc. building 14 (Alligator Bayou) is closest.

You can always request a room or building but you have no guarantee of getting it. Moderate resorts have standard rooms, water view rooms and King beds. There are no preferred rooms at any of the moderate or deluxe resorts, only the value resorts have preferred rooms.    Linda  http://wdwtravels.com/Linda.aspx

The various major sights which are close by the river look particularly lovely when illuminated at night.    There's a very rich nightlife and whats good for you will depend on your own tastes.    My own favorite hangout is Aux Trois Mailletz at 56 rue Galande in the 5th arr. There's a cabaret in the basement and a piano par on the ground floor. There's a friendly crowd of both locals and visitors. The "regulars" are very welcoming and its the type of place where musicians come after they've finished working their own gigs.    I'm also fond of the Piano bar in the basement of Harry's Bar at 5 rue Danou. George Gershwin composed "American in Paris" on the piano. Harry's bartenders invented the Bloody Mary and the Sidecar among other cocktails. Its the place to go and pretend you're Hemingway.    Le Petit Journal at 71, boulevard Saint-Michel is a great little jazz club that tends toward Dixieland style jazz. ( http://pagesperso-orange.fr/claude.phili... )    Of course there are a lot of dance clubs. You might want to check out Showcase (http://www.showcase.fr/) which is under the Pont Alexandr III.

Marrakech is not in Arabic but is coming for Tamazight... Amur Akush or "Land of God". Marrakech has been founded by Youssef Ibn Tachfine...

fPbjSNEHaa	Restaurants in Paris and London are very good but expensive. Accommodation can be expensive and getting around is also a killer.<br>  <br>  If you are travelling on a budget in London I would stick to pub meals or some Asian restaurants which seem to be less pricy. Staying in hostels is cheap too, but it depends what you are looking for. For more privacy you should start looking online for cheap rooms in hotels.<br>  <br>  The Eurostar can be cheap if you book early, alternatively there are several air services between the two cities that offer good air fares. It pays to do your research early on. Ask around.|`|MpXPtvHtaa	I grew up in Europe and first let me congratulate you in advance--you're sure to have a great time.  There are a lot of very reasonable package deals to Europe (though be warned the summer is high season for London and Paris).  You can often get a better rate if you book a package deal, ie. air, hotel, and rental car combined.  However, you can also search for each individually if you have the time.  I would say that you'll probably be better off with renting a hotel since you're only going to be in London and Paris for 2 weeks (divided by the two cities).  Most people don't want to go through the hassle of renting out their flat or apartment for extremely short term periods.  If you go through a "Letting"/ Rental Service that DOES indeed find you Short Term Rentals, it will usually come at a premium.  In which case, why not take advantage of the amenities and pampering of a hotel.  If economy is what you're after, by the way, remember that they are all levels of hotels and even some cute bed and breakfasts to chose from.  Restaurants are definitely NOT cheaper for the most part, although you may benefit from the recent decline in the Pound and the Euro related to the US dollar.  I'd be happy to consult with you further on the matter, as I'm both an Uber seasoned traveler--I've also lived all over the world.|`|NRkmiftEaa	Everything in paris was expensive so good luck....<br>  <br>  London however, is different.

There is alot of daytime activity in the day aswell. I was there 3 years ago and really enjoyed my holiday.     I found this on Jet2.com    Playa de Las Americas is notorious for its crazy nightlife and although this is the place to go if you want to party there is also so much more to this buzzing resort including great restaurants, shops and watersports. With regular cheap flights to Tenerife from the UK with Jet2.com, you can be enjoying a long or short break away in the Canary Islands in no time at all.     The resort has beautiful beaches, three natural and three manmade that get very busy during the summer months with holidaymakers looking to top up their tan and try some watersport activities like jet skiing, windsurfing and banana boat rides. There are also a few places to go diving and snorkeling for all levels from beginners to experienced divers. Alternatively, if you prefer to stay above the water, you can also catch a boat that takes you on a whale and dolphin watching trip which offers a fantastic day out for everyone as you sail alongside graceful whales and playful dolphins. Experience this fantastic attaction of the Canaries with cheap flights to Tenerife from Jet2.com.        Playa de Las Americas really comes alive at night and you will find every kind of pub, bar and club including traditional Canarian drinking hotspots as well as Irish bars, sports bars and cocktail bars. Playa de Las Americas is a Mecca for partying with an array of clubs with some of the most popular being Bobbys, Metropolis and Tramps. The infamous Veronicas Strip with a host of great bars and clubs including San Rafael is for the more hardcore clubbers. Many of the nightclubs are open until 5am so that holidaymakers really can dance till dawn. The area known as The Patch is a good place to go to wind down in the evening less busy than Veronicas but still with a party atmosphere, it has a range of restaurants, bars and cabaret shows that will suit all tastes. World famous chain Hooters has now opened a bar in Tenerife, perfect for stag trips to the island! Jet2.com offer a group booking facility, perfect for cheap flights to Tenerife for stag or hen weekends!    If you fancy a night away from the bars and are feeling lucky then why not try your hand at one of the two casinos. As well as great nightlife there is also great food to be sampled in Playa de Las Americas with every style of cuisine on offer including Tapas, traditional English, Italian, Canarian, Spanish and Mexican, the list is endless and you may never want to go home!    Hope this helps, am off to Ibiza again this year. if you could of went in the summer months i would of recomended Ibiza.|`|XtxL6PAKaa	For a clubbing holiday I'd say Benidorm. I've been so many times and never get bored it's crazy. The weather will be picking up in April but not too hot as their summers can be, and the bars and clubs are amazing, and very lively. Check out the British Square area! Also for in the day there's the water park and the animal park just up on the hill, with monkies and parrots and a free dolphin show!    Playa del ingles isn't really a clubbing resort. It's the biggest resort on Gran Canaria and is very nice, loads of shopping, amazing weather (better than benidorm) but you would prob be bored after a week of the bars etc. And the timeshare touts, arg!

DcVoq5Tuaa	Fulsher is nice but growing at a very fast rate, Houston will run into Fulsher before you know it. Sealy is a little bigger than Fulsher but about the same size as Katy (yes I know the town, your the real Katy, not what's on the Mason Road area). A little further southwest of houston is East Bernard. It's about a 45 minute drive into Houston's west side (1-10/dairy Ashford area). It's a small farming community that takes pride in family. The school district has less than 1000 kids in the entire district and has been one of the state Explementary schools for the last 5 yrs. Class sizes are less than 20 kids per class, so there is plenty of teacher 1-1. PE is mandatory for all student through 12 grade daily. Not just twice a week but every day. The boy scouts/cub scouts/girl scouts are very popular out here and most of the town supports any and every one. FFA is really big. Majority of the student's that graduate from here, head on to top colleges. Currently the town's population is 2300 people and they are mostly very young kids or older family's. When you drive into the town there is a sign that reads "A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE" welcomes you. The townspeople are very friendly and go out of their way to watch over each other. Hard to believe in this day and age, you can actually leave your house unlocked and the windows open and no one will think twice about it.|`|pS5PhXtiaa	DONT STAY IN RICHMOND|`|TkUF1PI4aa	You can also try Seguin or San Marcos..that's closer to Austin

lcj1AKt1aa	The weather is generally hot throughout the year.  The best way to get a tan is not to lie on your stomach all day. You will still get one but it is best to go into the sea and then come back out.  The more often you do this the better. Please remember to put on sunblock to protect yourself from the harmful rays of the sun.
xc6GcEJ6aa	okay well personally i would recommend Mazatlan, San Carlos, Cabo, Cancun, Anything in the yucatan pininsula.  As for the cheapest prices for hotel and air planes, usually travelocity.com has the best prices and combo packages that include transportaion hotel and air fare. When going to mexico always take cash, theree will be places where you can change the U.S. Dollar into Pesos. That way you are going to be able to get the prices that are in pesos and give exact change. I would also recommend. As you run out of cash, i would recommened taking out enough money in cash as you need for the trip, since i don't believe U.S. Credit cards will work in Mexico. Although, you cannot take more than 10,000 dollars in any form across the border either way, going in or coming back. So be careful! I hope i helped! =).|`|YEjhx5Mvaa	the best way i know how to answer your question is as follows: try and bring most cash and debit/credit for a few things ideal places to go are cancun, progresso and cozumel. I have recently been to the last two and they are really nice, sometimes you will run into prices that can be a tad high all i can say is do a lot of research and keep asking around for information good luck and have fun :)
WkbEAvZPaa	Advantages - No sales tax for customers, a lot of traffic so a lot of customers<br>  <br>  Disadvantages - You will have a lot of competition (depending on your store), I think property taxes may be high, rent is competitive.|`|5fkqsnBJaa	Approximately 2/3 of your customer base will be the oppressed peoples from Massachusetts, those desperately trying to find a little relief from the confiscatory taxation policies of the self-righteous, socialist thieves that run this state. Very soon, the only people that will be left in Mass. will be the pointy-headed poindexters in Cambridge, welfare recipients and illegal aliens.<br>  <br>  For you, the bad news is that that Deval Patrick, that Cadillac driving thug that runs Massachusetts, is considering erecting toll booths at the New Hampshire border to further shake-down Massachusetts residents that have the audacity to travel out of state in search of a few reasonably priced necessities of life. (Not to mention...cheap booze, cheap cigs, cheap gas and the priceless freedom that is NH is famous for!). If his tolls are too high, it could very well lessen your main customer base.<br>  <br>  Anyway...good luck dude in your business endeavors.<br>  <br>  Always remember that the most beautiful word in the English language is PROFIT.

e01ewfGYaa	The time with the highest risk of pregnancy is right after your period. That is when the new egg drops out of your ovary and sets in your cervix. That being said, there is always a risk of pregnancy. It doesn't matter if you are on your period or off of it. If there is an egg present and sperm enters it you will be pregnant. My best advice to give you is to get on birth control, if you can, and use a spermicidal lubricated condom.

The average price for a 3/2 in LA is about $400,000. However, there are a lot of factors that go into this. Let's say you find a house in a decent area, that was foreclosed and is now selling for $375,000. Hopefully, the house doesn't need too much work, but many times it needs a lot of work. In order to buy a house, you need a down payment, then you take out a loan, called a mortgage. The difference between rent and a mortgage is simply who owns the property. If you pay rent, the landlord owns the property. If you are paying a mortgage, you own the property, and are paying off the loan. It is always better to own than to rent. However, many people have trouble coming up with the down payment, and qualifying for the loan. Once you turn 18 and get a bank account, you get a credit score assigned to you based on how you pay your debts. If you have a good credit score, you qualify for a lower interest rate. However, there's still the down payment issue. You would need to come up with about 20%, or about $75000 in this case. Then you pay off the rest of the loan. The amount is based upon the interest rate. Right now, people with good credit can get a 30-year loan for less than 5%. That would be about $1600 per month or so.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps

DltjwN00aa	People in japan tend to be a lot more polite, in stores for example. They treat customers with alot of respect unlike america.  But in some ways, they are not as polite if they have no relation to you.  Like they don't hold doors open for people as much or help you out if you have a problem on the street.
AA10049824	Because buses and trams are more cost effective for a city that's full steep inclines and mountainous terrain. <br>  <br>  It is no coincidence that the BART and Caltrain lines go through the flatest part of San Francisco. Because if they tried to build it anywhere else, it would (1) cost a fortune and (2) the constant changes in elevation will slow down the trains. <br>  <br>  In fact, that's the engineering problem they're having with the little branch "Central Subway" line they're building from Powell Street to the Wharf (with additional stations in Chinatown and North Beach). In every computer simulation, Chinatown's hills causes the trains to move almost as slowly as a bus.<br>  <br>  The whole point of having rapid transit is speed. If your fancy multi-billion dollar train line can't get passengers to their destination faster than a bus, then you will have wasted a lot of money for nothing.|`|eCjx7kLAaa	Both BART and Caltrain were designed as commuter services to get people downtown.  That's it.  BART in particular was built to ease traffic on the Bay Bridge commuting into SF from the East Bay.  Hence, there are tons of stops along Market Street, and the continuation down towards the airport, but nowhere else.  Likewise with Caltrain, it was the old rail line into SF, and therefore it was never meant to be used as a way to get around the city, just a way to get there.|`|AA10522987	San Francisco is filled with steep hills.  It just isn't feasible to build a train in many parts of the city.  Where it is, service is provided by BART, MUNI light rail, or Caltrain.  The MUNI light-rail lines are designated by a letter instead of a number.

klOP21xTaa	The health care system in Belgium is funded through the state sickness fund. There are four tiers of operation consisting of central government, national associations, federations of local societies, and local mutual aid societies. The Belgian government believes that this power sharing motivates each local fund to work hard to attract and satisfy its members.<br>  <br>  Enrolment<br>  In Belgium, health insurance is mandatory. Basic cover is provided by the national social security system, which is known as the mutualité or ziekenfonds.<br>  <br>  Contributions are paid by both employers and employees and they amount to 7.35 % of each person’s gross salary. The employee must pay 3.55 % directly from their wages and employers must pay the remaining 3.8 %. Self-employed people have to pay the full 7.35% on a quarterly basis. Cover is automatically provided for unemployed dependent family members and children up to the age of 18. The unemployed, old age pensioners and people on long-term sickness benefit or maternity leave do not have to pay healthcare contributions. Foreigners immigrating to Belgium without jobs must produce proof of private health insurance in order to obtain their residence permit.<br>  <br>  For historic reasons, some healthcare funds are limited to members of various religious, political or professional groups, but most funds are open to everyone. Each fund charges the same basic contribution as well as providing similar benefits, but some take longer than others do to make repay the fees.<br>  <br>  People have to wait six months before they are able to claim benefits, unless they previously belonged to a health scheme as a dependant or if they were covered by a state health care plan in another EU country for at least six months before their arrival in Belgium.<br>  <br>  People have to pay a certain amount of their medical bill themselves and they usually pay fees directly to their doctor or the hospital. They must submit their receipts for reimbursement and the money is then paid directly into the claimant’s bank account.<br>  <br>  Most Belgians take out supplementary health insurance to cover the portion of their bill, which is not reimbursed. Many employers provide supplementary health insurance cover as an employment benefit.|`|SOgaE3otaa	It is fully covered. The USA is the only developed country stupid enough to not have a normal healthcare system.

That's the way it is when people come from all over the world to live on an island. The night life is interesting and there is far more choice of what to do and where to go than on most Caribbean islands. There are people who don't find that they fit in there, but such persons are few and far between and most people love it in the Cayman Islands and find that they make plenty of friends there. Here is a little information: http://www.destination.ky/    One particularly good thing about Cayman is how easy it is to visit neighbouring countries: apart from regular flights to and from Cuba, Jamaica the Bahamas and Honduras (as well as the USA and the UK), there are frequent excursions to less usual destinations to coincide with public holidays.|`|fv2GAAdPaa	http://www.caymanislands.ky/    The Cayman Islands ahs a high cost of living but that is not generally a big problem because the pay over there is really GOOD!!

dpKntiZoaa	Moving to anywhere is a challenge, so this should be more of a concern than to the fact that it is to Bosnia.  Speaking as someone who has lived in 3 countries to date, then I would just say to make as much preperation as possible.     Then when you are there, try to learn the language by finding a class (then you also get an instant network of potential friends in the same situation as you), and try to embrace the environment - ie keep looking for the positives rather than the negatives.    Staying at home with a young baby is wonderful, and if this is an option which allows it - then jump at the chance (speaking as a mum of a 2 year old and a 1 year old!).    Then onto Bosnia.  My husband is Bosnian and we go there 1/2 times every year, and I love the country.  It is certainly not all sunshine and roses.  eg, driving over there requires a brave heart as they overtake other cars like raving maniacs.  However daily life is very enjoyable.  The food, weather, environment is great.    You didn't mention where you will be re-locating to?  My brother-in-law works in Sarajevo and it is a lovely city.  Great shopping, lots of cafe's, places to eat, and a very vibrant city    Personally I would jump at the chance, and if you want to Email me about anything, then feel free.|`|iOo9MAxJaa	Um, no, not really.   I think the whole family being together is a great thing. Bosnia, or any other country, is what you make of it.   So it's not a bad idea to move to Bosnia with your baby.|`|V5xHaIAcaa	Do yourself a big favor.    Call the U.S. Department of State and talk to the foreing service officer in charge of the Bosnia desk.    If the State Department gives you any crap, call your local Senator and/or Congressman for help.    The US Govt is one of the best sources of information there is -  if you can get the lazy bastards off their ***...    I know I used to work there    Good luck|`|E14cuDlZaa	No. Its an Opportunity if you are not a European. However be warned there is a terrible economic crisis in Bosnia at the moment!|`|gmaCvh00aa	I don't think so!  This is an opportunity.  Go with your husband--you can be a family in Bosnia as well as here, and your whole world will be expanded, and your baby will grow up with parents who took a chance to do something different.    There is a whole rigamarole ahead in bringing the dogs.  Quarantines and waiting times.  It took my friend about two months to get her dogs over there when she moved to Ireland last year.     Friend did the same thing, by the way.  Husband had a chance at a good project for the next three years, and they have a 10 year-old, but my friend decided to go for it, quit her job, found a school for her daughter in the Irish city where they are living, and sent for the doggies.  She loves it.|`|5biz8Ku5aa	ok, from past experience, don't ask the US governement anything about Bosnia. 1st they will blatenly warn you not to go. 2nd, they will think you are suspicious.    my father is doing the same type of travel/work as your husband. my dad's wife (my stepmom) has moved place to place with him every 3-4 years. the balkans are a fine place at the moment, because there isn't too much unrest.    my stepmom, for example, loves lebanon and she has a 3 yr old toddler.     take good care of your child, and enter him/her into a private school. Bosnia is a good balkan nation, don't hesitate to travel and when your child is older, have him/her learn the local language.    best of luck with your new location! make memories!|`|3hckozHNaa	It doesn't seem like a bad idea at all! You will probably love being in a new Country, and it will be a new, fun, experience. There is no reason you shouldn't go! Make sure you take lots of pictures and record some videos so everyone can remember the fun time in Bosnia!! :)

67308019752e42f4a93ef3f821283a30aa	Most hotels in France have either someone working at the reception on a 24 hour basis or an access code which is communicated to you once you have reseved your room, allowing you to enter the hotel and room without assistance.  It pays however, to contact the hotels by phone, e-mail and enquire about which system their operate.|`|CyP7VMHHaa	Pretty much any hotel that has a 24 hour front desk will do it. You have to give them a credit card guarantee to ensure that you will show up and that they haven't held the room for nothing. If you fail to show up, they will charge you for the room.|`|10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	You do not mention how you are travelling and getting there, and one has to assume it is by car and ferry.  Here are the principal Calais hotels, with location maps. There are others, but reviews are mixed.  http://en.venere.com/hotels_calais/?ref=...  In this list some hotels like Campanile and Bonsai include "24/24 reception" in their description.  http://www.calais-hotels-guide.com/  You also have to bear in mind car parking if you are arriving by road , or proximity to public transport if you are not.    Usually in France only small private hotels have no night porters and  give people a key or a code to let themselves in if they want to come in at night, but larger establishments have round the clock reception, especially in Calais where many people arrive by road to take the ferry or disembark from one. Since ferries operate round the clock  and there is so much traffic coming and going between France and the UK that takes place in the middle of the night, hotels in or close to Calais are geared for people arriving at odd hours.   I suggest that you pick a hotel that suits you and give them a call or send them an e-mail. Everyone speaks English at reception in those hotels and  your queries will be answered without problems.|`|05b3af152124c775d5129804746bbc06aa	Lots do, but they are pretty basic.

AksA9h3Aaa	Well depending on what country you're coming from, that depends on how strong your currency is at the moment.   You should check out the major banks website for Australian dollar exchange. Or head into a bank and ask them to explain exactly what you need to know.    You will need to save quite a lot of money, when you think about living costs (food, rent, daily necessities) as well as spending money. Also if there is a fee to pay your university/school to be able to the study abroad.    You could start a savings/investment account that you're only allowed to put money into (and not open it until you've saved enough for the program).|`|b0e41a0938c16904213d76c5d126edffaa	You might like to re-compose your question.

qBPLacWAaa	Check out Augusta! Gorgeous Area, probably the best school systems outside of Atlanta (I would think) an hour away from some beautiful beaches.

You have shopping and activities around the area, you are great there, and an hour away from the beach and 15 minutes away from South Carolina.

xIHgTqVhaa	Yes. Not only is it possible but there are quite a few single moms flying.     It's a great job with kids because you are home so much more than your 9-5 friends. The only problem is that the hours are not regular. You will need support. Relatives, friends, even the kids' dads help out. One coworker told me how they didn't have any custody arrangement. When she was out-of-town, he took them. When she was there, they were with her. End of story!     BUT, and here is the catch, you do need to be gone for several weeks for initial training. You need to ask yourself if your children can handle it. Ask, but I'm not sure about weekends. I flew with two airlines and one had daily training for a month, the other had 6 weeks with weekends off.     You will need to live in your base location. Commuting with children is tough (the Voice of Experience here!) I only had to fly an hour to get to my base but with a small child and a husband who doesn't have fixed hours, it worked. If I had been missing any of the above, it wouldn't have. I also saw the end of it when I got a transfer to a closer base.     Ask about reserve. If your base location will mean 20 years on reserve before you can hold a "line" (fixed schedule), this is not ideal.    Don't ask about bases at the interview but find out during the process how much choice you get. Typically, you might end up somewhere you don't want but after 6 months, you can transfer.     Try to track down a F/A who works for the airline you want to apply to and see if she'll answer some questions. A few F/A's answered mine and helped me, as I than years later, talked to several wannabe's myself. They will give you the "straight story" and yes, we're happy to speak with a serious applicant, even if they're a friend of our second cousin-once-removed's former coworker...    I will say that it's easier to get this job with small children than older kids who have activities, friends and school. With small children, you can move and change things more easily. They're more flexible and you don't have to worry about drugs, grades and getting in with the "wrong crowd". I have to say that my coworkers with teenagers had more problems with work than those of us with babies and young children.    Working with kids is a balance when you're married, single, in the airlines or any other job. Your children have needs that must be met. If you can find a way to keep them. Be creative, look into all your options and decide whether it will work for you.    Good luck!|`|7fJsXVE6aa	Well, I guess you would have to leave the children with a relative everytime you went on a trip or bring the kids with you but i doubt they would enjoy that..  I hope this helped you! =)|`|km9cQNAXaa	Don't tell the airline about the kids. Simple. It's not their problem.

jjMBNaZBaa	You can get a lot of other people's opinions on what they think you should do but only YOU know what you would enjoy most.    Cruises have a lot of planned activities for their guests - both on the ship and while in port. They have dancing, exercise, spas, art auctions, night club acts, etc. onboard ship and while in port you can shop, visit parks, museums, beaches, etc. Cruises are great for people who want to be entertained.    Fiji is much more laid back. It's the "soft coral" capital of the world and also has beautiful hard coral and fabulous colorful fish like anemone fish (Nemo's). Snorkeling and diving are truly amazing there - you could learn to dive if you don't already know how. The Fijian people are very nice and friendly and there are lovely white sand beaches to visit. The water temps range from mid-70's in their winter to mid-80's. Personally, I love Fiji and would choose it over a cruise any day. But everyone is different.    Another consideration is when you would be traveling. June - November is Hurricane season in the Caribbean while November -March is the rainy season in Fiji (when they can have cyclones too). If you think a cruise is more your style but are concerned about hurricanes, how about a cruise through the Greek Isles or even Hawaii?    Anyway, you should figure out what type of vacation you would enjoy most and then choose one that suits you best.     Good luck - and have a wonderful 16th birthday Jessica!|`|OIhRjhbaaa	Vsit the Boracay island, Philippines or El Nido, Palawan, Philippines!|`|lADq4dNdaa	go to your travel agent and check out some holiday brochures.  fiji is awesome!!!!!  altho i would love to go to carribeann too...  fiji is very laid back with a whole other exciting culture to learn about. and everyone is super friendly.  also laws are pretty relaxed there so you could go up to the bar, have a cocktail,etc.  i guess on a cruise you wouldnt really be spending much time with the locals, or in the country...  i say fiji!!! have fun!!!  lucky you...|`|6462e7ffbd1d8c30e6d5968893eb47d7aa	fiji

Check out tripadvisor.com for travelor photos and trip reports  toss out the top and bottom 20% and thats is about what to expect    Going at the end of March is usually a NO NO because of springbreakers.. but since its adults only .. it should be ok    By the way.. it might have changed.. but the big hot tub by the spa used to be left running till midnight and NO ONE went there.. great to eat dinner early.. get a bottle of vino and enjoy all to yourselves    Enjoy -     Another tip - write an email to the resort explaining your 20 year and about all the great things you have read about the property.. they WILL take note    Most of all CONGRATS!!!

It is also a great gastronomic area that has a rich history so it receives many visitors both from France and abroad.  It has a good network of canals that link to France's main rivers and which have brought added prosperity to the region.  For more information see this:  http://www.burgundy-canal.com/burgundy.h...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundy  Just as piece of interesting information: snails from the region (escargots de  Bourgogne) are enormous and considered a delicacy all over France, and mustard is a speciality that is made in Dijon. Some of the best French cheeses are made in Burgundy.  Besides the many interesting touristic towns and villages,  there are abbeys and castles,  fantastic museums, including  the "F1 and F3 Racing Museum and Test Track," where you can learn to drive a Formula 1 racing car on the F3 Grand Prix. There also are balloons that fly over the countryside from which tourists can take photos and see the countryside from the air.

lcj1AKt1aa	I am not seeing any mention of lilies in Bahamas only water lilies. All you have to do is make a request to not have any within the bouquet.    Common Flowers of the Bahamas    Most of the archipelago of The Bahama Islands owe their color of flora to people rather than nature. When you see a lovely tree like the Pink Poui or Silk Cotton raising its blooms to the heavens or one like the Frangipani wafting fragrances over you on evening breezes, chances are about 1,000 to 1 that man planted and nursed it to bloom.    YELLOW ELDER  Tecoma Stans, stenolobium stans  Curve to Fort Charlotte  There are some plants however, which are dispersed by wind, water or animal (yellow elder, periwinkle, coconut, pawpaw, sot of the bush medicines) Sunshine seems to be captured in the bright golden bells of the National flower of The Bahamas - The Yellow Elder. These bushes and small trees grow up to 30 feet. The children of The Bahamas, Florida and Caribbean, call it "Plopper" because just before the blooms flare open, bag-like buds pop noisily if squeezed. Northern South America, Yellow Elders are completely naturalized in all Bahama Islands. These Beauties spring up almost like weeds forming wild thickets often on neglected land under adverse conditions.  HIBISCUS  Hibiscus rora-sinenesis  Almost every color imaginable of Hibiscus blooms in the Bahama Islands gardens all year around. Their showy flowers-particularly hybrids come in single and double types, which can be cut and left out of the water without wilting. All blooms last at least one day (and usually only one day) whether on the bush or cut and left out of water. The most popular colors are red and pink.  CHENILLE PLANT RED HOT CAT-TAILS MONKEY TAILS  Adastra Gardens' gate  This plant is called Chenille. It has velvety tails of dark reddish-purple; fur or chenille like blooms may hang down as much as 18 inches from the green heart shaped leaves. Tassels are made up of flowers without petals, which are unbelievable until seen on these small bushes. Two common names for this plant are "Red Hot Cat-Tails" and "Monkey Tails".  PINK POUI  Xaviers School yard  One of the more magnificent flowering trees found in The Bahamas is the Pink Poui. It blooms when only three feet tall on up to when it is sixty feet tall. When the blossoms fall, they lay a carpet of color on the ground.  ED BOTTLE BUSH  Quite a number in the Golden Gates Food Store yard  The Red Bottle Bush tree has weeping willow type branches and are adorned with bristly cylindrical spikes two to four inches long of red flowers that look exactly like bristles used to clean baby bottles-except they are scarlet.  MORNING GLORY -BUSH  The Morning Glory has large showy trumpet-shaped flowers that are rather flimsy in the wind. It is found everywhere and is commonly called Potato Bush or Potato Tree. Few people know its botanical name.  CREPE MYRTLE  The Crepe Myrtle has light pink clusters four to nine inches long, which adorn bushes and trees of this plant family. It is believed that this plant came here originally from India or China.  THE OLEANDER  The Oleander has clusters of pink, rose, red white tones between blooms at the end of tall shrubs-usually seven to ten feet. Although a member of the periwinkle family, all parts of the Oleander are poisonous if eaten. Smoke from burning Oleander bushes is also harmful.  ROYAL POINCIANA Poinciana Drive Government House  The Royal Poinciana ignites the skies with flames of red in the summer months. Its scarlet long and clawed-petal blossoms measure three (3) to four (4) inches across and are touched with yellow and white. The seeds of the pod are used in the creation of native jewelry, while the unopened pods make a very effective musical instrument.  FRANGIPANI  Fragrance plus beauty caused this small "FRANGIPANI" tree to be a favorite. The most popular places for planting this tree are near churches and cemeteries, hence it is commonly referred to by the name, "Temple Tree".  BOUGAINVILLAEA  An incredibly colorful vine is the BOUGAINVILLAEA. It is probably the most wisely planted ornamental plant in the tropics. The vivid magentas, purples, red and salmons you see are not real flowers, but rather, comes from three (3) bracts, which surround tinny flowers. The texture of these bracts also gives them the name of "PAPER FLOWERS"  ORCHID TREE  The corsage of the orchids seem to grow on trees when these come into profuse bloom and in fact, they are commonly referred to as "poor man's orchid".  POINSETTIA  Originally from Mexico  The Poinsettia is recognized universally as a symbol of Christmas. The flaming beauties bloom over a six (6) month period in protected areas.  PASSION FLOWER Passiflvra cucruba  This is a climbing plant found over shrubs in a bush. The name is derived from the Lord's crucifixion; the three stigmas are said to represent the three nails and the corona, a crown of thorns. There are over three hundred species of the Passion Flower found in the Carib

qq5nceCXaa	Get an iamsterdam card, this gets you into loads of museums and stuff free, and has a ticket for the trams so you can get round.  One thing it doesn't cover is the Anne Frank house, but you can get timed tickets for that from the tourist info near the train station so you don't have to queue.    It has passes for boat trips on the canals, discount on cycle trips, vouchers for eateries, all sorts.    Do the big Museums, Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum and so on, also try some of the smaller places, the Houseboatmuseum and the Amstelkring are interesting.  Hire a bike and go round some of the bits of the city off the beaten path.    Don't spend all your time in the coffee shops, unless you really do want to spend the weekend wasted, and remember that if you do want to indulge that it can take a while to kick in and you can get paranoid,    The red light district is over hyped, but remember that the stag does will be around and there'll be a chunk of drug dealers asking if you want anything for the weekend.    Lots of good restaurants, Time out was the best guide book for tracking stuff down.    Visit the Chopperdome to see how the Dutch really do bikes! I so want a project 346 basman, but the exchange rate's going the wrong way!

xrkKMIwfaa	Yee gods!   The border has had many problems on the MEXICAN side but the answers sound like Laredo is the wild west with constant gun-play up and down the streets!   Your friend, being Mexican should have no problems getting across, I suspect he has done it before.  I live a half mile away from the border here in Laredo and we have no more problems than a medium size city anywhere.   Again, the problems are in Mexico, not just "the border area".  It will take you about 2.5 hours between S.A. and Laredo.  The top city for crime in the US is St. Louis, in the good ol mid~west....come to Laredo, where its safe!!  : )|`|eY8MNX6baa	MAybe You Should ask the mexican consulate because anything can happen at the border, especially if your alone...|`|hyHvG1Olaa	There are many ways to get from Monterrey to Dallas that are safer than driving to the border.  The border is extremely dangerous and even the south Texas natives do not go near the border.  I am from McAllen and my entire family avoids the border like the plague.  Your boyfriend can take a bus, there are numerous bus lines that run daily from major Mexican cities to major United States cities.  It will be pretty inexpensive to get a round-trip ticket to San Antonio and a whole lot safer.  The United States and Mexico have an international agreement and the passport and visa should be sufficient.  To make sure about the visa have your boyfriend visit or call the United States Consulate at this number (81) 8047-3100 and they will be able to answer all your questions.  The (81) is the country code so if your boyfriend is calling he need not use the number from inside Mexico.|`|fUdBPu01aa	Why can't he just rent a car in Laredo and drive to San Antonio? I live in Texas and I would stay far away from the border. It is extremely dangerous, with drug cartels like the Zetas paying off the cops and shooting people in the streets.
8G42oyydaa	My advise is dont take a tour, they just gouge you. Get on a plane and go there, shop around and book through a Chinese travel agent for the cheapest airfare.     Go on elong.net to book hotels. Once you get there your hotel will provide you with information on what to see and where to go and once there you can participate in organized tours.      You can also hire your own driver to take to some places.    It makes NO sense to hand over a few thousand to someone else to book your flight and hotels, that you could use to see China with does it?  Tour companies make BIG profits for what really is an unncessary service IMO  Traveling with a tour group you will NOT see the real China. Guaranteed, you will see the "mask" of China    Get a book on China, research the net, plan your trip and then just get a ticket and go.  Save yourself a ton of money and get the real experience and meet the real people !    Nothing to be afraid of traveling on your own, just stay out of back alleys, dont socialize with bar girls, ask what prices are ahead of time for tours and taxis etc. DONT ever get into a taxi without asking, and asking if the driver knows where your destination is.    Look typical fair aka honest costs up on the internet and dont get gouged on prices.

mCXEPVNzaa	Jacksonville and Miami are more different than Jacksonville and Tampa, by a longshot. Your mistake is dividing the state east to west instead of north and south. Florida is really three places: Southeastern Florida (which is Miami, Fort lauderdale, and West Palm) has an extremely northeastern vibe to it and a lot of transplants. It's dense, busy, lively, and multicultural. It's also expensive and (some would say) dangerous. The central Florida corridor is more straight-laced and has a lot more natives, but the hospitality industry in Orlando leads to a lot of transients. The rest of the state, in particular the swathe from Jacksonville through Gainesville and over to Tallahassee and the panhandle, feels a lot more like the interior south. It's supposed to be twenty degrees tomorrow night here in Gainesville, for example.
xc6GcEJ6aa	Go to a doctor and tell him/her what your problem is, you forgot your acne medicine and you need some, tell them if you're allergic to anything and specifically say what kind of medicine it is, sometimes they might not have the exact same medication, so they'll have to possibly switch it. Best bet is to just go to a doctor and see what they say. Medicine is generally cheaper in Mexico, so money shouldn't be an issue. Good luck! =).|`|kuIT8OK9aa	There are usually Farmacias all over the place in Mexican cities.    Before going to the doctor, go to a Farmacia and ask the pharmacist. Accutane or a generic will likely be available without a prescription.      IF he/she says NO then ask for a recommendation for an english speaking doctor.|`|AA11243887	Ask the Pharmacist, if you need a prescription he or she can find a doctor to write one.

It is not a great place to bum around without money since you will have to worry about getting robbed if you sleep in a public area.  That being said, I once found some deserted bungalows along the north coast once when I got stranded between Caberete and Sosua that were about a half mile from the highway but I didn't try to go inside.  I just crashed on the beach in a lawn chair and got up when the sun came up to get a cab to Sosua.  There are some VERY cheap apts for the locals with no electric and a common toilet and a hose for a shower, but it is not something I would really recommend.  There are some abandoned hotels that never got finished, but they would not be safe at all.  There are public showers on the beach in Sosua and you have to pay a few pesos to use them.<br>  <br>  Unless you are a bartender with references or can speak fluent Spanish, there are not too many jobs down there for people without money.  I knew some folks who managed to get into real estate, but you have to be able to look professional if you want to sell a $100,000 house to some tourist, much less a million dollar half finished hotel to some sucker-- um, I mean investor.

We need to return to the bordoers established under the Mandate and establish a normal democratic government. A modern state is not only multi-cultural,it has strict laws against ethnic and religious discrimination. If Jews cannot handle living in a society based on equal rights then let the U.S. find them an island somewhere where they can be by themselves. Palestine is far too centrally located in the ME and has too great a significance to two billion Christians and almost as many Muslims for it to be divested of both and regarded as the exclusive domaine of a single ethno-religious group. They can be part of a free country based on equality of rights or they can go back to Russia; I don't care. I no longer feel any sympathy for them at all. They are no different than Czarist generals when the shoe is on the other foot. They are in addition as volatile as they are racist. If they need an exclusivist ethnic state perhaps the British should let them develop the Falklands for the purpose.|`|b8ae5eef3b2d61ecb71b1965967306bcaa	It does.

We  still end up with 78.5% of the territory of Mandate Palestine which is certainly enough; our greed since 1967 has only endangered the State of Israel and made it a pariah state with humanitarians everywhere. We should have withdrawn from the Occupied Territories as soon as the P.A. was established. We pay the price of our greed every day in loss of international respect and stature,what to speak of our genuine moral standing,of which little is left. If they are willing to accept a rump republic of 22.5% we show go for it. Fast. We don't have anything like the respect we enjoyed forty years ago. And that's why.|`|6253169b02f2076d996076889f0591d0aa	No. They already have a state: Jordan. You didn't know that? Then google it and you'll see. 80% of the former British mandated territory became Jordan. Most people living in Jordan are Palestinian. Palestinians are regular Arabs without a special culture.

wVsjgj35aa	The Jewish Kingdom of Yemen is very well documented and obviously this is the reason so many Ethiopians converted to Judaism since the two countries are very close; the question has nothing to do with any so-called "lost tribes". I think our participants should learn how to do a simple google search: you just put "Jewish kingdom/ Yemen" and you will find several articles on this subject,generally from scholarly journals. It is astonishing how ignorant Jews are of their own history. I cannot help but wonder how they think those Blacks in Ethiopia became Jewish; did the Hebrews in Palestine visit them a lot? Education would be very helpful for many zionists. As to being the true point of origin of what the Egyptians called the Habaru,I would think that an interesting line of inquiry; I have no opinion but it is a more likely scenario that the tale told in the Tanahk. As to the Hebrews being in Palestine "from the beginning" that is in conflict with their own biblical account as well as archeology,what to speak of being rather vague. "From the beginning...of what? Time? Creation? The emergence of civilization?|`|XuYPddLuaa	Perhaps. Interesting question.|`|pgAnh6f7aa	All the evidence suggests Yemen as I understand it. Unless you consider old religious tracts as scientific evidence.|`|HsgEFrJMaa	No,Yemen. There is an excellent scholarly article online about the Jewish Kingdom of Yemen but you have to pay to read it.|`|BgaNh6Tbaa	(if you want the spiel on Ethiopia, go to the bottom...)    Going from lore...    Humans, as a species, appeared around 200,000 B.C.E.  From then until about 20,000years ago, they steadily populated the various regions of the world including the Americas.    For all intents and purposes, "human history" began about 10,000 years ago.  Civilizations and societies began springing up in different parts of the world-- India, China, and Tenochtitlan were notable such places.    Around the same, tn the Middle East and in lower (i.e., Northern) Egypt, various tribes began to spring up with various proportions of sedentary agriculture and nomadic sustenance. None of them were of any large size, and they're impressions in history were likely only fleeting. India and South America, though, are believed to have been rather advanced during these periods and possibly China as well.    Cultural, religious, and genetic exchange amongst these tribes was varied but significant enough that when things got interesting in 2000BCE (4000years ago and in the next paragraph), it wouldn't be a stretch to say that most of those peoples throughout the region were mostly the same with only fleeting differences.    It was in 2000BCE, 4000years ago, that things started to get interesting and people began to develop distinctive identities, cultures, and beliefs (but, the "distinctions" were very small compared to what we would consider distinctions today).    It was also around this time that belief-systems appeared that could be collectively but reasonably be understood to constitute 'Judaism.'  Anyhow, continuing...    (actually, no. not continuing. Why the hell am I typing so much on something so trivial?)    Anyhow, CUTTING TO THE CHASE...    "The Ancestral Land of the Jewish People"... there's always going to be a disagreement as to what it constituted, when it existed, and yes, even what it was called.    Sorry. But, that's just the nature of the beast.    I think I have a couple of definitions of what might constitute "The Ancestral Land of the Jewish People"... which I think a lot of IMPARTIAL persons might find acceptable.    The first is "the kingdom of David and its vicinity". If you go by this definition, then, going from the southwest corner of the Dead Sea, the territory constituted all the land from there to 60miles to the north; and all the land 25-35miles westward of the aforementioned land.  So, you're talking about a rectangle of land that's around 1,800 square miles.    The second is "the lands of Canaan, minus some of the outermost outskirts". If you go by this definition, then, going from the southwest corner of the Dead Sea, the territory constituted all the land from there to 90miles to the north;  all the land from there to 30miles to the south; and all those lands 55-75miles westward of aforementioned land.  So, you're talking about a rectangle of land that's around 7,800 square miles.    So, you're talking about a tract of land either slightly larger than Road Island, or slightly smaller than New Jersey in area.    Yep. You heard right.    PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLING EACH OTHER FOR YEARS IF NOT AGES OVER A LAND-TRACT IN THE DESERT THAT'S SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT IN ANY ONE OF 47 DIFFERENT U.S. STATES!    As for the "people" of Israel... those that are identified as "Israeli citizens"... not including those persons whose families were pretty much entirely in the region already by 100 years ago (i.e., some Arabs, some Semites, and maybe also few folks that had goat farms)...    The lands and genes they have, come LESS from the Middle East, and MORE from places like Poland, Russia, Hungary, and Western Europe.    And you know what...? That's pretty much no different from the origins of "white people" in this country. For all intents and purposes: Jews = whites.     Yes, if you want to get very technical, you might be able to get away with saying that the Jews seem white because they're descended of Ashkenazi Jews.  But the thing is... the Ashkenazi Jews are almost an exact representative sample of the larger pool of white people!    In the eras predating the Magna Carta, the proportion of Jews that were Ashkenazi was basically negligible.  By the beginning of the 20th century, they were almost 92% of the worldwide Jewish population.  Today, they're about Ashkenazi 80% of the Jewish population. In most persons today of the Jewish faith, the ancestry of any one person is almost completely European.  Conversely, the ancestry of any one person that is Middle Eastern is minuscule. Contrary to popular belief, converting to Judaism was common enough to have a significant statistical impact in relation to genealogy. Marriage to or adoption to persons in places like Poland, Russia, Hungary, and Western Europe also had similar effects.    So what does all of this mean...?    Nothing.    Which is precisely all that it SHOULD mean.  People are people.  Distinguishing them based on their lineage or even their genetics is basically meaningless because people are ALL basically mutts. Moreover, wherein most animal species including other primates can have extensive genetic variation from one member to the next, humans have almost no variation. Two percent, at the very most. Most scientists would say it's drastically less -- 0.8%, perhaps.    The only meaningful basis to distinguish people from one another is who they are as individuals -- their personalities and their deeds. Any frenzied nationalist  -- whether Pro-Israel, Pro-Arab, Pro-Palestinian, Pro-Europe, Pro-Klingon -- that tries to say otherwise is just wrong. In all likelihood, they just got some lurking agenda.    Oh, and about the Ethiopians? The lost tribes?    No, the "ancestral lands of Jewish peoples" would not be in Ethiopa. And the |`|pohm4X7Aaa	no, the Jews were originally in Israel from the beginning. After the Jews were forced out of Israel Jews had to find places to live so some migrated there but with Ethiopian Jews, we dont know much about when or where they were first.|`|TA4rdQM3aa	If they originated in Yemen then that would be their ancestral home.|`|AA10482044	As long as you don't go back too far I think you'll find it's Long Island NY.

Apparently because all Jews are black, especially the tall, blond-haired, blue-eyed Ashkenazis living in France and Germany and Poland and the Ukraine.    Look, troll, let's break it down.    1. There are only 13 million Jews.  2. This is because Judaism has never been a religion of mass preaching like Islam or Christianity.  3. Therefore it is safe to assume that the overwhelming majority of today's Jews are born Jewish and are the closest descendants of the ancient Jews i.e. Hebrews or Israelites.  4. The Jews were dispersed all over the world by the repeated destruction of the ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah which were in the middle of the Egyptian and Phoenician and Babylonian and Assyrian and Persian and Macedonian and Roman empires, the last of which was the suppression of the Jewish Revolt by the Roman Vespasian in 68 AD.  5. The chief rabbinate recognizes ten "Lost Tribes" or divisions of Jews in diaspora. Only ONE is in Ethiopia.  6. Furthermore have been problems with the authenticity of that tribe because a lot of Ethiopians and other Africans are trying to get identified as Jews so they can move to Israel without a hassle.    How could Jews have originated in Yemen when Abraham was born in Ur and Moses never ventured beyond Canaan and Egypt? It's in YOUR holy book!    Jews migrated to Yemen, just like they did to Arabia. Muhammad fought a war of extermination against the Arab Jews and then the final Jewish community was expelled from Aden in Yemen during the early days of the Arab-Israeli conflict (you never talk about them like you do the Palestinian refugees huh?). Today there are more or less precisely 430 Jews in the entire peninsula, 400 in Yemen and 30 in Bahrain.    Oh, and the Jews in Yemen are still getting shot and terrorized by Muslims. One was killed last week.    Muslims have 57 states that are "large and lush with natural resources" but are also "in dire need of development" and apparently always will be. Israel is the only Western-level country in the entire region. So why don't you try and develop yourself instead of struggling to claim what others have toiled for?    If all of Israel would be awarded to the Palestinians today in ten years it would be another Afghanistan, and everyone here damn well knows that.|`|Kik3epkVaa	The archeological evidence suggests they originate in Yemen and that a large contingent migrated across the Gulf of Aden where they intermarried and  obviously spread Judaism,followed by a foray to the north into Egypt which resolved into a disastrous experience with enslavement followed by self-liberation and a scattering of the survivors into small enclaves throughout Palestine. This grouping remained  thinly distributed throughout ancient Palestine until the 2nd century B.C. when John Hyrcanus gathered them into Judea. As to the main body they remained in Yemen which eventually emerged as a major trading nation specializing in spices. The Jewish Kingdom in Yemen succumbed to Islam long,long after the Roman destruction of the tiny Judean community. All evidence suggests that contemporary Yemenites are Hebrew descendants who converted to Islam; a small percentage did not and were eventually relocated to Occupied Palestine in the early 1950's. You are slightly right in that Ethiopia was the first element of their expansion,but in essence their ancestral homeland is Yemen . Maiamonides was aware of this and one of his most cherished goals was to achieve the reconversion of the Yemenites back to Judaism; he sent several missions to that effect,as exemplified by his Letter to Yemen.|`|Ic8FLXm5aa	I don't understand what archaeological evidence about Yemen? I am confused because I have read many books on the Jewish people. I did read once that Hebrews converted a group of Temenians in what is now called Yemen (it was their first national religion). This is why they find some archaeological evidence of Judaism in the area. The rest they find of the Jews who moved there later (a very old community). If you guys read history, there are a  lot of Jewish artifacts in the land between iraq and Iran (more in Iran) than in Israel (allegedly). I don't believe this yet, because the temple mount was never excavated. The Greeks, historically have lived more in ethiopia and egypt than the Jews ever have. There are a group of ethiopians who do not look black or middle eastern whom have the same genetic makeup as certain groups in Yemen. They look more indian. Some historians believe they are the descendants of that land. I am confused where you read your history? Websites?

7toznquyaa	When  you are snorkeling, you are usually in about 15 -20 feet of water and you are not supposed to be able to touch the bottom. (you'll break the coral and kill it). <br>  <br>  It's mandatory to were a snorkeling vest to keep you afloat so that you stay on TOP of the water (as in snorkeling).<br>  <br>  I don't advice scuba Diving for anyone who is not a strong swimmer. <br>  Besides, you have to take Scuba Lessons to Dive.|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	I haven't been to Nassau, but most islands have a lot of snorkeling sites of varying depths.  Some are even sheltered from the waves.  I suggest you get a guide book with information on all of the snorkeling sites (see the link for an example).  A good guide book will tell you how deep the water is, what you can see there, and the recommended experience level (beginner, intermediate, or advanced).  You can pick out the sites that sound best for your comfort level.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  I should add two more things.  First, you don't need to worry about going down and not coming back up.  You'll be more buoyant in salt water than you are in a fresh water pool, so if you want to dive down for a closer look at something, staying down will be the hardest part.  When you stop kicking you'll come right back to the surface.  That's why scuba divers have to wear weight belts.  The other thing is that it's actually more dangerous to snorkel in water that's too shallow than water that's too deep.  If you snorkel over a reef where the water is so shallow you can stand up, the waves are much higher there and a wave could drop you right onto the coral.  Deeper water (15-20 feet) is calmer and safer for snorkeling.  You can wear a life vest or other flotation device if you feel insecure in that depth.|`|zkiNhUOVaa	I am 9 years old and i loveee to snorkel!!

Roughly speaking, the New York Tri-State area encompasses the populated areas in the states of New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut that are within a typical commuting distance of Manhattan (by car or railway) or alternatively, the coverage area of the broadcast television stations that operate from Manhattan.  An advantage of the term is that it allows the inclusion of more outlying rural areas that are still within commuting distance of Manhattan.

Here is a story that was carried on the news tonight 01/29/2009:    Department of Justice Investigates Escambia County Jail      PENSACOLA, FL - A federal investigation is underway of the practices of the Escambia Sheriff's Office.     This afternoon, Sheriff David Morgan held a press conference to talk about the matter.     Sheriff Morgan says he's not been told what prompted the investigation but he did share this letter he got from the Department Of Justice.    In it they say, they'll look into the excessive use of force by a deputy and condition at the jail.    The prob will be open ended, in fact the Department Of Justice says they have not reached any conclusion of subject matter about the investigation.    Sheriff Morgan thinks they will likely look into several deaths at the Escambia County Jail.    He points out that he's welcomed local civil rights groups to look into the jail and he welcomes the investigation.    --------------------------------------...  13 deaths and counting!    A man was found beat to death in the tie down chair at the jail.  First the deputies said that the man was beaten before they took him to the jail.  When that was proven to be false they then changed their story and said that the man in a fight while at the jail to try and cover their own brutal actions.

OHfZFR31aa	You can't just move to "Europe" as every country has it's own immigration rules and regulations. You have to decide which country you want to move to, then contact that country's embassy to see if you qualify for a visa that would allow you to stay for more than 90 days. <br>  <br>  Normally you have at least a Masters degree and 5 years management experience to qualify for the "highly skilled" category, or have an occupation experiencing shortages, such as nursing. If you get sponsored by a company, they have to prove that there is no one person in the EU who is qualified to fill that position before they could sponsor you.<br>  <br>  And even if you do get a visa for one country in Europe, that does not give you the right to live or work in any other country.

IgEOB2Braa	Your best bet (and cheapest, in the long run) is to buy or borrow a bathroom scale. Weigh yourself, then weigh yourself holding the bag and make sure the difference is 50 lbs or less. The fees for an overwieght bag can be astronomical (in my opinion) so a small investment in a scale to save a whole lot of money might be a wise thing to do.

If your boyfriend is 18 (or gets permission from his parents/legal guardians), why couldn't he come see you?    And one last thing - I'm not trying to tell you how to run your life, just offering a suggestion - I think you really should talk to your parents about this situation. You don't have to mention wanting to see him, just talk to them about why they don't want you to date this guy. If you show them that you can be mature about the situation and respect their wishes, maybe they'll let you visit him soon.

Second clue, the email you received should be from @omni.com or something similar.  However you probably received it from yahoo.com or Canada.ca or some other free email account.

Unless you want to be on a dirty bus with a bunch of scum and some of the worst that society has to offer.  If you are looking to get around in Indy for a short period of time, I would get a good map and rent a small midsize car.  Its fairly cheap and you will get around much quicker than you would on any of the buses in town.  If you are looking to move to indy and are hoping for good public trasportation, you are out of luck.

3EN5uttwaa	hi, traditionally it lasts 15 days with certain significance for each day.  now in current day society, the duration for chinese new year celebrations varies country to country.  for some western countries where chinese are minority, it is just a mere celebration with no official public holidays.  in China, they have 9 days of public holiday for this year.  in singapore, we have only 2 days. first day of the new year is still celebrated with fanfare and in some places, the 15th day is celebrated as well.  if you want to immense yourself in these celebrations, look for a chinese family that still observe these traditions.|`|VyJC1MNiaa	Yup it's over. It's like the Western New Year, just celebrate on the eve and then countdown, then it's over. So yes, it's over by now.

My husband's office got the whole week off, but they're back today (Thursday).

I think that day working is optional also, but you can bet most will be at work.    It's all new for me too!|`|V38kMY3Kaa	Turning Over a New Leaf   The Chinese New year is celebrated on the first day of the First Moon of the lunar calendar. The corresponding date in the solar calendar varies from as early as January 21st to as late as February 19th. Chinese New Year, as the Western new Year, signified turning over a new leaf. Socially, it was a time for family reunions, and for visiting friends and relatives. This holiday, more than any other Chinese holiday, stressed the importance of family ties. The Chinese New year's Eve dinner gathering was among the most important family occasions of the year.|`|KfrYqRQNaa	This year, the CNY is earlier than previous year but I am not sure why.

twjIywhdaa	No it is not strange or abnormal to be interested in flying.  The flight attendant profession is a great one for anyone who enjoys working with people, travel, is able to put others needs above thiers, and does not mind long periods away from home.  The job does not pay well in to start. However the benefits typically are better than other entry level jobs. (ie insurance, industry discounts)  I would look into jobs to make you a better canidate such as busser, waiter retail and if you can learn a language you are at an advantage.  As far as things you can do while in school that look good on a resume teachers aid or work with challenged students on campus peer mediation will catch attention.  It is a great job think about it what other job gives you more time off better pay and the chance to see the world.  After 15 yrs you can easily be earning over 50,000 and only work 12-15 days a month.|`|IEliUISJaa	of course not, i find it silly to think that only girls can be flight attendants, my best tips for you, follow your dreams, go for your goals, and let nobody not even your parents tell you other whys|`|AA11496012	Actually there are a lot more male flight attendants now.  In the past, flight attendants and nurses were all females.  Now we are seeing more males going into these 2 professions.  There is nothing wrong with wanting to be a flight attendant.|`|6egxGam6aa	Not at all! Who says guys can't have a love for traveling and meeting all kinds of new people?    If you want to be a flight attendant simply because you love the air travel industry, maybe you could be an electrician for an airline. You'd get the best of both worlds.    Happy trails!|`|uT3QJslxaa	I dont think it is weird at all. I always did stare at them with awe.  That you be a great idea. It depends what airline you take. Lufthansa pays a lot and so does AA. Avoid DELTA! I take a plane every month|`|da43dabf7871960d74ed399773611dfaaa	Hell no! I'm a similar way.    So you love flying, right?    Well you might also consider piloting, seeing as you have an interest in becoming an electrician.    I wanted to become a pilot - but I loved talking to people and had great people skills so I didn't want to let that go to waste.    So I was, considering doing a flight attendants' course until I worked at a hotel and my career path changed to that area.    But there are a MILLION male flight attendants, there's no issue in it, and if you do progress down this career path, your friends will be stuck in 9-5 boring jobs while you're jetsetting around, meeting a heap of new people!    Good luck.
23vKOyBraa	I would suspect not. The act of cutting something indicates it was cut for a reason, despite not being date expired. Maybe you found it in the bin (from the airline's point of view I mean).|`|da43dabf7871960d74ed399773611dfaaa	Bring supporting documents, like your birth certificate and perhaps other identification.     If you have a passport, that would be absolutely brilliant, because it also acts as a main form of identification.    Call the airline you are flying with or check their website for further details on alternate identification.

Israel refuses to believe this COULD JUST MAYBE be their fault. But of course, Muslims are evil and just want to kill Jews. They wake up everyday, and want to blow themselves cause they hate da Jews. They don't want peace !! They want to see their children blown up -- even though you see videos with mothers and fathers sobbing over the dead. Even though there are Jewish Palestinians -- but they still want to kill Jews. No way in hell could it be something else.    I like it. It's sad we never see this. That quote just confirms my position on this conflict. Thanks.|`|KijGRGXuaa	please vote for peace , this is the only way to overcome the whole voilence|`|MjGgICRiaa	What does hamas think about this?    http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/articl...    "Way back on March 31, 1977, the Dutch newspaper Trouw published an interview with Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee member Zahir Muhsein. Here's what he said:        The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism.        For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan. "|`|BgaNh6Tbaa	I read that statement and interpret that precisely the way I should.    He claims he has a legitimate grievance, and then he identifies it.     Does the statement prompt me to excuse any past violent misconduct he'd have carried out? No.    Does the statement prompt me to excuse future violent misconduct he'd intend to carry out or abet? No.    The statement does not move me to think that the Pro-Israel faction is completely in the wrong, or in the right.    The statement does not move me to think that the Pro-Palestine faction is completely in the wrong, or in the right.    The only thing it moves me to do -- as it should anyone -- is to learn more about the nature of his grievances myself.    If I determine that the grievances are true, then I assess what must be done next:    1) assess if criminal penalties ought be designated upon those that carried out the misconduct leading to the grievances    2) assess what compensation he ought be entitled to for being afflicted with his grievance, and from whom that compensation ought originate    Methinks most of you deep down inside acknowledge that is the appropriate mentality to adopt when approaching a conflict such as the one underpinning what the man was talking about.    It can be difficult to not act or speak according to our passions or emotions, yes. But acting upon passions or emotions -- such things as despair, anger, or pride -- is the sign of young boys (and girls).    Not men (and women).    True strength and character comes from discipline, self-control, and keeping a cool head: the essence of being a man (or woman).    I say these things because I'm stunned by how so many of you here allow your passions to become unleashed.    I think you know better than that, and should change accordingly.|`|pCNjmMbNaa	not surprised. That's  what I allways thought. These people just want to live their life with dignity. The goal has never been to attack the jews. That's ridiculus. It was never the goal.  Their goal is to defend themselves from the oppressors. Specially when they oppress you because of who you are and what you believe in ( If the palestinians were jews they would never be treated that way). And I support this 100%.|`|TA4rdQM3aa	Sounds reasonable.|`|7zZZEUxqaa	Some people will always not accept what Hamas says, and you know what , who cares about if people believe or do not believe Hamas. They have proved themselves, they have won the Gaza war, and Israel showed the whole world what a coward , criminal country it is !|`|i7oHTo9haa	That is just a tactic.  It's total BS, propaganda.  Arabs are known for their "double talk."  They say one thing to an Israeli, and another thing to an Arab.    "People should not assume that in the management of this conflict, we are moving from a phase of resistance and battles to a phase of calm. No. According to our concept of the management of this conflict, the tahdiah is a tactical means. It is a step within the resistance and is not detached from it. It is only natural for any resistance movement, which cares about the interests of its people, to bear in mind the general Palestinian condition. At times, it generates an escalation, and at times, it withdraws a little. It is a process of ebb and flow, going up and down. This is how you run a battle." -- Hamas leader Khaled Mash'al, Al-Jazeera TV aired April 25, 2008:    After Dec. 19, 2008 the tahdiah (calm) will end and not be renewed. -- Khaled Mashal, Hamas Leader Lebanon TV, aired 12/29/08    I go by history and actions not false words.  He could end things tomorrow if he just disarmed.  History has shown that the Arabs were never kind to Jewish people.  They murdered us, tortured us, kidnapped our children and stolen our women for their wives. No thanks!  I pass on his rhetoric.    This is what Hamas is really about:    Hamas In Their Own Voices  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i08L09V0_...    And as far as the rest of his statement that we invaded and kicked him out of land and destroyed his society, well there really was never such a thing as Palestinian people anyways.  They are really Syrians, he works out of Damascus, and he already knows this.    Arabs claim we aren't indigenous to the region but they know better. Jewish people have always maintained settlements there: We had a claim of Messiahship out of Gaza, settlements here and there all over the place throughout history, even when the majority of our people were in diaspora.     I claim that there is no such thing as a Palestinian people that they are simply Syrian orphans abandoned on Israel's doorstep.  Syria founded the PLO after the Arabs lost their wars with Israel to overthrow both Israel and Jordan. Syria still has their eyes on Lebanon as well to re-make their Greater Syrian Empire.  Similar to what Saddam wanted to do with Kuwait and Mesopotamia.   They all got their modern countries and just wanted more more more and leave Israel out in the cold. Arabs already admitted there is no such thing as Palestinian people so why has nobody else got this memo?   No thanks on the violence from these people, after 60 years their violent and hegemonious intentions bred violence and hate in their children that put impede any peace process.  How about they just put down the weaponry and make a skyscraper in Gaza because that is a task that requires two hands and a shovel not a fist and a gun.  We offer the Palestinian people a home they are fools to not grasp this opportunity and any suffering they do or unjustice they feel is by their own device.

FDjn05cNaa	Wear what you are comfortable in ..in March it will be the start of spring & the days should be warm but the nights still cool.Have something casual & smart for the evenings & practical for day wear....mix 'n match is the go !    I have an adaptor I always take with me....two round pins ! The real pain in the tush is the lack of reliability of electricity supply...it can go off any time for up to four hours at a time so be careful Itch using elevators & bring a small reliable torch !    I have just returned from a month in Lebanon& I know you can get a visa at the airport but I get one before I go.....I don't relish the thought of meeting a difficult official at 2.30 am after 20 hours in aircraft & would rather be sure beforehand....this last visit it took me 15 mins from leaving my seat on the plane till I was in the carpark...

The bad news about electrical outlet is that the electricity here is 220 v, and unless you bring a small trans (transformes 110 to  220, and vice versa) none of your stuff will work here, or (like what happened to me) you would smell your stuff cooking :)  No you do not need any pictures at the airport for the visa, just a 35 dollar fee ( or close to that) for a 15 day visa (I almost paid to enter the country, but then my expired lebanese passport saved me that).  Before leaving by a day or so, it would be good to check the 10 day forecast at http://weather.yahoo.com/forecast/LEXX00...|`|7rdwArEMaa	Wear what you want seriously just bring a few pair skinny jeans and tall heel boots to the knee are the trend and if you have.... bring a designer handbag you can use the entire trip lol....bare shoulders no problem :D    If your coming from the states you get your Visa stamp when going through customs upon arrival no problem....if your flight arrives after 9pm then customs will stamp your visa for free because the office is closed to purchase one the fee is $35 USD.

The women in Beirut dress up a lot more during the day than the woman in the states, and you will be surprised at how much skin they show. Be yourself and wear what you want and don't pay attention to those catty Lebanese women. I thought they were ridiculously superficial when I lived there (I'm an American woman, 29.)     The electrical outlets are like the European ones, someone already answered that perfectly.    The visa process is easy, usually they don't even make you pay but it could be $35. All you need is your passport. They'll ask you what you're doing there and then send you on your way.|`|Nrj7ponnaa	May I add that your hair-dryer will not work in Lebanon unless it has a switch to both voltages.

You need a return ticket though. Extend your VISA here if you will stay more than the allowed days.   More info: ENTRY/EXIT REQUIREMENTS:  U.S. citizens may enter the Philippines without a visa upon presentation of their U.S. passport, valid for at least six months after the date of entry into the Philippines, and a return ticket to the United States or an onward ticket to another country.  Upon arrival immigration authorities will annotate your passport with an entry visa valid for 21 days.  If you plan to stay longer than 21 days you must apply for an extension at the Philippine Bureau of Immigration and Deportation's main office at Magallanes Drive; Intramuros, Manila, Philippines or at any of its provincial offices at http://www.immigration.gov.ph.     Aside from that you may want to carry some cash, credit card and well may want to search for a hotel to stay in advance.  I recommend this hotel, not the five star kind but decent enough:  http://www.mabuhaymanor.com.ph/  You can book online but requires you at least 2 weeks prior to the date of arrival, However you cans still get a room if you make reservations by phone or walk-in. Rate is like $40/night but with free buffet Filipino breakfast.  Five star hotels like Manila Hotel and such have like $100/night rate so you can also chose those.     Well, I hope you enjoy your stay here!|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	Money, a smile on your face and some patience.|`|eB8tYK1Gaa	Get like a book, or an iPod to do while your on the plane.

I'm a filipino, I went to visit my family. Bring pocket money, bcuz things cost a lot there! Like my notebook I got last year, it was 106 pesos. :O bring lots of pocket money, so yeah.

Aside from the letter you need to attach a letter coming from the social service of the hospital where your mom is confine or where she has her check up, endorsement letter from the City/Municipal Mayor and medical abstract from her attending physician.     A friend of mine who was granted 1M for his kidney transplant. His mom went to Manila where she submitted the requirements. Luckily, the resolution for the financial assistance was approved by the Directors of PCSO. Its better to submit it in Quezon City where the main office is. They usually give bigger amount compared in Cebu. You may also ask financial assistance from politicians. They also have funding in some hospital.|`|JEb2Kqd4aa	yeah, try PCSO, my cousin has colon cancer, their business went down, and now they don`t have enuff money to sustain her treatment, then my father went to PCSO for help, some papers and some negotiations and now, my cousin is undergoing treatment again.Regarding your lot in Plaridel, you can post it free on Buy and Sell, just send them the details via text message.

In which case it could well be at the bottom of a bomb disposal pit by now. Call the airport as the above answers imply and hope for the best, but don't count on it.    If you need to leave luggage behind, at least use a proper storage company, who will keep it (and keep charging you I might add).|`|54tW840Oaa	make sure you call the airline or airport they might still have it|`|AA10780838	Call the Airport's Lost & Found Office and see if they have it.

AA10737816	Detroit is a place that makes you say krikey or somtin'    I know Michigan is a nice place and close to a very nice place, Canada    If I can convince you that Canada is a better place to live I will.    That could take some time.  If you like the stars and stripes I strongly recomend Montana.  You all will love it.  Make sure you research Montana, Yellowstone, etc.                                              Good luck, with Detroit as yer first pick I'd say you all need it!|`|hAxtd5yTaa	Forget Detroit.|`|rMB71kZ8aa	First of all don't listen to Point God and all the other posters here trying to make Detroit sound like such a wonderful place to live when it is in fact not.  Detroit is called "Death City" because of the high murder rate here.  Detroit is a very unsafe place to live.  If i were you, i would definitely not move here.  The murder rate here is very high now and their are not many jobs here.  There is so much senseless violence here that i have gotten to the point  where i am afraid to walk out of the house everyday now.      Although there is violence everywhere, some places are not as worse as others are.  You watch the news in Detroit and everyday you hear about innocent people losing their lives to crime.  That is why i am about to move out of state.  If you google Detroit i am sure will find alot information about the city that is not good.|`|fIK9LBEuaa	The suburbs of Detroit are great places to live.     I'm not sure what your income is, but there are upper class neighborhoods like Troy, Birmingham, and Grosse Point.    Then there are more middle class (still safe) neighborhoods like, Warren, St.Clair Shores, and Roseville.    I wouldn't recommend buying a house downtown Detroit, even though the housing is cheap.     There are also hospitals everywhere throughout all those areas. If worse comes to worse, you could always make a 10-15 minute commute to Detroit for the major hospitals.    The suburbs are great places to live, you won't be disappointed!    Feel free to message me if you have any more questions. Good luck! :)|`|cnssh7v3aa	never move there, if you want to live somewhere nice in michigan move to burmingham, very nice housings|`|dv8267AAaa	I wouldn't live in Detroit nor its metro area.|`|f5e243b3090fd85449d1a91b415bf5d8aa	Everyone here is pretty much right, but some of these posters don't live here, and don't have a clue, I say the best area is the northern suburbs, Chesterfield, Macomb. Royal oak and oakland county are nice.  Birmingham is nice if you can afford it, but pricey. So is Gross Pointe if you can afford it.  There are no problems with getting jobs in medical. And there are nice places in Detroit, it's not as bad a same uneducated individuals on this board will tell you, but it's also not the prime area to live. I worked at Henry Ford and it wasn't that great, but I wasn't in medical either. I've worked and gone to school in the city for 20 years with no problem.|`|hvp9goB3aa	Don't live IN detroit, live just on the outside of it. Deerbourne is a nice place to live and it's not far from the hospital if you work medical|`|hE8YL8Gwaa	If you are looking into moving to Michigan from overseas, I would recommend looking in the Grand Rapids region, especially since you are looking to get into the medical sector.    Grand Rapids is one of the few areas of the state that is currently growing. The area is beautiful, has a nightlife, vibrant, extremely family-friendly, etc. It's a great place to raise a family. The "medical mile" continues to grow with Grand Valley State University (www.gvsu.edu) in town, as well as Michigan State University bringing a medical facility to the area. Spectrum Health is the big hospital in town (there are several of them, with two major hospitals), as well as many others including Mary Free Bed, etc.     I grew up in east Michigan, and went to college in west Michigan. I currently live in Florida - but if I ever move back to the mitten... west Michigan is where it will be. The lakeshore is beautiful, the small towns are incredible for shopping, the people are friendly, and the school systems are some of the best in the country (see: East Grand Rapids, Jenison, and Grandville).|`|4yD5gEReaa	I have no idea why you would want to visit Detroit.  It is pretty much terriable here right now.  Our economy is lower than ever.  We dont have jobs!    Lol sorry for the negativity.    Okay so you will not want to live in the city of Detroit.  Our city isnt like New York  There is nowhere safe or nice to live inside the city.  You will need to look in the surrounding suburbs.      Northern Michigan is the nicest place to live.  You get more for your money up north.  Much larger homes on big pieces of land  which are pretty rare around Detroit.        As for our hospitals. I would say Henry Ford hospital is the best.  Much better area as well.          Hope I could help.|`|tqV5jMOBaa	I LIVE IN DETROIT  ALL THE PEOPLE DISSIN DETROIT CAN STOP  ALL WHAT YOU HEAR ABOUT DETROIT , IS FALSE    YOU WILL END UP LIKING DETROIT|`|5POoQJVpaa	Grand Rapids or Ann Arbor. The two cities are pretty comparable (i.e. expanding economy [especially the medical/science sectors], diverse, walkable neighborhoods, etc.), but I would go with Grand Rapids since it is much cheaper, more family-friendly (Ann Arbor is essentially a college town), and bigger than AA. Not to mention the vast opportunities for outdoor activities, Lake Michigan being only 30 or so miles west (will remind you of the ocean), and more choices for housing, shopping, dining, entertainment, etc etc.     Forget the Detroit area.|`|fBLfDazsaa	Do you consider yourselves liberal or conservative in nature? (Being from Australia I would guess more liberal.)    Grand Rapids is a lovely place as many have said, but I tired very quickly of living in Michigan's Bible belt. I have lived there 3 times at different stages of my life. I would not live their with a child because I would not want to expose them to the conservative nature of the place, even with its many outstanding features.    Ann Arbor is quirky, busy, and intellectual. You'll feel right at home in the medical field. I lived there twice at different stages. It is best if you have a connection to the University of Michigan - hospital or whatever - if not you feel too much like an outsider.    West Bloomfield is where I live and I find it culturally diverse, no where near as expensive as people imagine it would be, safe, and very easy to get to everything I need with highways in all directions.  It also has one of the biggest hospitals in the area in the building stages.    Detroit is where I work. There are some lovely historical homes in Indian Village and the Boston-Edison neighborhood I would love to live in. Those areas are safe to live in, but you will probably want to send your kids to private or charter schools.    Detroit has a ton of culture going on - but Detroit is not very good about getting the word out about what is going on. And Detroiters by and large like to bad mouth the city.  We have some of the best and most unique museums in the world, some of the greatest music, have a sneak peek at virtually every Broadway show. The economy is the pits and everyone is struggling, but the strong will carry on.    I've lived in 5 countries, 4 states, 21 cities - and I choose to live in Michigan.|`|L3oyAJq5aa	detroit is not a good area to live in. visiting downtown is fun and has things to offer for a good time. but not to live. good areas are rochester rochester hills, north sterling heights utica macomb township. these are all good neighborhoods for your kids. someone said birmingham and thats good too but old houses and very pricey. but kid friendly.|`|p4KITEVuaa	grand rapids, hands down.     forget the entire southeast side of michigan, unless you want to be forced to drive your car EVERYWHERE, experience some of the worst race relations in the country, have the most corrupt, unorganized government in the midwest, and put up with the worst football team in history.    grand rapids:  -walkable  -diverse  -beaches  -entertainment  -restaurants  -friendly  -most importantly: GROWING.  you cant go wrong moving to grand rapids.    when you come to visit michigan, dont even bother going to detroit. just go straight west.    check out this promo video for grand rapids: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W_GxCV5r...    95% of people who move to grand rapids never want to leave.

You might want to check with the Scottsdale Chamber of Commerce.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	The tourism industry is Scottsdale's primary employer, accounting for 39% of the city's workforce. In 2005, Scottsdale attracted over 7.5 million visitors to the city, providing an economic impact of over $3.1 billion.[22] The city of Scottsdale by itself is home to more than 70 resorts and hotels, boasting over 15,000 hotel rooms. This large hospitality market primarily caters to a higher-end, white-collar demographic.    The city of Scottsdale is second only to New York City as having more AAA Five-Diamond hotels and resorts than any other city in the United States. In 2008, AAA bestowed five such properties in Scottsdale with the highest honor: The Phoenician, The Canyon Suites, Scottsdale Camelback Inn, Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale at Troon North, and the Fairmont Princess Resort and Spa.[23]    Due to the area's high concentration of full-service hotels and resorts, other major tourism-based industries have flourished as a result, most notably with the abundance of first-class golf courses, destination spas, and of course the corporate meeting, convention and conference market. Many national and international companies consider Scottsdale one of the top destinations for such events.    Scottsdale boasts the highest number of destination spas per capita of any city in the United States, further pushing Scottsdale's already robust national reputation as premiere destination for tourism and leisure.[24]    The region's year-round warm weather and abundant sunshine is a major factor in Scottsdale's tourism appeal. In particular, during the winter season, when thousands of wealthy tourists from the midwest, the northeast, and as far away as Canada, flood the area with long-term visits (known locally as "snowbirds"). These tourists, who often practice the same migration routine annually, also often end up purchasing second homes in the area.[25]    Over the past several years however, Scottsdale's growing abundance of trendy, high-end nightlife, upscale restaurants, art galleries and luxury shopping, has made it a highly popular travel destination for the younger white-collar, and more style-conscious, travel set.|`|jWNcZ0zBaa	Rich people's money, Hot Clubs, the FBR, and Barret Jackson.
