KL8cqbC0aa	Yes, they do. Congo has a commitment with the USA to help end the genocide in Darfur. The president of Congo met with George W Bush a while ago to discuss possible ways to step forward and help with the situation. So, yes, Congo does have a place in the Darfur situation.<br>  <br>  why is this in Jokes and Riddles?!?!|`|e27fe1a9205b53137b4cbd03b8a47947aa	The Congo doesn't exist anymore.|`|AunZaJOEaa	Well, Congo is in a civil war aren't they?

sIJ6jxNdaa	they will fight for that person but will not get jealous easily and if they get jealous they will not show it they will stay very calm I don′t think they will move on just if the person you are dating is more interested in his ex<br>  I have experience|`|FhKfyxWlaa	I think they may fight for a little while, but if they weren't getting anywhere they would just move forward and chalk it up to the the other person's loss.|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	I personally wouldn't waste my time because there's guaranteed to be drama with that kind of situation and I have enough of that in my life.

I would be jealous. I would fight for him but make it understood that if he wants to be with me he can't speak with her at all. I'm very loyal and expect that back.|`|6kkXEpMKaa	Fight only if they are really into this one,otherwise they can't get jealous easily ( maybe from inside)|`|DjJwKc9Caa	fight them fer sure. that's just how aquarians roll

c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	The best songs you can pick are ones that you sing well. I know that sounds stupid, but many people pick out songs they LIKE but are not really good at singing. This happens all the time in Karaoke... people pick out songs they like, but are TERRIBLE at singing them because the song is not in the right key for them, or not in their range. <br>  <br>  Pay attention to what songs you feel you sing really well with when you sing along with the radio, songs that you don't struggle to hit any notes in them. If you have a karaoke machine to practice with, and the right kind of karaoke music CD's, often you can change the key and the pitch of the song so you can hit the notes better, if the artist and original recording is not easy for you. Sing for your friends or family and ask them to be really honest with you about how your singing sounds. It is a contest, after all, and you want to win, right? When you find the right song, you will just know, because it will flow very easily when you sing it.|`|rBr9OOIeaa	Change by; Taylor Swift,<br>  Great song, Great meaning:)|`|EUddyze0aa	Change by taylor swift is amazing.

mbgBFjKOaa	Quite possibly. It seems like every rapper who dies becomes labeled as one of the greatest rappers alive.<br>  <br>  Let's hope Soulja Boy never dies.|`|hPXu2Y8Daa	listen, any rapper that you think is better than biggie probly looked up to him. hes popular now cuz he was unbelievable and people now mourn his death, but he was just as popular wen he was alive. you cant diss someone who with just two albums became one of the greatest emcees ever. so stop talking ****, your not cool cuz you listen to underground rap. the notorious b.i.g. is and was one of the greatest rappers ever.|`|vBcadgYPaa	A lot of people really overrate his lyrics. He had good rhyming but he didn't have as much of a message as 2pac did.|`|E7i4J7e7aa	biggie smalls is priceless<br>  <br>  Sad he was murdered so young, he woulda kept putting out good music.<br>  <br>  I think hes underrated. people rate pac higher, but biggie was better than pac.|`|0VbAMZccaa	yes. The only reason he is popular is because is was killed. Same thing with 2pac|`|fAzejA9haa	LEGEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|SBfs1gXWaa	Nawh i think he is one of the best.<br>  <br>  he did get bigger after his death but still|`|1lvyUwo7aa	i think he gets a bit more exposure because he is dead, but he isn't extremely overrated like some rapper.|`|Jn7bt3JTaa	All artists experience a popularity surge postmortem. Artists and Sculptors works of art become worth more because no more will ever be made.<br>  <br>  To some, the artist may be getting "over-rated" attention after death, that is, maybe they didn't rate that high on ones talent meter in life so one naturally wonders, why do they suddenly rate it after death? It is a fair question. <br>  <br>  A well known example was Wolfgang, Amadeus, Mozart. While alive He was basically considered just another talented drunken composer who happened to be from a good family. This was during the age of music and composers. There were a great deal of other, talented, more disciplined, prolific and scholarly, studious composers in his day. Contrary to popular belief Mozart was not considered the finest composer of his day. Only after Mozart's Death, (years after) was his work examined, and truly revered.  <br>  <br>  I guess he answer is All is fair in fame in life and death.|`|tLHM4npxaa	I know I am going to get thumbs down but I think biggie smalls and tupac are both overrated...I consider Nas or Immortal Technique to be better than either of those rapper's...I think they are idolized so much though since they were killed at the peak of their career's...Lil Wayne would be even more famous than he is now in the rap industry if he died today..why..because he died..Death tends to bring more stardom to a musician..same case with Kurt Cobain from Nirvana|`|CCA0mTgsaa	NO BECAUSE HE WAS GENUINE, REAL, FRESH, YOUNG, GOOD QUALITY|`|7zo0ZOThaa	Nooo way, Biggie was one of the Greats|`|gPuASwcWaa	Kind of but he's still good.|`|hA5m65Waaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_BqLfOLnr8&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_BqLfOLn...</a><br>  <br>  Now you show me 10 videos of rappers taking from one man|`|vbNVlcNNaa	I liked him long before he was shot. He was one of the better rappers of his day. It does seem that a person becomes more famous after they die, but I think Biggie deserves his crown.|`|AunZaJOEaa	I love biggie's music...I think Tupac is overated, Tupac had a great message but not great rapping skills.|`|7Vgpz1Zlaa	Yes, hes most def over rated.... I could name 10 people better than him with out even thinkin about it.|`|xWUJeGfraa	No..but this question is overrated..|`|KF9751Lyaa	No, but Tupac was better =]|`|XKhNw221aa	He was one of the greatest rapper ever.

If so, he might like you.<br>  <br>  Ask him again if he likes your friend. If he says no, then take that as an opportunity to get closer to him. If he says yes, well then at least you tried, and you can now move on.|`|WtTUNC8Naa	If you dont like him, then it shouldn't matter if he likes your friend, or if your friend likes him<br>  I mean you have to really think about this.

I liked Tammy and Victor a lot too, until Sunday's episode I had thought that they got along so well. <br>  I also think that Mel and Mike are a fun twosome. <br>  But I still feel like I don't really know some of them very well yet. <br>  I love the Amazing Race! I never miss an episode, it's just such an exciting and fun show to watch.

The dude is amazing and his versatility can only be mathced by my next selection.<br>  <br>  Lil Wayne- The Carter III is a classic. If you love beats listen to the progression of the songs like " Let the Beat Build" other crazy beats are on songs like "Nike Boots" and "Hustler Music" <br>  <br>  The Cool Kids- THESE GUYS ARE THE FUTURE . IF YOU LOVE BEATS DOWLOAD THEM!!!! One guy is from Detroit and the other is from Chicago but they rap aboput things that college kids and normal people in general can relate to. Check Songs like "Mikey Rocks" and "Cooler than that Guy" and "What up Man" and lastly " Black Mags" <br>  If your looking for great BEATS w/o much lyrical content check out these artists:<br>  <br>  Ron Brows- One of the many new vocoder influenced producers but the sound is so hot !!!! Check songs like "Pop Champagne" , "Arab Money" ( by Busta Rhymes) and "Jumping out the Window"<br>  <br>  Soulja Boy - Many people hate on the kid for his lack of lyrical content but the clubs cannot deny his beat. Check Songs like: "Whats Hanenenen" and " Turn My Swag On" <br>  <br>  P.S. A peson CANNOT mention hip hop songs with beats that go hard without mentioning The Clipse song " Grinding" ( Beat Courtesy of thr Neptunes check songs like Snoops "drop it like its hot")  . Boys have been making this beat on their desks in the backs of classrooms since I was in seventh grade.... I am now a sophomore in college ... Enough Said. <br>  <br>  P.S.S. I may be biased but if yopu are looking for hard beats check for Local Detroit Rappers like K-Dezzy " IN my Hood" and "Deezy" and Tone Tone " What Up Doe"|`|0FWtWxMGaa	Dont listen to the dre mess its old you need the new rappers here<br>  some of the best<br>  Lil Wayne, best rapper alive<br>  Eminem,, sick<br>  Ludacris, nasty<br>  Young Jeezy, hood<br>  T.I, HOTT<br>  Nas,cool<br>  I guarentee you type in these artist name especially wayen youll get good songs bro<br>  good luck|`|t3muNq6Paa	dre<br>  <br>  snoop<br>  eminem<br>  <br>  dres got new albums coming out soon<br>  <br>  check it out<br>  <br>  WWW.tinyurl.com/cf6dtn|`|nU3jVTCEaa	Here are some that I like:<br>  Black Star<br>  Binary Star<br>  Asheru<br>  Blue Scholars<br>  Mos Def<br>  Talib Kweli<br>  Blackalicious<br>  CYNE<br>  Dilated Peoples - this group has great beats<br>  Jurassic 5<br>  MF Doom<br>  Panacea<br>  The Roots|`|RNOTjW2oaa	Start wit Pac and Biggie then work down

AA10562006	i will tell you what each positions mean:<br>  <br>  Venus in pisces:<br>  <br>  Venus in Pisces indicates a romantic, gentle, compassionate, sympathetic, sensitive and idealistic emotional nature. A born romantic, you will genuinely marry for love - not money or prestige. However, a strong partner is needed to give you emotional stability and security.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mars in Pisces:<br>  <br>  Mars in Pisces indicated that you will assert yourself in an emotional, sensitive, unassuming, co-operative, cultured, humorous, refined and caring manner. Energy levels can fluctuate day to day, much depends on your emotional state of mind. The incentive to action is governed not so much through logical assessment or practical necessity, but by intuition, 'how you feel' about a situation. Much of your personal energy is channelled into the subconscious mind, you are, therefore, naturally introspective and withdrawn.<br>  <br>  Mars in 4th house:<br>  <br>  With Mars in the Fourth House you are likely to exert your energy and initiative within the home and family. The desire for home and roots is strong - your very nature demands a secure home, children and devoted spouse. Much work will be carried out constantly to improve the home environment. At some stage you are likely to experience an inner restlessness that is difficult to describe: if not controlled, this will cause domestic unpleasantness, misunderstanding and disharmony in your home life.<br>  <br>  Venus in the 5th house:<br>  <br>  With Venus in the Fifth House the areas of life where you are most likely to express your social, romantic and artistic qualities are through a genuine love of life, especially in romantic attachments, hobbies, personal pleasures and social interests. Your infectious love of life and noble nature ensures socially popularity, although, at times, you can be rather theatrical in order to hog the spotlight. You usually choose a partner you can show-off with, and proudly display to friends and colleges. Appreciation of the arts is indicated. There is some predisposition to gambling or other forms of financial speculation. Children will be a very important factor in your life.|`|IpD7Gqieaa	Only I can answer this question correctly because I have a mars in pisces.<br>  So I would say that you are the most romantic person on earth, innocent but manipulative, lazy, high mental energy, forgiving, usually not aggressive but angry pretty often, you have all the love in the world to GIVE, you usually see the core of things that people miss, you see the beauty in life, you fall in love easily, you're a true romantic, shy, fun, intelligent, peacemaker, spiritual, wise, philosophical, and very much interested in arts.<br>  The downtrodden or NEEDY attract you.<br>  :)

Vanessa and Zac have turned down the roles, and Ashley and Corbin are moving on. I highly doubt any of the "major" characters will rejoin. However, other characters like Kelsi Nielsen (Olesya Rulin) , Taylor McKessie (Monique Coleman) and Zeke Baylor (Chris Warren Jr.) could sign up for a fourth. But in the end it all comes down to money.

I got one under my fingernail.<br>  <br>  I had a game of air hockey with my friend and I decided to run my finger along the goal hole thingy to see how much I needed to cover so that my friend wouldn't be able to get any goals in and I would therefore win.<br>  <br>  It tried to suck up my finger and finger nail.<br>  <br>  Ow.|`|JERUmEFzaa	Last week, I went to the mall and tripped on the parking space thingies now I have two beautiful black and blue marks below my knee!|`|77f3e4845b8070e61332c8a5d24f3b3aaa	today... on my boob. =/ me and these boys go into a ball fight (that's what she said) like they threw basketballs and footballs at me in gym|`|kA7GEKf7aa	Yesterday.

f5672a26fab7e5c22cacae4672148b8caa	No, it's tacky.  Save affection for in private.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	That's corny but they can do it.|`|AXAyuFW8aa	i have nothing against it unless they are getting funky on eachother lol.|`|y1gsXEwOaa	they can kiss on the bus all they wann :)<br>  i think its wonderful to be in love :)<br>  ?...|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	No problem. I don't care, I don't look.|`|OD3hxWxvaa	who cares???|`|qxteTM9Kaa	wrong|`|ZUL3drNgaa	I don't think so. Because there are littler kids on the bus, and they don't need to be exposed to stuff like that yet. It just makes them wanna do that and causes a WHOLE lotta drama in their lives.|`|S4y7V4diaa	I think it's only innapropriate when they are blocking people's ability to move. If they want to sit in a seat and kiss go for it.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	who cares, they're gonna kiss and f*** n have babies young anyway!|`|hi7uk4Kmaa	It's not wrong.. just kind of awkward.<br>  I mean the bus? It's stinky and crowded..ew|`|2734495ebe0db7825a50002a0b17e3edaa	Duuuuuuude!  It's not wrong if it's done right!  Duuuuuuude!|`|JERUmEFzaa	Kids in high school can kiss on the bus I see no problem with that but if their doing it than that`s a huge problem. It`s not wrong at all.. If grown adults can kiss than what about us?|`|jAURKrKYaa	a lot more than that goes on on our buses|`|WQ1sjTPDaa	no problem|`|0Ww9gRkSaa	i think that unless it is a little goodbye peck or something that it is fine, but totally not a makeout session. that is just rude. and too much PDA.|`|G799DSpIaa	No they shouldn't. Adults don't do that.  Why should kids.|`|Svgc3izpaa	Well I will say it shouldn't be up to the bus driver to stop them.  But it is really tacky.|`|zQiDbp7aaa	oh yeah, if you dont kiss on the bus, what's the point of riding it?!!|`|hsvgllTwaa	public display of affection (PDA) <br>  IS<br>  NOT<br>  NICE...<br>  when your single! lol|`|BE5HlQseaa	its not wrong but if the girl wants her first one to be romantic.. well that isn't the case. LOL|`|3USeMWKYaa	It ain't wrong.|`|U9XYsVyRaa	i honestly have no problem with it. as long as they're not ripping their clothes off or getting in other people's way then it's fine.|`|C7kETIplaa	i do not see anything wrong with it|`|2r6ZJz13aa	why would that be wrong?|`|Ji0akFDGaa	peck on the cheek goodbye is fine but no one wants see ur make out session|`|YKSF6aoraa	i have no problem with it, as long as they are not getting naked.|`|nZgDqymHaa	no it's not let them do what they want.
8t1JCFMSaa	I used to love "V".  It starred Marc Singer.  I believe they cancelled the series before they could wrap up the storyline.  I hope they do bring this show back.|`|AA10127726	Love the  2 mini series and the follow up tv series. Have them all on DVD.<br>  <br>  I think remaking it is a mistake. They will not be able to recapture the magic of the original.<br>  <br>  I am not a fan of remakes.<br>  <br>  i won't watch or the new Battlestar Galactica, they changed too much of the story so it really wasn't the same thing.<br>  <br>  At least with all the follow up Star treks they were different and not trying to re do what was done.|`|AA12081834	Yes.<br>  <br>  They are going to do what!?! Why...can't they just leave stuff alone.

Ji0akFDGaa	a lot but i try not to dwell on the past. i try to focus on what is going on now because it is a gift that is why it is called the present.|`|rAfg747daa	Yeah sort of.|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	I do that all the time.<br>  Always thinkin of my past & the future.!<br>  sometimes i gotta stop that and worry about the present.! =]|`|8d6BxvGmaa	a lot|`|ZUL3drNgaa	a LOT. <br>  It's weird how much stuff I'm learning about in the world that i was so in the dark about when i was younger. All these bad things that your parents tell you and you hear about on the news really can happen, and it's all really close, too. When you're younger, you just never know it because you're so young and want to believe the best in people. It's like i had an invisible barrier around me and now its taken off.|`|i2NqmsBeaa	Sometimes cry sometimes laugh, because i moved away. And i remember all the good times i had with friends. So mostly every couple of weeks|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	Too Often.|`|uqLUKbMbaa	We all do this from time to time.  I do it when we go to the supermarket for the weekly shopping and think what things used to cost way back when.  Ithink nothing of paying 99p for a lettuce, but there was the time when 99p would have paid for our weekly shopping.  I look back and remember, but realistically, I do not dwell on it.  Things were what they were and now are what they are.  As for the future, who knows?  Alanagh and I live for today.|`|30RlXHX3aa	Once a week, before I fall asleep I like to think back on my good times. My favorite thing to remember is Kindergarten is was the best time of my life. I would do anything to go back|`|9037862f87a0ed1123b9f10a378a0c7faa	too often but only cause i look back at the good times and yea the future scares me sometimes lol but i guess ill just have to wait and see|`|eTOrwG1Maa	more and more, especially with all the problems going on right now that are affecting everyone, not just a select few.|`|S4y7V4diaa	All the time|`|JERUmEFzaa	A lot of times.. But I usually try to forget.|`|ymK1hg2Raa	almost every minute of every day. no joke!!|`|cxnrP97taa	never ever look back>!>!>!>.|`|jpGNV4Qhaa	kool!|`|mYeq5AvFaa	i don't know|`|QUgj0nb5aa	Actually, I do wonder that! I wonder if I will be able to raise my kids the same way my parents raised me, or weather laws will prohibit that. And I remember my old house, my old cat, my grandpa's, how the worlds changed since my parents and my grandarents were kids, stuff like that! Probably about once or twice at night every 2 weeks. I often wish more than once though that I had a do-over button, so that I could go back and take things that I said back, or say things I should have. I wish I could change some things I have done in the past, but I try to live with it and make do with the present! =)|`|tYk1G8Qlaa	I do. I remember when i was a kid and walking to school by myself and walking to a friends place and to the corner store and playing at the park without my parents and still got home safe but now days  you can't let your child out of the front door ( so to speak) without worrying they will be shot, raped or even kidnapped. Bring back the good old days when everyone looked out for one another,|`|mber3JoAaa	Fairly often and I normally realise things have changed for the worse. I normally decide it's best not to depress myself by thinking about how things will be done in the future.|`|zqOnNF2Gaa	I am older so I look back a lot and I usually giggle at how stupid I was then.  I still am excited about what the future holds...especially technology-wise.|`|1wWSzEAOaa	Like all the time, and i like how i see things in the future at the moment.|`|LSXdwRDUaa	I do it at night before i go too bed<br>  I would look back at good times and bad<br>  and how those time make my new life.|`|GNcHTLisaa	like almost everyday but try not to cause some times it makes me sad =( like today march 4 last year my grandparents came and stayed with me for 6 months! yea today is kinda sad =(|`|HT1Ng5yxaa	I know. I know. I KNOW!!!! GOSH!!!! hehe|`|uORkBZOKaa	pretty often|`|RTHWQvkzaa	A LOT! I have a lot of good memories and they always come back when I least expect them....|`|ie0jVY23aa	I do it probably more than I should... but dwelling on it just makes me sad.|`|lfJ5Jxxwaa	I don't remember|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	alot of the time. but just got to get on with things|`|cSo0WNQnaa	a lot of the  time....tho I don't dwell on it|`|usZgu97Jaa	sometimes too much and sometimes too little. i tend to look back and remember the bad things that have happened more than the good. i think most people end up doing this and sometimes dont even realize this|`|4YbfiZGWaa	Way to often.|`|Svgc3izpaa	A few times a day!|`|yJek3Pwyaa	When ever I can't sleep

DIxbib1paa	Its gotta be Predator for me, firstly, It means quite a lot to me because I used to watch It with my nan and she Is now dead. The movie Itself was made in 1987 for around $27 million and In my opinion Is far superior for Its time, the simplicity of It Is what makes It, a hunter who hunts the worlds most dangerous animal, man, not just any man but a special forces group and takes them out with relative ease. With this happening you have the build up of suspence, thinking "Arnie Is gonna get his a*s handed to him", obviously this doesnt happen because Its Arnie were talking about. I can watch It every day and never get bored!|`|whbxWMqHaa	There are many movies that I consider to be great. For my favorites I would have to pick the alien saga. Not because I am a sci-fi geek (im not) but because I like horror films and that particular monster set the stage for countless other hits. The best part of the saga would have to be the second one. It has a spectacular story with a perfect cast and the right amount of action and suspense so that you don't get bored of one or the other. I find it funny that wardimus posted predator as his favorite after mine. I guess its alien versus predator all over again. Predator is excellent to.|`|AA11521270	Slumdog Millionare is the best movie. Not only does it have the Best Picture Oscar to prove it, but it also has a huge fan base. Critics loved it, audiences love, there is a peace meeting involved..lol..It was just a great reality bite for me, and i'm sure it hit a lot of ppl emotionally too..Great movie|`|FsFp4f1Yaa	I am Legend is the best movie. This is because it has Will Smith. How is this relevant, because Will Smith sexy and any movie with him should praised.  Thats why! LOL :D|`|l0Ye97Hjaa	All About Eve - the movie is so great it speaks for itself.<br>  "Fasten your seatbelts, its going to be a bumpy night!"|`|j4TVdVOZaa	any movie with johnny depp is pretty amazing!! but best movie ever??

I think the ULTIMATE song would be Lucky by Colbie Caillat & Jason Mraz...<br>  If my boyfriend played that for me.. oh wow.. amazing ;) I don't need to say anymore :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|T5DbLLgQaa	Try "Seeds Of Love" by Loreena McKennitt!|`|fBSgY0C9aa	um <br>  <br>  hey there delilah, 1234- plain white t's|`|wIS0jEMKaa	Someone sent me a song & I just fell in love with it recently.

yVDaoZTpaa	Its extraa fun!<br>  I loved it! Here:<br>  The Empress (Myung Se Bin) is in her early 30s, but she is still not married. Since, the 1st successor to the throne died, the royal family is in search for a new successor. Incidentally, they come to know of a young man who was in fact a son of the prince to a woman who left the Palace for her to be able to keep her pregnancy a secret. The young man's name was Lee Hoo (Se7en), more commonly known to his friends as Kang Hoo. Lee Hoo worked as a delivery boy at a Chinese restaurant, and was known for his 7-minute maximum delivery time. Lee Hoo had been brought up as more of a punk than a prince so his habits and his way of conversing were very different from the people of royal blood. Although he had never dreamt of living in the Palace, he one day finds himself immersing himself in its grandeur and improving himself to prove that he indeed deserves to be called the Successor to the throne.<br>  <br>  He soon finds out that not only will he be facing lessons to the path of royalty, and dilemmas of love and of stature, but he will also learn to compete for the position he had been, first and foremostly, called for.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  That summary i got from here<br>  <a href="http://www.mysoju.com/goong-s/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mysoju.com/goong-s/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  or you could also use this<br>  <a href="http://www.dramacrazy.net/v/korean-drama/goong-s/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dramacrazy.net/v/korean-drama...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine? please and thank you!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApJUEUd0M8qQzaRW.OfahSHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304130614AADoZiA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

It is her job after all. haha|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Take it from a New Joizeean that is no Jersey accent by Rhea. She is indeed from Brooklyn and speaks as if she is. Maybe she can put on a Jersey accent cause she is an actress after all, but her real accent is that of a Brooklynite. If you want a real Jersey accent look at Joe Pesci he does it justice as he should being that he is from NJ.

7G0IyCltaa	I can say with all certainty: Yes.<br>  <br>  I'm just finding this out now, as I just reconnected with an old boyfriend from twenty years ago.  We both had some issues that since then, have resolved.  As we matured over the years, some of the things have changed, and some of the anger that we brought into the relationship just aren't there anymore.  Yet, in so many ways, we are still the same people who found each other so interesting back then.  We still share the same interests, even more so, now that we've expanded.<br>  <br>  What's the outcome?  Unknown.  Right now, we live 1500 miles apart, and he is in a committed relationship.  Why he chose now to find me, I'm not sure; however,  it was only recently that I realized what had gone wrong, and how differently I saw and understood things.<br>  <br>  I don't know what your "wrong" time is.  For me, we were too immature and screwed up.  If that's a similar case, there's probably nothing you can do about it.  If it's because one of you is in a relationship, I say to always follow your heart.  You only live once.|`|4nQVsEHnaa	yes...in fact, Im in that situation now...you just have to be patient and work through it|`|lILfQh6xaa	i think so. It has happened to me all the time. LOL! I think if it is meant to be, then it will happen hon. Patience.

They always dragged on and on and on about the "preppy pretty kids" and then suddenly one of them goes off to date Hillary Duff and Nicole Richie. Nicole Richie! By far the second most glamorous little bratty princess in America (Next to Paris of course).<br>  <br>  <br>  Wow I just sounded like a middle schooler.

fP05U8Neaa	For me, defense is just a better fit.<br>  <br>  I think laying hits is so much fun, and it seems like we have a lot more unity on Defense than the guys on Offense do.

Y1aAGPURaa	A lady from a foreign country who could not understand much English wasn't feeling well and went to see her doctor. After examining her he said, "You are pregnant. Please understand that you have an insufficient passage and if you have a baby it will be a miracle."<br>  <br>  The lady rushed home crying and told her husband, "The doctor says I'm pregnant and I have a fish in the passage and if I have a baby it will be a mackerel!"<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  A man took his pregnant wife to the hospital to give birth. The doctor told them that they'd developed a new machine and asked if the couple would like to try it out. The machine could take some of the pain of childbirth from the mother and give it to the father to ease the mother's burden.<br>  <br>  Well, they thought that was a good idea, and decided to give it a try. The doctor initially set the machine on 10 percent, telling the man that even 10 percent was probably more pain than he'd ever experienced. But the husband was surprised at how little pain he was feeling, and asked the doctor to raise the level.<br>  <br>  The doctor increased it to 20 percent, and when the man still felt fine, he raised it to 50 and finally 100 percent.<br>  <br>  After it was all over, the man stood up, and stretched a little. Both he and his wife felt fine, and they shortly left the hospital to take the baby home.<br>  <br>  It was then that they found the mailman dead on their doorstep.|`|mqxEw2daaa	punch him in the stomach and shout "homemade abortion"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  woo i'm gonna get thumbs down.

He can take me to a place where I can see what he is feeling, or I can feel what he is saying I suppose.  I can close my eyes and put together all the history I know of him and feel its influence on the music.  I love the Native American influence, the British and American influences.  I also feel I connect to the subjects in his songs.

It was a very simple song. Really, I think it's a 3 or 4 chord number, but there was something so different about it and I thought to myself (I still remember the exact thought of my internal monologue) "I had no idea they made music like this." Just the catch of the hook, the way it was gritty but incredibly pleasant at the same time with this quirky thing to it. I actually think of that feeling in relation to that song (Perfume V) and am not sure that it's really explainable in the context of the song. Maybe not at all.|`|TzpYUWxoaa	panic at the disco- pretty much changed my music taste for the good... every song off there first album i can feel Ryan rosses pain when he talks or brendon sings rather about his alcoholic father and every time i listen to there most reasent one It reminds me of just laying outside in the grass in the spring time watching clouds  go by its so peaceful|`|7914f974f3cd0a96cc6883956102da35aa	The memories.<br>  Pretty much every Motley Crue song brings me a happy memory, something good that happened while I was listening to the song.|`|cbZdeOSPaa	The Scorpions are of sentimental value to me...my 1st metal band to ever hear of, it also reminds me of my deepest emotions, fears and childhood memories. At the time when my grandmother died I was traumatized because even though I didn't cry right when she died...after a while I was afraid of death, couldn't go out because I thought I was going to die...felt alone even when people were there..the song Send Me An Angel would bring me to tears, well pretty much everything brought me to tears..watching the news, etc I couldn't help crying it was such a strong feeling...I felt like as if I didn't exist, it was just horrible, took me about 3 months to get rid of those horrible feelings. Their song Wind of Change brings back memories of good and not so good events in my childhood. So there, that's why I cherish that band so much, nobody understands just me.

That's the one thing we all can take for granted sometimes, that being our good health, so I can’t even imagine what you must be going through.  I can’t think of many ideas beyond what you already mentioned if you aren’t feeling well enough to get out of bed.  There’s always television and movies.  I could tell you to start watching all four seasons of LOST on DVD.  Other than that, there’s not much else.  I’d say stick around the old R&P for a while.  We’ll have some cheap laughs, make fun of some really lame bands and before you know it, you’ll be feeling a lot better.

It just creates extra hassle for builders etc working with all the cameras around them, so it makes sense for the homeowners to get paid for this and the fact that they are on tv anyway|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	I don't actually know for sure H but I think anybody who goes on tv must get paid otherwise there wouldn't be a programme as people wouldn't bother.|`|3FKMMoXkaa	ofcourse thats obvious
yNbGq4viaa	Marcus Belby was a Ravenclaw student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who was considered for membership in the Slug Club in 1996. His uncle Damocles created the Wolfsbane Potion. However, Marcus' father was not on good terms with the famous potioneer, and for this reason, Horace Slughorn ultimately passed Marcus over. <br>  <br>  On the 24th of May 2008, the actor playing Belby, Robert Knox, was stabbed to death by Karl Bishop, while defending his younger brother outside a bar.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	huh ?!|`|TfOfVRYnaa	<a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Marcus_Belby" rel="nofollow">http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Marcus...</a><br>  <br>  He's a kid who wanted to be in the Slug Club, but Slughorn didn't want him.|`|XFQQ0ZtXaa	The actor playing Belby was named Robert Knox.<br>  He was killed when he was stabbed to death by Karl Bishop while defending his younger brother outside of a bar.|`|uyXfPDzDaa	Oh him<br>  he's a Ravenclaw student who is a year ahead of Harry|`|o9xn5OnJaa	the half blood prince is out?|`|0xO8Y98uaa	Harry met Belby on the train during his first lunch with Slughorn.

ZyGyDLsDaa	What Planet Are You From? (2000)<br>  starring Garry Shandling, Annette Bening, John Goodman, Greg Kinnear, Ben Kingsley, Richard Jenkins, Linda Fiorentino, Camryn Manheim, Ann Cusack<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  A highly-evolved planet, whose denizens feel no emotion and reproduce by cloning, plans to take over Earth from the inside by sending an operative, fashioned with a humming, mechanical penis, to impregnate an earthling and stay until the birth. The alien, Harold Anderson, goes to Phoenix as a banker and sets to work finding a mate. His approaches to women are inept, and the humming phallus doesn't help, but on the advice of a banking colleague, he cruises an AA meeting, meets Susan, and somehow convinces her to marry. The clock starts to tick: will she conceive, have a baby, and lose Harold (and the child) to his planet before he discovers emotion and starts to care? <br>  <br>  The second one doesn't sound familiar, but I'll look around.|`|IXT67mbraa	your not really alive.

jLYxs1RMaa	The Speed of the Sound is probably my favorite, and I have a really weird reason for it too. x]<br>  <br>  <br>  When my family and I went to Maui for vacation about 2-3 years ago, they would play that song atleast once EVERY day, and we usually heard it while we were driving through the sugar cane fields, wind blowing in the grass... AHAHA, yeah, the song just reminds me of the place, and I think of it every time I hear the song. =S They also tended to play clocks every once in a while, which also goes kind of well with Hawaii. <br>  <br>  Oh, and yellow's also one of my favorites.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Politik.<br>  <br>  First Coldplay song I ever heard, and still my favorite.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Uh, Roakie? Do you realize the case hasn't even gone to court yet? The similarity is a fairly simple and common chord progression ... which, by the way, you can also hear in Petula Clark's "My Love" from the 1960s. Should Petula Clark sue Satriani *and* Coldplay? It's ridiculous ... Coldplay have four albums out.

YHcOS0Sfaa	yes! he just like dumped melissa when  he made a real commitment to her! he is not a real man if he handled it like that. I think if he were to tell her that he has feelings for someone else, and said that he loves her but not that way or something he would have handled it better. and its sad because i think (other girl forgot her name at the moment!) was a rebound or something because things were not as good as he wanted them to be with melissa.|`|BwHoLEHvaa	I think Jason would have handled it differently.  He wouldn't have "dumped" Melissa on air; he would have done it privately.<br>  <br>  I think, because of his contract with the show, when he told them what he was feeling & that he made a mistake...they took it upon themselves to make it public.<br>  <br>  I think they told Jason how the "dumping" would go and what to say on the show.  They wanted to bump up their ratings & figured this would do it!|`|552a230b78bc5b4160481e32addc49e6aa	The fact is he did talk to Melissa before the programming of After The Rose Ceremony part 1, as he stated on the Jimmy Kimmel Show, but had to wait to break it off on the show, due to the contract he was under. He even stated they had many talks on part 1. So, sadly enough she new what was coming, having some heads up.  The handling of HONESTY is one of the most difficult things one has to come to grips with. His decision to face honesty must have been very tough knowing the world was watching and the haters would be coming out it strobes.  The fact that he did this regardless says a lot.  My head tells me he should have took more time to think, the TV show said he has to pick one or the other having no time to think.  I truly think he loved Melissa and he felt she was the one, however, the 6 weeks after together anything could have happen to change his mind.  My heart tells me he did the right thing in the end, it's too bad he had to hurt someone in the process though.  All of us at some point have been there or will be there where we hurt someone or we get hurt.  Love is said to be worth it all.  The world is filled with people who marry and divorce, so who's to say what is best for someone.  Just because some of us loved Melissa, doesn't mean he has to stay in a relationship that wouldn't work.  Better to know now than years from now, especially with a child involved.  I know one thing for sure we are responsible for our own happiness in the end.|`|NwYwLdsNaa	Yes, he could have told Melissa without the cameras.  Then see how she wanted to deal with him and the abc execs.  :(|`|6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	It is exactly what they all deserve for putting themselves in that situation.<br>  So, I don't feel sad or bad about it.<br>  It is done, and it is over.|`|QUrqswahaa	Not really.  We are dealing with information that the show wants us to have and not all the facts.  Based on that information, we have to think he did what he thought was right.  If I were on the "inside track", I might feel differently.  It is a tv show created to entertain, keep people buzzing/talking.  Seems they have done their job.|`|RtHBnYSmaa	No, he handled it perfectly in my eyes. The whole thing - the crying, the break-up, the fidgeting, the name calling - was hilarious and highly entertaining.|`|ssdl5qL5aa	No. He's only human. Nothing in life goes perfectly and planned. Plus he stated on Jimmy Kimmel that the show made him wait to break it off with Melissa until the After the Final Rose show.|`|3b2a23def10204c05ae687cb086abe96aa	He could have given a real reason other than "it changed"

HgSMQrTfaa	I know, right?<br>  Middle school and elementary school were so much better...|`|eoUHF4x2aa	When ya mama says 'enjoy High School while it lasts because they gone be the best years of your life', she means you got it easy until you leave it. <br>  After that you got heavy responsibilities and you gone be working till you die.<br>  <br>  Live it up cause you aint gone be as free as you are in High School.|`|YlMR42agaa	Yea but it's drama and people love drama so maybe that's why they make so many crappy highschool movies. If you have to live it it not fun!!!! If you going to look at it ...yea it's kinda fun.............<br>  <br>  BY HIGHSCHOOL YOU GET SOOO TIRED OF LOOKING THE SAME PEOPLE IN THE FACE EVERYDAY!!!|`|79b2yM3saa	Gawd. i'm a freshman and i'm up to my neck in hw!!!<br>  and the sports are soooo intense its not even funny or fun anymore. not to mention the stress of getting good grades so i can go to college somewhere nice, and all the other crap we have to go thru!|`|RTzZYYSqaa	couldn't agree more,<br>  shiiiit school, boy problems, grade problems, staying up till midnight to finish a paper, haaatee school|`|v0p45HNXaa	Yes, it is way overrated. I have never used anything I learned in biology or calculus in my daily life.|`|lXXuF0T4aa	I liked HS up until senior year.<br>  then i HATED it.|`|0BokF6ceaa	i wouldnt know i am only a freshman but so far i have been alright|`|cdMc0A8Waa	Yeah, i hate when people say high school should be the best years of your life. BULLSH*T!!!  <br>  I'm a junior and i absolutely hate high school! The teachers don't care about teaching anymore, you can't trust ANYONE, and everything gets harder. It seems like you need more requirements to get into college now too. <br>  High school is sooooooo boring!!! I'm literally counting down the days till spring break then summer vacation!!! I have never been so stressed out in my life. It effects everything. Relationships, grades, friends. . . .need i say more. And you don't have time for anything cuz your always doing schoolwork! <br>  I'm desperately hoping college will be 10x better. . . .or that i win the lotto so i can dropout! LOL.<br>  Here's hoping for all of us!|`|LUQdXsMFaa	I'll have to admit that high school is probably the most stress you will EVER have to endure in your life. Your taking a billion classes at one time and have them every day, everyone is judging you and quite frankly staying up till 4 am doing homework is NO GOOD. Most people say high school is overrated and COLLEGE is the best 4 years of your life. think about it. no parents, you don't have to pay for **** on your own, and you can party pretty much whenever. so don't sweat it you'll make it through, but don't stress so much its not worth it haha.|`|kFnBlYTraa	High school is soo much drama.!<br>  it pisses me off. most of the time.<br>  and half of the time i dont even wanna go.because its like omg whos gonna start a fight over a dude today.or drama for no reason.lol.|`|9a8ad2bd74ef14daf7f98aee3567f253aa	seriouslyyy high school girls are SO catty. <br>  including myself =P<br>  <br>  but yeah, i don't like it that much. but i'm only a sophomore so i don't know...maybe it'll get bettter senior year, where you can party it up =]|`|3gljWitCaa	oh my god<br>  i hate high school<br>  too much drama and fakeness<br>  <br>  i graduate this year :) im so happy to be out of this prison!<br>  definetly NOT the best years of my life<br>  <br>  hollyy|`|dUL5fYpsaa	I despise high school. senior year is a joke and its pointless. 2 more months of hell. woo.|`|dIlp6xvfaa	Indeed, full of drama, jerks, & fake $luts.|`|74IQlMkLaa	High school is horrible. Especially if your a guy because of those fist fights *shiverrs*|`|x5N1PO4haa	Couldn't agree with you more!!|`|BhQSTvLsaa	FACK YEAH!|`|R5mmX9Woaa	I don't know, haven't been there yet|`|mPLXUorTaa	High school was fun for me.  I had a lot of fun, even though there were a ton of problems.  You just have to deal with your problems.  It can be stressful, but try to enjoy not having to work as hard as you will later in life.|`|766d5b80d7a637c2204d9d127fb86200aa	Yeah High School sucks and you're right, it's VERY overrated. Greatest years of someone's life MY A$$!!! That's not how it's going with me. Elementary school was definitely some of the best years of my life. :D|`|6p50zivoaa	Heck yeah high school is sooo over rated.|`|BXbnLxNJaa	haha I hear ya man. They should really tell you that the teenage years are the most akward, confusing and disappointing years of your life.

There was a Gravel County road by our home. It was late summer, near the end of Summer Vacation and School was starting in days.<br>  <br>  My Younger Brother and I decide to ride our Bikes down the County Road sans our shirts. We are going down a steep hill. My Front tire drifts to the pile of Gravel in the center of the Road at the crest of the hill. The Bike flipped forward. I did not let go, and instead of me riding my bike down the hill, my bike road me down the hill.<br>  <br>  I didn't think I was hurt that bad, so I hopped on my bike and road home. That night when I took a bath, and laid down in the tub, OUCH! The Pain of the Burn! I then looked in the mirror and saw where I had several rips in my back due to the gravel burns. It was a painful first six weeks of gym doing sit ups.|`|rAfg747daa	I'd crash into an up coming tree and boom crash bang ahahahhahahh . . .. . .. . ..

PCAlAoDsaa	Yes Aquarius and Leo are compatible for each other. They are polar opposites and opposites attract to each other. They get along with each other very good<br>  <br>  There is this sales insurance agent who I love very much and he is a very hot, attractive, handsome and sexy man who has a great and fantastic body. His whole body is perfect and excellent in every way. His name is Robert C. Reisig. He is a Aquarius and I am a Leo.<br>  We get along with each other very good.|`|wu2g3BtRaa	yes<br>  <br>  I just read the link that material girl gave and some of it made sense but i have to tell you that i am a leo and most of my friends, both male and female, as well as my boss who i adore,  are aquarians.  my dad was one, my best gf is one, many bf's were one and my boss is one; i'm always drawn to aquarians (and sags too by the way), but most definitely aquarians and my birthday is aug 7.  i will say, however, that my moon is in gemeni so maybe that "air" sign helps me with the air sign aquarius.|`|6kkXEpMKaa	of course.. they're a good match,they respect each other|`|plBXp91Daa	Read this link:<br>  <a href="http://www.starlightastrology.com/leo-aqua.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.starlightastrology.com/leo-aq...</a><br>  <br>  But then again don't base your relationship to much on astrology/starsigns.It isn't always true what they say.
Klw3Ke3Haa	There may be because there has been a lot of different animes made over the years, but I don't know of any though. Sorry.
Klw3Ke3Haa	Not a chance. Being President of my favorite animation studio would be totally awesome, but it wouldn't be worth changing my outer or inner image though.|`|GFndpsBaaa	I assume you mean CEO or Board head.<br>  <br>  But anyway, sure.

9AAGosuiaa	terrific Question<br>  <br>  when people say we don't consume music in the way that people once did its very true and the fact is that we still have amazing artists creating remarkable music so what has changed?<br>  <br>   I have strong beliefs that it was the introduction of CDs in 1984/1985 that led to this feeling that somehow music does not "mean" what it once did. CDs are fine as far as the top end but it does not reproduce bottom ends as a vinyl record does. <br>  <br>  You simply can not lose yourself in a record in quite the same way. I love listening to vinyl and  there is nothing like the feeling of putting the needle to an album and feel it engulfing you in its world?<br>  <br>  CDS are cold and impersonal and I believe that nothing beat the feeling of going to a record store and buying a record, taking it home and exploring the cover and the content inside while playing the record.<br>  <br>  And these days, what do we consume our music on? MP3s...<br>  they are worse than even CDs, more impersonal, too easy to access.. there is a generation that does not even know from records, cassettes or even CDs, hell they don't even have to go to a record store anymore.....<br>  <br>  EDIT: they still issue Vinyl records of new releases<br>  look online and for cool record stores in your area<br>  Best of luck, you are on the right track|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I think it's the sound, the mixing of the order of songs, maybe some nostalgia.  One thing I always love about my vinyls is the awesome cover art on the album covers.  That is just impossible to duplicate on a tiny CD cover.|`|pVnUhYLQaa	sounds raw (thats a good thing)<br>  <br>  nostalgia|`|bhLxYenEaa	They're gramophone records! Not all records are vinyl, only those made of polyvinyl chloride. The primary reason why I collect gramophone records, is because some, especially the rare ones, haven't and may never be released on CD or as digital media. I also love the scent of records!|`|2c9e27b528ec302c442a3ff42014807daa	Until you've heard a vinyl album through a tubed preamp/power amp you haven't heard the real warmth of the music. Digital is very cold and impersonal in comparison.|`|Vu4A83dyaa	Better quality. Plus they will soon be gone forever because of all of the new tech. So you could get some good money in the future.<br>  <br>  But I personally would never sell ANY of my vinyl collection!|`|Catsy82Caa	much better quality sound. better than any mp3 or cd. analog > digital|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Vinyl (and analog, for that matter) are real recordings of the actual sound.<br>  Digital music is a computer program of a sound.<br>  <br>  Plus, I just like the little scratchy noises they make. It adds to the baddassedness of my metal.|`|AGP2dI6uaa	Smoother range between the sounds.  As said above analog > digital.
ABkF5ZURaa	They're not emo. Trust me. They are alternative. Period. And frankly, my definition of an emo band does not include Paramore.|`|m5Qh7gYraa	They are not emo.<br>  Emo died in the late 90's.<br>  <br>  <br>  My chemical romance is Not emo either.|`|wwB3csfYaa	Nope not emo AT ALL!! I lover her, and her hair is more punk then emo. Your totally right!|`|UeGbG8Axaa	I love paramore to, they like my chemical romance? wow thats cool!!! I would NOT EVER EVER consider Paramore emo. I like my chemical romance and im not emo.  and hayley's hair, please her hair doesnt make her emo either! tons of people have very bright hair color lol. who ever thinks paramore is emo doesnt know crap|`|v8V6aUPwaa	I'm obsessed with Paramore too. They are not an emo band. People just think they because of they way they dress and the way they style their hair.|`|2BatkpPtaa	I don't think so.<br>  <br>  <br>  But, I don't really know much about them.|`|ZRv92zhvaa	My opinion...is that you must be a teenage girl. Emo hair? how the hell can hair be "emo"? <br>  <br>  Ive always had a problem with the emo label. Pretty much any genre of music thats emotional can be called emo. As for your question of are they pop/punk rock or emo - they could be considered both, since most "emo" bands are pretty much just pop/punk.
i9orREV5aa	Everyone sounds like crap on the phone. See if you have any friends who can record you with a half-decent mike to get a feel for where you stand right now.<br>  <br>  Having said that, you probably have a lot a potential if your friends already think that you're good. You should develop your voice further before making any rash decisions about whether or not you can sing.<br>  <br>  There's a lot of myths out there about singing. For some reason people think they need to be born with the skill and just magically sound amazing. Then, if it doesn't work out the first time people become ashamed and shut up forever missing out on one of life's great joys. They even say this on American Idol!<br>  <br>  Only 2% of people are truly tone-deaf, you're voice continues to grow until you're 30 and most people have to work at it.  I graduated from a Musical Theatre College program. It was a 3 year program. When I started there were 2 guys who sounded totally tone-deaf. By the end of the 3 years, 1 of them could carry a tune nicely and the other became a professional singer! <br>  <br>  If you're really interested in singing, look for a reputable vocal coach, not just anybody. If you're not getting anywhere with your coach, it's not your fault, keep looking until you find the right teacher and give it a good 3 years of study before you make any judgements about abilities.<br>  <br>  Go for it baby!|`|nToRMbiqaa	go try singing at kareoke in front of strangers see if you get positive or negative reactions|`|RiJwcVGkaa	Well phones have really bad recording systems. And when you talk your not actually hearing your actual voice, so it might have sounded bad to you when you heard it on a recording. But you could try recording yourself on a video camera, or sing karaoke and see people's reactions. Or sing in front of your parents. A good one is taking voice lessons and on the first lesson get a voice evaluation from the teacher and get your voice really good! If you like singing, you should go for it!!
vhy0k2dtaa	Try youtube. There are many great vocal teachers on there offering tips.
a1Ngi39Xaa	I think it's great!   I read about that yesterday.  I will be so glad to see Don Diamont again - even if it is on B&B.  They SO need some fresh blood on that show.  The Spencers are supposed to start airing in April.<br>  <br>  Felicia is way overdue for a good storyline!  I used to love Lesli Kay when she was on ATWT.<br>  <br>  I also read that they are reviving an old character.  Bryan Genesse will begin on March 12 playing Rocco Carner.  His character was last seen in 1989!  He is going to be one of the suspects in the who-tried-to-kill-Rick thing.|`|LO3BMobRaa	The Don Diamond part is going to be stupid. We've already known him as one charcter, and now he's coming back as another one, come on now.|`|MpbYCsygaa	I don't know what to think about that bc I'm not familiar with those ppl but I heard that Jacob Young was supposed to come back to B&B and I was really hoping it was true but it looks like it's just a rumor...

JYzxGeNaaa	Mars/Pluto is much more sexual.  Both of those planets rule Scorpio, which is the sign of Sex.  Also, Mars is the actual planet of sexual energy and desire and Pluto is the planet of passions and intense experiences. While, Venus is the planet of romance and attraction.  I'm sorry...but sex does not always have to do with romance. That's why the two planets (Venus and Mars) coincide and create ones sexual nature.  However, the bond between Mars and Pluto is a lot stronger than a bond between Venus and Pluto.|`|bvwYVGJOaa	I think Venus|`|67BjmuWUaa	I assume you are talking about an aspect between 2 charts.<br>  If that is the case then definitely mars pluto.<br>  Venus pluto could work as a business partnership, and is more likely to manifest itself as big money.

All you have to do is go to a mall, pre-order the dvd for about $27.00, the worker gives you a credit-card like card and you give it to the worker on March 20th.

akcGfgdcaa	I'm going to go for Goodfellas, although I think Godfather I and II are fantastic films, The combo of Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci was just fantastic.<br>  <br>  And easily one of the best pieces of dialogue in cinema:<br>  <br>  Henry Hill: You're a pistol, you're really funny. You're really funny.<br>  <br>  Tommy DeVito: What do you mean I'm funny?<br>  <br>  Henry Hill: It's funny, you know. It's a good story, it's funny, you're a funny guy.<br>  [laughs]<br>  <br>  Tommy DeVito: what do you mean, you mean the way I talk? What?<br>  <br>  Henry Hill: It's just, you know. You're just funny, it's... funny, the way you tell the story and everything.<br>  <br>  Tommy DeVito: [it becomes quiet] Funny how? What's funny about it?<br>  <br>  Anthony Stabile: Tommy no, You got it all wrong.<br>  <br>  Tommy DeVito: Oh, oh, Anthony. He's a big boy, he knows what he said. What did ya say? Funny how?<br>  <br>  Henry Hill: Jus...<br>  <br>  Tommy DeVito: What?<br>  <br>  Henry Hill: Just... ya know... you're funny.<br>  <br>  Tommy DeVito: You mean, let me understand this cause, ya know maybe it's me, I'm a little fu*ked up maybe, but I'm funny how, I mean funny like I'm a clown, I amuse you? I make you laugh, I'm here to fu*kin' amuse you? What do you mean funny, funny how? How am I funny?<br>  <br>  Henry Hill: Just... you know, how you tell the story, what?<br>  <br>  Tommy DeVito: No, no, I don't know, you said it. How do I know? You said I'm funny. How the **** am I funny, what the **** is so funny about me? Tell me, tell me what's funny!<br>  <br>  Henry Hill: [long pause] Get the **** out of here, Tommy!<br>  <br>  Tommy DeVito: [everyone laughs] Ya motherfu*ker! I almost had him, I almost had him. Ya stuttering prick ya. Frankie, was he shaking? I wonder about you sometimes, Henry. You may fold under questioning. <br>  <br>  ....classic.|`|yqe0I5zpaa	Goodfellas, it's based on a true story and the performances are just incredible. The cinemtography is breathtaking and of course who can resist Scorsese's direction. Both films in my opinion stand 1 and 2 in top films of all-time, but Goodfellas edges it.|`|3dcc2948a003c40d98c8ef0d9a516e9baa	Godfather--for the sole reason that I don't like anybody in Goodfellas.  The movie is great, it's well done.  But if I'm gonna pick between the two, I'll the pick the one where I didn't want to swat the main character from the first scene.

GUqL7Wtaaa	love them! :)<br>  they're voices are beautiful. i have not just heard them sing their songs with the band. but i have also heard them sing acapella [idk how to spell that] and it was the best singing ive ever heard. & that also proves that they DO NOT lip sync :]<br>  they went to a little girl's house who had lukemia and sang to her and hugged her. they are very sweet and kind guys. they have huge hearts and i have heard that from people who have met them. i have never ever heard one person who met them say that they weren't extremely nice.<br>  they are super cute. all three of them. gorgeous faces, amazing bodies, just freakin adorable.<br>  and lastly but most importantly, they make me sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo happy. i could care less about what anyone else has to say. love them or hate them, i dont care, because just looking at their pictures, videos, or hearing their voices makes me happy. i love them and their personalities. even if they weren't famous, i would still love them. it upsets me that other people go around saying horrible things about them because they are great guys & nothing about them is fake or anything. they did nothing to deserve being talked badly about. they deserve every bit of fame they have :)|`|7Np368AUaa	They are an inspriation toa everyone out there that even of you are rlly sick, even if you almost died you can still dream and dream big and make it some day.

Still here baby. <br>  <br>  Also, it seems they wont fade away any time soon. Given most jonas questions of here usually generate many answers. Either it be hateful, or kind ones..they're still getting the attention.<br>  <br>  Like I've said in many of my answers. The Jonas Brothers aren't like Nsync, The Backstreet Boys, Hanson, The Jackson 5, etc. You can't really explain what it is about them that makes people stick with them. All I can say is there just is. Sometimes the best answer is the simplest to begin with. The Jonas Brothers are good people. People want other good people to succeed. The Jonas Brothers will be around for a long time. Not because of their "looks" but because of who they are as people in general.|`|GilxwZ2Haa	Love them<br>  Insanely<br>  :)?|`|B3N388wBaa	They're annoying and ugly|`|5wUmIuWvaa	love them<br>  there amazing<br>  <br>  you should go listen to them..<br>  ..GO!

MvDu7hZmaa	Go Broadway.  It might not be a familiar genre,<br>  but kids love theatrical tunes once they're<br>  introduced.  Try something from WICKED...<br>  kids love the play and the music is off,<br>  as the kids say. the chizzain.<br>  <br>  Check out a few clips:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?hl=en&q=music%20for%20Wicked&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=w1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/results?hl=en&q=m...</a><br>  <br>  West Side Story has great music,<br>  as does Rent, and The Lion King.<br>  I've seen numbers from each one<br>  of these shows wow an audience.<br>  Be careful though.  I believe you <br>  have to ask for the rights to sing<br>  a copyrighted tune.  If funding is<br>  a problem, I suggest seeking out<br>  a foreign folk tune.  Something from<br>  Africa or Mexico could be<br>  spectacular and different enough<br>  to get you really noticed! <br>  <br>  And finally, don't neglect the power<br>  of costume.  Even a group with <br>  the same color, or style of shirt<br>  in different colors pulls a group<br>  together visually, and affects the<br>  way an audience listens. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your production!|`|UE9e10Avaa	any sheet music from your local music store should do. since i'm a girl that likes the sound of flowing, pretty, notes coming from the piano, i usually choose pieces that have the title 'drifting flight','canterbury bells', etc. have fun hunting for music.

Talk as little as possible.  Your throat, voice box, & neck muscles need a good rest.  And you know that shouting is not the same as singing.  Shouting strains.  Learn to stop shouting.  Shouting will get you in trouble every time.  Give it a rest.  Amen.|`|AA11693850	You will most likely need a vocal coach.

I would explain to them that 74% of girls who rebel and get into major trouble do so because they feel like their parents are socially and environmentally oppresive. Basically that although your father is trying to teach you a lesson and keep you safe, he is actually drastically increasing the odds of you going crazy one day and turning into a pregnant crack whore all in an insane attempt to spite them for their years of holding you back from experiencing small risks.

Anyways, It landed on the back-pack and she didn't know were it landed. So she's trying to find it right? So, I'm in the other seat looking at her and her squirming for it, and she's actually rubbing it agaisnt the bus seat. But it's almost like she's trying to. cuz she thought it fell underneith it so she rubbed it and I finally yelled SABRA!!!!!! And she's like wat?!?!?! It's on ur BAG!! OR I MEAN BUS SEAT.. What??? Omg, I totally rubbed it on there!! But when she was looking for it, I pissed my self sooooo hard that there was a HUGE puddle in the seat!! I had to walk hom e in humiliation!!! Ugh!!!|`|we5ZYfzsaa	what's a polygon?<br>  a dead parrot! :) lame enough to make me and my friends laugh
lpyWVR2oaa	Hey there, I see you and your entanglement with this 'Mystery Virgo Dude' is causing you a lot of stress and unhappiness so I heartily suggest open, honest communication with him i.e. when you catch him in one of his right moods ** lol **<br>  <br>  They have a tendency to vacillate and go back and forth like all mutable signs do so you'd have to forgive him. It's just his NATURE and if you really can't accept that, i think it's better for you to cut off ties (incorporate the Scorpion traits) and move on . He isnt going to change and the question is whether you are willing to accept and love him for that. <br>  <br>  The poor dude is probably feeling confused and hesitant himself and what he needs most is possibly reassurance and trust...and mutable signs like him tend to leave one door open to the past..hence, that accounts for the msn thingy...

zakbw4Uhaa	Yeah I had some major problems with my unicorn. His name is Charleston. Now he refuses to go anywhere with me.|`|S85ux209aa	dude just fly with your unicorn power or transport..duh! I mean if your unicorn is a begginer then she can take free lessons from the amazing instructor. His name is baybay! he is awesome. He lives on the north side of narnia but it takes about two weeks so if you really need to fly or transport buy some unicorn dust..just make sure not to sniff it. I always get so high off that stuff. but if you must take a plane or whatever. you can pick up a unisa [unicorn visa] at the westren bank in narnia. <br>  <br>  Hope that Helped. :)|`|UF64MzAsaa	are you ok??|`|QSUg9vNLaa	no,<br>  But you can get a magical fuzzy fairy to get him a global monkey passport, then you take him to the airport and go through the luggage check and there is the airplane entrance and then your unicorn can get to america.|`|fLKN5nbkaa	hahhahahahhahahahahahhahhahhahahahahahah...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ...not.|`|QXnZy9m2aa	Sorry but his horn would be considered a weapon.<br>  That would make him a terrorist because  the horn is attached to his body.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	lmao... i just broke out in laughter looking at this question....lol|`|GfZDDt4Vaa	yea but u r goin to need some powerful connections|`|IbxhRebgaa	I know you're lying about having a unicorn and here's why:<br>  <br>  I asked Jack LaLanne and he told me there's no such thing as a male unicorn. <br>  <br>  Jack LaLanne 's words.

Avoid the hassle ya know.|`|m7NEFMJJaa	we can smuggle her in for 40 grand like they did that chimpanzee :-)|`|nFW93eDLaa	No it's gonna need a green card or in it's cases rainbow card and possibly it's magical invisible powers to get through if failure occurs|`|BGmZ2ps5aa	just fly him in illegally i wont tell i promise :X<br>  otherwise ur gonna need a green card... no a purple card >.><br>  and many shots [sadly not the alchoholic kinda the poky *ouch!* kind :(]<br>  also teach him english...

oYdsU2ROaa	A potato is a root vegetable<br>  and a pumpkin is sometimes  referred to as a "gord" which means a farm fruit<br>  Okay in my health book here lol it's says that everything which has a seed is a vegetable so tomatoes,eggplants,pumpkins and string beans are considered as fruits....<br>  String beans are considered both a fruit and a vegetable<br>  and a tomato is both a fruit and a vegetable ...Fruits contain seeds and vegetables are non-seed and containing plant matter they include leaves such as cabbage , lettuce <br>  A tomato and string beans are both a fruit and vegetable due to culinary purposes...<br>  A botanist would disagree and say tomato and string beans are only fruits|`|q9BItD25aa	A fruit has seeds<br>  Vegetables have bulbs and roots<br>  We consider a lot of fruits as vegetables.<br>  Tomatos, green peppers, string beans are all considered fruits.............

What she did was "racist", but it was meant lightheartedly...not in an offensive way.<br>  <br>  Many people her age act like this.  But, unfortunately for Miley, SHE can't.  People will be outraged at it, and she should've known it would happen.  It's her fault.  She deserves all the backlash she's getting for not being careful.<br>  <br>  Is she a good role model?  I never thought she was, and this kinda proves it.  But should we be offended by her "Racism"?  Def. not.|`|bmwR7RdMaa	she's out of control.......<br>  hopeless miley........|`|5c079cb1c9fa7ffe7d3cdc8fa57061a6aa	LOOK EVERYONE DOES IT<br>  <br>  BUT NOT FOR FUN OR TO BE RACISTS<br>  <br>  THERE WAS AN ASIAN GUY IN THAT PIC<br>  <br>  I'M SURE HE'S STILL FRIENDS WITH MILEY<br>  <br>  EVERYONE IS MAKING A BIG DEAL<br>  <br>  ESPECIALLY THE SUING THING|`|J5jI6VDvaa	It's not a big deal.

ecL0ZbfCaa	'The Beach Boys', I can't be angry or depressed when I listen to them.|`|zijhBbBaaa	COLDPLAY!<br>  They can change my mood with like every song (which a great song should do) as a band they really excite me and keep me wondering what are they going to do next and they are never aggressive, violent, mean, too sexual etc. But still reach out with out being extreme, loud or aggressive. There songs are great and inspire me to do something great like them.<br>  <br>  Some Kings of Leon songs inspire me too.|`|uxVIlXlvaa	well though i dislike the genre, i must say the band killswitch engage, all their songs have a deep metaphorical meaning to it, and always is philosophical. and all their songs also always deals with winning, fighting, and surviving.<br>  <br>  some nightwish songs are also very decent. though its not really winning as in winning, their meanings are more along the lines of winning in a losing situation. some songs i recommend are "angels fall first, end of all hope (one of my favs), bye bye beautiful, ever dream and 10th man down)|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Another vote for Killswitch Engage<br>  <br>  It's almost like I wrote some of those lyrics, they hit home so hard.|`|09fdLaeIaa	All-American Rejects|`|dFacbjIZaa	Rush and Triumph are that way for me.|`|B46t8gkLaa	jack johnson|`|woK6mApGaa	slayer and metallica. i get a certain feeling when i hear their songs|`|adLSRFrZaa	I find "Foxtrot (1972)" by Genesis to be a very inspiring album.

a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	Nathan was never governor.  He was running for Congress in the first season, and abdicated his seat in the second season.

I remember him in Brookside and of course when he came second on The X Factor against Leona, the guy is talented that's for sure!|`|soBqLlNAaa	No, I love Ray and don't think he's smug at all, he is a very talented young man who just happens to be good at whatever he does, he should win and yes, Colleen should be out on Sunday - don't like Zoe<br>  <br>  ~x~|`|DtU1EpoVaa	Yeas he should I think <br>  Yes see needs to go now am so bored of her <br>  Am sure she does she is just no good simples|`|VJnmHFR0aa	he's good, but he really should cut his hair, he looks so sleazy|`|IgEYfBPJaa	Yeh i want Ray to win too :)|`|AA10077992	I think he's a very good all-round performer - pleasant singer, nice little actor, good dancer and very good on the ice - I hope he wins|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	You are not alone Bex going on past answers on here but I really don't like Ray and don't think he should win either as he had unfair advantages over the others when he started.  He is so up himself too and he and his partner are so smug every week.    It is obvious he will win and that has spoilt the whole show for me because I like to be kept in anticipation up to the final.  I like Colleen but I do think she should be out this week - in fact she should have been out weeks ago.  Last week she was so painful to watch.|`|Um8osMNuaa	l think Ray's great, he's a little dynamo on then skates, and he'll win.<br>  <br>  l like Colleen, l think she should stay a little longer, she always makes me laugh with her comments, it is an entertainment programme, and she keeps me entertained.|`|6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	I like Ray Bex think he is fantastic on the ice and he did NOT do ice skating before like some say this is why some do not like him Bex.<br>  I give credit where credit is due he is good and he is a nice person seen him live when he sang.|`|FcHplZtQaa	Yes to both Qs Bex.....<br>  <br>  I like Ray, Why TF does everybody hate him???

As for Colleen - think yep maybe this Sunday the Timer has run out of sand !!!|`|LAdyqASxaa	I'm against you here Bex !!<br>  <br>  I really don't like him, he comes out every week thinking he has already won the show, you can just see it in his face. He in desperation to win this as he always comes runner up obviously, look at X Factor !!<br>  <br>  I had heard he was already and inline skater so he already had experience from that, and Jessica as well, 2nd on another ice skating show.<br>  <br>  I will agree it is time for Colleen to go though !!|`|3a9f3003abdd986d136bc7307c02868faa	Personally I can't stand him, hated him on the x factor, and hate him on this. He's too conceited, can't stand people like that, and so I hope he doesn't win to bring him down a peg or two.<br>  <br>  I like Colleen, think she is really giving it a go, but the skate off last week should have been her and jessica as I felt they had the weakest performances.|`|6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	Sorry Bex i'm with Phil - ROFL  -  although i wouldn't actually have said it myself.<br>  He was awful last week - he's too desperate to win everything, it's unatractive...   <br>  <br>  I hope he doesn't win - i'm getting the number in loadsa time this week so i can vote    ; )<br>  <br>  And yes coleen should have gone wks ago - ray and coleen have both got big families sitting with their fingers on redial lol|`|ZvxyqG3Paa	ray   is    the    best    out    the    lot    and     should   win    . <br>     but    it    looks    like   the     judges   ( jason ,  ruthie  )    have    picked    the    winner    already   ( zoe  ) <br>  <br>  i    like     colleen    but   i    think    she    should    walk    on   sunday   because    its    not    fair    on    the    decent    skaters    getting  voted    off    .<br>  i  love    donal   he    tries   the   hardest   out    of    all   of   them   and    deserves      to     stay    in  .|`|HL3cm1yGaa	Well, from the start he has been the best contestant, so deserves to win and I like him as well!<br>  As for Colleen, well she has not improved at all really has she and unlike Todd and John (in SCD), she does not entertain us so should have gone weeks ago, lets hope those "Loose Women" viewers get their phone disconnected before Sunday is all I can say!|`|lReSpTijaa	I agree Collen is by far the worst & should have gone on Sunday, Ray is by FAR the best skater & will win , that I am certain, But sorry Bex I'm with with Phil on this one .|`|76a2abe8e583e9295d0577810103916baa	I'm sure Ray will win and I don't mind if he does.

Some were true some were myths but wide spread enough that many thought they could be true. So the didn't reveal which ones were true until the end of the show so people could have time to try and guess about them. Sorry, I can't remember the exact name of show. I may have been "Urban Legends and Myths". The one you saw is very wierd<br>  and creepy. Did they make it seem there was evidence that it was true? Good lluck.

It is by far my favorite album of all time.<br>  <br>  "Free Jazz" by Ornette Coleman, sorry Coltrane, but I'd want this on an island, though "A Love Supreme" is on my mind.<br>  <br>  "The Beatles (White Album)" by The Beatles, because of its extravagace and the different styles of music on it.<br>  <br>  "Remain In Light" by Talking Heads, because I just want it.<br>  <br>  "Return to Cookie Mountain" by TV on the Radio, one name Tunde Adebimpe, and his singing.

pmJ5wOilaa	Good luck with your quest to prove HM is a faker, but just to let you know: it's 'lip syncs' not 'lip sings'. 'Lip syncs' refers to synchronizing the movement of the lips to the recorded track. Just so you know. :-)|`|k39bNUgeaa	Go on youtube and get her video of her using a body double<br>  <br>  When she leaves and the body double comes out the song doesn't change. So it proves she is lip syncing|`|NbjJiSJJaa	Of course that biottcchh lip sings while we least expect it....just not all the time, though.<br>  <br>  And that f u c ker lip sings on her show all the time, obviously.<br>  <br>  So tell your bffl to get BETTER TASTE IN MUSIC!!|`|i0pBS82Kaa	She does lip sync.<br>  At a concert she had to swith with another person who was dressed like her so she could change into a new outfit.<br>  The other person didn't even look at the crowd.<br>  <br>  People paid good money at her concert to hear her sing<br>  That was a rip off from what she did!<br>  <br>  *There is proof,<br>  search it on youtube.|`|kaz8z1yjaa	I wouldn't know, since I have never been to one of her concerts, but you can tell she's lip-syncing if she sounds exactly the same on stage as her recorded singing. She may also only lip-sync on the choruses.|`|cbf383accd5c9c730d94b724e132b113aa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxJ06CFncGQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxJ06CFnc...</a><br>  Just search on youtube, heres some proof...|`|Ra9byn6paa	in her 3D concert movie she was caught switching people, like she ran off while another person came on to cover for her, that means the song was lip singing the whole time|`|ltHslyCeaa	wouldn't you lip sync if you had to run around and dance on stage? She'd be completely out of breath if she tried to sing too! I like Miley, and I understand that she lips syncs... who cares? Pretty much all stars do.

One of the day players will die, not a main character.|`|AA12390047	Cole is driving.  Talia might be involved because she's leaving the show.<br>  A main character will not die.  <br>  Antonio will leave the show to supposedly go hunt down Carlo Hesser.

Some movies are based off either manga or an anime. :p|`|Bdgza4G2aa	Definitely try "Shout Out Loud!" manga (it is one of those 'in real life' ones).<br>  <br>  The difference between shounen-ai and yaoi is that shounen-ai is a lot less "intense" and explicit in content.<br>  The reason why a lot of people think they are the asme is entirely the fault of the publishing companies that are responsible for English translation.

AA10427489	you have to bear in mind that the american idol producers have not issued any clear statements to clarify how the wildcard show will work, so my answer is based on a site which bases its prediction on leaks by idol producers, and various articles written with regards to the wildcard night.i've sited the link right at the bottom.<br>  <br>  the judges will vote on the contestants they feel deserve a chance at the wildcard round, and will pick the 3 from the wild card group based on their performance on wild card night (some say they'll sing the same song they've sang during the top 36 performances, but considering that the judges had a problem with many contestants because of song choice, they'll  probably be made to perform different songs)<br>  so the judges will vote on the final 3, and in case of a 2-2 tie, simon will be the tie breaker.<br>  they'll probably keep us all waiting as long as possible-for the sake of creating a buzz about the show.people are speculating that the announcement will be made on thursday itself.|`|sa6gWgF8aa	I think it's suppose to be tonight after they announce the 3 that everyone voted for.

If your Mars in Aries is in the second house than you find aggressive ways about making money.

Saying they like a band when they only know whatever song or songs are in there.<br>  Or if they listen to ONLY bands from these games.<br>  <br>  I like the game, and it helps people find music, but when a 15 year old listens to ALL his music he has because of this game, then he should go die in a hole.|`|rRCTvT7Saa	Honestly, I don't think those games are helping or killing rock and roll.  Instead, I think those games are creating musical prejudice.  What do I mean by that?  Simple--the games, for the most part, only include rock songs.  Because of that, a lot of younger people will then think that other genres of music don't require any talent to be played.  The odd thing is that Rock Band actually has country songs available for download, when you'd think Guitar Hero would have country songs since Rock Band's name is Rock Band.  Really--since Rock Band is called that, it makes since that there's only rock in it.  As for Guitar Hero--that's where I'm disappointed.  I mean, GH has the opportunity to open up people to guitarists from all different genres--country, rock, blues, jazz, etc.  Of course, I highly doubt you'll ever hear a song Brent Mason, Mike Stern, Wes Montgomery or Brad Paisley ever played guitar on (on a GH game, that is)!|`|aBqJhdufaa	It does relatively nothing.

A large part of is rock 'n roll, so its kinda making it "cool" again|`|gKTTCsl6aa	I personally love both games and I think it helps rock and roll more then it "kills" it. <br>  When you hear a song that you've never heard on guitar hero or rock band, you want to research it and find out more about the band. (well at least that's what I do) <br>  Also, I don't think it ruins the spirit of instrumental playing... it makes it fun and interesting for people who don't know how to play a real instrument.|`|IvAJwpjgaa	i like it when my cousins actually know who Buckethead is...i dont care where they learned about him. many musicians deserve to be known.|`|cTYhnumDaa	It helps to some extent.<br>  <br>  I mean, most people know of Metallica, Slayer, Iron Maiden Slipknot, Pearl Jam (I hope) and such before they play it anyway but when I got guitar hero I actually discovered a band called Lacuna Coil who were hiding in the bonus tracks of legends of rock and then they're also in world tour with "Out truth" so yeah.. It helped me discover a band which I might not have discovered until later.<br>  <br>  BUT<br>  I don't like it when people play it, buy the t-shirt of one of the bands because they like the one song of that bands on guitar hero then go around giving lectures about how good and how amazing the band is when in actual fact, they know nothing. I also notice this most commonly happens with Slipknot<br>  <br>  I like how people can discover bands though, as in like a song, listen to more of that bands songs and really decide if they like them or not. If it wasn't for guitar hero my friend wouldn't like Disturbed etc<br>  <br>  BUT<br>  They need to get some other/better songs on it from bands like Radiohead, PANTERA, Danzig, Sanctity, Entombed, Whitesnake, Buckethead, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and less of  things like 30 seconds to mars, Paramore < main culprits because that isn't helping<br>  <br>  it's good if people dont just play guitar hero but maybe learn to play guitar, bass, drums or something too<br>  <br>  Bands like that seem to take over Kerrang too.|`|9IVYh3Cjaa	well, it got me interested in playing guitar, and there's no way I'm the only person that happened to. so it may give rise to new bands...but is that good or bad?|`|076b9d27ad5d5f819b3da4ba342506eaaa	I think it is DEFINITELY helping. All the new music exposes artists to people who may have not heard it. A lot of people may bellyache about how these people will only know 1-3 songs from the band, but I say that 1-3 is far better than 0.<br>  <br>  As for instrument playing, I don't know if it is widespread, but I started a real band because of guitar hero. If Rock Band/Guitar Hero never existed, I would have never picked up a real guitar, nor would have our bassist or lead guitarist. Our drummer would have never purchased a real kit. We loved those games so much that we wanted to learn the real thing.<br>  <br>  It may be subjective, but Rock Band/Guitar Hero has been a total positive in my music life.

AA12390047	David is plotting something and the writers just want us to guess so far.

I loved her and Tad together.|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	Perhaps it is Greenlee.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	There have been various rumors, some say Dixie,Babe and that he has Greenlee but I dont think it is Greens, she just "died" and Rebecca Budig has no plans to return at this time.|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	The low snake in the grass is always hiding something  lol...  he is talking about having a baby with Krystal,,,so I don't think he has Babe stashed anywhere,, he showed up after, not during the tragedy.<br>  The replacement actress for Greenless, maybe, or<br>   the writers are just making him sneaky so they can leave it open when they want to create some bizarre "David" crisis.<br>  And Krystal married him, after all the trouble he was causing in Babe & JR's marriage,,go figure.|`|6wsGQ1NCaa	I hope it's Greenlee or Babe.

JYzxGeNaaa	I don't know much about the discovery and history of Chiron. But I know know its myth and astrological influence.<br>  <br>  Chiron was the leader of the centaurs in ancient Greek mythlogy, and he was a wise teacher, and healer.  However, he was wounded by a poisonous arrow; and ironically could heal others, but not himself.<br>  <br>  Chiron's influence is that of the wounds we hold onto, and cannot heal without much struggle and pain, yet becomes our source of wisdom when we age.  It is where our deep hurts can be a source of power to heal others.  Chiron  points to where we have healing powers as the result of our own deep spiritual wounds.  We possess an innate wisdom within the sign that Chiron is in. Its placement is an indication of lessons you must learn in order to heal yourself, and the lessons you may one day be able to teach. <br>  <br>  And I think it does orbit outside of Saturn but I'm not sure.  But it would make sense for it to; seeing as Saturn is the Planet of Karma, Restriction, Obstacles, Limitations, and Life Lessons.  Chiron would hold a strong influence of Saturn's properties.

I don't know if you're ugly, or a creep, but one thing I do know is that you are insecure. You have been given a life by The Almighty, and no matter what you look like on the outside, I'm sure on the inside you truly are a wonderful person. Even if you are not, you can certainly make yourself one. People should like you for who you are. Your looks with fade with time, you will get wrinkles and lose your teeth, but it's your heart and personality that'll remain whole as long as you'll live.|`|ZQE61wUZaa	your cute but just a baby, how old are the people on here?

It also helps if the ticket taker is a teen - from my experience, most teen ticket takers really don't give a hoot about who's walking in.

He's a gentlemen in every shape and form. He's protective of the woman he loves and would do anything to keep her safe from harm. He's the best character.|`|VLUoblXDaa	It's a three way tie.

Ppl are dropping them off at farms. Dumb asses. All of them are getting sick so we are taking them out and fostering them till we find permanent homes for them.<br>  <br>  I understand the hardship ppl are going through right now but there are ways to give up an animal that are WAY better then drop offs. And it's NOT right to take your problem and make it someone else's. You just have to look around your area and out of it sometimes to get help.<br>  <br>  Sorry to go on but we just got 3 female breeders out of a barn that getting drop offs left and right. Hopefully they aren't prego and we'll get them fixed. If we don't catch all the breeding females there are going to be OVER 50 KITTENS in there this spring. We got 3 but there's about 10 more. And after we get all the breeding females we have to start getting the males done as well. And there are about 15 males. So if nothing is done in total there will be about 70 cats in this one barn this spring. That's crazy ppl. STOP DROPPING OFF CATS. What are these poor barn owner supposed to do?????? They didn't ask for ppl to drop their cats off like that!!!!<br>  <br>  Again sorry to go on but I really love animals and I hate seeing all these cats getting sick and suffering before they die because ppl don't want to be responsible.<br>  <br>  Have a good day.|`|aD1no2cWaa	I LOVE animals too.

jWBikTSjaa	I said that last night too!  I commented on Kristen's necklace too.  Carla used to have giant earrings also.<br>  <br>  But I also heard they are actually weighed at a different time, in water, because it's more accurate.  Then the number just shows up on the scale.  I don't remember where I read it, or if it's true.  However, if that is the case, the jewelry doesn't matter, and they are just trying to look good for TV.|`|kyDuf3D8aa	LOL....yeah, I noticed that too. They take their shoes off, so why not leave the jewelry in their rooms on weigh-in day? Good question...|`|QmWzBERjaa	Good question.|`|1y5ibNbZaa	My thoughts exactly.  It's odd.|`|Leda2ha0aa	They are weighed in previous to the taping of the on air weigh in.

g5RS83paaa	he made me really mad, he kept saying he had to folow his heart?! but supposedly he hadn't seen or talked to Molly so how did he know he was still in love with her, he's full of crap.

He is just a "TOOL".<br>  <br>  I personally lost a lot of respect for him!|`|qXJnNelsaa	I was livid when he let Melissa go!  First of all, how dare he!  He says how much he's been hurt in the past, then he finds the PERFECT girl, and he dumps her.  And like she said, he wouldn't even work on the relationship just cause he had a doubt?  And he didn't even give her the consideration to tell her in private, he waits to do it on national tv.  And then he wouldn't even talk to her about it and give her an honest thorough explanation!  I was so upset and mad.  I also did like Molly, but I liked Melissa more and felt that she was perfect for Jason.  But I see now that she is WAY too good for him.  I hope Molly dumps him so is hurt yet again!|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	Molly said when he escorted her to the limo "I think your makign a huge mistake.

He's not a jerk, just a coward, and it's sad that she got the bad end of it|`|VO58huGvaa	Yes i think the majority of America agrees with you!!! Jason is a slimball dweed!!!|`|7714e7eeb92e05e480cd7e80fa7a1fc1aa	Im a dude and even i was like Com'on homie....you fugged it up.  Not even Flava Flav stooped to this low on his show!<br>  <br>  I knew he was a player all along.  Guys know these things and could see through the fake "Americas Niceset bachelor" to now become "Americas Plaayer Plaayer!"<br>  <br>  He had way too many excuses<br>  <br>  1.  He told that one girl Jill he was not looking for a "best friend"<br>  2. He told Mel his reason for ending it all was the "chemistry Changed"  and that "Its not you"  Just tell her straight up what exactly it is.<br>  3. He told Mel he never talked to Molly at all which is some BS<br>  4.  He gets his mac on with Molly minutes after breaking off with Mel on the same couch!  Thats some plaaayer plaaayer shiznit.<br>  5.  The guy changes his mind more than he changes his socks<br>  <br>  <br>  For me it was no surprize....The dude is a front, wishy washy and it wouldn't suprize me if he changes his mind for Sophia in two weeks|`|uwds1QuVaa	Yes, very upset!  He went from being a seemingly great guy to the biggest Jerk ever!  Apparently it was all planned by the producers and it was in his contact that he had to break up with her on National TV.  He and Molly were sneaking around behind Melissa's back, and lying to her as well.  It's really too bad that Jason didn't have the guts and the class to tell Melissa privately and to treat her so badly is inexcusable!|`|lv1dT7BQaa	Jason will find out what he done when its too late .Molly is a career woman and could care less about being a step mom.I hope this falls right in his lap.Melissa is a better person and deserves someone who will appreciate and love her. Hes a BASTARD|`|ownoc1ZJaa	I do feel the same.  Jason is a jerk, plain and simple - and he is selfish.  I'm glad Melissa is free of him, though, now she can move on and find someone so much better.|`|ms09nXGtaa	I think Jason his the biggest Jerk. He could have broken up w/ her somewhere other than the final rose. AND THEN TO START MAKING OUT W/ MOLLY RIGHT AFTER HE BROKE UP W/ MEL! JERK|`|ard1AWlEaa	WOW! I was so sos so mad that he broke up with her on live and national tv!!!1 WOW!!! It made me not like him a lot!!!! I loved Melissa!!!!! Wow!!!! He IS a bastard!

VgW4yjEwaa	There was a memorial concert held for John in Liverpool in 1990. <br>  When he was murdered the tribute concert wasn't really done. <br>  There were candlelight vigils and singing around the world & I believe the Liverpool cathedral played 'all you need is love...' on its pipe organ...<br>  <br>  erm as far as one of them going I'd have to say Ringo, only because Macca still contributes good music to the world<br>  <br>  I was in liverpool when George died and got to go to the empire for Liverpools tribute concert and Paul came on stage on his own no band told a few stories and sang Yesterday. I still cry now...|`|A0r2qWaHaa	There may have been some concert out there that just wasn't put on video.  He did die a long time ago. The Concert for George was one year after his death and with his closest friends, Ravi, Eric, Paul, Ringo, Jeff , Billy Preston and his son of course! It was truely amazing and I love it! I love the Hare Krishna song with Ravi's daughter and the amazing slide in All Things Must Pass! A lot of people don't know about the concert and it suprises me.  My dad bought surround sound just so we could really enjoy it!<br>  I was only about 13 when George died, I always had hopes of seeing him in concert, too bad!|`|zg82CYzIaa	There should have been a concert for John.

I dont understand why girls care so much about thier myspace and facebook. I dont understand why girls are such gossipers, i dont understand why they feel the need to talk about another girl to someone else, and start drama when the other person  probably doesnt even know them. I dont understand why all girls care about is texting! i dont understand why a girl makes everyword a guy says into a story to tell thier friends so they can say "oh its ok, hes just an asshole!" I dont understand how girls can refer to (most good guys) guys in degrading ways...like "oh hes so hot i wanna F*** hiM!" <br>  I dont understand why girls care so much about other peoples feelings.

I ddont understand a girls' obsession with popularity and Being all over guys all day.

This is stupid.|`|Xn7l9YXNaa	Well from an artists point of view...(I am the screamer/vocalist in my band)<br>  <br>  Going from scream to vocal and back again over and over during the course of a song can be extremely difficult.

It is hard to do at first but you will be able to appreciate the song more.<br>  There are only certain methods of screaming and regardless of your own voice, they will all sound similar at one point.|`|K4lRi1fjaa	G'day,<br>  <br>  Thank you for your question.<br>  <br>  I suspect it is a good way of letting off steam for male adolescents.

Doesn't really qualify as a genre as it basically refers to the music made by the members of the original 80's hardcore scene AFTER they got sick of playing hardcore and became more competant at their instruments.|`|epsUr7d4aa	well you just need to listen to good stuff<br>  alot is really good and is actually melodic you probably listening to crap|`|PqtUe6mjaa	Actually, the dude at the top is wrong. Screamo is a genre. A sub genre really. The thing about human nature is that we're always categorizing things. Always. And contrary to popular believe, it's the masses who do it. So when the masses begin to categorize something  for the purpose of identifying it, that category stays. In the music we call these categories genres. <br>  <br>  Now, really when it comes down to it, screamo comes from Scream and Emo. It is especially enjoyed by disenfranchised youth. Emo means emotional..not depressed. In the case of screamo though it often creates a connection with those who are either angry, depressed or experiencing any emotion that requires one to let loose great amouts of energy as emotional release<br>  <br>  Different kinds of music attract people for different reasons<br>  <br>  Rap and Hip hop for example are often enjoyed by people looking for a beat<br>  <br>  Jazz is often enjoyed by people who enjoy musical complexity<br>  <br>  Punk  and  Emo is most often enjoyed by people who care about music first, sound second. The poetry is paramount. The screaming helps to connect those words to emotion.|`|7bd34f6c17525bda319b613f9fb74eeeaa	well it depends on the genre, and yea idk its weird cuz i listen to all kinds of music. Eminem, Jonas Brothers, The Black Dahlia Murder, Air Supply and so forth. a lot of people dont understand that its music, its just music. the "singing" is diffrent thats all there is to it. <br>  <br>  dont call it screamo thats lame. <br>  <br>  theres, <br>  <br>  post-hardcore<br>  hardcore<br>  deathcore<br>  death-metal<br>  metalcore <br>  <br>  and it goes on & on

WILDDDD"<br>  <br>  SteppenWolf were a very big influence to the pioneers of metal.|`|AA11464625	To answer your question accurately and from an educational stand point you must first understand the roots of rock and roll. We can all agree that Heavy Metal comes from rock and roll. Not Donnie and Marie Osmond type of rock but The Cream, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin type of rock and roll. By the way, Pink Floyd goes all the way back to the mid 60's. How many of you modern Metal fans knew that? Anyway, where many Heavy Metal fans start parting ways from the facts is when we must also figure out where rock and roll came from. Many Metal fans have a very hard time getting, that rocks roots come from Rhythm and Blues, Jazz and yes even Classical music. They want to think that Heavy Metal just popped out of thin air with no original source. Many Metal fans have problems thinking that their music, has roots with any form of Black music. I know this because I have answered a question like this on here before and got many thumbs down. Never the less, everything must come from something and that is a historical fact and when others denies yours and theirs favorite Heavy Metal music roots, it is showing no respect for it. It really is. For example, remember a heavy metal guitar player named Randy Rodes? He was the lead guitarist for Ozzie Osborn. How many heavy metal fans know his true love was classical guitar? Or that Jimmy Page, the lead guitarist from Led Zeppelin was a major R&B fan and the blues is what he loved playing the most?  Zeps first album should tune you into that.<br>  <br>  Now that I have said that I will answer your question. Heavy Metal is about stimulation and groups like: Kiss, Black Sabbath, Deo and other very early Heavy rock groups figured they had a small cult following and it went form there. Today Heavy Metal is a very tight knit group and that is cool but what is uncool is how the Metal fans have sadly lock themselves into a box and any music outside that little box they will not give the time of day. <br>  <br>  If you have branched past that very narrow Heavy Metal music box then good for you as you will not be sorry, because enjoying all types of music for what it is, will only open your mind to newer and greater things. A person can love Heavy Metal and Classical music.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit update: Hey, does that mean I do not get best answer? Signed, The Snobed Nose Elitist.|`|quIDrXktaa	I reckon Hendrix was a key turning point - suddenly the guitar sounded more like a weapon rather than an instrument, he twined the two evolving strands of technology and technique to show a new direction. I'm not sure if I'd go for Stone Free (1966) or Purple Haze (1967) to be a sign post and then...<br>  <br>  Race with the devil -  Gun 1968<br>  Corporal Clegg - Pink Floyd 1968<br>  The Nile song - Pink Floyd 1969<br>  21st century schizoid man - King Crimson 1969<br>  Communication breakdown - Led Zeppelin 1969<br>  Iron man -   Black Sabbath 1970<br>  Speed king -   Deep Purple 1970<br>  Immigrant song - Led Zeppelin 1970<br>  Paranoid - Black Sabbath 1970<br>  <br>  <br>  And how many Page/Hendrix-loving kids with guitars grew up to play in bands that were the heroes of the next generation?|`|qv5YTx5kaa	lol wtf are slasher bands? thats a term i haven't heard before.<br>  <br>  And rock first began to get heavy with a band called Blue Cheer in 1968 with their cover of Summertime Blues.<br>  <br>  Watch Metal: A Headbanger's Journey. It explains it all.<br>  <br>  Edit: Shellback, you should be ashamed you can't even spell Dio|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	Late 1960s/early 1970s, with Led Zeppelin gaining enormous popularity.<br>  <br>  Their 1976 10-minute guitar onslaught known as "Achilles Last Stand" off their album "Presence" is widely considered the first "metal" song.|`|iIWWeD7Taa	Think of heavy Metal as a baby.  It was conceived by The Yardbirds, The Who, and The Kinks. Cream carried it in the womb.  Hendrix gave birth to it.  Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, and Black Sabbath nursed it.  Van Halen dressed it up and sent it to Kindergarten.|`|IE1LvgD9aa	Most heavy metal was being developed at the same time.Originals like Jimi Hendrix,The Who,Led Zeppelin.Then the spin off slasher bands came in the 70s and 80s.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Hendrix, Sabbath, and Zeppelin helped set it all in motion ...|`|OrAk4Fpoaa	LED ZEPPELIN|`|K4lRi1fjaa	G'day Do it harder,<br>  <br>  Thank you for your question.<br>  <br>  Heavy rock started in the 60s with bands such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. In the earlier 70's, Black Sabbath and Judas Priest started exploring heavier themes.<br>  <br>  This trend was continued in the early 80s with the formation of bands such as Metallica and Iron Maiden. Subgenres such as death and black metal started going. As well, hardcore punk has had some influence with metalcore.<br>  <br>  Regards|`|rjfFD2Voaa	Well in my opinion, I don't think rock started getting 'heavy' I think its actually getting less heavy. To me, most rock bands are just turning up the sound and making their music more available to all listeners, everyone merging into pop music. Not to actually wish bad luck on heavy metal, but I think it might be dying soon, like goth music had, when it was replaced my emo music, and even that isn't working out too well anymore.|`|uUDNcsyUaa	Well the definition of HEAVY in music can vary from person to person...plus I completely agree with one of the answers I saw above in that just because you turn up your volume and de-tune your guitars DOES NOT mean its heavy.  It's more about the actual sound and dissonance coupled with the attitude and edginess that is heavy.  I mean...there are certain types of jazz and blues that could be considered "heavy".<br>  <br>  But if you are looking for the pioneers of metal it is pretty much agreed upon by most fans and bands themselves that the title belongs to Black Sabbath.|`|HysVH9qLaa	Led Zeppelin is considerd th first metal band, actually. but i think in/around 1995 someone wanted to get away from the grunge scene,and so, after a little experimenting, came up with the sound that bands such as Slayer, Slipknot, and other heavy /death/metal is today|`|VBkNIFMMaa	the second the guitar was mastered|`|lrJopeC5aa	I believe heavy metal came around the 80's|`|7Oa6Cxz1aa	most people will say Black Sabbth.|`|Wf8T2bexaa	in the 1970s with AC DC started in 73 then Jimi Hendrix and Deep Purple.|`|kwwb62qBaa	Black Sabbath<br>  KISS

A guy spreading his legs and looking like he's in pain does not scream "hot" to me. But, well. It's Joe we're talking about.<br>  <br>  I think he looks good in glasses, his hair non straightened, and wearing normal clothing.

Ehhh .... I despised them at first, but now they've grown on me. Do I like their music? Ehh ... a little. Okay, I like it more than a little :P Do I think they're hot? No. But Nick is pretty cute looking. <br>  The only guys in the celebrity world that I'll probably ever define "hot" would probably be Tom Felton, Elijah Wood, Johnny Depp (exhibit a.) Sweeney Todd. He is a smexy villain!) and a couple more that I can't name off of the top of my head. ^_^<br>  <br>  Have you seen the 3-D concert experience? We went the day it came out (mostly for my younger sister, or else she'd probably cry if we didn't take her) and I thought it was pretty good ^_^|`|i0pBS82Kaa	I think somebody has a litttle obsession over Joe Jonas<br>  *Wink wink<br>  <br>  :)|`|aBtUtnKtaa	Hottie alert ;-)|`|4a4fc6fd359a16c13169b1185d22b8b7aa	Haha yeah it's quite... interesting.<br>  <br>  I don't suggest you post questions like this on Y!A, unless you're willing to face the haters..|`|rtYLCv6Iaa	He's hot as in he's sweating!<br>  For me, not one of his best pics.|`|tDuUQcKpaa	OMG!!

We just broke down and told each other anything we had lied about or withheld and then it just felt natural. We were in my car in the front seat. It hurt but it was nice and it brought us together and our relationship has been wonderful since then.|`|avlVHXDCaa	r u talking about sex or kiss<br>  <br>  <br>  never had sexx<br>  <br>  kiss at the mall and i felt awsome|`|NfwJPdLjaa	Virgin;)|`|mggll8dRaa	I missed most of the Movie (Drive-In)....!!|`|K0iFV73Gaa	okay...

I felt anxious, excited, nervous and to be honest scared.  The adrenaline rush was amazing. I could feel my heart beating out of my chest.  But then I did it and it lasted about 45 seconds and I wasn't a cherry anymore I was a Paratrooper.  I had jumped from a high performance aircraft for the first time.|`|x5ftqjo5aa	it was hella fun!|`|lfJ5Jxxwaa	My first donut was good...had a strawberry filling|`|6zCm65haaa	uno its not like a bad pain it's more of oh no i'm scared sort of pain cos no matter how many times ppl say relax u cant so thats jus a stupid thing to say all i wud say is make sure its what u want dont do it cos he's wants to whenever any1 asks me wot my 1st time was like i allways say like avin ya ears pieced once it's in u wonder what all the fuss was about lol|`|UKENIXvuaa	You should ask your question more clearly.

It hurt like HELL! He started gettin mad at me because I kept moving (I couldn't help it, it really HURT. Plus he didn't do anything to loosen me up, just 1,2,3 SLAM.) and then he cursed at me and said "stop f***ing moving!". I tried to grab his arm because I just needed to hold on to something but he swat it away. I was frustrated and wanted it over with so I just shut up and laid there, doing everything possible not to move. When he got it in finally I started crying, quietly, so he wouldn't notice. Then when it was over he told me I ruined it for him because I was moving so much. *sigh* I regret that day so much now. =(|`|61vktzhkaa	It was lame.

There are of course "pay offs" of some type involved in some situations and then they are totaled up each week for the Billboard 100.  You have to remember that the DJ and the program manager have total control of what is played on a radio program.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|zLBDmcsnaa	I love college? Yeah there's an edited version played. Oh and he's not that bad by the way look into his good music not that song i hate when people judge an artist by one song.|`|ioNTTqKfaa	The reason certain songs are played so much is a combination of payola and the telecommunications act of 96. And it explains a lot. You see, since the telecommunications act was passed, it allowed companies to buy up radio stations so that now most radio stations are owned by clear channel. Payola is the practice of paying people or giving them benefits in return for playing certain songs. The combination of payola and all the radio stations being owned by the same company means that you only have to pay one or a few people (the heads at clear channel) to get your music played. This is why you hear the same crappy songs everywhere you go.|`|LqQvCvLAaa	hardly listen to the radio<br>  <br>  power 106 LA<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.power106.com/playlist/index.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.power106.com/playlist/index.a...</a>

If I know them well, than I will be talking really fast, but If i don't know them well than I will be talking slow with short boring answers.  It is just what I do... But most of the time I talk in between the two, because it is really important to talk slow enough that people can understand you, but not too slow because you don't want people to think you are retarded. lol. :)|`|FONfnGLaaa	fast when I'm really excited about something or have a strong opinion about something.

I've never played but from what I herd is, you make a team, using Naruto characters and battles agaist other uses and their teams.

995e987f826f3705764c11398ede5b26aa	bass tunes in fourths.....<br>  those are low tunings so his best bet would be (if he's playing a 4 string bass) B,E,A,D....adding the low B string<br>  <br>  we tune in drop B and C in my band....I usually play a 5 string bass tuned standard to B,E,A,D,G....never really have to tune down or up..<br>  <br>  i would skip drop D tuning and go straight to a low B string on the bottom....in those tunings it'll make the playability easier.....if you add the low B ,however,double check your intonation.|`|qkg3bAbgaa	If you're going below drop D, I'd personally recommend investing in a 5 string bass, which will have a low B string. This will give you the tuning BEADG.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, DADG (Drop D) in my opinion.|`|YQ13Mdq4aa	Just tune it to whatever your guitar is tuned to.<br>  if your just doing drop d, then tune to d<br>  if your going a step lower than d, go c<br>  just tune with your guitar!

Personally, I think that the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato are positive role models. The Jonas Brothers actually care about the environment and stuff. And Demi Lovato music is really inspirational. <br>  <br>  You fail for listing Miley Cyrus.|`|ltHslyCeaa	Miley bc she shows her worst sides and her best and doesn't try to hide it..l.<br>  JB: try to hard to be perfect<br>  Selena: Can't act or sing and is generally just plain mean<br>  Demi: She's okay, but you never really see her being herself<br>  Zac: No no no no, so many reasons why not|`|utNz9hv3aa	None of them, they all suck<br>  <br>  Personally a teenage hero for me is James Hetfield, he speaks his mind, loves his wife and is friendly to the people that support him and his band (Metallica)|`|H7evKKdIaa	jonas brothers...?|`|4LSrx8L0aa	none!!<br>  esspecially JB|`|KZfYzhZRaa	selena Gomez she is such a good influence|`|UkFSyozpaa	they all suck<br>  <br>  ASHER ROTH!!!|`|DWLqqijVaa	Those are SO not teen idols.

I noticed that the Crystal Light commercials specifically say who the artist is. Like a music video. The only one I have seen has a song by Estelle.
PrijywMIaa	Most annoying person on TV I hate her.......................|`|nbW9Zqi0aa	She's way too conservative for my liking, but the show needs someone like that to keep it interesting.|`|AA12390047	She's entitled to her "view" just like the rest of them.  They'll never agree.|`|aKvxy3xBaa	I think lately she is getting a little more open minded. She actually has agrees with what Obama has said or done on some issues. There are miracles aren't there.|`|oKExTm8paa	She is okay except that today she was on a roll and rattled on and on about the Repub. Party. She has become more open minded lately.<br>  <br>  I like the show best when Barbara Walters is not there.

I only watch when they have a guest I'm interested in seeing.|`|pq3Dt5bdaa	She's probably the only one that will be in Heaven on that show.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	She is annoying and thinks she is always right.

LcSwDbr4aa	Most start out being affected by some sort of disaster or human tragedy that touches them and makes them want to change the ways of society.  (Batman lost his parents in a driveby shooting, Ironman almost dies by his own weapons in the hands of terrorists)  Megneto surviving the Holocaust, etc.  Other times, superheroes are moved by the kindness shown to them by others, like Superman being raised by his 'human' parents, or Spiderman being raised by his Aunt and Uncle.<br>  The superheroes in turn shape society's values by raising the general publics awareness of the 'morality' to do good instead of self serving interests.  Also, once a superhero gets their superpowers, they probably feel they got their powers for a reason, and are trying to use it to fit in the world better, and what a better way to do that than show others that you aren't bad or shouldn't be feared (or in the case of villans, take over the world, so that you will be feared and respected for being 'better' than other mortals)

lxYWZc9caa	This isn't something you should be asking on yahoo answers, because most people could give you wrong information (just like all the rest of the answerers have done), which can lead to damaged vocal cords, polyps, and nodes. There are plenty of youtube videos and webpages dedicated to teaching people to scream correctly, as to not screw up your vocal cords. Now, I don't want to misinform you about anything, but I can tell you that there are three main types of screaming.<br>  <br>  1. Death/false (when a screamer uses the false vocal cords to make screaming sounds. This type of screaming is often classified as the most brutal type and is used in most hardcore music. Some bands that use death/false are August Burns Red and Alesana)<br>  <br>  2. Fry (Fry vocals are when a screamer uses the glottal fry to make screaming sounds or whining vocals. Fry vocals are not loud, and many claim it cannot damage someone's vocal chords as other techniques. Some bands that use fry are Silverstein, Underoath, and Bullet for My Valentine.)<br>  <br>  3. Inward/Inhale (which many look down upon, as its mainly for girly-men. Inward screaming is made by forcing your diaphragm to pull air into the body while the throat is partially closed. Learning inward vocals is much easier than learning outward vocals and is usually not as loud.)<br>  <br>  So yeah. Just google how to scream and you get really good first results.|`|eQVvnq7Haa	lol. its not like a how to, you just scream!|`|vhy0k2dtaa	drink half a bottle of jose cuervo and have fun|`|iWiMcAIqaa	Alesana's lead singer will probably have his chords scrubbed several times in his life and in all likely hood will sound like an old raspy man by the time he hits 30.  Its definitely not healthy and if your under 20 I would definitely not recommend doing this, but I'm not your mama and everyone is entitled to their own artistic choices.  <br>  The raspy sounds is actually his chords grinding together from the extreame amount of pressure and the unusual placement of the pitch. (All very hard on your voice and WILL lead to vocal damaging if abused)<br>  <br>  1.)  Jam the place where the pitch is created into your throat.  (In normal easy singing its created high on the roof of your mouth)<br>  <br>  2.)  The pressure (in your thought) must be extremely high.  The simplest way to achieve this is to intentionally over-sing aka shout.<br>  <br>  If you want to listen to great singers who have mastered the style in a much more healthy way listen to ACDC or Guns n Roses (its basically what your going for minus all the pressure).  Their messing themselves up too but not nearly as bad as the hardcore bands

Hmmm...it sure is possible.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	Well her video for "White Horse" is still pretty new.<br>  <br>  But I think Fearless or Fifteen should be the next video.|`|dbNZhnAkaa	Wait, is this a "what do you think question?"

QpssXle0aa	The whole movie can be seen in different ways, but even simple things had reason. First there was a disruption in the time stream when the plane jet crashed into Donnie's room. He begins seeing a 'six-foot tall bunny rabbit', Frank. Frank saves him only to guide him. Donnie is told to break the water main in the school, thus flooding the school. The reason for that is so the Donnie's teacher will get fired and to leave the immortal words 'Cellar Door' which guide Donnie later.<br>  He has to set fire to the the perverts house so that he'd have to face trial, therefore leaving it so Donnie's mother would have to take Sparkle Motion to their gig and get on the plane (letting the engine fall out) and allowing Donnie to have the party. <br>  Quantum physics isn't a main focus. It's about time-travel, but not really. It's the Sacrifice (Donnie) who must die to keep the world in it's normal balance. The Manipulated Living do not know what's going on (everyone) but the Manipulated Dead (Frank and Donnie's girlfriend) help him come to the conclusion that he must die. Frank with slow clues and his girlfriend with grief.<br>  <br>  The point in which the engine hit split the world into this one and an alternate. The alternate was safe and the current would collapse upon himself. At the end he got the chance to go back and prevent the split. <br>  <br>  It was a story of sacrifice to me- but of course- you could always take the obvious 'He's paranoid and this is imagination'. I don't think that's what the film suggested because at the end the pervert was crying (and he didn't know why), and Frank woke up cupping his hand over his eye.<br>  <br>  If you want more I can edit this with names and more references, but that's what I can give in a nutshell. It's a fantastic movie and there are tons of interpretations.|`|fada715e923adf0dac1a80022ec10dd7aa	It is an incredible movie and also a very, very, very confusing one. It took some time and research for me to figure this out perfectly. <br>  The bulk of the film is Donnie going through a tangent universe created for him by a higher power where he is allowed to become aware of events that would occur were he to continue living in the primary universe. Basically, his girlfriend, his mother and his sister would die.<br>  He is given the chance to allow his death to occur by those who die in the tangent universe, namely Frank and Gretchen, both of whom are the instruments of a higher power. Both of these characters are able to manipulate Donnie to help him reach the decision he must make.<br>  Donnie is basically presented with a choice: go on living and the universe will be like this. Die and life will be better for everyone else. This is why Donnie repeats the line, "I promise one day everything will be better for you", to a number of people towards the end of the movie. When events have run their course in the tangent universe, he elects to resume life in the primary universe from his bed, instead of on the golf course where he is towards the beginning of the movie (the inception of the tangent universe). He is then crushed by the jet engine and life goes on... without him. The only two elements that are changed in the primary universe as a result of Donnie's decision are his location at the time of the jet engine's fall through the wormhole and said fall, the former of which comes about through Donnie's choice and the latter of which occurred through the influence of a higher power. <br>  The only problem I can perceive in my overall interpretation of this movie is that, were Donnie to go on living in the primary universe without the interference of Frank and Gretchen, most of the horrible events that the tangent universe presents would not have transpired. Perhaps it was simply not Donnie's place to know what the future held for him in the primary universe and he was simply shown a tangent universe that would have assured his willing cooperation in his own death.<br>  (I may just be stupid, but I can't be the only one.)|`|JxUFDutxaa	Here's a site that may answer some of your questions.<br>  What a great mixed up wacko movie...<br>  <br>  Everything you were afraid to ask about "Donnie Darko"<br>  <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/feature/2004/07/23/darko/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/fe...</a>

hmsCFQocaa	Foreigner is more believable, and satisfies their fans with more albums.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong. Boston's sound is one of a kind. But every Boston song is an anthem. Foreigner mixes anthems, ballads, songs of human conflict and a few curveballs as well like the bad-boy racing epic Rev On The Red Line and the unbelievably spiritualIy deep I Want To Know What Love Is. Also, Kelly Hansen can ably handle Foreigner's lead vocals today, while Boston cannot possibly replace the late Brad Delp.<br>  <br>  Count me in with Foreigner.|`|OTFzJbaMaa	well i personally dont listen to either of these bands much so please dont weigh your decision soley on my opinion which im sure you normally do ;)<br>  <br>  i think they are both talented bands but my favorite song from either of these 2 bands is more then a feeling. so i have to go with boston simply because that is an amazing song<br>  but like i said im no expert on these.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	2 very similar bands...<br>  <br>  I take Boston.  Brad Delp sings with so much more passion than Lou Gramm, and I really like Scholz's tone and style.  Boston had way less albums than Foreigner, but the songs they did release were much better quality in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Still love Foreigner though.|`|YwtXSUAdaa	I like Boston a lot better. Like you said, Boston is pretty epic, and Delp is amazing. I don't like Foreigner that much though.|`|1DWx1H8Paa	I say Boston (one of my favs) <br>  I've saw them both live. Even after Brad(R.I.P) started losing his voice and they had Fran on tour with them, he still belted what he could. They had a great stage show, and Tom Scholz played some fantastic guitar.<br>  <br>  I dig Foreigner too, but I think Boston like you said, was Epic|`|7914f974f3cd0a96cc6883956102da35aa	Foreigner.<br>  <br>  Boston sounds the same. And Foreplay/Long Time is a really long song. I don't have the attention span for it.<br>  I do like Baby Come Back though (:|`|yS61H04haa	Boston. I am not a big fan of foriegner, but Boston brings back some really fond memories. I love to roll down my windows , crank it up and drive real fast to Foreplay/Longtime. Yeah, good time.|`|dFacbjIZaa	Slightly more talented? Boston. Personal fave? Foreigner.<br>  <br>  I burnt My ears out on Boston years ago. But I have a lot of good memories associated with Foreigner songs, they were huge when I was young.|`|3005d3b9180d1ef915398a770d0e19f2aa	I prefer Boston - saw them in concert in 1993 or 94 and they were fantastic.  I love Brad Delp's voice.  Just never really dug Foreigner.|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Boston<br>  <br>  It still sounds modern to me.<br>  Foreigner is old hat, and NONE of their songs touch me like<br>  Amanda<br>  Peace of Mind<br>  Smokin|`|kwwb62qBaa	Straps on her Foreigner belt.....<br>  <br>  Definitely foreigner :D|`|Vu4A83dyaa	Foreigner. Just listen to the 4 album.|`|YKhulh5Haa	BOSTON is 100x better|`|i5YJBqnZaa	Foreigner's music is a bit more varied than Boston's. I like them both. But Foreigner would be my choice.|`|adLSRFrZaa	Tom Scholz is such a great guitar player.  I'll have to pick Boston.|`|eEoeURDHaa	Hey Nightlife, I'm back from my suspension :(<br>  <br>  Anyway, I like both bands, but I've always leaned towards Boston more, I like every album.<br>  <br>  Although I think Kelly Hansen has done well with Foreigner lately.<br>  <br>  Edit: Ugh, yeah, that makes the 2nd Lv. 4 account that's been destroyed by YA.<br>  <br>  Yeah, I know, same here, I had like 4 violations on questions I'd asked ages ago, and then the next day (YA Suspension Notice), I decided not to even try to appeal it.<br>  <br>  Edit 2: LOL, Baby Come Back is by Player, one of the members is on a soap opera now.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Absolutely and positively Foreigner.<br>  <br>  Boston was very overplayed where I lived and Foreigner just kept on tossing out hit after hit.  I also saw them in concert, after Lou Gramm had had surgery for a brain tumor.  He is still awesome.|`|N62uLMf3aa	those are 2 of my favorite bands and of course i can't choose i like them both equally. I'm not much help but whatyagunnado?

A couple weeks ago this girl asked what was admittedly a rant, rather than a question. But she included several questions, concluded that the group of people she was addressing couldn't answer them, and ended her rant with "See? You don't know everything."<br>  <br>  But, I DID know the answers to all her questions. I answered them in detail, with a few witty asides, and ended it with "See? I do know everything." It was great, one of the best (and funniest) answers I ever wrote. But the questions was deleted!!! ::sniffle::<br>  <br>  So frustrating...|`|LZqUE9w7aa	i hate it more when i type out a huge long question or answer. then submit it and it says YA is having some problems!!!|`|afad69e26e3d742b9b035d7dbbbbf716aa	Heck that that's reeeeaaally annoying.

Another issue I have, is that I will find on occasions I will write a witty answer and fail to check my grammar and submit, then to my embarrassment I see the mistake but I can not get it back quick enough to make the change.  I guess if I would slow down and re-read my responses that would not happen.  Oh well, life is like a box of chocolates.
M1ymLE9Paa	I want them to be friends again, but I agree.  I'd rather Jason just run his own organization and Sonny run a seperate one, and they can be allies or something.  But yeah, I don't want Jason to work for Sonny again.  Sonny's been acting like such a jerk.  And I hate how he treats Spinelli.  It makes me so mad.  Plus, there's no way Sonny is going to trust Jason completely, after everything that happened.  So I don't see how they would work well together.  Maybe this is Jason's chance to get out of the mob.  He can team up w/Sam and run an PI company together-him, Sam, and Spinelli.  That would be fun to watch.|`|ADBMrG87aa	I really don't want Jason to go back to being Sonny's enforcer but I suppose Jason knows whats best for him and that he doesn't really want the business in the first place and only took it because Sonny begged him to and now that Sonny wants it back and is starting to stabilize emotionally, maybe its time to turn it back over to Sonny.  I seriously doubt that Jason will go back to being the yes man that he was before.  Jason will have more say than before in Sonny's decision making.  I think between Jason and Claudia, Sonny will eventually break down and start treating Spinelli with more respect; hopefully!<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|msUIsv8maa	Jason told Sonny he wanted them to work together again with Sonny being Mob Boss. Jason evidentally doesnt wanna be Boss any more it was his Choice.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I totally agree!|`|P9k8qHP6aa	Yeah its kinda disappointing that Sonny is taking back over but maybe now that Sonny is with Claudia he will finally start treating Spinelli right since Claudia gets Spinelli and was even trying to defend him to Sonny, which is something that you rarely if ever see Jason do. But then again I would rather see Sonny back in charge then Jason or Sonny going at it.|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	Thank you Betrdz!! I thought I was the only one feeling this way. When Jason gave back the business I was like "WHY, Jason, WHY???"   And immediately Jason turned into Sonny's lap dog. It was hard to watch.  Sonny is too impulsive and doesn't give a darn about Spin. And Bernie let Sonny know that Jason's men don't trust him. This whole thing will backfire and Jason is going to end up regreting what he did.  I wish Claudia would use her intelligence and out smart Sonny and Jason and run the buisness herslef. How about that for a twist!|`|fIWwLRIMaa	jason obveously isn't a leader, he is a follower and feels more comfortable taking orders rather than dishing them out. yeah it's going to take some time getting used to seeing jason answer to sonny again since sonny's been a dick, but i just hope their friendship is restored with more respect for each other.|`|0mCrQm0oaa	General Hospital is awsome but this adds drama and drama makes the show, i is something no one expects and who knowws how it will end u never know|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Me either! Part of me wants Jason to just get out and leave!  Knowing Sonny he will treat him like a piece of dirt.|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	In the mob business, it is just that...strictly business. Life or death.  I want to see Sonny be the man again and Jason get a bump on the head from what ever, wake up a doctor....marry Sam and live happily ever after.

AA11530601	dude I dont want ppl to hold doors open for me. But its mean how u say u would let it it someone in the face. Man or woman we all feel pain, its not a gender issue, its a pain issue. Try looking at how women are treated accross the world and you will see that although u thnk we are "spoiled " in the UK and USA, feminism does have a definite point. I mean, a woman was gang raped in saudi arabia recently, she got preganant and tried to get an abortion. She is not married. She was not only denied the abortion but sent to jail for having sex outside marriage and bizzarley, adultery, even tho she isnt married. She will get 40 lashings after the kid is born, all because of how women are treated like animals in other countries. Its on the daily mail or daily express website but its about a month old by now so check the archives if u dont belive me. Also, yeah its HARD being a man and I have no idea what its like, but you also have no idea that maybe, just maybe, women have it hard too. But we have a different set of issues to you guys, totally different. If you feel that feminism is al crap, because it gives women special treatment, then work on throwing off your own gender stereotypes, dont have a go at those who already have. Rigid gender roles hurt all of us, Its a shame that feminism is linked exclusively to women, I would prefer there to just be a gender studies section rather than exclusively womens studies. Thanks for saying we are equal I respect you for that but look back in history, even 100 yrs ago women werent allowed to go to university because they were "too mentally inferior" to benefit from it, and we were also seen as "too silly" to be able to have influence and vote until 1922. In sweden or somewhere in the netherlands, women still cant vote until they are 30, because they are not seen as mentally strong enough to understand and thus would wreak havok on politics and make silly decisions.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	For what??|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	I'm just as considerate to guys as they are to me.!<br>  As gasolina said, I also believe everyone should be treated equally. ;p|`|BswVoF8Paa	Wow, you must be single arent you......about the closing the door thing<br>  <br>  <br>  But i really do think we are all equal, just sometimes we have to be nice|`|CArzkDIUaa	Well, I wouldn't say a door in the face would be treating them equal... because it's rude either way, but yeah, they are equal|`|VlCax7DWaa	yes<br>  because they deserve it.<br>  do you know how hard it is to be a woman?|`|cNdkNYKOaa	it is funny <br>  they have said for years that they want to be treated as equals<br>  but they also want special favors<br>  they want us to pay for everything<br>  they want us to be chivalrous (open door, pull out chair, etc)<br>  i say make up your minds<br>  equal or helpless not both|`|jpH4IjWnaa	Men and Women are equal, the sexes are equal, so therefore, one gender should not have more privileges than the other.

e4hkuXJlaa	Yes, I absolutely do. Not because I'm religious (I'm Atheist/Agnostic) or because I've met the love of my life, but because I think that everything you do is leading you somewhere, and if there is a perfect person out there, that you will, eventually find them. That doesn't mean that every person you fall in love with is "the one", because people can make mistakes, but I think that there has to be a person out there for a large percentage of us. besides, if there was a person out there who was so right for you that it was scary, what would be the point if you never met them.|`|rsHbMpjXaa	Yes, I do believe some relationships were truly "meant to be"!|`|7Ce2oC9Yaa	yes, it happened with my parents|`|sObEb6NNaa	Yes I do, very much so|`|wmBK9uASaa	No not in the slightest....|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	I believe that every person who comes into our lives, has come to us for a reason...but not necessarily forever.|`|in0fQxN1aa	NOPE.

Zgdxavnmaa	Those clothes are sorta emoish but the jacket isn't really. You should just ignore it. Even if you are turning emo its not a bad thing at all, and you will just have to put up with the preps because they are always gonna act like that to people who aren't preps whether your emo or not. Ignore it and they will get bored.|`|7rmQVnQ6aa	If you don't like preppies,why would you care what they think?<br>  <br>  So what if that is how emos dress,if that is how YOU dress,than that is YOU.You are not "emo",you are YOU.<br>  <br>  By the way,don't let the stuck-ups bother you.They just want everyone to look like they do.I would just laugh at them if they call you that again.Or make some kind of smart remark back.But that would show that you CARE as to what they think.So I would just go for laughing at their remark.|`|mpwH3dSiaa	That's really not how emos dress... you're just following a different sort of fashion i guess more of the rock inspired laid back look which most people prefer anyway... and most people aren't emo's. It's way more fashionable in england anyway... preppy clothes I think are more of an american thing. I would ignore what they say, some preppy people seem to think that what they wear defines who they are... it just goes to prove that theyre just extremely shallow. So relax and be the bigger person and ignore it.|`|2M4pqLUdaa	relax girlly. it should be obvious that the one who said that is jealous of you for something. it may not even have to with anything that was going on at that particular moment. move on and remember... no matter what, by not reacting you are better than she is.|`|eTOrwG1Maa	Maybe a little more time spent in English class would be the thing to worry more about.|`|WU7xMQCyaa	They are pathetic calling someone they don't know a name|`|VIJmBr5Raa	Dont Lisen to them, if you wanna look like that then look like that no-ones stopping you i bett there just jelous! be hu u wanna B!!!|`|oLxKV2OCaa	She was just trying to rile you up.|`|wpPqvWDraa	relax|`|AdLLUbpzaa	preps think that anyone that dont dress like them are emos.<br>  <br>  dnt think about it too much...its just pathetic|`|fcQrjl6Gaa	you should have slapped the b**** across the face.|`|NKuQh4sSaa	Don't let them get to you , just be yourself and don't let them bother you by them calling you names .

GjLmdDU4aa	"The Turning Point" about old rivals from a ballet company and the jealousies involved between an aging prima ballerina and the rival who decided to get married and have a family.

Ok, Hair dye, some streaks, mousse, serum to make it sleek, a touch of glaze, and a whisper of hairspray...all put together with a sparkly clip, and a hidden elastic, and a few pins.<br>  <br>  My hair is long, and I don't use too much conditioner.

We've grown very close. In fact we're so close that she today told me all her "secrets".. including.. you guessed it !... she is a "square" ! Well, there goes all my chances of going out with her, LOL. <br>  <br>  I  felt such a sense of loss that I might as well have castrated myself right then and there .<br>  <br>  >sigh< ... I am only speaking in such sarcasm because it really cuts me deep in the chest.  I really had liked the girl.  hm..|`|mL6ycTAhaa	I wish I can be happy but<br>  I am depressed every single day<br>  and i wonder how the heck am I still alive?<br>  Sometimes I just don't want to live anymore cuz life is just too much for me to handle.|`|XCn2dK1laa	Yes :'(<br>  Best friend dying,failing classes,dysfunctional family...it's all getting to me now
SFu7nHhtaa	It is not the right thing to do. That is for sure. People need to be married before they encounter in sexual intercourse. Otherwise, it just causes issues mentally and physically.|`|SkFgDxpEaa	yup. they should not call themselves actors at all|`|k8MIQSOvaa	A job is a job. Even if it involves being a whore or not. These porn stars rack in big money.|`|epXVyzLkaa	Yeah. They make money out of bein hoes. But it's up to them what they wanna do. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with being a ho though, I mean, whatever floats ur boat ;)<br>  As long as no-one hurts anyone, it's ok by me. =]|`|DK6kYxmGaa	Definitely whoreish|`|RNpaBwxzaa	They have no self-respect.|`|GtGq5B7maa	Everyone knows that pornographers are sleazy and so I don't think there's anyone na?ve enough to believe that those pornographers only do what they do to get rich. So, wouldn't that make their models  "whores" (or "man whores" if we're also talking about gay porn).

ME4XWNmRaa	Heaven And Hell by Black Sabbath, it is incredibly eerie.|`|0vm66wlcaa	I was gonna ask this!<br>  You beat me, I guess.<br>  <br>  That is a sick outro. Pantera rocks.<br>  <br>  This one is pretty easy, for me. It is like a three second outro, but AWESOME. It also has an awesome intro, too.<br>  "Play With Me" - Extreme<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSG2sMnvyOQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSG2sMnvy...</a>|`|5HvdcWvBaa	Comaaaaaaaa - GNR<br>  <br>  Seriously, I love Floods n' all but Coma's outro is SOMETHING F*CKING ELSE!!!! XD<br>  <br>  Its soooo awesome and beautiful and I could listen to it forever, pretty much!! First time I heard it, I was like noo waaaay!!!!<br>  <br>  Oh sh*t!! I just got hit by some crappy monster thing 'cause I was concentrating too much on trying to explain my love for Coma (Yes, I'm playing a game, I don't just live in an extremley odd place populated by badass creatures!!)|`|OTFzJbaMaa	well i love the end of line in the sand by motorhead. its amazing. i love the sounds the gutair exspecially. and it reminds me of 4 of my favorite people =)|`|7fEVNng5aa	Floods is one of my all-time favorite outros, on one of my all-time favorite songs, on one of my all-time favorite albums. Good call.|`|rFBypeEfaa	Totally different genre, but Neil Young's "Cinnamon Girl" outro is pretty awesome...|`|wTkvkWscaa	I don't listen to metal, so this will probably pale in comparison to almost everything else posted, but I've always really liked the end of No. 13 Baby by Pixies for some reason. I'll get a link. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDt42Vs-teI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDt42Vs-t...</a><br>  <br>  And I can't watch that link right now, my friend is asleep on my couch right next to me. :(|`|tSvixAGoaa	Floods is really freakin awesome. Everybody knows this. I really like the outro to hard lines, sunken cheeks.  that sweet whammy bar dip riff while Dime is going on in the background doing cool stuff.|`|h1yGVkkfaa	Nice choice Bro...<br>  <br>  Although i have a lot from pantera i wont name them..<br>  <br>  Phanton lord-Metallica<br>  <br>  Gypsy-Dio<br>  <br>  Fire and the fury-Firwind<br>  <br>  Painkiller-Judas priest<br>  <br>  (Just a few)|`|wxpQzOGkaa	Tom Sawyer by Rush<br>  The drums in the outro are sick :D<br>  <br>  <br>  As for the outro to Floods, the guitar is hypnotizing haha seriously, it's tight|`|uUDNcsyUaa	oh good call on Floods...super great outro!<br>  <br>  The first thing that came to mind for me was November Rain - GNR...that solo is just epic|`|Vu4A83dyaa	That is a good one!<br>  <br>  I say Bohemian Rhapsody. But it can't beat Floods' outro.<br>  <br>  EDIT:No! I change my answer to Novermber Rain-Guns N Roses|`|GYdbXHpTaa	I love the piano outro in Faith No More's Epic.|`|KX8oWwDzaa	Layla|`|1DPeKBaBaa	Dude, right when I saw your question I said "gotta go with Floods by Pantera" haha! Seventh Son of a Seventh Son by Iron Maiden has an amazing outro as well.
QDtuowVYaa	Theramin??
Oxi99SvFaa	As I Lay Dying. I love thier song Sound of truth. It's amazing. And my favorite band right now is Korn. But Whitechapel is good to.|`|lVxhiMopaa	I pick As I Lay Dying.<br>  I love their song Sixx & Chiron.<br>  <br>  But BVMV Is also good, AILD Is just better :]<br>  <br>  BQ- Fav band atm ? I can't get enough of  The Devil Wears Prada & Atreyu :] I like the songs The Theft & The Crimson. & I love the songs Texas Is South & Still fly by THDP<br>  <br>  EDIT- Wow, Sorry about that  I just got bands mixed up.<br>  I was thinking of All That Remains.<br>  <br>  Wow,  I probably sound like a poser now aha :/<br>  But yeah I like their songs Forever * & Torn within<br>  <br>  EDIT- Dang I can't type at all today.|`|z1RmCqBbaa	i love bullet for my valentine, i would pick them over AILD any day|`|cumhOqjXaa	I like both bands also Within Destruction|`|dHkvVlONaa	I like bullet for my valentine better, only cause I havent really heard many of AILD's songs
mEqgRSlhaa	Lupin, as I said anything that's Harry Potter-related is superior to anything that's Twilight-related!!! :D<br>  <br>  And Lupin has a wand! HA! Beat that Jacob, beat that!|`|P5SftXVxaa	i loved the HP movies the 3rd was my fave but i will always love  *dramatic silence* but i will always them both if you put 2 and 2 together they will combine and since there bodies would be combined each one could attack the when it's not looking but i'd go for jacob i'm a guy and i think taylor lautner is HOT. gottcha i'm a female who made my avatar after her brother|`|b1cVZbX7aa	Remus Lupin.<br>  Coz Jacob is just a werewolf, but Remus is a wizard werewolf. He knows both magic and the werewolf fights. Remus is so good, intelligent, powerful, controlled, everything that could make him win.<br>  <br>  - AthulY!A -|`|XPYNqH5iaa	thats hard but a really good question cause they are both wherewolves I cant really decide|`|b71d71fcf1fd4d104e378baca7ee6ea2aa	Lupin...he has more in his arsenal than Jacob..like magic.|`|4ncmDzdjaa	LUPIN!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  BECUASE HP PWNS TWILIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|PkXJRfaBaa	Remus because he is both Wizard and Werewolf, while Jacob's just a wolf. I agree with "Weasley is my king"<br>  <br>  Plus he taught Harry how to duel whilst Jacob just stalks babies (Renesmee)|`|phH2dVYZaa	I'm writing a fan fic about that<br>  If you want you can see it, nothing wrong with a shameless self advert, eh? <br>  <br>  I haven't done the FIGHT scene yet, you'll have to wait ;]<br>  <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4884137/1/Harry_Potter_vs_Twilight" rel="nofollow">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4884137/1/Ha...</a><br>  <br>  Anyway, it's gonna be a pretty even fight but Lupin will win in my head anyway.|`|7tiH0gREaa	Lupin, no doubt. He's a wizard AND a werewolf. That means Remus wins.|`|dC6DX99gaa	Remus Lupin.He is the one who taught harry how to defend himself from Demintors. plus hes a nice guy! he will be in the 6th Harry Potter movie!!!!!!!!!!!!! i am such a HUGE fan of Harry Potter!!!!!!!!! :D|`|4F8b4D6Laa	Lupin.
3AlAVNKEaa	obviously you'd feel sorry for her <br>  bullying isn't something that can be taken lightly .. it's sad and mean<br>  but miley can now totally kick those girls assess for doing that to her.|`|k39bNUgeaa	I can believe it<br>  <br>  She is so annoying. She was probably the most hated at school like she is the most hated celebrity|`|mZUXkeyRaa	Yeah<br>  But look where she is now?<br>  She is rich & famous<br>  And the bullies are probably losers working at Mcdonalds or something<br>  (No offense to anyone who works at Mcdonalds..)|`|79b2yM3saa	Sweet Niblets - how could they pick on pancake-faced miley- espically because of her rich daddy  and easy career?\<br>  and shes dramitizing it!!! duh!|`|aBhW9YVXaa	even though i dont like her i feel bad...the first few who answered are mean..i dont like her either, but seriously?|`|B3N388wBaa	No. I don't. I would actually be one of those bullies if I was at her school<br>  <br>  I bet she just said that so that people would 'love' her more.|`|2BatkpPtaa	"They shoved me in. I was trapped. I banged on the door until my fists hurt. Nobody came," she wrote in the book. "I spent what felt like an hour in there, waiting for someone to rescue me, wondering how my life had gotten so messed up<br>  <br>  i may not be a super cool fan but anyone who went through that makes me feel bad|`|IpzapGwgaa	I hate her, she deserves it if it is even true. She has gotten so full of herself, she might want people to just feel bad for her.|`|TVouwqeVaa	eh i get bullied by some wacko chick but it really doesn't hurt<br>  oh and Miley Cyrus is a SELL OUT and was created by F***ING DISNEY CHANNEL|`|VcGJbLpzaa	omg,  i would think she was the most popular gurl in her skool but i guess not|`|ddfe14d34da951d370757abf429c9fb9aa	Now I know why she is a bully. So bad that she didn't learn from her past.|`|6P27whuGaa	I applaud the people who bullied her.<br>  Stupid hoe.|`|J9ZRpZ8caa	Goes to show bullies= FAIL|`|FOjH1frKaa	yeah, I do feel bad for her.|`|Nx1BaFPKaa	nope i dont fell bad or sorry for her. i hate her with all my heart

uUDNcsyUaa	The best!!??!! hahahaha.......hardly.  Trivium can obviously play their instruments very well but that doesn't automatically make them the best.  Their sound isn't very original, especially the solos.  Of course this is a purley opinionated question but I think it's pretty obvious there are better solo-ers out there.  A few that come to mind:<br>  <br>  Nevermore<br>  Dream Theater<br>  Opeth<br>  Lamb of God|`|IKYRKsloaa	Not the number 1 best modern metal solo I'm sure, but some of the best definitely.<br>  <br>  Dream Theatre's got some good solo's, and the small faction of Avenged Sevenfold that IS metal has some good ones. But yes, Trivium does have many of the best solo's of Modern Metal.|`|IvAJwpjgaa	Trivium is all right. they gots some attitude(a good thing) and melodic(Shogun)...not a bad musicianship...some "proggy' sound...bla bla bla<br>  <br>  anyway...the answer is no. because there`s Nevermore, Buckethead etc.|`|7SsfqbZRaa	Trivium SUCKS!!!!!! There just Metallica rip-offs!!!!|`|kP0JGI1waa	trivium's guitar solos are not even close, i am sorry to say.  dragonforce holds that spot! (dont worry, i am kidding)<br>  <br>  really, i would say Dream Theater, check out the Dark Eternal Night solo for proof of that.  Really it comes down to the virtuosos like Petrucci, Michael Angelo Batio, Steve Vai, Paul Gilbert, etc.  If you want more of a band thing, then check out Cyanide by Burning the Masses and Sadistic Abductive by Brain Drill (bass solo is sick too).<br>  <br>  edit: i would also like to add between the buried and me and opeth to that list.|`|mJgAZTTyaa	hey zach, your should get your facts streight befor talking ****. trivium used to be awesome and have great solos (mabey not the best but damn near it). Acendancy was a great album, then they had to go and start sucking. They are no longer trivium they are trivallica

Just watching the lightning streak across the sky, forking down or illuminating the thunderheads...beautiful, simply breathtaking...|`|46fouwFfaa	I love rainstorms.

C7YbYUYPaa	Hey Thinker!<br>  <br>  H2PMommie is a complete idiot by the way, and I will go on pretending I never read that ridiculous answer she gave.<br>  <br>  MA1: Absolutely, but when Freddie Mercury is your lead singer, I don't care how well you sing, you are always in the shadows.  I think Roger hit the higher notes better than Freddie on some songs, and is a fantastic singer for being a drummer.<br>  <br>  BA1: I have a few...<br>  <br>  I'm In Love With My Car<br>  Doing All Right<br>  My Fairy King<br>  <br>  BA2: Brian May.  Roger just sings too high all the time for me.  I still think he is a great singer, but I prefer Brian.<br>  <br>  BA3: Roger Taylor.  This is the only song I prefer Roger over Freddie actually.  I think Roger's voice fits the song better.|`|Yg2iIneKaa	. I loved his voice. I just hated that he had to engage in a dangerous  life style and he was taken away from us way too soon.  He was a winner in all senses of the word... I wish AIDS awareness had been around when poor Freddie was actively having his sex life.  <br>  I really was taken by his talent.<br>  Freddie Mercury was one of the few REAL TALENTS OF THIS EARTH. I can't answer your questions you asked, because every time i read something about Mercury.  I get too sad.|`|R3oNViF8aa	I think Roger was an underrated singer. Same with Brian May.<br>  <br>  BQ1: The Loser in the End<br>  BQ2: Depends on the mood I'm in. At the moment, Brian May<br>  BQ3: I'll get back to you.|`|URO3gDXcaa	yes<br>  i'm in love with my car<br>  may<br>  roger|`|SztleLnUaa	MQ1: I think Roger has a good voice, but being in the same band with Freddie.......<br>  <br>  BQ2: Although the song does not touch me at all, I like Roger's voice in the song "I'm In Love With My Car"<br>  BQ2: Between the two, definitely Roger! I can't stand Brian's "weak" voice, especially now that he got older!<br>  BQ3: Freddie all the way!!! Roger seams to make too much effort at some points!<br>  Very few singers can touch Freddie on vocals, let alone stage persona!|`|AosW4IvHaa	I love his voice.  All of them except for John Deacon could sing well.<br>  The song i loved most that was sung by Roger Taylor would be.. The tribute to Mercury .. "Those were the day's of our lives".  I loved it.<br>  Thanks for the great question, and keeping Queen alive.<br>  Thinker, I'd send you a link of the youtube video ... But i'm sure you've seen it.  H2Pmommie.. No one in the band was gay other than Freddie Mercury.. Oh I freddie and all his gayness.<br>  <br>  Oh yes I agree with "A Kind Of Magic"  If Freddie Mercury's singing no others will be on top.. No even David Bowie.|`|ILZY7BD0aa	Hi Thinker, <br>  <br>  I think Roger had the best voice aside from Freddie Mercury.. Of course no one i ever heard other than, Roy Orbison, could fade Freddie Mercury.. Or Pavarotti the Opera singer... I think the lady Freddie sang with at the Olympics could maybe sing better than Freddie Ms. Montserrat. I can't spell her name <br>  She gave me goose bumps when i listened to her sing.|`|NQ37mnWkaa	I'm not a big Queen fan, but I like quite a bit :)<br>  <br>  <br>  MQ : Yes, I do. <br>  Many people still don't realise that not only did Freddie not write all of their songs, he also didn't sing them all. <br>  <br>  BQ1 : The only one I know ~ 'I'm In Love with My Car<br>  <br>  BQ2 : I think Brian just has the edge, based purely on my lack of songs sung by Roger. <br>  <br>  BQ3 : Wow. That song was a new one for me, and I think they each make it totally different. Roger sounded like he had a soft 'Robert Plant thing' going on there, whereas Freddie was pure 'arena rock'! I can't choose...<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit to BQ2 :<br>  Okay, I've just listened to 'Tenement Funster', and I really like Roger's vocal on that one, but not on 'Drowse'. For me, I think Roger was more hit-and-miss than Brian...

Lift up the collar of your shirt and put the tie around the back of your neck. The wide end should hang down about twice as low as the thin end; it can hang closer to your right or left hand, depending on what’s most comfortable for you.<br>  <br>  2. Wrap the wide end around the thin end twice, a few inches below your neck. The wide end should go over the thin end at first. (Images 1 to 3)<br>  <br>  3. After wrapping the wide end around the second time, push it through the back of the V-shape made by the partially formed knot. (Image 4)<br>  <br>  4. Tuck the wide end through the front loop of the knot.<br>  <br>  5. Gently pull down on both the thin and wide ends below the knot until the knot is tight.<br>  <br>  6. Hold the thin end and slide the knot up to your neck. (Image 5)<br>  <br>  7. If the thin end hangs below the wide end, untie the tie and begin again, with the wide end hanging lower than it did the first time.<br>  <br>  8.

qThmcR1Aaa	Cool. I usually don't do the "best ever" polls, because what objective criteria can you use anyway?<br>  <br>  -- Bill Bruford -- a rock drummer with a creative jazz drummer's soul -- played all around the beat but never lost sight of it. Brought lots of tracks alive just with his contribution.<br>  <br>  -- John Bonham -- the sound of thunder. Nuff said.<br>  <br>  -- Phil Collins -- don't laugh. Listen to some old Genesis albums, when Gabriel was still in the band and Collins focused 100% on drums. He was a monster.<br>  <br>  -- Stewart Copeland -- tight, clean, and precise. One of the best timekeepers in the biz, with an economic approach to playing that somehow never gets boring.<br>  <br>  -- Tim Alexander -- from Primus. Any drummer who can keep up with Les Claypool is OK in my book.|`|3005d3b9180d1ef915398a770d0e19f2aa	John Bonham (Led Zeppelin)<br>  Daniel Erlandsson (Arch Enemy)<br>  Tim Alexander (Primus)<br>  Roy Mayorga (Soulfly-orig., Stone Sour)<br>  <br>  and I have a thing for Tommy Lee *blushes*|`|jfEb0tIJaa	1.

AA12144404	The internet does not alter the amount of social interaction, it simply changes the venue. Instead of friendships being formed, and ideas exchanged across the street, they are now spread around the world.<br>  <br>  As for the depth of those interactions, that will vary with subject as it always does. There will always be things that you would not want the neighbor finding out, but a person a thousand miles away, whom you may never meet in person can be a good resource.<br>  <br>  The internet is really no more than an old party-line phone set up...with graphics.|`|2X2wjYb4aa	Hi hedzy,<br>  <br>  I'd have to say consolidate social interaction. I think the question then becomes, is the consolidation for the better, or for the worse? The human being is a social animal, and language seems to have developed along with that preference for social interaction. One's comfort level in interacting with others is the key; for shy people, or for some who just dislike face-to-face interaction for some other (presumably psychological) reason, Internet communication opens up their otherwise closed-off 'voices'.|`|qGNkB2Ipaa	I do think so.<br>  Basically, in real life you are afraid of yelling or telling someone you love them, or even saying swear words.<br>  <br>  But in the internet or texting since the person can't see you or may not notice as much you can say almost anything.<br>  <br>  People may see you as a different person online in on earth.<br>  <br>  Maybe in this situation,<br>  You want to tell someone you hate them.<br>  like swearing.. even if you don't know as well.<br>  Then they'll just tell you back.. no violence.<br>  Just words.<br>  <br>  But in Real life you just say.<br>  " i don't like you that much"<br>  <br>  You'll regret anything you said or yet typed them.<br>  But in life youl be more carefull of what you say.<br>  <br>  In the other side of the case,<br>  Youll be more connected to people even if theyre far away or changed schools.|`|ld1vh7nHaa	it consolidated social interaction for me. i "met" the girl i live with on answers 3 years ago this month.|`|WQvDIhmgaa	Wow good question, it opens up the door for other questions...hope that helped...<br>  <br>  it does both|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	It can do both, depending on the person and their communication style. For me, it's been nothing but beneficial; I'm not very social, and keeping in touch with people online is just perfect for me. It facilitates my social interaction.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	For some people, I believe it destroys social interaction because they tend to retreat even further into their own.  For me, the internet enables me to keep in touch with people who live far from me now without taking the time for a phone call.  I have also connected with a lot of quality people on the internet who have taught me a lot and peaked my curiosity on certain subjects, making me want to research things further.|`|grifjdr0aa	I had this discussion with my therapist yesterday and she actually believes I'm better off with some of the online relationships I have (male and female friends) than some of the sick real life relationships I have.  So I guess take that for what it's worth.  I spend alot of time on the internet cuz I can choose who to talk to and when.  I'm kind of a loner.  I prefer to talk to people that have similar pasts that I do.  I open up more talking to someone on the internet, becuase I'm quite shy in real life.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	In some ways it destroys it-no face to face conversation ( I think some have forgotten the art of conversation), lack of interest in proper spelling, grammar, etc., this anonymity allows people to say(type) things they would never say to a live person.  It also consolidates it through-e-mail, chat rooms, Y/A  for example,  these are quick reference points for information and entertainment between people that would probably never meet.  You get ALL points of view whether you want to or not.|`|AA11370204	In my most humble opinion, Internet Communications <br>  consolidates social interaction because that causes <br>  people to communicate with each other and creates friendships and a whole new concept on creating new<br>  social orders of groups of different ideas and social upbringing! It would be very beneficial to this country!|`|y9CgveCGaa	I think it helps me.  Sometimes it is hard for me to pick up the phone and call friends.  I have an easier time messaging them on facebook or sending email than calling.

nxHjSKTTaa	My 9 year old daughter is a Pisces, she is amazing! I wish I had her spirit! She smiles and lights up a room! She loves to make everyone laugh and feel loved. <br>  However when she is mad, watch out! She is a total Drama Queen! Her nick name is Drama! If she's unhappy she lets everyone know about it.  My son and I are Scorpios so her open, loud  temper tantrums are a bit much for the quiet Scorp.  When she's happy there is no one else I'd rather be with or like.  She is so high spirited! She has so much love in her. I am very proud of my high spirited drama queen!|`|AA11417199	easily influenced in their environment..good or bad.|`|NRhrO833aa	They have magnificent goals, sometimes unattainable through humanly means, for ex. they would be really good at a sport, but at that time, they would feel really in love, thinking maybe they could be an all star pro [not saying they can't, it's just the thought process], but on other times, they can be hard on themselves. They feel as if they owe it their all to their lovers, buying them way too many flowers and cakes and cookies and bears etc. They are really kind hearted people, yet sometimes annoying. One of my brother's is a pisces.|`|QZzQdh43aa	i'm fairly fond of pisces people. there are some i really enjoy, and some i don't, but one thing's for sure - they always come with a great sense of humor. they seem to always be looking for some adventure to go or something to be involved in. they also like having close relationships with people. i love 'em =)|`|kHLwlNA5aa	I think that on average, we're probably the same as people with other signs.|`|g8QMrSzwaa	they are unpredictable..|`|q5OJURtbaa	Well I am a Pisces... <br>  I am very elusive, hard to pin down to a yes or no answer, basically answering questions with questions. I love deeply, am ferociously loyal, sometimes to a fault. I trust completely and although I see truths right in front of me, somehow lie to myself to give people the benefit of the doubt. My sense of reality is skewed, I have been told numerous times that I see the world through rose colored glasses. I am at my best when I am needed, I give my heart and soul into taking care of others. I have a fantastic sense of humor! I'm very quiet around those I don't know, I love to watch instead of engage, but once I'm comfortable I'm quite a bundle to handle. I feel others experiences and pain as if they were my own. Once I am a friend, I am always a friend, I've kept friendships close in my life as far back as preschool.|`|oatLAxQQaa	basically i think pisceans cant help but contradict themselves. that's only because they want to please every person.so what they said to you today will be completely the opposite to what the'll  say to you tomorrow. pisceans want the world to be a better place less fights more compromise. try your best not to be harsh to them. they have the ability to hurt you so deep with they're sarcasm and spite. but be calm,accept them as they are and they'll give more respect and warmth than you can get from any other sun sign. they love deeply. but even if they dont really love you they wont say it coz then they'd be hurting you right? if you want to woo a piscean you need to totally open up to them. even though they oblige you and are very sweet to you dont underestimate them. NEVER underestimate them. they are very intelligent;cerebral really. they absolutely need they're freedom. you know they say scorpio and pisces are the most compatible sun signs. but many a time scorpio is too overpowering for the gentle but very independent minded pisces. he or she will give you subtle signs if you are too bossy or overpowering. i think they get along better with earth signs. piscean and scorpio combos are way too emotional for either of the signs to handle.there would be floods with the tears! again not always. so just chill out when you're around pisceans. laugh joke play the fool. dont take them too seriously. respect them and they will be the most genuine and loving people you will ever meet|`|0dTN4Grvaa	they r nice poeple who have a lot to talk about !!!!!!!|`|L39mQJYJaa	Shaq O'Neill is a Pisces, and he's a pretty good basketball player.

Y1aAGPURaa	That was sooo funny!   Here's a nun joke for you:<br>  <br>  Arthur was sitting outside his local pub one day, enjoying a quiet pint and generally feeling good about himself, when a nun suddenly appears at his table and starts decrying the evils of drink. <br>  <br>  "You should be ashamed of yourself young man! Drinking is a Sin! Alcohol is the blood of the devil!" <br>  <br>  Now Arthur gets pretty annoyed about this, and goes on the offensive. <br>  <br>  "How do *you* know, Sister?" <br>  <br>  "My Mother Superior told me so" <br>  <br>  "But have you ever had a drink yourself? How can you be sure that what you are saying is right?" <br>  <br>  "Don't be ridiculous - of course I have never taken alcohol myself" <br>  <br>  "Then let me buy you a drink - if you still believe afterwards that it is evil I will give up drink for life" <br>  <br>  "How could I, a Nun, sit outside this public house drinking?!" <br>  <br>  "I'll get the barman to put it in a teacup for you, them no-one will know" <br>  <br>  The Nun reluctantly agrees, so Arthur goes inside to the bar. <br>  <br>  "Another pint for me, and a triple vodka on the rocks", then he lowers his voice and says to the barman "... and could you put the vodka in a teacup?" <br>  <br>  "Oh no! It's not that drunken Nun again is it?"|`|TjWA37kuaa	hahahahahaha I love your joke....thanks 4 making my day..here a * 4U to make your day :)|`|A7ovwP94aa	Absolutely fab - I will save in my faves.|`|XLtQ6ZU9aa	Haha that is so funny!!!|`|J9OUW7JRaa	ha ha i love it!|`|6Vm28sw4aa	That just made my day!!

I agree with you, from others peoples point of view lol mainly SOME men who think if it as different levels of attractiveness  such as adorable, cute, fine, smokin, hot,....ect but Beautiful rates top to me because it also defines one personality too! We of the Sisterhood have this trait, so own it.<br>  V....V|`|wzue5Xzbaa	I've never been a fan of that word.|`|AA12252260	someone woke up on the wrong side of the emo-bed...|`|PD1WpoEsaa	never! <br>  id like to be cute the rest of my life! lol|`|4sW8MFxCaa	the only time i say that is when i'm being sarcastic|`|dl0EpJPDaa	You're not cute.  <br>  Happy now?<br>  Yep, definitely EMO-ish.|`|d4f6400ded99a1dec7d1c509edd9fae1aa	Lol isn't cute just adorable?

QZFRxZamaa	Really like her? that's not good enough, she's almost 30! you're 20...shes aiming for commitment and marriage and children....and I'm guessing you're not.<br>  Her 30th birthday is gonna be a midlife crisis..the big three-O....<br>  The age difference doesn't matter as much as your intentions...do u want commitment or some fun?...if commitment, then yay! go for it...gud look.|`|9CCtt077aa	I don't think it's such a big age difference at all. I mean, you're both in your twenties and you're both adults. :) Go for it! Who cares what other people say. You'll regret it later if you let her go. Trust me. Older woman and younger man is a hot combination (usually). And yes, these types of relationships can work out just fine. I'm sure you guys can have a lot in common.|`|87yovKYlaa	not really that big of a deal. my husband is 4 years younger than me and we get along great when he is around (his work takes him out of town a lot). age isn't as important as being on the same level and having the same goals. if you 2 communicate well and are willing to compromise on the tough issues then the little ones will work themselves out. good luck.|`|3m4YrL8qaa	I think you can make it work if you like her! my friend danielle is 20 too and she's dating a 32 year old, who also happens to be her boss. but yeah it can work!|`|RMh0a3DSaa	Thats not that big of a difference at all! I say go for it. You dont want to always wonder about what could have happened with "that one girl". :) hope i helped.|`|RALliiZTaa	I myself would prefer someone who is 3 years older or younger than me. there is an age difference but about 9 years. if she is someone you really like her I say follow your heart|`|0FWtWxMGaa	yea shes just most likely a little more mature then you<br>   but why would you put her name on the net lol <br>  cuz now if she happens to get on here she"ll see your asking for relationship help on the net which is kinda akward<br>  <br>  Just keepin it real with ya man.,|`|f59pApq7aa	go for it..!

THIS is why you need your cell phone. You have to stop in your tracks and call your opthamologist. First.......Remove the glasses....... for god's sake remove them quickly. It is vital to do this. It is illegal to wear them without a current prescription and they can arrest you immediately. I know....... makes you feel like you are being "framed" for something you couldn't prevent. *wink*|`|mUed9bXYaa	they self-destruct|`|AA10838250	no|`|DmKH9ZaRaa	You just get your spare pair to ..

While getting my hair cut the other day, I noticed a thick cushy mat under my feet, very comfortable (just having my long hair trimmed, so had to stand) anyway the gal told me the other person who uses her station has a bad back so the company got her this special padded mat...the gal cutting my hair said it was great cause she got to use it too since they share the "chair"... she also said a drs note was needed to get one..I thought that was sorta strange, I think they should all get something good to stand on to prevent strain on backs, legs etc.|`|f5oZRD6faa	If he gets a special chair everyone should get a special chair..who cares about his spine? Lol =)|`|M9FiPNQ4aa	If it was through no fault of his own i would say yes,or he would have to lay in a bed the rest of his life.

grifjdr0aa	I do not give them money.  I give them cigarettes, food, and information re the homeless shelter and other services here. I will not contribute to alcoholism or drug addiction.|`|eqKlHSaLaa	I'd give it if i had it to give, but i'd worry about my own money problems before i start to worry about someone elses.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	I prefer to give them a meal or something else that's tangible, because they could spend the cash on drugs or alcohol.|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	Yes, always.  I don't care what they need it for...I have it to give...so I do.|`|st2zmU88aa	yeah when i have it...<br>  <br>  no it don't bother me, because i'm not a snob, and i realize that things happen in peoples lives that are beyond their control puttin them in positions they never thought they would be...plus most homeless people are mentally disabled. People are so quick to tell them to get a job not knowing how hard that actually is for them.|`|WWOOQ51zaa	Well I don't give money because I haven't gone any, but there is homeless person who hangs on the corner of my street and often sleeps in my door way (I live above a pub) so I give him cups of teas and such like.|`|jy52NZEjaa	it pisses me off. but i still give them atleast a dollar.<br>  im downtown all the time, so if im ever in trouble, i hope one of the homeless help me.|`|vryw9udtaa	i have never had that happen to me, because i live in a small town. i don't know if i would...maybe a small amount of money.|`|Mu3UvybKaa	It makes me horribly sad. I prefer to give them food, but if I'm in a hurry & have extra cash, I'll give them a little|`|CApnEZ83aa	I feel pity and give them some money.|`|Uq9qPZ75aa	A few bucks won't hurt, why not?|`|hsvgllTwaa	i feel sorry for them, but i dont give money|`|f06Sy0dfaa	No, most of them stand out on the street with a sign that says "Lost Everything". I feel that if they have the time to stand out on the road and beg for money, they have time to put in applications. Most homeless people only want money for beer... and I don't feel bad about not giving them money. Some companies even help homeless people, by giving them jobs that pay by the day, and they give them a way to get to work and everything.. so NO, I don't give money.|`|NZusvcspaa	I don't give homeless people money when they are on the streets begging because you just dont know what they will use the money for but I do regularly by the 'Big Issue' so they can help themselfs. I also do voluntary work, working with the homeless so they can visit a drop in centre for a feed and a chat/advise. Much more likely to have a positive outcome that way.|`|kx8WRRvsaa	i dont give them any money....i strongly agree with this quote:<br>  <br>  "give a man a fish he will eat for a day, give a man a fishing rod he will eat for life"<br>  <br>  so i dont give them money, but if they ever asked me for anything that could help them EARN money then id not hesitate to help.|`|aU2yDd8qaa	I went to town to spend my birthday money with a friend, we saw this homeless guy, so I decided to give him a load of money. It left me feeling good about myself, but I bet he wasted it on booze.<br>  <br>  Oh, and whenever I see a homeless person I do give them some change.|`|d69d49545272c36ef0603d8151da8422aa	I feel pity and also very lucky. I cannot help but help them.<br>  <br>  Jesus said what we do for the least of his people we do for him.<br>  <br>  His brother James said in contrdicting Paul somewhat, "Faith without works is dead".<br>  <br>  I try to live by these as much as I can.|`|9IfItE9uaa	My mother always believes what goes around comes around, yes i give money to homeless people and once a box of cookies<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Not all homeless are homeless becuz drugs and booze i would know personally|`|3fGZMZkTaa	I feel bad for them, but I know they are just going to spend the money on drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes.|`|1TsqUfAGaa	no i don't give them money<br>  i normally go to a fast food place and bring them a crapload of food back.|`|4u8YVgMmaa	bothers me|`|DDol2J8maa	I usually give, even if I know it's going to be used for drugs.<br>  I don't judge how others live their lives.|`|7Ce2oC9Yaa	It bothers me a lot.  Yes, I give them money.|`|mN4PIcRqaa	if someone comes up and asks me i usually give|`|AA11569882	No.  I feel bad for them, but I don't ever give them money.  I used to buy the Big Issue from a chap, and I got talking to him and he even told me that he doesn't need to be on the streets, he just finds life easier there.

fjNxzd6Baa	I wonder if his departure connects to the possible arrival finally of Olivia's son, Dante. I thought I heard the same actor would play Damian and Dante. Could lead to some interesting mistaken identity situations since they probably won't announce Spinelli's departure to all of Port Charles.<br>  <br>  It would be interesting if the FBI ended up picking up Dante thinking he was Damian leading to the possible exposure of his paternity by Sonny.|`|ADBMrG87aa	I didn't see this coming but this will make the show that more interesting to watch with Spinelli on an adventure on his own.  Doesn't surprise me though that Spin would leave as to spare his friend and mentor Stone Cold from the predicament with the Feds.  I think that Sam, Jason and the Priestess will find enough dirt on Raynor while trying to find the Jackal.<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|M1ymLE9Paa	I think Jason and Sam will find a way to help Spinelli.  I just hope its sooner, rather than later.  I kind of saw it coming, as in, I had a feeling that eventually Spinelli would feel it was up to him to solve his problems w/the Feds, but I was hoping it wouldn't come to this.|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	Spin and Winnie go on an adventure. They get caught up in an art smuggling scheme. We'll find out Raynor has shady dealing with Equinox..|`|o5jSID4Jaa	Awww, poor Spinelli. I was just waiting on him to take matters into his own hands.

I'm curious to see what kind of mess he gets himself into while on the run.|`|tgVGE2Umaa	I knew he would leave rather than put Jason in more danger, hopefully Jason and Sam will be able to help him out with getting dirt on Raynor before he gets sent to a federal prison. I just love the character of Spinelli.|`|l3k21kTmaa	i think that Spinelli will eventally come back as soon as Jason wacks that dirty agent...I hope!|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	To tell the truth I haven't watched it enough to see it coming but I could have just cried after he kissed Maxie and the look on his face when he was leaving.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I knew that agent was dirty!

MlraNN6Maa	Honestly? I feel that anyone who thinks that a girl is a hoe or a **** because she is friends with a lot of boys is only jealous that this other girl is friends with so many guys.<br>  <br>  Listen, I have more guy friends than girl friends. Oh, but guess what? I'm not a hoe. I don't whore myself around my guy friends and I know better than f*ck up my life and open my legs at my age. As well, a lot of these guy friends of mine I have known since elementary school. We're all in 11th grade now. As a result I get treated with a sort of brother-sister mentality around them. The fact that we've known each other for so long only justifies that me and my guy friends have a deep mutual feeling of respect that is purely platonic.<br>  <br>  I mean seriously, please tell your friend not to generalize on such shallow ideas. It goes the same way when a friend of mine was accused of being gay just because he hung out with girls all the time. Just don't do it! :P|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I don't care much one way or another. I hung out with a lot of guys at one point because of the nature of my hobby at the time (fencing), but I never dated anyone from that crowd. People who make judgments like the one you sited are just out to create drama.|`|mNC4r3EIaa	Nothing really. It doesn't make her a hoe. Usually when a girl doesn't have any girlfriends she's a tomboy.|`|SYsAJH8Faa	I've started to notice that girls are becoming to much like guys. they hang around with guys, they're becoming REAL footy lovers (girls playing footy aswell as watching it.) and there all seires about the game. some girls call me mate and slap me on the back. and these girls hang around with guys all the time. I agree with ur friend. girls shouldn't ALWAYS hang around with guys to the point they become just like them! other wise they become hoes.|`|wJ57ikHxaa	Nothing at all..... I hang out with mostly guys and I still do although as Ive gotten older I have accumulated more girls as friends. Girls are so caddy toward each other and are jealous and all that immature stuff so its just easier to hang around guys than girls. It cuts down on the drama.|`|k0dZeYQ6aa	5lut. w#ore.

AztCTaQlaa	You're not dead inside.<br>  <br>  You have a different sense of humor than the dumb asses that make (and watch) movies like all those. Maybe you have a more intellectual humor (like Frasier or the Big Bang Theory), or the sick kind where you laugh when the guy with the chainsaw actually catches the half naked girl and cuts her leg off. you just have to find your thing.|`|EihCVyg4aa	maybe its possible that your a virgin and it sucks having to hear sex jokes all the time and not be able to get the real thing....this is just a suggestion...please dont take it personally|`|Fz9p01BPaa	just because you don't laugh at stuff other people do, it doesn't make you dead (on the inside).

There are also the preferences of the others involved to be considered.  I can generalize to some extent that I tend to be more comfortable with people I know well as the tickling gets closer to my or the other person's face or socially sensitive areas.  While tickling in different areas has different but relatively equal intensities belonging to each, some areas have a more universal response level.  Almost anyone is more than welcome to tickle my feet, for instance.|`|daaf98fda077fbcf980e059669c29f08aa	My former partner, who was horribly ticklish but loved it,<br>  I would tie up, then start with the armpits.<br>  <br>  Then when the hysteria increased I would do the nipples,<br>  which would cause panting and a screaming orgasm<br>  after about 5 min.<br>  <br>  WAY FUN!<br>  <br>  Me I don't really have a fave spot.

810dc43f1132995029a6739f7b574f87aa	Its just plain and simple fun.  Its a little naughty and glamorous.  Most of us, women, young or old, are caught up in the romance and the whirlwind of pretty dresses and exotic get aways.  For an hour at night time after the kids go to bed we get to fall into the couch and they kinda let us slip away from reality and we all kinda think we could be there for a moment in time.  Then and only then  we get to be wisked away from our kitchens and our busy somewhat boring lives and get caught up in the dream world of reality tv and fantasize a little.  And when the train wrecks happen they make us appreciate what we have even more.  At least it does for me.|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	I think a lot of us want to believe in happily ever after and the show has over the top dates, and blah blah blah.  You're right ,real lasting love takes time and work.<br>  <br>  This is the first season I've watched since Ryan and Trista, and I am disappointed in the ending.  I think ABC blew it this time.|`|qXJnNelsaa	All I can say is, it's a guilty pleasure.  It gives us something to gossip about.  I totally think it"find love" on a show), let's just say what it really is, it's a chance to get on tv, possibly become famous and rich, and have lots of hot women pining for you!  But nevertheless, I LOVE it|`|AA10892706	I'm with you! My baby sitter was telling me yesterday that bachelor was on for 3 hours on Monday night!  I have never watched ANY of those shows and never will. So many people do watch them though, that's all I hear about in my office.|`|E7zCS7qBaa	The "us" you refer to are all single women who falsely think some knight in shining armor is going to come by and save the day. what happened recently on the bachelor is more realistic. Ladies, get your heads out of the clouds.|`|97lvgI56aa	its because we in America love to see drama and other peoples  doing stuff wrong or right in their lives. we also like to talk amongst or self about what we think. ABC keeps playing it cuz its hot and none else has that show.|`|XEBpv9gwaa	They keep pumping it out because they keep getting good ratings.<br>  <br>  I agree it is ridiculous.  Why do we see dating a crowd of people all at once as acceptable?  Or being one of the people dating someone else who is dating a crowd?  Where is the self respect?<br>  <br>  Anyway, I think you nailed it by calling it a train wreck.  There is some pull that draws people in and they can't look away.  I suppose it gets our mind off the real problems for awhile.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	I think everyone likes fantasy love, just look at the fantasy teen lov ein twilight, now all teens want tobe a vampire. we all want to believe they will all fall inlove and live hapily ever after, we just forget that cinderella had ot deal with alot after the ball.

While a Jonas Brothers album may sell a million or  so copies, at the time NKOTB albums would sell tens of millions of copies, and that was over 20 years ago.|`|2EE9L1Q7aa	They were bigger than the Jonas Brothers.

That doesn't make sense, normal people need time and growth to form love for each other.<br>  <br>  I think what this refers to is major attraction at first sight.  That I do believe in.<br>  <br>  It's not all about the feelings in the beginning of two peoples relationship.  Time will tell if you "Love" a person, in the next phase or so of the relationship.|`|vvdc5EnTaa	no because there are many things about a person (their past, their habits, their views, their overall personality) that you don't find out about the first time you see them. Love is something that grows. You have to really get to know the person to trully love them. <br>  Sometimes lust can seem like love because both are very overwhelming but lust is very different. With one single mistake, if you are in lust with someone, can change your opinion of them entirely. When you love them, you acknowledge the mistake, try your best to correct it as much as possible, feel down maybe or depressed about it, but you will never stop loving them. And that takes a lot from someone to be able to do that. I think a lot of people that claim they are in love and then just a few years later deny they love the person anymore, was never really in love but rather lust. True love is rare. I do not think that it happens in one single glance (or one single chat for blind people). Never.|`|WrgTsfJyaa	i spose it really depends if its lust or love i know i lust for quite a few guys.... i dunno i guess it could happen...|`|Yjybt35taa	I never did, until I experienced it... AMAZING, it's a once-in-a-lifetime thing :D|`|lpGW3GwJaa	Yes - absolutely.|`|GqxpBlEiaa	No because that's when a devorice comes in if u get married love at first sight|`|qEfJvQBWaa	yes<br>  but if the guy ends up to be a jerk i believe it is called love at first failure|`|dTDAuRbvaa	yes, people cant explain why another person can feel afection for someone the first day they see them.|`|0xRhEUo5aa	Only when you look at chocolate. Lol.|`|DAH48qSOaa	not often, but i wuv girls :)|`|HOsF3g0maa	yes|`|UF64MzAsaa	na|`|a866ed1383c61579591a7f80c2bf84d5aa	sometimes|`|Y0pFoz4caa	no itz all fake!!!!!!!!|`|TsQumtCLaa	i believe in LUST in first sight..love takes practice|`|bLVIrZoTaa	yep|`|yRGPVcyvaa	defo|`|RdfPFIOoaa	no... love is something that 2 people learn to have for each other|`|keTNfOOhaa	yep|`|2M4pqLUdaa	No, it doesn't exist. However, I do believe in Lust at first sight.|`|0Ye27X48aa	NO.<br>  you might have a crush on that person but that's not quite love then.|`|7WrGHYqeaa	Depends if there naked or not.|`|UW4J8ow5aa	haha nope.|`|yI9pFCudaa	Yes.|`|ugvgt6rMaa	Well i kind of did BUT my sunday school teacher explain to the class that that's all B.S.|`|9iNCQkWlaa	Twice...and divorced...Twice|`|avlVHXDCaa	not really|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	yea riiiiiiiiiiiiiight|`|wdnbwViFaa	yes|`|r2T7A9zFaa	I'm not sure.|`|gEkLQWF4aa	Somewhat...I believe in having some sort of attraction to someone at first site. I still remember with great clarity the first time I saw my fiance..we'll be married in May. I just felt something when I saw him..(and it wasn't lust. He's not really a great looking guy.) We didn't start dating until a few months after, but I felt an instant attraction. It's a chemical thing..some people have certain chemicals in their brain that are attracted to other people with the same types of chemicals..saw a study on it on the discovery channel. I didn't really "love" him until quite a few months after we were dating, but the attraction was there, for sure. I have a horrible memory, and this was four years ago that I first saw him, but I can still see his face. His face lit up when I walked through the door to the restaraunt he managed. Maybe he felt something, too.<br>  As for blind people, same thing goes. You don't really see love..they could perhaps talk to someone and feel the connection right then and there.|`|U1pMvDvgaa	Yes, i remember the first time I saw a steaming pot of chicken and dumplings, I fell in love and my feelings have never changed.|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	You can gauge your relationship potential within 3 minutes of meeting somebody.|`|oMj8WAHFaa	yes it does actually it depends if emotionally or physically, physically last for 2 weeks and emotionally for ever, blind people idk good question!|`|aRDXTWIDaa	yes, but i also believe in vampires so i'm not a very good judge<br>  XD|`|lwJF5DhHaa	yup|`|CArzkDIUaa	no, love takes a long time to gain, just like respect|`|2LYIMahxaa	Yes, when you adopt a pet.|`|HLghr3ocaa	nope, because you dont know the person.<br>  so you are practically judging them by the outside.<br>  you need to get to know a person before you fall in love with them.<br>  <br>  i do believe you can look at someone and say "that person is gorgeous" and maybe crush on them but you cant fall in love with them that second.|`|FSpL3s1raa	I believe that if you fall in love with someone quickly, you can look back at the first time you saw them and remember feeling an electricity that might be described as love.  <br>  <br>  For blind people, I guess it would be love at first meet. :)  Or at first touch?|`|uqLUKbMbaa	For Alanagh and me it was just that.  Although she played me along for a while.  She told me about it afterwards.  That was over 57 years ago and we are even more in love now than we were then.  Like good wine in a cask, it gets sweeter as the years go by.|`|rp2Ogvbmaa	No, but I believe in the mind being a powerful thing, and it can trick you into thinking you are in love at first sight.  So, in a sense, yes.|`|29WFvvNPaa	Yes.  It happened to me.  When I first saw my husband, there was a spark between us.  My stomach was full of butterflies.

When my husband and I met something went off inside, even though I had just broken off with who I thought was the love of my life.  I decided to ignore that "something" and about 1 year later we saw each other again.  Now we're happily married with kids etc.  The funny part was that my husband said he felt the same way. We did not hook up right away but I guess it was inevitable (fate).<br>  <br>  For Blind People- Yes, I think you feel love not see it.|`|zFQi5U5Naa	Yes I do I feel that moment that you set eyes on that special person you just feel a connection that , that is the person you want to spend the rest of your life with|`|niZBsn9Qaa	(staring)<br>  <br>  marry me!<br>  <br>  LOL<br>  <br>  that reminds me of the corniest pick up line ever "do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again?"<br>  <br>  heehee|`|AA12147036	all the time<br>  <a href="http://www.authspot.com/Poetry/The-House-with-All-the-Lights-Off.499093" rel="nofollow">http://www.authspot.com/Poetry/The-House...</a>|`|xWyXbsw6aa	lust at first sight - or infatuation. love takes time - but i suppose its not unheard of! i'd have to get to know them before i love them ! :)|`|QXnZy9m2aa	not love at first sight<br>  more like lust at first sight<br>  we look them over and might find them sexually attractive.<br>  then we go over and try to get too know them|`|u70ecVvBaa	yes i do. can you PLEASE answer mine?

AA12050428	It really irritates me when brainless 'celebs' are asked for their opinion on world issues. Some of them cannot even speak properly. The media has created these morons.|`|ed8e4f9bdf039903975d76be5f2cfd3faa	Yes it would. We don't even get real news now :) All the celebrity "news" is faked (or most of it is) as magazines like Heat become more popular than serious issue newsprint, and those newsprints with "real news" are controlled by the government filtering us with information.<br>  <br>  Damn them all. I just tend not to watch the news or pay attention :)|`|AA11656721	The world has many problems even with the news showing celebrities.

Alot of people feel taken by the twig thin celebs, or how pretty they are. And then go down on themselves. u have an excellent point. I believe the world would be so much better. escpecially for the celebs bc if they ahev a bad hair day or break up with their bf/gf its all over the news and there r so many rumors that arent even true. It really stresses people out. But yesh it would be interesting to be followed around all the time. But after a few months you'd be pulling your hair out!!!!

AA11185226	Most times when someone asks a question like that, they are looking for re-assurance.

YD29jHPvaa	So far there has been no actual announcement that there is going to be an American live action remake of Death Note, much less actors/ actresses names being released. Everything is just a rumor, but who knows, anything can happen. <br>  Personally, I don't know if Zac Efron could be a DECENT Light. From the movies he's been in so far it's obvious he has no experience in this kind of role. (Pretty much the exact opposite if you ask me.) But let's face it his face is a dead ringer for Light's so if he has some hidden cards up his sleeve then he might be able to do it, I just don't think he has those 'cards' . If I were in charge I wouldn't take any chances. It only takes one bad actor to make or brake a movie ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S THE STAR. And besides, no one wants to walk into a movie theater to watch Death Note and find a bunch of High School Musical fans wailing over how there beloved 'Zacy' has become a mass murderer.<br>  <br>  So I guess what I'm trying to say here is no one can say for sure.|`|T2vZu6F2aa	too bad it is true....i noe wat u mean i want 2 kill myself...no wait i want 2 kill the actor because he can't just make a perfect light like the japanese one and oh god i do not want 2 see whoever is playing L in the english one......|`|b10c5828972384201aa770b9f00357b7aa	omg I hope not<br>  lol Zac would look stupid if he had the evil look of Light.....<br>  he's always smiling and it'd be horrible if they make him Light >.>|`|uxVIlXlvaa	what?<br>  i have just lost all hope and faith in mankind.|`|0XknsE3waa	I'm not even much of a Deathnote fan, but I can understand your pain.<br>  <br>  A couple of years ago there was talk of a live action Neon Genesis Evangelion starring... Daniel Radcliffe as Shinji... ugh...<br>  <br>  *vomits uncontrollably*<br>  <br>  So yeah... I understand how lame it is for Deathnote fans right now...|`|T1qvc4HWaa	I really hate to say it, but Zac does look a lot like Light. I just hope he can pull it off, it doesnt seem like he could pull off the crazyness.|`|8LEnEZ87aa	I would slam the producers face into the sidewalk after clawing his eyes out.|`|EYKc8VCfaa	omg no way thats impossible zac isnt crazy enoughe hes toooo good lol|`|CmPNcPnZaa	NO!!...who told you that? o_O;;|`|4d3Md9pnaa	If he is, he can't do Light's crazy face<br>  Nor his laugh.<br>  So the movie will horribly fail.|`|Cj2uorAeaa	oh dear god i hope not

WjuSuKjoaa	I think it would be funny to have Spinelli and Sam open a detective agency, they'd finally have a little comedy on the show (since they've killed off almost all the Quartermaines!).  I've often wondered about a Mac & Alexis pairing.  They work together occasionally, and they could both use some air time.  I think its about time Alexis found a nice guy.  Can you imagine Sonny's reaction to Kristina being Mac's stepdaughter?????|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	I read on a gh blog that Spin and Sam will be PI's and working together. Also apparently Dante is coming town soon (I know that's been going around for months now...), so hopefully Olivia will have a better storyline. I thought she and Mac would be a cute couple too.  Other storylines which might be interesting:<br>  <br>  Mikey waking from the coma...aged to about 18, disowning Carly and Sonny and wanting to be a Quartermaine living with Monica, Edward, and Tracy. <br>  <br>  Rebecca and Lucky hitting it off and becoming involved making Nic crazy jealous.  Lucky tells Nic...Man, she's not Emily...she doesn't love you! Get over it!"<br>  <br>  I read that Kristina is going to be aged to about 15 or 16 and a total brat. That should be interesting.<br>  <br>  And Matt needs a decent storyline....give him a girlfriend like Lainey or Matt needs to be gay and falls in love with Dante or bring back Lucas.<br>  <br>  GH is pretty good so far this year. I hope they keep us entertained!|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I want to see Maxie and Spinelli finally get together and not just one crazy night in bed.

That is the type of work that suits Sam the very best and she is great at it. Olivia and Mac....maybe, but I still am not sold on her staying in Port Charles but if it would give Mac a much deserved story I am all for it!|`|AA12315431	That would be great to see Spin and Sam working together. After this whole thing with the FBI is over, Jason is not going to let Spinelli do anymore hacking for the mob so Spinelli will have to think of something else to do anyway.<br>  As for Mac and Olivia, I doubt that will ever happen. I don't think the writer's are ever going to give Mac a love life again. I guess he was brought in for Felicia and that's it. poor guy. He needs some lovin' too.|`|M1ymLE9Paa	I would love to see Sam and Spinelli work together.  Spinelli is book smart, and Sam has street smarts, so they would make a great duo.  Plus it would take Spinelli away from a life of crime.  =)<br>  <br>  I'd like to see Mac have a love interest again.  Olivia would be a fun choice.  It would make Sonny's head spin to see her w/a cop, and since she doesn't want to be a bad boy, Mac would be a good choice.  <br>  <br>  I also hope Rebecca turns out to be Emily, and that somehow, it brings Helena back to the canvas. I hope that Maxie and Spinelli end up as a ccouple.  I hope Ethan turns out to be related to Robin, somehow.  I'd like to see a Ethan/Lulu/Johnny triangle.  It could be interesting.  I'd like Claudia to hire a hit on Kate (but that's probably just me, lol).  And I love all the Jax/Carly stuff.  But I still hope that Michael wakes up and that it draws Carly and Sonny closer together.|`|4ctvWVWpaa	I think GH needs to go back to when it was good, the late 70's through the early 90's.  For the past 10 years or so, GH has been heavily focused on the mob and mob stories (I've said this before in other posts).  I hate what they've done to the characters of Anna Devane and Felicia when they brought them back recently.  Anna used to be tough, she had a backbone, but when they brought her back for the Eli Love story last year?, she was a simpering idiot!  Felicia, although she did abondon her girls to go globetrotting with Frisco (what the heck was THAT about anyway???) she deserved more of a storyline.  GH was better when it had Luke and Laura, Robert and Anna, Tony Jones, Bobbie, the Quartermaines, etc.|`|ADBMrG87aa	I'd love to see Spinellie and Sam become private investigators working together, they'd be a great team.  I have to agree that Olivia should get a better storyline but not be Mac's love interest.  I'm thinking she should become Sonny's love interest and make Kate jump out of a window and drive Claudia nuts.<br>  <br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|7XM4QJiuaa	Olivia and Mac, that'd be great! I want a new storyline with Helena, she's been gone forever.
h1yGVkkfaa	Dude you have too see it.It was well done and it show's how other countries give there take on METAL music.Sam dunn is awsome,Speaks very clean and give's lots of detail in a short time.

lBJagGMxaa	I know what you are going through, I was there once too!  Have you taken classes in all of those areas?  You need to find something that really interests you.  I am in marketing right now and it is a good life, but you miss that "feel good" feeling that you would get from psychology or psychiatry.  You could go into business and then afterwords on law.  I would have to say don't go for fashion merchandising, unless it is your PASSION.  It is very limiting and not many people make very good money at it.<br>  <br>  In the end, follow your heart and remember, employers want to see that you are capable of graduating from college, not necessarily what you studied.
HCHqzkQraa	I would become an department manager, <br>  in the business of mental health. Too many people out there dressed wrong, makes more people depressed, and anxiety ridden.<br>  <br>  Just kidding, you need to take more basic classes and decide, by studying, what your interests are. But don't forget, studying is easier when you are younger.<br>  <br>  <br>  Clothing and accessories do have psychological results on who sees the wearer as well as the purchaser. These items define who one is. Knowing business, can give you an understanding of marketing your designs.<br>  Knowing legalities on designs, logos, and just how you are going to invest money, is in general good for any designer.|`|uC55n3HIaa	Well, If you like fashion design I would suggest you to check out <a href="http://www.designerbloc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.designerbloc.com/</a> It's a community for aspiring fashion designers to display their designs, get community feedback, and meet other designers. If you're talking about a job that would last in a recession, lawyers will never go away. If you passion is fashion however. I would say go for it! Good luck!|`|WNfffzGiaa	Wow.

They just stole the ships concepts.

e12a1f2ed505be8021ede0df33b7238faa	One word: Percocet<br>  <br>  They knocked me out when I got all four of mine removed.  I woke up mid-way through the procedure but was still numb, so I felt nothing, just tugging.  Your cheeks will swell and will be sore (especially if you don't take the meds they give you).  I was fortunate, mine didn't swell too much, but they were a little sore, even with meds.  After the first night I took a percocet and went to bed.  I didn't fall asleep right away and soon realized that I was telling myself to breath, so I stopped taking the pain pills after that.<br>  <br>  Oh, and don't use a straw or make any sucking motions for a while.

4hnMSeotaa	Because of the emails I saw online between Melissa and Jason the Jerkface (as well as her awful acting) , I am convinced Molly was cheating with Jason the whole time which is why he and Melissa didn't work out. It is obvious she wanted to win and would do anything to get what she wants including being a slut!<br>  <br>  As soon as Molly realizes that getting involved with a man with a kid, she will NEVER have the chance to be #1 in his life, she'll leave, believe it!<br>  <br>  good on ya Molly, you got what you deserve, a lying, cheating, couldn't commit to one person if it killed him, self-centered, egotistical, low class JERK<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. Deanna, you didn't make the wrong choice, even though your choice didn't work, look at the bullet you dodged!!|`|Ukgl64pSaa	I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY EVERYONE THINKS MELISSA IS OH SO PERFECT.  UNLESS YOU KNOW HER PERSONALLY YOU HAVE NO IDEA.  SHE OBVIOUSLY WASN'T WHAT HE WANTED - WHY????????????????? GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT.  ALSO I DON'T THINK HE WAS DISCUSSING WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH TY.  TY IS ONLY 4 YEARS, HE REALLY DOESN'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS ALL ABOUT.  REMEMBER LOVE IS BLIND|`|VO58huGvaa	I agree with one of the people onhere that Molly did plant a seed in his head. If he even thought it may not work or even believed her he should have said no to Melissa, Like she said i wish you would have just let me go that day. I felt so bad for melissa!|`|gOsjK6eEaa	It depends on how people think and what they expect.<br>  I always liked Molly on the show and thot she was more "a regular person" than most.  She seemed sincere.<br>  They seemed to have easy, relaxed dates and conversations.<br>  OTOH, I did not like Melissa - that Dallas type, with a Shi-Tdzu  hairdo (a band to make a little pony poof at top! ick!)<br>  and cutesy talk; she seemed fake to me.<br>  <br>  Then again, I thot Deanna was for real too....<br>  and I thot she made a mistake when she picked Jesse (nothing against him, but I couldn't imagine her in that lifestyle).<br>  <br>  The people who say this is a totally artificial way of meeting and dating must be right.  Maybe they put too much pressure on the person to choose.<br>  Supposedly, they are not under obligation to propose...<br>  It would be better if the bachelor/ bachelorette was allowed at the end to pick the person he/ she MOST wanted to know better, and give it a shot...<br>  rather than promising committment.<br>  <br>  Also, it seems like this season more than any other was overly dramatic and emotions at time forced and fake.<br>  I didn't buy the anguised looks, gestures of Jason esp in the last show.<br>  <br>  It's still amusing - but I can't buy it as a reality show anymore.<br>  <br>  P.S. I didn't see the show where Deanna showed up, but what was that jacket about?  Could she be pregnant?|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	I don't dislike her, but she was too easy on him on After the Final Rose, she should have told him off, instead of looking at him like a puppy dog.|`|F93FZyo1aa	i dont know anyone who didnt like her. shes way more mature than Melissa and i think will be a better match for him. im glad he changed his mind!|`|wy9rgMGsaa	She was just very ackward and uncomfortable looking, and she shouldnt of let jason have her back, have some self respect, no guy is worth sitting around 6 weeks and crying over, and waiting for! He took you second to another girl! No girl should settle for that!|`|8kbS2EU3aa	because they originally wanted melissa to win, because she is cute, sweet and not slutty acting. and since jason did that to melissa, that makes them mad and hate molly|`|ownoc1ZJaa	Molly doesn't have a personality to me.  The entire season went by and I don't feel like the watching audience knows her any better then when she first was introduced.  Plus, I saw no connection between her and Jason - other then physical.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I don't know. I thought she was ok. Maybe its cuz people think that she seems a little stuck up. but I liked her well enough. I think her and jason are probably good together. I always sensed that they had the biggest connection.|`|6pdwd3PZaa	because she looks too rigid with no emotion. Because she was dumb enough to take the dweeb back...and because she is not that pretty. only has pretty eyes and that is it.|`|AA12334405	Well i do.....i liked mellissa more...i felt soooooooo bad for her,nobody deserves that...and molly couldn't of cared less about what she went through!|`|AU1mqWfJaa	She's a Ho ....Slept with Jason on their fist date - and then took the jerk back after he dumped her ...|`|V7iDTULQaa	Because she comes off as fake! She is too pretty!|`|1yicvU9Jaa	Because she planted the seed of doubt in Jason's head that Melissa was going to hurt him, so he thought there was more to it, like she knew something he didn't.  And he was already scared of getting hurt...so it festered.|`|GH6LwSQbaa	because she's the right choice right type she was everything to him!|`|E7zCS7qBaa	shes obviously a home-wrecker

They don't have much staff and unless you brought it to them they would never know. This is a daily paper for a 3 county area of perhaps 300,000 people, But when you get the paper in the morning they don't cover local stuff. I stopped taking the paper.

UzdP8Uziaa	he does inhale, infact when he inhales youll notice a wind sound that mixes with the growl,ive done enough recording to tell you the when you growl and you use your real voice, its very easy for a mic to clip and i asure you if you do it the right way theres no windy sound behind it, bu t in the end if it sounds good, go for it!|`|zH1QoTkWaa	I think it is a light  "chorus" effect because you can hear him inhale sometimes before singing...which should be an exhale if he were practicing "inward singing".

I'm perfect the way I am.|`|pHteEAF8aa	no|`|8PQ1utAKaa	never, it would just be a waste of money.|`|adLSRFrZaa	I don't see anything wrong with minor plastic surgery - where no one can tell that you had it.  I lived in LA for a while, and I did feel sorry for the many people I saw where it was obvious they had it.  The way that I see it is: If it makes you look better, and no one can tell that you had the surgery, then I don't see anything wrong with it.  Minor cosmetic surgery to fix certain flaws seems harmless to me, and can even enhance your life.  <br>  <br>  At 31 years old, I've grown completely comfortable with myself, including my appearance.  I no longer feel I have to measure up to some impossible ideal.  I do try to look as best as I can everyday.  I probably would never get plastic surgery.|`|hCG4HXEZaa	no i think it is wrong too change your body <br>  you should be proud of your body<br>  with the exceptions of ski graphs <br>  and plastic surgery after chemotherepy to women who have breast cancer<br>  if the persons confidence is really flattened|`|drfwOQNIaa	no.<br>  too many things go wrong. or can go wrong. <br>  i'm satisfied with my body and my face.<br>  my parents also have really nice skin and don't have wrinkles. my mom looks 10 years younger than her age... hopefully that's how i'll be|`|Ep8h3MFnaa	Yes I would.

ffzIqHgraa	Spreading rumors or putting words in my mouth|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	What bothers me most about life is aging. I think it sucks to have to grow old. I remember being 16 and almost crying that I hated being a kid and couldn't wait until I was grown, just to wake up one day 32 almost crying that I wish I could be 16 again.|`|xHc3KGDmaa	people that make fun of me because I have bad eyesight<br>  not having a girlfriend|`|0qSpreVyaa	What annoys me most is when people can't solve problems by calmly talking things out. When they "MUST" resort to violence. This is unnecessary and completely pathetic. We are supposed to be civilized and yet we are killing thousands upon millions over personal religious beliefs! Personal political beliefs! (Oh... yeah... and wouldn't it be ironic if the atheists were right? If all this fighting is over... literally... nothing, because there is no God? Now that would be one ironic twisted situation... wouldn't it?)<br>  <br>  As you probably can tell... i'm a pacifist.

So lay low, & BE-ware !!!   :)|`|076b9d27ad5d5f819b3da4ba342506eaaa	No. Music is entirely subjective. People have the same right to hate the Beatles as much as the next guy can hate any other group.|`|nYqtw9DWaa	I love the Beatles but everyone is entitled to their own opinion.. but it really annoys me when people don't at least acknowledge how they changed music or when they say "they're old" and stuff like that.<br>  And also what Kade said, I've never rolled one up in my life and still enjoy them.|`|Mx11gL67aa	I dont see how anyone with ears could hate them, but that's just me.|`|7914f974f3cd0a96cc6883956102da35aa	Well if it is, I'm a sinner|`|zHML9mZXaa	This will bring about a lot of debate.<br>  I am a huge Beatles fan, but you can't get angry at someone for not liking  them. People have different tastes in music, and the Beatles may just not appeal to you. In my OWN opinion they are a great band who made a great difference. Now, I don't think it is a "sin" to hate the Beatles, but there are a lot of Beatles fans in the world. You can look at the Beatles in two different ways, the band, or the group that changed  a lot of peoples lives, and started a lot of trends in the sixties.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Meh. I love the Beatles, but people have a right to their own musical tastes. <br>  <br>  I would only get annoyed with someone for not liking the Beatles if they (1) never gave the music a chance or (2) didn't appreciate the enormous influence the Beatles had on popular music. I mean, I don't really care for Nirvana, but I'll still acknowledge how big of an impact they had on musical culture.<br>  <br>  Kade ... the Beatles were British, dear. And I've never "rolled one up" in my life, but I still love their music to death.|`|k7jGZydJaa	Nope. My mom hates the Beatles and she's into a bunch of Biblical stuff (currently studying it at school), and I haven't read anything about hating them so far either. I also don't like them much. Also, my dad HATES Pink Floyd. That would be an ever bigger sin, right?|`|Vu4A83dyaa	Yes, I'm not saying you have to love them. But "hate" is too far. Hate would be better put in a question like :Is it basically a primordial sin to ___the Jonas Brothers.<br>  <br>  My answer for that would be NOT AT ALL!|`|go1jIgbwaa	Not really.<br>  It just depends if you like them or not.<br>  I don't care for their music because it's just... annoying. I understand they're one of the greatest rock bands in America's history, but their music is just... pointless and the only way you can enjoy it is if you're rolling one up.|`|wO5FP6Mqaa	No, but even if you don't enjoy their music you owe them a huge amount of respect for the overwhelming influence they've had on music.|`|dFacbjIZaa	It was when I first came to R&P two years ago, now Beatle bashing seems to be the unofficial R&P pastime, You'll fit right in.|`|gMaeE2vAaa	well... lets just say without them... we NEVER would have had the music we do today... so... ill let you decide|`|i5YJBqnZaa	Is it a primordial sin? No. <br>  Would rock music have evolved the way it did without them? No. <br>  Has any artist had the same impact? No.<br>  If you don't care for their music that's a individual choice and it should be respected. However, they were and still are a group that has influenced a large number of musicians in all types of music.|`|kwwb62qBaa	Its ok to hate the music for your own personal tastes, but as someone else said, they were the inspiration for alot of other bands that are rockin our asses good now, so give them props for that at least.|`|eEoeURDHaa	Nah, I only like the early stuff, anything around the White Album and Revolver kinda kill them for me.|`|K4lRi1fjaa	G'day Do it harder,<br>  <br>  Thank you for your question.<br>  <br>  No. Different strokes for different folks.

But what does the creator of the show have<br>  to say about it?...<br>  <br>  Oprah asked Agnes Nixon that question when she had a bunch of them <br>  on a special commemorating the 20th Anniversary special back in <br>  January of 1990...Agnes Nixon replied:<br>  <br>  "All My Children refers to the Brotherhood of Man (MY is God). <br>  You are All MY Children". <br>  <br>  The Great and the Least,<br>  The Rich and the Poor,<br>  The Weak and the Strong,<br>  In Sickness and in Health,<br>  In Joy and Sorrow,<br>  In Tragedy and Triumph,<br>  You are All My Children<br>  <br>  Agnes Nixon wrote this at the beginning of the first episode but <br>  unfortunately it never aired.|`|p5cYEPASaa	I don't know...good question...does the main charecter have lots of kids and interact with them in the soap? It's only really ever on when I'm in school or asleep...so I've never really watched it.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Because they were all her children!|`|AA11369432	I guess She was thinking  about her own at the time.

My goodness she is DUMB to sign that pre nup without reading it!!!!!!!!!!!|`|WjuSuKjoaa	She married Adam, Tad and now David.  She had Babe with David after a one night stand when David was in college.  She has Jenny with Tad (although she originally thought it was Adam's baby and they were calling her Charlotte).|`|Zss0O9tjaa	3 pitiful times. Adam & David can keep her. Tad deserves better. I just can't wait for David to blow her out of the water so we can all say I told you so.|`|AA11202477	Three husbands (Adam, Tad & Dr. Demon of Death), and two children, Babe and Jenny.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	As far as we know Adam , Tad and David but we don't know a whole lot about her past, we assume she hasnt been married but with her, who knows!
akcGfgdcaa	That was the end I'm afraid. <br>  <br>  According to Wiki:<br>  <br>  In May 2005, Damon Wayans decided to cancel the show, one day before its season five finale. The series didn't get a proper finale leaving the show with a cliffhanger.

3mJiPveSaa	"Fabulous" is just too ambiguous. You may be bi or gender-confused.

I don't think that a one time offence is anything to worry about, but watch out for flag words such as these:<br>  <br>  Super, fabulous, beautiful, saying abbreviations (such as saying OMG instead of oh my god, or LOL instead of laughing.), stupendous.<br>  <br>  Also avoid talking too deeply about things such as clothes, movies (except for comedy and action) , songs, or Tv shows.<br>           One last thing to avoid is talking about soap operas, and reality television.<br>  <br>  I dont think that you're gay just for saying fabulous, though.|`|zM0ag4NLaa	it seems to be very posible...|`|GQRs83Haaa	Well obviously you're not comfortable in your sexuality or else you would be able to answer that yourself.<br>  <br>  No your not just by using that word! <br>  <br>  But maybe you are!<br>  <br>  What were you calling fabulous, a guy, his a**, your a**?<br>  <br>  I love gay guys who like have that voice and talk all like "fabulous". I wish my gay uncle was more like that, haha!!!<br>  <br>  But seriously, I doubt it, unless you find men attractive and you desire to be with one!|`|AA11185226	Depends, did you use "Jazz Hands"?|`|R6YQOKitaa	how cute|`|16827288a6ef61faf9d2e2c99f7102edaa	well maybe. u didn't use any hand gestures with it did u?|`|kqObJIMxaa	No, unless you add it with some hand movement, unknowingly|`|4e11GJVZaa	No, you're just curious|`|tS0hNQ8Waa	Flamer!|`|KFaGtMOBaa	That depends. How did you use it?<br>  "These hip huggers make my asss look faaabulous!"|`|J7pIy1LWaa	Yep you sure are.|`|WRrkPGUoaa	maybe just a little, its suppressed let it come out!
gEkLQWF4aa	I always cry. But then again, I'm very emotional. The stories these people have are so heartbreaking, and to see them living in the conditions they do, and still be such great people...and then for them to be given something they so deserve..it's hard not to cry. Sometimes I skip over the parts where they talk about their family and their hardships because it's so hard for me to watch without crying.|`|0ixo6bkdaa	I can do it without like tears dripping down my face, but most of the time my eyes get a little watery! **TEARS OF JOY!**|`|oDGttkmLaa	Pffft..yeah. I'm a coldheartedbitch.<br>  My husband can't though. <br>  I hate that show btw..|`|qxteTM9Kaa	No!|`|eTOrwG1Maa	the producers seriously hope that you can't|`|8a262a9c5496ee057e063ab90852f0c4aa	Is that the one with the guy who looks like he stuck his finger in a light socket? Yeah, his hair always makes me bawl.|`|niZBsn9Qaa	of course,<br>  <br>  and i tell you what, i'm tired of everyone always yelling "OH MY GOOOD"<br>  <br>  cant they say "woohoo" or "yay for me"..<br>  <br>  no<br>  <br>  its always<br>  <br>  OH MY GOOOOD. waaaaaaaaa<br>  <br>  sigh|`|0BokF6ceaa	I have a few times|`|z74wSbQoaa	Nope|`|F6YREXRAaa	yes just dont watch! lol jk but yes i can its not that hard...|`|fWclxi9Baa	im a dude i dont watch those type of shows|`|wGjvx0Z9aa	I despise that show.  I'd probably cry just from being forced to watch it.|`|2M4pqLUdaa	I think the better question would have been "Can anyone out there get through an etire episode of 'Extreme Makeover: Home Edition' without falling asleep?".|`|m8wMKhOoaa	no i always start to cry, because its just so sad that these people live like they do and then its happy because they get a house that they could never imagine owning. love that show<3|`|p7yaM0qiaa	without a doubt! i dont even have the slightest pinprick of a glimmer of a tear.|`|2r6ZJz13aa	me|`|EGayjnI6aa	i can|`|MZtCOKqvaa	i can|`|r2T7A9zFaa	I can.|`|4ncmDzdjaa	yes!!!11<br>  i hate that show!<br>  its great that there doing stuff like that but the show is really boring.  they need more explosions :)
Klw3Ke3Haa	Dragonball Z and early digimon series perhaps.|`|P9RlLQH4aa	Sailor moon & Dragon ball are all that comes to mind.|`|55V5cJoNaa	NARUTO!!!!! and Rurouni Kenshin

6qDhXpWfaa	The end of the anime, the part where tohru goes to see akito, doesn't happen in the manga. The best place to start is after kyou says goodbye to his shissou, which is chapter 34, so start on chapter 35. Also, some parts of the anime happen after chapter 35, so you might get some repeats, but you'll be confused if you skip them...<br>  <br>  Read here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/read/10/fruits_basket/chapter.7503/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/read/...</a>|`|k6fFOQ2vaa	the ending of the anime is slightly diffrent from what happens in the manga. they anime also cut some parts out. I belive the anime was from book 1-8 but you may want to skim through them to see if you missed anything. if you don't care then start from book 8 or 9.

MyESqHb9aa	Yeah, I just read that too. I thought it was pretty epic.<br>  <br>  If you ask me, I don't think Hinata dies. I was reading through some forums, and saw one post that pretty much summed up how I felt:<br>  <br>  "Hinata did something to Pain........ or maybe Pain didn't manage to kill Hinata. For the exact same reason, love. Pain or may I say Nagato may be in love with Konan and she is still alive. So, maybe he just couldn't kill Hinata for that reason. Maybe Pain has some humanity left in him. Like Haku."<br>  <br>  From this site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mangahelpers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=46689" rel="nofollow">http://mangahelpers.com/forums/showthrea...</a><br>  <br>  Well, that's how I fell about it. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.|`|x2ApN3MMaa	I hate to say it, but there is a possibility that Hinata might die in this battle, but then again, miracles do happen in stories.<br>  This is how a story goes, it gives you hints that you can miss, when she said: "So I'm not afraid to die protecting you!" Which means that the artist was trying to give us a reason why she would die, or maybe the artist tried to show us how strong her love is towards Naruto. Plus, Sakura is the heroine, so the  artist might have wanted that Hinata would die and Sakura would take her place, since in early chapters of Naruto Shippuden Sakura was slowly falling for Naruto her self. Now Hinata is a popular character, and this is a adventure story, not romance. but still, who knows what the artist is planning next ;)|`|2DKRF3qoaa	Yeah, she confess whats in her heart, Pain is an bad guy and also, he may killed her... but Hinata would not be dead if by someone by the name of Sakura. You know that Hinata and Sakura don't see eye to eye with many things and now, she (Sakura) will help Hinata out so, she can have Naruto picked who he wants to be with,|`|Sjw8NxxUaa	Well it amazed me....<br>  first Hinata confessed her love.<br>  then BOOM! Naruto 6 tails.<br>  <br>  ill say this, what if hinata dies. and kakashi survives. or they both die.<br>  remember when jiraiya died and naruto was all criying and stuff. this he might really know real pain.<br>  i dont think hinata will die ,but what will happen when pain dies and hinata and naruto what? what after that? <br>  they get married?<br>  they have kids? wtf?!<br>  <br>  listen she HAVES to die.<br>  and then naruto will want to train more and kill the whole akatsuki.<br>  yea yea yea.|`|FpKKdPDIaa	Ok, first, it's page 12 that she confesses and page 13 that she "dies". I don't think that she actually dies now, Pein just wanted Naruto to think that she was dead so that he would attack him. If she is dead though, I'm going to be SOOOOOOOOO P!$$ED|`|BwMfuTNLaa	GET IT NARUTO!!! lol naruto needs to claim his new boo!!! but nawww she aint dead she just looked knocked out and did pain even stab her?? it looked to me as it he just used that jutsu shinra tensi to lyke knock hea down on the ground.|`|Ev6IDr37aa	dude she is the main character and over 100,000 <br>  thousand people have begged for this and they kill <br>  her they while definitely stop viewing|`|FNy1PNOXaa	She might be dead...Pain wanted to show Naruto loss, for him to feel true pain. But I hope she survived in a miracle kind of way...the same way I feel about Kakashi lol|`|OiEUFA01aa	no i didnt think she got killed. just hurt.<br>  im not a hinata fan. (sakura!)<br>  *spoiler<br>  naruto finally comes to when he turns into a 6tail fox|`|g2dhtFHPaa	man imagine the look on nejis face when he gets back to konoha.|`|X45rxI7gaa	No, she can't be dead, Pain is not the guy to kill someone like Hinata, she stands no chance so why kill her? She's like NO THREAT to him so he has no reason to kill her even for interfering.<br>  <br>  But that was an amazing moment when she confessed, the most memorable moment in Naruto! Hinata was always #1 anime girl on my list but now the gap is farther away from #2|`|ehF2XiMbaa	OMG YES. Ive answered os many questions about this (and even made one) I'm not even bothering to think much. It could be denial but I don't think shes dead. Kishi just cant keep killing people off like that. Especially most loved characters like Kakashi and Hinata (My personal favorites). She better live! It was the best chapter EVER!|`|35aa6dcf3de4ecb9aa30d3c58ec123edaa	No i don't think she's dead they never showed which part of Hinata's body did Pain stabbed mabye her arm or leg and besides Kishimoto wouldn't get rid of a very popular character and she's apart of the Konoha 11 which are the main characters of the story.<br>  <br>  Killing off Jiraiya was ok i just let it go he was famous but not one of the top characters, i didn't really bother about Shizune but Kakashi better survive.|`|oRiBiFhBaa	hinata didn't really die but she is revived by either Neji or Sakura <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  NARUTO ROCKS!!!|`|HPqqgtOSaa	No she isn't dead Pain probably just stabbed her limbs just like how he stabbed Naruto with his chakra blades.|`|dpAD1KoEaa	I beleave you.. and no she's not dead... if she was he would be too. because me or naruto would take his head and mount it on one of our wall's.

Then she said, "Oh! Thank GOD, I had my mouth open or that would've hit me right in the face!" <br>  <br>  One time a blonde was pulled over for speeding and it turns out that the cop was a blonde too.  The cop asks to see her license, and the blonde asks "What's that?" and the cop tells her, it's a square thing with her picture on it.  So the blonde looks in her purse and hands a mirror to the cop.  The cop then says 'Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were a cop too."<br>  <br>  What goes Vroom! Screech! Vroom! Screech! Vrooom!

She jumps out of her car, runs up to his truck, and knocks on the door. The trucker lowers the window, and she says "Hi, my name is Heather and you are losing some of your load."<br>  The trucker ignores her and proceeds down the street. When the truck stops for another red light, the girl catches up again. She jumps out of her car, runs up and knocks on the door. <br>  Again, the trucker lowers the window. As if they've never spoken, the blonde says brightly,<br>  "Hi my name is Heather, and you are losing some of your load!" Shaking his head, the trucker ignores her again and continues down the street.<br>  At the third red light, the same thing happens again. All out of breath, the blonde gets out of her car, runs up, knocks on the truck door. The trucker rolls down the window. Again she says <br>  "Hi, my name is Heather, and you are losing some of your load!"<br>  When the light turns green the trucker revs up and races to the next light. When he stops this time, he hurriedly gets out of the truck, and runs back to the blonde. He knocks on her window, and after she lowers it, he says... "Hi, my name is Kevin, it's winter in Pennsylvania and I'm driving the SALT TRUCK!"|`|hkUzSsRZaa	A blonde once texted me and asked ''what does idk mean'' i repleyed ''i don't know'' she replyed ''like omg! like nobody knows!!!''|`|4f8d8369ef1509758bf98e8adc3d5af2aa	why do blondes like sun roofs?<br>  <br>  more leg room<br>  <br>  what does a blonde do when she wakes up in the morning?<br>  <br>  goes home|`|zuBjAmilaa	ok haha<br>  <br>  a blonde walks into a library and goes upto the front desk and tells the librarian " I'll have two double cheese burgers". the librarian leans over and whispers to her, "but this is a library". the blonde looks around for a second and says to the librarian (in a whispering voice) "oh sorry..i'll have two double cheese burgers".<br>  <br>  HAHAHA so classic|`|K4bJgTF4aa	1) how do you drown a blonde? put a mirror (or sniff and scratch) at the bottom of the pool<br>  2) what do you call a blonde with a brain? a golden retriever <br>  3) why are blonde jokes so short? so men can understand them.|`|p82sIbAAaa	theres this blonde who comes up to this girl and says, "what does<br>  I-D-K mean?" the girl says, "i dont know" "Does any know???"<br>  <br>  keep going on and on and on and on and on.....

PqtUe6mjaa	In most cases the answer is "No". <br>  <br>  What you have to understand is that most bands of these styles originally sign to what are referred to as Under Labels. Really small record labels who cant offer a lot of renumeration. Their job is to sign a band, get them on small tours, enough to build a fanbase. Then that label sells their contract to a major label. That's how small labels make their money. Not from record sales, but by building up, and then selling the band. <br>  <br>  That being said, most bands when they sign a record contract sign to a certain number of what are called "optional periods" usually 5. This means that after the first album, the record company can excerise an "option" to either drop the band, sell the band, or force the band to put out another album...at the same payscale percentage they originally signed for.<br>  <br>  what does this mean?<br>  <br>  It means that if a band signs to an underlabel and agree to a certain percentage, then after their first album is a hit and they end up on a bigger label, they still have no power to renegotiate the terms of their original contract...and because this new label has 5 optional periods left, they can force the band to put out another 5 albums (which can be 5-25 years depending on the terms) at the same percentage they originally signed to. and that's AFTER their cd sales have paid back a predetermined amount of the record company's cost (usually 35%) because you have to remember that a record deal is essentially a loan.<br>  <br>  So...with that in mind..these types of bands, although they can get very rich, usually dont start for quite a while. Of course, depending on how good your entertainment attourney is that you hire to negotiate the terms of your original contract this is not always the case. But most bands cant afford to hire a good entertainment attourney at first because they charge between $200-500/hr. And dont even TRY reading a contract on your own. They're like 15 pages of crazy legal jargen|`|3voM7Gfsaa	Underoath are definitely comfortable. A source tells me that the singer is in the region of 6 figures. I don't know how true this is though.<br>  <br>   I should imagine TDWP are heading that way, as are BMTH.<br>  <br>  Oli Sykes is definitely minted from his clothing line.|`|VWUBtvfMaa	if they are quite popular yeah. im friends with oli from bmth and hes got quite a lot now, but he gets loads from drop dead anyway. they get a lot from touring|`|veeIbyV4aa	None of them are rich.<br>  Most of the money they make is given to their record company and manager.<br>  They just get money form merchendice purchases.<br>  But, if anyone out of those bands was rich, it would be Oli Sykes from Bring Me The Horizon.<br>  He has his own clothing line, so he probably makes some money from that, but probably not enough to be rich.|`|7914f974f3cd0a96cc6883956102da35aa	I wouldn't think so. They're still just starting out, and their record labels get most of the money.

EcTTRWDlaa	The GTO Anime doesn't portray any nudity in a "sexual" manner.  It has plenty of underwear / boxers scenes (helps depict getting "robbed" or being a slob), and several comedy scenes with the "bits" edited / fogged / "elephant'ed" away (you'll know what I mean when you see the show).  <br>  <br>  But if you're asking us for an appropriate age group who should watch GTO, I'd say at least around 14-16 to get most of the joke references.  Though my roommate's cousin watched it at 12 and he loved it, so it just depends on the kids maturity.|`|ivqfhzHXaa	i havne't seen it but it doesn't say anything of the sort on wikipedia<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Teacher_Onizuka" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Teach...</a><br>  i didn't read all of it but u can finish it off if u go on there|`|kBek6QCLaa	the closest you will get to nudity is a butt, nothing to explicit though|`|bvVG3Xnhaa	No it doesn't but it does show people in there underwear sometimes.

Meanwhile two detectives are looking for the killer who did this to them. There are also flashbacks showing how the men got to where they are now. The doctor flashbacks to his job where he was treating a guy with terminal brain cancer with his assistant zeke*. The other guy Adam is a photographer who is following the doctor around and taking pictures of him cheating on his wife. Still in flashback the doctor walks into the parking garage after he breaks things off with his lover and he is knocked unconscious by man wearing a clown mask and that is when the doctors flashback ends. Adam goes back to his apartment to develop pictures of the doctor and the room is completely dark and there are several camera flashes before adam is attacked by the masked entity. In the detective flashback the two detectives find a victim hooked up to a machine that will drill holes in his head. While the detectives try to free the man jigsaw tries to make a run for it. The black detective stops him but when his guard is down jigsaw cuts the black guy's throat with a concealed knife and runs down the hallway. The Asian detective runs after him and shoots him in the back but when the cop goes to get his body he steps on a tripwire that triggers a row of shotguns on the ceiling to go off and they kill the Asian cop. When the cop dies jigsaw gets up and runs away and then it flashes back to the present where the black detective is watching a building he suspects contains jigsaw. Meanwhile the two captives try to free themselves and they almost run out of time when the doctor pretends to shoot Adam. At the same time this happens the black detective gets into the room where the doctor's family is being held and him and jigsaw have a big fight and eventually the cop rips off jigsaw's mask and reveals him to be the doctor's old assistant Zeke. Zeke kills the cop and goes back to kill the doctor's family but his wife kills zeke and runs away with the kid. Back in the bathroom the doctor is desperate and knows he is out of time so he takes the hacksaw he found in the toilet and cuts his foot off to free himself and he crawls out of the room. After that the dead man on the bathroom floor gets up and an entire quick flash of the clues in the movies flash by to reveal that the old man the doctor was treating who had terminal cancer is actually jigsaw and Zeke had a tap of his own that told him what to do to the doctor and Adam. Adam picks up the gun that the doctor shot him with and tries to shoot jigsaw but jigsaw uses a remote in his hand to shock Adam and jigsaw leaves the room and Adam is trapped in the bathroom and that is the end.|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saw_(film)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saw_(film)</a><br>  <br>  You should watch it, it is the best of the series.

He was later discharged, and has been arrested on suspicion of murder.<br>  <br>  Scotland Yard said they did not believe the incident to be gang-related.<br>  <br>  Knife crime has blighted London in recent months.<br>  <br>  Earlier this month, a man was knifed to death on Oxford Street, one of the busiest shopping areas in the country, and 16-year-old Jimmy Mizen died after his throat was slashed after declining to become involved in a fight with a man in a bakery.<br>  <br>  Tributes poured in today for Robert Knox and friends and relatives left bunches of flowers outside the bar, and a stream of messages were posted on social networking Web site Facebook and the International Movie Database Web site.<br>  <br>  Robert's brother Jamie, 17, who was thought to have been the initial target of the attack, said: 'My relationship with Rob was a very strong one. We'd do almost everything together and he just took me everywhere he went. He was just my best friend.'<br>  <br>  Mr Knox's last words to his son were to warn him about the dangers of being caught up in the culture of carrying a weapon.<br>  <br>  "We had a chat about the problems of people carrying knives and steering clear of problematical little areas that you could put yourself into," Britain's Daily Mail newspaper reported.|`|Ew5yJ2z4aa	I never heard anything about that.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	It was just an extra; he was killed coming out of a club, I think.

Naruto is infront of Sasuke because he has learned Sage Mode.<br>  <br>  Tsunade is on this list because she is one of the Sanin. The rest have died, so she is one of the  most experienced and powerful.<br>  <br>  Shikamaru is on the list because I believe he is the smartest, quick minded, clear headed, and brightest ninja in the Fire Country.<br>  <br>  I know there are other very talented and strong ninja in the world of Naruto, but they are either unknown or I forget.<br>  <br>  ^_~|`|U0Ayln9Yaa	if the tailed beasts count<br>  <br>  1 naruto 6 tailed<br>  2 pein<br>  3 naruto 4 tailed<br>  4 curse mark sasuke<br>  5 naruto 1 tailed|`|tSU1BmGtaa	#1 Six-tailed Naruto<br>  #2 Madara<br>  #3 Pain<br>  #4 Tsunade<br>  #5 Sasuke|`|InZzUf67aa	i am

SYkzZtW7aa	The other guys have covered it, but a quick question: what's your instrument?<br>  <br>  Your scales and arpeggios want to be so under-the-fingers that you'd be able to respond in a "flash-card" sort of an environment. Somebody says "Eb melodic minor" or "B blues" and you fire off the required notes. Doesn't mean that you're playing jazz (you're not!) but you're equipping yourself with some of the technical tools ...<br>  <br>  Also – do a whole stack of listening: all eras, all styles, all sizes of band BUT (to fast-track things a bit) you'd probably favour trios and combos (rhythm, 1-3 horns) from the 40's or 50's onwards.<br>  <br>  Play by ear – doesn't matter what style, but get the ears connected to the brain and the brain connected to the fingers. Well, better if your examples are jazz ones, so why not pick a favourite solo on your instrument ... and learn it. You might work better by transcribing it first; either way, you want to know it so well that you can both sing it and play it. DON'T JUST BUY BOOKS OF TRANSCRIBED SOLOS. You'll get more from working out one solo by yourself than from buying truck-loads of solos that someone else has transcribed. Promise!<br>  <br>  Then – read up on the history, so you know who was doing what, when.<br>  <br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>  <br>  Enough rave – keep us up to date. Good luck!<br>  <br>  –––––––––––––––––––––––––––|`|0CQzpukxaa	Hey man-I'm a music major :) A ballad would be something like...My funny Valentine. I would say learn all those scales and memorize them. They will probably pick one or two. All the scales you need to know seemed to be on that second page (which was very nice of them to include-usually they wouldn't include the scales) And the major scales are.... B E A D G C F Bflat Eflat Aflat Dflat and Gflat (aka f sharp) Just look up the circle of fifths. Good Luck.|`|AA10526119	Looking at the audition, it seems you should be prepared to play ALL 12 major scales. The plural for blues scales also implies that you should be able to play the blue scale starting on all 12 notes.<br>  <br>  A ballad is a tune that is usually played at a much slower tempo, a bebop tune is a tune that is written in the style of jazz they played in the "bebop era", so that would be like Confirmation, Ornithology, or Dexterity. A ballad would be like Body and Soul, Misty, and such.<br>  <br>  How much experience do you have playing jazz?|`|AA11546571	I suggest a music theory class in all honesty.

She is so boring. Pretty yes, but the only reason there is even a show about her, is because of her rich parents. Otherwise, this girl would just be a nobody.<br>  <br>  Also I think it is really obnoxious to play that show, when there are so many young people just struggling to get by in this economy. It is a waste of time to watch.<br>  <br>  If your biggest concern in life is who will be the next star of "THE HILLS" then you obviously have a pretty pathetic little life.

4d9935586be55aa85a6c466ef935061faa	February 10, 2009. A friend of Chris Brown reached out to MediaTakeOut.com, offering us this explanation of what happened on Saturday night:<br>  <br>  [Rihanna is] outrageously jealous and insecure. So [Chris] would get into arguments and fights with her. He never hit her once but she'd [allegedly] smack him, bite him and scratch him and once he even got hit in the balls kinda' hard. So [she] got into the habit of hitting him because to her it was fine since he never hit her back.<br>  <br>  [On Saturday night, Chris] finally told her to shut the f*ck up and it's over. So she socked the **** out of him while he was driving and kept on hitting him until he crashed into a parked car.<br>  <br>  [Chris] then got out of the car and tried to pull her out and got hit in the face some more numerous times. Scratched up and everything.<br>  <br>  Simply because he was done with all of the drama. Anyway when she smacked him this last time he smacked her back. So he [left Rihanna there alone].<br>  <br>  Hurt from banging her face on the windshield/dashboard from the car accident [somebody] then called the cops and [Rihanna] told them that [Chris] whipped her ***.<br>  <br>  [Later the next day, Chris] wanted to go get his things from her apt to go to a hotel and saw a million cop cars there.<br>  <br>  So he left and when he sent us to retrieve his stuff, this girl didn't want to let us get his 6 bags of stuff. She said tell him to come get it himself … Tell him to answer his phone and that I'm sorry we can work this out. To which I said, hell no my friend isn't coming anywhere near here. It's too late for all of that. He just wants his luggage and you guys need never to see each other anymore….<br>  <br>  Sh*t happens was definitely in effect and it's crazy how everyone can jump on a woman's side and not know what happened. Hind sight is 20/20 and I told [him that] he should've gotten out of the car and called the cops on her a*s when it was just him with scratches and ****.<br>  <br>  This seems like a very interesting story. Of course we have absolutely no way to know whether it’s true or just damage control.<br>  <br>  It does get a little tricky however. You’ll recall that initially both Rihanna and Chris’ people were claiming that Rihanna was injured in a “traffic accident.” Also, according to TMZ, their Lamborghini was towed from the scene of the alleged assault in Hancock Park to a nearby police impound lot. Could the car have been damaged???<br>  <br>  Developing….<br>  <br>  <br>  and pretty much that has developed is that he has a court date my birthday march 5 but they can't find enough evidence to make it domestic violence ,crimamal threats, or any thing else,and going on rihanna still not going 2 press charges.....and story is still developing|`|bpe8XVWDaa	There is no straight answer but here is some people's theory.<br>  <br>  She gave him an STD and he got really angry and beat her up.<br>  <br>  Another Theory:<br>  He got a text message from a girl she got jealous they got into a fight and things went out of control.|`|iPQqPkhTaa	because he's an *** with self control issues....same as any other abuser.|`|rMF2ghK1aa	probably drunk or something...they were at a party right b4 that happened so that's my theory...|`|0OtwboKfaa	Because he got a text message from a girl and they were going to hookup and Rihanna was still dating him and i guess she got mad and they got in a huge fight. Look i am sorry to all you Chris Brown fans, but, he is a huge *** hole.
GS20sIkMaa	They're not gonna get us by Tatu?|`|L6jKwlyXaa	Here's the tracklist,<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.brianchernicky.com/thickasthievessoundtrack.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.brianchernicky.com/thickasthi...</a>
wLe7nBLGaa	The only place i would think of is the Bravo website...Tamara is such a ***** i hate her
p5ZJfiIaaa	I second what Mokele said.<br>  I think all of BC Jr's love and reverance is reserved just for The Dark Lord, so I don't think he would have any more love to give to anyone else.|`|g54tGcRvaa	The power of love pales in comparison to the majesty of the Dark Lord.  [tongue flick]
71SjVwWNaa	the song YYZ of the live album Exit...stage left is one of the best drum solo's, but listen to any live or studio album from rush and you'lll hear some of the best quality drumming from peart. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa0C5Uxpd3c" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa0C5Uxpd...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  also ask this in the rock and pop section, alot of people will help you, and you'll receive alot more answers, alot of folks in that section love rush and neil peart
h9y1IZA2aa	its instant to come off your card but it takes 7-10 days to go back on your card again, paypal never do things quickly.
ugCaMO3saa	bit-torrent and u-torrent are EXACTLY the same.|`|NIUkYdL2aa	The probably are the same - but I use U-torrent|`|hLQa3VtYaa	Its very similar... its usually better for software and movies.... the difference between bittorrent and limewire is, limewire has a search engine.... for bittorrent you need a torrent program and have to use an online bittorrent search engine. Downlaod BitComet, then check out btjunkie.org ... and check the user comments before loading, make sure its a good file. when you click to download it, choose to open it with Bitcomet.|`|fKcr6KU0aa	uTorrent is, I think, one of the many BitTorrent clients out there.  That is, it's one of the programs you can use to download things through BitTorrent.<br>  <br>  I don't know much about Limewire, I can explain a little for BitTorrent?<br>  <br>  Limewire (I think, correct me if I'm wrong - I only have experience with Napster and WinMX from a long time ago) - you go online and you "share" a folder with stuff in it that other people can download from you.  And other people download this stuff directly from your computer.  And you download from other people the same way.<br>  <br>  BitTorrent - someone shares a file.  The person who shares the file first is "seeding" the torrent.  (There may be more than one person seeding.)  Then people download the file using a BitTorrent client.  WHILE they are downloading, they are also uploading parts of the file to other people!<br>  <br>  This can be really efficient and fast (if a lot of people are connected), since it means that everyone isn't downloading the file from the same person, and the original "seeder" can leave or take a break eventually.<br>  <br>  From my experience, BitTorrent is faster than other filesharing services for popular files, since with Limewire/etc. you are downloading from one person, and they may also be sending files to other people, so their connection speed is split.  With BitTorrent, you are downloading bits of the file from a whole bunch of people at once.  The more people who are connected to the torrent, the faster it is.<br>  <br>  This is also why it's really important to stay connected for a bit after finishing downloading the file...you are helping out other people.  I usually stay connected until I've got at least a 1-1 ratio...i.e., I've shared the equivalent of the whole file with everyone.<br>  <br>  On the other hand...it's harder to find small files on BitTorrent, especially specific songs.  And sometimes torrents don't have seeds, which means you can't get the whole file at all.  (Make sure there's at least one seed!)  And if not very many people are connected, it'll be pretty slow.  (Old BitTorrent trackers are usually very slow.)<br>  <br>  More info on BitTorrent: <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bittorrent.htm" rel="nofollow">http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bittor...</a><br>  <br>  More info on LimeWire: <a href="http://communication.howstuffworks.com/limewire.htm" rel="nofollow">http://communication.howstuffworks.com/l...</a><br>  <br>  Here's the BitTorrent client I use (there are a bunch out there): <a href="http://www.bittornado.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bittornado.com/</a><br>  <br>  Edit: Also, yeah, on regular BitTorrent sites, read the comments to make sure you're not downloading a virus or something.  And check the torrent info to make sure there are seeds, that's really important.<br>  <br>  For anime, I can confirm that the files on this site are okay, virus-wise (I've been using it for years, it only lists files seeded by fansub groups): <a href="http://www.animesuki.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.animesuki.com</a>|`|qkyzbkHdaa	I like limewire better. Utorrent seems more confusing to me but you can download whole albums at once.

NEVER lol<br>  <br>  no long winded creative writing exercise for you today, instead I would offer these thoughts on your selection...<br>  <br>  this performance was so much fun, the wild abandon the screeching noise and the joy that is missing in just about all of the major performers that we worship...<br>  <br>   vicious, terrible noise??? perhaps but a sense of fun and exploration that reminds me of Ornette Coleman at his exploratory finest...<br>  <br>  MARS  FTW<br>  thanks Gibb is there no end to the musical surprises that you spring on us everyday???|`|yjSGVfdiaa	so prog, and yet still incorporating indie, post-hardcore, avant garde and alternative into their sound.  <br>  <br>  I miss seeing Henry Rollins show on IFC.  I find him to be a really intriguing guy - his spoken word is great, and he's intense on stage when he's with Black Flag or Rollins Band.  His energy and intensity is contagious - he makes you just want to grab life and squeeze every last drop out of it.  The Mars Volta's music has the same effect on me.|`|7fEVNng5aa	I always feel the same way when I hear The Mars Volta- if they were strictly an instrumental band they'd be one of my favorites. The music itself is unreal. The vocals *always* kill the songs for me, though. No exception this time. <br>  <br>  The "freak-out" near the beginning was nothing short of incredible.|`|16t0eV0Uaa	I have seen this before, so I will say it straight away and say those are absolutely Astounding songs.

Any real estate agent worth their salt would have enough sense to post a professional looking picture.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to avoid Craigslist for buying any real estate.  Because as we all know, Craigslist is sooo good at protecting us from fakers and scam artists.  ;-)<br>  <br>  This is an area where there are both legitimate and scam postings, so it is just not worth the risk.<br>  <br>  Better to choose other sources......especially if the guy or gal in the picture looks more like something that your dog dragged in from a puddle LOL!|`|wUIJSSJlaa	probably because they are real estate agents on craigslist...it's not really a reputable or profitable thing.|`|fWclxi9Baa	cause its free i would never get anything of real estate from craigslist|`|4FHHuD0daa	Amy Lee would make a good congressman.<br>  <br>  great now I look like a nutjob.

uxVIlXlvaa	kenshin. it made me feel like..idk, more of a win in a loss type of situation. did that make sense at all? the writer was an amazing and powerful one, who knew how to make proper character development. anyone can die in the anime, even the worse of the worst, and you cant help but to feel sorry for them in some way. it was one of the few animes out there where it isnt a two dimensional good vs bad, but one where everyone loses, and realizes.<br>  it paints a different picture of right and wrong, as almost no character in that anime is "good" but is a lesser of two evils. kenshin brings up political issues, and puts in heavy philosophy in the storylines as well. all the characters in the anime (especially the bad guys) have a lot of dept in them. you can relate to so many in some sort of way. some scenes even sent shivers down my spine, which very few animes or any tv show has ever done to me.|`|rjfFD2Voaa	When I first got into anime, I used to be wowed by Naruto, Full Metal Alchemist and Death Note.<br>  <br>  Now, I think my favorite animes that make me happy are Death Note  and Paradise Kiss, though both have ended already.|`|WxV9P9NQaa	hentai|`|I6Eccjnqaa	Yeah,Grave of the Fireflies..|`|tjAb8xPYaa	YES!!!!

I can't wait to see what happens though.|`|eb988d4a87fb23ff04f368e37ac1fbcbaa	i can't stand kimber!!! i wanted matt to b***h slap her! yeah, u could tell christian had a "what do i do now" look on his face... he probably hasn't learned anything and will go back to his old ways... poor liz
Lh4S3q53aa	Not a chance...   The first shot the dealer took while tied to the chair was in the stomach.  Stomach shots are almost always fatal. They say it is one of the most painful ways to die.   The loss of blood by the end of the movie would be more then any body, trained or not, could handle.   As for the two stoners, they didnt take to much of a beating and im sure after a week in the hospital, they would be fine.|`|gr8Y2lgEaa	Jesus no!

I liked a couple of the harder edged songs, and liked the song Wiseblood <br>  <br>  I do like quite abit of industrial so those inlfuences I liked<br>  <br>  BA: I know no one as different as this....so my answer would be some band like Sigh who are quite experimental|`|71SjVwWNaa	i have never heard of him or any of them...but what better thing to do on a raining friday afternoon? i think i'll grab a coffee and start finding out a little bit more about him, i'll edit|`|tlj3c50Haa	I've only ever heard of Foetus, and only heard like two songs.

She has electronic type music, and then the classical violin stuff. But I don't know... I'm probably wrong. ^^;;<br>  <br>  Edit: <br>  I quite liked the first two, but I think they're the type of songs I'll have to listen to a few times to get into.<br>  I loved 'Verklemmt' and 'Take It Outside Godboy'. :D<br>  Can't decide on the Steroid Maximus one... I like it, but the sort of brass stuff really bothers me in songs. I hate the sound of it. <br>  :O 'Ice On The Equator" is gorgeous! I love it! Thank you so much! ^__^<br>  The Wiseblood one was awesome... I'll have to go look up the cover too now... Omg did he just say "moidah"?! :O ^.^ Lol<br>  Don't like the last one... I don't know why, it's just not doing anything for me. XD<br>  But thank you for all that! Haha!

WggRi7MZaa	One night we were at school 'cause we had to get ready for a show that night. My friend Chanice and I were standing outside the gym door and I suggested that we run laps in the gym which I thought was empty. I thought she was going in with me, so I started running around in a huge circle, then I realized there were 3 guys sitting at the side. And then I turned around to see that Chanice wasn't running with me, she had closed the door and walked away.<br>  <br>  So there I am randomly running in the gym by myself, looking like a complete maniac. It was pretty embarrassing.|`|YHcOS0Sfaa	MIne is similar to yours. My friend and i like to fool around a lot so in math class we were "pissed" at each other (not reallly we were joking) and the teacher didnt notice lol. so   she drew on me with highlighter and i drew on her then she drew on my face and i stole her pencil. So she threw my books on the floor (the bell rang at this time) and she threw my pencil case across the room and it hit this kid adam, and when i went to get it she gave my book to a korean who didnt speak english. lol so i threw her book across the room and her papers flew everywhere. and then i ran to my next class. haha i won that round :)|`|BWy46qxCaa	One time, a few months ago, i was leaving early from study hall because i had a game and i didn't realize it but one of the pockets in my backpack was open so my books and stuff fell out and i keep a lot of **** n my backpack.

Z4LmvBJnaa	First of all, not every thing is a musical. and Second of all musicals are a great form of entertainment.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	I absolutely hate musicals!!!!!|`|OXSOch9Oaa	Some people like musicals and music definitely adds to the drama of the moment.  Take Fellowship of the Ring for instance.  Would the scene with the bridge of Kaza Dun been as awesome as it was without the pounding drums in the background?  Definitely not.  I love singing in a movie, something about it just makes me feel wonderful.  However, I love music.  I can't imagine a movie without it in some way.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	I LOVE MUSICALS! Have you tried watching Fiddler on the roof, or Gigi or some older musicals that have more value. You might find that you like them.

kyEPS7xCaa	In what respect?<br>  <br>  Well, acting wise, Tracy was probably one of the most greatest actors of any generation. His roles were wide, and he played characters, the characters weren't him.<br>  <br>  An Actor like that today, I would say could be Gary Oldman.  He isn't the greatest looking guy (either was Tracy), but he brought to the characters a life of their own.  There is no Oldman in the characters.  You can watch 2 different Oldman movies, and not know it was the same actor.

We have concerts, and if you have seats then you don't have to get there early but if they are outside, it is general, and you have to get there like 7 hours before the gates open to get good standing room.

qWzN3i3Uaa	That would be really good for the two of them if he did. Does Billy think that if he wants to marry Chloe that he can just go around sleeping with other women ,and you'd think that Sharon would have learned her lesson the last time seeing that she almost got caught by BOTH of her ex husbands. The girl just doesn't learn does she. Hopefully Billy decides to leave in the morning like he did last time because if they wake up toghter that would be totally akward. They have no excuse now because the weren't drunk like last time. This will just be one of those times when they go home and think to them selves "damn I shouldn't have done that".|`|vEzdsqY3aa	i think sharons gonna get pregnant by billy|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	Nope...you will see tomorrow that it was just another fling and Billy will retreat to his apartment afterward to sleep off another hangover.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	I don't know about kicking Chloe and the baby out, but I do think he will catch Billy and Sharon.

It is as much Billy's as it is Jack's. But I am so tired of Young and the Restless and these trifling story lines.

He can be ruthless but the other week in Sharon's hotel room he was almost pleading with her to come clean with him. When he does find out about his wife and brother he will forgive them eventually. He is going to be Sharon's biggest supporter through all of this.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I hope he does catch Billy and Sharon, but i wouldn't want him to kick Chloe out.

Took me a while to find the flaw too, but if you're interested, it's this:<br>  <br>  When you say 1/3 of 366 days is 122 days, you are ALSO factoring in the weekends and holidays in that calculation, cutting them down by 1/3...and then when you take the weekends and holidays away AGAIN later on, you're removing more of the days than what counts for working.<br>  <br>  The worker needs to counter with, "how many WORKING days are there in a year?" before factoring out the weekends, holidays, and sick pay.

That is why Locke is not currently dead, why he could walk again, why Rose no longer has cancer, why Richard Alpert doesn't age, why Jack's father is alive, etc. <br>  <br>  Follow the link to the best theory about Lost that I've read.|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	I didn't know Charlie lost his ring.

LrKCLZF7aa	Chiron points to the soul mate. I've been trying for a long time to tell people this.<br>  <br>  I am a Sag Gem Sag and my wife is Virgo Taurus Cancer. This is a perfect example of how traditional astrology doesn't work for compatibility. Non of these signs are compatible. <br>  <br>  Chiron rules marriage, family, destiny and true love. It also rules the New Age.<br>  <br>  I have a Jupiter sextile Chiron with my wife. I also have Neptune trine Chiron and Venus parallel Chiron.<br>  <br>  It wasn't till I started studying Magi Astrology that I learned this.

MdrCL60caa	I agree but I think it was more her persona that people found so sexy. She was more known for her sexuality than for beauty and that she had. Audrey Hepburn was beautiful too; but I would never see her as the sex symbol Marilyn Monroe was. And I believe Elizabeth Taylor had a lot more surgeries than anyone in Hollywood during that time period; much as people would deny it.

There was one called Alien Apocalypse, it was a sci-fi channel original so it was straight to tv and dvd, a lame b-movie, but he fits into those so well!  An older movie, McHale's Navy, he was a supporting actor in it, its pretty funny.<br>  <br>  Burn Notice is good, and he's as good as ever in it, I've missed a lot though, I should catch up on that show soon.<br>  <br>  I rarely give thumbs downs, but Jobo, you're asking for it.|`|kyEPS7xCaa	Bruce Campbell is really great.

dRFEQ2jxaa	According to Shaun, its basically a hate love song; he likes a girl that doesn't know he exists:<br>  "Its about a transition between girls in high school, a girl I crushed on but didn’t know I existed, and the most perfect girl in the world who I was attracted to but didn’t want to be cause of fear of rejection" (his words)<br>  <br>  he also says that its about partying, having fun and kissing girls
pLPKo6mBaa	Well, /I/ think they're a good band! They have both a male and a female singer. My favorite song of theirs is "Angel's Punishment", but you should probably check out "Our Truth", "Closer", and "Heaven's A Lie" as well.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd rather go see Lacuna Coil than the other bands you mentioned. :) But everyone's different. Have fun!|`|doVbqo3iaa	look them up and listen to them and decide for yourself! everyone has different tastes and what you like isn't necessarily what someone else is going to like.

hP2nzb2haa	How about a "Camp-Out/Backyard Movie Theatre", it is different and fun. You got movie/screen TV, bonfire, music in the background, foods/snacks/drinks, game of Twister (do it on the patio... grass will make you itch), also how about doing - glow stick limbo contest, neon hula-hoops, hot potato with glow in the dark ball, play flashlight tag with glow sticks and a game called: Categories…This game are fun and require no preparation. To begin, have your guests sit on the floor, forming a circle. Choose one person to be the leader. The leader begins by selecting a category, such as "types of dessert" or "things in a kitchen." He/she then starts a slap-clap-snap rhythm by slapping a knee twice, clapping twice, and snapping his/her fingers twice. Everyone joins in the rhythm. The leader then says one item in the category, such as "ice cream" for the "types of dessert" category. Play continues clockwise, moving to the leader's left, until someone is unable to think of an item, misses the beat, or repeats what someone else already said. When someone misses, that player begins a new category. <br>  <br>  For a more competitive game, any player that misses the beat, can't think of an item, or repeats someone else's response is eliminated. Continue until one player is left and is named the winner.<br>  Be creative and have fun.|`|gsxdwkGVaa	My friends and I had a bonfire every time someone in our group turned sixteen.  Also, we tried places such as Rinkside Sports (ice skating and arcade) or just a big party at the house.  Hope this helps!

vVka4ZA0aa	Obviously Batman. <br>  I'm a big Cassandra Cain fan, I think she's the most interesting and talented Batgirl to date. However, Bruce Wayne is no fool. He has trained nearly all his life, not only with with masters of various fighting styles, but he's even trained with an escape artist so he also has the ability to manuever his bodies in ways that most can't. Also, Bruce Wayne is constantly mentally preparing himself for any possibility, you can't forget that, that's one of the reasons he's so great. Did you read Batman RIP? Dear god, it was wonderful. So, Batman has probably already seen her fight enough to determine the moves she would possibly make. He would anticipate her, even when she's at her best and he's at his worst... Because that's what he does.<br>  <br>  I think she would put up a great battle, but I also think she would succumb to him a lot quicker because she would not be so mentally able to try to defeat the man who has given her a home and a family. However, Bruce Wayne is more detached of emotions and would easily block out any father-like feelings or emotions that he builds with his bat family.|`|fawhiGtsaa	Batman.|`|tiUkVOaKaa	Cassy. Unlike the Joker, Batman has issues with suckerpunching women. Cassy probably has no problem with ball-kicking.

But the funniest part of all of this is the resultant whining and inevitable accusations of the teller's lack of a sense of humor.<br>  <br>  Shouldn't a proper sense of humor include the ability to laugh at jokes made at your own expense - particularly regarding an established stereotype?  <br>  <br>  I mean, I'm not fat or lazy and I don't watch Nascar, but jokes about stereotypical Americans are still funny when told well.|`|h9y1IZA2aa	1.

Sometimes there are caveats but most of the time nope, that's why George Lucas did his own thing with Star Wars, J.K.

Hip-hop is lyrical and makes you think.|`|1qUokeKOaa	hip hop is a life style that comes from rap|`|uqhxfbRIaa	WTF?!?  GTFOH with that "Hip-Hop is a lifestyle" bs! Hip-Hop is not a lifestyle it is a form of music just like rap, Hip-Hop is party rap, Believe it or not Soulja Boy IS true Hip-Hop. If you look at history Hip-Hop was started as dancing music, RAP is the more lyrical music.|`|xb3RjkV2aa	Hip-Hop is where a person is given a mic, and is free to rap whatever they like, no word boundaries or anything.

NQ37mnWkaa	As Prof anger says {and says so well}, there *is* good new / recent stuff out there, but you really do have to search, as you are very unlikely to find it on the radio. A couple of exceptions to that may be Jose Gonzalez and Sandi Thom, but that depends on what sort of radio stations you listen to. <br>  <br>  Interestingly, I find that older music, and new-to-me older music often leads me to the best of the newer stuff ~ usually where you get a cross-reference of 'these guys have been cited as big influences of such-and-such band', or even Amazon's habit of "you bought this, so we recommend...". <br>  <br>  But then there are the more unusual ways of finding bands & artists.<br>  At the end of 2007 I discovered what is now one of my favourite bands, Blackmore's Night {most recent band of classic rocker Ritchie Blackmore, but have a rather unique style} [who started in 1997 and released their 6th studio album last year], through their album art ~ two of their album covers were drawn by an artist I like, Johanna Pieterman, and another by Jim Fitzpatrick, who drew Thin Lizzy's "Black Rose" album.<br>  <br>  sorry, I went a little off topic there...|`|aKBqMLuhaa	Why rehash what has already been done? <br>  There are new bands out there doing some really great stuff but you can't expect the record companies to bring it to you. Seek it out and you'll find what your looking for. Pick up some music mags (not rolling stone, but obscure stuff) and you'll find just about every kind of music is still being made. Its just not supported and promoted by the huge record labels.<br>  BTW: Steely Dan is still putting out new stuff..... Thank God!|`|89xzNpVaaa	You're right, amte.<br>  The Modern type of music IS the Nickelback type.<br>  But those are all mainstream. Listen to bands that are not mainstream, man! And if you need those sounds of those bands, just listen to those bands themselves. I don't listen to music after 1999.<br>  With some bands, but they are old bands.|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	There's plenty of cool stuff, it's just not on the radio. You've just got to do some digging. Personally, I'm not into that stuff either, but my sort of "albums to buy" list is kind of overwhelming. A whole lot of it is from this decade.<br>  <br>  **************<br>  I didn't realize there was a soap box in here... interesting.|`|XO4talxxaa	LOL I agree everyone sounds like Nickleback these days! I want some variety in my music.....|`|URO3gDXcaa	i am sure there are.  but they will not get the radio play they deserve because there is no money in it for the radio stations.|`|AGP2dI6uaa	Good choices there.  You can find stuff that you like, but you can't rely on the radio to play it for you.<br>  <br>  Rick Ocasek (from The Cars) has worked with Weezer.  They haven't been too good lately, but they had some good stuff.  <br>  <br>  Steely Dan is awesome.  There's some crazy new bands like Chromeo that will cite Steely Dan and Hall & Oates, but they don't really sound a whole lot like them.<br>  <br>  Just quit listening to radio PROGRAMS.  Read some music reviews and try stuff that sounds like it would be good to you.|`|qx4F2SJmaa	Because that was then, this is now.<br>  <br>  It's rhetorical, <br>  Kinda like asking, <br>  why aren't there any good paying jobs anymore...or why aren't there good leaders in our gov't anymore....or why is our country, economy, housing, health care, and morals all in the SH*TER?<br>  <br>  Just wondering those things too...but I already know why so I don't waste the points.<br>  <br>  I am surprised you don't, being that you are smart enough to recognize that most everything that was ever good including music, is never coming back, and don't look for it to.|`|M2Cx9uqzaa	there are plenty of bands with unique sounds, they're just not mainstream. all the mainstream crap that gets played on the radio and mtv sucks but there are lots of good, unique bands out there. you just have to find them|`|37qOjwDraa	You're right....<br>  <br>  Some great metal bands like Kreator and Iron Maiden are still as good as before but the bands you mention, you won't here them today! I mean you don't hear their style and sound on today's bands.|`|Ady3YRYzaa	A lot of bands can't make their own style anymore, they all sound like someone else.<br>  <br>  But listen to:<br>  Piano Blink by Hawksley Workman<br>  its pretty different from other stuff.<br>  And i like it alot!|`|oIIiMY5Zaa	Well there are good bands out there.You just have to dig deeper for them. <br>  <br>  It's only the mainstream music of today is crap|`|31cf2a3995a7e000ff27474f546fb219aa	i'm so glad i found someone who thinks the way i do.

fKcr6KU0aa	...that might have been me reccing it, I don't know.  I sometimes do recommend it, because it's the all-time WEIRDEST anime show I've ever seen, and one of the more interesting, too.  If not, yay, someone else likes it, too!<br>  <br>  I like it a whole lot; it's one of my favorites, and I like the symbolism and all of the weird things that go on in the series.  Upside-down castle in the sky!  A dueling arena that only the (powerful) student council knows about!  A girl who wants to be a prince. A rose bride whom everyone is fighting over.  The power to revolutionize the world!  The shadow girls, who are in a weirdness category all their own.<br>  <br>  And I liked how we got to see everyone's psychological issues (especially in the Black Rose arc).<br>  <br>  And though I didn't like ALL of the characters (most of the guys were really uninteresting to me, except for Mikage and Akio), I really liked Utena a lot, and Anthy grew on me over the course of the show (see username).  And Nanami was always a source of fun (animals hate her.  This can be really funny - there was this boxing kangaroo, for one).  And Akio...is a spoiler, so I won't say what I think of him.<br>  <br>  Bad things about the series: it's repetitious in spots.  They use the same couple of minutes of footage right before a duel every time, for instance.  It helps if you *like* the footage, but yeah.<br>  <br>  So, yeah, I think it's good.  It is a matter of taste, though - as I said, it is a really, really weird show.<br>  <br>  Tip: if you do watch it, avoid the movie until you've at least seen the series.  I didn't like the movie very much, it's alternate-universe anyway, and it has a lot of spoilers for the TV series.<br>  <br>  Here are a few good reviews that may help, actually: <br>  <a href="http://www.ex.org/3.7/24-anime_utena.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ex.org/3.7/24-anime_utena.htm...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ex.org/2.8/21-anime_utena.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ex.org/2.8/21-anime_utena.htm...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nihonreview.com/anime/revolutionary-girl-utena/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nihonreview.com/anime/revolut...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nihonreview.com/anime/revolutionary-girl-utena-2/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nihonreview.com/anime/revolut...</a>|`|E2GZlEQEaa	There is no such thing as good anime.|`|ba585f5c7b24c08464a4dcfb6e99495eaa	it not my favorite but it not bad

L39mQJYJaa	Pisces men and women don't like to be judged or to fit into stereotypes and if you repeat what other people has said about him he could assume that you think so too, it shouldn't really be a big deal but he overreacted only because he thought you agreed on what was said! A good thing would be to first tell him that this is not the way I think before he hears the bad things people said about him!<br>  <br>  Not speaking to him wouldn't be the best respons though, he would definitely react negative to that! If you speak with him he'll speak with you, if you don't speak with him he wont speak with you. It's up to you really! And yes Pisceans have a tendency to overeact, every sign's got their difficulties and if you have a big problem with that it will be difficult for you 2 to get along! I'm a pisces too and anyone who works well with me have to be able to understand that sometimes I get a bit crazy, but it goes over in a minute and if you don't take too serious of his emotional reactions, knowing that they will sweap over, there shouldn't be a problem!|`|AWC9OcQ4aa	Oh i know what you mean, im not dating a pieces but my boyfriends brother is a pieces and everytime i call my bf he's always either huffin and puffin or saying dont you know he's sleeping call back later, puhh-lease girl do what you have to do and ignore it there just like that and he's slowing down alittle bit of his attitude but they also realize at somepoint when they see you're caring loving nature they ease up.<br>  <br>  ?virgo/libra|`|Ip1vFFtZaa	erm. why the hell are you judging him by the date he was born?<br>  hes a guy. he could be pissed off... star signs are irrelevant to how a person behaves. even the horoscopes are made so indefinable that practically everybody can relate to them.<br>  i mean if it said "all Leo's are going to die on tuesday" do you seriously expect everybody that was born under those dates to suddenly drop dead?|`|RnB6D6ZYaa	He wouldn't do that to you if he thought you were hot.|`|oYeLOcUAaa	yeah and then ,they turn everything around that u r being childish and so on.    and there controlling to .|`|cuIX13BKaa	Oh quite often!

Some people just dont like their music, its an opinion, you like what you like, and its not your fault. And then their is another thing...They're ASSHOLES! Thats just facts. Everybody all around the world think that they're the greatest guys to come into this earth. Well, a great guy will not use a 14 year old girl (Miley Cyrus) to boost their own career. For example - Pretending you love her just so that they can perform at her concert. Proof: wiki.answers.com/Q/Are_Nick_Jonas_and_Mi...<br>  Quote from Nick Jonas himself: "The truth is I didnt even wanted to be with her this year 2008. My brothers, Joe and Kevin, had forced me to be with her just until after her concert." And there you have it for Nick and Miley and Niley fans.<br>  Reason 2 - Taylor Swift. She was a sweet girl, she helped the Jonas Brothers and performed at their concert, and where the hell did Joe get off breaking up with her over the phone for 27 seconds no less. Yall think she should just "Get over it"? <br>  <br>  Angela: Wait, why did you just make air quotes, Toni?<br>  <br>  Toni: Oh no, these weren't air quotes, I was practicing clawing the Jonas Brothers eyes out. <br>  <br>  Angela: *Laughs* I'd wish for that anyday (:<br>  <br>  Toni: Anyway, Yall think she should "Get over it"? Alright, put yourself in Taylor's shoes, how would you like it if he broke up with you over the phone for 27 seconds making you feel like thats all you're worth is 27 seconds out of his day? Lets just face it, The Jonas Brothers are cocky, arrogant son of a bitches who let fame go straight to their heads. <br>  <br>  Toni, Angela and Giselle: And thats why they suck! Thats why we hate the Jonas Brothers. <br>  <br>  Ps: We never hated the Jonas Brothers, we never liked them, but we never hated them. Now, for the reasons we just listed above, we hate 'em.<br>  <br>  Giselle: I just NEVER found them attractive.<br>  <br>  Angela: Girl, I never found the Jonas Brothers attractive neither did I found their personality's attractive either :D Toni, you?<br>  <br>  Toni: I think they're all bicho's. Not just them, all these wannabe playa's.<br>  <br>  Angela and Giselle: Yup ;D|`|uxVIlXlvaa	because they cant act. they cant play instruments (literally all their songs are only chord orientated, no talent whatsoever) they dont write their own songs, and their lyrics are bland and two dimensional. <br>  jealousy also has alot to do with it. there are people who persevered and went through so much, scratched and clawed to play their instruments right. to make their talent grow to an amazing level. and here are the jonas bros, who are just handed a million dollar contract for making 3 chord songs. it does make me mad and jealous that i and so many others worked hard to perfect our talent on our instruments (guitar for me) only to see people like these guys get the spotlight and millions of pathetic teen screaming fans.|`|GOdJYN8Haa	CUZ THEY SUCk!!!  im sorrry, but theres nothing more to it! and there EVERY WHERE. almost evry teen magazine, has the jonas brothers on the cover. PLUS.... they try to be all cool, and there not. theyre on disney channell all the time, and try to be all, LOOK AT ME NOT THEM! and its not even funny.|`|33d13c8fa116273403e0f7b580bfabe3aa	I wouldn't say they're gay.... but they do indeed suck. Their music is teeny bop sugar pop and requires no talent to play. Instead, it requires a gimmick (the fact that they're brothers), good looking people (3 young good looking boys), and the ability to moderately hold a tune... which they can.... barely. Sorry to break it to you, but they're just another fad... like the Spice Girls, 98 degrees, and Hanson.|`|VrPTLsecaa	(sigh) Please take a gander at this answer I gave, and might I add got best answer for, regarding basically the same question:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkB7rp_vejVWoo_hi5rnVBnty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090301111306AAZ9A2E&show=7#profile-info-Ctq3pcIsaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  May I repeat:<br>  <br>  But what, honestly is there to like? I listened to their music, I saw them act... I don't see anything. The songs are generic, poorly written and the vocals are shrill- they sound even worse live. It's another band that plays most of the instruments- nothing spectacular about that either. And their acting is equivalent to pulling some random person off the street and sticking them in front of a camera. It doesn't normally work.<br>  <br>  <br>  *** to pudding cups. You disproved NOTHING. FAIL. Yes, deciding whether they can sing or not is subject to opinion. But here's the thing. Lots of people can sing in this world. Some sing to the same level as the Jonas Twits, some even sing better, and they aren't recognized. Why? Usually if they want to, it doesn't happen because they aren't worth it. What really shines is people who not only can sing, but have a voice. There is a gift found in their talent. And all this hype for a group of boys who's talents are this bland is to me a terrible waste of energy. I grew up to rock bands and musicians who actually do have something and, as a result have stuck around for decades. If you'ree a fan of music, it's easy to differentiate a song, to people singing to some tune.<br>  <br>  I HATE the craziness and obsession by their fans too. VERY annoying. And all that effort for nothing, considering that they'lll be forgotten in a few months.|`|w5D1WCm7aa	1.)Their music is terrible and so is their acting.<br>  2.)The skinny jeans are a wee bit too tight for them.|`|S5NsAX7xaa	It's unfair for people to call them gay just because they're saving themselves .....but...as a gay male myself , I do get a secretly gay vibe from the one with straight hair. I don't know....people usually just hate people who are beloved so greatly without coming out with a significant movie or song (or at least significant to people over 13).|`|RX4nj825aa	i think they rock and im saving myself till i get married they are living a great example|`|6qPndPvXaa	*sob because they sob  dumped Poor little ole Miley C and ...wahhhhh  poor lil ole Taylor Swift..and *tears here...

Anyone else probably truely doesn't like them!|`|pMdnxIhNaa	no one likes attention off them|`|oE0JCu89aa	Because they're a group of boys used by Disney as an attraction tool to gather fans that are between the age of 8 and 15. <br>  <br>  They're famous by populartity, not talent.|`|wqCznap2aa	They can't sing for their life.

So if the big girls/guys don't like them ... who cares that's not who they are targeting anyway...plus there is nothing wrong with saving anything till marriage, and don't let anyone tell you other wise.

BE PROUD OF WHO YOU ARE!|`|GUqL7Wtaaa	i dont get it either.. i seriously think its jealousy. it has to be jeolousy.<br>  they're so sweet, caring, pure, AMAZING, super talented, & simply amazingggggg guys :) i love them so much!<br>  <br>  and dont listen to all these other comments. their just people with no lives that couldnt wait to see a jonas brothers comment so they could try & convince us that they suck.. even though we KNOW they dont :)<br>  <br>  <br>  btw i just read everyone's comments and i'm crying right now. the jonas brothers get me by.. they make me so happy. and they make millions of other people happy too. when i'm sad, i listen to them, and suddenly i feel better. i just can't believe what all of you horrible people are saying about them! i cant believe it. its making me cry. if you dont like a certain band, dont go ******* spreading it around the world because you're only hurting the people's feelings that do like them. the jonas brothers are amazing people! they DO deserve to be recognized for it. please dont try to bring them down, because you're bringing all of their fans down too. <br>  <br>  I LOVE THE JONAS BROTHERS|`|sJvpLSunaa	i think the people who say they suck are "following the crowd".  I think they make ok music myself|`|UBbZlNGnaa	well people think they're childish.<br>  and they don't have that great voices.<br>  no offence to people who like the jonas brothers.<br>  but some people just think that 14 or 15 year olds should'nt be listening to guys that are trying to reach a younger audience.<br>  and there are many artists that have some better vocals.<br>  i hope this helped :]|`|1zYsFlbwaa	because they became famous in such a short period of time.

Dont worry what others think :D|`|09fdLaeIaa	because maybe they are too popular<br>  I personally like the Jo Bros also!|`|u1qgyGFNaa	just the fact that they compare themseves to the beatles annoys me,plus to be honest as musicians they dont have talent,their thoughts which range around the common ground squirrel,about maturity is despicable,theyre too old to be playing songs for 13 year olds and disney.|`|tSU1BmGtaa	They don't suck at all, they're okay/cool.|`|hMF3kg3Baa	I really don't listen to them only because i am 39 and am more into the 80's hair bands and 70's bands like Fleetwood mac, and stuff like that. They seem Ok to me, and seem to have a lot of talent.|`|nINWMSSGaa	No, is because they are a mediocre boy band that will be over shadowed by a new one within a year at most. Plus, their music sucks and their only fans are small teen girls who get turned on by their looks, the music being just an added glamor.|`|ADLfq3uPaa	Well  that's their opinions|`|WBahQFGXaa	thats your opinion. don't ***** me.<br>  imo, they cant sing, they are whiney, they aren't good looking, and yeah..|`|4o1f90Craa	Maybe because they think there ugly|`|fe8Wz86Caa	everyone says my math teacher i gay because he has a purity ring and hes 26 and he knows a few jonas brothers songs...|`|ILouXH3Gaa	lol ew i only think their kinda gay cuz their clothes r....<br>  besides, i have nothing against them "saving themselves till they get married." im muslim and i have to do the same. i just dont like their music.|`|AzME6jxNaa	they are jealous idk.because they are from disney and disney is kiddish and gay according to alot of people.they are probably just jealous because thousands of girls love them. and some of their fans are really creepy|`|YYMlqp4Taa	BECAUSE THEY DO|`|80DPSlhJaa	Because they are GAY, UGLY, HORRIBLE SINGERS, and just PLAIN STUPID! And they arn't gay because they are saving them self until marrige, I will probably do that to.|`|9415fb4f621cd1718ee37afdf18253fdaa	Because they just do. Nuff said.|`|YGYMocGRaa	its just so obvious that theyre talentless twits created by a record label to vacuum money out of teeneage girls pockets who dont know how to illegally download, also they have no musical taste whatsoever.|`|ltHslyCeaa	people think they are ... because of the clothes they wear, the fact the only sport they play is wiffle ball *snicker*, and their singing voices sound like girls<br>  people don't like them because their jealous|`|7Sjwhgu1aa	cuz they dreess wierd and there songs all are the same|`|txv7TIgiaa	cuz they do|`|lrJopeC5aa	I don't like their music I am just into a little more hardcore rock then them and I don't really like all this mainstream media stuff|`|IughNY1uaa	I don't get it either. Not only are they really talented, but they are good people too.  I met them awhile ago and they were really nice, down to earth guys. It felt like I was talking to my friends.

c4q4lpr0aa	You may have a virus, you can get cough medicine that is an expectorant, so it still means you get rid of the nasties. I recommend warm honey & lemon to drink, plenty of water & have you got a vapour rub that you could apply to your back & chest? Maybe some paracetamol may help (in the correct dosage - read the label), as this may help you feel a bit better in general. I hope you are feeling better soon & think you are wise to get yourself checked out by your doctor. x|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	One thing that I have done lately when I start to feel sick is to just keep drinking water - you don't have to chug it, but just keep water coming in all the time.  I don't know what it does, but it has helped me a lot.<br>  <br>  Next, if ever you were going to eat well, this is the time.  All the body has to repair itself is what you put in.  This is the time to eat a wide variety of natural foods.  Get nuts, berries, whole grains and then an assortment of fruits and vegetables.  I recommend the rainbow method - get all kinds of different colored foods because the color is an indication of their mineral content, and you want all kinds.   And if you have any source of sugar or anything high in carbs, just back off on it until you feel better.  The body doesn't like empty sugars.|`|q9BItD25aa	Sounds like you have pneumonia........you should take an OTC cough medicine with an expectorant and a suppressant.

Sun would never go back if she thought Jin was dead and, more important, Locke would never allow it because he promised Jin not to let her return. You could see Ben's demeanor change when Locke showed him Jin's ring and said Sun was not going to be contacted. A soon as I saw that look I knew he was going to kill Locke. He was going to use the ring to lie to Sun to get her to return. If Locke was still alive, she would never go back. With Locke dead, it was easier for Ben to manipulate everyone to go back.<br>  <br>  Follow the link for the best theory of Lost that I've read.|`|aBzRV8EXaa	Locked was suppose to die so ben make it happen for him|`|uH28xTcbaa	oh, I m still on episode 4 so I dont know..-.

t5wUPU3Kaa	i would suggest using something other than Anne Frank simply because she didn't really change much. it was more or less a courageous story which gave insight on those in hiding during the holocaust. <br>  <br>  what i'm getting at is talk about the holocaust itself, and possibly the eye opener it was for how human nature had the potential to be much more evil then one would think.|`|UK6nWrFaaa	Annelies Marie "Anne" Frank ( pronunciation (help·info)) (12 June 1929 in Frankfurt am Main – early March 1945 in Bergen Belsen) was a Jewish girl who was born in the city of Frankfurt am Main in Weimar Germany, and who lived most of her life in or near Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. She gained international fame posthumously following the publication of her diary which documents her experiences hiding during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II.<br>  <br>  Anne and her family moved to Amsterdam in 1933 after the Nazis gained power in Germany, and were trapped by the occupation of the Netherlands, which began in 1940. As persecutions against the Jewish population increased, the family went into hiding in July 1942 in hidden rooms in her father Otto Frank's office building. After two years, the group was betrayed and transported to concentration camps. Seven months after her arrest, Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, within days of the death of her sister, Margot Frank. Her father Otto, the only survivor of the group, returned to Amsterdam after the war to find that her diary had been saved, and his efforts led to its publication in 1947. It was translated from its original Dutch and first published in English in 1952 as The Diary of a Young Girl.<br>  <br>  The diary, which was given to Anne on her 13th birthday, chronicles her life from 12 June 1942 until 1 August 1944. It has been translated into many languages, has become one of the world's most widely read books, and has been the basis for several plays and films. Anne Frank has been acknowledged for the quality of her writing, and has become one of the most renowned and most discussed victims of the Holocaust.

tuATxHsVaa	Yes, it is Mozart's music. It's from his Requiem.<br>  <br>  Specifically:<br>  <br>  It's the "Dies Irae" (Day of Wrath) movement from his Requiem in D minor, K. 626<br>  <br>  Here's a link to Solti conducting this movement:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_YSEbAWA0Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_YSEbAWA...</a><br>  <br>  Great piece of music. I performed in a rendition of it last year. Always exciting!<br>  <br>  The Requiem is the last major piece of music that Mozart composed, and he didn't finish it before he died. The Sü?meyer (Xavier Süssmeyer - sometimes spelled just plain Sussmeyer) version is usually performed. He was a student of Mozart's and Mozart gave him instructions on how to complete it.  The "Dies Irae" is very much written by Mozart. It's from the "Lacrimosa" movement and onwards that you find Sü?meyer's influence on the work.<br>  <br>  And of course, as the next person mentioned, this is indeed a parody of the movie "Amadeus" <br>  <br>  It's a great movie about Mozart. One of my favorite movies of all time (I just wish it had more historical accuracy, but I love it regardless).<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|q6uyloYdaa	That scene is actually referencing the movie "Amadeus" which is about Mozart. The guy who answered first is right about the music but I just wanted to advertise the movie, because it is an excellent film! I was happy to see Family Guy give it a nod when I saw that episode.

agf7Wcmlaa	Well, as i see it. Pain is standing over hinata with his blade out (no dirt >.>) and just as hes about to finish her off glances up at naruto with that look, to me it looks like he is directing narutos thoughts into what he is about to do and waits for the reaction. As he sees him cry out for her, he makes the action of killing her. But that doesnt mean he killed her. Due to 'the look' i think he just wanted to make sue naruto thought he was going to kill her, i mean tbh she is absolutely no match for him and he knows that, if you see her beforehand shes already K.O'd so why would he need to kil her, he knows where naruto is and so has no use in killing her. But his reaction when naruto turns into the six tailed beast in an instant, maybe he wanted to see the full power of the kyubbi, or maybe he wanted to get this reaction so naruto would loose himself and further destroy the village, because nagato has revenge for konoha but as seen in previous chapter is weak and very low on chakra, so he exploits naruto to deal the last blow to konoha ...... maybe? these are just my thoughts..... but i see no reason why he would kill hinata, then again i see no reason why he wouldnt. <br>  <br>  So for a good degree, i highly doubt they will kill off hinata, she's most likely going to be one of the centre of attentions after this arc. Pain, only showed it as he killed Hinata so naruto would feel 'true pain' <br>  <br>  So, in my own personal view, she is not dead. <br>  <br>  You can relax,   do you reli think kishimoto is stupid enough to kill another main character, jaria, kakashi (RIP </3) and then hinata, too many fans would abandon hope.|`|1AdTCWe0aa	Well i know naruto isn't in love with Hinata.... yet.... but after what she said, its obvious that alot of her "strange" behavior in the past was cleared up peeerity quick. Naruto only turned into the kyuubi because he was angry at pain for INJURING Hinata. Meaning! ... she isn't dead yet, and naruto seams to have very rapidly developed some protective feelings for her.... clearly if hurting her made him more angry than when pain killed his beloved froggy teacher.... hint hint... :)<br>  <br>  If you know Hinata's history than this kinda stuff is always happening to her? And what always happens? Think about it? Naruto always saves her and yada yada yoo :)<br>  <br>  Akuna matata :)|`|dpAD1KoEaa	look I didn't know that kakashi was dead but that doesn't matter... naruto has lost everything... the only thing left for him is to call out the rest of the tails and destroy the planet... thats the only way this story could have a happy ending. but if hinata dies i'm gonna sue the author...|`|VMhufyheaa	hell no!!<br>  1. hinata is my fave character<br>  2. she is extremely cute and adorable especially when around naruto<br>  3. she loves naruto and FINALLY confesses it<br>  4. she is the hyuuga heiress<br>  5. sakura will get him :(<br>  6. i just love her too much<br>  <br>  I would find kishi and sue his azz off!! <br>  answer mine plzz<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqjJX_2ua3xI1epq8dzZMa3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090228130425AAO2Gd9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ByXGQiB6aa	i dont know exactly if shes dead or not she might be but i hope she still alive i mean she can jus be knocked out and pain didnt kill her because he wanted naruto to fell the true meaning of pain! and if shes alive i know that naruto will confess his true fellings to did you see the way he got super pissed when pain hurt NOT killed her i think he does care/love her! and if she dies naruto will kill not jus pain but all of the akaski in anger (not sasukes akaski team) he probly wont be able to but he will try|`|AA10018612	Umm #1 how is hinata naruto's true love?? He never noticed her until now?So what feelings that he never knew till now will grow? And how can you guys sue?? It's KISIMOTO"S story ! Not yours! You're just reading it !<br>  <br>  Gosh I guess what I hate about naruhina fans (the hardcore ones) is that you never look at hinata as an individual. She always has to be with her "man" in order for people to care .<br>  <br>  Why couldn't you guys want her to get strong for her sake only and not to only impress naruto.<br>  <br>  Besides itachi fans and kakashi fans threaten to stop reading naruto yet they still are so if you quit reading you won't be missed.|`|6rR7LTl1aa	They're his characters.  He doesn't really need anyone's forgiveness, as the popularity of the series is sure to continue with or without her.|`|M8qLP7MLaa	I don't think Hinata is Naruto's true love, and I don't think he needs anyones forgiveness. <br>  <br>  Naruto belongs to him. That's why on fanfictions people leave disclaimers. It's why amv's are always being taken down by YT all the time.<br>  <br>  I know he's killing off a lot of the good characters, but I'm sure there is reason behind it. He's not just killing them off because he can. Besides, it would be kind of stupid if no one in Naruto ever died. Wouldn't be as interesting and would make everything predictable. Predictable is boring.

NUvu9vMDaa	everyone is a good singer, you just have too keep working on it to improve it. its a good thing that you sing because most people are afraid of what other people think. im sure that you are a great singer, and your parents probably want you to stop either because you are too loud or youre singing at the wrong times like if someone is on the phone, etc. trust your friends and other people! and if some people dont like it, that probably means that they are jealous of your voice! good luck!|`|AA11968687	Well, your parents might just say stop, because they are busy with something else on their mind. I usually consider someone a good singer if they sing according to their voice pitch and do not go out of tune too much. But just sing if you enjoy it, as long as you don't intentionally bug anyone, don't pay attention to any criticism.|`|juWJ47hXaa	You will know if you are good when you spontaneously burst out into song, and no one tells you to shut up.|`|CNZn1qhJaa	I haven't heard you sing. <br>  <br>  <br>  But if your mom and dad tell you that you are bad, then you are bad.|`|vhy0k2dtaa	If your family tells you you suck, believe them.|`|D7JZPxDzaa	ppl tell you. Why dont you record yourself|`|pCS0d1axaa	Normally people tend to be polite and will always say you are a good singer so its really difficult to know if you are one or no unless you find a professional or get an honest opinion. Why don't you try recording your voice and playing it back it(it will sound much different that what you can imagine but might help you decide if you are really good or not). If you want to really know and get famous either way you can audition for a singing competition like american idol in your country|`|68lLAQnKaa	sing infront of someone you know who can sing and ask for their honest opinion, better yet sing into a camera and post it on you tube then email me the link, and I'll tell you, I am a musician, and vocalist, I'll be honest and help you out|`|HnbJhpnbaa	Well when people tell you that your good do they sound like their lieing or being honest.

3jCNZmv3aa	First, the people answering this question seriously need to get a grip. She asked a simple question about a comic book character and your acting like she personally attacked you. <br>    As for the question, I was raised as a christian and still am. I have always love the X-men. I understand where you are coming from but it is a purely fictional story. I absolutely know that there is only one GOD and nothing will change that. Many comic book characters are based on some form of mythology. Most writers draw their perspective from mythology, legends, cultural differences or just plain good imagination. It is meant to entertain. Unless the character is offensive or in direct violation to biblical law, I see no reason to have aconflictt. Follow your conscience, it will guide you to what is right for you.|`|i5WmqwIaaa	Im with you.<br>  <br>  You remember the saying ignorance is bliss?|`|Jz7KDYoEaa	Before you read this note I am not Jewish, Muslim, nor a pagan. This may be what you believe but your belief isn't the only faith, religion or whatever you may want to call it out there. There are many people who believe in polytheism, there are many people who believe christianity is just as out there as Scientology. The fact is the world, its people and their faiths and beliefs are quite diverse and this should be respected. It should also be accepted that characters (heroic characters) can have beliefs that aren't the "norm" or different from most of its audiences beliefs. Diversity's a good thing. There is nothing wrong with it. I am not a christian but I don't commit crimes, hurt people I'm a regular guy and I seem to follow more of the 10 commandments than most christians I know. Pagnism is the oldest form of religion as far as we know, The early Hebrews worshiped many gods and centuries after they started worshiping the god many christians and jews believe in today still worshiped mutiple gods. Let people believe what they want to. Remember the christians killed plenty in the name of Jesus so you can't claim superiority over another group. Christians sacked Canstantinople, murdered many muslims during the third attempt of the Crusades. I'm not blaming Jesus, or christianity, most organised religions have extremely violent histories which is something we should acknowledge moreso and maybe this will keep people from feeling that another's beliefs are inferior because your question implies such a thought process.|`|hzH75VDXaa	I'm sorry but this type of question really annoys me.<br>  <br>  Nothing has changed. her character is still exactly the same. She is still the same character that you fell in love with.<br>  The only difference is that now you know that your assumption that she was catholic is false.<br>  Of course she was worshipped. She controls the weather after all. Something only a god is supposed to do.<br>  Why would the beliefs of a fictional character change the way you feel about her? She's not real. Her soul isn't in some peril because she doesn't believe in the same god as you.<br>  <br>  Fiction is fiction. Enjoy the story for what it is.

iGUW85iFaa	You can't define "real Metal" when there are different genres of metal. <br>  For example Testament, megadeth and slayer are real metal, but they are thrash metal.

There is no definition therefore world peace is impossible. And even if it meant everyone was happy and no-one fought, where would the happiness be...?|`|vOAKMUIbaa	world peace is something that we need to set as a goal but that is not possible if we keep on fighting.People need to stop fighting over stupid stuff before there is another world war.It is so stupid to fight because there is a great chance that u will die.I do not know what we r looking for but we need to find what we are looking for and stop fighting.Maybe maybe not lots of people probably do not want everybody to be happy.Well i guess everyone does want to be in love but we will not find love if we keep on fighting.Peace in my words is no wars every body is  nice to each other,there is peace and harmony, people do not kill people.And so on i guess i said allot but i could not help but say allot.|`|4eaf3b65b8bcd61e0c28ed377fb53935aa	safety, security. we shouldn't be at war with one another, we should help our neighbors and be accepting of each other's differences|`|YxNWmo8Oaa	when people stop killing for this little spec in the universe...

War is just one extreme of what can constitute the problem that prevents world peace.<br>  <br>  In the real way to determine what world peace is, we need to both look deep inside and outside as well. (this question is just for self answering, I don't really want to know) How often do we say, when looking at someone else, what our initial impression is?  Do we ever think that one religion is bad while another is good?  Do we say that, because of the events on 9/11, all Arabs are bad?<br>  <br>  The real way to achieve world peace is when all people, everywhere, are able to accept that someone believes differently or is not exactly the same as what we may consider "normal." When we can actually get not just ourselves, but others to accept that we are all different, all "alien," and are easy with that, then world peace becomes possible.<br>  <br>  Consider this, in closing.  How many wars have been fought because of an inability to accept differences in another?  Answer that, and you'll know how to achieve world peace.|`|pbqo4nXGaa	I guess I would define "world peace" is having all the countries just getting along. Stop the fighting & just be friendly towards one another.<br>  If you think about it, how wonderful would it be to be able to travel to other places & not fear terrorism or not have to be afraid that the guy next to you on a plane is going to try to hijack the plane or something.<br>  I think if everyone did get along, then we could all be happy. What a wonderful world it would be.

But then anything can cause this including bad filter capacitors in say televisions, the microwave, or even a home phone.<br>  <br>  It needs circuits to create to become a transmitter, if not all it can do would be possibly noise which on a radio you would already hear especially on AM|`|8d8ab47e8ed90106991e8fe465e9f82caa	Yes!    All superhet radio receivers have an local oscillator (LO) in them for injecting a signal into the mixer stage, this oscillator will radiate a certain distance from the receiver. A good one for radiating is radar detectors, police use a VG-2 detector to pick up this LO signal indicating that one particular car has a radar detector in it. Unlawful in certain states.|`|unvP5cUdaa	Depends on the radio. Most of the parts are there, but they have to be rearranged by someone who knows what they're doing - and you have to fashion a sending device. Like turn the speaker into a mic or cobble togethr a key for Morse Code.<br>  <br>  If an especially powerful radio with antenna is near a smaller radio, it is possible the signals from the big one will bleed over to the little one causing the interference you describe.<br>  <br>  -a guy named duh

hvrw02Egaa	In the view of the island people, only 4 days have passed. But no one truly knows how much time is passing there, considering they keep going through those time flashes. My guess is that the island will technically be in the same 3 years later time as the non island people even though it has only felt like 4 days. Hopefully the episode tonight will clear that up!|`|71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	One current theory is the Island is in a time warp. In fact that might be what the countdown clock and the button in the hatch were for. It shifted the island back in time every 104 minutes so time never passed.<br>  <br>  For more on the time loop theory follow the link to the best theory I've read.|`|77lIzq4Taa	Those on the island are stuck in a "time stream" they are moving from time to time. Regular time has no hold on them so while it only seem like 3 or 4 days on the island, it it is more than 3 years in regular time for the 6 who got off the island. The only problem is that jumping from time to time is killing everyone on the island. Why? I am not sure.|`|LBovv7Sxaa	hopefully you've seen tonights episode (LaFleur).<br>  <br>  if not, to answer your question: Sawyer, Juliet and company are stuck in the 1970's era Dharma and have been there for three years.<br>  <br>  insaaaaaane.

akcGfgdcaa	Tough question. I'm going to give it to Ben Kingsley though, just purely because he's still actively trying to play different kinds of roles and do something different.<br>  <br>  Anthony Hopkins is a great actor but recently he just seems to either play someone like himself or Hannibal...
L1qQBNbbaa	Their acting styles are different from each other, Hopkins when he's acting you are held in awe of his great acting, But with Kingsley he delves so deep into character you forget it's him.<br>  As much as i like Hopkins i feel Kingsley has  a much bigger range to see the great degree of his ability i would say the performances in Suspect Zero , as a remote-viewer at his wits end verses his portrayal of Fagin in Roma Polanski's Oliver Twist would be a good example.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	Well, Hopkins has this...spark when he acts. It's obvious when we saw him in Silence of the Lambs. Even films from the 70s, I think I saw him in one, he was very young, I only saw a small part, & he was still good. Even for those 3 minutes. It tells me he has it. <br>  <br>  Kingsley on the other hand, i see his movies, there's just no comparison with Hopkins. He's good, but no comparison. In this case, Hopkins win.|`|cVbpywZpaa	i'd say ben kingsley, we've seen him as ghandi, as a vampire lord in bloodrayne, as a pure psycho in sexy beast, and i think the pure rage and psychoticism he portrays in sexy beast is genius one of my favourite performances ever...........but i have to say it is hard to choose between the two as hopkins is also extremly talented i especially enjoy his performances in silence of the lambs, the elephant man, the edge and instinct.|`|kyEPS7xCaa	Ben Kingsley.  His role in Sexy Beast was freaking awesome.  Better than Hopkins role in Silence of the Lambs in my opinion.|`|HBV9GGXDaa	Hopkins!  He is never Sir Anthony on screen and he has only been Hannibal once.

RrQNJsVsaa	Well they were planning to make one in 2006 but never did because they wanted to make "Wanted" which was another separate version of it. If we are lucky they will make it this year, the only false reason they wouldn't again is to make another movie of something. Matrix Rebirth is the name of it. The Oracle even told us at the end so sometime they will for sure. It is either this year or the following year, next year. Neo is reborned into the matrix and the Smiths are rebirthed into the matrix as long as they are still in Neo. Last movie of it if it turns into a movie. I produce these movies, the writers tell me things. So trust me.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	No, my brother is a HUGE fan of The Matrix, & as far as I know, Neo was blind & died in the end.

dpYMlxA4aa	Shakespeare comes in at the end of Renaissance music and the early Baroque.<br>  Romeo and Juliet was written some time between 1591 and 1595 (there's some scholarly debate about the exact date)<br>  Shakespeare lived from April 1564 – 23 April 1616<br>  renaissance music is generally about 1400-1600<br>  Baroque is generally about 1600-1750<br>  though you should realize that transitions between eras are gradual, people didn't say it's 1600 time to start doing baroque music (the labels came hundreds of years after the fact)<br>  <br>  Pachelbel's Canon is much later, dated around 1680.<br>  So I'd go with something by Orlando Gibbons, a very popular English composer during Shakespeares life.<br>  <br>  And as you say in your question you are quite lazy, I found this all out with google in about 3 minutes.|`|z9aZNCYTaa	Well; I'd say Pachebel's cannon is a little bit modern. Elizabethan style is more like Renaissance than Baroque. It usually has a little more "bounce" in it. For a sound example: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Holborne-Elizabethian-Dance-Suite/dp/B001AUDBOG/ref=sr_f2_1?ie=UTF8&s=dmusic&qid=1236209551&sr=102-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Holborne-Elizabeth...</a> <br>  <br>  You might try looking for "Renaissance" style music, since it's slim pick'ns if you search for Elizabethan music to learn. Try here: <a href="http://search.musicnotes.com/?q=renaissance&search_id=Top&hl=n" rel="nofollow">http://search.musicnotes.com/?q=renaissa...</a><br>  <br>  Also, the "Galliard" was a dance that Elizabeth was famous for in particular. I'm not sure if you can find anything on it or not, but it would be perfect for your project.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

9uXa8jiVaa	I LOVE JB and the Movie and I especially loved the Shirtless Scene with Joe in it.....he looked so HOT!!!!!!! oh and Joe is my fav too!!!!|`|XinfIm3zaa	It was okay! i thought it was kinda a rip off! they said it was an hour and a half, but it went for like one hour! And i had to pay $15 to see it. The movie was good, but they sang songs that i have never heard (and trust me i have heard ALL their songs). Oh and Nick (the hottie) never did his flip! Kevin (the nice one) kept on running on the catwalk thing on the front of the stage, he was acting like he ws all that. And Joe (the rude one, i mean come on he broke up with Taylor Swift over a 27 second phone call, that's like saying were over sorry bye) wore terrible clothes and did all these weird dance moves, it looked like he was having a seizure!|`|lJBGvpF9aa	o my garnit!!! i loved it !!!!! i dont love love love love love love love love love the jonas brothers but i pretty much love any group/band so yeah i guess i do love the jonas brothers. lol. but yep i loved the movie!!! i so so so so so so so so so so so hope they make another!!!!!!!! =D|`|5Sp6h5Qzaa	It was average.

It will mess up your pc, it will give you viruses, the songs you download will be poor quality and the music will be corrupted so probably wont play anyway. Also, its illegal. <br>  <br>  Try somewhere like <a href="http://www.mp3obsession.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mp3obsession.com/</a> instead, it reviews alternatives to iTunes, all of which are a lot cheaper. It is also legal and there is no software to download so you won't get viruses.|`|Rsr8nngWaa	Limewire isn't regulated or checked and opens up your computer to anyone who feels like it, so yes you get viruses. If you really don't want to pay for music, just listen to it on youtube.|`|CDymqY65aa	Limewire is piracy and any websites that lets you pirate anything is extremly risky to use.|`|FOtNl2Lxaa	i use limewire but i've never gotten a virus i only download files that have a complete description and i high number of locations|`|bc0NTxNUaa	Its almost certain that you will get a virus eventually from using Limewire, and a bad one at that. When I used it, it gave my computer a horrible virus that couldn't be fixes here. My dad had to take it to a shop and it cost $500 just to fix (I'm not lying or exaggerating). I don't know anybody who hasn't gotten a horrible virus from the program. Limewire is illegal, also. But now I use the YouTube downloader, where you can just download videos and convert them to just audio. Its much safer, though it takes a little longer to download everything.|`|oE0JCu89aa	Limewire is filled with viruses, in all types of material.<br>  <br>  I've gotten so many viruses from downloading old hip hop songs. I got a virus from a Dr. Dre song, a Chris Brown song, a En Vogue song, but my anti-virus caught it in time.<br>  <br>  in short, Limewire gives you viruses, including songs and pictures. I use Avast anti-virus, the real-time protection caught all the viruses I almost got infected with from Limewire.|`|sQFnEgMxaa	You can recieve viruses when you use Limewire but only if you download something that is fake. When you download a file, go to your start menu and see if it comes up in the list. If it doesn't show up, or if when you try playing in a media player on your computer it comes up with an error message, then chances are it could contain a virus.|`|kQgSi1MEaa	No, people attach viruses to mp3 files too.

It is a network, and what other people put on the network is what can be spread, including viruses.  People have to say what type of file they are uploading, but that doesn't mean they are honest.<br>  <br>  It is very easy to upload a virus to Limewire.  You just attach it to the music file, and because no administrators check the files, the virus won't be stopped and will spread to anyone who downloads that song.<br>  <br>  Even though you thought that you were downloading songs, that stuff on there isn't 100% verifiable and so there was probably a virus attached to one of the songs.|`|PqtUe6mjaa	Limewire in itself does not give you viruses. But you certainly can get viruses from downloading ANY file from limewire. Songs can store viruses the exact same way that porn can. Here's a good rule of thumb...check to see how LARGE the files you're downloading are. you want it to be around a mb shorter or larger than the length of your song. So if its a 4 minute song, the file size should be around 3-5 mb. if it's a 4 minute song and it's 9mb then the file size is much bigger than it needs to be and chances are it's storing a virus<br>  <br>  ALSO...you may have gotten your virus in a variety of different ways. For instance, in December Microsoft admitted that Internet Explorer had a huge hole in the program that allowed viruses to attack your computer just by visiting affected sites. Not all of these sites were bad either. They ranged from inappropriate material to news sites and shopping sites. You may want to consider getting a different browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.<br>  <br>  Also, any software you're downloading off of the internet can come with viruses as well.

RTHWQvkzaa	Kind of similar to me:) I love the Climb by Miley Cyrus<br>  <br>  This is a really good song: "Just a dream" by Carrie underwood.<br>  <br>  You need to really listen to the song at least twice or print the lyrics to understand it. But when i finally took the time to listen, I realized it had a really important meaning. It is very sad, actually, I think its about a woman who loses a husband or boyfriend in war or something. Don't be turned off by my description! It really is a good song, trust me :)<br>  <br>  Also I would definately suggest songs by taylor swift, like "Invisible" "Cold as You" "White Horse" and "Teardrops on my guitar" on that isnt as sad is "Love story" which you might have already heard.

5KsAqbmaaa	I've wondered about this myself Sir Alan, especially since several people have got (or have had) nice motors and the sort of cars that would attract the wrong sort of attention if left in the back streets of Manchester - I'm thinking of Mike Baldwin and Dev for example...<br>  <br>  I have two theories;  firstly that someone possibly yet to appear in the soap is operating a valet parking scheme along with the hand car wash down at the canal, or secondly that the red rec has been concreted over and is now being used as a communal parking area. <br>  <br>  I favour this second option: no-one has mentioned the red rec of late at all, in fact I can't remember going there since Emily and Spider were demonstrating up the tree.  No-one has thought to take their children there to play, thinking of Steve and Tracey's currently invisible child who will reappear completely metamorphosised in episodes to come - yet I digress.  Even Ken has take to walking his dog along by the canal recently rather than going to the red rec.<br>  <br>  On the theme of transport, have you ever seen a delivery lorry at the pub or goods' vans at the factory or Kabin?  Mysterious isn't it?  Perhaps these activities take place when the cameras aren't there so that they don't interfere with the filming...next thing will be web cam on the street - now that WOULD be interesting - to see what they all get up to when they think we are not watching - perhaps THEN we would find out where they park!|`|v8XK80Ycaa	They park them in Janice Battersby's massive miserable gob!<br>  ..and have you noticed that NO-ONE on EASTENDERS has got a piggin washin machine?! dirty b*****ds|`|Wbi1nhHyaa	This is such a funny thing to notice!

yXFYNV60aa	its just a marvellous movie, it made me realise that what i have is far more compared to what the slum dogs have.............we should be thankful for what we have..............i loved the way they showed the boy to cope up with life after losing practically everything......it does become violent at times but still i also liked how he does not worry about a penny in the show and only came there for latika..........i'd love to buy the DVD when it comes out.......|`|t0Z2dpdlaa	i really liked it and its a great movie to watch because it has to do with india and just shows that bollywood is kinda coming to hollywood. you'll love it, its great!|`|DAmUAmPnaa	Winner of 8 oscars so there is something about it.<br>  <br>  Great Movie|`|6HyIkR7Caa	It's a well made movie but not that great. It bagged 8 Oscars, that's really shocking. Bollywood had produced movies portraying slums, corruption and dark side of India many years back, this time the west appreciated Slumdog millionaire. I’d rather give my vote for DevD or Parzania. I have seen this upcoming movie Barah Aana at the Pune film festival. What a movie it is, extremely well made.  Even the big actors like Aamir Khan and John Abraham have given good review on the movie.

I think everybody should see it.  It deserved all the awards it got.<br>  <br>  But, even though I really really liked it, it isn't *great* in the fact that you don't really have alot of motivation to go back and watch it again?  My favorite movies are those that I can watch over and over again, but I don't get that with Slumdog.  It was amazing the first time through, but I don't think I'll watch it again.  When you know exactly what happens...the suspense/excitement/apprehension just isn't the same.|`|NE9cJUeWaa	GOSH! It's a gud movie and u know it!!<br>  some indians i know dont like the movie but i think it is awesome<br>  it's not the best, true, but it deserved an award (ahem, but not 8billion)<br>  it was good. my friends havnt seen it yet so we're gonnna go this weekend and again and see it (  i wanna see thier first reaction after seeing it) XD<br>  watch it if u havnt<br>  but it's not worth seeing a billion times like titanic of sumthing.|`|hgMhbaDhaa	i love it<br>  if you don't see you should see it.<br>  it's a really good movie. and jai ho song was too good.<br>  Winner of 8 Oscars OMG... some bollywood actors & actresses so jealous.|`|fada715e923adf0dac1a80022ec10dd7aa	This is a breathless, exciting story, heartbreaking and exhilarating at the same time...<br>  I'll keep this simple: GREAT MOVIE!!!|`|TAdRXsU3aa	i liked the movie but found the second half a bit boring.<br>  on the whole i enjoyed it!|`|MVEAs9fXaa	it was a great movie

This is a turbulent transit, and mistakes that you made in your love life in the past can come back to haunt you now. This transit usually lasts for one to three months, but could occur three times in a year. During this time, you must do your utmost to hold onto everyone you care about. Anyone you meet now is not likely to be your soulmate. <br>  <br>  This is for finances:<br>  This is a Turbulent Transit made by Chiron and normally lasts several months.  This transit is a sign that people around you will focus on what is wrong with you as opposed to what is good about you. This can result in their being disillusioned towards you. Therefore, this is not a good time to seek a new job or push for a promotion. Fortunately, this transit does not nudge people to act on their disillusionment. If you keep your head low, and don't make any waves or make drastic changes, and let the transit pass, you will be okay.<br>  <br>  These are for transits, NOT natal interpretations. As a personal aspect it's a bit different. This is one of the most powerful of all aspects as this  Super Aspect provides the native with a fabulous public image and commanding presence, which instills confidence and wins trust. It foretells great destiny and career and can result in noteworthy success, ultimate intuitive genius, and success through charisma in anything ruled by Chiron. <br>  <br>  Still there is no substitute for hard work persistence, determination and tenacity.

mxoVlSkmaa	hmm theres alot of good one out there .here are a few of mine:<br>  blake shelton<br>  george strait<br>  tim mcgraw<br>  taylor swift<br>  carrie underwood<br>  reba mcentire<br>  conway twiity<br>  loretta lynn<br>  brad paisly|`|9a78f2ed3b9169e0997245e3910a9c35aa	I think vocally you are correct Reba is a greta singer, she has a ton of great music that she has been releasing for decades now and she can really sing, even with out all the gadgetry unlike T. swift who can sing a lick live. and as far as male i would say it probably has to go to George straigh or Clay walker, if you basing it on just singing ability and just dran good music! <br>  BTW i LOOOOVE reba, when i was very little i would sing reba all the time.|`|zm7bCfzKaa	Wow.<br>  There are loads.<br>  I can't even begin to answer this.|`|JcooekLZaa	George Strait, definitely.|`|IWRJuZCiaa	I gotta go with sir george strait also!  i know you disagree, but i think taylor swift is the WORST singer|`|PNTElcxnaa	Half of this sh!t isn't even country.

What about Waylon Jennings?  I also like Montgomery Gentry, Blake Shelton, Carrie Underwood, Gary allan and the like....but that's just my opinion.   I almost forgot George Strait.|`|At7iKpONaa	Hank Williams Sr|`|WaYZQhnHaa	Alan Jackson|`|gRkpFHNzaa	George Strait. after all he hasn't got the most #1's in country music for not singing well.
RgymoiIQaa	Nope. Most radio stations play a little of everything from everywhere. You may try and invest in an I-POD, or buy cd's of your fav artists. I make my own cd's because I can't stand listening to Soulja Boy and then I hate R&B.

Also your venus didn't add up. <br>  It looks like she may do better with someone who is has more air and earth in her chart. While you would do better with someone with more water and fire in  theirs.

YwtXSUAdaa	Britain has a big grime scene. But I'm guessing they appreciate rock music much much more.|`|lkxFy681aa	Rap is annoying, and stupid, imho.<br>  <br>  It takes no talent whatsoever.

Every 'hoody' from the ages 11 upwards does rap.|`|rRCTvT7Saa	Although I'm not English, I'd be willing to bet that the majority of those who are prefer rock...since, you know--rock is the MOST popular genre of all time.|`|Tm9kA5umaa	i like rock personaly|`|lrJopeC5aa	I saw a video of english people bottling 50 cents and his crew so I think they like rock music more, which is another reason to like <br>  England.|`|6Yr3ZH1uaa	I like rock personally but I know ALOT of people that like Rap, alot of younger kids like it moreso than rock I reckon|`|ZRG18vnQaa	The Brits are usually on the cutting edge ,so whatever it is it's probably better thaan 75% of the crap most of us listen to|`|AA11968687	Lol, well just like everywhere else, some people like rap and others like rock, I suppose its half and half.|`|SgtvDDcjaa	I've heard some pretty funny rap/pop coming from Anglo-saxon Brits.|`|zfslaO95aa	Im English and strongly dislike Rap.|`|SHwuzsPyaa	im english and im rollin with my rock|`|98z1KLLiaa	We like both|`|AUONpLLLaa	us englishman hate rap|`|fzxiNxGHaa	English people are more into dance these days which i hate so badly.

I don't know how people feel about Trista, but as all the others who got a show after being dumped on national tv, people raised them up to be so deserving at first-like Deanna and Jason for instance. Then at the end, they end up hating them for choosing whoever they want and doing what they did. So I am ambivalent. People would think Jillian is deserving and wonderful. Then she might do something or say something that will make the audience hate her. None of the relationships have lasted except Trista's so really I don't know. I feel like the show should ended .People just raise their hopes up for whoever they want to win and to have a happy ending-like Trista and Ryan's, then it all comes crashing down in the end. I don't think it is worth it.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	I agree with lisa l >>> after this season I'm pissed at ABC|`|brKxytiXaa	i dont care|`|YP2xuZdtaa	who care|`|wFy80O73aa	I don't think anybody cares about the bachelor/bachelorette BS after what happened this season !!|`|ZxIFKJ8caa	I dont really care about it <br>  after this season i think everyone has realized <br>  that this show SUCKS and is fake|`|cr5TQgmUaa	OMG -- it should be Melissa!!

UK6nWrFaaa	Are you kidding me? He was THE KING OF ROCK AND ROLL! :-) <br>  <br>  Elvis Aaron Presley[1][3] (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977; middle name sometimes written Aron)a was an American singer, actor, and musician. A cultural icon, he is commonly known simply as "Elvis", and is also sometimes referred to as "The King of Rock 'n' Roll" or "The King".<br>  <br>  In 1954, Presley began his career as one of the first performers of rockabilly, an uptempo fusion of country and rhythm and blues with a strong back beat. His novel versions of existing songs, mixing "black" and "white" sounds, made him popular—and controversial[4][5][6]—as did his uninhibited stage and television performances. He recorded songs in the rock and roll genre, with tracks like "Hound Dog" and "Jailhouse Rock" later embodying the style. Presley had a versatile voice[7] and had unusually wide success encompassing other genres, including gospel, blues, ballads and pop. To date, he has been inducted into four music halls of fame.<br>  <br>  In the 1960s, Presley made the majority of his 31 movies—mainly poorly reviewed, but financially successful, musicals.[8] In 1968, he returned to live music in a television special,[9] and performed across the U.S., notably in Las Vegas. Throughout his career, he set records for concert attendance, television ratings and recordings sales.[10] He is one of the best-selling and most influential artists in the history of music. Health problems, drug dependency[11] and other factors led to his death at age 42.|`|ceab655cde9c472548023c0bc1846570aa	Dude! He was the king of rock and roll!!!!

I'm just interested which film you're referring to.|`|vyoKIdzDaa	You could:<br>  <br>  A) Read what happens on wikipedia so then it won't be so sad although it might ruin the movie for you.<br>  <br>  B) Blink alot<br>  <br>  C) Leave to use the bathroom or something during the ending parts  and/or other parts thatlook like they will be sad.<br>  <br>  D) Maybe other people will be crying too<br>  <br>  E) If you think the movie looks bad then just don 't exactly pay attention to it and the sad parts won't seem so sad since you didn't really get into it<br>  <br>  I hope this helped and that you don't look like an idiot.|`|dJfvy8Cvaa	Sit in the back of the class or theater so you're less noticed. <br>  <br>  Pinch yourself, distract yourself, or step out for a minute if you find yourself getting too emotional.|`|27c2d354649c70e87537d2a6d6934df4aa	watch it over and over again before going to class so that u'll get fed up and over with with the sad parts...|`|bn8OZrYSaa	dont pay attention to sad parts and think of suttin happy...or funny...or just excuse urself to the bathroom when it gets too sad..mayb u can explain it to your teacher that ur gonna use the bathroom if it gets too sad.|`|aBqJhdufaa	Listen to you Ipod! Or, just sit next to a guy you like and cry lol things might work out for ya!

I wouldn't care what my friends say!    I have the same problem, i love the jonas bros but my friends like twilight. so what i try to do is not talk about them alot. then they won't talk about twilight. so its ok to tell your friends u like her but talk about hannah montana constanly.   oh, r u going to see the hannah montana movie? i am dying to see it!!!|`|1zTheHOQaa	WHO GIVES ABOUT WHAT YOUR FRIENDS THINK???!!!!<br>  you are you and if you wanna like her you do that girlfriend!!!/ guyfriend (cos ya never know!!!lol) <br>  <br>  in a few years your friends might not even be there anymore but you will still be and you can continue liking whoever you want!!!!!!|`|XqkxsEwXaa	its ur choice ur friends cant decide things for u its ur opinion if u like hannah montann then u like her no big deal my friend whos in 11th grade went and saw a hannah montan concert so if u want to like her then like her who cares and if u dont want ur friends to no then dont tell them|`|EkrfiNDZaa	I personally can't stand Hannah Montana, but if you like her don't listen to your friends. I've had too many times where I let my friends influence my thinking and ended up with a bad decision.|`|jCy0J2ueaa	yah dont let your friends make you feel bad you can like who you want|`|SvzsXddUaa	Um, I don't like her either, but if you do, whatever...|`|sfwfOG0caa	DEFINITELY still like her, be yourself. those girls who dont like her r lame, lol. like what u want to like xxx
uxVIlXlvaa	guitar hero is better if your looking towards more fun gameplay.<br>  rockband if your looking for a better song list.|`|uctxzjIIaa	Rock Band is more of a party game. Guitar Hero is more of a serious challenge.|`|Hiasgb75aa	Guitar Hero.<br>  <br>  But if you have lots of people over Rock Band would be better|`|snBeIxpBaa	I personally prefer Rock Band over Guitar Hero.  The interface is much cleaner, the graphics are sharper, the (not sure of correct term) note bar is a bit easier to read and adjust for calibration.<br>  <br>  <br>  Only downside is that Rock Band is a bit easier compared to Guitar Hero songs ( for guitar and bass on certain songs (mostly due to the solo areas), not a huge deal unless you play a LOT like I used to).<br>  <br>  <br>  Play both... see which one you like and pick it.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Also an amazing feature Rock Band 2 added (not sure of GH utilized it yet) is the No-Fail Mode.  Basically it's a more realistic practice with all the status/starpower effects to max your score and complete the song.   (Perfect on mastering songs or having friends/family play who are pretty pathetic at it.  lol)|`|RQyRhUqKaa	Guitar Hero!!!|`|UMjOnIdHaa	I used to have Guitar Hero and have Rock Band now. Rock Band is better.|`|Bdgza4G2aa	While I am more of a DDR fan, I would recommend that you would buy Guitar Hero.|`|0pUkVcGIaa	Rockband has a lot more songs. I heard that Rockband 2 and Guitar Hero4 have mostly the same songs.Guitar Hero 3 has a lot of good songs but some of them can be downloaded for Rockband. Over all i say the best is Rockband 2|`|7c41d0650d2d056239986df304fa0bb4aa	guitar hero has more options:<br>  <br>  I, II, III Legends of Rock, Aerosmith, World Tour|`|7Ct6z23Vaa	Guitarrrrrr Herooooooooo~!!! :D :D|`|nMKBhkJOaa	GUITAR HERO is TONS better than rockband|`|f7095485d21d33c40e2083347fe706bbaa	rockband!|`|c7203e40b721b8790cef4c9dce7b6520aa	I'm All For Guitar Hero!
