4biGrjPkaa	No. It sounds to me like your timing belt has snapped. Don't turn it over til you check the belt is ok.    The "whine" is the starter turning the crankshaft but because there's no resistance caused by compression it's spinning easily.    I really hope it isn't this - but if it is, pray you haven't done too much damage.      EDIT: This info you've been given is incorrect, the starter engages onto the flywheel, which is in turn attached to the clutch, gearbox and final drive, hence why the car will move - NOTHING to do with the timing belt being in place or not!!! Take off the timing cover and visually check the belt. And you have also just answered your initial question - Theres nothing wrong with the starter!    I am 99.9% sure that the belt has snapped by the info you've provided here.    The more often you turn over the engine the more damage you could be doing if I am right.|`|d737ea63327b6a7be9b660b3cc16cd04aa	Hi there, putting it in gear will not test timing /camshaft belt, as the bottom end of engine will still turn but camshaft will not. you will find that you can pull back top to timing belt cover then as you have been trying to start engine a bit the damage will have already been done to valves get some one to turn engine over in spurts if it turns cam belt ok. another way To test if your distributor is on end of camshaft then take cover off to   see if it turns when cranking engine if not then cam belt broken or camshaft broken. if belt is broken then there is a chance no damage has been done if the belt broke when pistons were level or not at top of firing line. jock
BsMkp3nPaa	it varies from state to state. 35% is max in NY for any drivers windows and none is allowed on the windshield. i've had 20% for years and not been bothered by cops. they do sell  5% though.|`|1SnI86BIaa	5%    but you are gonna get pulled over..

BUT you can buy (relatively cheap.....when I say relatively, I mean you better buy this if you want the real thing and not a knock off) buy a nice exhaust system from Edelbrock, K&N, any brand like that....there's your cheapest option from owning a real turbo.
16e604597351b1d4d43ff369db4e0821aa	The jetta is a sophisticated car. if this is your first VW there are things to know, like the cars required maintenance. You need to use fully synthetic oil and it is needed depending on the engine every 5k or 10k. The money you save in oil changes will be spent in the larger required maintenance's like the 20k, 40k, and 60k mile maintances. the jetta if properly maintaned can last a very long time and be the greatest car you will ever own.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Yes!|`|fdTgA1Svaa	Great car. bought my first one a few months ago, and I'll buy another one.

German feel from a vehicle built in either Mexico or Brazil. BMW is a little pricey unless you get a real old one. You should get a 94 Camry like Apoclipce and put after market stuff on it to get an extra 2 hp. Buy the Jetta if you like it, not what other people think. Thats why there is a lot of car manufactures. They look classy because its a german company that uses a lot of design from Audi.|`|YDIWhciCaa	VW is the most problematic German car period.

Lbulud8raa	IF it is a diesel truck,lamp oil or vegetable oil is a possibility.    If you know a recipe for biodisel, all the ingredients were available then, though you would have to develop a process of production.    Grain alcohol is usually too high in water, and petrol engines do poorly on it for any length of time.    Oh, and your would have to avoid probably being condemned for demon worship or something because you and your "noble steed" would hardly fit in.

Looks like you need to change the oil pump or the engine. or else your life will plum it without a car.|`|hgmgH83Xaa	NO, it's not the oil, it's something internal...either a sensor or the pump. Change the oil still, and then take it to a mechanic to get the vehicle diagnostics.|`|AHEFXgE7aa	Changing the oil is a good place to start.  If the problem continues, then it is the pump, leak, or something else.    Cheers
XKYJk6Tcaa	this sounds since it is doing it on both cold and hot starts that you have a worn timing belt which could have slipped on tooth on the belt. it would still run and run good when warm except for the starting problems, or it could be as simple as a clogged injector if EFI or a clogged filter if carburated. I would suggest checking the filters. or injectors which ever it is.
AA12083470	I don't know anything about the nail polish, but most insurance companies will pay for it.  It's cheaper to fix that than pay for you a new windshield.

As stated, shift into neutral when stopped.|`|y1hfGpQlaa	That is probably the motor mounts.  When they go out, the engine will vibrate when you are at a standstill and in Drive.  If you don't want to spend the cash to get it fixed, slip it into neutral while sitting at a stoplight.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	most likey  a bad spark plug or just need a fuel treatmnet|`|pRuLTF9iaa	Only if your car is on the older side:  after a while all cars usually produce an idle rattle where the vibrations from the engine at idle speed shake bolts and nuts and all sorts of things. it happens at idle because that is at the engine speed the car is at most often. (so basically your car gets tired of shaking at the same speed for a long time.) the reason why it goes away in park is because the engine revs up a little more in park (because it has less of a load).   to test this theory put your car in drive and one foot on the brake and one foot on the gas and have the engine rev up a little. if the shaking goes away then that's your problem. i'd just put up with it if i were you but if you really want to do something about it then there go to a mechanic and have him turn up your idle speed (by adjusting the fuel injection).  Good Luck

AA11584457	Every car is different, depends on which Nissan you have.  Assuming you have a low end 4-cylinder car, the usual way to start is "2", but you have to learn your car's torque curves first, which there is some point on the tachometer where it'll stop producing enough power to "boost" your car (it starts pulling in less air/fuel because the valves are moving too fast) so redline isn't always the best way to go.|`|AA12171371	automatics are gay, there only for lazy people espically americans, a manual u have more control of the car

Sounds like the oil was slung out of the bottom of the engine (crankcase main seal).  The oil gets slung around inside the motor.  Give it 10 minutes to settle before checking.  Good luck.

I beleive your new at this maybe hey. but first locate the dip stick to see if it needs oil with the engine of check the dip stick for the oil. if it does need some then look for the oil tube ; it will say oil on the cap if no cap it goes into the valve cover. if you cant figure this all out. then go to a full service station and have them check your oil. but watch what they do dont sit in the car its rather simple once you do it once|`|AA10653733	In the engine...|`|AA10757538	figure out where the key goes and go to a quick lube place before u drain the oil in the first place|`|99f0da46105d644313af8bedb056accdaa	look on the valve covers for oil plug|`|AA10626536	sorry but maybe im wrong but it sounds like maybe u meant its loseing oil or burning oil  if so look 4 leakage  if nothing is found it could be burning oil look 4 blue smoke out the tail pipe when u first start it up and then it gose away it could be valve seals but if it smokes when u step on it or all the time chances r bad rings r to blam hope this helped
b222f6f81b233d1213c47636b8bb010eaa	Perch  un aeromobile in cui il sostentamento e la propulsione sono prodotti da una o pi grandi eliche a passo variabile, chiamate rotori, azionate da motori. L'asse di rotazione dei rotori  verticale o subverticale e, a volont del pilota, la giacitura del loro piano di rotazione pu essere variata: ne consegue che, quando il piano di rotazione non  orizzontale, la linea di azione della forza aerodinamica sviluppata dal rotore  inclinata rispetto alla verticale e presenta quindi una componente orizzontale, che assicura la propulsione dell'elicottero, e una componente verticale (paragonabile alla portanza di un comune velivolo) che ne assicura il sostentamento. Un elicottero pu pertanto, oltre che decollare ed atterrare verticalmente, spostarsi lungo la verticale e anche rimanere fermo a mezz'aria: se si inclina il piano di rotazione del rotore rispetto all'orizzonte, l'elicottero pu muoversi in qualsiasi direzione, cio avanzare, retrocedere e spostarsi lateralmente. Le pale dei rotori hanno una cerniera che consente di variarne il passo e di conseguenza la portanza o forza sostentatrice. In caso di arresto del motore (piantata motore) i rotori in autorotazione consentono di eseguire una planata e l'elicottero si comporta come un autogiro cos da permettere al pilota di effettuare un atterraggio forzato. Data la coppia del motore la fusoliera deve sopportare una coppia di reazione, pari a quella motrice trasmessa al rotore, la quale deve essere compensata perch farebbe ruotare la fusoliera in senso opposto al moto del rotore. La compensazione si ottiene mediante un piccolo rotore a passo variabile, ad asse orizzontale e trasversale, posto all'estremit posteriore della fusoliera e collegato al motore; in tal modo  possibile regolare la rotazione dell'elicottero attorno al suo asse verticale.|`|1783de5e78443e7fa77605306ea630aeaa	Dipende che fenicotteri.. quelli normali o quelli rosa perch quelli normali non hanno le pale come l'elicottero invece quelli rosa ce le hanno e volano anche meglio di un'elicottero perch sono stupidi..  spero di essere stato esauriente|`|c068ce62fc876c5ef1bfb09925856ae8aa	si :/|`|65c7e8cd373e5d15008026758db98355aa	Mi sa che non c'entrano molto l'un con l'altro...|`|05eac3da20118e32c08c4fe4c053e407aa	no..........ke c'entra|`|269b7ee0bd07e49f0ec44f05f02e667faa	Eh....come no...???

AA11285210	Most after market brands tend to be of better quality and if you plan on keeping the car for awhile, some auto parts stores offer life time warranties on certain parts which means you never have to pay for the part again. On the bad side, the labor is not covered. Original factory parts from the dealership usaully cost way more ( sometimes twice as much) than what you pay at an auto parts store. Sometimes the auto parts store will offer two parts, one with 30 day warranty and another with lifetime for a few more dollars. Unless your car is a collector item I'd have no issue on buying from a auto parts store. I buy all my parts from auto parts stores unless the part can't be found. Parts store are usually very easy to work with and very helpful. Another suggestion is to pull one off a wrecked car at a wrecking yard, just make sure the car has had no front damage that might have damaged the CV joint part you need. You'll get it for practically nothing. An auto parts store might even be able to tell you which other models use the same part number.|`|AA10968929	You mean other than what the dealership sells?If you want quality good stuff, go to NAPA auto parts.

61f8fbfe35a122f2e93f3aa921dabdc2aa	As you may have guessed from the lack of interest ( 9 hrs. & i'm the 2nd answer) in your question the mini-van era is kinda dead.  The main reason for this lack of interest is the newer style of what is now being called 'Crossover Vehicles'.    (i.e. Freestyle - Pacifica - Rendevous - Highlander )  These are vehicles that offer: mini-van seating ( 7 passenger); luxury carlike feel ; and somewhat like an SUV, and are usually available in front wheel drive , like most minivans or all wheel drive or 4x4 like SUV"S    Thats good news for you because you appear to be looking for a pre owned mini-van !  Many people are trading in their "old faithful' minivans for the newer styles & technology.    Check out your local New Car Dealers for their recent trade ins    Most dealers have their own websites so you can pre shop from home & then go visit the dealers that have vehicles of interest .

AA12173799	you've pretty much answered your own question!    you'll need to do a little research to detemine whether the suspension leg to hub mounts are the same size on both models- easiest to do this at a vw breaker.    the drive flange (which has the five holes) is the main requirement, but the wheel bearings could well be bigger on a GTi so you may need the entire hub and outer cv joint. cv's are normally interchangeable between different models/driveshafts so should be a simple swap. although im guessing you want to do this to fit different wheels, it also opens up the possibility of upgrading your brakes too.     if you buy the job lot off a GTi it would be advisable to change the wheel bearings while its stripped down.    hope this helps

As leis da fsica que permitem que os avi?es voem j eram conhecidas no sculo anterior, quando o sui?o Bernouilli construiu o teorema dos fluidos.    Santos Dumont foi batizado de o Pai da Avia??o pelos franceses, que adoram heris e chamaram Pel de o Rei do Futebol.    Acontece que Dumont ganhou um prmio por ser o primeiro homem (conhecido na Fran?a) a fazer uma aeronave decolar por meios prprios.    Ele havia estado na China e viu pipas voando e muito bem. As asas do 14 BIS imitam essas pipas e, por sorte, o 14 BIS j reproduzido hoje consegue voar alguns metros.    Mas Dumont s conseguiu sucesso mesmo foi quando ele aplicou os conhecimentos de outros no Demoiselle, que tem asas aerodinamicas, fuselagem e uma empenagem (o conjunto da cauda) que deu estabilidade  maquininha.    Mas, como ele sofreu com motores e hlices que n?o tinham bom rendimento!!!    Dumont tem inestimvel valor histrico pela sua persistncia e pelo seu amor  arte de voar.

0958343e003e258bad95a86e4959364daa	premesso che dipende dal tipo di moto che vuoi (se enduro o da strada), credo che passare dal 350 al 400 non abbia senso, sia per u ndiscorso di maggiori spese di tassa di propriet, sia per l'assicurazione... non avendo magari alcun beneficio. Un buon 350 (per esempio il ducati 350 superlight)  decisamente meglio di un 400 (per quei pochi che ancora puoi trovarne tra marche semisconosciute o fra husqvarna o ktm). Se vuoi buttarti su una moto "tranquilla" da viaggio ad un buon rapporto qualit prezzo ti consiglierei la honda deauville... con meno di 9000 euro nuova la prendi...e ci macini chilometri senza problemi (la ho avuta e posso garantirti comodit e durata).

f70a060e0c73b826dbd3b26e0166429caa	The Parisienne is a kinda cool car. My mom use to have one. It has a 350 chevy eng. You should be able to get another engine for around $600 bucks. Doubtful it's worth that much though. I wouldn't give you $100 for the car running. It's 20 years old.    The oil pump better not be pumping oil to the pistons. you would be having problems then.    First remove the distributor and make sure the shaft isn't rounded off at the bottom end (or broken)  Then remove the oil pressure sending unit.(so you can watch for results).  Then put the shaft in the hole without the distributor and attach a drill to the upper end and crank it pretty fast. That should turn the oil pump. If it doesn't turn you'll need a new pump.    If it does turn and the eng has oil, it should shoot out of the hole where the sending unit came from. If oil does come out of that little hole, you don't need an oil pump and you just saved about $200.    best fo luck to ya.|`|4d5abd9d3f1435ccc1fbd2eb346c7b25aa	Use your yellow pages...|`|3be0cc39b711ff02aa8df3807108ad5aaa	need more information regarding why you need your exhaust fixed what are the symptoms and so forth , all in all this car is not worth fixing in my opinion...so hopefully you can get another vehicle.

What scares me is the need for an oil pump. Light coming on? Engine noisy? Either may indicate something other than the oil pump.    The V-6's in those years actually had the pump gears located inside the timing cover and usually the timing cover was so badly scored you needed to replace the whole timing cover.

f1810ce0f1d95af18a46906e0c47d198aa	if you can't get it to bleed the air out, that means that the line is getting air into it from a crack possibley, or the little valve on the back of the caliper is not shutting off all the way and your getting air in there. Close the valve and pump the brakes for a few times hard. then inspect every inch of that line for leaks...    It is also possible that the lines ARE bled  and the brake caliper piston is stuck.....  on a 92 it is possible that the piston is stuck,  especially if you live up north where they salt the roads a lot in the winter.|`|AA10346371	If this car has drum brakes in the rear:  The automatic brake adjuster that is located between the bottom of the brake shoes may be improperly installed, too far out of adjustment, or sticking.    If drum brakes are too far out of adjustment, the pistons inside the brake cylinder on that wheel extend too far and the brake pedal feels spongy.  If the brake shoes don't contact the brake drum, the automatic brake adjuster doesn't work.    Remove the brake adjuster.  Unscrew the two halves.  Apply a touch of disk brake caliper pin grease to the threads.  Reassemble the brake adjuster. Wipe off any excess grease.     Reinstall the the brake adjuster.  Check the installation of the brake adjuster for proper installation, it is possible to install this part backwards and it won't work.    Adjust the brake shoes until they just start to contact the brake drum, then back it off a little.    Back the car up and sharply apply the brakes. Repeat this process a few times. This actuates the automatic brake adjuster.|`|2f99cf76d030b46405faf276e4d95865aa	let it gravity feed. If your not getting anything down there something is plugged up. or the master cyclinder is not full yet|`|5ec5eff2026e2fa2132b5dd8658261bbaa	Sounds like air stuck in the system somewhere.  Is fluid coming out of the line ok?  Continuous air bubbles means a leak somewhere.  Check the fittings on the master cylinder for leaks, as well as replace the bleeder screw.  Get a Mighty Vac at the auto parts store, you'll get a much better bleed with that - might get out some stubborn air bubbles (ask me how I know this).  If you have a stuck piston and a good bleed, you'll typically get a hard pedal, not a soft one.  If it's drum rear and you replaced shoes/cylinder, you may want to take that drum back apart and make sure everything stayed together when you put it together. Good luck, hope you figure it out.

Le versioni Goal, rispetto allallestimento da cui derivano, sono caratterizzate da una dotazione pi completa e da un prezzo di listino inferiore nel caso di Golf. Ad esempio offre in pi cerchi in acciaio 6,5Jx16 con pneumatici 205/55 R16 (anziche 6Jx15 con gomme 195/68 R15), il climatizzatore Climatic, il sintolettore CD/MP3 con telecomando e ingresso USB frontale, il volante a tre razze rivestito in pelle con personalizzazione Goal (mmmm) e la finitura con lo stesso materiale anche per impugnatura del freno a mano e pomello del cambio, mentre per quanto riguarda l'estetica esterna offre le maniglie e i listelli paracolpi su paraurti e portiere in tinta con la carrozzeria, e per la scritta Goal sul montante posteriore. Rispetto alla Golf normale la Golf plus  piu' spaziosa all'interno ed ha una posizione dei sedili piu' rialzata pur mantenendo una dinamica di altissimo livello.

d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa	are you asking about the acronym FOB, or are you asking about a key fob?    If a fob, it's a word, not an acronym.    http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q...    fob (1)  n.   1. A small pocket at the front waistline of a man's trousers or in the front of a vest, used especially to hold a watch.  2. a. A short chain or ribbon attached to a pocket watch and worn hanging in front of the vest or waist.   2. b. An ornament or seal attached to such a chain or ribbon.       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOB    FOB:  A key fob is a chain used to secure a pocket watch to an article of clothing, or any ornament that hangs from such a chain. This includes items hanging off a keychain. The term is also used when referring to electronic security key devices.      If you are looking for the acronym, with regards to shipping:  Free on Board  Freight on Board  Forward Operating Base  other common uses include:  Fall Out Boy (a music group)  Fecal Occult Blood  Family Owned Business  Fresh Off the Boat  etc.  http://www.acronymfinder.com/FOB.html  http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/FO...|`|ccOJn7q8aa	F*** Off B*tch|`|cCWXnGKlaa	Free On Board|`|jR6QWSfraa	fresh of the boat. witch is mean new in the country|`|cXtEx98Haa	Yes, could be fresh off the boat, but the very much used term in commerce is, as others have said, Free on Board.  The key though is what it says after that:      "F.O.B. shipper" means title to goods passes to buyer when seller transmits them to a carrier.  The buyer must pay the cost of freight.    "F.O.B. destination" means title passes to buyer upon arrival at buyer's place of business.  Seller pays the cost of the freight.|`|Sme8zvmDaa	It means Free On Board, meaning that the sender's liability is limited to sending out the goods till they get sent on board the ship / plane.

This isn't a car they can sell retail. Too old, too many miles to put out on their lot.     You need to put a sign in the window and an ad on Craigslist and sell it yourself.  There are a lot of people who would give real money for a 10 year old Honda that runs good.  On the open market that car is probably worth $2500.  But trading it in is the wrong thing to do.|`|oTSB5BITaa	A new car dealer would immediately turn a car that old over to a wholesaler, so they would check with a few of them and give you, in trade value, whatever the highest amount is that they can get for it. The amount they tell you they are giving you would also include the amount that they will discount whatever it is your buying even if you didn't have a trade.     The "book" trade amount is about $400 to $500, depending on the trim level (DX,LX,EX).

You can make a major slickrock crawler, and still have it light enough to trailer behind your Exploder.    Don't flame me for calling it an Exploder, that's my aunt's name for them and she calls it that from bitter, difficult experience.

AA11486394	I would think it would. It depends on the trunk opening more so than the size of the trunk. Case in point is the 1993 - 03 or 04 mustangs: the trunk was big enough to accomodate a good size box but the opening of the trunk sucked and you couldnt get things in it. you had to build a small box or build the box into the trunk.     The dimensions you gave sound reasonable and without seeing the car, I'd say you have a great chance of it working. If you have the car, go out and take some measurements. that's the easiest way to know. Measure the opening of the trunk. If it will fit into it, then measure the trunk and see.     A better question would be "will this type of enclosure work as good as it should in such a small trunk?" There are many good enclosure styles out there but some are too big for certain applications and by cramming them into a trunk space, there may not be enough space for the output of the speaker to actually work at it's fullest potential. Just food for thought...

be6674426e6ea8f6e7dd3bbd8f7368eeaa	I tire gets its traction by forming itself to the ground it rests on.  Very tiny bits of rubber get torn from the tire as it rolls causeing wear.  Miss alignment, aggressive driving and improper inflation can accelerate this process.|`|922b2f86395f5c944bd4c89ebfe77fabaa	Treads and tire wear  The grooves or treads found in most tires are there to improve contact between the tire and the road in wet conditions. Without such grooves, the water on the surface of the road would be unable to escape out to the sides of the wheel as the tire presses down onto the road. This causes a thin layer of water to remain between the road and the tire's surface, which causes a severe loss of grip. At higher speeds, this can cause hydroplaning, substantially reducing traction during braking, cornering and hard acceleration. The grooves in the tread provide an escape path for the water - and it is even claimed by some tire manufacturers that their tread pattern is designed to actively pump water out from under the tire by the action of the tread flexing.    If the road is dry, tire treads actually reduce grip since they reduce the contact area between the rubber and the road. For this reason treadless or 'slick tires' are often used in motor racing when the track is known to be smooth and dry. If it should rain unexpectedly during the race these slick tires can cause a dangerous loss of grip - which is why they are seldom used on conventional road cars. Another technique to improve traction is to use a softer rubber in the treads so that they mould themselves to the shape of the road surface. Since the rubber is softer when warm, race pit crews may even employ tire heaters to keep new tires at the optimum temperature until they are to be driven on. Soft compound rubber would also improve traction in street vehicles, but it is seldom used because these tires wear out too quickly for normal use.    The depth of the tread grooves is an important part of car safety but that depth gradually reduces due to wear throughout the lifetime of a tire. When the tread on the outer perimeter of the tire wears away, reducing the tread depth, the tire should be replaced. Many countries have laws regulating the minimum tread depth on road vehicles and most modern road tires have built-in tread wear indicators. These take the form of small blocks of rubber moulded into the bottoms of the grooves of the tread at intervals around the tire. When the tread has worn down until the tops of those blocks are level with the top of the tread - then the tire needs to be replaced. If these blocks are not present, a tire tread depth gauge should be used to measure the depth.    In most vehicles, either the front or rear tires will wear faster than the others. Having mismatched tread depths can alter the handling of the car in unacceptable ways - so it is generally advisable to swap the front and rear tires as they wear down to even out the wear patterns. This is called rotating the tires. If the vehicle's suspension is somewhat out of adjustment, it is also possible for the tires to wear more on one side than the other - so it may also be beneficial to rotate the tires from one side of the car to the other - however, careful attention should be paid to the owner's manual since some vehicles require particular tire rotation patterns. Notably, some tires are designed to provide best traction only when spinning in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. In such cases one must not rotate the tires from one side of the car to the other because that would put a 'clockwise tire' onto a wheel that turns in a counter-clockwise direction (and vice versa). Such tires typically have an arrow moulded into the sidewall to indicate the preferred direction.|`|443acaf0c51ffc6f4c0a15a342d062b8aa	Just from driving they wear out. Going over bumps, putting on breaks fast, running over nails, etc.|`|0b3fbec81c200f3999c93c88fb0e0957aa	many things cause tires to wear, the number one being friction.  Tires "grab" the road as you drive, that's why you notice the two dark ruts in the road from the rubber.    when you make turns, the friction and force increase and causes more rubber to wear off.    and lastly, "peeling off" causes the most tire wear. When you see the black marks on the road from someone braking too hard or squalling tires, just think of all the money they left on the asphalt given the cost of tires today.|`|AA11613165	Friction.    Without friction, there would be no wear and the trick to keep your tyres as long as possible is to minimize friction while maximizing traction. HAH! Those are actually contradicting terms. The more traction you have, the more your tire is "sticking" to the ground ergo the more friction you have.    That's why tires will always wear! However, if you keep them well inflated and well balanced and your wheels well aligned, you will minimize friction and your tires will last longer.    Then again, if you peel out of your driveway and burn rubber all the time, don't expect much life out of your tires!!!!

Certo, l'esame sar facile, per dopo sei limitato nel caso tu abbia voglia di passare ad una moto vera e propria.

If nothing else you will have to get a new paint job....sorry.|`|03ee34907dadd3ce913135c53012c9bfaa	You should be able to take it to a body shop or a professional detailer and have them buff it out, as long as the scratches are not through the clear coat and down to the base coat. Buffing actually uses very fine abrasives that remove some of the paint material, that is why if the scratches are too deep they cannot be buffed out because you will have to buff all the way down to the base coat which is dull. I would guess that egg shells probably just did some light surface scratching and possibly discolored the clear coat which should not be too bad to buff out.|`|629e867375311ebc649080edf539026eaa	What was it an osterich or dinosaur egg?

They can usually buff them out.  The way it works is that the buffer geets hot enough that is almost slowly moves or melts the paint into the scratch, its kind of wierd.    Either that or you can make a mess of a job at it with some touch up paint from your dealer which I dont suggest.

If you smell gasoline then the rings are bad, they are allowing gasoline to blow by into the oil instead of compressing it for power.    You could pull each spark plug and check the color.

5e8bfd4f40a66f73272a2b251c8d304daa	First off, the motorways are the safest roads in Britain.  They have the lowest accident rate per mile driven, than any other type of road.    Secondly, remember that lorries are electronically limited by law to 56mph.  Try to keep going at least 60mph, or you will feel intimidated by them.    Read the Highway Code again and study the section on motorway driving.    Try to get a bit more motorway practice before the journey.  This will help you to get used to it.    Observation - it's the most important thing for any driver to remember and even more so on a motorway.  Keep checking ahead, behind and alongside at all times.    Don't panic - it's all about practice and building confidence in yourself and your driving ability.  Take care!|`|FQrl1Azbaa	the motorways around manchester are not so bad.     give yourself plenty of time for the journey.    plan time for a break.    don't travel between 8 and 9 in the morning!    you should be fine.

Sometimes, the 2 hour lessons can be a little long and drawn out but its all up to how you feel.|`|E8k3sERAaa	do a mixture 2 hour lessons were to long for me at the start,but one you get more confident the 2 hours will fly cause you enjoy it more and you will get more experience doing 2 hours. it worked for me passed my test this morning.    good luck.

The responsibility of the company is to ensure that all parts of the vehicle are in working order before it is sold to you.  It was obviously an oversight on the manufacturer's part.  What you need to do is bring this case to the attention of the company that sold you the vehicle.  You have an option, you can sue for damages right away, or you can go the company file a complaint, and see if they will reimburse for damages.  If they won't give you any compensation for their failures then sue them.  You as the customer have a right to sue that company because they are at fault for selling you a faulty vehicle.  Just make sure you have the right evidence to make your claim, otherwise you have nothing against them.

If NHTSA determines it is not a safety defect, that's life. But if NHTSA determines there really is a safety defect, being out of the warranty period makes no difference, NHTSA can force a recall.     3.

For all you know they deployed before, and the laws in many places do not require the replacement of airbags when the car is repaired.  You give no details of the accident.  Many accidents are ones in which the airbags do not deploy because of the angle of the hit.  In some cases, where you hit at a certain angle, an airbag would pretty much ensure a broken neck.  An airbag is also of no use in a roll-over, and could cause more injury than it would prevent.  It is rare to have airbags not deploy because of defect.  It is usual for airbags to not deploy because the hit was not at an angle that trips the sensors.  People have this mistaken perception that airbags should always go off.  Truth is, if they went off in every accident, there would be more injuries.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	Airbags only deploy under specific types of collisions and at certain speeds.

Some people may like a body kit on a car, and other people may hate that same look. It all just depends on your preference. The best looking cars are usually those which people have spent ALOT of time and money on. The cheap jobs never look as good. ANY car can be modified to look different. wether it's good or not just depends on your taste.

Or your local tax office may be able to help you.  Many states you can get out of state temporary tags to allow you to transport the vehicle to a different state.   I bought a vehicle in Fla, but from a dealer, and they gave me a temporary tag to drive it up north.  So it seems they should be available to a private seller, either at a local DMV or local tax office.    Don't under any circumstances let him take your plate.  It isn't just the fact that he may not mail them back to you.  But they are yours.  If he never titles or registers it in his state, and has an accident with your plates, whoops..if he gets a ticket with your plates...whoops.  it will all be your responsibility!!   Take the tags off, turn them into your local DMV office or Tax office and get a receipt for them.  Then   cancel your insurance on that car.

Yahoo does not involve itself in the transfer of funds - EVER    I am guessing you found a car on Craigslist, Autotrader, Kijiji or some other site.  The price was very low compared to others of the same year/make/model.  The seller is in another country, either with teh militray or a job transfer.  They are selling the car cheap because they need fast cash.  They want you to deposit the money in Yahoo Autos or some similar "account".  (Note:  They are bogus accounts).  They will pay for freight to ship the car.  YOu have a few days to look it over.  If you are unhappy, you can cancel the transaction and get a full reund.

Think from your head and not your heart when you make up your mind and most of all listen to your parents on what they have to say. Like the other person said, replacement parts are high (Honda Civics are no better even if you could find one for $3000)! If you get one that has a standard transmission then it would be better than an auto-matic. When automatic transmission go out and you buy a rebuilt one I can tell you for a fact that the rebuilt ones only last about a year to a year and a half (Maybe you should ask if the transmission is rebuilt if it is an automatic). If you got something like a Focus (I know they aint pretty) but parts are cheaper and they are ez to work on and you could get into one for around $3500.00 with 50 to 75 thousand miles on them, plus they get 30 to 35 per gallon of gas. Goodluck with your search! You don't need to leave feedback on my answer I really don't care. I just want to help folks out when I can.|`|PRx6j6YQaa	whatever car you buy have it checked out by a mechanic well worth the money|`|DV4xyeChaa	eclipse will kill you in parts/labor.....for 3K go get a nice honda civic|`|JkTGq2BJaa	There are 2 ways to look at a car purchase a car.1) buy a newer low mileage car with a payment you know you will need to make every month or 2)buy a cheaper car with allot of miles and pray for the best. If your handy and can do allot or repairs yourself you may go with the second choice but keep 1 thing in mind. Manufacturers put a warranty on new cars and even they break, they are machines and any machine can break at any time if it is used for things not intended for it to be used for. A lower end used car is a good option like a kia or hyundai with low miles but if you get a better car, expect higher price or higher miles. I sold cars for 17 years and told my customers 1 thing. I didn't earn your money for you, so i can't tell you how to spend it.

A licensed instructor is therefore not required but nevertheless would be a good idea to be sure you are being properly taught.  You don't want to pick up bad habits so early in your career.    You don't need a degree in aviation to become a pilot.  It won't really be an advantage to obtaining a job as a pilot.  Major in a subject you love so you'll have have a career you enjoy if you end up not being a pilot.    As long as you asked I'll recommend Parks College of Saint Louis University.  Several good friends of mine teach there.  There are many other good ones.|`|DvlwN9kdaa	Find a glider operation, and solo when you're 14.|`|fZjgIE9Baa	You need a flight instructor to always be in the aircraft with you before you fly solo.   To become an airline pilot:  First off, college. Not all airlines require a degree. Several of the "regional" airlines don't require a degree. However, most of the "majors" do. So where do you want to end up? Charter flying and other corporate flying has a policy on a per-company basis. But if you have it, it may put you ahead of someone who doesn't.    Air Force.  You'll be committed to them for no less than 10 years. Are you prepared to devote that time? Not to mention you'll be IN the military and may have to deploy, fight, and possibly pay the ultimate sacrifice. It may be for you, it may not.    If you do choose college, then the question is do you chose an "aviation university" or not. Aviation Universities include Embry Riddle, Auburn University, along with many more. OR, you can choose to attend an "airline academy" which will be independent of a 4 year degree but will have you ready from start to ready for an airline interview in XX number of days/months.  These include Delta Connection Academy     Anyway, to be competitive for a regional airline right now you will ultimately need (in terms of flight experience) your Commercial Multi Airplane license with an Instrument rating at probably AT LEAST 800 hours of flight time of which at least 100 hours should be in a multi-engine airplane.    If you go to one of the academy's be prepared to spend around $25,000 up front (or within a few months) to get that commercial multi.... Other wise, if you obtain the licenses/ratings as you go the following will become familiar terms to you:  -- Private Pilot License  -- Instrument Rating  -- Commercial License  -- Multi-Engine license/add-on  -- Certified Flight Instructor (CFI)  -- Certified Flight Instructor Instrument (CFII)  -- Advanced Ground Instructor (AGI)  -- Multi-Engine Flight Instructor (MEI)    I would also recommend www.aopa.org to investigate learning to fly. If you do go to a local flight school, I recommend something called a "Discovery Flight."    The list goes on. If you want to ask specific questions, feel free to send me an email.|`|4ca3u9Bkaa	I strongly suggest you watch this video before you sink $60,000+ into your pilot training. You'll see in the video, pilots start earning about $17,000 a year (less than working in a grocery store) and then salaries go up very slowly. It will only be after 10-15 years that you MIGHT be making over $80,000... unless you join the Air Force.    http://youtube.com/watch?v=RayMaswju1A
p5IjD7tnaa	Hello    The first ones were round.And Silk.  Ladies Knickers during the War, Ask your mum.    Then they found that by cutting the silk with a big L at the back and just to the right of centre and then reversed this on the left side you got a forward speed of 10-15 MPH _I I_so you got more control Ideal was face into a 10-15 mph wind. This was called the Double L. If you then cut out the Bottom so the 2 L's were connected this increased the Forward motion and was called a Double T. TT Upside down.  The reserve chutes were not fitted with these as they were smaller life savers.  I  did 4 parachute jumps as a hobby whilst in the Army.on the last one one of the cords which hang below the chute and connects to your harness decided to throw it's self over the top of my chute,  So I had to release the Main Chute and come down on reserve.  Pulled every ligament in my right leg.  Support bandage and Light duties for 5 months but in the Army you still got paid.  I am now medically banned from parachuting as if I do the same again now I would Rip them out and be crippled for life.  I had a perfectly good leg after 5 months so the reserve did its job.  If you imagine a balloon blown up and knot dangling down then because it is full of air that cannot escape, It will alter the shape slightly if you push both sides.  If you push in the side of a Double L chute then the air will spill out of the bottom.  A chute requires a certain amount of air to be trapped for it's designated maximum load.  As it is only air pressure that keeps the chute in shape.  Any deformation that you are unable to equalise and the side will keep collapsing inwards and the chute fail.    Andy C

757e78bde7eb7788631ba662452e9409aa	Try checking the brake fluid in the reserve under the hood. If it is low then all the fluid could be moving back when you hit the pedal to accelerate causing the light to come on. There should be a full line on the side of the tank. Hope this helps!|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	check the brake fluid check for a vaccum leak a round brake booster|`|Gb19X3xVaa	That is really weird and it is probably a Ford.  Found ON Rode DEAd.|`|8e1fdf4cefa581a57ec81fd9d7c68728aa	If the rear brake lights on the car are coming on, you have some electrical problems and I doubt anybody here can tell you exactly what is happening,    If the brake warning light is coming on then you probably have either low brake fluid or a bad brake fluid bad sensor.|`|jnG8sOzWaa	it can mean one of two things,   either you cant drive and don't know which is the gas and which is the brake or the car is broken|`|HUluAQM3aa	Year of car, make, mileage, model and engine size are handy items to include with your question BTW.    Brake lights on the back of the car?  Brake warning light on the dash?  Low brake fluid.    If the fluid is low in the resivoir then when you accelerate the fluid is being acted upon and allows the level sensor to send a signal to the dash light.  You let off the gas and the fluid settles and the light goes out.    Common and typical if your brake fluid is low.|`|AA11603810	Seems to me like there are some wires crossed...|`|f5ibT3WNaa	You could be low on brake fluid but also the brake light switch could be acting up too.|`|eefdd2d971d42ad1ee9556089354b3dfaa	that happens to me in VW's, my big foot hit's both petals at the same time..
a70d82417eb7a74192f967dcdc832b20aa	Possibly a lockup solenoid problem.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	sounds like the idle. maybe the idle air control sensor is bad.|`|DV4xyeChaa	IF its tuned and not just running badly [cant idle] it may b tranny locking up...got fluid?|`|f5ibT3WNaa	Sounds like it might need a tune-up with a new fuel filter. Your car is most likely stalling cause it's not getting enough air or fuel or the ignition parts are worn out. But depending on the mileage your catalytic converter could be getting plugged also.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	id say the fuel system dirty or its in need of a good tune up|`|uomYVsiLaa	electronic idol positioning sensor ! NOT A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM !! when you shift in neutral the rpm go up and that's why it's not stalling , where in drive the rpm's are lower cause your controlling them with the gas pedal from a low idol which the sensor is not properly working for the reason that when you take foot off the gas and applying the brakes it's going to yet a lower idol which is going to low and causing your van to stall!!|`|u1Oi6tGHaa	Doesn't sound like the transmission to me.  If it's the trans, you would be having trouble going from gear to gear.  sounds more like a tune up problem.  I'd have your plugs and wires checked.
AA11872632	The 306 has only two ABS wheel sensors....both front wheels (Bendix system).  And there is a separate diagnostic plug-in for just the ABS.  According to this list, there is NO fault code for the ABS if you are plugged in anywhere else:  http://www.bba-reman.com/content.aspx?co...    the Central unit for ABS looks rather complicated on the electrical schematic.  There are two internal switches, a small motor, and four capacitors...all controlled by fuses number 31 (30 amperes) and 32.  Is the cost of ONE ABS wheel sensor high?  You might buy one new, and interchange it with the original ones, to make a difference?
AA10998195	Call a mechanic - It sounds like you are having transmission problems!|`|DV4xyeChaa	1 got fluid???????  2 tuned up????  3 ck engine lite on???? free scan any parts store  [advance,zone,,,o'reillys]|`|AA12159712	Could be as simple as your Kickdown spring on your accelerator linkage is either missing or not adjusted right.  Could also be your transmission clutch for reverse is not receiving fluid, meaning a clog in the pathway or maybe an adjustment or replacement.  There's also a possibility it could be the electronic governor isn't signalling correctly.

03ee34907dadd3ce913135c53012c9bfaa	Might be the rear emergency brake shoes inside the rear rotors. Ford has a big problem with the shoes coming off the tables and getting loose inside of the rotor. When they are dry they will just slide around in there and when the get wet they stick and shift making the clunking noise. Could be other things but this is a good place to look.|`|5qfyIK1maa	you still got warranty on it . just take it back to the dealer and have then rack their brains.it might be the rearend or the driveshaft bolts to the rearend might be loose|`|7a9hq9w8aa	I have seen a lot of these newer Ford products have the lining fall off the parking brake shoes and make noises like this. The parking brake has separarate shoes from the regular service brakes; inside the rear drums.
