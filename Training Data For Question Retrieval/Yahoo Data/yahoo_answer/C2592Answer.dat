WXAkvhImaa	If you're doing a 2amps+2subs set up, buy the same amp for both and the same sub for both.<br>  <br>  Amps and subs "colour" music, which means they change it a bit.  And since different amps colour music differently, you'd end up with some not-great sound if you used mismatched amps.
AA10724010	87 octane just like all Hyundai's, buying any higher grade is a waste of money, the 3.8L V6 is not a high compression engine requiring premium fuel.|`|DyEIc0K8aa	As always "beavanjb" has the correct answer.

AA12261615	people are driving more these days than they use to so no one can say for sure how long it will really last,that's not to bad of mileage for that year of truck,but i got two of those trucks and both with more miles than that on them,and the only thing i have did to either one is change the timing chain and gears in them,and regular maintenance,they hold up good but at about 150 thousand you need to replace the timing gears and chain or else they will break,it doesn't hurt anything but it sure makes big mess,take care of it though and you should get about 250 thousand from it before you need to do any serious engine work,good luck.|`|AA10562288	Heck , the truck is just broken in.  I recently purchased a 99 Dodge Ram 1500 with over 180,000 miles and it runs and acts better than the 2004 GMC that I totaled with less than 100,000 on it.  It depends on how the vehicle was maintained.|`|04Te5gzzaa	It all depends on how well the truck was maintained by the previous owner.  Did he get regular oil changes, tune-ups, replace normal wear parts (suspension, brakes, fluids).  Does he have records and receipts for all the work that was done to it?  If he didn't use it to haul heavy equipment and only used it to get around town, the engine and transmission might still be in good condition. You never mentioned how much he was asking for it.  I looked it up on Edmunds and the average price for this truck was about $3100 with that many miles on it.  There are many models of the Dodge Ram 1500 so the price can fluctuate depending on the options and engine size the one you're considering has.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your purchase!|`|AA10276489	As a comparison the annual mileage is figured at 12,000, That seems to be the average mileage.|`|f3af137c6aa10863392adcf146ea6a2aaa	Just drive baby drive.

The next leading GPS companies are Magellan and TomTom but still Garmin blows them out of the water.<br>  <br>  For your price range go with the Garmin 260 if you do not mind spending about $20 more than your target price get the Garmin 255.<br>  <br>  The feature you are talking about is text to speech which will say street names instead of just saying turn ahead. This feature starts on the original Garmin models at 260. On the newer models (indicated with a '5' instead of a '0' at the end) starts at the 255.<br>  <br>  The Garmin Nuvi260 and 255 are a lot alike but like mentioned before the 255 is a newer model so a little more improvement like easier to navigate screens, faster calculations, and finds a satellite signal faster. One of my favorite updates from the '5' models is that it not only tells you your current speed you are driving but also the posted speed limit on the road you are driving on.<br>  <br>  You can find more info and consumer reviews here:<br>  Nuvi 260<br>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UU7ZPS?tag=marartpla-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B000UU7ZPS&adid=1JW940WX1VRNFS57W6QH&" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UU7ZPS?tag...</a><br>  <br>  Nuvi 255<br>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0015F0AB8?tag=marartpla-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B0015F0AB8&adid=1W44GHZ18BBS949PN57D&" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0015F0AB8?tag...</a>

7L0zp7O6aa	The kit is needed when you want HID's but the car is not equipped with them.  And higher kelvin bulbs only work with a true HID system.  The halogen bulbs that advertise HID look is only coated to mimic a certain color.  And so you know, the higher the Kelvin the less the light actually travels so your output il less the bluer the light is.  So stick with the optimum temp range which is around 5500K

AA11032586	Yes. Very common and not too expensive. Those hoses are around $45.00 for both. That is here in Arkansas.|`|8AQw9xqBaa	Yep very common problem.  On earlier motors it was also common to leak by the oil filter where the lines came off, not sure if they got around that with the newer design that yours should be.   There is a 'leak kit' that includes several little gaskets and o rings.  Hoses were separate if needed.   They are also made by an aftermarket company called Dorman so it may be worth asking your shop if they are using GM or the Dorman parts and if there is a price or quality difference.

WO68RZdIaa	Once you complete training and get assigned your own truck, practically all of the major US trucking companies ( Swift, CR England, Werner, Schneider, JB Hunt, US Xpress, etc) do allow you to take your wife with you on the road.

You can actually get in trouble for interstate prostitution if you take a woman that is not your legal spouse in a commercial vehicle across state lines. (Truth- I'm not kidding)<br>  <br>  Once cleared by your Safety Dept, & all forms filled out & signed, she will show as a non-driving rider on your truck. Each trucking company has their own lengths that the rider authorization will remain valid. You will need to talk to your Safety Director for that information.<br>  <br>  Just remember- with most of the major companies in the US today, you will be out anywhere from 14-21 days before you will get a load to route you home for time off.

RYDSc5Bqaa	WOW, this is kinda tough to answer without knowing what kind of transmission you have, what the low range is in the transfer case, and what axles you have. I have owned Jeeps with differential gears of 4.10, 4.27, 4.88, and 5.38. All had either a straight 4 or V6 engine with a Spicer 18 transfer case and dana 25, 27, and 44 axles. My best Jeep had the V6. It had a 3 speed transmission with a 3.10 first gear, a 2.46 low range in the transfer case, and 4.88 differentials with 33 inch tires. This gave me a 37.21 crawl ratio and it went anywhere I drove it. The thing I liked about the 4.88's was that it drove well on the highways because of the Warn overdrive and got decent milage.<br>  If you have an automatic transmission you can get by with 4.10's due to the torque doubling effect of the tranny. Personally I'd go with the 4.88's and see if you can use the thick ring gear as this will give you a stronger pinion shaft due to the smaller diameter pinion gear.|`|NSWO27KSaa	4.88|`|5de8ae1b663a9b3b8e2564d52425aec1aa	On a 4.0 these ratios are the most widely used on a jeep<br>  for 33's - 4.56<br>  for 35's 4.88<br>  but these are usually run by guys that also run on the street.  If you still want to get some wheel speed up I'd probably go with 4.88 on 33's, but I've seen jeeps as low as 5.13 - either way you're going to have to upgrade the axles.  If you still have the Dana 35c prepare to break it with your driving style, tire size and gear setup.

UON9xYvAaa	It really depends on how you feel about bikes, how you ride and what attracted you to bikes in the first place.<br>  Jumping from the 250 ninja (very sought after right now, so you'll get a good price) onto the cbr600rr will feel like you got off your stannah stair lift and onto a missile. (I remember those days ;) ). If you want speed, you got it. You haven;t given your age, but please bear in mind insurance will be VERY high for a cbr600rr.<br>  HOWEVER cbr600rr are indemand, even more so now newer bikes are getting more and more track focussed.<br>  <br>  I started off my road rider on a ts50x scramber, then a yam tzr125, then honda bros 400, then another bros 400, then a suzuki tl1000r racing v-twin. To be honest, the honda bros has always been my favourite bike, and it has a beautiful frame, single sided rear swinging arm, and the engines are revvy and bulletproof ,(one of my bros' has cover 85000kms without ANYTHING apart from oil and fulters and plugs, (and plenty of tyres).<br>  <br>  My advice to you my friend, get some test rides on some v-twins and inline fours, test ride big tourers, trail bikes, nakeds, commuters, etc to find the perfect engine layout bike style you prefer, and let your heart do the rest.......................................<br>  <br>  PS - UK version - NT400 and NT600 after 92 changed into the 'dullsville' still going today with same engine, etc<br>  Japan version - Bros 400 and Bros650<br>  American version - Hawk GT 650 (400cc hawts rarer than hens teeth.)|`|22abd7968457d2986608219f92d70b85aa	That 600 has lots of balls, maybe a little too much.

I have the GSXR 600 and really don't want to change to anything else. You have the perfect mix of speed and cruising ability. I don't think it's going to be as big of a jump as you think, but most people start off on 600's. Good Luck!|`|30jQQ9Rgaa	Anything in the 600 class would be fine.  If you go smaller, it will not be long that you will be bored with that bike and have wasted money on a bike that you will not be happy with.

The battery will start the vehicle but not have enough juice to keep the memory for the idle air control.2 Dirty throttle body. Get some choke cleaner and spray down in the throttle body. Open the throttle body and clean the butteryfly real good.3. Bad idle air control solonid or throttle body.  First thing I would do is check the battery.|`|99df138c90c5cd91b68b1bd677378772aa	My 1993 Dakota was doing the same thing especially when low on gas. Think it was caused by loose dirt particlaes that got through the fuel filter blocking the idle motor. Filled her up to the neck and then went for an almighty blast on the highway.

DydFQ0fcaa	Start with replacing the fuel filter.  If that doesn't cure the problem, clean and inspect the carb because one of the carb jets could be obstructed.
XKYJk6Tcaa	if you want to kick up the power a bunch go to the Airflow research heads. you can go to their web site and put in the cam specs. you are running and they will recommend a set of heads that will work great. Or you can go with a set of edelbrock heads and manifold that are matched for a 350 with an over 30 bore. Then if you really want to make some power take your 350 and stroke it with a 400 crank and some good forged pistons. and the airflow heads. puts you right around 550 HP. There are so many different combinations for the 350 that it is left to your own desire. just takes cubic dollars for the need for speed. I am running a stroked 350 in a 31 model A that dynoed at 680 hp. just takes money.
t5QvEl9iaa	If your looking for some serious bass, cut the crap and get right into a bandpass box, that will be the main source for some deep bass, yuo will lose alot of sub accuracy with this type of box but the bass tones are uncompairable. As for subs I recommend either Alpine Type R's 12"<br>  Or Kenwood Excelons, other notable brands liek Kicker L7's are excellent if you get two type R's from alpine hook them up to an Alpine MRP-M1000 set a a 2ohm load in a bandpass box and you will hit some of the hardest bass from an amatuer system! there are other brands dont get me wrong uit really depends on howe much cash your willing to throw out there, thats just the subs not to mention if you want to hit a little more bass from your speakers dont go coax. get some component speakers, the driver is able to hit a little more low athan a regular coax speaker.. again for an amatuer system if your not going to be amping the speakers go with alpine type-s Component if you decide to amp them up go with the type R component, to match this all up with a deck i would suggest getting a panasonic deck personally i would choose the CQC 700U Has a ton of settings and functions on it as well as a built in EQ that is customizable and also has (SBC-SW) Which is "Super bass controlled - Subwoofer" settings!!
EcEMMx2Daa	The 350 is cheaper & easier to  build. but there is no replacement for displacement. The 454 would be awesome. IF you have funding to do it correctly. otherwise go with the 350|`|8fN13NQJaa	Just my opinion.....100% 350. Much easier to work on.Parts available everywhere. And you can make this engine give you all the power you need. Its a inexpensive motor to build. The 454 is going to require some mods to go in this car. You will have no room to do anything once you shoehorn that thing in there. Good luck.
1bobsT4Kaa	Yeah you can. Most b-series engine parts are interchangeable. I have a b18b tranny on a b20b motor.|`|3hQgISyGaa	Yeah, like the other guy said, most b18 parts are interchangable.|`|C02jqw8Raa	yes you can

It has 146hp which falls considerably short of the GSXR1000 (plays 162 in the 2005 model GSXR1000), but it's great amount of torque (82 lb-ft) is slightly more than the 1000. The 1125R's performance would put it squarely between the GSXR600 and GSXR1000 (ie. GSXR750), but it has great torque delivery all through the rev range. And it looks seriously bad@$$ as well.|`|aKirAFKdaa	Maybe.  Personally I would wait another year for them to get some bugs out, but it's actually looking like a decent bike at a decent price.  Amazing what can happen when you get rid of that antique Harley vtwin boat anchor.
RvS5YcPQaa	Throttle position sensor.<br>  <br>  While the truck is running and its running rough, disconnect the TPS and see if the idle changes.  If it gets worse, then the tps is good, if it doesnt, it may be bad.  After that, I might check to make sure the timing is still on.  Had anyone disonnected the wire for the cam sensor to time the truck and forget to plug it back in?|`|zOIgzIy4aa	good engine by the way! after you changed the injectors did you bleed the air out? also what about the gas filter, maybe it,s partly clogged.|`|bvCkplELaa	Could be alot of things causing that bro. I would stop swapping out parts as you can see you aren't accomplishing anything and wasting time and money. I would find a good reputable shop where you live that specializes in diagnostics.

cAMdBtFQaa	Read the other answers and they are things I would look at, but  there is another possibility, spark advance.  Usually it is mechanically adjusted by the gear shifter and throttle when placed in gear.  Next time you try putting it in gear, use your finger to adjust the spark advance and see if that helps.  It should be a mechanical linkage going up to the flywheel and moving a coil under the fly wheel.  This is what generates the spark for the engine and advancing the spark is what also helps generate more power when you first shift.  If you move it without shifting gears, you should hear the speed of the engine increase.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|DrMDxlWMaa	Kenny is right in his summation and most likely you will find the suggestions offered in line with what your problem is. There may be another possibility to consider. You did not stipulate the age of your motor or other conditions,etc. "If" the motor is old and has substantial usage or "If' it was ran for periods of time without proper oil mixture ratio; You may have a compression problem. When an engine has low compression, it will tend to die out or quit when it is placed under a load such as putting it in gear... I hope this is not your problem but it can be checked rather easily with a compression gauge. If it is in your mind to fix it your self, by all means go at it!  One of the joys of owning boats and motors is doing the repairs and feeling the satisfaction of a job well done upon completion. "I Love It!"  Regardless, I hope you overcome this problem and get on with the enjoyment of using it!|`|ZfRnC4rAaa	I had this same problem with the boat I bought last year.  I had changed the fuel line  and primer bulb, changed the fuel filter and even played with the carb.  My motor did the same thing, it would idle fine, rev up fine, but when I went to go it would only go about 10 feet.  It ended up me taking the head off and guess what, the head gasket on the middle cylinder was sucked into the motor.  I ordered new gaskets and sanded down the everything with a sanding block so all of it was even and then replaced the head gasket and what I would call the valve cover gasket.<br>  <br>  Look at your spark plugs to see if there is any water on them, also try looking into the cylinder with a flashlight to see if there is any rust or  water.  That's how I figured out the head gasket might be blown, then I did the tear down.  If that's what it is, it's pretty easy to do.  Just make sure you sand the block and the head evenly and make sure all of the old gasket is gone.  Blow everything out with a compressor, put it back together, and make sure your torque is right and you follow an even pattern.  I didn't have any problems the rest of the season.  <br>  <br>  This was on a 1989 Suzuki DT 55, 3 cylinder.  Hope it helps.|`|iymWL8TPaa	it is possible that the vent on the fuel cap is not open all the way or if it is an older hose the inside of it could be collapsing. on the other hand if its not one of those issues it could be carb. problems your choke may not be opening and closeing the right way or your high speed jet could be dirty if the engine sat up for a while. good luck,,

The best way to tell is to take the distributor cap off.  If there is oil inside you will need to replace the distributor, if not, just replace the seal.

You will also need many, many tools and specialty equipment and buy many sets of tires to fit the rear end as you will cook em right off the rims every time youmash the gas pedal.  God luck..|`|AA10419188	Yes, but why??   You will blow out the differential quite often, as it is not built of this horsepower.  If you mishandle horsepower it tears things up!  Most people have that horsepower specifically so they CAN mishandle it!  If you have wire wheels (with slpined hubs), it will spin the splines off hubs, and they are not cheap enough or easy enough to change that you want to do that often!<br>  <br>  To modify vehicle you will have to put in much heavier front suspension  because of the weight, -- the bigger the engine,- the more cutting out and beefing up you will have to do!<br>  <br>  My estimation is that this would be a "money pit" with no bottom!|`|EcEMMx2Daa	Yes it can be done.

Penske and U-Haul trucks are usually under, so do not need a CDL. If no CDL is required, then no airbrake endorsement needed<br>  <br>  However, if you drive a truck which is over 10,000  in interstate commerce, (state to state) you are required to follow all federal regulations pertaining to big rigs. <br>  <br>  You are also required to carry a current medical card while driving anything over 10,000 (all 50 states laws will comply with this starting in 2009)<br>  <br>  To get your CDL, you will need to pass a written (knowlege) test, pre-trip inspection test in a vehicle in the class which you are trying to get a CDL, a basic skills test in that vehicle, and a road test in that vehicle.<br>  <br>  Your friend better use caution paying you to drive, as he will be acting as a motor carrier, and there are loads of regulations he will need to follow, or he can face very stiff fines (tens of thousands of dollars for certain violations)<br>  <br>  He can start here:  <a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrguide.asp?section_type=A" rel="nofollow">http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulatio...</a><br>  <br>  ADDED IN RESPONSE TO QUESTION ON 3-8-09: You need a DOT physical to determine if you are physically fit enough to drive a commercial vehicle.

So definitely go change your transmission fluid.|`|7HDWtqhOaa	Mich is pretty much right, the syncros in the trans has a friction material on them kind of like auto trans clutches, the synthetic oil should only be used if you are in a pinch.

3NoQuoWuaa	You do not want to buy this car with a outstanding lien against it. It is up to the current owner to clear the lien. It may be nothing more than a UCC filing on a loan that has been paid but as far as the legal system is concerned there is a lien.The lien holder has to release the lien so you will have a clear title. No clear title, no buy.r|`|kjAWsDwLaa	So apparently it hasn't been taken care of.  You need to find out from the seller what the lien is about and why it's still on the car.  Don't buy it unless you know the lien is satisfied, and ask for proof.|`|26619ce88aefb73d3da06270a3d7c3e2aa	The lien would have to be paid off by the seller or by yourself before you would be able to transfer the car into your name. If the lien was taken care of it would not be showing up so I would double check this and make sure it has been paid before you even bye the car, you will need paper work showing that it has been paid off by the person that put the lien on the car in the first place.<br>   The seller may be trying to tell you it has been paid in order to suck you into purchasing the car, you need to make sure or you will be getting yourself stuck with it and standing the risk of the car being towed out of your driveway.<br>   Good Luck and be care-full.|`|a1ddcae78f9848320ad0b8246c9c1087aa	Until the lein is taken care of, you can't transfer the title.|`|FsThDndwaa	If you want the car free and clear of liens then you have to pay off the liens { bills } first.

O3qsmr82aa	If you're driving an automatic, its not that critical, its just easier on the interlock pin that can break and cause the car to roll, or won't let you shift out of park.  Saves wear and tear on a manual transmission.  Also, keeps the parking brake cables from becoming seized.<br>  <br>  So your roomate is partly correct.  From a savety standpoint its a good idea but not completely necessary.  From a maintenance standpoint, its a good idea to use the parking brake regualarly.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	your room mate is right, but either way isn't bad.<br>  <br>  anyways, your transmission is built to stand up to holding the car in place. when you put it in park, it actually puts the transmission in neutral, and engages something called a parking pin which holds the car. it doesn't hurt to apply the handbrake. just your choice. it doesn't hurt!<br>  <br>  i personally never heard of a parking pin failing under normal conditions.|`|Bm9BZeC4aa	It don't prevent wear and tear on no gears unless you are on a hill or you drive a manual. But if you feel safer that way then go ahead and do it but to me its a waste of time unless I'm on a hill or something like that.|`|HX3GjrQraa	Right, because I think thats necesary, and important to prevent.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	I drive an automatic and I always 'set' my parking brake before shifting into park regardless of the surface I am parked on. It makes the vehicle a lot easier to shift out of park when i drive off again and it keeps the parking brake cables from rusting and seizing up.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	if your parked on a hill it,s a good idea to push the parking brake. it takes the strain off the transmission. on the level you don,t have to.
BUPiXrxVaa	There are all too many people out there with the same mentality as you when it comes to big trucks. At least you stop to ask why, most of them just assume that their assunptions are correct and go complaining to legislators and authorities about it.<br>  <br>  A big truck is designed to run for hours on end while sitting still. A truck driver is required by law to take a 10 hour break after 14 hours of working. Have you ever tried to sleep when it's 100 degrees outside with no air conditioning? Or when it's 20 degrees outside with no heat? It gets pretty un comfortable. There are heater and air conditioning controls right next to the bed in a big truck, so if it wasn't designed to run while sleeping, why would they put those controls in it?<br>  <br>  I would contend that you leaving the heat on at home when no one is there is a far bigger waste of fuel. There are some drivers that leave the truck running while they aren't in it. That is a waste of fuel.<br>  <br>  It is far more stressful on a big diesel to start it after it's been sitting for a while than it is to let it run. While sitting all of the oil drains to the oil pan. When you start it, it takes a couple seconds for that oil to circulate, causing undue wear to the engine. The starter on a big truck gets maximum stress everytime you start it as well.<br>  <br>  It is no more unsafe to be in a parked road tractor while it is running than it is to be in a home while the furnace is running. That is providing everything is in proper operating condition.<br>  <br>  Almost every state is coming out with anti idling laws for big trucks. You have one law saying you must take a 10 hour break and another law saying you can't be comfortable and sleep while on your break. Why is it that while the cop is standing at the drivers door of the truck giving you hell about idling, his car is sitting there idling with no one in it?|`|a1ddcae78f9848320ad0b8246c9c1087aa	That truck is someone's "home".  When you go out in the winter do you turn your furnace off?<br>  <br>  The truck is idling to provide heat/cooling for the driver to be comfortable while they sleep, and to provide electrical power so they can run TV's, Laptop computers, etc.<br>  <br>  Diesels just idling have almost no stress on them.  A Detroit Deisel Series 60 uses about 5 liters (1.75 gallons) per hour at high idle (1000 RPM)|`|Bm9BZeC4aa	Because once you turn them off its hard and takes to long to start them. Besides if they are carring a load you have to keep the freezer on plus at night they use ac and heaters to keep them warm as they nap in the bed in their rig..|`|efad8b1ede4a36c25f7ed32273efa609aa	they are hard to start, need heat or ac and such. But they have a new device, don't remember the name but it allows them to shut off the engines and run off a separate power source .|`|aRmekl72aa	The gas is normally paid for by the company, and they are normally sleeping or hanging out and would like a controlled environment A?C or heat given the season. Not that much gas is burned while idealing. I slept in my car all night at a rest stop for 8 hours my gas gauge barely moved when i woke up.|`|AA11264416	so they can run the AC, heat and everything in the truck like the TV, microwave, mini fridge, all of that stuff will drain the batteries if the truck isn't left on also the AC and heat makes it comfortable, only way a trucker can run all those things without the engine running is if they have a generator added into the truck but thats added weight on the truck and every pound counts on an 18 wheeler sometimes, also when its cold its better for a diesel to just keep running and idling than to keep shutting it down and restarting<br>  <br>  and about the waste of fuel and stress on engine, a diesel can idle 24/7 as long as you want it to with no problems so it doesn't hurt the engine also it does waste the fuel but not as much as you think it does, diesel engines actually use less diesel fuel while idling than a gas engine uses gas while idling, think about it, wouldn't you rather waste fuel and be comfortable in the truck with the AC and heat than be in the truck sweating like hell or freezing cold, also its not unsafe, its tremendous amounts of pressure on the brakes, those round canisters have basically a big coil spring and that big spring is what holds the truck from moving when its parked, when the air brakes are engaged the air isn't what keeps them in place, the air is just for driving, the air while moving actually keeps the spring back, so the engaged air brakes have nothing to do with the engine running so the engine running won't make it more dangerous|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it don,t take as much fuel to keep them running as it does to start them back up. besides keeping them running keeps the air built up in the air brakes. and in the winter they sleep in their rigs.
AA11404742	They're afraid of being blamed for the damage.

Another thing is if you use music files that were downloaded through things like Limewire, they have a habit of messing up iPods, and its never a go idea to leave something charged all day, it could have overcharged or corrupted by a music file. Also check the warranty, if its past its prime it could just time to get a new one =(
UON9xYvAaa	Firstly, if something is draining your battery, the car will be running rough anyway. It will have a weak spark, so lumpy idle, poor running, no real acceleration.<br>  <br>  Battery drain will be down to leaving lights on, or if fan is cutting in whenever, just leave fuse out all together untill its car needs it. The fault isn't normally fan or even the sensors, its bad quality wiring or poor contacts/electrical connectors<br>  <br>  However, if you have a faulty oxygen sensor, lamda probe, mass air flow sensor or a blockage in the fuel line, these would all course the problems such as stalling, loss of power, etc<br>  <br>  SO, check battery, fuel lines and quality of fuel (ie no water), then sensors. Qualifyed mechanic should get fault for around ￡30-￡50, or $60-$80<br>  OR, check battery and leave fuse out, this was what a good friend of mine did with their 97 citreon, (although the climate is colder over here)<br>  <br>  PS - If its the battery, engine light should sometimes flicker before staying on|`|88bc02e78f8af966df066d8b6c93da26aa	Sounds like you got a cracked head.

dpSu13Bxaa	You might be able to get your limo for around $700, but a lot depends on when you need the car.  If you're looking for a limo on a prom Saturday night (late March through early June), you will probably have to pay more than that.  That is high season for limos and it's almost impossible to find a discount - even this year.<br>  <br>  More importantly, you want want to be informed before you start calling around.  A great website to learn about how to rent a limo and get the best deals is www.limo-questions.com.  They tell you what to look for, what questions to ask, etc. .... There are a lot of crappy services out there mixed in with the good ones, so be careful.|`|MYilJDb5aa	You should be able to get it for that I believe. Go to <a href="http://www.ezlimorentals.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezlimorentals.com</a> and enter your zip or click on your location on the map. You will then get a quote from multiple companies. I use a LOT of limo's and I use it every time without fail. Good luck and have fun!
z6TI1ZDDaa	If you have the comprehensive coverage necessary your insurance company will assign an adjuster that will compile facts about your car:  how many miles, any dents, your location, etc.  Also important is how good your resale value is.  Based on all that data they will make you an offer.  Usually the offer is above private sale, but somewhat below dealer price.  FYI it is always good for you to know what the blue book is, be knowledgeable.|`|dyIyJqauaa	Neither and both, sorta, kinda.  You will be given  what is called "fair market value".  That is what the same car with the same mileage in the same condition is being sold for both at  dealers and from  private party's
5xxuKzXPaa	the serpentine belt is at the front of the engine, it is the single belt that drives all of the accessories like the alternator, power steering, water pump. etc. simply look at it when the engine is off and see if you have any cracks, the guide i have heard and live by is that if you see more than 3 cracks in an inch of the belt. it is time to replace that belt.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Its the big single belt that drives the fan, alternator etc on the front of your engine. Check periodically for cracks is all that's required|`|AA10136890	Serpentine belts took the place of multiple "fan" belts of the past. Open the engine compartment hood and between the radiator and the engine or if it's a front wheel drive vehicle (these engines are mounted sideways) , it will be on the left side of the engine. this will be a long belt that drives all the components of engine (ie: water pump, crankshaft, alternator, and A/C compressor). it's a little over and 1"<br>   wide and looks like a giant rubber band.|`|AA11850523	get the serpentine belt checked for wear at least every 3 oil changes<br>  under the hood- its the large black belt on the side of the engine which goes around pulleys- you cant miss it|`|2x5t9c82aa	It not impotant your car can run for years like that the only thing is it will be noisy!
CeuHJRPKaa	if u know z code after obd test we can   answer better|`|HFrsH9MRaa	CHances are that your engine is NOT mixing air/fuel correctly. Have your throttle body and idle air control valve cleaned out to insure proper mix. Unburnt fuel burns out O2 sensore and exhuast systems quickly. Also, get rid of the factory plugs, and install Bosch Platinum or Nippondenso Iridium plugs. You will get more power, better gas mileage, and your emissions will drop. If you need the O2 sensors, stick with Bosch units. They are the ones that invented them!!!
ojxfzv7Faa	If you need a truck, buy the Chevy Silverado. If you don't need a truck, buy the smaller and more fuel efficient Scion TC.<br>  <br>  What was so hard about that?|`|3MTYGEbWaa	These are two completely different classes of vehicles. What's more important to you? Is the hauling and towing capacity of a truck important to you? Is off-road capability of a truck important? Is the better fuel efficiency of the Scion important? If you decide which class of vehicle best fits your needs, you'll have your answer.|`|owpQPYGPaa	Well they both have pros and cons you really have to decide just what do you really need it for? <br>  <br>  The Scion is going to be much cheaper on gas, get better mileage etc as well as most likely being easier to drive and park <br>  <br>  Ok no the truck you can carry more stuff especially if you get a topper for the bed, you can use it for work like hauling supplies, timber yard waste etc, you can tow things with it and its going to do alot better at those kind of things but it will cost alot more to operate fuel wise though if its a domestic truck might be cheaper parts wise while the Scion may cost more to fix.|`|3jzqG7Oqaa	Go for the chevy, trucks are so much better. Even though gas is more it will pay off. With a truck you can go muddin' or 4 wheelin' or you can tow something.

eefdd2d971d42ad1ee9556089354b3dfaa	it all depends on how well it's done and how much you have in it..  first you have to start with a decent 68 fastback, that will set you back about 15 to 20  grand to start and add from there..<br>  <br>   I would say a decent clone might start at 25 grand and from there the sky is the limit..
AA11101361	Having owned a Focus and currently owning a Honda, Honda hands down.  The parts on a Focus are weird and always have to be ordered.  The great thing about Hondas is they build a part and use it forever.  That's one reason why Honda's are the most stolen car.  They have great parts resale.  That's also why you see 20 year old Hondas on the road.  They don't reinvent the wheel everytime they build a car.|`|KxqEYBWhaa	Don't buy a ford focus they are horrible cars..well they look nice but it won't be worth your money. If the honda isn't that old and it seems like it's in pretty good condition i would get that. I bought a 97 honda accord and it's been a very good car. And it's not a gas guzzler which is awesome!|`|ojxfzv7Faa	If you have the money for a new Ford Focus, I really don't see why you're looking at a used CR-V. Get a Honda Fit or Honda Civic. You're getting a better car, the new car warranty and the reliablity and resale of Honda for the same price as a new Focus.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Easy answer, the new Ford for sure.   No question.|`|pFlkWQySaa	in this economy, what's to decide????  FORD. Bonus! You get a full warranty with a new car.|`|HE23qtamaa	Depends what you want - used Honda would be better value for money but it's always riskier, things will inevitably need to be replaced, maintenance will be more etc. The new Ford will have a new car warranty, so maintenance will be very cheap, but insurance might be a bit more and it'll depreciate faster in the first few years.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'm all about new cars, but that's just me. I prefer having a full warranty and not having to worry about replacing this that or the other.|`|fr5ImqW9aa	If you can get a new Focus for around 12k you need to jump on it.. I sell Ford vehicles.. The CRV is a good car..But depending how many miles are on it you may not have any warranty.which means if any thing happens to it, its all on you to cover any repairs..<br>  good luck.|`|xzJi0bcSaa	Ford Focus, we have one and its a great car! It gets good gas mileage and its kind of sporty looking and very safe. Plus, with a new car, you know the history of it and new usually comes with a warranty.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Easy answer - the Honda CR-V for sure
buHzPMHZaa	You need to talk to the insurance company, or whoever has claim on the ship. Buying the rights to posess a wreck is a sketchy business. Other claimants, if any, can pop up and dispute your claim, if they've got a valid reason to claim ownership, receivership or one of a dozen other lien-worthy claims. <br>       Salvage law is a unique brand of legal issues, and it's possible for owners and/or underwriters to pass claim to rights to a wreck, be it lost without a trace or sunk at the dock, but an underwriter for the ship may be different from those who insured cargo. So you see, it's a tough area to work within.|`|KQhIcU4Yaa	You should ask a lawyer.

kgk3Yz9Naa	as above...but also look into fitting new seals in the handle bar cylinder/reservoir...|`|lM9NvSwnaa	Unless you are having problems with the brake resevoir I would leave it alone, otherwise, simply install the brake pads, place the caliper on the disc and then proceed to bleed the brake system as usual.<br>  <br>  I would however use new copper fittings when installing the hose onto the caliper, just to give it a great seal.|`|628354eb8f7435b3ae5db56f6ecf4b14aa	no leave them compressed, hydraulic pressure will press them back out and you will have less air to bleed out, you can gravity bleed most the air out w/o the pump/loosen/tighten/repeat process
dyIyJqauaa	They are doing what many insurance companies do.  Trying to weasel out of paying a claim in part because they know he has no insurance to go to bat for him and they also know that he will have to hire a lawyer to get for him what he deserves.|`|kjAWsDwLaa	They're trying to cut their losses by partially blaming your BF for the accident since he was supposedly speeding.  Some companies almost automatically try to shift some of the blame onto the other driver for this reason; sometimes it's correct, sometimes not.  If he's sure he wasn't speeding, tell the company that it's not acceptable and you want full payment.  Then go get some insurance for him, if he gets to keep his license--it should be suspended until he does.|`|AA11914369	They have assigned him 30% of the blame for speeding and perhaps for being uninsured.  Under TX law, established in 2005, he would have been required to show his insurance card at the time of the accident.  If he couldn't, he would have been ticketed.  Be happy the other insurance is only dropping it by 30%.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	It's called "contributory negligence", meaning that the insurance company has decided both drivers are partially responsible for the collision.<br>  <br>  Why doesn't your boyfriend have insurance?

If you're in the forest, you'll need a 4-stroke, not 2. If you're a Honda type of guy, and depending on what kind of riding you're gonna be doing its a toss up of the CRF250X and the CRF450X. If you're just gonna be putting around the ranch, then the CRF250X will do just fine, but if you like to wrench the throttle and turn up the power, then definetly get the CRF450X. Both are great and reliable bikes, both from Honda, both are equipped with head/tail lights and are street legal, but if you're gonna hit the streets, you'll need a license, add on a horn, left side mirror and a bracket to mount your license plate and you can do all that for $80 and some pocket change.|`|KATVP3cCaa	CRF450x Road legal 4stroke Honda or maybe a KTM 250 exc-f.

I know I would...<br>  <br>  If there were a hi-jacking today, I think passengers would fight back almost immediately. 9/11 changed the airline industry forever.

30jQQ9Rgaa	It could be a variety of problems and most of them are electrical.  Sounds like the generator/alternator is not charging and you are losing the fire.  This will cause your bike to try and run off the battery and when your battery is getting weak or drained it will start to spit sputter and backfire.  I would charge the battery up first, then, with a full charge, start the bike, get in a darkened shop or garage/ carport close to the wall and rev the engine up some. If the alternator is charging the light will brighten up. If the battery is charging, then I would start checking the volage regulator and other electrical components.|`|UON9xYvAaa	It could well be the battery, so check that, but that wouldn't cut the bike out at idle. If it was just the rough running, i'd say check for fuel starvation, pump, kinked fuel line.<br>  But as you say the gauges are going dead as well as rough running, it sounds like the main electrical connecter in the front fairing is letting in moisture/water and is corroding/shorting out.<br>  On my suzuki tl1000r the elecrtical connecter responsible is inside the left hand upper part of the front fairing, in the area of the speedo / headlight, (happened to me at 34,000 miles). Give it a proper clean, spray with wd40, or equivent and you should be fine. Mine is a 98, failed after 8 years, similar to yours, common problem now a days for jap bikes.<br>  <br>  After you clean electrical connecter box up, IF bike is running fine, you may need to clear the fault codes out of ecu memory, (on my suzuki, bridge serial port under seat, faults display on tacho screen, hold down trip reset to delete i think, my faults were side stand/clutch cutout swtiches, and fuelling on rear cylinder, both fine, like i said the little eletrical box is a bast**d if not kept clean)<br>  <br>  Hope you get it sorted mate, and KEEP THE RUBBER SIDE DOWN!
i5lk5eN2aa	The airbag computer module is probably under the driver's seat or under the center console. But be very careful changing it or tampering with it because you can very easily inadvertently deploy the airbags. You must first disable it by removing the fuses or disconnecting the battery and then wait for it to power down. The computer module for the airbag system stores enough power to deploy the airbags even 20 to 30 minutes after the battery is disconnected or the fuses removed. So I suggest you wait no less that 30 minutes for it to consume its reserve power before attempting to remove the airbag computer module or the airbags. But waiting 1 hour would be better. Better safe than sorry!<br>  <br>  It looks like this<br>  <a href="http://i.ebayimg.com/01/!BNu(ivw!2k~$(KGrHgoH-DoEjlLluCsSBJrEjdVP6Q~~_1.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://i.ebayimg.com/01/!BNu(ivw!2k~$(KG...</a>

You can locate the horns under the hood, they are usually together, and unplug one.  Push the lock button and see if the sound changes, or doesn't sound at all.  If the sound doesn't change, then that horn is likely out.  If there is not sound at all the other horn is likely out.  I would try it with both horns to make sure.  <br>  <br>  There is usually just a few bolts holding them onto the body.  You should be able to go to any auto parts store and purchase another horn.

hcGUKAYFaa	How do you know your thermostat is starting to go?  is the heater working at all, or just not well?  lack of power is really hard to accurately diagnose over the internet, but if it is severe, it could be  a serious problem, i am leaning towards a timing belt issue, since the timing belt drives the water pump on this car, if the shaft is damaged, it could be causing low coolant flow (heater nearly inop, and temperature erratic)  it also can cause the belt to jump teeth causing significant powerloss, you need a qualified mechanic to look at this ASAP, where are you located?
AA12261615	you do need to check the fluid level in it when its warmed up and idling,and see if its full,and also notice to see if it has any discoloration to the fluid ,like if its a brownish color or has burnt smell to it,if it does this means it has internal problems,but there's no way for sure that anyone could tell you for sure exactly whats causing this too happen,the only true way to find out is have a shop check it,they are the only ones who can help you if its not low on fluid,beyond checking the fluid level a shop will have to diagnose it for you,don't go buying parts for it though that it may not need, a shop can determine whats wrong with it a lot faster and cheaper than we can,good luck with it.

MiAOnwN6aa	Insurance is applicable for the car, not the driver. In other words, you are insured no matter who drives the insured car.|`|5e226dac51b3645bfbc3bb618cc08694aa	You are right and this does seem to be quite expensive. I would get a lot more quotes before accepting this offer. You are not required to keep your current company even if  you have paid the policy in full. Most companies offer a discount for multiple cars, in fact I have an old Ford Truck on my policy and I tried to drop it, but my rates actually went up in this case. Sometimes insurance doesn't make a lot of sense.
AA11917574	The best thing to do is call an independent agent.  They have access to multiple companies and should be able to help you.  You should NEVER exclude your spouse on your policy.   It just is not a good idea.  Switch both cars to another policy, pay the higher premiums for a couple of years and then you can go back to a company with lower rates.   I would definitely call around.|`|kjAWsDwLaa	If the insurer does drop hubby, you'll have to exclude him from your policy and take out a non-standard (high-risk) policy on him.  Problem is, most lessors want higher limits for liability than a non-standard company will write; you'll have to ask the agent/company about that.<br>  <br>  Many standard companies have an alternative, higher-priced company that might take him for a couple of years while his record clears up; you might ask about that.  Or, you could just put both on the high-risk policy for the period, but that will be expensive.|`|MkZF3pqXaa	You're going to have to switch companies.  Expect to have a HUGE increase in your rates.<br>  <br>  What you should do is have a chat with your husband about how his bad driving habits are costing the family money as well.  I doubt he knows that just one ticket can raise your rates over 30%.  He is being irresponsible and it's costing you both dearly.<br>  <br>  Also, you should have hired an attorney to represent you in court because they can usually keep the ticket off your record- even if you have to pay the fine.  If he gets another ticket, make him get his own policy, so he knows just how much his recklessness is costing.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	You can call your insurance company and sign a form excluding him from coverage on your car.  If he then drives your car and has an accident there will not be insurance coverage.

1gNwWJsPaa	I think you are correct. It Does sound like a blown head gasket. Going back to auto class white smoke from your exhaust is water so some where there is water maybe antifreeze is getting in. But definitely a liquid is leaking some where.|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Could be. From the white smoke, it is likely that anti-freeze IS getting into the exhaust somehow. IF the smoke is only momentary on startup and NOT all the time, then a leaking head gasket is probably the cause. If it were a intake manifold leak rather than a head leak it would not overheat, but still have white smoke on startup that may or may not go away in a short time. If so, then you chose a mechanic to test the system for leaks who was incompetent. A simple pressure drop test will tell you if you have a leaking coolant system. Either you did not have this test done, OR it was done incorrectly. This is provided you are SURE the fan, thermostat, water pump and radiator all are in operating condition AND the system is full with no trapped air bubbles, such as in the heater core. Bubbles can vapor lock the cooling system so water does not flow, and it overheats even if everything else tests out OK.|`|2XusVa4jaa	I've also seen a few cracked heads. Pull it apart and have the cylinder head checked. The "iron duke" as it was called back in the day ran forever as long as you didnt' over heat it or run it out of oil.

ecedd300662492407b4b61dc35388364aa	If you are only planning to spend 800 dollars you are most likely at a salvage auction.  Translation the auction is selling the car as a salvage vehicle or for parts only.  You need to make sure an auction vehicle you choose has a title free and clear and the title is not stamped a salvage title.  If the title is a salvage title the state would not allow you to register or sell the vehicle for any thing other than parts.  You need to find out you specific state laws before you take the plunge.  Also, many states and some major cities still have emissions testing.  If the car can not pass an emissions test again it can not be registered.  Do your research before you decide how to handle a potential buyer.

Like the previous answerer said a simple solution to check is to disconnect the battery cable with the engine running but the best way is to use a voltage meter to see how much the alternator is putting out anyway. It shouldn't be more than 14 volts + or - anyway. it could be another problem too.

AA10136890	A lot of times you'll have a double filament bulb that is used  to control Your high and low lights on a vehicle and usually the low lights burn out first because you use them the most anyway. today's cars have halogen bulbs instead of sealed beams so to prevent premature burn out to these bulbs, it is recommended that you not handle the bulb with your bare hands since the oils from your hand will definitely shorten the lifespan of the bulb. If you do handle them with bare hands use alcohol on a clean soft cloth to clean then wait till it evaporates before turning them on again, a few minutes will do the trick.|`|viGqMW1Xaa	could be an electrical problem<br>  <br>  my suburban has that as well. when the high beams are on, they work fine but on the regular lights, only one bulb(the light) works properly|`|uDuwc7Yoaa	it is a single bulb with 2 elements just like crewchie and grodhi96 said.<br>  it's a breeze to replace, & here's how - there is a tab on the top rear of the headlamp that is bent at a 90* angle.

rdD1lCtEaa	Any N/A motor can benefit by adding a turbo however in terms of fuel efficiency its all dependent on the way you drive because boost can be self regulated. In short, if you drive gently shifting gears before you reach boost you'll save fuel, however, if you drive aggressively hitting boost all the time you'll be able to watch your fuel gauge go down. For an explanation of this watch this short video.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://videos.howstuffworks.com/howstuffworks/4663-how-turbochargers-work-video.htm" rel="nofollow">http://videos.howstuffworks.com/howstuff...</a><br>  <br>  In regards to the second part of your question you seem to have a huge misunderstanding about power figures. Detuning the car by lowering its max boost will only do two things, thats lower your max power output and increase the life of your engine. Like I said earlier boost can be self regulated by the driver. Most turbo cars have a boost gauge so the driver knows when they are hitting boost (although you can usually hear it). <br>  <br>  Im guessing what you want to do is have a powerful car that is fuel efficient too right? If this is the case then I'd run 10-14psi and drive gently all the time. Just avoid hitting boost and if you'll be fuel efficient and have the power there if you need. Also you should get an s13/14/15 with an sr20det, the KA is fail<br>  <br>  any references you need for a silvia go to <br>  <br>  www.nissansilvia.com and ask your questions there|`|AA11652304	The most economical fuel mixture is always the stoichiometric mixture of around 15:1 by volume.<br>  <br>  If the mixture is made leaner by adding more air or less fuel the economy will fall away as it would if the mixture were too rich.<br>  <br>  The whole purpose of having 02 sensors is to constantly maintain the stoichiometric mixture by trimming the injector pulse width. This is also known as closed loop or lambda|`|aa9gieAIaa	some of what you say is true but with gas engines you really wont wind up getting more mpg by adding a turbo no matter how good you do setting it up. boosting will improve your thermal efficiency somewhat but this is offset by the negative work used to drive the turbo which comes from the pistons. also even with intercooling you max comp. ratio will be lower the more boost you have. you can't really lean out the engine to save gas with or without a turbo since the mixture wont ignite well as its leaned out beyond say 15-16 to one. because modern cars use egr systems the mixture has to stay around 14-14.5 to one or richer when the egr is on or it wont light well. if you put on a turbo with your stock pistons and started boosting and ran a lean mixture on regular gas you would surely detonate the pistons to bits. lean mixes detonate easily compared to rich ones. i used to drive a mx6 with a turbo f2 and got about 30-33 mpg. i now drive a probe with a non turbo f2 and get about 30-33. the turbo had 7.8/1 pistons the non has 8.6 pistons. i recommend turbo gas engines but don't expect to save fuel. that tends to work more on diesels.

bea2c50e30c8c234aeb6e88e02424208aa	The Boss woofer has dual voice coils, or in other words two independently wired coils. This is, for the most part, a gimmick, but does allow you a small amount of flexibility when wiring. The resistance is quoted at 4 ohm, which I assume that means each separate coil has 4 ohm. The power is rated at 400W continuous. <br>  <br>  I can't say whether the 400W applies to each coil, or the total of both added together, i.e. each separate coil can handle 200W. I think the latter is most likely.<br>  <br>  The Kenwood only has a single coil. it's also 4 ohm, and also says it's rated to 400 W continuous.<br>  <br>  That means you want to be running less than 400+400 = 800 total watts out of the amp, more than that and you'll most likely burn out your subs.  <br>  <br>  The amplifier has two channels. The website quotes three possible wiring configurations.<br>  -225W per channel @ 4 ohm each channel<br>  -550W per channel @ 2 ohm each channel (so, 1100W in total)<br>  -1100W both channels bridged @ 4ohms in one channel.<br>  <br>  If you connected both voice coils in the boss woofer in *parallel* you'd end up with 2ohms. If you connected that to one channel of the amp, you could get 550W out of it. That's more than is recommended, but you'd probably still be within the safety margin if you didn't run it at full blast for an extended period. if you did it that way, then your only option with the Kenwood woofer would be to just wire it straight into the other channel, for 220W; no worries burning that one out.

N4IvZmPiaa	Most forklifts run on liquid propane. Not vapour like a furnace or water heater does. The valving in the forklift cylinder is different than a 20lb bbq cylinder. Forklift cylinders have what is called an "excess flow" feature built into them. It is there to detect if the hose ruptures or is cut. In that case, the excess flow closes and the propane supply is cut off. This is to prevent propane gas from filling up the warehouse if the hose ruptures!<br>  <br>  Most people run a forklift until it runs completely out of fuel. When they do this, the line from the cylinder to the engine is drained of all liquid. When the cylinder is exchanged, the valve needs to be opened VERY slowly about 1/4 turn until you hear the fuel flow stop. This has allowed a bit of fuel to flow through and "charge" the line with liquid again. If you open it too quickly, the excess flow valve can falsely sense that something is wrong and will shut off. This is exactly why people sometimes change cylinders and think they got a bad one from the supplier when the forklift wont start again. There is nothing wrong with the cylinder. It is just the safety feature doing it's job! If this happens, close the valve, disconnect and reconnect the hose again and start over!<br>  <br>   Once that line is charged, YOU MUST OPEN THE VALVE ALL THE WAY!!! There is two very good reasons for this. The first one is the fact that the stem of the valve could leak around the threads. This is normal. You have to open the valve all the way, and backseat it gently to ensure it doesn't leak.<br>  <br>    The other, far more important reason, relates to that excess flow feature. If you only open the valve slightly, you are only letting a small amount of fuel through at a time. If the hose is cut or ruptures, the excess flow valve will not be able to sense that there is a problem and will not shut off! You will now have an uncontrolled leak of propane filling up your warehouse! Not good!<br>  <br>   So...Open the valve very slowly and only a bit at first...wait a few seconds and then open it all the way and gently backseat it.|`|jieKgKF1aa	yes u do open valve all the way|`|k55p1pKraa	Big papa has hit it right on the nail,you should never open it all the way up, The reason you don't wont to open it all the way up is if something goes wrong you need to be able to close it off as fast as possible, those type valve are open as soon as you make the very first turn , you don't gain anything by openning it all the way up.|`|xYV9Z5K6aa	No it only needs to be opened 1/4 turn or so.

5Af6j1qsaa	It depends on a variety of factor.  What type of public transportation is needed?  What are the routes?  Time tables?  Fares?<br>  <br>  Usually the question is whether you value your time or money more.  Public transportation is usually cheaper, but it could double your commute time.

The train has to go all around to other stops, while I can just drive straight to my workplace.<br>  <br>  Aside from the financial benefits (cheap fares as opposed to expensive gasoline), there are other benefits.  Your car will have less wear and tear on it, so there will be less repair/maintenance costs.  Your car will have less miles on it, so its resale value might be higher.<br>  <br>  Also, who knows...you might meet some new friends while using public transportation.

wqchA8B7aa	The Corolla has a higher reliability rating, and would be the better car.|`|6NqcZFd1aa	new or used|`|G07o0cHPaa	I'll break down the three cars for you basically as I see them.  The Corolla probably is the best for the money.  The base model is about $16000 and has the best gas mileage at 26 but the least power with 132 horsepower.  The tC is about $18000 and has the most power with 161 horsepower but the worst gas mileage with 21 mpg.  The Mazda3 pretty much combines these two vehicles.  It's priced right in the middle.  It has 148 horsepower and gets 24 mpg.  Then you have to consider the cars' reliability.  Toyota is the most reliable brand.  So for the money, the Corolla is probably the best because of its gas mileage, reliability, and cheap price.  You just sacrifice the power, but I'm sure it'd still be plenty powerful the way today's engines are.  A coworker has a 2000 Chevy Cavalier with 115 horsepower.  I have a 1992 Volvo 240 with 115 horsepower, and he blows me out of the water.|`|xwZ1pD0aaa	I don't particularly like these choices but I'd have to say that I would go with the Mazda 3. It is a relatively quick car, has lots of room, good styling, and is reliable. The Corolla is not very good looking, slow and boring. There isn't anything bad about the Tc, but I think the Mazda would be the better choice.

AA11914369	The whole idea of the learners permit is to give you a chance to learn to drive.  So do you mean you were driving alone, without the adult in the car with you?  If so, it depends on what the court told you when you appeared on your 'driving without a license' ticket.  Usually when they pull, they pull until age 18, so instead of asking us, try to remember what the judge told you.

13kMNf0faa	Well I can only answer a few of those questions. First, a corporate pilot generally makes quite a bit of money, my FLT110 professor says their salary can be as high as $70,000 to $90,000 a year. The downside to this is being on call 24/7, meaning that a corporate pilot will always have to be ready to drop what he/she is doing and go. My professor said that one of his friends did this for 22 years, "living out of his suitcase," and eventually burned out. He can't even bear flying recreationally anymore. He now lives alone and runs a small business.<br>  <br>  A corporate pilot could use advanced aircraft experience as a stepping stone to an airline career, but one of the more common ways of career advancement in aviation is multiengine flight instructor>regional airline pilot (pilots at these airlines start off at VERY meager salaries, but the pay gets significantly better after 5+ years)>major airline pilot.|`|A4Hyfwt9aa	usually getting a job as a corporate pilot requires that you have a very high number of hours and a lot of experience. because of this, i would think that it would be the other way around where being an airline pilot might just be a stepping stone to become a corporate pilot. i know ADI out of hillsboro airport is contracted to fly as a corporate shuttle for intel and they just hired a U2 pilot for his qualifications|`|087b3a69218d27c82057dd4c564f82c9aa	Military pilots have a greater advantage in being hired|`|VyAHw76daa	Salary varies widely, but large cabin (over 40,000 lbs mtow) international can make $150k+. <br>  The 80 to 90k someone mentioned is not the high end. Used to be about 20 years ago. Depends on the company and the equipment. Many newer mid-size jets pay that or even a little more. I know that based on personal experience.<br>  The on call 24/7 someone mentioned is more prevalent in charter.<br>  Usually, you won't fly more than one or possibly two types at a time.<br>  The jobs described above usually require an ATP, jet time, and one or more type ratings and that is for second in command / co-captain. Sometimes captains are hired directly, but seldom with less than 4,000 to 5,000 hours, or more. Again, personal experience (in "super mid-size").
TdrgZwnoaa	I live in Central Canada and the temperature is -45 F.<br>  <br>   I am not going to shut my car off until Spring. Took me three days and a new battery just to get it started.|`|mQZDizMVaa	I say that's an open invitation for a carjack-and/or worse. Why leave yourself open??<br>  <br>  I shut it off and take my keys with me. I'd rather return to my car where I left it, than return-and there's another car parked there or someone's been hiding low in the backseat because I didn't check before entering my car-especially at night.<br>  <br>  I'm never in a convenience store that long where the car will either get colder, or warmer because I didn't keep it running.|`|FuvCgaEMaa	Hehe... Funny you would ask that. My car has a remote starter in it, and the starter also works after the car is already started. I can press a button, and take the keys out of the car and leave it running... and lock the door. And if someone tries to take the car, it will automatically shut off because I have the key!<br>  <br>  Anyway... I'm guessing people want to keep the car warm/cool in the winter/summer... or maybe just keep the engine running, since starting the car sometimes sounds pretty bad to some vehicles.<br>  <br>  You know what's worse though? People who park their car just outside the door in front of a large store like Wal-Mart or something, blocking the road and parked right on the crosswalk while they 'run in for a few things'.|`|kjdKkDAkaa	They leave the car running to run the heater or air conditioner -- for the comfort of passengers that might be sitting in the car while they run in to pick up something.|`|WaYZQhnHaa	Maybe they're trying to keep the interior warm?

d014f113fb3eecfed19b0fbba5d885d9aa	Honda, as the other Japanese automotive companies, do not use the same methods as used by the US firms (i.e.: ISO/TS 16949:2002, PPAP, APQP, FMEA, SPC and MSA).  The do however spend a lot of up front planning time and involve their suppliers to try to ensure that things are designed well and to the customer wants and needs long before a vehicle is ever produced.<br>  <br>  So, they are much more into quality assurance versus tradition quality control which involves more inspections of products.  Honda still does a fair amount of inspection and testing, however, it is done by the people actually doing the work (workers check their own work) and thing like process behavior studies are done to ensure that manufacturing processes are stable.<br>  <br>  Their ultimate goal is to prevent things from going wrong in the first place.  And as any organization who practices prevention versus detection of quality, they are always trying to do things better each year.|`|ManJOzqgaa	ensuring that they keep doing what they have been doing for over 40 years

AA12339318	"Buzzed" is just another way of saying "I'm not as drunk as I think I am."  The point is, that if one has been drinking enough to "feel the buzz" then one is already drunk.  That is to say, that person's ability to drive safely has already been impaired.  One doesn't have to be falling down drunk, reeling from wall to wall to have judgement, corordination and reactions effected.<br>  <br>  That's the point of all those public service announcements talking about "buzzed driving is drunk driving."  That's because it IS.<br>  <br>  I know you're just being a wise guy with your comment about how you might as well finish getting drunk before driving home since it is the same.  But the impact of those commercials should be that one should NOT drive buzzed anymore than driving while roaring drunk.<br>  <br>  Someone killed by a "buzzed" driver is just as dead as one killed by a "drunk" driver.<br>  <br>  So, points to you for being a VERY funny guy.  And thanks for giving me the opportunity to "lecture" the "other guys" who don't get it.|`|fl60KL8oaa	Buzzed is a synonym for drunk, along with lubricated, sloshed, inebriated, etc..<br>  <br>  Anything that impairs your ability to drive is dangerous to others.  Yes, you can 'compensate' -- but your compensated state is not as good as when you are unimpaired.<br>  <br>  As far as I am concerned anyone caught driving drunk should be executed to prevent them from harming others.  Unfortunately, since our lawmakers are a bunch of drunkards, such a law will never be.|`|Unz5OISBaa	There are two issues I believe to be at the heart of your question:<br>  <br>  First- Buzzed driving is dangerous. Sober driving is the only acceptable form. It puts your life in danger and while you can choose to endanger yourself, it is not your choice to puts others' lives in danger; thus it is your responsibility and moral obligation to not do so.<br>  <br>  Second- it is the principle of the ads that you should bear to mind, not get anal about minute details. Being so focused on a leaf on one tree being called a leaf on another tree, you can't see the forest. You are getting overly aggravated by something that really doesn't matter. How could those commercials be dangerous?|`|kjdKkDAkaa	You should not drive if you have been drinking, used any type drug, or if you are too tired.  Any time you are not alert --and paying attention -- an accident could happen.   The driver needs to pay attention to the road. Also don't text while driving.  People could get killed.|`|df0fb3a39c5ecd295c01ce5e48fe2a6daa	Like you I was ok when I had a buzz, but since it's drunk now you may as well close the bar down and follow all the drunks out, follow them and hope they get get pulled over and not you.|`|FuvCgaEMaa	Friend of mine in med school was explaining the brain's ability to compensate  to me some time ago. I can't remember what its called... but its like if you catch a ball with your left hand, it is hard at first but a few hours of tossing a ball around your brain learns to compensate using your non-main hand.<br>  <br>  Similar with drinking. If someone is a regular drinker, or heavy drinker, the brain learns to compensate. There is no special feeling, or enhancement, its an automatic process that your brain does by itself. The brain of a regular drinker compensates for the effects of alcohol. The brain learns that alcohol makes the fluid in your ears thinner, so the brain tells the body to not overreact to small changes. Vision blurs and speech becomes impeded... but again, the brain learns to compensate and make adjustments.<br>  <br>  This can be beneficial, but mostly its downright dangerous. Why? Because its your brain that compensates, not your body. So after 8 beers one person can no longer walk a straight line. But an experienced drinker, whose brain has learned to compensate, will be able to walk a perfectly straight line even after 8 beers. So one person is 'drunk' while the other person is just 'buzzed'. However, assuming both weigh the same (among other things), both will register the same blood-alcohol level.<br>  <br>  So yes, it is entirely possible that a regular drinker will feel 'buzzed' and still speak coherently and still pass a sobriety test if given one, but guess what? That person's blood-alcohol level is still over the limit, and s/he is drunk driving.<br>  <br>  Since different brains accommodate for alcohol differently, obviously because no two people are alike, alcohol affects everyone differently. Where it may take 4 drinks for someone to be 'over the limit' it may only take 1 drink for someone else to be 'over the limit'.<br>  <br>  This is why no one representing law enforcement will accredit someone a numeric value of drinks and still be okay, because a numeric value effects everyone differently.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is: are you, or are you not over the limit? Buzzed driving may, or may not, be over the limit. Do you take a breathalyzer test each time before you drive? I don't know anybody who does... but personally if I drink anything, I don't drive. It is simply not worth the risk... not of being in an accident, but of going to jail and getting a record. A criminal record follows you for life... again it doesn't matter if you are 'safe' and/or pass the 'sobriety test'... but line between being a criminal and not being a criminal is the blood-alcohol level; being 'drunk' or 'buzzed' means nothing in the eyes of the law.|`|hSVmtOmPaa	Well, it depends on what you call buzzed... The average person can process one unit (which is about 25ml of a spirit) in one hour... A glass of wine is two units, so it takes about two hours. I always start off my night with a shot and then drink two drinks an hour. Then I drink plain coke until I feel like I'm not drunk, which can be anywhere from one to two hours. I've driven drunk a few times, but I'm an excellent drunk driver, because I concentrate very, very hard... I've been told I'm a better driver when I'm drunk! But, not all people are like me. I can hold my alcohol, very well, some can't. Plain and simple, if you have any doubts about your ability to drive, then don't! And some people can get a buzz and still be legal to drive. Usually people who haven't been drinking for a long time, can, because they get a buzz quicker than someone who's been drinking all their life.

M7G3MZb5aa	I didnt read the whoel article, but it apears the article is attempting rewire how power comes from the alternator, not so much how much poer comes from it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In ANY car alternator, the maximum amperage it will produce, at higher rpms i s only about 125-150 amps for large ones.  Most small sedans only have 60-80 amp alternators.<br>  <br>  60-80 amps at 12v equates to 720-960 watts, which isnt anywhere near the power requirements of a welder.  Also, consider, that much of that wattage is required for neccessary car electronics like the fuel pump, ignition circuit, and is already being consumed.<br>  <br>  If you want to weld, the bottom line is you need a lot of power, the more power you want to have flowing through a  wire, the larger gauge the wire must be, or else it will melt.  You cant really change the gauge of the coil wires in your alternator, or add to them so If you make said modifications and attempt to draw too much current from your alternator, it will overheat,  the enamel of the coils will melt, shorting the coil, and it will no longer produce current.  <br>  <br>  You can replace alternators for ones that have larger diamiter coils, more coils, heavier gauge wires, coling fans, or in extreme cases, ones that have their own liquid cooling systems and their own radiator.  In no way though will you be able to produce enough power from your stock alternator to weld metal for practical applications.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Your cars battery will act as a buffer for periods of demand that exceed the alternator, where istead of the alternator supplyying current, your battery will, and you alternator will slowly reachareg it during periods of non energy demand, however if you continuously demand more power than the alternator can produce, eventually the battery will run out of reserve energy, and you will overdraw the alternator.<br>  <br>  You could, if you wanted to weld for short periods of time, wihtout any modifications taking power right from your alternator, but continuous welding would drain your battery (in a matter of about 5-15 minutes)<br>  <br>  Vehicles with onboard welders usually have their own high power generator, or they have **multiple** large alternators to produce the required current.|`|jieKgKF1aa	u may be able to but remember if u weld on your car u will have to disconnect battery as u will destroy car electrics.i would buy a alternator from a wrecking yard and go from there.

6eed191f92816934ee83412350490737aa	I would need more information to help you.  What makes you think it's the starter?  Do you hear a clicking sound when you try to start it hot?  Or is the engine cranking but not running?  <br>  <br>  If it is cranking over but not running when the vehicle is hot, I would check the fuel pressure first.  On the fuel lines going to the injectors, there should be a fuel valve 'port' on that line that you can test for fuel pressure.  You would have to hook a fuel pressure gauge to it.  If there is pressure, the next thing to check would be spark.  You can pull off one spark plug wire from a spark plug, put a screw driver in the end, hold the screw driver about a cm from an engine bracket(or something grounded), and crank the engine.  Watch for a spark between the screw driver and the metal.  (NOTE, the spark WILL hurt if you are touching the metal part of the screw driver, so be careful!  50,000 volts or more will be coming through there.)  If there is spark, then your issue is likely a sensor or computer related.  <br>  <br>  If you need more help, PM me or update your question.  I will check back.|`|2XusVa4jaa	Does it crank and not start? If it cranks and won't start, I would suspecta a bad CTS(Coolant Temp Sensor). That was a commen problem on these engines. Pull it out and see if it has a plastic tip on it. If so, replace it with a brass tip unit. It is located in the cylinder head under the air induction tube. Just take the air cleaner assembly off and it's right there. 2 wires on the connector. Good Luck!
AA10747736	frankly you have not given enough information to give a really good answer, Like how old are you, what state, the vehicle may not be insurable in some states. do you already have a vehicle insured, are there other people in your home that are old enough to drive your car. What city do you live in. How do the insurance companies rate your particular car. These questions could go on and on I will just make the suggestion, contact your local insurance company and just ask them . I do not know but i do not think that $600 would be enough, but I do not live where you do and might be surprised. If any one else answers and tries to tell you other wise they do not know what they are talking about.

If you don't have a checking account, you can mail your payment via money order or cashier's check (although in some places you can't get cashier's checks under certain amounts, which vary).  Or you can call the number on the ticket, or visit the website listed (if either is on there) and find out how to pay the ticket in person.  Some places have offices where they take payments, others require you to pay at the court.  It's generally never a good idea to mail cash - you can't prove that you paid.  With a check or money order, you have the stub or canceled check; by paying in person you can get a receipt for the cash.|`|kjdKkDAkaa	Running a stop sign --or a red light -- can cause accidents. <br>  Pay attention when you are driving and obey all traffic laws. <br>  You will have to pay the fine --and on time.

2HKSwHkSaa	Both are excellent vehicles, that should give you many years of trouble free service, provided routine maintenance is followed.  Having ridden in both vehicles, the Corolla seems a little more boring to me.  Also, if you have a taller driver or passenger, their knee may rest uncomfortably on the dash, which unfortunately isn't padded as well.  You say you've already narrowed down your choices, but if you want to stick with Honda and Toyota, don't cross off the Yaris or Fit, they get excellent gas mileage as well.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your choice!|`|xwZ1pD0aaa	The Civic would be a more exciting car to drive if you are looking for that type of car.

2HKSwHkSaa	Honestly, even if you are a responsible driver (and I'm not saying you aren't), you shouldn't seek out the fastest car out there, particularly as a first vehicle.  If you have 10k to play with, I would probably go with something that isn't going to get you in too much trouble with the law, or with excessive power that you may not be capable of handling.  I would suggest an older used vehicle, and keep a good chunk of change in your bank account, versus using it all up to get the best you can.   I would probably look in the 5-6k range for a good used Civic, Corolla, or MX6.  All 3 are fairly peppy cars that get decent gas mileage, and wouldn't nickle and dime you to death like some of the cars on your list (particularly the RX7).  If and when you get bored with your first car, you can turn around and sell it to a broader audience, IMHO, everyone should have a "beater" to learn the ropes on, and not immediately hop into the car they want.  If you are gonna make a mistake, do you want it to be in your dream car, or something that you don't have as high a sentimental attachment to?  <br>  <br>  If I had to pick of the 3 that you had chosen, I would go with the RX7.|`|Q1uTMqRraa	YOu are not the only person who have ever met this kind of problem,I met this type of  problem before.I have good experience here <a href="http://www.AutoInsuranceFree.info/free-auto-insurance.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.AutoInsuranceFree.info/free-a...</a>  to solve the problem.|`|oxHld2zWaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure.

nOrhwrisaa	If you have time call the police so the story is documented and cannot be confused so  easily.  If you don't have the time, you can take your chances by just exchanging information.  But it is not recommended.|`|HQrMEkm0aa	If the damage is less than $700, you can settle it with the other driver only if you do not want your insurance to know about it.  You must report the accident or call the police if the damage is more than $700 for your record and insurance purposes.  If you can afford to pay for the damages, do so, so your insurance won't increase.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	It varies from state to state but usually if there are no injuries and the damage is minor, less than $1,000 which amounts to some scratches or small dents, you are not legally required to call the police.  Read your states drivers ed handbook to find out the exact amount.  As noted, many times the police won't respond to a minor accident even though you might be required to notify them.  <br>  <br>  In Missouri, my state, even if the police do not respond you are required to file an accident report if the damage to either vehicle is more than $500 or there is an injury, and if the police do respond you must wait until they tell you you can leave.<br>  <br>  From the Missouri handbook, my state:  your state is probably similar.  <br>  Under certain circumstances, you are required to file an accident report with the department. State law requires the accident report to be filed within 30 days. Even if the accident happened in a parking lot, or a settlement is made, you must report an accident to the Driver License Bureau if:<br>  1. The accident happened in Missouri;<br>  2. The accident happened less than one year ago;<br>  3. Someone involved in the accident did not have liability insurance coverage; AND<br>  4. There is damage to one or more person's property in excess of $500, or there was personal injury or death.<br>  In other circumstances, you may not be required to report the accident, but you may want to report it anyway. If the accident did not cause more than $500 in property damage, personal injury, or death, you may still file an accident report if there was an uninsured motorist involved. The department will only be able to take action against the uninsured motorist for not maintaining insurance.|`|0TiCSGKtaa	no calling the police is a waste of time most police departments won't even go to the scene unless there is injurys why involved the pd on a silly traffic accident thats why people pay insurance.

If this is located at a dealers lot, and is in good condition, it is probably worth what they are asking.  Sometimes when a vehicle has non-stock components (such as the hood), it can detract from the value, as some people will shy away from it, considering that if the previous owner changed the hood, what else might they have done to the car.   Most people prefer to buy an "unmolested" vehicle, so they know everything is as it should be (hopefully).

The way the car market is going you have to understand these people want to make sales.  Sometimes they will even take a big hit just to clear inventory.   Don't be afraid to ask him what may need to be done with the car in the future.  Whether it has had an oil change done.  The last time the trans was serviced, brakes, brake lines, fuel lines, tune up (plugs, wires, coal packs) you name it.  Look over the car as well and based on your automotive knowledge don't be afraid to take someone with you that you know and trust that knows a little bit about vehicles and what to look for.  The car is a 2000, whether it was built in 99 or 2000, the car is 10 years old or approaching it, depending on where you live that's when preventative maintaining starts to take effect.  Things start going, depending on the mileage and where you live (weather conditions and such).  You may be able to bring him down to 4500, depending on what needs to be corrected.  I'm not saying the thing is going to self destruct, its just little stuff that starts crapping out when a car reaches a certain age.

If you drop it down a gear (smaller gear=turns faster=higher RPM) Then you can possibly cause a lot of damage to your car. <br>  If you're in 5th gear doing 60ish, you'll be fine to drop it into 4th gear (Make sure you're putting it into the correct gear to avoid damage).  More than likely the next gear lower will be plenty. Very few times will you need to go 2 gears lower.

I own one of each, and have been happy with both.  Home Depot and Lowe"s both offer a lower priced, guaranteed wrench in their own brands that are comparable, and have a one year warranty.<br>  <br>  I've used both the Bosch and the Milwaukee for 8 hours a day, bolting foundations and torquing bolts on metal buildings, for up to three month stretches.  Both guns still are in operation.  The Bosch is 14 years old, the Milwaukee is 8|`|pIEw1cnOaa	Electric?  To be perfectly honest no electric I have come across has come anywhere close to an air impact,  especially if you want to go cheap.  With tools you get what you pay for.  I have a Snap-on blue point air impact and if I'm not careful that thing will snap a lug stud off quicker than you realize.  My gun costs somewhere in the range of 80-130 bucks, but it was worth every penny.  My grandfather had an electric and I almost lost every lug nut on my car when I tightened them up with it.  With my air gun, I have yet to lose a lug nut yet with it turned up.  I had lugs come loose on me once and that was only due to me not having the power turned up in my gun, and they just loosened, they didn't come off.  Personally your best bet is to skip the electric and just go for air, you'll be better off in the long run.

7uRfiIFKaa	I would say yes. I have a VW GTI (Which is a VW Golf with the 2.0L Turbo engine). On the highway, with the tires properly inflated and going the speed limit I have gotten about 35 miles to the gallon with mine, less on city. I am a college student, and I pretty much just need to fill up the tank about once a month to five weeks. My daily drive averages to about 5-10 miles, with a 65 mile to Indianapolis every so often. I have also had great experience with the warranty and costumer service. I accidentally jammed my CD player, I took it to the dealership, and they replaced it with a new one, and I didn't have to pay a thing. My car came with sun-roof, run flat tires, and satellite radio as standard. I know the GTIs come with a DSG automatic gearbox if you don't want a stick shift, I think the standard Golf also comes with a DSG gearbox. If they do, that is a great thing, the DSG gearbox are the ones used in Audi's they shift faster than any manual or gearbox out there, very smooth driving. The Golf also has a shorter wheelbase than most cars so parking is very easy even in the most cramped of places. And you have to remember that it is a hatchback, so it fits a ton of stuff. The back seats fold forward (They don't fold completely flat like some vans), but I have been able to fit my futon in there. There have been times I have had to help people move their TVs because even though they drive a huge Ford Crown Victoria, they couldn't fit their 22" TV, and I just fit it in my car, no problem. I've also been able to fit 2 bikes and a small fridge in there. I would recommend you go to the dealership and just see if you like it. I know that in Europe the new mark VI model has come out, I don't know when those will come to the US. My car is a 2006 GTI Mk.V. You might be able to get a discount out of the salesman if you can find out when the new models are coming in, and you are willing to take a Mk. V out of their hands. Best of Luck, and take your time choosing your first car. I love Sandy, my car, and I've never had any trouble with her.|`|EmgiGg17aa	VW's are decent vehicles.   Comfortable seats(if it is made in Germany model)  U.S./Mexico made seats are made with foam padding which is much harder than the "horsehair" that the European VW use.

9VzeSKyQaa	This also happened to me when I was upgrading my system, What happened was that my new system was pulling tooo much power from the electrical system and that when the power to the amps run down below like 10 or 11 volts, they shut down as a safety. When you turned your system back down you see, it wasnt pulling as much power so the amps kicked back on.<br>  <br>  If you have not upgraded your big 3, I suggest you do it, if you want to keep running what your running.

5Af6j1qsaa	Sitting beside strangers and having to follow the time tables sucks (waiting for the bus/train to arrive, being delayed when they are delayed, etc).<br>  <br>  The worst drawback is that you get exposed to alot of strangers in a small confined area.  Many people will cough without covering their mouths.  I only get sick every 3 years or so.  However, a couple of weeks ago, I was so sleepy on the train.  I woke up a couple of times to find different people sitting beside me and coughing.  Shortly thereafter, I became sick.

This sub can be powered up to about 1000 RMS Watts.  (I KNOW it isn't just one sub, but there are not many subs under $600 that can push 3200 RMS alone.  There is the 22" MTX Jackhammer which pushes 6000 RMS, but that is $6K)  If you have a few of these Type-X subs, that means you can be probably push close to 5000 watts (3000 watts RMS).  Just to give you an idea of how much bass that is, here is an example:<br>  <br>  800 watts RMS is getting to the point when the bass is pounding so hard that your mirrors are falling off, license plates are rattling, and your coins and drink in the holding compartment are dancing.  The set up I mentioned above could possibly give you close to 3,000 watts RMS?  (2200 watts PAST 800 watts).  Go to the Alpine website and look up the Type-X subs; these subs are absolutely sick.  Check, I think they push 1000 watts RMS each.  Just one of these would probably shock you.  If you want to see them in action, look up Alpine Type X on youtube.  Hope I helped - because I am currently looking for car bass right now too.  (Your trunk should hold more than one sub, unless it is a super compact)

Do this; shift into 4th. Does the whine go away? Does it then whine in 2nd or 3rd? If so it is the transmission bearings--input, and countershaft bearings. It stops making noise in 4th because of the power flow goes straight in and straight out of the trans. Power flow for1st,2nd,3rd and 5th gears all go thru the countershaft and bearings; this added load to the worn bearings will make the noise, but go away in 4th. As always, check the fluid level.

If you really like it, wait a year or so when it is more readily available and people have had time to evaluate it's reliability and everyday practicality.

Now push the door toward the closed position (hard) until you feel it "give a little."<br>  Remove the 2x4's and see if it now closes, if not, repeat the process. Once the door is sprung back, you may have to adjust the latch slightly for alignment. Make sure the door latches all the way and just not on the safety catch.<br>  Perhaps not the fanciest of body working technique - but it'll get you by until you can get it repaired properly.|`|6eed191f92816934ee83412350490737aa	Sorry, but you are going to have to take it to a body shop.

Here is the law for PA<br>  <br>  Pennsylvania Tint Law Enacted: 1999 <br>  HOW DARK CAN WINDOW TINT BE IN PENNSYLVANIA?<br>  <br>  Darkness of tint is measured by Visible Light Transmission percentage (VLT%). In Pennsylvania, this percentage refers to percentage of visible light allowed in through the combination of film and the window. <br>    <br>  Windshield No tint is allowed on the windshield.  <br>  Front Side Windows Must allow more than 70% of light in. <br>  Back Side Windows Must allow more than 70% of light in. <br>  Rear Window Must allow more than 70% of light in. <br>    <br>  HOW REFLECTIVE CAN THE TINT BE IN PENNSYLVANIA?<br>  <br>  Similar to sunglass lenses, some tinting film contain metallic elements that help in reflecting incoming light and reducing the glare and heat generated by visible light. <br>    <br>  Front Side Windows No metallic or mirrored appearance. <br>  Back Side Windows No metallic or mirrored appearance. <br>    <br>  OTHER PENNSYLVANIA RULES AND REGULATIONS<br>    <br>  Restricted Colors No colors of tint are explicitly banned.  <br>  Side Mirrors Dual side mirrors are required if back window is tinted.  <br>  Certificate Requirements Manufacturers of film do NOT need to certify the film they sell in the state.  <br>  Sticker Requirements  <br>  Medical Exemption State allows medical exemptions for special tint.

AA10560304	Horsepower (hp or HP) is the name of several non-SI units of power. It was originally defined to allow the output of steam engines to be measured and compared with the power output of draft horses. The horsepower was widely adopted to measure the output of piston engines, turbines, electric motors and other machinery. Different regions adopted different definitions of the unit. Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power.<br>  <br>  The definition of a horsepower unit is different in different applications; application outside of the context of a particular definition will be inaccurate.<br>  <br>  One mechanical horsepower of 550 foot-pounds per second is equivalent to 745.7 watts <br>  A metric horsepower of 75 kgf-m per second is equivalent to 735.499 watts <br>  A boiler horsepower is used for rating steam boilers and is equivalent to 34.5 pounds of water evaporated per hour at 212 degrees Fahrenheit, or 9809.5 watts <br>  One horsepower for rating electric motors is equal to 746 watts <br>  A Pferdest?rke is a name for a group of similar power measurements used in Germany around the end of the 19th century, all of about one metric horsepower in size.<br>  An ALAM or SAE horsepower is not a unit of power but instead is a measure of internal combustion engine displacement, and an RAC horsepower or tax horsepower is a differently defined unit of displacement.<br>  <br>  Where units of horsepower are used for marketing consumer products, often measurement methods are designed by advertisers to maximize the size of the number produced for any product, even if this may not reflect realistic capacity of the product to do work when used in normal conditions.|`|ZBFE9AqZaa	you probably mean rwhp or rear rear horsepower for rear wheel drive cars. or fwhp front wheel drive horsepower.<br>  <br>  the transmission may use up as much as 100 horsepower from the engine crank shaft to what is measured off the wheels on a dynomometer.|`|DEXSuqT7aa	that is referring to Wheel Horse Power<br>  <br>  When you see HP ratings for cars that is Engine or Crank Horse Power.  Some of that HP is lost thru the trans and differential so the actual HP is less than stated.<br>  <br>  Not sure on how fast as would depend on vehicle, as to weight, trans, wheel size, etc<br>  <br>  I have seen EVO with 1025WHP do low 9's at 1/4m at 156mph

b8cupXj7aa	only limited data suggest that pulsating landing lights reduce bird strikes.<br>  <br>  Its primary role is so People (as in other  pilots) can see the approaching aircraft. The human eye responds to movement more readily than  static light.|`|4bGQpFB3aa	What cherokee said, just like you'll see on motorcycles some times.|`|119d016eb9c5c40198447d8e43281d0aaa	Some aircraft are equipped with what's called "Pulsating lights". These are the ones you see flashing on landings, and sometimes also on take off. <br>  The purpose of these is to scare of birds in the path of the aircraft. It is not 100% effective, but it does work.<br>  <br>  At the wingtips you will find Strobe lights, which are the ones that blink on and off constantly during the flight. Under the fuselage, and on top you will find the Rotating Beacon. Strobes and beacons are used for collision avoidance.|`|OblSdMaaaa	You may be referring to the strobes, which are standard on all aircraft flying at night (so they can be spotted by ATC and other aircraft). <br>  <br>  The only other reason (that I can think of) for flashing the actual landing lights is to communicate with the control tower in the event of a radio/comm. failure.

Very common on older vehicles. If it is a newer style, electronic speedo, this could be link to a bad speedo.|`|hD25pT1Laa	If it uses a mechanical speedo, lubing the cable often fixes this problem. Depending on the model it may be easy or quite difficult to reach the end that clips on to the speedo head. You push down on a retainer and the cable pulls off. Then you can grab the inner cable with needle nose pliers and pull it out. Rub it down with Lubriplate white grease and reassemble.|`|1i8uJN4Kaa	what determines the speed of the car is a metal or plastc cog which is inside the gearbox, if im right it has probably worn or broken a tooth off it, hope this helps|`|PLZfk1qDaa	its your speed sensor, its not affecting your car in any bad ways, but go to auto zone, tell them the problem and replace it for around 10-15 bucks

Anymore, it's hard to buy a stereo and have it installed that would come close to the factory ones, they're that good.  They might have skimped on some other probably more important parts over the last few years, but the stereo systems wasn't one of them.

The 1987-1989 Dodge Raider is a rebadged version of the Mitsubishi Montero and I am sure there are many more Mitsubishi Montero owners than there are Dodge Raider owners. I suggest you Google "Mitsubishi Montero forum" to find a website where you can ask wiring questions about the 1989 Mitsubishi Montero (aka 1989 Dodge Raider).|`|zOIgzIy4aa	the ground post on the coil goes to the distributor and the hot post goes to the ignition.|`|bvCkplELaa	Identifix dot com has a nice wiring schematic.
